He emigrated with his parents from his native State to Douglas County, Illinois, and settled on a farm about 4 miles southwest of Newman in the year 1851, when 12 years of age. Here he resided with his parents until the outbreak of the Civil War, and at the County's call for volunteers to defend the flag and preserve the Union, he willingly responded and enlisted in Company C, First Regiment Missouri Volunteer Infantry, and served his country from enlistment to the close of that great struggle and was honorably discharged at Rolly, Missouri, April 15th, 1865. After the close of the war he returned home and began the peaceful life of a Farmer and was married to Sarah A. Johnson, daughter of Dr. J. T. and Mary A. Johnson, January 1st, 1867. After farming several years he purchased a farm one and one half miles west of Newman and moved there in March 1875, and there lived with the exception of four years, until November 1909, when he moved to the city of Newman, where he has since resided.\n\nThe deceased, although a strong believer in religion and religious work, never identified himself with any church, until about six years ago when he became a member of the M. E. church, together with his wife, during the pastorate of Rev. W. L. Ewing. His wife Sarah A. departed this life July 21, 1914. Mr. Hawkins was again married January 25, 1916 to Rhoda A, White daughter of Thomas and Lucy White, who survives to mourn his loss. Mr. Hawkins not having any children in his own family, took Chas A. Hawkins, a nephew, at the age of eight years and raised and educated him. Mr. Hawkins also took into his home Lula Curtis, a girl about ten years of age, whom he also raised and educated. Mr. Hawkins has always been proud of these two children, and no one could tell but what they were his own.\n\nMr. Hawkins was an ardent Republican in principle and served one term as Commissioner of Highways of Newman Township several years ago, was nominated and elected Mayor of the City of Newman in April 1915, his term as Mayor would have expired in April 1917. Both offices which he held were filled with justice and impartiality. He became a member of the Masonic order No. 369 A. F. & A. M. in the year 1873, being at the time of his death one of its oldest members, and lived an honorable and exemplary life, and observed well and faithful the Golden Rule in all his dealings with his neighbors and fellow-men.

Mr. John Hawkins who had passed the 79th milestone in life's highway.\n\nHe was a man of generous impulses and never forgot the hospitable Way of the pioneer. The stranger, even though a beggar, never failed to find food and shelter if he sought it at his hands, and he was at home by the bedside of the sick and delighted in all kinds and neighborly offices. He had borne adversity bravely and enjoyed prosperity quietly. He had filled the various relations of life, as son, husband, father, brother, friend, and filled them well. Who can do more? But he is gone! Another name stricken from t he every lessening roll of our old settlers. He was a man of excellent habits and Christian character and in him Newman loses one of her best citizens.\n\nThe funeral services were held at the M.E. church, Wednesday morning at 10 o'clock, under the auspices of Lowe Post 323, G.A.R., and were largely attended, attesting the fact that he was held in the highest esteem by our citizens. The funeral discourse was delivered by the Rev. C. W. Caseley, pastor of the church. The music was tendered by a quartet composed of Miss Lane Root, Mrs. Belle Jenkins, Messrs. Fred L. White, and M. S. Smith, with Miss Jessie Vandine presiding at the piano. The floral offerings were very beautiful and numerous. The remains were taken to the Albin cemetery for interment beside the remains of his beloved wife who died some years ago.\n\nThe following obituary prepared by Mr. D. O. Root was read at the funeral:\n\n\"John Hawkins came with his father's family from the place of his birth in the fall of 1850, and settled in the near vicinity of where the city of Newman now stands, and so has been a resident of this place continuously for over 58 years, excepting the three years he spent in support of the flag in the war of the rebellion.\n\nBrother Hawkins was happily united in marriage with Miss Ivy Hopkins, daughter of the late Cornelius Hopkins, on July 3, 1859, to which union there were born 12 children, viz, Wiley, Hattie, Harrison, Marion, Cora, Emma, Rosetta, Ida, and four who have died in infancy. Of the eight children named all are married but two- Hattie, who is deceased, and Emma, who has had charge of the home and care of her aged father, since the death of her mother, which sad event occurred Dec 30th, 1899. Of those married; Wylie resides in Tuscola; Harrison, Mountain View, Mo; Cora, Lebanon, Indiana; Rosetta, Hume, Ill; while Marion and Ida are residents of this city, and all are among our best citizens.\n\nIn 1887 Brother Hawkins was converted and united with the U.B. church, and soon afterward changed his membership to the Methodist Episcopal church, where it has since remained. Mrs. Hawkins was ever a moral and upright man and citizen, and since he began his church life, he has been a faithful consistent follower of the world's Redeemer, always in hi place at the house of God when his health permitted, showing in his intercourse with his fellows and fellow laborers in the Master's vineyard that he had \"Christ formed within the hope of glory.\" When the pilgrimage of such an one has ended, there remains no doubt as to his future state. He is safe in the arms of our blessed Master. Brother Hawkins' health has been failing for some years past, much of the time being confined to the house. His advanced age, with exposure and its results of his years of army life added, perhaps hastened his end. His decline was gradual and he seemed to just waste away, and among the last words spoken by him were. \" I feel so tired.\" and yet throughout his long sickness he resigned to the will of his heavenly Father, and when at last the \"weary wheels of life stood still\", we have a hope well grounded that Bro. Hawkins spirit freed from it's clayey tenement passed triumphantly through the Golden Gates into the house not made with hands eternally in the Heavens, where we can safely save him.\n\nOn July 30, 1863, during the darkest days of the late civil war he left his young wife and entered the Service of his country as a member of Co. E. 79th Reg. Ill Div Inf., one of the fighting regiments of the war and served in the ranks three long and wearisome years. Never wasting his powder, it ever aiming to send his bullet where it would do the most harm, the brave foe in his front. Mr. Hawkins' bravery in everyone of the bloody battles in which he was engaged stands unquestioned as his comrades here present, who served with him in the ranks, will cheerfully confirm and endorse. His record for loyalty to country, and his staunch bravery on the battlefield, are important factors in the rich legacy he has left to his sorrowing dear ones.\n\nBrother Hawkins, leaves surviving him, beside those already named, two brothers, Samuel and James M., and one sister, Rebecca Luce, of Arcola, and many others near and remotely related to him, to each of all of whom the unfeigned sympathy of this community, in which the deceased has so long been a factor for good, are freely extended.\n\n[Submitted by Source #44]\n\nHAWKINS, Iva\n\nMrs. Iva Hopkins Hawkins\n\nIva Hopkins was born in Douglas County on August 19, 1842 and died on the 30th of Decemeber, 1899.

ONLY ILL A FEW HOURS.- FUNERAL HELD WEDNESDAY\n\nMr. Samuel Hopkins died at his home south-west of the city, about 10 o'clock Saturday night, after an illness of only a few hours. Mr. Hopkins was in the city at noon Saturday in his usual health but later in the afternoon was taken with neuralgia. A doctor was summoned and his condition seemed to improve until about 9:30 in the evening when a sudden turn came and in a very short time his spirit took it's flight to the God who gave it. He was one among the old residents of this community and had lived his entire life here, where he was well known and respected. He was one of the most prosperous farmers and stock raisers, of generous impulses and always wanted to do his part in everything for the good of the community and the people. The funeral rites took place at the late home, Wednesday afternoon, at 2:30 o'clock, and were largely attended. The funeral discourse was given by Rev. A. A. Heinlein, pastor of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and was very fitting and filled with thoughts of deep import for the living. The floral offerings were very beautiful and came from relatives and friends. Music was rendered by a quartet composed of Miss Halleen Long, Mrs. A. A. Heinlein, messrs., F.L. White, and M.S. Smith. Interment took place at the Albin cemetery. The following obituary was read at the funeral rites;\n\n\"Among the early pioneers of Newman community were the parents of Samuel Lowe Hopkins in whose memory we are assembled. To these parents, James Hopkins and Elizabeth Ann Thomas Hopkins were born ten children, our departed friend, the sixth son, being born October 22, 1849. Two of his elder brothers were martyred soldiers of the Civil War service. Of the family, Vellie Alice, Mrs. Scott Burgett, the fourth daughter, alone survives. Mr. Hopkins was born a short distance south of Newman, on the ancestral home place., where Mr. Riley Fleetwood now lives. His early life was spent there. October 5, 1885, he married Miss Hattie Bell, of Oakland. To their union six children were born and they re here today the comfort of their mother. They are: Albert Earl; Elizabeth (Mrs. William Ogg);James Ray, Mrs. Nellie May Saunders, Virgie Bell (Mrs. Ray Casebeer), Russell Winfield. Twelve grandchildren and numerous nephews and nieces, in addition to many more distant relatives, lament his sudden and unlooked for departure from this life:dissolution occurring Saturday, October 14, 1922, at eleven in the evening.\n\nMr. Hopkins is described by one of his acquaintances as \"a man who attended to his own business\" the remark meaning that he was very slow to interfere in the affairs of others. This characteristic probably accounts for the fact that many people found him hard to approach. As one gained his acquaintances, however, he revealed geniality and friendliness. His children think of him as a comrade as well as parent. he maintained this attitude after they had reached maturity. It was his delight to have their company upon journeys to rather distant localities entering into the experiences of such trips with all the zest of much younger men. This writer was gradually getting acquainted with him. Though without the intimate and indispensable consolation and benefit of church membership, Mr. Hopkins believed in the value of the church as a institution and is numbered among it regular supporters.\" [Submitted by source #44]\n\nHOPKINS, George\n\nGONE TO ETERNITY\n\nMr. George Hopkins Answers Death's Call\n\nILLNESS OF ONLY A FEW DAYS\n\nFuneral Services Took Place at Wesley Chapel Sunday Afternoon -Interment Albin Cemetery.\n\nThe funeral of Mr. George Hopkins, who died at his home, 3 1/2 miles South-west of the city, on Saturday morning, took place at Wesley chapel Sunday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock, under the auspices of the G.A.R., the funeral discourse being preached by Rev. J. Glick. The following obituary was read at the funeral by Mr. D.O. Root:\n\n\"George, son of the late Cornelius Hopkins and Rachel his wife, was born January 2nd, 1844.

H. of the 25th Reg. ILL. Vol Inf. and was mustered into the Military service Aug 4, 1861 at St. Louis, MO, and participated in all the dreary marches and all the conflicts with the enemy in which his regiment was engaged for three long and dreary years, with True loyalty and zeal, making a record of which none need blush. When the term of his enlistment was ended, he returned home and again took up the pursuits of Peace as a tiller of the soil.\n\nOn Oct 17, 1867, Mr. Hopkins was happily united in marriage with Miss Sarah E. Mitchell, who survives him. To this union ten children were born, one half of whom are living, the other five having preceded him beyond the river. Three of the surviving children; Ernest, Bertha and Eva are married, and two, Ora and Ervin are single and yet abide under the paternal roof.\n\nSome sixteen years ago Mr. Hopkins became deeply interested in the subject of religion, accepted the Christ and became his humble follower and united with the Separate Baptist Church, within the folds of which he remained until death transferred him to the church triumphant beyond the realm of human fragility's.\n\nMr. Hopkins was a man of decided convictions on questions moral and religion and was usually outspoken in in expressing them; yet he was tolerant to a masked degree and accorded to others the rights and privileges he claimed and exercised on proper occasions for himself. A considerate husband, an affectionate father, and exemplary Christian, a tried and true Neighbor and a loyal citizen; George Hopkins will be missed not only by his sorrowing family but by the community in which he was born and spent a life of near three score years. He leaves to mourn their loss, besides his immediate family, which has been mentioned, one sister and two brothers out of a once large family. The sister Mrs.Lillie Conover, of Tuscola, ILL, was present at the bedside of her brother. The brothers, Cornelius, of Bement, Ill, and Samuel, of South Dakota were prevented from attendance- the former by sickness in the family and the later by distance, and beside these a large number of other relatives and friends, all of whom have the unfeigned sympathies of this entire community and especially so to the bereaved wife, who lost a companion with whom she has walked and upon whom she had leaned for more than 35 years of life's changing scenes and the orphaned children as well.\" [Newman Weekly Independent- May 8, 1903 - Submitted by Src #44]\n\nHOPKINS, James\n\nMr. James Hopkins Dead\n\nAnother Pioneer of this Section Passed To The Great Beyond, On Friday May 28th.

James Hopkins aged 72 years, 7 months and 5 days.\n\nThe deceased was a man of generous impulse and never forgot the hospital ways of the pioneer. The stranger, Even though a beggar, never failed to find food and shelter; if he sought it at his hands, as he was at home by the bedside of the sick and delighted in all kinds and neighborly offices. He had born adversity bravely and enjoyed prosperity quietly. He had filled the various relations of life, as son, husband, friend, and filled them well, Who can do more?\n\nBut he is gone! Another name is stricken from the ever lessening roll of our old settlers, and a solitary woman in the golden sunset of life, and a lonely home, are left to attest how sadly they will miss him. It must be so; these tender human ties cannot be severed without a pang. Yet in such a death there is really no cause for grief. His life work was done, and well done. He had passed his golden wedding day and wearied with life's duties and cares, weary of suffering and waiting he lay down to rest.\n\n\"Tired! ah, yes so tired dear\n\nI shall soundly sleep tonight:\n\nWith never a dream and never a fear,\n\nTo wake in the Morning light.\"\n\nHe was a man who united sound sense with strong convictions, and a candid, outspoken temper, eminently fitted to mold the rude elements of pioneer society into form and consistency, and aid in raising a high standard of citizenship. How much the community south-west of Newman in which he resided so many years owes him and such as he, it is impossible to estimate, though it would be a grateful task to trace his influence though some of the more direct channels, to hold him up in these degenerate days, in his various characters of husband and father, of Neighbors and friend, to speak of the son and daughter he has reared to perpetuate his name and emulate his virtues. But it comes not within the scope of this brief sketch to do so. Suffice it to say, he lived nobly and died peacefully at the advance age of 72 years. \"as a shock of corn, fully ripe for the harvest,\"\n\nNot for him be our tear! rather let us crown his grave with garland; few of us will live as long or as well, and fewer yet will the Angel of Death greet with such a loving touch.\n\nThe deceased was born in Vermillion county, Indiana Oct 23, 1836, and died May 28, 1909, after a lingering illness. He came with his parents to Douglas county in 1837, locating on a farm 4 1/2 miles south-west of Newman, where he resided his whole life with the exception of one year, which has been spent in Newman having removed with his venerable wife to this city some twelve months ago where he has spent the declining days surrounded by all the comforts of life and given all the care possible to be administered by the loving hands of admiring friends and relatives.\n\nMr. Hopkins was united in holy bonds of matrimony to Miss Sarah M.

Albin and Mrs. Everett Young.\n\nThe following obituary was written by Mrs. J. M. McKnight, and read at the service by Rev. McKnight.\n\n\"Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints'.\n\n\"Anna Mae, only daughter of Martha Price and Samuel A. Macgregor, was born at Punxutawney, Pa., on April 9, 1873, and passed away at Edgewater Hospital, in Chicago, January 19, 1936, aged 62 years, 9 months and 10 days. She was left motherless at the tender age of 9 and was taken by her father to his sister, who resided on a farm near Shelbyville, Ill. There she was carefully reared, and given the opportunities of that day. Early in life she manifested musical ability and had the best instruction in both voice and piano. This proved to be a great pleasure and comfort throughout life. She was married to John A. Clause, a young farmer of that community, in 1890. Three children were born to this union.\n\nFive years after the death of Mr. Clause, she was married to Robert E. Johnson, of Newman, Ill. They made their home in Buffalo, N.Y. until the failing health of Mr. Johnson brought them back to his home community. Two children were born to this union. Mr. John's death occurred in 1918. Mrs. Johnson and her family then moved to Washington, D.C., where she was House Mother in the Y.W.C.A. until she was stricken with sleeping sickness, which left her health impaired. On the recommendation of her physician that she live in a smaller place amid more quiet surroundings, she and her son, a young lad, returned to Newman. Here she resided until the last two years, making occasional visits to Chicago in the meantime. This city finally became her home, that she might be with her children. Mrs. Johnson was reared a Scotch - Presbyterian, but the most of her life time, she was a member of the Methodist Church, joining this church with her husband, in their early married life.\n\nTo know Mrs. Johnson was to love her. She possessed a geniality of disposition and a kindness of heart that awakened feeling of fellowship with those with whom she came in contact. She was a devout Christian and had the faculty of speaking with ease on spiritual themes. She was a constant friend and had kind words for all. Perhaps her greatest strength of character was shown in her patient and cheerful endurance of afflictions that came to her. Hers was a glad and victorious spirit that rose in triumph over difficulties.\n\nShe loved all the best things, life, home, children, church, flowers, friends, little children, best of all her Heavenly Father.\n\nShe expressed to her pastor a short time before passing away that she felt the end of her life was near, but that all was well with her, and she was ready to go.\n\nHer immediate illness was of short duration. She was confined to her bed only three days. Creeping paralysis did its work quickly, and the morning of January 19, 1936, at Edgewater Hospital she passed through the gates into the city.\n\nShe leaves to mourn her loss four children: William Clause, Kansas City, Mo., Mrs. Emerson C. Springer and Robert E. Johnson, Chicago, Ill., and Mrs. Ray C. McLain, Sioux City, Iowa; three grandchildren: Robert E. McLain, Barbara and Bruce Johnson; other relatives and hosts of friends. The memory of her radiant life will ever linger in the hearts of her friends, âLike the vase in which roses have once been distilled, you may break, you may shatter the vase if you will, But the scent of the Roses will cling round it still.\"\n\nThe deceased was well known in this community. She was highly respected and loved by everyone who had the pleasure of meeting her. During her life she was a devoted church worker, and the years she spent in Newman were no exception, for she was always found present at the church services when possible to attend.

JONES PASSES AWAY\n\nA Highly Respected Citizen of Allerton Died Saturday.-- Funeral Held at Pleasant Ridge M. E. Church, - Monday Morning.\n\nMr. John M. Jones who died at his home in Allerton, Ill., Saturday morning,(June 27, 1908) after a short illness, was for many years the resident of the Ridge. The deceased had through hard work and econonmical living amassed considerable wealth, his holding being largely in farm lands in the neighborhood of the Pleasant Ridge church where he resided many years before removing to Allerton. Mr. Jones was most certainly a splendid christian gentleman and in his death the community loses a splendid man. Some twenty-six years ago the editor of the INDEPENDENT worked for some time for Mr. Jones on the farm and learned to admire him, and his honest and fair dealings with his fellow man.\n\nFuneral services were held at the Pleasant Ridge M. E. church six miles north-east of Newman, Monday morning, the remains being attended to the church from Allerton by the I.O.O. F. lodge of that place of which organization the deceased was a cherished and beloved member. A large concourse of people gathered to pay their respect to the deceased and the sermon was preached by Rev. Pawson of Sidell, pastor of the Pleasant Ridge church assisted by Rev. Cusick, pastor of the M. E. church of Allerton.\n\nThe music on this occasion was a very beautiful and was rendered by Mrs. Pawson, Miss Cathcart, Mr. C. A. Watson and Rev. Pawson. The pall bearers were Gus Anderson, T. L. Miller, A. C. Thulberry, Marion Kincaid, Daniel Coryell and S. G. Stackhouse. The floral offerings were very beautiful. The following obituary was read at the funeral:\n\n\"John M. Jones was born in Adams County, Ohio Nov. 16, 1832, and died in his late residence in Allerton, Illinois, Saturday morning June 27, 1908 at 8:15 o'clock, with a complication of diseases, being 75 year, seven months, seventeen days old.\n\nHe was the son of Ephraim and Roxy Ann Jones, pioneers of southern Ohio. On May 8, 1861 he was united in marriage with Hannah Fields. To this union was born eleven children; eight surviving him, three having died in infancy. Those living are Mrs. Margaret Coffman, Noah, Mrs. Anna Thompson, Mrs. Bell Beatty, Robert, William, Charles, and Mrs. Mary Morry, all of whom were with him in his last illness. In 1870, Mr. Jones with his wife and five children came to Illinois, settling in the north-east corner of Douglas county. Here he raised his family and saw the raw prairie transformed to highly cultivated farms. At the age of 20 he was converted and united with a small congregation of the New Light church near Rome, Ohio. After coming to this state he transferred his membership to the Methodist Episcopal church at Pleasant Ridge at a time when it held services in a school house, and assisted in the erection of the present church building and has been associated with this society in almost every biblical capacity for the past 38 years. Although being so closely connected with this church of his adoption, he never lost his affection for the church of his youth where he was converted, and often spoke of it with the greatest regard and devotion.\n\nMr. Jones was a man who lived his religion at home-in his family. He had the joy and satisfaction of seeing all his children, converted and united with the church of his adoption. His constant prayer was that he might have that when the summons came, he would be ready and prepared to go. Only a few days before his last sickness he told one of his sons that his peace was made with GOD and that his prospects were bright for a home in heaven.\n\nIn the death of John M. Jones his family loses a kind and affectionate counselor, a devoted husband and father; the church loses an ardent and loyal supporter; and the community loses a patriot.

Their auto was struck by westbound passenger train No. 1; running about an hour late and in charge of Conductor Jones and Engineer Preston. Rail officials are at a loss for an explanation of the accident as the crossing is said to be a clear crossing and that the road parallels the railroad track on either side for some distance. The train was estimated to be traveling about forty miles an hour. The father and son were thrown out to one side but Mrs. Keal was carried on the pilot of the engine until the train came to a stop in about fifteen car lengths.\n\nBrought on to Decatur and rushed to the hospital in Moran's ambulance it was found Mr. Keal had a fractured skull. He died just a few minutes after reaching the hospital.\n\nMrs. Keal regained consciousness during the night and both she and the son seemed to be brighter Monday morning. She was thought to have a number of broken bones and had bruises and the son to have a broken leg but neither is believed to have injuries that will prove fatal. The family was returning to Tuscola from a visit in Champaign. The son said he did not know how the accident happened as his father was a careful driver. The boy was asleep when the crash came. Engineer Preston was pulling the train and Conductor Jones was in charge.

E. Church- Largely Attended - Interment at Pleasant Ridge\n\nNathan Hartley Kincaid was born in Marion county, West Virginia, May 11, 1846 and died at his home four miles north-east of Newman, January 11, 1916 aged sixty-nine years and eight months. His early years were spent on a farm in West Virginia with his parents. In 1865 the family came west and located on a farm near Chrisman, Illinois. After remaining there for three years the family took up a permanent residence on a farm north-east of Newman. Nathan being the eldest of the family of six sons and four daughters was forced to assume the responsibility of head of the family at the age of 21 owing to the sudden death of his father. Very little of the history of the many struggles and hardships of the Kincaid family and others in those early days of these undeveloped prairies will ever be written; but out of those struggles have emerged some of our most substantial citizens one of who is the subject of this sketch.\n\nHe was united in marriage to Mrs. Susan Roe King on September 6, 1889. To this union were born four children, Mrs. Ethel M. Roller, Jesse F., Ione B., and Faye M. Kincaid all of whom with their mother survive him. Besides his immediate family he is survived by one step-son Percy King and three brothers: James A., Simpson M., and Francis Marion all of whom live near Newman, Illinois. His death was due to a complication of diseases coupled with his advanced age and occurred on the forty-eight anniversary of the death of his father. To this cause may be attributed the fact that while he was a supporter of the church he was not enrolled among its active members. He was an ardent reader and believer in the Holy Scriptures and often quoted therefrom in his conversation. His kind disposition impressed all who knew him. In fact there are those who were associated with him for many years who cannot recall having seen him angry. He was an honest man in all that expression implies. He provided well for his family and was respected and loved by his neighbors and friends as the many kind words and deeds of sympathy from them will testify.\n\nHe was loath to leave his dear ones but resigned to God's will. His spirit released at last from its shattered temple after the almost \"three score years and ten\" has gone to God who gave it.\n\n[Newman Weekly Independent, Jan 11, 1916 - Submitted by Source #44]\n\nKINCAID, Ray\n\nRAY KINCAID 61, Dies on Thursday\n\nRay Kincaid, 61, died unexpectedly at 10:40 p.m. Thursday in his home north of Newman.

Mr. Larimer, a native of Indiana, had lived in Tuscola for the past 39 years and he was among the city's most worthy citizens. With a quiet, unassuming disposition, the deceased passed through life doing his part toward assisting his fellowman in making his daily tasks lighter and life more worth while. He was a kind, self-sacrificing and lenient husband and father. For many years, Mr. Larimer conducted an oil and gas distribution station in Tuscola. Mr. Larimer's parents were George Washington and Sarah Vina (Viney) Larimer of Miami, Ind., and on coming to Illinois the family located in Charleston, where the deceased resided until coming to this city in 1894. On February 25, 1880 he was united in marriage to Miss Isabelle Mitchell, who has since been his faithful companion. Ten children, five sons and five daughters were born to Mr. and Mrs. Larimer, seven of whom survive their father: Mrs. Maude Leonard, College Corner, Ohio; Mrs. Grace L. Bennett, Indianapolis, Mrs. Helen M. Davis, Detroit Mich.; Mrs. Dorothy Behnke, Durand, Mich.; George A., editor of The Review; Clyde M., county clerk; and Donald, all of this city.

She was stricken with a heart attack late Tuesday night and while she seemed to be recovering a relapse this morning quickly brought the end of a long and useful life. Mrs. Larimer had been a resident of Tuscola since 1894 and was one of our most highly respected and loved women. Aside from rearing her family of ten children she was an active worker in the Church of Christ and the activities of the church for many years.
