        "text": "In 2013, impressed by the number of book titles popping up in the books I was reading at the time, I began posting what I called Friday Book lists, in which I would list all the books, plays, periodicals, poems, short stories and other publications that appeared in the books I was reading. The endeavour fizzled out after a while when I took a break from rereading the Ngaio Marsh detective novels and began reading newer books that contained few, if any, mentions of books or reading. However, one thing I found fascinating about the exercise were all the fictional titles I came across.\n\nYears before, I had discovered the (now, alas, long defunct) Invisible Library website and had been intrigued by the titles contained therein. Other webmasters and bloggers have since then made their own versions of this library of fictional books (as has Wikipedia), and now I have joined that club. Below you will find the fictional books, short stories, poems and plays included in my Friday Book lists (I decided to omit any periodicals, newspapers and articles). I will add new entries whenever I come across them.\n\nMy aim is not to list as many fictional books as possible, but merely to collect the ones I discover between the pages of the books I read. I may, if I find myself looking for something to do, pick up, from other invisible libraries, titles gleaned from books I read before I started collecting titles, but that's it. If I haven't read the containing book, you will not find it here.\n\nNotes on the layout of the list:\n\nI only list by title in alphabetical order, because I think the title is generally the most important fact about a fictional book. I am working on a way to embed a sortable table for those who want to be able to see them by author or the book they appeared in.\n\nAn author's name with * after it (like so: Aubrey Mandrake*) means that there are more listed titles by the same author.\n\nA # in front of a title (like so: #Abberley‘s Curiosities of Chemistry) means that the book could possibly be real, but I could find no reference to it being so and am therefore giving it the benefit of the doubt.\n\nTitles that begin with an article are listed alphabetically, article first and not by the first non-article word. I realise that, since most of what I read is in English, the A and T entries are eventually going to become much bigger than the others, but I don't see it as a problem.\n\nIf no author is given, then no author was mentioned in the source.\n\nIf publication information is included in the source, it is also included here, for the sake of completeness.\n\nWhen the genre is stated, I will include that or make an educated guess, but sometimes it's so obvious that it isn't needed, e.g.with books like Modern Verse-Forms by Mr. Elkbottom.\n\nThe future newest entries will be coloured red.\n\nThe list:\n\nA\n\n#Abberley‘s Curiosities of Chemistry.
