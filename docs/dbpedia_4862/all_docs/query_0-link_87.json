        "text": "Charlie Chan in Paris is a typical entry in the series. Chan (Warner Oland) goes to Paris to investigate a bond forgery case only to get caught up in murders involving a killer posing as a crippled beggar. When Yvette Lamartine (Mary Brian), daughter of the head (Henry Kolker) of the firm issuing the bonds, become a suspect, the plot becomes more complicated. The highlights include an extremely violent Apache dance ending with the very cute Dorothy Appleby being tossed through a window and the way Chan handles a stranger (Erik Rhodes) who begins jabbering at him in pidgin English. The way the identity of the killer is revealed is rather clever. The film also features the first appearance of…\n\nThe best of Fox's many Charlie Chan films were the family affairs, those featuring one or more of the character's kids, and ideally those starring the original Chan, Warner Oland, opposite his \"Number One Son\" Lee, played by Keye Luke.\n\nThis, Luke's first appearance in the series, is a fairly standard, rather low-budget B-mystery about bond forgery and murder that's lent remarkable warmth and humanity by the touching, completely credible relationship between the wise Chinese detective and his Americanised son.\n\nTheir opening scene together, beginning with suspense, moving through the excitement of reunion, and ending with Luke vowing to protect his father from his would-be killer, is an absolute beauty.\n\nThere's also a fairly strong supporting cast, led by Fred…\n\nHad a real fun time with this one. Charlie Chan arrives in Paris to see a friend and right away we’re introduced to a very suspicious character named Xavier; a ex-veteran beggar who hobbles looking like a member of the Three Blind Mice. Charlie calls his friend from a phone booth and alludes to a very secretive topic that they need to discuss in person. From there, as always, we’re introduced to our key players (aka key suspects as the story unfolds).\n\nMy enjoyment of these films depends on a few things.\n\n1. Is it a worthwhile mystery?\n\n2. Are these interesting characters?\n\n3. Is Charlie Chan in most of the movie?\n\n4. Is Number One Son Lee going to…\n\nLewis Seiler’s mystery crime drama. The Chinese sleuth (Warner Oland) and his No. 1 son (Keye Luke) try to trap a trio of forgers working out of the sewers. With Mary Brian and Thomas Beck.\n\nAppointed to examine forged bonds, Charlie (Warner Oland) is stopped by the killing of his secret agent, but the entrance of his son Lee (Keye Luke) assists him find out who the actual criminals are.\n\nWarner Oland gives a good performance in his role as the title character Charlie Chan, the detective who is determined to find out who the culprits are, while Keye Luke is decent as Lee, Charlie’s no.1 son who helps him with the case.\n\nElsewhere, there are fine performances to be…\n\nIt's the mark of a good mystery that it was able to overcome my fixation with dancer Dorothy Appleby who does an incredibly violent Apache dance early on and then abruptly exits the picture - but somehow the movie recovers, partially no doubt due to the introduction of Keye Luke as number 1 son here for the first time, increasing the cast of actual Asian actors by 100%. And there is a great, uncomfortable scene in which Chan is confronted with a man in a social situation making wildly racist assumptions, speaking pidgin english, and acting like a fool. Chan keeps his composure and uses humor to defuse the situation. It is an extremely uncomfortable scene, and one I've seen…\n\nFilm #9 of Scavenger Hunt #77\n\nTask 8: Watch a movie with the name of a city in the title\n\nCharlie Chan heads to Paris to investigate forged bonds, and finds not only forgery but murder.\n\nThis is an entertaining short mystery in the Chan franchise. Solid performance from Oland, and first appearance from Keye Luke as Chan's eldest son Lee. While Lee can be a bit of a bumbling character in other films, he isn't here, and it's lovely when he arrives with the cops at the end, hoping to save his father from trouble. The rest of the cast do a decent job as well.\n\nIf the Chan films seem dated, and the depictions wouldn't hold water today,…\n\nCharlie Chan in Paris is a very solid outing in the series with a script written by Philip MacDonald who also did the excellent Charlie Chan in London. In fact, this film follows right on the heels of the London case as Chan has flown to Paris on another case - of forged bond notes. His contact is killed before Chan has a chance to meet. But Chan gets the able assistance of his son who was in Europe on business, which doesn't really jive with him in later films. He is played by the legendary Keye Luke in his first credited film and is a very welcome addition. It is a taut little mystery - partially taking place in…"
