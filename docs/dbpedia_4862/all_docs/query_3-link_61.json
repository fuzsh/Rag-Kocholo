There are no paragraphs in the original document, and the punctuation is sparse and irregular. The word 'demise' in 'give demise and dispose of' should be 'devise', but the word in the original is clearly 'demise'. Following the will is an inventory of \"the goods & chattels debts & credits of William Appleby, Deceased\". The inventory was signed by David McCurdy and John Appleby October 12, 1808. A more easily readable version of the will with paragraphs, copied from the Appleby Heritage Association website, follows the first version. The second version contains some errors.\n\nWilliam Appleby's Will: In the name of God amen the twenty third Day of November 1807 I William Appleby of the State of Tennessee & Williamson County being in a low state of health, but in perfect mind & memory thanks be given to God therefore calling to mind the mortality of my body & knowing that it is appointed for all men once to die, do make & ordain this my last Will & testament viz. principally & first of all I give & recommend my soul to God that gave it and my body I recommend to the earth, nothing doubting but at the general resurrection I shall receive the same again by the mighty power of God, and as touching such worldly estate wherewith it hath pleased God to bless me with in this life, I give demise & dispose of the same in the following manner & form Item first; that all my Just & lawful debts be discharged with my funeral expenses Item second; I give & bequeath to my well beloved and affectionate wife Agness my best bed & bed clothes & all her own apparel, likewise all the cloathing that is bought for her & not made up, one cow & calf, the young black mare & her choise of the two Womens saddles: Item 3rd I give & bequeath to my son John Appleby one hundred acres of land out of a five hundred acre survey which lies in Livingston County State of Kentucky to be equal to any in said survey; Item 4th I give and bequeath to my son James Appleby fifty Dollars in Cash to be paid within two years after the virtue of this Will be in force: Item 5th I give & bequeath to my son William Appleby one hundred acres of land out of the aforesaid Survey in Kentucky: Item 6th I give & bequeath to my son David Appleby my bay mare & my own saddle and his apparel: Item 7th I give & bequeath to my Daughter Elizabeth McCurdy three Dollars in Cash: Item 8th I give & bequeath to my Daughter Grissy McCurdy three Dollars in Cash: Item 9th I give & bequeath unto my Daughter Jean Little three Dollars in Cash Item 10th I give & bequeath to my sons David and Samuel Appleby all the remainder of my part of the aforementioned survey of land after taking two hundred acres before mentioned out of it, to be divided equally betwixt them or the Executors at their discretion to sell it & divide the price of it between them, Item 11th It is my will & desire that all the remainder of the Estate after what has been mentioned, be collected both real and personal and to be disposed of to the best advantage for the support & education of those of the family that are under age excepting my wearing apparel & the household furniture which I allow to be at the disposal of my wife Agness, and my books I allow to be divided among my children and if there is anything after schooling & raising the children & to divide it between my wife & her five children.

The subscribing witnesses thereto and to be the act of deed of William Appleby and the same was ordered to be recorded. Whereupon David McCurdy and John Appleby came into court and qualified as executors of (?) letters of testamony. [2]\n\nIrish or English?\n\nThe Appleby Heritage Association website states that William Appleby was born in Ireland according to family tradition. Apparently there is no documentary evidence about his birthplace. According to the 1850 census 'Appleby' can be an Irish name, although it is more likely to be English. In 1850 in all of the states there were 7 immigrants named Appleby from Ireland and 21 from England. In 1860 there were 12 from Ireland and 15 from England. On the other hand the surname of his first wife is clearly non-English. In 1860 there were 5 immigrants named McKeehan from Ireland, none from England, and 2 from Scotland.\n\nBirth\n\nMost researchers say that he was born in 1742, and they may be right, although they offer no evidence. However, in the membership lists of the Big Spring Presbyterian Church created about 1787-89 by Rev. Samuel Wilson, William Appleby, already married to his second wife, is 35 years old. If he was 35 in 1787, he was born about 1752. See notes under David McCurdy, Sr. for more details.\n\nOn the other hand if he was born in 1752 his wife was 10 years older than he was and he was no older than 18 when he married. Their first child was born about 1770.\n\nDeath\n\nWilliam Appleby died between 3 Nov 1807, when he signed his will, and July 1808, when it was proved.\n\nImmigrant\n\nThere are three known immigration listings for a William Appleby in the time frame of interest. One was an 18-year-old weaver that arrived in New York from Yorkshire in 1774. The second was a 32 year old that arrived in Virginia from England in 1635. The most probable was accompanied by two brothers, John (with wife) and Alexander. They arrived in Pennsylvania from Ireland before the American Revolution. This is listed in \"Immigrants to America Before 1750\" by Frederick A Virkus.\n\nSources\n\n↑ SAR https://sarpatriots.sar.org/patriot/display/104224\n\n↑ This Will copied as written, by Dorothy Appleby Turner in June 1986 from the record on file at the Courthouse, Franklin, Williamson County, Tennessee.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWikiTree profile Appleby-146 created through the import of DerrekPrestonWayneSteeleFamily.ged on Oct 14, 2011 by Preston Steele."
