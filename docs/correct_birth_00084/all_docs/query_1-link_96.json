        "text": "Laura Robson has not enjoyed the luck of the draw at Wimbledon so far. Last year she went out in the first round against the then world No5, Daniela Hantuchova. Today she lines up across the net from the fourth seed, Jelena Jankovic.\n\nWith only one win on the senior women's tour so far, and that at Birmingham this month, few anticipate anything more than a gutsy defeat as the 16-year-old makes her Centre Court debut. That lack of expectation, however, could work in Robson's favour according to her coach, Martijn Bok.\n\n\"Jankovic will be expected to win so she'll be free to just play,\" said Bok, who has worked with the Australian-born player for the past three years. \"And I think Jankovic's style might just suit Laura's.\"\n\nJankovic, whose solitary title this year came at Indian Wells in March, has not gone beyond the fourth round at SW19 and lost there in the third round to the then 17-year-old Melanie Oudin last year.\n\n\"It's a nice challenge; in my opinion, it's good she has Jankovic,\" Bok said. \"Laura definitely has it in her to beat the very best players. She's a power player. She likes to play big. But, having said that, she also has a loose wrist, which provides good variety to her game.\"\n\nHaving won the girls' title two years ago at 14, Robson has attracted interest since whenever she plays. Inevitably, given that hers will be the second game on Centre Court after Roger Federer opens proceedings today, the attention will be even greater, leaving Bok to ensure it does not affect her game.\n\n\"I tell her to keep it simple. That's always going to be her best chance to win. It's a very special occasion for her. Maybe she has more adrenaline than normal going into this tournament but we'll treat it like any other.\"\n\nNonetheless Wimbledon has loomed large in their plans for the year as Robson combines playing on the senior and junior tours. She missed the juniors at Roland Garros because she wanted more time to prepare on grass and her desire for success will see her play in three senior events at Wimbledon, joining Sally Peers in the women's doubles and Jamie Murray, who won the 2007 title with Jankovic, in the mixed.\n\nIn defeat by Hantuchova last year Robson took a set off the Slovakian and was a break up in the second before succumbing, coming off court saying she would learn from the experience. Bok's confidence stems from her ability to absorb lessons and improve.\n\n\"She's gotten smarter all round,\" said the 37-year-old Dutchman, \"as a person and as a player. She's maturer and obviously her game has improved. She's a lot stronger. It's about tactical things too. Now, if Plan A fails, she has Plan B and even C to fall back on.\"\n\nRobson has had to be mentally strong off court in the past month, generating unwanted headlines for comments in a magazine interview in which she described some other players on the women's tour as \"sluts\" for the way they chase after men. She subsequently apologised.\n\nHer fondness for displaying self-deprecating humour on Twitter, however, is more reminiscent of the teenager Bok is familiar with. \"She's very funny and relaxed,\" he said. \"In fact, we have to work on her intensity sometimes.\"\n\nThat work may not pay off immediately on Centre Court today but the signs are promising that one day the rewards will come."
