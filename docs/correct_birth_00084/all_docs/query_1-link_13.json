        "text": "Horoscope and chart of Jelena Jankovic (Placidus system)\n\n* A planet less than 1° from the next House cusp is considered to be posited in the said House. 2° when the AS and the MC are involved\n\nAstrological portrait of Jelena Jankovic (excerpt)\n\nDisclaimer: these short excerpts of astrological charts are computer processed. They are, by no means, of a personal nature. This principle is valid for the 68,163 celebrities included in our database. These texts provide the meanings of planets, or combination of planets, in signs and in houses, as well as the interpretations of planetary dominants in line with modern Western astrology rules. Moreover, since Astrotheme is not a polemic website, no negative aspect which may damage the good reputation of a celebrity is posted here, unlike in the comprehensive astrological portrait.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHere are some character traits from Jelena Jankovic's birth chart. This description is far from being comprehensive but it can shed light on his/her personality, which is still interesting for professional astrologers or astrology lovers.\n\nIn a matter of minutes, you can get at your email address your astrological portrait (approximately 32 pages), a much more comprehensive report than this portrait of Jelena Jankovic.\n\nThe dominant planets of Jelena Jankovic\n\nWhen interpreting a natal chart, the best method is to start gradually from general features to specific ones. Thus, there is usually a plan to be followed, from the overall analysis of the chart and its structure, to the description of its different character traits.\n\nIn the first part, an overall analysis of the chart enables us to figure out the personality's main features and to emphasize several points that are confirmed or not in the detailed analysis: in any case, those general traits are taken into account. Human personality is an infinitely intricate entity and describing it is a complex task. Claiming to rapidly summarize it is illusory, although it does not mean that it is an impossible challenge. It is essential to read a natal chart several times in order to absorb all its different meanings and to grasp all this complexity. But the exercise is worthwhile.\n\nIn brief, a natal chart is composed of ten planets: two luminaries, the Sun and the Moon, three fast-moving or individual planets, Mercury, Venus and Mars, two slow-moving planets, Jupiter and Saturn, and three very slow-moving planets, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. Additional secondary elements are: the Lunar Nodes, the Dark Moon or Lilith, Chiron and other minor objects. They are all posited on the Zodiac wheel consisting of twelve signs, from Aries to Pisces, and divided into twelve astrological houses.\n\nThe first step is to evaluate the importance of each planet. This is what we call identifying the dominant planets. This process obeys rules that depend on the astrologer's sensitivity and experience but it also has precise and steady bases: thus, we can take into account the parameters of a planet's activity (the number of active aspects a planet forms, the importance of each aspect according to its nature and its exactness), angularity parameters; (proximity to the four angles, Ascendant, Midheaven, Descendant and Imum Coeli or Nadir, all of them being evaluated numerically, according to the kind of angle and the planet-angle distance) and quality parameters (rulership, exaltation, exile and fall). Finally, other criteria such as the rulership of the Ascendant and the Midheaven etc. are important.\n\nThese different criteria allow a planet to be highlighted and lead to useful conclusions when interpreting the chart.\n\nThe overall chart analysis begins with the observation of three sorts of planetary distributions in the chart: Eastern or Western hemisphere, Northern or Southern hemisphere, and quadrants (North-eastern, North-western, South-eastern and South-western). These three distributions give a general tone in terms of introversion and extraversion, willpower, sociability, and behavioural predispositions.\n\nThen, there are three additional distributions: elements (called triplicity since there are three groups of signs for each one) - Fire, Air, Earth and Water - corresponding to a character typology, modality (or quadruplicity with four groups of signs for each one) - Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable - and polarity (Yin and Yang).\n\nThere are three types of dominants: dominant planets, dominant signs and dominant houses. The novice thinks astrology means only \"to be Aries\" or sometimes, for example, \"to be Aries Ascendant Virgo\". It is actually far more complex. Although the Sun and the Ascendant alone may reveal a large part of the character - approximately a third or a half of your psychological signature, a person is neither \"just the Sun\" (called the sign) nor just \"the first house\" (the Ascendant). Thus, a particular planet's influence may be significantly increased; a particular sign or house may contain a group of planets that will bring nuances and sometimes weaken the role of the Ascendant, of the Sun sign etc.\n\nLastly, there are two other criteria: accentuations (angular, succedent and cadent) which are a classification of astrological houses and types of decanates that are occupied (each sign is divided into three decanates of ten degrees each). They provide some additional informations.\n\nThese general character traits must not be taken literally; they are, somehow, preparing for the chart reading. They allow to understand the second part of the analysis, which is more detailed and precise. It focuses on every area of the personality and provides a synthesis of all the above-mentioned parameters according to sound hierarchical rules.\n\nAstrological Quadrants for Jelena Jankovic\n\nEach quadrant is a combination of the four hemispheres of your birth chart and relates to a character typology. The Southern hemisphere  the top of your chart, around the Midheaven  is associated with extraversion, action, and public life, whereas the Northern hemisphere prompts to introversion, reflexion, and private life. The Eastern hemisphere  the left part, around the Ascendant  is linked to your ego and your willpower, whereas the Western hemisphere indicates how other people influence you, and how flexible you are when you make a decision.\n\nJelena Jankovic, the diurnal South-eastern quadrant, consisting of the 10th, 11th and 12th houses, prevails in your chart: assertion and goals achievement are at the centre of your concerns. You are very keen to implement your dreams and your plans. You achieve your ambitions as soon as possible, whether through an active social life, highly charged friendly relations, or an urge to take actions in order to reap - in the eyes of the world, of course - the rewards of your dynamism. It is likely that spirituality or humanitarian actions are part of your motivations, sometimes at the price of some degree of isolation.\n\nElements, Modes and House Accentuations for Jelena Jankovic\n\nJelena Jankovic, here are the graphs of your Elements and Modes, based on planets' position and angles in the twelve signs:\n\nCheers for communication and mobility, Jelena Jankovic! The predominance of Air signs in your chart favours and amplifies your taste for relations and for all kinds of short trips, whether real (travels) or symbolic (new ideas, mind speculations). You gain in flexibility and adaptability what you lose in self-assertion or in pragmatism.\n\nThe predominance of Water signs indicates high sensitivity and elevation through feelings, Jelena Jankovic. Your heart and your emotions are your driving forces, and you can't do anything on Earth if you don't feel a strong affective charge (as a matter of fact, the word \"feeling\" is essential in your psychology). You need to love in order to understand, and to feel in order to take action, to the detriment of a certain vulnerability against which you should learn to fight.\n\nEarth qualities are under-represented in your chart, with only 6.88% instead of the average 25%. Deficiency in Earth may indicate that you have no interest in material and concrete values. It is likely that you live too much in your heart or in your mind, or even in your enthusiasm! The fact remains that you may end up in tricky situations, due to your lack of good sense or forethought: material life is unavoidable even if you are rather idealistic, dreamy, or easily content. You must tackle concrete life necessities, for fear of... being forced to cope with them, later, in much more unpleasant ways!\n\nThe twelve zodiacal signs are split up into three groups or modes, called quadruplicities, a learned word meaning only that these three groups include four signs. The Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable modes are more or less represented in your natal chart, depending on planets' positions and importance, and on angles in the twelve signs.\n\nThe Mutable mode is the most emphasized one in your natal chart, Jelena Jankovic, which indicates a mobile character that is curious and thirsty for new experiences and evolution. You are lively and flexible, and you like to react quickly to solicitations, but don't confuse mobility with agitation, since this is the danger with this configuration - and with you, stagnation is out of the question. Security doesn't matter as long as you are not bored. You optimize, you change things, you change yourself... all this in a speedy way.\n\nHouses are split up into three groups: angular, succedent and cadent.\n\nThe first ones are the most important ones, the most \"noticeable\" and energetic houses. They are the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses. Their cuspides correspond to four famous angles: Ascendant for the 1st house, Imum Coeli for the 4th house, Descendant, opposite the Ascendant, for the 7th house and Midheaven for the 10th house, opposite the Imum Coeli.\n\nPlanets are evaluated according to a whole set of criteria that includes comprehensive Western astrology rules. At their turn, planets emphasize specific types of houses, signs, repartitions etc., as previously explained.\n\nCadent houses, namely the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses, are very emphasized in your chart, Jelena Jankovic. They indicate important potential for communication, adaptability and flexibility. These houses are symbolically linked to the mind and intellect. The relative weakness implied by these characteristics indicates your tendency to hesitate or to be indecisive, but also your remarkable ability to start off again, which is a nice quality, finally: you can easily get yourself out of a tight spot thanks to your mobility and casualness, in the best sense of the term. This group of houses corresponds to evolutionary characteristics of your personality. However, they are only indications and you must include them in the rest of your chart in order to see whether they are validated or not!\n\nN.B.: this dominant is a minor one.\n\nDominants: Planets, Signs and Houses for Jelena Jankovic\n\nThe issue of dominant planets has existed since the mists of time in astrology: how nice it would be if a person could be described with a few words and one or several planets that would represent their character, without having to analyse such elements as rulerships, angularities, houses, etc!\n\nThe ten planets - the Sun throughout Pluto - are a bit like ten characters in a role-play, each one has its own personality, its own way of acting, its own strengths and weaknesses. They actually represent a classification into ten distinct personalities, and astrologers have always tried to associate one or several dominant planets to a natal chart as well as dominant signs and houses.\n\nIndeed, it is quite the same situation with signs and houses. If planets symbolize characters, signs represent hues - the mental, emotional and physical structures of an individual. The sign in which a planet is posited is like a character whose features are modified according to the place where he lives. In a chart, there are usually one, two or three highlighted signs that allow to rapidly describe its owner.\n\nRegarding astrological houses, the principle is even simpler: the twelve houses correspond to twelve fields of life, and planets tenanting any given house increase that house's importance and highlight all relevant life departments: it may be marriage, work, friendship etc.\n\nIn your natal chart, Jelena Jankovic, the ten main planets are distributed as follows:\n\nThe three most important planets in your chart are Uranus, Neptune and Mars.\n\nUranus among your dominant planets: just like Neptune and Pluto, Uranian typology is less clearly defined than the so-called classical seven planets that are visible to the naked eye, from the Sun to Saturn. However, it is possible to associate your Uranian nature with a few clear characteristics: Uranus rhymes with independence, freedom, originality, or even rebelliousness and marginality, when things go wrong...\n\nUranus is Mercury's higher octave and as such, he borrows some of its traits of character; namely, a tendency to intellectualize situations and emotions with affective detachment, or at least jagged affectivity.\n\nTherefore, you are certainly a passionate woman who is on the lookout for any kind of action or revolutionary idea, and you are keen on new things. Uranians are never predictable, and it is especially when they are believed to be stable and well settled that... they change everything - their life, partner, and job! In fact, you are allergic to any kind of routine, although avoiding it must give way to many risks.\n\nWith Neptune as one of your three dominant planets, you are a secretive and ambiguous person, often confused or unclear about your own motivations! Indeed, you are endowed with unlimited imagination and inspiration, as well as with an extreme sensibility that may turn you into a psychic or a clairvoyant. On the other hand, your impressionability is such that you may have difficulties in separating what is concrete and solid from illusions or dreams.\n\nA mystic, a visionary or a poetess, you daydream, like any Neptunian, and you see what few people only can see, all of this being shrouded in aesthetic mists when you are fired with enthusiasm.\n\nA boundless, infinity-loving woman like you is inevitably likely to be more vulnerable and easily hurt because of your acute perception of events. In such cases, you are hit full in the face, and you may sink into gloomy daydreamings and dark melancholy.\n\nThat said, this mysterious aura definitely gives you an indefinable charm in the eyes of your close friends who are often fascinated by your unique ability to feel and to see what ordinary people can never see!\n\nMars is one of your dominant planets and provides you with its efficient energy and enthusiasm: with a powerful Mars in your chart, action - but also will and ability to undertake - is not an empty word for you. You are active, dynamic, willing to fight, courageous, and you are never afraid to move mountains, even though risks are part of the adventures that you start with determination.\n\nHowever, your patience is not always up to your boldness and a kind of feverishness, or even anger, can tarnish the quality of your achievements. That would be a pity since the Marsian is a champion in matters of efficiency! Mars symbolizes display of action, conquering spirit that favours discipline and order - beware of not being fussy - and lies at the frontier between action and brutality, between conquest and potential aggressiveness.\n\nIn your natal chart, the three most important signs - according to criteria mentioned above - are in decreasing order of strength Gemini, Pisces and Aries. In general, these signs are important because your Ascendant or your Sun is located there. But this is not always the case: there may be a cluster of planets, or a planet may be near an angle other than the Midheaven or Ascendant. It may also be because two or three planets are considered to be very active because they form numerous aspects from these signs.\n\nThus, you display some of the three signs' characteristics, a bit like a superposition of features on the rest of your chart, and it is all the more so if the sign is emphasized.\n\nWith Gemini as a dominant sign, your qualities include being lively, curious, mobile, clever, and flexible: you often make others dizzy, and you may come across as a dilettante - a bit inquisitive, shallow, and insensitive because you may be too intellectualizing. However, your natural curiosity, a nice quality, and your quick humour, allow you to demonstrate to everyone how much they may gain from your company, and that your apparent flightiness hides an appetite (particularly mental) for life, which itself conceals a terrific charm!\n\nPisces is among your dominant signs and endows your personality with unlimited sources of emotions, dreams, imagination, and sensitivity, to the extent that you literally swim in a cloudy ocean of delightful impressions. These impressions are so intense and overwhelming that you don't really need to take action concretely, to show your dynamism or your willpower, since you already live so intensely with your feelings - you are as keen as a radar, always on the alert! That is why some people may not like your carelessness, and the lack of clarity in your opinions or actions; however they quickly notice your artistic talents, your poetic or artistic side, and your total lack of wickedness. Besides, you feel compassion for people in pain - empathy is one of your great qualities. Thanks to your flexibility, your intuition, and your generosity, you may spend an important part of your life helping others. And if you are creative or if you have well-known artistic talents, everybody will forgive your little flaws: absent-mindedness, lack of energy or of will, too dreamy temperament...\n\nArian blood runs through your veins! You have that enthusiasm, frankness, courage, and fastness which usually make you so likeable in spite of your somewhat rough, naive, or violent side. As a bonus, Aries' gushing fire always gives you the impetus to make a fresh start, should you stumble or undergo life hardship!\n\nThe 10th, 11th and 6th houses are the most prominent ones in your birth chart. From the analysis of the most tenanted houses, the astrologer identifies your most significant fields or spheres of activity. They deal with what you are experiencing - or what you will be brought to experience one day - or they deal with your inner motivations.\n\nWith a prominent 10th house, your destiny's achievement may be very notable: the 10th house represents your career, your public life, and your ambitions. A good deal of your energy may thus be used to successfully implement what you have in mind. Instinctively, you are very keen to make your dreams come true. Sooner or later, you will deal with the public, and your personal achievement will go through trials and ordeals: other people and visible actions.\n\nThe 11th house is among your dominant houses. Therefore, social life and/or friendships are very important, even strategic to you.\n\nYou think that group activities, whether in the humanitarian field or simple gatherings of friends, are endless sources of inspiration and of enjoyment, provided that there are no tensed aspects in this sector. Everything human is important to you, often more important than your own success, unless your 10th house is also powerful.\n\nYour 6th house is quite emphasized and indicates interest in work and daily occupations that take up a lot of your time: in analogy with Virgo, this house inclines towards perfectionism and training; somehow, you may be fulfilled through the process of being useful and investing your energy in your work. An environment appealing to you may be involved - your colleagues, for example - or a passion for one of these daily occupations. Medical positions or pets may play a role in your life; or ancillary love affairs too... These are a few possibilities indicated by an important 6th house.\n\nAfter this paragraph about dominant planets, of Jelena Jankovic, here are the character traits that you must read more carefully than the previous texts since they are very specific: the texts about dominant planets only give background information about the personality and remain quite general: they emphasize or, on the contrary, mitigate different particularities or facets of a personality. A human being is a complex whole and only bodies of texts can attempt to successfully figure out all the finer points.\n\nThe Moon in Gemini and in House 12: her sensitivity\n\nJelena Jankovic, you tend to hold emotions at bay, as if they were dangerous. You observe with curiosity what is occurring and you strive to objectively, logically and impersonally analyze facts in order to form correct judgments. Contacts and communication are very important to you, Jelena Jankovic, you make use of, even over-use, words, with deep humour because it is an additional way for you to be detached from your feelings. You may come across as superficial because you keep on talking without committing yourself. You need to be constantly on the move, to discover and to communicate in order to avoid boredom. When you are alone, you can spend lots of time with books to nourish your mind that is so avid for knowledge. However, be careful not to miss feelings because you favour intellectual sensations...\n\nJelena Jankovic, you find it hard to show what you feel, or you simply consider that it belongs to you and must not be exposed. Anyway, even if your emotions are rich and deep, you keep them inside and you don't wear your heart on your sleeve... (excerpt)\n\nMercury in Pisces and in House 10: her intellect and social life\n\nYour thinking process works on a rather instinctive and intuitive mode, Jelena Jankovic. You feel more than you understand, as if your reasoning were not active. Your strong receptivity and your natural empathy make you an understanding, pleasant, warm and benevolent person although you may be neglectful, even heedless. You are shy and anxious and you prefer to withdraw and to isolate yourself in a quiet place in order to give free rein to your inspiration, rather than to assert yourself. Despite your lively imagination, it may be hard for you to get out of the flow of your mystical and irrational thoughts, with the result that you become even more worried and impressionable. You must develop your logic, rational mind and your willpower, so as to gain self-confidence and creativity. Try and see...\n\nYour lively and conciliating mind is at the service of your career, Jelena Jankovic. Your natural mobility enables you to constantly adjust and to get the positions you want. Your professional achievement is often the result of your ability to understand that the key to success is... (excerpt)\n\nVenus in Aries and in House 11, and the Sun in Pisces: her affectivity and seductiveness\n\nIn your chart, the Sun is in Pisces and Venus, in Aries. The spring and ingenuous fieriness of Venus in Aries resists the lucid scepticism of the Sun in Pisces. All emotions make sense and they immediately stimulate the natural enthusiasm of your Venusian sign. However, whatever your senses and affectivity stir up, it cannot quench the solar signs thirst for the absolute. The contrast is obvious: on the one hand, the ability to believe in the I love you of the moment and on the other hand, the subtlety of the affective models which cannot be satisfied with a fleeting excitement or a transient love. These contradictions bring about complications into your love life, but they are also part of the richness and the charm of the configuration. As long as you manage to reconcile detachment (Pisces) with involvement (Aries), subtlety with animality, candour with distance, you are able to cope with any eventuality, alternately shifting from enchantment to lucidity A thorny programme, a challenge up to your solar signs ambitions and to your Venusian signs thirst for novelty. Beyond your contradictions, from beginning (Aries) to end (Pisces), love is a process of constant renewal.\n\nLove at first sight, flash in the pan, amorous impulsiveness? All these are part of your way of loving or to fall in love, Jelena Jankovic. Throughout your relationship, you maintain this kind of jerky and lively style, that may seem childish or naïve, but that is so generous and cheerful! You are undeniably possessive and you are not concerned with your partner's opinion but, fortunately, you readily forgive because of your spontaneity and your authenticity. When your relationship is intense, everything is fine. There is no romanticism, no complications with you. You love with ardour and, except for a few crazes and opportunities for new pastures here and there, the only danger may be that boredom settles in. In that case, you leave without regret and you quickly forget what consumed you, not so long ago.\n\nIn general, your sociability is impressive, Jelena Jankovic, and this powerful feature of your personality leads you to tread with ease between love and friendship, with your close entourage having some difficulties in discriminating, because you are so welcoming and charming. You are prone to obtain great... (excerpt)\n\nThe Ascendant is in Gemini and the ruler of the Ascendant is Mercury, in Pisces: her behaviour\n\nYour mobility is such that you are in every place where you are not expected. You spend lots of time asking questions and answering them. Your curiosity and your quick-wittedness are insatiable. Your mind is in constant turmoil, hopping from one topic to another, solving problems, accumulating anecdotes and knowledge within a short range of time. Your mobility is mostly mental, it takes you afar and turns your daily life into a mosaic of intense and pleasant moments that are not necessarily related to one another\n\nAs you are born under this sign, you are nervous, expressive, lively and adaptable, with a quick mind and a good sense of humour. You are bubbling, playful, sociable, clever, curious, whimsical, independent, intellectual, flexible, ingenious, fanciful, imaginative, charming, cerebral, and you are into everything. You may also be whimsical, unfocused, quirky, superficial, indiscreet, opportunist, unmindful, selfish, sarcastic or mercurial.\n\nIn love, Madam, you are full of intelligence and liveliness. You are so subtle, so whimsical, that you could be seen as a teaser because you can seduce in any situation. The more complex they are, the more numerous the contacts, the better.\n\nAmong all the Zodiacal signs, you are the outstanding one who can manage several simultaneous love affairs. It is not a matter of vice, but only of voluptuous pleasure of the instant. If they do not take place at the same time, your amorous encounters may be short-lived. But their number is very considerable because you constantly want to keep boredom and monotony at bay and you frantically run away from any source of peace and calm.\n\nYou will probably marry more than once. For you, the Sun symbolizes first the father then the husband: Gemini being a double sign, and your father being unique, it is likely that you will have two or more husbands. However, this is not a fatality and the rest of your chart can easily tell you more.\n\nThe ruler of the Ascendant, also referred to as the chart ruler, brings a few interesting nuances to the meanings provided by the Sun and the Ascendant. The sign in which the ruler of the Ascendant is posited fine-tunes the style of personality described by the Sun and the Ascendant. It may strengthen it if the sign is identical to either of them.\n\nThe ruler of your Ascendant is in the same sign as your Sun. This specific feature means that the Sun's characteristics in sign previously delineated are strengthened.\n\nThe Sun in Pisces and in House 10: her will and inner motivations\n\nPsychologically speaking, your nature is adaptable and receptive, exactly the opposite of the sign of Virgo whose very essence is to analyze every detail, thus creating a definite duality between the self and the outside world: conversely, Pisces absorbs and erases all forms of differentiation they face. With Pisces, there is no opposition, no conflict and no individual reaction. There is only fusion, non-separation, a perpetual and mobile spreading of the self over some blurred and huge sensation of sympathy with the environment. It is the absolute reign of feelings and emotions over the intellect and its separative logics.\n\nAs you are born under this sign, you are emotional, sensitive, dedicated, adaptable, nice, wild, compassionate, romantic, imaginative, flexible, opportunist, intuitive, impossible to categorized, irrational, seductive, placid, secretive, introverted, pleasant, artistic, and charming. But you may also be indecisive, moody, passive, confused, wavering, lazy, scatterbrained, vulnerable, unpredictable and gullible.\n\nMadam, you are the great lover of the Zodiac. You are mysterious and romantic, with an incredible charm, incomparable sentimentality and unbelievable attractiveness. Your vulnerability and your passive child-like side are part of your natural seducing assets. The child-like woman or the femme fatale appears and disappears, in turn, according to your moods and to circumstances.\n\nYou are mobile, changeable but always noble. You move from excited encounters to delusions or to moments of despondency. You are driven by one sole constant motive: to listen to your feelings and your intuition, to use any given concrete situation as a basis for an imaginary realm full of fabulous and chimerical possibilities, where you are the adulated and worshipped star.\n\nIn your couple, you display the most total devotion. You offer your energy and your destiny to the man you love. You sacrifice yourself, as you sacrifice a whole lot of potentialities or opportunities, without remorse and with enthusiasm, so as to feel the chords of your perfect union vibrate more deeply and to raise your ideal of fusion and unlimited love to higher stages.\n\nYou are deeply in love, very intuitive and sensitive. Because of the dual nature of the sign of Pisces, it is likely that in the second part of your life, you will marry once more, unless you choose to have a simultaneous relationship, more or less hidden.\n\nJelena Jankovic, your need for assertion is very strong. It is clearly oriented towards the success of your professional or social destiny, or at least, towards an important rise compared to your initial background; your effort, your will and your goals are well defined in your mind:... (excerpt)\n\nMars in Aries and in House 11: her ability to take action\n\nImpulsive, impatient, quick and energetic? You? Yes of course, Jelena Jankovic. You are courageous and able to make intense and huge efforts for a short while; and what a terrific rhythm! In sport, of course, or in your sexuality, you are not the type who ponders, you take action instinctively, in a rough and ready way. You are outspoken, you do not worry about other people's opinion and you do not allow them to slow you down or to judge you. You must succeed or fall apart. You cannot be bothered with diplomacy or with compromises. You are too straightforward and unyielding to waste time with finesse or shrewdness. This is what makes you charming because, with you, one always knows where one stands.\n\nIt is in the area of friendship and collective life (common projects, associations, etc.) that you express your impulsivity, you warmth, and your capacity for action, Jelena Jankovic. You are cut-and-dried and your motto is \"either succeed or die\". In case of success, it is your responsibility to... (excerpt)\n\nConclusion\n\nThis text is only an excerpt from of Jelena Jankovic's portrait. If you want to get your own astrological portrait, much more comprehensive that this present excerpt, you can order it at this page. Do you belong to the Jupiterian type, benevolent and generous? The Martian type, active and a go-getter? The Venusian type, charming and seductive? The Lunar type, imaginative and sensitive? The Solar type, noble and charismatic? The Uranian type, original, uncompromising and a freedom-lover? The Plutonian type, domineering and secretive? The Mercurian type, cerebral, inquiring and quick? The Neptunian type, visionary, capable of empathy and impressionable? The Saturnian type, profound, persevering and responsible? Are you more of the Fire type, energetic and intuitive? The Water type, sentimental and receptive? The Earth type, realistic and efficient? Or the Air type, gifted in communication and highly intellectual? 11 planetary dominants and 57 characteristics are reviewed, quantified, and interpreted; then, your psychological portrait is described in detail, in a comprehensive document of approximately 32-36 pages, full of engrossing and original pieces of information about yourself.\n\nAstrological reports describe many of the character traits and they sometimes go deeper into the understanding of a personality. Please, always keep in mind that human beings are continuously evolving and that many parts of our psychological structures are likely to be expressed later, after having undergone significant life's experiences. It is advised to read a portrait with hindsight in order to appreciate its astrological content. Under this condition, you will be able to take full advantage of this type of study.\n\nThe analysis of an astrological portrait consists in understanding four types of elements which interact with one another: ten planets, twelve zodiacal signs, twelve houses, and what are called aspects between planets (the 11 aspects most commonly used are: conjunction, opposition, square, trine, sextile, quincunx, semi-sextile, sesqui-quadrate, quintile and bi-quintile. The first 5 aspects enumerated are called major aspects).\n\nPlanets represent typologies of our human psychology: sensitivity, affectivity, ability to undertake, will-power, mental process, aptitude, and taste for communication etc., all independent character facets are divided here for practical reasons. The twelve signs forming the space where planets move will \"colour\", so to speak, these typologies with each planet being located in its particular sign. They will then enrich the quality of these typologies, as expressed by the planets. The Zodiac is also divided into twelve astrological houses. This makes sense only if the birth time is known because within a few minutes, the twelve houses (including the 1st one, the Ascendant) change significantly. They correspond to twelve specific spheres of life: external behaviour, material, social and family life, relationship, home, love life, daily work, partnership, etc. Each planet located in any given house will then act according to the meaning of its house, and a second colouration again enriches those active forces that the planets symbolize. Finally, relations will settle among planets, creating a third structure, which completes the planets' basic meanings. A set of ancient rules, which has stood the test of experience over hundreds of years (although astrology is in evolution, only reliable elements are integrated into classical studies), are applied to organize the whole chart into a hierarchy and to allow your personality to be interpreted by texts. The planets usually analysed are the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, which means two luminaries (the Sun and the Moon) and 8 planets, a total of 10 planets. Additional secondary elements may be taken into account, such as asteroids Chiron, Vesta, Pallas, Ceres (especially Chiron, more well-known), the Lunar nodes, the Dark Moon or Lilith, and even other bodies: astrology is a discipline on the move. Astrological studies, including astrological portrait, compatibility of couples, predictive work, and horoscopes evolve and become more accurate or deeper, as time goes by.\n\nPrecision: concerning the horoscopes with a known time of birth, according to the Tradition, we consider that a planet near the beginning (called cuspide) of the next house (less than 2 degrees for the Ascendant and the Midheaven, and less than 1 degree for all other houses) belongs to this house: our texts and dominants take this rule into account. You can also choose not to take this shift into account in the form, and also tick the option Koch or Equal houses system instead of Placidus, the default houses system.\n\nWarning: In order to avoid any confusion and any possible controversy, we want to draw your attention upon the fact that this sample of celebrities is very complete and therefore, it also includes undesirable people, since every category is represented: beside artists, musicians, politicians, lawyers, professional soldiers, poets, writers, singers, explorers, scientists, academics, religious figures, saints, philosophers, sages, astrologers, mediums, sportsmen, chess champions, famous victims, historical characters, members of royal families, models, painters, sculptors, and comics authors or other actual celebrities, there are also famous murderers, tyrants and dictators, serial-killers, or other characters whose image is very negative, often rightly so.\n\nRegarding the latter, it must be remembered that even a monster or at least a person who perpetrated odious crimes, has some human qualities, often noticed by his/her close entourage: these excerpts come from computer programmes devoid of polemical intentions and may seem too soft or lenient. The positive side of each personality is deliberately stressed. Negative sides have been erased here - it is not the same in our comprehensive reports on sale - because it could hurt the families of such people. We are hoping that it will not rebound on the victims' side.\n\nNumerology: Birth Path of Jelena Jankovic\n\nTestimonies to numerology are found in the most ancient civilizations and show that numerology pre-dates astrology. This discipline considers the name, the surname, and the date of birth, and ascribes a meaning to alphabetic letters according to the numbers which symbolise them.\n\nThe path of life, based on the date of birth, provides indications on the kind of destiny which one is meant to experience. It is one of the elements that must reckoned with, along with the expression number, the active number, the intimacy number, the achievement number, the hereditary number, the dominant numbers or the lacking numbers, or also the area of expression, etc.\n\nYour Life Path is influenced by the number 8, Jelena, which indicates that your destiny hinges on financial successes, material undertakings, and power seizing. It is a path full of successes and failures, fortune and reversals of fortune. You must strive to control your thirst for material goods, and try to practice tolerance. Great achievements are possible if you choose a career in any sort of trade or business. This is how your qualities are likely to be best expressed: management abilities and above-average commercial sense. Traditionally, the number 8 is believed to favour material and financial matters such as asset management, investments, commercial negotiations, as well as social power. All these elements are most likely to be found at the centre of your life. Your thirst for power, added to some degree of bad luck, constitutes one of the major hurdles blocking your way. However, your determination, added to a deep spirit of conciliation, turns the number 8 into a very fulfilling one, that of extraordinary successes.\n\nJelena Jankovic was born under the sign of the Ox, element Wood\n\nChinese astrology is brought to us as a legacy of age-old wisdom and invites us to develop an awareness of our inner potential. It is believed that the wise man is not subjected to stellar influences. However, we must gain the lucidity and the distance without which we remain locked up in an implacable destiny. According to the legend of the Circle of Animals, Buddha summoned all the animals to bid them farewell before he left our world. Only twelve species answered Buddha's call. They form the Chinese Zodiac and symbolize the twelve paths of wisdom that are still valid nowadays.\n\nThe Asian wise man considers that a path is neither good nor bad. One can and must develop one's potentialities. The first step is to thoroughly know oneself.\n\nYour Chinese sign is the Ox, also known as the Buffalo in some countries. You are not very influenced by prevailing fashions and trends. You are resistant and you avoid society life like the plague because you consider it a waste of time. You prefer to keep your distance and take action alone.\n\nIn many circumstances you display an extraordinary self-control. You are very trustworthy and, more than anyone, you elicit confidences from your entourage. Your sense of responsibilities allows you to avoid faux pas that others make out of insouciance.\n\nYou stick to your principles, your loves and your projects. Your behaviour is rigorous and fierce, and you do not let anything slip out of your hands without fighting. Besides, you cannot stand failures and in that case, you show a perseverance that borders on obstinacy. Therefore, tenacity may turn into stubbornness and extremism. It doesn't matter! Your courage and stamina are unanimously praised.\n\nHowever, your patience has its limits... Thus, it is dangerous to spark off your wrath, which is known to be rare but particularly dreadful. You remember the attacks you have been subjected to and you wait for the right time to express methodically your grudges.\n\nYour determined and individualistic character prevails, with an inner strength that overcomes a good many obstacles. You are responsible, reliable and loyal to your friends. You will fully express yourself when you are handed over the reins of power. Whoever attempts to stand in your way is in trouble!\n\nChinese astrology has five elements, which are referred to as agents: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water.\n\nYou have a deep affinity with the agent Wood. In China, this element corresponds to the planet Jupiter, the green colour and the number 8.\n\nYou are sensitive to the harmony of your life setting and you come across as an accommodating person. Indeed, you deem useless to hurt your close friends without a sound reason. On the contrary, you strive to maintain a good balance around you.\n\nThe agent Wood implies some creative abilities: the liveliness of your imagination goes hand in hand with a sense of realities that prevents you from pursuing chimerical objectives. Your numerous projects can be successfully carried out, all the more so because, better than anyone, you are able to convince your interlocutors and forge the supports required by your plans and your ambitions.\n\nThe diplomacy you use when your interests are at stake can but favour the success of your endeavours. The only risk may be that you scatter your energy and reach saturation point because you try too hard to create, design, compose... Therefore, it is important that you limit the scope of some of your investigation fields.\n\nN. B.: when the birth time is unknown, (12:00 PM (unknown)), these portrait excerpts do not take into account the parameters derived from the time, which means, the domification (Ascendant, astrological houses, etc.). Nonetheless, these analyses remain accurate in any case. Regarding the sources of the birth data in our possession, kindly note that the pages we publish constitute a starting point for more detailed research, even though they seem useful to us. When the sources are contradictory, which occurs rarely, after having analysed them, we choose the most reliable one. Sometimes, we publish a birth date just because it is made available, but we do not claim that is it the best one, by no means."
