        "text": "On June 30, 2008, Mecca of Tennis was shocked to see a major upset. 31 year old Thai Player Tamarine Tanasugarn proved her mettle by beating the 2nd seeded Jelena Jankovic. Ganesha explains the astrological reason behind this major upset of Wimbledon 2008 using Vedic Astrology.\n\nAs both the player’s birth time is unavailable, Ganesha has taken Surya Kundli (horoscope of Sunrise time) into account.\n\nTamarine Tanasugarn\n\nDate of birth:- May 24, 1977\n\nTime of birth :- Unavailable\n\nPlace of birth :- Los Angeles, CA, USA\n\nTamarine Tanasugarn Surya Kundli\n\nJelena Jankovic\n\nDate of birth:- February 28, 1985\n\nTime of birth :- Unavailable\n\nPlace of birth :- Belgrade, Serbia\n\nJelena Jankovic Surya Kundli\n\nTransit chart of the match day\n\nJune 30, 2008\n\n12PM\n\nLondon, England\n\nEffects of planets in the Event Chart on Tamarine and Jelena’s chart\n\nGanesha observes that the match began in Virgo Ascendant which is the 5th house of Tamarine’s Surya Kundli and it is the 8th house in Jelena’s Surya Kundli. As the Ascendant of the match beginning time was falling in Trine from Tamarine’s Surya Kundli and it was the 8th house of difficulties in Jelena’s Surya Kundli Tamarine was in a position of advantage. Secondly, transiting Moon was passing through Taurus over Tamarine’s Natal Sun and Jupiter. Transiting Moon was making favourable Trine Ascpect and was Sextile with majority of her planets whereas in Jelena’s chart, transiting Moon was making Square with Natal Sun and Mercury and was forming an opposition ascpect with her Saturn. Saturn is a natural baleful planet and has a tendency to slow things down. Transiting Moon making 180 degrees aspect with her Natal Saturn has played a major role in her defeat. Moreover, transiting Rahu is passing over her Natal Jupiter which is unfavourable for her. These are the reasons why she lost the game.\n\nTamarine’s way ahead in Tennis\n\nTransiting Jupiter will be forming a Trine aspect with Tamarine’s Natal Sun from December 2008 and Rahu is already in Trine position with her Natal Rahu. Both the points are favourable for her career progress but Saturn is forming Square with Natal Sun and Jupiter. These factors indicate hard times and victory can be achieved only after facing difficulties. Ganesha doesn’t foresee her achieving further heights in very tough competitions till the end of the year, however, during the next year she may play very well. The period after November 2009 is going to be difficult for her as per Ganesha’s calculations. But till then she would play satisfactorily well, no doubt about that.\n\nGanesha wishes good luck to Tamarine Tanasugarn."
