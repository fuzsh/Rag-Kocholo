        "text": "CHAPTER 3 of the book. SERBIAN & GREEK ART MUSIC is the first book in the English language to examine the assimilation and development of western art music in Serbia and Greece during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The book is thematically concerned with music creation and education in these two neighbouring nations since they gained freedom from the Ottomans in the nineteenth century. The volume explores the efforts made by local musicians and their attempts to synchronize their musical environment with the West and achieve the inclusion of Serbian and Greek music in western music history. An aim that seemed coherent to overall progress and, at various historical stages, achievable, but has never yet been realized. Katy Romanou ‘patches up’ this failure with a breadth of research, at a time when interest in Balkan cultures is becoming increasingly popular among western researchers. Written by seven renowned musicologists, chapters offer fresh perspectives proves invaluable to scholars of Balkan studies and facilitate a more comprehensive perception of the area. The book stresses the interaction between music and politics, and shows how the music culture of the two countries has been affected by the political upheavals that divided and dislocated their populations with catastrophic force and high frequency, impeding cultural evolution.\n\nThis paper is dedicated to the investigation of the initial period of the Institute of Musicology SAS, the first scientific institution of this kind in Serbia (and Yugoslavia), in order to give an insight into the development of national musicology and ethnomusicology. The results of earlier research about the topic have been expanded by means of the analysis of documents from the archive of the Institute of Musicology SASA. The organization of the Institute’s functioning, general research orientation, key topics, methodological choices and the significance of individual researchers were considered in detail. This diachronically oriented overview of research into music throughout the 20th century enabled us to pointing out the continuities and innovations after World War II and the Institute’s foundation.\n\nDuring the course of my continuing research into the music of Serbia, it was drawn to my attention by my friend and colleague Professor Bogdan Djakovic that there were, in a certain choral archive in Belgrade, a number of adaptations of 16th-century Latin motets, with adaptations of the texts in Slavonic. Though intrigued, I was unable actually to pursue this enquiry until some years later, and should like to record here my gratitude to the present Director of the First Belgrade Choral Society, Svetlana Vilic, who generously granted me access to the archive and dispensed of her time in order to further my investigations. The scores in question include both sacred and secular music by composers including Marenzio and Monteverdi and, in particular, Palestrina. Their inclusion in the repertoire of the Society was the result of the training and initiative of the composer and conductor Kosta P. Manojlovic. What is interesting about this, apart from the fact that the liturgical works are ..."
