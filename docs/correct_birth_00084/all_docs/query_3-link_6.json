With 24 grand slams to his name, he has etched his name in the history of the game. However, without the support of his incredible team, he would have not been able to achieve anything of this sort. Talking about his support, his wife Jelena Djokovic is a name that always tops the chart as she stood with him throughout his highs and lows and helped the Djoker break new records while helping him stay at the top.\n\nBut how has her journey been all these years?
