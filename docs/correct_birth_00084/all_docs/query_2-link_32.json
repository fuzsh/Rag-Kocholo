        "text": "The 36-year-old hasnât played on the tour in nearly four years due to a back injury. Her last match was at the 2017 US Open, losing to eventual quarterfinalist Petra Kvitova in the opening round.\n\nLast June, Jankovic took part in compatriot Novak Djokovicâs Adria Tour exhibition during the height of the pandemic, playing a mixed doubles match alongside Djokovic.\n\nâI stopped because I had a big injury with my back. It took me quite some time to function in a normal way in general, just to live a normal life,â Jankovic told Tennis.com. âBut now I feel good. Iâm happy. Iâm excited. Weâll see... In these times itâs difficult to plan things. But all I can say is that Iâm healthy, and Iâm happy to be out here.\n\nJankovic, who reached a career-high ranking of No. 1 in 2008, has won 15 career WTA singles titles including the 2010 Indian Wells silverware and a pair of Rome crowns. She reached the final of the 2008 US Open and multiple semifinal showings at the Australian Open (2008) and French Open (2007, â08, â10).\n\nThe Serbian hasnât ruled out a return to the tour.\n\nâYou know, I never officially retired. So my door is open,â she said in 2020."
