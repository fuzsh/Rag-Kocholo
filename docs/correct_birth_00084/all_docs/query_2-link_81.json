        "text": "It seems whenever Serena Williams and Jelena Jankovic draw each other in a tournament, drama is sure to be involved at some point during their match.\n\nIt happened again on Thursday at the Dubai Championship, where Serena took out Jankovic 6-2, 6-2 to advance to the semifinals but not before a rather testy final game that saw both players yell across the net at each other.\n\nJankovic was visibly upset by the time Serena was taking between points, trying to serve points faster and faster with Williams holding her up a few times.\n\nYou'll see in the video below that Williams holds up her racquet as a sign to wait so she could cough, and that was the final straw for Jankovic, who walked away from the service line and apparently yelled \"you can take more time, it's yours\" to Serena sarcastically.\n\nWilliams fired back, \"Do you want to do this again, Jelena\" to the delight of the crowd, drawing back memories to similar situations at the 2013 Family Circus Cup and the 2010 Italian Open, when time was another issue between players.\n\nAfter Williams broke Jankovic the two met at net, and Williams looked to try to clear things up with Jankovic, saying afterwards that she just wanted to make sure everything was okay between the two after the match was completed.\n\nVia the AP report ...\n\nWilliams now moves to 9-4 in her career against Jankovic, so maybe she wasn't as annoyed at Serena as she is at her inability to take her down, losing her last five matches to the No. 1 player in the world.\n\nSerena moves on to play Alize Cornet in the semifinals on Friday."
