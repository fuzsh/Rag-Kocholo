        "text": "PARIS (AP) — Winning over the chic Parisians can prove quite a challenge in a city renowned for its fashion shows and designer shops.\n\nBut Jelena Jankovic did her best to impress the crowd at Roland Garros by wearing an elegant dress with white and navy blue stripes.\n\n\"I think it's a very unique dress. It's very classy,\" Jankovic said. \"I think it's very French. I love it.\n\n\"I have the red shoes that give a little nice contrast to it. It's a little bit different to what I used to wear, and I think it's nice to show it off here at the French Open where fashion is quite a big thing.\"\n\n— Trung Latieule\n\n___\n\nLIFELONG FRIENDS: Many tennis fans are just getting to know Taylor Townsend, the 18-year-old American who has reached the third round at the French Open in her Grand Slam debut.\n\nDonald Young, another young American, is more familiar with the talented teen.\n\n\"I have known her since she was born, since she was just in the cradle and all that,\" the 24-year-old Young said Thursday after also advancing to the third round at Roland Garros.\n\n\"My parents and her parents have been friends since before I was born,\" Young added. \"My parents started her playing tennis. They were like the first coaches and kind of worked like that, and they were always around.\"\n\nIf Townsend and Young keep playing like they did in their opening matches, they might be hanging around together at Roland Garros into the second week.\n\n— Chris Lehourites\n\n___\n\nSAY AGAIN: Getting athletes to open up after competing can be tricky. Some spout out the same old clichés over and over, and some prefer to keep their answers to a minimum.\n\nAndrea Petkovic definitely kept it simple Thursday at the French Open after advancing to the third round with a 6-2, 4-6, 6-2 win over Stefanie Voegele of Switzerland.\n\nListening to a comment that she made it through, the 28th-seeded German didn't even resort to actual words.\n\n\"Uh huh,\" she said.\n\nAnd you can quote her on that.\n\n— Chris Lehourites\n\n___\n\nFLYING HIGH: Just about everyone who saw Gael Monfils diving for a shot at the French Open on Thursday was left in awe.\n\nNot so much Gael Monfils.\n\n\"It was a little bit (of a) fake one, I would say, because I was out of balance,\" Monfils said after reaching the third round. \"But it was not a great dive. I think it was 5 (out of) 10. Could be better.\"\n\nFans will have to wait a few more days to see if the high-flying Frenchman can outdo himself in the next round.\n\n— Chris Lehourites\n\n___\n\nFrench Open Watch follows tennis' clay-court Grand Slam tournament in Paris as seen by journalists from The Associated Press. It will be updated throughout the day."
