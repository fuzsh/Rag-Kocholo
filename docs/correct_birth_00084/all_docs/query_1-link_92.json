        "text": "Much has been made of the Serbian's lack of grand slam titles in the build-up to the Australian Open but the 23-year-old is relaxed about her prospects and the pressure that comes with being top seed.\n\n\"I'm just a girl who enjoys her tennis. I go to the court with a smile on my face and that's what matters,\" she declared. \"I don't really think and stress about rankings, grand slams or other things. It's not worth it. I just go out there and try to play my best tennis and hope for the best.\"\n\nShe also responded to claims by Serena Williams, who said she felt that she was the best in the world despite being ranked number two.\n\n\"Everybody can think what they want to think,\" Jankovic continued. \"Everybody has the right to think and believe that they are the best in the world. We are professional athletes.\n\n\"I'm the number one player in the world and I believe I'm the best one. I feel like the number one player in the world. Serena can feel the same. Everybody has their own confidence and the belief in themselves.\"\n\nJankovic's build-up has been hampered by a bout of flu, which caused her to withdraw from a tournament in Hong Kong and left her struggling in practice earlier in the week in Melbourne.\n\nWhile she has recovered, she admitted her lack of preparation was an extra hurdle to overcome ahead of her first-round clash with Austrian Yvonne Meusburger.\n\n\"It will be an extra challenge for me because in past years I have always played some matches before and warm-up tournaments,\" she said.\n\n\"I've practised very hard and really tried my best in the last week to prepare as best as possible to be ready for the tournament. I will try my best here and we will see how everything will go.\""
