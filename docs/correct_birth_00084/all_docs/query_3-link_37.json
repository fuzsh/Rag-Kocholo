Event type: Webinar Event format:Online only Description:People have the right to participate in decisions and processes that directly impact them. There is a growing demand for the systematic protection of this right for people with lived experience of mental health challenges. Unfortunately, people with lived experience have had limited opportunities to participate and contribute to the development of policies and services that meet their needs. Even when they are involved, their contributions are often relegated to ‘acknowledgments’, rather than being recognized as ‘co-authors’. This denies them the chance to take ownership of these critical policies and services, despite their direct and significant impact on people’s mental health and well-being. Mental Health Europe defines co-creation in mental health as “a collaborative approach involving all actors in mental health working together on an equal basis to develop and implement policies, services, programmes, and communication that foster positive mental health according to a psychosocial model and human rights-based approach.” Promoting co-creation as the standard practice holds significant benefits. For people with lived experience, co-creation reduces stigma and discrimination related to mental health. It also fosters self-efficacy and self-esteem, while enhancing mental health literacy, Importantly, co-creation ensures that real needs are thoroughly considered and taken into account. Simultaneously, it contributes to more effective and accessible mental health systems by enabling more effective forms of support for people experiencing mental ill health expanding the availability and value of interventions aimed at preventing mental health conditions and promoting well-being But how is it done? How can you contribute? This European Public Health Week, which coincides with European Mental Health Week, the WHO Regional Office for Europe and Mental Health Europe are hosting a webinar exploring this question. Stefan Schreck (Adviser, DG for Health and Food Safety, European Commission) will also join this event on behalf of DG SANTE.
