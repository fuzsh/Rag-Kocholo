        "text": "Richard Brooks began his journey in the world of tennis at the age of 7, since his father practiced this same sport. Much of his youth was spent in Martinique (The Caribbean). Later he moved to Spain and at the age of 14 he was proclaimed runner-up in Spain against former professional tennis player Tommy Robredo.\n\nFrom that moment on, he decided to dedicate himself more professionally to this sport and moved to England where he won the title of runner up of England against Mark Hilton. He entered the ITF junior circuit and managed to get the position 91 in the international ranking.\n\nHe played Wimbledon Junior twice during the year 1998 and 1999. Within his career in the world of tennis, he has worked as a sparring partner on the ATP and WTA professional circuit. Nicolás Massau, Catalina Castaño or Stefan Edberg are just some of the players for whom he has sparred. He has also been the coach of 2 great tennis players on the WTA circuit, Jelena Jankovic (former world no.1) and Tamira Paszek (former world no.26).\n\nDuring the years 2010-2012 he was tennis director of the Alicante tennis center, training some of the best tennis players in Spain in the youth categories. “Brooks” as he is known to his friends has been around the circuit for many years and has trained numerous players from all over the world."
