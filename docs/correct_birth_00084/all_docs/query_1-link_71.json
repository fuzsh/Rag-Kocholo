        "text": "Deba Prasad Dhar\n\nWorld No. 15 Jelena Jankovic recalls the warn-torn years in Serbia that shaped her career.\n\nWhat is home for Serbia’s top tennis players? It would be an insensitive question to Novak Djokovic, Ana Ivanovic and Jelena Jankovic born in a warravaged nation. They are only parttime citizens of their native land… the horrific Balkan war having long driven the trio elsewhere for better facilities. Djokovic had moved to Monaco. Ivanovic made Switzerland her adopted home. And Jankovic was only a seven-year-old when she shifted base to Florida to train with Nick Bollettieri.\n\nDjokovic and Ivanovic are live creatures, ever throbbing with energy. Jankovic is different in comparison. During the recent Champions Tennis League, she came across as a soft-spoken woman, measured in words, but no less intense.\n\nJankovic doesn’t want to be reminded of the early years (Serbia) that still torment her consciousness. “When you are a child and confront war every day, it’s not easy. We didn’t even have proper electricity. We didn’t have a tradition of tennis. We didn’t have good facilities to train, not even a proper hard court,” she says in a conversation with Mirror.\n\nWe ask her about Serbia’s fabled Olympic-sized swimming pool, kind of a makeshift court. You may have heard stories of Jankovic and Ivanovic training there in the mornings at sub-zero temperatures to avoid the war hours.\n\nJankovic maintains that she practised at the swimming pool only “a couple of times” before leaving her native land. Is that what makes Serbs proud competitors? “That’s not the only reason,” she answers. “As a nation, we are very successful in sports. We are a small country but produce great athletes. But our struggles have been such that we really have to work our way up to get something. Nothing comes easy to us or falls from the skies. We are always hungry and determined. We are fighters who never give up.”\n\nIt’s been nearly five years since she was briefly No. 1. Her graph nose-dived even as her other three compatriots rose in stature. Just what led to the curious descent?\n\n“I spent over six years in the top which is quite a long time. I was in the top 10 last year before the back injury. I couldn’t compete or train, so much so that I wasn’t able to lift my shoes. I had injuries in the past but this was a serious one. At this level you must train well, for every bit counts. You can get off form quickly. You lose your position and timing if you are not training well. Then you have to give yourself time to recover. And it’s not always about rankings, you have to enjoy being on court,” she explains.\n\nShe has quite a realistic expectation of herself. She has set no targets, she makes no statements…there’s just a silent will to be happy on court and “be in good shape”.\n\nWe have heard about her amazing camaraderie with Ivanovic but what about Djokovic? “He has a great sense of humour…always jokes around. He is so strong mentally that he always has a mental edge in crucial points. You will have to be at your absolute best to beat him.”\n\nAnd what about her own rivals, anyone as ruthless? And then you realise the triviality of the question, given the gulf in class between the women’s No. 1 and the rest. “It has to be Serena Williams,” Jankovic says. “She has such a strong physical game. I am one of the few players to record four wins against her.”\n\nBy the way, one junior Indian talent in the Champions Tennis League has impressed her too. She raves about Karman Kaur Thandi. “The league is a unique concept. It’s a great learning experience for them, an opportunity to pick up little things and become like us. She (Thandi) is so enthusiastic…always asking for advice. I’m more than happy to share.”"
