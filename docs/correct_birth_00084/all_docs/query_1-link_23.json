        "text": "It’s been a long time since we last heard from Jelena Jankovic. Ever since meeting her now-husband and then becoming a mom, the former world number one has kept her private life absolutely to herself.\n\nWhile most WTA players show their babies the moment they’re born and then share their motherhood experiences with the world, the 2008 US Open finalist seems to have disappeared. Truth be told, ever since she played her last tennis match in September 2017, Jankovic has largely kept herself away from the public eye. Only from time to time she posted some travel photos on Instagram.\n\nWe are sure that the fun-loving Serb is making the most out of her post-tennis life, but we have to say that we miss her. In today’s world it a bit strange that six months after she gave birth to a baby girl we still don’t even know the child’s name. This is somewhat unexpected, as JJ was always eager to talk to the media.\n\nFrom what we know, Jankovic and her husband, a Serbian doctor Branko Barac, met in spring 2020. They supposedly met after Novak Djokovic’s Adria Tour exhibition tournament in Belgrade. Jankovic took part in the June event and since Djokovic tested positive for coronavirus, Jankovic also needed to take the test, which is when she met the doctor at one private clinic in the Serbian capital."
