(a father), 61 years old, occupation: a pensioner, lives in\n\nDrežnica, ...; gives the following:\n\nSTATEMENT\n\n“I know nothing about plans under ciphers “Proboj 1” (“Breakthrough 1”), “Proboj 2”\n\n(“Breakthrough 2”) and “Proboj 3” (“Breakthrough 3”). I heard now for the first time about\n\nthe existence of these plans. Consequently, I don’t know who made these plans, what\n\nobjectives of these plans were, who had to execute them or about the network of\n\ncollaborators of the group of operatives who had to bring to life mentioned plans, especially\n\nthe plan the “Proboj 1” (“Breakthrough 1”).\n\nHowever, about the arming of the Serbian population on the territory of Ogulin and Brinje,\n\nso-called “Gornji Kraj”, before the beginning of the armed aggression on the Republic of\n\nCroatia and after the aggression on the Republic of Croatia and about preparations of the\n\narmed mutiny on the territory of Ogulin and Brinje, as well as other occurrences linked to\n\nthis, I have certain knowledge that I am going to set forth and explain in more detail.\n\nThe main organisers of preparations for the armed mutiny during 1990 and 1991 on the\n\nterritory of Drežnica and Jasenak, municipality of Ogulin, were:\n\n• Dušan Kričković called “Učo” that later got hurt, probably died\n\n• Rajko Ivošević\n\n• Nikola Rajnovi ć called “Č iča” – a retired officer of the Yugoslav Federal\n\nArmy, a native of Srpska (ILLEGIBLE WORD) who is now somewhere in\n\nBeograd\n\n• Milan Ivošević – now a manager of the Forester’s office in Jasenak\n\n• Milan Mamula called “Mindja” – now a forester’s technician in the Forester’s\n\noffice in Jasenak\n\n• Nedjeljko Marović – now working in the Forester’s office in Drežnica, an\n\nengineer of forestry\n\n• Petar Radojčić – now working as a stoker in a school in Drežnica\n\n• Petar Kosanović called “Žakljar” – now working somewhere abroad\n\n• Marica Vukelić called “Trepavica” – now somewhere in Serbia\n\nFrom the middle of 1990 until the end of 1991 all of them met regularly and secretly in the\n\nweekend cottage of Rajko Ivoševi ć in Jasenak, the hamlet Zrni ći Jasena čki, at Petar\n\nRadojčić’s in Drežnica, the hamlet Bulici, and at Nedjeljko Marovi ć’s in Krakar, Drežnica.\n\nMentioned Rajko Ivošević quitted Drežnica in 1991 or in 1992 and he is now somewhere in\n\nSerbia, in Belgrade.\n\nSometime during August of 1991, for the first time a certain quantity of weapons was\n\ntransported by two military personnel carriers of the Yugoslav Federal Army from the 30\n\ndirection of Ogulin to the wood “Cungar”, not far away from the village Drežnica. One\n\nofficer of the Yugoslav Federal Army by the name Milan Tesli ć, a tall swarthy man, about\n\n35 years old, as I heard, a relative of Dušan Kričković called “Učo”, drove the weapons. On\n\nthat occasion, several officers of the Yugoslav Federal Army were together with Tesli ć. On\n\nthat occasion, according to my knowledge, which isn’t the most accurate, about 300 semi-\n\nautomatic rifles, about 20 snipers, 20-30 automatic rifles and a certain quantity of hand-\n\ngrenades and pistols were brought. Namely, at that time, I was the president of the Local\n\nCommittee in Drežnica and I worked together with one group of inhabitants, with a crisis\n\nstaff of the municipality of Ogulin and with certain officials of the municipality of Ogulin\n\nand Vrbovsko against the armed mutiny and against the stirring up intolerance between the\n\nSerbian and the Croatian population on this territory. That is why those persons, who\n\nengaged in stirring up armed mutiny, hid a lot from me and so I couldn’t come to more\n\naccurate and more precise information. Later, the above-mentioned organisers of the armed\n\nmutiny, especially Petar Radoj čić, Milan Ivoševi ć and Nikola Radulovi ć – a carrier from\n\nDrežnica, engaged in distribution and in division of these weapons on the territory of\n\nDrežnica and Jasenak.\n\nI got acquainted with the mentioned Milan Tesli ć before that delivery of weapons,\n\nsometime in June or in July of 1991, when he came to D .K.’s (called “U.”)\n\nwith whom I am best man. On that occasion during the conversation, Tesli ć, among other\n\nthings, inquired about the political circumstances and state and about the mood of the\n\nSerbian population on the territory of Ogulin, especially on the territory of Drežnica and\n\nJasenak. I saw Teslic for the last time early in September of 1991 when he came to Jasenak\n\nby helicopter of the Yugoslav Federal Army and landed near the school. On that occasion,\n\nhe brought between 15 and 20 rocket launchers that D .K. and Tošo Mamula\n\ntook over. They put those rocket launchers in the house of K ., that is in the school\n\nwh ere he lived. I don’t know what happened with those rocket launchers later. I heard that\n\nshortly afterwards Teslić had a car accident somewhere near Banja Luka, that he was badly\n\ninjured and that after that he ended up being in Belgrade. I don’t know what happened to\n\nhim afterwards and where he is today.\n\nAfter Teslić had stopped coming to the territory of Drežnica and Jasenak, sometime late in\n\nSeptember of 1991 Slobodan Platiša came to this area for the first time, allegedly by\n\nhelicopter of the Yugoslav Federal Army. I knew Platiša from before because his mother is\n\nfrom my village and she is married in Gornji Kraj. On that occasion, Platiša came to Petar\n\nKosanović’s (called “Žakljar”) who invited me to come to his house. When I arrived,\n\nPlatiša and K . called “U.” were at Kosanović’s. Platiša was in civilian clothes. He\n\nstayed and spent the night at my place for 2 or 3 days, because I knew him from before.\n\nAfter that, I drove him to Vodote č (Gornji Kraj). His father is a native of Vodotec and he\n\nhas relatives there. According to my knowledge, he went to that territory because of the\n\ndistribution of weapons to the population of Serbian nationality and because of the\n\n“shooting” of the entire situation on this territory. As I could conclude from talking with\n\nhim, I think that he was one of the “moderate” persons, that he was against stirring up\n\narmed mutiny and that he was for solving the entire situation peacefully.\n\nLater, during the second half of 1991 and until the middle of 1992, Platiša came more often\n\nto the territory of Drežnica and Jasenak. He occasionally visited me, but he came and\n\ncontacted most often with D .K., Petar Kosanović, Milan Mamula, Milan and\n\nRajko Ivošević, Petar Radojčić and Nikola Radulović called “Čiča”, although, accordin g to\n\nmy judgement, he disagreed with him politically. During conversations with me, he told me\n\nseveral times that Nikola Rajnović called “ Čiča” came here of some strange motives and 31\n\nthat the rest of us should organise with a view of peaceful solving of the conflict and risen\n\nproblems.\n\nLate in October or early in November of 1991, staffs for the observation of the general\n\nsituation, for organising local guards and the like were established in Drežnica and in\n\nJasenak. That was done by arrangement with the crisis staff of the municipality of Ogulin.\n\nAbove-mentioned “extremists” and organisers of the attempt of the armed mutiny on this\n\nterritory tried to enforce their politics and their way of solving the situation upon these\n\nstaffs, but they failed it. So, they withdrew from the work of these staffs. At the same time,\n\nPetar Radojčić, Milan Ivošević, Nedjeljko Marović and Marica Vukelić withdrew from the\n\nCouncil of local committees due to disagreement with the work of the same.\n\nExtremists continued meeting regularly after that and they tried to establish, to say so, a\n\ncertain parallel authority of their own by means of which they would boycott and render\n\nimpossible the activity of the rest of us.\n\nAfter weapons of the Yugoslav Federal Army had arrived in the territory of Drežnica and\n\nJasenak and had been distributed to “confiding” inhabitants of Serbian nationality, during\n\nthe second half of 1991, a military training was conduced using these weapons for the\n\nterritory of Drežnica on the so-called Drežnicko polje, directed by Petar Radoj čić and\n\nMilan Radulović called “Pavlin”, and for the territory of Jasenak in the wood towards\n\n(ILLEGIBLE WORD), directed by D .K. called “U.” and Petar Kosanović.\n\nBesides the above-mentioned, which I personally saw, I am aware that during September\n\nand October of 1991, weapons came several times by helicopter not far away from Jasenak.\n\nHelicopters landed on one glade next to a road that leads towards Mrkoplje. When those\n\nweapons arrived, Rajko Ivoševi ć and Nikola Rajnovi ć called “Čiča” were always present.\n\nThose weapons, as well as the other ones, were then distributed to confiding persons of\n\nSerbian nationality. Besides that, one part of weapons came by military trucks from the\n\ndirection of Vrhovine across Prokik and Vodote č by a forest road that had been cleared and\n\ncompleted in a hurry during summer of 1991, probably just because of those needs. Besides\n\nweapons, a certain quantity of explosives that was also distributed to inhabitants arrived. I\n\ndon’t know where all of that is today.\n\nBefore the mentioned delivery and distribution of weapons on the territory of Drežnica,\n\nJasenak and the so-called “Gornji Kraj”, during the first half of 1991, Mile Kosanovi ć (son\n\nof Mitar), Todor Mamula, Boško Mamla called “Krapan”, Jadranka Obradovi ć and several\n\nother younger persons went from Jasenak to the military-commando-terrorist training in\n\nPančevo and in Knin. Later, the afore-mentioned Mile Kosanovi ć and Jadranka Obradovi ć\n\nmarried and then they went to Canada, while Todor Mamula went to Belgrade.\n\nDuring 1990 and early in 1991, Nikola Medakovi ć, a president of the Local Committee of\n\nPlaški then and later a president of the arbitrary and self-declared municipality of Plaški,\n\ncame often to the territory of Drežnica and Jasenak with a view to connecting Drežnica and\n\nJasenak with Plaški, to organise the armed mutiny on the territory of Ogulin and then to\n\nfinally separate themselves from the Republic of Croatia, that is to join the so-called “SAO\n\nKrajina”. With regard to that, Medakovi ć often contacted me, but I disagreed with his\n\npolitical views. That is why we stopped contacting and we parted, so that Medakovi ć\n\ncontinued contacting with his like-minded persons Petar Radoj čić, D .K. and the\n\nlike.\n\nLate in 1990 or 1991, one group from Drežnica and Jasenak, whose members were\n\nK., Nadjeljko Marović, Duško (ILLEGIBLE WORD), Dragan Trbović – who drove 32\n\na car and some other persons, stayed in Knin due to consultations with Babi ć, Martić and\n\nothers from the leadership of Knin and of the Serbian Democratic party of that time.\n\nLate in 1991 or early in 1992, “extremists” from the territory of Drežnica and Jasenak kept\n\ncontact with like-minded persons from Plaški and they went back and forth to Plaški\n\n(ILLEGIBLE WORDS). Together with above-mentioned weapons and ammunition\n\n(ILLEGIBLE WORDS) Drežnica and Jaseak a certain quantity (ILLEGIBLE WORDS)\n\ncame, probably for maintaining mutual relations. I don’t know where those “motorole”\n\nended up later.\n\nBecause of organising of the armed mutiny and connecting Jasenak, Drežnica and Gomirje,\n\nLazo Mamula and Borivoj Dokmanovi ć came often, and they still come today, from\n\nGomirje to Jasenak and there they contacted with the above-mentioned extremists from\n\nDrežnica and from Jasenak.\n\nIn the second half of 1991, Milan Mamula, Milan Ivošević and Stamenko Pejakovi ć\n\nprocured about 10 tons of various food and put it in a worker’s centre of the Forester’s\n\noffice in Jasenak and in a fireman’s centre that is at a saw-mill in Jasenak. That food had to\n\nserve as a reserve in case of the armed mutiny. The larger part of that food was distributed\n\nto inhabitants later on. That food was procured by buying for forest logs through one\n\nVujnović from Vrbovsko or from Gomirje.\n\nAs I have already said, D .K. called “U.” got hurt by entering a minefield\n\nwhen reconnoitring the radio transmitter “Mirkovica” after the Yugoslav Federal Army had\n\nrocketed the repeater. After the rocket attack on the repeater, K, together with Petar\n\nKosanović and Todor Mamula called “Tošo”, went reconnoitring by order of Rajnovi ć and\n\nRajko Ivošević.\n\nThe main distributor of weapons in “Gornji Kraj”, on the territory of Vodote č and\n\nsurrounding hamlets and villages was Bogdan Božani ć called “Koji ć” – a relative of\n\nSlobodan Platiša, whom I drove to Platiša on that occasion that I talked about before.\n\nBožanic was later held in custody in Karlovac for some time and then he was exchanged. I\n\ndon’t know his present whereabouts.\n\nDuring 1992 and 1993, two persons were killed on the territory of Jasenak. One of them\n\nwas a person of Croatian nationality and the other of Serbian nationality. I do not know\n\nwho committed these terrorist actions. I heard that late in 1991, Miloš Mamula, a father of\n\nmentioned Tošo Mamula, shot at a vehicle by which Dr. Saks from Ogulin was going.\n\nAccording to my rough estimate, a total of between 700 and 800 “barrels” – rifles,\n\nautomatic rifles, pistols, about 15-20 rocket launchers, about 20 snipers, a certain quantity\n\nof explosives and large quantity of weapons with ammunition came to the territory of\n\nDrežnica and Jasenak.\n\nBesides the mentioned quantity of weapons and ammunition, a certain number of mortars\n\nand hand-grenades arrived. Those weapons were hidden in Drežnica, hamlet of Joi ći, in the\n\nhouse of the late Djukan; then not far away from the place Brezno in one cave in the wood\n\ncalled (ILLEGIBLE WORD) and in various other places, while one part of the weapons\n\nand ammunition was distributed to inhabitants as I have already said. I am not familiar\n\nwhere those weapons are today. I think that Petar Radoj čić, Nadeljko Marovi ć, Stojan\n\nTatalović called “Joi ć”, Duško Radulovi ć called “Škoro”, Nikola Radulovi ć – a carrier,\n\nDragan Trbovi ć, Bogomir Ivoševi ć, Milan Ivoševi ć, Gnjaco Marovi ć, Živko Tatalovi ć\n\ncalled “Papež”, Stojan Radulovi ć, Milan Mamula, Petar Kosanovi ć called “Žakljar”,\n\nMladen Kosanović and others should know, that is they know, more and more accurately 33\n\nabout that. Late in 1992, one part of those weapons was returned through the Local\n\nCommittee and handed over to the police station of the PS of Ogulin that obviously has\n\naccurate data about the quantity of the returned weapons and ammunition.\n\nDuring 1992, a certain amount of money in DM came from Begrade as, allegedly, help to\n\nthe Local Committee. Petar Kosanović, Petar Radojčić and Borivoje Dokmanović took over\n\nthat money. I do not know how much money it was and what happened later with that\n\nmoney. I know that people who travelled to Beograd asked about the money and what\n\nhappened with it because it should be allotted to inhabitants and that wasn’t the case.\n\nThat is all I have to state. “\n\nThere are no further questions for the witness.\n\nThe witness is warned about Article no. 77 subsection no. 1 of the ZKP and he states that\n\nhe heard the dictation of the record, that the same does not have any remarks and that due to\n\nthat he signs it with personal signature.\n\nFinished.\n\nWitness statement was given by: Đ.\n\nANNEX 339:\n\nW ITNESS SATEMENT OF M.Č.\n\nM.Č., son of H. , born on ... in the village ...,\n\nBrčko; a Moslem, a citizen of the Repuc of BIH, without permanent address; a major of\n\nthe air force of the former Yugoslav Federal Army; last service in the Counter-Intelligence\n\nGroup of the Security Agency of the Combat Air Force and of the Anti-Aircraft Defence in\n\nZemun, military post 8115-15 Zemun, gives the following:\n\nSTATEMENT\n\n“I would like to begin the statement with facts, memories and reconstruction of my work\n\nand of the work of other operatives in the Counter-Intelligence Group of the Security\n\nAgency of the Combat Air Force and of the Anti-Aircraft Defence.\n\nDuring the time when I was working in the Counter-Intelligence Group, the head of the\n\nSecurity Agency was a colonel Slobodan Rako čević, the deputy Savo Lap čić (now\n\ndeceased), Radoslav Mitrovi ć (now deceased) and the others. Since 1988, following\n\npersons were employed in the Counter-Intelligence Group:\n\n− The head of the Counter-Intelligence Group: Tomislav Čuk – a colonel\n\n− The deputy of the head of the Counter-Intelligence Group: Ratko Radakovi ć\n\n– a lieutenant-colonel\n\n− The assistant of the head of the Counter-Intelligence Group for the internal\n\nenemy: Pavao Bućan\n\n− The assistant of the head of the Counter-Intelligence Group for the East\n\nintelligence services: Svetozar Džigurski – a colonel\n\n− The assistant of the head for the operational technique: Nabojša Savanović 34\n\n− The assistant of the head for West intelligence services: Ljuban Karan\n\n− Darvin Lisica – a captain\n\n− Zvonko Tišma – a 1 class captain\n\n− Vukoman Milosavljević – a captain\n\nst\n\n− Nikola Radujko – a 1 class captain\n\nBesides the mentioned ones, there were other officers in the Counter-Intelligence Group,\n\nespecially in the operational technique, that were of no safety-operational importance.\n\nThe Counter-Intelligence Group of the Security Agency of the Combat Air Force and of the\n\nAnti-Aircraft Defence directly co-ordinated the work of the counter-intelligence groups\n\ndetachments, 1 stof Skopje, 2nd of Zagreb and 3 rdof Sarajevo. In Zagreb, the 2 nddetachment\n\nth\n\nwas situated on Maksimirska cesta no. 63. From that detachment at the 5 VAK, the head\n\nof the detachment was Mirko Martić – a lieutenant-colonel and besides him Ivan Sabolovi ć,\n\nČedo Kneževi ć – a captain, Miroslav Juran – a captain, Ljubiša Slavuj – a second-\n\nlieutenant, Ljubiša Ljubišić – a standard-bearer, Stjepan Rakari ć – a major, Miroslav Balan\n\n– a captain worked in the detachment.\n\nAccording to my knowledge, between 1990 and February of 1992, isolated individuals\n\nfrom the Counter-Intelligence Group of the Security Agency, as well as from the 2 nd\n\ndetachment of the Counter-Intelligence Group in Zagreb, were comprised in, that is were\n\nactive participants of some, in the war crisis of the crumbling of Yugoslavia, important\n\nactions directed by security services of the former Yugoslav Federal Army. Namely, at the\n\nbeginning of the crumbling of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, that is\n\nafter multiparty elections in the Republic of Croatia, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in Serbia\n\nand in Slovenia, security services of the former Yugoslav Federal Army were responsible\n\nfor the preparations for the mutiny by “tree-trunk revolution” (putting up barricades) and\n\nfor the arming of the Serbian population on the territory of the Republic of Croatia, as well\n\nas in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I would like to set forth my knowledge about that process\n\nthat took place from the middle of the 1990. Namely, with regard to that I was in work\n\nbound for the territory of the north-east Bosnia, with the escalation of the crisis in the\n\nformer Yugoslavia, I was more and more present in the field in the entire Bosnia. Early in\n\n1991, with my stays in Bosnia and Herzegovina, I gradually began to notice the presence of\n\ncertain officers from the 2nddetachment of the Counter-Intelligence Group from Zagreb on\n\nthe territory of Biha ć and Cazinska krajina and Banija and Kordun. With regard to that I\n\npersonally knew all of those officers and that they prized my operational work, and I was\n\nfrom the superior command, some of them set forth concretely their operational tasks and\n\nreasons for the presence on thnd territory. In this way, I gradually comprehended that my\n\ncolleagues, members of the 2 detachment of the Counter-Intelligence Group from Zagreb,\n\nwere engaged in distribution of weapons from military warehouses to the population of\n\nSerbian nationality on Banija, Lika, Kordun and to the Serbian population in Bosnia and\n\nHerzegovina (Bosanski Novi, Prijedor and other).\n\nIn the continuation of the statement, I would like to detail this:\n\nDuring the stay in Biha ć, that is in September of 1991, on the airport Biha ć in the so-called\n\n“Lovačka kuća” (“Hunting-lodge”) I met Major Čedomir Knežević from the 2 nddetachment\n\nof the Counter-Intelligence Group in Zagreb. In one comprehensive conversation Kneževi ć\n\nbrougth up that he, together with lieutenant-colonel Smiljanić from the Security Agency of\n\nthe 5 army and other officers Ljubiša Slavulj – a second lieutenant from the Counter- 35\n\nIntelligence Group of the 2 nd detachment, Miroslav Juran – a captain from the 2 nd\n\ndetachment, Vukašin Gledi ć – a major from the regiment “Vojin” of the airport Pleso,\n\nnd\n\nLjubiša Ljubiši ć – a standard-bearer from the 2 detachment, were on the specific\n\nassignment. That assignment was the organisation of the distribution of weapons,\n\ninstruments and other military equipment to the Serbian population on the territory of Lika,\n\nBanija, Kordun and West Bosnia. I can remember well that Kneževi ć pointed out that\n\ngeneral Aleksandar Vasiljevi ć, from the “Security Administration” of the Federal\n\nDepartment for the National Defence, was directly leading the action, the work, and that\n\nour head, colonel Slobodan Rakoč ević, didn’t know every detail of that work. He even told\n\nme that this operation was conducted under the pseudonym “Proboj 1” (“Breakthrough 1”).\n\nAbout the method of the distribution of weapons to the Serbian population, Čedomir\n\nKnežević told me that they kept records to whom and what they give, that the entire\n\noperation went on according to the established schedule, planned with necessary documents\n\nto whom, what and when distribute out of the military equipment and armaments. During\n\nthat time, in September, when I was in the “Lova čka kuća” (“Hunting-lodge”) in Biha ć,\n\nKnežević and Smiljani ć were drawing up a summary report about the realised and that\n\nreport went directly to the Federal Department for the National Defence to general Aco\n\nVasiljević. I haven’t seen that report as an integral document, but I was present in the\n\n“Lovačka kuća” (“Hunting-lodge”) when they were drawing up that report. Kneževi ć also\n\npointed out to me that they make detailed lists to whom, in what village in Lika, Banija and\n\nKordun, how and when they delivered weapons and other combat means. I remember that\n\nhe stressed that they were delivering that to the Serbian population so that it succeeded in\n\ndefending itself from the Croatian authorities and that he personally didn’t derive profit\n\nfrom that, but if he found out that someone engaged in a black-marketing of that weapons\n\nor if someone benefited from it in another way, that he would personally shot him. On the\n\noccasion of that stay, Kneževi ć also showed me mainly armaments of infantry (automatic\n\nrifles, mortars and non-rebounding cannons) in one of warehouses near the “Lova čka kuća”\n\n(“Hunting-lodge”). I also have to say that Kneževi ć emphasised that this part of the\n\nbusiness was a well kept secret and that other officers on the airport didn’t know anything\n\nlinked to this assignment. With this he wanted to inform me so that I wouldn’t accidentally\n\n“let out” the nature of their business on the Biha ć’s airport when contacting with\n\ncolleagues. I don’t know the entire methodology and technology how Kneževi ć, Smiljanić\n\nand others distributed weapons to the Serbian population on those territories. However, I\n\nam aware of that persons, their collaborators in distribution of weapons, were local officials\n\nof the Serbian Democratic Party who would practically come with lists of weapons and\n\ninstruments that they needed for their positions and through mediation of them they, in\n\nsome places, mostly at night, distributed weapons and equipment to members of the Serbian\n\nDemocratic Party in those places. In September of 1991, Kneževi ć introduced me to one of\n\nlocal leaders of the Serbian Democratic Party in Bosanski Novi, for whom I know that he is\n\na butcher, and through mediation of whom they, in that way, distributed weapons in\n\nBosanski Novi. For sure, and Knežević gave me a hint, that the only task of the “Proboj 1”\n\n(“Breakthrough 1”), that is of the activity of the group on Biha ć’s airport, wasn’t just the\n\ndistribution of armaments to the Serbian population in Lika, Kordun, Banija and parts of\n\nBosnia, but the task was also the organisation of collaborators, better to say of local\n\npolitical followers, who took over political functions and executive power on local levels\n\nand so they could carry out what they were ordered. In this way, I think that on those tracts\n\nsuch operational group, or better to say the system of security of the former Yugoslav\n\nFederal Army, could organise and realise all political and other objectives.”\n\nStatement given by: M .Č. 36\n\nANNEX 340:\n\nW ITNESS SATEMENT OF S.Š.\n\nREPUBLIC OF CROATIA\n\nMINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR\n\nGOSPIĆ POLICE DEPARTMENT\n\nSUBJECT: S .Š., inrview\n\nheld on on 22ndOctober 1992 at Gospi ć Police Department with the former officer of the\n\nJNA who worked at the former Dom of the JNA in Gospić.\n\n(…)\n\nWhile he worked in Gospi ć, S. claims that he did not distribute the weapons from the\n\nGospić barracks to the Serbs, but that it was done from the barracks – storehouse of the\n\nweapons in Sv.

I could not get away because I stayed in my\n\nhouse too long, and later on I could not reach Kupa because the Serbs cut my way off. In\n\nthe hamlet Britveci, Nikola Britvec (died in the meantime) and I stayed, and so did the late\n\nBara and Ivan Britvec, and also a woman who later died in an accident on Lošinj where her\n\ndaughter lived.\n\nThe Serbs immediately after they entered Crna Draga, set on fire my and Nikola Britvec’s\n\nwood house, I hid myself for 2, 3 days in the woods, I slept in a copse because I was afraid\n\nthey might kill me, and the rest of the remaining Croatians did the same. My house was just\n\nthe first one next to the late Ivan and Bara’s house, it was 30 meters away, so we spent most\n\nof the time together. Only I, together with the late Nikola Britvec went to sleep at Mile\n\nDobrić’s at night in the hamlet Dobri ći, that belongs to the Prkos area, but is only 500 to\n\n600 meters away from Britvec. Mile lived alone and his two sons had married and moved in\n\nwith their Croatian wives’ families on the left side of the river Kupa, and they stayed there\n\nduring the whole war. Therefore the Serbs were distrustful of Milo, but nevertheless Nikola\n\nth\n\nand I used to sleep there for about 6 months, I think it was till the 12March, 1992. We\n\nused to sleep in his stables, and during the daytime we went home to feed the cattle because\n\nmy stables, just like Nikola’s were undamaged, and we had some cattle. Besides working at\n\nhome and the fact that we, the remaining Croatians helped each other, we all used to work\n\nfor Serbs when they asked us to. Nikola and I used to eat at Mile Dobri ć’s, he used to cook\n\nfor us and he was the only person who acted normal, and in return we helped him at work.\n\nThe local Serbs, I think neighbors, did not harm us, but the patrols that used to go around\n\nthe village used to slap us and beat us, but that was a normal thing. It all depended on what\n\na person was like. At one time one person kicked me hard in the abdomen, and when I fell\n\nhe asked me to stand in front of him, and as I could not he slapped me. Another man, who\n\nwas with him, barely saved me for the first one would have possibly killed me.\n\nIn the hamlet Dobrići the already mentioned Mile Dobrić, Čedo Dobrić, Petar Dobrić lived,\n\nhis son Đuro and Petar Zrnić with his son Budimir, called “Bude” who was married and his\n\nson Gojko who was not married.\n\nThe Serbs probably pressured Mile Dobri ć, and he somewhere at the beginning of March,\n\n1992 told us that we could not stay any longer at his place and that we had to go. He told us\n\nthat he could not take care of us any longer and cook for us, and we understood his situation\n\nfor he was an old man. 38\n\nI took the blankets from his stables with which I covered myself at night and I carried them\n\nin a wheelbarrow to Britveci (lower). I planned to sleep in my stables, and I slept at Mile’s\n\nmostly because there I was sure, the same as Nikola, that the Serbs would not harm us.\n\nNikola Dobrić went to sleep at Čedo Dobrić’s, also in the hamlet Dobrići because they were\n\ngodfathers. It seems that there were some kinds of quarters at Čedo’s but I am not sure what\n\nit was about.\n\nAs I was passing by Petar Zrnić’s house with my wheelbarrow, I think it was the day when\n\nI was moving to Britveci, his wife Milica came to meet me and she asked me where I was\n\ngoing, and I said that I was going home. After that she called her daughter-in-law, Bude’s\n\nwife and she talked to her about me coming to sleep at their place for the time being. Her\n\ndaughter-in-law, Mara, came from a mixed marriage between a Serb and a Croatian\n\nwoman. She was Evica’s born sister, and Evica was Svetozar Biži ć’s wife and he had just th\n\ncome back to Prkos. Mara agreed that I could sleep at their house, so from the 12 of\n\nMarch, 1992 till the middle of May, 1992 I slept at Zrnić ’s place. I also ate there, usually at\n\nthe table together with them, and they, considering the situation, acted pretty well. I slept in\n\nthe kitchen on the first floor, and this floor was built out of wooden planks, and usually the\n\nmen from the Zrnić family slept in the next room.\n\nThe day before the murder of Ivan and Bara Britvec, in the period around St. Joseph church\n\nholiday in 1992 or maybe a few days later, I spent the whole day at my house in Britveci,\n\nand as usual I was with Ivo and Bara. When it began to get dark I was on my way to Zrni ć’s\n\nhouse. Just as I was passing the new house that Marko Britvec, the son of the late Ivo\n\nBritvec, began to build before the war and that was around 300 to 400 meters away from\n\nthe Britvec wood house, I heard Gojko Zrni ć (Petar Zrni ć’s son at whose house Ivo was\n\nsleeping at) calling someone: “come on, are you finished, are you coming”. He did not\n\nmention any name. Gojko and that other person were at Gornji Britveci (Upper Britveci).\n\nThat is to say there is hamlet Gornji Britveci and hamlet Donji Britveci (Lower Britveci)\n\nwhere I used to live, and the nickname for the Donji Britveci was Luka či. At that moment I\n\ndid not pay much attention to those words, but their meaning became clear to me only later.\n\nAt that moment I was about 200 meters away from Zrnić’s house, but I did not see Gojko or\n\nthis other person on the side road to Donji Britveci.\n\nHalf an hour later after I entered into the Zrni ć’s house, I heard shooting from automatic\n\narms, and according to the direction of the shooting I concluded it was in Donji Britveci. I\n\nand the Zrnić family were just sitting at the table and when the shooting was heard I said\n\nthat Gojko was shooting and that he will bring venison. They said nothing, but I think they\n\nknew what was going on, and I had doubts too.\n\nAbout half an hour later, Gojko came home holding an automatic rifle in his hand and\n\nimmediately after he entered he threw it on the two-seater and he took his shirt of. His\n\nfather told him “you son of a bitch, did you really have to do it”. Gojko said nothing, he just\n\npassed through the kitchen and went to bed.\n\nNobody talked about that that evening, I also went to bed in my room, but I did not sleep at\n\nall that night, I was shivering with fear, thinking that I would be killed too. In the morning,\n\nI got up earlier than usually and I went to my house in Donji Britveci, Milica even asked\n\nme where I was going that early, and I answered that I had to wash some things. I came to\n\nmy house and I fed my cattle, but the whole time I anticipated something. I looked towards\n\nthe Britvec’s house and I saw that the window was open, but I did not see smoke coming\n\nout of the chimney. I found it strange that Bara had not already lit the fire, so I immediately\n\nwent to their house. When I entered the house I happened to find Ivo Britvec in his room, 39\n\nlying on the bed, covered with a blanket, but his head was, as it is said, beneath his legs and\n\nhis legs were on the pillow. His right arm was under the blanket, raised on the level with his\n\nhead and it was rigid. I thought he was asleep so I shook him and I felt that he was cold and\n\ndead for a long time. When I took a better look I saw that the whole right side of his head\n\nwas crushed, because he was shot in that part of his head, and also in the chest and stomach.\n\nI immediately went to Bara’s bed and I saw that she was covered with a blanket up to her\n\nchin. I uncovered her and I saw that she was also shot in the chest and stomach, and that\n\nboth of them were dead.\n\nI immediately went to Zrni ć’s and I told Milica Zrni ć that the Britvecs were killed this\n\nnight, and she answered “sure”. I told her that they were really killed and that the command\n\nshould be notified, and she answered that the command already knew that. I think that\n\nMilica and Petar went to see the late Ivo and Bara to find out if they were really dead, so in\n\nthe morning Milica knew about their murder, and they had probably covered Bara with a\n\nblanket that night, because the blanket did not have bullet holes.\n\nMarko Bjeloš (a native of Sjeni čak, his father’s name is Milan) immediately came that\n\nmorning into the yard of Gojko Zrni ć and they talked about something very quietly a little\n\nfurther away. I think that this Marko Bjeloš was also an accomplice in the Britvec murder,\n\nbut I can not verify that because I did not see neither him, nor Gojko shooting the Britvecs.\n\nI did not notice anything strange about Gojko later, after that incident, I think he would\n\nhave become unsociable or he would start drinking, but even before he was reserved and\n\nunderhand, unlike his brother Bude.\n\nLater that morning, the ex-policeman Ćane (Stanko Č iča from Vrginmost) came, and he\n\nwent to see the scene of the crime, where the Britvecs were killed. I think he organized the\n\nbringing of the caskets for the late Britvecs, and I and the late Nikola Britvec, together with\n\n2 or 3 Serbs put the Britvecs in the caskets. They were not buried until the next day and\n\nthey were buried in front of their own house in their yard. Marko Krmpoti ć who is now in\n\nGermany, the late Nikola Britvec and the late Mile Dobri ć, together with a couple of Serbs\n\nwho were on duty position in Crna Draga buried them.\n\nThe Serbs took the house (where the late Britvecs were murdered) somewhere in 1993 or\n\n1994 because it was a wooden house, but I do not know where they took the house and my\n\nbarn. After I went to Karlovac at the beginning of 1993, the Serbs took everything I had,\n\nexcept the cows that I had sold some time before, so with that money I bought myself a\n\ncarton of cigarettes.\n\nThe Britvec couple were probably killed because Zrni ćs were never fond of the late Ivo,\n\nespecially when they talked politics, and they were in a kind of dissension. His father was a\n\nmember of the Ustashas and he was killed in the last war.\n\nAfter the murder and the burial of the Britvecs, the Serbs did not conduct any kind of\n\ninvestigation, nor was this incident discussed, except for the fact that Nikola and I used to\n\ntalk about it alone. At one incident, I think it was the fall of 1992, when we were picking\n\nplums, I told him that Gojko Zrni ć probably killed the Britvecs, and he just said that he\n\nthought the same. Not long after that Gojko’s mother, Milica verbally attacked me on the\n\nroad, and she asked me how I could keep saying around the village that her Gojko killed the\n\nBritvecs. I told her that I was not saying that at all and that it was not true. Nikola probably\n\ntold his godmother about our conversation and she was Č edo Dobrić’s mother and he used\n\nto sleep at her house and sometimes he would talk to her when they were alone. 40\n\nI think that the Britvecs murder happened a few weeks before the murder of the 6 old\n\npeople in Bosanski Kovačevac, because after a while, Bude told me that I would not be able\n\nto go to St. Petar’s Church in Kovač evac because it was burnt down when the miller Grga\n\nand 5 more people were killed.\n\nNevertheless, I am not so sure in what I had said because I do not completely remember\n\nhow the incidents chronologically happenned while I was in Crna Draga in 1991 and 1992,\n\ndue to the fact that I was constantly under pressure and in fear, so I did not pay much\n\nattention about what happened or when, and I could not and I was not allowed to write\n\nanything down.\n\nAs a consequence of all I had gone through, sometimes I do not follow myself (I am\n\nreferring to my memory) and my wife can confirm that. For example, I thought I had been\n\nth\n\nsleeping at Mith Dobrić’s house till the 12f May, 1992 but I had not, instead I had been\n\nthere till the 12f March, and the next two months I had spent at Petar Zrni ć’s house, and\n\nfrom May onwards I had slept at Č edo Dobri ć’s house where Nikola Britvec had been\n\nstaying for some time before, and we both stayed there till the fall of 1992.\n\nI am prepared to repeat everything I stated in front of the Court, but in case that many\n\npeople will give statements, I would like to be protected so that those people could not find\n\nout the fact that I also gave a statement, because I think that maybe some of the Serbs will\n\nbe summoned when they come back, and they probably will, and therefore I could find\n\nmyself in an unpleasant situation because we all know each other there.\n\nStatement taken by:\n\nPolice officer Ivan Horvat (signature)\n\nOfficial record of the information received from the citizen\n\naccording to the act 177 instruction,\n\n2ndsubsection of the ZKP\n\nA NNEX 342:\n\nW ITNESS SATEMENT OF SČ.\n\nREPUBLIC OF CROATIA\n\nMINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR\n\nCRIME-INVESTIGATION POLICE SECTION\n\nWAR CRIM ES AND TERRORISM UNIT\n\nNo. 511-05-04/1- /98\n\nDate. 6 April 1998\n\nOFFICIAL RECORD\n\nCitizen S.Č., a retiree by occupation, born on ..., JMBG (Unique\n\nCitizens’ Registry Number), with residence in …. On 3 April 1998 he gave the following\n\ninformation on the murder of six elder citizens of Croatian nationality in B. Kova čevac in\n\nMarch 1992 and on the place of their burial, to an official of the crime investigation police\n\nof the PU (Police Department) Karlovac at the premises of the PU Karlovac.\n\n(…) 41\n\nWe were going towards the house of Ivan Britvec aka “Grof” (Count), who was born\n\nsometime around 1924 or ‘25 and was living in Crna Draga, we were actually by car. We\n\ncould not reach the house directly by car so that we walked the last 300 or 400m. His\n\nmother Bara was also living with him; she was already 85 years old.\n\nWhile we were approaching the Britvec house, Čedo said, “somebody killed the Britvec\n\nfamily this evening”. I knew the Britvec family very well, as well as everybody living in\n\nthe broader area of Lasinja, since I had been the commander of a sector for thirteen years\n\nwhile I was working for the Police.\n\nIvan and Bara lived in a wooden house; I think it also had a dirt floor so that when I entered\n\nthe house the old woman lying dead on the couch on the left side of the door. That room\n\nwas covered with automatic rifle brass bullet cases. The woman covered with a blanket so\n\nthat I could not see which body part was mostly wounded. Ivan was lying next to the bed in\n\nthe other room, which was also covered in bullet cases. I did not notice if their house was\n\nturn up side down and if the murder motive was robbery, although I would not know why\n\nthey were murdered.\n\nBefore they were murdered, they used to have two cows and some smaller cattle and after\n\nthey were buried their relatives sold the cattle. Nikola Brežan called “Mika” sold one cow\n\nto Čedo Bućan from Prkos, and I do not know to whom they sold the other cow. That Mika\n\nBrežan gave part of the money to Pane Bulat in order to settle the expenses for the casket,\n\nso that Pane gave part of the money to me since according to him I had helped in this case,\n\nbut I refused to take the money and gave it back to Nikola Brežan.\n\nAs soon as I saw that the people were murdered, and it was evident that the whole thing had\n\nhappened the night before, which was also confirmed by Čedo Dobri ć, we returned to\n\nDobrić’s house and I called the command and asked them for instructions. From the\n\nHeadquarters, Dragan Gvozdić, the then assistant commander of the battalion, as a civilian\n\nhe was headmaster of a school, as well as a man from Topusko, who was an operation\n\nofficer in the headquarters, and before the war he used to be a driver for “PIM”, got in\n\ntouch with me. I do not know which one of them answered first, but they told me that they\n\ncould not make any concrete decisions, but that I should return to the Command, and that\n\nthey would see then what should be done. I returned to the command with the\n\ncommunication specialist, Žarko Obrovac, and Žarko said that Pane Bulat had probably\n\nmurdered Britvec, although officially nobody knew who had murdered them.\n\nAfter I had returned to the brigade command, I talked to Mile Novakovi ć who had at that\n\nth\n\ntime been commander of the 19 Brigade and he told me that it was their concern (meaning\n\nthe Britvec murders and their burial), and ordered me to go to B. Kovačevac.\n\nImmediately after that I went to B. Kova čevac with Žarko Ožegovi ć, and we immediately\n\nwent to the unit stationed near the creak (Commanding officer was Savo Malobabi ć), near\n\nthe unit from Topusko. However, they sent us to the neighbouring unit, which was located\n\nsome 50 m from the house of the miller Grga Mihali ć. I went to the yard of the house with\n\nŽarko where the unit was located, but I cannot remember who the commander of this unit\n\nwas, it is possible that it was Đuro Krivokuća, but I am not sure. The command of that\n\nplatoon which was super ordinate to the two units was in Prkos in the hamlet of Rokinić i,\n\nbut I do not remember who the commander was.\n\nIn that same yard where the elder people were murdered a man who was on sentry duty the\n\nnight when the incident occurred met us, but I do not know his name. I think he had\n\nfreckles and approximately 40-45 years old. First he was with us and later other soldiers\n\nfrom his unit came. 42\n\nHe was very angry and said that they could have been killed in the same way, and was\n\nupset about the way that was handled and asked why all of that had happened. I did not\n\nknow what it was about so I asked him what had happened and he told me that I knew very\n\nwell from the command what was happening and who had done that. I remember that the\n\nCommander of the platoon was a man nicknamed “Keka”, but I do not know exactly if he\n\nhad been present during that incident.\n\nThis blond man then showed me the yard building, which was built of full brick (it was\n\nstanding next to Zlatko Mihali ć’s house), and then he told me that the elder people were\n\nmurdered on the hay in that yard building the previous night. The hay was bloody, and stale\n\nblood was everywhere on the hay and around it up to the well and the top of the well was\n\nalso covered in blood. I think that, any brass automatic weapon bullet cases were lying\n\naround. We approached the well but could not see anything in the well at least nothing that\n\nreminded me of a human corpse.\n\nI remember that a foot was torn off, probably because of an explosion, and it was lying next\n\nto the well or further from it on something, I do not remember where. I do not know if there\n\nwere talks about what to do with the foot, and if it was thrown into the well. I do not\n\nremember if the top of the well was mined, anyway the top was still on the well at that time.\n\nThe two who had been on sentry duty the previous night did not say what had happened\n\nexactly nor if anybody had come and murdered the elder people, but it was evident that they\n\nhad not done it and that they were afraid.\n\nWhen i saw all of that I decided to return to the command of the battalion since the whole\n\ncase was above my authorities, and Žarkovi ć had repeated that these elder people had most\n\nprobably been murdered by Pane Bulat and because of that he had requested a rifle the\n\nprevious night, but I do not remember if these two on sentry duty had mentioned who had\n\nmurdered the elder people since they were evidently frightened and nobody really wanted\n\nto talk about the whole affair.\n\nth\n\nWhen I returned to Lasinja I phoned Simo Rokni ć at the Command of the 19 Brigade (the\n\ncommand was located in Stipan at that time), and reported the entire case to him. I\n\nimmediately told him that Pane Bulat must have murdered the people in Crna Draga and\n\nKovačevac, but at that time I had no evidence about this.\n\nIt was agreed with Roknć i that he secures the caskets for the burial of the Britvec family but\n\nthe brigade did not allow the original factory fabricated caskets to leave the premises of the\n\nbrigade, so that the caskets for the Britvec burial were made at the DIP in Vrginmost from\n\nboards. I have to confess that the command did not allow real caskets because the dead\n\nwere Croats and so the command said that regular caskets would be good enough for their\n\nburial.\n\nMilutin Gledić aka “Gusar” (Pirate) transported the caskets so that the late Britvec family\n\nwas put into these caskets and then take to the cemetery in Crna Draga where they were\n\nburied. At least that is what I heard from Gledi ć. He was born in 1950 –51, his wife used to\n\nwork at the public medical clinic; he was tall, slim and wore a little black beard.\n\nŠimo Roknić from the brigade command told me at the end of our conversation that he\n\nwould keep me informed what steps would be taken in connection to the murder of the old\n\npeople in Kovačevac, but I never heard anything afterwards. I knew the late Grga Mihali ć\n\nvery well and I requested that all measures and actions foreseen in such cases, including an\n\ninsight and an investigation. 43\n\nThe same afternoon the command of the battalion ordered me to go to Sl. Polje in order to\n\ninvestigate who of the soldiers had not returned his personal rifle after he was transferred\n\nfrom one unit to the other and to see how many cases of this happening there were and in\n\nwhich units these soldiers were deployed. Anyway. I was not assigned to that case any\n\nlonger.\n\nThe company from Sl. Polje was stationed in B. Kovač evac for a certain period, and the\n\nsoldiers requested that the old people be taken out of the well. As for Pane, I think that he\n\nused to talk about the event at the inn “Skula” in Gvozd near Mraovi ć when he was drunk,\n\nhe would say that Savo Crevar and I are weak and that he was taking care of things.\n\nAs far as the Britvec burial is concerned, Nikola Britvec aka “Brežan” must certainly know\n\nwhere Ivan and Bara Britvec were buried.\n\nThe blond, tall, large man, who drove the military vehicle 110, must have been the brother\n\nof the Brigade commander Colonel Božo Bijelić ; his name was Dragan Bijeli ć, he was\n\napproximately 45 years old and before the war he was employed at “Autotransport” in\n\nSlunj.\n\nI am willing to give a statement at court in accordance with everything i have stated earlier\n\nbecause I want someone to discover the grave of the elder people and our names cleared.\n\nStatement taken by:\n\nPolice officer\n\nIvan Horvat\n\n(signature)\n\nA NNEX 343:\n\nW ITNESS TSTEMENT OF R.M.\n\nRepublic of Croatia\n\nMinistry of the Interior\n\nKarlovac Police Department\n\nCrime Police Department\n\nSection for control of terrorism\n\nth\n\n27 September 1999\n\nOFFICIAL MEMORANDUM\n\nR.M., macrdnist, born on ... ; UCRN: …; lives in ...,\n\n.... On 23 September he gave the information on the sufferings of 6 older\n\npersons of Croatian nationality in B. Kovačevac on March 1992.\n\nAround noon or a little bit later, we advanced towards Lasinje stronger on the left side.\n\nSoon, we entered both villages, that is to say, hamlets located between Prkos and Lasinje. It\n\nwas only later that I found out they were called Novo Selo Lasinjsko. We had known that\n\nthe villages were abandoned as well as Lasinja itself, so we knew there were going to be no\n\nresistance. The inhabitants left the villages after constant artillery and mortar fire that was\n\ndirected to these villages for a long time before this final attack.\n\nOur troop did not have mortar support, except a mortar battery firing but the battery was\n\nlocated in Crna Draga, which was already in our hands. 44\n\nLeft from us was one unit of “Marti ć’s police”, but we did not know that at the first place.\n\nOnly after we entered one village we saw behind us a unit in the camouflage uniforms\n\nstanding on a hill. That misunderstanding was overcome and then we found out it was a\n\n“Martić’s police unit”. I recognized only one man from the unit, Miloš Vu činić. He was\n\nlater a policeman of the Vrginmost police station. Before the war, he worked in Karlovac,\n\nand was born around 1970. I cannot understand how he got into such “elite unit”, since\n\nbefore the war he was sickly and weak.\n\nAfter several hours, we passed through Novo Selo Lasinjsko and entered the centre of\n\nLasinje. Then, we went down towards Kupa all the way to the bridge and turned left to the\n\nhamlet of Marušići, where was our position for a certain time. We stayed there for some\n\ntime, and then one part was dislocated 300-400 meters left from us. We were in the houses\n\nth\n\nnext to the river of Kupa, to the bridge. (…) On that critical evening, about 20 March\n\n1992, on guard in front of the house in which was our division, were me and Mile\n\nMalobabić, his father was Nikola, because guards were usually doubled, both at night and\n\nby day. They were doubled because we were on the front line, so we were afraid that\n\nsomeone from the Croatian side might surprise us. I remember that exactly between 20.00\n\nand 22.00 hrs there was a shift, but the night had already fallen.\n\nAt some time we heard some loud noise from the direction of the division of Savo\n\nMalobabić, which was about 300 meters distant from us. At that moment we did not know\n\nwhat was it all about, but we thought that some of our men had got drunk, as was usual, so\n\nwe did not pay any attention at all.\n\nUntil that moment we were in normal relations with those old people who lived in that part\n\nof the village, we sometimes brought them some things they needed, and they were\n\nthemselves well off, so that not one of us even thought to touch any of them or to kill them.\n\nOnly later, when all that happened, we found out from the member of Savo Malobabi ć’s\n\ndivision that Pane Bulat and one or two men came, asking for someone to show them where\n\nwere the houses of the remaining Croats in that part of the village, and that 2 men came\n\nwith them, the already mentioned Mile Vu činić and Marko Mamula, so that they helped\n\nthem to pick up the women and take them towards the position of our division, to that\n\nhouse where the well was and where they would kill them later and throw them in (in front\n\nof the house of Zlatko Mihalić).\n\nWhile I was on guard, I did not see that either Pane or anyone else came to this house\n\nwhere there was a well with a vehicle, but I did not pay much attention to the whole thing.\n\nAt the same time when they brought those old people from below, from the direction of\n\nSavo Malobabi ć’s division one or two men separated from the group, I do not know\n\nwhether one of them was Pane, and they left about 100 meters down the road and brought\n\nthe old Grga Mihali ć and his wife, and the rest of the group stayed with the women on the\n\nspot where they would later liquidate them.\n\nAfter that, Pane and another man went towards our division, and one man came to the\n\nhouse (the bricked one) just to our left, and that man thumped on the house asking to open\n\nthe door, because in that house lived an old woman. Pane turned towards the house, he had\n\nalready left directly to our division and went down to the cellar of the house, I do not know\n\nwhat he said inside, or whom he talked to. Neither did we on the guard pay very much\n\nattention to all that, because it was almost daily that some of our men would get drunk and\n\nwould make scenes, it became quite normal. 45\n\nPane did not spent much time in the cellar where our division was stationed, and he went\n\ntowards the house where the rest of the old people were, and the other man that was with\n\nhim a moment before took those women for whom he came.\n\nAt the time when the whole thing was going on, I did not even know that it was Pane Bulat,\n\nbut I found it out only when my shift finished, after 22.00 hrs, after I went down in the\n\ncellar where the rest of the members of the division were. Actually, I realized that it was\n\nPane only later when I heard the noise of that group that kept together the old people and I\n\nrecognized him because of his voice.\n\nI think that the old people were not being tortured and beaten for long before they were\n\nliquidated, but what I heard was that they were interrogating them where the weapons were.\n\nAt one moment I heard a machine-gun burst, and a longer one, it must have been AP\n\nkalashnikov, and then the individual shots from pistols, or scorpions that our security had,\n\nand also Pane had it. At the beginning of the burst I heard only one howl, that is a cry and I\n\nwill never forget it, and after that nothing could be heard, that is no sign of crying for help.\n\nA few minutes after the fire, I heard an argument between Pane Bulat and Đuro Čeko, who\n\nat that time was a member of the engineer platoon with our batallion, so they were stationed\n\nwith us in the school in Lasinja, and they had an argument because Pane was asking, drunk\n\nas he was, that the well be mined. Đuro refused it and he soon got to our division and\n\ntelephoned from the cellar to the commands in Lasinja. I heard from the soldiers that he\n\nwas asking for anyone, but that no-one was “accidently” there and that he returned right\n\nback.\n\nAs I have already said, I heard later that only Marko Mamula was directly present when the\n\nmurder happened together with Đuro Čeko and Pane Bulat. I am absolutely sure about\n\nthem, and there were probably one or two men with them, but I do not know who these men\n\nwere. I think that Mile Vučinić was not with them.\n\nAfter all had calmed down, me and Mile Malobabi ć changed shifts with some other men,\n\nbut I do not remember who replaced us. After I went down into the cellar, after some time\n\ntwo strong explosions were heard, and I only found out in the morning that one explosion\n\nwas caused in the well and that the “crown” of the well had been destroyed in which the old\n\npeople were thrown, and the other explosion was caused in the house on the hill to the left,\n\nif you are looking towards the division of Savo Malobabi ć, and in the house from which a\n\nmoment before one of the old women who got killed, was taken out.\n\nOn the next morning the commander of the platoon – Milan Džakula came to our division\n\nasking what had happened.\n\nThe colleague that was with me on guard the other night, Mile Malobabi ć, was very angry\n\nin the morning because he, together with 2 soldiers had slept in the neighbouring house,\n\nnext to the one in which we were in the cellar. He was in that house in one of the rooms,\n\nbecause it was drier there, and in the cellar in which we were was pretty damp and stuffy.\n\nThey had probably been in bed already, when those two explosions resounded and they\n\nmust have been scared, so Mile said that they could have got killed also, because those\n\nengineers could have mined this house also. Those two explosions were surely caused by\n\nthe engineers, only I do not know whether Đuro Čeko was the only one involved, or if this\n\nneighbour R .M., was also with him.\n\nI do not remember whether S.Č. from the security was there that morning, but he\n\nprobably was. 46\n\nI did not go right on the first day in that backyard to see what it looked like, after the old\n\npeople were killed, I was there only 2 or 3 days later, when all had been cleared up.\n\nOn that first, or the second day, Pane Bulat came to our division and asked specifically for\n\nme and Mile Malobabi ć, and he asked particularly for the people who were on that critical\n\nnight on guard, when those old people were killed, he called us aside and told us that we\n\ndid not hear or see anything. Me and Mile told him that we really had not seen anything,\n\nbut I heard there a burst and a conversation, individual shots and a cry, as I have already\n\nsaid. He did not actually ask for us to keep our mouths shut if we were to be officially\n\ninterrogated. It was immediately clear to both of us that he was the one who did that, but we\n\nkept silent and minded, as they say, our own business.\n\nI knew Đorđe Samardžija, called “ Đoko “, only by sight, he was a driver and he usually\n\ndrove a 110, but in those critical days I had not seen him with Pane, so I do not know\n\nwhether he was in the group that liquidated those old people on that night.\n\nI know that pulling out of the bodies was organized by Pane Bulat, and he brought Adam\n\nSamardžija for that from Crevarska Strana, and that one went down into the well a few\n\ntimes. I know that on this pulling out of the bodies the late Đuro Krivokuća worked, our\n\ncommander of the division, Mirko Malobabi ć, but I think that he stayed only for a day, and\n\nthe already mentioned Adam Samardžija.\n\nOn that first evening Adam Samardžija stayed and slept with us in the cellar of the house\n\nwhere our division was, and we protested how could such a dirty man sleep with us at all.\n\nOn the next morning, A. Samardžija said that he could no longer do this job, and that he\n\nwould not go down into the well any more. I do not know how his conversation exactly\n\nended with Pane Bulat, but I think that he stayed behind us. That is, on that very day, there\n\nwas a shift in our position and we were replaced by a unit from Brnjavci, and I think that\n\nsome of its soldiers participated in the pulling out of bodies. Later I heard that one man had\n\nbeen brought from Bovići or Kozarac so that he would pull out the remaining old ones from\n\nthe well because Adam did not want to do that any more.\n\nI know, and I am absolutely sure that the late Đuro Krivokuća did not stay pulling out the\n\nbodies from the well, except that he had pulled them out on the first day, but he went with\n\nus, the other members of our division and he came back on a truck to Sl. Polje. I have not\n\nknown until now that Milan Džakula, called “Keka”, had also been pulling out the bodies\n\nfrom the well.\n\nConsidering this unit from Brnjavci, I know only that their platoon commander was Pero\n\nMiličević, I mean the platoon that was directly in our shift and on our part of the line.\n\nI have heard that one body had been set on fire in the hayloft right behind the backyard of\n\nthe house where the well into which they were thrown, stood, it could have been the body\n\nof the late Grga Mihalić , himself, and I remember that during this taking out of bodies\n\nexactly that one hayloft was set on fire, but I am not familiar with anything that has to do\n\nwith this event.\n\nI do not know how this pulling out of the bodies ended, but next time when we went to the\n\nshift of that unit from Brnjevci, the bodies had already been pulled out, but I do not know\n\nwhere they were buried because nobody talked about that.\n\nIf it will be necessary, I am ready to give a statement before the investigating judge.\n\nStatement taken by police officer:\n\nIvan Horvat (signature) 47\n\nA NNEX 344:\n\nW ITNESS SATEMENT OF M.Š.\n\nREPUBLIC OF CROATIA\n\nMINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR\n\nPOLICE ADMINISTRATION KARLOV AC\n\nPOLICE STATION SLUNJ\n\nDate: 15 March 1993\n\nM .Š., son of P.

Marko Pemper, Ana Malko, Ljubomir\n\nHodak, Filip Šebalj called “Pilja Ban”, Franja Brozin čević, Mira Brozin čević called\n\n“Seka”, Marija Brozin čević called “Beba”, Katarina Cindrć nee Pemper, Juraj Šebalj,\n\nBarbara Vuković called “Basa”, Ana Pemper, Milan Smol čić, Juraj Conjar called “Jura\n\nVečera”, Mate Brozin čević, Roža Brozin čević called “Roja”, Mirko Brozin čević called\n\n“Čojo” and me stayed behind in the village Lipovač a. None of us was either a member of\n\nsome military formation or armed.\n\nThe enemy army passed through our village every day, visited us, listed us, interrogated us\n\nand moved on further. One day, they took several of us men by a military truck to the house\n\nof Kotur Nedjeljko called “Ne đo” in the village Grabovac where we had to pull out 4 cows\n\nthat were consumed by fire from his cowshed and we had to bury them behind the house.\n\nAfter that, we did domestic work at our homes every day and we repaired roofs on several\n\nhouses that were damathd by grenades during combats that took place in the village. In the\n\nmorning on October 28 1991, my sister-in-law A.M. came to my house and told me\n\nthat she found everything opened in the house of Franja Brozinčević and that at Mate\n\nBrozinčević’s house, that is in the house, she heard some noise when passing in front of the\n\nwindow.\n\nSince we found it suspicious that there wasn’t anybody at Franja Brozin čević’s, A.\n\nM. and me went together to Franja’s house and as Ana was the first one who opened\n\nthe door of the old house, we noticed Franja Brozičević, Mira Brozin čević Mira called\n\n“Seka” (Franja’s wife), Marija Brozin čević called “Beba” (Franja’s mother-in-law) and\n\nKatarina Cindrić nee Brozinčević (Franja’s sister) lying dead in the house. We went outside\n\nthe house out of fear right away, Aelt sick so she washed her face in a little pool and we\n\nwent from there to A .’s house, we pulled ourselves together and went to say Mate\n\nBrozinčević what had happened at Franja’s. When we arrived in Mate’s house, A . also\n\nopened the door first and we saw the dead Mate Brozin čević (he was sitting at the table on\n\na chair), Roža Brozin čević – Mate’s wife (she was sitting in the corner on a chair), and\n\nMirko Brozinčević – son of Mate and Roža (with half of his body under the table). Then\n\nA .M. and me ran out of fear to a bush above the village and we met a neighbour\n\nMilan Smolčić who did not believe us, so he went by himself and when he came back to us\n\nto the bush, he confirmed that all of that was true and he said to us that he was going to the\n\nvillage to inform Barbara Vuković and the others, but he did not return to us. After the\n\nnight fell, and it was very cold, Aand me came down to A. ’s house where we\n\nspent the night until 05,00 a.m. when w e went through the wood called “Duman” to\n\nTržačka (ILLEGIBLE) and then to Tržac, municipality of Cazin where found many of our 48\n\nneighbours and Milan Smol čić, Barbara Vukovi ć, Ana Pemper, Juraj Šebalj and Juraj\n\nConjar stayed in the village after we left, and after the New Year we heard from I\n\nŠ. called “B.” that all of them were killed and set on fire in the v illage and that Dušan\n\nRistić called “Bikan”, a tradesman from Lipovača, told that to I.\n\nIn connectio with this statement I have nothing further to state or to add.”\n\nAuthorised official:\n\nJOSO BERTOVIĆ\n\nANNEX 345:\n\nW ITNESS SATEMENT OF I.Š.\n\nREPUBLIC OF CROATIA\n\nMINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR\n\nKARLOVAC POLICE ADMINISTRATION\n\nSLUNJ POL ICE STATION\n\nNumber: 511-05-40/3-1-K-48/92.\n\nDate: 30 March 1993\n\nOFFICIAL RECORD\n\nCitizen I.Š., the son of F. is a worker and was born on ...;\n\nperma nent address: …; residence address:…; on 28 March 1993, at the accommodation of\n\nthe Karlovac police administration, in relation to his stay in the area of the municipalities\n\nSlunj and Cazin, he gave an authorized official, the following information:\n\n“After the occupation of the village of Lipovač a, Slunj municipality, I ran away, together\n\nwith my family, to Trža čka Raštela, in the middle of November. While I stayed there I\n\nwould come to Trža čka Raštela, to the weekly fair, every Wednesday, in order to find out\n\nwhat was happening in the village of Lipova ča. At the end of January 1992 I met Dušan\n\nRistić called “Bikan”, a shopkeeper in Lipovača, in Tržačka Raštela, who told me that some\n\npeople from Lipovača were burnt in their houses. Further on in the conversation with Dušan\n\nRistić I found out that Juraj Šebalj, the son of Ivan, born in 1926, on 31 December 1991\n\nbought a litre of brandy in Dušan Ristić’s store and invited his neighbour Jovan Ristić, who\n\nwas a Serb, to come and have a drink of brandy with him. Jovan didn’t accept his invitation\n\nand Jure went alone to his house and later on, in the evening, he went to Ana Pemper’s\n\nhouse to spend New Year’s Eve there. Barabara Vukovi ć joined them to celebrate New\n\nYear’s Eve with them. Just before midnight, according to Dušan Ristić, Ana Pemeper’s\n\nhouse was in fire and when Dušan came out of his house to see what was happening he\n\nheard someone crying for help in Ana’s house, but Dušan didn’t dare to go near the house\n\nbecause he was afraid that someone would kill him. He also saw that Jura Conjar’s house\n\nwas burning.\n\nEarly in the morning on New Year’s Day Dušan saw that the houses of Ana Pemper and\n\nJura Conjar were completely burnt, and he also told me that the following people burnt in\n\nthe house of Ana Pemper: Ana Pemper, born Krznari ć, born in 1930, from Lipovača no. 53,\n\nBarbara Vuković, born Krznarić, born in 1931, from Lipova ča no. 69, and Jura Šebalj, the\n\nson of Ivan, born in 1926, from Lipova ča no. 63, and in the house of Jura Conjar the\n\nfollowing people were burnt: Jura Conjar, the son of Margareta, born in 1932, from\n\nLipovača no. 47, and Milan Smol čić, the son of Nikola, born in 1934, from Lipoča no. 49\n\n45. Dušan Ristić didn’t describe how the houses were set on fire or people were burnt, also\n\nhe didn’t say who could have done it and whether the burnt people were buried afterwards\n\nof left on the site of fire.\n\nI don’t have anything more to add in relation to this statement.\n\nAuthorized official:\n\nJoso Bertović\n\nA NNEX 346:\n\nW ITNESS SATEMENT OF M P.\n\nSURNAME: P.\n\nNAME, FATHER’S NAME: M., M.\n\nYEAR AND PLACE OF BIRTH: ..., ..., Slunj county, Croatia\n\nRESIDENCE: …\n\nTEMPORARY RESIDENCE: …\n\nEDUCATION:\n\nOCCUPATION: farmer\n\nEMPLOYMENT:\n\nMARITAL STATUS: married\n\nCITIZENSHIP: Republic of Croatia\n\nNATIONALITY: Croat\n\nI give the following\n\nSTATEMENT\n\nThe army encircled us. There was no escape. We became their hostages. First the soldiers\n\narrived dressed in uniforms with the five pointed star symbol (the JNA uniform). After\n\nthem the “SAO Krajina” (Serbian Autonomous Municipality) police arrived. They came\n\nfrom the direction of Lika, and barged into La đevci on their way to Slunj. They barged into\n\nour village with tanks. My grandson and I were at my daughter’s place, we were feeding\n\nthe cattle. Two men armed with rifles approached us. They enquired if there was any army\n\nin the village. They also said that they were not going to harm civilians. They asked if there\n\nwere Ustashas. I said that there were no Ustashas in the village. They ordered my grandson\n\nto go out of the house. The child was terribly frightened. Then they left. After half an hour\n\nthey ordered us all to gather in front of Ante Samardžija’s house. When we gathered they\n\ntold us that the army from Lađ evci would come to interrogate us. They enquired if we had\n\nany arms. We told them that we did not. Then they said that those people they point fingers\n\nat must go out. They singled out five men and took them to the training ground. Those men\n\nwere Slavo Potnar, Vinko Samardžija, Zvonko Potnar, Slavo Klobu čar and Nikola\n\nSamardžija. I do not know why they chose them. They mentally maltreated them and asked\n\nthem if any of them had relatives in the army. They did not beat them. Later they took them\n\nback home.\n\nLater there were the others who maltreated us. The “SAO Krajina police” would come\n\nevery day. I did not know any of those who came.\n\nOne day, my little grandson told me that the army was arriving. I was sitting at the table\n\nand rolling a cigarette. They barged into the house, and asked me what I was doing, how\n\nmany children I had and what their names were. I answered that I had three children and 50\n\nthat their names are T ., K. and I. I was scared. My wife said something. They\n\nordered her to be quiet. They told us that they were used to pulling teeth without anesthesia,\n\nflaying skin and many other horrible things. They told her that they would gouge her eyes\n\nout, pull her teeth and cut off her nose. They ransacked the place but did not take anything.\n\nThey told me to get ready and go with them. They took me to Gri či and ordered me to look\n\nwhat was under the brambles. They ordered me to pick up thorny branches with bare hands.\n\nThen they forced me to go up there and said they would follow me. One of them said: “We\n\ndid not bring him here to look at him. He is not your brother, take him out, and join us\n\nlater.” They left and the one who remained said that he never even killed an ant, that he was\n\ngoing to fire over my head, and then I could run home. That is how he saved my life. They\n\ncame almost every day and maltreated us.\n\nOn November 7, 1992, they killed our neighbor Slavo Klobučar in front of his house.\n\nOn February 17, 1993, they killed our uncle.\n\nIn June a year will have passed since they killed Dane Bogović.\n\nNikola Vukojević from Slušnica (he himself was killed later) killed Slavo Klobu čar, and\n\nMile Pašić killed Dane Bogović.\n\nAll of those murders happened during the presence of UNPROFOR forces in the area,\n\nhowever, the UNPROFOR representatives were strictly forbidden to make contact with us,\n\nduring which time the Serbian militia could freely move around and do whatever they\n\nwanted. We were obliged to have permits in order to freely move around the area. If one\n\nwas caught without the permit, you were killed on the spot. Permits were issued by the head\n\nof the police, Ljuban Klipa. Only fifteen Croats have remained in the area. They are mostly\n\nelderly people. The Army entered La đevci several days after the fall of Slunj. Slunj fell on\n\nNovember 16th or 17th, 1991.\n\nAmong the Serbs who used to come to our village I recognized a man called Tepovac... He\n\nwas a member of the “SAO Krajina” militia. He was good to us, but I heard that he did\n\nawful things to people. They looted whatever they found: livestock, wheat, money... If they\n\nfound out that somebody had sold his cattle they would come at night, masked, threaten\n\nhim with a knife, beat him up and take all his money. People tried to complain to their\n\nmilitia, but they claimed that the perpetrators were not under their jurisdiction. They\n\nclaimed that their people would never do such a thing.\n\nWe did not have any money. The shops in Slunj were open, but only people who had\n\nmoney could buy anything. We used to sell an egg or two and buy ourselves a box of\n\nmatches or a packet of cigarettes.\n\nThere were more than a hundred houses in La đevci. Some thirty houses were burnt down.\n\nThey set them on fire day and night. We did not know who was doing this because we were\n\nnot allowed to come close. They drove off their spoils on tractors and trucks. The looters\n\ncame from Slušnica, Bro ćanac, Paši ć, Mandi ć, Stara Kršlja, Kordunski Ljeskovac and\n\nPrimišlje. They also wore uniforms. Everybody wore uniforms, regardless of their age.\n\nThey were constantly drunk. They were pulling down hay-barns and stole things.\n\nOur local church was destroyed in June of 1992. The tower took direct mortar hits, or some\n\nother artillery pieces. The pews were burnt down. The altar pieces were broken. The\n\nsacristy was totally destroyed. No representative of their “government” came to see this.\n\nThe church in Slunj was also destroyed during an attack. 51\n\nOnly the following Croats have remained in Slunj: Ivan Matanić , Vera Mo ćan, Marija\n\nMaović, Lovre Flanjak, Jelka Mladušan and Mara Obajdir. Earlier, Croats were the\n\nmajority of the population in Slunj. The Slunj authorities demanded from us to obtain\n\naffidavits in order to leave the village. At the Red Cross Headquarters we had to sign the\n\npaper stating we were not going to return. The UNPROFOR knows about these documents,\n\nfor they are the ones who bring them to the Red Cross Headquarters and then we have to\n\nsign them. Who does not sign cannot leave. By this document we leave all of our estates to\n\nthe “Republic of Krajina”. The document stays with them. Mile Miloševi ć is the president\n\nof Slunj county. Their Orthodox priest works at the Red Cross. He came recently. His wife\n\nused to work here before, but she moved to Serbia, so he came to replace her. Their church\n\nremained untouched. There is a daily service. Their people freely go to the church, and the\n\nCroats have no church to go to.\n\nI had oxen. Two unknown men came to me and asked me would I sell them my oxen. It\n\nwas before we came here. I sold them the oxen for 700 German Marks and they left. Next\n\nevening the masked men came and asked me for money. They knew that I sold the cattle\n\nand that I had money. I had to give them the money in order to stay alive. The following\n\nmorning the UNPROFOR came to pick us up.\n\nI had a completely furnished house, a hay-barn, a shed, a maize barn, eight acres of\n\nagricultural land, a wagon, two cars, and a mower. My son had his own house.\n\nIn Karlovac, May 18, 1993\n\nStatement given by: M.P.\n\nStatement taken by: Andrija Pavičić\n\nA NNEX 347:\n\nW ITNESS SATEMENT OF M G.\n\nThe statement of M.G. about the events in the village of Donji La đevac in\n\nthe period between 16 November 1991 and 23 July 1993.\n\nMynameisM .G. (the son of N. ). I was born on... in ...\n\nwhere I lived with my family. I anot employed, we lived off agriculture. …, the\n\nno. of the identification card: …. I give the following\n\nSTATEMENT\n\nAt the time of occupation of the Donji La đevac area, approximately 20 villagers stayed in\n\nthe village. Mostly they were older people and there were also two minors. When Slunj and\n\nLađevac were conquered, the active army, in which there were also the villagers of the\n\nSerbian villages of Bro čanac, Slušnica, Furjani, and Primišalj, stationed with their\n\ncommand in La đevac. First a group of approximately five unknown and armed men in\n\ncamouflage uniforms came to the village to list us. They took away with them five of the\n\nvillagers: SLAVO POTNAR, ZVONKO POTNAR, VINKO SAMARDŽIJA, NIKOLA\n\nSAMARDŽIJA and SAVO KLOBU ČAR to the millitary artillery range in Slunj and they\n\nreturned on the evening of the same day.\n\nThese first couple of days they were searching for weapons. We told them we didn’t have\n\nany weapons, and they said that they would check it. After that, in a five day period, three\n\nmen came to my house, they pointed their guns at me asking from me to give them my\n\nweapons. One of them, quite a big man, hit me with his fist in the chest, and it hurt me for a 52\n\nlong time. After that I went to dug out a gun that I had. They didn’t let me dig it out with a\n\npick but I had to use my fingers and dig out earth and stones that were frozen. I went with\n\nthem to ZVONKO POTNAR’s house. They also asked him to give them his weapons and\n\nhit him. After that he gave them his gun. One of them trod on his body saying that he had\n\nbetter give them the rest of the weapons. After that we went to PAVO CVITKOVI Ć’s\n\nhouse and they also asked him to give them his weapons, but they didn’t beat him. They left\n\nme in the house and they went to La đevac. So they would come to villages every day and\n\nrob the houses where there weren’t any people. I remember that the following time they\n\nmolested me three unknown men came, it was the winter of 1992. They came to ask for\n\nweapons once again. Two of them were searching through the house and the third stayed\n\nwith me. He had a knife on his gun and he kept saying that he was going to butcher me. He\n\nasked me about my sons and the weapons. They took things from the house and left me\n\nalone.\n\nIn the spring and summer of 1992 no one beat me. I would hide when I saw someone\n\ncoming. In November 1992 SLAVO KLOBU ČAR was killed. In the house were his father,\n\nMILE POTNAR, and ANTE SAMARDŽIJA. According to MILE POTNAR, three of them\n\ncame. They beat the father, and killed the son Slavo. After that UNPROFOR took the father\n\nto the Glina hospital where the old man died.\n\nIn February 1993 PAVE SAMARDŽIJA was killed. He was killed in the yard of JELENA\n\nCVITKOVIĆ’s house where he sawed wood. On the following day PAVO DELA Č and I\n\nwent to see what happened and saw him lying dead in the yard. We saw that he was cut on\n\nthe neck, and he also had a hole in the head where they shot at him. I only know that a man\n\nwhose name was MANDIĆ from Furjani was a commander for some time.\n\nAt the end if 1993 no one molested me, but I was constantly afraid and I was hiding all the\n\ntime. We were told on more occasions that we wouldn’t see Croatia, so I was afraid. I came\n\nto Karlovac on 23 July 1993. On that day approximately 53 persons came to Karlovac.\n\nBy signing each page of this statement M .G. guarantees its authenticity, that is,\n\nguarantees that the statement is not given under coercion and that the written form of the\n\nstatement is identical to what MG. has said.\n\nIn Karlovac, 2 November 1993\n\nThe statement is given by:\n\nM .G.\n\nThe statement is taken by:\n\nGordana Predović 53\n\nANNEX 348:\n\nW ITNESS TSTEMENT OF A.K.\n\nStatement of A.
