        "text": "On October 12 2016. Bojana Videkanić was holding the “Misplaced Women?” sign on the Pearson International Airport in Toronto and was diving into her profoundly touching memories about her initiation into the life of a refugee escaping Sarajevo siege in 1992 and her and her family life as refuges in the UK, Croatia and Canada. She wrote about it:\n\nMissing Women: Some Thoughts As to Why I Became Missing While Waiting for Tanja Ostojić\n\nBy Bojana Videkanić\n\nLast year I invited Tanja Ostojić to present her work at the 7a*11d International Performance Art Festival in Toronto. As one of the members of the Toronto Performance Art Collective, I have been wanting to invite Tanja to come to our festival for some time. She generously accepted and came in October 2016. In our conversations and planning prior to her arrival, Tanja asked me to help her by doing a specific action when she landed in Toronto. She asked me to create a sign and hold it while waiting for her at the Pearson International Airport. She told me that the sign should read: “Misplaced Women” which is also the title of Tanja’s piece that she was going to perform on October 16 at a tram stop downtown Toronto at the corner of McCaul and Dundas streets. Tanja gave me a choice to, if I wanted to, put a question mark at the end of the statement. I was happy to do the action and I made the sign, deciding to put a question mark at the end. My choice to do so was guided by the fact that Pearson is a large and busy place and I suspected that the sign will be noticed if I keep it ambiguous. I, however, was not considering the impact Tanja’s work would have on me.\n\nThe day came and I arrived 30 or so minutes earlier in order to keep the action a bit longer, to give it some time to play out. While standing there at the international arrivals gate, I had some time to think about the action I was performing (standing in the middle of the great airport hall with an ambiguous sign in my hands) and what its ramifications might be. There were a couple of important thoughts I had that came about as a result. First, throughout my action I realized that I was initiating Tanja’s performance, as it became obvious that my interactions with the accidental audiences were a catalyst for a discussion around borders, policing of bodies, and (in)visible violence of that. In short, I realized that Tanja’s performance has begun as people gawked at me. Secondly, I realized the echoes of Tanja’s work in our ‘local’ Canadian context with the missing and murdered indigenous women, and the impact it had in the light of Syrian crisis and the inability of the world actors to see the refugees as human beings. What I did not expect was my own physical reaction to the sign and the moment as I became missing in it.\n\nIt became obvious at that moment that the sign “Missing Women” was not about some other missing women (although of course it is about many thousands if not millions of them) but that it was also about my own experiences of borders and violence. It brought me back some 20+ years back to 1992, and my 15-year-old self, a confused, frightened child who, in a matter of few weeks between April 6 and April 20 1992, became a refugee. At the time I did not know what that meant, but I learned quickly. When my hometown of Sarajevo came under siege and the first grenades fell, my desperate, naïve parents wanted to save me, to protect me, so they found a way to put me on one of the last planes leaving the city to go to Belgrade and then on to London, England. I will never forget the scene of desperation at the Sarajevo Airport as hundreds and hundreds of people gathered to try to get their small children, parents and other family onto Kikash military plains. Pleading with important-looking military officers, with their long lists of people’s names, to let them through––crying, begging, consoling, desperate. Through some miracle my parents managed to get me on one of those lists and on one of the planes. They gave me a few of our family photos (so that I wound not forget them and where I come from), my mom lovingly packed my sinus medication and some clothes, and told me that I will be back at the end of the summer when the war will be over, and with my English much improved. And so I went, with my grey, Yugoslav child passport (which in fact was no longer valid as we were living through the breakup of the country), 500 deutsche marks, my photos, and a book. As Kikash plane lifted off (in fact this was my very first time being on the plane) I sat on the floor of its enormous belly with a couple of hundred other people not really knowing where I was going and what will happen to me when I get there. I was all alone, a child who never travelled without her parents, going to some unknown future.\n\nThree days later I was on a plane ride to London, England with another boy, a son of my parents’ friends. The two of us were going to his aunt who accepted to take me in for the short period until I was to return home to Sarajevo. As the airplane approached Heathrow airport I became very anxious and scared. We landed and I was immediately detained by the UK customs and immigration. I was held in an interrogation room for six hours. I had to take all my clothes out of my bag, they took my family photos and asked me about each person in the photo and where they were, they asked me about my sinus medication, about how much clothes I had, and why I was travelling, do I know what is happening to my country? They even asked me about Ernest Hemingway’s “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” the one book that I managed to take out of my parents’ library as I was leaving (the book I cannot bring myself to read again). It is hard to describe that feeling of being helpless, of being at the mercy of people in uniform, and especially being that way as a child. Like a caged animal my heart pounded, I was shaking, and I cried. I cried as all those things that the immigration officers looked through were really the last things that I could say were mine, these were the last remnants of my childhood, of my family life, and of my country, even those darn sinus pills… My entire life on display, my entire life in one suitcase, now an object of conversation for immigration officers, and evidence of my status.\n\nFinally, I was let through, they decided that my friend’s aunt who waited for us was credible. This was my initiation into the life of a refugee. From that moment on, I moved with my suitcase from family to family, twice in London (during the 2 month stay there), and some ten times later on when I lived as a refugee in Croatia. At one point while still in London, I was supposed to be moved for the third time with an unknown woman, but when that did not work out the people with whom I was staying decided that I should be given over to the Child Services (as having a 15-year old in the house was too much for them). I couch-surfed most of the time, slept in peoples’ baby rooms next to their kids’ cribs, in their master bedrooms on the floor, in spare rooms, living rooms, all kinds of rooms. I learned to hold my pee in so that I would not have to be in the bathroom when owners of the house were in the house. I learned to take fast showers, I learned to eat when no one was looking (usually late at night). I learned how to walk without making a sound, how to use a hand towel, soap, shampoo, or kitchen utensils so that they would look like no one has used them. I learned to be sparing with creams, food, cookies so that it would not look like someone has eaten them. I learned to be invisible, how not to be noticed by police, by men, by security. I learned how to pack my bag quickly so that I can move out fast. I learned that refugees are not welcomed, that we are perceived as a burden, not just to the state and all its mechanisms, but often to extended families, friends, and even do-gooders who think that they can take in refugees into their home but cannot deal with someone actually living with them, taking their space.\n\nI, however, also met some amazing people on the way, selfless, caring people like my mom’s friend who took me and my family in with her son for four months. Or like a doctor from the Doctors Without Borders who I met on the street and in our conversation I told him that my parents are doctors in Sarajevo and that I was not sure if they are dead or alive as all the phone lines were down and I did not speak to them in two months. He told me that he will find my parents as he was going back to Sarajevo and deliver my letter. And he did! (that was how my parents found out I was ok and alive).\n\nFinally, I also learned that my parents were broken by the war, the strong, independent people I knew before April 1992 were now broken physically, mentally, and professionally. When both my parents came out of the besieged Sarajevo (my mom at the end of 1992, and my dad at the end of 1994) and when we lived as refugees in Croatia awaiting papers to immigrate to Canada or Australia, I saw my parents waiting in line for food donations, for refugee status, clothes, aid, they were lost and defeated, depressed. My dad has severe PTSD which was never dealt with. The defeat only continued when we came to Canada, when my parents had difficulty learning English, not being able to find a job, being too old to go to school (early-to mid 50s) but too young to retire, struggling; my father going to a local Food Bank getting food, working on construction site as a construction worker, my mom working with developmentally disabled adults and being attacked and bitten. Yes, standing there at the arrivals gate at Pearson Airport became an embodied performance of myself missing and my parents missing. I was that 15-year old kid again, trying to find myself.\n\nFinally, another important thought I had at that moment of waiting for Tanja, as I had some confused looks from passersby, was that people could recognize the signs, they could recognize the ambiguity of what Tanja was stating. Several people stopped and asked what the sign was about. One man came around as asked where are these misplaced women? He was confused… I replied that it was a part of Tanja Ostojić’s art work relating it to refugees and migrant women, but also used the opportunity to address a more pressing Canadian context of Missing and Murdered Indigenous women and the current inquiry into this tragedy (https://www.nwac.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/\n\nFact_Sheet_Missing_and_Murdered_Aboriginal_Women_and_Girls.pdf). A female security guard came to me asking about the sign, she approached and said, ”You know you will get a lot of people asking about the sign,” “they will think you might have some answers for them…” Then she said, “you know, I am misplaced too…” These interactions with the security, passersby, people who wait for family and friends, and being at the airport, opened up a whole other conversation about invisibility of violence, of invisibility and visibility of women who are marginalized, who are placed at the mercy of governmental mechanisms, police, immigration, child welfare, welfare and unemployment services, ministry of Indigenous affairs, lawyers, immigration courts. It became clear then that this performance was placing an ethical and moral obligation on the passersby as it directly asked them to confront the question/statement on the sign I made for Tanja.\n\nI write this as the Syrian refugees are fleeing their country just like I did 20+ years ago. I write this as Trump has barred people from entering US, I write this as frozen refugee claimants are crossing the US/Canada border at -40˚C, I write this as an official Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women is just taking place 40+ years in, I write this as hundreds of unaccompanied minor children are prevented from entering UK (as the government stopped its program to help them,) I write this as women and children are still going missing––no questions asked… Tanja Ostojic’s performance which asks that question is therefore more important then ever. Standing in the crowd with a sign “Missing Women?” at this moment becomes an ethical and moral confrontation, one that troubles the age of invisibility. And at a time of alternative truths, the truth of those who are marginalized truth is the one that matters, and only one that cannot be erased in the swamp we call the Internet.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nBojana Videkanić is an artist, art historian and curator.

Not because I want to keep it a secret, but because the reason was kept secret from us too.\n\nThe first thing the border protection officer found in Monty’s shoulder bag were a few loose pages of notes, including four sheets with nothing written on them. Apparently, this was immediate cause for suspicion, as the officer said, “These four pieces of paper don’t have writing on them. Why are you carrying four blank pieces of paper?”\n\nAll of a sudden, everything we carried was suspect and seemed to pose some threat to the U.S.: “Why is this soap this colour?” “You only need this tiny container for hair gel?” “You’re telling me you wear these pants for fashion? I don’t believe you.”\n\nMaybe we got turned away at the border because the officer looked in Monty’s exercise log book and smirked: “You do a hundred push-ups a day? Well, this guy [indicating to another officer] does a thousand.”\n\nOr maybe we were detained at the border because the border protection officer couldn’t fathom why we would be making music and art on vacation. He demanded to know: “Why would you be making music on vacation?” When I asked what he meant, he explained: “When I go on vacation, I go shopping; I go to shows; I don’t make music.”\n\nWe sat in a waiting room for a long time through the night. We were each brought alone into a small room to have our mugshots and fingerprints taken, surrounded by four or five officers. We were interrogated separately about each other’s affairs, and questioned about our involvement with countries in the Middle East. Waiting is especially stressful when you don’t know what you are waiting for — maybe what happens next will be worse than the suspense of waiting. We already knew we couldn’t enter the U.S., but imagination gives way to all sorts of nauseating outcomes that make the wait even more excruciating.\n\nAn officer stood watch over us in the waiting room, his eyes fixated on old reruns of American Dad playing on the TV. I got the sense that these border protection officers really enjoy their jobs, especially the power they get from intimidating others, making people feel flustered and vulnerable.\n\nThen suddenly, with no explanation, we were told to go. How did they come to that decision? What did they find out from their computers? What had they decided about us? What sort of threat did they think we posed? What will happen the next time we try to cross the border?\n\nIt bothers me that we were not given any explanation. It bothers me that we can not refute anything because we were not given anything to refute. It bothers me that the border protection officers obviously made the decision to deny us entry before they even finished their investigation, so that it’s very likely that there was no reason of why we were denied entry other than the officer’s distaste for the art objects in Monty’s suitcase.\n\nNot that reason seems to matter anymore. I’m just glad we could go free, and that our lives didn’t depend on this crossing. I can only imagine how horrific it is to leave your fate in the hands of border protection.\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nAubergine Kartoffeln is Toronto based social worker and artist\n\nIstvan Kantor alias Monty Cantsin is Toronto based artist of Hungarian origin\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nPlease reed as well the related article by Sarah Ferguson who interviewed Istvan Kantor related to the denial of the freedom of movement on the U.S. Buffalo Border:\n\nhttp://thevillager.com/2016/12/23/rivington-school-propagandist-monty-cantsin-held-at-u-s-border/\n\nShe wrote that according to Istvan Kantor, the agents in Buffalo, NYC, became alarmed when they found sealed packages of hypodermic needles in his luggage. Kantor is renowned for his “blood art” — using his own blood to splatter walls in museums like the MoMA to protest the “commodification” of art — and has been arrested numerous times both here and abroad.\n\nHe says the customs agents were also irked by the megaphone bearing Kantor’s trademark “Neoism” slogan, along with his Nazi-like cap, Chinese security armbands and red flag — all props for the satirical performances he planned to stage.\n\nAlthough Kantor has been detained at the border before, he says he’s had no trouble coming into the U.S. in the last three years. But this was different.\n\n“They took me and my girlfriend to a special room for fingerprints and mugshots,” he said, “and that’s where the more serious questioning began — especially about my travels in China,” where Kantor has been teaching multimedia art. “They wanted to know if I had visited Pakistan, Libya, Palestine and other Middle Eastern countries.”\n\nAfter three hours of grilling, Kantor and his girlfriend were put in a car and taken across the border, where they were forced to take a $220 cab ride back to Toronto because it was 4 a.m.\n\n“We never got a concrete explanation or piece of paper or anything to explain why we were turned away,” Kantor said.\n\n13 participating women and girls of diverse backgrounds and generations responded to the open call with distinguished motivations to take part in one day long performance workshop “Missplaced Women?” that took place on October 29 in Belgrade. Between them there were two 17 years old School of Design students, several art students, master students of arts and drama, couple of feminists, activists and cultural workers, one nurse and as well my colleague Nela Antonović, art director of Mimart Theatre, experienced performance artist herself.\n\nWhether they had any experience with the performance art or with migration, or not, participants were invited to come openminded to the workshop and to bring along some bag or a purse of their own as well as some donations for refuges. Our base was Remont, independent artist association, where we gettered in order to get to know each other and to talk about the project over a cup of tee in democratic way.\n\nWe were discussing and researching and trying out something practical and performative at three different migration specific locations in public spaces in the vicinity of the city centre Bus station where still an average of 300–500 refuges daily stop by, in order to get medical help, food, warm clothes, information, and to charge their mobile phones. Some of them are offered to be transferred to free hostels to recover for up to three days, or to asylum home in Krnjača suburb. Most of the refuges are anyhow waiting there for a next 10-Euro-bus direction Croatian border, etc. Dramatic conditions on Balkan migration routes are changing daily. Since Hungarian border has been violently closed for refuges people can progress from Serbia only to Croatia. From july until early October 2015, parks in vicinity of Bus station in Belgrade were covered with tends and served as improvised temporary camps. Many volunteers were engaged there. Since mid October 2015 camping has been forbidden and refuges are, after being registered at Macedonian border mainly transferred directly to Croatian border by police busses, or are brought to Asylum centres. Volunteers and donations are spreading as well around Croatian, Macedonian and Bulgarian borders.\n\nFirst we came to the storage part of Miksalište, Refugee help centre located in Mostarska 5, where we gave our modest donations and made contacts with several refugees and volunteers. They told us about their journeys and the violence they’ve experienced in some of the countries they went through. What left a big impression on workshop participants is the fact how well they handle their difficult situations and how optimistic they were. They also told us about plans for their future destinations. In the help centre there were mostly younger male refugees from Afghanistan who walked over Bulgaria to Serbia. The reason there were so few women and children there was, as we found out, that they are avoiding passing through Bulgaria in order to avoid brutality of Bulgarian police and groups of organised hooligans. Families mainly go via Macedonia from where as soon as they enter Serbia they are registered and directly transported, by free busses organised by Serbian police, on to Croatian border. We met a lot of people who had been beaten up, robbed and imprisoned for up to 20 days in Bulgaria. Their cell phones, money and passports were taken away. We also met there a 15 year old Kurdish Syrian girl who came over Bulgaria and who had to leave her parents behind in Turkey, since they didn’t had money to travel along. She suffered from severe feet injuries and exhaustion.\n\nInside the Miksalište there is a tend where refugee children can play and make drawings with volunteers and social workers. We took several pictures of drawings where kids expressed their impressions from the journey. On one of the drawings a refugee child depicted explicit violence against his/her family members while on the road in Bulgaria and in Iran.\n\nChoice of reflections excerpts by some of the workshop participants:\n\nDespite the fact that we had only one day for this workshop, I have many different feelings about the experience that we went trough. First, when we came to Miksalište I wasn’t very confident in my approach to the migrants, because I have never been in this situation before and didn’t know what would be the right way to greet them. I wanted to approach them in a very friendly manner and I didn’t want them to get the impression that I felt sorry for them. Then I met a guy from Afghanistan and started talking with him bluntly. He was also open for conversation, with a positive attitude. He looked like he really felt safe and calm in there, and he told me so. He was glad because the people here have empathy and they do not hesitate to help if they can. He told me about his journey and bad experiences he went trough, but he still kept his hope for the future. He gave me his Facebook contact, so we are still in touch. He is now in Düsseldorf, Germany, settled down and thinking about his plans for future. I talked with two more persons and what left a big impression on me was how well they handle their difficult situations… I am aware that not all of them are as strong, but talking to these guys really made me more optimistic. We all need more compassion, we need to be open and brave to talk about issues and problems of our world.” — Irena Mirković (master student, New Media, Academy of Arts, Novi Sad)\n\n2. “The main reason why I wanted to take part in Tanja Ostojić’s “Missplaced Women” performance workshop was to meet and support refugee women and children, as I see them as direct and biggest victims of men’s system of values, politics and wars. I must say I was at first a little sad when we ran into almost no women and children in the refugee parks, but only to later be happy about that fact, because we figured out that majority of them actually choose a better route of traveling, avoiding Bulgaria and going through safer places than people we talked to in parks.\n\nTo me the biggest impression was 18 year old Afghanistan boy who told us his story, how his journey began more than two months ago, how he was almost 3 weeks in Bulgarian prison, where the brutal officers stole all of his property, including: cell phone, money and worst of all, his passport. The boy was smiling all the way, he seemed so positive and happy, even while telling us about the family he left behind in Afghanistan in a highly dangerous background, even when he told us about how he got beaten up in the prison, and about how extremely difficult it was for him to walk so much in firstly unbearably hot, and later cold and rainy conditions. He was thoroughly smiling with a profound, beautiful smile describing us the situation as “very bad, very bad..”\n\nI must say that boy really made me think about life deeply and once again come to conclusion that the most important thing in life is – life itself. If people who lost everything, and have no certain future, not even a certain idea of survival can stay positive and happy out of gratefulness that they still have a bare life — a reason enough to smile, believe and stay positive, where do people in general, coming from ordinary, safe conditions, find a nerve to be grumpy and dissatisfied with life?\n\nWhen did so many of us forget about what is really important and that without love, respect and gratefulness there is no true happiness? I feel blessed for the opportunity of meeting different people we ran into during our performance, as well as having an opportunity to connect with all the inspiring women in the workshop and rethinking the meaning and perspectives on life. For me this was a very nice, meaningful day and I will certainly remember it very gladly.” — Tamara Bijelić (master student of Theatrology, Faculty of Dramatic Arts, Belgrade)\n\n3.”After an exchange with refuges in the frame of the “Misplaced Women?” workshop I came to conclusion that most of the things I have around me, and most of the habits of mine I should get rid off, change, reject, or totally eliminate from my life.

Because you see, women don’t travel alone; they travel with their men, families or friends. If they are alone, it means they are lost or dangerous. I always get those looks and check ups, even friendly offers.\n\nI entered in the first comfortable train heading north… to even more United Europe.\n\nBorder officers were entering my train, checking us, and it all went well, until we managed to come across one small piece of one small country that once used to be called Yugoslavia, that once used to be my own country.\n\nI didn’t have the proper papers, they claimed. Politely, they took me out off the train, and even more delicately, they locked me behind bars. A small prison hut, really, with two young officers watching me from outside with guns.\n\nThen they went through my suitcase, then through my hand bag and then through my computer.\n\nThey were amused:\n\n– So, what are you doing here, madame, smuggling yourself in our country without a visa?\n\n– No, I wasn’t , I said bewildered, I was just traveling back home.\n\n– But you took the wrong train, you cannot travel Europe without a visa.\n\n– No, I said, I just took a train that happens to cross this small country, a nation smaller than the city I come from, a country where the plastic covers on the haystacks look fancier than tablecloths in my country.\n\n– We will have to charge you with an attempt to cross our border illegally.\n\n– But I legally gave you my passport. It was a mistake, my country split up and Europe united…you know, it was such a big confusion…\n\n– We don’t remember your ex-country. The two young blonde border officers stared at me.\n\nI looked at them. Of course, they were too young to remember or even know, why would they care, they were just doing their job.\n\n– You are a writer, one of them says.\n\n– Yes, I am.\n\n– What do you write about, asks he.\n\n– Stuff like this really, I answered vividly, crossing the borders, messing with laws and people.\n\nHe was taken aback.\n\n– We must take you immediately to your embassy, in the capital.\n\n– No, I must call my lawyer, you must give me the phone.\n\nIt was actually a moment of hands-on struggle between us: the European new order and non-European individual.\n\nThe young officer said:\n\n– If we let you go into no-man’s land between borders, you can wait for a couple of hours over there, and then enter Croatia, the country you travelled from. Since from tomorrow, the visa regime in Croatia for Serbs is abolished. You could sleep in the no-man’s land if they don’t let you into Croatia.\n\n– It’ s a deal, I said.\n\nAnd we did it.\n\nThey deported me a couple of kilometers, into nobody’s land where there was literally nothing. I walked slowly, dragging my luggage to the border, which soon enough would stop being one. I reached it, I crossed it because of a kind officer who looked the other way, and I took another train south.\n\nThen a middle aged train conductor checked my new ticket to the south.\n\n– Didn’t you go north only a couple of hours ago?\n\n– Yes I did, I said. I tried to reach to my same destination but I took the wrong direction.\n\n– Don’t you read your tickets, check your trains?\n\n– No I don’t, I said peevishly, as if admitting that I never go to doctors for a regular check up.\n\n– Well you should madame, this world today is all about trains and proper tickets and papers.\n\nHe was right: I looked at his kind elderly face with wrinkles, the devoted body bent over his conductor’s heavy bag, his stamps lost in a smaller bag. I imagined his long-sought pension round the corner, his future life, that of a railway clerk in pension: a little bit of gardening, a little bit of cooking, and a lot of memories of trips, and people he met and treated, or mistreated.\n\nI remembered Walter Benjamin’s suicide at the border while waiting for a visa that arrived only hours too late. A Jew trying to escape Nazi Germany: a philosopher trying to describe the world he was living in. Which Benjamin did perfectly: only he did not have the patience and strength to survive it.\n\nBy Jasmina Tešanović\n\n……………………………………………………………..\n\nEditorial comment:\n\n……………………………………………………………..\n\nThis story has been written in Jun 2003 at the time when visa regime between Croatia and Serbia has been finally abandoned. But Serbian passport holders still needed a visa for Slovenia. (Slovenia joined the European Union one year later, on 1 May 2004). Jasmina Tešanović actually traveled from Zagreb to Belgrade. The train she took first was going over Slovenia, then she had to change to the one that was going from Zagreb to Belgrade over Budapest and where she would not need a visa.\n\nJasmina Tešanović is a women without homeland and without mother tongue, who lives and works on-line.\n\nThis story that she has kindly contributed to the “Missplaced Women?” blog is a part from her on-line book in english: ”My Life Without Me”. In Serbian language “Moj zivot bez mene”, has been publish by Rende, Belgrade in 2013. Italian version “La mia vita senza di me”, Infinito, Bologna, 2014.\n\nLike Loading..."
