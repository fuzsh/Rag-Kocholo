        "text": "Hi Jelena, it's Small Talk here. How are you? [Cheerily] Good thanks, you?\n\nVery well, all the better for speaking to you. Anyway, it's the end of a long season. How would you sum it up? It can always be better, but at the same time it could have been worse. I had a good first half; after Wimbledon I was No2 in the world. But unfortunately in the second half I twisted my ankle and I've been suffering with sinus problems. Though obviously as an athlete you go through a lot of ups and downs.\n\nWhat's the plan for the off-season? Being based in Dubai now you probably don't need a vacation ... I'm just going to recover and recharge my batteries. The whole year is pretty long, we do a lot of travelling. You get tired physically and mentally. So it's nice to have two or three weeks of rest, not think about tennis and just relax with my family and friends.\n\nWill you pretty much be in Dubai? I don't where I'll be yet to be honest.\n\nWhy was it you moved to Dubai, how did that come about? I didn't move to Dubai.\n\nAh. I just go there a couple of times a year when I have time, or maybe to do some training, or to come for vacation.\n\n[Long pause as Small Talk curses its shoddy research and desperately tries to remember where she was born] Er ... so what's Belgrade like then? What would you recommend doing there of an evening? Sorry?\n\nEr … er … what would be a good night out? I think Belgrade has a nice nightlife, there are lots of nice clubs where you can have a good time, listen to some good music and share some drinks. Yeah, Belgrade's a good place for that.\n\n[Small Talk considers asking Jelena for an invite on her next night out but fears it hasn't left a great impression so far] Back to the tennis then. You're well known in Britain for winning the Wimbledon mixed doubles title with Jamie Murray, are you still in contact with him? No, unfortunately not. But I heard he got married. I just want to congratulate him and wish him all the best.\n\nYou joked at the time you used kisses as a way of motivating him. Did you try anything else as well? There were plenty of rumours flying around back then … [Laughs] No, that was for fun. The most important thing is we won Wimbledon. I think that's what counts the most.\n\nVery cryptic. So if you could play mixed doubles with anyone, past or present, who would you choose? [Sounds excited] I'd like to play with [John] McEnroe.\n\nThat would be feisty ... Yeah he has a fun personality, it would be a funny match.\n\nSmall Talk would suggest not motivating him with kisses. Anyway, if you could do one thing to make women's tennis more popular, what would it be? I don't know, but I think it's important to have girls who look nice, who have personalities on the court and who can really draw the crowds so more people watch the sport.\n\nYou touched on fashion there. It's something you're very interested in, you've designed your own collections. Putting you on the spot, who do you think the best-dressed player on tour is? It's tough to say. I really love fashion and I think a lot of the girls dress very nicely and really pay attention to what they're going to wear. They have different kind of styles, they like to be different, so it's tough to pick out just one. But it's all about having fun and expressing your personality through fashion.\n\nDiplomatic answer. So Small Talk can't get a name out of you? If I could just pick one it would be maybe Maria Sharapova.\n\nAway from fashion, you were doing an economics degree weren't you? Did you finish that? No, tennis kind of took over. I'm waiting to have some more free time. I have two more years left so hopefully I'll be able to go back to it, because a vocation is very important to me.\n\nSo can we expect you to take over the International Monetary Fund when you quit tennis? I don't know, I love fashion as well, so who knows. I have my little clothing line in Serbia, we'll see. It's still like a hobby at the moment, I really haven't thought about what I'll do after tennis. Most likely I'll have a family first of all and live a normal life and then we'll see what I'll do when I get a little bored.\n\nIf someone was to make a film of your life, who would you like to play you? Oh my God, I don't know! Who do you think?\n\nNow you're putting Small Talk on the spot … [Chuckles] Yeah, exactly! Who do you think?\n\n[Small Talks ums and ahs. And ums and ahs] I'll go for Julia Roberts.\n\nTalking of films, what was the last movie you saw? The one with her, actually. Eat Pray Love.\n\nDid you like it? It's had pretty bad reviews in this country … Yeah, I don't really want to comment!\n\nAgain very diplomatic. And what kind of music do you listen to before heading on to court? Energetic music to get pumped up and feel good. It's different kinds of music, it depends on how I feel. I like Lady Gaga, I like Beyoncé, I like Alicia Keys.\n\nIf you could have a superpower for the day, what would it be? To be able to fly – especially on the court. Because these days I haven't been moving well, so I'd love to fly on the court, get all the balls back, it would be great.\n\nJust finally Jelena, what's the most famous name you've got in your phone? That wouldn't be nice to say!\n\nYou don't have to give Small Talk the number, just the name … [Laughs] Yeah but still, if I told you I have the number, many people will call me to get that number. It's best I don't say."
