        "text": "The Serbian enchantress that is Dijana Jankovic was born in Belgrade on 22nd July 1988. Her father, Slavko, is a forestry engineer and her mother, Vladana, is a geological engineer. Her first cousin is world-famous Serbian tennis player Jelena Jankovic, who ranked first on WTA list for a period of time.\n\nDidi is a triple threat, not only is she a talented singer but she’s also both a fashion designer and a business woman. Anyways back when Jankovic was only 15 years old she completed a Fashion Model Course and became a model, which would consequently result in the fulfillment of her childhood of becoming a fashion designer with her very own fashion line. In 2009 she dipped her toe into acting and landed the lead role in Sefka Hodzic’s Crime. This film aired on the most-watched TV channels in Serbia.\n\n2010 was the year Jankovic’s music career began. At only 19 years old Didi participated and won first prize at a prestigious pop music festival in Vrnjacka Banja. The winning tune being Jaka which Sasa Milosevic Mare wrote (Sasa wrote Serbia’s winning Eurovision entry back in 2007. The song being Molitva which Marija Šerifović sang)\n\nIn 2013 Dijana married Daniel Rokvic, who is an IT expert, in Monte Carlo.This lavish wedding was held in the Saint Charles Church. Also all the regional media outlets covered this spectacle. A year later Didi founded DJ Solutions which is a company for both music video and commercial production.\n\nTell Me Why: Now this was a majestical tune aided by spectacular lyrics and an enchanting melody. Didi’s inspiration for this single comes straight from real life experience, her marriage to husband Daniel, “With his love and support, I have been able to accomplish so much in the past year, in my career and in my life as I grow and develop as a woman in business, fashion, and as an artist”. On my first listen to this track I was left completely captivated. Tell Me Why was extremely blissful and it had been written to perfection as those smooth lyrics were memorable. This refreshing cut also featured Geo Da Silva and his vocals were pristine. The actual music video was rather impressive as well.\n\nSay No More: Didi has dropped a brand new song and this coming in the form of the poptastic Say No More. Just like Tell Me Why another artist lends their vocals and that artist being Mr Boombastic Shaggy. The fact Didi managed to secure Shaggy is literally incredible and it does wonders for her career. The lyrics were both fresh and funky plus this compelling number was written about both love and passion. Rokvic’s vocals were ever so exquisite and then you had Shaggy’s phenomenal delivery which gave Say No More that extra edge. Just listening to this infectious jam left me smiling from beginning to end.\n\nAll in all Didi has something extremely special, both Tell Me Why and Say No More are spectacular originals which makes me relish what’s to come in the future. Now I would describe her music as being fun filled pop.\n\nAfter watching the music video for Tell Me Why I really adore the fact she incorporated her passion for fashion. Just seeing her designs on her web shop show me she’s an incredible Fashion Designer.\n\nPutting everything into perspective Didi is a up and coming pop princess who can quite easily take the music industry by storm."
