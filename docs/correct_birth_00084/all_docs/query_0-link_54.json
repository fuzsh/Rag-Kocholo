        "text": "WTA: Ex-number 1 Jelena Jankovic planning a comeback?\n\nJelena Jankovic has not played in a tournament since several injuries since the 2017 US Open. Her appearance alongside Novak Djokovic on the Adria Tour in Belgrade allows speculation about a comeback. Which the Serb still fires.\n\nJankovic played a set against Djenovic on Saturday against Nenad Zimjonic and the Serbian youth hope Olga Danilovic, was also on Sunday alongside her mother as a spectator. And maybe I really got into tennis again.\n\n\"It was a great feeling to be back on the court after almost three years, especially with Novak,\" the former number one in the WTA world rankings told the Tennis Channel. \"I was very happy here in front of my home fans, in my hometown. It was a special moment after such a long time. I am grateful to Novak for having invited me to organize such a wonderful event, especially in difficult times that we're in right now. \"\n\nJelena Jankovic was at the top of the WTA charts for 18 weeks, in 2016 she was still in the top 20.\n\n\"I stopped because I had a big back injury. It took me a while to be able to do normal things at all, just live a normal life. But now I feel good,\" said Jankovic. \"I'm happy. I'm excited. We'll see. In times like these, it's difficult to plan things. It was great to feel the atmosphere again, the adrenaline when you step in front of a crowd. It was great. And : I never officially resigned, so the door is still open. \""
