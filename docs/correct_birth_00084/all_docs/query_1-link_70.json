        "text": "Elena Dementieva wins first JPMorgan Chase Open Tennis tournament after being in semis three times.\n\nBy D.S. Perez Peninsula News\n\nElena Dementieva came into the JPMorgan Chase Open with a frustrating past.\n\nShe had finished with three defeats in the semis.\n\nBut on Sunday at the Home Depot Center in Carson, Dementieva let out a different shriek than the one she usually does to smash a ball on the court, this one a victory cheer after beating Jelena Jankovic of Serbia 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.\n\nWith the win, she became the first Russian-born player to capture this tournament’s singles title.\n\n“I always have great results here … finally, a great win here today,” Dementieva said. “It’s great to be a champion one weekend. So many great players here this week and I’m the best one. I hope this [momentum] can go on forever.”\n\nIf you were to bet on Russians taking this tournament, the ova-underyeva was pretty good. Dementieva was among 10 athletes from Russia participating in the tournament.\n\nThe No. 6-ranked player in the world, Dementieva took the first three games with ease before Jankovic came up on the scoreboard in the first set.\n\nJankovic rebounded a bit in the first set, but it wasn’t enough. Dementieva didn’t let the slip-up eat her game, as she quickly rebounded and took the set.\n\nBut Jankovic, who toyed with the idea of giving up the game this year and playing in her first final this season, didn’t let the setback get to her.\n\nJankovic took two hard-fought games to go up 2-0 in the frame, the first requiring her to edge out Dementieva in a deuce situation.\n\nDementieva came back in the set with a score, helped by Jankovic’s hits going past the back line. The two split the next two games, before Dementieva edged Jankovic in a deuce situation to tie the set.\n\nDementieva temporarily had a 4-3 lead before Jankovic stormed back and took the next three games.\n\nDementieva responded by winning the next five games of the third set, in which Jankovic offered little resistance.\n\nWith her back against the wall, Jankovic came up big, roaring back and winning four games in a row to delay Dementieva’s coronation.\n\nBefore Jankovic brought the score to 5-4, she had a 40-30 lead in the game. In the deuce situation, Jankovic hit too far past the backline, putting Dementieva within range of winning the match. But the Russian hit the ball too hard.\n\nJankovic later took the game with a risky dump shot. Jankovic relied on risk shots to keep her chances alive.\n\nDementieva took the next game, fending off Jankovic once and for all with a shot that graced the sideline.\n\n“She almost came back,” Dementieva said. “I was so happy to close this match. She had so many unbelievable shots. I was expecting another one and another one … It’s very difficult to finish five-love and … come back. I thought she didn’t care, [but] everything was being hit hard. It was very hard to close this match. She’s a very unpredictable player.”\n\nJankovic said she expected Dementieva to be her own worst enemy and double-fault at times.\n\n“I wanted to come back. I know I can break her. But when you’re tired, it’s tough to serve. I almost came back to five-all,” Jankovic said.\n\nDementieva and Jankovic had split in their two previous meetings, all of which took place in 2004.\n\nA three-time semifinalist at this event, last year Dementieva lost in the semis to Daniela Hantuchova 6-4, 6-4. She also appeared in the 2004 and 2000 semis.\n\nTo get to the finals, Dementieva had to fend off the world’s top female player, Maria Sharapova, Saturday. The pair went two sets, 7-5, 6-2. Jankovic beat Serena Williams 6-4, 6-3.\n\nIt was only the second time since 1996 that the singles finals didn’t feature Williams or Lindsay Davenport, who was coming back from injury.\n\nDavenport, who hails from the Hill area, fell in her first match, losing to Australian Samantha Stosur 7-6, 6-4, 6-3. Stosur said Davenport was not moving well and her serve was not as hard as it usually is."
