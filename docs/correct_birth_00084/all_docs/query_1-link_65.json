        "text": "Jelena Jankovic is ready to step out of Jamie Murray's shadow and become the new queen of Wimbledon.\n\nLast year the 23-year-old Serbian beauty was the lesser known half of the mixed doubles pairing that clinched Britain's first trophy of any kind at SW19 for two decades.\n\nThis year Jankovic wants the talking to be about her alone and arrives in south west London as the world No.2.\n\nShe has already severed her doubles links with Murray - older brother of British No.1 Andy - and is now focused on ending her poor run at Wimbledon where she has never been beyond the fourth round.\n\nSpeaking at a photo shoot for sportswear giants Reebok, Jankovic, who plays Ukraine's Olga Savchuk first up, said: \"Winning the mixed doubles with Jamie Murray was great and I had so much fun.\n\n\"But this year I will be more focused on the singles and I would love to do well.\n\n\"It's only in England that I get asked about Jamie, nowhere else. It's because I normally only play singles everywhere else.\n\n\"But here he was the first Brit to win a title for so long so of course it is going to be huge.\n\n\"If it was in Serbia it would only be me all over the place but because he is British well, who else are you going to talk about?\n\n\"I understand that. But now I just want to be healthy and enjoy my tennis.\"\n\nDefeat in this month's French Open semi-final to fellow Serb and world No.1 Ana Ivanovic meant Jankovic has now lost at the last four stage in four of her last seven Grand Slams.\n\nEach defeat has come to the eventual winner (she lost to Wimbledon finalist Marion Bartoli in the fourth round last year). Now, though, she is ready to shed her tag of being a nearly woman and insists neither champion Venus Williams, nor the American's nemesis Maria Sharapova will stand in her way.\n\nJankovic added: \"I don't think about rivals, I just look at every player in the same way and when I step on to court I want to give my maximum.\n\n\"I think only about performing at my best, doing what I have been practising in my training sessions and transferring it to my matches.\n\n\"Of course I need to know about strengths and weaknesses but I just try to do what I do best.\"\n\nAsked about her inspirations and her response is immediate, mum Snezana.\n\nShe added: \"She is the one who is always supporting me in the good and the bad times.\n\nShe is always giving me good advice. She has taught me good manners and has done a great job raising three kids. I hope she keeps doing it!\"\n\nThe annual debate is certain to rage this week about the slim to non-existent chance of our British women.\n\nJankovic said: \"I can't tell you why the British girls are not doing well.\n\n\"I can only tell you that coming from Serbia, we didn't have the best facilities to train.\n\n\"We don't have the best financial status and we have tried very hard to make it.\n\n\"We are very motivated, very hungry. We strive to be the best and maybe that's why we are doing well because in England you have everything.\n\n\"You have the best facilities. You have so much money, you have the best coaches and the players maybe have a lack of motivation, a lack of something to push them.\n\n\"Maybe they wonder why they have to work so hard when they have everything.\n\n\"Those players that don't have so much are the ones that really do want to work and want to make it.\""
