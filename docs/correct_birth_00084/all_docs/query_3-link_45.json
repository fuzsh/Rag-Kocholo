        "text": "by Miloš Damnjanović\n\nFundamental freedoms and Serbia’s democratic institutions continued their deterioration in 2017, marking the fourth consecutive year of democratic decline in the country and its lowest Democracy Score in Nations in Transit since 2003. The areas that suffered particularly during the year were the independence of the media, civil society, national democratic governance, and the conditions under which local elections take place.\n\nPerhaps the most significant political event of the year were presidential elections held in April, in which then prime minister Aleksandar Vučić won in the first round with 55 percent of the votes cast. This was the first time that a Serbian presidential candidate had an absolute majority in the first round since 2000. While the electoral outcome broadly reflected the will of the people, numerous problems evident during consecutive electoral cycles since 2012 remained present, some becoming even more acute. Reports produced by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as well as local election observers from the Centre for Research, Transparency and Accountability (CRTA) all listed problems such as unbalanced media coverage, pressure on public sector employees, their families or friends, as well as abuse of administrative resources as factors that significantly skewed the electoral playing field in Vučić’s favor. In summing up the climate ahead of polling day, CRTA argued that the conditions in which the campaign was conducted were “sufficient that the preelection period cannot be characterized as fair, free, or in line with international democratic standards.” Election day itself passed with relatively few incidents or documented cases of ballot-box stuffing, but anecdotal evidence suggests that numerous instances of vote buying or pressure on voters on the day itself to vote for the ruling party’s candidate took place, even if such pressure did not fundamentally alter the final outcome.\n\nAs during the previous year, the business of governing the country took a back seat to an unnecessarily protracted election cycle. Serbian Progessive Party (SNS) leader Aleksandar Vučić remained prime minister during the course of the campaign and for almost two months thereafter, before resigning at the end of May in order to be sworn in as president. The new prime minister, Ana Brnabic, finally assumed office on June 29, at the head of a largely unchanged cabinet. While the election of a pro-European, female prime minister was widely commended, including in much of Europe and North America, arguably more worrying was the fact that both the new president and prime minister left no doubt that the real power would lie in the hands of the former, despite the largely symbolic powers vested in the president’s office under the constitution.\n\nMedia freedoms continued to deteriorate, with the closure of some of the few remaining independent print outlets, such as Novine Vranjske, and continuing financial pressure on outlets that fail to support the government or at least tone down their criticism. Journalist associations reported an increase in the number of attacks on journalists, including cases of physical attacks, as well as organized harangues by tabloids close to the ruling party following revelations of government corruption by investigative journalists.\n\nWhile Serbian civil society remains vibrant and lively, both in the form of formally organized groups and ad-hoc activism and protests, the government continues to be very hostile to autonomous groups seeking to criticize or hold it to account. Although civil society has mobilized large numbers of protesters around certain issues, such as the Belgrade Waterfront development or conditions under which elections are held, authorities have largely ignored such demands.\n\nThe quality of democratic governance has also declined at the local level. Local electoral contests were held during the course of the year in an atmosphere of marked intimidation, with many local elections seeming neither free nor fair. Meanwhile, the SNS continued the practice of postelection cooptation of opposition local assembly members in an attempt to grab as much power and resources at the local level as possible. As a result, by the end of 2017, the SNS controlled the local government in 157 out of 170 local municipalities in Serbia.\n\nDespite electoral distractions, the Serbian government did achieve some notable successes. The country’s European Union (EU) accession negotiating process made slow but steady progress, with the number of opened chapters reaching 12 by the end of the year, while 2 chapters were closed. The government also made further progress in stabilizing public finances and reducing public debt, along with modest positive reforms aimed at improving the general business environment. On the other hand, negotiations on normalizing relations with Kosovo made little substantive progress for most of the year, although President Vučić did call for an internal dialogue in Serbia on how future relations between Kosovo and Serbia should be organized.\n\nMeanwhile, there were no noteworthy reforms when it came to rule of law or efforts to tackle corruption. Despite the fact that constitutional reforms intended to increase the independence of the judiciary were announced for 2017 as part of Serbia’s EU accession efforts, these changes appear to have been deferred for 2018. A similar lack of progress was visible when it came to fighting corruption, with the topic seeming to slip ever further down the government’s political agenda.\n\nOutlook for 2018: Belgrade City elections are due by March 2018 and will, given the size and importance of the capital, become an important battleground between ruling and opposition parties. According to rumors and comments at year’s end by some members of the ruling SNS, it is also possible that early parliamentary elections could be held during the course of 2018. Given the undemocratic environment in which elections in 2016 and 2017 were held, it will be important to monitor the conduct of any elections during the course of 2018.\n\nSerbia will continue to open EU accession negotiating chapters, but it will be important to watch for any progress in key negotiating Chapters 23 and 24 relating to the rule of law, corruption and fundamental freedoms, as well as possible constitutional changes which could help to increase the independence of the judiciary."
