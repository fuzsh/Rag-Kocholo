        "text": "So far, so good for the seeded players at the Prudential Hong Kong Tennis Open as Jelena Jankovic, Daria Gavrilova and Samantha Stosur all secured safe passage into the quarter-finals at Victoria Park yesterday.\n\nFourth-seeded Jankovic booked her place in the last eight of the US$250,000 event in assured style as she completed a 6-0, 6-2 win against outclassed Russian-born Australian Anastasia Rodionova.\n\nWith qualifiers and long shots beginning to fall away, the Serbian said her approach would stay the same.\n\n\"It doesn't matter who I play - if it's a qualifier or a top seed - I just try to be focused on my game. I never underestimate an opponent.\"\n\nThe 30-year-old will now face Russian sixth seed Gavrilova in a quarter-final match tomorrow after she progressed courtesy of a 7-6, 6-1 win over Spain's Lara Arruabarrena.'\n\nJankovic said she is an admirer of the youngster.\n\n\"She's a tough player. She's a great fighter and very consistent ... it will be our first encounter and I look forward to playing against her.\n\nThe 36th-ranked Gavrilova, in her first full year on the WTA tour, produced some splendid tennis to ease to victory against the 23-year-old Spaniard in a brisk second set after edging the opener in a tie-breaker.\n\n\"I'm pretty happy with my performance. I played much better than the day before,\" said Gavrilova.\n\n\"It was pretty tough - we had some long rallies, but I ended up winning so I'm happy.\"\n\nJoining the pair in the last eight is Australia's Samantha Stosur who had too much class for Puerto Rican Monica Puig.\n\nStosur, a former US Open champion, notched up her fourth win in four matches against the 22-year-old with a classy 6-4, 6-4 win.\n\n\"Tonight's match was more difficult than the last time we played,\" said the 31-year-old. \"I think she's improved a little bit since then.\n\n\"I'm enjoying my time here and hopefully I can keep playing well - tonight I played very well. If I can keep playing like this, then it will be a nice tournament to finish the season with,\" added Stosur.\n\nHer quarter-final opponent will be Britain's Heather Watson who overcame Taipei's Lee Ya-hsuan 6-0, 6-7, 6-4.\n\nStosur said she had limited knowledge of Watson's game, but said: \"She's been around for a long time. I'll have to have a think about it, but if I play well then I should be able to do okay, but she made it through a tough one tonight.\"\n\nWatson's hard-fought win was another step towards her book-ending an ultimately disappointing season with a second WTA victory following on from her curtain-raising WTA win in Hobart at the start of this year.\n\nThursday's order of play:\n\nCentre Court (starting at 3pm): Yaroslava Shvedova (Kazakhstan) v 8-Alize Cornet (France); 7-Caroline Garcia (France) v Anastasiya Komardina (Russia); 3-Venus Williams (US) v Wang Yafan (China); Kurumi Nara (Japan) v 2-Angelique Kerber (Germany).\n\nCourt One (starting at 3pm): Doubles: 1-Lara Arruabarrena (Spain) and Andreja Klepac (Slovenia) v Ki Yan-tung and Ng Man-ying (Hong Kong). Nicha Lertpitaksincha (Thailand) and Peangtam Plipuech (Thailand) v 2-Klaudia Jans-Ignacik (Poland) and Anastasia Rodionova (Australia); Chuang Chia-jung and Luksika Kumkhum (Thailand) v 4-Alize Cornet (France) and Yaroslava Shvedova (Kazakhstan).\n\nReults, second round: 4-Jelena Jankovic (Serbia) beat Anastasia Rodionova (Australia) 6-0, 6-2; 5-Samantha Stosur (Australia) beat Monica Puig (Puerto Rico) 6-4, 6-4; 6-Daria Gavrilova (Russia) beat Lara Arruabarrena (Spain) 7-6 (7-4), 6-1; Heather Watson (Britain) beat Lee Ya-hsuan (Taiwan) 6-0, 6-7 (5-7), 6-4.\n\nThis article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Jankovic and Stosur all class to reach last eight"
