The Belgrade-born 22-year-old has added a Balkan hideaway to her property portfolio, which includes a home and training base in Florida. Her new place is a three-bedroom flat in a luxury modern block in central Belgrade , close to her family. Jankovic, named most improved player by the Women's Tennis Association last year, is spending last season's tour winnings on her Serbian house. \"Hopefully after Wimbledon, my furniture will arrive and the flat will be ready for me,\" she says."
