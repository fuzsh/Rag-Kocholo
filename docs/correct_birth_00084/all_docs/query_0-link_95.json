        "text": "Ethnographic film festivals seem to be neglected in film studies and festival management researches. Therefore, this research represents an effort to bring awareness about these festivals and to show their cultural and social contributions and impacts. I argue ethnographic films festivals have potentials to induce critical thinking, audience development and independent production. Contrasting five ethnographic film festivals from ex-Yugoslav territories, current situations are presented with insights about good practice and shortcomings as well. Two student festivals (Student Ethnographic Film Festival in Zadar and ETNOFF – Ethnographic Film Festival in Skopje) and three festivals that have student programmes (International Days of Ethnographic Film in Ljubljana, International Festival of Ethnological Film in Belgrade and Ethnographic Film Festival in Rovinj) are examined. For better understanding of potentials ethnographic film festivals have primarily on audience development, critical thinking and independent production, various festivals aspects are analyzed – their vision, mission, value statement, location, programmation (selection, programmes, awarding), organizational structure, audience, marketing, collaboration and financing. Accordingly, recommendations for further development and improvement are given. I found that ethnographic film festivals have many potentials, not just for mentioned domains, but even more – for development of intercultural dialogue, interdisciplinarity, regional collaboration, cultural sensitivity, film education, cultural participation, alternative cultural scene and social activism. Key words: ethnographic film festivals, critical thinking, audience development, independent production, Other, animation, mediation\n\nFestivals are among the growing global city and destination attraction factors and they are very trendy. Studies indicate that there is a direct relationship between the successful organizations of festivals and the number of visitors and tourism income of a city destination. Thus, festival marketing efforts usually have a direct impact on city marketing efforts. Due to this fact, the study tries to figure out the festival marketing potential of Izmir city that seems to lag behind the general tourism development pattern of Turkey contrary to the great potential it has. The study comprises of two main sections, first one being a literature review on festival marketing, followed by the second section on a qualitative research on Izmir's festivals and their marketing potential. It tries to determine the positive impacts of Izmir's festivals on destination marketing and by grouping and categorizing them under similar characteristics figuring out the most promising ones. The research consists of four open-ended interview questions on festivals held in Izmir city. As practical implications, Destination Management Organizations, Destination Marketing Organizations, destination and city marketers, festival managers and destination tourism developers may benefit from the findings of this study.\n\nArtistic censorship is on the rise throughout the world. Based on selected case studies, this paper discusses freedom of expression in contemporary theatres in Serbia. The research shows how the question of artistic freedom becomes degraded, and how this relates to the general social ambiance and state of affairs. Censorship and self-censorship feature as most traumatic phenomena in theatre history, however, they are still present in contemporary theatre life. By identifying and classifying the reasons and motives behind the (self) censorship practices, we trace the ideological slips associated with values of the Serbian society and politics – from homophobia, violence or various forms of criticism to protection of the national identity, heritage and religion. In the post-transitional cultural model, with legacies of the previous system which require new approaches and reforms, both artists and theatres are struggling to survive, and the social and political climate is not helpful in this respect. The artists have the right to offend – the state, religion, political elites, by expressing different views, revealing new pictures and saying unpleasant things simply because that is what art is all about – freedom."
