        "text": "There are few players on the women's circuit who are as quirky or as kooky as Bartoli, the Frenchwoman whose groundstrokes and service action are never going to earn her any style points at Melbourne Park. But Bartoli's unconventional tennis can be wonderfully effective, and her defeat of Jankovic was a result that demonstrated that players don't have to be slaves to the coaching manual orthodoxy.\n\nMany of the competitors in the women's game seem to have come off an Eastern Bloc and Nick Bollettieri production line, all with the same, honed groundstrokes. Bartoli is refreshingly different, playing with a style that you are unlikely to find in a coaching textbook near you - her serve is jerky and just plain weird, and her arms look cramped when she hits her double-handed forehands and backhands.\n\nThis wasn't even the first time that Mademoiselle Bizarre had embarrassed a world No 1 at a grand slam tournament, as she beat Justine Henin, of Belgium, in the semi-finals of the 2007 Wimbledon Championships, going on to finish as the runner-up that summer to Venus Williams. Here she was again, taking centre stage at Melbourne Park.\n\n\"I'm just happy to be on the Rod Laver Arena, because I usually play so badly at the Australian Open that I'm on Court 21,\" Bartoli said after a 6-1, 6-4 victory that took her into the quarter-finals of the Australian Open for the first time.\n\nJankovic had wanted to show at Melbourne Park that she deserved to have the top ranking by winning her first slam title, and she had prepared during the close-season by scrambling over rocks on endurance runs in the Mexican mountains. She believed that, after the altitude training and a new sense of purpose off the court, she was in the best shape of her tennis life.\n\nHowever, she had to withdraw from a semi-serious exhibition tournament in Hong Kong because of illness, and so came into Melbourne Park without any form to go on. Jankovic has always tended to take a while to find her range and her rhythm at the start of the year, so she was vulnerable to defeat against Bartoli, especially when the Frenchwoman decided to go for her shots.\n\nIt was the earliest defeat for a women's top seed at Melbourne Park since Steffi Graf, Fraulein Forehand, lost in the fourth round of the 1997 tournament to South Africa's Amanda Coetzer.\n\nDinara Safina, the women's third seed from Russia, had to come back from 5-2 down in the third set for her 6-2, 2-6, 7-5 win over France's Alize Cornet. Marat Safin's little sister was extremely unhappy with how she had performed. \"The game is there, I just don't know what is going on through my mind,\" Safina said.\n\n\"Somebody should smack me so hard in my head that something shakes finally and I put the cables together. My coach told me that if I continue playing like this, he may as well go home. I keep telling myself to hit the ball but my arm just doesn't want to, because my mind is just stupid.\" Like her brother, Safina doesn't take herself too seriously.\n\nMeanwhile, Jelena Dokic's fairytale comeback to the Australian Open continued to gain momentum when she beat Russian Alisa Kleybanova 7-5, 5-7, 8-6.\n\nThe Yugoslav-born Australian, riding a wave of public support and national sympathy after her troubled past, turned back the clock to reach her first grand slam quarter-final since the 2002 French Open.\n\nThe match swung wildly back and forth as both players struggled with their serve and nerves before Dokic sealed a famous victory, triggering wild celebrations on the Melbourne Park centre court."
