He grew up in Glasgow and attended Dunblane Primary School and Dunblane High School.\n\nAs a young player he was coached by his mother, Judy, and by the age of 12 was one of the top 3 players in Europe alongside Rafael Nadal and Richard Gasquet. He was a GB Junior Internationalist from the age of 10-17 and National 18 & Under Boys Doubles Champion in 2002. He made the decision to concentrate on doubles as a career in 2006. The following year at the age of 21, he won his first Grand Slam title in the mixed doubles at Wimbledon with Jelena Jankovic. Jamie has claimed 30 ATP doubles titles and captured two men’s Grand Slam doubles titles, at the Australian Open and the US Open in 2016. He picked up another two mixed doubles Grand Slam titles in 2017 with Martina Hingis at Wimbledon and the US Open and most recently he partnered Bethanie Mattek-Sands at the 2018 and 2019 US Open, his 7th Grand Slam victory. He was also a key member of the GB team which won the Davis Cup in 2015.\n\nJamie lives in Wimbledon, London, with his wife Alejandra, who he married in 2010 at Cromlix House near Dunblane. Away from tennis, Jamie enjoys golf (right-handed), playing off a handicap of 4. He is a member of Wentworth Club. When not competing, Jamie is a regular commentator on the BBC, Eurosport and Sky Sports.
