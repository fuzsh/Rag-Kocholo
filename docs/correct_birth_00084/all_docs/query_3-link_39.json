On behalf of the Republic of Croatia and in accordance with Article 40, 1, of the Statute\n\nof the International Court of Justice and Article 38 of the Rules of Court, I respectfully\n\nsubmit this Application instituting proceedings in the name of the Republic of Croatia\n\nagainst the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for violations of the\n\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (hereinafter called\n\nthe ‘‘Genocide Convention’’). The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 36(1) of its\n\nStatute and Article IX of the Genocide Convention.\n\nPRELIMINARY TATEMENT\n\n2. The Genocide Convention prohibits the destruction, in whole or in part, of a national,\n\nethnic, racial or religious group, including the elimination or displacement of members of\n\nthat group from a particular territory. Between 1991 and 1995, the Federal Republic of\n\nYugoslavia repeatedly violated the Genocide Convention. By directly controlling the\n\nactivity of its armed forces, intelligence agents, a1d various paramilitary detachments, on\n\nthe territory of the Republic of Croatia, in the Knineastern and western Slavonia,\n\nand Dalmatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is liable for the “ethnic cleansing” of\n\nCroatian citizens from these areas--a form of genocide which resulted in large numbers of\n\nCroatian citizens being displaced, killed, tortured, or illegally detained, as well as extensive\n\nproperty destruction--and is required to provide reparation for the resulting damages. In\n\naddition, by directing, encouraging, and urging Croatian citizens of Serb ethnicity in the\n\n1\n\nAt the instance and behest of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Serb residents of this area\n\ndeclared the ‘‘Republic of Serbian Krajina” in December,1990. This illegal declaration was not\n\nrecognised by the Republic of Croatia, and was uniformly rejected by the international\n\ncommunity. For ease of reference, the Republic of Croatia will hereinafter collectively refer to\n\nthe areas of Knin, portions of Dalmatia, Lika, Kordun, and Banija as the “Knin region.” 10\n\nKnin region to evacuate the area in 1995, as the Republic of Croatia reasserted its legitimate\n\ngovernmental authority (and, in the face of clear reassurance emanating from the highest\n\nlevel of the Croatian government, including the President of the Republic of Croatia, Dr.\n\nFranjo Tuđman, that the local Serbs had nothing to fear and should stay), the Federal\n\nRepublic of Yugoslavia engaged in conduct amounting to a second round of ‘‘ethnic\n\ncleansing,’’ in violation of the Genocide Convention.\n\nI. STATEMENT OF ACTS\n\n3. On 25 June 1991, based upon the results of a national plebiscite, the Croatian Sabor\n\nvoted overwhelmingly (94,5%) to declare Croatia’s independence. Democracy had been\n\nrestored officially to the Republic of Croatia on 30 May 1990, the date that the Sabor held\n\nits first session following the first free, democratic, multiparty elections after almost 50\n\nyears under Communist rule. On 22 December 1990, the Sabor adopted a new constitution.\n\n4. On 15 January 1992, members of the European Community recognised the Republic of\n\nCroatia as a sovereign state, and the United States of America recognised Croatia on 7 April\n\n1992. On 22 May 1992, Croatia was granted membership in the United Nations. Within a\n\nyear, Croatia was recognised by 102 countries, 78 of which have established formal\n\ndiplomatic relations with it.\n\n5. Prior to its declaration of independence in 1991, the Croatian state had existed in one\n\nform or another for at least 1000 years, dating back to the first Croatian king, Tomislav.\n\nOver the next 1000 years, Croatia retained its legal status and autonomy within the\n\nframework of the Hungarian kingdom, and the Habsburg Monarchy. On the disintegration\n\nof Austria-Hungary in October1928, a Croatian National Council took power in Zagreb and\n\n(without consulting the Croatian people) called for union with the Kingdom of Serbia and\n\nother South Slavic parts of Austria-Hungary. In December, 1918, the so-called Kingdom of\n\nthe Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was proclaimed in Belgrade under the Serb Kara đorđević\n\ndynasty, without ratification by the Croatian parliament. In 1929, King Alexander\n\nKarađorđević reorganised the boundaries of governance and established a dictatorship,\n\nrenaming the country Yugoslavia for the first time in history.\n\n6. In 1943, the Communist-led partisan forces proclaimed a new Yugoslavia at Jajce, in\n\nBosnia, and, with their victory in 1945, set up a federal state of six republics. By 1987-\n\n1988, the Yugoslav Federal Government, established under Marshal Josip Broz Tito, had\n\nbegun to disintegrate. Serbian leaders effected changes in the Serbian constitution that gave\n\nthe Socialist Republic of Serbia effective control of four of the eight votes in the collective\n\nYugoslav Presidency. These changes altered fundamentally the de facto organisation of\n\nYugoslavia as defined by the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution.\n\n7. On 28 February 1989, the Croatian Democratic Union was formed under the leadership\n\nof Dr. Franjo Tu đman, who would lead Croatia to restore its political independence as a\n\nsovereign state. Faced with the prospect of the imposition of Serb hegemony under\n\nMilošević (then President of Serbia), Croatia and Slovenia each declared their\n\nindependence on 25 June 1991.\n\n8. Previously, on 21 December 1990, Serbs living in the areas of Croatia bordering Bosnia\n\nand Herzegovina and Vojvodina illegally declared the establishment of the so-called\n\n“Republic of Serbian Krajina.” This declaration was the culmination of over a year’s worth\n\nof efforts by the Belgrade government to subvert the lawful authority of the Republic of\n\nCroatia, seeking to overthrow its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Belgrade used such 11\n\nmeans as the distribution of nationalistic propaganda, conducting demonstrations of its\n\narmed forces, putting these units into the highest degree of combat readiness, and providing\n\narms seized from territorial defence installations located in the Republic of Croatia to\n\nsubvert Croatian democracy.\n\n9. On 28 February 1991, rebel leaders in the Knin region announced their intention to unite\n\nwith the Serbs in Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. These actions were\n\nundertaken in order to realise the plan for creating a “Greater Serbia.” This plan, although it\n\nwas first conceived more than 150 years ago, has been consistently advocated by Mr.\n\nSlobodan Milošević, now the President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\n10. On 31 March 1991, Serb terrorists, armed with weapons supplied by the so-called\n\n“Yugoslav People’s Army” (“JNA”) blocked Croatian policemen in Plitvice and opened fire\n\non them from ambush, killing Josip Jović, the first Croatian policeman killed in the defence\n\nof the constitutional order of the Republic of Croatia. Within Croatia, paramilitary groups\n\ndominated by Serbs put themselves at the service of the so-called JNA and the Federal\n\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. By the middle of 1991, 59 of the 102 municipalities within the\n\nRepublic of Croatia were engulfed by the destruction. Forty of these had sustained\n\nconsiderable direct damage, and 19 others suffered limited destruction. The areas of eastern\n\nand central Slavonia, Banovina and Lika, and parts of Dalmatia sustained most of the\n\ndamage.\n\n11. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia carried out the aggression against the Republic of\n\nCroatia by supporting, abetting, and directing the actions of various extremist rebel groups\n\nwithin Croatia to rebel against the lawful and democratically elected government of the\n\nRepublic of Croatia. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia directed and supported these\n\ngroups by providing military personnel, military supplies, and money to enable the\n\ninsurgent Serb rebels to oppose the work of regular and legitimate Croatian police. By July\n\n1991, the so-called JNA had used 19,029 artillery and rocket pieces, including 1,799 anti-\n\ntank guns, 4, 200 recoilless rifles, 6,400 mortars, and 2,000 anti-aircraft cannons against\n\nCroatia included approximately 1,000 tanks, 900 armoured troop carriers, 250 war planes\n\n90 helicopters, and 200 armed war vessels of the so-called JNA navy.\n\n12. In July 1991, there were already 30,000 registered displaced persons in Croatia. The\n\nlong list of displaced persons started with the persecution of the Croats from Lika in the\n\nspring of 1991, and intensified in the summer with the persecution of the Croats from the\n\nterritory of Banovina, Kordun, eastern Slavonia, western Slavonia, west Syrmium, Baranja,\n\nDalmatian hinterland, Drniš, and Knin. The peak of the refugee crisis occurred in November\n\n1991, when 600,000 displaced persons were registered in Croatia, including 15,000\n\nsurvivors of a massacre in Vukovar. The atrocities inflicted by the Serbs on Vukovar’s\n\npeople were brutal, and the resulting humanitarian crisis among displaced persons was\n\nunprecedented. In fact, the City of Vukovar, including countless historic buildings, and\n\ncultural and sacral artifacts, was completely destroyed by the so-called JNA.\n\n13. So far, in the period of time following 1995, Croatia has discovered and registered at\n\nleast 120 mass graves, mostly in the eastern Slavonia, Banovina, Dalmatia, and Knin\n\nregions. To date, the exhumation process has registered 2, 989 bodies in both mass and\n\nindividual graves. For example, in Ov čara, near Vukovar, a mass grave was discovered,\n\nfrom which some 200 bodies were e xhumed. These were the bodies of wounded persons\n\nand patients who had been taken from the Vukovar Hospital. At the mass grave at the New\n\nGraveyard of Vukovar, 938 bodies were found, and in Ba čin, 56 bodies, mostly of elderly\n\nvictims, were discovered in a mass grave. In Škabrnja, near Zadar, another mass grave was 12\n\nrecently discovered to contain 27 bodies. Also, in Vila Gavrilovi ć, near Petrinja, a mass\n\ngrave was found that contained 17 bodies.\n\n14. Prior to a cease-fire on 2 January 1992, the so-called JNA and the rebel Serbs were able\n\nto seize control of about one third of Croatia. This occupied area stretched from Prevlaka in\n\nthe south to Baranja on the Hungarian border, and was controlled by officials of the Federal\n\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. The Belgrade-backed Serbs occupied and established effective\n\ncontrol over the eastern Slavonia region of Croatia.\n\n15. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, in recruiting, training, arming, equipping,\n\nfinancing, supplying and otherwise encouraging, supporting, aiding, and directing military\n\nand paramilitary actions in and against the Republic of Croatia directly, and by means of its\n\nagents and surrogate, asserted de facto control over these areas in Croatia, such that it is\n\nliable for violations of the Genocide Convention that occurred on the territory of the\n\nRepublic of Croatia.\n\n16. The occupied territory was critical to Croatia. It included the land access routes to\n\nDalmatian coast tourist sites, most of Croatia’s petroleum resources, and a section cutting\n\nthe primary access route from Zagreb into Slavonia. Heavy and intensive Serb shelling\n\nattacks against coastal and inland targets, especially the ancient, walled city of Dubrovnik,\n\nkilled hundreds of civilians, destroyed property and virtually eliminated the tourist trade in\n\ncentral and southern Dalmatia.\n\n17. As a result of the aggression waged by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, its agents,\n\nofficials, and surrogates, Croatia and its citizens suffered the following damages:\n\n1. In Croatia, there were 20,000 dead and 55,000 wounded, with over 3,000 people\n\nstill unaccounted for.\n\n2. Out of the total number of victims, 303 children died, 35 children were taken\n\nprisoner and disappeared, and 1,276 children were wounded.\n\n3. 1,700 people were killed in Vukovar alone (1,100 of them were civilians), more\n\nthan 4,000people were wounded, between 3,000-5,000 taken prisoner, and 1,000\n\npeople are still unaccounted for.\n\n4. In 1992, the humanitarian crisis in Croatia was at its peak, with approximately\n\n800,000 displaced persons and refugees, which constituted more than 15% of the\n\ntotal population of Croatia.\n\n5. Several thousand Croat civilians were taken prisoner and forcibly transferred to\n\nSerbia and other areas of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Of the 7,000\n\npeople later released, 60% had spent time in prisons or detention facilities in\n\nSerbia.\n\n6. According to estimates by the National Commission for the Registration and\n\nAssessment of War Damages, 590 towns and villages suffered damage, 35 were\n\nrazed to the ground, with another 34 suffering significant damage.\n\n7. 1,821 cultural monuments were destroyed or damaged, including about 651 in\n\nthe area of Dubrovnik-Neretva County and about 356 in the area of Osijek-\n\nBaranja County.\n\n8. Three national parks, five natural parks, 19 special reservations, 10 parks, and 19\n\npark cultural monuments were damaged. 13\n\n9. 323 historical sites and settlements were destroyed or damaged.\n\n10. 171,000 housing units (constituting approximately 10% of the housing capacity\n\nof Croatia) were destroyed, often by arson.\n\n11. Approximately 450 Croatian Catholic churches were destroyed or severely\n\ndamaged, with lesser damage to over 250 others. In addition, approximately 151\n\nrectories, 31 monasteries, and 57 cemeteries were destroyed or severely\n\ndamaged.\n\n12. 210 libraries were destroyed or damaged (from school libraries to such famous\n\nlibraries as those in Dubrovnik).\n\n13. 22 journalists were killed, many of whom were trying to reveal the truth about the\n\naggression against Croatia.\n\n14. Estimates indicate that upwards of 3 million various explosive devices were\n\nplanted within Croatia, mostly anti-personnel and anti-tank devices. These mines\n\nare, for the most part, uncharted, and block about 300,000 hectares of arable\n\nland.\n\n15. About 25% of Croatia’s total economic capacity, including such large facilities as\n\nthe Adriatic Pipeline, was damaged or destroyed during 1991-1992.\n\nApproximately 10% of Croatia’s tourist facilities were damaged or destroyed by\n\nthe FRY-backed forces and agents.\n\n18. In January 1992, in Sarajevo, Croatia and the JNA signed a cease-fire brokered by Mr.\n\nCyrus Vance, former Secretary of State of the United States of America and a special envoy\n\nof the UN Secretary General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. In February 1992, the UN\n\nSecurity Council passed a resolution announcing the deployment of a protective,\n\npeacekeeping mission (hereinafter “UNPROFOR”) in Croatia. Pursuant to the plan,\n\nUNPROFOR was stationed in four different sectors, designated as United Nations Protected\n\nAreas (hereinafter “UNPA”).\n\n19. The intervention of UN forces in February 1992, while it ended the armed conflict\n\nwithin Croatia, froze a situation in which the aggressor retained control of the Croatian\n\nterritory it had seized illegally. This situation violated international law and the United\n\nNations Charter, and was unacceptable to Croatia. Virtually all Croats, other Croatian\n\ncitizens, and members of ethnic minorities (including Hungarians, Slovaks, Czechs,\n\nGermans, Roma and others) had either been killed or driven from their homes in these areas\n\nin the very first instance of ethnic cleansing by Mr. Miloševi ć’s Serbia. Such conduct by\n\nSerbian officials, backed by the Federal Republic o Yugoslavia, constitutes genocide, as\n\nwas recognised by United Nations General Assembly Resolution 47/121 (18 Dec. 1992).\n\nClearly, the conduct of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia violated the Genocide\n\nConvention. In addition, the United Nations General Assembly declared illegal, null, and\n\nvoid the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia’s “activities aimed at achieving the integration of\n\nthe occupied territories of Croatia into the administrative, military, educational,\n\ntransportation, and communications systems” of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, called\n\nupon the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to cease providing military and logistic support to\n\nthe occupying Serbs, and specifically and forcefully condemned the ethnic cleansing by the\n\nSerbs that had taken place in the UNPAs. United Nations General Assembly Resolution\n\n49/630 (1995). 14\n\n20. The Republic of Croatia, from the very beginning of the Federal Republic of\n\nYugoslavia’s aggression in 1991, tried to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the situation, but\n\nwas unsuccessful. In June 1995, in response to Serb violations of the 1992 cease-fire and\n\nthe killing of Croatian civilians, Croatia launched “Operation Flash,” swiftly liberating the\n\nSerb-occupied area of western Slavonia, opening the main highway between Zagreb and\n\nLipovac, and restoring law and order in the region.\n\n21. In August 1995, upon the recommendation of the international community, the Croatian\n\ngovernment and the Serbs from the occupied areas met in Geneva to try to reach a\n\nsettlement on the third stage of the peaceful reintegration of the occupied areas. The Serbian\n\ndelegation turned down all Croatian proposals, insisting that the “Republic of Serbian\n\nKrajina” was a state that wanted to be united only with other Serb lands. It was evident that\n\nthey wanted to be united only with other Serb lands. It was evident that they wanted to\n\nsecede from Croatia and become a part of a Greater Serbia built around the Federal\n\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. After all attempts to convince the Serbs to accept the settlement\n\nproposed by Croatia and supported by the international community failed, the Croatian\n\nArmy and the police launched “Operation Storm,” which, in just eighty-four hours, restored\n\nlegitimate Croatian governmental authority, law, and order within the areas of Knin,\n\nDalmatia, Lika, Kordun and Banija. This left only the areas of eastern Slavonia (including\n\nthe town of Vukovar) and Baranja under illegal Serb control.\n\n22. Immediately prior to the commencement of Operation storm, Serb officials, backed by\n\nthe federal Republic of Yugoslavia, ordered, directed, incited, and encouraged Serbs in the\n\nKnin region to withdraw from the area, cynically professing their belief that the Serbs would\n\nnot be safe after Croatia restored its authority over the area.\n\n23. These claims directly contravened assurances coming from the highest levels of the\n\nCroatian governmental, including President Tuđman, that the Serb population was safe and\n\nthat all civilians should remain in their homes while law and order in the area was restored.\n\nIndeed, the Croatian National Parliament, in the Charter on the Rights of the Serbs and\n\nother Nationalities, emphasised that:\n\nthe Republic of Croatia guarantees to the Serbs in Croatia and to all national\n\nminorities which live on its territory the respect of all human and civil rights,\n\nand\n\nespecially the freedom of expression and fostering of national language and\n\nculture,\n\nas well as political organisation. The Republic of Croatia protects the rights\n\nand interests of its citizens regardless of religion, ethnicity, or race....\n\nSerbs in Croatia and all the nationalities have the right to proportional\n\nparticipation in the local self-government bodies and respective bodies of\n\nstate authority, as well as to the provision of economic and social\n\ndevelopment for the purpose of preservation of their identity and for the\n\npurpose of protection from any attempt of assimilation....\n\nThese assurances notwithstanding, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, its officials, agents,\n\nand surrogates, undertook a campaign to effect the displacement of a large portion of the\n\nethnic Serb population from this region. Significantly, this behaviour by the authorities in\n\nBelgrade did not constitute an isolated action, but was part and parcel of a consistent pattern 15\n\nof conduct by the Milošević government, repeated in not just Croatia, but also in Bosnia and\n\nHerzegovina, and, most recently, in Kosovo.\n\n24. In fact, this action is a deliberate and calculated program designed by the Belgrade\n\nGovernment to clear an ethnic population, and constitutes “ethnic Cleansing” and genocide.\n\nMilošević’s purpose, both in Kosovo today and in Croatia in 1995, was to avoid any\n\nsituation where Serbs would have enjoyed a normal and peaceful life in a multiethnic\n\nsociety, because this would have fundamentally undermined the “justification” for\n\nBelgrade’s plans to create a Greater Serbia. This pernicious doctrine is predicated upon, at\n\nbest, the mistaken belief and, at worst, the cynical and self-serving assertion, that Serbs\n\ncannot enjoy security any state where they are not the dominant community. This conduct\n\nby the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia-backed Serbian officials (which, in the Kosovo\n\ncontext has been colloquially referred to as “self-cleansing”) constitutes “ethnic cleansing”\n\nand genocide in violation of the Genocide Convention.\n\n25. The actions taken by Croatia to restore order in the territories seized by the Belgrad-\n\ndirected Serb rebels, coupled with joint Croat-Muslim offensives in Bosnian and\n\nHerzegovina, as well as NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions, paved the way for\n\na diplomatic solution to the problems created by Serb aggression against Croatia and Bosnia\n\nand Herzegovina. In November 1995, an agreement was signed separately in Zagreb and in\n\nErdut (eastern Slavonia) by the Croatian Government and the Serbs from the remaining\n\noccupied areas, stipulating that western Srijem, eastern Slavonia and Baranja would be\n\ngradually and peacefully reintegrated with the rest of Croatia under the monitoring of the\n\ninternational community.\n\n26. These successful actions against the Serbs set the stage for the Bosnian peace accord\n\ninitialled in Dayton, Ohio (USA) on 21 November 1995, and formally signed in Paris on 14\n\nDecember 1995.\n\n27. Pursuant to the August 1996 Agreement on the Normalization of Relations between the\n\nRepublic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the two countries have been\n\nconducting negotiations for nearly three years on compensation for destroyed, damaged or\n\nmissing property. However, these negotiations have been unsuccessful, because the Federal\n\nRepublic of Yugoslavia has been acting in bad faith and has refused to provide\n\ncompensation for the damage that it caused on the territory of the Republic of Croatia which\n\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia effectively controlled during the 1991-1995 time\n\nperiod.\n\nII. URISDICTION OF THE C OURT\n\n28. The Court has jurisdiction in this case pursuant to Article 36(1) of its Statute, which\n\nprovides that the Court’s jurisdiction “comprises…all matters specially provided for in the\n\nCharter of the United Nations or in treaties and conventions in force.” Both the Republic of\n\nCroatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are successor States of the former Socialist\n\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia. In this regard, the Socialist Federal Republic of\n\nYugoslavia signed the Genocide Convention on 11 December 1948, and deposited its\n\ninstrument of ratification on 29 August 1950. Under the general principles and rules of\n\ninternational law, successor States continue to be bound by the treaty obligations of the\n\npredecessor State.\n\n29. Article IX of the Genocide Convention provides as follows: 16\n\nDisputes between the Contracting Parties relating to the interpretation application\n\nor fulfilment of the present Convention, including those relating to the\n\nresponsibility of a State for genocide or for any of the other acts enumerated in\n\nArticle III, shall be submitted to the International Court of Justice at the request of\n\nany of the parties to the dispute.\n\nBy committing the actions described in the “Statement of Facts” above, and many others\n\nthat will be detailed in later submissions, the Republic of Croatia submits that the Federal\n\nRepublic of Yugoslavia has violated its obligations under the Genocide Convention.\n\n30. The Conduct of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during the period referred to above\n\ndemonstrates clearly that there is a dispute between the Republic of Croatia and the federal\n\nRepublic of Yugoslavia, and that this dispute unquestionably relates to the interpretation\n\nand application of the Genocide Convention. Therefore, based upon Article 36(1) of the\n\nCourt’s Statute, and Article IX of the Genocide Convention, the Republic of Croatia\n\nsubmits that the Court has jurisdiction to hear its claims against the Federal Republic of\n\nYugoslavia arising under the Genocide Convention.\n\nIII THE C LAIMS OF THE EPUBLIC OF C ROATIA\n\n31. The Republic of Croatia asserts in this Application the commission of repeated and\n\nnumerous violations by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, its officials, agents and\n\nsurrogates, of the Genocide Convention. The Genocide Convention defines genocide as\n\nfollows:\n\nIn the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with\n\nintent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as\n\nsuch:\n\n1. Killing members of the group;\n\n2. Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;\n\n3. Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring\n\nabout its physical destruction in whole or in part;\n\n4. Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;\n\n5. Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\n\nGenocide Conv. Art. 2. The Genocide Convention outlaws the following acts:\n\n1. Genocide;\n\n2. Conspiracy to commit genocide;\n\n3. Direct and public incitement to commit genocide;\n\n4. Attempt to commit genocide;\n\n5. Complicity in genocide.\n\nId. at Art. 3.\n\n32. As indicated in the “Statement of Facts,” and as will be demonstrated in future\n\nsubmissions, the Republic of Croatia claims that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, its\n\nofficials, agents, and surrogates, have violated Articles II(a)-(d) and III(a)-(e) of the 17\n\nGenocide Convention with respect to the Republic of Croatia and its people. In particular,\n\nthe Republic of Croatia will demonstrate that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia violated\n\nthe Genocide Convention by seizing control of the Knin region and eastern Slavonia from\n\n1991 to 1995, shelling and attacking portions of Dalmatia, and driving Croat (and other\n\nnon-Serb) citizens from these areas with the intent to “ethnically cleanse” these regions, and\n\nto unit them with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to form a “greater” Serbian state.\n\n33. The Republic of Croatia will also demonstrate that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\n\ncommitted further violations of the Genocide Convention when, immediately prior to the\n\ncommencement of Operation Storm, it directed, instigated and coerced the Serb population\n\nliving in the Knin region to evacuate from the area, thus creating a second “ethnic\n\ncleansing” of the area.\n\n34. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia’s “abhorrent policy of ethnic cleansing” has, itself,\n\nspecifically been recognised as genocide by the United Nations General Assembly. See\n\nA/Res/47/121 (18 Dec. 192). As will be established in later submissions to the Court, in\n\npursuit of this policy in the Republic of Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, its\n\nofficials, agents and surrogates, engaged in killing members of the Croat and other ethnic\n\ncommunities; causing serious bodily or mental harm to the Croat and other ethnic\n\ncommunities; deliberately inflicted on the Croat and other ethnic communities conditions of\n\nlife calculated to bring about their physical destruction in whole or in part; and in imposing\n\nmeasures intended to prevent births within the Croat and other ethnic communities. All of\n\nthese actions were specifically and purposefully undertaken with the intent to destroy, in\n\nwhole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such.\n\n35. Moreover, under Article IV of the Genocide Convention, individuals who commit\n\ngenocide, or who commit any of the acts described in Article III, must be punished,\n\nregardless of their official or private status. In addition, under Article V, States parties must\n\nprovide effective penalties for persons guilty of genocide, or any of the acts described in\n\nArticle III. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has not punished individuals who\n\ncommitted acts of genocide, or other acts described in Article III, and it has not provided\n\nfor effective penalties for such persons. Indeed, it has on many occasions given refuge to\n\nsuch persons within its territory. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has, therefore, also\n\nviolated its obligations under Article IV and Article V of the Genocide Convention.\n\nIV.

The admission of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into the\n\nfamily of nations is of great significance, as it strengthens the universality of the United\n\nNations and thus enhances its legitimacy and effectiveness.\n\nEqually, I am confident, it strengthens the efforts by the international community to bring\n\nstability to South East Europe, efforts in which the United Nations plays in many ways the\n\nleading role.\n\nThe path leading to this moment has been long and troublesome. But today, we should look\n\nto the future and welcome the admission of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a\n\npromising new beginning. Today signals also the strength of the United Nations itself and\n\nits decisions.\n\nLess than a month ago, the whole world congratulated newly-elected President Koštunica\n\nand the people of his country for their success in assuring a peaceful victory towards\n\ndemocracy. We all held high regard for the people whose democratically expressed will\n\nprevailed over many obstacles. Their voices have been heard around the world, and the\n\nmovement towards democracy has gained new strength. 32\n\nMoreover, this change gave realistic hope for a solution to the remaining problems in the\n\nregion of South East Europe, based on the principles of peace, democracy, rule of law and\n\nhuman rights.\n\nThe admission of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to the United Nations signifies a new\n\nera in cooperation between the new Member State and the other Members of the United\n\nNations, including its neighbours and other successor States of the former Socialist Federal\n\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. The resolutions of the General Assembly on the strengthening of\n\ncooperation in the region of South East Europe will gain additional momentum. This will\n\nalso give new vigour to a number of regional initiatives.\n\nHere we welcome the recent admission of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into the\n\nStability Pact for South Eastern Europe. We can also envisage a new era in fulfilling many\n\nother goals of the United Nations Charter, including respect for human rights. All this will\n\ncontribute to the strengthening of regional stability, and international peace and security.\n\nThe United Nations and its Member States should be prepared to strengthen their support to\n\nthe region and to the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in addressing the\n\nmany remaining problems that need to be solved.\n\nToday we must look to the future while, at the same time, we remember that freedom carries\n\nwith it responsibilities, including those relating to the pursuit of justice. Cooperation with\n\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is of paramount importance\n\nfor all the countries concerned, including the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nFinally, I wish the Government and people of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia peace,\n\nprosperity and every success for the future. 33\n\nA NNEX 7:\n\nLETTER FROM THE ECRSTARY -GENERAL TO THE P RESIDENT OF THE ESURITY\n\nC OUNCIL , DATED 29 APRIL 1997\n\nS/1997/343\n\n29 April 1997\n\nI have the honour to refer to the elections held on 13 and 14 April 1997 in the region of\n\nEastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium placed under the transitional\n\nadministration of the United Nations and to bring to your attention the following\n\ninformation, which was forwarded to me by the Transitional Administrator.\n\nLocal elections for 25 municipal councils and three city councils within the United Nations\n\nTransitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium\n\n(UNTAES) region were conducted simultaneously with elections throughout Croatia on 13\n\nApril.

Owing to technical difficulties, particularly the late delivery of electoral\n\nmaterials, voting inside the region was extended to 14 April, and to 15 April in one polling\n\nlocation. Nearly 500 international observers were deployed thro ughout Croatia to observe\n\nthe elections. Within the UNTAES region, over 150 UNTAES observers were deployed to\n\nall polling stations as static monitors. In addition, 30 observer teams from the Organisation\n\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as observers from the Council of Europe\n\nand representatives of the diplomatic community visited numerous polling stations during\n\nthe elections. The Transitional Administrator has informed me that no intimidation, violence\n\nor electoral improprieties were observed or reported before, during or after the elections.\n\nThe framework for the elections in the region was defined by the Joint Implementation\n\nCommittee (JIC) on Elections, which met on a regular basis from early October 1996. In\n\naccordance with the Basic Agreement and under the agreed framework, voter eligibility was\n\ndefined to include the following four categories of persons for whom separate lists were\n\nprepared:\n\n(a) Residents of the region who were listed in the 1991 census and who stayed in\n\nthe region and collected their pre-printed Croatian documents (domovnica\n\nand identity card). A total of 69,158 persons in the region were registered\n\nunder this category;\n\n(b) Former residents of the region, mainly Croats, who left after the 1991 census\n\nand registered as displaced persons with the Office for Displaced Persons and\n\nRefugees. A total of 61,326 persons outside the region were registered under\n\nthis category;\n\n(c) Residents of the region who entered the region after the 1991 census, who\n\napplied for documents, filled out registration forms and chose to vote for\n\ncandidates to be elected to municipal or city councils within the region. A\n\ntotal of 10,086 persons in the region were registered under this category;\n\n(d) Residents of the region who entered the region after the 1991 census, applied\n\nfor documents, filled out registration forms, but chose to vote in absentia for\n\ncandidates to be elected to national, regional and local bodies in other parts of 34\n\nCroatia. A total of 1,692 persons in the region were registered under this\n\ncategory.\n\nPersons currently living in the region voted at 193 polling stations in the region, including\n\n30 locations for absentee voting for authorities outside the region. The displaced persons\n\nelsewhere in Croatia cast absentee ballots at 645 polling stations in 75 polling locations.\n\nThe final number of voters inside the region was over 71,000, of whom fewer than 1,000\n\n(out of the registered 1,692 persons) voted in absentia for the authorities to be elected in\n\ntheir former places of residence. This included a significant number of residents of the\n\nregion whose names did not appear on the list of voters but who were able to cast their votes\n\nowing to the special measures adopted by the Transitional Administrator on election day.\n\nThese special measures, which enabled all residents of the region with Croatian identity\n\ncards to cast a vote, were assessed positively by all international observers. UNTAES and\n\nthe Croatian Government will identify the total number of voters who fall into this category\n\nby verifying the number of voters recorded on the supplementary list of voters constructed\n\non the two election days. Over 56,000 persons cast their votes in absentia elsewhere in\n\nCroatia for the local authorities of the region.\n\nThe 28 Local Electoral Commissions (LECs), which were appointed by the JIC on Elections\n\non a multi-ethnic basis, were the competent bodies that conducted the elections in the\n\nregion. Their main functions included receiving candidate nominations, selecting polling\n\nsites, appointing polling station committees, amalgamating polling results and announcing\n\nfinal results for their respective municipalities or cities. The LECs were assisted in their\n\nwork by UNTAES electoral officers who had been appointed as electoral advisers. As the\n\nformal and final appointment of the LEC members was considerably delayed, most of the\n\npreparatory work was carried out by the electoral officers.\n\nAn electoral code of conduct was developed by the JIC on Elections, which laid out\n\nfundamental principles and rules to be followed by all participants in the electoral process.\n\nOn the recommendation of the JIC on Elections, the Transitional Administrator\n\npromulgated the code of conduct on the occasion of the formal announcement of the\n\nelections in the region on 11 March 1997. The JIC on Elections also appointed the Electoral\n\nAppeals Commission (EAC), composed of Serb and Croat jurists and chaired by an\n\nUNTAES-appointed international judge. The Media Experts commission (MEC) was\n\nappointed with a similar composition to monitor, inter alia, equitable access for all\n\nregistered political parties and candidates.\n\nAs required by the code of conduct, both Commissions have presented their final reports on\n\nthe conduct of the elections. EAC reported that most complaints received were either\n\ncorrected by the special measures adopted by the Transitional Administrator on election day\n\nor dismissed after due consideration. MEC reported that several infractions of the code of\n\nconduct were corrected by informal intervention. Both Commissions concluded that the free\n\nand fair character of the elections was not affected by these issues. Their final reports will\n\nbe considered by the JIC on Elections on 30 April.\n\nPreliminary results of the elections prepared by the LECs were announced by UNTAES on\n\n19 April (see annex). The elections held in the region were subsequently certified by the\n\nTransitional Administrator on 22 April 1997. Official and final results will be formally\n\nreported by the LECs to the JIC on Elections on Wednesday, 30 April. A 48-hour period for\n\npolitical parties to appeal the results will come into effect immediately after the final\n\nannouncement. Following these procedures, and provided that the results of the elections 35\n\nare finalised, the Transitional Administrator will be in a position to certify the final results,\n\nin accordance with the UNTAES mandate.\n\nThe Transitional Administrator has indicated to me that the successful holding of elections\n\nin the UNTAES-administered region has been an essential step for further progress in the\n\npeaceful reintegration of the region. It marks an important milestone for the legitimate\n\nrepresentation of the local population in the Croatian constitutional and legal system. It also\n\nopens the way for the two-way return of all displaced persons in Croatia. In this regard,\n\nrapid progress has been made in this area with the adoption by the Croatian Government, on\n\n24 April 1997, of the Agreed Procedures on Return.\n\nI should be grateful if you would bring the above to the attention of the members of the\n\nSecurity Council.\n\n(Signed) Kofi A.

The Croatian nation was governed vigilant in\n\ndefending the identity and sovereignty of its state. Even under the most difficult historical\n\ncircumstances. Croatia succeeded in retaining part of its national territory and its capital\n\nZagreb, with all the features of Croatian sovereignty.\n\nFrom the times of the Croatian rulers, the Croatian Sabor and the Croatian Ban (exercising\n\nthe authority of viceroy during state unions with other nations) took over the role of\n\nguardians and proponents of Croatia’s sovereignty. The Croatian Sabor has preserved the\n\ntraditions of Croatian historical law and maintained the identity of Croatian statehood\n\nthrough history, which makes the Croatian nation one of the oldest politically state-formed\n\nnations of Europe.\n\nII\n\nThe centralist, totalitarian system imposed by the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\n\nhindered the Republic of Croatia from promoting and protecting its political, economic,\n\ncultural and other interests, which led to an increasing desire on the hart of the Croatian\n\npeople to disassociate themselves from the Yugoslav state.\n\nToday we are confronted with attempts to destroy law and order and the integrity of the\n\nRepublic of Croatia by organised outlawry and terrorism instigated from outside the\n\nRepublic. This is aimed at obstructing the realisation of the will of the Croatian nation and\n\nall citizens of the Republic of Croatia, expressed at the elections and sanctioned by the\n\nConstitution of the Republic of Croatia, particularly at the referendum on Croat’s\n\nsovereignty and independence in relation to the remaining constituent Republics of the\n\nSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and other adjoining countries. 40\n\nThe Croatian nation together with all citizens who consider the Republic of Croatia as their\n\nhomeland is resolute in defending its independence and territorial integrity from any\n\naggression, no matter where it comes from.\n\nIII\n\nThe Republic of Croatia is a democratic, social state based on the rule of law, whose highest\n\nconstitutional values are: freedom, equal rights, national equality, love of peace, social\n\njustice, respect for human rights, pluralism, inviolability of oil ownership, conservation of\n\nnature, the rule of law and a democratic, multiparty system.\n\nThe Republic of Croatia guarantees to Serbs in Croatia and to all national minorities living\n\non its territory respect for all human and civil rights, particularly freedom of speech and the\n\ncultivation of their own languages and promotion of their cultures, and freedom to form\n\npolitical organisations.\n\nThe Republic of Croatia protects the rights and interests of its citizens regardless of their\n\nreligious or ethnic affiliation or race.\n\nThe Republic of Croatia in its capacity of the legal successor of the former Socialist Federal\n\nRepublic of Yugoslavia guarantees to all states and international organisations that it will\n\nfully and conscientiously exercise all rights and perform all obligations in the part relating\n\nto the Republic of Croatia.\n\nIV\n\nThe Constitutions of the Federal People’s Republic of Yugoslavia and of the Socialist\n\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia granted the Republic of Croatia the right to self-\n\ndetermination and secession.\n\nBeing established as an independent and sovereign state, the Republic of Croatia, which has\n\nup till now realised part of its sovereign rights together with the other constituent Republics\n\nand Autonomous Provinces of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, is now\n\nchanging its status and its state-law relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and\n\nagrees to take part in its individual institutions and functions of common interest conducive\n\nto the disassociation process.\n\nIn the course of the disassociation process it is necessary to establish the rights and\n\nobligations, i.e. the share of the Republic of Croatia in the total movable and immovable\n\nproperty and in the rights of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nBy proclaiming the Constitutional Decision on Independence, the Republic of Croatia has\n\nstarted the process of disassociation from other republics of the SFRY, and wants to\n\nterminate this process as soon as possible in a democratic and peaceful manner, respecting\n\nthe interests of all Republics and Autonomous Provinces making up the SFRY.\n\nBy proclaiming the Constitutional Decision on Independence, conditions have been created\n\nfor the recognition of the Republic of Croatia as an international legal entity, for which\n\npurpose the President and the Government of the Republic of Croatia will take all the\n\nnecessary steps.\n\nBy the Constitutional Decision the present borders of the Republic of Croatia have become\n\nstate borders with other Republics and with the countries adjoining the former Socialist\n\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia. 41\n\nOnly laws which have been adopted by the Sabor of the Republic of Croatia shall apply on\n\nthe territory of the Republic of Croatia, with the exception of the federal regulations which\n\nhave not been repealed pending the termination of the disassociation process.\n\nAll questions that cannot be resolved immediately, such as the position of the Yugoslav\n\nPeople’s Army, federal diplomacy, the division of mutual rights and obligations, shall be\n\nregulated by special agreements/treaties between the Republic of Croatia and other federal\n\nunits and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the course of the disassociation\n\nprocess. The Republic of Croatia will recognise only those federal institutions in which\n\ndecisions are reached on the basis of parity and agreement.\n\nFederal agencies may not operate on the territory of the Republic of Croatia unless given\n\nspecific and temporary authority by the Government of the Republic of Croatia.\n\nThe Republic of Croatia shall withdraw its representatives from the Federal Chamber of the\n\nSFRY Assembly, as its term expired and its existence rendered unnecessary in the process\n\nof disassociation.\n\nThe Republic of Croatia considers that the Chamber of Republics and Provinces is an\n\nappropriate forum for parliamentary debate on the problems involved in disassociation.\n\nV\n\nThe Republic of Croatia recognises full sovereignty and subjectivity under international law\n\nof the states which come into existence as a result of the disassociation from the SFRY with\n\nthe existing boundaries of the SFRY and within the boundaries among themselves, as laid\n\ndown in the present Constitution or as decided by democratic agreement among them.\n\nIn assuming independence and sovereignty, the Republic of Croatia does not wish to saver\n\nrelations with other republics, neither does it wish to cause disruption in economic, trade or\n\nfinancial relations or activities.\n\nThe Republic of Croatia shall establish a special contractual relationship with the Republic\n\nof Slovenia, thereby creating a union between the two independent sovereign states.\n\nThe Republic of Croatia calls upon other constituent Republics of the former SFRY to a\n\nunion of sovereign states based upon the following prerequisites; mutual recognition of state\n\nsovereignty and territorial integrity; mutual respect; acknowledgement of political pluralism\n\nand democracy, ownership pluralism, arid of a market-oriented economy; effective\n\nobservance of human rights, of minority rights and of other values of the free world;\n\nreadiness to arrive at reciprocal agreement and accord on all outstanding issues existing\n\nbetween individual republics in their capacity of sovereign states.\n\nThe Republic of Croatia proceeds from the position that a union of sovereign states with the\n\nRepublic of Slovenia, and with the other Republics, conceived as a contractual, voluntary\n\ncommunity based on common interests, could prove beneficial to all the republics that have\n\nhitherto constituted the SFRY, provided that mutual interests are observed in accordance\n\nwith the prevailing rules of international law, especially those on which the European\n\nCommunity is founded and being built, since these principles have proved to be viable and\n\neffective, and can serve as guidelines ensuring peace, prosperity and international respect\n\nfor the future union of sovereign states, prior to their accession to the European Community.\n\nClass: 010-03/91-02/5\n\nZagreb, June 25 1991 42\n\nANNEX 9:\n\nC ONSTITUTIONAL DECISION ON THE OSEREIGNTY AND NDEPEIDENCE OF THE\n\nR EPUBLIC OF CROATIA – 25 JUNE 1991\n\nPARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA (SABOR)\n\nPursuant to Article 140. paragraph 1. of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia.\n\nproceeding from the inalienable, inconsumable, indivisible and an transferable\n\nright of the Croatian nation to self-determination, including the right of\n\ndisassociation and association with other nations and States, and from the\n\nsovereignty of the Republic of Croatia rests in all its citizens,\n\nexecuting the will of the people as expressed at the referendum of May 19, 1991,\n\nin view of the fact that the SFRY does not function as a state in terms of a\n\nconstitutional and legal system, and that human rights, the rights of national\n\nminorities and the rights of federal units are being severely violated,\n\nbearing in mind that Yugoslavia’s federal system does not make it possible to\n\nresolve the state-political and economic crisis, and that no agreement has been\n\nreached among its constituent Republics that would make it possible to transform\n\nthe federal state into a union of sovereign states,\n\ndeclaring that the Republic of Croatia respects the equal rights of the other\n\nRepublics of the present-day SFRY in the wish gradually to regulate with them\n\non an equal footing and by democratic and peaceful means all issues arising from\n\ntheir common life to date; respecting their sovereignty and territorial integrity,\n\nand expressing readiness to reach with them, as an autonomous and independent\n\nState, agreement on economic, political, defence and other relations.\n\nthe Parliament of the Republic of Croatia is hereby enacting the\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL DECISION ON THE SOVEREIGNTY\n\nAND INDEPENDENCE OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA\n\nI\n\nThe Republic of Croatia is hereby proclaimed a sovereign and independent state.\n\nII\n\nBy this act the Republic of Croatia initiates proceedings for disassociation from the other\n\nrepublics and from the SFRY.\n\nThe Republic of Croatia is initiating proceedings for international recognition.\n\nIII\n\nInternational agreements concluded and acceded to by the SFRY shall apply in the Republic\n\nof Croatia provided they do not conflict with the Constitution and legal system of the\n\nRepublic of Croatia, on the basis of the rules of international law on state succession\n\nrelating to international agreements. 43\n\nIV\n\nOn the territory of the Republic of Croatia only those laws shall be in force, which have\n\nbeen passed by the Croatian Parliament (Sabor) and those federal laws, which have not been\n\nrepealed shall be enforced until the completion of disassociation.\n\nThe Republic of Croatia assumes all the rights and obligations that were transferred to the\n\nSFRY by the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia and the Constitution of the SFRY.\n\nProcedure for assuming these rights and duties shall be prescribed by the Constitutional Act.\n\nV\n\nThe state boundaries of the Republic of Croatia are the internationally recognised state\n\nboundaries of the present-day SFRY in part which relates to the Republic of Croatia, and\n\nthe boundaries between the Republic of Croatia and the Republics of Slovenia, Bosnia and\n\nHerzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro within the framework of the present-day SFRY.\n\nVI\n\nAccepting the principles of the Paris Charter, the Republic of Croatia guarantees to all its\n\ncitizens their national and all other fundamental rights and freedoms of human being and the\n\ncitizen, a democratic order, the rule of law and other greatest values of its constitutional\n\norder and the international legal order.\n\nVII\n\nThe present Constitutional Decision shall come into force upon promulgation by the\n\nParliament of the Republic of Croatia.\n\nClass: 010-03/91-02/06\n\nZagreb, 25 June 1991 44\n\nA NNEX 10:\n\nDECISION ON THE OSEREIGNTY AND NDEPEIDENCE\n\nOF THE R EPUBLIC OF CROATIA , 8 OTOBER 1991\n\nIn accordance with the inalienable right of the Republic of Croatia for self- determination.\n\n1. starting from the will of citizens of the Republic of Croatia expressed on the\n\nreferendum from May 19, 1991.\n\n2. starting from the Constitutional Decision on sovereignty and independence of\n\nthe Republic of Croatia and from the Declaration on the Proclamation of the\n\nIndependent and Sovereign Republic of Croatia which was proclaimed on the\n\nsession of the Parliament of the Republic of Croatia held on June 25, 1991.\n\n3. stating that the thre"
