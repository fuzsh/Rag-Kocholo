        "text": "Serbian media are reporting that Jelena Jankovic gave birth to a baby girl in Belgrade on the morning of April 6.\n\nThe former world No.1 has been silent on her Instagram since last July, so it’s no surprise that she’s not personally updating us about this big event in her life.\n\nWe learned about JJ’s pregnancy in November 2020. That’s also when we heard that the baby father was Serbian doctor Branko Barac, whom Jankovic reportedly met while taking a coronavirus test following Novak Djokovic’s Adria Tour exhibition tournament in Belgrade last spring."
