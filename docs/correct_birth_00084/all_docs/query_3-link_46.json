        "meta_description": "The aim of this study is to examine consumers’ perception of the products considering\nanimal welfare and to establish the factors which affect consumers’ willingness to pay\nthe premium price for the animal-friendly products. In addition, four consumers’ profiles\naccording to their attitudes towards farm animals’ welfare are distinguished and their\nfeatures are elaborated. The research has been undertaken in Belgrade, comprising\n198 participants. The face-to-face interview technique has been adopted, while for\nthe analysis of the results regression and cluster analyses have been performed. The\nfindings suggest that food sector stakeholders should put more efforts in providing\ninformation and education to the consumers regarding the importance of animal\nwelfare and that there is a significant market potential for the introduction of the label\nfor animal-friendly products. The implications for policy makers are proposed and\ndiscussed too.\nVeljković, Saša; Stojanović, Žaklina; Filipović, Jelena",
