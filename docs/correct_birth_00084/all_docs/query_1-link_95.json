        "text": "The women's world No 3 singles player told Britain's leading doubles specialist that reluctantly she cannot renew the team whose victory provided some unlikely domestic success at Wimbledon 2007.\n\nChemistry: Murray (left) and Jankovic won the 2007 Wimbledon mixed doubles\n\nThe 23-year-old Serb, whose on-court flirting with Murray convinced many that there was more to their chemistry than mere backhands and forehands, has decided she must concentrate on loftier goals this time round. As one of around six players with realistic ambitions of lifting the main title, she wants to conserve her energies for that.\n\n'It was great fun playing with Jamie but particularly if you get rain delays like you did last year and the schedule becomes busy it can be very tiring,' said Jankovic.\n\n'I was joking with him that I would only play with him again if he gets his haircut but the serious thing is that I have to think about the singles. It would be great to play with him again at some time in the future.'\n\nThere are no hard feelings on the part of Murray. 'It's a shame but I was half-expecting it and I understand her decision,' said Murray, who was playing yesterday in the second round of the Jamie's more celebrated brother, Andy, is back in singles action today at the Artois, having lost in the men's doubles yesterday.\n\nHe takes on the dangerous Latvian Ernests Gulbis, who reached the quarter-finals of the French Open last week. Yet to turn 20, Gulbis pushed Novak Djokovic extremely hard at Roland Garros. Although he has little track record on grass, Gulbis possesses a superb serve.\n\nYesterday he defeated Italy's Andreas Seppi 6-3, 6-7, 6-3 and must now tackle the British No 1, of whom he confessed he had no first-hand experience.\n\n'I've never played with him or practised with him but I have seen his matches on TV,' said Gulbis. 'He has played more on grass than me but I think my game is suited to it. It's not going to be a problem to be pumped up.'\n\nAna Ivanovic yesterday pulled out of the Eastbourne grasscourt tournament next week citing fatigue and a vague thigh muscle injury.\n\nWhile mentioning the physical problem, she admitted that her disappointing no-show was down to being just plain tired. 'I am also mentally exhausted. I am not ready to compete so soon after completing my first Grand Slam (title win).'\n\nHers is the latest big pull-out to affect the women's grasscourt tournaments in this country and hardly helps the Lawn Tennis Association's search for a new umbrella sponsor.\n\nThere was also on-court disappointment at the DFS Classic in Birmingham where Britain's Naomi Cavaday and Katie O'Brien both lost tight three-set matches in the second round, leaving Melanie South as the sole home survivor in the third. Artois Championships with his regular men's doubles partner, Max Mirnyi.\n\nThey defeated Lleyton Hewitt and Chris Guccione. Since last Wimbledon, Murray has teamed up with veteran Durban-born doubles expert Liezel Huber, 31, in the mixed at Grand Slam events and they managed to reach the semi-finals of the U.S. Open last September."
