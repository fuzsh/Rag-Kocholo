        "text": "It’s been a long time since we last heard from Jelena Jankovic. Ever since meeting her now-husband and then becoming a mom, the former world number one has kept her private life absolutely to herself.\n\nWhile most WTA players show their babies the moment they’re born and then share their motherhood experiences with the world, the 2008 US Open finalist seems to have disappeared. Truth be told, ever since she played her last tennis match in September 2017, Jankovic has largely kept herself away from the public eye. Only from time to time she posted some travel photos on Instagram."
