        "text": "There is a medical condition called pseudobulbar affect (PBA). It causes its sufferers to laugh or cry (or both) uncontrollably. It can lead to weeping and often has absolutely nothing to do with how the person is actually feeling.\n\nIn Joker, Arthur Fleck suffers from PBA. He even has to carry a card with him to let people know about his condition that reads, \"Forgive my laughter. I have a condition.\" When Fleck is nervous or in a stressful situation, he produces painful, cacophonous laughter.\n\nFleck's laughter is off-putting and awkward, far from the pleasant jolliness typically associated with laughing. It makes the people around him uncomfortable and perhaps even scared. In order to prepare for the role, Phoenix studied videos of people affected by PBA.\n\n\"I started [with the laugh],\" Phoenix said. \"I watched videos of people suffering from pathological laughter, a neurological disorder that makes individuals laugh uncontrollably.\"\n\nTodd Phillips really wanted Joaquin Phoenix for the role that would eventually earn him his first Academy Award. The dramatic actor had previously avoided superhero movies, and even basic genre films.\n\n\"It was a pursuit to get him because initially it feels like, 'Ugh, comic book movie.' Just the idea of it is something he wasn't so keen on pursuing, and even when I would explain to him, 'It's not that, it kind of says that, but really, we're doing this other thing,' there was a little resistance,\" said Phillips.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix eventually agreed to put aside his previous superhero movie notions and take on the complex role of the Joker's origin story. The actor just never let Phillips know about his change of heart. \"...Then one day, he magically showed up. He never said yes. He just one day showed up to a wardrobe fitting... It was an incredible partnership,\" said Phillips.\n\nThere was certainly some tension between Joaquin Phoenix and Robert De Niro. The former may have been the movie's titular star, but the latter was still one of the biggest stars in the history of Hollywood.\n\nDe Niro wanted to get together for a read-through prior to the start of production. Phoenix, on the other hand, is not a fan of the customary read-through process. Todd Phillips had to find a way to deal with the vastly differing preparation styles. He recalls:\n\nBob called me and he goes, \"Tell him he's an actor and he's got to be there. I like to hear the whole movie, and we're going to all get in a room and just read it.\" And I'm in-between a rock and a hard place because Joaquin's like, \"There's no f**king way I'm doing a read-through,\" and Bob's like, \"I do read-throughs before we shoot, that's what we do.\"\n\nThe Hollywood veteran got his way, and a read-through took place at De Niro's office in New York City. However, even if Phoenix attended the meeting, he reportedly mumbled and sulked through much of the process. Afterwards, the Taxi Driver actor asked to speak privately to Phoenix, who initially denied the request.\n\nThe method actors reportedly talked it out. Phillips said that De Niro cupped Phoenix's face with his hands and even smacked him with a kiss on the cheek. De Niro assured him, \"It's going to be okay, bubbeleh.\"\n\nDe Niro later said of Phoenix, \"Joaquin was very intense in what he was doing, as it should be, as he should be.\"\n\nSomehow, Warner Bros. knew to just let Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix do their thing. Producers handed Joker filmmakers $55 million and basically stepped off - a rarity in modern-day movie production.\n\nPhillips was constantly tinkering with the film's script. Actors had to adjust and improvise to accommodate the daily script changes. The madness definitely suited Phoenix, who grew more and more improvisational as his character shifted from Arthur Fleck into the Joker.\n\nPhoenix more than earned his Academy Award for best actor by expanding what was written on the page and taking Joker to a new height of surreal insanity. The film's cinematographer Lawrence Sher discussed the one-take scene when Phoenix unexpectedly climbs into the refrigerator:\n\nWhile some scenes were very planned out, like when he’s in the phone booth or walking up the stairs, others had no plan at all. When he climbed in the refrigerator, we had no idea he was going to do that. We set up two camera positions, and Joaquin just thought about what he would do if he was a massive insomniac. Again, we lit it so he could go anywhere, and the first and only time he did it, we were mesmerized. I remember thinking, \"What is he doing? Did he just crawl in the fridge?\" It was as fun and weird for us to watch it, too.\n\nFleck's bathroom dance following his subway murder spree was also improvised. Sher explained:\n\nJoaquin created that whole dance and, after the success of that scene, we started creating more moments like that. Like when he's playing with the gun and fires it into the wall. All we knew was that he'd fire the gun into the wall at some point, but we never planned when or knew that he'd stand and have that conversation with himself and begin dancing. We just had two cameras in there and let it happen, which became a major part of how we did a lot of things.\n\nWhat happens when two method actors work together on the same movie? Chances are, if their characters are not friendly in the film, then the actors who portray them won't be friendly off-screen, either.\n\nRobert De Niro plays talk show host Murray Franklin in Joker. The longtime TV personality is not happy that the latest media sensation Arthur Fleck will be on his show and lets everyone know exactly how he feels. Franklin is one key cog in Arthur's collapse into a ruthless sociopath. The actors only have one significant scene together in the movie, and it's a shocking one.\n\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise that both Phoenix and De Niro saw absolutely no reason to converse with one another unless the cameras were rolling.\n\n\"I didn't like to talk to him on set,\" admits Phoenix. \"The first day we said good morning, and beyond that, I don't know that we talked much.\"\n\n\"His character and my character, we didn't need to talk about anything,\" added De Niro. \"We just say, 'Do the work. Relate as the characters to each other.' It makes it simpler, and we don't [talk]. There's no reason to.\"\n\nTypically, composers write the score to a film after it has been shot. Music scores help to tell the story and set the emotional mood.\n\nTodd Phillips had heard some of Icelandic composer Hildur Guðnadóttir's previous work. The veteran director sent her the script for Joker before a single frame of his movie was shot. It was the first time that Phillips had ever done this.\n\nGuðnadóttir loved the script and got to work. \"I thought it was really important to try to go into Arthur's head, and try to make music from that place - what it meant to be Arthur, how Arthur felt,\" she said. \"And I really felt for him. He's just a simple, beautiful human being.\"\n\nPhillips would often play the score on set during production. The memorable scene when Phoenix starts dancing in the bathroom after taking several lives was inspired by the composer's score. Initially, the actor and director weren't nailing the scene. Phillips played some of Guðnadóttir's score, and Phoenix began to dance. Phillips told a cameraman to just start filming with a handheld. The scene turned out so well that Phillips decided to use it in the film's trailer.\n\n\"It's this kind of transformational scene where he becomes the Joker... But he told me a few weeks ago... that he was having a bit of a hard time getting into the character and finding this transformation,\" Guðnadóttir said. \"And the director started playing this music to him on set. And so this scene... is Joaquin’s response to the music. He's actually doing a real-time interpretation of the music.\"\n\nGuðnadóttir's score not only inspired the actors, but also won the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best original score."
