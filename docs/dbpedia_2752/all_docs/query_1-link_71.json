        "text": "Joker is King of the Philippine box-office this weekend with an explosive opening that overpowered the competition, demolished records and satisfied fans.\n\nWith unprecedented interest and fan curiosity for one of the most fascinating villains in the history of the superhero genre, Joker posted a four-day opening weekend gross of P77.2-million from 354 screens with 302,506 total admissions. The film became the third movie from Warner to open at No.1 this year, after the blockbusters Shazam! and IT Chapter Two.\n\nLead actor Joaquin Phoenix’s bravura performance also garnered universal acclaim that sparked the trending #GiveJoaquinTheOscarNow.\n\nEn route to a wild victory at the box-office, Joker dethroned the Biggest Opening Weekend record for an R-16-rated movie (or higher) from Warner, besting 2014’s 300: Rise of an Empire (P66.9-M).\n\nThe film also now holds the record for the Biggest Opening Weekend for a Todd Phillips movie, more than doubling 2013’s The Hangover Part III (P32.4-M).\n\nJoker’s Top Three biggest-grossing cinemas in the country are Trinoma (P2.4-M), Glorietta 4 (P2.39-M) and Powerplant (P2.35-M).\n\nBreaking into the Top Fifteen are SM Megamall (P2.2-M), SM Mall of Asia (P2.08-M), Uptown Mall (P1.64-M), Ayala Center Cebu (P1.61-M), Greenbelt 3 (P1.59-M), Red Carpet-Shang (P1.56-M), SM North EDSA (P1.49-M), U.P. Town Center (P1.426-M), Bonifacio High Street (P1.422-M), Theatremall (P1.34-M), Alabang Town Center (P1.26-M) and Robinsons Magnolia (P1.19-M).\n\nRounding up the Top Thirty are Gateway Cineplex (P1.14-M), SM Aura (P1.11-M), Eastwood (P1.03-M), Fisher Mall (P956,940), SM Baguio (P952,320), Robinsons Ermita (P922,250), SM Cebu (P910,542), Vista Mall Evia (P910,320), Ayala Manila Bay (P804,432), Abreeza Davao (P802,165), Ayala The 30th (P794,632), Newport (P749,880), Ayala Vertis (P727,075), SM Seaside Cebu (P707,034) and Fairview Terraces (P695,050).\n\nJoker is rated R-16 Without Cuts by the Movie and Television Review & Classification Board (MTRCB) for its violent content and serious themes. The film earlier won the coveted Golden Lion prize at this year’s edition of the prestigious Venice Film Festival, boosting its stature as prime contender for the upcoming Academy Awards.\n\nNow playing in Philippine cinemas, Joker is distributed in the Philippines by Warner Bros. Pictures, a WarnerMedia Company.\n\nHaven't seen it? Check out the film's Trailer.\n\nIn its official review report, the MTRCB writes, “Viewers are advised that the film deals with mature themes…There are scenes depicting graphic violence and gore, the treatment of which is not suitable for children, and use of strong swear words throughout. Only viewers sixteen (16) years of age and above may be admitted.”"
