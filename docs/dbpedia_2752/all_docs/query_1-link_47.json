        "text": "01 of 52\n\nAvatar (2009) - $2,923,706,026\n\nJames Cameron is no stranger to making hit movies, but his ambitious CGI project Avatar was a massive gamble when it was released in 2009 due to its whopping $237 million budget. But thanks to a lush world, great action, and excellent performances by Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver and Zoe Saldaña, the movie became a smash hit. It’s held the title of the highest-grossing movie of all time for 14 years and counting.\n\n02 of 52\n\nAvengers: Endgame (2019) - $2,799,439,100\n\nAvengers: Endgame picked up a few days after the previous film, Avengers: Infinity War, when Thanos erased half of all life in the universe. Endgame was made as the finale of the Avengers series (for now) and was filled with a surprisingly heavy dose of emotion for a superhero movie — including a certain hero’s tragic death at the end, which set fans and the internet ablaze.\n\n03 of 52\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water (2022) - $2,320,250,281\n\nAfter 13 years, the world finally got to see Cameron’s long-awaited Avatar sequel. With newer CGI technology and a much deeper story, it proved to be well worth the wait, and The Way of Water became a massive hit around the globe. The film’s success has also paved the way for more sequels.\n\n“I know what I’m going to be doing for the next six or seven years,” Cameron jokingly told Variety in early 2023 after The Way of Water crossed the $2 billion mark.\n\n04 of 52\n\nTitanic (1997) - $2,264,743,305\n\n1997’s Titanic was the highest-grossing movie of all time for over a decade until the release of Avatar in 2009. What’s more impressive is that both films were directed by Cameron, who has directed three of the top five highest-grossing movies of all time.\n\nThe director told PEOPLE in 2012 that Leonardo DiCaprio almost turned down the part in Titanic. “His character doesn't go through torment, and Leo previously and subsequently in his career was always looking for that dark cloud,” Cameron said. Luckily, the director was able to convince DiCaprio to take the part.\n\n05 of 52\n\nStar Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015) - $2,071,310,218\n\nA decade after Episode III premiered, the Star Wars franchise returned once again with The Force Awakens. The movie received tons of publicity, not only because it was the first new Star Wars film in a decade but also because its three original stars — Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill — all reprised their roles. Fisher was even able to star alongside her daughter, actress Billie Lourd. It remains the only Star Wars film to cross the $2 billion milestone.\n\n06 of 52\n\nAvengers: Infinity War (2018) - $2,052,415,039\n\nInfinity War followed Thanos as he gathered the six Infinity Stones and concluded with “the snap,\" where he eliminated half of all life in the universe. The movie was also noticeable for its large ensemble cast, bringing together characters from The Avengers, Spider-Man, Black Panther, Guardians of the Galaxy and Dr. Strange franchises.\n\nAfter the film’s premiere in 2018, Mark Ruffalo said that he didn’t know if his character, The Hulk, would survive the snap, admitting they did two takes, one where he survives and one where he doesn’t. Ruffalo said he was unaware of what ending they used until the premiere.\n\n07 of 52\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home (2021) - $1,921,847,111\n\nNot only was Spider-Man: No Way Home a massive hit, but it also went viral for recreating one of the internet’s greatest memes. Thanks to its use of multidimensions, both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield reprised their roles as Spider-Man, and according to Tom Holland, the trio have remained close since filming and even have a group chat together called “The Spider-Boys.”\n\n08 of 52\n\nJurassic World (2015) - $1,671,537,444\n\nAlmost 15 years after Jurassic Park III premiered, Jurassic World brought the franchise back to life. With a new cast that included Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, the film saw the dinosaur theme park finally open to the public ... but, naturally, things don’t go as planned.\n\n09 of 52\n\nThe Lion King (2019) - $1,663,075,401\n\nThe original The Lion King from 1994 was a box office smash itself, earning over $968 million. But the 2019 remake, which starred Hollywood heavyweights like Beyoncé, Donald Glover and Seth Rogen, became even more successful. The Lion King also holds the record for the biggest July opening weekend, bringing in nearly $192 million in just a single weekend.\n\n10 of 52\n\nThe Avengers (2012) - $1,520,538,536\n\nWhen it was released in 2012, The Avengers was the third highest-grossing movie of all time. It was one of the first superhero ensemble films with a massive A-list talent roster, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson.\n\n11 of 52\n\nFurious 7 (2015) - $1,515,341,399\n\nThe Fast and the Furious franchise has had a wild ride. The seventh installment in the franchise, which premiered in 2015, saw the most box-office success. Furious 7 was also actor Paul Walker's final movie, as he died in a car accident in the midst of filming. To help finish the film, Walker's brothers Caleb and Cody doubled for the actor in critical scenes to help finish his character's storyline.\n\n12 of 52\n\nTop Gun: Maverick (2022) - $1,495,696,292\n\n36 years after Top Gun premiered, Tom Cruise's Capt. Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell returned to the big screen in Top Gun: Maverick. The film became the second highest-grossing film of the year and received several Oscar nominations.\n\nCruise told PEOPLE he had the entire cast film their scenes in actual airplanes rather than using CGI in order to make the movie look and feel more real. “I had to teach them how to first fly in a single-engine Cessna,” the actor said. “Then I put them in an airplane where they could do some aerobatics. Then a jet where they could pull serious Gs and feel what it's like with an ejector seat. The first day they're in the F-18, they're filming.”\n\n13 of 52\n\nFrozen II (2019) - $1,453,683,476\n\nJust a few months after Disney unleashed the blockbuster The Lion King remake in 2019, it scored another massive hit with Frozen II. The sequel revisits Elsa and Anna and explores the origins of Elsa’s mysterious powers. Since 2019’s The Lion King is considered a live-action movie, Frozen II reigns as the highest-grossing animated movie of all time.\n\n14 of 52\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron (2015) - $1,405,018,048\n\nAs the first Avengers sequel, Age of Ultron broadened the original’s cast with the inclusion of the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Vision (Paul Bettany), Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and the film’s titular Ultron (James Spader). Though the 2015 film made an impressive $1.4 million at the box office, it is the lowest-grossing Avengers movie to date.\n\n15 of 52\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023) - $1,352,756,895\n\nThanks to its all-star cast that included Chris Pratt, Jack Black and Anya Taylor-Joy, combined with its wide list of classic Nintendo characters like Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong and Peach, The Super Mario Bros. Movie became 2023’s first massive blockbuster hit. It also holds the title of the second highest-earning animated film of all time and is currently the highest-grossing video game movie ever.\n\n16 of 52\n\nBlack Panther (2018) - $1,349,926,083\n\nUntil Spider-Man: No Way Home in 2021, Black Panther was the highest-grossing solo superhero film ever. Played by the late Chadwick Boseman, the Black Panther first appeared in 2016’s Captain America: Civil War before getting his own standalone film in 2018. Black Panther also received a sequel in 2022, Wakanda Forever. Though it didn’t cross the $1 billion mark like the first film, it was critically praised, even earning five Oscar nominations, including a Best Supporting Actress nomination for Angela Bassett.\n\n17 of 52\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011) - $1,342,359,942\n\nServing as the finale to the Harry Potter film series, Deathly Hallows: Part 2 was a sensation when it was released. The movie was filled with plenty of memorable moments and went on to become the highest-grossing movie of 2011.\n\n18 of 52\n\nStar Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017) - $1,334,407,706\n\nReleased almost exactly one year after the death of Carrie Fisher, The Last Jedi was seen by many as a farewell to the late star who iconically portrayed the fierce and brave Princess Leia. Her Star Wars costars told PEOPLE that Fisher was a joy to be around on set, recalling her telling jokes, helping the younger actors, and even sneaking costar John Boyega chocolate bars. The movie proved to be a touching send-off to the actress and became the highest-grossing film of 2017.\n\n19 of 52\n\nJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018) - $1,310,466,296\n\nJurassic World’s sequel Fallen Kingdom managed to bring in a massive box office haul. The movie sets the stage for the final film in the series by showing how the dinosaurs escape the doomed Isla Nublar and eventually cohabitate on the planet alongside humans.\n\nChris Pratt told PEOPLE that he did his own stunts for the film, but also admitted he hurt his elbow during one of the stunts, saying, “I banged my elbow so hard. But I was immediately embarrassed and I wasn’t gonna say anything.”\n\n20 of 52\n\nFrozen (2013) - $1,284,540,518\n\nReleased in 2013, Frozen became a smash hit, making over $1.2 billion. Idina Menzel’s “Let It Go” went on to win an Oscar and a Grammy as well. In 2023, Disney announced a third film is in the works.\n\n21 of 52\n\nBeauty and the Beast (2017) - $1,266,115,964\n\nDisney built up a lot of hype for its live adaptation of Beauty and the Beast starring Emma Watson, and thanks to its excellent music and lavish sets, the movie became a massive hit. The film also saw a resurgence in popularity in 2020 during the COVID pandemic. Three years after its initial release, Beauty and the Beast once again topped the weekly box office charts thanks to its showings at drive-in theaters across America.\n\n22 of 52\n\nIncredibles 2 (2018) - $1,243,225,667\n\nDespite The Incredibles being a massive hit when it premiered in 2004, earning over $631 million at the box office, it didn’t receive a sequel for 14 years. Luckily, Incredibles 2 was even more popular than the original, nearly doubling the box office returns of the first film. To coincide with the film’s release, Disneyland re-themed its California Screamin’ roller coaster to the Incredicoaster.\n\n23 of 52\n\nThe Fate of the Furious (2017) - $1,236,005,118\n\nMore automotive hijinks ensued in 2017’s The Fate of the Furious. This time, the group gets caught up in terrorism, espionage, and yet another heist. The cast (which grows with every movie) added more actors to the Fast family, including Charlize Theron, Scott Eastwood and Helen Mirren. To date, The Fate of the Furious is the last film in the franchise to make over a billion at the box office.\n\n24 of 52\n\nIron Man 3 (2013) - $1,215,577,205\n\nIn 2013, Iron Man had its last standalone film, Iron Man 3. The movie holds a complicated and contested record as the highest-grossing movie of 2013. Technically speaking, come Dec. 31, 2013, Iron Man had made the most money of any film released that year. However, Frozen, which was released in November 2013, continued earning hundreds of millions into 2014, ultimately making it 2013’s biggest film.\n\n25 of 52\n\nMinions (2015) - $1,159,444,662\n\nIn 2010, Despicable Me became a runaway smash hit. Made on a budget of just $69 million, it grossed over $543 million at the box office and spawned a franchise. Its spinoff, Minions, performed even better and is currently the highest-grossing movie in the franchise. In the original film, the little yellow henchmen stole every scene they were in, instantly becoming fan favorites and earning themselves their own film series.\n\n26 of 52\n\nCaptain America: Civil War (2016) - $1,155,046,416\n\nCaptain America: Civil War received fantastic reviews from critics and audiences, and the chemistry between Chris Evans and Anthony Mackie made the movie feel convincing and powerful. Evans told PEOPLE the real emotional power of the film came from questioning what’s right and wrong.\n\n“In the majority of the Marvel films, it’s clear to understand who’s right, who’s wrong,” the actor said. “In the first Captain America, Nazis are bad. First Avengers, aliens are no good. This is the first movie where it’s a little more parallel to the arguments we have in life where nobody’s right, nobody’s wrong. It’s just a matter of opinion. Where do you fall in the situation.”\n\n27 of 52\n\nAquaman (2018) - $1,148,528,393\n\nThe DCEU’s highest-earning film ever is 2018’s Aquaman, starring Jason Mamoa as the titular character. The movie made over $1.1 billion worldwide, and a sequel is set to release in December 2023.\n\n28 of 52\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) - $1,147,633,833\n\nThe final Lord of the Rings film was a total phenomenon. At the time of release, it was the second highest-grossing movie of all time and the second movie ever to make over $1 billion at the box office, after Titanic. On top of its ticket sales, The Return of the King was also critically lauded. It was nominated for 11 Oscars and won every single one of them, including Best Picture and Best Director.\n\n29 of 52\n\nSkyfall (2012) - $1,142,471,295\n\nStarring Daniel Craig as James Bond, Skyfall is the highest-grossing 007 film.
