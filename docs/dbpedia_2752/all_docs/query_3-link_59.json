        "text": "At the time of writing this, the film, ‘The Joker’, starring Joaquin Phoenix and directed by Todd Phillips, is quickly approaching the well coveted 1 billion mark in the box office. This is impressive because the film was forced to overcome a number of obstacles in order to become as successful as it has been. All of these reasons, however, you could argue, fall under one theme - censorship.\n\nAs a creative and a storyteller, censorship is actually something I really can’t stand. There are a lot of common sense restrictions on what you can and can’t say. The big three have always been, 1) the content watershed on broadcast media, 2) calling for violence against individuals, and 3) inciting panic.\n\nThose are common sense restrictions for public safety, but to stop any artistic expression outside of that and I think you're making a big mistake. Lately there's been an increased discussion about how China's harsh censorship laws are affecting the quality of our own media, and I can understand the irritation of having to pander to their bizarre rules.\n\nCan We Live Without China\n\nI can’t say how proud I am that certain films and shows are hitting out at the dependency of China while growing more successful than anyone could have realized. ‘The Joker’ (who we’ll talk more about later), as well as ‘South Park’, have recently defied convention and have outright stated that they will not sacrifice the quality and message of their art just so they can appeal to China’s censors.\n\nChina has, unfortunately, also become one of the one of the largest single markets for consuming film an d television in the world. Chinese audiences roughly make up 35% to 40% of any Hollywood films gross. To ignore this market is detrimental when trying to account for your profit, especially with the hilariously bloated budgets many international releases see these days.\n\n‘Avengers Endgame’, for example, has had one of the largest budgets of any film in cinema history. Marvel and Disney issued it a $356 million production budget, with a $200 million marketing budget in order to make the film profitable. ‘Endgame’, to their credit, then went on to make $2.8 billion in gross box office, but a significant portion of this money came from Chinese audiences, who Disney have been careful to stay on good side with. Without China, their profit wouldn’t be as assured.\n\nWinnie The Pooh Is Coming For You\n\nChina has become an incredibly self-censored country, with almost anything that might offend the Chinese censors getting banned completely. Even a single scene in a single episode of a long running television show has the potential to get the entire series banned if not quickly changed. China has censored internet mainstay sites such as Wikipedia, DeviantArt, Youtube and Amazon, as well as keywords such as ‘oppression’, ‘persecution’ and ‘dictatorship’. It’s almost as if they’re scared of knowledge.\n\nOne of the funniest examples of Chinese censorship is ‘Winnie the Pooh’. It’s also, however, one of the best examples for how strict and fragile the Chinese censors are.\n\nSee, as South Park pointed out, a while back, China’s president, President Xi, was mocked by the internet for resembling Winnie the Pooh. The president’s response was to have ‘Winnie the Pooh’ banned outright. This, surprise - surprise, didn’t work, and the Chinese president is continued to be mocked today.\n\nThis is obviously the ridiculous extreme of not being able to speak your mind, and whether you like it or not, people won't stand for it. People don’t like having every facet of their lives controlled, and once you start dictating what people can and cannot say, or can and cannot watch, it’s not long before you face push back.\n\nThe people in China might have a lot of restrictions put on them. It’s why they value what little, censored cinema they get. Only 35 international films make it into China every year, which is why the audience is so abundant. I feel bad for its citizens, really. It’s why I smile a little whenever we see one of these latest jabs in their direction.\n\nFree Speech Isn’t Just A Law - It’s An Ideal\n\nThere’s a well quoted expression from a french philosopher named Voltaire that goes; ‘I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.’ Voltaire, as well as the woman who actually wrote the quote, were in fact, very smart people.\n\nLet me give you an example for a second. Imagine you’re saying something that I don’t like. Some idea that is offensive to some opinions that I hold. Now let’s say that, instead of allowing you to speak, I instead just screamed as loud as I could, drowning out your voice and opinion.\n\nI’d come off as very immature, insecure, and not very well spoken in my ideas. It would also be clear that I would never be open to admitting I was wrong, which would make me intellectually dishonest. How do you know I’m the one that’s in the wrong if you never hear my arguement? I, and everyone else who shared my opinion and also wouldn’t be open, would find themselves in an echo chamber.\n\nThe Killing Joke\n\nBack to ‘The Joker’. Most people are aware of this, but the film caused quite a controversy when it came out.\n\nA lot of people had opinions on what its weight as a film should be. Whether or not it was doing more harm to society than good. As a result, the internet exploded into one of its classic, ‘us vs them’ intellectually-driven twitter battles. Blogging and magazines sites got onto the mixed when people began to have problems with the film and highlighted their feelings. All of this condensed The Joker down to a single issue.\n\nThat the ‘Incel’-driven, violent nature of this Joker was an affront to all those who had suffered violence at the hands of such dangerous loners. People hark back to the Aurora shooting when ‘The Dark Knight’ was out and a gunman, dressed as the Joker who later pleaded insanity, open fired on the audience. The fact that this new, grounded, realistic, and, what some people are calling, glorifying, new re-telling of the Joker exists was hurtful and offensive. It was deemed un-PC.\n\nThe discourse surrounding the film got worse and worse however, and, what I would call, very unwarranted and outlandish takes on the film were made, including this one from the New York Times:\n\nI recommend you read the article yourself so that I do not appear to be mischaracterizing it, but in essence the article claims that the fact that Arthur is white is central to the films because a black man would never have become such a symbol of revolution for the downtrodden. Placing such a heavy ‘white privilege’ stigma on the film, when race is not even a factor in the film’s narrative, I felt was an unwarranted take.\n\nThe discourse continued, until you eventually came to see articles like this one from NoFilmSchool:\n\nNow, it’s worth mentioning that this article does say ‘Opinion’ on it, and it is technically an opinion piece. The issue is that this opinion, from a reputable source designed to help young filmmakers, outright tells its vast audience to not go see this reasonably low budget (by hollywood's standard), passion project film, based on the wild fears that are being spread on the internet. Keep in mind, when all of these articles were published, the film hadn’t yet been released.\n\nThe article essentially comes down to this point: You shouldn’t give the film money, because it would be giving the filmmakers money, giving a financial incentive to ignore people's feelings. They also make the point because this film is about The Joker and references Batman, children will want to see it.\n\nI recognize that he makes some good arguments here. He’s right in that Children might see the film, and that parents and cinemas should be more aware of its R-Rating. He also made references to some of the comments made by the director, Todd Phillips, about cancel culture and how much he despised it.\n\nThese are all worthy points for discussion. In the middle of his points against Todd Phillips’ statement on cancel culture, he says: ‘It's ok to have this discussion right? It would be nice to have the filmmaker join the discussion more actively’. The only issue is that it feels like less of a discussion when you tell people what to do and mislead people in the article.\n\nIt’s also worthy of quick mention that this tweet didn’t always claim the tag ‘Opinion’. I remember because I read it when it first came out, and you can see here from their old social media advertisement of the post that they don’t claim ‘Opinion’ either. So all that sticks in our mind is them telling us to not watch the film.\n\nThe Joker Effect\n\nThe sad fact about ‘The Joker’ is that it’s an incredibly left wing film that touches on the widening gap between the rich and the poor, as well as the importance of funding social programmes. It’s just such a shame that all of these messages are being lost behind all of these needless and far-reaching takes on the text. It’s even more impressive because this is an incredibly new story for the Joker that manages to perfectly encapsulate him. Original stories are rare for films about comic book characters because films may as well just use the famous story lines.\n\nNow that The Joker is turning out to be one of the biggest R-Rated films of all time, I think we can officially say that, the world as a whole, does not like being told what they should or should not be watching.\n\nThe Joker was good, but I truly feel it wouldn’t be nearly as successful if it was essentially self marketed by creating a stigma around it. If you tell someone not to do something, they are almost definitely going to do the opposite. And if you are going to critique and make social commentary on a film people are looking forward to, maybe make sure the film has come out first."
