All told, “Joker” sold more than 1.4 million copies across all post-cinema avenues, topping the list and beating massive titles like “Frozen 2” and “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.”\n\nAgain, opinion on Todd Phillips’ “Joker” ranges from people calling it the greatest comic book film of all time to those thinking it’s the scourge of the medium. Regardless, it’s impressive to think that an R-rated, very adult comic book movie can topple some of the biggest releases from Disney. And when you take into consideration the fact that last year saw more people staying home than ever before, it’s not like there weren’t options and the time for folks to choose other titles.\n\nREAD MORE: WB Exec Reportedly Cut Budget For ‘Joker’ To Discourage Todd Phillips From Making The Film\n\nOf course, it has to be said that these numbers don’t mean that “Joker” is somehow the biggest film of 2020 or the most-watched home release of the year. Sales figures don’t take into consideration films that were released via Netflix or other streamers. And if we are to believe the numbers released by Netflix, then we can assume that at least one of those films topped 1.4 million views.\n\nAlas, these are the numbers we have to go by, and more than a year after its release, “Joker” is still making waves for Warner Bros.\n\nHere are the top 5 films in the list, including “Joker”:\n\nOfficial Video Chart 2020\n\n(All Digital Retail; Blu-ray and DVD, EST and VOD)"
