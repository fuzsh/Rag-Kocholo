Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\n\"Aquaman\" (2018) — $1.148 billion\n\n\"The Dark Knight Rises\" (2012) — $1.081 billion\n\n\"The Dark Knight\" (2008) — $1.005 billion\n\n\"Joker,\" like \"The Dark Knight,\" will do so without a China release during its initial theatrical run. It's assumed that the movie was too violent to warrant a rollout in China, where Hollywood has relied on an international box-office boost for potential blockbusters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Joker\" cost just $55 million to produce, meaning it's far more profitable than the average superhero movie that costs hundreds of millions of dollars to make.\n\nWhile Phillips has said that the movie was not made with a sequel in mind and one isn't in the works, the director recently hinted at what he would want in one.\n\n\"It couldn't just be this wild and crazy movie about the 'Clown Prince of Crime,'\" Phillips told The Los Angeles Times this week. \"It would have to have some thematic resonance in a similar way that ['Joker'] does. Because I think that's ultimately why the movie connected, it's what's going on underneath. So many movies are about the spark, and this is about the powder. If you could capture that again in a real way, that would be interesting.\"\n\nRead next\n\nWatch: The ending of 'Joker' explained\n\nWarner Bros. Box Office\n\nAdvertisement"
