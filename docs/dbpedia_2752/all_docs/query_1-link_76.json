        "text": "Joker sequel has received an R rating from the Motion Picture Association (MPA), an American film rating system that judges a movie’s suitability for audience per the content. Todd Phillips, also the creator of Hangover films, produced the Joker and co-wrote the screenplay with Scot Silver.\n\nThe follow-up movie of 2019’s Joker, Joker: Folie à Deux, has released its first poster, with Warner Bros. announcing the date of the official trailer debut, April 9. Surprisingly, this sequel has received an R rating from the Motion Picture Association (MPA), a film rating system that decides a movie’s suitable audiences based on the content. Similarly, an R rating depicts the film contains harsh adult material and sexuality, requiring viewers under 17 to accompany parents or adult guardians.\n\nThe previous Joker movie, released in 2019, is slapped with an R rating due to its violent content. But Folie a Deux, the upcoming movie, contains more “violence, language throughout, some sexuality and brief full nudity,” according to the report.\n\nStarring Lady Gaga as Harleen Quinzel (also known as Harley Quinn) and Joaquin Phoenix playing the role of Arthur Fleck or Joker, the movie’s premise depicts a complex relationship between them while showcasing mental illness. The picture portrays extensive drama within Gotham’s Arkham Asylum, a fictional psychiatric hospital for criminally insane people.\n\nJoker Becomes High-Grossing R-Rated Movie Of All Time\n\nDespite requiring a guardian for those under 17, Joker 2019 did a business of over $1 billion. Notably, it was the first R-rated movie to gross over $1 billion and secured 11 awards in 2020, with Phoenix earning the best actor Oscar award. Dead Pool and Dead Pool 2 are the two other comic movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) slapped with the same rating.\n\nThe famous American singer and actor, professionally known as Lady Gaga, contributes as a core character in the upcoming Joker film.
