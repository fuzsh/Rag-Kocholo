        "text": "It looks as though Joaquin Phoenix will be heading back to Gotham as Todd Phillips has shown off the script for Joker 2.\n\nTodd Phillips took to Instagram to share a photo of the cover of his script for “Joker: Folie a Deux” which translates to “madness for two.” The second photo shows Joaquin Phoenix reading the script.\n\nThis is the biggest update we’ve had on the proposed sequel in some time. With the recent news that David Zaslav is looking to have Phillips more involved with DC films, it isn’t a huge surprise that we’re finally seeing some movement on the film. Add in the fact the first film grossed over $1 billion globally off of a $50 million dollar budget, and it’s easy to see why Warner Bros. Discovery would be eager to produce this film.\n\nIt’s a long road from this stage to release, so stay tuned for further updates.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE"
