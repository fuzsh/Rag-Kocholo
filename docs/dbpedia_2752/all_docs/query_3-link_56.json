        "text": "Now that we’ve had a few days to recover from the annual delightfully confounding awards show that is the Golden Globes, let’s take a gander across the pond to see what the latest fuss is, as the British Academy of Film and Television Arts has announced the list of nominees for its 2020 ceremony. The two big takeaways? The British apparently love Joker, which leads with 11 nominations, and diversity and representational issues are a problem on both shores of the Atlantic, because this year, all the BAFTA acting nominees are white.\n\nThe BAFTA nominations, which were announced this morning, honored Todd Phillips’s twisted take on the classic Batman villain, as Joker is up for Best Film, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Leading Actor (Joaquin Phoenix), and more. Martin Scorsese’s Netflix mob epic The Irishman and Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood tied for a close second, snagging 10 nominations each. Sam Mendes’s faux-one-take World War I movie 1917, which won the top prize at the Golden Globes, earned nine nominations.\n\nParasite received four nominations, including Best Film, Film Not in the English Language, and Bong Joon Ho earned a nod for directing.\n\nThe acting nominations, however, are a total whiteout this year; not a single person of color earned a nomination in either the leading or supporting actor or actress categories. Margot Robbie was nominated twice in Supporting Actress though, first for Bombshell and then again for Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood. And, as with the Golden Globes, the Director nominations were all-male.\n\nTo the BAFTA’s... well, not quite credit, but at least severely limited self-awareness, executives recognized that the lack of diversity is a bad look.\n\n“Clearly everybody knows that everybody in the four acting groups of nominees are white, it's infuriating,” Marc Samuelson, chairman of BAFTA's film committee, told the U.K. news agency PA. “We can't make the industry do something, all we can do is encourage and push and inspire and try to help people coming in at the bottom end.”\n\nAmanda Berry, BAFTA’s chief executive, pointed to the “six female directors in the shorts category” as something that gave her hope for the future, and while that’s nice, it doesn’t change the fact that Todd Philips has a great chance of winning the top directing award when the BAFTAs are held on February 2.\n\nSee the full list of nominees below.\n\nBest Film\n\n1917\n\nThe Irishman\n\nJoker\n\nOnce Upon a Time... in Hollywood\n\nParasite\n\nLeading Actress\n\nJessie Buckley, Wild Rose\n\nScarlett Johansson, Marriage Story\n\nSaoirse Ronan, Little Women\n\nCharlize Theron, Bombshell\n\nRenée Zellweger, Judy\n\nLeading Actor\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nAdam Driver, Marriage Story\n\nTaron Egerton, Rocketman\n\nJoaquin Phoenix, Joker\n\nJonathan Pryce, The Two Popes\n\nSupporting Actress\n\nLaura Dern, Marriage Story\n\nScarlett Johansson, Jojo Rabbit\n\nFlorence Pugh, Little Women\n\nMargot Robbie, Bombshell\n\nMargot Robbie, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\n\nSupporting Actor\n\nTom Hanks, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\n\nAnthony Hopkins, The Two Popes\n\nAl Pacino, The Irishman\n\nJoe Pesci, The Irishman\n\nBrad Pitt, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\n\nOutstanding British Film|\n\n1917\n\nBait\n\nFor Sama\n\nRocketman\n\nSorry We Missed You\n\nThe Two Popes\n\nOutstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director, or Producer\n\nBait, Mark Jenkin (Writer-director), Kate Byers, Linn Waite (Producers)\n\nFor Sama, Waad Al-Kateab (Director-producer), Edward Watts (Director)\n\nMaiden, Alex Holmes (Director)\n\nOnly You, Harry Wootliff (Writer-director)\n\nRetablo, Álvaro Delgado-Aparicio (Writer-director)\n\nFilm Not in the English Language\n\nThe Farewell\n\nFor Sama\n\nPain and Glory\n\nParasite\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire\n\nDocumentary\n\nAmerican Factory\n\nApollo 11\n\nDiego Maradona\n\nFor Sama\n\nThe Great Hack\n\nAnimated Film\n\nFrozen 2\n\nKlaus\n\nA Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon\n\nToy Story 4\n\nDirector\n\nSam Mendes, 1917\n\nMartin Scorsese, The Irishman\n\nTodd Phillips, Joker\n\nQuentin Tarantino, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\n\nBong Joon Ho, Parasite\n\nOriginal Screenplay\n\nSusanna Fogel, Emily Halpern, Sarah Haskins, Katie Silberman, Booksmart\n\nRian Johnson, Knives Out\n\nNoah Baumbach, Marriage Story\n\nQuentin Tarantino, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\n\nHan Jin Won, Bong Joon Ho, Parasite\n\nAdapted Screenplay\n\nSteven Zaillian, The Irishman\n\nTaika Waititi, Jojo Rabbit\n\nTodd Phillips, Scott Silver, Joker\n\nGreta Gerwig, Little Women\n\nAnthony Mccarten, The Two Popes\n\nOriginal Score\n\nThomas Newman, 1917\n\nMichael Giacchino, Jojo Rabbit\n\nHildur Guđnadóttir, Joker\n\nAlexandre Desplat, Little Women\n\nJohn Williams, Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker\n\nCasting\n\nShayna Markowitz, Joker\n\nDouglas Aibel, Francine Maisler, Marriage Story\n\nVictoria Thomas, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\n\nSarah Crowe, The Personal History of David Copperfield\n\nNina Gold, The Two Popes\n\nCinematography\n\nRoger Deakins, 1917\n\nRodrigo Prieto, The Irishman\n\nLawrence Sher, Joker\n\nPhedon Papamichael, Le Mans ’66\n\nJarin Blaschke, The Lighthouse\n\nEditing\n\nThelma Schoonmaker, The Irishman\n\nTom Eagles, Jojo Rabbit\n\nJeff Groth, Joker\n\nAndrew Buckland, Michael Mccusker, Le Mans ’66\n\nFred Raskin, Once Upon A Time...
