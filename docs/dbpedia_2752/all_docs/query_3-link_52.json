        "text": "Todd Phillips is probably dancing on some rain-soaked steps somewhere—because Joker’s box office streak is now set to break more records. Specifically, the film is set to become the highest global-grossing R-rated U.S. release of all time after a $107 million weekend worldwide.\n\nAs of Sunday, Joker’s global take had reached $737.5 million, Deadline reports. Deadpool’s $783 million take holds the record right now—and at the rate Joker is going, Deadline reports that Joaquin Phoenix could take Ryan Reynolds’s crown soon enough. But for every box office win, there must be a loss—and with that in mind, now might be a good time for someone to check in on Ang Lee, whose Gemini Man has continued to flounder while Joker hogs all the attention.\n\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter, Lee’s dueling Will Smith pic is now facing a $75 million or more loss, with a mere $118.7 million worldwide as of Sunday. THR reports that the film cost roughly $140 million to produce, plus at least another $100 million for marketing. In fairness, this disappointing performance cannot be blamed solely on Joker; critics also roundly panned Gemini Man, resulting in what THR claims is Lee’s lowest-ever Rotten Tomatoes score.\n\nAnother person who allegedly might be less than thrilled by Joker’s success is Jared Leto, who the Hollywood Reporter claims complained to his agents—who happen to also represent Phillips—and even allegedly tried to get Warner Bros. to kill Joker entirely. A source close to Leto denied the claim when contacted by THR, and Leto’s rep told the outlet that Leto is still happily working with the studio, including shooting the studio’s upcoming film The Little Things. Still, as Phoenix’s Joker continues his high kicks and astronomical box office haul, it might be worth sending a few thoughts and prayers Leto’s way.\n\nMore Great Stories from Vanity Fair\n\n— Our cover story: Joaquin Phoenix on River, Rooney, and Joker\n\n— Plus: why a neurocriminologist left Joker completely stunned\n\n— Charlize Theron’s transformation in the Fox News movie wows at the film’s debut\n\n— Ronan Farrow’s producer reveals how NBC killed its Weinstein story\n\n— Read an exclusive excerpt from the sequel to Call Me by Your Name\n\n— From the Archive: How a near-death Judy Garland’s 1961 Carnegie Hall performance became showbiz legend\n\nLooking for more?
