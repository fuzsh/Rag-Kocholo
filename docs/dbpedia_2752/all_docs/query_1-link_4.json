        "text": "Despite mixed reviews and security concerns, Joker made a record-breaking $93.5 million in its opening weekend in the U.S., handily beating projections as well as Venom’s previous record of $80.25 million. Its global gross was $234 million, with big openings in South Korea, Japan, Brazil, and more.\n\nThe film, directed by Todd Phillips on a reported $55 million budget, was predicted to gross lower than other superhero movies mainly because of its R-rating and dark tone, modeled after gritty ’70s and ’80s-era films like Taxi Driver. Joker has also been beset by concerns that it might incite violence with its depiction of a loner driven to criminal ends. The film, starring Joaquin Phoenix in the lead, reimagines the villain’s origin story, painting him as a mentally unstable man who becomes an unhinged gunman after being abused by society. There have also been rumors that the 2012 Aurora shooter James Holmes was inspired by the Joker, a rumor that has since been debunked but still caused concern going into this past opening weekend.\n\nIn the lead-up to the release, studio Warner Bros. preempted more drama by disinviting press to the blockbuster’s Los Angeles premiere. “A lot has been said about Joker,“ a studio spokesperson told Variety, “and we just feel it’s time for people to see the film.”\n\nIn a cover story with Vanity Fair, Phoenix said that just because the film is dark and potentially controversial doesn’t mean it’s not worth making. “I was going through [the script] and I realized, I said, ‘Well, why would we make something, like, where you sympathize or empathize with this villain?’ It’s like, because that’s what we have to do,” he said. “It’s so easy for us to—we want the simple answers, we want to vilify people. It allows us to feel good if we can identify that as evil. ‘Well, I’m not racist ’cause I don’t have a Confederate flag or go with this protest.’ It allows us to feel that way, but that’s not healthy because we’re not really examining our inherent racism that most white people have, certainly. Or whatever it may be. Whatever issues you may have. It’s too easy for us and I felt like, yeah, we should explore this villain. This malevolent person.”\n\nMore Great Stories from Vanity Fair\n\n— Apple learns from one of Netflix’s biggest mistakes\n\n— What the real-life inspiration for Hustlers thinks of J.
