        "text": "UPDATED, 11:59 AM: With $788.1M worldwide, Warner Bros./Village Roadshow/Bron Studio’s Joker has just passed Fox’s Deadpool to become the highest grossing R-rated movie of all-time. That Marvel pic ended its run with $783M. By the end of the weekend, it’s expected that Joker‘s global tally will stand at $825M. At least a $900 final tally is expected with a profit after ancillaries at $464M.\n\nPrevious Sunday: Todd Phillips’ DC movie Joker is poised to become the highest grossing R-rated U.S. release of all-time heading toward a potential $900M in global ticket sales.\n\nIn its third weekend, the Warner Bros./Village Roadshow/Bron Studios‘ release made $107M worldwide sending its overall total to $737.5M. The pic, which has won Joaquin Phoenix high praise for his turn as a twisted, social outcast and a top spot on awards prognosticators’ annual best actor list, just needs to beat Deadpool‘s $783M tally before it owns the global-grossing record for a R-rated U.S. release. Deadpool 2‘s $785M global gross includes $47M from its PG-13 holiday cut. Joker has already surpassed New Line’s It worldwide B.O. of $700.3M, and will soon outstrip Warner/VR’s The Matrix Reloaded‘s $742.1M WW. The only place left for Joker to trick and treat is in China."
