Contestants answered questions based on categories that were determined randomly by a mechanism resembling a slot machine. The show's title refers to the game's slot machine-mechanism also having jokers.\n\nThe show was billed as \"the game where knowledge is king and lady luck is queen\", and was notable for being the first successful game show produced by Jack Barry after his company's role in the quiz show scandals during the late 1950s. The success of the series led in part to the reformation of Barry & Enright Productions in the 1970s, which reunited Barry with his partner Dan Enright. The series was always referred to as a Jack Barry Production in the closing credits, however.\n\nBarry's sons, Jonathan and Douglas Barry, were co-executive producers for the 1990s version, which was produced in association with Richard S. Kline and billed as a Kline and Friends production in association with Jack Barry Productions.",
