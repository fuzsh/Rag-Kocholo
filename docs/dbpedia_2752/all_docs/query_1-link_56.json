        "text": "Hello! Welcome to The Box Office Report for the weekend of April 14-16, 2023.\n\n1. The Super Mario Bros. Movie\n\nWeekend gross: $87M\n\nTotal domestic gross: $347.8M\n\nLast weekend: 1st\n\nPercent drop: -41\n\nAnother dominant weekend for The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The film fell just 41 percent from its opening weekend, holding on for a fantastic $87 million.\n\nA second weekend that big cracks the top ten list for best second weekends, joining a club that consists mostly of giant franchise films (a Star Wars movie, four Marvel Cinematic Universe installments, a Jurassic World movie and then the live-action Beauty and the Beast remake and Top Gun: Maverick).\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is now the top grossing film for 2023 at the domestic box office, jumping ahead what Avatar: The Way of Water had grossed during this calendar year. By a lot. The Super Mario Bros. Movie now stands at $347.8 million to The Way of Water’s $257.5 million.\n\n2. The Pope’s Exorcist\n\nWeekend gross: $9.2M\n\nTotal domestic gross: $9.2M\n\nLast weekend: New release\n\nPercent drop: NA\n\nBig drop between the weekend’s No. 1 and No. 2 films. While I was looking at Russell Crowe’s career box office numbers, my memory was jogged that Noah and Robin Hood were real movies that he starred in and that opened at $43.7 million and $36 million. You all remember Oscar Isaac yelling “I declare you to be an outLAAAAWWWWW”?\n\n3. John Wick: Chapter 4\n\nWeekend gross: $7.9M\n\nTotal domestic gross: $160.1M\n\nLast weekend: 2nd\n\nPercent drop: -45\n\nJohn Wick: Chapter 4 creeps closer to becoming the top grossing John Wick film domestically. (The movie already claimed that title for the worldwide box office.) The fourth John Wick film should be able to pull together the renaming $11 million it needs to surpass John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum’s $171 million.\n\n4. Renfield\n\nWeekend gross: $7.8M\n\nTotal domestic gross: $7.8M\n\nLast weekend: New release\n\nPercent drop: NA\n\nHuh. Based on how much I’ve seen Renfield talked about on social media, I thought it would’ve opened higher than $7.8 million.\n\n5. Air\n\nWeekend gross: $7.7M\n\nTotal domestic gross: $33.3M\n\nLast weekend: 3rd\n\nPercent drop: -47\n\nAir should’ve been the title of the prestige reboot of the Air Bud franchise.\n\nBox office numbers via The Numbers based on Sunday estimates.\n\nNext weekend\n\nBeau Is Afraid and Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant both hit theaters next weekend, but will either of them have the juice to dethrone The Super Mario Bros. Movie? Pretty sure the answer to that one is “nope.” Even if The Super Mario Bros. Movie fell by sixty percent its third weekend, a new film would have to clear $30 million to beat it."
