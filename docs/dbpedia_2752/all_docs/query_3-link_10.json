        "text": "Hello, everyone! dad90 here doing my first Test Run of...\n\n3 contestants (1 a returning champion) compete.\n\nRULES:\n\nRound 1:\n\nThe slot machine has 6 windows (2 rows of 3 windows).\n\nThe top windows have 5 categories, the bottom windows have dollar amounts from $5-$100 (in $5 increments), but all the windows have Jokers.\n\nWhen a player spins single categories, questions are worth the value of 1 money window, spinning a pair (2 categories the same and a single category or 2 categories\n\nand a joker) or a triple (3 categories the same, 2 categories the same and a joker, or a category and 2 jokers) will have questions worth the total value of the 2-3\n\nmoney windows (NOTE: If s/he spun 2 categories the same and a single category, s/he can choose either the single category or the 2 categories the same).\n\nAlso when Jokers appear the top window, players can go off the board and choose a category that isn't on the board.\n\nA Joker is worth 2x the value of 1 money window, 2 Jokers are 4x worth the total value of the 2 money windows, and if a player spun 3 Jokers, single categories are\n\nrevealed and is worth 5x the total value of the 3 money windows.\n\nThe round begins with the champion spinning the machine to demand the value and category for the toss up question, and the first player to buzz in with the correct\n\nanswer is receives the cash value and control of the machine, however if a player answers a question incorrectly the other players can buzz in and steal control by\n\nanswering the question correctly.\n\nIf a Joker come up on 1 of the 3 money windows, questions are worth either $200 (a single category), $400 (a joker), or 3x one or two money windows (2-3 categories).\n\nIf 2 Jokers comes up on 2 of the 3 money windows, questions are worth either $250 (a single category), $500 (2 categories), $1,000 (2 jokers), or 6x the value of the\n\nremaining money window (3 categories).\n\nIf All 3 Jokers comes up on all money windows questions are worth either $300 (a single category), $600 (2 categories), $1,250 (3 categories), or $2,000 (3 jokers).\n\nThe round ends when 1 player reaches $1,500 or more. That eliminates the low score player, and his/her money will go into the \"Natural Triple Cash Jackpot\" (info below).\n\nRound 2:\n\nSame as Round 1 with the 2 remaining players competing with 5 new categories and a Special Category, the cash values now ranging from $100-$500 (now in $50 increments),\n\nthe \"Opponent's Choice\" card in 3rd money window along with the \"Fast Forward\" Cards in the first two.\n\nThe player with the LEAST amount of money from the previous starts this round. This time, after the getting the category and its value, the host will ask that player\n\na question for that amount without trying to buzz in. If they're correct, they earn the money. If they're wrong, their opponent has a chance to steal.\n\nAfter that, control automatically passes to the next player.\n\nThis time, 1 Joker on 1 of the 3 Money Windows automatically double the amounts of the two remaining money windows, and 2 Jokers triple the 1 remaining money window.\n\nAnd if all 3 Jokers comes up on all money windows, questions are now worth either $300 (a single category), $800 (2 categories), $1,500 (3 categories), or $2,500 (3 jokers).\n\nHowever, if all 3 Jokers comes up on the category windows AND the Money Windows, the contestant has the opportunity to win the game RIGHT THERE AND THEN with one single\n\nquestion from ANY category of his/her choice, but it's a three-part question. If answered correctly with all 3 parts needed, the player automatically\n\nbecomes champion, and has that total augmented to $5,000. If answered incorrectly by missing at least one part, the game continues.\n\nIf 1-2 \"Fast Forward\" Cards comes up on either/both money windows, the contestant in control can answer as many questions as s/he wants for $250 (a single category/if there is one), $500 (a joker/if there is one or 2 categories/if there are two), $750 (2 jokers/if there are two or 3 categories/if the \"Opponent's Choice\" card is present) or 10x one or both money windows (2-3 categories/if the \"Opponent's Choice\" card is not present), but if s/he answers a question incorrectly, s/he lost all the money for that turn and his/her opponent get a chance at that question, however s/he can quit that turn when likes and take the money (NOTE: The value of a single category above the \"Opponent's Choice\" card is either $350 or 5x the other money windows).\n\nWhen a player reaches $5,000 or more, his/her opponent gets 1 final spin of the machine to see if s/he can either beat or tie that score. If s/he did and answers a question correctly then the game continues until a player misses or spinning a value that wasn't enough having his/her opponent win the game, keep his/her money, and goes to the bonus game.\n\nLike Round 1, the losing player's money will go into the \"Natural Triple Cash Jackpot\" (info below).\n\nSPECIAL CATEGORIES:\n\n$10,000 Question: A question from a mystery category is asked. If the first player gets it right, he gets the money. If the player gets it wrong, his opponent has the chance to answer for the money. A correct answer by either player puts $10,000 into the \"Natural Triple Cash Jackpot\".\n\nAuction: The contestants are provided with a subject that has a number of answers. The chooser bids on how many things on the list he can get right. The more answers the chooser bids, the more money they could win. His opponent either challenges him or does the same. Whoever is challenged has to name the amount that they bid. If the challenged does so, he gets the cash. If he doesn't his opponent gets the cash. A good way to catch-up or win the game.\n\nCash Category: Ten numbered envelopes contain money amounts in increasing amounts: $1,000 to $5,000 in $500 increments and $10,000. The player attempts to answer a question in a mystery category. If he gets it right, the amount of money in the envelope is won and added to the bank. If the question is not answered correctly, the envelope goes back into the pool.\n\nOnce a correct answer is made, it'll be out of play.\n\nChallenge Category: A question in a mystery category is asked. The player who chose the category could choose to answer it or pass it to his opponent. A correct answer by either player earns the money.\n\nDouble or Nothing: This is a great category as the player who chooses this has an opportunity to either double the amount played for or double his score. If he answers a question in a mystery category correctly, the amount played for is doubled, and then has the option to stop or answer the second question. If both questions are answered correctly, the player doubles his bank total. If either box's question is answered incorrectly, the opponent has a chance to steal the regular amount.\n\nIt's A Dilemma: The chooser hears the question and can get up to five clues for the answer. However, the opponent chooses who answers the question. Whoever answers it correctly gets the money.\n\nJoker's Jackpot: A three-part question in a mystery category is asked. If the player answers them all correctly, the player gains the box and $10,000 is added to the Joker's Jackpot. If either or both parts are answered incorrectly, the opponent gets a chance to answer for the box. If either or both parts remain unanswered, the box is not claimed and nothing is put in the Super Joker's Jackpot.\n\nJump-In Category: A buzzcode from 1-100 is sent in to determine who buzzes in first. If the player who buzzed in first answers the mystery question, he gets the cash. If he gets it wrong, his opponent can guess the answer for the cash.\n\nName That...: The category is announced (Name That Athlete, for example), and each player bids on how many clues they need to guess the identity of the mystery subject. The lower the bid, the more money that player can win. If the player who gets the clues answers it right, he gets the cash.\n\nNatural Triple Jackpot's Quiz: The chooser hears a question from a mystery category. If he gets it right, he gets the money and the privilege of having the Natural Triple Jackpots in the bonus round. If the chooser misses the question, his opponent can answer it for the Jackpots and the money.\n\nNumber Please: A question with a numerical answer is given to the player who picked it. If the player guesses the exact number, the player wins 3x the amount played for. If the guess is incorrect, the opponent can claim the regular amount by telling whether the answer is higher or lower than the first player's guess.\n\nPlay or Pass: The player has the option of passing a first question in a mystery subject, but he must answer the second question for the cash at 1/2 the amount.\n\nSecret Category: The host has 10 questions in front of him. The contestant picks one, and a three-part question in a mystery category is asked. If a player answers all three parts correctly, the Joker's Jackpot is doubled until it reaches $1,000,000 or more, at which event this category will become \"Joker's Jackpot\". If a player doesn't answer any part of the question, his opponent has the opportunity to answer them correctly to double the Jackpot. If any parts are left unanswered, the box is unclaimed and the Joker's Jackpot is not doubled.\n\nSeesaw: A question with multiple answers is presented. Players alternate giving correct answers, adding more money into it along the way, with the last player who answers correctly claiming the cash.\n\nTake Two: A question is read with two clues. The player has the option of answering after the first clue, but if he hears the second clue, the opponent has the chance to answer first.\n\nThis Or That: A name is presented with two options as to what the identity of the name is. The chooser has the option of passing it to his opponent. If either player answers correctly, he gets the cash.\n\nThree To Win: A series of jump-in questions are asked, with buzzcodes sent in. The player that answers three of them first claims the cash at 10x for the first 3, 3x at 4, and 1x at 5.\n\nTop Ten: The subject of a top ten list is given. The choosing player attempts to name the highest-ranking part of the list. If he doesn't, his opponent can get the cash by naming a higher item on the list.\n\nTrivia Dare: The choosing player hear a question with three multiple choice answers and decides who answers first. If either player gets it incorrect, his opponent can chooses from the two remaining answers.\n\nBonus Game:\n\nThis bonus game is in 2 parts.\n\nPart 1: The winning player is given 1 free spin, and can earn up to 4 more free spins by answering 4 True-False questions, and up on the top windows now, instead of categories, there are prizes (4 single prizes, A 3-prize package and A new car) all totalling between $10,000 to $25,000, bonus cash amounts ($20,000, $25,000, $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, $75,000, and $100,000), and jokers. After a spin, the player has the opinion of freezing any of prizes on the wheels, but s/he can't freeze a joker. When s/he froze a prize, if a joker was spun then that joker turned into that prize s/he spun.\n\nAfter the free spins s/he has to choose either to go to Part 2 (where whatever that came up will be on line) or take the bonus spin. If s/he took the bonus spin, whatever that were spun on that spin will be on the line.\n\nIf the player spun 3 of the same prize before s/he ran out of spins, s/he won that prize (and the Natural Triple Prize Jackpot if NTJ Quiz is answered right), leaving 7 more prizes on the line. If s/he spun 3 of the same bonus cash amount before s/he ran out of spins, that amount will be on the line in Part 2. If s/he spun 3 jokers in 1 spin, all prizes will be on the line.\n\nPart 2: With any prizes and/or bonus cash amounts in the top windows on the line, down on the money windows now are dollar values ($250, $300-$500 in $100 increments, $750, $1,000, $1,500, and $2,000, and in the middle reel only $2,500), jokers, and devils. The winning player spun the machine and continues as long as only money and jokers came up on the wheels. Each time the winning player spun a joker, $1,000 is added to the Joker's Bonus, and that money is kept, win or lose. If s/he accumulated $10,000 or more without spinning the devil, s/he got to keep the money and what was on the top windows. If s/he spun 3 Jokers in 1 spin, s/he won the \"Joker's Jackpot\", which starts at $25,000 and went up with each cash amount the contestant has lost to a devil, to a maximum of $250,000. If s/he spun a natural triple (3 dollar amounts the same), automatically bring the money to $10,000 and wins what's on the top windows (and the Natural Triple Cash Jackpot if NTJ Quiz is answered correctly). If s/he spun the Devil the game was over and s/he lost the money and the top windows, however s/he can stop the bonus game whenever s/he wants, take the money and choose 1 Prize from the top windows.\n\nNatural Triple Jackpots:\n\nOn my version, there are 2 \"Natural Triple Jackpots\", 1 is all prizes and the other is all cash.\n\nNatural Triple Prize Jackpot: Like the 1984-86 seasons of the 2nd version, spinning 3 categories the same in the top windows in the front game is worth the \"Natural Triple Prize Jackpot\" which goes up by another prize each show it isn't won.\n\nNatural Triple Cash Jackpot: When a player loses, his/her money is added to the \"Natural Triple Cash Jackpot\", which starts at $10,000 (a la \"Joker's Jackpot\" from the original 1972-75 CBS version). A player spinning 3 dollar amounts in the bottom windows in the front game wins the player the \"Natural Triple Cash Jackpot\" which is not added to his/her score.\n\nBoth \"Natural Triple Jackpots\" are played in the front game and the bonus game IF the Natural Triple Jackpot's Quiz is answered.\n\nChampions stay on the show until defeated or until s/he goes to the bonus game 5 times or until s/he wins the \"Joker's Jackpot\" or until s/he wins all the prizes spinning all 6 Jokers in the bonus game (3 in part 1 & 3 more in part 2), whichever comes first. A 5-time champion automatically wins a car.\n\nNow then, I need 3 players."
