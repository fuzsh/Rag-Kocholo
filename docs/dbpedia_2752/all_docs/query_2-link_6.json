        "text": "Almost two years ago I wrote a post which centred on reading Star Wars antagonist Kylo Ren as a Gothic Double. It wasn’t only a personally cathartic ode to a frustratingly and fascinatingly complicated character, but an application of my doctoral research which, for the past five years, has centred on reading problems relating to the guilty mind in criminal law through doubles narratives in Gothic fiction. The double is one of those literary figures that crops up all over the place, not only in literature but in movies, tv shows and even music videos. Doubles can be literal/physical, like Doppelgängers, exact likenesses of living persons whose arrival (in folklore, myth and literature) heralds the imminent demise of the person whose visage they so uncannily replicate, or they can be psychological/metaphorical, like the split self of Jekyll and Hyde, the sin-accumulating picture of Dorian Gray, or the creature as a warped mirror of Frankenstein. I personally find the double to be one of the most evocative literary figures because of the way in which it can externalise a character’s internal mind, not only acting as a revelatory device for their deepest secrets, but also often carrying out their most forbidden desires.\n\nNo double in recent memory has captured me quite like Joker’s Arthur Fleck. Directed by The Hangover’s Todd Phillips and starring the magnificently chameleonic Joaquin Phoenix, Joker takes a self-consciously Scorsesian approach in telling the origin of comic books’ most iconic villain, eschewing the flashy style of contemporary superhero flicks in favour of a deliberately psychological, enigmatic art film that harkens back to the gritty celluloid of a bygone era. It’s a movie I’m – ironically or fittingly – in two minds about: on the one hand, it’s visually striking, raises interesting and timely questions, and is elevated thanks to Phoenix’s mesmerizingly macabre performance; on the other, it regularly skates into pretentiousness, its nihilism can come off a tad trite, and it often muddles the very message it’s trying to convey.\n\nIt’s critical acclaim might be similarly divided, but its commercial success is staggering: it just beat Deadpool to become the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time, already ranks as the 9th highest-rated movie on IMDb, and is the first ever R-rated movie to join the $1 billion club – a near-unthinkable achievement for a film made for a reported $62.5 million and whose earnings won’t be bolstered by a China release. According to Forbes, Joker is the most profitable comic book ever made, reportedly having already raked in the same profits as Avengers: Infinity War with a far smaller budget. Augmenting its financial success is the praise lavished on it by movie bigwigs Michael Mann, Michael Moore, and Martin Scorsese himself. I don’t think Joker is a masterpiece by any means, but it is a masterstroke – in an industry ruled by Disney’s capitalistic ouroboros, Joker is a rallying cry for originality that I can’t help but applaud. It’s a film with guts, grime and grit – and, despite my misgivings, I have been able to think of little else in the two months since I saw it (anything non-PhD-related, that is…)\n\nThat’s as much of a review as I want to give right now – because the reason for this post existing (and by ‘existing’, I mean ‘being forcibly dredged out of my corrections-addled psyche through sheer will’) is its approach to the double. Duality is not just an element in the film – it is threaded into its very essence, informing its form and function at both narrative and metatextual levels. I’m not suggesting that Phillips, Phoenix and co. had Gothic literary conventions in mind when crafting the story – but I am about to interpret the hell out of them anyway, because I think they’ve presented an interesting interpretation of the alter ego interplay which has its roots in the Gothic whilst also speaking to the cultural zeitgeist of our times. The first half of this post examines the meta duality of Joker’s intertextual references and wider context, and reads the Gothic into Gotham City. The second half of the post focuses unspools the layers of doubles in the film to unravel how Joker is using the literary double and refashioning it for a new era.\n\n*HUGE SPOILERS FOR JOKER FROM THIS POINT ON*\n\nThe Taxi King of Driver Comedy – Emulation vs. Imitation\n\nMuch has been made of Joker’s similarities to gritty Scorsese character studies Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, so much so that you can see Phillips and Phoenix’s emotional tethers gradually wear down with every mention of them. But it’s true that these movies are not just touchstones for the story, narrative and atmosphere of Joker – they’re injected into the movie’s veins. Like Travis and Rupert, Arthur is searching for love, acceptance (and arguably adoration) but they’ll settle for seeking vengeance on the decaying urban metropolises who shaped their lives. Wisecrack mentions less discussed but equally important influences on the film – from One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and Network to Raging Bull and The Warriors (to which I would also add Memento and Fight Club), but the lynchpin of Scorsese’s two (arguably) most iconic loners is so vivid and seem so purposefully invoked that not only Arthur may be viewed as a double of both of these American outcasts prowling the mean streets they despise, but Joker the film can be read as a double of those Scorsese movies that so clearly shaped it.\n\nJoker’s intertextual footprint is a fascinating one, especially when appreciating the fact that Arthur’s filmic progenitors – Taxi Driver’s Travis Bickle and The King of Comedy’s Rupert Pupkin – were both memorably brought to life by Robert De Niro, who co-stars here as Johnny Carson-esque talk show host Murray Franklin. Travis Bickle, ‘the nobody who dreams of being a somebody’ is ‘desperate to prove that he’s alive’, according to the film’s tagline. Travis explains that ‘loneliness has followed [him his] whole life. Everywhere. In bars, in cars, sidewalks, stores, everywhere. There’s no escape.’ Arthur’s loneliness is so palpable it’s practically a character in and of itself; his crushing isolation is oppressively unflinching, summoning the ghost of ‘God’s lonely man’, the moniker Travis Bickle gives himself as a modern-day prophet wading through a sea of literal and metaphorical trash, praying for the day when a ‘real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets’. Both Travis and Arthur feel dislocated and disenfranchised, trudging through ‘a long continuous chain’ of ‘indistinguishable regularity’; both of them come to idealise the ‘angelic’ women in their lives (Betsy and Sophie respectively) who are in truth more complicated and nuanced than they realise. Joker never talks to his reflection in the mirror as Travis does, but he does interact with it psychologically – and Travis’ declaration that he is ‘a man who would not take it anymore’ not only aligns him with Arthur but the ‘mad as hell’ Howard Beale from Network.\n\nLikewise, Arthur’s stand-up dreams and talk-show fantasies harken back to De Niro’s other Scorsese loner Rupert Pupkin from The King of Comedy. It’s particularly meta that Robert De Niro, once inhabiting the Rupert Pupkin character, now assumes the Jerry Langford role, the distant patriarch to the screwed-up son. Arthur’s Murray Franklin appearance not only resonates thematically with King of Comedy’s narcissistic, delusional obsessive fan who commits an act of violence in order to memorably appear on tv (kidnap in TKOC, on-air murder in Joker). Like Pupkin, Arthur is deliriously convinced of his own comedic genius, and would appear to justify his actions as Pupkin does, with the latter proclaiming that it’s ‘better to be king for a night than schmuck for a lifetime!’. Linguistically, the comparison between The King of Comedy and the Clown Prince of Crime is an interesting one, with Joker as a metaphorical king of comedy who finds humour in harm – and Joker even sports a suit of a similar vermillion shade to Rupert’s talk show threads. There seem to be elements of Jerry Langford in both Murray Franklin (there’s even assonance in their names) and mayoral candidate/future Bat-dad Thomas Wayne, the fathers these violent loners never had. ‘Nobody knows Rupert Pupkin, but after 11:30 tonight no one will ever forget him’ – that’s the tagline for The King of Comedy, but swap Rupert Pupkin for Arthur Fleck and you’ve got a pretty succinct summation of Joker’s last twenty minutes. Rupert and Arthur both feel intimately tied to their talk show ‘dads’ – ‘I made plans based on what you said. You can’t just turn your back on me’ Rupert chides Jerry, suggesting Jerry owes something to him. ‘But breaks like this don’t just happen. You have to make your own breaks,’ Rupert surmises.\n\nHowever, there’s a fine line between emulation and imitation, and Joker has a tendency to dip into the latter. Phillips daubs the celluloid with auteur influences as heavily as Arthur paints his face, but at times it feels as if he’s moonlighting as Martin Scorsese rather than simply evoking his style. Joker is both the double of an archetypal comic book movie and its foil: it includes many of the trappings of its pulpy source (alter egos, zany costumes, vigilante antics) and multiple nods to its comic origins (Gotham, Arkham, the Waynes) whilst also flippantly rejecting the commodified, popcorn-sensibility of Marvel’s commercially-uniform fare. It’s this juxtaposition of the auteur and the mainstream that Jo Damico critiques, skewering Joker for donning an ‘ill-fitting suit of Scorsese [which] speaks to something in the pathology of comic book movies’; namely, that ‘when they want respectability, they often cosplay as a better film. The Dark Knight dresses up as Heat, Winter Soldier as a Pakula movie,’ Logan as Shane and X-Men: First Class as Bond films from the Connery era: ‘Complexity is the genre is just mimickry most of the time’, Damico concludes. It’s a thoughtful and incisive commentary on the intertextual integrity of cinema and a perceived lack of it in comic book movies which leads some filmmakers to reimagine them as ‘doubles’ of other, more artistically-perceived fare.\n\nThere’s an interesting, meta duality to the film itself – it both aims to make us sympathise with Arthur (which I think it succeeds in to an extent) but also wants us to delight in the sight of a fully made-up/costumed Joker going wild (we do). There’s a voyeuristic aspect to his moral decline that implicates the audience in his actions – because of the medium, we cannot intervene and offer a kind word to Arthur when it might have counted. We can only watch in growing horror as he transforms more indelibly into his violent alter ego.\n\nPutting the Goth(ic) in Gotham: Environment as Incubator – A Gothic Reading of Joker\n\nThe Gothic novel emerged from Romanticism in the eighteenth century as a form of literature that dealt explicitly with horror, death and the macabre. Ghosts, ghouls, vampires and other supernatural nasties filled its pages with terror and its readers with thrills. The crumbling castles and windswept moors of Gothic fiction might not immediately call to mind the mean streets of Gotham City – it’s right there in the name. Pat Finn excellently explores the Gothic features of Batman’s ‘urban dystopia’ on the silver screen, differentiating between Burton’s decaying metropolis, Nolan’s resplendent labyrinth and Snyder’s Gotham as the ‘bad twin’ to Superman’s more sanitised city. The urban cityscape is one of the antiquated spaces in which Jerrod Hogle identifies as a recurring site for Gothic stories and which often harbour the dark secrets of unresolved crimes (such as the attics of Dorian Gray and Mr Rochester, the Phantom of the Opera’s subterranean lair, and the laboratories of Drs Frankenstein and Jekyll). Gothic shifted somewhat from the crumbling country mansions, castles and cathedrals of the late eighteenth century to the seedy cities of Stevenson, Wilde and Stoker’s London – Gotham, with its crime-riddled alleyways, derelict buildings, and its seemingly-perpetual veil of rainy gloom, would appear to locate it in the urban Gothic of Jekyll and Hyde, Dorian Gray and Dracula. Joker’s Gotham is a similarly miasmic metropolis to those nineteenth century cities; the grimy streets of Arthur’s asphalt jungle abode are so vividly drawn you can almost smell the fumes oozing from the trash-piled sidewalks.\n\nEven less overtly Gothic locales can become the site for Gothic activities. Arthur’s run-down apartment building is Gothic in its decrepitude, and not only does Arthur’s unassuming apartment become the scene of his bloody dispatching of Randall, it is also the space in which his dark side is incubated over many years. Murray Franklin’s talk show set is no crumbling cathedral, but it is a monolithic temple for which Arthur once held a spiritual relevance; once an acolyte of Murray’s teachings, Arthur dreams of making a pilgrimage to his fabled talk show in his quest to follow in his messiah’s steps. The secret of Arthur’s parentage is revealed not by the (Gothic) space they inhabit but by the unanswered letters his mother routinely sends to her revered Thomas Wayne. Penny’s seemingly-innocuous missives, deeply oblivious to her former boss’ indifference, identify Thomas as Arthur’s biological father. The truth of his heritage remains skilfully ambiguous, with a suggestive message on the back of a glamorous younger Penny’s photo (initialled ‘T.W.’) hinting at the truth in Penny’s claim, which is in turn put into question by the sheer unreliability of Penny/Arthur’s narration/perception. Though the film’s portrayal has come under fire for perpetuating potentially-damaging stereotypes of mental illness (particularly in relation to violence), arguably because of the ambiguity with which they are handled, for this post I’m considering them solely as speaking to Arthur and Penny’s status as unreliable narrators.\n\nTo me, Arthur Fleck can therefore be read as a Gothic monster in the same vein as Frankenstein’s creature, whose plaintive repine I chose as the title of this post. This lament stole into my thoughts when I first saw Joker, and it’s been entwined with the film in my eyes ever since. I’ll be conducting a reading of Joker as Frankenstein’s creature later in this post, but Arthur is, in my view, a Gothic monster in the more general sense – not only the villain but also the victim, a figure of discord and depravity who embodies both good and evil and the grey nuances in between. With its penchant for the peculiar, Gothic fiction was the arena for dealing with the things that go bump in the night that polite Victorian society wouldn’t dare to raise in civil conversation. Literary doubles were thus often useful tools for externalizing the sordid secrets and forbidden desires society repressed – I believe Arthur Fleck’s colourful criminal persona can be read as such a double. Joker’s facepaint is as much a façade as the Phantom of the Opera’s mask, both of whom regard themselves as unappreciated geniuses in their respective fields. The Phantom’s justification for his violence – ‘The world showed no compassion to me!’ – rings true for Arthur, and both seek to gain control in their lives through fear and violence, a confidence which is expressed in theatrical ways (song for the Phantom, dance for the Joker). Joker is an amalgam of Gotham’s grime; the gunge on the city’s sole accumulated from years of grinding Arthur into the dirt – but he is also his own grim creation: not a revolutionary fighting for the disenfranchised but a clownish killer seeking vengeance specifically on individuals he believes have wronged him. Revenge, perhaps the most Gothic act of all.\n\nJoker as Gothic Monster\n\nHaving interpreted Gotham as a Gothic locale, or at the very least a site for Gothic action, I turn to one of the genre’s most intriguing figures: the double, a Gothic monster that invades our sense of self and renders it uncanny, unfamiliar, and horrific. The most visually striking type of double is arguably the Doppelgänger (double-walker/double-goer), which I mentioned in the opening of this post. Perhaps influenced by the folkloric suspicion that the sight of one’s own double heralded death, Doppelgänger narratives often culminate in the ‘evil’ double taking over the life of the protagonist (or attempting to do so), as seen in Dostoyevsky’s The Double, Jekyll and Hyde, and in modern takes on the mythos like Us and Single White Female. With this in mind, I found that Joker could be read as Arthur’s Doppelgänger: Joker appears, insidiously takes over more and more aspects of Arthur’s life and personality, and eventually kills the old self in order to permanently replace him. The film certainly revels in its portrays of Arthur as a fragmented being, often framing him along with his own reflection in mirrors and windows, and using his clown makeup as both his façade and (arguably) his true face. I’ll first be exploring the doubles motif more generally before narrowing in on the three Gothic doubles I feel Joker channels either directly or more implicitly: Jekyll and Hyde, Dorian Gray and Frankenstein.\n\nPut on A Happy Face: The Doubles Motif in Joker\n\nEvil twins and alter egos are comic books’ bread and butter, so it’s no surprise that Joker is riddled with doubles. Dance critic Gia Kourlas even notes the duality of Phoenix’s dancing which she describes as having ‘essentially placed two characters within one dancing body’. Duality underscores his first appearance, in which we see his reflection before we see the man himself: unable to produce a natural smile, Arthur wrenches his lips into a morbid facsimile, before an errant tear turns his makeup into a striking bisection of his face. His name alone signifies that he is not one, but two: his first name evokes the warrior King of British legend while his surname suggests smallness and insignificance. He is both a mythic monarch and a speck of dust – simultaneously monumental and minuscule.\n\nJoker the character is an interesting case, because his origins have always been a mystery – as one incarnation claimed in Alan Moore’s The Killing Joke (the closest we had to an origin story before Joker), ‘if I’m going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice’. Killing Joke’s Joker famously declared that we’re all one bad day away from being him – but in Arthur’s case, it’s a lifetime of bad days unceasingly piled one on top of the other and an endless, unrewarded climb. Joker remains commendably (and creatively) ambiguous as to the exact truths of Arthur’s tale, so everything it presents is ripe for speculation. Its slow-motion scenes are regarded by Joaquin Phoenix to be clear moments of fabrication/exaggeration, and even that is up for interpretation – so wading through potential half-truths and falsehoods to find a gem of fact is a veritable minefield. It’s possible the entire thing is a swindler’s fiction, woven to garner sympathy for the devil – or perhaps Arthur’s misfortunes thus portrayed comprise a true account of how a good person turns bad in a corrupt society.\n\nThough his motivations remain something of a mystery, Arthur’s character oscillates between adorably guileless and awkwardly strange. The human embodiment of a sinewy nerve ending, Arthur is a jagged piece whose rough edges prove to be an uncomfortably inexact match for the mould society has made for him. He exists through imitation, clumsily mimicking conventional social behaviour, and while his desperation to fit in is often uncomfortable to watch him so out of his depth, his misery is magnetic; a lit match inches from gasoline. His ‘otherness’ is broad enough for you to project your own sorrows; in many ways, just as the Joker can be read as Arthur’s Jungian shadow – which Carl Jung described as the side of oneself which ‘personifies everything that the subject refuses to acknowledge about [themselves]’ – so too can Arthur/Joker function as the audience’s shadow self onto which we project fears and desires we can never defeat or act out ourselves. Arthur is as much an avatar for our avarice as for his own. Joker’s fashionable glow-up and joyous dance down the stairs is an ecstatic ode to breaking up with law and social convention (scored to a song by a real-life monster), but it’s also the way Arthur expresses his delight and freedom after committing a murder. Joker’s moment of unbridled delight might be a moment of catharsis after ninety minutes of slogging through Arthur’s sombre existence, but it also implicates us in his post-murder bliss, making us active participants in his moral descent.\n\nThe creation of his alter ego appears to have been a slow and gradual process, facets of the Joker tectonically shifting under the surface for years until the cracks begin to show. The factors for his shift are legion: is Joker a product of Gotham’s oppressive urban horror, or of the governing elite’s political apathy, or was Arthur Fleck actually the mundane disguise concealing Joker, his true self, all along? S.T. Joshi views the double as ‘represent[ing] those parts of the self that society, and perhaps the individual as well, find unacceptable’, and manifest as ‘a mirror version of the self whose behaviour reveals all that the original would prefer remain hidden’ (Joshi, 2007, 190). In this light, Joker may not just be a symptom of external societal oppression but also Arthur’s internal repression of the aspects of himself that he cannot accept. Perhaps, then, his sense of dislocation stems from a lifetime of repressing the Hyde-like loose cannon within who, when he finally erodes his timid predecessor, is given his own name, costume, and means of carrying out Arthur’s impotent rage. His quixotic quest for comic notoriety is undercut by a scathing truth his mother of all people says in the bluntest terms: ‘Don’t you have to be funny to be a comedian?’ You might chalk up Arthur’s singularly unrealistic dream to a delusional belief in his own greatness – Phoenix notes that Arthur ‘sees himself as a king in some ways’, and with that the kind of ‘arrogance’ and ‘need to be revered, adored’ – or perhaps it’s naively self-destructive plot that’s doomed to fail. He’s a paint-smeared Tantalus grasping for skyscraper dreams, and his failure is achingly inevitable. Except for the little boy on the bus, Arthur never makes anyone laugh except himself; perhaps his singularly unrealistic dream is a self-destructive time bomb, or an Oedipal desire to supplant Murray Franklin, or even just a delusional belief in his own greatness – Wisecrack argues that Arthur doesn’t want to make people laugh as much as he wants them to see him.\n\nArthur’s showmanship takes a sinister turn after the Subway killings, when he vents his post-murder emotions into a macabrely beautiful ballet. The film’s relentless ambiguity makes it difficult to identify the exact moment when Arthur Fleck dies and the Joker rises, but this bathroom dance is perhaps one of the most legitimate answers; the eerie grace of Arthur’s movements signal an internal transformation, or at the very least the first fallen domino in his descent. Every time he dances it appears to signify another indelible shift towards the Joker persona: his first is a cutesy, sign-twirling soft shoe that showcases his childlike innocence, the bathroom dance immediately post-kill, rocking out on the stairs, his slow-motion euphoria amid a sea of cheering admirers, and his sinister musical exit through the corridors of Arkham. Perhaps Arthur dies for good when he kills his mother, or maybe when his hero ridicules him on-air. Arthur first dyes his hair and paints his face after Penny’s death, but only puts on the red suit after he kills Randall – physically, he is Joker in that moment as he dances on the stairs, transformed, but arguably the change is cemented only after his on-air assassination of Murray, and the crowning of the Clown Prince of Crime by the riotous mob soon after.\n\nAlthough I accept that I am one of three people who enjoyed 2004’s Van Helsing, I found its twist on the werewolf to be one of the most arresting and insightful takes on the supernatural alter ego. (Joker even references werewolves in his Murray Franklin tirade!) Onscreen werewolf transformations often occur externally – hair sprouts, limbs stretch, snouts and fangs and talons protrude. Yes, there is something of an inside-out element to these too – bones stretch under muscle and skin, fangs push down from gums etc – but the werewolf elements grow out of human flesh. In Van Helsing, when the character Velkan transforms, he literally peels off his human flesh to reveal the wolf within – it’s not only visually intriguing, but also psychologically compelling in that it embodies the notion of the beast within us all. It’s a notion I was reminded of when watching Arthur Fleck eerily paint his face and dye his hair to mimic the cartoonish visage of his rent-a-clown alter ego Carnival. Having been assured by his mother that his purpose in life is to spread laughter to the world, Arthur has to literally put on a happy face (as the movie’s tagline goes) in order to skirt near joy – his face paint is first a jolly mask he uses to conceal his sorrowful existence, but as the movie goes on it becomes increasingly clear that it is Arthur that is the mask, and Joker his true face. It is the moments when he is smeared in clownish makeup – and blood – that Arthur comes alive: when he shoots the Wall Street guys (and dances out his post-kill euphoria in the subway bathroom), when he stabs Randall in his apartment, and when he finally dons his full Joker get-up on Murray Franklin’s show.\n\nIn this way, I find Joker’s colourful glow-up to be the visual signifier of his internal shift. Arthur’s drab, dated wardrobe is reinvented in garish, clashing colours that speak to the contradictions in his soul; his dark greasy hair becomes a gorgeous verdant coiffure (Kay Georgiou, I salute you); and the stairs he once wearily scaled now become the stage for his joyous descent. Nicki Ledermann’s amazing makeup manages to be striking, scary and sexy all at once, and Mark Bridges has done the unthinkable in reinventing the Joker’s iconic purple-and-green look into something bold, new and yet recognisably Joker-esque. The makeover doesn’t come out of left field: Joker is imbued with facets of Arthur’s waking life – the clown makeup and colour-clashing costume of his day job, mixed with the suave style and swaggering showmanship of his idol Murray Franklin. Arthur’s new look is not just a stylish reinterpretation of his dime-store rent-a-clown duds, he also incorporates elements of past Jokers – Cesar Romero’s gaudy colour scheme and gleeful exuberance; Jack Nicholson’s masterful elegance (and sweet dance moves!); Heath Ledger’s feral charisma and magnetic volatility; and, yes, even Jared Leto’s sex appeal, which you have to admit was more overt than past versions. And yet, Arthur Fleck is a noticeably different beast to the insane clown posse that preceded him: twitchy, sinewy, palpably off-kilter, and with a capacity for sweetness and kindness that his antecedents never even hinted at (that is, if his telling of his tale is to be believed). Joker’s longevity might be chalked up to Batman’s personal ‘no kill’ rule, but it might also be prescribed to the ubiquity of the anarchy he embodies – in many ways, he manifests the sentiment uttered by the eponymous antihero of Alan Moore’s V for Vendetta: ‘Behind this mask there is more than just flesh. Beneath this mask there is an idea… and ideas are bulletproof.\n\nTwo Natures at War: Joker as Jekyll & Hyde\n\nThe Gothic double that first stood out to me watching Joker was Robert Louis Stevenson’s Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, particularly Jekyll’s assertion that ‘in each of us, two natures are at war: the good and the evil. All our lives the fight goes on between them, and one must conquer. But in our own hands lies the power to choose – what we want most to be, we are’. Arthur/Joker and Jekyll/Hyde are both dual identities inhabiting a single form, battling for dominance on a destructive moral descent, with Arthur as the more timid, temperate Jekyll to Joker’s brash, brutal Hyde – though both are merely two sides of the same being. It is not that Jekyll/Arthur is good and Hyde/Joker bad, but rather that the latter is the side that has been long repressed, and that societal op/repression helps to shape and mould the alter ego. Putting aside much of the valid criticism of the film’s depiction of mental illness mentioned above, from a doubles perspective alone Arthur’s laugh might be interpreted as an external signifier of the repressed Joker battling to escape his internal prison.\n\nThough not explicit in the text, there is a great deal of sexual subtext in Jekyll and Hyde that can also be found in Joker, perhaps most obviously in the romanisation/sexualisation of Sophie who in Arthur’s hallucinations is a blandly supportive and sexually submissive dream girl who exists only to be there for him and his problems. Arthur dances after his kills, each number incorporating a sensuality which apparently stems from the thrill of the kill. Joker’s apparel and aura are decidedly sexier than then the drab Arthur’s, specifically intertwining his sexuality with his capacity for and commission of violent acts in a way that appears reminiscent of Hyde.\n\nHyde’s brutal murder of Sir Danvers Carew is analogous in my view to Arthur’s killings of the father figures he craves as well as the patriarchal society he feels has abandoned him. Randall refers to Arthur as ‘my boy’ and manipulatively asserts authority over him; Arthur dreams of a Murray who ‘would give it all up to have a kid like [him]’; and Thomas Wayne might just be Arthur’s biological father. Like Murray, Carew is an ‘aged and beautiful gentlemen with white hair’ whose paternal qualities are especially apparent when compared to the younger, more juvenile ‘son[s]’ that Hyde/Arthur are. The shocking manner of Randall’s murder seems especially reminiscent of Hyde’s similarly visceral killing of Carew (the novella describes Carew’s bones ‘audibly breaking’ under Hyde’s blows, just as we hear the squishy thuds of Arthur slamming Randall’s head against the wall), and thematically resonant with Murray’s death, which is quicker but similarly vicious. Thomas Wayne may share Carew’s elevated status and gruesome death but not his kindness. Both Thomas and Murray reject Arthur in humiliating fashion: Thomas with a literal punch in the face, and Murray with a metaphorical punch to the gut. Though Jekyll dies where Arthur lives, I would suggest that just as Jekyll ends his life having transformed physically into Hyde with no return, so does Arthur begin his new life by having transformed internally and externally into his Hyde-like Joker persona. The transformation is complete.\n\nShow the World Its Own Shame: Joker as Dorian Gray\n\nArthur might seem, on the surface, the least like Dorian Gray of any of the doubles I have chosen to focus on in this post – and it’s true. Arthur might initially lack Dorian’s youth, beauty and status, but what they have in common are narcisstic tendencies so potent that they fuel their descent into moral turpitude. Crucially, I would argue that Joker’s flashy makeover and Dorian’s picture are both facades which externally manifest the accumulation of their internal sin. Where Dorian’s portrait manifests this in an ugly way, Arthur appears more attractive and confident as Joker – but both are embellished versions that end up projecting their true selves.\n\nWilde once said that ‘behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something tragic’, and Joker is indeed as exquisite as he is tragic. He is a man ruled by hunger with no means to sate it; even the hedonistic Lord Henry Wootton’s description of a cigarette as being ‘the perfect type of perfect pleasure’ because ‘it is exquisite and leaves one unsatisfied’ is common to Arthur. His imagined relationship with Sophie also sounds a lot like Henry’s cynical derision of romance: ‘When one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one’s self, and one always ends by deceiving other. That is what the world calls a romance’. In this arena, Arthur initially seems more like a Sibyl Vane than a Dorian Gray, whimsically fantasising about the perfect love, but in emotional terms Dorian is naïve too. His narcissism coupled with his youth and inexperience leads him to declare, ‘I don’t want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them’. Arthur is at the mercy of his mental illness, his mother’s care, and his own repressed emotions – which, by the final reel, he does dominate – though not in a positive way.\n\nHenry, too, functions as Dorian’s picture: ‘I represent to you all the sins you never had the courage to commit’, and Joker too is the violent, more capable persona which appears to surface when Arthur is attacked or wronged. Henry observes that ‘the books the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame’, which appears to me an apt description of Joker himself – because Joker is Gotham, in all its cruel, ugly glory. He is its seedy underbelly; the blood on the tarmac; the trash on the streets. Their shared decrepitude is showcased when they kill. The only murder we see Dorian commit first hand is his killing of Basil, and the scene of Randall’s death plays out with many of the same beats, including an element of premeditation on both Dorian and Arthur’s parts and the visceral, personal nature of the death itself.\n\nLike Dorian Gray’s picture, I suggest that Joker is the canvas onto which is projected an idealised version of Arthur/Dorian’s most attractive self, and arguably his true self. Dorian and Arthur take a somewhat innocuous image – a handsome young man, a party clown – and infuse it with essence of immorality and criminality that taint the image with insidiousness. The Joker persona and the picture become receptacles of sin, physical charts of their counterpart’s moral downturns. The picture’s first imperfection appears after Dorian’s cruel treatment of Sibyl; in a similar vein, the first hints of the Joker emerging occur after Arthur kills the Wall Street guys. His first kill occurs when he is masked in clown makeup; over time, this façade becomes melded with the increasing dominance of his Joker self.\n\nAll Humankind Sinned Against Me: Joker as Frankenstein’s Creature\n\nAlthough Jekyll and Hyde might have been the first double that struck me while watching Joker, and Dorian’s picture the most evocative comparator, it’s Frankenstein’s creature that I feel resonates with Arthur’s character most poignantly (and not just because it’s another Joker-adjacent character that Robert De Niro has played!) Like the sorrowful creature, Arthur is incessantly rejected by all those from whom he desperately craves love and affection. Years of abuse and neglect sculpt him into a wretched being who rages against his multitude of creators (Penny, Murray, Thomas Wayne, Gotham itself). Isolated and abandoned, his simmering rage festers and rots the dreams he once held. Once his very identity has been shaken to the core, he takes on a new one, and rains down glorious vengeance on all those he perceives to have wronged him, sparing those who offered him a shred of kindness. Just as the creature wanted to ‘inspire love’, Arthur wanted to bring joy and laughter to the world, as his mother always assured him he would – but when he found the world unresponsive and unmoved, he turned, as the creature does, to inspiring fear. He becomes not a creature of joy but a creature of destruction – or, perhaps from his view, a creature of joy and destruction, comedy and tragedy.\n\n‘Am I thought to be the only criminal when all humankind sinned against me?’ There are echoes of the creature’s words in Joker’s defence on the Murray Franklin show, an point to a fragmenting of responsibility for Arthur’s actions among many – though the culpability for carrying out those deeds rests with him alone. A cold, unfeeling society shaped, isolated and abandoned both Arthur and the creature, and both occupy a lower class than their (biological/metaphorical) ‘creators’ Victor and Thomas. Strikingly, Arthur and the creature have similarly anonymous origins – Arthur was adopted and his true name unknown, while the creature was never given one. While Arthur is not as characteristically eloquent as the creature, he does get a chance to give his testimony and explain his motivations as the creature does, during his appearance on the Murray Franklin show. Although the sex and gender identity of the creature are open to interpretation, he (as the character is referred to in-text) appears to feel entitled to the same privileges that Victor enjoys, and therefore arguably locates himself in the same delusional, brutal white privilege that Beandrea July identifies in Arthur Fleck, empathetically framed by the film as a wronged victim seeking to give his (white) perpetrators ‘what they deserve’ while glossing over his violence towards women of colour.\n\nSome speculated early on that (an ultimately underused) Zazie Beetz might have been cast as Harley Quinn, the Joker’s partner in crime and life from the animated series/comics. This was not the case, as Beetz plays Sophie Dumond, the sweet, slightly world-weary single mother who lives down the hall from the Flecks with her young daughter Gigi (Rocco Luna). Sophie seems like the grown-up personification of the ‘girl next door’, and the woman of Arthur’s wildest dreams – which, it turns out, are the only realm in which their courtship has taken place. It is a bit suspicious that she finds his stalking charming rather than a glaring red flag (something I originally chalked up to Phillips’ cringey ‘woke culture’ comments, which were gloriously rebutted by Joker star Marc Maron, and Phillips’ poor track record of writing women in his films). When a bedraggled Arthur breaks into Sophie’s apartment to complain of his ‘really bad day,’ we realise she only knows him as the guy who lives down the hall. In a mirror of the only interaction they have shared in real life, Arthur points a finger-gun to his head and fires. This is the last time Sophie appears in the film; our only clue to her and her daughter’s fate being the sirens that may or may not ominously point to Arthur having once again taken revenge on those who tread on his dreams. Phillips has since categorically explained that Arthur did not kill Sophie as she never wronged him, and that a deleted scene would have revealed she watched his talk show appearance, but I still feel I still think Sophie’s fate was left too ambiguous (couldn’t we have seen her framed in the doorway of her apartment as Arthur stalks out of it?)\n\nThe women of Joker, especially in light of July’s concerns, remind me of the oft-invisible/voiceless women victims of Frankenstein, for whom neither the creature nor Arthur appear to have much compassion. This is demonstrated in Arthur’s response to his social worker Debra Kane (Sharon Washington) – tellingly, her name is never spoken in the film or listed in the credits (which only identifies her as ‘Social Worker’) but can only be gleaned from her nametag. Although Arthur claims she never listens to him, Debra actively empathizes with him by saying ‘They don’t give a shit about people like us’ (my emphasis). Debra is facing a different kind of oppression to Arthur, but he seems unable to sympathize with her, just as he is with Sophie, conveniently editing her daughter out of his domestic daydreams and believing that Sophie would find his stalking endearing. He spins an entire relationship out of a brief moment of affinity in the elevator, drawing on her moment of sympathy and yet offering her none when the fantasy implodes. Indeed, Tambay Obenson observes that the black women in Joker are ‘arguably the only characters who show any semblance of humanity’, and although I would add his Ha-Ha’s coworker Gary to that list, Arthur’s declaration that Gary is ‘the only one that’s ever been nice to me’ further demonstrates his white privilege and racial blinders, especially in light of the evidence Obenson presents.\n\nLike Arthur, the creature is fixated on possessing a ‘mate’, and when one is denied to him, he kills the equivalent person in Victor’s life. The creature’s search for love is far from irrational, but his methods are: he craves affection, but is eager to entirely disregard the feelings of the female creature, dehumanizing and denying agency to his future mate in not a dissimilar to the way in which he has been treated. Like Arthur, the creature feels entitled to the love his father and humanity have denied him and is willing to take it by force if necessary. If one reads Sophie’s final scene with Arthur as ending in her offscreen murder, then the Elizabeth comparisons are even more potent. Sophie seems particularly reminiscent of Elizabeth Lavenza, the unrequited object of Arthur/the creature’s warped affections. Elizabeth is a woman who occupies so many roles in Victor’s life (surrogate mother, adopted sister, fiancée) as to make their relationship inevitably unhealthy.\n\nElizabeth is so comprehensively selfless as to seem like a fantasy; yes, she is a fictional character, but in the universe of Frankenstein she is real, and almost too good to be true. Her dogged focus on the domestic and her all-encompassing love for Victor likens her in my eyes to Arthur’s dream version of Sophie, who exists to please, appease and praise Arthur. His fantasy, then, is not a romance, but a doormat; not companionship, but blind adoration – someone to fawn over him, flatter him, and fan his dreams of stardom. Sophie’s rejection of Arthur also triggers a turning point in a similar way that the De Laceys’ rejection of the creature did in Frankenstein. The fantasy of Sophie conjured by Arthur also aligns her, in my reading, with the unnamed female creature demanded as a mate for Victor’s first creation. Although the culmination of their character arcs may differ, both the unnamed female creature and Sophie are not allowed to exist as fully-realised, independent versions of themselves. Instead, they are fantasies fashioned (literally/metaphorically) by delusional men, and who live or die according to the whims of said men. The fantasy of Sophie and the female creature are both violently destroyed in a literal or psychological sense, leaving their true selves in the hinterlands outside the four corners of the page/screen.\n\nThat’s Life…?\n\nJoker is an equally bewitching and mystifying film. It is thoughtfully constructed, gorgeously shot and tackles some of the more significant social issues of our age, and while I feel that it is simultaneously too oblique and too on the nose in various respects, its commercial success speaks to a resonance in the story that mere aesthetics and a brilliant leading performance alone might not have achieved. Although it has blindspots and missteps in relation to race, gender and mental illness, it feels to me like a film which sincerely, earnestly and unblinkingly interrogates disenfranchisement, social isolation and the deepening class divide which is exacerbated by the virulent apathy of the ruling elite. Its Gothic influences and doubles imagery spoke to me the most, but there’s so much to mine that it wouldn’t surprise me if it’s still being fervently discussed, analyzed and reinterpreted a decade from now. I for one won’t be forgetting the tragic tale of Arthur Fleck anytime soon – and if you’re in the same boat, you might want to check out the companion piece I’ll be writing for Hedgehogs and Foxes on the legal aspects of the film and the way it positions Joker and Batman as philosophical figureheads in the battle for Gotham’s soul.\n\nThank you for reading this post! If, like me, you’re still venturing down the rabbit hole of Joker analyses, I highly recommend Princess Weekes’ characteristically excellent and authoritatively sceptical review, Mark Kermode’s elegant appraisal, Peter Bradshaw’s scathing summation, Felix Biederman’s acerbic assessment, Joshua Meyer’s deep-dive, and Donnia Harrington’s sympathetic reading of Arthur’s plight. I’ve also enjoyed Rob Harvilla’s briskly thorough recap of (a pre-Joker) Joaquin’s chequered, cherished career, Keith Phipps’ insightful, gendered look at Phillips’ filmic journey to Joker, and Simran Hans’ scorching evaluation of the movie’s tone."
