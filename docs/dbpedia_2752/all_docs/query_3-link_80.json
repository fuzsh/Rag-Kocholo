        "text": "By donning the white greasepaint to play the title character of Todd Phillips’s “Joker,” the three-time Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix has joined a surprisingly elite squad of actors to tackle the role. There’s clearly something about the character’s heady mixture of theatricality, bleak humor, and good old-fashioned psychopathy that attracts thespians of note. Phoenix’s performance has drawn praise from critics and film festivals alike, but how does he measure up to the previous Jokers of the big and small screen? Here, we offer our rankings of who laughed it best.\n\n7. Jared Leto, ‘Suicide Squad’ (2016)\n\nPhoenix certainly can’t do much worse than Leto. The Oscar-winning “Dallas Buyers Club” co-star’s run at the role was preceded by breathless reports of his Method-style madness throughout production — gifts of dead animals andused condoms, intimidation of crew members, only communicating in character, etc. — so the result was the wrong kind of shocking: Leto is barely present in the final cut, with only a handful of mercifully short scenes in which the actor cackles desperately, menaces frantically, preens embarrassingly and is generally about as scary as your average trick-or-treater. It’s a frustratingly shallow performance, in which the actor and his director focus on flashy surfaces (his comically on-the-nose tattoos include the words “Damaged” and “HAHAHAHA”) rather than plumbing the depths and darkness that made the Joker so memorable in the first place.\n\nThen again, perhaps Leto was paying homage not to the recent Jokers of note, but the original onscreen portrayal: the film and television star Romero, who played the role throughout the three-season run of the comic book’s initial television adaptation, as well as its 1966 feature film expansion. The half-hour series was basically a live-action cartoon, with bright colors, lively music and snazzy graphics reflecting the Pop Art aesthetics of the era. Thus, the broad portrayals of Gotham’s supervillains were appropriate to the material, and Romero’s interpretation of the Joker as a merry prankster is one of the show’s highlights. But he doesn’t make much of an impression to modern eyes — and the series’ recent high-definition upgrade draws even more attention to his regrettable decision not to shave his mustache for the role.\n\n5. Zach Galifianakis, ‘The LEGO Batman Movie’ (2017)"
