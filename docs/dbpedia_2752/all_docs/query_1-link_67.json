        "text": "As won't be a surprise to anyone who knows much about movies, studio filmmaking sure isn't cheap, because when your film stars A-list actors, requires fancy production design, elaborate visual effects, and so on, the numbers quickly add up to potentially hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nWith so many of last year's mega-budget blockbusters underperforming at the box office, there's been a call for Hollywood to rein in its alarmingly huge spending, though if some of the biggest movies releasing this year and next are any indication, executives haven't quite gotten the memo yet.\n\nThese upcoming movies have frankly jaw-dropping budgets, for while plenty of $200 million movies are able to turn a profit, it's entirely dependent on so many factors - marketing, subject matter, and of course, the actual quality of the film itself.\n\nWith all that in mind, these hugely budgeted - arguably over-budgeted - movies have quite the steep hill to climb if they want to reach profitability at the box office.\n\nWhile many of them have sure potential to do well, it won't surprise many if they end up under-performing due to how much they ended up costing...\n\nBudget: $200 million\n\nOne of the biggest box office wild cards of the year is Twisters - a standalone sequel to 1996's much-loved disaster thriller Twister. And though the trailer certainly sells the solid cast and glossy mayhem, its $200 million price tag is more than a little concerning.\n\nEven accepting that disaster movies about tornadoes inherently don't come cheap and the original film grossed almost $500 million worldwide, an MCU-sized budget for a 30-years-later sequel seems like a colossal, arguably unnecessary risk.\n\nThe simplicity of its premise and rising popularity of star Glen Powell will certainly help, but the huge budget means that, using the typical 2.5x rule, it needs to gross $500 million to be a true success.\n\nAs last year proved beyond any doubt, spectacle alone won't necessarily drive a film to commercial success - the marketing will also need to persuade audiences that this is a can't-miss experience on the big screen that won't hit the same at home.\n\nGiven the talented cast and crew involved, here's to hoping Twisters is one of the summer's big breakout hits."
