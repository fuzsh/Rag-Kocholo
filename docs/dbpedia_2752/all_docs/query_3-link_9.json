        "text": "as a viewer why would i really give a shit what the budget is or how its distributed, i'm happy people got paid. it makes sense, you make a movie that made corpo a ton of money, and you demand a lot more money to return and make a sequel that probably will also make a ton of money. corpo's love minimizing risk and making a sequel to a huge hit eliminates a lot of risk but not all.\n\ni didn't particularly care for the first movie and don't understand how it made a billion and probably won't go to theaters to see this but will see it at home when it hits HBO or whatever, but its someone elses problem on budgets, story, etc. all i care about is whether its a movie i want to see in theaters (no), and if its interesting and/or fun and/or different.\n\nit is hilarious to see the machinations so transparent though, lady gaga as harley is both genius and such an obvious ploy to guarantee a big audience, the only one bigger would be taylor swift. with eminem as joker's henchman or something ridiculous like that too.\n\nheck, thats joker 3: eminem, dr. dre, drake, taylor swift are all in it as other batman villains. joker 4 is BTS.\n\nDoes anyone want this film?\n\nThe first felt like some weird must watch this for no good reason moment and after watching it, I really don't want a minute more.\n\nDoes anyone want a sequel to the film that made a billion dollars seems like an odd question to pose.\n\nBut Era is also home to where numerous people said who asked for this for Avatar 2 and said it would bomb so…\n\n200 million budget for a musical about Joker. And people wonder why Cinema is struggling these days.\n\nHow bad can things be if they are fine with setting a fifth of a billion on fire for no reason\n\nI would never swear a film will be a huge hit but Lady Gaga is insanely popular and is likely bringing in many people who didn't watch the first film. Considering the first film was a massive critical and commercial hit I have no idea how anyone could rationally think the odds are that this will perform poorly.\n\nThe budget is massive no doubt but unless this just reviews terribly it should do gangbusters.\n\nOther than pay, I wonder what they're doing with that budget. It must be much larger in scope than the first, right?\n\nShazam 2 had a $125 million budget. Sure it wasn't the best looking movie of the year or anything, but it's so effects heavy it's easy to understand where those dollars went. That plus the first movie's budget doesn't add up to the current one.\n\nJohn Wick 4 had a $100 million budget. I assume people were getting paid for the 4th entry in a consistently successful franchise. That seems more in line with the scope of what I would have expected out of Joker 2 and it costs half as much.\n\nI'm looking forward to this, but I wonder if it'll be another one to put on a \"this was really good and it made $600 million dollars, but that puts it in flop territory\" list like so many other recent big movies.\n\nThere's pay raises and then there's this.\n\nHe won the Best Actor Oscar for the first movie. You aren't going to make the sequel without him. He could have asked for more money and probably gotten it.\n\nRobert Downey Jr got paid $10 million for a very short time in Spider-Man Homecoming. If you are the top star in a billion dollar movie, you are getting a huge check for sequels.\n\nI'm joking, but that's such a huge waste of money all around, i don't get it... Even if you pay the stars a lot, it can't cost this much\n\nWhat are you basing this on? We've seen like 4 stills from this movie so far and people are deciding how much it should or shouldn't cost? For what reason, just to feed into/validate some narrative?\n\nThe first movie was a massive hit yes its a risk but its a risk that makes sense for WB if you can convince the creative team from the original to come back (namely Phoenix and McKay). It's the cost of doing business. If Greta Gerwig and Magot Robbie wanted a $200-300 million budget to make Barbie 2 Warner Bros is signing on in a second.\n\nI would never swear a film will be a huge hit but Lady Gaga is insanely popular and is likely bringing in many people who didn't watch the first film. Considering the first film was a massive critical and commercial hit I have no idea how anyone could rationally think the odds are that this will perform poorly.\n\nThe budget is massive no doubt but unless this just reviews terribly it should do gangbusters.\n\nSeems a bit alarmist, this is still Batman stuff which incredibly popular and stars 2 huge mega stars. Gaga alone will easily make the budget back.\n\nI mean, I hope you guys are right, but I would not have taken that bet if I was in the shoes of whatever executives who signed up on this\n\nI mean, I hope you guys are right, but I would not have taken that bet if I was in the shoes of whatever executives who signed up on this\n\nI'm not saying I think it's good or smart the budget ballooned that much. But sequel to massively success movie adds one of the biggest music stars on the planet is a really good bet to sell a lot of tickets. Pressures on of course with that budget.\n\nI mean, I hope you guys are right, but I would not have taken that bet if I was in the shoes of whatever executives who signed up on this\n\nFair enough, seems like a safe bet to me but I'm wrong a lot lol\n\nAfter 2023 studio's should realise massive budgets are a huge risk.\n\nyou do realize the movie finished principal photography close to a year ago right\n\nHe won the Best Actor Oscar for the first movie. You aren't going to make the sequel without him. He could have asked for more money and probably gotten it.\n\nIn the other thread it says he's getting 20 mil and Gaga is getting 12 mil. Still doesn't account for like 100 mil\n\nGuess the Batmobile is gonna be doing some sick stunts in this\n\nLol, for real? There have been 2 other very famous Wonka movies and they are both musicals.\n\nFor real, I remember a thread around here about other movie trailer that they ate doing what they can to hide the fact that is a musical, and most people of the thread had no idea wonka was a musical\n\nI logged in just to say that I'm legit shocked and a bit panicked that Wonka is a musical\n\nPlenty of others following that\n\ngoing by the official trailer I too had no idea\n\nView: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNh9bTjXWg&ab_channel=WarnerBros.Pictures"
