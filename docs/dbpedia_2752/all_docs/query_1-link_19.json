        "text": "While it was suspected by most that Joker would be a smash hit for DC and Warner Bros., it’s safe to say that no one predicted it would be as successful as it has been. The film has already broken a variety of box office records, including being the most profitable comic book movie ever made. Now starting today it will be the highest grossing R-rated film globally.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the new Joker film is sitting at $998 million globally. At this rate, Joker will be hitting the $1 billion mark incredibly soon. And it will also likely be surpassing the worldwide gross of The Dark Knight soon, which is incredibly surprising considering that the film has yet to even open in China.\n\nIt definitely is a great success for the new Joker movie, and no doubt Warner Bros. is pleased. While there isn’t exactly anything set in stone, it’s probably safe to say that they’ll be considering a sequel in the near future. And Joker director Todd Phillips recently spoke about doing a sequel in a new interview. As he stated:\n\n“It couldn’t just be this wild and crazy movie about the Clown Prince of Crime. It would have to have some thematic resonance in a similar way that Joker does. Because I think that’s ultimately why the movie connected, it’s what’s going on underneath. So many movies are about the spark and this is about the powder. If you could capture that again in a real way, that would be interesting.”\n\nWhile we don’t know the specifics of what could be happening in the far future for Joaquin Phoenix’s interpretation of Joker, it’s clear that the movie is doing incredibly well at the moment. And at that rate, it’s worth celebrating. Hopefully it means other studios will begin to take more risks and produce installments that are true works of creativity in the future – whether they’re sequels to Joker or something new entirely.\n\nHow do you feel about Joker making $1 billion and breaking so many box office records?
