        "text": "English novelist, biographer, and playwright, who published romantic suspense novels, mostly set on the coast of Cornwall. Daphne du Maurier is best known for Rebecca (1938), filmed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1940. Orson Welles's radio adaptation from 1938 also paved way for its success. The novel has been characterized as the last and most famous imitation of Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre (1847).\n\nAdventure was here. Adventure was there. Adventure was in picking up a posy dropped by a lady and offering it to an old gentleman who patted her head and gave her two-pence. Adventure was in gazing into pawnbrokers' windows, in riding in wagons when the carter smiled, in scuffling with apprentice boys, in hovering outside the bookshops, and when the bookseller was inside, tearing out the middle pages to read at home, for prospective purchasers never looked at anything but the beginning and the end. (from Mary Anne: A Novel by Daphne Du Maurier, R. Bentley, 1971, p. 24)\n\nDaphne du Maurier was born in London into an artistic family. She was the granddaughter of caricaturist George du Maurier, her mother, Muriel Beaumont, was an actress, and her father was the actor-manager Sir Gerald du Maurier, who turned to writing and created the mad hypnotist Svengali. Gerald decided to call her daughter Daphne after the actress Ethel Daphne Barrymore, whom he had wanted to marry, several years before he met Muriel.\n\nOne of Daphne du Maurier's ancestors was Mary Anne Clarke, the mistress of the duke of York, second son of King George III. She later became the heroine of du Maurier's novel Mary Anne (1954). In 1831 Mary Anne Clarke's daughter married Louis-Mathurin Busson du Maurier.\n\nHer father du Maurier portrayed in Gerald (1934), which she began to write immediately after his death. Du Maurier herself entered the book only in the third person. Of her grandmother she said: \"Pem was like a hen after her chicks, wrapping them up for fear of draughts and dosing everyone within sight, including Kicky [George], with cold-liver oil.\" (ibid., p. 3) Her mother, from whom she felt unarticulated hostility, worried Gerald's \"horrid colds.\"\n\nDu Maurier grew up in a lively London household, where friends like J.M. Barrie (or \"Uncle Jim\" as she called him). Gerard had played Captain Hook in his play. Edgar Wallace visited them frequently. Peter Pan's Wendy Moira Angela Darling was partly named after du Maurier's older sister, Angela. The actor Geoffrey Millar became infatuated with the fourteen year old Daphne.\n\nFrom early on, Du Maurier was a voracious reader, especially imaginary worlds fascinated her. At the age of 16, she read Katherine Mansfield's Bliss and Other Stories (1920), which inspired her own writing. \"I'm sure I should never have started writing stories if I hadn't had her example before me,\" du Maurier once said. (The Pathology of Desire in Daphne du Maurier's Short Stories by Setara Pracha, 2023, p. 6) Uncle Willie, editor of the fashionable Bystander, published one of du Maurier's early pieces, 'And Now to God the Father' in 1929, and got her a literary agent.\n\nLike the Brontë sisters, the du Maurier girls were drawn to imaginary worlds. Especially Peter Pan had a strong influence in their childhood. Daphne's elder sister Angela was a prolific writer of letters and she wrote some books, too. Her first novel, The Well of Loneliness, rejected by publishers, was about a woman's love for another. The youngest sister Jeanne, who was a fine pianist, became a painter. Her long-time partner was the poet Noël Welch.\n\nKeenly aware that of her father's desire for a son, du Maurier grew up wishing that she had been a boy. However, she was her father's favorite, partly due to her literary talents. Her masculine alter ego she called \"Eric Avon.\" As an adult, she wore trousers, like Marlene Dietrich in the films Morocco (1930) and Blonde Venus (1932); it was a provocative costume at that time. In addition, Du Maurier had a male narrator in several novels. Later in life she wrote in a letter, \"And then the boy realised he had to grow up and not to be a boy any longer, so he turned into a girl and not an unattractive one at that, and the boy was locked in a box forever.\" (Daphne Du Maurier: Writing, Identity and the Gothic Imagination by Avril Horner, Sue Zlosnik, 1998, p. 5)\n\nDu Maurier attended schools in London, Meudon, France, and Paris. The Loving Spirit, (1931), her first book, was followed by Jamaica Inn (1936), a historical tale of smugglers. It was bought for the movies, and directed by Alfred Hitchcock, who later used her short story, 'The Birds,' a tense tale of nature turning on humanity, for another film production. Also du Maurier's Frenchman's Creek, a pirate romance, and My Cousin Rachel (1951), were successfully filmed.\n\nThe latter examined how a man may be manipulated by a woman, who perhaps has murdered her husband. Ambrose Ashley meets the beautiful Rachel Sangaletti, marries her and died six months later. He has sent letters to his nephew Philip, the narrator, who first hates Rachel, and then is bewitched by her. Du Maurier leaves open the question, is Rachel a poisoner, or an innocent victim of Ambrose's and then Philip's paranoid fantasies. Always being asked the same question, did Rachel kill Ambrose, du Maurier had to telll that she wasn't sure anymore. Rachel dies, taking the secret with her, but Philip's role in her death is clear, and perhaps he is the real murderer.\n\nBefore du Maurier married Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Arthur Montague Browning II in 1932, she had sexual liaison with the director Carol Reed; he was her first boyfriend. Browning, who was knighted for his distinguished service during World War II, died in 1965. Though their union appeared perfect on the surface – they were married for thirty-three years and had three children – she felt uncomfortable with other army wives. In 1947 du Maurier fell in love with Ellen Doubleday, the wife of her American publisher, who remained her lifelong friend, and then with the actress Gertrude Lawrence.\n\nFrom 1943 Du Maurier's home was at a seventeenth-century mansion, Menabilly, overlooking the sea, for a quarter of a century. The house, which she had discovered already in 1927, became the scene of her historical novel The King's General (1946). She was made dame in 1969 for her literary distinction. In 1977 she received the Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America. Du Maurier died at her home in Cornwall on April 19, 1989. Her ashes were scattered on the cliffs near Menabilly, Cornwall.\n\nEnchanted Cornwall, Du Maurier's pictorial memoir, appeared posthumously in 1992. With her son, Christian, she published Vanishing Cornwall in 1967. Like Rebecca, many of her novels and short stories were set in Cornwall, England's westernmost county, whose wild, stormy weather and wild past inspired her imagination. \"Here was the freedom I desired, long sought-for, not yet known,\" she wrote in Vanishing Cornwall. \"Freedom to write, to walk, to wander, freedom to climb hills, to pull a boat, to be alone.\" (ibid., p. 6)\n\nRebecca's opening line, \"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again,\" is among the most memorable in twentieth-century literature. The story centers on a young and timid heroine. Her life is made miserable by her strangely behaving husband, Maxim de Winter, whom she just has married. Maxim is a wealthy widower, whose first wife Rebecca has died in mysterious circumstances. His house is ruled by Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper, who has made Rebecca's room a shrine. Du Maurier focuses on the fears and fantasies of the new wife, who eventually learns that her husband did not love his former wife, a cruel, egoistical woman. Franz Waxman's film score was recorded in nine sessions over five days. Among the musicians was Hollywood's star violinist Louis Kaufman, who played the violin solos. (Franz Waxman's Rebecca: A Film Score Guide by David Neumeyer, Nathan Platte, 2011, p, 76)\n\nBecause of the familiar plot, suits of plagiarism were brought against du Maurier, but they were dropped when the widespread use of the theme, beginning from Charlotte Brontë's works, was established. Rebecca has also similarities with Carolina Nabuco's book A Sucessora (1934). Du Maurier's story, on the other hand, inspired Maureen Freely's The Other Rebecca (1996), in which the enigmatic Maxim de Winter appears as Max Midwinter.\n\nDu Maurier started to write Rebecca while traveling in Egypt. First the work progressed slowly, but then du Maurier poured all of her own emotions in the central character after learning about her husband's earlier life and his great love, Jan Ricardo, who had been an exotic, dark beauty. Ricardo died tragically during the war; she committed suicide by throwing herself under a train.\n\nBefore Alfred Hitchcock's film version, Orson Welles made a radio dramatization of Rebecca. It was performed in December 1938 by The Campbell Playhouse and sponsored by Campbell Soup. The adaptation starts with Bernard Herrmann's waltz-laden score, but is then interrupted by an \"important message from a man who keeps one eye on the dining table and another on the pantry . . .\" (Orson Welles: The Road to Xanadu by Simon Callow, Vintage, 1996, p. 420) Welles played Maxim de Winter and Margaret Sullavan was the second Mrs de Winter. Herrmann later used parts of the score for Robert Stevenson's film Jane Eyre (1943).\n\nThe producer David O. Selznick sent a transcript of the broadcast to Hitchcock. \"Last week's radio broadcast of Rebecca . . . created a minor sensation in this country. . . . I think it was exceptionally well timed, and there are certain phases of which I should like you to study. In particular, I have been thinking about the idea of the first-person method of telling the story in part . . . (Despite the System: Orson Welles versus the Hollywood Studios by Clinton Heylin, 2005, pp. 78-79) Hitchcock's first Hollywood film perhaps failed to assimilate Daphne du Maurier's book, but it went on to become the most successful film of 1940 and received 11 Oscar nominations. When Neville Chamberlain flew to Munich to meet Hitler in 1939, he was said to have relaxed with du Maurier's Rebecca on the plane trip.\n\nBesides popular novels du Maurier published short stories, plays, and biographies, among others Branwell Brontë's, the brother of sisters Anne, Charlotte, and Emily. The Glass-Blowers (1963) was a novel about the Busson family. Her biography of Francis Bacon, an English statesman in the 1500s and 1600s, came out in 1976. Du Maurier's autobiography, Growing Pains, subtitled The Shaping of a Writer, was published when she was 70. In the late 1950s, du Maurier began to take interest in the supernatural. During this period she wrote several stories, which explored fears and paranoid fantasies, among them 'The Pool,' about a young who girl glimpses a magical world in the woods, but is later barred from it, and 'The Blue Lenses,' in which a woman sees everyone around her having the head of an animal.\n\nNot After Midnight (1970), du Maurier's second collection of short stories, included 'Don't Look Now,' a tale set in Venice, involving a psychic old lady, a man with the sixth sense, and a murderous dwarf dressed in a red coat. Nicholas Roeg's screen adaptation from 1973 was photographed with expressive use of colour. In his previous films, Roeg had acted as his own cameraman, but on this this complex production he collaborated with the cinematographer Anthony Richmond.\n\nFor further reading: Daphne Du Maurier by Richard Kelly ( 1987); Daphne: The Life of Daphne du Maurier by Judith Cook (1991); The Private World of Daphne du Maurier by Martyn Shallcross (1992); Daphne du Maurier by Margaret Forster (1993); Daphne Du Maurier: A Daughter's Memoir by Flavia Leng (1995); Daphne Du Maurier: Writing, Identity and the Gothic Imagination by Avril Horner, Sue Zlosnik (1998); Daphne Du Maurier, Haunted Heiress by Nina Auerbach (1999); Daphne the Loner by Angelina Dexter (2003); The Daphne du Maurier Companion by Helen Taylor (2007); The Official Guide to Daphne du Maurier in Cornwall by Martin Harris; edited by Alexa Tewkesbury (2011); Daphne du Maurier and Her Sisters: The Hidden Lives of Piffy, Bird and Bing by Jane Dunn (2013); Daphne Du Maurier at Home by Hilary Macaskill (2013); The Du Mauriers: Just as They Were by Anne Hall (2018); 'Daphne Du Maurier: Sex and Death the Italian Way' by Avril Horner and Sue Zlosnik, Haunted Europe: Continental Connections in English-language Gothic Writing, Film and New Media, edited by Evert Jan Van Leeuwen and Michael Newton (2019); The Pathology of Desire in Daphne du Maurier's Short Stories by Setara Pracha (2023) - George Du Maurier (1834-96).

General audiences will tab it as a long-drawn out drama that could have been told better in less footage.\" (Variety, March 27. 1940) Du Maurier herself did not like the film, which shifted the locale from Cornwall to America. - 1948, TV movie, in The Philco Television Playhouse, dir.
