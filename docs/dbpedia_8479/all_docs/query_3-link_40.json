        "text": "Working on Time & the Priestleys, a film I made with and about my father, JB Priestley, I looked for a way to illustrate his immense output, and finally covered a full-size billiards table at his house, spreading books in all directions: English editions and translations. A rough estimate totals around 35 novels, 35 plays and 40 works of non-fiction, leaving aside articles, film and TV scripts, and radio programmes. Why so much?\n\nHaving decided quite young that he wanted to be a writer (in his teens he was writing a column for a weekly Labour periodical), he had no private income, so to begin with he would write for whoever would print his work. He wrote and wrote; he would write every morning, take a break after lunch for a game of tennis or a walk, then write again after tea for another two to three hours. We were forbidden to play within earshot of his study - \"Daddy's working!\" - and if I was sent there on an errand, I would creep in to find him sitting with his back to the window, cotton wool stuffed in his ears and a faraway look in his eye. I felt I was calling him back from a distant place - the world of the imagination.\n\nTo him it was a welcome world, and one he easily visited. By going there he could lay the ghosts of his experiences in the trenches of the first world war. Despite this enormous output and regular hours, he once described himself as lazy, which I understand to mean that writing came easily to him; he evolved a simple, direct style that appealed to any reader. He did not write for the few, and perhaps because of that he was too often brushed aside by the elite; he was a populist, choosing to reach as large a readership as possible. He had a strong intuition about people and society, which made him a powerful commentator and social critic. At heart he believed that people were capable of more than life allowed them, and that during the second world war the opportunity arose for them to unite in a common purpose. The hope was that this spirit and energy would continue into peace-time.\n\nPerhaps here, too, lay his enthusiasm and love for the theatre; it was an entrance into the private world of the imagination, and at the same time a collaboration above and beyond any individual. He had experienced it from the outside as a youth, attending both theatre and music hall, and writing about them for his column, but he could enter it only once he could afford to gamble on plays, both as writer and producer. The enormous success of The Good Companions followed by Angel Pavement gave him that stability, even if the label \"bestselling author of The Good Companions\" hung uneasily on him. His first solo play was Dangerous Corner, which opened to indifferent reviews in the daily papers, causing the management to threaten early closure. So he decided to take over the production himself; luckily, the play received good reviews in the Sunday papers, enjoyed a decent run, and has been revived around the world ever since.\n\nFollowing the end of the second world war in 1945, he was involved in trying to improve the organisation and status of the theatre; he was Britain's delegate for the arts to Unesco, chaired the International Theatre Conference, lectured at the Fabian Society and the Old Vic, and published booklets of his lectures. The most important of these was the original \"The Art of the Dramatist\", which started as a lecture but was then rewritten for a series of radio talks. In this he set out his theory of what he called \"dramatic experience\", which proposes the proper balance between \"the suspension of disbelief\", where one accepts the reality of what one is witnessing on stage, yet has a simultaneous awareness of being in an audience watching actors performing. He insisted on the crucial relationship between audience and players, that the audience have achieved a kind of communal response, and the actors have adjusted their performance to match it. So both sides are contributing to the imaginative experience. This for him, when it worked properly, was the basis of the unique magic of the theatre; a magic that has its roots in the religious origin of the theatre in times past.\n\nHe believed in God, but distrusted organised religion, as he did the dogma of political parties; he was an old-fashioned socialist from the Chapel traditions of his native Bradford, but he never joined a party. It was a shock to see his name on a list of \"fellow travellers\" compiled by George Orwell, for he wrote as vigorously against communism as he did against fascism. But he could see certain things that were well organised in Soviet Russia, most particularly the theatre. Some critics have condemned him for these views without bothering to see what he actually wrote.\n\nIt is now 21 years since JB Priestley's his death, and this Monday, July 4, we shall gather at the National Theatre to celebrate his life and work. In many ways, he has not really left us; the legacy of his writings and ideas lives on, and if the books are rarely reissued, this may reflect more on publishing today as well as the thriving second-hand market for the many editions put out in his lifetime. He would have hated the current obsession with celebrities, and that appalling word \"luvvies\". My father believed in the craft of playwriting, a craft handed down through the ages, and approved of experiments. He cared passionately about the serious theatre, which was entertaining as well as inspiring and which at best can enhance a healthy feeling of community with others - a true \"dramatic experience\"."
