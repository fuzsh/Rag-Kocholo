        "text": "Born and brought up in in Bradford, the author John Boynton Priestley was a highly successful and prolific English novelist, playwright, screenwriter, broadcaster and social commentator. He went on to write many plays such as An Inspector Calls, When We Are Married and of course Mystery at Greenfingers!\n\nIt is one of Priestley’s lesser-known plays and was carefully devised as a test piece for amateur dramatic societies competing in the ‘News Chronicle Drama Contest’ 1937-38.\n\nThe play is set in 1938 in the Greenfingers Palace Hotel on the edge of the Peak District. Staff arrive early to prepare the hotel for opening and find themselves stuck there when the weather takes a turn for the worse.\n\nThe events that follow leave Detective Crowther with many mysteries to solve. He immediately sets to work, interrogating and accusing staff members one by one, ingeniously discovering clues, and coming to clever conclusions – or at least so he thinks...\n\nWith a wonderful cast, Burley’s production is a truly captivating play. This atmospheric production will have you on the edge of your seat and forever second guessing!\n\nPerformances are at the Queens Hall, Burley-in-Wharfedale on Thursday 20th, Friday 21st and Saturday 22nd of June at 7:30pm (bar from 7pm)."
