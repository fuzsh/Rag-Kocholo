        "text": "From BAFTA-winning director Philippa Lowthorpe and Golden Globe-nominated screenwriter Emma Frost, comes this exhilarating adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's classic gothic novel, Jamaica Inn.\n\nSpirited Mary Yellan (Jessica Brown Findlay) finds herself alone in the world when her mother passes away. She is forced to move to the isolated Jamaica Inn, deep in the heart of the windswept Cornish moors, where she enters a world where nothing is as it first appears. Her Aunt Patience (Joanne Whalley) is a shell of the carefree woman she was, firmly under the spell of her domineering husband, Joss (Sean Harris). Joss is the head of a violent smuggling gang and when he isn't smuggling, he is drinking heavily to forget all he has seen and done. Then there's the enigmatic Jem (Matthew McNulty), her uncle's brother and not to be trusted in Mary's mind. But her heart may be saying otherwise...\n\nLife at Jamaica Inn challenges Mary's black-and-white sense of right and wrong as she finds herself living among smugglers in a lawless land. When she thinks she has witnessed a murder, Mary wonders at what cost she will stay silent."
