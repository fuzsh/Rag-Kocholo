        "text": "The story: Mary Yellan, after the death of her mother, moves to her aunt and uncle who lives in Cornwall in the infamous Jamaica Inn. Mary Yellan hasn’t seen her aunt in years, and is shocked to find the cheery woman, being turned into someone who’s beaten and broken. She concludes that it’s the result of the uncle, whom she dislikes immediately. She also suspects he is in the centre of all the talk in the town about why no-one visits Jamaica Inn anymore.\n\nMy thoughts: I’ve read both Rebecca and My cousin Rachel and knew what I was getting myself into. Du Maurier usually writes interesting stories, with realistic yet gruesome characters and with at least one twist. Du Maurier was also quite popular in her time, even before Alfred Hitchcock turned to her books again, and again and again. I both enjoyed Jamaica Inn very much. At the same time, I had some issues with how common some of the tropes she used in the book has become. I wouldn’t surprise me that Du Maurier was a huge factor in making some of these tropes so popular, but it still made the “twist” at the ending very predictable.\n\nIt was very frustrating because I wanted to like it, I DID like it, but not as much as I WANTED to like it. If that made any sense. The writing is amazing. I listened to this in audiobook, because grown-ups do laundry and other grown-up stuff, and I had to pause what I did because I was so engulfed by the story and the setting. The moors are written so wonderfully without being boggled down by too much details, and the way she describes character’s are so honest and realistic. Jamaica Inn was based on a real place, and all her characters fit into this real setting, even if they are made up. The writing style is quintessential Daphne du Maurierian.\n\n“a silence on the tors that belonged to another age; an age that is past and vanished as though it had never been, an age when man did not exist, but pagan footsteps trod upon the hills. And there was a stillness in the air, and a stranger, older peace, that was not the peace of God.”\n\nI still want to read more Du Maurier, and if you have any recommendations please let me know in the comments down below.\n\n“He took her face in his hands and kissed it, and she saw that he was laughing. “When you’re an old maid in mittens down at Helford, you’ll remember that,” he said, “and it will have to last you to the end of your days. ‘He stole horses,’ you’ll say to yourself, ‘and he didn’t care for women; and but for my pride I’d have been with him now.”\n\nAfter I read the book, as I often do, I read/watch other bookblogers and youtubers review of Jamaica Inn. Areaderofliterature asked in their blogpost if the ending was supposed to be a happy or scary one. I hadn’t thought so much about the ending, and when I did it mostly reminded me of the ending of Rebecca. I read the ending of Rebecca as neither sad nor happy, but as realistic. Life, sometimes, ends up just okay, and the ending reflects that. Have you read the book? What do you think about the book? What do you think about good endings that show a life that’s just okay? Let me know in the comments down below."
