        "text": "Although best known the world over for his masterpiece novel, Don Quixote de la Mancha, published in two parts in 1605 and 1615, the antics of the would-be knight-errant and his simple squire only represent a fraction of the trials and tribulations, both in the literary world and in society at large, of this complex man. Poet, playwright, soldier, slave, satirist, novelist, political commentator, and literary outsider, Cervantes achieved a minor miracle by becoming one of the rarest of things in the early modern world of letters: an international best-seller during his lifetime, with his great novel being translated into multiple languages before his death in 1616. The principal objective of the Oxford Handbook of Cervantes is to create a resource in English that provides a fully comprehensive overview of the life, works, and influences of Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra (1547–1616). This volume contains seven sections, exploring in depth Cervantes’s life and how the trials, tribulatio...\n\nMiguel de Cervantes Saavedra was a Renaissance writer at the time of the Spanish \"golden age\". His novel “Don Quixote” (The Ingenious Nobleman Mister Quixote of La Mancha) published in 1605 and in 1615 is a story about Alonso Quixano-a ruined Hidalgo. When “his wits being quite gone” (1, I) he imagines himself to be a knight -Don Quixote La Mancha. Together with his arms bearer Sancho Panza (local peasant) he wanders through Spain in search of adventures, but encounters many calamities."
