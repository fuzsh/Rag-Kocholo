        "text": "Viewers who tuned into the launch of Jamaica Inn were left frustrated after struggling to make out the dialogue in the BBC's new period drama.\n\nThe first instalment of the TV adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's classic gothic novel, starring Downton Abbey actor Jessica Brown Findlay, was broadcast on BBC1 on Monday.\n\nViewers complained that they had to switch on the subtitles or turn up the volume to the maximum setting to understand what the cast was saying.\n\nA BBC spokeswoman said that the corporation, which received 107 complaints, was reviewing the episode following \"issues with the sound levels\".\n\nComedian Al Murray was among those attempting to make out what was being said by the stars of the atmospheric drama.\n\n\"Find out what happens next in Jamaica Inn by getting your ears syringed!,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nChoreographer and former Strictly Come Dancing judge Arlene Phillips wrote on the social networking site: \"Did anyone else have trouble hearing BBC1 Jamaica Inn.\"\n\nJohn Challis, known for his role as Boycie in Only Fools and Horses, wrote: \"Jamaica Inn LOOKS very good but I haven't heard a single word ... Either the actors are mumbling or the sound track is faulty.\"\n\nA viewer wrote: \"Oh dear I know BBC1 is keen on authentic but the dialogue in Jamaica Inn is incomprehensible.\"\n\nAnother complained: \"Jamaica Inn mumble mumble. Couldn't understand a word of innkeeper. Terrible.\"\n\nEmma Frost, who wrote the screenplay, suggested that a technical fault, rather than the way that the cast delivered the lines, was to blame.\n\n\"No surprises here – I'm told there was a major sound problem for tonight's broadcast of Jamaica Inn – not surprised you couldn't hear it,\" she wrote.\n\nA BBC spokeswoman said that the drama was watched by 6.1 million viewers.\n\nThe BBC later apologised to viewers and said that the \"sound levels\" could not be altered while the drama was on air.\n\nBut it said that it had adjusted the dialogue levels for Tuesday's second episode.\n\nThe corporation said in a statement: \"There were issues with the sound levels last night and for technical reasons they could not be altered during transmission.\n\n\"We are adjusting the dialogue levels in episode two and three to address audience concerns so they can enjoy the rest of the drama and would like to apologise to those viewers who were affected.\"\n\nThe complaints come almost a year after BBC director general Tony Hall said the corporation could look at how to stop actors \"muttering\" in its TV dramas.\n\n\"I don't want to sound like a grumpy old man, but I also think muttering is something we could have a look at,\" he said. \"Actors muttering can be testing - you find you have missed a line … you have to remember that you have an audience.\"\n\nHe said that the corporation was addressing the problem of background music making it difficult for some, particularly older viewers, to hear what was being said.\n\nThe drama, set in 1821 against the windswept Cornish moors, was directed by Philippa Lowthorpe, whose credits include Call the Midwife.\n\nThe three-part series follows Mary Yellan who is forced to live with her aunt and domineering uncle following the death of her mother."
