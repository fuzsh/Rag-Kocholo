        "text": "Warner Bros Germany Picks Up ‘Madame Bovary‘Warner Bros Germany has acquired all German-speaking rights to Sophie Barthes’ Madame Bovary from A Company Filmed Entertainment. Based on the classic Gustave Flaubert novel, the film stars Mia Wasikowska, Rhys Ifans and Ezra Miller. Barthes co-wrote the screenplay with Rose Barrenche. Currently in postproduction, Madame Bovary tells the tragic story of Emma (Wasikowska), a young beauty who impulsively marries a small-town doctor in order to leave her father’s pig farm behind. But after being introduced to the glamorous world of high society, she soon becomes bored with her stodgy mate and seeks excitement and status outside the bonds of marriage. Joe Neurauter and Felipe Marino of Occupant Entertainment are producing in association with Aden Films’ Barthes and Aleph Motion Pictures’ Jaime Mateus-Tique. UK-based Prescience is financing with Tim Smith and Paul Brett as exec producers. Co-producers include A Company’s Alexander van Duelmen and Kai Kuenneman, Scope Pictures’ Genevieve Lemal and Left Field Ventures’ John Engel. Radiant Films International is handling foreign sales. A Company has distribution in select territories including Eastern Europe, Russia and Vietnam.\n\n‘Jamaica Inn’ Off To Strong Start On BBC One\n\nJamaica Inn, BBC One‘s three-part adaptation of Daphne du Maurier’s 1936 gothic novel, got off to a strong start on Monday night. The drama kicked off with 6.09M viewers and a 25.1% share in the 9 PM slot. Downton Abbey‘s Jessica Brown Findlay stars in the adaptation that’s produced by Origin Pictures. Emma Frost (The White Queen) wrote the transfer, with BAFTA winner Philippa Lowthorpe (Call The Midwife) directing. Set in 1820s Cornwall, the story follows spirited Mary Yellan (Brown Findlay), a young woman sent to live with her aunt (Joanne Whalley) after the death of her mother. When Mary arrives at the eerie, isolated Jamaica Inn, she finds her once-carefree aunt is now firmly under the spell of domineering husband Joss (Sean Harris). The inn, it turns out, is a front for a smuggling ring. As Mary attempts to navigate her new surroundings, she falls for bad boy Jem (Matthew McNulty) and begins questioning her own morals and loyalties until an ultimate test reveals her true self.\n\nAlvernia Studios, Excel Entertainment Partner On ‘Bangistan’\n\nPoland’s Alvernia Studios is ramping up its relationship with India. The facility is partnering with Indian producer Excel Entertainment to bring Karan Anshuman’s upcoming comedy Bangistan to Krakow. Filming starts in July with the Polish studio taking on line production responsibilities. The film about two rival terrorists who meet by chance on the streets of Krakow stars Bollywood actors Ritesh Deshmuks and Pulkit Samrat, as well as a host of Polish supporting talent. Alvernia has offices in Mumbai and already has made inroads to the Indian film market. It has done postproduction work on Indian projects including last year’s hit biographical sports drama Bhaag Milka Bhaag. Based outside Krakow, Alvernia’s other credits include Richard Gere legal thriller Arbitrage and Amy Heckerling’s Vamps."
