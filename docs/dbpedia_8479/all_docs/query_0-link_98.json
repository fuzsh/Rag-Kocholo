        "text": "For a course at the Oscher LifeLong Learning Institute at American University\n\nDay: Thursday afternoons, 1:45 to 3:15 pm online\n\nJune 6 – 27\n\n4 sessions On-line (location of building: 4801 Massachusetts Avenue, NW DC 20016)\n\nDr Ellen Moody\n\nWomen in and Writing Detective Fiction (a continuation of The Heroine’s Journey)\n\nWe will explore the genre of detective stories of the mystery-thriller type from the angle of the woman writer, detective, victim & murderer: our two books are classics from and dependent upon classic and/or very popular at the time 1930s detective novels: Dorothy Sayer’s Gaudy Night (set in a real early women’s college, which Sayers attended, it is also feminist academic and publishing satire & a love story); and P.D. James’s An Unsuitable Job for a Woman, which in many outward conventions combines the popular and acclaimed type with what readers expected post WW2, so like Sayers written in puzzle-clue tradition of Agatha Christie (today carried on by among others Anthony Horowitz). We’ll read only 2 novels as we’ve no time for more, but I will discuss two others, one from 1950s, Josephine Tey’s much admired The Daughter of Time, the case being that of Richard III Plantagenet’s murder of his two young nephews; and Susan Hill’s Various Haunts of Men, an anxiety-producing gothic contemporary 2008 thriller. This to bring in a wider & longer perspective. We’ll also see (outside class) and discuss (in class) a 1950s play/TV movie, J.B. Priestley’s An Inspector Calls (as rewritten by Helen Edmunsen and directed by Aisling Walsh in 2015). This is a feminist literary history course, an outgrowth in one direction of the course I taught last summer: The [archetypal] Heroine’s Journey\n\nRequired Texts:\n\nDorothy L. Sayers, Gaudy Night, HarperCollins Bourbon book, ISBN 978-0-06-219653-8\n\nP. D. James, An Unsuitable Job for a Woman, Scribner’s, mostly recently reprinted 2019. ISBN 978-0-7432-1955-6\n\nRequired Movies:\n\nAn Inspector Calls. Scripted Helen Edmunsen, directed Aisling Walsh, a re-do of J.B Priestley’s original play (1945), adapted into a film in 1954 (featuring Alistair Sims as “Poole” in lieu of Goole). Available at Amazon Prime, Brit-Box, Vudu, and YouTube. Also as a DVD for sale, with an interesting feature by Priestley’s son.\n\nSupplementary:\n\nThere are audio readings of both books; and you can buy the play for this movie (and full script for Gosford Park, complete with cast list and stills), but you do not at all need to\n\nPriestley, J. B. An Inspector Calls and Other Plays. NY: Penguin, 2000 reprint of 1947 book. The script does not differ as much as one might think; what is dramatized differs.\n\nSophie Rundle as Eva Smith/Daisy Renton/Mrs Birling/Alice Grey confronts the “boss,” Ken Stoff as Arthur Birling, about to fire her for leading a strike (An Inspector Calls, 2015)\n\nFormat: The class will be a mix of informal lecture and group discussion.\n\nJune 6: 1st week: Introduction on detective versus spy fiction, the archetypal heroine, 1860s – 1960s; Dorothy Sayers and Lord Peter Wimsey detective fiction\n\nJune 13: 2nd week: Dorothy Sayers’ Gaudy Night, and Sayers’ life and a survey of her career.\n\nJune 20: 3rd week: Post WW2 mysteries/spy stories/thrillers: Priestley’s An Inspector Calls, as revised by Helen Edmunsen and Aisling Walsh. Importance of central detective; then recurring detectives and kinds of setting and/or place, esp in P.D.James.\n\nJune 27: 4th week: P. D. James’s An Unsuitable Job for a Woman. The evolution of the women’s detective and recent police procedural mysteries (e.g. Jane Tennison and Prime Suspect); and P. D. James’ later career, her Adam Dagliesh series, and James’ post-text to Jane Austen, Death Comes to Pemberley made into BBC TV 3 part movie. Only if we have time or people would like, I’ll discuss brilliant movie parody of the genre, especially in movies, Robert Altman and Julian Fellows’ Gosford Park (2001).\n\nEdward Petherbridge as Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Walter as Harriet Vane (1987, Have His Carcase)\n\nRecommended outside reading or watching (if you want to go further):\n\nBrabazon, James.

I have a 1988 copy of the Simon and Schuster Touchstone books, 978-0-684-80386-9; and another by Pushkin Press (a very pretty one), ISBN 978-1782278429. If you have never heard of Richard III, he’s a controversial figure. An excellent video on the unearthing of his skeleton, will give you some insight into what is said about him. Tey’s book was of course written well before the skeleton was unearthed. Mathew Morris, The King Under the Car Park: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAaGETTiLs&ab_channel=ArchaeologicalServices\n\nIrony: one of the famous aspects of his character, that he was deformed, at one time disputed fiercely by the Richard III society, has become the basis for clinching the argument that the found skeleton is Richard III – especially by this society.\n\nYoung, Laurel A. P.D. James: A companion to the mystery fiction. McFarland, 2017\n\nMason, Bobbie Ann. The Girl Sleuth. Athens: Univ. of Georgia Press, 1975\n\nThere was a Margaret Sutton who herself wrote the Judy Bolton series (1932-67)\n\nThe photo used on the 1970s printing of Ross Poldark (the decade in which the first TV serial was aired)\n\nThe 1970s Demelza cover photo (novel first published 1946)\n\nDear readers and friends,\n\nI spent a good chunk of my reading time today re-reading Winston Graham’s Ross Poldark (first published 1945) for the first time in a number of year, and have been genuinely surprised — I marveled — at how I found myself deeply engaged by the story, the characters, and thus the author’s Cornwall. Anyone who has been reading this blog for several years knows for a few of these I was committed to reading the Poldark books, watching both TV serials, and then reading many of Graham’s other fiction, about him, and about Cornwall. I’m just loving this material all over again.\n\n1975 First still of Robin Ellis as Ross Poldark returning home, the revenant to Cornwall\n\nFirst glimpse of Angharad Rees as Demelza, an impoverished abused young girl protecting her dog, Garrick\n\n2015 Aidan Turner, as Ross, filmed as magnificent hero\n\nEarly in relationship Elinor Tomlinson as an angry Demelza in servant girl’s dress\n\nI’ve returned to it because I find myself taking great pleasure in a many-sessioned on-line course sent out from a European OLLI at York University, From Lyonesse to Launceston: The Literary Landscape of Cornwall. Unfortunately we didn’t begin with the Arthurian tales, but rather poetry by Thomas Hardy; for me this choice for beginning the only flaw thus far in the course. Eight registered older adults, and a touchingly enthusiastic (idealistic about literature in the way I once was openly) teacher, Ruth Beckett (I find her by the end of each 2 hour session irresistible and enter into her awed discourse) who works very hard to take us into the texts in an original ardent spirit:\n\nshe uncovered a Blake-like John Betjeman (Jim loved his poetry for the nostalgia as well as the unafraid caustic critiques), has introduced us to Charles Causley’s poetry (website), Patrick Gale a experienced in his unusually organized novel, Pictures from an Exhibition, and now taken us through three (in my case at one time) deeply loved favorites: Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse (I also once again reveled in the 1983 movie featuring Rosemary Harris and Michael Gough); Daphne DuMaurier’s still mesmerizing Rebecca (I managed to break free of the interpretation of the book where Maxim de Winter is a kind of Bluebeard tyrant — he’s another vulnerable soul) and re-saw the best movie, 1970s, 4 parts utterly faithful to the book, with Joanna David as mature heroine looking back, Jeremy Brett a volatile de Winter, and the inimitable Anna Massey as Mrs Danvers; and Graham’s first Poldark book.\n\nNo longer focusing on the sadomasochistic strain in DuMaurier’s dark visioned books (think of The Scapegoat, “The Bird,” Jamaica Inn), and browsing her Vanishing Cornwall, I am as I return to my Poldark secondary matter: how much of the spell Graham casts in this rooting of the story in this ancient neolithic place (I’ve visited three times, become a privileged periphery, edge territory like the Scottish Highlands. Each of our texts thus far picks up on different aspects (the art colonies since the 1890s; a wildness of liminality; poverty and corrupt splendor), but all perpetually come back to the importance of the sea, solitude and rituals, the cliffs and rocks, flora and trees, the mines and all they brought, fishing and grief, poverty. Books to read to come include Philip Marsden’s Rising Ground, which I’ve read bits and pieces of, but also quite new to me authors and books, Helen Dunmore’s Zennor in Darkness, Sarah Winman, A Year of Marvelous Ways, Peter Hobbes, A Short Day Dying, and books to touch upon (Rosamund Pilcher, The Shell Seekers, Judy Finnigan, I Do Not Sleep, on childhood isolation and an unromantic Cornwall, Charlie Carrolls’ oddly titled The Lip. I’ve added A. L. Rowse’s A Cornish Childhood (reading for 3 in the morning) and P. D. James late murder thriller fantasy, The Lighthouse, set on an imaginary island just off Cornwall. The course ends end of July. I did not pay for this one myself; it is a precious gift from a German friend, also taking the class.\n\nWhat will be the outcome? anything concrete? Can I return to my Poldark project, only in a different form. My social abilities are poor, and now what mobility I had at risk, much weakened. I am told to use a wheelchair during all airplane travel. I am thinking, could I invent a new perspective from which a longer essay or book could come, say Cornwall as a place and edge/marginal/liminal ground.\n\nHave a look here on Causeley’s life and poetry and a walking tour through Launceston\n\nFor tonight, I’ll begin with historian Bernard Deacon’s somewhat grim (highly factual), The Real World of Poldark, a rare book-length study centering on extrapolation’s from Graham Poldark books (books have hitherto been versions of film adaptation and cultural studies).\n\nEllen"
