        "text": "After serving as auditor for the French Council of State (1846–49), Passy devoted himself to writing, lecturing, and organizing on behalf of various economic reforms and philanthropies. An ardent free trader, he belonged to the 19th-century liberal tradition of the British economists Richard Cobden and John Bright, whom he knew personally.\n\nPassy’s work for peace began during the Crimean War (1853–56). His plea for peace in the periodical Le Temps (1867) helped to avert war between France and Prussia over Luxembourg. In the same year, he founded the International League for Peace, later known as the French Society for International Arbitration. After the Franco-German War (1870–71) he proposed independence and permanent neutrality for Alsace-Lorraine. As a member of the French Chamber of Deputies (from 1881), he successfully urged arbitration of a dispute between France and the Netherlands concerning the French Guiana–Surinam boundary. He assisted in founding the Inter-Parliamentary Union (1888) and remained active in the peace movement for the rest of his long life."
