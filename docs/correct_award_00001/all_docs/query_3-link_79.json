        "text": "ONE This year's Nobel Peace Prize was won by Martti Ahtisaari, and as the citation says, the award was given to him in recognition of 'his important efforts on several continents and over more than three decades to resolve international conflicts.' How old is this year's Nobel laureate for Peace?\n\nTWO Marrti Ahtisaari is so far the only person from Finland to have won the Nobel Peace Prize. However, there was one writer from his country to have won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1939. What is his name?\n\nTHREE In the nineties Ahtisaari was the president of his country. Six years ago, in 2002, a former American president, Jimmy Carter, was also given the same award. But the first American President to get the coveted award was Theodore Roosevelt. The citation said that he brokered the Treaty of Portsmoth which ended the Russo-Japanese War. Any idea when the prize was given to him?\n\nFOUR According to the will left behind by Alfred Nobel the peace prize must be given 'to the person who shall have done the most, or the best work for the fraternity between nations for the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.' Some people have suggested that the institution of the award was his way to compensate for two inventions that were deadly. What were the two inventions?\n\nFIVE The Nobel Prize for Peace is given every year in Oslo and in the presence of the King of Norway on December 10. Why is the date so significant?\n\nSIX The remaining Nobel Prizes - for literature, physiology, medicine, chemistry and physics (the prize for economics was not instituted as per the will of Nobel. It came much later in 1969) - are given in the capital of another Scandinavian capital. Can you recall its name?\n\nSEVEN Nobel prizes were not given during the war years - WWI and WWII - but there were also some years when the Nobel Peace Prize committee did not find any individual or institution that deserved the prize, such as in 1918, 1928 and 1948. Which was the last year when no Prize was given?\n\nEIGHT The Nobel Peace Prize was given for the first time in 1901. The coveted prize was awarded jointly to two people; one was Jean Henri Dunant and the other Frederic Passy. Which countries did they belong to?\n\nNINE Of the 96 peace laureates, the only Nobel Peace Laureate to be born in the subcontinent was Mohammed Yunus. He shared the prize with the institution that he set up. What was its name?\n\nTEN The American scientist Linus Carl Pauling won the Peace Prize in 1962 for his vigorous campaigns for the control of nuclear weapons and nuclear testing. He was only the second Nobel Laureate to have won the Nobel Prize in two disciplines. Madame Curie was the first to have been bestowed with awards in two different categories. For which branch of science did Pauling win his first Nobel Prize?\n\nANSWERS\n\n(1) 71 (2) Franz Eemil Sillanpaa (3) 1906 (4) Dynamite and ballistite (5) Because that is the death anniversary of Alfred Nobel (6) Stockholm (7) 1972 (8) Switzerland and France (9) Grameen Bank (10) Chemistry â€” Compiled by A.N."
