        "text": "Many familiar faces have won the Nobel Peace Prize over the years, but some lesser-known achievers have made just as much of an impact on the world.\n\nMartin Luther King - 1964\n\nAfrican-American civil rights icon Martin Luther King worked to persuade the US to declare the policy of racial discrimination in the southern states unlawful.\n\nIn 1963, 250,000 demonstrators marched to the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, where Mr King gave his famous I Have a Dream speech.\n\nThe following year, the US passed laws prohibiting all racial discrimination. That same year, Mr King received the peace prize for his \"nonviolent campaign against racism\".\n\nHe was murdered in 1968.\n\nMother Teresa - 1979\n\nMother Teresa taught in India for 17 years before she experienced her 1946 \"call within a call\" to devote herself to caring for the sick and poor.\n\nHer order established a hospice; centres for the blind, aged, and disabled; and a leper colony.\n\nShe was summoned to Rome in 1968, and in 1979 received the Nobel Peace Prize for her humanitarian work.\n\nShe died in 1997 at the age of 87.\n\nThe Dalai Lama - 1989\n\nThe 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, was awarded the Peace Prize in 1989 for his \"consistent resistance to the use of violence in his people's struggle to regain their liberty\".\n\nThe religious and political leader was exiled from India in 1969 and has stood at the head of the nonviolent opposition to China's occupation of Tibet ever since.\n\nWhen the Nobel committee chose the Dalai Lama, it emphasised that he based his Buddhist peace philosophy on reverence for all living things and the idea of a universal responsibility that embraces both man and nature.\n\nNelson Mandela - 1993\n\nIn 1990, South Africa's president Frederik Willem de Klerk decided to release freedom fighter Nelson Mandela, who had been held in the notorious Robben Island prison since 1963.\n\nFollowing the release, the two politicians worked together to bring an end to apartheid.\n\nIn 1993, they were jointly honoured with a Nobel Peace Prize for their work \"for the peaceful termination of the apartheid regime, and for laying the foundations for a new democratic South Africa\".\n\nMr Mandela went on to become president, and was known as the father of the so-called Rainbow Nation and lauded internationally as an anti-apartheid hero. He died in 2013 at the age of 95.\n\nMalala Yousafzai - 2014\n\nThe 2014 prize was awarded jointly to Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi and \"for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education\".\n\nMalala was shot in the head by Taliban gunmen in 2012, but survived and became a leading advocate of girls' rights to an education.\n\nThe Pakistani teenager, now 18, is the youngest ever Nobel Prize laureate.\n\nLesser-known Indian activist Mr Satyarthi has waged a peaceful struggle to stop children being exploited as labour instead of attending school.\n\nWinners you may not know:\n\nKailash Satyarthi - 2014\n\nKailash Satyarthi has headed various forms of peaceful protests and demonstrations, focusing on the exploitation of children in India for financial gain.\n\nMr Satyarthi succeeded in freeing tens of thousands of child workers forced into bonded labour or slavery.\n\nHe has also promoted ethical employment practices among global companies and given those freed children new employment and educational options.\n\nThe prize was presented to him on the anniversary of the death of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who founded the award in his 1895 will.\n\nWangari Maathai - 2004\n\nKenyan environmentalist Wangari Maathai was the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize. She was born in Kenya in 1940.\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee at the time praised the 64-year-old for leading a campaign to plant tens of millions of trees across Africa in order to slow deforestation.\n\nMs Maathai, who has served as Kenyan assistant minister for the environment since 2003, founded the Green Belt Movement in 1977.\n\nIt is the largest tree planting project in Africa, aimed at promoting biodiversity and at the same time creating jobs and giving women a stronger identity in society.\n\nLinus Pauling - 1962\n\nAmerican Linus Pauling is the only person to have won two undivided Nobel Prizes.\n\nBorn in Oregon in 1901, Mr Pauling won the Prize for Chemistry in 1954 and he was awarded the Peace Prize for his opposition to weapons of mass destruction eight years later.\n\nThe bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were a turning point in Mr Pauling's life. He became inspired to speak out and write against the nuclear arms force alongside other scientists, and was a driving force in the Pugwash movement.\n\nIn 1959, Mr Pauling drafted the famous Hiroshima Appeal, the concluding document issued after the Fifth World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.\n\nBertha von Suttner - 1905\n\nBaroness Bertha von Suttner was the first woman to be awarded the Peace Prize. She was born in 1843 in Prague and died in 1914.\n\nShe wrote one of the 19th century's most influential books, anti-war novel Lay Down Your Arms. In the 1870s she became a close friend of Alfred Nobel.\n\nAt the male-dominated peace congresses, she stood out as a liberal and forceful leader and at the beginning of the new century she was referred to as the \"generalissimo of the peace movement\".\n\nHer last major effort, made in 1912, was a second lecture tour in the US.\n\nHenry Dunant - 1901\n\nHenry Dunant and Frédéric Passy were the first ever Nobel Peace Prize winners.\n\nMr Dunant was born in 1828 and died in 1910, and founded the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Geneva.\n\nHe witnessed thousands of Italian, French and Austrian solders kill and injure one another during an 1859 battle in northern Italy.\n\nOff his own back, his organised aid work and later wrote the book A Memory of Solferino which contained a plan for all countries to form groups to help the sick and wounded on the battlefield — no matter what side they were on.\n\nThe result was the establishment of the ICRC in 1863, and the adoption of the Geneva Convention in the following year."
