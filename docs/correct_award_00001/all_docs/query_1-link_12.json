        "text": "The International Peace Bureau (IPB), an organization with a rich history dating back over a century, stands as a testament to the enduring pursuit of global harmony. As a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1910, the IPB’s legacy is deeply intertwined with the recognition of its tireless efforts to promote peace and foster understanding across the world.\n\nMoreover, this commitment to peace has been further highlighted by the remarkable fact that13 of ours officers have gone on to become Nobel Peace Prize laureates themselves:\n\nThroughout its history, IPB has consistently demonstrated its commitment to promoting peace, human rights, and global harmony by actively supporting nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. In 2018, the IPB welcomed the decision of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee to honor Nadia Murad and Dr. Denis Mukwege for their exceptional contributions in combatting sexual violence in conflict zones. The following year, the organization applauded the recognition of Abiy Ahmed, the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, by the Nobel Peace Prize Committee for his significant efforts in resolving a longstanding conflict. This tradition of endorsing deserving individuals for the Nobel Peace Prize highlights the IPB’s role as a stalwart advocate for positive change on the global stage.\n\nIn line with its enduring dedication, IPB has once again demonstrated its commitment to advancing peace by announcing its intention to nominate three extraordinary organizations for the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize. These organizations – the Russian Movement of Conscientious Objectors, the Ukrainian Pacifist Movement, and the Belarusian organization “Our House” – epitomize the essence of conscientious objection to military service. Their unyielding commitment to human rights and peace, especially in the context of their respective nations, serves as a shining example of how advocacy can reshape societies. IPB’s endorsement of these organizations underscores the importance of conscientious objection in the pursuit of a more just and peaceful world.\n\nWe kindly urge everyone to assist us in amplifying this message, particularly to other Nobel Laureates who could potentially nominate these organizations for the Nobel Peace Prize. Below, you will find the press release along with translations into other languages (more forthcoming)."
