Taken around 1893, this portrait captures Passy's distinguished appearance with his spectacles perched on his nose and a neatly trimmed beard framing his face. Dressed in a formal jacket, he exudes an air of intelligence and authority befitting his profession. Passy's direct gaze reflects both confidence and determination, hinting at the significant contributions he made to politics and economics during his lifetime. As a statesman, he played an instrumental role in shaping France's political landscape and advocating for peace on an international level. The monochrome aesthetic adds depth to this image, transporting us back to the Victorian era when it was taken. The attention to detail is evident in every aspect of this photograph; from Passy's carefully chosen attire to the subtle nuances captured by the camera lens. Preserved through time by The Print Collector29 as part of their collection, this print serves as a reminder of Frederic Passy's remarkable achievements that led him to become a Nobel laureate. It stands as a testament not only to his personal success but also to France's rich history as well as its enduring impact on global politics and economics.\n\nMADE IN AUSTRALIA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
