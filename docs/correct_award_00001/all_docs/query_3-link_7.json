        "text": "(1822–1912). French economist and humanitarian Frédéric Passy in 1867 founded the International League for Peace, later known as the French Society for International Arbitration. He was cowinner, with Red Cross founder Henri Dunant, of the first Nobel prize for peace in 1901. (See also Dunant, Henri; Nobel prizes; Red Cross and Red Crescent.)\n\nAfter serving as auditor for the French Council of State from 1846 to 1849, Passy devoted himself to writing, lecturing, and organizing on behalf of various economic reforms. He championed free trade, believing that it would foster greater cooperation among nations and help bring about the abandonment of war."
