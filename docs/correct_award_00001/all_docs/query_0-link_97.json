        "meta_description": "On December 10, 1901, the Nobel Prizes were awarded for the first time. After protracted negotiations, partly with the French government which sought to impose a very high tax on Alfred Nobel's estate, and partly after negotiations with the Nobel family over the question of inheritance, it finally became possible for the first time to divide the five prizes, as much as Nobel had left in his will. The ceremony for four of them physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, took place in Stockholm and the Peace Prize ceremony was held in Christiania, the Norwegian capital that would later be named Oslo. Five years had passed since Alfred Nobel died at the age of 63 in San Remo on December 10, 1896. The days leading up to the awarding of the prizes were also tense. The names of the winners were kept secret - unlike today when they are revealed a month in advance. When three prominent Germans arrived by train from the south and took a seat at the Grand Hotel in Stockholm, it became clear that they must be Nobel laureates. International traffic at that time was not great and the arrival of foreign people made news. At the ceremony in Stockholm, in the hall of the Academy of Music, prizes were awarded for achievements in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature. The hall gradually filled with people in festive clothes. The three winners then entered without fanfare, music or applause as is customary today. First came the German physicist Wilhelm Conrad von Rontgen, then the Dutch chemist Hendricus van t'Hoff, followed by the German physician Emil Adolf von Behring; and finally, the French minister to receive the Nobel Prize in literature on behalf of the poet Sully Prudhomme, who was ill, while the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony took place in Christiana (Oslo) in the hall of the Norwegian parliament. The prize was shared between the Swiss Henri Dunant, founder of the International Red Cross, and the French Frederic Passy, ​​economist and peace activist. /KosovaPress/",
