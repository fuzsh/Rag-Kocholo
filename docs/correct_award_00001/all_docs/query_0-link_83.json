        "text": "The Swedish Academy, Stockholm, has awarded the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize to the Iranian human rights activist Narges Mohammadi. According to the academy, she has been chosen for the award \"for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all.\"\n\nShe will be awarded a prize money of 11 million Swedish kronor on 10 December 2023 in Oslo, Norway. 10 December is the death anniversary of Alfred Nobel, in whose name the prize is awarded.\n\nThe Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine, Chemistry, Physics, and Economic Science are awarded in Stockholm, Sweden. However, the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded at a ceremony in Oslo, Norway.\n\nAbout the Nobel Prize Winner\n\n51-year-old Narges Mohammadi is an Iranian writer, human rights activist and deputy director of the Defenders of Human Rights Center (DHRC). Currently, she is in Evin prison in Tehran.\n\nMohammadi is currently serving multiple sentences, amounting to 12 years, for \"spreading anti-state propaganda\".\n\nNarges Mohammadi has been in and out of prison for the last decade due to her activism and work on abolishing the death penalty in Iran and campaigning for women's rights.\n\nThe hardline Iranian government has arrested her 13 times, convicted her five times, and sentenced her to a total of 31 years in prison and 154 lashes.\n\nNarges Mohammadi is the second Iranian woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize after human rights activist Shirin Ebadi won the award in 2003.\n\nNobel Prize\n\nThe Nobel Prize was founded in the memory of Alfred Nobel, who, in his will, asked to set up a foundation to give prizes to those persons or institutions that, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to \"humankind\". The Nobel Foundation was set up in 1900, and the first Prize was given in 1901.\n\nNobel Peace Prize\n\nBetween 1901 and 2023, the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded 104 times to 141 persons and institutions. It includes 111 individuals and 30 organisations.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross(ICRC) is the only institution/person to get the Nobel Peace Prize thrice (in 1917, 1944 and 1963).\n\nIn 1954 and again in 1981, The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize twice.\n\nThe inaugural Prize was jointly shared by Jean Henry Dunnat of Switzerland and Frédéric Passy of France.\n\nIn 2022, the Prize was awarded to Ales Bialiatski of Belarus, Memorial, a Russian human rights organisation, and the Ukrainian human rights organisation Center for Civil Liberties.'\n\nNobel Peace Prize for Women\n\nNarges Mohammadi is the 19th woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize. In 2011, three women were jointly given the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nIndian Nobel Peace Prize Winners"
