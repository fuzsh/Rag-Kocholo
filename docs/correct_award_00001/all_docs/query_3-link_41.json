Nobel held 355 different patents by his name, dynamite being the most famous. Alfred Nobel died on 10 December 1896 at the age of 63 years.\n\nWho Selects the Nobel Laureates?\n\nIn his last testament, Alfred Nobel specifically designated the institutions responsible for the prizes he wished to be established:\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences selects the Nobel Laureate in Physics and Chemistry, Karolinska Institute selects Nobel Laureate in the field of Physiology or Medicine, the Swedish Academy for the Nobel Prize selects Nobel Laureate in Literature, and a Committee of five persons to be elected by the Norwegian Parliament selects for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nIn 1968, the Sveriges Riksbank established the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences was given the task to select the Laureates in Economic Sciences starting in 1969.\n\nOn 27 November 1895, Alfred Nobel signed his testament, giving the largest share of his fortune to a series of prizes in Physics, Chemistry, Medicine or Physiology, Literature, and Peace.\n\nLists of Nobel Prizes and Laureates\n\nThe Nobel Prizes commenced in 1901. The recipients of the first Nobel Prizes were given 150,782 SEK. In 2018, the laureates were awarded a prize amount of 9,000,000 SEK. The Nobel Prize money varies every year.\n\nWorthy to mention that despite having been nominated five times, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi never won the Nobel Prize.\n\nNow let's have a look at the important facts about the Nobel Prizes;\n\n1.
