It was founded by him in 1993, and he edited the newspaper until 2017.\n\nThe newspaper has exposed several cases of abuse of power, human rights violation and corruption.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists called his newspaper the “only truly critical newspaper with national influence in Russia today.”\n\nHe won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists in 2007.\n\nThree years later, he received the Legion of Honor order, France’s highest award, in the degree of Chevalier (Knight).\n\nHe also received for the Novaya Gazeta the Four Freedoms Award for Freedom of Speech in Middelburg, the Netherlands in 2010.\n\nAbout Nobel Peace Prize\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Swedish industrialist, inventor, and armaments manufacturer Alfred Nobel.\n\nPeace prize is along with the prizes in Chemistry, Physics, Physiology or Medicine, and Literature.\n\nThe first Nobel Peace Prize awarded In 1901.\n\nThe prize was shared between Henry Dunant of Switzerland, founder of the Red Cross, and the French parliamentarian and peace activist Frédéric Passy.\n\nSelection of Nobel Prize laureates\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for the selection of eligible candidates and the choice of the Nobel Peace Prize laureates.\n\nThe Committee is composed of five members appointed by the Storting (Norwegian parliament).\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway, not in Stockholm, Sweden, where the Nobel Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature and the prize in economic sciences are awarded.\n\nHow are the Nobel Prize laureates selected?\n\nSource:IE"
