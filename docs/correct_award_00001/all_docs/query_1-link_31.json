        "text": "THE NOBEL Peace Prize was established in 1985 as a means to recognize those who have greatly contributed to physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and for work in peace.\n\nThe prize is awarded to five deserving individuals every year on December 10, the anniversary of the founder's death.\n\nWho established the Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nAlfred Nobel was a Swedish inventor, entrepreneur, scientist, and businessman who believed in doing his part to make a positive impact on the world.\n\nHe established the first Nobel Peace Prize in 1885, in the wake of his death.\n\nNobel had acquired a small fortune, the majority of which was left behind to fund the creation of the peace prize as dictated in his will.\n\nHe described the Nobel Peace Prize as worthy of going \"to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.”\n\nHe directed that the Nobel Peace Prize be distributed to five worthy recipients, stating each prize would be handed out by category.\n\nThe first prize would go to the individual who had made \"the most important discovery or invention in the field of physics.\"\n\nThe second prize, he said, would go to \"the person who made the most important chemical discovery or improvement.\"\n\nThe third prize would be distributed to \"the person who made the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine.\"\n\nThe fourth prize would go to \"the person who, in the field of literature, produced the most outstanding work in an idealistic direction.\n\nThe fifth and final prize would be given to \"the person who has done the most or best to advance fellowship among nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the establishment and promotion of peace congresses.\"\n\nWho was the first recipient?\n\nThe first Nobel Peace Prize was handed out in Alfred Nobel's home of Stockholm, Sweden, on the five-year anniversary of his death in 1901.\n\nThere were only two Nobel Peace Prizes awarded in its first year and they were received by Frédéric Passy from France and the Swiss Jean Henry Dunant.\n\nPassy was awarded the prize for his work to establish international peace conferences, his efforts at diplomacy and arbitration.\n\nHe founded the first French Peace Society in 1878 and held a congress that year in Paris at the World Exhibition.\n\nDunant received the prize for his humanitarian efforts as he helped wounded soldiers and created international understanding.\n\nWhat was Alfred Nobel known for?\n\nAlthough Alfred Nobel is now best known for his invention of the Nobel Peace Prize, during his life, he'd been known for inventing dynamite which led to the advanced construction of tunnels, roads, and canals.\n\nHis invention was made public in 1866 as the first safely manageable explosive device to be created outside of gunpowder.\n\nHe accrued a substantial amount of wealth, which later went to fund the Nobel Peace Prize, by selling patent rights to other dynamite products worldwide, but when the US started using it for military-grade weaponry, Nobel became concerned at the outcome his invention had created.\n\nIt has been widely questioned if it was guilt at creating a deadly weapon that prompted him to establish the Nobel Peace Prize after his death."
