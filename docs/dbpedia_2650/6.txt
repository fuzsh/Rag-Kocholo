For many years, records of the vice-county distributions of UK micro-moths from c.1800 onwards have been kept on hand-annotated paper maps, first by A. Maitland Emmet and, more recently, by Dr. John Langmaid and Dr. Mark Young.

The Moths Count project has now digitised these maps and made them available to moth recorders and the general public for the first time.

A grant from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the original data supplied by John Langmaid and Mark Young have enabled us to create PDFs of all of the original micro-moth record cards and hand annotated maps. In addition to this, 756 species have been digitised to vice-county level to date. These important maps, which include data up to 31st December 2014, are available below at vice-county level for the first time. Many thanks to David Green for his hard work on this project. Please note that the maps are provisional and may contain errors.

Below is a list of micro-moth species, with numbers and names as per the New Checklist of British Lepidoptera (2013) (referred to as ABH in the table). Bradley and Fletcher numbers and former Bradley names are also included for users' convenience.

To search for a species hold down the Ctrl and F keys simultaneously to open up a search box. Simply type in the species name, or part of it to be taken to the species. Click on the icons to open up a PDF of the species record card and a map of its UK distribution at vice-county level (NB: the PDFs are large and may take a while to open).
