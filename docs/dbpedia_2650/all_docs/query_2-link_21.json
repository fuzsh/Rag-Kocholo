        "text": "Use of cyclaniliprole on cultivated plants\n\nThe present invention relates to a method for controlling pests and/or increasing the plant health of a cultivated plant with at least one modification (hereinafter abbreviated as \"cultivated plant\") as compared to the respective non-modified control plant, comprising the application of a pesti- cidally active compound of formula I\n\nor a stereoisomer, salt, tautomer or N-oxide thereof;\n\nto a cultivated plant, parts of such plant, plant propagation material, or at its locus of growth.\n\nOne typical problem arising in the field of pest control lies in the need to reduce the dosage rates of the active ingredient in order to reduce the dosage rates of the active ingredient in order to reduce or avoid unfavourable environmental or toxicological effects whilst still allowing effective pest control. Another problem underlying the invention is the desire for compositions that improve the health of a plant, a process which is commonly and hereinafter referred to as \"plant health\". The term plant health comprises various sorts of improvements of plants that are not connected to the control of pests and which do not embrace the reduction of negative consequences of harmful insects. The term \"plant health\" is to be understood to denote a condition of the plant and/or its products which is determined by several indicators alone or in combination with each other such as yield (e.g. increased biomass and/or increased content of valuable ingredients), plant vigor (e.g. improved plant growth and/or greener leaves (\"greening effect\"), quality (e.g. improved content or composition of certain ingredients) and tolerance to abiotic and/or biotic stress. The above identified indicators for the health condition of a plant may be interdependent or may result from each other.\n\nIt was therefore the object of the present invention to provide a method, which solves the problems as outlined above and which especially reduces the dosage rate and/or promotes the health of a plant.\n\nSurprisingly, it has now been found that the use of a compound of formula (I) as defined above in cultivated plants displays a synergistic effect between the trait of the cultivated plant and the applied compound of formula (I).\n\nIn a first embodiment, cultivated plants are plants that have at least one insecticidal trait. It is a wide-spread problem that insects, that are combatted with insectides, develop resistance, i.e. they become less or not all anymore susceptible to the insecticidal effect. Surprisingly, it has now been found that the compound of formula (I) are useful in methods of controlling harmful insects by treating cultivated plants, parts of such plants or their locus of growth, wherein the plant has at least one insecticidal trait, and wherein the harmful insects are resistant to an insecticidal trait of the plant.\n\nIn a second embodiment, cultivated plants are specific plants that have at least one herbicidal and at least one insecticidal trait, preferably soybeans, more preferably the soybeans known as\"lntacta RR2 PRO\" soybean (Monsanto). Surprisingly, it has now been found that the compound of formula (I) are also useful in methods of controlling harmful insects by treating those mentioned cultivated plants, parts of such plants or their locus of growth.\n\nIn a third embodiment, cultivated plants are plants that have at least one trait or trait combination which has not yet been described in connection with the use of the compound of formula (I) on cultivated plants, e.g. as listed in Table A1.\n\nSurprisingly, it has now been found that the compound of formula (I) are also useful in methods of controlling harmful insects by treating those mentioned cultivated plants, parts of such plants or their locus of growth.\n\nCompound of formula (I)\n\nThe compound of formula (I) is described in WO2005/077934 and is known under the ISO name \"cyclaniliprole\". It can be prepared according to standard methods of organic chemistry, or by the processes as described in WO2005/077934 or WO2008072743, without being limited to the routes given therein.\n\nThe preparation of the compound of formula I above may lead to isomer mixtures. If desired, these can be resolved by the methods customary for this purpose, such as crystallization or chromatography, also on optically active adsorbate, to give the pure isomers. Agronomically acceptable salts of the compound of formula (I) can be formed in a customary manner, e.g. by reaction with an acid of the anion in question. However, although the compound of formula (I) has been described in WO2014/128188 in methods and uses for controlling harmful pests on certain cultivated plants, there are further cultivated plants on which the compound of formula (I) is surprisingly effective.\n\nIn a further embodiment of the invention, the invention relates to certain mixtures of the com- pound of formula (I), and to the use of said mixture in the methods according to the invention as mentioned herein.\n\nIn one aspect, the invention relates to the mixture of the compound of formula (I) with pyra- clostrobin P, and furthermore to the use of said mixture in the methods according to the invention as mentioned herein.\n\nIn another aspect, the invention relates to the mixture of the compound of formula (I) with thi- ophanatemethyl T, and furthermore to the use of said mixture in the methods according to the invention as mentioned herein. In another aspect, the invention relates to the mixture of the compound of formula (I) with fipronil F, and furthermore to the use of said mixture in the methods according to the invention as mentioned herein.\n\nIn another aspect, the invention relates to the mixture of the compound of formula (I) with thi- ophanatemethyl T and pyraclostrobin P, and furthermore to the use of said mixture in the methods according to the invention as mentioned herein.\n\nIn another aspect, the invention relates to the mixture of the compound of formula (I) with thi- ophanatemethyl T and fipronil F, and furthermore to the use of said mixture in the methods according to the invention as mentioned herein.\n\nIn another aspect, the invention relates to the mixture of the compound of formula (I) with pyraclostrobin P and fipronil F, and furthermore to the use of said mixture in the methods according to the invention as mentioned herein.\n\nIn another aspect, the invention relates to the mixture of the compound of formula (I) with pyraclostrobin P and fipronil F and thiophanatemethyl T, and furthermore to the use of said mixture in the methods according to the invention as mentioned herein.\n\nTherefore, the mixtures in these aspects of the invention are mixtures selected from the following mixtures:\n\nTable M\n\nI = compound of formula (I), P = pyraclostrobin, T = thiophanatemethyl, F = fipronil\n\nAs used herein, the term \"compound(s) of the present invention\" or \"compound(s) according to the invention\" refers to the compound(s) of formula (I) as defined above, which are also referred to as \"compound(s) of formula I\" or \"compound(s) I\" or \"formula I compound(s)\", and includes their salts, tautomers, stereoisomers, and N-oxides.\n\nThe term \"composition(s) according to the invention\" or \"composition(s) of the present invention\" encompasses composition(s) comprising at least one compound of formula (I) or mixtures of the the compound of formula (I) with other pesticidally active compound(s) II for being used and/or applied in methods according to the invention as defined above.\n\nThe compound of formula (I) has at least one center of chirality, therefore is present as mixtures of enantiomers or diastereomers, in any case as a pair of two enantiomers. Both enantiomers are said to contribute to the pesticidal effect. The invention provides both the pure enantiomers or pure diastereomers of the the compound of formula (I), and its mixtures and the use according to the invention of the pure enantiomers or pure diastereomers of the compound of formula (I) or its mixtures. A suitable compound of the formula (I) also includes all possible geometrical stereoisomers (cis/trans isomers) and mixtures thereof. Cis/trans isomers may be present with respect to an alkene, carbon-nitrogen double-bond, nitrogen-sulfur double bond or amide group. The term \"stereoisomer(s)\" encompasses both optical isomers, such as enantiomers or dia- stereomers, the latter existing due to more than one center of chirality in the molecule, as well as geometrical isomers (cis/trans isomers).\n\nSalts of the compounds of the present invention are preferably agriculturally and veterinarily acceptable salts. They can be formed in a customary method, e.g. by reacting the compound with an acid if the compound of the present invention has a basic functionality or by reacting the compound with a suitable base if the compound of the present invention has an acidic functionality.\n\nIn general, suitable \"agriculturally useful salts\" or \"agriculturally acceptable salts\" are especially the salts of those cations or the acid addition salts of those acids whose cations and anions, respectively, do not have any adverse effect on the action of the compounds according to the present invention. Suitable cations are in particular the ions of the alkali metals, preferably lithium, sodium and potassium, of the alkaline earth metals, preferably calcium, magnesium and barium, and of the transition metals, preferably manganese, copper, zinc and iron, and also ammonium (NhV) and substituted ammonium in which one to four of the hydrogen atoms are replaced by Ci-C4-alkyl, Ci-C4-hydroxyalkyl, Ci-C4-alkoxy, Ci-C4-alkoxy-Ci-C4-alkyl, hydroxy-Ci- C4-alkoxy-Ci-C4-alkyl, phenyl or benzyl. Examples of substituted ammonium ions comprise me- thylammonium, isopropylammonium, dimethylammonium, diisopropylammonium, trime- thylammonium, tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, tetrabutylammonium, 2- hydroxyethylammonium, 2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethyl-ammonium, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)ammonium, benzyltrimethylammonium and benzyltriethylammonium, furthermore phosphonium ions, sul- fonium ions, preferably tri(Ci-C4-alkyl)sulfonium, and sulfoxonium ions, preferably tri(Ci-C4- alkyl)sulfoxonium.\n\nAnions of useful acid addition salts are primarily chloride, bromide, fluoride, hydrogen sulfate, sulfate, dihydrogen phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, phosphate, nitrate, hydrogen carbonate, carbonate, hexafluorosilicate, hexafluorophosphate, benzoate, and the anions of Ci-C4-alkanoic acids, preferably formate, acetate, propionate and butyrate. They can be formed by reacting the compound of the formulae I with an acid of the corresponding anion, preferably of hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or nitric acid. The compound of the formula (I) may be present in the form of its N-oxides. The term \"N-oxide\" includes any compound of the present invention which has at least one tertiary nitrogen atom that is oxidized to an N-oxide moiety. N-oxides of compounds (I) can in particular be prepared by oxidizing the ring nitrogen atom(s) of the pyridine ring and/or the pyrazole ring with a suitable oxidizing agent, such as peroxo carboxylic acids or other peroxides. The person skilled in the art knows if and in which positions the compound of the formula (I) of the present invention may form N-oxides.\n\nThe preparation of the compound of formula I above may lead to them being obtained as isomer mixtures. If desired, these can be resolved by the methods customary for this purpose, such as crystallization or chromatography, also on optically active adsorbate, to give the pure isomers. Agronomically acceptable salts of the compounds I can be formed in a customary manner, e.g. by reaction with an acid of the anion in question.

Suitable polyelectrolytes are polyacids or polybases. Examples of polyacids are alkali salts of polyacrylic acid or polyacid comb polymers. Examples of polybases are polyvinylamines or pol- yethyleneamines.\n\nSuitable adjuvants are compounds, which have a neglectable or even no pesticidal activity themselves, and which improve the biological performance of the compounds of the present invention on the target. Examples are surfactants, mineral or vegetable oils, and other auxi- laries. Further examples are listed by Knowles, Adjuvants and additives, Agrow Reports DS256, T&F Informa UK, 2006, chapter 5.\n\nSuitable thickeners are polysaccharides (e.g. xanthan gum, carboxymethylcellulose), anorganic clays (organically modified or unmodified), polycarboxylates, and silicates.\n\nSuitable bactericides are bronopol and isothiazolinone derivatives such as alkylisothiazoli- nones and benzisothiazolinones.\n\nSuitable anti-freezing agents are ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, urea and glycerin.\n\nSuitable anti-foaming agents are silicones, long chain alcohols, and salts of fatty acids.\n\nSuitable colorants (e.g. in red, blue, or green) are pigments of low water solubility and water- soluble dyes. Examples are inorganic colorants (e.g. iron oxide, titan oxide, iron hexacyanofer- rate) and organic colorants (e.g. alizarin-, azo- and phthalocyanine colorants).\n\nSuitable tackifiers or binders are polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinylacetates, polyvinyl alcohols, polyacrylates, biological or synthetic waxes, and cellulose ethers.\n\nThe agrochemical compositions generally comprise between 0.01 and 95%, preferably be- tween 0.1 and 90%, and most preferably between 0.5 and 75%, by weight of active sub-stance. The active substances are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably from 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum).\n\nVarious types of oils, wetters, adjuvants, fertilizer, or micronutrients, and other pesticides (e.g. herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, growth regulators, safeners) may be added to the active substances or the compositions cormprising them as premix or, if appropriate not until immediately prior to use (tank mix). These agents can be admixed with the compositions according to the invention in a weight ratio of 1 :100 to 100:1 , preferably 1 :10 to 10:1.\n\nThe user applies the composition according to the invention usually from a predosage de-vice, a knapsack sprayer, a spray tank, a spray plane, or an irrigation system. Usually, the agrochem- ical composition is made up with water, buffer, and/or further auxiliaries to the desired application concentration and the ready-to-use spray liquor or the agrochemical composition according to the invention is thus obtained. Usually, 20 to 2000 liters, preferably 50 to 400 liters, of the ready-to-use spray liquor are applied per hectare of agricultural useful area.\n\nAccording to one embodiment, individual components of the composition according to the in- vention such as parts of a kit or parts of a binary or ternary mixture may be mixed by the user himself in a spray tank and further auxiliaries may be added, if appropriate.\n\nIn a further embodiment, either individual components of the composition according to the invention or partially premixed components, e. g. components comprising compound I of the present invention and/or mixing partners as defined above, may be mixed by the user in a spray tank and further auxiliaries and additives may be added, if appropriate.\n\nIn a further embodiment, either individual components of the composition according to the invention or partially premixed components, e. g. components comprising compound I of the present invention and/or mixing partners as defined above, can be applied jointly (e.g. after tank mix) or consecutively. The compounds of the present invention are suitable for use in protecting crops, plants, plant propagation materials, such as seeds, or soil or water, in which the plants are growing, from attack or infestation by animal pests. Therefore, the present invention also relates to a plant protection method, which comprises contacting crops, plants, plant propagation materials, such as seeds, or soil or water, in which the plants are growing, to be protected from attack or infestation by animal pests, with a pesticidally effective amount of a compound of the present invention.\n\nThe compounds of the present invention are also suitable for use in combating or controlling animal pests. Therefore, the present invention also relates to a method of combating or control- ling animal pests, which comprises contacting the animal pests, their habitat, breeding ground, or food supply, or the crops, plants, plant propagation materials, such as seeds, or soil, or the area, material or environment in which the animal pests are growing or may grow, with a pesticidally effective amount of a compound of the present invention.\n\nThe compounds of the present invention are effective through both contact and ingestion. Fur- thermore, the compounds of the present invention can be applied to any and all developmental stages, such as egg, larva, pupa, and adult.\n\nThe compounds of the present invention can be applied as such or in form of compositions comprising them as defined above. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention can be applied together with a mixing partner as defined above or in form of compositions compris- ing said mixtures as defined above. The components of said mixture can be applied simultaneously, jointly or separately, or in succession, that is immediately one after another and thereby creating the mixture \"in situ\" on the desired location, e.g. the plant, the sequence, in the case of separate application, generally not having any effect on the result of the control measures. The application can be carried out both before and after the infestation of the crops, plants, plant propagation materials, such as seeds, soil, or the area, material or environment by the pests.\n\nSuitable application methods include inter alia soil treatment, seed treatment, in furrow application, and foliar application. Soil treatment methods include drenching the soil, drip irrigation (drip application onto the soil), dipping roots, tubers or bulbs, or soil injection. Seed treatment techniques include seed dressing, seed coating, seed dusting, seed soaking, and seed pelleting. In furrow applications typically include the steps of making a furrow in cultivated land, seeding the furrow with seeds, applying the pesticidally active compound to the furrow, and closing the furrow. Foliar application refers to the application of the pesticidally active compound to plant foliage, e.g. through spray equipment. For foliar applications, it can be advantageous to modify the behavior of the pests by use of pheromones in combination with the compounds of the present invention. Suitable pheromones for specific crops and pests are known to a skilled person and publicly available from databases of pheromones and semiochemicals, such as http://www.pherobase.com.\n\nAs used herein, the term \"contacting\" includes both direct contact (applying the com- pounds/compositions directly on the animal pest or plant - typically to the foliage, stem or roots of the plant) and indirect contact (applying the compounds/compositions to the locus, i.e. habitat, breeding ground, plant, seed, soil, area, material or environment in which a pest is growing or may grow, of the animal pest or plant).\n\nThe term \"animal pest\" includes arthropods, gastropods, and nematodes. Preferred animal pests according to the invention are arthropods, preferably insects and arachnids, in particular insects. Insects, which are of particular relevance for crops, are typically referred to as crop insect pests.\n\nThe term \"crop\" refers to both, growing and harvested crops.\n\nThe term \"plant\" includes in particular cultivated plants, such as cereal, root crops, oil crops, vegetables, spices, ornamentals, fruit trees, citrus crop and nuts for example seed of durum and other wheat, barley, oats, rye, maize (fodder maize and sugar maize / sweet and field corn), soybeans, oil crops, crucifers, cotton, sunflowers, bananas, rice, oilseed rape, turnip rape, sug- arbeet, fodder beet, eggplants, potatoes, grass, lawn, turf, fodder grass, tomatoes, leeks, pumpkin/squash, cabbage, iceberg lettuce, tea, pepper, cucumbers, melons, Brassica species, beans, peas, garlic, onions, carrots, tuberous plants such as potatoes, sugar cane, tobacco, grapes, apple, pear, peach, nectarine, oranges, mandarins, lemons, almonds, walnuts, pistachios, petunias, geranium/pelargoniums, pansies and impatiens, and grasses for animal feed or ornamental uses.\n\nThe term \"cultivated plant\" is to be understood as including plants, which have been modified by either conventional breeding, or mutagenesis or genetic engineering, or by a combination thereof. Plants, which have been modified by mutagenesis or genetic engineering, and are of particular commercial importance, include alfalfa, rapeseed (e.g. oilseed rape), bean, carnation, chicory, cotton, eggplant, eucalyptus, flax, lentil, maize, melon, papaya, petunia, plum, poplar, potato, rice, soybean, squash, sugarbeet, sugarcane, sunflower, sweet pepper, tobacco, tomato, and cereals (e.g. wheat), in particular maize, soybean, cotton, wheat, and rice.\n\nIn plants, which have been modified by mutagenesis or genetic engineering, one or more genes have been mutagenized or integrated in the genetic material of the plant. The one or more mutagenized or integrated genes are preferably selected from pat, epsps, crylAb, bar, cry1 Fa2, cry1 Ac, cry34Ab1 , cry35AB1 , cry3A, cryF, cry1 F, mcry3a, cry2Ab2, cry3Bb1 , cry1A.105, dfr, barnase, vip3Aa20, barstar, als, bxn, bp40, asnl , and ppo5. The mutagenesis or integration of the one or more genes is performed in order to improve certain properties of the plant. Such properties, also known as traits, include abiotic stress tolerance, altered\n\ngrowth/yield, disease resistance, herbicide tolerance, insect resistance, modified product quali- ty, and pollination control. Of these properties, herbicide tolerance, e.g. imidazolinone tolerance, glyphosate tolerance, or glufosinate tolerance, is of particular importance. Several plants have been rendered tolerant to herbicides by mutagenesis, for example ClearfieldÂ® oilseed rape being tolerant to imidazolinones, e.g. imazamox. Alternatively, genetic engineering methods have been used to render plants, such as soybean, cotton, corn, beets and oil seed rape, tolerant to herbicides, such as glyphosate and glufosinate, some of which are commercially available under the trade names RoundupReadyÂ® (glyphosate) and LibertyLinkÂ® (glufosinate). Furthermore, insect resistance is of importance, in particular lepidopteran insect resistance and coleop- teran insect resistance. Insect resistance is typically achieved by modifying plants by integrating cry and/or vip genes, which were isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), and code for the re- spective Bt toxins. Genetically modified plants with insect resistance are commercially available under trade names including WideStrikeÂ®, BollgardÂ®, AgrisureÂ®, HerculexÂ®, YieldGardÂ®, GenuityÂ®, and IntactaÂ®. Plants may be modified by mutagenesis or genetic engineering either in terms of one property (singular traits) or in terms of a combination of properties (stacked traits). Stacked traits, e.g. the combination of herbicide tolerance and insect resistance, are of increas- ing importance. In general, all relevant modified plants in connection with singular or stacked traits as well as detailed information as to the mutagenized or integrated genes and the respective events are available from websites of the organizations \"International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA)\" (http://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase) and \"Center for Environmental Risk Assessment (CERA)\" (http://cera-gmc.org/GMCropDatabase). The term \"plant propagation material\" refers to all the generative parts of the plant such as seeds and vegetative plant material such as cuttings and tubers (e. g. potatoes), which can be used for the multiplication of the plant. This includes seeds, roots, fruits, tubers, bulbs, rhizomes, shoots, sprouts and other parts of plants. Seedlings and young plants, which are to be transplanted after germination or after emergence from soil, may also be included. These plant propagation materials may be treated prophylactically with a plant protection compound either at or before planting or transplanting.\n\nThe term \"seed\" embraces seeds and plant propagules of all kinds including but not limited to true seeds, seed pieces, suckers, corms, bulbs, fruit, tubers, grains, cuttings, cut shoots and the like, and means in a preferred embodiment true seeds.\n\nIn general, \"pesticidally effective amount\" means the amount of active ingredient needed to achieve an observable effect on growth, including the effects of necrosis, death, retardation, prevention, and removal, destruction, or otherwise diminishing the occurrence and activity of the target organism. The pesticidally effective amount can vary for the various com- pounds/compositions used in the invention. A pesticidally effective amount of the compositions will also vary according to the prevailing conditions such as desired pesticidal effect and duration, weather, target species, locus, mode of application, and the like.\n\nIn the case of soil treatment, in furrow application or of application to the pests dwelling place or nest, the quantity of active ingredient ranges from 0.0001 to 500 g per 100 m2, preferably from 0.001 to 20 g per 100 m2.\n\nFor use in treating crop plants, e.g. by foliar application, the rate of application of the active ingredients of this invention may be in the range of 0.0001 g to 4000 g per hectare, e.g. from 1 g to 2 kg per hectare or from 1 g to 750 g per hectare, desirably from 1 g to 100 g per hectare, more desirably from 10 g to 50 g per hectare, e.g., 10 to 20 g per hectare, 20 to 30 g per hec- tare, 30 to 40 g per hectare, or 40 to 50 g per hectare.\n\nThe compounds of the present invention are particularly suitable for use in the treatment of seeds in order to protect the seeds from insect pests, in particular from soil-living insect pests, and the resulting seedling's roots and shoots against soil pests and foliar insects. The present invention therefore also relates to a method for the protection of seeds from insects, in particular from soil insects, and of the seedling's roots and shoots from insects, in particular from soil and foliar insects, said method comprising treating the seeds before sowing and/or after pregermina- tion with a compound of the present invention. The protection of the seedling's roots and shoots is preferred. More preferred is the protection of seedling's shoots from piercing and sucking insects, chewing insects and nematodes.\n\nThe term \"seed treatment\" comprises all suitable seed treatment techniques known in the art, such as seed dressing, seed coating, seed dusting, seed soaking, seed pelleting, and in-furrow application methods. Preferably, the seed treatment application of the active compound is carried out by spraying or by dusting the seeds before sowing of the plants and before emergence of the plants. The present invention also comprises seeds coated with or containing the active compound. The term \"coated with and/or containing\" generally signifies that the active ingredient is for the most part on the surface of the propagation product at the time of application, although a greater or lesser part of the ingredient may penetrate into the propagation product, depending on the method of application. When the said propagation product is (re)planted, it may absorb the active ingredient.\n\nSuitable seed is seed of cereals, root crops, oil crops, vegetables, spices, ornamentals, for example seed of durum and other wheat, barley, oats, rye, maize (fodder maize and sugar maize / sweet and field corn), soybeans, oil crops, crucifers, cotton, sunflowers, bananas, rice, oilseed rape, turnip rape, sugarbeet, fodder beet, eggplants, potatoes, grass, lawn, turf, fodder grass, tomatoes, leeks, pumpkin/squash, cabbage, iceberg lettuce, pepper, cucumbers, melons, Bras- sica species, melons, beans, peas, garlic, onions, carrots, tuberous plants such as potatoes, sugar cane, tobacco, grapes, petunias, geranium/pelargoniums, pansies and impatiens.\n\nIn addition, the active compound may also be used for the treatment of seeds from genetically modified plants, which e.g. tolerate the action of herbicides or fungicides or insecticides owing to breeding, including genetic engineering methods. Such genetically modified plants have been described in detail above.\n\nConventional seed treatment formulations include for example flowable concentrates FS, solutions LS, suspoemulsions (SE), powders for dry treatment DS, water dispersible powders for slurry treatment WS, water-soluble powders SS and emulsion ES and EC and gel formulation GF. These formulations can be applied to the seed diluted or undiluted. Application to the seeds is carried out before sowing, either directly on the seeds or after having pregerminated the latter. Preferably, the formulations are applied such that germination is not included.\n\nThe active substance concentrations in ready-to-use formulations, which may be obtained af- ter two-to-tenfold dilution, are preferably from 0.01 to 60% by weight, more preferably from 0.1 to 40 % by weight.\n\nIn a preferred embodiment a FS formulation is used for seed treatment. Typically, a FS formulation may comprise 1 -800 g/l of active ingredient, 1 -200 g/l Surfactant, 0 to 200 g/l antifreezing agent, 0 to 400 g/l of binder, 0 to 200 g/l of a pigment and up to 1 liter of a solvent, preferably water.\n\nEspecially preferred FS formulations of the compounds of the present invention for seed treatment usually comprise from 0.1 to 80% by weight (1 to 800 g/l) of the active ingredient, from 0.1 to 20 % by weight (1 to 200 g/l) of at least one surfactant, e.g. 0.05 to 5 % by weight of a wetter and from 0.5 to 15 % by weight of a dispersing agent, up to 20 % by weight, e.g. from 5 to 20 % of an anti-freeze agent, from 0 to 15 % by weight, e.g. 1 to 15 % by weight of a pigment and/or a dye, from 0 to 40 % by weight, e.g. 1 to 40 % by weight of a binder (sticker /adhesion agent), optionally up to 5 % by weight, e.g. from 0.1 to 5 % by weight of a thickener, optionally from 0.1 to 2 % of an anti-foam agent, and optionally a preservative such as a biocide, antioxidant or the like, e.g. in an amount from 0.01 to 1 % by weight and a filler/vehicle up to 100 % by weight.\n\nIn the treatment of seed, the application rates of the compounds of the invention are generally from 0.1 g to 10 kg per 100 kg of seed, preferably from 1 g to 5 kg per 100 kg of seed, more preferably from 1 g to 1000 g per 100 kg of seed and in particular from 1 g to 200 g per 100 kg of seed, e.g. from 1 g to 100 g or from 5 g to 100 g per 100 kg of seed. The invention therefore also relates to seed comprising a compound of the present invention, or an agriculturally useful salt thereof, as defined herein. The amount of the compound of the present invention or the agriculturally useful salt thereof will in general vary from 0.1 g to 10 kg per 100 kg of seed, preferably from 1 g to 5 kg per 100 kg of seed, in particular from 1 g to 1000 g per 100 kg of seed. For specific crops such as lettuce the rate can be higher.\n\nThe compounds of the present invention may also be used for improving the health of a plant. Therefore, the present invention also relates to a method for improving plant health by treating a plant, plant propagation material and/or the locus where the plant is growing or is to grow with an effective and non-phytotoxic amount of a compound of the present invention.\n\nAs used herein \"an effective and non-phytotoxic amount\" means that the compound is used in a quantity which allows to obtain the desired effect but which does not give rise to any phytotox- ic symptom on the treated plant or on the plant grown from the treated propagule or treated soil.\n\nThe terms \"plant\" and \"plant propagation material\" are defined above.\n\n\"Plant health\" is defined as a condition of the plant and/or its products which is determined by several aspects alone or in combination with each other such as yield (for example increased biomass and/or increased content of valuable ingredients), quality (for example improved content or composition of certain ingredients or shelf life), plant vigour (for example improved plant growth and/or greener leaves (\"greening effect\"), tolerance to abiotic (for example drought) and/or biotic stress (for example disease) and production efficiency (for example, harvesting efficiency, processability).\n\nThe above identified indicators for the health condition of a plant may be interdependent and may result from each other. Each indicator is defined in the art and can be determined by methods known to a skilled person.\n\nPests\n\nThe compounds of the the present invention are especially suitable for efficiently combating animal pests such as arthropods, gastropods and nematodes including but not limited to:\n\ninsects from the order of Lepidoptera, for example Achroia grisella, Acleris spp. such as A. fimbriana, A. gloverana, A. variana; Acrolepiopsis assectella, Acronicta major, Adoxophyes spp. such as A. cyrtosema, A. orana; Aedia leucomelas, Agrotis spp. such as A. exclamationis, A. fucosa, A. ipsilon, A. orthogoma, A. segetum, A. subterranea; Alabama argillacea, Aleurodicus dispersus, Alsophila pometaria, Ampelophaga rubiginosa, Amyelois transitella, Anacampsis sarcitella, Anagasta kuehniella, Anarsia lineatella, Anisota senatoria, Antheraea pernyi, Anticar- sia (=Thermesia) spp. such as A. gemmatalis; Apamea spp., Aproaerema modicella, Archips spp. such as A. argyrospila, A. fuscocupreanus, A. rosana, A. xyloseanus; Argyresthia conjugel- la, Argyroploce spp., Argyrotaenia spp. such as A. velutinana; Athetis mindara, Austroasca vi- ridigrisea, Autographa gamma, Autographa nigrisigna, Barathra brassicae, Bedellia spp., Bon- agota salubricola, Borbo cinnara, Bucculatrix thurberiella, Bupalus piniarius, Busseola spp., Cacoecia spp. such as C. murinana, C. podana; Cactoblastis cactorum, Cadra cautella, Calingo braziliensis, Caloptilis theivora, Capua reticulana, Carposina spp. such as C. niponensis, C. sasakii; Cephus spp., Chaetocnema aridula, Cheimatobia brumata, Chilo spp. such as C.

In a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of controlling harmful insects and/or increasing the health of a cultivated plant, in particular the yield of a cultivated plant, by treating plant propagation material, preferably seeds with the compound of formula I and its mixtures.\n\nThe present invention also comprises plant propagation material, preferably seed, of a cultivat- ed plant treated with the compound of formula I and its mixtures.\n\nIn another preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of controlling harmful insects and/or increasing the health of a cultivated plant, in particular the yield of a cultivated plant by treating the cultivated plant, part(s) of such plant or at its locus of growth with the com- pound of formula I and its mixtures.\n\nThe term cultivated plant(s) includes \"modified plant(s)\" and \"transgenic plant(s)\".\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, the term \"cultivated plants\" refers to \"modified plants\". In one embodiment of the invention, the term \"cultivated plants\" refers to \"transgenic plants\". \"Mod- ified plants\" are those which have been modified by conventional breeding techniques. The term \"modification\" means in relation to modified plants a change in the genome, epigenome, tran- scriptome or proteome of the modified plant, as compared to the control, wild type, mother or parent plant whereby the modification confers a trait (or more than one trait) or confers the increase of a trait (or more than one trait) as listed below.\n\nThe modification may result in the modified plant to be a different, for example a new plant variety than the parental plant.\n\n\"Transgenic plants\" are those, which genetic material has been modified by the use of recombinant DNA techniques that under natural circumstances can not readily be obtained by cross breeding, mutations or natural recombination, whereby the modification confers a trait (or more than one trait) or confers the increase of a trait (or more than one trait) as listed below as compared to the wild-type plant.\n\nIn one embodiment, one or more genes have been integrated into the genetic material of a genetically modified plant in order to improve certain properties of the plant, preferably increase a trait as listed below as compared to the wild-type plant. Such genetic modifications also include but are not limited to targeted post-translational modification of protein(s), or to post- transcriptional modifications of oligo- or polypeptides e.g. by glycosylation or polymer additions such as prenylated, acetylated, phosphorylated or farnesylated moieties or PEG moieties.\n\nIn one embodiment under the term \"modification\" when referring to a transgenic plant or parts thereof is understood that the activity, expression level or amount of a gene product or the metabolite content is changed, e.g. increased or decreased, in a specific volume relative to a corresponding volume of a control, reference or wild-type plant or plant cell, including the de novo creation of the activity or expression.\n\nIn one embodiment the activity of a polypeptide is increased or generated by expression or overexpresion of the gene coding for said polypeptide which confers a trait or confers the increase of a trait as listed below as compared to the control plant. The term \"expression\" or \"gene expression\" means the transcription of a specific gene or specific genes or specific genetic construct. The term \"expression\" or \"gene expression\" in particular means the transcription of a gene or genes or genetic construct into structural RNA (rRNA, tRNA), regulatory RNA (e.g. miRNA, RNAi, RNAa) or mRNA with or without subsequent translation of the latter into a protein. In another embodiment the term \"expression\" or \"gene expression\" in particular means the transcription of a gene or genes or genetic construct into structural RNA (rRNA, tRNA) or mRNA with or without subsequent translation of the latter into a protein. In yet another embodiment it means the transcription of a gene or genes or genetic construct into mRNA.\n\nThe process includes transcription of DNA and processing of the resulting mRNA product. The term \"increased expression\" or \"overexpression\" as used herein means any form of expression that is additional to the original wild-type expression level.\n\nThe term \"expression of a polypeptide\" is understood in one embodiment to mean the level of said protein or polypeptide, preferably in an active form, in a cell or organism.\n\nIn one embodiment the activity of a polypeptide is decreased by decreased expression of the gene coding for said polypeptide which confers a trait or confers the increase of a trait as listed below as compared to the control plant. Reference herein to \"decreased expression\" or \"reduc- tion or substantial elimination\" of expression is taken to mean a decrease in endogenous gene expression and/or polypeptide levels and/or polypeptide activity relative to control plants. It comprises further reducing, repressing, decreasing or deleting of an expression product of a nucleic acid molecule.\n\nThe terms \"reduction\", \"repression\", \"decrease\" or \"deletion\" relate to a corresponding change of a property in an organism, a part of an organism such as a tissue, seed, root, tuber, fruit, leave, flower etc. or in a cell. Under \"change of a property\" it is understood that the activity, expression level or amount of a gene product or the metabolite content is changed in a specific volume or in a specific amount of protein relative to a corresponding volume or amount of protein of a control, reference or wild type. Preferably, the overall activity in the volume is reduced, decreased or deleted in cases if the reduction, decrease or deletion is related to the reduction, decrease or deletion of an activity of a gene product, independent whether the amount of gene product or the specific activity of the gene product or both is reduced, decreased or deleted or whether the amount, stability or translation efficacy of the nucleic acid sequence or gene encoding for the gene product is reduced, decreased or deleted. The terms \"reduction\", \"repression\", \"decrease\" or \"deletion\" include the change of said property in only parts of the subject of the present invention, for example, the modification can be found in compartment of a cell, like an organelle, or in a part of a plant, like tissue, seed, root, leave, tuber, fruit, flower etc. but is not detectable if the overall subject, i.e. complete cell or plant, is tested. Preferably, the \"reduction\", \"repression\", \"decrease\" or \"deletion\" is found cellular, thus the term \"reduction, decrease or deletion of an activity\" or \"reduction, decrease or deletion of a metabolite content\" relates to the cellular reduction, decrease or deletion compared to the wild type cell. In addition the terms \"reduction\", \"repression\", \"decrease\" or \"deletion\" include the change of said property only during different growth phases of the organism used in the inventive process, for example the reduction, repression, decrease or deletion takes place only during the seed growth or during blooming. Furthermore the terms include a transitional reduction, decrease or deletion for example because the used method, e.g. the antisense, RNAi, snRNA, dsRNA, siRNA, miRNA, ta-siRNA, cosuppression molecule, or ribozyme, is not stable integrated in the genome of the organism or the reduction, decrease, repression or deletion is under control of a regulatory or inducible element, e.g. a chemical or otherwise inducible pro- moter, and has therefore only a transient effect.\n\nMethods to achieve said reduction, decrease or deletion in an expression product are known in the art, for example from the international patent application WO 2008/034648, particularly in paragraphs [0020.1 .1.1], [0040.1 .1.1], [0040.2.1 .1] and [0041 .1 .1.1].\n\nReducing, repressing, decreasing or deleting of an expression product of a nucleic acid molecule in modified plants is known. Examples are canola i.e. double nill oilseed rape with reduced amounts of erucic acid and sinapins.\n\nSuch a decrease can also be achieved for example by the use of recombinant DNA technology, such as antisense or regulatory RNA (e.g. miRNA, RNAi, RNAa) or siRNA approaches. In particular RNAi, snRNA, dsRNA, siRNA, miRNA, ta-siRNA, cosuppression molecule, ribozyme, or antisense nucleic acid molecule, a nucleic acid molecule conferring the expression of a dominant-negative mutant of a protein or a nucleic acid construct capable to recombine with and silence, inactivate, repress or reduces the activity of an endogenous gene may be used to decrease the activity of a polypeptide in a transgenic plant or parts thereof or a plant cell thereof used in one embodiment of the methods of the invention. Examples of transgenic plants with reduced, repressed, decreased or deleted expression product of a nucleic acid molecule are Carica papaya (Papaya plants) with the event name X17-2 of the University of Florida, Prunus domestica (Plum) with the event name C5 of the United States Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service, or those listed in rows T9-48 and T9-49 of table 9 below. Also known are plants with increased resistance to nematodes for example by reducing, repressing, decreasing or deleting of an expression product of a nucleic acid molecule, e.g. from the PCT publication WO 2008/095886. The reduction or substantial elimination is in increasing order of preference at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% or 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more reduced compared to that of control plants. Reference herein to an \"endogenous\" gene not only refers to the gene in question as found in a plant in its natural form (i.e., without there being any human intervention), but also refers to that same gene (or a substantially homologous nucleic ac- id/gene) in an isolated form subsequently (re)introduced into a plant (a transgene). For example, a transgenic plant containing such a transgene may encounter a substantial reduction of the transgene expression and/or substantial reduction of expression of the endogenous gene.\n\nThe terms \"control\" or \"reference\" are exchangeable and can be a cell or a part of a plant such as an organelle like a chloroplast or a tissue, in particular a plant, which was not modified or treated according to the herein described process according to the invention. Accordingly, the plant used as control or reference corresponds to the plant as much as possible and is as identical to the subject matter of the invention as possible. Thus, the control or reference is treated identically or as identical as possible, saying that only conditions or properties might be different which do not influence the quality of the tested property other than the treatment of the present invention.\n\nIt is possible that control or reference plants are wild-type plants. However, \"control\" or \"reference\" may refer to plants carrying at least one genetic modification, when the plants employed in the process of the present invention carry at least one genetic modification more than said control or reference plants. In one embodiment control or reference plants may be transgenic but differ from transgenic plants employed in the process of the present invention only by said modification contained in the transgenic plants employed in the process of the present invention. The term \"wild type\" or \"wild-type plants\" refers to a plant without said genetic modification. These terms can refer to a cell or a part of a plant such as an organelle like a chloroplast or a tissue, in particular a plant, which lacks said genetic modification but is otherwise as identical as possible to the plants with at least one genetic modification employed in the present invention. In a particular embodiment the \"wild-type\" plant is not transgenic.\n\nPreferably, the wild type is identically treated according to the herein described process according to the invention. The person skilled in the art will recognize if wild-type plants will not require certain treatments in advance to the process of the present invention, e.g. non-transgenic wild- type plants will not need selection for transgenic plants for example by treatment with a select- ing agent such as a herbicide.\n\nThe control plant may also be a nullizygote of the plant to be assessed. The term \"nullizygotes\" refers to a plant that has undergone the same production process as a transgenic, yet has lost the once aquired genetic modification (e.g. due to mendelian segregation)as the corresponding transgenic. If the starting material of said production process is transgenic, then nullizygotes are also transgenic but lack the additional genetic modification introduced by the production process. In the process of the present invention the purpose of wild-type and nullizygotes is the same as the one for control and reference or parts thereof. All of these serve as controls in any comparison to provide evidence of the advantageous effect of the present invention.\n\nPreferably, any comparison is carried out under analogous conditions. The term \"analogous conditions\" means that all conditions such as, for example, culture or growing conditions, soil, nutrient, water content of the soil, temperature, humidity or surrounding air or soil, assay conditions (such as buffer composition, temperature, substrates, pathogen strain, concentrations and the like) are kept identical between the experiments to be compared. The person skilled in the art will recognize if wild-type, control or reference plants will not require certain treatments in advance to the process of the present invention, e.g. non-transgenic wild-type plants will not need selection for transgenic plants for example by treatment with herbicide.\n\nIn case that the conditions are not analogous the results can be normalized or standardized based on the control.\n\nThe \"reference\", \"control\", or \"wild type\" is preferably a plant, which was not modified or treated according to the herein described process of the invention and is in any other property as similar to a plant, employed in the process of the present invention of the invention as possible. The reference, control or wild type is in its genome, transcriptome, proteome or metabolome as similar as possible to a plant, employed in the process of the present invention of the present invention. Preferably, the term \"reference-\" \"control-\" or \"wild-type-\" plant, relates to a plant, which is nearly genetically identical to the organelle, cell, tissue or organism, in particular plant, of the present invention or a part thereof preferably 90% or more, e.g. 95%, more preferred are 98%, even more preferred are 99,00%, in particular 99,10%, 99,30%, 99,50%, 99,70%, 99,90%, 99,99%, 99,999% or more. Most preferable the \"reference\", \"control\", or \"wild type\" is a plant, which is genetically identical to the plant, cell, a tissue or organelle used according to the pro- cess of the invention except that the responsible or activity conferring nucleic acid molecules or the gene product encoded by them have been amended, manipulated, exchanged or introduced in the organelle, cell, tissue, plant, employed in the process of the present invention. Preferably, the reference and the subject matter of the invention are compared after standardization and normalization, e.g. to the amount of total RNA, DNA, or protein or activity or expression of reference genes, like housekeeping genes, such as ubiquitin, actin or ribosomal proteins.\n\nThe genetic modification carried in the organelle, cell, tissue, in particular plant used in the process of the present invention is in one embodiment stable e.g. due to a stable transgenic integration or to a stable mutation in the corresponding endogenous gene or to a modulation of the expression or of the behaviour of a gene, or transient, e.g. due to an transient transformation or temporary addition of a modulator such as an agonist or antagonist or inducible, e.g. after trans- formation with a inducible construct carrying a nucleic acid molecule under control of a inducible promoter and adding the inducer, e.g. tetracycline.\n\nIn some embodiments, the invention relates to methods and uses, wherein a compound of fomula IA as defined herein, is applied in an application type which corresponds in each case to one row of Table AP-T.\n\nIn some embodiments, the invention relates to methods and uses, wherein a compound selected from the compounds of Table A, A' or A\", is applied in an application type which corresponds in each case to one row of Table AP-T.\n\nAlso preferred is the application of the compounds and mixtures according to the invention, es- pecially the compounds as individualized herein, e.g. in Table A, A', or A\", on specialty crops like fruits and vegetables. In one embodiment thereof, the application is on fruiting vegetables, and especially on tomato, on pepper or on eggplant. In another embodiment thereof, the application is on leafy vegetables, and especially on cabbage or on lettuce. In still another embodiment thereof, the application is on tubers (tuber vegetables), and especially on potato or on on- ion.\n\nIn one embodiment, in the methods and uses according to the invention, the following application types are used:\n\n(Abbreviations: SPC = specialty crops; SPC-FV = fruiting vegetable; SPC-LV = leafy vegetable; SPC-T: tubers; ST = seed treatment)\n\nTable AP-T\n\nAppl. type Crop Pest\n\nAP-T-1 Soybeans Spodoptera littoralis\n\nAP-T-2 Soybeans Anticarsia gemmatalis\n\nAP-T-3 Soybeans Spodoptera exigua\n\nAP-T-4 Soybeans Stinkbug\n\nAP-T-5 Soybeans Helicoverpa sp.\n\nAP-T-6 Soybeans Spodoptera eridania\n\nAP-T-7 Corn Spodoptera Frugiperta\n\nAP-T-8 Corn Spodoptera exigua\n\nAP-T-9 Rice Sesamia inferens\n\nAP-T-10 Rice Cnaphalocerus medinalis Appl. type Crop Pest\n\nAP-T-1 1 Rice Chilo suppressalis\n\nAP-T-12 Rice Leptocorisa oratorius\n\nAP-T-13 Rice Brown plant hopper\n\nAP-T-14 Cotton Spodoptera littoralis\n\nAP-T-15 Cotton Thrips spp.\n\nAP-T-16 Cotton Spodoptera eridania\n\nAP-T-17 Cotton Helicoverpa sp.\n\nThe cultivated plants are plants, which comprise at least one trait. The term \"trait\" refers to a property, which is present in the plant either by genetic engineering or by conventional breeding techniques. Each trait has to be assessed in relation to its respective control. Examples of traits are:\n\nâ¢ herbicide tolerance,\n\nâ¢ insect resistance by expression of bacterial toxins,\n\nâ¢ fungal resistance or viral resistance or bacterial resistance,\n\nâ¢ antibiotic resistance,\n\nÂ· stress tolerance,\n\nâ¢ maturation alteration,\n\nâ¢ content modification of chemicals present in the cultivated plant, preferably increasing the content of fine chemicals advantageous for applications in the field of the food and/or feed industry, the cosmetics industry and/or the pharmaceutical industry,\n\nÂ· modified nutrient uptake, preferably an increased nutrient use efficiency and/or resistance to conditions of nutrient deficiency,\n\nâ¢ improved fiber quality,\n\nâ¢ plant vigor,\n\nâ¢ modified colour,\n\nÂ· fertility restoration,\n\nand male sterility.\n\nPrincipally, cultivated plants may also comprise combinations of the aforementioned traits, e.g. they may be tolerant to the action of herbicides and express bacterial toxins.\n\nPrincipally, all cultivated plants may also provide combinations of the aforementioned properties, e.g. they may be tolerant to the action of herbicides and express bacterial toxins.\n\nIn the detailed description below, the term \"plant\" refers to a cultivated plant.\n\nTolerance to herbicides can be obtained by creating insensitivity at the site of action of the herb- icide by expression of a target enzyme which is resistant to herbicide; rapid metabolism (conjugation or degradation) of the herbicide by expression of enzymes which inactivate herbicide; or poor uptake and translocation of the herbicide. Examples are the expression of enzymes which are tolerant to the herbicide in comparison to wild type enzymes, such as the expression of 5- enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), which is tolerant to glyphosate (see e.g. Heck et.al, Crop Sci. 45, 2005, 329-339; Funke et.al, PNAS 103, 2006, 13010-13015; US 5188642, US 4940835, US 5633435, US 5804425, US 5627061 ), the expression of glutamine synthase which is tolerant to glufosinate and bialaphos (see e.g. US 5646024, US 5561236) and DNA constructs coding for dicamba-degrading enzymes (see e.g. US 7105724). Gene constructs can be obtained, for example, from micro-organism or plants, which are tolerant to said herbicides, such as the Agrobacterium strain CP4 EPSPS which is resistant to glyphosate; Streptomyces bacteria which are resistance to glufosinate; Arabidopsis, Daucus carota, Pseu- domonoas spp. or Zea mais with chimeric gene sequences coding for HDDP (see e.g. WO 1996/38567, WO 2004/55191 ); Arabidopsis thaliana which is resistant to protox inhibitors (see e.g. US 2002/0073443).\n\nTolerance to glyphosate can also be achieved by any one of the genes 2mepsps, epsps, gat4601 , goxv247 or mepsps.\n\nTolerance to glufosinate can be achieved by any one of the genes bar, pat or pat(syn).\n\nPreferaby, the herbicide tolerant plant can be selected from cereals such as wheat, barley, rye, oat; canola, sorghum, soybean, rice, oil seed rape, sugar beet, sugarcane, grapes, lentils, sun- flowers, alfalfa, pome fruits; stone fruits; peanuts; coffee; tea; strawberries; turf; vegetables, such as tomatoes, potatoes, cucurbits and lettuce, more preferably, the plant is selected from soybean, maize (corn), rice, cotton, oilseed rape in particular canola, tomatoes, potatoes, sugarcane, vine, apple, pear, citron, orange and cereals such as wheat, barley, rye and oat. More preferably, the cultivated plant is selected from the group consisting of Gossypium hirsutum L. (cotton), Zea mays L. (maize), Glycine max L. (soybean), Triticum aestivum (wheat), and Oryza sativa L. (rice), preferably from the group consisting of Gossypium hirsutum L. (cotton), Zea mays L. (maize) and Glycine max L. (soybean). Particularly preferably, the cultivated plant is Glycine max L. (soybean). Examples of commercial available transgenic plants with tolerance to herbicides, are the corn varieties \"Roundup Ready Corn\", \"Roundup Ready 2\" (Monsanto), \"Agrisure GT\", \"Agrisure GT/CB/LL\", \"Agrisure GT/RW\",âAgrisure 3000GT\" (Syngenta), \"YieldGard VT Rootworm/RR2\" and \"YieldGard VT Triple\" (Monsanto) with tolerance to glyphosate; the corn varieties \"Liberty Link\" (Bayer), \"Herculex I\", \"Herculex RW\", \"Herculex Xtra\"(Dow, Pioneer), \"Agrisure GT/CB/LL\" and \"Agrisure CB/LL/RW\" (Syngenta) with tolerance to glufosinate; the soybean varieties\n\n\"Roundup Ready Soybean\" (Monsanto) and \"Optimum GAT\" (DuPont, Pioneer) with tolerance to glyphosate; the cotton varieties \"Roundup Ready Cotton\" and \"Roundup Ready Flex\" (Monsanto) with tolerance to glyphosate; the cotton variety \"FiberMax Liberty Link\" (Bayer) with tolerance to glufosinate; the cotton variety \"BXN\" (Calgene) with tolerance to bromoxynil; the canola varieties ..Navigator\" und ..Compass\" (Rhone-Poulenc) with bromoxynil tolerance; the canola varierty\"Roundup Ready Canola\" (Monsanto) with glyphosate tolerance; the canola variety \"InVigor\" (Bayer) with glufosinate tolerance; the rice variety \"Liberty Link Rice\" (Bayer) with glulfosinate tolerance and the alfalfa variety \"Roundup Ready Alfalfa\" with glyphosate tolerance. Further transgenic plants with herbicide tolerance are commonly known, for instance alfalfa, apple, eucalyptus, flax, grape, lentils, oil seed rape, peas, potato, rice, sugar beet, sunflower, tobacco, tomatom turf grass and wheat with tolerance to glyphosate (see e.g. US 5188642, US 4940835, US 5633435, US 5804425, US 5627061 ); beans, soybean, cotton, peas, potato, sunflower, tomato, tobacco, corn, sorghum and sugarcane with tolerance to dicamba (see e.g. US 7105724 and US 5670454); pepper, apple, tomato, millet, sunflower, tobacco, potato, corn, cu- cumber, wheat and sorghum with tolerance to 2,4-D (see e.g. US 6153401 , US 6100446, WO 2005107437, US 5608147 and US 5670454); sugarbeet, potato, tomato and tobacco with tolerance to glufosinate (see e.g. US 5646024, US 5561236); canola, barley, cotton, lettuce, melon, millet, oats, potato, rice, rye, sorghum, soybean, sugarbeet, sunflower, tobacco, tomato and wheat with tolerance to acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibiting herbicides, such as triazolopyrim- idine sulfonamides, sulfonylureas and imidazolinones (see e.g. US 5013659, WO 2006060634, US 4761373, US 5304732, US 621 1438, US 621 1439 and US 6222100); cereals, sugar cane, rice, corn, tobacco, soybean, cotton, rapeseed, sugar beet and potato with tolerance to HPPD inhibitor herbicides (see e.g. WO 2004/055191 , WO 199638567, WO 1997049816 and US 6791014); wheat, soybean, cotton, sugar beet, rape, rice, sorghum and sugar cane with tolerance to protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) inhibitor herbicides (see e.g. US 2002/0073443, US 20080052798, Pest Management Science, 61 , 2005, 277-285). The methods of producing such transgenic plants are generally known to the person skilled in the art and are described, for example, in the publications mentioned above.\n\nPlants, which are capable of synthesising one or more selectively acting bacterial toxins, comprise for example at least one toxin from toxin-producing bacteria, especially those of the genus Bacillus, in particular plants capable of synthesising one or more insecticidal proteins from Bacillus cereus or Bacillus popliae; or insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis, such as del- ta.-endotoxins, e.g. CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CrylF, CrylF(a2), CryllA(b), CrylllA, CrylllB(bl ) or Cry9c, or vegetative insecticidal proteins (VIP), e.g. VIP1 , VIP2, VIP3 or VIP3A; or insecticidal proteins of bacteria colonising nematodes, for example Photorhabdus spp. or Xenorhabdus spp., such as Photorhabdus luminescens, Xenorhabdus nematophilus; toxins produced by animals, such as scorpion toxins, arachnid toxins, wasp toxins and other insect-specific neurotoxins; toxins produced by fungi, such as Streptomycetes toxins, plant lectins, such as pea lectins, barley lectins or snowdrop lectins; agglutinins; proteinase inhibitors, such as trypsine inhibitors, serine protease inhibitors, patatin, cystatin, papain inhibitors; ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIP), such as ricin, maize-RIP, abrin, luffin, saporin or bryodin; steroid metabolism enzymes, such as 3-hydroxysteroidoxidase, ecdysteroid-UDP-glycosyl-transferase, cholesterol oxidases, ecdy- sone inhibitors, HMG-COA-reductase, ion channel blockers, such as blockers of sodium or calcium channels, juvenile hormone esterase, diuretic hormone receptors, stilbene synthase, bibenzyl synthase, chitinases and glucanases.\n\nIn one embodiment a plant is capable of producing a toxin, lectin or inhibitor if it contains at least one cell comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding said toxin, lectin, inhibitor or inhibitor producing enzyme, and said nucleic acid sequence is transcribed and translated and if appropriate the resulting protein processed and/or secreted in a constitutive manner or subject to developmental, inducible or tissue-specific regulation. In the context of the present invention there are to be understood delta. -endotoxins, for example CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CrylF, CrylF(a2), CryllA(b), CrylllA, CrylllB(bl ) or Cry9c, or vegetative insecticidal proteins (VIP), for example VIP1 , VIP2, VIP3 or VIP3A, expressly also hybrid toxins, truncated toxins and modified toxins. Hybrid toxins are produced recombinantly by a new combination of different domains of those proteins (see, for example, WO 02/15701 ). An example for a truncated toxin is a truncated CrylA(b), which is expressed in the Bt1 1 maize from Syngen- ta Seed SAS, as described below. In the case of modified toxins, one or more amino acids of the naturally occurring toxin are replaced. In such amino acid replacements, preferably non- naturally present protease recognition sequences are inserted into the toxin, such as, for exam- pie, in the case of CrylllA055, a cathepsin-D-recognition sequence is inserted into a CrylllA toxin (see WO 2003/018810).\n\nExamples of such toxins or transgenic plants capable of synthesising such toxins are disclosed, for example, in EP-A-0 374 753, WO 93/07278, WO 95/34656, EP-A-0 427 529, EP-A-451 878 and WO 2003/052073.\n\nExamples of genes conferring resistance to coleopteran insects include cry34Ab1 , cry35 Ab1 , cry3A, cry3Bb1 , dvsnf7, and mcry3A.\n\nExamples of genes conferring resistance to lepidopteran insects include cry1A, cry1A.105, crylAb, cry1Ab-Ac, crylAc, cryl C, cryl F, cry1 Fa2, cry2Ab2, cry2Ae, cry9c, mocryl F, pinll, vip3A(a), and vip3Aa20.\n\nThe processes for the preparation of such transgenic plants are generally known to the person skilled in the art and are described, for example, in the publications mentioned above. Cryl-type deoxyribonucleic acids and their preparation are known, for example, from WO 95/34656, EP-A- 0 367 474, EP-A-0 401 979 and WO 1990/13651.\n\nThe toxin contained in the transgenic plants imparts to the plants tolerance to harmful insects. Such insects can occur in any taxonomic group of insects, but are especially commonly found in the beetles (Coleoptera), two-winged insects (Diptera) and butterflies (Lepidoptera).\n\nPreferably, the plant capable of expression of bacterial toxins is selected from cereals such as wheat, barley, rye, oat; canola, cotton, eggplant, lettuce, sorghum, soybean, rice, oil seed rape, sugar beet, sugarcane, grapes, lentils, sunflowers, alfalfa, pome fruits; stone fruits; peanuts; coffee; tea; strawberries; turf; vegetables, such as tomatoes, potatoes, cucurbits and lettuce, more preferably, the plant is selected from cotton, soybean, maize (corn), rice, tomatoes, potatoes, oilseed rape and cereals such as wheat, barley, rye and oat, most preferably from cotton, soybean, maize, vine, apple, pear, citron, orange and cereals such as wheat, barley, rye and oat. More preferably, the cultivated plant is selected from the group consisting of Gossypium hirsutum L. (cotton), Zea mays L. (maize), Glycine max L. (soybean), Triticum aestivum (wheat), and Oryza sativa L. (rice), preferably from the group consisting of Gossypium hirsutum L. (cotton), Zea mays L. (maize) and Glycine max L. (soybean). Particularly preferably, the cultivated plant is Glycine max L. (soybean).\n\nExamples of commercial available transgenic plants capable of expression of bacterial toxins are the corn varieties \"YieldGard corn rootworm\" (Monsanto), \"YieldGard VT\" (Monsanto), \"Her- culex RW\" (Dow, Pioneer), \"Herculex Rootworm\" (Dow, Pioneer) and \"Agrisure CRW\" (Syngen- ta) with resistance against corn rootworm; the corn varieties \"YieldGard corn borer\" (Monsanto), âYieldGard VT Pro\" (Monsanto), \"Agrisure CB/LL\" (Syngenta), \"Agrisure 3000GT\" (Syngenta), \"Hercules I\", \"Hercules II\" (Dow, Pioneer), \"KnockOut\" (Novartis),âNatureGard\" (Mycogen) and âStarl_ink\" (Aventis) with resistance against corn borer, the corn varietiesâHerculex I\" (Dow, Pi- oneer) andâHerculex Xtra\" (Dow, Pioneer) with resistance against western bean cutworm, corn borer, black"
