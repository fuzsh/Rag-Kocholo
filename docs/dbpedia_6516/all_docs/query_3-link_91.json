        "text": "Hola!\n\nStill has issues on ym side im afraid hardly could work when up to few millions of polygons, above 30millions... This is indeed really drives me seriously nuts and just kills my productivity flow right now...\n\nI simply can't put my different caching previously cooked all together... And they are not crazy heavy, but well optimized, no edge when not needed to sculpt a detail...\n\nI have a ASUS Strix OC RTX 3090, latest NVIDIA Studio driver, nothing else excepted Houdini running... Has even crash when you maximize and minimize windows like the geo spreadsheet, or netview view, back to regular layout...\n\nWhen im looking at Blender Eeve or Unreal, and how limited and the instability im facing now in Houdini, it's hard to be satisfy on this side... Hopefully Sidefx is listening\n\nIf someone has suggestion what could be the issue, if not a hard code houdini one, please shoot!\n\nIm not sure the driver of my rtx 3090 is very friendly with houdini.. So many crach where i don't have so many polygons.. i remember dealing with complex geo and env , and have much less trouble..
