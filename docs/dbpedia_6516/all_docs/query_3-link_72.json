        "text": "A follow-up to my story yesterday about a recent study on Latino influence by NM Incite. Among other things, the study found that Latinos are under-represented on LinkedIn. This is surprising because Latinos over-index on Twitter and Facebook. I speculated that (a) perhaps Latinos are not self-identifying on this network, and (b) that Latinos on LinkedIn might come forward if we simply asked the question, \"where are they?\"\n\nEsther Cepeda, a syndicated columnist with the Washington Post Writers Group, tweeted:\n\nwell, I don't like to be segmented out by ethnicity, and maybe lots of others don't either in bus. settings\n\nThat kind of fits with the point I made about self-identifying. It's one thing to identify as a Latino on Twitter. Perhaps it's quite another to do so on LinkedIn, a network that's almost exclusively dedicated to the professional life. Does it benefit Latinos to self-identify in a business environment?\n\nNot sure we know, but it does raise some questions about NM Incite's methodology. Were they scanning for Latino surnames on LinkedIn, or tallying results from people who self-identified? This afternoon, I got a clarification from a member of their communications team:\n\nThe figures noted in the chart (specifically focusing on demographics across social networks) were compiled using Nielsen NetView, which draws upon a panel of over 200,000 American Internet users to gather data on online usage—participation in the panel is completely voluntary. From that, we’re able to get information such as the websites visited, time spent online, etc. The members of the panel self-identify several factors, such as ethnicity, gender, age, occupation, income and other personal characteristics.\n\nThis suggests that Latinos may in fact be under-represented on LinkedIn; those that anonymously identified themselves as Latino are using Twitter more but using LinkedIn less than other groups on the panel. So the fix, if any, may not be to call Latinos out on Linkedin -- like LATISM did on Twitter -- but rather to ask why they are not on LinkedIn in the first place -- e.g., to call them in. In the meantime, this is becoming a story with more promise than I first expected. I stand by my original question (the one in the headline), but I am asking it for a different reason."
