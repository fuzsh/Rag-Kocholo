        "text": "NETView Communications, Inc. opens second data center in Sacramento, California\n\nSan Jose/Sacramento June 1, 2001 - NETView Communications, Inc., one of the first ISPs in Silicon Valley has expanded to Sacramento. The new data center began its operations officially on June 1, 2001.\n\nThe primary purpose of the center is to offer additional network capability to offset a growing congestion of Internet traffic in Silicon Valley. Additional benefits are network redundancy and therefore a high level of up time reliablity to our web hosting clients.\n\nTo take advantage of the Sacramento area's available pool of web designers, developers, and programmers, website updates and modifications will be implemented at the Sacramento location.\n\nThe expansion will also allow NETView to explore California's Central Valley ISP Market. Dispite the recent economic slow-down, NETView has enjoyed a steady growth based on market demand for its services.\n\nNETView Communications, Inc., a privately held California corporation, develops, hosts, and manages extensive websites for Silicon Valley companies, since 1994."
