        "text": "DOWNLOAD THE PRESENTATION\n\nABOUT THE WEBINAR\n\nSSL is being widely implemented to protect TCP application traffic. How can you diagnose problems? If the connection setup and negotiation causes poor response time, can you tell?\n\nPart of the security relies on digital certificates. In the past, only server certificates were used. Now, more and more companies are requiring client certificates. This complicates the handshake process and poses a number of new issues in management and control.\n\nWe will diagram and discuss:\n\nSSL handshakes with only a server certificate,\n\nSSL handshakes with both server and client certificates, and\n\nResumed handshakes\n\nThen, we will move on to:\n\nDiagnose SSL handshake problems,\n\nView invalid certificate authorities and bad certificates,\n\nDiscuss incorrect cipher suites,and\n\nAnalyze performance issues.\n\nWe will show a recent case with 95% overhead for an SSL FTP. After much analysis, it turned out that the SSL application was coded to encrypt one byte at a time. So, data was being sent with one byte of real data and 20 bytes of SSL overhead. No wonder it was taking so long!\n\nABOUT THE PRESENTER\n\nNalini Elkins, 2014 A.A. Michelson Award Winner\n\nNalini Elkins, the CEO and Founder of Inside Products, Inc., is a recognized leader in the field of computer performance measurement and analysis. In addition to being an experienced software product designer, developer, and planner, she is a formidable businesswoman. She has been the founder or co-founder of two start-ups in the high-tech arena.\n\nNalini has a strong computer networking background, but specializes in network performance analysis, measurement, monitoring, tuning, and troubleshooting of large enterprise computing networks including TCP/IP and SNA. One of her specialties is training and network design for IPv6 migration.\n\nNalini started her career working as an applications developer for Farm Bureau Insurance in Indiana and Decimus Corporation in San Francisco. It was at Decimus that she developed her initial expertise and love for networks and network performance analysis. This love affair has continued for over 25 years – longer than many marriages!\n\nNalini further honed her network design, performance, and diagnostics expertise during her tenure at Chevron Corporation. At that time, Chevron had one of the most complex networks in the world. Nalini helped to design the hardware configurations of their network. In fact, she was one of the chief architects responsible for the merger of the Chevron and Gulf networks.\n\nDuring her career Nalini served in groups responsible for network performance design, analysis, troubleshooting, and systems programming. The classes Nalini produces and instructs, and the products she develops are designed with the needs of systems programmers as a key requirement. Nalini has an excellent understanding for the needs of system programmers because she was in their shoes for many years.\n\nWhile at Chevron, Nalini developed an expert system for diagnosing network hardware problems. The marketing rights for this product were sold to Boole & Babbage (which was later taken over by BMC). Nalini then joined Boole to further develop and support this product. After some time at Boole, Nalini joined some other Boole employees in co-founding a new company – Applied Expert Systems.\n\nAs Technical Co-founder, Nalini helped to design and develop a number of products in the SNA and TCP/IP network management area. These products included expert systems for SNA diagnostics, web performance diagnostics, TCP/IP routing diagnosis and TCP/IP network management. She was the Chief Developer of the product IBM OEMed and marketed as the first version of NetView Performance Monitor for TCP/IP.\n\nNalini founded Inside Products, Inc. in 2001 to design, develop and market network management software. The products include: the Inside the Stack TCP/IP monitor, TCP Problem Finder, TCP Response Time Monitor, SSL Problem Finder, IPv6 Problem Finder, and Connection Log. Inside Products has many popular training classes attended by some of the largest corporations in the U.S., Canada, South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Spain, and Portugal. Inside Products provides consulting for IPv6 and to resolve network problems such as FTP throughput, socket application performance and TCP/IP tuning. Inside Products has international distributors in Australia, the European Union and Israel.\n\nNalini has published numerous articles in publications such as zJournal, Technical Support, Xephon’s TCP/IP Update, and Enterprise Systems Journal. Nalini is also a regular speaker at SHARE, NASPA, both national and regional Computer Measurement Groups (CMGs), and variety of international conferences. She was also the founder of the IPv6 Business Information Exchange (BIE).\n\nRegister to watch our recorded webinar"
