        "text": "More and more people are discovering the value of Web conferencing as a rapid and practical way to collaborate over great distances. German-based Netviewer AG is encouraging this trend by allowing private users to take advantage of its Web conferencing software for free. The offer is effective immediately. Users can obtain the fully functional program by downloading it from www.netviewer.com . Up to four people can jointly view and edit documents across great distances. The software is ideal for holding meetings or providing support. The free version is limited to private usage.\n\nThe ability to collaborate spontaneously is one of the reasons why Web meetings are so popular. The initiator of a meeting sends an e-mail invitation to other participants. The participants simply click on a link in the invitation and seconds later they can view the other person's screen. Software installation is not necessary. During a Web conference all participants can jointly view and edit documents, tables, and presentations. By changing the \"Direction of viewing\" each participant can lead a discussion by sharing files located on his or her computer. Functions like \"Remote Control\" enable the participants to make changes on the other person's computer. As a result, users are able to provide each other with rapid assistance in solving technical problems.\n\n\"Web conferences let you reach short-term decisions, save critical time, and vastly improve your efficiency no matter where in the world your partners are located,\" explains Dr. Andreas Schweinbenz, Founder and CEO of Netviewer. According to Dr. Schweinbenz, providing Netviewer Meet for free will increase awareness of the software: “We are confident that many of the new users will recognize the benefits of Web conferencing and purchase a license for business purposes.\" Netviewer solutions Meet, Support, and Remote are available starting at 29.90 € per month. These programs make it easy for small and large companies alike to collaborate with employees, vendors, and partners located at disparate locations, thereby helping them save time and reduce travel expenses.\n\nAdditional links:\n\nWeb conferencing: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_conferencing\n\nPrices for commercial use of Netviewer: http://www.netviewer.net/produkte/produktueberblick/\n\nAbout Netviewer:\n\nNetviewer AG (www.netviewer.com ) is the leading European manufacturer and provider of Web conferencing solutions.
