        "text": "Doconut allowed us to show many types of documents within the web application we developed for one of our larger customers. This has increased the user friendliness and efficiency of the tool considerably. We were very satisfied with the quick responses of the Doconut support.\n\nJ. Meij\n\nSr. Manager, KPMG Advisory Netherlands\n\nDoconut's solutions has added value to our business. In addition, we have quick return to our support tickets, that's why we recommend Doconut's products and services.\n\nOtto Machado\n\nDirector, Profits Consulting\n\nWe had a client request to provide the ability for their users to preview a range of Word documents (doc, docx), created by their legacy software, via their new web application. All potential solutions available were cost prohibitive until we came across Doconut. Any questions we had were responded to promptly and in a friendly manner.\n\nNathan Green (1st)\n\nDirector, Redox Software Ltd\n\nWe have been using the Doconut Library for a number of years now. It is very simple to use and gives a high quality preview of every type of document that we have had a need to display. I am pretty sure that it helps sell our portal product as the ability to preview the documents on-line is a bonus.\n\nJames Carter (1st)\n\nProgrammer, Redcastle CRM Ltd\n\nThe product is perfect for our requirements and the price was of exceptional value especially when you consider the additional functionality you get out of the box. The instructions were very comprehensive and we managed to develop a test system in no time in order to evaluate the product. Would I buy licences for future projects? Definitely. Would I recommend this product? Without a doubt.\n\nNathan Green (2nd)\n\nDirector, Redox Software Ltd\n\nThe level of support is excellent! When Autocad released a new version of their software which did not preview too well after I notified Doconut of this a new version of Doconut was made available within 24 hours that fixed it. The same again when changes were made to the DXF format.\n\nJames Carter (2nd)\n\nProgrammer, Redcastle CRM Ltd\n\nDoconut allowed us showing many types of documents within the web application document management system that helped us to reach the needed business value out of it, I liked the way they keep adding enhancements to it and I urge them to add more features to it so we can buy, their level of support is very good, I really encourage anyone having similar business requirements to consider doconut.\n\nMohammad Al Kiswani\n\nSr. Manager, SSSiT\n\nWe handle a lot of sensitive data on a daily basis and Doconut has made our product more secure and helped our customers comply with the new EU GDPR regulations, because it allows the users to view many document-formats in the browser, without downloading them to the local computer.\n\nHenrik Clausen\n\nCEO, Optimise-IT\n\nWe have been using the Doconut Viewer now for over 3 years. It is very simple to integrate with any asp.net application and works flawlessly. Also, the Doconut team continues to improve the viewer, making it one of the most valuable document viewer in the market. It is also priced competitively and is very well documented.\n\nAnselm Kia\n\nFounder\n\nDocument Viewer from DocoNut is the best software that view several types of digital documents and add annotations.\n\nSaddam ALyousefi\n\nProjects Manager, MTECH\n\nWe found doconut to be a very useful tool and easy to integrate with our application for viewing documents.\n\nKyriacos Fiakkas\n\nCEO, Exelsys\n\nWe were looking for a third party component to embed in our document management application called QualiWare in order to provide our users with a browser preview feature for the most commonly used office file formats. We found the Doconut component to be the most complete yet not so expensive component, and we successfully integrated it in QualiWare with a relatively small programming effort. Our appâ€™s users found the new preview feature to be very useful.\n\nPier Alberto GUIDOTTI\n\nCEO, CTO, ANALYSIS s.r.l."
