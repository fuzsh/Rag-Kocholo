        "text": "mquadr.at is pleased to announce its partnership with Netviewer Austria GmbH. From now on mquadr.at can integrate Netviewer’s remote service products into its own support solutions. This new solution ideally complements the existing self-care processes and extends mquadr.at’s product portfolio with another item. ISPs using mquadr.at’s software can now support their customers even more efficiently and cost-effectively.\n\nOften it is just a hasty click causing damage - and the customer needs help. Support can take care of such cases and solve the problem using remote support, provided an Internet connection exists. Customers do not need to install any particular software for this purpose. Support agents have an immediate view on the customer’s screen. This way they can avoid many possible misunderstandings and communication problems that are typical for telephone communication, and guide the customer unerringly and quickly to the correct solution. The support agent can also take initiative and take over control over the customer’s desktop. It goes without saying that confidentiality and data protection is ensured, as the customer decides if and how the support agent may access the system and which programs the agent may see. Thanks to this partnership mquadr.at offers a consistent portfolio for end user support, providing ISPs and their customers with optimal solutions for solving any kind of problem."
