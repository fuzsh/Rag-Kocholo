The archives of the Norwegian art historian and conservator were the object of the doctoral project carried out during a three-year period from 2019 to 2022 at the University of Florence by Ph.D. candidate Vanja Macovaz under the guidance of Professor Stella Sonia Chiodo. The scholarship in Digital Humanities involved the creation of a digital archive, where people could access study material, texts and tables, that highlights the links between workshops and works of art, which were shaped by the use of different forms of punch decoration. Using the author’s photographic archives, which can be accessed at Villa I Tatti in Florence where they are kept, it was possible to digitize and make available online all the important images that were at the base of Skaug’s forty-year research work as well as to create connections between them and the research published in the volumes “Punch Marks from Giotto to Fra Angelico: Attribution, Chronology, and Workshop Relationships in Tuscan Panel Painting” in 1994.\n\nThe nodegoat platform was used during this research work to obtain a graphic and interactive view of the data collected, allowing users to see the links between workshops and the punches they used, the contacts, the loans and exchanges of tools and how the latter were used to realize the works of art that have been studied in this project.\n\nProject Website: Punch Marks database\n\nPublic User Interface: nodegoat.net/viewer.p/100\n\nContinue readingComment\n\nNoble boarders in Early Modern Italy\n\nCORE Admin\n\nDatabase that analyses the educational careers of noblemen in Early Modern Italy and Europe.\n\nIlaria Maggiulli, Università di Bologna\n\nThe second half of the sixteenth century, following the Council of Trent, saw a growth in educational institutions. Various religious orders assumed the task of providing the youth with an education and, of course, the Jesuits proved the most successful. Among these new institutions, Colleges for Nobles were designed to train students enjoying a privileged social status, and prepare them to hold top positions in society, civil or ecclesiastical. These “seminaria nobilium” represented an educational option that more often than not was an alternative to university, particularly for the elder sons, who were expected to fill the ranks of the governing class and perpetuate the family lineage.\n\nThe database “Noble boarders in Early Modern Italy”, born out of a collaboration with the ASFE project dedicated to Italian universities’ students, aims at “filling the gaps” in the ASFE database. It currently collects the names of more than 15.000 boarders in 7 Italian “collegi per nobili” – Jesuits (Parma, Bologna, Ravenna, Siena) and not (Collegio Clementino in Rome, Collegio San Carlo in Modena, Accademia degli Ardenti in Bologna) – taken from printed and archival sources. Further information about these boarders (dates of birth/death, degree, career, portrait) are briefly mentioned, when known.\n\nnodegoat offered me the opportunity to import my “old” database and improve it by providing different, appealing visualisations (geographical, social and chronological). Furthermore, it allows me to constantly add, correct or improve data.\n\nPublic User Interface: nodegoat.net/viewer.p/99\n\nContinue readingComment\n\nAnalysing Languages and Dialects spoken in the Napoleonic Empire\n\nCORE Admin\n\nProject that maps epistolary networks on languages and dialects spoken in the Napoleonic Empire.\n\nSven Ködel, DHI Paris\n\nBetween 1806 and 1812, the French Ministry of the Interior conducted a large-scale survey by correspondence of the languages and dialects spoken in the Napoleonic Empire. For this purpose, letters were sent from Paris to the regional authorities – mainly prefectures, sub-prefectures, mayors – but also to individuals within the clergy and civil society. These agencies then initiated local networks for gathering the requested information. In total, the network includes over 500 agents who played different roles within the survey.\n\nVisualising this network of correspondence was an obvious idea, but impossible a few years ago during the research for my PhD. With the data on the hold, nodegoat now proofed to offer far more than a simple illustration, by facilitating the interpretation of the data and thus the understanding of the survey with regard to its development over time, its objects and its agents. The chronological visualisation helps to uncover main focuses that structured the survey over the course of its six years. The representation of the total network points the central role of the ministry, on one hand, and the multitude and diversity of the local agents on the other. These latter were particularly important for the success of the survey because, unlike the central administration, they possessed the necessary local and linguistic knowledge. However, they are far less predominant in the surviving handwritten documentation than the agents in the ministry and prefectures, which has affected earlier interpretations and evaluations of the survey as a whole.\n\nEvaluating the network with nodegoat allows an alternative approach to these sources and ultimately a different reading that does more justice to the role of local agents. A complete reconstitution of the local correspondence networks requires research in most of France’s regional archives and is yet far from complete. The visualisation with nodegoat is therefore still work in progress, the possibility to subsequently add, correct or improve data one of nodegoat’s clear advantages.\n\nPublic User Interface: nodegoat.net/viewer.p/84\n\nContinue readingComment\n\nNetwork analyses of foreign travelers through Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania\n\nCORE Admin\n\nResearch project that analyses accounts of foreign travelers through Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania between 1831-1840.\n\nPetrus Andrei Gabriel, Universitatea Babeș-Bolyai, Cluj-Napoca, Romania\n\nOne of the best known contemporary Romanian historians, Sorin Mitu, stated that small nations often tend to pay a special attention to foreign accounts narrating about their historical reality. On the one hand, because foreign travelers are the fiercest critics of the space they pass through, on the other hand, because these types of accounts shed light on the darkest and most inaccessible corners of society, where historians could hardly reach without the help of those who traveled through or even settled down. Starting from Mitu’s idea, I wanted to research these testimonies from another perspective. Working with traditional means, I found it really difficult and it took me a lot of time to write down all important aspects about travelers and then to group them by professions, education or even route, in order to make any type of analysis. This difficulty was the main reason behind my desire of developing a database which can include various facts about travelers and can be accessible to anyone for further studies. nodegoat suits this goal perfectly. The platform allows researchers to compile large databases and to analyze their data relying on network-type connections.\n\nThe main source used by the project are the travel memoirs of foreigners visiting the Romanian Principalities during the 1830s. The objective of the project was to map, by means of nodegoat, a series of variables related to the biographies of the foreign travelers and test the analytical possibilities offered by such approach. I have included information on the geographical space of origin, the university studies, the frequency of short and long-term trips and their purpose, the route, but also the places that made travelers divert from original itinerary. So, I created various easy-readable and modellable graphs (geographical, social and chronological) which show differences and similarities between travelers. Less effort is now needed for complex analyses which could otherwise have taken a long time and the results might have been less accurate than what we are able to present now.\n\nPublic User Interface: nodegoat.net/viewer.p/71\n\nPublication: ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=925679\n\nContinue readingComment\n\nCzechoslovak Underground Journals\n\nCORE Admin\n\nPhD project on self-produced journals covering non-conformist art activism in Socialist Czechoslovakia.\n\nLucie Janotová (Scuola Normale Superiore, Florence, Italy)\n\nDuring my PhD research on non-conformist art activism in Socialist Czechoslovakia, I came across a number of self-produced journals that seemed to be the perfect source for studying the nature of the Czechoslovak underground movement. However, as a political sociologist by training, I had only little experience with treating large quantities of analogue material. Because of that, I applied to the Cultures of Dissent in Eastern Europe summer school, hoping to equip myself with some basic knowledge of digital humanities that could hopefully help me treat my data in a more structured way. There I got to know nodegoat, and it has honestly changed my research approach from top to bottom.\n\nFor me, nodegoat is not just a visualisations tool, but primarily a personal research space. Because of the flexibility of its features, I was able to customize it exactly to my own needs, while leaving any confusing or unnecessary categorizations behind. Concerning my PhD project, nodegoat enabled me to build from scratch my own dataset of journal articles, full of interactive external links, research notes, and contextual information concerning authorship, topical category, or publication time-scale. Having all this information stored in one place has made my research much more organized and also more complete, because nodegoat is capable of integrating much more information than a simple PDF document or a folder, while keeping all the data clean and organized. Navigating between different objects is also very simple, which allows me to quickly double-check any occurring cross-references or further investigate any possible interactions and relationships.\n\nBecause I am working with a grounded theory analysis, I was also happy to find out that I can annotate and analyse full text material directly in nodegoat, which is making my research process even easier. Through a combination of coding categories, in-text tags, and simple visualisations, I am able to perform open-source textual analyses comparable to those provided by licensed software like MAXQDA or Atlas.ti. Moreover, the possibility of conducting social interaction visualisations also helps me quickly explore relationships between categories and possible changes over time, and makes my work-in-progress readily available for public presentations. Finally, if a more complex analysis is needed, nodegoat allows me to export all of my data into a simple CSV or a Word-doc file, which I can further explore through other software. In sum, my whole PhD research is currently stored on this platform, and I am only just starting to fully understand how much potential there is in it.\n\nContinue readingComment\n\nUniversity of Bern - Faculty of Humanities\n\nCORE Admin\n\nResearchers of the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Bern make use of nodegoat services provided by the Digital Humanities program of the Walter Benjamin Kolleg.\n\nAfter a successful pilot in 2020, the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Bern has established nodegoat support services at the Digital Humanities program of the Walter Benjamin Kolleg.\n\nThe project 'Dynamic Data Ingestion: collecting, linking and providing interoperable research data' runs on the nodegoat Go installation of the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Bern.

This allowed me to show the existence of two political spaces in the urban March (northern and southern), which is confirmed by the different nature of seigneurial power in the two areas.\n\nThe visalisation shown below displays the same for what concerns the capability of political actors to create and/or became part of wider networks, and their transformations over the concerned decades (i.e. the political networks of the March in 1317-1318). The nodegoat points-and-lines approach to visualization offers the chance to combine social network with spatial analysis and to give an incisive representation of a very unstable reality, such as that of Italy in the period concerned. nodegoat allows me to shed light on that complexity, by remarking continuity and change produced by a considerable number of political actors.\n\nContinue readingComment\n\nFORMAL. Mapping Fountains over Time and Place\n\nCORE Admin\n\nFORMAL aims to trace the shape of public water distribution in the city of Naples over the centuries.\n\nPamela Palomba and Emanuele Garzia (università degli Studi Suor Orsola Benincasa di Napoli)\n\nAs part of a research project on cultural heritage we were looking for a tool that would be able to structure the information on the monuments we were studying, both spatially and chronologically, to link them together in a cross-referenced way and thus obtain new insights into the history of urban transformation.\n\nThe city and its architectural evolution gather a vast set of information connecting different fields of research: digital humanities, spatial humanities and cultural heritage. FORMAL Mapping Fountain over time and place aims to trace the shape of public water distribution in the city of Naples over the centuries. The project uses nodegoat to map the movement of monumental fountains in time and space.\n\nThe objectives were essentially two: on the one hand, to catalogue and order the study material collected and systematize it through the production of personal and multimedia cards describing the characteristics of each fountain; on the other hand, to obtain for each object the geographical visualization of its position in space and time with the tracking of its movement from one place to another in different historical periods.\n\nnodegoat has made it possible to create a fully customized database, even if we are not experienced users, and perfectly suited to our research needs. Data modelling in the humanities is widely perceived as an epistemological process, rather than an ontological process, and we have verified that the database application interface can create new opportunities or create new challenges.\n\nThe research project was conducted by researchers from the Interdepartmental Research and Design Centre of Ateneo Scienza Nuova as part of the PhD in Humanities \"Humanities and Technologies: an integrated research path\" at the University of Suor Orsola Benincasa, Naples.\n\nPublic User Interface: http://personal-research-domain-garziaems.nodegoat.net/\n\nContinue readingComment\n\nVisualizing Early Nineteenth-Century Foreign Commercial Activity at Pernambuco\n\nCORE Admin\n\nResearch project that documents the evolution of transnational merchant networks over time and space between the 17th and 19th centuries.\n\nLaura Jarnagin Pang (Colorado School of Mines, Golden, Colorado, USA)\n\nI am a retired history professor who now has the amount of time to devote to research that I always craved. When I first discovered nodegoat, I didn't even know what a relational database was. I just knew that I had always dreamed of finding a way to visualize the complexities of all sorts of relationships found within extensive networks of merchants, which are the focus of my research. The nodegoat visualization samples I saw convinced me I had found the perfect medium for doing that.\n\nMy overarching research interest involves documenting the evolution of certain transnational merchant networks over time and space between roughly the latter 17th and mid 19th centuries. The many types of data this subject matter generates lend themselves to a variety of visualization opportunities. Both our perception and documentation of networks and networking can be significantly enhanced through visualizations of large amounts of data that go beyond what the written word alone can convey. Similarly, the scope, patterns, and evolution of transnational trade can be grasped quickly with geographical visualizations.\n\nFor my first nodegoat project, I focused on a subset of my research data, namely, an extensive collection of business records of an early 19th century commission house located in northeastern Brazil that was engaged in transnational commerce. Specifically, I used the outgoing correspondence generated by this firm during its first year-and-a-half in business as a window onto the international network of merchants with which it interacted. (There are no records of incoming correspondence, unfortunately.)\n\nSome 350 letters sent by this firm contain not only sender-recipient data, but also information about third parties involved in transactions and vessels engaged in transportation. While I have entered about 85% of that information, this database is still a work in progress. Thus far it has generated some 798 nodes and 1,343 links in a social visualization projection. I have found the interconnectivity among the individuals and firms within this network to be even more extensive and dense when viewed graphically than I had been able to intuit from the written record. In nodegoat, one can easily zoom in on any given node and easily explore the linkages associated with it. Projecting that same correspondence geographically was also revelatory.\n\nThis is but one of quite a few databases I have since developed using very different foci and types of information. I often go through several iterations of database design before settling on one that best displays the phenomena I am trying to capture visually. I am still learning nodegoat and the incredible range of what can be done in it. Experimentation is key. It is also teaching me new ways to think through the data I have, especially in terms of the various diachronic relationships found within diverse types of information, and how to break down that information into categories I might not have thought to delineate otherwise.\n\nContinue readingComment\n\nRepertorium Academicum Germanicum - The Graduate Scholars of the Holy Roman Empire\n\nCORE Admin\n\nThe RAG is a long-term project in the field of digital humanities that records and evaluates the biographical, social and cultural data of university scholars of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe aim of the Repertorium Academicum Germanicum (RAG) is to develop the history of the cultural reach of a pre-modern intellectual leadership. The RAG gains a comprehensive insight into the medieval origins of the modern knowledge society with around 60.000 scholars with 360.000 observations on their life and career paths, within the framework of an analysis of contextualized prosopography. The RAG uses nodegoat as their primary data storage application and research environment. nodegoat is also used to create and publish diachronic geographical and social visualisations.\n\nWork on the RAG began in 2001 under the direction of Rainer Schwinges and Peter Moraw, financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), the German research foundation and the Fritz Thyssen Foundation. From 2007 to 2019 the project was funded by the Union of the German Academies of Sciences and Humanities and from 2008 on as well by the Swiss Academy of Humanities and Social Sciences.

The first version of this visualisation was a diachronic spatial data visualisation, which still runs at http://projects.lab1100.com/labmap/.[....]\n\nContinue readingComment\n\nMapping Visions of Rome\n\nCORE Admin\n\nThis project aims to organize and annotate a collection of (Renaissance) Latin poetry related to the city and symbol of Rome.\n\nSusanna de Beer (LUCAS, Leiden University)\n\nAs part of a book project I was looking for a database environment in which I could organize and annotate a collection of (Renaissance) Latin poetry related to the city and symbol of Rome. When I came across nodegoat via de project ‘Mapping Nodes and Notes in Networks’ I immediately realized that this was what I needed. In nodegoat I could create exactly the kind of database structure I had in mind, and could benefit from the built-in chronological and geographical visualization options.\n\nIn Mapping Visions of Rome I can annotate the full text of my primary sources according to the elements of the Roman legacy they refer to and include information about these sources that place them in a specific historical and artistic context (also by linking dynamically to other resources). The annotations not only help me to understand the individual texts better, but also allow me to navigate through my material from different perspectives, in order to trace, for example, a specific Roman monument, literary motif or person, identify works that have been made within the same patronage network, or look for chronological or geographical trends.\n\nSince these poems often concern specific locations, the geographical visualization is especially useful and attractive. Numerous Renaissance poets included literary walks through Rome in their works, modelled on a famous passage in Virgil’s epic poem, the Aeneid. Using nodegoat I reconstructed a selection of these walks on the map of Rome, showing that these poets were not only interested in literary imitation, but also invested in a correct rendering of the topography of Rome.\n\nThis project has been funded by a VENI grant of the NWO (Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research), LUF (Leiden University Fund) and NIAS (Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences).\n\nProject Website: digitalromanheritage.com/mapping-visions-of-rome/\n\nPublic User Interface: rome.nodegoat.net\n\nContinue readingComment\n\nCollecting the West: How collections create Western Australia\n\nCORE Admin\n\nThis projects maps how objects from Western Australia have circulated through global, national, and local collecting networks during the last 400 years.\n\nCollecting the West re-defines Western Australia's place in the world by mapping and analysing what's been collected from Western Australia. Collecting the West is a collaboration between The University of Western Australia and Deakin University, in partnership with the Art Gallery of Western Australia, the State Library of Western Australia, the Western Australian Museum, and the British Museum.\n\nResearchers of this project use nodegoat to establish a data collection of items that have been collected from Western Australia. nodegoat is also used as a publication platform to write and publish short essays on collected items.[....]\n\nContinue readingComment\n\nBuilding the Portuguese Empire in the 19th Century\n\nCORE Admin\n\nThis projects seeks to understand the Colonial Public Works as a system of mobility, in which heterogeneous actors interact and shape one another in different ways.\n\nAlice Santiago Faria (CHAM, FCSH, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa)\n\nI was looking for and experimenting network analysis software and hadn’t made up my mind – one of my problems was that no software seemed to respond to what I wanted to do and I had to shape my data and my questions to it – when I come across nodegoat.\n\nI’m trying to explore a method of understanding the Colonial Public Works as a system of mobility, in which heterogeneous actors interact and shape one another in different ways, changing the built environment across geographies. So, one of my problems was that I wanted to work with a large heterogeneous dataset and to have control of the data. nodegoat was a perfect answer to my problems since is an object-oriented software and can be used to design your own datasets with great liberty. Moreover, it combines a set of unique possibilities that are really helpful for my work: the analysis of relations with spatial and chronological contextualization; it allows one to move smoothly from a micro (individual) to macro scale (collective) and back; it is possible to produce different types of analysis.\n\nFurthermore, it is designed thinking of historical data - therefore, incomplete data is not a big problem - and it allows linking each piece of data (in many types, typical historical references but also linking data from the web, to images, etc. to its source, maintaining the “control” I was looking for.\n\nThis project has been funded by Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia through national funds from Ministério da Educação e Ciência.\n\nProject website: buildingtheportugueseempire.org\n\nContinue readingComment\n\nReconstructing the Phillipps Collection (Phillipps pilot)\n\nCORE Admin\n\nThis project traces the history of manuscripts, and maps the provenance events and ownership networks which are embodied in that history\n\nToby Burrows (School of Humanities, University of Western Australia, and Oxford e-Research Centre, University of Oxford)\n\nSir Thomas Phillipps (1792-1872) put together the largest personal collection of European manuscripts ever assembled, containing as many as 60,000 items. The manuscripts had varied geographical origins, were written in many different languages, and covered a wide range of subjects and topics. Their dispersal took place gradually over more than one hundred years after Phillipps’ death, and their modern locations are spread across the globe.\n\nThe aim of this project is to trace the history of these manuscripts, and to map the provenance events and ownership networks which are embodied in that history. This involves bringing together heterogenous data from a variety of sources, constructing a data model to harmonize the data, and visualizing the data in the form of maps and graphs.\n\nnodegoat is the software platform I chose for the project. It enabled me to build my own data model, which combines descriptions of individual manuscripts with ownership events in their history. Data can be uploaded in batch from spreadsheets, as well as entered through customized input forms. The provenance histories can be viewed as geographical trajectories over the centuries, and can also be displayed as time-based network graphs. nodegoat is the ideal vehicle for my explorations of manuscript histories.\n\nThis project has been funded by an European Union Marie Curie International Incoming Fellowship (2014-2016).\n\nProject website: tobyburrows.wordpress.com\n\nPublic User Interface: personal-research-domain-burrows.nodegoat.net\n\nContinue readingComment\n\nSKILLNET - Sharing Knowledge in Learned and Literary Networks\n\nCORE Admin\n\nERC funded project at the University of Utrecht that uses nodegoat to study the networks of early modern scholars.\n\nSKILLNET analyses networks of the early modern community of learned men and women that were part of the so-called ‘Republic of Letters’. These letters are studied by means of qualitative as well as quantitative approaches. The project uses nodegoat to produce diachronic social and geographical visualisations. You can read more about their work in this blog post.\n\nSKILLNET runs between 2017 and 2022 at the University of Utrecht. This project is directed by Dirk van Miert and funded by the European Research Council with an ERC Consolidator Grant.

This results in an environment that includes data on more than 20.000 correspondences, written between scholars in the Dutch Republic and Tuscany in the seventeenth century. nodegoat enables me to map not only the overall structure of that network in interactive visualizations, but it highlights also the finest detail of that network structure. This means that I can represent not only the sender and the receiver of the letters, but I can provide a richer version of that network by including data on early modern books, authors and publishers.\n\nnodegoat has become an invaluable asset to my workflow. It supports me to import, curate, clean, explore and visualize every possible combination of data, enabling me to see and explore connections I would otherwise never have thought of. Moreover, the possibility to link nodegoat directly to the VIAF and the Short Title Catalogue offers me transparency and control over my data, making it easier to share and re-use my dataset afterwards.\n\nPublic User Interface: http://mnn.nodegoat.net/viewer\n\nContinue readingComment"
