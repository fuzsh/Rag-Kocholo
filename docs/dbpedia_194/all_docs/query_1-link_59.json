        "text": "KELLY NORMAND\n\nIn addition to being a full-time REALTOR since 2001, I have tried to get as much education in real estate as possible so I can use it to help my clients. Many years ago, I put in the extra hours to get my Associate Broker’s license, and since then I have earned many additional designations in my profession. I use my knowledge to educate my clients so they can make informed decisions and not feel lost in the process and paperwork. I have also consistently been a CENTURY 21 Pinnacle Quality Service Award winner.\n\nBasically, I love real estate. On the buy side, I enjoy the thrill of the house hunt, the satisfaction in finding the right home for my client, helping guide people to homeownership, being the winning offer and seeing my client get the home they want. On the listing side, my competitiveness also shows up and I enjoy being the one chosen to help the seller fulfill their goals of selling for the highest dollar in the shortest time and negotiating to protect my seller’s interests. I especially like it when my previous buyers call me to help them sell their home and find a new one.\n\nI have lived in Northern Virginia since 1984 and have lived in Arlington, Alexandria, Fairfax and Prince William Counties. I have seen the changes to the landscape and the real estate market and can help move you in the right direction."
