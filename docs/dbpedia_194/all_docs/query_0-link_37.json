        "text": "The first contact between the sistrum and the Greek world occurs by the diffu- sion of the cult of Isis outside of Egypt during the Hellenistic period. It is used in Isiac processions and can be the attribute of the goddess, of her priests, or of the simple devotee. Most of the objects found in Greece—for which the archaeological context is known—were found inside graves, even in Roman times. A number of headstones also show the deceased holding the instrument. According to several literary testimonies, the musical instrument embodies a specific funerary function, expressing the devotion of the deceased to the Egyptian cult. These representa- tions result in an individualization process, but also mainly because of the ques- tion and the possibility of the afterlife offered by this worship. As an idiophone, it also seems to hold an apotropaic aspect. The establishment of a typology, the detailed study of the organology, and the ornamentation of the sistrum show that a few objects were used as pure votive deposits and not as musical instruments. Temple accounts mentioning the sistrum or engraved inscriptions on instruments are very rare and only allow us to expect functions other than the musical one. Nevertheless, the bundled study of all an- cient evidence linked to the object can clarify its role as a votive offering. In that sense, this paper analyzes the value of the sistrum in the invisible (interior of the tomb) and visible (steles) funerary context.\n\nThe Latin documentary papyri housed in the Beinecke Library at Yale University are a sore spot for scholarship. One the one hand, they constitute a unique finding, inasmuch as they all come from the archive of a Roman cohors (the XX Palmyrenorum) stationing at Dura Europos, on the banks of the Euphrates, between 200 and 260 AD. There is nothing of the sort in extant documents from Roman army; nothing so abundant (more than 90 papyri) and so cohesive in origin and purpose. On the other hand, most of them are conspicuously fragmentary, ridden with holes and spots, and shrivelled – not easily allowing the researcher into their real meaning. Three subsequent editors (Gilliam, Fink, and Marichal) have fought against these difficulties; they have produced sometimes very different texts; attempted at replacing and re-joining many tiny scraps, invariably altering the record numbers of the fragments (fr. a becoming h, fr. k becoming c+g and the like) and sometimes puzzling the reader. The last overall edition dates back to 1976 and was done on photographs; a further survey made at the library in the Nineties re-framed all papyri, had several fragments resurface from the stacks, and once again changed many record numbers, adding to the confusion. This paper originates within the framework of ERC project PLATINUM, devoted to Latin texts on papyri. It will offer some preliminary result of an ongoing personal inspection, reassessment and re-edition of the Latin military papyri from Dura Europos. It will argue for a total make-over of fragments such as P.Dura 60, 61 or 68, whose text must be re-written; it will deal with issues concerning newly found fragments (P.Dura 62), which are in need of a brand new edition; it will inquire into wormholes and damages which could help re-joining or replacing fragments such as P.Dura 66 yy and aaa, 76, 77. These textual reassessments will be the basis for providing new insights and new perspectives in the history of everyday military life in this Roman outpost on the Eastern border of the Empire.\n\n“Plaza México” is a Mexican-themed mall located in the city of Lynwood, deep in South Los Angeles. Lynwood has experienced tremendous demographic shifts in less than half a century; the municipality has morphed from a “lily-white city” in the 1960s, a short-lived era of African-American majority to its current embodiment as a predominant working-class Latina/o community. In turn, “Plaza México” ––built by Korean-American developers in 2002–– has evolved to satisfy the official, material, affective and religious needs and desires of Latina/o immigrants, who over the last two decades have become the majority population in many South Los Angeles communities. This Mexican-themed mall has become a surrogate landmark for Latinas/os in South Los Angeles and has inspired the development of similar Latino-themed shopping centers in the region. The construction of these Mexican-themed plazas in South Los Angeles attest to the rapid and sweeping demographic transformation of the area in less than fifty years. In spite of being located in economically challenged communities, these shopping centers have been able to thrive by creating commercial spaces, which are architecturally and culturally modeled after Latin American plazas. This paper investigates the history of the property in which “Plaza México” is located, from its initial development as a shopping center created to stave off white-flight in the 1970s, its brief recreation as a black-oriented mall in the 80s, the departure of the department stores and ensuing temporary closure, to its current recreation as a semi-public space that caters not only to the consumer and leisure desires but most pressing, to the cultural and civic needs of the Latina/o South Los Angeles communities as a way to examine the role of Latina/o residents in reshaping the urban space in South Los Angeles and the United States.\n\nA Mycenaean presence in the Northeast (NE)Aegean, especially at Troy, has been the topic of a number of scholarlypapers for many years. A Minoan presence, in contrast,especially on the littoral islands, has been acknowledged only recently and sheds new light on the whole region. Whereas even a permanent physical presence of Mycenaeans istaken almost for granted, the emerging picture of the degree and nature of Minoan involvement in the NE Aegean, as well as recent developments in the field of post-colonial studies, urges us to take a fresh look not only at how we deal with “Minoans” abroad, but also with “Mycenaeans” abroad, especially in consideration of the differing core-regions from which these groups began.Thispaper considers the interaction of the NE Aegean with Crete and the Greek Mainland as a process comprising several stages that reflect different degrees of involvement in Aegean networks. By commenting on the composite material culture assemblages, we approach the question of cultural dynamics fromseveral perspectives: from the consideration ofdirect interaction bya given community to a central-core area of the Aegean (and the consequent adoption and limitation of certain aspects of the foreign material culture), to the exploration of active selection, adoption, and adaptation of innovations. The incorporation of such innovations into the local landscape is evaluated along two lines: 1) to what extent thisis a “simple” adoption (emulation), and 2) to what extent it generates new (hybrid) material and social constructs with its own coherence (transculturation)."
