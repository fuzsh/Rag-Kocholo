Heydler, president of the Na pions of the National Professional league. Lineup Strengthened .\n\nThe Giants' line will be strengthened by the return of Century Milstead, former Yale star, who was put out of the xenow which came early in the second quarter. He hade an eight yard run around right end after his back field mates had accomplished gains by crashes through Tech's center. After the first half the game was even- Both sides put in plenty of substitutes and few gains were made. Notre Dame's back field played flashily and their plavs be Jackets game with a badly dam year. The Bulldogs lost but one game last season and that to the Akron Indians, who intercepted a forward pass and converted it into a touchdown for the only score of the game .\n\nThe Giants were beaten in their only two starts by Providence and the Yellow Jackets\" and by close scores. Rooters Arrive. Cleveland rooters numbering 500 arrived here last night accompanied by a military band.

Mediocre football dulled interest in the second period .\n\nThe Swarthmore line showed a better defense than in the first quarter and twice took the ball on downs. Dignan kept the ball in Swarthmore territory with his excellent punting. Wilcox was still carrying the ball for Swarthmore, gaining slightly on most of his tries, Weekes in place of Beares for the Tiger made two nice gains through tackle.
