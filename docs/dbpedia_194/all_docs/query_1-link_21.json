        "text": "Bio\n\nKansas halfback, Gale Sayers had his breakout game midway through the 1962 season against host Oklahoma State. OSU had a 17-7 lead over Kansas in the second half. Suddenly Sayers erupted by running, cutting and churning and spinning his way to a record-setting 283 yards in 21 carries, including a 96-yard touchdown run. Kansas scored 29 points in the final two quarters and won, 36-17. His drive, aggressiveness, speed and change of direction became a Sayers trademark at KU and, before long, there was little doubt that he was the best back ever to play at the Lawrence campus. His ability to change direction made him one of football's most elusive ball carriers. Sayers left Kansas for a seven-year career with the Chicago Bears - and his star continued to climb. He twice led the National Football League in rushing and was named All-Pro in five of his seven pro campaigns."
