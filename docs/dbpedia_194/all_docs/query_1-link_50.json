        "text": "Sometimes being first to achieve something significant also means rarely enjoying the spotlight or hearing the cheers.\n\nSuch was the case for Fritz Pollard, a halfback for Brown University, who was the first African-American to play in the annual football game in Pasadena.\n\nIt was an honor he earned without any fanfare on Jan. 1, 1916. In the mud-soaked game, his team lost 14-0 to Washington State at Tournament Park, where New Year’s games were held before the Rose Bowl was built.\n\nBut some of the hardship for Pollard was just getting to and from the game.\n\nThe Brown team spent a week on several trains traveling from its home in Providence, Rhode Island, to Pasadena.\n\nHaving an African-American amid a contingent of whites was unusual in those days, especially on dining cars where Pollard had trouble just getting served, noted John M. Carroll, author of the 1992 book, “Fritz Pollard: Pioneer in Racial Advancement.”\n\nSome “dining-car waiters refused to serve Pollard,” Carroll wrote. “He later recalled he would either tell the waiter to ‘Go to hell’ or wait for his teammates to come to his rescue. Sometimes he was served, and sometimes he was not.”\n\nOn Dec. 27, the Bears disembarked in Pasadena and headed off to the Hotel Raymond only to meet Harvard graduate and proprietor Walter Raymond. He greeted them wearing a Harvard football uniform — perhaps a taunt to Brown’s 16-7 loss to the Crimson that season.\n\nBut things got serious for Pollard when he tried to register at the Raymond.\n\n“A clerk informed him he could not be accommodated,” wrote Carroll.\n\nWhen the team raised an objection over the affront, assistant coach William Sprackling took control of the situation. After some negotiations, Pollard was given a single room in the hotel.\n\nFortunately for Pollard, the Jan. 1 game was a lot less stressful. But he faced an adversary there — a field of mud — that even the half- back’s blazing speed couldn’t overcome.\n\nThe Tournament of Roses parade and game were inun- dated by a strong rainstorm that year, turning Tournament Park into something more common to winters in Rhode Island or eastern Washington.\n\n“It is not every football team that has a chance to wallow around and accumulate four or five layers of Pasadena mud,” wrote the Los Angeles Times’ Harry A. Williams on Jan. 2, poking a little fun on the city.\n\n“Considering the price of real estate in Pasadena, it is estimated the Brown athletes had at least $125,000 worth of mud clinging to them when they left the field.”\n\nBrown, assuming Southern California would live up to its reputation for sunny winter days, failed to bring any foul weather cleats. Unable to maneuver with his usual quickness, Pollard rushed for only 47 yards, the lowest total of his college career.\n\nThe first half of the game was scoreless.\n\nA Washington State drive was stopped when Pollard, playing in the defensive backfield, intercepted a pass on the Brown 25-yard-line.\n\nThings got especially rough for Pollard early in the third quarter.\n\nHe was piled on by several Washington State tacklers who smashed him face-down into a 4-inch-deep puddle and were slow to get off. Pollard needed some time on the sidelines to shake off that tackle.\n\n“Honestly, with Fritz bound to be out of breath and panting, I thought he would drown,” Sprackling recalled later.\n\nIn the second half, Washington State scored two touchdowns and kept Pollard and the Bears out of the end zone.\n\n“Pollard, the gentleman of color and ability … hardly performed up to the advance notice,” wrote Williams, noting the mud did slow down Pollard, though not completely. “He was a slippery as an eel, and it generally took about half of the Washington team to quiet him.”\n\nAfter the game, things weren’t any smoother for Pollard. Brown traveled by train to San Francisco and stayed one night. There, Pollard was denied a chance to stay with the team and was forced to get a room in a more African-American region of town.\n\nBut despite the loss in Pasadena, the season had given a hint of future success for the Bears and Pollard.\n\nThe 1916 team went 8-1 and beat both Harvard and Yale. It scored 254 points, allowing only 37.\n\nThe 22-year-old Pollard became the first African-American backfield player to be named to Walter Camp’s prestigious All-American team.\n\nBut that season was also the last for Pollard. He had never been a strong student at Brown plus the U.S. entry into World War I reduced the number of players at universities which sharply reduced or cancelled football seasons.\n\nPollard joined the Army as an instructor and to conduct special programs involving African-Americans on the East Coast. He was later assigned to Lincoln University near Philadelphia to serve as a campus military coordinator and also coached the college team.\n\nOn Nov. 9, 1919, Pollard, no longer in the Army, played for Akron, Ohio, in a game against Massillon, making him the sixth African-American to play in a pro football game. Akron lost, though Pollard starred running the ball and returning punts, explained Carroll.\n\nIn 1920, the American Professional Football Association was organized and the newly named Akron Pros, led by Pollard, won the inaugural championship.\n\n“He played quarterback; he was (a) running back. He did punt returns, kickoff returns. He even did the punts and the kicks,” explained his grandson, Fritz Pollard III. “There wasn’t a thing he didn’t touch in the game.”\n\nBy 1921, Pollard was listed as co-coach of the Akron team, making him the first African-American coach in professional football.\n\nBut it would be nearly seven decades before another African-American — Art Shell with the Oakland Raiders in 1989 — would be given the reins of a pro football team. Pollard also played and co-coached for Milwaukee and Hammond in the fledgling National Football League in the 1920s. But even with his success, race played a role in the way players, football and fans treated him.\n\n“Unfortunately, he used to have to get dressed in his car,” recalled another grandson, Dr. Steve Towns. “Can you imagine that? Your star player having to get dressed in his car and then come onto the field?”\n\nHis career ended in 1926 and the following year there were no African-Americans in pro football until after World WarII.\n\nPollard organized a team of African-American players, “the Brown Bombers,” who barnstormed until the late 1930s.\n\nIn 1936, his son Fritz Pollard Jr., an outstanding college hurdler, joined Jesse Owens in frustrating the aspirations of Adolf Hitler in the Berlin Olympic Games.\n\nThe young Pollard hit the last three hurdles in the finals of the 110-meter event but still earned a bronze medal, adding to the honors earned by African-Americans in Germany.\n\nMeanwhile, his father branched beyond sports, becoming a significant African-American entrepreneur.\n\nHe founded his own invest- ment firm, established a New York newspaper and opened a motion picture studio in Harlem which attracted the major African-American talent of the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nPollard — he got the nickname Fritz from German neighbors growing up in his hometown of Chicago — was the first African-American to be named to the College Football Hall of Fame, in 1954.\n\nHe joined players of both teams from the 1916 game in Pasadena as honored guests at the 1956 Rose Bowl, paying homage, among other things, to the first African-American in the game.\n\nHowever, it would not be until 2005, nine years after his death at 92, that Pollard was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. In 2016, he was named to the the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame.\n\nIt may have taken many years for football to fully realize and honor Pollard’s place in its growth. However, his legacy continues toward increasing opportunities for minorities in the National Football League.\n\nThe Fritz Pollard Alliance, fritzpollard.org, serves as a watchdog to assure that there is greater diversity in team staff positions.\n\nIt was most recently active in the hiring of Jon Gruden as coach of the Oakland Raiders earlier this year, asking the NFL to investigate whether minority candidates were given a fair consideration.\n\nThe NFL determined league rules were not violated.\n\nGiven the difficulties Pollard faced in his career, the Alliance decided to take his name when it was founded in March 2003.\n\n“All-American, first black to play in the Rose Bowl. Outstanding, coming from Brown,” explained Alliance chairman John Wooten on a WBUR-Boston documentary earlier this year. “So when we started the organization, that’s why we took the name we took.”\n\nPollard career recap\n\nFritz Pollard, at 5-foot-9 and 165 pounds, wasn’t typical of today’s running backs, but contemporary accounts describe him as an exciting, elusive runner and the most feared running back in the fledgling American Professional Football Association. During his pro football career, the two-time All-American played and sometimes coached for four NFL teams:\n\nThe Akron Pros/Indians, 1920-21 and 1925-26;\n\nThe Milwaukee Badgers, 1922;\n\nThe Hammond Pros, 1923, 1925; and\n\nThe Providence Steam Roller, 1925.\n\nPollard also spent time in 1923 and 1924 playing for the Gilberton Cadamounts, a strong independent pro team in the Pennsylvania “Coal League.”"
