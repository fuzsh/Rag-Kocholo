The place name probably means \"middle place\" from the Old English middel + stede. 1 However, the first reference of the surname was in the Hundredorum Rolls of 1273 where Richard de Minsted was listed in Buckinghamshire.

They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 9\n\nMilstead Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nEdward Milstead, a bonded passenger, who arrived in Barbados or Jamaica in 1674\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Milstead (post 1700) +\n\nCharles Frank \"Charlie\" Milstead (1937-2022), American professional football player from Tyler, Texas who was a quarterback and defensive back for the Houston Oilers (1960-1961)\n\nCentury Allen \"Wally\" Milstead (1901-1963), American college and NFL football player, inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1977\n\nDarrell Milstead (1934-2011), American producer, founder and CEO of Nandar Entertainment and Silver Cinema\n\nRoderick Leon \"Rod\" Milstead (b. 1969), former American NFL football guard\n\nGeorge Earl Milstead (1903-1977), American Major League Baseball pitcher in the 1920s with the Chicago Cubs\n\nHarris Glenn Milstead (1945-1988), American actor and musician, best known for his drag persona, Divine\n\nRelated Stories +\n\nCitations +\n\nMills, A.D., Dictionary of English Place-Names.
