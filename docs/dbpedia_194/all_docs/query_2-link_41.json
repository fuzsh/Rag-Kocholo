        "text": "Warren Carlos Sapp (born December 19, 1972) is a former American football defensive tackle. A Hall of Famer, Sapp played college football for the University of Miami, where he was recognized as a consensus All-American and won multiple awards. Sapp played in the National Football League (NFL) from 1995 to 2007 for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Oakland Raiders, making the Pro Bowl seven times. Following Sapp's NFL career, he was an analyst on NFL Network until 2015. Sapp was drafted by the Buccaneers in the 1995 NFL Draft as the 12th overall pick. In his nine seasons with the Buccaneers, he earned seven trips to the Pro Bowl and a Super Bowl ring in 2002. He moved to the Raiders in 2004. His 96.5 career sacks (100 with playoffs included) are the second-highest career sacks for a defensive tackle and the 28th-highest overall for a defensive lineman. His 77 sacks with the Buccaneers are the second-most in the team's history to Lee Roy Selmon's 78.5. His career was checkered by controversy from his hard-hitting style of play and occasional verbal outbursts, both on the field and off, some of which resulted in fines by the league, and he was once ejected from a game for unsportsmanlike conduct. In his first year of eligibility, on February 2, 2013, he was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The Buccaneers entered him into their Ring of Honor on November 11, 2013, and retired his number 99 jersey. Sapp became the second Buccaneer to have his jersey retired, after Selmon.\n\nOrlando Lamar Pace (born November 4, 1975) is a former professional American football player who was an offensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL) for thirteen seasons. He played college football for Ohio State University, and was twice recognized as a unanimous All-American. He was drafted by the St. Louis Rams, first overall in the 1997 NFL Draft, and played professionally for the Rams for twelve years. Pace started all 16 regular season games eight times in his pro career, and blocked for three straight AP NFL MVPs (Kurt Warner in 1999, 2001; and Marshall Faulk in 2000). He was the cornerstone of a Rams offensive line that blocked for an offense that compiled more gross yards than any other team during his 12 years in St. Louis (50,770 in 12 seasons), finished second in completion percentage (61.8 percent) and fifth in touchdown passes (289) over that time. Under Pace's protection, the Rams' passing offense compiled more than 3,000 yards in all 12 of his NFL seasons, seven different quarterbacks eclipsed the 3,000-yard mark in a season, including three times surpassing the 4,000-yard mark, and blocked for seven 1,000-yard rushers. Pace started 154 games with the St. Louis Rams and Chicago Bears, with whom he played the final season of his career in 2009. A five-time All-Pro and seven-time Pro Bowl selection, Pace earned a Super Bowl ring with the Rams in Super Bowl XXXIV. Pace was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2013 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nGary Wayne Zimmerman (born December 13, 1961) is a former American football offensive tackle in the National Football League. Zimmerman played for the Minnesota Vikings from 1986 to 1992 and for the Denver Broncos from 1993 to 1997. He won Super Bowl XXXII with the Broncos against the Green Bay Packers. He was selected to the Pro Bowl seven times and was an All-Pro selection eight times. He attended Walnut High School and the University of Oregon whereby he was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nBruce Rankin Matthews (born August 8, 1961) is a former American football offensive lineman who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 19 seasons, from 1983 to 2001. He spent his entire career playing for the Houston / Tennessee Oilers / Titans franchise. Highly versatile, throughout his NFL career he played every position on the offensive line, starting in 99 games as a left guard, 87 as a center, 67 as a right guard, 22 as a right tackle, 17 as a left tackle, and was the snapper on field goals, PATs, and punts. Having never missed a game due to injury, his 293 NFL games started is the second most of all time. Matthews played college football for the University of Southern California, where he was recognized as a consensus All-American for the USC Trojans football team as a senior. He was selected in the first round of the 1983 NFL Draft by the Oilers. He was a 14-time Pro Bowl selection, tied for the most in NFL history, and a nine-time first-team All-Pro. Matthews was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2007, and his number 74 jersey is retired by the Titans; he is the only member of the team to have his number retired having played for the Titans. After retiring as a player, Matthews served as an assistant coach for the Houston Texans and Titans. A member of the Matthews family of football players, he is the brother of linebacker Clay Matthews Jr.; father of center Kevin Matthews and tackle Jake Matthews; and uncle of linebacker Clay Matthews III and linebacker Casey Matthews."
