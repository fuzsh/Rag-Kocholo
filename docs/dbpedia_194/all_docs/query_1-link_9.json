The Bulldogs finished with an undefeated 8–0 record under sixth-year head coach Tad Jones. Yale outscored its opponents by a combined score of 230 to 38, including a 40–0 victory over Georgia, a 31–10 victory over Army and shutout victories over rivals Princeton and Harvard.[1] Two Yale players, tackle Century Milstead and fullback Bill Mallory, were consensus selections for the 1923 College Football All-America Team.[2] The team was selected retroactively as a co-national champion by the Berryman QPRS system.[3]"
