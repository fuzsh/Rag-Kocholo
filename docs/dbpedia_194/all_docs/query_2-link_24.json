        "text": "Bio\n\nFrancis \"Reds\" Bagnell was a Pennsylvania sophomore in 1948. He came off the bench with five minutes to play in the third game of the season and led a Penn rally that beat Columbia 20-14. In 1949, his best game was against Army; he completed 15 of 20 passes. In 1950, he rushed for 214 yards and passed for 276 in a 42-26 victory over Dartmouth. His single-game total offense of 490 yards was a national record. So was his streak of 14 straight pass completions. Bagnell finished 1950 with 1,603 yards on total offense, ranking eighth in the nation. He made first-team All-America halfback, won the Maxwell Award, and was named Player of the Year by Football Digest and the Helms Foundation. In the early 1940s he was the team's water boy; in 1949 he was team captain. He won nine letters in football, basketball, and baseball. He had a business career in Philadelphia and was president of Resource America Inc. President Ronald Reagan in 1981 named him a member of the Battle Monuments Commission, charged with preservation of U.S. military cemeteries on foreign soil. In 1984, he flew to France for ceremonies on the 40th anniversary of D-Day. Bagnell was elected president of the Maxwell Club in 1976 and president of the National Football Foundation in 1990"
