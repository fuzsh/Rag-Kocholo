        "text": "Jerry Sheridan was not anointed by his boss, longtime Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. But he won, anyway, and by a convincing margin.\n\nJerry Sheridan’s commanding early lead in the GOP race for sheriff proves how little sway Joe Arpaio holds anymore.\n\nCertainly not for the office that Sheriff Joe held for close to a quarter of a century but lost spectacularly in 2016 and failed to regain four years later.\n\nAnd not for the influence he sought to have this go-around by endorsing Frank Milstead for sheriff, snubbing Sheridan, his one-time deputy chief.\n\nSheridan is having the last laugh. And not for the first time.\n\nMilstead had wide backing. Sheridan won handily\n\nHe edged Arpaio by a few thousand votes in the 2020 primary (and went on to lose to Democrat Paul Penzone, who resigned from the office earlier this year).\n\nThis time, he beat the man Arpaio anointed.\n\nAnd in impressive fashion: Milstead, a former state Department of Public Safety director and a former chief of Mesa police, was backed by former Gov. Doug Ducey, former U.S. Marshal for Arizona David Gonzales, longtime Phoenix City Councilman Sal DiCiccio and others.\n\nAnd several police unions, to boot.\n\nSheridan’s tenure under Arpaio will no doubt come under scrutiny again in the general election.\n\nBut he has distanced himself from the man whose entanglements with the Justice Department led to a consent decree that the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office remains under to this day — and at a cost of more than $300 million for taxpayers.\n\nExpect his record under Arpaio to resurface\n\nIn a Republican primary debate, Sheridan said this of Arpaio: “There was some mistakes made by the previous sheriff with targeting Hispanic neighborhoods, and I used to argue with him all the time, ‘Sheriff, don’t do this.’\n\n“And then when the court order came out, he said, ‘I’m not going to listen to the court order.’ I said, ‘Stop, sheriff, you gotta stop saying this.’ ”\n\nArpaio, in fact, cited that exchange as one reason why he endorsed Milstead instead of his former top aide.\n\nPenzone couldn't root out racial bias: Can anyone?\n\nSupporters of Sheridan, including Chris Hegstrom, who worked in Arpaio’s administration as a spokesperson, said Sheridan got a disproportionate share of the blame as Arpaio’s second-in-command given that he didn’t join the executive team until the department was already embroiled in legal troubles over its immigration enforcement.\n\nHegstrom insisted to me that the arguments Sheridan and others in the command staff had with Arpaio were real, though hidden from public view.\n\nAs all the candidates for sheriff agreed — including the two running in the Democratic primary — priority No. 1 for whoever assumes office is to finish mopping up the consent decree mess from Arpaio’s reign.\n\nTo get out from under the thumb of the federal government and court monitors.\n\nSheridan will have to fight that Arpaio association once again in the general election — even if their personal ties are severed for good."
