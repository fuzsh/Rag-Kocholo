In effort to make the online Black Historycelebration more navigable, all of the parts mentioned aboveThe Council of <strong>Ivy</strong> Group Presidentswww<strong>Ivy</strong><strong>League</strong><strong>Sports</strong>comwill be narrowed to focus on the contributions of African-American student-athletes at each individual institution.While this project would not have been a success withoutthe help and contributions of the athletics departments andsports information offices from each of the eight schools, <strong>Ivy</strong><strong>League</strong> Public Information Assistant Eddy Lentz will be theproject coordinator and chief contributor this year.The project has also gotten to this point because of thework of several former Public Information Assistants in the<strong>Ivy</strong> Office, including Dan Rosenthal, Erica Hurtt, JenniferEnke, Christian Green, Sherryta Freeman and KevinAnderson..As female athletics opportunities continue to grow acrossthe country, <strong>Ivy</strong><strong>League</strong><strong>Sports</strong>.com will pause to reflect on theimportant role women play in athletics — especially here inthe <strong>Ivy</strong> <strong>League</strong> — when National Girls & Women in <strong>Sports</strong>Day (NGWDS) rolls around in early February.<strong>Ivy</strong> <strong>League</strong> schools sponsor the most teams, offering themost opportunities to the most women, of any league in thecountry.
