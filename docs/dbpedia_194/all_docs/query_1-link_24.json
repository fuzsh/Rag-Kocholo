He enlisted in the Marines and was at Cherry Point, N.C. He played for the football team there for one season. During World War II he saw active duty with the marines in the invasion of Saipan and Okinawa. Nomellini enrolled at the University of Minnesota as a 22-year-old freshman in 1946. He became a four-year starter on the football team. He played both offense and defense at tackle and was consensus All-America in 1948 and 1949. He also wrestled at Minnesota and won the Big Ten heavyweight championship. He was on the Minnesota track team as a shot putter and anchor man on the 440-yard relay team. He was big, quick, fast, aggressive, and was given a nickname; \"the Lion\". Nomellini played tackle for the San Francisco 49rs 1950-63. He set a record by playing in 174 consecutive regular season games. He was never injured. He made All- Pro seven times and in 1970, was named to the National Football League's all-time team. In the off season, he starred as a pro-wrestler."
