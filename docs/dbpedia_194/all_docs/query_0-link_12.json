        "text": "By Chris Willis, NFL Films\n\nEditor's Note: Chris Willis is head of the Research Library at NFL Films and is the author of the upcoming Red Grange: The Life and Legacy of the NFL's First Superstar.\n\nPro Football Journal is pleased to present his picks of the best-ever Pre-WWII players—\n\nChoosing the greatest of any position during the Pre-WWII period (circa 1920-1944) is always a daunting task, but resources used to put together this list was going through game footage; newspapers of the era; testimonies of players, coaches & executives, as well as sportswriters who wrote about the game; magazines and any individual honors, All-Pro teams, and greatest of all-time lists.\n\nAs for statistics, the NFL didn’t keep official stats until 1932, so that is taken into consideration when making these evaluations. Besides Total Football I and II, another great source used was The Football Encyclopedia, by David Neft, Richard Cohen and Rick Korch, who recreated stats for the NFL’s early years through play-by-plays and newspaper reports. It’s the closest thing we have to early numbers.\n\nIn 1920 the Rock Island Argus (sportswriter Bruce Copeland) choose the “first-ever” APFA-NFL All-Pro team (APFA in 1920)- he listed 3 teams. The Associated Press, UP and I.N.S., selected their All-Pro teams during this era. While newspapers such as Green Bay Press-Gazette (GBPG), Buffalo News and Courier, New York Daily News (NYDN), Boston Post, Detroit Free-Press, Milwaukee Sentinel, and Chicago Tribune would select All-Pro teams as well; while publications like Collyers’ Eye and Pro Football Illustrated magazines also listed All-Pro honors. NFL coaches, such as George Halas, Guy Chamberlin, Curly Lambeau, Leroy Andrews, and Ray Flaherty also picked All-Pro teams during this era, as well as NFL players like Red Grange, Ernie Nevers and Lavvie Dilweg. NFL President, Joe F. Carr, selected an All-Pro team (two squads) in 1925 that was printed in Liberty Magazine.\n\nTeam success also contributed to the ranking, as well as going through newspapers such as GBPG, Pottsville Republican, Canton Repository, Chicago Daily Journal, and more who would publish play-by-plays of early NFL games to get a better sense of how they these players played the game.\n\nResources such as the Pro Football Hall of Fame, NFL teams (especially the Packers and team historian Cliff Christl), Newspapers.com, and Pro Football Reference, and more contributed mightily.\n\nNext up in our series of the Pre-WWII players is the Tackle position.\n\n“The name of the game for linemen is sacrifice. There isn’t much glory in it for them, and there’s a lot of pain,” said Ed Healey to the Toledo Blade in 1975.\n\nTackles of this era were usually the biggest man on the team. Typically standing above 6-feet and weighing 200, to the heaviest at around 250-pounds. Writing in his 1935 instructional book, Football, former NFL head coach Potsy Clark listed 11 coaching points for the perfect tackle: (see scan above)\n\n“As the game is played today, lineman are called upon to shift their weight and power in the wink of an eye. They may ‘feint’ in one direction and drive through in another, to cover, momentarily, the direction of the ball carrier. That takes control. And to knock down a 230-pound lineman who is as tough as all-get-out, that takes power,” said Bill Morgan, former Giants All-Pro tackle (tackle number 25 on list).\n\nHere is the list of the Top 35 Pre-WWII tackles:\n\n1)Cal Hubbard (1927-1933, 1935-1936) Number one on the list is the great Cal Hubbard, considered the “most feared lineman of his time.” The 6-2, 253-pound Hubbard played 9 years of pro ball (105 games) with the New York Giants (1927-28, 1936), Green Bay Packers (1929-33, 1935) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1936)….he played his first two years as an end, making All-Pro both years…moved to tackle when he joined Curly Lambeau’s Packers in 1929…member of 4 NFL Championship teams, 1927 Giants, 1929-1931 Packers…excelled as a blocker on offense, and backed up the line on defense (sometimes standing up like a linebacker)… “I never played harder than I did against the Bears. I can still hear Halas hollering from the sidelines for me to lay off his center, George Trafton. Trafton was a mouthy guy. He was always lipping off. So I knocked the hell out of him every chance I got,” said Hubbard in 1976…First-team All-Pro three times by the NFL (1931-1933) and UPI (31-33); as well as being named twice First-team by Collyers (1932-33) and once by Chicago Daily News (1933)…Named to NFL 1920s All-Decade Team…scored 2 career TDs, including an interception return against the Giants in 1935 (16-7 win)…Elected as Charter Member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame (1963)…Named NFL’s All-Time Tackle for the 50th Anniversary All-Time team in 1969…Named to NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Two Way Team (1994)…only man to be elected to the Pro Football and Baseball Hall of Fames (as an umpire)…Elected to Packers Hall of Fame in 1970.\n\n“I never saw a better lineman, either on offense or defense.”—Curly Lambeau, Packers Hall of Fame coach.\n\n“Hubbard is the best tackle I’ve seen…He’s very fast, I’ve tried to block him out, and it can’t be done. I’ve seen him on defense start through the line and shove it entirely out of position. He must be 35 now, but he is all man, and I’ve never seen a better football player.”—Dutch Clark, Hall of Fame back, about Hubbard in 1932.\n\n“There never was a better lineman than that big umpire.”—George Halas, Bears Hall of Fame end and coach, told Arthur Daley of the New York Times.\n\n“The best lineman I ever saw was Cal Hubbard.”—Jimmy Conzelman, former NFL back and Hall of Fame coach.\n\n“A giant of a man who could outrun any back in the league for 30 yards…Cal, with his combination of speed, weight, and timing, was a devasting blocker. On defense he made them run the other way.”—Steve Owen, former Giants tackle and head coach.\n\n“The greatest tackle I ever played against or got clobbered by.”—Red Grange, former Bears Hall of Fame halfback.\n\n“Probably the greatest tackle I ever played against was Cal Hubbard of the Packers. Hubbard was the left defensive tackle and he stopped everything.”—Mel Hein, former Giants Hall of Fame center-linebacker.\n\n2)Pete “Fats” Henry (1920-1923, 1925-1928) Nicknamed “Fats”, mainly for his odd body shape at 5-feet-11, 245-pounds, but Henry was just as fast and athletic as any back in the NFL during his era. A 60-minute performer, Henry played 8 years with Canton, New York Giants and the Pottsville Maroons (86 games)…also played for Pottsville in 1924 when they were not an NFL-team…Member of 2 NFL Championship teams with Canton (1922-23), paring with fellow tackle Link Lyman for the league’s best duo…those two seasons helped Bulldogs to back-to-back titles with an overall record of 21-0-3…Named First-team All-Pro by Rock Island Argus (1920), Buffalo News (1921), and Green Bay Press-Gazette, Collyers, and George Halas in 1923…First-team All-Pro by Guy Chamberlin twice (1922-23) and the Canton Daily News in 1923…Named Second-team by the Ohio State Journal in 1925…Selected to NFL 1920s All-Decade Team…Named to NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Two Way Team (1994)…also one of the NFL’s best kickers and punters during his era- once booting a 94-yard punt for Canton (1923)…In 1923, Henry led the NFL in Extra Points made (25) and was second in FGs made with 9 (Paddy Driscoll- 10). His 59 points scored was 2nd in NFL behind Driscoll’s 78 points as he led the league champions, Canton Bulldogs, to an 11-0-1 record—if an MVP vote was done that year, Henry could’ve easily won the award…Charter Member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963…Named to NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Two-Way Team (1994).\n\n“As an end for the Bears I played directly opposite him on hundreds of plays and only once in all that time was I ever able to block him out.”—said George Halas, in 1962.\n\n“Tackles will come and tackles will go but never will pro football enthusiasts see the peer of Wilbur Henry.”—wrote the Canton Repository in 1922.\n\n“Pete Henry was the most unusual specimen you ever saw. He was fast and could run all day. You hit him and your head would go in clear up to your neck. How he could play.”—Cal Hubbard, former teammate with Giants (1927) and Packers Hall of Fame tackle.\n\n“He was the best tackle I ever saw.”—Grantland Rice on Henry.\n\n“It was like bouncing off a rubber ball. I never budged him once. After five minutes, I felt as I had just finished a full 60-minute game…anything you’ve read or heard about Pete Henry is true. He was a great one.”—Charlie Berry, an All-Pro end with Pottsville Maroons, about playing against Henry in 1925.\n\n3)Roy “Link” Lyman (1922-1928, 1930-1931, 1933-1934) Very agile for his size at 6-2, 233-pounds, given credit for pioneering more sophisticated defensive play on the line, by shifting and sliding, opponents were forced to adjust to his tactics with new blocking strategies…a dominant force on defense, almost unblockable at times…in 1937 former Bears teammate Bill Hewitt called “Lyman the greatest of them all”…played 11 years (133 games) with 4 different franchises- Canton, Cleveland, Frankford and several stints with the Chicago Bears (1926-28, 1930-31, 1933-34)…Member of 4 NFL Championship teams; Canton (1922-1923), Cleveland (1924) and Chicago Bears (1933)…never played for a losing team in 11 NFL seasons…Scored 6 career TDs, including 4 in 1924 for the NFL Champions Cleveland Bulldogs (had 3 fumble recovery and 1 TD catch, 50-yards vs Dayton)…First-team All-Pro by Collyers in 1924, 1930, 1934; by NFL President Joe Carr in 1925; by Green Bay Press-Gazette in 1930, 1934; NFL in 1930; Red Grange and Milwaukee Sentinel in 1930; Brooklyn Eagle in 1933 and UPI in 1934 at the age of 36…Second-team All-Pro by Collyers in 1923, 1925; NFL in 1928, 1934; and GBPG in 1924 and 1928…somehow overlooked for NFL 1920s All-Decade team; should’ve been selected over Steve Owen…Elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1964 (2nd class), when he was called “the cleverest tackle of his time on defense.”\n\n“(Link) Lyman was a linebacker and was the best all-around lineman I ever played against.” —said Cal Hubbard in 1976.\n\n“Lyman was the first lineman I ever saw who moved from his assigned defensive position before the ball was snapped. It was difficult to play against him because he would vary his moves and no matter how you reacted, you could be wrong.”—Steve Owen, former NFL lineman and Giants Hall of Fame coach.\n\n“Link Lyman, ranked head and shoulders above any other tackle in Joe Carr’s ‘cash and carry’ gridiron wheel…Lyman’s comeback was most remarkable and some coaches claim Link’s work this placed him on a higher plan than Cal Hubbard, former Packers lineman, who was considered the peer of all tackles in the land. It was next to impossible to take Lyman out of a plat and he would cut holes a mile wide for the Bears backs.”—wrote G. W. Calhoun of the Green Bay Press-Gazette, when naming Lyman First-team All-Pro in 1934 at the age of 36.\n\n“The greatest football player, college or pro, I ever saw was Link Lyman. If it hadn’t been for Lyman, nobody ever would have heard of poor Bill Hewitt at all. He taught me more about football than I ever learned in my life before.”—Bill Hewitt, former Bears Hall of Fame end.\n\n4)Albert G. “Turk” Edwards (1932-1940) Another Hall of Famer, the 6-2, 255-pound Edwards played 9 years (86 games) with the Boston-Washington Redskins, helping protect Sammy Baugh and opening holes for halfback Cliff Battles from his left tackle spot…consistently showed raw power and intimidation; emphasized strength more than speed…”I stood up a little more than they do now, but otherwise the techniques haven’t changed,” said Edwards to sportswriter Murray Olderman…selected to NFL 1930s All-Decade Team…Numerous First-team All-Pros; including 4 times by the NFL (1932-33, 1936-37) and 3 times by UP (1934, 1936-37) and Chicago Daily News (1933-34, 1936); also twice First-team by Collyers (1937-38), I.N.S. (1937, 1939), New York Daily News (1937, 1939), Green Bay Press-Gazette (1933, 1935) and Boston Post (1934-35)…Named Second-team three times by NFL (1934, 1938-39); and once by Collyers (1932), UPI (1933), GBPG (1934), and NYDN (1938)…Elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1969…Member of 3 divisional winning teams and 1 NFL Championship, 1937 Redskins…career ended on an unusual knee injury during a coin toss against the Giants in 1940…scored 2 career touchdowns, including returning a block punt for a score in a 7-0 victory over the Dodgers in 1932…known for blocking punts, (including 3 in a game against the Giants in 1937, to help clinch the Division title)…nicknamed the “Rock of Gibralter” because he played with such immovable and impregnable tendencies…amiable and easy going Edwards was all business on the gridiron. “When he got mad, which was rarely, he could play the whole side of the line himself,” recalled Wayne Millner, Redskins Hall of Fame end and teammate…after playing career, went into coaching, was Redskins head coach for 3 seasons (overall record of 16-18-1) in 1946-1948.\n\n“(Turk) Edwards was plenty tough and liked it. For a big fellow he had lots of speed and often was down the field as fast as his ends.”—wrote the Green Bay Press-Gazette, naming Edwards First-team All-Pro in 1933.\n\n“I considered Turk Edwards the greatest tackle who ever lived- college or pro. He could handle anyone. I’ve seen him on defense pick up an opposing lineman and throw him backward and break up a single wing sweep before it even got started. He was absolutely awesome.”—Mel Hein, former Giants Hall of Fame center, about Edwards in 1969.\n\n“Edwards was a great tackle, he was just a bull of tackle, hard to block. I knew he was going to be hard to block right from the beginning. He was hard to handle, offense and defense. Turk is one of the best.”—George Musso, former Bears Hall of Fame lineman.\n\n“Turk was the biggest man on the field and the fastest lineman on the field. He was a really good leader. He was captain of our team.”—Clyde Shugart, former Redskins teammate and guard.\n\n5)Joe Stydahar (1936-1942, 1945-1946) “Jumbo Joe” was a mainstay for the Monsters of the Midway. The rather large, 6-4, 233-pounder was the Bears first ever 1st-round draft pick, in 1936, and was a starter for 9 years (84 games)- although he missed 2 years due to WWII (1943-1944)….Member of 3 NFL Championship squads with the Bears, 1940-41, 1946, protecting Sid Luckman and paving rushing lanes for backs George MacAfee and Bronko Nagurski with a bulldozing style, throwing around his 233-pound frame…Better on defense than offense, Stydahar was a hard-hitter on the Bears front line. “When you charge, you have to keep your head up. Sure, you lose a lot of teeth that way, but you make a lot of tackles,” once said Stydahar…selected to NFL 1930s All-Decade team…First-team All-Pro four times by the NFL (1937-40), Collyers (1936-37, 1939-40), and New York Daily News (1937-40); three times by UPI (1937-39) and two times by I.N.S. (1938, 1940) and Ray Flaherty (1936, 1938)…Second-team three times by NFL (1936, 1941-42); twice by I.N.S. (1937, 1942); and once by UPI (1936), Collyers (1938), AP (1941)…Elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967.\n\n“It helped me tremendously to play next to Joe for so many years. A true partnership built up. We got to know exactly what to expect from one another.”—Dan Fortmann, former teammate and Hall of Fame guard.\n\n6)Duke Slater (1922-1931) Dominate tackle during his ten-year career in the NFL, playing for Milwaukee, Rock Island and Chicago Cardinals (90 games)…One of the early black players in the NFL…The 6-1, 215 Slater was hard to block on defense, making many tackles at or behind the line of scrimmage, while on offense one of the hardest to get around…Voted First-team All-Pro by Collyers in 1922, 1925; Second-team, 1930…Voted Second-team All-Pro by Green Bay Press-Gazette, six times, 1923-1925, 1927, 1929-1930…First-team twice by Chicago Tribune (1926, 1929) and once by the Chicago Daily Times, Red Grange and Ernie Nevers, all in 1930. In 1931 Lavvie Dilweg selected Slater for his All-Opponent Team…Leroy Andrews named him First Team in 1927 and Second Team in 1929…On Dec. 8, 1929 scored his only NFL touchdown with the Cardinals on an interception returned in a 26-0 victory over the Orange Tornadoes…blocked for Cardinals fullback Ernie Nevers when Nevers scored 6 rushing TDs (his 40-point game) in 1929 vs the Bears…Twice a Hall of Fame Finalist, 1970-1971…a crime that he’s not in the Hall of Fame.\n\n“In the old Cardinals-Bears games, I learned it was absolutely useless to run against (Duke) Slater’s side of the Cardinal line.\"—George Halas on Slater.\n\n“They can bring all the tackles in the country, but this fellow [Duke] Slater is the best of them all. Slater is a marvel and is so strong and powerful that he seems to sweep one-half of the line aside when he charges. I’ve played against Slater, and I know what I’m talking about.”— Red Grange on Slater.\n\n“Slater makes the most of his position: is powerful, has huge hands, is very seldom caught, and hasn’t slowed a bit in the 6 years I have played opposite to him.”—wrote Lavvie Dilweg in the Green Bay Press-Gazette in naming Slater to his 1931 All-Opponent Team.\n\n“Duke Slater, the veteran colored tackle, seemed the dominant figure in that forward wall which had the Bear front wobbly. It was Slater who opened the holes for Nevers when a touchdown was in the making.” —from Chicago Herald-Examiner, Nov. 29, 1929, on the day Cardinals fullback Ernie Nevers scored 40-points.\n\n“Duke was a helluva body blocker and you couldn’t play him outside nor inside because he was big and quick and could easily sideswipe you out of the play with his body block.” —Hunk Anderson, former Bears lineman.\n\n7)George Christensen (1931-1938)Nicknamed “Big Chris,” the rather large, 6-2, 238-pound Christensen, played 8 seasons (95 games) with the Portsmouth Spartans-Detroit Lions…Voted to NFL 1930s All-Decade Team…Member of one NFL Championship team, 1935 Lions…Either First- or Second-team All-Pro by the NFL or UPI, five times, 1932-1936…Twice named First-team All-Pro by the Green Bay Press-Gazette, 1931, 1933 and Collyers, 1933-1934…Lions team captain who also served as line coach while playing…big, fast, athletic tackle, who would sometime pull on end runs for halfbacks Ernie Caddell, Dutch Clark and Glenn Presnell in Potsy Clark’s single-wing offense…was part of offensive line that established NFL record for rushing yards in a single-season with2,885 yards (in 12 games), a record that stood until 1972 when the Miami Dolphins broke it (in a 14-game season)…just like Duke Slater, no reason he’s not in the Hall of Fame.\n\nGood tackles were numerous with Christensen of Portsmouth the best of the lot. This husky Spartan was a demon on the attack while on the defense, he raised havoc with every club Potsy Clark’s hirelings bumped into this past season.”—wrote George W. Calhoun Green Bay Press-Gazette, wrote in 1933 after naming Christensen to All-Pro team.\n\n“On our club was a tackle who I think should be in the Hall of Fame.
