        "text": "Former Washington Redskins Guard Rod Milstead, who also played for the Super Bowl XXIX Champion San Fransisco 49ers, spoke at the Charles County Family Recovery and Juvenile Drug Court Annual Fundraiser in La Plata on Thursday afternoon. Milstead spoke to youth about making responsible decisions.\n\nMilstead, who grew up in Charles County, spoke about his professional football career, which includes a Super Bowl ring. He also spoke about his life and the challenges he faced growing up and how his parents helped him get there. After he graduated from Lackey High School, he went to college at Delaware State University. Once he graduated college, he went on to play football where he was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nMilstead says people should always write new goals once they’ve accomplished their goals. Milstead now works with at -risk youths. He says it’s satisfying to work with children and help them turn their lives around.\n\nA client of the program also shared her story of drug abuse. She said she had used many drugs and had a child but said reality hit her when the Department of Social Services took her child away from her and placed it in foster care. At that point, she made an effort to clean herself. Now, she is engaged to the father of her child, she has custody of her child again and her case is almost closed.\n\nCharles County Commissioner Vice President Reuben Collins (D) and Commissioner Debra Davis (D: 2nd) attended the fundraiser and also made remarks. Pastor John Lewis of Servants of Christ Ministries in La Plata also made remarks.\n\nRelated"
