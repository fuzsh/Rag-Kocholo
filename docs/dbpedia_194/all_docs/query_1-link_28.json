        "text": "As part of ESPN's year-long initiative marking the 150-year anniversary of college football, we set out to rank the 150 greatest college football single-season teams of all time.\n\nThe panel of 150 media members, athletic administrators and former players and coaches selected these teams from 210 finalists initially identified by ESPN's Stats & Information group.\n\nThe voters went for national champions galore -- undefeated champions, one-loss champions and, at the very top, rarely tested champions. But not every team here finished No. 1. The highest-ranked one-loss team, at No. 31, is remembered for the game it didn't win.\n\nThe final list represents an array of styles but a commonality of substance, and the teams range from one that played 131 years ago to two squads that suited up as recently as 2018.\n\nYou'll likely find a team you once loved. You'll definitely find a ranking you don't love at all. -- Ivan Maisel\n\n1. 1971 Nebraska (13-0)\n\nCoach: Bob Devaney\n\nThe Huskers held 10 of their 13 opponents to seven points or fewer. Only No. 2 Oklahoma scored more than 17. On Thanksgiving Day, the Huskers beat the Sooners 35-31 in a \"Game of the Century.\" Nebraska crushed No. 2 Alabama 38-6 in the Orange Bowl. The only other ranked opponent, No. 9 Colorado, went down 31-7. Nebraska, Oklahoma, Colorado and Alabama finished 1-2-3-4 that season, which meant the Huskers defeated the next three in the final poll, routing two of them. Defensive lineman Larry Jacobsen won the Outland Trophy. Jacobsen, fellow D-lineman Willie Harper and Johnny Rodgers -- a receiver, running back and return specialist -- made the consensus All-America team. Rodgers' 71-yard punt return for a touchdown against Oklahoma is remembered to this day; however, he didn't win the Heisman Trophy until 1972.\n\n2. 2004 USC (13-0)\n\nCoach: Pete Carroll\n\nThe Trojans won their second straight national championship, remaining No. 1 from wire to wire, capping it off by stunning No. 2 Oklahoma 55-19 for the BCS title in the Orange Bowl. Quarterback Matt Leinart won the Heisman Trophy, the Walter Camp Award and the Manning Award.\n\nAll-purpose star Reggie Bush, linebacker Matt Grootegoed and defensive linemen Shaun Cody joined Leinart as consensus All-Americans. The Trojans won three of their four Pac-10 road games by eight points or fewer but still had an average margin of victory of 38-13. In a season with three undefeated teams (Auburn was the other) and a year after the BCS snubbed the Trojans, they came into the Orange Bowl with a point to make. USC dominated the game from the opening kickoff.\n\n3. 1972 USC (12-0)\n\nCoach: John McKay\n\nThe Trojans won their third national title in 11 seasons under McKay with a performance memorable for its dominance. They zoomed from No. 8 to No. 1 with an opening 31-10 win versus No. 4 Arkansas in Little Rock. And they never left the top spot. USC won every game by at least nine points. They beat six ranked opponents. They scored at least 30 points in 10 games. And they crushed No. 3 Ohio State 42-17 in the Rose Bowl. It was a team of future stars -- only tight end Charles Young made All-American -- and yet the names are recognizable to anyone who paid attention to the NFL of the mid-to-late 1970s. The leading rusher was sophomore Anthony Davis (1,191 yards, 17 touchdowns). And the leading receiver was junior Lynn Swann, who averaged 20 yards per catch; his problem was he caught only 27 passes.\n\n4. 1995 Nebraska (12-0)\n\nCoach: Tom Osborne\n\nThe Huskers were the only national champion since 1950 to win each game by at least 14 points. Nebraska scored at least 35 points in every game and set an NCAA record by rushing for 7.0 yards per attempt. There would be no on-field controversy for the Huskers, but there was plenty off the field. Osborne took a lot of heat for not throwing tailback Lawrence Phillips off the team after Phillips was arrested for assaulting a Huskers women's basketball player in the apartment of teammate Scott Frost. Osborne suspended Phillips for six games and brought him back late in the season. Freshman Ahman Green rushed for 1,086 yards and 13 touchdowns in Phillips' place. Nebraska defeated Florida 62-24 in the Fiesta Bowl for the national championship, a game remembered for Tommie Frazier's epic 75-yard touchdown run. Frazier broke seven tackles as he churned down the sideline. Frazier finished second in the Heisman vote that year to Ohio State's Eddie George and was the Huskers' only first-team All-American that season.\n\n5. 2018 Clemson (15-0)\n\nCoach: Dabo Swinney\n\nThe Tigers routed defending national champion Alabama 44-16 in the College Football Playoff championship (the fourth straight year the teams met in the playoff) to become the first 15-0 team since 1897. Clemson dominated thanks to a coming-of-age season by freshman quarterback Trevor Lawrence, who took over as starter for Kelly Bryant in the fifth game. That might be why Clemson won its last 10 games by at least 20 points. The offense averaged 526 yards per game, but the defense, which held eight teams to 10 points or fewer, carried the load. Clemson gave up 13 points per game, best in the nation, and 291 yards per game, sixth in the FBS. Two veteran defensive linemen won national awards: Clelin Ferrell took the Hendricks Award as best DE, and Christian Wilkins earned the Campbell Trophy as the best student-athlete. Ferrell, Wilkins and offensive lineman Mitch Hyatt made the consensus All-America team. The Tigers won their fourth consecutive ACC title, a school first.\n\n6. 2005 Texas (13-0)\n\nCoach: Mack Brown\n\nThe No. 2 Longhorns upset No. 1 USC 41-38 in the BCS title game at the Rose Bowl, ending the Trojans' 34-game winning streak and blunting their quest not only for a third straight national title, but to be considered the most dominant team in the history of the game. Texas won thanks to the performance of All-American quarterback Vince Young, who threw for 267 yards and ran for 200.\n\nYoung scored the winning touchdown with 19 seconds left, capping the Horns' 12-point comeback in the final four minutes. Young won the Manning and O'Brien quarterback awards, in addition to the Maxwell Award as the game's best player. But he finished runner-up to USC tailback Reggie Bush for the Heisman, and the slight spurred Young and Texas into the Rose Bowl. Texas averaged 50.2 points, scoring at least 40 in 12 games. Texas embarrassed Colorado 70-3 in the Big 12 title game. Safety Michael Huff, like Young a consensus All-American, won the Thorpe Award. Defensive lineman Rodrique Wright and offensive lineman Jonathan Scott also were consensus All-Americans.\n\n7. 2001 Miami (12-0)\n\nCoach: Larry Coker (national coach of the year as first-year HC)\n\nThe Hurricanes extended the winning streak that began in 2000 to 22 games. They held eight opponents to fewer than 10 points en route to humiliating Nebraska 37-14 in the BCS title game in the Rose Bowl. The Canes led 34-0 at halftime. Quarterback Ken Dorsey won the Maxwell Award. Offensive tackle Bryant McKinnie, the Outland Trophy winner, and safety Ed Reed, a Hall of Famer in the college and pro ranks, were consensus All-Americans. Tight end Jeremy Shockey, offensive tackle Joaquin Gonzalez and corner Phillip Buchanon also made at least one All-America team.\n\n8. 1979 Alabama (12-0)\n\nCoach: Paul \"Bear\" Bryant\n\nThe sixth and last of Bryant's national champions, unlike his No. 1 teams in 1964, 1965, 1973 and 1978, left no room for argument. The Crimson Tide shut out five teams and held five more to fewer than 10 points. The wishbone remained unsolvable, even though Bryant had employed it for nine seasons. Alabama averaged 69 rushes and 10 passes per game. Only offensive lineman Jim Bunch made the All-America team, a commentary on Bryant's belief in depth. The Tide averaged 344 rushing yards per game, yet senior quarterback Steadman Shealy led the team with 791 rushing yards. Five other backs gained at least 230 yards. Only SEC rivals LSU (3-0) and Auburn (25-18) came within a touchdown, and the 24-9 defeat of Lou Holtz's No. 9 Arkansas in the Sugar Bowl seemed more like a coronation.\n\n9. 1956 Oklahoma (10-0)\n\nCoach: Bud Wilkinson\n\nThe Sooners repeated as national champs with a third straight undefeated season. Their last victory, 53-0 over Oklahoma State, stretched their winning streak to 40 games. Oklahoma shut out six of their 10 opponents and gave up only 5.1 points per game. No, they didn't play a ranked opponent, but the nonconference schedule included North Carolina, Notre Dame and, of course, Texas. The Sooners beat those three teams by a combined 121-0. They were so good that they prevented one of their own from winning the Heisman Trophy. Lineman Jerry Tubbs and back Tommy McDonald were both All-Americans and both finished in the top five of Heisman voting. It was one of the screwy reasons that allowed Paul Hornung of the 2-8 Irish to take home the award. McDonald did win the Maxwell Trophy.\n\n10. 2009 Alabama (14-0)\n\nCoach: Nick Saban\n\nThe Crimson Tide team that won the first of five national championships in nine seasons for Saban remains the only one of his No. 1s to finish the season undefeated. The Tide, stung in the fourth quarter of the SEC championship game by eventual national champ Florida the previous year, used that loss to spur them on through a schedule that included six ranked teams. Their two toughest victories came against unranked archrivals -- a 12-10 win over Tennessee in which All-American defensive tackle Terrence Cody blocked a field goal attempt on the last play of the game, and a 26-21 comeback win at Auburn. The Tide followed that win by dominating their two highest-ranked opponents: a 32-13 defeat of No. 1 Florida in the conference title game and a wild 37-21 defeat of Texas in the BCS title game at the Rose Bowl. Tailback Mark Ingram, the Tide's first Heisman winner, joined Cody and three other teammates -- linebacker Rolando McClain (Butkus winner), offensive tackle Mike Johnson and defensive back Javier Arenas -- on the consensus All-America team.\n\n11. 1987 Miami (12-0)\n\nCoach: Jimmy Johnson\n\nAfter coming close to winning the national championship in the previous two seasons, the Hurricanes reached the top by defeating six ranked teams, including a 20-14 defeat of No. 1 Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl (the game wasn't that close; the Sooners scored a late touchdown on a fumblerooski). Miami had the advantage of playing eight home games, including their last six (the Orange Bowl was certainly a home game). But their most memorable victory came on the road, a 26-25 decision at No. 4 Florida State in which the Canes overcame a 19-3 deficit. Safety Bennie Blades, the Jim Thorpe Award winner and a College Football Hall of Famer, and defensive lineman Daniel Stubbs made the consensus All-America team. The offense, under first-year starter Steve Walsh at quarterback, scored more than 40 points in five of the first seven games, and it didn't score more than 27 in the final five. But that's all Miami needed: The Canes gave up only 10.4 points per game.\n\n12. 1999 Florida State (12-0)\n\nCoach: Bobby Bowden\n\nUnlike Bowden's first national champion six years earlier, these Seminoles left little room for doubt. They won their eighth consecutive ACC title (in eight years in the league) and defeated five ranked teams, including No. 2 Virginia Tech 46-29 in a humdinger of a Sugar Bowl. The Seminoles went wire to wire as No. 1. Only unranked Clemson held Florida State to fewer than 31 points. That might have had something to do with the Tigers' being coached by Tommy Bowden, Bobby's son, in the first \"Bowden Bowl.\" That win was Bobby's 300th. Wide receiver Peter Warrick had a real shot at the Heisman as a wide receiver/kick returner, until he was suspended for two games for shoplifting at a local mall. Warrick \"settled\" for being a consensus All-American, along with offensive lineman Jason Whitaker, kicker Sebastian Janikowski and defensive end Corey Simon. Against the Hokies, Warrick caught scoring passes of 64 and 43 yards and returned a punt 59 yards for a score.\n\n13. 1968 Ohio State (10-0)\n\nCoach: Woody Hayes\n\nA precocious group of sophomores (remember, freshmen weren't yet eligible) matured over the course of the season into Hayes' third national champion. The young players learned as they went. They won at unranked Illinois and at unranked Iowa by less than a touchdown. But the Buckeyes also beat three top-four teams by double digits. They closed the season with a 50-14 rout of No. 4 Michigan (Hayes famously went for two to reach 50) and, in the Rose Bowl, a 27-16 defeat of No. 2 USC. Only offensive lineman Dave Foley made the All-America team, but among the sophomores were future College Football Hall of Famers Rex Kern at quarterback and Jack Tatum at defensive back, 1970 Outland/Lombardi winner Jim Stillwagon and running back John Brockington. Five would be taken in the first round of the 1971 NFL draft.\n\n14. 1974 Oklahoma (11-0)\n\nCoach: Barry Switzer\n\nIn only his second season as head coach, the 37-year-old Switzer led Oklahoma to its first national title in 18 seasons. The Sooners won it with a powerful wishbone offense and a defense that held every opponent to no more than 14 points. Only archrival Texas challenged Oklahoma, which won that game 16-13. The only other opponent to come within 14 points was OU's other rival, Nebraska. The Sooners won that one, in Lincoln, 28-14. Only the NCAA slowed the Sooners that year. Probation prevented Oklahoma from playing in a bowl or winning the coaches' poll (USC finished No. 1 there). Halfback Joe Washington, offensive lineman John Roush and linebacker Rod Shoate made the All-America team; Washington and Shoate are in the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\n15. 1994 Nebraska (13-0)\n\nCoach: Tom Osborne\n\nThe Huskers climbed the mountain for the first time since 1971 in Osborne's 22nd season as head coach. They won the title with an explosive offense, led by two quarterbacks: Tommie Frazier and -- after Frazier missed half the season because of a blood clot in his leg -- Brook Berringer. Nebraska won its first 12 games by at least 10 points, then concluded the season by defeating No. 3 Miami 24-17 in the Orange Bowl (the Canes' home field) with a physically dominant fourth quarter. Nebraska had always been strong. Osborne saw what Miami and Florida State did with speed in the late 1980s and early 1990s and made his defense faster too. That said, the Huskers proved themselves stronger in that fourth quarter, methodically grinding out two touchdown drives for a comeback win. Frazier returned from injury for the game. Berringer replaced him in the first half, and Frazier came back in the decisive fourth quarter. Offensive linemen Zach Wiegert, one of three consensus All-Americans on the team, won the Outland Trophy. Fellow lineman Brenden Stai and linebacker Ed Stewart joined him as All-Americans.\n\n16. 1994 Penn State (12-0)\n\nCoach: Joe Paterno\n\nThis might have been JoePa's best team, even if the voters snubbed the Nittany Lions in favor of Nebraska. Penn State averaged 47 points (and never fewer than 31), thanks to an offense led by quarterback Kerry Collins, tailback Ki-Jana Carter and tight end Kyle Brady, all of whom were selected among the first 10 players in the 1995 NFL draft. The Nittany Lions defeated four ranked teams and beat nine opponents by at least 18 points. Their gutsiest victory came at Illinois, where they spotted the Illini a 21-0 lead before coming back to win 35-31. But the victory that might have cost them the national championship occurred a week earlier at Indiana. Penn State led 35-14 when JoePa began playing his subs. The Hoosiers' scored two late touchdowns for a 35-29 final that made the game appear close. Penn State dropped from No. 1 to No. 2 and never caught Nebraska. Collins and Carter made the consensus All-America team. Collins won the Maxwell and O'Brien awards, and wide receiver Bobby Engram won the Biletnikoff Award.\n\n17. 1969 Texas (11-0)\n\nCoach: Darrell Royal\n\nUsing the newfangled wishbone offense that Longhorns assistant Emory Bellard had created the previous year, Texas extended its winning streak to 20 games with impressive dominance. Only No. 8 Oklahoma (27-17) came within 10 points of Texas until the season finale, a showdown at No. 2 Arkansas. ABC moved the game from its usual October date with the hope that both teams would be undefeated. Not only did that happen, but Michigan's 24-12 upset of season-long No. 1 Ohio State cleared the way for Texas and Arkansas to be ranked 1-2. Texas scored 15 points in the fourth quarter to win 15-14 and closed out the season with a 21-17 defeat of No. 9 Notre Dame in the Cotton Bowl, the Fighting Irish's first bowl game in 44 seasons. Only offensive lineman Bob McKay (a future College Football Hall of Famer) made the All-America team. The Longhorns averaged 68 rushes and 13 passes per game. Yet with nine backs rushing for at least 200 yards, Jim Bertelsen led the team with only 740 rushing yards.\n\n18. 1988 Notre Dame (12-0)\n\nCoach: Lou Holtz\n\nThe Fighting Irish won their first national title in 11 seasons (and, at this writing, their most recent) with a stifling defense and a punishing ground game. Notre Dame won 10 games by at least 10 points, including its last two games, a 27-10 dismantling of No. 2 USC in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the 34-21 defeat of undefeated No. 2 West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl. This Irish team, however, will be best remembered for its other defeat of a top-3 team, the 31-30 victory over No. 1 Miami in South Bend, Indiana. The Irish won by stopping a two-point conversion late in the game. Miami coach Jimmy Johnson maintains to this day that instant replay would have overruled a called fumble by Canes running back Cleveland Gary at the Irish goal line. Defensive lineman Frank Stams and linebacker Michael Stonebreaker made the consensus All-America team. Sophomore quarterback Tony Rice led the team with 700 rushing yards and threw for nearly 1,200 more. His poise, despite his inexperience, justified Holtz's belief in him.\n\n19. 1955 Oklahoma (10-0)\n\nCoach: Bud Wilkinson\n\nThe Sooners dominated every team in their path, extending their three-season winning streak to 30 games. After opening with a 13-6 victory at North Carolina, Oklahoma won its next nine games by at least 12 points. In fact, the Sooners shut out their last four regular-season opponents. The Orange Bowl against No. 3 Maryland showcased Wilkinson against his mentor, former OU head coach Jim Tatum. The Terps had finished No. 1 two years earlier. When Maryland scored in the second quarter to take a 6-0 halftime lead, it was the first points Oklahoma had given up since Oct. 29. The Sooners controlled the second half, winning easily, 20-6. Lineman Bo Bolinger represented the Sooners on the consensus All-America team.\n\n20. 1991 Miami (12-0)\n\nCoach: Dennis Erickson\n\nThe Canes won their second AP national title in three seasons under Erickson pretty much as Miami had won in 1987 under Jimmy Johnson: with a dominant defense and an explosive, balanced offense. Defensive back Darryl Williams and kicker Carlos Huerta made the consensus All-America team. Miami led the nation by giving up only 8.3 points per game; you had to be ranked in the top 10 to score more than 14. No. 9 Penn State fell 26-20 (in a game in which the telecast was partially preempted by the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice nominee Clarence Thomas). More famous was the Canes' 17-16 victory at No. 1 Florida State, known forever as Wide Right I. Seminoles kicker Gerry Thomas' 34-yard field goal attempt drifted just to the right in the first season after the NCAA narrowed the goal post by some six feet. Miami embarrassed No. 11 Nebraska 22-0 in the Orange Bowl and shared the national title with Washington.\n\n21. 1992 Alabama (13-0)\n\nCoach: Gene Stallings (unanimous coach of the year)\n\nThe only people who believed No. 2 Alabama would topple the undefeated defending national champion No. 1 Miami Hurricanes in the Sugar Bowl wore Crimson. But the Crimson Tide did so with surprising ease, a 34-13 rout in which Alabama displayed the suffocating defense that it had played all season. The Tide led the nation in total defense (184.7 yards per game) and scoring defense (9.1 points per game). Miami was one of only three opponents to score more than 11 points all season. Defensive ends John Copeland and Eric Curry both made the consensus All-America team. Alabama reached the Sugar Bowl by winning the first conference championship game in any league, a 28-21 defeat of Florida sealed by corner Antonio Langham's pick-six in the final minutes. If the Gators had cost the No. 1 Tide a chance at a national title, the concept of the championship game probably would have been dismissed as a short-term money grab. Instead, it became the norm.\n\n22. 1976 Pittsburgh (12-0)\n\nCoach: Johnny Majors (coaches and writers voted him Coach of the Year)\n\nThe Panthers cruised to their first national title since 1937 by steamrollering nearly every opponent. Only West Virginia came within eight points of the Panthers, who didn't become No. 1 until only three games remained, two of them against ranked teams. The Panthers defeated cross-state rival No. 16 Penn State 24-7, then routed No. 5 Georgia in the Sugar Bowl 27-3. Senior tailback Tony Dorsett, who won the Heisman, the Maxwell and the Walter Camp, capped a remarkable collegiate career by rushing for 2,150 yards and 22 touchdowns. Quarterback Matt Cavanaugh didn't throw much -- the Panthers ran on nearly 80% of their snaps -- but he still finished seventh in the Heisman vote. Defensive lineman Al Romano joined Dorsett on the consensus All-American team.\n\n23. 1991 Washington (12-0)\n\nCoach: Don James\n\nThe coaches voted the Huskies national champions, the second consecutive year in which the coaches disagreed with the media vote, because Washington beat 11 of its 12 opponents by at least 11 points and because their three wins over ranked teams came away from home. In fact, they beat two top-10 teams on the road, not to mention the 34-14 rout of No. 4 Michigan in the Rose Bowl. After an early-season 36-21 victory at No. 9 Nebraska, their toughest challenge came at No. 7 California, where the Huskies won 24-17. That Cal team finished 10-2. Washington won with an impenetrable defense led by defensive tackle Steve Emtman, the Outland and Lombardi winner. The Huskies gave up only 237 yards of total offense per game, including a rush defense that allowed only 67 yards per game. Wide receiver Mario Bailey joined Emtman on the consensus All-America team.\n\n24. 1997 Nebraska (13-0)\n\nCoach: Tom Osborne\n\nThe third and final national champion coached by Osborne (he retired after the season) didn't dominate the way the 1994 and 1995 teams did. The Huskers shared the national championship with undefeated Michigan. Nebraska won the coaches' vote, which some saw as a going-away bouquet for Osborne from his peers, especially because the Huskers needed the miracle \"flea-kicker\" play for a 45-38 overtime win at Missouri. But Nebraska did win 11 games by at least 10 points, and the Huskers blew out their four ranked opponents by a combined 179-72, closing the season with a 54-15 rout of No. 14 Texas A&M in the initial Big 12 title game and an equally one-sided 42-17 rout of No. 3 Tennessee in the Orange Bowl. Versatile offensive lineman Aaron Taylor won the Outland Trophy. Defensive end Grant Wistrom won the Lombardi Award. They were joined on the consensus All-America team by defensive lineman Jason Peter.\n\n25. 2000 Oklahoma (13-0)\n\nCoach: Bob Stoops\n\nLike Barry Switzer, Stoops won a national championship in his second season. Unlike Switzer, Stoops -- who swept the coach of the year awards -- had a team that snuck up on everyone. Oklahoma's 7-5 record the previous year was its first winning record since 1993. But the Sooners proved themselves by defeating four teams ranked eighth or better and six ranked teams overall. The offense, directed by Mark Mangino, spread the field and threw it, scoring at least 31 points in the first nine games. The defense, led by consensus All-Americans Rocky Calmus (linebacker) and J.T. Thatcher (defensive back), came up big in the BCS title game against No. 3 Florida State. The Sooners wanted to shut down the Seminoles because Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke had beaten out Oklahoma quarterback Josh Heupel for the Heisman Trophy, even as Heupel made the consensus All-America team. Oklahoma held Florida State to no points and 27 rushing yards in a 13-2 victory.\n\nJump to: Legend for polls that decided titles\n\n26. 1986 Penn State (12-0)\n\nTitles: AP, FWAA, NFF, USA/CNN, UPI\n\nCoach: Joe Paterno\n\nLed by: RB D.J.

Texas won five of its last six regular-season games by a touchdown or less, including a 7-0 victory over Baylor, in which two-way star Carlisle made a leaping interception in the end zone to preserve the win.\n\n28. 1973 Notre Dame (11-0)\n\nTitles: AP, FWAA, NFF (Alabama won coaches)\n\nCoach: Ara Parseghian\n\nLed by: QB Tom Clements, TE Dave Casper\n\nWhat to know: Defeated No. 6 USC and No. 20 Pittsburgh, and No. 1 Alabama in the Sugar Bowl. Against the Crimson Tide, Notre Dame rallied from deficits three times, falling behind 23-21 on a halfback-to-quarterback pass. But Clements led the Irish on a 79-yard scoring drive in which his 30-yard pass to Casper set up a go-ahead field goal.\n\n29. 2013 Florida State (14-0)\n\nTitles: BCS\n\nCoach: Jimbo Fisher\n\nLed by: QB Jameis Winston, LB Telvin Smith\n\nWhat to know: Defeated No. 25 Maryland, No. 3 Clemson and No. 20 Duke, and No. 2 Auburn in the BCS National Championship at the Rose Bowl.

Arguably the best team to not win a national championship, USC's only blemish in 1979 was a 21-21 tie against Stanford. The Trojans beat four ranked opponents by an average of eight points, and White won the Heisman Trophy by running for 2,050 yards.\n\n31. 1971 Oklahoma (11-1)\n\nTitles: None (Nebraska won AP and UPI)\n\nCoach: Chuck Fairbanks\n\nLed by: RB Greg Pruitt, QB Jack Mildren\n\nWhat to know: Defeated No. 17 USC, No. 3 Texas, and No. 6 Colorado, and No. 5 Auburn in the Sugar Bowl. While utilizing offensive coordinator Barry Switzer's wishbone offense, the Sooners set an NCAA record with 472.4 rushing yards per game. Their only setback was a 35-31 loss to No. 1 Nebraska in the \"Game of the Century.\"\n\n32. 1985 Oklahoma (11-1)\n\nTitles: AP, FWAA, NFF, USA/CNN, UPI\n\nCoach: Barry Switzer\n\nLed by: LB Brian Bosworth, NG Tony Casillas, QB Jamelle Holieway\n\nWhat to know: Beat No. 17 Texas, No. 2 Nebraska and No. 17 Oklahoma State, and No. 1 Penn State in the Orange Bowl. The Sooners' only loss came against Miami, after they lost quarterback Troy Aikman to injury. Holieway took over the wishbone offense and won the next eight games. OU's defense held nine opponents to 10 points or fewer.\n\n33. 1980 Georgia (12-0)\n\nTitles: AP, FWAA, NFF, UPI\n\nCoach: Vince Dooley\n\nLed by: RB Herschel Walker, WR Lindsay Scott, CB Scott Woerner\n\nWhat to know: Defeated No. 14 South Carolina, No. 20 Florida and No. 7 Notre Dame in the Sugar Bowl. Walker set an NCAA freshman rushing record with 1,616 yards and gained 200 yards or more in four games. Georgia's national title hopes were saved by Buck Belue's 93-yard touchdown pass to Scott in the final minutes of a 26-21 win over Florida.\n\n34. 2002 Ohio State (14-0)\n\nTitles: BCS\n\nCoach: Jim Tressel\n\nLed by: RB Maurice Clarett, WR Michael Jenkins, S Mike Doss\n\nWhat to know: The Buckeyes defeated five ranked teams, including No. 1 Miami in two overtimes in the Fiesta Bowl to win the school's first national championship since 1968. OSU won several close games over Cincinnati (23-19), Wisconsin (19-14), Penn State (13-7), Purdue (10-6), Illinois (23-16 in overtime) and Michigan (14-9) to finish unbeaten in the regular season.\n\n35. 1998 Tennessee (13-0)\n\nTitles: BCS\n\nCoach: Phillip Fulmer\n\nLed by: QB Tee Martin, WR Peerless Price, LB Al Wilson\n\nWhat to know: A year after losing quarterback Peyton Manning to the NFL, the Volunteers defeated six ranked opponents, including No. 2 Florida State in the first BCS National Championship, to win their first national title since 1951. Tennessee went unbeaten in the SEC for the first time since 1967, after ending a five-game losing streak to rival Florida.\n\n36. 1983 Nebraska (12-1)\n\nTitles: None (Miami won AP and UPI)\n\nCoach: Tom Osborne\n\nLed by: RB Mike Rozier, WR Irving Fryar, G Dean Steinkuhler\n\nWhat to know: The Cornhuskers, dubbed the \"Scoring Explosion,\" had one of the most prolific offenses in college football history, averaging 52 points in their first 12 games and scoring 654 points for the season. The Huskers were ranked No. 1 from wire to wire until losing to Miami on a failed two-point conversion attempt in a 31-30 loss in the Orange Bowl. Nebraska might have won at least a share of the national title if Osborne had settled for a tie.\n\n37. 1949 Oklahoma (11-0)\n\nTitles: None (Notre Dame won AP)\n\nCoach: Bud Wilkinson\n\nLed by: E Jim Owens, QB Darrell Royal, T Wade Walker\n\nWhat to know: The Sooners gave up only eight points per game and shut out five opponents, including a 35-0 victory over No. 9 LSU in the Sugar Bowl. They won the Big Six Conference title and outscored their opponents by a combined total of 399-88, but still finished No. 2 behind the Irish in the final AP poll. The team included two future head coaches: Royal (most famously at Texas) and Owens (Washington).\n\n38. 1966 Alabama (11-0)\n\nTitles: None (Notre Dame won AP and coaches; Notre Dame and Michigan State shared NFF)\n\nCoach: Paul \"Bear\" Bryant\n\nLed by: QB Ken Stabler, WR Ray Perkins\n\nWhat to know: Alabama didn't play a ranked opponent during the regular season, and gave up only four points per game with six shutouts.

The Tigers gave up only 8.8 points per game and gave up eight points or fewer in seven games.\n\n41. 2010 Auburn (14-0)\n\nTitles: BCS\n\nCoach: Gene Chizik\n\nLed by: QB Cam Newton, DT Nick Fairley, RB Michael Dyer\n\nWhat to know: Newton, the Heisman Trophy winner, guided Auburn to a perfect season, taking down No. 12 South Carolina, No. 12 Arkansas, No. 6 LSU, No. 11 Alabama, No. 18 South Carolina and No. 2 Oregon in the process. The Tigers rallied from a 24-point deficit to beat Alabama 28-27 in the Iron Bowl, and beat the Ducks 22-19 in the BCS National Championship to win their first title since 1957.\n\n42. 2015 Alabama (14-1)\n\nTitles: CFP\n\nCoach: Nick Saban\n\nLed by: RB Derrick Henry, DL A'Shawn Robinson, LB Reggie Ragland\n\nWhat to know: The Crimson Tide were upset by Ole Miss 43-37 at home in their third game but rallied to win their final nine regular-season games. Alabama faced nine ranked opponents and beat eight of them. The Tide blasted No. 3 Michigan State 38-0 in a CFP semifinal at the Cotton Bowl and then outlasted No. 1 Clemson 45-40 in the CFP National Championship to win their fourth title in seven years. Henry won the Heisman Trophy by rushing for 1,059 yards with 12 touchdowns.\n\n43. 1997 Michigan (12-0)\n\nTitles: AP, FWAA (Nebraska won coaches poll)\n\nCoach: Lloyd Carr\n\nLed by: DB Charles Woodson, QB Brian Griese, DE Glen Steele\n\nWhat to know: The Wolverines defeated seven AP-ranked teams in winning a share of the school's first national title since 1948. Michigan and Nebraska were both undefeated after the regular season. Michigan beat No. 8 Washington State 21-16 in the Rose Bowl; Nebraska routed No. 3 Tennessee 42-17 in the Orange Bowl the next day. Then-Cornhuskers quarterback Scott Frost politicked for votes, and Tom Osborne's contemporaries apparently listened. Michigan was No. 1 in the final AP poll; Nebraska was No. 1 in the coaches' poll. Woodson became the first defensive player to win the Heisman.\n\n44. 1975 Oklahoma (11-1)\n\nTitles: AP, FWAA, NFF, UPI\n\nCoach: Barry Switzer\n\nLed by: DT Lee Roy Selmon, RB Joe Washington, NG Dewey Selmon\n\nWhat to know: The Sooners won their first eight games -- three of them by seven points or fewer, which caused them to fall to No. 2 in the polls -- and then fell to Kansas 23-3 at home, which ended their 28-game winning streak. But OU rebounded to win its last three games, beating No. 18 Missouri, No. 2 Nebraska and No. 5 Michigan in the Orange Bowl. The Sooners climbed to the top spot in the final polls after No. 1 Ohio State and No. 2 Texas A&M lost their bowl games.\n\n45. 1961 Alabama (11-0)\n\nTitles: AP, Coaches, NFF (Ohio State won FWAA)\n\nCoach: Paul \"Bear\" Bryant\n\nLed by: T Billy Neighbors, LB Lee Roy Jordan, QB Pat Trammell\n\nWhat to know: The 1961 Alabama team was Bryant's first to win a national championship -- and maybe his best defense. The Crimson Tide shut out six opponents and gave up only 25 points the entire season. They didn't allow a touchdown -- giving up only two field goals -- in the final seven games. Alabama led the NCAA in three defensive categories and set 10 school records for defense. The Tide defeated No. 9 Arkansas 10-3 in the Sugar Bowl to finish unbeaten.\n\n46. 1969 Penn State (11-0)\n\nTitles: None (Texas won AP, FWAA, NFF and UPI)\n\nCoach: Joe Paterno\n\nLed by: DT Mike Reid, LB Jack Ham, RB Franco Harris\n\nWhat to know: The Nittany Lions gave up only 8.2 points per game and finished unbeaten for the second straight season. They finished No. 2 in the polls behind Texas, after President Richard Nixon declared that the winner of the Texas-Arkansas game would be the national champion. The slight caused Paterno to famously quip later, \"I'd like to know how could the president know so little about Watergate in 1973 and so much about college football in 1969?\" Penn State defeated No. 6 Missouri 10-3 in the Orange Bowl.\n\n47. 1972 Oklahoma (11-1)\n\nTitles: None (USC won AP, FWAA, NFF, UPI)\n\nCoach: Chuck Fairbanks\n\nLed by: LB Rod Shoate, RB Greg Pruitt, DL Derland Moore\n\nWhat to know: The Sooners played seven games against ranked opponents, losing once to No. 9 Colorado 20-14 on the road, which was enough to cost them a national title to unbeaten USC. OU's high-powered offense averaged 478 yards and 37 points, which were best among Division I teams. The Sooners held nine opponents to 10 points or fewer and shut out No. 10 Texas in Dallas and No. 5 Penn State in the Sugar Bowl, handing Joe Paterno his first loss in a bowl game.\n\n48. 1954 Oklahoma (10-0)\n\nTitles: None (Ohio State won AP; UCLA won coaches and FWAA)\n\nCoach: Bud Wilkinson\n\nLed by: C/LB Kurt Burris, E Max Boydston\n\nWhat to know: The Sooners went unbeaten in what would be the second year of a three-year stretch without a defeat, while establishing the NCAA record for consecutive victories at 47 from 1953 to 1957. The Sooners gave up only 62 points in 10 games but didn't play a top-10 team, which caused them to finish behind Ohio State and UCLA in the polls. Because of the Big Seven's no-repeat rule, the Sooners didn't even get to play in a bowl game.\n\n49. 1978 USC (12-1)\n\nTitles: UPI (Alabama won AP)\n\nCoach: John Robinson\n\nLed by: RB Charles White, S Ronnie Lott, OT Anthony Munoz\n\nWhat to know: The 1978 USC squad, which shared a national title with Alabama, might have arguably been its most talented team under Robinson. More than three dozen players from the 1978 roster, including Charles White, Marcus Allen, Anthony Munoz and Ronnie Lott, played in the NFL. The Trojans upset No. 1 Alabama 24-14 at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama, and knocked off defending national champion Notre Dame 27-25 at the Coliseum. The only blemish was a 20-7 loss at Arizona State, in which the Trojans fumbled the snap six times after losing their starting center to injury. USC defeated No. 5 Michigan 17-10 in the Rose Bowl to finish No. 1 in the UPI poll.\n\n50. 1970 Nebraska (11-0-1)\n\nTitles: AP (Texas won coaches poll)\n\nCoach: Bob Devaney\n\nLed by: QB Jerry Tagge, LB Jerry Murtaugh, WR Johnny Rodgers\n\nWhat to know: A year after assistant Tom Osborne went to an I-formation with a balanced line, the Huskers went unbeaten for the first time since 1965. The Cornhuskers tied USC 21-21 at the Coliseum in their second game and then beat Army 28-0 the next week, which was the start of a 23-game winning streak. They rolled through the Big Eight and defeated Oklahoma 28-21 to finish 10-0-1 in the regular season. The No. 3 Cornhuskers beat No. 5 LSU (the only ranked opponent they played that season) 17-12 in the Orange Bowl, and grabbed a share of the title after No. 1 Texas and No. 2 Ohio State lost their bowl games.\n\n51. 2011 Alabama: (12-1 )\n\nTitles: BCS\n\nCoach: Nick Saban\n\nLed by: RB Trent Richardson, QB A.J. McCarron, LB Courtney Upshaw, LB Dont'a Hightower\n\nWhat to know: The Crimson Tide avenged a 9-6 OT loss at home to LSU with 21-0 win over the Tigers in BCS title game in New Orleans.

USC's roster included two Heisman winners, Bush (2005) and Leinart (2004).\n\n53. 1983 Miami (FL) (11-1)\n\nTitles: AP, USA/CNN, UPI, FWAA, NFF\n\nCoach: Howard Schnellenberger\n\nLed by: QB Bernie Kosar, RB Albert Bentley, WR Eddie Brown\n\nWhat to know: The Hurricanes won 11 straight after a season-opening loss to Florida. The Canes defense held seven opponents under 10 points. Miami upset No. 1 Nebraska 31-30 in a classic Orange Bowl.

They didn't blow anyone out, never scoring more than 26 points. But they edged a USC team, 13-12, that went on to humble Pitt, 47-14, in the Rose Bowl.\n\n129. 1973 Alabama (11-1)\n\nTitles: UPI (Notre Dame won AP, FWAA)\n\nCoach: Paul \"Bear\" Bryant\n\nLed by: RB Wilbur Jackson, LB Woodrow Lowe\n\nWhat to know: The Crimson Tide won every regular-season game by at least 14 points and took the UPI coaches' (pre-bowl) vote.

Ole Miss defeated No. 6 Arkansas 17-13 in Sugar Bowl\n\n132. 1982 SMU (11-0-1)\n\nTitles: None (Penn State won AP, FWAA, NFF, USA/CNN, UPI)\n\nCoach: Bobby Collins\n\nLed by: B Eric Dickerson, B Craig James\n\nWhat to know: One of the best backfields in the modern era led the Mustangs to a No. 2 finish in the final AP poll behind Penn State. The Mustangs didn't finish with the necessary flourish to sway the voters. They finished the regular season with a 17-17 tie with No. 9 Arkansas and a narrow 7-3 victory over No. 6 Pittsburgh in a Cotton Bowl dogged by rain and sleet.\n\n133. 1946 Army (9-0-1)\n\nTitles: None (Michigan won CFRA, HAF, NCF)\n\nCoach: Earl \"Red\" Blaik\n\nLed by: B Doc Blanchard, B Glenn Davis, B Arnold Tucker, E Hank Foldberg\n\nWhat to know: The four Hall of Famers in the starting lineup couldn't overcome Notre Dame in the famed 0-0 \"Game of the Century.\" This was a team for the ages: a backfield with consecutive Heisman Trophy winners (Blanchard and Davis), a team that defeated four ranked opponents.

Since Smith also passed, he attracted the votes to win the Heisman. In consecutive weeks, Minnesota defeated No. 3 Michigan 7-0 and No. 9 Northwestern 8-7.\n\n142. 1937 Pittsburgh (9-0-1)\n\nTitles: AP\n\nCoach: Dr. Jock Sutherland\n\nLed by: B Marshall Goldberg, L Tony Matisi\n\nWhat to know: The greatest team of Sutherland's Hall of Fame career defeated four ranked opponents by a combined score of 65-13 but is best remembered for a third consecutive scoreless tie against Fordham - they were called Much Ado About Nothing to Nothing.

The Purple Raiders averaged 55 points in five playoff games.\n\n146. 1984 BYU (13-0)\n\nTitles: AP, USA/CNN, FWAA, NFF, UPI\n\nCoach: LaVell Edwards\n\nLed by: QB Robbie Bosco, RB Vai Sikahema\n\nWhat to know: In a season in which only three schools had fewer than two losses, the Cougars, who began the season unranked, finished No. 1 because they had none. Washington (11-1) lost late, and Florida (9-1-1), on NCAA probation, didn't play in a bowl game. BYU had the offensive goods, leading the nation in total offense and passing offense.\n\n147. 2013 North Dakota State (15-0)\n\nTitles: FCS\n\nCoach: Craig Bohl\n\nLed by: QB Brock Jenson, OL Billy Turner, LB Grant Olson\n\nWhat to know: The Bison, with two straight FCS titles, didn't sneak up on Kansas State in the season opener, but they beat the Wildcats 24-21 anyway.

Billy Cannon's 89-yard punt return proved to be the difference in LSU's 7-3 defeat of Ole Miss. The Rebels finished the game at the Tigers' goal line, but couldn't cross it. No one outside the state recalls that Ole Miss won a rematch in the Sugar Bowl 21-0.\n\n150. 1944 Ohio State (9-0)\n\nTitles: None (Army won AP)\n\nCoach: Carroll Widdoes\n\nLed by: B Les Horvath, L Bill Hackett, E Jack Dugger\n\nWhat to know: Head coach Paul Brown left after the 1943 season to coach Great Lakes Naval Training Station, and the Buckeyes didn't miss a step.
