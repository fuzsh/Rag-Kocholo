        "text": "WHEN the Yale Bowl opened on Nov. 21, 1914, Al Ostermann made sure to arrive early. Then 9 years old, he had no ticket for the sold-out football game between Yale and Harvard, but he knew he would get in -- and without paying.\n\nThe previous afternoon the boy had spent almost an hour digging a hole under the fence surrounding the brand-new stadium and then filling the hole with leaves.\n\nNot wanting anyone to see him enter on Saturday, he arrived from his nearby home early, at 7 A.M., removed the leaves and crawled in under the fence to see the game amid nearly 70,000 fans. On Saturday Yale will meet Harvard again in the Bowl, in the annual season climax for the old rivals. And Al Ostermann will be on hand, as he has for all but one of the 493 previous football games played in one of the nation's most famous stadiums.\n\nOnce again, Mr. Ostermann will be getting in free, since he will be operating the scoreboard from his seat in the press box, as he has been doing for almost 40 years.\n\nAs far as anyone connected with Yale knows, Mr. Ostermann, now 86, has seen more of the university's football games than anyone. In addition to the games he has watched at the Yale Bowl, he has also seen scores of others at opponents' home fields.\n\n\"I remember going to Princeton games before the George Washington Bridge or the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels were built, and we had to take a ferry across the Hudson River,\" he recalled. In the one game at the Bowl that Mr. Ostermann missed, on Nov. 8, 1930, Yale crushed Alfred, 66-0.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
