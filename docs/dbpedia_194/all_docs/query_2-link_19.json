        "text": "Bio\n\nDartmouth coach Earl \"Red\" Blaik, later to direct the great Army teams of the 1940s and 1950s, called Bob MacLeod \"the greatest competitive athlete I've ever coached.\" It was a crowning compliment for one of the game's most heralded players. MacLeod was a 6-0, 190-pounder from Glen Ellyn, Illinois who became Coach Blaik's primary weapon from 1936 through 1938 when Dartmouth won 21 of 27 games. Every Dartmouth opponent in 1937 and 1938 named MacLeod to its all-opponent team. MacLeod averaged almost six yards per carry for three varsity campaigns, an impressive rushing statistic in those days of one-platoon football. In 1938, he was a consensus All-America and placed fourth in the Heisman voting. Following graduation, MacLeod played two seasons with the Chicago Bears before becoming a U.S. Marine Corps fighter pilot in World War II. Highly decorated for his service, MacLeod attained the rank of Major before leaving the service in 1946. He entered the advertising and publishing business, became publisher of Harpers Bazaar and vice-president and director of advertising for Hearst Magazines. In 1956, MacLeod became publisher and editorial director of Teen Magazine in Los Angeles, where he served as president of the Peterson Publishing Company."
