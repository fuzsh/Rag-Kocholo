        "text": "Educational Value\n\na little\n\nReaders may pick up on narrator Cassie's frequent literary references, especially to Jane Austen and the Brontes. Cassie's father is a postmodern novelist, and Cassie's love and respect for all the arts is a prominent theme. Though there are no obvious references to the time period, terms such as \"gramophone\" and \"moving pictures\" may give readers a hint that this takes place between the two World Wars.\n\nPositive Messages\n\na lot\n\nCassie takes up writing in her journal to teach herself how to write a novel, an ambition respected by her family. Intellect and creativity are valued by just about all the characters and are seen as worthy pursuits, even when not profitable. However, her family is desperately poor, and money is an issue. Cassie mostly minds because of the effect on the people around her, notably her older sister Rose. There is talk of marrying for money, but Cassie thinks love and literature are more important.\n\nPositive Role Models\n\na lot\n\nCassie is an appealing narrator who astutely analyzes the people around her on the pages of her journal. Although she occasionally embarrasses herself, she is highly aware of her errors, and she tries her best to be kind and considerate. Her sister Rose seems somewhat mercenary at times and her father callous and selfish, but ultimately the family members have strong attachments and loyalty to one another.\n\nParents need to know that I Capture the Castle, a lost classic by the author of The Hundred and One Dalmatians, was originally published for an adult audience but is appropriate for today's young teens and older. A bestseller in 1948, the book was out of print for many years and subsequently gained a reputation as a favorite to pass from generation to generation and as being one of the most requested books at used book stores. Trumpeted by authors such as Christopher Isherwood, Armistead Maupin, Joanna Trollope, and J.K. Rowling, it was finally reprinted in 1996 (and made into a movie in 2004). Though much of the focus of the story is on the marital prospects of Cassie's older sister, the dated concept makes sense for the time period, and Cassie's own concerns about life and love are still entirely relatable."
