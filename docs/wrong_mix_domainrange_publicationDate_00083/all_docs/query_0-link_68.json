        "text": "io9\n\nA Confusion of Princes: a Spiffing Boy’s Own Space Opera\n\nAustralia’s megastar young adult author Garth Nix excites the imaginations of adults as well as young readers, with his startlingly original world-building. His Abhorsen Chronicles features necromancy vs. technology in a sorta alternate version of World War I. The recently reprinted Shade’s Children presents a future where for your fourteenth birthday, instead of a cake, … Continued\n\nio9\n\nA Muslim Hacker and the Secrets of the Jinn, in Alif the Unseen\n\nAlif the Unseen is the debut prose novel by G. Willow Wilson, author of the critically-acclaimed graphic novels Cairo, Air, and Vixen. This is a breezy yet thought-provoking blend of techno-thriller and urban fantasy, set in an unnamed Arab emirate. It will whisk you away to the new vistas of wonder and wisdom, then return … Continued\n\nio9\n\nNew Terry Pratchett Novel is a Series of Tubers\n\nSir Terry Pratchett first came up with the idea of the Long Earth multiverse back in 1986. He set it aside to focus on Discworld. The 75 million copies sold of those wildly popular fantasy novels would indicate that this was a pretty good idea. Even the Queen of England agrees. As uncomfortable as it … Continued\n\nio9\n\nRide China Miéville’s Crazy Train in Railsea\n\nRailsea, the new young adult novel by China Miéville, is quite literary but playful — with vast molehills of brilliant worldbuilding & lots & lots of ampersands. Utterly unlike any of the many shmoopy vampires & dystopian romances out there, one wonders whether this novel will find an eager audience among teenaged readers. Twelve-year-old Grey … Continued\n\nio9\n\nFuzzy Nation by John Scalzi: Humans, Aliens, and Lawyers\n\nEven big time SF authors can’t resist doing fanfic. And why not? Our favorite writers are fans just like us. John Scalzi, author of Old Man’s War and internet darling, probably read Little Fuzzy by H. Beam Piper as a kid. This tale of humans debating the intelligence of a cute, fuzzy alien species has … Continued\n\nio9 Books\n\n“Equations of Life” is a horrorshow cyberpunk nostalgia trip to London\n\nYearning for the sort of cutting-edge dystopian future we were promised way back in the 1980s? Simon Morden’s Equations of Life may be just the cyberpunk thriller for you. Morden’s publisher, Orbit Books, has been touting him as the next Richard K. Morgan. While I hope Morden has the kind of success with this first … Continued\n\nio9 Books\n\nIn Greg Bear’s Hull Zero Three, The Cosmic Terror Of A Generation Ship\n\nThese days in Speculative Fiction it’s all about the Fantasy; Urban, Epic, or Weird. What happened to all the spaceships? Take heart space cadets, Greg Bear delivers cosmic wonder — and terror — with his latest novel, Hull Zero Three. Greg Bear is a brilliant SF writer, capable of extrapolating cutting-edge theories into dazzling set-pieces … Continued\n\nio9\n\nIt’s the Monster Manual with Manischewitz\n\nJust in time for Passover, Tachyon Publications presents The Kosher Guide to Imaginary Animals. This slim and silly volume is the ideal gift for anyone who has tried to make a saving throw vs. petrification using a dreidel. A few years ago the writer/editors Ann and Jeff VanderMeer were hiking in the woods. It was … Continued\n\nio9 Books\n\nMissing Kage Baker 1952-2010\n\nThis past Sunday, Kage Baker lost her year-long battle with cancer. We science-fiction readers have lost a brilliant author and a dear friend. Ms. Baker will be long remembered for her Company series: a wonderful collection of eleven novels, two novellas and scads of short stories that began with In the Garden of Iden in … Continued\n\nio9\n\nMagical Dogs and Detectives Explore Supernatural San Francisco in “Unleashed”\n\nForthcoming urban fantasy Unleashed (Ace) by John Levitt is the sequel to Dog Days and New Tricks. It follows the exploits of a spell-casting jazz guitarist and his magic doggie. Well, sort of a doggie. The blend of urban fantasy and detective fiction seems like a sure-fire win. We can seen the modern roots of … Continued\n\nio9\n\nThe Secret History of Science Fiction\n\nTachyon Publications has a new anthology out called The Secret History of Science Fiction. It centers around a subject that has sparked countless debates and rants among Science Fiction fans. And no, it’s not River Tam vs. James T. Kirk. Editors James Patrick Kelly and John Kessel have collected these nineteen stories to explore the … Continued\n\nio9\n\nMadness of Flowers: The City Is…Alive\n\nThe brilliant and prolific Jay Lake returns to the City Imperishable, with a Madness of Flowers. This is a decadent, surreal urban fantasy in the New Weird vein. Sex Dwarfs, spoilers, and a Polar Bear await. Madness of Flowers starts off right on the heels of the action in 2006’s Trial of Flowers. I can … Continued\n\nio9\n\nBad Boys of the Multiverse: An Alternate Universe Reading Guide\n\nHave we gone multiverse crazy? Iain Banks’ latest novel, Transition, is just the latest of a long line of sideways-traveling books, and this theme is more prevalent than ever. Here are some of my favorites, with spoilers and foul language. https://gizmodo.com/with-transition-iain-m-banks-reinvents-the-multiver-5366356 The idea of traveling between alternate realities is a common theme in speculative fiction. … Continued\n\nio9\n\n60 Years Of Strange Parables And Unsettling Discoveries, In One Volume\n\nThe Magazine Of Fantasy & Science Fiction has been at the forefront of genre short fiction for sixty years. And current editor Gordon Van Gelder had the unenviable task of choosing just 23 stories to represent those six decades. The result is The Very Best of Fantasy & Science Fiction: Sixtieth Anniversary Anthology, out now … Continued\n\nio9\n\nSherlock Holmes Ventures Into A Fog Of Monsters And Weird Science\n\nIn anticipation of that upcoming movie with that guy who was in Weird Science, Night Shade Books presents The Improbable Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The game is afoot! Or perhaps atentacle. Edgar Allan Poe is usually credited for creating the detective fiction genre but it was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle that really nailed it with … Continued\n\nio9\n\nIn Which Some Steampunk Novels are Discussed\n\nGoggles, gaslights and gears, oh my! Steampunk is a steadily growing subgenre of speculative fiction. We review four current and forthcoming books that have been affixed with that label… in an elegant copperplate hand, naturally. Ever since I was four years old, in 1972— before the merger of punk to steam, I wanted to be … Continued\n\nio9\n\n“Son of Retro Pulp Tales” Delights In Cheap Thrills\n\nJoe R. and Keith Lansdale present another collection of stories recalling those hard-boiled cheap thrills from the first half of the last century. Hearken back with us now to yesteryear in Son of Retro Pulp Tales! (Subterranean Press). Way before the advent of comic books or paperback novels, our geeky forebears got their fill of … Continued\n\nio9\n\nJapanese Scifi Smackdown! Power-Armor Warriors Vs. Alien Dirt-Eaters\n\nThe last 25 years has seen a huge swell of interest by English-speaking audiences in manga, partly thanks to Viz Media. Now Viz is publishing translations of two prose novels, about alien invasion, time travel and power-armor smackdowns. “Haikasoru” translates as “High Castle” and is meant as a riff on Philip K. Dick’s classic allohistory … Continued\n\nio9\n\n“Bar None” Cracks Open A Beer At The End Of The World\n\nBar None by Tim Lebbon (Night Shade Press, 2009) is a dark post-apocalyptic fantasy with a creepy numinous beauty and really good beer.
