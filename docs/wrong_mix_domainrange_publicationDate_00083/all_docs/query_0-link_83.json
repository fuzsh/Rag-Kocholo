        "text": "If you're a completist, consider comparing this list to the top 100 sf books on the Sci-Fi Lists page, a page that has greatly influenced my own reading. I found the sci-fi lists page in 2009 and read straight through the list but haven’t always agreed with the choice of some of the books there or the position. Thus, I’ve made a new list. Here we go!\n\nTop 100 Science Fiction Novels List\n\n1.Contact – Carl Sagan\n\nContacting extraterrestrials was lifework for Sagan, but this novel shows the importance\n\nof making contact with our fellow humans. Indeed, our quality of life is measured by the quality of our relationships, and not just relationships to space aliens.\n\n2.A Scanner Darkly – Philip K. Dick\n\nThe title is taken from a biblical quotation: For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully. In Dickian fashion, this mirror only reflects darkness, whether the darkness of corporate greed or the darkness of drug addiction or the darkness of the human soul.\n\n3.Snow Crash – Neal Stephenson\n\nA lovesong to cyberpunk, Hiro Protagonist is the best swordfighter in the world and in cyberspace, and to protect both of those worlds, he'll have to use his chops. His sword is never described as pink.\n\n4.The Island of Doctor Moreau – H.G. Wells\n\nThe rule of the men beasts is not to go on all-fours, but even humans can't abide by the rule. Wells' thoughts on evolution are at play here. What are we really? How far removed are we from the lower species? What would it take for us to revert (if we haven't already)?\n\n5.Neuromancer– William Gibson\n\nA neon-lit novel of poetic, head-spinning future-making jujitsu. Gibson wrote a new romance to replace the staid science fiction of the day, a genre dominated by names popularized in the '50s and '60s. While this wasn't the first cyberpunk fiction, it remains the greatest. Keep the headphones plugged in just in Case you flatline.\n\n6.The Time Machine – H.G. Wells\n\nThis cover is dumb, but I had this copy as a kid so I appreciate it because of nostalgia (nostalgia makes everything better). The time traveler finds a world that is eerily a reflection of his own world. Does the time traveler recognize that reflection? Did any of Wells' 19th-century readership to which he was appealing realize that he was showing them the injustice of their day?\n\n7.Fahrenheit 451 – Ray Bradbury\n\nThis book was written fast. But that doesn't mean we should ban or burn it! It's not a classic because it was written fast. It's a classic because it deals with media transference. When a culture transitions from one dominant media type to the next, it always comes with the fear that intellectual activity will slow down or halt. Plus, the book presents party ideology masked as televised entertainment. Fox (Faux) News anyone?\n\n8.Altered Carbon – Richard K. Morgan\n\nThe book is better than the TV series. Always, right? Kovacs deals with psychological trauma, remembering past deaths, past bodies he's inhabited, past lovers he'll never meet again.\n\n9.\n\nConsider Phlebas – Iain Banks\n\nBanks is a top-tier genre writer, a master of the page turner. He knows how to make the character want something, even, like Vonnegut says, if it's just a glass of water. But it's never merely a glass of water with Banks, it's power, it's wealth, it's living past the laser fight, taking over a ship with cunning.\n\n10.Dr. Adder - K.W. Jeter\n\nCould be called Dr. R-Rated, but it's a singular work of genius. Dr. Adder prefigures\n\ncyberpunk by nearly a decade but operates with its tropes: prosthetic as power relic, defend information in cyberspace, information is power, the guide is a femme fatale. Tune in to K.C.I.D!\n\n11.2001: A Space Odyssey – Arthur C. Clarke\n\nHumans have long been on an evolutionary course. Clarke starts us with the apes, takes us to the moon, and then to the stars! And one day, yes, we can only hope, perhaps we will play among the stars.\n\n12.The Forever War – John Haldeman\n\nSpoiler alert: the Forever War is the Vietnam Conflict. I heard Joe Haldeman say so at a convention in 2017. He served in the war, poor guy. If, as you read, you get a strong sense of trauma, you're reading it right. It's in earnest.\n\n13.Vineland - Thomas Pynchon\n\nThis book is a perfect send-up of America's free love hangover. A hippy avoids shakedowns decades after the psychedelic era has ended.\n\n14.Gateway – Frederic Pohl\n\nPilot an alien ship at your own risk! The potential payoff is unlimited! Maybe you'll find priceless artifacts! Maybe you'll starve to death! Maybe you'll burn out in a supernova! In your off-time, hit the slots, drink yourself into oblivion, and mate like there's no tomorrow. The gateway, of course, is capitalism and desire. The other side of the gate is death and longing.\n\n15.The Lathe of Heaven – Ursula K. Le Guin\n\nEffective dreamers can alter reality by dreaming. Can an effective dreamer harness this power for good?\n\n16.Solaris – Stanislaw Lem\n\nThe world of Solaris is an intelligent world. Humans can't figure it out. Can Solaris figure out humans?\n\n17.Distraction – Bruce Sterling\n\nThis is basically a book about disinformation campaigns and fake news released decades before such things were possible or problematic.\n\n18.The Space Merchants – Frederic Pohl & Cyril Kornbluth\n\nCorporations market their products to specific segments of the population. Sometimes they make the product addictive. You don't want to get on the bad side of corporations.\n\n19.Ender’s Game - Orson Scott Card\n\nA child genius is recruited to fight an alien horde. Aliens read as non-heterosexually oriented humans.\n\n20.White Noise – Don Delillo\n\nA deadly gas threatens middle America's status quo. Are we free to take on whatever identity we want? Or is freedom an illusion?\n\n21.1984 - George Orwell\n\nWe're all rats in Big Brother's cage. He's watching everyone. The consequences of resisting conformity are not good.\n\n22.Schismatrix– Bruce Sterling\n\nThe mechanists and shapers both work to extend life. Many use the technologies of both. Even really old people can be awful.\n\n23.To All Your Scattered Bodies Go - Philip Jose Farmer\n\nAnyone that ever lived is reincarnated in a nearly never-ending river valley so aliens can learn more about humanity. You'll meet some despicable people in your travels along the valley.\n\n24.Software – Rudy Rucker\n\nWhat does the evolution of AI look like?\n\n25Beggars in Spain – Nancy Kress\n\nSome humans evolve to not need sleep. They have a distinct advantage over sleepers. That doesn't explain why the girl on this cover is wearing a nightgown.\n\n26.Slaughterhouse-Five – Kurt Vonnegut\n\nEach of Vonnegut's books is about his traumatic war experience. This is the best version. So, it goes.\n\n27.Dune – Frank Herbert\n\nEasily the best example of sci-fi world building. Herbert built his world to show us how we are destroying our own.\n\n28.The Stars my Destination - Alfred Bester\n\nDude travels through spacetime with his mind. He doesn't have much control over this power.\n\n29.The Diamond Age – Neal Stephenson\n\nClassism is enforced through education. What would happen if the disenfranchised had access to the same education as the enfranchised?\n\n30.I Robot – Isaac Asimov\n\nThe robot's positronic brain is hard coded to protect humanity, but those rules are sometimes at odds with each other and have some far-reaching ramifications. Should genius-level, benevolent robots make decisions for humanity?\n\n31.Ringworld – Larry Niven\n\nA vanished civilization left a big dumb object for travelers to explore. There isn't much there, but it's really cool.\n\n32.Cat’s Cradle – Kurt Vonnegut\n\nA scientist creates a compound capable of ruining all the water on earth. Does it get dropped into the ocean? This book is referenced over and over again in literature and film, so you might as well read it.\n\n33.Starship Troopers – Robert Heinlein\n\nA classic novel of military science fiction. Kill or be killed in space.\n\n34.Mao II – Don Delillo\n\n35.20,000 Leagues Under the Sea – Jules Verne\n\nCaptain Nemo is sick of human society. The ocean is cool though.\n\n36.Octavia Butler - The Parable of the Sower\n\nIs it a superpower to feel what others feel or a handicap?\n\n37.Holy Fire – Bruce Sterling\n\nWhat is the holy fire? Feeling the near immortality of seeing your progeny alive and well? Undergoing a radical surgery to become young again?\n\n38.Cryptonomicon – Neal Stephenson\n\nA math genius breaks the Nazi code.\n\n39.All You Need is Kill – Hiroshi Sakurazaka\n\nA guy is stuck in a day of war. He dies, and dies, and dies, but always improves his skill. Better than the movie Edge of Tomorrow. Though I'm a sucker for a Tom Cruise feature. The movie misses the novel's samurai theme.\n\n40.All Tomorrow’s Parties – William Gibson\n\nThe book is better than the Velvet Underground song. I rate this is as Gibson's most fun novel after Neuromancer.\n\n41.Man Plus – Frederic Pohl\n\nMars isn't all that hospitable to mankind, but with a little technological adaptation, humans can make it on the red planet. Still, who wants to be a guinea pig?\n\n42.Sphere - Michael Crichton\n\nHumans find a submerged crashed spaceship. The ship has a gift from an alien race in its vaults. The gift amplifies whatever is going on in the mind's of those that come into contact with it. Humans are paranoid, anxious, and mostly crazy, so things don't end up well.\n\n43.End Zone – Don DeLillo\n\nThermonuclear war is compared to football. And it's DeLillio, so the previous homology is also compared to sex.\n\n44.The Road – Cormac McCarthy\n\nA father and his son trek across the a post-apocalyptic version of America. Watch out for cannibals.\n\n45.2061: Odyssey 3 – Arthur C. Clarke\n\nDudes are in space. They find a planet with water. So, yeah, the story is kind of forgettable but Clarke is one of science fiction's finest.\n\n46.Flowers for Algernon – Daniel Keyes\n\nA profoundly dumb man receives experimental therapy that turns him into a supergenius. The therapy only works for a while. After you read this, watch the Always Sunny in Philadelphia episode Flowers for Charlie.\n\n47.Bones of the Earth – Michael Swanwick\n\nSwanwick's response to Jurassic Park. This book is less about the dinosaurs and more about human society. What is the ideal human community? When a group of scientists travel in time to study dinosaurs, they learn more about human society. Bring plenty of prophylactics.\n\n48.Broken Angels – Richard K. Morgan\n\nMore fun than the first Kovacs novel.\n\n49.The World of Null-A – A.E. Van Vogt\n\nThe link here goes to my friend Mark's review of the book. He reviewed the hell out of this thing.\n\nNull-A was one of the novels that Philip K. Dick cut his teeth on. Worth it to better understand what came after.\n\n50.Brave New World – Aldous Huxley\n\nDrugs are awesome and you can have sex with anyone, but babies are made in test tubes. Shakespeare is better.\n\n51.Slan – A.E. Van Vogt\n\nPulp sci fi at its finest.\n\n52.Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom – Cory Doctorow\n\nThe new currency is social currency. While you might be thinking, ok, what's new, this book predates our current runaway era of the social media influencer. And, to a great degree, all currency was always social. Tall and beautiful people are always going to get the job ahead of everyone else. And tall, beautiful people get trusted with things more. They get more opportunities. So, they wind up the people in the place to give others jobs. Are you starting to see how the cycle works?\n\n53.Boneshaker - Cherie Priest\n\nTightly, tightly written story, a page turner from page one until the end. A big swath of Seattle is unlivable because of poison gas dug up from below. But people still live there--yes, cli-fi. A son ventures in to find out the truth about his father. His mother follows to protect him.\n\n54.2010: Odyssey 2 – Arthur C. Clarke\n\nClarke had a PhD in astrophysics, and this book works in properties of space travel. They don't find a planet child as the cover might lead you to believe, but the book is a classic.\n\n55.The Merchant’s War – Frederic Pohl & Cyril Kornbluth\n\nBiting satire focused on American capitalism in the '50s. More Pohl and less Kornbluth than The Space Merchants.\n\n56.Jurassic Park – Michael Crichton\n\nScientists figure out how to reconstruct dinosaurs. They make a park. What could go wrong? I'll tell you this though. If humans ever go extinct, it would be a damned fool that recreated us out of found genetic material.\n\n57.Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep – Philip K. Dick\n\nThey do.\n\n58.The Puppet Masters – Robert Heinlein\n\nThe aliens take over. They use humans as hosts. Reads as red scare commentary. (commie-tary?) Heinlein's uber-confident, hypersexual male is once again the hero here. From golden science fiction until Gibson and Sterling upended cyberpunk, science fiction told the tale of men dominating things: planets, galaxies, but mostly women.\n\n59.Ubik – Philip K. Dick\n\nCryogenics was pretty new at the time. Dick creates a story about the consciousness of those in suspended animation. Confusion and disbelief rule the consciousness of the mind in cryo.\n\n60.Pattern Recognition – William Gibson\n\nMostly poetic. Important because Gibson wrote it during 9/11. You'll recognize fairly quick that the book doesn't really have any patterns to follow, but Gibson is a genius and the best prose stylist science fiction has ever had. You read Gibson because he surprises you with ideas in passing, not necessarily because he tells a good story. Neuromancer is a good story, a great story, the rest of his books are mostly just a great conflux of thinking.\n\n61.Time Out of Joint – Philip K. Dick\n\n\"The time is out of joint; O cursed spite!/That ever I was born to set it right!\" Shakespeare's Hamlet. But will Dick set this stuff right? You'll have to read it to figure that out because I've honestly forgotten.\n\n62.The Man in the High Castle – Philip K. Dick\n\nThe book is better than the television show. Isn't it always? What would American life be like if the Axis powers had prevailed? By the way, not much would have had to change for history to have been dramatically different like this. For more on science fictive histories, read Stephenson's Cryptonomicon.\n\n63.The Invisible Man – H.G. Wells\n\nA scientist makes himself invisible. Ironically, as a result he becomes more visible to society.\n\n64.Starfish – Peter Watts\n\nA badass lady walks across the seafloor.\n\n65.The Moon is a Harsh Mistress – Robert Heinlein\n\nThe loonies revolt! Get number three arm and number four wife. Use gravity slingshot to attack Earth to gain freedom!\n\n66.The Lost World - Michael Crichton\n\nSame story as Jurassic Park, but probably more fun. Crichton never wrote sequels but Spielberg secured a lot of money for the project. You don't turn down Spielberg even though we all wish Ernest Cline had turned him down instead of writing the shit storm that is Ready Player Two. The T-Rex is more of a problem in The Lost World than in J Park.\n\n67.The Fountains of Paradise – Arthur C. Clarke\n\nThe Space elevator book. Clarke was working off of Heinlein's idea that SF should include a cool scientific concept that has ramifications for the way people live. But then humans should experience some conflict as a result of that technology. So, the SF tale shows us not only how science and technology changes but also how humans and human culture changes.\n\n68.Old Man’s War – John Scalzi\n\nScalzi's Forever War and it has a space elevator. It's a fun book. I added it here because it allows for ethical considerations of who fights wars.\n\n69.Red Mars – Kim Stanley Robinson\n\nAnother space elevator book. Robinson knows a lot of geology too. The many relationships that come and go in the book function as a meditation on human fidelity to a place. Can we still retain our humanity without Mother Earth? Do we change as a result of our relationship to the worlds we inhabit?\n\n70.Frontera – Lewis Shiner\n\nRudy Rucker recommended this book on a public access TV show back in '80s. I found the clip on YouTube and then loved the book.\n\n71.Implied Spaces – Walter Jon Williams\n\nSword and Singularity. Mixes fantasy with sci-fi. Williams is a wicked storyteller.\n\n72.Islands in the Net – Bruce Sterling\n\nA sword that cuts through anything! A balm that can permanently change skin tone! Data havens! High political and economic intrigue! I can't wait for the sequel, Islands in the Crypto.\n\n73.The Three Body Problem – Liu Cixin\n\nHonestly, I struggled to finish this book. It has moments of brilliance--probably one amazing novella and a couple great short stories of material in here--but the video game they play is just about the most boring game I've ever heard of, especially for an online multiplayer. I'd much rather play Cardhunter. Some readers have mentioned that the second book in this series is better, but I can't work up the nerve to start. My body had enough problems finishing the first.\n\n74.The Stepford Wives – Ira Levin\n\nDudes in a small town kill their wives and replace them with subservient robots. The funny thing is, women of the era were already living as if they were subservient robots. The story highlights the problem.\n\n75.Escapology – Ren Warom\n\nGender bender cyberpunk narrative, a book of cyberpunk virtuality that demonstrates there is no divide between the real and the virtual. You'll come for the shark and leave happy.\n\n76.Immortality, Inc. – Robert Sheckley\n\nBerserkers kill civilians randomly because they've bought immortality and are ready to die. Why not, like an Egyptian Pharaoh, take several with you? Berserker!\n\n77.How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe - Charles Yu\n\nTime loops, baseball, and metafiction.\n\n78.Ready Player One – Ernest Cline\n\nWilly Wonka meets virtuality with '80s nostalgia. Now that the sequel Ready Player Two is a thing, we all know that Ernest Cline fooled us into believing he was an interesting writer by copy and pasting facts from Wikipedia into an Easter egg hunt. I'll probably take this book off the list soon.\n\n79.Redshirts – John Scalzi\n\nThe redshirts always die. Some redshirts figure this out and start to hide.\n\n80.Frankenstein – Mary Shelley\n\nThe book is often cited as the very first science fiction novel. A creature is animated from the bodies of the dead. It is suprahuman in strength and intellect and it is scorned by its maker. It seeks revenge.\n\n81.The War of the Worlds – H.G. Wells\n\nThe aliens are here and they are walking around in tripods killing everyone. Better be glad you need a flu shot.\n\n82.A Canticle for Leibowitz - Walter Miller\n\nLong, long ago, atomic war kills off most of humanity. But some people remain, including monks that keep stuff they find that wasn't atomized. Leibowitz had a grocery list and now monks treasure it as a holy relic. Unfortunately, they also treasure information that helps future generations rebuild atomic bombs so progress can get arrested again. The book takes us from Leibowitz's fallout shelter to the fall of mankind.\n\n83.Little Brother – Cory Doctorow\n\nHomeland security sucks. It's full of power-happy assholes that don't give a damn about democracy (the part of the Republican party that brought you the Capitol invasion). Some kids with techno know-how get together and resist. Some of the kids also have sex, but that's neither here nor there.\n\n84.The City and the Stars – Arthur C. Clarke\n\nNo one leaves the city until the nude guy in the picture there. He figures out much of the knowledge of his people are based on falsehoods. In the picture, he neither has a hood or pants. I would that he did.\n\n85.The Windup Girl - Paolo Bacigalupi\n\nLife sucks in the climate changed future whether you're human or a windup girl.\n\n86.A Clockwork Orange – Anthony Burgess\n\nYoung people go beat up old people for no reason. The state gets revenge. Burgess ruins classical music for all of us. Are we all hyperviolent in our innermost being? Can media save us?\n\n87.Martian Time-Slip – Philip K. Dick\n\nAffairs happen off-world too. If it happens during the thirty minutes after midnight, did it really happen?\n\n88.When Gravity Fails – Alec Effinger\n\nYou can mod your personality and perception with a program--moddies and daddies. You can also take lots of drugs. You may or may not escape death when a James Bond modded asshole comes after you.\n\n89.Valis – Philip K. Dick\n\nVast Active Living Intelligence System. God is either a Russian-backed conspiracy or a knowable entity. Or wait, maybe both.\n\n90.Revelation Space – Alastair Reynolds\n\nThe Nostalgia for Infinity is a lighthugger. It can travel almost at the speed of light. It has a lot of big ass weapons capable of killing semi-sentient robots from far away. The ship is also in a state of decay. Some semi-sentient robots from far, far away destroy sentient life when they find it. They are closing in.\n\n91.Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy – Douglas Adams\n\nThis is a silly book, but it's fun. I probably should have made this #42 on the list.\n\n92.Involution Ocean – Bruce Sterling\n\nSterling's first novel. It's got interspecies love, drugs, and adventure!\n\n93.Babel 17 – Samuel Delany\n\nDhalgren is Delany's masterwork, but come on, who of you has actually gotten through Dhalgren, the Gravity's Rainbow of science fiction? Since none of us are probably going to sit down with Dhalgren any time soon, this poetic near novella will have to do.\n\n94.Foundation– Isaac Asimov\n\nSome critics maintain this book is about the rise and fall of the Roman empire. My read is that it's about four distinct eras in the life of the US. I'm not always right, but I'm almost never wrong.\n\n95.I am Legend – Richard Matheson\n\nNearly everyone has turned into vampires. One guy is still good, but he's losing it. The vampires really hate him.\n\n96.The Glass Hammer – K.W. Jeter\n\nThe most popular form of entertainment is a reality TV show in which dudes in fast cars dodge missiles shot from satellites as they run illegal computer parts across a desert.\n\n97.The Hollow Earth – Rudy Rucker\n\nThe earth is hollow and Edgar Allen Poe is the guide. Bonus: the people in the hollow world are not sexist or racist.\n\n98.Heavy Weather – Bruce Sterling\n\nA better version of Twister. Also, a look at what global warming will do to us.\n\n99.Virtual Light – William Gibson\n\nA corporation plans to rebuild San Francisco using nanotechnology.\n\n00. Mona Lisa Overdrive – William Gibson\n\nProstitutes and dudes uploading their consciousness into a cyber hard drive.\n\nCan you think of a different book you'd like to see on this list that you'd say earn honors as one of the best sci-fi books?\n\nIf you wish to dispute or praise any of the top 100 Sci-Fi Books on this list, please email me at joseph.hurtgen@gmail.com! Make a strong enough argument, and I will (probably) alter the list."
