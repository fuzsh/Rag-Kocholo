        "text": "The Game by Diana Wynne Jones\n\nreviewed by Rich Horton\n\nHayley Foss is an orphan living in London with her Grandparents. Her Grandma is a stickler for rules, and hardly ever even lets Hayley out of the house. When Hayley meets a curious pair of musicians she calls Flute and Fiddle on an excursion with the maid, her Grandma goes ape, and sends Hayley off to the family castle in Ireland. There she meets a grand assortment of cousins and aunts -- though oddly enough no uncles.\n\nDawn by Tim Lebbon\n\nreviewed by David Hebblethwaite\n\nBy the end of Dusk, the Mages Angel and S'Hivez had regained control of magic and brought a permanent twilight down upon the world of Noreela. Can they be defeated? And will the author end his sequence as well as he began it? No prizes for guessing the answer to the former question; you only have to look at this book's title. As for the latter...\n\nNew Arrivals\n\ncompiled by Neil Walsh\n\nThe month of June brought a great many new and forthcoming titles to our doorstep. Some of the highlights include the latest from Dave Duncan, Scott Lynch, Juliet Marillier, Adam Roberts, Eric Brown, Richard K. Morgan, Bruce Boston, Tom Piccirilli, Michael A. Stackpole, as well as sneak previous of forthcoming works from Michael Swanwick, Terry Brooks, Robin McKinley, Mike Mignola & Christopher Golden, Allen Steele, and Ursula Le Guin. Plus plenty more besides!\n\nDarkfever by Karen Marie Moning\n\nreviewed by Nathan Brazil\n\nMacKayla Lane Mac tends bar, paints her nails, wears a lot of bright colours, and doesn't think too deeply. Until her sister is murdered while studying in Dublin, Ireland. Mac decides that the Irish police have not tried hard enough to find the killer. Crossing the Atlantic, she sets about the daunting task of uncovering the truth about her sibling's brutal demise. Almost immediately, she finds herself neck deep in a world where ancient and lethal magic is vying with other local parties to find a powerful, ancient tome.\n\nThree Magazines: First Issues\n\nreviewed by Rich Horton\n\nRich sees a lot of SF/Fantasy magazines, and it seems new ones are coming along all the time. Here are the first issues of three different -- indeed, very different -- magazines. He thought to do a bit of compare and contrast. To begin with, the look and feel of each publication is different.\n\nPostscripts Magazine: by Title\n\ncompiled by Rodger Turner\n\nIn the spring of 2004, PS Publishing launched a new magazine called Postscripts. Originally, the magazine was to be digest-sized featuring about 60,000 words of fiction, a guest editorial, book reviews, and the occasional non-fiction article in each issue. Fiction includes SF, fantasy, horror, and crime/suspense. The book is produced in two formats: numbered, limited edition in hard cover signed by all contributors and a perfect bound paper cover version.\n\nBrasyl by Ian McDonald\n\nreviewed by Stuart Carter\n\nOnly one third of Brasyl, set in Sao Paulo in 2032, appears to be the straightforward extrapolative science fiction that River Of Gods was. There are two other narratives: one following Marcelina Hoffman, a producer of trash TV, living a thoroughly modern life in the Rio of 2006, and one following her seeming antithesis, Father Luis Quinn, an Irish Jesuit priest on a Heart Of Darkness-style voyage across an appalling Brazil of 1732.\n\nEmperor by Stephen Baxter\n\nreviewed by Steven H Silver\n\nSpanning the reigns of emperors Claudius, Hadrian, and Constantinople, the Prophecy ties the descendents of Agrippina, Nectovelin's niece, together through the ages, even when they have apparently lost all connection to each other. Each generation also has its own way of looking at the Prophecy, true to their own period of time, but not necessarily to the Prophecy itself.\n\nBabylon 5.1\n\nTV reviews by Rick Norwood\n\nRick has some news about Battlestar Galactica, Stargate SG1, Heroes and Dr. Who. He also gives us a list of what to watch on TV in July.\n\nLife During Wartime by Lucius Shepard\n\nreviewed by Charlene Brusso\n\nThe military gear of the near-future setting hasn't moved too far from the basics. Assault weapons cable into backpack processors which project range data onto helmet-mounted screens. Army-issue amphetamines have been replaced by fast-acting combat drugs like \"samurai\" that can make any soldier feel like Superman. The twist is the existence of Psicorps, a project born of New Age philosophy and more than a little Cold War paranoia. Psicorps' job is to identify and exploit potential psychic ability in Army recruits.\n\nThe Company They Keep by Diana Pavlac Glyer\n\nreviewed by Sherwood Smith\n\nThe level of scholarship in this book is the first thing that impresses. The author seems to have read everything by, and about, the Inklings. Not just that, she's up on the latest thinking about the process of writing and collaboration -- not just from a literary view, but from a psychological and sociological perspective. The authorities upon which she draws range from Harold Bloom's hothouse-fervid The Anxiety of Influence to Karen Burke LeFevre's Invention as a Social Act."
