        "text": "Howlers, unite!\n\nWhether you’ve been following Pierce Brown’s epic sci-fi saga since the first book came out in 2014 or you just binge-read all of the series, you likely have one question: Will there be any more Red Rising books? Fortunately, there will be a seventh book, Red God, that’s currently slated for release in early 2025. Unfortunately, it will be the final installment that will close the book for good on Darrow’s gripping journey.\n\nWith that in mind, here’s a list of books like Red Rising that will tide you over both until the last book in the series comes out and after the heptalogy’s complete.\n\nSome of these books you’ll be familiar with, like the highly popular The Hunger Games and Divergent series. Others, like The Will of the Many, are promising new series starters that are sure to impress fans of Brown’s beloved Red Rising.\n\nIf you’re looking for an audiobook like Red Rising, this is it. Emily Woo Zeller’s excellent narration, which scored an AudioFile Magazine Best Audiobook award, is on par with the full-cast dramatization of Red Rising.\n\nKuang reimagines China’s history through the experiences of Rin, a peasant girl who gains entry into an elite military training academy and discovers she has lethal shamanic powers. Filled with rage at the injustices levied against her people by the Mugen Federation, Rin must use her newfound powers to tip the scales of war.\n\nKuang’s debut is a graphic, no-holds-barred military fantasy that explores the horrors and atrocities of war and, much like Red Rising, pushes its protagonist to the brink to see just how far someone will go to protect the ones they love.\n\nThis twisty-turny trilogy starter shares many similarities with Brown’s Red Rising saga that fans will love. They’re both heavily inspired by ancient Roman culture and feature undercover protagonists surrounded by the ruthless elite in a rotating slide of school settings, training sequences, and deadly competitions.\n\nBut The Will of the Many boasts its own style and vibe, not to mention an astounding hero’s journey that will leave you waiting with bated breath for the sequel. Islington’s effortless worldbuilding blurs the line between science fiction and fantasy and relies heavily on a magic system so unique and complex it’s in a class of its own.\n\nWhile I’m on the topic of brilliantly constructed magic systems, The Name of the Wind undoubtedly deserves a spot on this list of books similar to Red Rising based on this comparison point alone. Rothfuss’ masterpiece was an instant hit in the fantasy genre and garnered praise from Brandon Sanderson, George R.R. Martin, Ursula K. LeGuin, and countless other fantasy authors.\n\nWhile the settings between Brown and Rothfuss’ series aren’t necessarily alike, both series’ protagonists are complex and cunning heroes who go to great lengths and cross morally gray lines to protect the ones they love.\n\nHere’s one for the die-hard cyberpunk fans out there in the far-flung universe. In the 25th century, death is dead, as people can have their consciousness saved and “re-sleeved” into a new body. But as humans get closer to immortality, it just means the body count is even higher and the deaths are much more gruesome.\n\nTakeshi, a re-sleeved convict at the heart of the series, is in many ways like Darrow: Flawed, driven, and fueled by a desire for revenge. This first entry in the Takeshi Kovacs trilogy is a thrilling hardboiled sci-fi noir that netted a Philip K. Dick Award and a Netflix series (fingers crossed Red Rising also scores a live-action TV adaptation).\n\nIf the caste system that plays heavily into the plot of Red Rising intrigued you (or repulsed you, or both), Red Queen is a must-read.\n\nMare Barrow has red blood but Silver powers, a fact that threatens to destroy the basis of an unjust social caste system. With the king determined to keep her powers a secret, Mare must rely on her unwavering strength and wit to survive.\n\nThe Red Queen series is a perpetual chart-topper and one of the greats from the YA dystopian heyday.\n\nIn a dystopian world where being different is deadly, Tris leaves Abnegation, her family’s faction, to make her own way among the brave Dauntless. But as she struggles to prove herself, Tris also discovers a dark plot brewing in her society — one that tests her limits and makes divergence from the status quo all the more dangerous.\n\nLike other dystopian fan favorites on this list, this series is among the OG dystopian novels that have made a lasting mark on YA literature. Follow Divergent with the rest of the trilogy, Insurgent and Allegiant (there’s also a collection of stories from Tobias’ perspective).\n\nIn the future, humanity has rid the world of everything bad, including hunger, violence, war, and even death. Everyone lives forever in perfect health, which sounds like a dream. So what’s the catch?\n\nIt turns out even utopias are susceptible to overpopulation.\n\nThis is where the scythes come in. Responsible for culling the herd, scythes are the only means to achieve death in an otherwise perfect society. As two new apprentices, Rowan and Citra, begin their training, they discover that evil and corruption have taken hold of the scythedom.\n\nShusterman’s unique take on immortality and his layered world-building put Scythe a cut above the rest of the crowded crop of YA dystopian literature."
