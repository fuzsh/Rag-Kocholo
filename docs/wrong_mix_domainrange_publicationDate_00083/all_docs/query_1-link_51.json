Item #295101\n\nISBN: 0345457684\n\nA fine copy in wrappers (paperback).\n\nNEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - NOW AN EXCITING NEW SERIES FROM NETFLIX - The shell that blew a hole in his chest was only the beginning in this \"tour de force of genre-bending, a brilliantly realized exercise in science fiction.\"--The New York Times Book Review\n\nIn the twenty-fifth century, humankind has spread throughout the galaxy, monitored by the watchful eye of the U.N. While divisions in race, religion, and class still exist, advances in technology have redefined life itself. Now, assuming one can afford the expensive procedure, a person's consciousness can be stored in a cortical stack at the base of the brain and easily downloaded into a new body (or \"sleeve\") making death nothing more than a minor blip on a screen. Ex-U.N. envoy Takeshi Kovacs has been killed before, but his last death was particularly painful. Dispatched one hundred eighty light-years from home, re-sleeved into a body in Bay City (formerly San Francisco, now with a rusted, dilapidated Golden Gate Bridge), Kovacs is thrown into the dark heart of a shady, far-reaching conspiracy that is vicious even by the standards of a society that treats \"existence\" as something that can be bought and sold. Praise for Altered Carbon \"Compelling . . . immensely entertaining . . . [Richard] Morgan's writing is vivid and his plotting inventive.\"--The Philadelphia Inquirer \"A fascinating trip . . . Pure high-octane science fiction mixes with the classic noir private-eye tale.\"--Orlando Sentinel \"Gritty and vivid . . . looks as if we have another interstellar hero on our hands.\"--USA Today\n\nPrice: $9.50"
