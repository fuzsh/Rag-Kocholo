        "text": "The Changeling Sea is (and I have a feeling that I’ll be saying this about every McKillip novel) a short, dreamlike fairy tale. It is mostly about loss and longing. The 14 year old Peri lives with her mother at the sea shore and ever since the sea took her father from her, she’s angry and silent. She’s angry at the sea, and angry at her mother, who also fell silent and does nothing but stare wistfully at the sea. Peri feels that the sea has taken both her parents from her.\n\nOne day she throws a hex into the sea, telling it to stop taking what was theirs and to give up its mysteries. Then the sea answered.\n\nPatricia McKillip writes like a keen observer of nature and of human nature. Peri as a young teenager is on the cusp of leaving childhood. She’s not really aware of her own feelings yet, half submerged in childhood dreamworlds, yet starting to feel attraction and shame for the first time. Just like she is in transition between child and adult, she’s stuck between the land and the sea. And the way McKillip writes about the seashore with its sights, sounds and smells is just beautiful.\n\nTake those sweet feelings of watching the sea and longing for lost things, add a dash of magical creatures and a spoonful of princes and kings, and the whole thing starts to feel a bit like a Ghibli animated feature. Like Ponyo or Howl’s Moving Castle. Once a magician enters the story, it has hints of Peter S. Beagle’s The Last Unicorn (1968) as well. That cheeky magician Lyo is my favorite character and channels a great portrayal of magic by McKillip.\n\nIn a way, this book is about a magical land beneath the sea. Yet, McKillip doesn’t really show it upfront. She hints at it and flirts with the mystery of it, and this sideways, slanting approach towards fantasy makes it all much more magical and infused with a sense of yearning to know more.\n\nRomance enters the story with two different guys. That isn’t usually my cup of tea, but the characters are superb and the writing is charming, so there’s little to complain about. One is a dreamy-eyed prince who can’t love Peri because he’s only half human, and he seeks his mother in the sea. He would be played by Timothee Chalamet in an adaptation. The other one is his brother: a human living in the sea as a creature. It’s a bit strange that both find their way to Peri’s little house.\n\nThe story takes some unexpected turns yet follows a certain intuitive dream logic. I like that most of it plays out in a small fishers’ village that is turned upside down because of the sea behaving strangely. Nicely contained in location and characters, this short novel still holds a richness of storytelling.\n\n8/10"
