        "text": "Jeannette Walls is best known as the author of “The Glass Castle,” a searing but hopeful memoir about her childhood with a dad who thought the FBI was after him, a mom who saved a Hershey bar for herself when her kids were hungry, and a house where the toilet was a yellow bucket.\n\nThe book has been on The New York Times best-seller list for 340 weeks, which is one of the reasons Walls lives now on a 200-acre farm in Virginia complete with not just indoor plumbing, but horses and a cottage out back.\n\nWalls will be at Point Loma Nazarene University Wednesday at 7 p.m. as part of the 19th annual Writer’s Symposium by the Sea.\n\nQ: Your latest book, “The Silver Star,” is a novel. What was it like for you to make stuff up?\n\nA: It’s funny. A lot of people said writing a novel must be easier because you get to make up whatever you want. I find the opposite to be true because when you are basing your book on things that really happened you don’t have to worry: Could this happen? Is this credible? So I think it’s actually a greater challenge. It’s sort of like navigating without a map.\n\nQ: For obvious reasons, you have an interest in kids who grow up without much help from their parents. Have you given much thought to why some kids succeed and others don’t?\n\nA: I think about it a lot. I was talking to a psychologist not long ago who feels that the most prevalent form of child abuse in America today is overindulgence. Their parents do too much for them. I was also talking recently to a teacher who said it’s not even helicopter moms anymore. It’s snowplow moms. They remove all the obstacles in a child’s path.\n\nThat being said, sometimes a burden is too great. It’s too much to ask of a kid and I think that’s the thing I was trying to address in “The Silver Star.” I hope I’m adding to the dialogue. If we can figure out how to step into these situations where kids are struggling and give them the tools that they need to make it on their own without giving them a crutch that they use for the rest of their lives — that’s the challenge, isn’t it?\n\nQ: Your memoir “The Glass Castle” is such a revealing book about you and your family. Does that intimacy prompt people to tell you their secrets?\n\nA: Oh, all the time and it’s one of the great blessings of having told my story. Sometimes people tell me things that they’ve never told anybody before because they feel safe with me. A reader will come up in line and he or she will look like somebody just polished them, they’ve got their act completely together, and they’ll start telling me about their childhood. It’s this incredible ongoing lesson to me not to jump to conclusions about people based on the way that they look.\n\nQ: Why do you think the book has resonated with so many people for so long?\n\nA: I think that people like knowing first of all that somebody’s childhood was weirder than their own. They say, “Man, I thought I had a crazy mom.” But I think it also gives them courage. I get this in letters from kids all the time: “If you made it out of your situation, I can make it out of mine.”\n\nQ: Has the success of “The Glass Castle” been liberating for you?\n\nA: Oh, my gosh. In so many ways. First of all, I could quit the day job (as a gossip journalist) and stop writing about celebrities. More importantly, more significantly and profoundly, I was ashamed of my story. That’s a slight oversimplification; I loved my parents and in some weird way I was proud of them as well, but I felt it was so complicated that nobody would understand it. I was completely convinced that if people knew the truth about me I would become a pariah. And I really underestimated people. I underestimated their goodness and kindness.\n\nLucky doesn’t even begin to describe it. I’m shocked and stunned by how fortunate I am. Somebody asked once if this is a dream come true. I would have never dared to dream anything this bold and outrageous. “Oh, I hope it stays on the best-seller list for five years.” This doesn’t happen, OK? You don’t hope for that. You hope to get it published. You hope that people don’t laugh at you and ridicule you, which is sort of what I expected.\n\nQ: How are things with your mom?\n\nA: Oh, mom’s a hoot. She lives with us on our property, out back. She has a cottage. I see her every day, we go up to see the horses, and she comes in and has dinner with us a couple of times a week. She’s so smart, but I still find her a little maddening sometimes. She can be so brilliant and such a knucklehead in the same conversation. She loves life. She paints like a fiend. She still rides horses. She’s great. It’s really good.\n\nIt’s funny for me to kind of come full circle because I definitely have a relationship with her in which I’m sort of the parent. She has this facility, any electronic device she touches — we’re having a problem with her phone right now and we’re trying to get it re-connected. She and the modern world just don’t go together. She’s also a great source of joy to me. She lives for the moment. And she’s one of the happiest people I know.\n\nQ: And she has no expectations of you. What’s that like?\n\nA: It’s very interesting because I think one of the burdens that a lot of my peers have is they’re always trying to please their mom. They’re always trying to live up to these impossible standards of their perfect mom. I don’t have that problem.\n\nI’ve come to realize mom has never criticized me. She’s never told me what she wanted of me. She’s never disapproved of anything I’ve done. People say, “Oh she must be so proud of you.” Actually, not really. And I say that without bitterness or anger. She has no proprietary sense over me.\n\nQ: Now your father, I imagine he would have been proud of you.\n\nA: Yeah. Dad would have been real proud. Another complicated person. I’ll be honest: I miss him and I entertain the fantasy that if he were around today I could get him to stop drinking. Of course I couldn’t.\n\nQ: But you could help him get that glass castle built. Well, maybe you already have it.\n\nA: I think in some ways we’ve already done that. I think the glass castle was less about a physical structure than about a hope and a dream for the future. And I’ve got a big ol’ fancy house now with four flush toilets. So I’ve got nothing to complain about."
