        "text": "Author: Richard K. Morgan\n\nTitle: Altered Carbon\n\nFormat: paperback\n\nPages: 544\n\nSeries: Takeshi Kovacs #1\n\nFor years I have maybe not avoided but intentionally not looked for Altered Carbon, despite all the accolades and furore it has garnered and made. Something in its tone seemed a bit off, as if trying too hard, perhaps for audiences skewed more toward categories I don’t belong to.\n\nWell, I have finally read Altered Carbon and can confirm my intuition. Also, in a one in a million situation, I can attest that the TV series (the first season) is actually better than the book. Which is not to say that the book is bad, it’s just mid, characterized by an overabundance of wish-fulfilment sex spilling off the pages in most inopportune moments, an extremely badass and hence rather unbelievable protagonist who subsists on coffee, whisky and aforementioned sex (but, being health-conscious, tries valiantly to stop smoking), as well as an encyclopaedia of noir tropes parading one after another in a rather unintentional parody of both dystopian and noir genres.\n\nStill, it’s fast, addictive and immersive, and as long as you’re in for the raid, you won’t notice most of the flaws (except the sex scenes, which are at once gratuitous and super boring, a strange nuisance in an otherwise easy flow of the plot). I liked the dystopian vibe, the excesses of post-late capitalism laid bare in all their gruesome tackiness. I enjoyed the effort that went into creating a world where the fundamental economic inequality between the have and have-nots is further exacerbated by technological progress, and is translated into life inequality at its starkest – the divide between those who have access to eternal life through countless clones and sleeves, and those who serve as chattel for the rich, whose bodies are taken away from them and sold to the highest bidder. Morgan’s world is believable because it’s so nasty – power begets power, money begets money, but if you have neither, you are nothing more than fodder for the rich, without a chance to break from the vicious circle of being constantly preyed upon due to being weak, and being weak because you’re a prey.\n\nThe noir cyberpunk vibe perhaps comes out the most vibrantly when we accompany our protagonist Kovacs on his case to various suspicious locales, sniffing out vices and secrets of the rich and powerful, hacking into secure storages, causing mayhem in vaults and computer systems, conversing with AIs and being tortured in dirty and inescapably realistic virtual reality. While I don’t think Morgan’s choices are generally sexist (beyond his insistence that every woman in Altered Carbon is panting to spread her legs before the main protagonist, that is) they are certainly unusually rich in unnecessary, obfuscating detail – why on Earth do I need to read that the body Kovacs is being tortured in has just started its period? And, if we are to delve so deep, why not go a step further and offer another paragraph on the exact type of period the body experiences, is it a really strong and painful one you can feel in all your lower back and hips, that makes you want to curl into a ball and be left alone, or is it perhaps something lighter, just a general languorous ache that makes your body slightly over sensitive to every stimulus but doesn’t render you utterly miserable? I could write an entire essay on the topic, but I really don’t see the point – neither in writing the essay, nor in reading about such details in a SF detective novel.\n\nAltered Carbon was Morgan’s debut so perhaps these missteps and weird stylistic choices are to be expected. What is more bothersome to me is that beyond putting effort into creating a world that is as rotten as it is luridly glamorous, Morgan doesn’t really strain his imagination – both the protagonist and the plot are something straight from a cookie cutter, Takeshi Kovacs as a Sam Spade clone with some nifty spec ops skills delving into the smelly underbelly of a futuristic city to understand actions of a 300-year-old, filthy rich client bored with life almost to death. The parade of tropes never ends, the blonde femme fatale, the feisty sidekick policewoman and her trustworthy crew, abductions, tortures, threats and reversals of fortune, fistfights and gun fights, old foes deftly manipulating the game from the shadows… Everything and more from the genre is here, the pulp supposedly serving as a foundation for the sci-fi flavoured critique of our own deeply unfair systems, but, taken too seriously by the author, ends up turning into a parody of the critique, too full of itself to become a mirror for others.\n\nStill, it’s easy on the eyes, both in the form of a novel and in the form of a TV series. Perhaps if I hadn’t seen the TV series first I would have been more surprised, or less critical; as it is, the Netflix adaptation is very faithful and the changes they made are generally for the better – particularly the hotel AI who deservedly gets more screen time. I don’t regret reading the novel, but I also don’t see myself reading the sequels."
