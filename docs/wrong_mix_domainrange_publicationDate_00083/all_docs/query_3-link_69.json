        "text": "We live in a universe that contains a wealth of literature, which sadly, often leaves little time for rereading old favorites. However, if I could name one novel that I could read over and over again, it would be Shirley Jackson’s We Have Always Lived in the Castle. Like most of you, my introduction to this writer was in high school with her short story “The Lottery.” While that is one of the finest short stories I’ve ever read, it also angers me that the delights of her literary oeuvre is not taught in the classroom. I could easily make a case for this with one of the finest ghost stories ever penned, The Haunting of Hill House, or the sheer number and breadth of her short stories. However, the work that made Shirley Jackson one of my all-time favorite authors is her final novel, published before her untimely death at the age of 48. It’s a short book, in fact, it’s easily one you could read in a day, as I just did. While billed as a mystery novel, it really is an extraordinary work of literary fiction that burrows deep into the concept of isolation. The novel also is Shirley Jackson at her most autobiographical and the best way to truly understand the workings of this genius mind and troubled soul.\n\n“My name is Mary Katherine Blackwood. I am eighteen years old, and I live with my sister Constance. I have often thought that with any luck at all, I could have been a werewolf, because the two middle fingers on both of my hands are the same length, but I have to be content with what I had. I dislike washing myself, and dogs, and noise. I like my sister Constance, and Richard Plantagenet, and Amanita phalloides, the death-cup mushroom. Everyone else is our family is dead.”\n\nIn that first chapter, we are introduced to 18-year-old Mary Kathleen “Merricat” Blackwood, on her way from a secluded old mansion that she lives in with her elder sister, Constance, and uncle, Julian, to buy some groceries in the nearby village. It immediately becomes apparent that Merricat is viewed as an outcast by the townsfolk, to the point of ridicule and bullying. Later, we learn the reasons behind this, as everyone in Merricat’s family was poisoned during a dinner with arsenic, with Constance being arrested, and later acquitted for the crime. The townsfolk believe that Constance murdered her family and that due to the family’s extensive wealth and influence, she was able to get away with the crime. The exact details are difficult to determine, as the story is told from the point-of-view of Merricat, an unreliable narrator. She hates just about everyone she comes into contact, and is only affectionate towards her sister while striving to treat her uncle better. Constance stays secluded inside the family home, and a garden walk is considered a breakthrough for her. Uncle Julian spends his days composing a manuscript of the murder, trying to make sense out of what happened and why he was spared.\n\nMerricat as the narrator works well and adds an entire new layer of creepiness to the novel. She believes in witchcraft and practices odd rituals in order to prevent the outside world from entering their home. These rituals consist of things like burying household objects, nailing things to trees, and avoiding saying certain words. Merricat talks about these practices matter-of-factly and fantasizes about living with her sister on the moon.\n\nThe three go through their normal routines, until one day, a cousin named Charles shows up at their doorstep. Normally, the family would deny or briefly humor such visitors. But Constance says Charles is family, and a visit soon becomes an extended stay. Charles is a charmer searching for money and does all he can to influence the lonely Constance and win her trust. Merricat, of course, feels threatened by the intrusion, leading to unforeseen consequences that further the alienation of Merricat and Constance from the townspeople. The ending is particularly poignant in regards to the sisters’ outcome and how the townspeople respond. Merricat is the perfect reflection of the mind of her creator, an eccentric who moves to the beat of her own drummer. Everyone else is viewed as a liability in Merricat’s eyes, except perhaps for the family cat, Jonas.\n\nShirley Jackson is a writer that walked in two worlds. If you have read any of her short stories (which I highly recommend), they either focus on the supernatural or on the problems with domestic life. Sadly, mental illness was no stranger to Jackson’s life. She allegedly suffered from anxiety and depression leading to her untimely death. Jackson also often felt like an outsider, and this theme of being an outcast comes forth in many of her works.\n\nWe Have Always Lived in the Castle ranks among my favorite books due to both its supernatural themes and its deeper introspection into small town persecutions. I felt like the book is solidly embedded in the tradition of Gothic fantasy, without the more boring elements that often occur. The Blackwood home is fantastically described by Jackson, and at times, feels like a character itself. The twisted domestic life of the sisters works well in this setting, and I liked how there is never anything concrete in regards to supernatural occurrences. For me, each sister seemed to represent an aspect of Jackson’s character. There was Constance who never left the house and took care of all the domestic duties. Then there was the wildly free-spirited Merricat who was very off balance.\n\nSPOILER WARNING AHEAD!\n\nMy one complaint about the book is that I wished there had been a more specific motive given for why Merricat poisoned the family. I understand that she is mentally unbalanced, and there are hints scattered throughout the narrative that she often felt mistreated by the adults in the household. I think this novel could have been even stronger had there been something specific which had occurred.\n\nI suppose you could say that there is a happy ending of sorts despite what occurs to the sisters. If you haven’t read this novel before, I highly recommend you give it a try. The Haunting of Hill House is another great one. Actually, just read everything by Shirley Jackson.\n\n“On the moon we wore feathers in our hair, and rubies on our hands. On the moon we had gold spoons.”\n\nHave you read this book? I’d love to know your thoughts! Let me know with a comment below."
