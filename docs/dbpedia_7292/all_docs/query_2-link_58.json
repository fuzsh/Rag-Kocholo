        "text": "In the course of its history Santa Croce has paired its Franciscan religious identity with a secular identity based on the celebration of men and women distinguished by their virtue, setting examples to serve as inspiration. The tour focuses on the great figures mentioned by Ugo Foscolo in his Sepolcri, the poem that consecrated Santa Croce as the “Temple of Italy’s Glories”. The tour explores the value of public memory and the way it is constructed, through an analysis of the monuments celebrating these illustrious figures.\n\nHow to participate\n\nThe visit is free and can be booked online on our website together with the entrance ticket, which is free for residents of the Municipality of Florence. Reservation is mandatory and will be available soon."
