Italian literature began in the 12th century with vernacular lyric poetry that originated in Occitan and spread to Italy. A notable early work was the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri in the late 13th century. The Renaissance saw a flourishing of humanist ideas and developments in drama, with figures such as Petrarch, Leonardo da Vinci, and Lorenzo de Medici making significant contributions. Italian literature continued to develop over the centuries, with movements like Neorealism in the early 20th century and writers such as Luigi Pirandello and Italo Svevo gaining international acclaim.",
