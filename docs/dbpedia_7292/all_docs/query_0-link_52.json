He writes:\n\nDie historische Bildung unsrer Kritiker erlaubt gar nicht mehr, da es zu einer Wirkung im eigentlichen Verstande, nmlich zu einer Wirkung auf Leben und Handeln komme: auf die schwzeste Schrift drken sie sogleich ihr Lchpapier, auf die anmutigste Zeichnung schmieren sie ihre dicken Pinselstriche, die als Korrekturen angesehn werden sollen: da war's wieder einmal vorbei. Nie aber ht ihre kritische Feder auf zu flien, denn sie haben die Macht ber sie verloren und werden mehr von ihr gefrt, anstatt sie zu fhren. Gerade in dieser Malosigkeit ihrer kritischen Ergse, in dem Mangel der Herrschaft ber sich selbst, in dem, was die Rmer impotentia nennen, verrt sich die Schwhe der modernen Perslichkeit. (141-42)\n\n(The historical culture of our critics will no longer permit any effect at all in the proper sense, that is an effect on life and action: their blotting-paper at once goes down even on the blackest writing, and across the most graceful design they smear their thick brush-strokes which are supposed to be regarded as corrections: and once again that is the end of that. But their critical pens never cease to flow, for they have lost control of them and instead of directing them are directed by them. It is precisely in this immoderation of its critical outpourings, in its lack of self-control, in that which the Romans call impotentia, that the modern personality betrays its weakness.) (87)\n\nNietzsche believed that this thirst for historical knowledge engenders a confusing surplus of images and ideas that tempers the immediacy of experience and produces an ironic detachment from the present in the weakened or \"impotent\" modern personality. We can live as heroes, he argues, only by freeing ourselves from this \"ungeheure Menge von unverdaulichen Wissenssteinen\" (huge quantity of indigestible stones of knowledge), and embracing, like his beloved ancient Greeks, the \"geschlossen und ganz\" (rounded and closed) horizon of the present. In the current historicist critical climate-and in an information age marked by its capacity for retrieving, synthesizing, and storing historical information-it is difficult not to appreciate the prophetic qualities of his text. By reducing critical awareness to historical self-consciousness, however, Nietzsche perhaps overstates his case. As David Perkins writes, the aim of literary history is \"not merely to reconstruct and understand the past\" but \"to explain how and why a work acquired its form and themes and, thus, to help readers orient themselves\" (177). In his critique of Nietzsche, Perkins argues that literary history is also \"literary criticism,\" and its \"function lies partly in its impact on reading\" (177-78). Less optimistic, Ren Wellek and Austin Warren encompass the concerns of Nietzsche and his commentators by asking: \"Is it possible to write literary history, that is, to write that which will be both literary and a history?\"\n\nBeyond this skeptical query lingers a more practical but no less troubling question: as difficult as literary history may be to write, can sound literary criticism exist without it? One need only think of I. A. Richards's experiment at Cambridge in the 1920s, when he challenged students to interpret poems without providing them with any literary-historical context. The responses ranged from the plausible to the absurd, and the task of extrapolating critical principles from the \"astonishing variety of human responses\" proved daunting. The results of Richards's survey lent empirical legitimacy to what became a touchstone of reader-response theory: as a rhetorical structure and aesthetic construct, the literary text inevitably draws on the reader's historically conditioned Erwartungshorizont (horizon of expectations) with regard to such elements as genre, theme, and tone. Questions about the vexed relationship between literary criticism and literary history persist. Can we speak intelligently of literature without the dreaded \"blotting-paper\" of Nietzsche's critic-historian? What occurs when we read a text or corpus of texts without also reading around or behind them-that is, without taking into account biographies, information on readership, political and historical data, a sense of the author's formal concerns, even literary anecdotes or gossip? Nietzsche labeled the historicizing critic a \"neuter\"; but without the requisite literary-historical groundwork, without this neutrality, can one ascend to higher aesthetic ground and approach Nietzsche's coveted \"monumental\" criticism? The strange career of Italian Romanticism would suggest this is not possible, for the expectations that have shaped foreign responses to Italian culture since the Romantic age continue to preempt most people outside of Italy from reading modern Italian literature objectively and productively.\n\nLeading Romanticists have attested to the \"carving up\" of nineteenth-century English studies into discrete critical, historical, and ideological units that seldom dialogue with their counterparts. The student of the Italian Ottocento cannot contemplate the energy involved in this professional partitioning without some jealousy. Although English and, to a lesser extent, French and German Romanticism are well enough established in the anglophone critical discourse to guarantee their survival in this carved-up terrain, Italian Romanticism has been a casualty of the new literary historiography. Today's comparative literary historians tend either to focus on canonical texts and traditions or try to recover voices from the literary past that ideology has stifled and that inherited aesthetic standards have rejected. Consequently, many \"middle-ground\" works or literary cultures that are neither canonical nor marginal have escaped comparative study, and one of these betwixt and between literary cultures, Italian Romanticism, has well nigh disappeared from the foreign critical scene. Italian Romanticism was far more cosmopolitan in scope than its foreign critics have acknowledged; the relative lack of attention to it abroad has occurred because of issues of nationalism, religion, and cultural mythmaking.\n\nI\n\nIn the provocatively entitled Il romanticismo italiano non esiste (Italian Romanticism does not exist; 1908), Gina Martegiani writes that so-called Italian Romanticism merely echoed the foreign, European strand of Romantic thought derived primarily from German theory and such Nordic movements as the Sturm und Drang. She argues that Italian authors between the French Revolution of 1789 and the European revolutions of 1848 were actually provincial \"anti-romantici\" (anti-Romantics) who countered the cosmopolitan cult of genius and individuality with a neoclassical group mentality. Gods are gods because they lack goals and self-consciousness, Martegiani reports, quoting Friedrich Schlegel's Lucinde (1799)-but her Italian Romantics never sought this heaven on earth, as they aspired solely to patriotic acts (96-97). Even the influential principle of Romantic irony elaborated by Friedrich Schlegel in his Athenum fragments did not affect Martegiani's ersatz Italian Romantics. In her critique of Manzoni's \"anima semplice\" (simple soul), she remarks that whereas the authentic Romantic could view his own life as a spectator and harness the creative energies of his divided self, Italians of the Ottocento countered this ironic state with some practical act (105-7). In short, Martegiani claims that the Italians failed to satisfy the sine qua non of any self-respecting Romantic: they did not take the absolute seriously enough.\n\nNotwithstanding the extravagance of Martegiani's claims, they reflect the highly partisan and polemical nature of Italian Romanticism's reception, beginning with the politically charged debates that accompanied its inception. After Napoleon's defeat and the negotiations of the Congress of Vienna in 1814-15, the Austrians assumed control of the most developed part of the Peninsula, Lombardy, where the regime established the journal Biblioteca italiana (Italian library) to showcase its policies and rally the Italian intelligentsia to its cause. Though Foscolo initially went on record against writers who aligned themselves with the ruling class, he eventually accepted-to the astonishment of his literary cohorts-the regime's mandate that he prepare the editorial plan for the new journal. By the time Stal's incendiary article on translation appeared in Biblioteca italiana in 1816, Foscolo had gone into exile to avoid assuming editorship of the journal and swearing allegiance to the Austrian government. Most of the reactions to Stal's article were derivative, abusive, and of dubious worth-with the notable exception of work in the journal Il conciliatore (The reconciler; 1818-19) and, to a lesser extent, in the journal Antologia (Anthology; 1821-33). In the tradition of the great Milanese Enlightenment periodical Il caff (Caf 1764-66), organized by Manzoni's grandfather Cesare Beccaria and the Verri brothers, the liberal Il conciliatore offered informed debate on the pressing issues of the day, including those of a scientific and technical nature. The journal also benefited from the contributions of authors, including Foscolo's protector Vincenzo Monti and Stal's translator Pietro Giordani, who had left the Biblioteca italiana in disgust once they recognized its propagandistic agenda. Il conciliatore provided the forum in which the principal voices in the questione del romanticismo-Giovanni Berchet, Pietro Borsieri, Ludovico di Breme, Silvio Pellico, and Ermes Visconti-explained and promoted the tenets of Romanticism; equally important (and in keeping with the nonpartisan approach suggested by its name), it also published the views of the movement's opponents. However moderate in intent, the journal came under constant censorship and was eventually forced to disband; some of its contributors, most famously Pellico, were jailed. Less interested than Il concliatore in the receding polemics between the classici and romantici, the Florentine Antologia, founded by Gino Capponi and Giovan Pietro Vieusseux, pursued a practical, cosmopolitan agenda aimed at fostering a sense of Italian cultural unity. Notwithstanding its measured editorial policy, it, too, eventually ran afoul of the authorities and was suppressed by the grand duchy of Tuscany.\n\nAt a crucial early juncture in the reception of Italian Romanticism, Francesco De Sanctis dedicated four courses to the subject at the University of Naples (1872-76), lectures that were subsequently edited and published by two distinguished disciples, Francesco Torraca and Benedetto Croce. Essentially, De Sanctis argued that the history of the period centered on the struggles between the liberal schools of thought organized around the measured, reformist Manzoni and the more radical protocols associated with the democratic revolutionary firebrand Giuseppe Mazzini. Following De Sanctis's critical watershed, the two most influential voices in the debates about Italian Romanticism belonged to the self-proclaimed poeta vate (poet-prophet) Giosu Carducci and the philosopher-historian Croce. Carducci's distaste for the movement prejudiced generations of Italians against what he claimed was the egotistical, overwrought, nostalgic, sentimental, and-worst of all-international-minded writing that imitated the few legitimate masters of il romanticismo italiano. Though decidedly less zealous, Croce voiced his skepticism about the movement in the form of a distinction between Romanticism's theoretical advances and, by contrast, its practical failures, especially the paralyzing sentimentality abhorred by Carducci. Croce's negative assessment influenced another major voice in the debates, Giuseppe Borgese, whose Storia della critica romantica (History of Romantic criticism; 1905) argued that the supposed originality and innovativeness of the Italian Romantics represented no real departure from those same entrenched classical principles they believed they were overturning.\n\nPerhaps more damning than the negative evaluations of Martegiani and others is the silence that has followed them outside of Italy. Great comparatist texts by de Man, Hartman, Wellek, and even the formidable Italianist Erich Auerbach devote little or no energy to linking the Italian Romantics to larger questions of European culture and literary history-a striking fact when one considers that the first three were leading scholars of European Romanticism. The aforementioned Romanticism in National Context studies over a dozen national Romantic traditions (including relatively minor movements in Greece, Hungary, and Switzerland) but does not cover Italy. Though the dramatic polemics over Italian Romanticism involved such prominent foreign authors as Goethe, Stal, and Stendhal, we lack translations of most Italian contributions to the debate and many related works by the canonical authors Foscolo, Leopardi, and Manzoni.\n\nHowever ignored Italian Romantics are abroad, within Italian literary circles-pace Martegiani-they remain the subject of an ongoing critical outpouring. Each year brings scores of new articles, biographies, and critical editions explicating the metaphors and detailing the intimacies of the three crowns and lesser-known contemporaries. Most Italian scholars view many of these Romantics not only as authors of the first rank but also as heroes who contributed their literary energies to the Risorgimento. Foscolo, for example, was considered by Mazzini, a so-called padre d'Italia (father of Italy), to be the model of Italian political virtue-a tag that both helped and hindered his literary reception. Another founder of modern Italy, General Giuseppe Garibaldi, was known to carry a copy of Foscolo's Ultime lettere di Jacopo Ortis. Manzoni, for his part, was named senator in 1860, the year Garibaldi invaded southern Italy and set in motion the process of unifying the Peninsula. Leopardi remains fixed in Italian lore partly because of his early patriotic poems \"All'Italia\" (\"To Italy\"; 1818); \"Sopra il monumento di Dante\" (\"By Dante's Tomb\"; 1818); and \"Ad Angelo Mai\" (\"To Angelo Mai\"; 1820), a text devoted to the Vatican archivist who discovered Cicero's antityrannical De republica.\n\nThe connection between Romanticism and the Risorgimento in Italian minds is suggested by the following description of Vittorio Alfieri, arguably the nation's most important pre-Romantic author. The introduction to the definitive edition of Alfieri's works refers to him as a \"prosatore civile e politico\" (civic and political author), whom Europeans and Americans alike remember as much for his devotion to liberty as for his writings-a view that echoes De Sanctis's paradigmatic reading of Alfieri in Storia della letteratura italiana (History of Italian Literature; 1871). Unlike the French or even the American Revolution, however, the Italian Risorgimento did not have enough of an international effect to guarantee that one of its poet-patriots-an ambivalent one, for that matter, who celebrated his aristocratic lineage and came to abhor the French revolutionary uprising-would enter public memory abroad. Indeed, English readers today must still rely on an edition from 1876 for the complete translation of Alfieri's tragedies.\n\nTraditionally, scholars have assigned three primary explanations for the exceptional nature of Italian Romanticism-that is, the movement's ubiquity in Italian scholarship yet its invisibility in foreign criticism. First, Italian authors of the early nineteenth century continued to emulate that same Greco-Roman classical culture that the rest of Romantic Europe had begun to regard with suspicion. Second, Italian Romanticism promoted a pious Catholicism that was out of step with the more rational Protestant cultures of northern Europe. Third, Italian Romantic authors failed to transcend the chaos and contingencies of Italian history and politics to address international currents of thought.\n\n(Continues...)"
