Copyism, Alienation, and the Italian Scribe This is a study of personal revolt and literary conversion among selected Italian writers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. For these authors the writing process is critical to a mutatio vitae that coincides with a redirection of writerly practice away from established cultural norms. In personal terms, the writerly turn involves a reappraisal of one’s views about self, society, and self-expression. This process is heuristic in nature and begins with the author in the role of ‘native informant’ of a cultural group, subject to its linguistic and educational norms, its conventions and protocols. Here the author participates in the literary mode of discourse as a way to participate in a common ethos. As the complexity of literary communication increases, the scribe turns away from this cultural conditioning (or ‘copyism’) and attempts to alter the literary and linguistic tradition by exposing the contradictory nature of the normative within the domain of the arts. Here the author discovers the literary work’s potential to alter the expectations of the reader and be an instrument of social change. As Theodor Adorno writes concerning the hierarchies of postEnlightenment society and aesthetics: ‘One of the primal aesthetic phenomena of the nineteenth century was the stylistic copy. Style-copying is speciﬁcally bourgeois in that it promises freedom while simultaneously curtailing it. Everything is supposed to be available to the grasp of the bourgeois artist. But in grasping it, he stoops to copying.’1 Stated in the terms proposed above: only once a scribe has absorbed a tradition does a meaningful innovation become possible; to acknowledge this is to recognize the complex network of social and linguistic practices that under-\n\n4\n\nThe Revolt of the Scribe in Modern Italian Literature\n\nlies the achievement of personal style. By exploring the links between literature and history, the scribe aims to achieve a kind of universality, to become what Emerson called a ‘Representative Man,’ or indeed a Representative Woman. Such a move is deeply symbolic in and for the culture. In addition to designating a phase in the formation of the individual that is preliminary to revolt, a period of replication of norms and imitation of earlier styles, my use of the ‘scribe’ metaphor aims to emphasize the physicality of the craft of writing. The presence of a writing technology implicates, in the words of Walter Ong, an act of social and noetic ‘distancing’ and an interiorization of written language.2 How the literary scribes of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Italy assume the role of scribe when negotiating their creative impulses concerns a distancing from at least two different verbal regimes: that of the local and oral culture, often dialectal to some degree, and that of the written and standardized national language, behind which the classical tradition of the so-called dead languages retains a certain prominence in the formation of the Italian letterato. As one seeks to formulate a theory of the scribe, therefore, a high value is placed on the author’s involvement in these collective codes while maintaining his or her linguistic authenticity and separateness as an individual artist. Thus, even within an intensely chirographic society, the scribes draw attention to the intimacy of orality. In philosophical terms, the scribe in revolt expresses a processual view of life. In contrast to the philosophies of subjectivism – which deﬁne life as the product of internal senses and mentation – and those of objectivism – which afﬁx identity in empirical or positivistic terms – the process view understands life and identity as emerging from networks of relations that possess their own inherent logic and shared planes of communication. Under the process view, the coherence and stability of literary forms depends on their creative ﬂexibility and adaptability to reality. The subject-object divide is more mutable in this view. Literary practice is deemed to be dialogical, even when that concerns the internal dialogue of a solitary individual. Thus the scribe rejects the merely utopian or aestheticist solutions adopted by the avant-gardes; while such solutions proliferate in the modern period, they only serve to reinforce ‘a cleavage between outside and inside, between individual and collectivity, which, while it may have existed to some extent in antiquity, did not have the concise shape it was to take on later under bourgeois auspices.’3 The scribe in revolt is not concerned with literary rebellion and considers questions of social class as peripheral to the actual changes in consciousness that determine cultural evolution. Evolution is under-\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nstood in this light as neither constant nor guaranteed, but as a process that is at once ‘slow,’ ‘radical,’ and ‘spontaneous.’4 To say that literary revolt is processual is to afﬁrm its epistemological and ethical nature. The work is manifestly concerned with the author’s knowledge of the world and how this is conditioned by ethics. The revolt is not the result of a program so much as a working-through of the complex process of authorship, a process made more difﬁcult by challenges of history itself in the modern era. At the basis of the moral challenge to the scribe is the experience of alienation. This term is understood as referring to a phase in the construction of the self and to the recognition by the mind of something outside oneself, a reality ‘alien’ to one’s concrete experience of nature and of being in the world. In its composite, alienation is to be viewed in terms of the opportunity and challenge afforded by otherness, in spheres ranging from the religious to the secular to the economic to the psychological. As Kenneth Burke writes, ‘Alienation is a term borrowed from Marx, who borrowed it from Hegel, who borrowed it from Diderot. We use it to designate that state of affairs wherein a man no longer “owns” his world because, for one reason or another, it seems basically unreasonable. Alienation has both spiritual and material aspects.’5 The speciﬁc challenge presented by alienation is that of overcoming a sense of moral errancy or loss perceived in oneself and to do so by means of the writerly and humanistic practice of courtesy, humility, and reﬂection. In this sense, alienation has been a constant in Italian literature from its origins to the present day.6 Yet in the modern era the nature of the crises has changed, and thus so has the nature of the revolt that is occasioned in the author who would attempt to restore reason to the world. 2. History, Ethics, and Style At the heart of this change, beginning in the late eighteenth century, is the notion of history. It is only since 1800, writes Charles Olson, that man has begun to overcome alienation by learning that history is the means to restore the familiar. Citing Heraclitus’ statement, ‘Man is estranged from that with which he is most familiar,’ Olson argues that modern man, by seeing his myths as synonymous with his history, has begun to cancel out two thousand years of denial: ‘History is story. It means nothing else as a noun. Heraclitus was the ﬁrst to use the word ... and he used it as a verb: to ﬁnd out for yourself.’7 Olson sees Romanticism as initiating a return to the ‘Actual,’ understood as a process ‘“involving\n\n6\n\nThe Revolt of the Scribe in Modern Italian Literature\n\nacts or action” and “opposed to potential, virtual, theoretical, hypothetical, etc.”.’8 The great novelty of Romanticism is twofold: the pursuit of justice as a primary goal of the literary text, and the reliance on personal experience as the means of deﬁning reality. A precursor in this regard was Giambattista Vico, whose view of history anticipated the shifts of Romanticism. For Vico the poet belongs to a speciﬁc ethos, emerges out of orality, and reﬂects the heroic and imaginary stages of cultural evolution. History, like language itself, is understood as a human product. Philology and myth are deemed to be of great importance to the human striving for self-knowledge and religious or spiritual fulﬁlment. Vico’s extensive research into historical ethnography led him to designate poetry as the original ‘mother tongue’ of humanity; this concept, at once symbolic and realistic, provided him the means to resolve the Cartesian paradox of a knowing object and a feeling subject. After Vico, whose ideation of a poetic logic foresaw a fertile interchange between the areas of philosophy and philology, the study of the poetic documents of the past took on a new validity. The works of Foscolo, Manzoni, and Leopardi possess a strong ‘archaeological’ character. These poets resisted the outward trends of the Romantic movement, even as they contributed to the unique character of Italian Romanticism, which added to the classicism of the Enlightenment a deeper historical and spiritual signiﬁcance. To oppose the status quo at this time required courage and humility, a strict obedience to craft, and an accurate understanding of the need to integrate aesthetic and ethical issues. As seen in these poets, the role of literature in the life of the emerging nation could be encompassed by a newly didactic and dialogical sense of civic mission. What occurs in these authors is a breakup of earlier imitative patterns, and an emphasis on growth, novelty, and emerging ‘Italian’ qualities. It is the act of reframing literary language that carries these authors beyond the realm of technique and virtuosity to the realm of meaning and appropriateness, to a kind of middle ground with respect to the earlier tradition; in the symbolic characters they choose to reﬂect back on their habitus as cultural copyists, one sees the seeds of the liberating steps to follow. One of the modes of this emerging modernity is the dialogic. Bakhtin’s dialogism contains enduring insights for the critic who would view literature as a fundamentally communicative act.9 As one seeks within the literary work the critical terms for its analysis and eventual interpretation (this too being a Bakhtinian insight), one seeks naturally to integrate questions of ethical and social context with those of a more\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nformal, stylistic and philological nature. If one is to convey the verbal texture of the work along with its thematic development, one must adopt a working procedure that moves from the more external and mechanical aspects of a text to its more embedded and disputable cultural information. The attention to the dialogic mode and to such Bakhtinian topics as multivoicedness, prosaics (the rudimentary attachment to the details of everyday life), and the unﬁnished, or open-ended, text is highly compatible with the view of an ethical imperative to restore the familiar and overcome alienation. Such a composite thematics is present in each of this book’s chapters. Thus we share the desire voiced by Cesare Segre ‘to recognize among the most important parameters for the evaluation of a literary work that of ethical commitment.’10 As Segre suggests, such a critical emphasis goes against the Crocean aesthetics, which considers ethics to be incidental to the value of the literary text, located in its intuition, its spirit, and its beauty. So too our emphasis on style goes against Croce, for whom style is a purely literary concept, coinciding with the poetic activity of the author, but not with the materiality of the text’s linguistic features. Stylistic critics such as Terracini or Spitzer, Corti or Mengaldo, see the problems of language variation (for example, between the idiolect, the sociolect, and the normative language) as central to literary analysis. The exceptional literary work is seen by such a critic to exist in tension between the subjective and objective modes of interpretation, which are mediated by a theory of the symbol. The symbolic function of language resolves various working dichotomies: dal carattere simbolico discendono la natura soggettivo-obiettiva del linguaggio e ad un tempo la sua funzione espressivo-signiﬁcativa che si realizza secondo due tendenze necessarie all’atto linguistico: da un lato, il soggetto tende a distinguersi dall’oggetto sul quale opera la sua attività linguistica sino ad attribuire a questo una esistenza e struttura autonoma; ma contemporaneamente, tende a penetrare in esso per ritrovare il proprio essere e i propri modi di essere, espressi in forma intelligibile.11 from the symbolic character descend the objective-subjective nature of language and at once its expressive-signifying function that is realized according to two tendencies necessary to the linguistic act: on the one hand, the subject tends to distinguish itself from the object upon which its linguistic activity is working to the point of attributing to it an autonomous existence and structure; but at the same time, it tends to penetrate the object\n\n8\n\nThe Revolt of the Scribe in Modern Italian Literature in order to reﬁnd its own being and its own ways of being, expressed in an intelligible form.\n\nIn contrast to the subjective tendencies that focus on individual psychology and the objective analyses that limit themselves to parsing linguistic structures, the stylistic critic attempts a mediation based on the premise that the uniqueness of the literary work, its ‘style,’ emerges only from a consideration of its formal, structural, and symbolic features.12 In exploring the nature of literary symbolism, Terracini cites the Cassirean notion that language is a symbolic form that, through reﬂection, ﬁnds within itself the law of its structure. He makes clear that for the desired symbolic synthesis to take place, much analytical work must be done: the study of syntax, lexicon, rhythm, and rhetorical ﬁgures is essential; so too is a consideration of the Saussurean sign in its twofold nature as signiﬁer and signiﬁed. A further concept that emerges for the stylistic critic, is that of ‘distinctive points’ (punti distinti): Il ‘punto distinto’ è quindi una traccia esplicita e diretta del valore simbolico di cui tutto il complesso espressivo è sinteticamente portatore: ma esso a un tempo si manifesta modulato e articolato come viva ‘parola’, anzi come parola storicamente determinata.13 The ‘distinctive point’ is thus an explicit and direct trace of the symbolic value of which the expressive complex is synthetically the bearer: but at the same time it is shown to be modulated and articulated as the living ‘word,’or rather as a word historically determined.\n\nReaders of Spitzer familiar with his ‘philological circle’ will understand that the identiﬁcation of distinctive points depends on the critic’s ability to sense the particular humanity and pathos of a text. Thus the empathy and intuition of the critic are invaluable. Terracini employs such expressions as ‘moti del cuore’ (motions of the heart), ‘moti dell’anima’ (motions of the soul) and ‘brividi’ (shudders) with surprising frequency. By virtue of its engagement of a theory of symbol, the stylistic criticism we advocate is focused on the communicative nature of the literary text; it is not the kind of formalism often associated with stylistics in which the critic’s exclusive attention is on the signiﬁer at the expense of semantics. 3. The Legacy of the Poeta Vate The rare poet who can alter the course of the national life is tradition-\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nally known as the poeta vate. Beginning with the nineteenth century, one might say that the prophetic ﬁgure of the vate, the visionary poet assumed to be the moral conscience of the society, becomes one who contends with prophecy as a metaphor for a deeper understanding of nature and human affairs. In the modern period the vatic vision concerns a new mixture of order and disorder, spiritual harmony and historical complication, natural mysteries and national destinies. It can also be manifest in the acknowledgment of failure, as in Leopardi’s denunciation of the pathetic civic conditions in his country: ‘Se noi dobbiamo risvegliarci una volta e riprendere lo spirito di nazione, il primo nostro moto dev’essere, non la superbia e la stima delle nostre cose presenti, ma la vergogna’ (If at some point we must wake up and take up again the spirit of a nation, our ﬁrst impulse must be, not the pride and esteem of our present things, but shame).14 Leopardi wrote in 1823 that the collective conditioning of Italian letterati had reached a perilous juncture: Sono oggimai più di centocinquant’anni che l’Italia né crea, né coltiva per se verun genere di letteratura, perocché in niun genere ha prodotto scrittori originali dentro questo tempo, e gli scrittori che ha prodotto, non avendo mai fatto e non facendo altro che copiare gli antichi, non si chiamano coltivatori della letteratura, perché non coltiva il suo campo chi per esso passeggia e sempre diligentemente l’osserva, lasciando però le cose come stanno.15 Today it has been more than one hundred and ﬁfty years that Italy neither believes nor cultivates for itself any type of literature, since it hasn’t produced original authors in any genre during this period, and those authors it has produced, who never made anything except for imitations of the ancients, are not to be called cultivators of literature, because a person who diligently walks through a ﬁeld and observes it, leaving everything there unchanged, is not a cultivator of that ﬁeld.\n\nLeopardi’s ethical critique of modernity was supported by an intense philological activity and attention to the artisanal speciﬁcity of writing. Excluding all but the lyric genre from the forms of poetry appropriate to his age, Leopardi was able to transcend his own materialism by means of a poetics of indeterminacy rooted in his study of the ancients. Eschewing the errors of his contemporaries (on either side of the Romantic controversy), he reafﬁrmed the importance of philology in an era when he felt that science was ignored. As one sees in the following entry from the Zibaldone, the poet suggests a connection between the Greek word\n\n10\n\nThe Revolt of the Scribe in Modern Italian Literature\n\n‘scribe,’ the French ‘grefﬁer’ (recorder, scribe), and the English ‘grief’: ‘graMeu;õ (scriba) – grefﬁer (se non viene da grief ).’16 In the ﬁnal entry of the Zibaldone, Leopardi wrote as follows about the difﬁculty of achieving genuine social change: La cosa più inaspettata che accada a chi entra nella vita sociale, e spessissimo a chi v’è invecchiato, è di trovare il mondo quale gli è stato descritto, e quale egli lo conosce già e lo crede in teoria. L’uomo resta attonito di vedere veriﬁcata nel caso proprio la regola generale.17 The most unexpected thing that happens to one upon entering the social life, and quite often to one who has grown old there, is to ﬁnd the world as it has been described and as he already knows it and believes it to be in theory. Man remains stunned to see the general rule veriﬁed in his own case.\n\nThough he is not one of the authors studied here, Leopardi casts a long shadow over the literature of the twentieth century, as a poet and commentator on the troubled state of the Italian culture. In the early nineteenth century, as Giulio Bollati writes, the fact that ‘the Italian’ exists is incontrovertible. But what exactly the Italian is is the subject of considerable debate. A key ﬁgure in this transition is Foscolo, whose primary literary model was Vittorio Alﬁeri. As a writer of tragedies, Alﬁeri opposed tyranny but did so from a largely ahistorical and pre-national context. The same was true of Foscolo’s ﬁrst tragedy, Tieste (Thyestes, 1797). But in his treatment of the Ajax myth, Ajace (Ajax, 1811), one ﬁnds a historical reﬂection on justice and the doctrine of raison d’état with references to the national question.18 Foscolo’s version of the Ajax tragedy contains his views on the severe limits of justice in human society, and seeks out a system of values – incorporating wisdom, modesty, and compassion – that might compensate for this state of affairs. In writing Ajace Foscolo has gone well beyond the protagonism of Le ultime lettere di Jacopo Ortis (The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis, 1802), a work in which the preeminence of the passions ultimately steers the protagonist to suicide and the author to an effusion of uneven prose. In contrast to this youthful work, in the Ajace the concepts of sacriﬁce and altruism are vivid and complex. While Napoleon is not an explicit target of the Ajace, he is criticized indirectly, not as a member of the class of moralists and politicians (in whom Foscolo found a ‘complete and irreconcilable discord between theory and practice’) but as a monstrous tyrant in the Alﬁerian mode, prepared to sacriﬁce thousands of Italians in\n\nIntroduction 11\n\norder to gain his goal of conquering Russia.19 A pessimistic political vision having debts to Hobbes, Machiavelli, and Vico is combined with a high lyricism, in particular through two characters who fulﬁl the role of the Chorus: Tecmessa, Ajax’s wife, a ﬁgure of modesty and compassion, and Calcante, a seer who advances the message of justice. I illustrate this idea of the choral function through a comparison of the play to Sophocles’ Ajax. Coming at a critical time in Foscolo’s life, between the writing of Dei Sepolcri and Le Grazie, and shortly after the loss of his professorship at Pavia, Ajace has not yet received adequate critical attention.20 The nineteenth century marked the beginning of a quest to universal literacy as advocated by Mazzini, Garibaldi, and D’Azeglio. It is in this context that Alessandro Manzoni represents the foremost moral and linguistic force of the country-to-be, though this fact is ignored by a cadre of experts who have sought to deny Manzoni’s work its political force, as in his support of the French revolution. Such critics have ignored the revolutionary value of Manzoni’s Christianity, which distinguished between the utiliarian and the just, essentially requiring that his literary works be aimed at the institution of a sense of justice through the opening-up of the individual conscience.21 In analysing the ode on the death of Napoleon, Il Cinque maggio (The Fifth of May, 1821), I consider its themes of conversion and Christian piety, also in relation to the poetry of Monti and to Manzoni’s earlier poetry; in the process I consider the logical form and structure of the ode as that of an abduction or imperfect syllogism. Manzoni is not simply a political moderate and linguistic uniﬁer; he is also a ﬁrebrand who reﬂects on the private-public dichotomy and the national destiny. He seeks in the the vatic role the incarnation of a purity that exceeds the boundaries of intellect; his is a vocation to solitude by one who is yet a ‘man of the people.’22 Manzoni, like Foscolo and Leopardi, was educated to the Enlightenment epistemology but came to reject the assumption that reason and logic could dominate Nature. By reinvesting in the cognitive and ethical force of poetic language, these men were instrumental in steering ‘a revolt of human nature against the oppressive power of purely instrumental reason over culture and personality.’23 Despite countless rebellions, strikes, and armed uprisings during the ﬁrst half of the nineteenth century, the ﬁnal act of Italian uniﬁcation was more a fact of diplomacy (a ‘Piedmontization,’ it has been said) than anything else. The ruling aristocracy never intended to destroy the idols of monarchy and empire. Running in parallel to the new nation was the concept and ideal of Italy as it had existed in the literature, the so-called ‘Re-\n\n12\n\nThe Revolt of the Scribe in Modern Italian Literature\n\npubblica delle lettere’ (Republic of Letters), the aspirational nation of the literary patrimony whose linguistic centre was Florence. This vision of Italy possessed extraordinary longevity and continuity, but also a palpable sense of unreality when juxtaposed to the problems of the new nation.24 Even after the annexation of Rome in 1871, the Italian state and the Catholic Church would struggle for decades over questions of the Church’s involvement in public life. In the general climate of unrest, corruption, and poverty, a decisive juncture is marked by the departure of intellectuals and artists from the mainstream culture to form the bohemian movement of Scapigliatura in the 1880s and 1890s. Robert Dombroski writes, Having traded commitment to a channel of mobility that ended in a secure (with respect to the true goals of the risorgimento) patronage for a commitment to succeed ‘in the real world’ (i.e., to establish a genuinely active link between artistic development and social change), the intellectuals then found themselves excluded from the possibility of achieving the status they felt they deserved, as moral and spiritual guide for the nation they were working for.25\n\nSuch was the social reality for Giovanni Pascoli, Gabriele D’Annunzio, Italo Svevo, and Grazia Deledda, who came of age during this period. In 1905 one sees the passing of the torch from the vate Giosue Carducci to his successor at the University of Bologna, Giovanni Pascoli; at this time European poets had experienced a lowering of stature in the society as a whole, owing to the long-term effects of the Industrial Revolution – which was slower to arrive in the South – and the massiﬁcation of society. In Pascoli one ﬁnds the vatic insights deriving from a devotion to nature and to the rhythms of the seasons. Though he also pursued civic poetry and compiled a substantial number of patriotic poems, Pascoli’s most visionary works are humble evocations of small, intimate spaces and relations. If there was ever a maternally sensitive poet it was Pascoli, for whom woman comes to symbolize the balance between intellectual and material concerns, between obedience to forms and the spontaneity of creative growth, between pattern and matrix, patria and matria. Pascoli was a master of Greek and Latin verse composition, and an unparallelled master of metrical composition in Italian. He never travelled out of Italy, nor was he noticeably inﬂuenced by the French symbolist writers, whose advent had marked a kind of rupture between the ﬁgure of the author and the society. My comparison of two poems by Pascoli to two poems\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nby Attilio Bertolucci offers an occasion to examine the notion of intertextuality; the obvious similarities between the works suggest that Bertolucci derives considerably from Pascoli, viewing nature from the immediate material and biological context of the family setting, in the lyric succession of seasons and generations. With the twentieth century came the expansionist wars in Africa (billed as a way to elevate the Italian worker), interventionism, the ‘mutilated victory’ of the First World War, the rise of Fascism and its state economy of syndicalism and corporatism. With the Lateran Pacts (1929) the Catholic Church enjoyed new secular powers and became an active partner in the repression of Italian civil society. 1938 was the year of the Pact of Steel, the institution of the Race Laws, and the victory of the Spanish Falange. Mussolini’s support of the war against the Spanish Republican movement was the last straw for many Italians and set the stage for Italy’s next civil war, that of 1943–5. Not until the end of Fascism would Italy dismantle its monarchy; even then, however, it did not destroy the icons of monarchy. The decadenti were followed by the crepuscolari and futurists and other variations on the avant-garde, then by the so-called ‘pure poetry’ and hermeticism.26 What these tendencies have in common is the construction of the poem around internal references and the elevation of expressonism over direct social communication. This convulsively innovative generation of poets – including Campana, Rebora, Lucini, Marinetti, Palazzeschi, Onofri, Gozzano, Corazzini – ﬂourished in the years prior to the First World War. As Renato Poggioli writes, their prevailing ‘poetics of the Word’ was already present in Pascoli and D’Annunzio: With its symbolistic concept of the word as synthesis of sound and symbol, that poetry re-enters, actually and potentially, with excess and defect, into a dialect of often extreme and antithetical alternations: D’Annunzio’s word sensation and Pascoli’s word-dream; Saba’s word passion and Quasimodo’s word-sentiment; and, a ﬁnal paradox, Montale’s word-object and the wordincantation of Ungaretti. Enough to show that, in the poetics of the Word, it is not God who is made Word, but Word made God.27\n\nOne cannot read this estimation by the great critic without detecting some irony. Poggioli had expatriated to America in order to avoid Fascist persecution; he could not be indifferent to the exaltation of the Word if that action presumed to defend the regime or embolden the poet to assume a demiurgic or mythic stature, as was obviously the case with D’Annunzio.\n\n14\n\nThe Revolt of the Scribe in Modern Italian Literature\n\nYet Poggioli is meticulous in his attention to the literary fact; his views of Italian modernity engage a sociology of criticism (in particular the ideas of Vilfredo Pareto), but avoid the coarseness of an ideological critique. As he states in a presentation of translations of four contemporary poets, including Ungaretti and Montale, ‘It is easy enough to reconstruct what might be called the passive tradition of a literature, the tradition known from historic, concrete facts; but, on the other hand, it is almost impossible to give even a valid approximation of the active tradition – that ﬂuid system of changing values, provisional ideals, that vague yet real condition of taste which acts as a kind of unwritten poetics.’28 It is the active tradition that guides Poggioli; in the event of Ungaretti, nothing is said of his allegiance to Fascism; rather his proﬁle is given as ‘the archetype of the mystic poet of illuminations and revelations.’29 Giuseppe Ungaretti’s auto-exegetical essay, ‘Ragioni d’una poesia’ (Reasons for a Poetry), is a composite work of articles and speeches from over a forty-year period. The reasons in question are those that place Ungaretti, as the ‘poet of today,’ in a lineage that includes St Francis of Assisi, Petrarch, Michelangelo, Tasso, Camoëns, and Leopardi, but also in line with such luminaries as Racine, Pascal, and Bergson. The essay, used to introduce the collected poems, Vita d’un uomo, is a chronicle of the poet’s creative development and his response to the perceived religious crisis of the twentieth century. A study of this work allows one to better situate Ungaretti’s poetry in the ethical and aesthetic context of earlier poets – and to see his vatic practice as being complicated by certain historical realities such as the poet’s allegiance to Fascism.30 There are classical mysteries to be investigated in Ungaretti’s work, among them the paradoxical deﬁnition of the vatic. Just as the vate may communicate a far-reaching view into the mysteries of nature and the nation, he may also uncover profound religious truths. A contemporary of Ungaretti’s, Diego Valeri, is also strongly inﬂuenced by Leopardi, but without the protagonism of Ungaretti’s lyrical ‘I.’ One does not ﬁnd in Valeri the abstractness and expressionism of so much modern poetry, nor its straining for the absolute. Already an accomplished poet at the advent of Fascism, Valeri staunchly opposed the regime’s linguistic practices of pomposity, violence, and vacuous celebration. In his ‘pure poetry’ – where his integral engagement of the French poets of the nineteenth century, starting with Baudelaire, must be taken into account – one has a continuation of the classical tradition. Valeri’s homage to Petrarch establishes once and for all the need for Italian literary culture after De Sanctis to rediscover the complex spiritual\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nsymbolism of that most classical of Italian poets. The risks taken by Valeri in his civic life were admirable, as was his dedication to teaching. While faithful to the concrete data of the senses, Valeri was not content with the empirical worldview of the ambient positivistic culture. Rather in his verse composition he sought to combine the impulses of the sensory and emotional world with a mystical involvement in another world, the pristine world of the classical, not without references to Christianity. It was within such a formal nexus and discipline that he approached his customary subjects, which included Nature, Woman, the City (Venice), the Child, and Poetry itself. 4. Roads to Rome: The Feminine Voice A series of nineteenth-century historians noted that severe class divisions were inherent and natural to the Italian people. As Giulio Bollati notes, the moderate (or transformistic) element in the Risorgimento process has been underestimated while the more dramatic and Romantic, Jacobin element has been unduly emphasized.31 Even Mazzini and Garibaldi were prone to supporting the idea of dictatorship, depending on contingencies. A certain strategy of tranformism was defended by Manzoni – a reader of Malthus and Adam Smith – who recognized the laws of capitalism as victorious, but who also feared the political involvement of the Church in an eventual Italian state. Verga too, in documenting the misery of Southern Italy, did so from a patriarchal distance. The emergence of the bourgeoisie as a dominant force in society ensued with roughly two centuries of delay in Italy in comparison to northern European countries. The persistence in Italy of a two-tiered society, of aristocracy and plebeians, long after it had gone from England, France, and Germany was due to its lack of a bourgeois revolution and its slower industrialization (or non-industrialization, if one speaks of the South and the Islands). Naturally this system of separate and unequal was also based on gender. It was only with the twentieth century, as the middle class grew to occupy a central role in Italian culture, that a radical change in the role of women was possible. Having been denied the right to own property until 1865 and the right to attend university until 1874, Italian women only acquired the right to vote in 1945. Thoughout these turbulent years, with the growth of the bourgeoisie, one also witnessed a vast increase in the number of women readers. Walter Ong has written about the literary situation of women as follows: ‘Into the nineteenth century most literary style throughout the\n\n16\n\nThe Revolt of the Scribe in Modern Italian Literature\n\nwest was formed by academic rhetoric, in one way or another, with one notable exception: the literary style of the female authors.’ Not educated in schools of rhetoric and Latin, ‘women writers. . . normally expressed themselves in a different, far less oratorical voice, which had a great deal to do with the rise of the novel.’32 If one keeps this status quo ante in mind, one can combine it with the theoretical perspective detailed below to examine the critical role of the feminine voice in the literature of Italian modernism. Aldo Gargani provides a most useful deﬁnition of the ‘feminine voice’ phrased in terms of the philosophical or epistemological decisions by which one essentially creates one’s ‘version of the world.’ In his patient development of this topic – which leads to a formulation of a speciﬁcally feminine mode of viewing the world – the time of the decision is construed not as a preexisting given, but as a force that binds one to the decision even as one produces it with the decision: ‘Each decision is a grain of time, not a linear distension of time. It is as if every decision constituted a new front of time confronting the startled face of the philosopher. Philosophers have banalized – in terms of the relativism or pluralism of our versions of the world – their temporal qualities, established each time by the decision.’33 Because of the decision’s ‘intransitive’ existence ‘outside the dichotomy of “absolutism” and “relativism,”’ one is confronted in any decision by the presence of the will. If one ignores the will or locates it only in the works of others, there is a breakdown in communication. The masking of wilful involvement hardens into the schemes typical of ‘traditional philosophy,’ centred as it is on ‘time remembered’ and resistant to the inevitable ‘ﬂuctuations’ caused by the decision, which is instead always identical to its own organization, to the totality of its elements: ‘Perceptive representation itself is a decision during which an attitude towards the world proceeds to reunderstand itself, to promote a new expectation, a new way of hoping; as to say, a new way of beginning to be born.’34 Gargani differs with Wittgenstein’s formulation that there is an underlying stratum of ‘representations and images’ to which words make reference: since perception is already a form of logical typing, images too must be decided upon in order to exist. As one comes to recognize the inextricable involvement of the will in the images and representations of one’s ‘version of the world,’ one grows closer to the ‘feminine’ means of construing reality, in Gargani’s terms: La voce femminile...sfronda i fatti, allenta la tensione paranoide con la quale il linguaggio maschile vorrebbe far sentire una necessità dura e\n\nIntroduction 17 ineluttabile; inﬁne essa scopre al di là dei fatti, delle tesi e dei sistemi erettio dagli uomini lo spazio della contingenza, dell’intenzione, del senso. La voce femminile scopre la forma modesta e incerta che si cela dietro l’armatura verbale del linguaggio maschile, che ha paura e al tempo stesso vuol far paura. Per questo la voce femminile si distende un una lunga, interminabile interrogazione che va alle spalle degli uomini, dove essi non riescono a vedere perché naturalmente non vogliono vedere.35 The feminine voice [...] gleans the facts, diminishes and slows the paranoid tension that masculine language would enforce as a hard and ineluctable necessity; in the end the feminine voice discovers beyond the facts, theses, and systems erected by men the space of contingency, intention and sense. The feminine voice uncovers the modest and uncertain form hidden behind the verbal armour of masculine language, which is afraid and at the same time wishes to strike fear. For this reason the feminine voice stretches out in a long, interminable interrogation which goes behind men’s backs, where they can’t see, precisely because they don’t want to see.\n\nSuch a feminine voice and consciousness – present in authors like Virginia Woolf and Ingeborg Bachmann, but also Proust or Lorca – minimizes ﬂat assertions of fact, favouring the interrogative mode; it avoids the verbosity of researchers who don’t identify ‘the matrix of their behaviour, the instinct that pushes them.’36 Lest the masculine/feminine distinction proposed by Gargani seem a bit heavy, we hasten to clarify that the distinction is not intended to situate male and female writers on opposite sides of a divide. Like the yin/yang polarity in Eastern philosophy, the dichotomy can be useful for conceptualizing the opposition of traits that in the ﬁnal analysis are possessed by men and women both. To grasp the ‘space of contingency, intention and sense’ as feminine is simply to recognize the possibility of an alternative to the authoritative language that pervades a patriarchal culture, penetrating even into its literature. To elevate the neglected voice of the matria and, on a metaliterary level, the madre lingua of poetry itself as theorized by Vico is to refute the obsessive and defensive linguistic posture critiqued by Gargani in his essay. I apply this notion to four authors – Grazia Deledda, Elsa Morante, Anna Banti, Amelia Rosselli – for whom the capital city of Rome has a special signiﬁcance and occupies a quasi-mythic stature within the literary work: Rome is a place of solace and refuge, of anonymity and self-discovery. In presenting the feminine voice I keep in mind the sym-\n\n18\n\nThe Revolt of the Scribe in Modern Italian Literature\n\nbolization of primitive cultures that associates the male with ‘form, type, notion, idea, or pattern’ and the female with ‘matter’ and ‘amorphous, transitory, inessential material,’ a symbolization that continued in the patriarchal societies of the twentieth century. Upon realizing this patriarchal arrangement (as shared by the philosophy of idealism), one can envision, in the words of Jean-Joseph Goux, the rediscovery of ‘a dialectized reunion of the two separated poles’: ‘To think of material organizational potency as including the production of concepts, to make mind the offspring of organized matter, is to explode the paterialist barrier between concept and materiality; the “inﬁnity” of matter is once again brought forth into the idea.’37 Each of the women discussed here explodes the paterialist barrier in Italy by reunifying form and matter. Grounded in a realistic view of the material culture, these feminine scribes are dialectical in their ideas, beliefs, and reasoning. This is not to stress material factors over spiritual factors, but rather to pursue ‘a constant interaction between spiritual and material factors.’38 If the presence of the feminine voice depends on the will’s involvement in the formation of one’s version of the world, this voice is not the sole property of women. Proust is the writer of memory – the dominant mode of the feminine voice – who comes most readily to mind. Nevertheless the libido dominandi of the institutional mode of discourse, or masculine world of power, is foreign to it. The feminine voice is thus distinct from those absolutists and relativists who insist respectively on a single shared truth (absolutism) or the truth of individual convictions above all (relativism); either position ignores the centrality of relations as the basis of knowledge and learning. Does a study of the feminine writers necessarily implicate a feminist discourse? The answer is yes insofar as readers have been conditioned to assume a prevalent male identity or authority behind the Text, as in society: a Cartesian subject, detached from commitments, moral actions, or community. Yet beyond this conditioning, one might answer no, seeing in gender an insufﬁcient index for that feminine writing centred on the pathos and intuition of conversing selves rather than on abstractions, declarations of truth, or ‘isms.’ While the authors of the feminine voice are not feminists per se, the extrinsic changes brought about by feminism in Italy are compatible with the world of empathy and affective thinking the feminine voice approaches intrinsically. It should be no surprise that feminine authors employ conventional narrative structures to expand the presence of a feminine voice in ﬁction. As Veronica Franco and Gaspara Stampa had done with the sonnet in the sixteenth\n\nIntroduction 19\n\ncentury, these authors subvert the literary institution from within, investing texts with an uncommon tactility and locality of emotion. It is thus by means of an internalized revolt, contained in the moral decisions and relations of the protagonists, that the work gains its novelty. Here one encounters a leitmotif present throughout the book, which is the scribal opposition to moralistic, ideological, and prescriptive approaches to literature. Such a position cuts transversally through the book’s three parts and is articulated without recourse to overarching analytical systems (or binary oppositions); rather it is articulated slowly in a process of personal becoming that gives weight to the sentiments, the ethical response to contingencies, and the ability to dwell in ambiguity and mystery. For the sake of illustration, we provide here three examples of the feminine voice that are not discussed in the book: these are the works of Sibilla Aleramo, Maria Luisa Spaziani, and Paolo Volponi. Aleramo, whose autobiographical novel Una donna (1906) documents the consequences of male sexual violence and inﬁdelity, reﬂecting realities of both culture and conscience, was a catalyst for a great ﬂourishing of the feminine voice in ﬁction. At age twenty-ﬁve she left her husband and children in the provinces of the Marches, moving to Milan and then Paris, eventually settling in Rome. Aleramo’s tale of her struggle against archaic values and sexual hypocrisy in a village culture is a milestone in Italian ﬁction. Aleramo is raped at ﬁfteen in the southern Italian town where her family has moved from the north. She is then forced to marry the rapist to save herself and her family from ‘disgrace.’ Her husband then tells her of her father’s inﬁdelity with a woman in the village, destroying her respect for the one man who is her beacon. She is then scandalized by a harmless contact with a young man in the village. The initial trauma catalyses a series of inner transformations revealed through her inner dialogue, directed sentimentally to her infant son, who is born despite the wishes of the father, himself a social parasite typical of the culture of hypocrisy in which philanderers cloister their wives. She will only escape at the supreme cost of losing her son. In Rome there will be air to breathe, but her heart will be broken. She becomes friends with a Norwegian colleague at the woman’s magazine where she works. This woman is an image of light and has come to Italy in part because ‘the Italian God is more relaxing. ... You can serve him without exhausting yourself.’39 She gives the woman an insight into the ‘depth of feeling and directness’ of Northern European culture. Each transition – including that to the ‘stable’ job at the magazine – is depicted tentatively, as another in a chain of sacriﬁces. But, tragically, the new friend will soon die. And, as\n\n20\n\nThe Revolt of the Scribe in Modern Italian Literature\n\nif by sybilline vision, Sibilla Aleramo herself will never recover from the separation from her son, nor will the clarity and impact of Una donna be found in her later works. Aleramo’s essays on the oppression of women remain the most enlightened of their time. Her fabled encounters with poets, painters, and others, and the emergence of a D’Annunzian superdonnismo recall in some respects the widely read poet Ada Negri, whose paeans to women workers projected a kind of faceless universality and found an ally in the rising ‘ism’ of the Fascio. Aleramo, for her part, is drawn irresistibly in her later years to the Communist party secretary, Palmiro Togliatti. What is remarkable about Aleramo’s autobiographical text is its felicitous combination of the universality of this woman’s condition and the intensely personal and intimate force of its testimony. The second example I mentioned is given by Spaziani, whose poetry is described by Luigi Baldacci as ‘feminine,’ being a poetry of the ‘voice’ and the ‘head,’ of ‘sensoriality’ rather than ‘sensuality.’ Spaziani’s refusal to opt for the informal diaristic verse that had become the customary response among her peers to the ‘uncommitted’ poetry of the hermetics was due to her awareness of the ‘heroic’ dimension of the feminine situation. The high mission Spaziani reserves for poetry is revealed in her late title, ‘Il mestiere di profeta’ (The Profession of Prophet), in which the antithesis between labour and vision is only apparent: the two are related, and achieved, in the practice of poetry. As Baldacci writes, ‘It is precisely the key of femininity which allows one to enlarge and alienate the persona, in that the situation of isolation from the social context is typical of woman (and thus heroic).’40 A third example of the feminine voice is found in Volponi, the novelist and poet of Urbino whose La strada per Roma (The Road to Rome) is a novel of formation and mock-heroic adventure that presents the sexual nature of ‘the time of decision’ and its space of contingency, intention, and sense. This space is at once the interior and affective space of the protagonist, Guido, and the human landscape of the Marches in the 1950s, the matria that was seeing its population and indigenous customs being eroded. Setting out on the ‘road toward Rome,’ as had Aleramo and Deledda, as well as the heroines of Banti’s Il bastardo and Un grido lacerante, Guido entertains and represses homoerotic sentiments. His road to Rome is one toward anonymity, the threat and possibility of facelessness: liberation from the strait-jacket of provincial mores but also the loss of that familiarity. Guido is the bourgeois member of a pair of leftist friends for whom Urbino is the loved and hated space of their daily lives. His stated project is that of constructing or ﬁnding ‘una morale’ (a set\n\nIntroduction 21\n\nof morals). As he is doing this he hires a lawyer to redraft his dissertation to make it acceptable to his examiners. It is primarily the sexual tension and ambiguity of Volponi’s characters, and the intuitive magnetism of Rome as the destination of the pilgrimage of discovery, that allow us to assess it in terms of its fundamental androgyny. Here as in the other feminine voices, one ﬁnds a purposeful redimensioning of the notion of virility. Furthermore, Volponi’s critique of the male-dominated political and corporate-industrial cultures of Italy stands explicitly on the side of those who have been excluded. One might say that the feminine voice takes its point of departure from the chasm that exists between the matria, the motherland of the provincial culture, and the patria, the overarching institutional and state apparatus. This is a problem in the early part of the twentieth century, when the post-Risorgimento crisis persists through the Giolitti period, into the inferno of the First World War and through the debacle of Fascism. And it remains a grave problem in the years after the Second World War when, despite the hopes of the Italian people for national renewal and increased economic prosperity, women continued to be excluded from full economic and political participation in the national life. Authors such as those in our study came to see this estrangement as analogous to other exclusions, such as those suggested by Octavio Paz in his formulation of the ‘Other’: peasants, women, oppressed nationalities, submerged cultures, Dostoevski’s underground man – the Other that each one of us constitutes, sexuality and its contradictory complement: the aspiration toward the divine, the beliefs that we call irrational, poetry – in a word, all the areas where exception and difference are the rule, the world of Others and the Other. The multiple other that Marx was unable to recognize.41\n\nThe feminine voice in poetry and ﬁction would share in many respects the model of the ‘exception’ represented by this ‘multiple other.’ As Paz suggests, the adherence to a political ideology is not an adequate means to negotiate one’s otherness or to realize one’s selfhood or religious vocation or artistic potential. Yet the documentation of social differences, of class and language, gender and creed, must underlie the literature of revolt. A major issue in this regard is the Italian geography and what Antonio Gramsci called the ‘Southern Question,’ predicated on the notion that Northern Italy had essentially turned the South (including Gramsci’s home island of Sardinia) into a colony which it exploited as it saw ﬁt.\n\n22\n\nThe Revolt of the Scribe in Modern Italian Literature\n\nSardinian novelist Grazia Deledda was an autodidact who gained literary recognition despite the powers of the patrie lettere, including the reigning authority of Italian letters, Benedetto Croce. In her extensive opus one sees the vital role women play in Sardinian culture, especially in terms of what is known as ‘shadow labour.’ There is a rapid progression in Deledda’s career away from the fatalism and sentimentality of her early stories and novels – such as La via del male (The Way of Evil, 1896), Elias Portolu (1900), and Cenere (Ash, 1903) – to the typological allegories of such classic novels as Canne al vento (Reeds in the Wind, 1913) and La madre (The Mother, 1919). It is fair to say that Deledda’s ﬁction has not received an adequate treatment by critics because of a failure to consider the author’s progress, and a failure to integrate the ethno-linguistic elements with the symbolic and religious elements in her work. The Deleddian primitive is allegorical, given the interconnection between the literal and symbolic planes of narrative discourse. In her ﬁnal published book, the posthumous Cosima, o quasi la Grazia (republished as Cosima), Deledda describes herself as a young and passionate woman with Libyan and Hamitic features. In her artful assertion of otherness, Deledda remains unexcelled as a stylistic master of the literature of exception. If there is one ‘ism’ that serves to mediate between the verist and symbolist strains of Deledda’s work, it is Romanticism, understood in its religious and prophetic dimensions, its medievalist reclaiming of Dante’s Comedy as an allegorical model, and its Christian and providential dimension as well as the element of the sublime, evident especially in the landscape. The actuality of the Christian sacraments throughout the Church year, as practised in a locale separated from Rome not simply by the Tyrrhenian Sea but by radically diverse histories, becomes a touchstone for Deledda in the years after 1910, during which time she returns repeatedly to the mystery of the liturgy as a constitutive part of the human landscape she is committed to exploring, and does so without the stylistic tics and trite psychological portraits of the earlier production. In Dantean terms, the early belief in destiny and fate is transformed into a manifestation of the free will that is free because it is detached from the imprisoning passions. Anna Banti bases her late novel Un grido lacerante (A Piercing Cry, 1981) on the ﬁnal years of her marriage with the celebrated art historian Roberto Longhi. This autobiographical novel is at once a loving testament to her former husband, involving his death and its disquieting aftermath (also from the standpoint of his intellectual ‘estate’), and an autonomous work of ﬁction. To be precise, it is a daring form of historical ﬁction which redeﬁnes the art object in terms of the ‘sacred place’ of\n\nIntroduction 23\n\nthe protagonist herself, who, after the midpoint of the novel, when the Master dies, must confront alone the period of mourning and service to her husband’s memory, including the supervision of his archives. To better comprehend this late work, I turn to the early novel Il bastardo (The Bastard, 1943), a disturbing portrait of a Southern family and their road to Rome, their move away from the latifundia estate of the Baron of Omomorto, after he has created a second family and abandoned his wife to her internal demons. Here the author’s magical realism carries us inside the psychological complexities of its heroines, particularly Cecilia, whose battle to educate herself and gain a place in the masculine world of science and technology has tragic consequences similar to those endured by her mother. By covering a span of thirty years in Banti’s career, our treatment seeks to underline the constancy of Banti’s proliﬁc contribution to the Italian literary tradition, a tradition she digniﬁed by siding with the artist, the mystic, the child, and the martyr. Roman novelist Elsa Morante shares a profound empathy with each of these groups, and further exempliﬁes a revolt founded on the exception to the norm. Morante’s novella ‘Lo scialle andaluso’ (The Andalusian Shawl) provides a parable of a Sicilian woman, artist, and mother, who like Aleramo, Deledda, and Banti, and their characters, moved to Rome. Morante’s dedication in her ﬁction is to the mother and child, the downtrodden and the eccentric. Her political sympathies are with the marginalized and oppressed, including such geniuses as Mozart, Rembrandt, Joan of Arc, Bruno, Rimbaud, Gramsci, and Simone Weil. Morante’s mercurial personality was that of a moody and sometimes reclusive dreamer who identiﬁed with the victims of social injustice. Her sense of alterity gravitated naturally to the fantasy world of the child and the fable, a genre which reveals important truths, though – as the classical deﬁnition has it – the fable recounts events that never happened and never could happen. The fable can be inscribed in the world of a character, as is the case in Morante’s novella, where the child Andrea is seen to live in the world of his imagination, which slowly evolves into a devout religious life until, on the threshold of adolescence, the boy revolts against the mores of the dominant culture. This ﬁctive procedure is undertaken by Morante through a particular form of semiosis or ﬁguration known as iconicity. In the iconic scene the imaginary world of the protagonist is exteriorized and concretized in texts, rituals, tableaux, and other silent representations of his or her inner world. While none of the four authors studied in Part Two had children (Rosselli was never married), for Morante this was one of the great sorrows\n\n24\n\nThe Revolt of the Scribe in Modern Italian Literature\n\nof her life. This lack, which might be called the Yerma problematic, is dramatized in the often tragic parent-child relations represented in her ﬁction. It has been said that Morante’s prose is reminiscent of the nineteenth century, but in a broader sense her romanticism, which sees narrative as the inevitable engendering of myth, suggests the ethos of ancient Greece or the proto-Christian world. Morante is lodged in a ﬁgurative tradition, like that of Tasso; like that great poet, Morante commands the contents of myths and fables in an openly positive and spiritualizing sense, by means of her own aesthetic militancy, which presupposes the necessary interruption of those romantic motifs by the modern world in which the experience of alienation is undeniable. Poet Amelia Rosselli shares the situation of feminine isolation announced by Spaziani, and the heroic response to it by means of her poetic persona. The elusive coherence of Rosselli’s poems is rooted in exorbitant phonetic patterns and ‘highly personal pathways, which follow an intimate melody and the ﬂareups of the psyche.’42 Rosselli’s inner landscape is populated with absent interlocutors; these include presumed lovers and the divinity, as well as her numerous literary sources, such as Campana, Montale, Rimbaud. Given the prevalence of the ‘dialogue in absentia,’ that genre can be considered as a kind of organizing structure to a highly heterogeneous and centrifugal body of work. The terrible impact on the poet of the assassinations of her father and uncle, Carlo and Nello Rosselli, in 1937 constitutes the paradigm of this absence, and is a trauma that remains with her until her suicide in 1996. Trained as a musician, adept in French and English, the young Rosselli quickly understood poetry as the key to her self-realization. The forms of her musical-metrical and performative evolution are experimentalist, but not in the fashion of Italy’s neo-avant-garde. The difference lies in Rosselli’s embrace of process, as opposed to the aesthetics of the aleatory, and her persistent sense throughout her work of a Christian vocation. This is apparent in the forms of supplication, lamentation, and praise that underlie what ﬁrst seems to be a poetry of fragments (albeit one rich in religious symbols). The enigmas of the Rossellian text are best negotiated by readers prepared to enter into her world and experience her language as such, that is, as an expressive whole not reducible to its phonetic, syntactic, and lexical-semantic components. As one comes to imagine a fuller embodiment of that place, that ‘elsewhere’ from which the poem emanates, one also grasps the femininity of Rosselli’s voice in the terms laid out above. Given her dedication to the minimal and chance events of quotidian existence – to the space of contingency, intention, and sense –\n\nIntroduction 25\n\none can even speak of the prosaics of Rosselli’s text. It is on the palette of ordinary language that the singular event of the poem is formed, in the sensory-musical experience of its rhythmic structure and in the ethical self-assertion of the author. Prosaics, as stated by Bakhtin scholars G.S. Morson and C. Emerson, refers to ‘a form of thinking that presumes the importance of the everyday, the ordinary, “the prosaic.”’43 This form is of special importance in the novel, but is by no means restricted to that genre. It was Bakhtin’s conviction that an emphasis on ‘poetics’ in literary criticism privileged poetry and diminished prose. In our use of ‘prosaics’ we mean to share Bakhtin’s view that literary genres possess linguistic and aesthetic features that exist independently of the stylistic imprint of the author. Prosaics allows one to elevate the quotidian, affective, and contingent details within the text; our advocacy of prosaics extends beyond Part Two of this book, insofar as the scribes in Parts One and Three are also committed to the literary text’s self-sufﬁciency and its communicative engagement with the world. As we discuss in section 6 of this Introduction, such an advocacy is based on the conviction that no overarching or universal critical method exists to adequately decode the literary text. 5. Peripheral Novelists and the Problem of Evil In Part Three, I present three novelists from the cultural periphery who focus on the problem of evil. After the Treaty of Versailles (1919), when Italy acquired Trieste and the Alto Adige region, the status of being a new citizen living near a new national boundary took on special importance. The topographical periphery became ‘central’ to the national literature; as the nation realized its military and economic marginality with respect to the rest of Europe, its own margins and heteroglossia acquired an increased symbolic importance. What Gramsci envisioned as the ‘deprovincialization’ of Italian literature would involve a redimensioning of the classics, a reevaluation of the genres of popular literature, and an interweaving of the realities of the province, nation, and continent. In the Fascist period, such a literature could only exist in extreme tension with the state, which exercised oppressive control over the national cultural life. While the powers of the centre considered the periphery as no more than the hinterlands – the site of the exotic, the quaint, the antiquarian, the subaltern – Gramsci understood its heterogeneity as the source of national wealth and sustenance. In addressing literary deprovincialization, therefore, one needed to recognize the biases against it\n\n26\n\nThe Revolt of the Scribe in Modern Italian Literature\n\nand the means by which a hegemonic centre seeks to program its scribes, to enforce an illusory cultural uniformity and suppress the multiformed Other, and to do so on the level of writerly form. For Italo Svevo the standard Italian language retained an artiﬁcial, constructed quality. Accused of writing awkwardly, he made a considerable contribution to the deprovincialization of the national literature. A student of Darwin, of the scientiﬁc works of Binet, Weininger, and Wassermann, of Schopenhauer and Renan, Svevo inscribed himself into the discourse of the self of Italian modernism from the remote vantage point of Trieste, a major port sitting at the crossroads between Europe and the East, between Italy and Mitteleuropa. As Freud’s ﬁrst Italian translator, Svevo represented a culture which was historically the colonizer of Italy and was himself the ﬁgure of the outsider sceptical of cultural-linguistic assimilation. In his ﬁnal work, the short novel Corto viaggio sentimentale (Short Sentimental Journey), one reads of the train voyage from Milan to Trieste of a certain Giacomo Aghios, another of Svevo’s alter egos, like Zeno Cosini in La coscienza di Zeno (Zeno’s Conscience), an aging merchant who confronts a series of speculative problems in what is otherwise an uneventful journey. The densely allusive work is informed by a proliferation of courtly and pseudo-erotic imagery including a rich intertextuality with Laurence Sterne’s Sentimental Journey. I assess the Corto viaggio as an intriguing post-Zeno development with which Svevo – after his period of lying fallow after the success of his great novel – eschewed the self-enclosed, autoironic, and sceptical world views of Zeno Cosini and embarked on a more adventurous and spiritually afﬁrming work. There is perhaps no more ﬁtting successor to Svevo’s literature of irony and ambivalence situated on Italy’s boundary with Mitteleuropa than Guido Morselli. At once a scholar and critic of literary modernism (which had a minor impact in Italy) and a sceptic of its positive impact on the novel, Morselli does not associate Svevo with that movement (of Kafka, Proust, Joyce, etc.) but with an earlier, more nineteenth-century mode. He describes Zeno as ‘a masterpiece of that narrative inspiration which was once called intimism and psychologism,’ and further describes Svevo’s novel as ‘crepuscular.’44 Morselli is emphatic in rejecting the critical notion that Freudianism can provide the interpretive key to Zeno (which he does not consider to be Svevo’s ﬁnest work). Svevo, on the other hand, was also a sceptic and had distanced himself from Freud in ways that Morselli did not fully appreciate. In any case, it is clear that both Svevo and Morselli reject the notion of overarching systems\n\nIntroduction 27\n\n(whether Freudian, Saussurean, Cartesian, Hegelian, or Crocean) that would cancel out the problem of evil. As with the authors of feminine voice, theirs too is a valuing of the sentiments as antidotes against totalizing systems that would explain away chance events or the importance of ethical responses to them. Each of Morselli’s eight novels involves a radical experimentation with the genre. Ignored by the publishing establishment during his life, his novels became a sensation shortly after his suicide in 1973. Philosopher, parodist, scientiﬁc journalist, novelist, and theologian, Morselli lived most of his life in Varese, near the Swiss border. The cross-cultural, often fantastical direction of his novels qualiﬁes him as a powerful dissenter to the status quo. As a philosopher Morselli attempted to balance the Catholic pessimism of Pascal, the scepticism of Montaigne, and the Epicureanism of Lucretius. Realismo e fantasia (Realism and Imagination, 1947) is a series of dialogues presented as an ‘Itinerarium mentis in philosophiam.’ The little-known work invokes the philosophies of Leibniz, Marcel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Bergson, and the poetic perspectives of Poe, Valéry, and Novalis. In these nine dialogues the Socratic ﬁgure of Sereno, who speaks to an I-ﬁgure who transcribes their conversations, denies he has developed a rigorous system. However, in the course of his remarks, Sereno does focus on the philosophical modality of the simploche (or simplex), the ‘I am,’ being the fusion of the human subject and predicate that combine to make self-consciousness. In the simploche (a kind of inverse of the phenomenologists’ epoché), the ‘All’ and the ‘Individual’ combine to form the ‘Logos’; the ‘I’ and ‘Existence’ are uniﬁed in ‘Thought.’ This conjunction of opposites is understood as a ﬁnite opposition, a complementarity. Our discussion of Realismo e fantasia focuses on the simploche as a psychological and ethical construction present in Morselli’s ﬁrst-published novel, Un dramma borghese (A Bourgeois Drama, 1961). The book is the sordid account of a father’s relationship with his eighteen-year-old daughter, whom he barely knows. This study in a pathological relationship is centred on the father’s inability to properly mourn his dead wife, or to share that process with his daughter, whose emotional confusion escalates over the course of the claustrophobic novel (most of the ‘action’ occurs in two adjoining hotel rooms) into desperation. How such a story is told is the novelty of Morselli’s scribal experimentation. One has a dense weave of imbricated temporalities: memories of self, self-projections of a weakened ego, fantasies and escapist ﬂights to another time and place. The book is overdetermined in this sense: the I-narrator – whose name is not given – attaches deeper mean-\n\n28\n\nThe Revolt of the Scribe in Modern Italian Literature\n\nings to objects and relations than those objects and relations justify. His associative and rationalistic mind is awash in surrogates, substitutes, and fetishes; he possesses – in Freudian terms – an intensely egoistic personality. In this way, the I-ﬁgure in Un dramma borghese is ironically similar to that of Zeno: an unreliable narrator with intimistic orientations. Novelist Vasco Pratolini emerges from the working-class centre of 1930s Florence. As an artisan typographer already at work at age fourteen, Pratolini represents ‘the periphery of the centre.’ His familiarity with Dante began in his childhood as he read the carved stone plaques of citations from the Commedia scattered about the centro storico. His novel Il quartiere (Tale of Santa Croce) is studied here in terms of its intertextuality with Dante’s Purgatorio. Pratolini, the Tuscan populist and onetime member of the Fascist left, was a student of Florentine history accustomed to drawing parallels between the violent conﬂicts of the Middle Ages and those of the present day. The ﬁgural use of Dante is apparent throughout Il quartiere, such that the reality of the quarter of Santa Croce seems to recapitulate in its moral geography and temporal progressions the mountain of Purgatory. In the structural interweaving of episodes the plot achieves great economy, mixing minor episodes with the challenges faced by Valerio and his associates. The continuous ascent of Il quartiere includes some surprise descents, delusions, and losses; the moral and physical challenges confronted emerge naturally from the interpersonal contexts and relations as the protagonists’ lives are situated within the larger political reality. The actions of the Fascist regime are perceived imperfectly by the characters, whose hopes and needs tend to colour their fragmentary understanding of world events. Ultimately one is left with a moral drama driven by the centrality of free will and the positive spiritual development of the characters in search of a harmonious polity. Pratolini’s intertextual borrowings from Dante are not without deviations from the medieval poet.45 While he has assimilated Dante’s vocabulary, his ﬁgural representations and view of Florentine history, Pratolini does not presuppose Dante’s metaphysics or understanding of Christian doctrine and dogma. 6. A Note on Method In the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, the most important critical thinker in Italy was Benedetto Croce. Croce’s aesthetics centred on the intuition, as in his juxtaposition of the ‘poetry’ of Divine Comedy to its ‘non-poetry,’ a putative separation of Dante’s poem into moments of\n\nIntroduction 29\n\nlyric brilliance and the supporting architecture. For Croce the literary product was successful if form served content; his preference was for a stable, balanced, and harmonious text. One could argue that Croce’s mental constructs adversely conditioned his views of mannerist, Romantic, and decadent poetry. Certainly his negative commentaries on such authors as Tasso, Leopardi, Pascoli, and Deledda demonstrate more than a lacuna in his method. The two great novelists contemporary to Croce – Svevo and Pirandello – were exempt of any inﬂuence from him. Croce’s idealist historicism is dismissive of the materialistic elements of literature, from questions of social class to the categories of rhetoric and genre. While his method was vastly inﬂuential during the ﬁrst half of the century, it was inevitable that other critical methods would arise to respond to the changing ethos: among these many methods (ranging from the psychoanalytical to the semiotic, from Marxism to formalism), the one of greatest interest to us is stylistic criticism, owing to its combination of rigorously philological, text-based study, humanistic ﬂexibility, and tolerance of eclecticism.46 I would include under this rubric the eclectic critic Giacomo Debenedetti, who, like many of his peers, owed much to Croce. Debenedetti identiﬁed a root problem in Croce’s subjugation of literature to philosophy and to morality, locating in the Neapolitan critic ‘the seal of a deeply felt and gentlemanly evasion, of a reserve that has disgust for the inﬂated motions of the affections.’47 Debenedetti offered an intuitive and text-based criticism that probed into the work for the clues it could provide on ‘how to read’ it. This was a sign of respect to such modern authors as Baudelaire or Proust or Saba whose radical novelty with respect to their predecessors had all but eluded Croce. If one is to reassess the Italian literature of the last two centuries, one must examine the history of the criticism and of the political climate as well other socio-historical parameters such as the changing demographics of the readership and the involvement of Italian authors with other national literatures. Moreover one must conﬁrm the importance of style in literary interpretation. It is in this spirit that the works examined here are considered both extensively, as messages about the world and the self, and intensively, as the encoded and self-similar instructions for use of those messages. Such an operational duality is fundamental to communication theory, which holds that lexical and logical codes have limited and interpenetrating ﬁelds of mutual relevance and signiﬁcance.48 It is also a central tenet to the brand of stylistic criticism described earlier in this Introduction. Such a stylistics, informed by a theory of symbol,\n\n30\n\nThe Revolt of the Scribe in Modern Italian Literature\n\nlooks within the text for the cues to the text’s interpretation. Because of its non-allegiance to historicist, formalist, or ideological criticism, stylistics remains ﬂexible and able to support a view of the literary discourse in which objective and subjective modes are interpenetrating. Because of its neutrality, it is able to reveal the biases of a certain intellectual class and to suggest that a more rigorous study of those works of modernity that have been overlooked or swept aside might offer a means out of the immobility of postmodernity. As Raymond Williams suggests, ‘an alternative tradition’ of modernity might ‘address itself [...] to a modern future in which community may be imagined again.’49 In order to clarify our notion of stylistics and relate it to concrete historical modes of social communication, we cite an essay by Giovanni Nencioni in which the linguist argues that style has been overly identiﬁed with linguistic difference (scarto), a practice that has distanced the code of literary ‘style’ from that of ordinary language. This has led to an extreme formalism weakened by its loss of contact with semantic context. Such a trend has positioned the poetic message opposite the pragmatic message, and thus ignored poetry’s communicative thrust. In addition, the loss of touch with day-to-day language and linguistics has resulted in a polemical counterreaction on the part of the defenders of ‘content.’ Nencioni ﬁnds fault with his fellow linguists for having ignored the importance of the theory of communication in their own discipline. In assessing the phenomenology of poetic form, Nencioni suggests that literary genres emerge from linguistic genres or ‘paradigmatic syntactic structures’ present in all languages. These are frequently archaic, being rooted in age-old anthropological practices. One such genre or mode is the ‘dialogue in absentia,’ as one ﬁnds in Leopardi’s ‘A Silvia’ or in Petrarch’s poems addressed directly to the dead Laura. Such a dialogue ‘is not a constitutive act of a social relation’ as one might ﬁnd in a letter (where the addressee’s point of view and possible response are assumed by the terms of the message), since the rules of ordinary language-use do not permit one to address an absent party. One does ﬁnd exceptions to this exclusion in daily life, such as the lamentations or addresses to the dead, or the public and private practice of prayer. One also ﬁnds them in literature, as in ‘the appeal to the divinity,’ or the invocation of the Muses in epic poetry. What interests us in Nencioni’s ‘anthropological poetics’ is its ability to reconnect contemporary literature to ‘remote forms of social communication.’50 This is essential for the literature of revolt, since its approach to the experience of alienation presupposes an emergence from actual social forms. The promise of such a poetics is the\n\nIntroduction 31\n\nrevelation of more complex modes of communication that are impervious to a merely formalistic analysis, on the one hand, and to a purely thematic analysis on the other. Within the broadly deﬁned ﬁeld of stylistic criticism we are proposing, we would include the ﬁeld of cultural studies represented by Raymond Williams, as well as the anthropologically informed approach of cultural materialism. I refer in this regard to the distinction between etics and emics used by ethnographers. Originally derived from the distinction between phonetics and phonemics, these terms concern the source and nature of scientiﬁc descriptions and analyses. Etics relies on assessment and measurement by means of external observers; emics relies on the experience of native informants.51 Etics deals largely with behaviour, while emics deals mostly with thought or mind; the etic versus emic distinction is useful to the literary critic because it requires that one consider the external features of a text and the world it evokes prior to any discussion of its subjectivity or deeper signiﬁcance.52 By ﬁrst having the experience of an external observer, one is better prepared to discuss the internally sensed cultural meanings and values. If one skips over the etic mode, one risks losing contact with the referent. As Marvin Harris asserts, ‘To insist on the priority of mind in culture is to align one’s understanding of socio-cultural phenomena with the anthropological equivalent of pre-Darwinian biology or pre-Newtonian physics,’ or ‘intellectual infantilism’; in contrast, the diverse meanings that emerge from speech acts are decisive: ‘The difference between etic meanings and emic meanings of speech acts is the difference between the conventional or “code” meaning of a human utterance and its deeper psychological signiﬁcance for speaker and hearer respectively.’53 In the ﬁeld of literature the comparable error is to ignore the physical and empirical data of experience and stress a metaphysical or mental concept of a work’s meaning. To apply the etic/emic distinction to literature does not mean to separate speaker from hearer, author from reader; it does mean to distinguish between the etic code on the one hand and the emic meaning of the utterance on the other. The meaning requires, or is caused by, the code, but the code is not required or caused by the meaning. Historicist and idealist schools of scholarship have tended to minimize the etic for the sake of the emic; structuralist, poststructuralist, and formalist schools have tended to do the opposite. The emic/etic distinction is important if one is to avoid the intentional fallacy – the assumption that one can know the author’s intent – and avoid the confusion of authors with ﬁrst-person narrators and\n\n32\n\nThe Revolt of the Scribe in Modern Italian Literature\n\ncharacters. Since this study is concerned with the ﬁgure of the author, it maintains the strict separation between author and narrator, even in autobiographical works. To focus on the author is to minimize the purely synchronic and semiological criticism that isolates the work as an autonomous mechanism (a variation of which is the reader-centred criticism of ‘reception’). By setting etics before emics, one also addresses writing as a technology, a code of accepted conventions, and a sanctioned means of cultural transmission.54 Within these parameters one can ask: What are the linguistic, geographical, socio-political, bio-bibliographical contexts that delimit the author and text? What speciﬁc horizons of expectations are in force? What technical constraints are observable? What standards of taste? Are such contexts, constraints, and standards peculiar to this author, or do they display similarities to other authors, such that one might speak of imitation, cultural transmission, and continuity of tradition? The responses to these etic questions suggest emic points of interest and further questions. The transition from a behavioural or technical discussion to one of sentiments and ideas is subtle and nuanced. As one explores the question of mutatio vitae and of a turn that represents a vertical integration between the conscience of the author and the empiria of the world, one forms hypotheses about the larger meaning of the work, broader questions about its context and culture. We might sum up the importance of cultural materialism to the stylistic critic as follows: while the text is rooted in material process, it exceeds the boundaries of materialism. Thus the historical realities present in ﬁctional and poetic works are mindful of the ‘places of memory’ of actual history, but they preserve their transcendent autonomy as well. George Steiner has argued in this sense for the value-inherent, ethically and socially contexted nature of any work of art, in opposition to the nihilism and anti-historicism of our current ‘age of theory.’55 Steiner writes that the modern period begins with neoclassicism, a period of afﬁnity ‘between the poetic and the programmatic-critical articulations.’56 In Italy this is followed by the Romantic period and the age of professionalism, which brings an increased gravitas to the intellectual disciplines and a continued tendency to form literary Arcadias or other escapist endeavours that separate the literary enterprise from the social and civil life of the nation. The Italian scribe in revolt turns against such idyllic representations and rejects attempts to ofﬁcialize literature or critical theory. The fate of the scribe is seen generally to endure an initial position of apprenticeship and obligation to the rigours of a trade, to\n\nIntroduction 33\n\nthe acquisition of knowledge and construction of one’s life in the world. Inevitably there is a dissatisfaction that emerges regarding one’s relation to the institutions of literature and the arts. The presence of ‘scripts’ or sanctioned narratives and modalities of expression – including the literal technologies of writing and publishing – is modiﬁed as part of the author’s pursuit of the truth, especially when that pursuit requires a rejection of the former knowledge. The scripts of literary convention and those of everyday life are the raw material for the scribe’s venturing forward into the actuality of history. Amidst the ruins of Italy’s classical past and the contradictions of its social structure, and the static nobility of its literary language, the scribe shapes new hypotheses, animates new characters, forms hybrids and novel fusions of archaic linguistic and literary genres, all in response to the dissatisfaction. By transcribing the ‘master’ texts of the past – even if only in memory – the scribe ﬁnds a way to break the mould, to overcome the experience of anguish and trauma, and to assume the mantle of authorship.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nPART ONE The Legacy of the Poeta Vate\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1 Justice, Modesty, and Compassion in Ugo Foscolo’s Ajace\n\nVate era sommo, ed avea cinto l’armi, E alteri come il brando eran suoi carmi. – Silvio Pellico1\n\nWhitehead’s discussion of ‘Understanding’ in Modes of Thought identiﬁes the nineteenth century as the period of ﬁnal resolution of Renaissance ideas, and consequently of Greek thought, a gathered ediﬁce whose aesthetic limitations are too seldom remembered or applied critically to its historical recurrences.2 If human understanding is to be expanded in the modern period, says Whitehead, the multiple as well the unitary, the confused and manifold as well as the singular and orderly, must be included in our intellectual and aesthetic models. ‘In the history of European thought,’ he adds, ‘the discussion of aesthetics has been almost ruined by the emphasis upon the harmony of the details.’3 In Italy the transition out of neoclassicism into the Romantic period is multiple and confused in this way, a fact complicated by Italy’s perennial classicism and identity as the cradle of the Renaissance. All too rarely have scholars given sufﬁcient weight to the radically eristic nature of the Romantic revolt; literary works whose details are not harmonious are simply deemed unworthy. A case in point is the historical reception of Ugo Foscolo. Born in Zante, Greece, of a Greek mother and Venetian father, Foscolo ﬁrst studied the Greek classics. When he arrived on Italian shores it was with a great literary and patriotic passion, and a great proclivity for involving his personal aspirations in his literary endeavours. The tragedy I have chosen to study, Ajace, comes at a point in Foscolo’s career when he has overcome his self-centredness and left behind the contradictory self-\n\n38\n\nThe Legacy of the Poeta Vate\n\nprojections of his twenties. In the real world of power, saturated by the animal instincts of man, Foscolo has come to realize that rebellion, no matter how righteous, is futile and self-defeating. This is the crux that presents itself in this difﬁcult work, which steps beyond the harmony of the details and delivers in its formal synthesis a prophetic vision of modernity. The poor reception of Ajace, as Walter Binni has demonstrated, should not prevent us from considering it as a masterwork essential to any genuine understanding of Foscolo.4 Before approaching the Ajace, I will look brieﬂy at two earlier texts: ‘A Venezia’ (1796), and the celebrated ode, Dei Sepolcri (1806). As the ﬁrst historian of the Italian sonnet, Foscolo was always sensitive, even in his earliest attempts, to the fragile thematic and musical equilibrium of the genre. ‘A Venezia’ marks a step forward in his quick mastery of the genre and is well known among later Italian patriots and activists. The poem is based, in essence, on a series of contrasts: between reality and myth; between the Venetian Republic’s cowardly neutrality and the aura of its illustrious past; between the sorry state of a colonial Italy and the great future of the nation foreseen by Foscolo in his (for now) Vichian conception. A Venezia O di mille tiranni, a cui rapina riga il soglio di sangue, imbelle terra! ’ve mentre civil fama ulula ed erra, siede negra Politica reina; dimmi: mai ti val se a te vicina compra e vil pace dorme, e se ignea guerra a te non mai le molli trecce afferra onde crollarti in nobile ruina? Già striscia il popol tuo scarno e fremente, e strappa bestemmiando ad altri i panni, mentre gli strappa i suoi man più potente. Ma verrà il giorno, e gallico lo affretta sublime esempio, ch’ei de’ suoi tiranni farà col loro scettro alta vendetta.5 To Venice Oh peace-throttled land, Throne coated\n\nUgo Foscolo’s Ajace\n\n39\n\nwith blood by a thousand tyrants! your civic name roves about and cries out as evil Politics reigns on high; tell me: what could it concern you if cowardly peace shops and sleeps nearby, if ﬁery war never grips your soft tresses to cause you to crumble into noble ruin? Your gaunt and trembling people are now crawling, cursing as they tear off others’ clothing, while a stronger hand rips off theirs in turn. But the day will come, and Gaul hastens it, sublime example, when she will gain high revenge upon her tyrants, and by their own sword.\n\nWritten six years before the Treaty of Campoformio that would mark Foscolo’s ﬁnal rupture with ‘Gaul,’ the sonnet expresses the poet’s antityrannical fervour and disappointment over the declaration of neutrality by the Venetian oligarchy toward Austria and France. The eighteen-yearold’s political ambitions are apparent, as he states his concern over the political change that is imminent (on 12 May 1797, the end of the Venetian Republic would be declared). ‘Oligarchy,’ he writes, has multiplied tyranny as many times as there are patricians. Though the power of the Doge’s throne is great, as the forces in surrounding lands were tamed and rendered ‘unwarlike,’ so too did the Republic grow cowardly and impotent. Whatever peace the throne contrives with its corrupt Politics is unsatisfactory, for its denies Venice’s true destiny and greatness. This thesis is argued in the second quatrain by means of the metaphor of the Republic as a woman who fails to recognize the growing disparity between myth and reality, nobility and realpolitik. The ﬁrst tercet depicts the reality of tyranny: poverty, rebellion, and the contradictory behaviour of the Venetians, whose livelihood is stripped by their government while they strip others of their property. The concluding tercet, in praise of France, predicts the rehabilitation of the people and the overthrow of the tyrants, whose own swords shall be turned against them. To better understand the unresolved dichotomy of this poem, its exaggerated manner and desire for a concise concept of justice amidst political tumult, one is led to Dei’ Sepolcri, written on the occasion of the edict of Saint-Cloud by which Napoleon restricted burial practices within the Italian colony. After listing the proper uses of monuments – to exalt the poet, the scientist, the painter – Foscolo names the heroic ﬁgure of Ajax\n\n40\n\nThe Legacy of the Poeta Vate\n\nas one whose glory merits a great tomb. Thus the shield of Achilles shall be stolen away from Ulysses’ ship and delivered to the bones of Ajax: alle prode Retee l’armi di Achille sovra l’ossa d’Aiace: a’ generosi giusta di gloria dispensiera è morte; nè senno astuto, nè favor di regi all’Itaco le spoglie ardue serbava, ché alla poppa raminga le ritolse l’onda incitata dagl’inferni Dei. (ll. 219–25)6 ... returning the Shield of Achilles to the Retean shores, over the bones of Ajax: death is the just rewarder of glory to the generous. Nor were cleverness of mind, or royal inﬂuence, of any use to Ulysses, since the infernal Gods stirred the stormy seas to seize off his deck the hard-won Shield.\n\nIt is this same archetype of heroic virtue and justice that Foscolo will turn to when commissioned in 1809 (largely owing to the acclaim of Dei Sepolcri) to write a tragedy.7 On 24 March 1809, Foscolo is nominated as Professor of Italian and Latin Eloquence at the University of Pavia, only to see the position eliminated by Napoleonic decree eight months later. (It was the practice of the regime to hire scientists and bureaucrats, and to ﬁre humanists.) It is in this context of reaction, uncertainty, and strife that he drafts the story of Ajace – working with numerous classical sources – and, beginning on 2 February 1811, sets it into verse.8 One senses in the chronology that a long meditation on content is followed by a swift execution, as if to guarantee both poetic resonance and moral and logical coherence. In fact, the ﬁve acts and 1904 versi sciolti constitute a compelling, politically pointed, and emotionally vibrant play which ﬁnds Foscolo at the peak of his intellectual and artistic power.9 When the Ajace was staged on 9 and 10 December 1811, at La Scala in Milan, the reception was at best mixed. Certainly the presence of Foscolo’s enemies in Milan contributed to his play’s being censored so that it could not be performed as scheduled in Venice (where antiNapoleonic sentiment ran high).10 After the play’s cancellation Foscolo was subjected to police surveillance. Critics saw the play as a political allegory in which the characters of Ajax, Ulysses, and Agamemnon were proxies for the principals in the French army: General Moreau, Fouché, and Napoleon. Yet, as Binni argues, while the Napoleonic aggressions of 1811 are surely on Foscolo’s mind, the drawing of such an interpreta-\n\nUgo Foscolo’s Ajace\n\n41\n\ntion is inaccurate and ignores the generality and aesthetic autonomy by which the Ajace gains its intellectual and spiritual coherence. Foscolo’s is a reinvestment in a historical genre and in a classical Greek patrimony that he, perhaps uniquely in the Italy of his day, knew intimately. Given that his earliest education was in the Greek classics, his mediation of the various classical sources for the Ajax myth involved a sort of return in memory, or anamnesis, to his origins. Of the primary sources of the Ajax myth – Homer, Virgil, Sophocles, Pindar, Ovid – Foscolo cites the ﬁrst three as models, each of which contributes to the potential plasticity in his development of the characters. The play opens as Agamemnon announces to his men that the end of the truce between Greeks and Trojans is imminent. He hears from Ulysses that the masses of Greek people (‘la turba,’ ‘il volgo lungo il lito del mar trascorre a torme’ [the throng, the people are running along the shoreline in droves]) are crazed and terriﬁed over the death of Achilles, a hero who had lived for altar and oracles (‘l’are e gli oracoli’) and not simply for his own people, the Myrmidons. When Ulysses accuses Ajax (also of the Myrmidons) of excessive pride, Agamemnon rebuts that he is an excellent soldier who did not join Achilles in rebellion, and who keeps in check the rival Greek kings (‘emuli prenci’) as well as the Trojan enemy: ‘a sé dannoso, utile a noi’ (harmful to himself, useful to us). Ulysses responds that at the assembly of the Greek kings Ajax had split with Agamemnon, stirring up the people in the name of the ‘patria.’ The emperor is taken in by the deception and vows, ‘il tempo / Ed io ben presto avvezzerem gli Achei / All’ossequio e al silenzio’ (I, 106–7) (time and I shall quickly accustom the Achaeans to respect and silence). Ulysses then raises the issue that Ajax’s wife, Tecmessa, was a Frygian (Trojan) slave and that his half-brother, Teucro, had a Trojan mother. Now Teucro appears and reports that Ajax and the Myrmidons have singlehandedly defeated the Trojan attackers; that Tecmessa, mourning the loss of her father to the war, has convinced the remaining combatants to surrender; that Calcante has declared Troy will fall; and that the gathered masses have demanded that the arms of Achilles be awarded to Ajax.
