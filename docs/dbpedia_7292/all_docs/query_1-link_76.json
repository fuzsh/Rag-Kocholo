They indicated, in brief, that the plague causing bacteria Yersinia pestis1 infected humans in Bronze Age Eurasia, three millennia earlier than any historical records of plague, but only acquired the genetic changes making it a highly virulent, flee-borne bubonic strain 3,000 years ago. The highlights of the document read as follows:\n\nIt may be helpful, at this time, to cast a glance at some facts that could shed light on the topic that the present study will develop, that is, the times, the ways and the characteristics assumed by the description of the plague and other related topics in some works of Italian literature through a considerably long period of time ending with the major work of Alessandro Manzoni, I promessi sposi (The Betrothed). ← xi | xii →\n\nThe plague causing bacteria, Yersinia pestis, as one can imagine, has a long history. In 1894, however, the Swiss doctor Alexandre John-Emile Yersin, during the Hong Kong epidemic, isolated the bacillus that had caused so many deaths through the ages in various parts of the world, and called it Pasteurella pestis to honor Louis Pasteur, the person who had initiated the study of infections in the modern sense. In the same year also the Japanese doctor Shibasaburo Kitasato, who had isolated the tetanus bacillus in 1889, obtained the same result as the Swiss doctor, but history remembers Yersin, also because the plague bacillus, rather than being called Pasteurella, was soon called Yersinia pestis as it is known today.\n\nNumerous sources of information concerning this subject are publicly available now and they indicate, among several other details, that there are two main forms of plague whose difference may be determined by analyzing the infected parts.\n\nIn the case of the bubonic2 plague, human infection may occur through the bite of rats’ fleas, or the bites of the rats as well as other rodents. The type of fleas that may affect humans, as well as lice, less commonly, however, are conducive to transmission of the infection among humans.\n\nThe disease emerges violently, after a period of incubation of two to twelve days. It causes high fever, severe headache, general weakness, nausea, sensitivity to light, sleep difficulties, vomit and delirium. Pustules, appear in the areas of the skin bitten by the insect, and the lymph nodes, especially in the area of the groins and armpits, become inflamed and swollen. (These are the bubboni, singular bubbone mentioned in some works of the Italian literature that are considered in this study.)\n\nIn the most serious cases, the infection attacks the entire system, causing necrosis (localized death of living tissue) of the fingers and toes, as well as kidney complications and internal hemorrhages. These symptoms may precede death, otherwise, in the less serious cases, the fever disappears after about two weeks and the bubboni release pus and eventually disappear leaving a scar.\n\nThe pulmonary3 plague, a much more serious kind of disease, attacks the lungs and may even be a complication from the bubonic type. It shows a considerable lowering of the body temperature, breathing difficulties, cough, a bluish coloring (circulatory and breathing difficulties) and extreme weakness. It may lead to death because of acute pulmonary edema. Particularly notable in this type of disease is the occurrence of serious neurological disorders.\n\nThe pulmonary plague is transmissible even without the action of the fleas, namely by air by way of the coughing and sneezing of infectious individuals that may easily infect other persons.\n\nAs we shall see further on, the people who lived in the past centuries had to struggle against this disease without really knowing what it was, what caused it, and which remedies could be used in order to control the seemingly unstoppable progress of the epidemic that caused such an enormous number of victims. ← xii | xiii →\n\nAs if an almost complete ignorance of the nature of the disease were not a sufficient drawback, other aspects and consequences of it occupied the minds of political and religious leaders and educated persons as well. Ignorance, superstition and fear played a large role in the suffering of the affected populations and contributed to the worsening of an already critical time. On the other hand, the epidemic brought out in some the best and noblest qualities known to mankind, as the documents that will be considered in this study will prove.\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nCipolla, C.

He was born probably about 460 B.C. and died about the year 400 b.c. Perhaps he participated in some events of the war. He contracted the plague but recovered. The plague epidemic is referred to as the Plague of Athens because it developed primarily in that city, but not only there, in the years 429–426 b.c. In Book II the historian wrote,\n\nThey had not been many days in Attica before the plague first broke out among the Athenians. At the beginning the doctors were quite incapable of treating the disease because of their ignorance … In the following summer the Peloponnesians and their allies … invaded Attica, again under the command of the Spartan king Anchidamus. … Taking up their positions, they set about the devastation of the country.\n\nThe author gives the later statement a primary importance because he was able to see what consequences followed the state of surprise even of those who should have manifested a sense of control of the situation. In addition, it should be remembered, that several later writers indicated repeatedly that pestilence often followed the devastation of the land that, in turn caused shortness or total disappearance of the necessary provisions and the ensuing famines, with population displacement and lack of crops. “They had not been many days in Attica before the plague first broke out among the Athenians.”1 ← xv | xvi →\n\nPreviously attacks of the plague had been reported from several other places in the vicinity of Lemnos and other localities, “but there was no agreement about the disease being so virulent anywhere else or causing so many deaths as it did in Athens.” The writer, at this point, makes a remark on the action of the doctors who, in his opinion, were “quite incapable of treating the disease because of their ignorance in the treating methods.” But at that time in history, no effective method to cure the disease had yet been found and even the “mortality among the doctors was the highest of all, since they came more frequently in contact with the sick.”\n\nThus, being all human intervention useless in a rather confused and disoriented situation, the minds of the people addressed themselves to the divine. But the author says: “Equally useless were prayers made in the temples, consultation of oracles and so forth, indeed in the end people were so overcome by their sufferings that they paid no further attention to such things.” One witnesses this form of disenchantment, skepticism and sense of distress in other, later epidemics, among different people and different countries.\n\nProbably hypothesizing on popular beliefs, the narrator indicates the plague originated in Ethiopia, in Upper Egypt and spread from there into the rest of Egypt, Libya and much of the territory of Persia. In the city of Athens it appeared all of a sudden and the early cases were among the population of Piraeus, where there were no wells at that time so that it was supposed by the citizens that the Peloponnesians had poisoned the main reservoirs. Later, however, it appeared also in the upper city, and by this time the mortality rate was greatly increasing in size.\n\nShould the information about Ethiopia, upper Egypt as well as Libya be correct, one might suspect that the infection could have been brought to Piraeus, the port of Athens, by rats infesting the numerous ships that crossed the Mediterranean Sea from northern Africa to Greece.\n\nThis description brings to mind the episode of the pigs in Giovanni Boccaccio’s Decameron.\n\nThese, then were the general features of the disease, though I have omitted all kinds of peculiarities which occurred in various individual cases … Some died in neglect, some in spite of every possible care being taken of them. As for a recognized method of treatment it would be true to say that no such thing existed: what did good in some cases did harm in others.\n\nAs for the psychological conditions of the citizens affected by the epidemic, the description focuses on the despair into which people fell when they realized they had caught the plague:\n\nFor they would immediately adopt an attitude of utter hopelessness, and, by giving in this way, would lose their power of resistance. Terrible too was the sight of people dying like sheep through having caught the disease as a result of nursing others. This indeed caused more deaths than anything else. For when people were afraid to visit the sick, then they died without anyone to look after them; indeed, there were many houses in which all the inhabitants perished through lack of any attention. When, on the other hand, they did visit the sick, they lost their own lives and this was particularly true of those who made it a point of honor to act properly.\n\nThose who had had the plague were the persons who could understand and console the sick and their despair. They knew what the victims were going through ← xvii | xviii → and, at the same time, were aware of being immune and of running no risk since a second infection never ended in death.\n\nDespair and neglect brought about also a desire to cast off social restraints because people, not knowing what would happen to them next, became indifferent to every rule of religion or law. The city of Athens, as a consequence, saw the beginning of a state of unprecedented lawlessness: people indulged in inappropriate acts, spent money immoderately, forgot any restraint.\n\nWhat was actually happening seemed to fit in well with the words of this oracle; certainly the plague broke out directly after the Peloponnesian invasion, and never affected the Peloponnese at all; or not seriously; its full force was felt at Athens, and, after Athens, in the most densely populated of the other towns.\n\nIn A History of Greece to the Death of Alexander the Great, by B. Bury and Russell L. Meiggs, we read that\n\nthe same historian who has given of this pestilence a vivid description unequalled by the narrators of similar scourges, Procopius, Boccaccio, Defoe declares that the plague originated in Ethiopia, spread through Egypt over the Persian empire, and then reached the Aegean. But it is remarkable that a plague raged at the same time in the still obscure city of central Italy which was afterwards to become the mistress of Greece. It has been pressed with some plausibility that the infection that reached both Athens and Rome had travelled along the trade route from Carthage. The Peloponnese almost entirely escaped. In Athens the havoc of the pestilence permanently reduced the population. The total number of Athenian citizens (of both sexes and ages) was about 140,000 in the first quarter of the fifth century. Prosperity had raised it to 172,000 by the beginning of the war, but the plague brought it down below the old level which it never reached again.\n\nNote\n\nBibliography\n\nBury, J. B., Meiggs, R. L.

Born in Caesarea, Procopius studied rhetoric, philosophy and law at Gaza. Later he went to Constantinople (Byzantium). In 527, when general Belisarius became the commander of the troops in Dara against the Persians, Procopius became the adviser of the renowned general. In that capacity he took part in the Iberic campaign, 526–532 against the Visigoths and in 533–534 against the Vandals. Procopius was again with Belisarius during the latter’s campaign against the Goths, 535–540. Returning to Constantinople with the general he was an eyewitness of the plague epidemic that struck the capital in a.d. 542.\n\nIn 551 he wrote History of the Wars, in seven books where he dealt with the wars that he witnessed. Upon the Emperor’s request, he wrote also On the Edifices, a glorification of the Emperor’s monumental public works. He wrote also a Secret History, a rather critical document on Emperor Justinian and Theodora that became known several centuries after the author’s death.\n\nIn Book II, xxii of the History of the Wars, the author begins the description of the epidemic indicating the power of the disease and the enormous number of victims, “a pestilence … by which the whole human race came near to being annihilated.” This remark is followed by a rather sharp criticism about the official statements emanating from the authorities: ← xxi | xxii →\n\nNow in the cases of all other scourges sent from heaven some explanation of a cause might be given by daring men, such as the many theories propounded by those who are clever in these matters: for they love to conjure up causes which are absolutely incomprehensible to men and to fabricate outlandish theories of natural philosophy, knowing well that they are saying nothing sound, but considering it sufficient for them, if they completely deceive by their argument some of those whom they meet and persuade them to their view.\n\nHowever, for this particular epidemic, the author remarks that “it is quite impossible either to express in words or to conceive in thought any explanation, except indeed to refer it to God.” The reasons for the peculiarity of this case were multiple and the historian declares them point by point.\n\nIt did not come in a part of the world nor upon certain men, nor did it confine itself to any season of the year, but it did embrace the entire world and blighted the lives of all men, nor did it confine itself to any season of the year, but it did embrace the entire world and slighted the lives of all men though differing from one another in the most marked degree respecting neither sex nor age.\n\nUsually differences in age, social standing, attitude and character were determining factors in several occurrences, but in this case “the differences availed naught. Now let each one express his own judgement … both sophist and astrologer, but as for me, I shall proceed to tell where this disease originated and the manner in which it destroyed men.” The places that the epidemic affected were Egypt, Palestine, and from there “it spread over the whole world, always moving forward and travelling at times favorable to it.” It invested places here and there “fearing lest some corner of the earth might escape it.” “It affected men in different fashions, came and went as it pleased, it disappeared and then returned in every possible location and manner sparing no one.” Eventually it reached Byzantium “in the middle of spring” where it happened that\n\nOther persons\n\nsaw a vision in a dream and seemed to suffer the very same thing at the hand of the creature who stood over them or else to hear a voice foretelling to them that they were written down in the number of those who were to die."
