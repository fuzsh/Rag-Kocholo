It started with the arrival at the Istituto Lombardo Accademia di Scienze e Lettere (where from today I have the immense honor of being a member)üìö Welcomed by the President Prof. Stefano Maiorana (Professor Emeritus of the State University of Milan) and the Chancellor Archivist Dr. Rita Pezzola, we began the day of studies in the renovated and prestigious Head Room with Prof. Gianmarco Gaspari (Full Professor of Italian Literature at the University of Insubria) with a lesson entitled \"The idea of the novel\" tracing a clear picture of Manzoni's literary production and everything that contributed to maintaining fertile ground for the composition of ‚ÄúThe Betrothed‚Äù‚úçÔ∏è There were numerous interventions with Prof. Pierantonio Frare (Founder and Director of the \"International summer school in Manzonian studies\", Professor of Italian Literature and Director of the Department of Italian Studies and Comparative Studies) and of great interest was the lesson of the Chancellor Archivist Dott. .ssa Rita Pezzola on the archival tradition on Manzoni of the Lombard Instituteüìú The afternoon of studies was opened by Prof. Francesco De Cristofaro (Professor of Comparative Literature at the Federico II University of Naples) with a brilliant lesson on the \"theatre of the plague\" and the role it played for Manzoni, opening the window in comparison with international and world literature up to the present day. At the end of this magnificent day, the visit to Casa Manzoni (home of the National Center for Manzoni Studies) where we were able to admire Manzoni's Milanese home, correspondence, manuscripts and objects from his daily lifeüè°üìö\n\nüìç Second day of the Summer School in Manzonian Studies - 07/16/2024 Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore National Center for Manzonian Studies Yesterday the second day of the Summer School in Manzonian Studies ended, opened in the Carducci headquarters of the Catholic University by Prof. Giulia Raboni (Professor of Italian Philology at the University of Parma and daughter of the famous poet and literary critic Giovanni Raboni) with a lesson entitled ‚ÄúBetween particular and universal. Linguistic democracy and historical realism in ¬´The Betrothed¬ª‚Äù Following the in-depth and accurate lesson of Prof. Aur√©lie Gendrat-Claudel (Professor of Italian Language and Literature at the University of Nantes) on ‚ÄúManzoni in French, Manzoni in France: non-parallel stories‚Äù (reviewing the various critical editions and translation of the Betrothed into French, from Baudry's pirate version of 1827 to those of Fauriel, Tragnon, Rey Dussuel, Gosselin, O' Mahony, De Montgrand, Martinelli, Rouillard, Yves Branca, De Latout, up to the American one by Moore). Prof. Silvia Contarini (Italianist and Professor of Italian Literature at the University of Udine) opened the afternoon studies with a precious lesson on ‚ÄúLa Geltrude del Fermo: from history to novel‚Äù. At the end of the day, the masterly linguistic and literary lesson by Prof. Pierantonio Frare (Founder and Director of the \"International summer school in Manzonian studies\", Professor of Italian Literature and Director of the Department of Italian Studies and Comparative Studies) entitled \"But how to respond differently?\". Responsibility in the Betrothed and in the History of the Infame Columnüìö\n\nüìç First day of the International Summer School in Manzonian Studies - 15/07/2024 15-18 July 2024 Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore National Center for Manzonian Studies Day of very high culture, opened by Prof. Pierantonio Frare (Founder and Director of the \"International Summer School in Manzoni Studies\", Professor of Italian Literature and Director of the Department of Italian and Comparative Studies) and masterfully conducted by Prof. Giuseppe Polimeni of the Universit√† degli Studi di Milano (full professor of History of the Italian language and member of the scientific committee of the National Center for Manzonian Studies) with an interesting lesson on the linguistic plans in the Promessi Sposi, focusing in particular on ‚ÄúLucia's plan‚Äù with the report ¬´Oh! you who are a woman, in the name of the Virgin Mary...!¬ª. Lucia's speech overturns the speech in The Promessi Sposi, it is a whispered speech, humble social level, existential planning of the strong Manzonian woman, functional and prospective constancy for other discreet glances on expressive landscapes, in municipal and ecumenical current affairs. Many authors and critics cited: Stella, Bacchelli, Angelini, Russo, Pari, Valesio, Spera, Zama, Sarni, Alziati, Formigari and many others‚úçÔ∏è Moments of discussion, training and great growth took place among the participants of the International Summer School in Manzoni Studiesüìö\n\nüìçMorning of very high culture and literary study on Carlo Emilio Gadda in the lesson organized and coordinated by Prof. Toni Iermano (University of Cassino and Southern Lazio) and masterfully held by Prof. Giuseppe Lupo (Catholic University of the Sacred Heart) and by Prof. Costanza d'Emilia (University of Cassino and Southern Lazio). Carlo Emilio Gadda was one of the most complex and innovative writers and intellectuals of the Italian twentieth century. An engineer, Gadda brought an almost obsessive attention to technical and linguistic details to his works, mixing dialects, scientific terms and neologisms in dense and nuanced prose. His fiction reflects a fragmented and chaotic worldview, influenced by his personal experiences, the world wars, and the social tensions of his time. Among his most famous works stand out \"Quer pasticciaccio ugly de via Merulana\" and \"The cognition of pain\". These works, in addition to highlighting his extraordinary literary talent, are also an acute analysis of the contradictions and neuroses of Italian society. Gadda is often compared to James Joyce for the complexity of his writing and stylistic innovation, but his work remains deeply rooted in Italian culture and history. Reading Gadda means immersing yourself in a unique linguistic universe, where irony, sarcasm and a disenchanted vision of reality come together in a fascinating and challenging literary experience. üìöüìöüìö"
