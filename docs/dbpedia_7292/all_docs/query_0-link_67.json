        "text": "Although a well-travelled research path, Anglo-Italian studies can, in our contemporary critical environment, be significantly enhanced through a close dialogue with cultural studies vis-à-vis the transnational status of its mediating figures. My aim here is to examine Giuseppe Baretti, one of the most notable of the early modern “literary migrants” between Italy and England, in this light. This paper tackles two relevant examples of Baretti’s work: first, his attempt, after his return to northern Italy in the 1760s following an extended period living in England and traveling through the Iberian Peninsula and France, to establish a literary magazine, La frusta letteraria (1764-5), according to English models; the second, his polemic against cultural stereotyping in his Account of the Manners and Customs of Italy (1768). Through direct (and sometimes harsh) criticism of several “perverse” cultural go-betweens – Samuel Sharp, Voltaire, and Carlo Denina, for example – Baretti sought to correct a widespread and strongly biased image of Italy, employing the advantage of his unique knowledge of both English and Italian cultures against both countries’ detractors.\n\nThis interdisciplinary seminar will study Romanticism as a literary trend, as much as a historical phenomenon and a life attitude. Romanticism is viewed here as the sum of the different answers to the sense of insecurity, social alienation and loneliness, provoked by the changing and frail world of the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century. We will investigate the Romantic ideology in relation to the trans-Adriatic world of Italy and Greece, an area that entered modernity with the particular lure and burden of antiquity, as well as through revolutionary upheaval. Students will be invited to read authors like Vittorio Alfieri, Ugo Foscolo, Silvio Pellico, Giacomo Leopardi, Alessandro Manzoni, Massimo d’Azeglio, and to reflect on themes such as Nostalgia and Nationalism, the Discovery of the Middle Ages, the Historical Novel, the Invention of Popular Tradition, the Fragmented Self, Autobiographical and Travel Writing, the Brigand Cult, Hellenism, Philhellenism, Orientalism and Balkanism, and others.\n\nThe first half of nineteenth century has been very crucial for Italy and Europe as well. After the fall of Napoleonic hegemony in Europe in 1815, Austrian Hapsburg Empire again started to have its control over different states or City-States of Italian peninsula. In such political atmosphere many Italian writers like Ugo Foscolo, Alessandro Manzoni and Giacomo Leopardi had already started rejecting the static adherence to the classical forms of arts and had begun to emphasize on the need of patriotic and popular literature. Poets and writers are expected to direct their ideas and writing to the people. This propels the need of a new and different approach to literature and arts which should deal with the concerns of common people and should be accessible to them. In such scenario Romantic Movement was taking its first steps in Italy."
