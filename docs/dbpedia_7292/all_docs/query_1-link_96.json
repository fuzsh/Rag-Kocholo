        "text": "1. Literature of the Renaissance in Italy Lecture 2\n\n2. Problems to be discussed  1. The appearance of Italian literature  2. Significant writers and poets associated with the Renaissance literature  3. Important Writers and Renaissance Literature  4. 13 CLASSIC BOOKS EVERY ITALIAN HAS READ WHEN IN SCHOOL\n\n3. The appearance of Italian literature  Renaissance literature refers to European literature which was influenced by the intellectual and cultural tendencies associated with the Renaissance. The literature of the Renaissance was written within the general movement of the Renaissance, which arose in 14th-century Italy and continued until the mid-17th century in England while being diffused into the rest of the western world.[1] It is characterized by the adoption of a humanist philosophy and the recovery of the classical Antiquity. It benefited from the spread of printing in the latter part of the 15th century.\n\n4.  For the writers of the Renaissance, Greco- Roman inspiration was shown both in the themes of their writing and in the literary forms they used. The world was considered from an anthropocentric perspective. Platonic ideas were revived and put to the service of Christianity. The search for pleasures of the senses and a critical and rational spirit completed the ideological panorama of the period. New literary genres such as the essay (Montaigne) and new metrical forms such as the Spenserian stanza made their appearance.\n\n5.  The impact of the Renaissance varied across the continent; countries that were predominantly Catholic or Protestant experienced the Renaissance differently. Areas where the Eastern Orthodox Church was culturally dominant, as well as those areas of Europe under Islamic rule, were more or less outside its influence. The period focused on self- actualization and one's ability to accept what is going on in one's life.[citation needed]  The earliest Renaissance literature appeared in Italy in the 14th century; Petrarch, Machiavelli, and Ariosto are notable examples of Italian Renaissance writers.\n\n6.  From Italy, the influence of the Renaissance spread at different times to other countries and continued to spread around Europe through the 17th century. The English Renaissance and the Renaissance in Scotland date from the late 15th century to the early 17th century.[1] In northern Europe, the scholarly writings of Erasmus, the plays of William Shakespeare, the poems of Edmund Spenser, and the writings of Sir Philip Sidney may be considered Renaissance in character.  The development of the printing press (using movable type) by Johannes Gutenberg in the 1440s encouraged authors to write in their local vernacular instead of Greek or Latin classical languages, thus widening the reading audience and promoting the spread of Renaissance ideas.\n\n7. Significant writers and poets associated with the Renaissance literature are:  Italian: Petrarch, Giovanni Boccaccio, Jacopo Sannazaro, Niccolò Machiavelli, Ludovico Ariosto, Michelangelo Francesco Petrarca Francesco Petrarca (Italian: [franˈtʃesko peˈtrarka]; 20 July 1304 – 18/19 July 1374), commonly anglicized as Petrarch (/ˈpiːtrɑːrk, ˈpɛt- /), was a scholar and poet of early Renaissance Italy, and one of the earliest humanists.[1]\n\n8. Giovanni Boccaccio  Giovanni Boccaccio (UK: /bəˈkætʃioʊ/, US: /boʊˈkɑːtʃ(i)oʊ, bə- /, Italian: [dʒoˈvanni bokˈkattʃo]; 16 June 1313 – 21 December 1375)[nb 1] was an Italian writer, poet, correspondent of Petrarch, and an important Renaissance humanist. Born in the town of Certaldo, he became so well known as a writer that he was sometimes simply known as \"the Certaldese\"[nb 2] and one of the most important figures in the European literary panorama of the fourteenth century. Some scholars (including Vittore Branca) define him as the greatest European prose writer of his time, a versatile writer who amalgamated different literary trends and genres, making them converge in original works, thanks to a creative activity exercised under the banner of experimentalism.\n\n9. Jacopo Sannazaro  Jacopo Sannazaro (Italian pronunciation: [ˈjaːkopo sanna dˈdzaːro]; 28 July 1458[1] – 6 August 1530[2]) was an Italian poet, humanist, member and head of the Accademia Pontaniana from Naples.\n\n10. Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli  Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli (3 May 1469 – 21 June 1527) was an Italian diplomat, author, philosopher and historian who lived during the Renaissance. He is best known for his political treatise The Prince (Il Principe), written around 1513 but not published until 1532, five years after his death.He has often been called the father of\n\n11. Ludovico Ariosto  Ludovico Ariosto (Italian: [ludoˈviːko aˈrjɔsto, - ariˈɔsto]; 8 September 1474 – 6 July 1533) was an Italian poet. He is best known as the author of the romance epic Orlando Furioso (1516). The poem, a continuation of Matteo Maria Boiardo's Orlando Innamorato, describes the adventures of Charlemagne, Orlando, and the Franks as they battle against the Saracens with diversions into many sideplots. The poem is transformed into a satire of the chivalric tradition.[1] Ariosto composed the poem in the ottava rima rhyme scheme and introduced narrative commentary throughout the work.\n\n12. Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni  Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (Italian: [mikeˈlandʒelo di lodoˈviːko ˌbwɔnarˈr ɔːti siˈmoːni]; 6 March 1475 – 18 February 1564), known as Michelangelo (English: /ˌmaɪkəlˈændʒəloʊ, ˌmɪk- /[1]), was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect,[2] and poet of the High Renaissance. Born in the Republic of Florence, his work was inspired by models from classical antiquity and had a lasting influence on Western art. Michelangelo's creative abilities and mastery in a range of artistic arenas define him as an archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and elder contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci.[3] Given the sheer volume of surviving correspondence, sketches, and reminiscences, Michelangelo is one of the best- documented artists of the 16th century. He was lauded by contemporary biographers as the most accomplished artist of his era.\n\n13. Storia della letteratura italiana  The Storia della letteratura italiana (History of Italian Literature) is an essay written by Italian literary critic Francesco de Sanctis, published by Morano in two volumes in 1870 and 1871. It is considered the first truly complete, organic treatment of Italian literature as a whole.\n\n14. The Storia della letteratura italiana consists of the 20 chapters (the last two are somewhat shorter and less in-depth, due to pressure the publisher put on De Sanctis to complete the work):\n\n15. Important Writers and Renaissance Literature  The Renaissance was an evolutionary period for the people in Europe. New philosophies such as humanism developed and grew throughout the 13th- 16th centuries. These philosophical concepts influenced art and literature of the time. In fact, some of history’s greatest works of literature were created during the Renaissance.\n\n16.  One of the first literary works that contributed to the Renaissance was the Divine Comedy written by Dante Alighieri in 1321. Dante was one of the most prominent developing forces of Italian literature and the Renaissance. The Divine Comedy is a three part epic poem of Dante’s fictional journey into the afterlife. It represents the soul’s journey towards God. The poem was written in Italian rather than Latin which marks the end of the Middle Ages and rise of Renaissance humanism. Through his writing he contributed to the growth of humanism, created new literary elements that later authors adopted, and challenged the power of the Church.\n\n18.  Another important Renaissance literary work is The Praise of Folly. It was written by Desiderius Erasmus in 1509. The essay critiques the practices of the Church and its political allies. It created much controversy and played an important role in the beginnings of the Protestant Reformation.\n\n19.  Niccolo Machiavelli authored The Prince in 1513. The book criticized another important institution; the government. The Prince presented many controversial concepts and theories about politics and power. Machiavelli used the character of “a new prince” that would come to power through deceit, force, and careful calculation. He justified the use of doing wrong things to get power if it meant that that power could be used to do good. Although controversial, it is seen as the earliest work of modern political philosophy. This political thought influenced many leaders throughout history.\n\n20.  The later part of the Renaissance gave way to works such as Don Quixote written by Miguel de Cervantes of Spain in 1612. This was considered the first modern novel and is one of the most readily available pieces of Western literature in history. It was a renaissance humanist critique on how people often chase impractical delusions of idealism and nobility.\n\n21.  The greatest writer of the Renaissance (and perhaps in all of history) was William Shakespeare. Born in England around April 1564, Shakespeare was a playwright, poet, and actor. His works comprise of over 150 sonnets and nearly 40 plays, including Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Macbeth, and many more.\n\n22. 13 CLASSIC BOOKS EVERY ITALIAN HAS READ WHEN IN SCHOOL\n\n23. La Divina Commedia – Dante Alighieri  Undoubtedly the most important Italian book of all times, La Divina Commedia is one of the masterpieces of world literature. Supposedly written between 1306 and 1321 by Dante Alighieri, the book tells the story of the journey the writer is able to take in the afterlife. Divina Commedia is divided into three parts, called cantiche: l’Inferno, il Purgatorio and il Paradiso (Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise). Each cantica is then divided into 33 canti.\n\n24. Decameron – Giovanni Boccaccio  Another very important Medieval work of art is the Decameron by Giovanni Boccaccio, a collection of short stories told by a group of young people, seven girls and three men, who are forced to stay away from Florence for ten days, in order to avoid the terrible black plague that was haunting the area at the time.\n\n25. Il Principe – Niccolò Machiavelli  In 1513, Niccolò Machiavelli wrote Il Principe, which is an essay about politics where the writer describes the characteristics of principalities and the methods to conquer and maintain them. It is a very popular essay, which cannot be classified under a specific literary genre, and led its author to be considered the founder of the modern political sciences.\n\n26. Orlando Furioso – Ludovico Ariosto  Then comes a love story. It’s the Orlando Furioso by Ludovico Ariosto, a poem written in 1516 that tells the story of Orlando and Angelica. Those are the two main characters of the poem: Orlando is a Christian knight, while Angelica is a beautiful young lady who is the object of the love of many knights.\n\n27. Ultime lettere di Jacopo Ortis – Ugo Foscolo  Inspired by Goethe’s The Sorrows of Young Werther, Ultime lettere di Jacopo Ortis is the first epistolary novel in Italian literature. Published in 1802, the book is a collection of the letters that the main character, Jacopo Ortis, sent to his friend Lorenzo Alderani, who published them after the suicide of Jacopo. The story is invented but takes inspiration from a real event – the suicide of the student Gerolamo Ortis in 1796.\n\n28. I promessi sposi – Alessandro Manzoni  Together with La Divina Commedia, I promessi sposi is probably the most important book in Italian literature. Undoubtedly, these two are the most popular ones, the books every Italian has read or studied in his life. I am sure you will not find a single Italian who doesn’t know what La Divina Commedia or I promessi sposi are. I hope so, at least!\n\n29. Le mie prigioni – Silvio Pellico  Published only ten years before the final version of I promessi sposi, Le mie prigioni describes the imprisonment of the author, Silvio Pellico, who was held prisoner for participating in the Carbonari riots in Milan. The book covers a period of ten years, from 1820 to 1830, during which Silvio Pellico was imprisoned first in Venice and then in Brno.\n\n30. Cuore – Edmondo De Amicis  completely different book from the ones mentioned before, Cuore was published in 1886. Intended for young readers, the book is written as a diary kept by Enrico Bottini, who writes about his life and that of his fellow pupils in the school year 1881-1882.\n\n31. I Malavoglia – Giovanni Verga  I Malavoglia is undoubtedly the most famous novel by Giovanni Verga and one of the most popular Italian classic books in general. Published in 1881, it tells the story of a family of fishermen who live in Aci Trezza, a little Sicilian village near Catania. The family has a very difficult life and has to experience many sorrows and losses.\n\n32. Il fu Mattia Pascal – Luigi Pirandello  This is the first book written by the Nobel prize winner Luigi Pirandello. It was first published in installments, then as a single volume in 1904. The book tells the story of Mattia Pascal, a librarian who has a boring and unsatisfying job. One day, he reads the newspapers and realizes that everybody thinks he’s dead, so he decides to start and new life and disappear.\n\n33. La coscienza di Zeno – Italo Svevo  Here comes another masterpiece of Italian literature. Published in 1923, La coscienza di Zeno tells the story of Zeno Corsini: it is actually an analysis that the main character makes of himself.\n\n34. Il deserto dei Tartari – Dino Buzzati Once again, it is a true masterpiece and a very enjoyable and interesting read. It is a very powerful book about the uselessness of war too.\n\n35. Il deserto dei Tartari – Dino Buzzati Published in 1940, the book gave its author, Dino Buzzati, a huge success. Set in an imaginary place on the borders of the Italian kingdom, it tells the story of Giovanni Drogo, a soldier who becomes an officer and is sent to Fortezza Bastiani."
