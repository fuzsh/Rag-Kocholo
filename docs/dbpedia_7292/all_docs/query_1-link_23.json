        "text": "The first half of nineteenth century has been very crucial for Italy and Europe as well. After the fall of Napoleonic hegemony in Europe in 1815, Austrian Hapsburg Empire again started to have its control over different states or City-States of Italian peninsula. In such political atmosphere many Italian writers like Ugo Foscolo, Alessandro Manzoni and Giacomo Leopardi had already started rejecting the static adherence to the classical forms of arts and had begun to emphasize on the need of patriotic and popular literature. Poets and writers are expected to direct their ideas and writing to the people. This propels the need of a new and different approach to literature and arts which should deal with the concerns of common people and should be accessible to them. In such scenario Romantic Movement was taking its first steps in Italy.\n\nThis special issue of Textus assesses the current state of British Romantic studies in Italy – a tradition that has long been at the forefront of innovative scholarly and theoretical developments within literary criticism. Italian Romanticists have helped not just to shape the newest historicisms and formalisms, but also to bring adjacent arenas of study – text and media, body and affect, ecology and anthropology, identity and geography – into dialogue with literary studies and with one another. Their arguments, moreover, have been sustained by a frequently comparatist, insistently internationalist, vision.\n\nThis paper deals with Alberto Savinio's 1938 conference \"Drammaticità di Leopardi,\" presupposing the nineteenth-century poet as one of his most important sources. Tracking a hidden self-portrait in Savinio's homage to Giacomo Leopardi, we encounter the problem of identity and the question of cultural belonging. This key issue seems to unite Savinio with Leopardi: both can be considered as outsiders within their culture, and this status appears to be globally connected with their modernity. Thus, dealing with Savinio and Leopardi promises to provide further understanding of \"anti-modern\" Italian culture from its margins.\n\nIn this paper we aim to approach Giacomo Leopardi's theory of imagination, one of the keystones of the theory of literature developed in the Zibaldone di pensieri (2016), by reading it through the lens of early german romantic philosophy. The effort to think poetry, in the Zibaldone, is responsible for fascinating speculations which, according to recent studies, such as Dido (2020), Givone (2003), Garcia (2019), mark the limits of the materialistic nihilism as an hermeneutical paradigm. Therefore, by reading three different passages of the Zibaldone di pensieri (2016), we analyze how the problem of imagination is structurally connected with those of the final cause and of Geist. This exegetical step then leads us to read the three passages by comparing them with Friedrich Schlegel's (1973) notions of Witz and Ironie, as well as with Kant's (1974) remarks on determinative and reflective judgment. We conclude that Leopardi's speculation on imagination could be better understood if read from the post-kantian and early german romantic perspective, a tradition with which the leopardian theory of literature has been hitherto rarely compared.\n\nThis special issue gathers together articles which explicitly engage with the journal’s action in local, national, and international cultural networks, from Solaria’s inception in 1926 to the demise of Botteghe Oscure in 1960. The chronological spectrum of this guest-edited issue ensures that, for instance, we can identify the main phases of the development of a disinterested, and seemingly apolitical, approach to the role of the arts, cutting across Solaria, Letteratura, and Botteghe Oscure, linking together Florence, Rome and the various foreign republics of letters with which these journals dialogued over the years"
