        "text": "Even though Italy did not exist as a state until the country's unification in 1861, its immense contributions to the cultural and historical heritage of Europe and the world are now recognized as distinctly Italian.\n\nThe history of Italy in the nineteenth century was one of struggle, for unity and for political autonomy as defined by the Risorgimento movement, and of victory, later realized in the democratic successes of 1861 and 1871.\n\nThe political, social, economic and cultural changes and reforms of the late 18th and 19th centuries, including a several foreign invasions, most notably by Napoleon Bonaparte and the Austrians, several revolutions in 1848 and the turbulent Risorgimento, resulted in a series of minor and major changes in style in the Italian art forms and cultural expression.\n\nThe goal of freedom was embraced by the artists and theorists of Romanticism, a movement that gathered force in the first decades of the nineteenth century and grew to dominance by mid-century.\n\nAt the forefront of the romantic movement were three writers: Ugo Foscolo, Alessandro Manzoni, and Giacomo Leopardi. They rejected the slavish adherence to classical forms, and called for modernity, innovation, and contemporary relevance in poetry. The chief aim of Romantic poetry had to be the quest for truth, and allied his project with historical progress, specifically, the unification of Italy. Manzoni set about achieving the latter in his first and only novel, I promessi sposi (The Betrothed), first published in 1827. The novel opposed the heroic ideals of classical literature, focusing instead on the lives of ordinary people-\n\nThe Italian movement took another direction, separate from the German romantic school, with an emphasis on patriotism, Christianity, and humanity, and their relentless search for truth, which defined literature in Italy for more than half a century.\n\nThe Romantic ideals of Manzoni were further strengthened by the writings of Giacomo Leopardi. While not as well known as Manzoni during his lifetime, he is considered the great lyric poet of the age. He created a remarkable and renowned poetic work, related to the Romantic era.\n\nThe political side of the movement was futher strenghtened by the later Romantics. The literary movement that preceded and was contemporary with the political revolution of 1848 may be said to be represented by four writers - Giuseppe Giusti, Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi, Vincenzo Gioberti and Cesare Balbo.\n\nThe Sicilian Luigi Pirandello an Italian dramatist, novelist, and short story writer awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1934, for his \"bold and brilliant renovation of the drama and the stage.\"\n\nCarlo Collodi wrote one of the world's best known children's stories Pinocchio in 1883.\n\nItalian Neoclassical and 19th century art refers to painting and/or the plastic arts made in Italy or by Italian citizens in the Neoclassical period (late 18th - c. mid-19th centuries) and the 19th century.\n\nThe European movement called \"neoclassicism\" began in Italy after 1750, as a reaction against both the surviving Baroque and Rococo styles, and as a desire to return to the perceived \"purity\" of the arts of Rome, the more vague perception (\"ideal\") of Ancient Greek arts, and, to a lesser extent, 16th century Renaissance Classicism. Indoors, neoclassicism made a discovery of the genuine classic interior, inspired by the rediscoveries at Pompeii and Herculaneum, which had started in the late 1740s, but only achieved a wide audience in the 1760s, with the first luxurious volumes of tightly controlled distribution of Le Antichit√† di Ercolano.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte, who ruled most of Italy in the early 19th century hired Antonio Canova, one of the most influential Italian neoclassical sculptors and plastic artists to make sculptures for him, one of the most famous being that of Venus Victrix, an allegory of Pauline Bonaparte.\n\nItaly also developed several other artistic movements in the 19th centuries, like the Macchiaioli, who influenced French impressionism.\n\nThe Macchiaioli were a group of Italian painters active in Tuscany in the second half of the nineteenth century, who, breaking with the antiquated conventions taught by the Italian academies of art, did much of their painting outdoors in order to capture natural light, shade, and color. They believed that areas of light and shadow, or \"macchie\" (literally patches or spots) were the chief components of a work of art. This practice relates the Macchiaioli to the French Impressionists who came to prominence a few years later, although the Macchiaioli pursued somewhat different purposes."
