Civitacampomarano is a small medieval town located in the Molise region of southern Italy. It stands at an elevation of 520 metres above sea level. It has a population of around 370 inhabitants. Its history dates back to ancient times, with evidence of Samnite settlements in the area. Over the centuries, the town came under the rule of various civilizations, including the Romans, Lombards, and Normans. During the medieval period, Civitacampomarano became an important fortified town, strategically positioned on a hill to defend against potential invasions. The town's historical architecture and cobblestone streets still reflect its medieval heritage.\n\nCivitacampomarano borders Castelbottaccio, Castelmauro, Guardialfiera, Lucito, Lupara, and Trivento.\n\nIt is the birthplace of soldier and patriot Gabriele Pepe and of politician, patriot and writer Vincenzo Cuoco.\n\nGabriele Pepe (December 7, 1779 - July 26, 1849) a soldier, patriot, poet and literary figure, who fought in defence of the Neapolitan Republic in 1799. He was a cousin of Guglielmo and Florestano Pepe. He entered the Neapolitan Army at an early age. In the events of the Neapolitan Republic, he was captured by royalist troops led by Fabrizio Ruffo and exiled to France. Here he fought for the Napoleonic armies both under Joseph Bonaparte and Joachim Murat. He took part in the Neapolitan Revolution of 1820, and was again sent to exile, this time to Florence. On February 19, 1826, he duelled with the poet Alphonse de Lamartine, who had compared Italians to \"human dust\" in his poem \"Le Dernier Chant du pélerinage d'Harold\".[1] He wounded the French poet in the right arm. In 1836, he returned to Naples where, although aged, participated in the 1848 riots. He died July 26 1849 in Civitacampomarano.\n\nVincenzo Cuoco (October 1, 1770 – December 14, 1823) an Italian writer. He is mainly remembered for his Saggio Storico sulla Rivoluzione Napoletana del 1799 (\"Historical Essay on the Neapolitan Revolution of 1799\"). He is considered as one of the precursors of Italian liberalism and the realist school. Cuoco adapted the critique of political rationalism of Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre for liberal ends, and has been described as a better historian than either of them. He influenced many subsequent Italian intellectuals, from Ugo Foscolo and Alessandro Manzoni to Bertrando and Silvio Spaventa to Benedetto Croce and Antonio Gramsci."
