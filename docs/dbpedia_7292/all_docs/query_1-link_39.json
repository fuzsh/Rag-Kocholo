But is censorship decreed by political or intellectual authorities ever legitimate? And is there knowledge meant to remain beyond human reach and revealed only to a special few? Was Socrates banishment of poetry from the Republic really comparable to the strictures of the Index of Forbidden Books (1559)? And why did it take so long for the latter to be published? Did that mean esoteric or heretical pursuits were permissible for the first 1500 years of Roman Catholicism? if so, under which guise? This course explores the historical faces of forbiddenness and the subversions of it from antiquity to the eighteenth century through the works of Plato (Republic and others); Dante, On Monarchy; On Literature in the Vernacular; Petrarch, On the Ignorance of Himself and Many Others; Galileo, Letter to Dutchess Christina, On the Chief Two World Systems; Retraction; Descartes, Discourse on Method (ch. 5); Montaigne, Essays (On the Vanity of Words; On Prayer); Marlowe, Tragical History of the Life and Death of Dr. Faustus; Milton, Aeropagitica; Defoe, Essay on the Regulation of the Press; Rousseau, A Supplement to Bougainvilles Voyage. We will also consider the rise of societies in the early-modern period, private and public, as they relate to the idea of accessing, circumscribing and censoring different bodies of knowledge (literary academies; LAcadémie Francaise; the concept of university/universitas and the early function of colleges; alchemy, secrets and hermetic science; the evolution of the man of letters i.e. the intellectual subsequent to the invention of the printing press; libertinism and divine brotherhoods, including the Rosicrucians, Illuminati, and the Jesuit controversy).

In what ways have Italian literary theory and practice influenced the development of other national languages and literatures? This course will survey modern Italian literature in light of the major aesthetic and historical developments that have shaped what the philosopher of history Giambattista Vico called the peculiar \"sapientia Italorum\" (\"Italian wisdom\"). Among the questions we will explore are: did Italy have an Enlightenment? Did Italian Romanticism exist? Why did modern Italian artists have such political influence (Alessandro Manzoni, Giuseppe Verdi, and Giovanni Verga were all made senators; Mussolini himself was an aspiring novelist). This course will provide a comprehensive grammar review and include a mandatory weekly meeting with the tutor; significant work in Italian conversation and composition. Authors include Vittorio Alfieri, Ugo Foscolo, Manzoni, Giacomo Leopardi, Futurist manifestoes, Italo Calvino, Grazia Deledda, and others. We will examine such themes as literary nationalism, the Italian language question, and the relationship of Italian literature to the \"sister arts\" of cinema and opera. All the course work and reading will be in Italian; Prerequisite Intermediate Italian or the equivalent. On-line registration\n\nSee Literature section for description.
