        "text": "Romanticism\n\nForemost among writers in the early struggles for his country’s unity and freedom from foreign domination was Ugo Foscolo, who reconciled passionate feeling with a formal perfection inspired by classical models. His Ultime lettere di Jacopo Ortis (1802; The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis) was an epistolary story, reminiscent of Goethe’s Werther, of a young man forced to suicide by frustrated love for both a woman and his fatherland. It was extremely moving and popular, as was a poem, “Dei sepolcri” (1807; “On Sepulchres”), in which, in fewer than 300 lines, he wrote lyrically on the theme of the inspiration to be had from contemplating the tombs of the great, exhorting Italians to be worthy of their heritage. This poem influenced the Italian Risorgimento, or national revival, and a passage in which Florence was praised because it preserved in the church of Santa Croce the ashes of Michelangelo, Machiavelli, and Galileo is still very popular in Italy. Two odes celebrating the divine quality of beauty, 12 sonnets ranking with the best of Petrarch’s and Tasso’s, and an unfinished poem, “Le grazie” (“The Graces”), also testified to Foscolo’s outstanding poetic merit. As an exile in England from 1816 until his death in 1827, he wrote remarkable critical essays on Italian literature for English readers.\n\nIn Foscolo patriotism and classicism united to form a single fixed passion, but the eclectic Vincenzo Monti was outstanding for mobility of feeling. He saw danger to his country in the French Revolution and wrote Il pellegrino apostolico (1782; “The Apostolic Pilgrim”) and In morte di Ugo Bassville (1793; The Penance of Hugo), usually known as La bassvilliana; Napoleon’s victories aroused his praise in Prometeo (c. 1805; “Prometheus”), Il bardo della selva nera (1806; “The Bard of the Dark Wood”), and La spada di Federico II (1806; “The Sword of Frederick II”); in Il fanatismo and La superstizione (1797) he attacked the papacy; later he extolled the Austrians. Thus every great event made him change his mind, through lack of political conviction, yet he achieved greatness in La bellezza dell’universo (1781; “The Beauty of the Universe”), in the lyrics inspired by domestic affections, and in a translation of the Iliad, a masterpiece of Neoclassical beauty.\n\nOpposing movements\n\nMelchiorre Cesarotti occupied a prominent position in the world of learning at the end of the 18th century, and his translations of James Macpherson’s Ossian poetry, Poesie di Ossian (1763–72), influenced Foscolo, Giacomo Leopardi, and others by their mysterious and gloomy fantasy, so alien to the classical inspiration; Saggio sulla filosofia delle lingue (1785; “Essay on the Philosophy of Languages”) was an important essay in the dispute on the Italian language. The trend was toward pedantic classicism as a reaction against an excessive Gallicism favoured by some 18th-century writers. Among the purists was Antonio Cesari, who brought out a new enlarged edition of the Vocabolario della Crusca (the first Italian dictionary, published by the Accademia della Crusca in 1612). He wrote Sopra lo stato presente della lingua italiana (1810; “On the Present State of the Italian Language”) and endeavoured to establish the supremacy of Tuscan and of Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio as models. But a Lombard school opposed this Tuscan supremacy. Monti, its leader, issued Proposta di alcune correzioni ed aggiunte al vocabolario della Crusca (1817–26; “Proposal for Some Corrections and Additions to the Crusca Dictionary”), which attacked the Tuscanism of the Crusca. By contrast, the patriot Pietro Giordani—for a time a journalistic colleague of Monti—was a great exponent of purismo. His views did not stem from literary pedantry, however, but from a concern that all social groups throughout Italy should have a common means of communication. In this respect he was linguistically opposed to the great Romantic poet Carlo Porta, who lampooned the aristocracy and clergy and expressed sympathy with the humble and wretched in narrative poems composed not in Italian but in a lively Milanese dialect. All Italy took part in the disputes about language, literature, and politics.\n\nAn artificial form of classicism was associated with the Napoleonic domination of Italy, so that when Napoleon fell, forces antagonistic to classicism arose. Literary Romanticism had already won favour with the French, who erroneously thought themselves akin to the German Romantics. Between 1816 and 1818 a battle was fought for Romanticism, particularly in Milan, where a Romantic periodical, Il Conciliatore (1818–19; “The Peacemaker”), was published. Giovanni Berchet (patriotic poet whose Lettera semiseria di Grisostomo al suo figliuolo [1816; “Half-Serious Letter from Grisostomo to His Son”] is an important manifesto of Italian popular romanticism), Silvio Pellico, Ludovico di Breme, Giovita Scalvini, and Ermes Visconti were among its contributors. Their efforts were silenced in 1820 when several of them were arrested by the Austrian police because of their liberal opinions; among them was Pellico, who later wrote a famous account of his experiences, Le mie prigioni (1832; My Prisons).\n\nAlessandro Manzoni (grandson of reformer Cesare Beccaria) was the chief exponent of Italian Romanticism, but perhaps an even higher claim to fame was his contribution to the resolution of the language problem. In 1821 he started working on a panoramic novel about the lives of simple people placed against a background of major historical events, and, in order that this should be accessible to a wide readership, he decided to write it in an idiom as close as possible to modern educated Florentine speech. This was a formidable enterprise for someone whose first languages were French and Milanese dialect—and to whom spoken Florentine was virtually a foreign tongue—and for the first draft (completed in 1823) he had to resort to Francesco Cherubini’s Italian-Milanese dictionary. The second draft was published in 1825–27 under the title I promessi sposi (The Betrothed); and the final definitive edition came out in 1840–42 after a long, painstaking process of revision aimed at making the text conform more closely with colloquial Florentine usage. The result of this effort was clear, expressive prose—neither pretentious nor provincial—and the way in which the novel caught the public’s imagination attested to Manzoni’s success in addressing the sort of people to whom conventional literary Italian was almost as remote as Latin. Ironically, Manzoni the innovator became, in his turn, the model for a new kind of purism, with “Manzonians” composing works in an affected Tuscan, and it required authors with fresh ideas—not poor imitators—to continue the task of disencumbering and modernizing written Italian.\n\nManzoni’s genius as a poet showed in the odes Il cinque maggio (1821; “The Fifth of May”), written on the death of Napoleon, and Marzo 1821 (1821; “March 1821”) and in passages of his Inni sacri (1812–22; Sacred Hymns), five poems in celebration of church holy days, describing human affections. His tragedies, Il conte di Carmagnola (performed 1820; “The Count of Carmagnola”) and Adelchi (1822), about the Frankish conquest of Italy, marked a victory of Romanticism over classicism; they contained passages of great lyrical beauty but lacked strong dramatic power.\n\nThe foremost Italian poet of the age was Giacomo Leopardi, an outstanding scholar and thinker whose philological works together with his philosophical writings, Operette morali, would alone place him among the great writers of the 19th century. Embittered by solitude, sickness, and near penury, he realized from age 20 the vanity of hope. Though he developed a doctrine of universal pessimism, seeing life as evil and death as the only comfort, the poetry based on these bitter, despairing premises was far from depressing. Most of Leopardi’s poems were contained in one book, I canti (“Songs”; Eng. trans. The Poems of Leopardi), first published in 1831. Some were patriotic and were once very popular; but the most memorable came from deeper lyrical inspiration. Among them were “L’infinito,” a meditation on infinity; “A Silvia,” on the memory of a girl who died when he was 20; Le ricordanze, an evocation of his childhood; “Il passero solitario,” comparing the lonely poet with the bird that sings in isolation; and “La quiete dopo la tempesta” and “Il sabato del villaggio,” two pictures of village life. They balance depth of meaning and formal beauty, simplicity of diction, intensity, and verbal music."
