Ugo Foscolo: The Revolutionary Poet of Italian Literature

A Legacy of Passion and National Pride

Ugo Foscolo is renowned for his thought-provoking poetry and novels that ignited a sense of national pride and resistance against foreign occupation in Italy. His most notable work, Dei Sepolcri (On Sepulchres), a long poem written in 1807, is a testament to his literary genius and continues to inspire generations of Italians.

Early Life and Influences

Born Niccolò Foscolo on February 6, 1778, in Zakynthos, Ionian Islands, to an impoverished Venetian nobleman and a Greek mother, Foscolo's cultural heritage played a significant role in shaping his literary style. His father's death in 1788 prompted the family's move to Venice, where Foscolo completed his studies at the University of Padua. Among his influential teachers was Abbé Melchiore Cesarotti, whose version of Ossian left an indelible mark on Foscolo's literary tastes.

Nationalism and Literary Ambitions

Foscolo's literary career began to take shape with the publication of his tragedy, Tieste, in 1797, which enjoyed moderate success. However, it was his involvement in national politics that truly ignited his passion. He became an active member of national committees, addressing an ode to Napoleon, hoping the French leader would overthrow the Venetian oligarchy and establish a free republic.

The Fall of the Venetian Republic and Its Impact

The Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, which dissolved the ancient Republic of Venice and handed over the city and the Veneto to the Austrians, dealt a severe blow to Foscolo's hopes. This tumultuous period inspired his novel, The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis, published in 1798. This work, often compared to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther, reflected Foscolo's anguish and disillusionment with the fall of the Venetian Republic.
