        "text": "Joy in Melilla\n\nThere was nothing but joy in Melilla yesterday as UD Melilla hit the jackpot in the Copa del Rey draw. Melilla is a city hurt by constantly making the news over border conflicts; now it has the chance, if only for a few days, to appear and shine for happier reasons. Football doesn’t provide solutions, but it does bring joy, and that’s a good thing. Funnily enough, not long ago a group of us from AS, at one of our Encuentros con los Ases (an event with a panel of AS journalists), were discussing a feeling of abandonment and indifference suffered in Melilla, and now they are finally making the headlines for other reasons. After the ‘Alcorconazo’ – when Los Blancos lost 4-0 to Alcorcón a few years back – everyone is allowed to dream. The Copa del Rey draw is a unique day in the footballing calendar.\n\nElsewhere\n\nThe draw has also been kind to Qatar-run la Cultural, Sant Andreu and CD Ebro. Cultural Leonesa will face Barça, who have strong connections to León, mainly through César, that León native who scored so many goals in a Barça shirt. The likeable Sant Andreu, meanwhile, where Serena and Martí Filosía both retired, dreamed of Barça or Betis, but will be more than happy drawing Atlético. And CD Ebro, who scooped fourth prize in being matched up with another Champions League team, Valencia, and will draw their biggest ever crowds at La Romareda.\n\nLaLiga"
