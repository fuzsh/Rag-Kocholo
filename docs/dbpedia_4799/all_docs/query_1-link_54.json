You will also be asked to enter your in-progress courses for year 12.\n\nAt ASU, a transfer student is anyone applying for admission who has attended another college or university and has completed 12 or more transferable credits post-high school, at the time of application. If you are completing college courses while in high school you are considered a freshman and not a transfer student.\n\nInternational freshman and transfer F-1 students may be considered for the New American University Scholarship, which helps with college expenses."
