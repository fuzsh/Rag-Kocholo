        "text": "No. The reason you first need to indicate what exam in which you are interested is because not all exams are offered at all centers. For example, while the nearest test center to your home may be one mile away, that center may not deliver the exam want to take.\n\nYes. Many test appointments can be cancelled and/or rescheduled through the Prometric Web site. From the Prometric.com home page, click on the button for what you’d like to do (either cancel or reschedule). Then, simply follow the on-screen instructions which will walk you through the process, step by step.\n\nAs part of the process, you’ll need to provide the confirmation number you received when you scheduled your exam initially. You can find your confirmation number on the email you received from Prometric when you scheduled your exam. If you do not have your confirmation number, contact our customer service center to find the correct contact details for your location. Information on our customer service phone numbers will be available in your testing organization page on our website.\n\nThe testing centers' primary purpose is to administer exams. Some centers may schedule appointments if you call them directly, however, most will not. Test centers prefer to have all of their appointments scheduled online or through the Prometric Contact Center. It is fast and easy to schedule an exam using Prometric’s website. To begin, start by finding your exam under the test taker menu.\n\nWhen you go to our online registration Web site or speak to a representative from our Contact Center, you will be asked to provide your preferred test date. The first available time slot on that date will be offered to you. If your preferred appointment date is not available, you’ll be able to search for, and identify, an alternative date.\n\nSometimes unforeseen circumstances require a test center to unexpectedly close. Should this happen, we will make every effort to contact so that you don’t show up at the center. We will try contacting you by e-mail and by telephone, so please ensure that the contact information you provide during the scheduling and registration process is accurate.\n\nShould your center unexpectedly close for any reason, you will be contacted by Prometric within 48-72 hours to reschedule your appointment. We apologize for any inconvenience.\n\nIt really depends on the exam. Some exams are only available during select testing windows, and others are offered throughout the year. Depending on the exam, Prometric may administer same-day exams, from Monday through Friday and at times on the weekend if it’s available. Your test sponsor may provide you with specific information for the examination you are trying to schedule.\n\nEffective May 1, 2023, Prometric will allow candidates to bring water into the test room during their exam. No other beverages are permitted. All water must be in a clear or transparent container with a lid or cap. All labels must be removed, and the container will be inspected for notes or other test aids during the security check. The candidate will need to remove the lid/cap for visual inspection by the Test Center staff. Should the container not meet the requirements outlined, the candidate will be required to put it in their locker and will not be allowed to take it into the test room. NOTE: Some test sponsors do NOT allow water in the test room, so please check your test sponsor rules.\n\nWith the implementation of this change, candidates will no longer require testing accommodations for water in the test room. Should a candidate require a non-water beverage, they will require a testing accommodation, but a separate testing room will no longer be required.\n\nWhen you schedule your appointment online or by telephone, you will be asked to provide your method of payment. Provide your voucher number at this time. You may also present the voucher onsite at your local test center.\n\nPrometric vouchers are non-returnable, non-refundable and may only be used for the type of test indicated on the voucher. Terms and conditions of use accompany each voucher order along with the expiration date. Vouchers may not be redeemed after the expiration date.\n\nYou can print your receipt yourself as part of the online scheduling and registration process, at the end of your payment transaction. There are some exams for which you do not pay Prometric directly, but rather you pay the testing organization whose test you are taking. In these cases you must request a receipt from that organization, and not from Prometric.\n\nAlternatively, you can contact us and request a confirmation letter which includes the amount you paid for your exam.\n\nPossibly. Whether or not you receive a refund for your cancelled exam depends on the exam you were scheduled to take, how far in advance you cancel your exam and the rules and procedures surrounding exam cancellation set forth by the organization whose exam it is. Each organization has its own rules surrounding how cancellations and refunds are handled, so please refer to the sponsoring organization for information specific to your exam.\n\nThat depends on the exam you've taken. How scores are reported, and when, is determined by the organization, not by Prometric. Some test takers may be able to see a test completion notice (unofficial scores) at the end of their exam. This is dependent on the type of exam and client. In some cases, the testing organization asks Prometric to send scores to them directly first, and then they send the results to test takers.\n\nFor most exams, you may try the link here to print out your score report upon completion of the exam. Please check with your exam sponsor for complete information.\n\nWhether you are able to take your examination again depends on the test you're taking and the rules set forth by the testing organization. For many certification exams, test takers are permitted to test as many times as they wish, though sometimes there is a mandatory waiting period. If the exam requires that a test taker is \"eligible\", meaning that she/he has met certain pre-requisite criteria, the restrictions around the eligibility will determine whether you can retest. As the rules around retesting are unique to each organization, please check with your exam sponsor for complete information.\n\nPrior to testing, testing accommodations must be approved by the test sponsor before scheduling the appointment. The respective test sponsors will be able to advice on the documentation required to facilitate the Testing Accommodation application and approval. The Testing Accommodations Department can be reached at 1-800-967-1139 if you have any enquiries and a representative will be more than happy to assist you.\n\nIf you have accommodations approved, it will no longer be a regular appointment. The availability on the Prometric system will adjust according to the duration of time the registered exam has stipulated during the registration process. As a result, you will only be able to view dates and locations of test centers that are able to accommodate the total duration and capacity of your test. The Testing Accommodations Department can be reached at 1-800-967-1139."
