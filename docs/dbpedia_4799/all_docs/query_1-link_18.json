        "text": "UD Melilla\n\nI was inspired by the cup draw in real football this year where Melilla, a club based in a Spanish enclave of Morocco drew Real Madrid. In real life they got trounced but I thought I've never managed abroad before so I'd give it a go...\n\nSeason 1\n\nIt's difficult to remember - but we were in the red for about £100k - the wage budget was maxed out so I was just going to have to work with what I had. I recall having practically no wingers or anyone who looked like they would be useful so the seasons hopes hinged on 2 strikers - target man, Yancine Qasmi and on loan poacher Brian Martin - as it so happened, I adopted a 5-3-2 hoof it style of play, which seemed to inadvertently work very well with the ME at the time with Martin able to bag 16 goals that season.\n\nHighlights of the season were going undefeated until the end of January in the league and also drawing Barcelona in Copa Del Rey 4th round - we kept things respectable, 0-2 and somehow managing a 1-1 draw at the Nou Camp - if I recall correctly this put the bank balance at about £0 which was good.\n\nI did find a centre half to join in January, I must have needed 1 with 3 at the back, Ramiro Mayor came in and made 21 appearances for the season getting a 6.80 rating.\n\nOverall we managed to keep a good run of results and finished the season top W19 D14 L5 - although i dont recall it being so tight as 2nd and 3rd both finished 1 point behind...\n\nThis put us through to the playoff thingy and we got Santander - we drew twice, but went through on away goals, we then lost twice to Alcoyano but this was somehow enough to get us promoted (dont ask me why - I've no idea :D)\n\n- I've never done one of these threads before and to be fair it's been ages since I was back in 18/19 in this save, so if there is any interesting stuff people want me to look up, sure but I am recalling a lot of this from memory - I'll try and do a post per season ish recalling the highlights as i look back...\n\nSeason 2\n\nI dont really remember the financial status but I dont think I had much money - I brought in 13 players on frees that summer to bolster the squad for a Segunda challenge, namely:\n\nJuanJo Mateos - a backup right back, i took a chance and he only made 8 appearances before being released. He hadn't played at this level before and it showed\n\nMiki - a backup striker, scored 1 in 10, again didnt quite make it really\n\nXiscu - I remember this dude which is a good sign and it looks like he got 10 assists from the wing on his debut season, must have been ok!\n\nMiguel Gandara - made 41 appearances at centre back, i dont remember him, but sometimes thats a good thing for a centre half, right?\n\nGiorgos Aresti - another player I remember, a cypriot DLP - I thought he was quite good but he is the only player in my transfer list that has already retired (At 30) was released from non league in the UK but happy to come to segunda.\n\nBobby Adekanye - the winger of liverpool reserves fame - i was really pleased to get him but I just couldnt get him producing the goods given his stats look great - more about him later.\n\nAlejandro Marques - I think i tried to sign him on a free, he then went to my parent club (Rayo Vallenco) and i got him on loan, saving a bit of wage budget and he wasnt as good as he looked for me so that probably was a blessing in disguise despite my annoyance at the time\n\nFerran Sarsanedas - released from Barca and brought in to be a BWM - did a decent job, i remember him quite well.\n\nJurgi Oteo - an attack mid that didnt really make an impact\n\nDani Fernandez - a handy full back that could play either flank, handy guy to have\n\nI also signed 3 unattached regens that my scouts recommended later in the year\n\nlooking at my best 11, I think this was the time i embraced Qasmi who was already at the club and managed to change the club to use wingers a bit more - particularly Xiscu.\n\nAlso worth noting my keeper - Dani Barrio, he was already at the club before me and did quite well stepping up a division\n\nLooking at the fixtures we started on an ok path probably winning as much as we were losing - we then managed to draw Real Madrid in the Copa Del Rey 4th round, we lost both legs 0-2, 0-3 and we had a terrible patch in Dec/Jan where we didnt win a single game.\n\ndespite that sounding pretty bad we finished a respectable 12, W13 D15, L 14 on 54 points which wasn't too bad i think.\n\nSeason 3\n\nNow this start to change - I sold 2 players - finally the club has some money!!\n\nJurgi Oteo can't have been that bad as he fetched £750k\n\nalso, Qasmi was a bit old and went for £150k\n\nI brought in a few more guys and now i start to see players i recognise\n\nJaime Seoane - a DLP released from Madrid, he was a massive step up in quality from the club and is still with us\n\nAgus Medina - a quality right back, still with me now albeit at the twilight of his career\n\nMiquel Parera - the opportunity to upgrade the goalie presented itself\n\nAlvaro Bustos - a decent enough winger for Segunda\n\nPol Roige - another winger, i think i really wanted to focus on attack this season\n\nOscar Valentin an all rounder in midfield, i like a fairly robust player but if they can pass as well then great.\n\nCarlton Morris - took a bit of a chance bringing in a striker from Britain but managed to pull off the signing\n\nLuis Rioja - yet another winger\n\nAnder Guevara - quite similar to Valentin, an all round midfielder\n\nThose guys were all freebies - we also used the income to spend our first bit of money on Juan Berrocal, a sturdy centre half to sure things up at the back.\n\nMorris was great and had a 20 goal season,\n\nSeoane was also good chipping in with 10 from midfield\n\nBustos was a superstar getting 16 assists from the wing.\n\nRoige scored 8 and got 6 assists\n\nso a much better showing all round\n\nI dont know the way the sorting works but we finished 2nd this season earning promotion ( W26 D12 L4) - we were tied on 90 points with 1st and 10 points ahead of 3rd which was great!\n\nWe also got our furthest in the cup (partially by merit of an easy 4th round draw) and ended up going out to Sevilla in the 5th round this time.\n\nLa Liga here we come!\n\nSeason 4\n\nOk so I managed to spend £4.5mil this transfer window, a club record seemingly. Here is how that went:\n\nLola Pla - free, a decent enough winger\n\nNacho - A spanish defender who is playing in Holland 2nd division and seemed way to good to be there, got him on a free\n\nMak Varesanovic - an AMC from Milan, broke the wage structure to make sure he came as he is one of those players you need when jumping up to the top div.\n\nAlek Svonja - £750k - a young regen from red star belgrade who has better ability than anyone we currently have.\n\nKristof Szucs - £210k another regen, looked like a up and coming full back but never performed as good as his stats suggested he might which was a shame.\n\nIvan Zabalza - free- literally dont remember this dude at all and he just fell down to my B team apparently\n\nMiguel Angel Herrera - £875k - a decent looking striker regen but only scored 5 in 25\n\nLluis - 1.6mil - a solid centre half still at the club\n\nSergio Akieme - 1.1mil a decent left back, also still with me.\n\nwe sold Giorgio Aresti for a token £45k and also sent a number of players out on loan to reduce the wage budget, not limited to:\n\nXiscu\n\nAdekanye\n\nJuan Carlos Menudo (starts with melilla, one of those players who looks rubbish but over performs to his stats, however Varesanovic is going to take over so he's outta here)\n\nWe also let a few big names go on frees, such as:\n\nDani Barrio, a loyal goalkeeper, left after 6 seasons with us and around 150 appearances.\n\nPepe Romero, a solid wing back who served for the club a similar amount of time but was never la liga quality\n\nRamiro Mayor - starting to get rid of people I'd actually bought in which is a nice sign of progress\n\nIt was a tough season but we finished in a respectable 12th, having W11 D12 L15\n\nwe went out in the 4th round of the cup to Getafe\n\nIt was otherwise an unspectacular season but we cemented a place in la liga which was quite fine.\n\nMost of the signings above appear in team of the year with one person i am yet to mention - a major part of this save has been asking the board for youth upgrades which they have mainly been ok with - I think in the current day I've maxed one of things out but not quite the other, (junior coaching etc) and it is notable that a club grown striker made it into my team of the year - i think I will do a regen spotlight once I've done all the season updates so more on that later\n\nSeason 5\n\nTransfers in:\n\nYago Gandoy, a tough all round midfielder - free\n\nManu Appeh, poacher, £2.7mil - interestingly i got him from Rayo Vallecano who used to be my parent club but got relegated.\n\nJuan Hernandez, decent winger but found his way to Bristol so I think the lure of going back to Spain helped here 1.1mil\n\nAmador - Regen - solid young centre back, still a first team choice £4.1 mil\n\nNezar S'rifi - a creative midfielder from Belgium £1.7mil\n\nGuilie Donoso - yet another winger -£1.5mil\n\nRoberto - a poacher regen, 1.1mil\n\nI also signed 5 regens that looked ok and were free.\n\nOuts:\n\nCarlton Morris - he was struggling a bit and i thought Appeh might take over so cashed in for £700k\n\nLuis Rioja - £25k - just wanted rid of some of the players to make space for the new signings in the squad\n\nManuel Marques - £1.2 mil - this was a regen the scouts found that we brought in for free so the money is starting to be made\n\nAlek Svonja - i got diddled by my naivety when it comes to min. fee release clauses here - PSG nicked him for £2,1 mil\n\nMiguel Angel Herrera also went to PSG for £4mil\n\nI also sent out 10 players on loan, just to clear the books mainly and free up wage money.\n\nThis season I finished 5th so I broke into the Europa league which is great. Overall: W17 D12 L9 so slightly starting to turn a few losses into wins which makes a big difference.\n\nGetafe knocked me out the cup again so nothing exciting to report on that front\n\nI think beating Valencia towards the end of the season was the main highlight of the year in this season :o\n\nSeason 6\n\nIns\n\nMichael Olivera - a great looking left back from Uraguay available on a free - couldnt believe my luck as he just was such an upgrade on Akieme\n\nDiego Pampin - a winger that I managed to pinch away from PSG on a free - still playing for the club\n\nElias Kalbermatten - a great looking striker that had all the attributes of a winger so i got him in to try and retrain him for £9.5mil - i think probably a club record at the time.\n\nJose Manuel Quintero - bit of a gamble, scouts say 5 star potential and only 2.5mil stats all look great but he is injury prone - bit of limited defensive midfielder but worth a punt for £2mil\n\nJairo Gonzalo, a lower potential but more established centre midfielder with a tasty release clause of £1.5mil\n\nRodrigo Menedez - another player the scouts are going mental for and at £675k i think it's worth trying this AMC\n\nMilorad Simic - a great looking winger from Partizan available to european clubs at £1.5mil\n\nMikel Barosain - I spent £7.25mil on a goalie, i think just to help us in europe basically\n\nAs ever a bit more of a clearout , leaving the club was:\n\nBobby Adekanye - frustrating as his stats always looked great but he just never produced - 2 goals in 33 games for the club then 4 loan spells before getting a free\n\nLola Pla - never really made it , only made 7 appearances before going elsewhere\n\nAnder Guevara - I liked this guy but he just wasn't ever Euro quality, left us after 84 games and 8 goals from centre mid and a tasty £600k profit - although with the EU money coming in, seemingly less relevant.\n\nSo a slight improvement in the league - we finished 4th - W22 D6 L10 - the team is certainly establishing themselves in la liga now. The other good news is despite me thinking only 3 teams went into the CL last seasons, this year 4th was good enough so we have got ourselves into the Champions League, hurrah!\n\nCopa Del Rey - we did really well this year getting as far as the semi final before going out to R Madrid 4-6 on agg.\n\nEuropa League - We surprisingly walked the group, beating Milan, Fenerbache and Apollon but went out in the first knockout round to Basel 3-3 on agg. losing on away goals"
