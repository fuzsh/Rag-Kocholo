        "text": "\"The earliest Texans, lived as hunters and gatherers, sharing the landscape with ice age animals including mammoths, cave lions, giant sloths, and dire wolves. Texas has rich remains from the Clovis culture, long believed to be the earliest to spread across North America. Now some scholars believe the story of humans here is even older â€“ dating back 15,000 years or more. Research to find traces of the earliest Texans continues.\" (texasourtexas.texaspbs.org)\n\nNative Americans followed the large Buffalo herds that came to graze on the grasslands, of the ancient dried-up lake that is today the caprock. Some tribes even setting up more permanent camps and farms. The buffalo was extremely important as they hunted it and used all of its body for different resources. The first known exploration of the High Plains was in 1580 when the Spanish came across the area, remarking on the incredibly flat, featureless lands. They brought with them horses that they traded with the tribes. By the 1730s the Spanish had sent more than 30 expeditions into Texas to explore and establish military posts and missions. The French meanwhile had also begun exploring North America and claimed much southeast. In 1803 the US purchased the Louisiana territory. Moses Austin, (whose son Stephen F Austin would eventually lead the Texas Revolution) asked permission from the Spanish Government to help settle the land, they approved and 300 families moved west to settle Texas.\n\nSpanish Exploration of the Great Plains (Photo Credit: nps.gov)\n\nAfter the Civil War, more families moved to Texas looking for new lives, resources, and adventure. The cattle boom along with cheap land prices brought more and more people west to settle the plains of Texas.\n\nLubbock county was formed in august of 1876. Named after Tom S. Lubbock a former Texas Ranger. By 1891, a city government had formed, along with new churches and a jail.

The Llano Estacado is located on the southern end of the Western High Plains an eco-region of the North American Great Plains.

It was named by early Spanish explorers who came through the region in 1541.\n\nThe Llano Estacado Mesa,\n\nPhoto Credit:atpatsplace.blogspot.com\n\nThe Llano Estacado is a flat, featureless grassland. Outside of developed areas, common plants are cacti, mesquite trees, plains cottonwood, and several types of short grasses. The soil, climate, and lack of trees made this area great for agriculture. Due to low precipitation farmers and towns rely primarily on underground water sources, such as the Ogalala aquifer.\n\nAgriculture and Industry\n\nCrops grown on the South Plains include cotton, wheat, sunflowers, peanuts, sorghum, grapes (for wine), and corn.\n\nMajor Industries include health care, agriculture, education, manufacturing, and research.\n\nCotton Crops in West Texas (Photo Credit: dallasnews.com)\n\nLubbock has a semi-arid climate with hot summers and mild winters.
