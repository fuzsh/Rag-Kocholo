        "text": "The first week of August saw the return of triple digit temperatures to much of the region as the summer heat dome reappeared, bringing with it some of the hottest temperatures so far this summer. Some people refer this current stretch of hot weather as the “dog days of summer”. Whatever you call it, the very hot temperatures unfortunately won’t be going away anytime soon as the heat dome continues to dominate the weather pattern.\n\nDespite the heat dome hanging tough, some slight changes in the weather will be possible across the region Friday afternoon and again Saturday afternoon as a very weak cold front sags to the south out of North Texas. This front, combined with an area of moisture spreading in from the northeast, will cause a slight chance for the development of scattered showers and thunderstorms across the region Friday afternoon through Friday evening. The probability for rain at any given location will be 20 percent. Should thunderstorms develop, the main weather threat will be the possibility for strong downburst winds, with gusts to around 50 mph. Some of the storms may also produce a few pockets of moderate to heavy rain. For locations that do happen to see rain, totals are predicted to average between 0.25 and 0.5 inches. The chance for rain is forecast to diminish shortly after sunset.\n\nAside from this slight chance for rain, Friday’s weather is looking to be mostly sunny and hot, with high temperatures around 98-101 degrees.\n\nLittle change in pattern is forecast for Saturday as the cold front stalls along a line roughly stretching from San Angelo, to Austin, to Houston. There will be a 20 percent chance for scattered afternoon and evening rain showers and thunderstorms across the region. And once again, strong downburst winds, with gusts to around 50 mph with be possible from some of the thunderstorms. Rain amounts, if any, should total around a quarter inch, or less. High temperatures are forecast to be near 98-100 degrees. The chance for rain will diminish Saturday evening as temperatures cool.\n\nIt’ll be back to sunny, very hot, and dry weather Sunday as the weak cold front dissipates and the heat dome grows a bit stronger. In fact, computer forecast solutions call for the heat dome to remain over the south central U.S. all of next week and next weekend. With the heat dome firmly in place, sunny and dry weather looks to continue all of next week. Along with the sunshine, dangerous heat will also persist, with more triple digit temperatures.\n\nSunday through Friday, daily high temperatures are forecast to be near 98-102 degrees across the Hill Country and Central Texas regions, and in the upper 90s across the coastal plains.\n\nFactoring in the relative humidity, daily peak heat index readings are predicted to be in the range of 105 and 110 degrees. These readings will likely reach or exceed the criteria for heat advisories.\n\nLooking out into next weekend and the week of August 19th, the computer forecast solution show few changes in the current hot and dry pattern as the heat dome continues across the area. No significant rain is forecast and high temperatures look to stay close to 100 degrees.\n\nTropical Weather Outlook\n\nThe strong tropical wave over the eastern Caribbean Sea which had been was forecast to spread into the southern Gulf of Mexico this weekend dissipated a couple of days ago and no further development is expected.\n\nNational Hurricane Center forecasters are closely monitoring a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms located over the central tropical Atlantic, well to the west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands. This activity is associated with a strong tropical wave. According to the Hurricane Center, any development of the wave should be slow to occur during the next couple of days while it moves westward to west-northwestward across the central tropical Atlantic. However, conditions are expected to become more conducive for development thereafter, and a tropical depression could form by early next week while the system approaches and then moves near or over the Lesser Antilles. The system is forecast to continue moving generally west-northwestward and could approach portions of the Greater Antilles by the middle part of next week. NHC forecasters are giving this system a 60 percent chance for tropical development over the next seven days.\n\nMost of the ensemble forecast solutions call for the system to bend to the north early next week, keeping the system away from the Gulf of Mexico. However, it is way too early to have strong confidence in this prediction.\n\nElsewhere, the tropical Atlantic is mostly quiet.\n\nThe Perseid Meteor Shower will Peak this Weekend\n\nOne of the best meteor showers of the year, the Perseid meteor shower, should reach its peak during the overnight hours of late Sunday night into early Monday morning (Aug. 11-12). So the mornings of August 11 and 12 are probably your best bet to see the show. August 13 might be good as well, but be aware that the Perseids tend to fall off rapidly after their peak. This year, there will be almost no moon, making the late-night sky nice and dark for shooting star spectators and counters. Some Perseids do appear during the evening, but the shower is always better from about midnight until the dawn’s early light.\n\nThe shower rises to a peak gradually, then falls off rapidly. And Perseid meteors tend to strengthen in number as late night deepens into the wee hours before dawn. The shower is often best just before dawn.\n\nDuring those after-midnight hours the shower’s radiant point (the point from which it appears to originate), located between the Perseus constellation and the ‘W’ of Cassiopeia, will be getting progressively higher in the northeast — so meteors should flash across all parts of the sky at a rate of about one every minute or two (as seen by a single observer).\n\nHave a great weekend and stay cool!\n\nBob\n\nThe focus of the weather this week will be on the heat. We are firmly in what is typically the hottest point of summer in Central and South Texas, and this week’s weather will definitely live up to that billing. Our nemesis, the dreaded heat dome, is forecast to gain greater influence on our weather throughout the week, likely leading to several consecutive days with triple digit temperatures.\n\nAfter contracting westward over the weekend, the heat dome is now spreading back across Texas. Forecasts call for the center of the heat dome to set up across the southern Plains and northern Texas mid-week and remain over the area through at least Saturday. Sinking air under the heat dome is expected to cause a very stable atmosphere, abundant sunshine, and rain-free conditions throughout the week.\n\nIt’s going to be hot all week, but the hottest temperatures are predicted to occur Wednesday through Saturday as center of the heat dome gets closer to our area.\n\nHigh temperatures Monday and Tuesday are forecast to generally be near 98 to 100 degrees across the Hill Country and Central Texas regions, and in the mid-90s across the coastal plains\n\nHigh temperatures Wednesday through Saturday are forecast to generally be near 100-103 degrees across the Hill Country and Central Texas regions, and in the upper 90s across the coastal plains\n\nFactoring in the humidity, peak heat index values Monday and Tuesday are forecast to be up to 106 degrees across Central Texas and the coastal regions. For Wednesday through Saturday, peak heat index readings are forecast to be up to 108 degrees across Central Texas, and up to 110 degrees across the coastal plains. Because of the forecast high heat index readings, the National Weather Service states they will likely be issuing Heat Advisories for parts of the area throughout the week.\n\nAbundant sunshine and light winds will also result in high Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) values. WBGT is a measure of the heat stress in direct sunlight and takes into account the temperature, humidity, wind speed, sun angle, and incoming radiation (i.e. cloud cover). Conditions this week are favorable for high to extreme WBGT risk, or values that are high enough to stress even the most active populations (i.e. those used to working or exercising outdoors) due to the high temperatures, abundant sunshine, and light winds. It will be particularly important for those who work outdoors to practice heat safety this week. Avoid any unnecessary outdoor activities during the peak heating of the day and remain hydrated.\n\nLooking out further, Monday’s forecast solutions are showing modest support for a possible backdoor cold front to sink south into portions of North and East-Central Texas Sunday, as the center of the heat dome shifts further to the northwest. The front could possibly help generate a few rain showers across the northern half of the region next Sunday and Monday. As of now, no widespread or heavy rain is anticipated.\n\nNext week, forecasts call for the heat dome to weaken slightly while it continues to hang out over the central and southern Plains. For our region, the sunny, dry, and hot weather looks to continue. Daily high temperatures are predicted to stay close to 100 degrees throughout the week.\n\nNote that weather from the tropics could possibly influence on our region at some point next week. See the tropical weather section below.\n\nTropical Weather Outlook\n\nTropical Storm Debby:\n\nHurricane Debby made landfall along the Florida Big Bend coast, near Steinhatchee, around 7 am CDT this morning. Maximum sustained winds at the time were near 80 mph.\n\nAs of 1 pm, Debbie has weakened to a tropical storms and was inland and centered about 10 miles northwest of Live Oak, Florida. Peak winds were down to 65 mph. Debby is expected to produce rainfall totals of 6 to 12 inches, with maximum amounts of 18 inches, across portions of central and northern Florida as well as central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning. This rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with significant river flooding expected.\n\nDisturbed Weather Near the Windward Islands\n\nNational Hurricane Center forecasters are closely monitoring an area of showers and thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave located near the Windward Island. Any development of this system should be slow to occur during the next couple of days while the system moves westward over the eastern Caribbean Sea. However, environmental conditions are expected to become more conducive for development later this week as the system moves across the western Caribbean Sea or the southern Gulf of Mexico.\n\nNHC is currently giving this system a 30 percent chance for tropical development over the next seven days.\n\nEnsemble forecasts from the GFS, ECMWF, and Canadian models all show some degree of development with this feature either in the western Caribbean Sea or southern Gulf of Mexico this weekend. The NHC’s 7-day tropical weather outlook calls for the system reach the Bay of Campeche by about next Sunday. Right now, it’s too early to tell where this potential tropical system will make landfall. I urge everyone to keep monitor the progress of this disturbance over the next few days.\n\nBob\n\nThe month of July spoiled us, with below normal temperatures and above normal rainfall. For most of the region, the temperature averaged around 1 degree below normal and rainfall totaled at least 2-3 inches above normal. Rainfall at many locations was 5-8 inches above normal. Not bad for what is typically the driest and second hottest month of summer.\n\nAugust is here and unfortunately, there are no traces left of that tolerable July pattern. The heat dome, which had vacated to the west and east of Texas for most of July has made an unwelcome return. Friday’s analysis showed the heat dome stretching from the Pacific Northwest, to the southern Gulf of Mexico. The dome was centered over western Colorado. Forecasts call for the heat dome to retreat a little further to the west this weekend, then expand east to cover all Texas beginning early next week. With the heat dome now the dominant weather feature going forward, we’re looking an extended stretch of hot and most dry weather. (which is very typical of the month of August)\n\nFriday’s weather is expected to be sunny and hot. High temperatures are forecast to range from 100-102 degrees across the Hill Country, to 98-100 degrees across Central Texas, to the mid-90s across the coastal plains.\n\nThis weekend’s weather will include a slight chance for a few scattered rain showers and isolated thunderstorms as weak cold front pushes south and stalls across North Central Texas. This boundary is expected to be the focus for the development of scattered rain showers across North Texas Saturday afternoon. Some of these showers are expected to drift south into the northern counties of the Hill Country and Central Texas late Saturday afternoon and evening. The probability for rain will only be 20 percent. There will be a slight chance for rain showers and isolated thunderstorms across the entire region Sunday afternoon as the boundary sags a little further to the south. Again, the chance for rain will only be 20 percent. Some of the stronger storms could produce wind gusts of 40 mph. For areas that do happen to see any rain, amounts are predicted to stay below a quarter inch, with isolated totals to near 1 inch.\n\nWeekend temperatures will feature dangerous heat, with Saturday expected to be the hottest of the two days. Peak heat indices are forecast to be near 108-111 degrees Saturday, and near 103-106 degrees Sunday.\n\nHighs Saturday are forecast to be near 100-102 degrees across the Hill Country and Central Texas, with upper 90s across the coastal plains\n\nHighs Sunday are forecast to be near 98-100 degrees across the Hill country and Central Texas regions, and in the mid-90s across the coastal plains\n\nThe outlook for next week calls for sunny, dry, and continued hot weather as the heat dome spreads back across Texas. Daily high temperatures are predicted to be near 98-101 degrees across the Hill Country and Central Texas regions, and in the mid to upper 90s across the coastal plains. Forecasts show similar hot and dry conditions continuing through the middle of the month.\n\nFrom a climate perspective, the next two weeks are typically the peak of summer temperatures, with readings showing a slow decline during the second half of August. Let’s hope this pattern comes true this year.\n\nTropical Weather Outlook\n\nPotential Cyclone Four\n\nSatellite imagery and surface observations indicate the tropical wave the National Hurricane Center has been monitoring for the last several days is now over southeastern Cuba, with disorganized convective bands to the north and south of a broad low pressure area. Given the potential for development once the system moves over water on Saturday, advisories have been initiated for Potential Tropical Cyclone Four.\n\nAs of 1 pm CDT, the strong tropical wave was centered about 360 miles southeast of Key West, Florida. The system was moving toward the west-northwest near 16 mph . A turn toward the northwest at a slower forward speed is expected Friday night and Saturday, followed by a turn toward the north on Sunday. On the forecast track, the disturbance is expected to move over Cuba Friday afternoon, cross the Straits of Florida on Saturday, and then move near or over the west coast of Florida as a tropical storm Saturday night through Sunday night.\n\nMaximum sustained winds were near 30 mph with higher gusts. The disturbance is expected to develop into a tropical depression on Saturday as it moves across the Straits of Florida, followed by intensification into a tropical storm by Saturday night.\n\nBased on the latest forecasts, this system poses no threat to the western Gulf or the coast of Texas.\n\nNOAA/Colorado State University/RAMMB 08/02/2024 1:20 pm CDT\n\nElsewhere across the tropical Atlantic, conditions are quiet. There are no systems in place which pose a threat for tropical development through late next week.\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nBob\n\nWhat a week it’s been with the weather! The rainy pattern which started last Monday, hung around all the way through Sunday. Looking back at rain totals over the past week from LCRA’s Hydromet, the highest totals occurred across Wharton, Matagorda, Kimble, and Edwards Counties, were 7 to nearly 10 inches of rain were recorded. Much of Central Texas received between 2 and 5 inches, while totals across the northern Hill Country varied between a tenth of an inch, and nearly 5 inches!\n\nUnfortunately, the pattern which caused the rain and more tolerable temperatures has come to an end. Monday’s weather maps showed the trough of low pressure which had been in place across Texas all of last week has been replaced by a strengthening ridge of high pressure, or heat dome. The heat dome is currently centered over the central Gulf of Mexico. Forecasts call for the center of the heat dome to spread to the northwest this week, moving across East Texas mid-week, arriving across the central and southern Rockies this weekend. A sunny to mostly sunny sky can be expected throughout the week.\n\nAs the heat dome spreads over Central and South Texas, the chances for additional rain will decrease dramatically. While a couple of spotty rain showers will be possible for coastal locations this afternoon and again Tuesday afternoon, dry conditions are forecast region-wide through Saturday.\n\nWith few clouds and no rain, temperatures will trend warmer this week, continuing into the weekend.\n\nHigh temperatures Monday and Tuesday are forecast to be in the mid-90s across the Hill Country and Central Texas regions, and in the low 90s across the coastal plains\n\nHigh temperatures Wednesday through Saturday are forecast to be in the upper 90s to 100 degrees across the Hill Country and Central Texas regions, while lower 90s should continue across the coastal plains\n\nHigh relative humidity levels are expected throughout the week, causing peak heat index readings of 103-109 degrees each day.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday and next week, forecasts call for the center of the heat dome to shift a little further to the north, away from Texas. This more northern position away from Central Texas may open the door for a few spotty afternoon rain showers across the region next week next week. But note that widespread or heavy rain is not expected. High temperatures are forecast to generally be in the upper 90s, possibly trending down a couple degrees the second half of the week.\n\nTropical Weather Outlook\n\nNational Hurricane Center forecasters are keeping a close watch on an area of disturbed weather located over the central tropical Atlantic Ocean. This system is expected interact with an approaching tropical wave during the next day or two. Environmental conditions are forecast to become conducive for gradual development thereafter, and a tropical depression could form late this week while the system is in the vicinity of the Greater Antilles or the Bahamas.\n\nNHC forecasters are giving this system a medium chance (a 50 percent chance) for tropical development over the next seven days.\n\nElsewhere, weather conditions are quiet and tropical development is not expected over the next seven days.\n\nSaharan Dust Arriving Monday Evening\n\nA plume of Saharan dust is predicted to reach the region Monday evening and remain over the area through late week. The dust is expected to cause an increase in fine particulate levels and result in a hazy-looking sky throughout the week.\n\nHave a good week!\n\nBob\n\nThis week has provided a nice break from the typical weather we normally see in late July. Last year at this time, Austin was in the middle of a 45-day streak of consecutive triple digit temperatures that didn’t break until August 22nd. To make matters worse, only 0.01 inches of rain was recorded during this 45-day stretch. This July, rainfall is averaging above normal at all locations.\n\nThis week’s unusual pattern of less hot weather and scattered rains is expected to continue through Sunday. A trough of low pressure in the middle and upper atmosphere currently stretching from southwest Texas, to the Ohio Valley is forecast to remain stalled over the area through Sunday. Rising air on the eastern side of the trough is expected to cause the development of scattered showers and thunderstorms—mainly in the late morning trough evening periods. The most favorable area for widespread rain and thunderstorm development is predicted to be across the middle and upper Texas coast, extending inland to around Intestate 10. Isolated to scattered rain showers and thunderstorms are forecast across Central Texas and the eastern counties of the Hill Country.\n\nThe probability for rain Friday afternoon, Saturday, and Sunday will be near 30 percent across the eastern Hill Country. Across Central Texas, the probability for rain will be near 40-50 percent. For the middle Texas coast, the probability for rain will be at 70 percent.\n\nDaily rain amounts should average well below a quarter inch across the eastern Hill Country, and close to a quarter inch across Central Texas. Across the middle Texas coast, daily rain amounts of 0.5 to 1 inch are forecast, with isolated higher totals of 2-3 inches.\n\nCumulative rain amounts through Monday evening are forecast to average around a quarter inch or less across the eastern Hill Country, be between 0.25 and 1.5 inches across Central Texas, and total between 1.5 and 2 inches across the middle Texas coast. Isolated heavier totals to near 5 inches will be possible.\n\nNWS Rainfall Forecast Valid through 7 pm Monday:\n\nPlenty of clouds under the broad upper trough will help to keep afternoon temperatures below seasonal normals through the weekend. (Normal high temperatures for late July are in the upper 90s). Daily high temperatures are forecast to be near 88-90 degrees across the Hill Country and Central Texas. For the coastal plains, highs are forecast to be in the low and mid-80s. Unfortunately, it will still feel hot thanks to the high humidity levels and relatively light winds.\n\nThe outlook for next week calls for a return to more typical late July/early August weather conditions as the stalled upper trough over Texas finally lifts off to the northeast. In it’s place, the large heat dome over the western U.S. is predicted to spread back across Texas. Fortunately, the center of the heat dome is forecast to remain over the Four Corners region and not spread over Texas. Mostly sunny, dry and warmer weather is forecast throughout the week.\n\nHigh temperatures Monday and Tuesday are forecast to be in the low to mid-90s across the Hill Country and Central Texas regions, and in the low 90s towards the coast\n\nHigh temperatures Wednesday through next weekend are forecast to be in the mid to upper 90s across the Hill Country and Central Texas regions, but remain in the low 90s across the coastal plains\n\nLong-range forecasts hint the next chance for rain will take shape the week of August 5th, when the heat dome shifts away from Texas and back to the western U.S.\n\nTropical Weather Outlook\n\nNational Hurricane Center forecasters are monitoring an area of disturbed weather located over the central tropical Atlantic Ocean. The clouds and showers are expected to interact with an approaching tropical wave during the next several days. Some tropical development of this system will be possible while it approaches the Lesser Antilles during the early to middle part of next week. The system is forecast to move generally west-northwestward near the Greater Antilles toward the latter part of next week.\n\nAs of now, NHC forecasters are giving this system just a low chance (20 percent chance) for tropical development over the next seven days.\n\nCatch a View of the ISS this Weekend and Next Week\n\nThere will be several opportunities to see the International Space Station travel across our sky over the next few evenings. The best one looks to be Sunday evening, when the station will reach a point 68 degrees above the northern horizon. In the Austin area, that particular pass will occur at 10:13 pm.\n\nYou can find out more specifics about the upcoming passes from NASA’s website Spot The Station | NASA Just input your city and click on the big blue marker to get all of the details.\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nBob\n\nRain showers and scattered thunderstorms have continued across the region today, although areal coverage has been less than the past couple of days. As of 2 pm, LCRA’s Hydromet showed the showers have produced spotty totals of 1-2 inches across parts of Central Texas. Heavier and more concentrated rains have fallen across the middle Texas coast, producing totals of 1-3 inches across Wharton and Matagorda Counties.\n\nThursday’s analysis showed a trough of low pressure in the upper atmosphere stretching from the southern Great Lakes to Southwestern Texas, causing a moist and unstable atmosphere across the eastern half of Texas. It’s interesting to note a weak area of low pressure in the lower atmosphere developed across south central Texas Thursday morning. The circulation around this low helped pull tropical moisture inland to Central Texas and the eastern Hill Country. The counterclockwise circulation around this low is expected to cause a 40-50 percent chance for additional rain showers and thunderstorms for the eastern Hill Country, Central Texas, and the middle Texas coast Thursday afternoon into Thursday evening.\n\nWhile a decrease in shower activity is forecast this evening, high resolution forecasts call for more showers and scattered thunderstorms to develop after midnight for areas along and east of Interstate 35. The rain is forecast to continue into Friday morning. While not a certainty, the model solutions have been fairly consistent in calling for this rain development.\n\nFriday afternoon through Sunday, a chance for mainly afternoon and evening showers and thunderstorms looks to continue for the eastern Hill County, Central Texas, and coastal region as the trough of low pressure remains in place across the region. The chance for rain will range from 30 percent across the eastern Hill Country, to near 40-50 percent across Central Texas, to 70-80 percent across the coastal plains. The rain is expected to be heaviest across the coastal region, with lighter amounts expected further inland. Daily rain amounts are forecast to range from around 1 inch across the coastal plains, to around a quarter inch across the Austin/Interstate 35 corridor.\n\nThe Weather Prediction’s Rainfall forecast, for the period Friday through Sunday, calls for cumulative totals of 2-3 inches across the middle Texas coast, 0.5 to 1.25 inches across Central Texas, and around a quarter inch or less across the Hill Country.\n\nNWS Rainfall Forecast Valid through 7 am Monday:\n\nGenerally dry and warmer weather is forecast beginning Monday as the western heat dome spreads east to cover most of Texas. High temperatures are forecast to return to the mid and upper 90s. Interestingly, today’s forecasts indicate the heat dome may begin to shift back to the west and northwest next weekend, which could open the door for some additional unsettled weather. Stay tuned.\n\nBob\n\nThe wet and unsettled weather pattern continues. Monday night into Tuesday morning, moderate to heavy rain developed and persisted across the Edwards Plateau and parts of the Hill Country. Widespread totals of 4-8 inches fell over the area from west of Rocksprings, to Kerrville, to Junction, to west of Rocksprings. Within this area, a couple of isolated totals of 9-10 inches were observed. Totals of 2-4 inches fell across parts of Mason and Gillespie Counties. Across much of the eastern Hill Country and the Austin/Interstate 35 corridor, totals ranged between 1 and 2.5 inches Very low totals have been recorded so far across the middle Texas coast.\n\nTuesday’s analysis continued to show an unusual trough of low pressure stretching from the Great Lakes to Far West Texas. Small, slow-moving waves of low pressure moving through the large trough, taking advantage of the very moist airmass, have helped to produce the recent period of moderate to heavy rain. Tuesday’s data indicates the broad trough is sagging slowly to the southeast, and this is expected to shift the focus for heavy rain over the next few days mainly to areas along and east of Interstate 35, rather than the Hill Country.\n\nFor Tuesday afternoon and Tuesday night, periods of rain showers and scattered thunderstorms look to continue across the eastern half of the Hill Country, Central Texas, and the middle Texas coast. Some of the rain showers will be slow movers, capable of producing large amounts of rain in short periods of time. Rain amounts between Tuesday afternoon and sunrise Wednesday are forecast to generally average between 0.5 and 1 inch, with isolated totals of 3-4 inches possible.\n\nWednesday through Sunday, the trough is predicted to remain nearly stationary across Central Texas. As a result, a good chance for scattered rains is expected to continue to across the entire region, with the most favorable area for rain occurring for areas along and east of Interstate 35. The probability for rain will range from 30-40 percent across the Hill Country, to near 40-50 percent across Central Texas, to near 80 percent across the coastal plains.\n\nDaily rain amounts across the Hill Country are forecast to average near or less than a quarter inch. For Central Texas, daily rain amounts are forecast to average between a quarter and a half inch, with isolated totals of 1-2 inches possible. For the middle Texas coast, daily rain amounts are forecast to average between 0.5 and 1 inch, with isolated totals of 2-4 inches possible.\n\nThe Weather Prediction Center’s rainfall forecast for the next seven days calls for totals of 0.25 to 1 inch across the Hill Country, 1-2 inches across Central Texas, and 3-5 inches across the coastal plains.\n\nNWS Rainfall Forecast for the Period 7 pm Tuesday through 7 pm Next Tuesday:\n\nWith soils becoming more saturated from previous days rains, flash flooding may become more of a threat over the next few days. This will be in addition to the urban and small stream type flooding.\n\nThe outlook for next week calls for a slight chance for rain Monday, with mostly sunny and dry weather for the balance of the week. High temperatures are forecast to be in the low and mid-90s.\n\nBob\n\nOur weather looks to be rather unsettled this week thanks to a broad trough of low pressure which has developed and currently stretches from West Texas, to the Middle Mississippi Valley region. Typically in late July, the heat dome covers most of Texas. But recently, the heat dome split, with one dome now covering the western U.S., and the other dome covering the southeastern U.S. This unusual pattern is forecast to persist all week and through the upcoming weekend. Next week, the heat dome is forecast to spread back close to Texas.\n\nOver the next several days, waves of low pressure are forecast to move trough the broad trough and track east across Central and South Texas, causing periods of rain showers and thunderstorms across the region. Monday’s data suggests the most favorable area for rain will slowly begin to shift away from the Hill Country mid-week as the broad trough shifts east out of West Texas. Meanwhile, a good chance for rain showers and thunderstorms is expected to continue across Central and Southeast Texas throughout the week and into the weekend. Towards the coast, a very tropical air has developed and has been instrumental in the development of moderate to heavy rain across parts of the coastal region over the past couple of days. A similar pattern is expected to continue for the next few days.\n\nIt should be noted a very moist air mass has spread inland from the Gulf of Mexico to cover most of the region. This very moist air mass, combined with the slow and erratic movement of the storms, means there will be a potential for any of the storms to produce high totals of rain in a relatively short period of time. Most of this week’s rain and storms is expected to occur during the day and into the evening hours as temperatures warm modestly.\n\nForecasts show a 70-80 percent chance for rain showers and scattered thunderstorms across the entire region Monday afternoon and again on Tuesday. Beginning Wednesday, the probability for rain and storms across the Hill Country and northern counties of Central Texas looks to decrease slightly to 40-50 percent and continue there through the weekend. For the eastern half of Central Texas and the middle Texas coast, the probability for rain will remain near 70-80 percent through the upcoming weekend.\n\nThe Weather Prediction Center’s rainfall forecast for the next seven days calls for the highest cumulative totals of rain to occur along and south of a line stretching from Hondo, to Austin, to College Station. For these locations, totals of 2-4 inches, with isolated higher totals are predicted. Areas south of Interstate 10 could see totals of 3-5 inches. For the Hill Country, totals will range from 0.5 to 1 inch across the north, to the 1-2 inches across the southern and eastern areas.\n\nNWS Rainfall Forecast for the Period 7 pm Monday through 7 pm Next Monday:\n\nDrier, but not completely dry, and warmer conditions are forecast next week.\n\nTropical Weather Outlook\n\nQuite weather conditions continue across the tropical Atlantic and tropical cyclone development is not expected for at least the next seven days.\n\nBob\n\nAn unusual July weather pattern is taking shape, with heat domes now situated across the western and southeastern U.S. and a rare cold front draped across Central and South Texas. This unusual pattern is forecast to strengthen next week, and is expected to bring a week-long wet weather pattern to much of Texas.\n\nAs of late Friday morning, the cold front stretched from Houston, to San Antonio, to near Ozona. Slightly drier and slightly cooler air was noted behind the cold front. The front is forecast to sag south to the middle Texas coast Friday evening and stall over that general area through Saturday . The front is then predicted to return back to the north on Sunday. With drier and somewhat more stable atmospheric conditions expected behind the cold front, no rain is forecast across the Hill Country or Central Texas regions through Sunday morning. For areas near and to the south of Interstate 10, there will a 40 percent chance for scattered rain showers and thunderstorms across the area this afternoon and again Saturday afternoon. Rain amounts through Saturday evening are forecast to average around a half inch, with isolated totals of 1-2 inches possible.\n\nDespite the “cold” front, high temperatures Friday and Saturday are predicted to generally be in the mid to upper 90s. Low 90s are forecast for the coastal region.\n\nSignificant moisture looks to return off the Gulf of Mexico to the eastern half of Texas beginning Sunday afternoon. As a result, there will be a 30-40 percent chance for scattered rain showers and thunderstorms across the region Sunday afternoon into Sunday evening. Rain amounts of 0.25 to 0.5 inches can be expected. Sunday’s weather will; include a partly to mostly cloudy sky.\n\nA change to a wet and unsettled weather pattern is forecast to begin Sunday afternoon into Sunday night when a trough of low pressure situated between the two heat domes builds south into West Texas out of the southern Plains states. Waves of low pressure are predicted to move through the broad trough and track east across Texas next week, with each trough expected to kick off showers and thunderstorms. The unusual trough is forecast to remain in place across West Texas through late next week, and is expected to keep the wet pattern going through next Friday.\n\nForecast solutions are showing the first wave of low pressure to spread east out of West Texas late Sunday into Monday. Showers and scattered thunderstorms are forecast to increase across the region Monday morning, followed by a fairly widespread coverage of rain Monday afternoon into Monday evening. The probability for rain will be near 70-80 percent. Rainfall forecast for Monday call indicate widespread totals of 1-1.5 inches will be possible.\n\nA second wave of low pressure is forecast to spread across the region Tuesday, bringing more widespread moderate to heavy rain to the region. The probability for rain will again be near 70-80 percent. Rain amounts Tuesday are predicted to average around 1 inch.\n\nForecasts call for additional waves of low pressure to move across the area next Wednesday into Friday. With a very moist air mass in place, additional periods of moderate to occasionally heavy rain is forecast. There are some signs the rain may trend down a bit in intensity and coverage next Thursday and Friday. The chance for rain is forecast to decrease by next weekend as the stalled trough of low pressure finally exits to the northeast.\n\nNote that next week’s rains are expected to be slow-moving efficient rain producers and will be capable of producing large amounts of rain in a short period of time. The Weather Prediction Center’s 7-day rainfall forecast, valid through 7 pm next Friday, calls for widespread totals of 2-4 inches, with isolated totals of 4-6 inches possible.\n\nNWS Rainfall Forecast Valid through Next Friday at 7 pm:\n\nNext week’s pattern will feature considerable clouds, periods of rain, and lower temperatures. High temperatures Monday through Friday are forecast to generally be around 88-90 degrees.\n\nLooking out to next weekend and the week of July 29th, a drier and warmer pattern is forecast as the western heat dome shifts closer to Texas. High temperatures are forecast to generally be in the mid to upper 90s.\n\nTropical Weather Outlook\n\nWeather conditions are very quiet across the tropical Atlantic and they are expected to remain that way for at least the next seven days.\n\nNOAA/Colorado State University/RAMMB 07-19-24 1:10 pm\n\nThe July Full Moon\n\nDon’t miss the Full Buck Moon this weekend. Technically, the moon will be full Sunday morning at 5:17 am CDT. This means we will be treated to a full-looking moon Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights. By the way, July’s full Moon is traditionally called the “Buck Moon” due to the fact that deer antlers are seen around this time of year in North America.\n\nHave a good weekend!\n\nBob"
