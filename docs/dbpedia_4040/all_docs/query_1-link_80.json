        "text": "Instead of using humidity directly we use dew point to measure what people commonly mean when saying it feels humid. Dew point is classified into 4 categories: Dry (under 25°F), Comfortable (25°F to 60°F), Muggy (60°F to 70°F) and Oppressive (70°F or greater). The table below shows the percentage of days with a dew point within a particular class.\n\nJanFebMarAprMayJunDry2.32.30.00.00.00.6Comfortable77.959.944.323.58.63.9Muggy19.836.853.557.932.020.5Oppressive0.01.02.218.659.575.0\n\nJulAugSepOctNovDecDry2.71.30.20.00.31.6Comfortable3.34.24.422.851.463.3Muggy10.417.421.645.341.532.6Oppressive83.777.273.832.06.92.5\n\nThe table below shows the distribution of average wind speeds in miles per hour for a given month or day.
