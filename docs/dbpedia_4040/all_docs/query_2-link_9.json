        "text": "Texas was divided into two areas when it came to temperature for the month of March. Areas in South and extreme West Texas were barely above normal in their daily mean temperatures while areas in the Panhandle and North Texas experienced slightly below temperatures. The range of temperature departures from normal throughout the state was quite small however, with all first-order stations falling between -1.2°F and +3.3°F for their respective departures. El Paso was the only station to receive below normal precipitation for the month. The 18 other first-order stations throughout Texas all received more precipitation for March than is normally expected.\n\nThe first few days of March saw extremely warm temperatures across Texas. The high temperature reached 93°F in Del Rio on the 1st, while Corpus Christi shattered the record high temperature on the 2nd when the mercury rose to an unbearable 98°F. From the 7th to the 13th mostly dry weather persisted across extreme Southern and Western Texas. The 8th however did see strong storms over the eastern half of the Lone Star state. Dallas and Fort Worth were just two of the many areas that experienced flooding as the storms passed over the region.\n\nTwo squall lines also passed over Central and Eastern Texas on the 12th and 19th. As the storms went by there were numerous reports of hail and wind damage along with reports of possible tornadoes in the affected counties. Little or no rain fell, however, across extreme southern Texas, where spring planting was being delayed because of the excessive dryness.\n\nFinally as March drew to a close, the much-needed rain (2.00\" to 4.00\") fell on extreme Southern Texas. On Saturday the 27th, a vigorous low-pressure system moving east across Northern Mexico generated torrential rains across South Texas. Corpus Christi, Del Rio, and Laredo all broke their daily record rainfall amounts when each city measured 2.07\", 1.64\", and 1.97\" respectively. San Antonio's rainfall total (1.44\") was their highest single-day total since October 18, 1998. 2.51\" of rain were reported at Brownsville on the 28th which wound up being their third-wettest March day on record.\n\nMonthly Summary for Selected Cities\n\nTMAX (°F) TMIN (°F) TAVG (°F) PRCP *Deg.
