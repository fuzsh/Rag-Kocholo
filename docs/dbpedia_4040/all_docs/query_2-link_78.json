        "text": "I'm looking to call in a turkey this year. In the past, I just went when I could go and sometimes they called well and other times, not so much. Based on the rainfall, moonphase and other factors, when should I plan to hunt. Season is Mar 17- Apr 29.\n\nThanks for your input!\n\nIt is all timing like the rut. If you catch them too late they are usually hen'd up and can get quite. I always like going first weekend. That march 17 date is early but I would take it or the next weekend before taking the last weekend.\n\nI do not pay close attention to moon phase, rainfall etc when spring turkey hunting. Good luck.\n\nIMHO the seasons have been late the last couple of years....go early, by April many of the hens have been serviced...best way to find out is go the week prior to the season, and if you hear the toms talking already its on..YMMV\n\nEarlier the better especially for calling. The best time would be the first two weekends in March. The birds are very vocal then. To bad the season doesn't coincide."
