        "text": "SUMMARY\n\nTexas produces approximately 90 000 hl of wine annually from more than 200 wineries and 1214 ha of vineyards. Eight wine grape production regions are officially recognized as American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) in Texas. Improved understanding of the growing conditions within each AVA facilitates selection of well-adapted cultivars that is critical for continued success and expansion of the wine industry. A geographic information system (GIS) was developed to enable enhanced characterization of the climatic, geologic and edaphic conditions of Texas AVAs. The GIS contains datasets describing climatic variables, geology, soils, elevation and topography, all of significance to grape production. This paper characterizes the four viticultural areas (AVAs) of west Texas: Texas High Plains AVA, Escondido Valley AVA, Texas Davis Mountains AVA, and Mesilla Valley AVA. Common features of the four AVAs are relatively high elevation, warm to very warm growing-season temperatures, mild winter temperatures, and low annual precipitation. Local differences in elevation and topography modify climatic conditions among AVAs, providing variations in growing degree-days and ripening-period mean temperatures that influence the performance of grape cultivars. The Texas High Plains and Texas Davis Mountains AVAs have the lowest growing degree-days and coolest ripening-period mean temperatures; Escondido Valley and Mesilla Valley AVAs are drier and warmer, resulting in fruit ripening earlier than in the High Plains and Davis Mountains AVAs. Variable underlying geology leads to differing soil types planted to vineyards in each AVA; predominantly loamy fine sands and fine sandy loam in Texas High Plains, silty clay loam and loam in Escondido Valley, loam and clay loam in Texas Davis Mountains, and clay loam and sandy loam in Mesilla Valley. West Texas produces red wines from Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot cultivars, which are notable for good tannin and excellent colour; recent planting trends to warm-climate cultivars, including Tempranillo, Sangiovese, Mourvèdre, and Grenache, are producing blended wines of great promise. Similarly, a solid reputation for white wines from Chenin blanc and Chardonnay is being enhanced by increased production of Viognier, Vermentino, and other warm-climate varietal wines.\n\nSOMMAIRE\n\nTexas produit environ 90 000 hectolitres de vin par année provenant de plus de 200 établissements vinicoles et 1214 ha de vignes. Huit régions de productions de raisins de cuve sont officiellement reconnues comme zones viticoles américaines (AVA) en Texas. Une meilleure compréhension des conditions de croissance au sein de chacune AVA facilite le choix des variétés, (cultivars) adaptées pour le succès et l’expansion continue de l’industrie viticole. Un système d’information géographique (SIG) a été développé pour permettre la caractérisation améliorée des conditions climatiques, géologiques et édaphiques de l’AVA de Texas. Le SIG contient les ensembles de données décrivant les variables climatiques, la géologie, les sols, l’altitude, et topographie d’importances pour la production viticole. Ce document caractérise les quatre Zones viticoles de l’Ouest Texas: Texas High Plains, Escondido Valley, Texas Davis Mountains, et Mesilla Valley. Les caractéristiques communes entre des quatre AVA sont relativement haute altitude, très chaudes températures de saison de croissance, les températures de l’hiver doux et faibles précipitations annuelles. Les variations locales en altitude et topographie modifient les conditions climatiques entre les zones viticoles américaines et entraînent des variations des degrés-jour de croissance (GDD) et la température moyenne de mûrissement (RPMT), ce qui exercent une influence sur rendement des cultivars de raisin. Le Texas High Plains et le Texas Davis Mountains zones viticoles ont les GDD les plus bas et une RPMT froide; le Escondido Valley et Mesilla Valley zones viticoles sont plus secs et plus chauds, ce qui entraine le mûrissement de fruit plus tôt que dans le High Plains et Davis Mountains AVAs. Variable géologie sous-jacente conduit à une variation des types de sol plantés aux vignobles dans chaque AVA ; principalement loam sableux et le loam sablo-argileux dans Texas High Plains, loam limoneux et loam dans Escondido Valley, loam et loam argileux dans Texas Davis Mountains, et loam argileux et loam sableux dans Mesilla Valley. Ouest Texas produit des vins rouges de Cabernet Sauvignon et le Merlot qui se distinguent par le tanin et une couleur excellente, les tendances récentes à la plantation de climat chaud cultivars, y compris le Tempranillo, le Sangiovese, Mourvèdre, et Grenache, produisent des vins d’assemblages de grandes promesses. De même, une solide réputation pour les vins blancs de Chenin blanc et le Chardonnay est améliorer par l’augmentation de la production de Viognier, Vermentino, et d’autres vins de climat chaud cépages.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1 The American southwest, including parts of west Texas, represents the earliest successful viticulture and oldest continuous tradition of winemaking in North America (Pinney 1989). Sacramental wine was necessary for missionaries to conduct religious services, and the remoteness of the unsettled southwest required local wine production. Accordingly, Spanish missionaries in the seventeenth century brought Vitis vinifera grapevines to plant at missions they established in the region. In 1681, Franciscans established a mission at Ysleta on the Rio Grande near El Paso (Kingston 1988), within the present-day Mesilla Valley winegrowing appellation.\n\n2 Over the next 200 years, wine-growing in the El Paso area (Fig. 1) expanded beyond the missions, becoming the most important revenue-producing crop in the region by the early part of the nineteenth century (Pinney 1989). During this period, El Paso held a favourable reputation among traders for ‘Pass Wine’ as well as the local brandy. Grape cultivation nearly vanished from the area in the early twentieth century owing to a period of extensive flooding along the Rio Grande and the passage of prohibition in Texas in 1919. Renewed interest in winegrowing led to the creation, in 1985, of the Mesilla Valley American Viticultural Area, which lies within El Paso County, Texas and Doña Ana County, New Mexico.\n\n3 Today, the broad region of west Texas is a major contributor to the Texas wine industry, which produces approximately 90 000 hl annually (MKF Research 2008) from more than 200 wineries. Vineyards in west Texas account for 66% of the approximately 1214 ha of vineyards in the state (National Agricultural Statistics Service 2009) and the state’s two largest wineries are located in this region. There are four American Viticultural Areas in west Texas: Texas High Plains, Escon-dido Valley, Texas Davis Mountains, and Mesilla Valley.\n\nFigure 1. Locations of the eight American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) in Texas: 1) Mesilla Valley, 2) Texas Davis Mountains, 3) Escondido Valley, 4) Fredericksburg in the Texas Hill Country, 5) Bell Mountain, 6) Texas High Plains, 7) Texas Hill Country, 8) Texoma. Only the Mesilla Valley (1), Texas Davis Mountains (2), Escondido Valley (3) and Texas High Plains (6) AVAs are discussed in this paper.\n\nDisplay large image of Figure 1\n\n4 An American Viticultural Area (AVA) is strictly geographically focused compared to European wine appellations, which often prescribe grape cultivars and production practices; it is an officially recognized \"delimited grape growing region distinguishable by geographical features, the boundaries of which have been recognized and defined\" through a petition process (Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 27, Part 4, Subpart C, Section 4.25). An AVA designation is one type of appellation permitted on American wine labels to provide consumers with information on the growing locale of grapes used in the labelled wine. Petitions for new viti-cultural areas are considered for approval by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, provided there is evidence that the proposed name of the viticultural area is locally or nationally known as referring to the area specified; the boundaries are as specified; and the geographical features (climate, soil, elevation, physical features, etc.) distinguish the viticultural features of the proposed area from surrounding areas (CFR Title 27, Part 9, Subpart A).\n\n5 American wine may be labelled with an approved AVA appellation, if no less than 85% of the wine is derived from grapes grown within the AVA and the wine has been fully finished in the State, within which the labelled AVA is located. Vintage-labelled American wine that also displays the AVA must be at least 95% derived from grapes harvested in the labelled year. The term ‘estate bottled’ may be used on a wine label only if the wine is labelled with an AVA appellation of origin and the bottling winery is i) located in the labelled AVA; ii) grew all of the grapes used to make the wine on land owned or controlled by the winery within the boundaries of the AVA; and iii) crushed the grapes, fermented the resulting must, and finished, aged, and bottled the wine in a continuous process.\n\n6 The official description of AVAs published within the CFR Title 27, Part 9, Subpart A, details only the AVA boundaries; it does not provide the descriptions of climate and soils from the original petitions, which moreover are often limited in detail. Therefore, a geographic information system (GIS) was developed to characterize the climatic, geologic and edaphic (soil) conditions of Texas AVAs. GIS is a powerful tool for the spatial analysis of environmental factors at the landscape level, and has been previously applied to the analysis of the viticultural potential of the Umpqua Valley (Jones et al. 2004) and the Rogue Valley (Jones et al. 2006) AVAs in Oregon, and to assess viticultural performance in the Okanagan and Similkameen valleys in British Columbia (Bowen et al. 2005). The Texas AVA project developed and utilized a GIS to characterize the eight AVAs in the State, and produced an interactive website, the Winegrowing Regions of Texas, for public access to the system [txwineregions.tamu.edu].\n\nCOMPONENTS OF GIS\n\n7 The Texas AVA GIS (AVATXIS) was developed by the authors; construction of the system is described in detail elsewhere (Takow 2008). The GIS layers, data sources, and their relevance to grape production are summarized below.\n\n8 Elevation and topography often have an important influence on grape production, albeit indirectly through effects on temperature and solar radiation (Jones and Hellman 2003). Absolute elevation above sea level determines temperature, and relative elevation of a site compared to surrounding topography influences cold air drainage and temperature variations along a slope. The slope and aspect of a site affect sunlight reception and air drainage. Elevation data were obtained from the National Elevation Dataset [seamless.usgs.gov], a seamless mosaic of the highest-resolution, best quality elevation data available across the United States (United States Geological Survey 2002). Topo-graphic categorization of the Texas AVAs was carried out using 10 m digital elevation models (DEM) to determine areas of higher elevation and to calculate hill shade values.\n\n9 Gladstones (1992) detailed the aspects of climate critical to grape production in his authoritative book Viti-culture and Environment, in which he emphasized the great influence of temperature on grape and wine production as well as the effects of sunlight, rainfall, and relative humidity. A common measure of biologically effective temperatures for grapes is the heat summation index known as growing degree-days (GDD). This index was utilized in California to help categorize regions of the state as a guide to suitability of grape varieties (Winkler et al. 1974). Although it has limitations, use of GDD has subsequently become a rough guide for global comparisons of growing season temperatures among viticultural regions, and for selection of climate-appropriate grape varieties. The average climatic conditions of a given region are considered to be the major determinants of the grape varieties and styles of wine produced therein (Jones and Hellman 2003).\n\n10 Climatic data were obtained from Daymet [daymet.org], a climatic database produced from a model that generates daily surfaces of temperature, precipitation, humidity, and radiation over large regions of the United States (Thornton et al. 1997). The model utilizes digital elevation models and daily observations from an 18-year daily dataset (1980–1997) to produce climatic variables. This daily dataset of temperature, precipitation, humidity and radiation has been prepared as a continuous surface at 1 km resolution. Climatic variables used in the characterization of Texas AVAs were: daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature, daily average temperature, and annual precipitation. GDD was determined by the standard method developed in California (Winkler et al. 1974); 10°C was subtracted from the mean daily temperature and the cumulative sum through the growing season (April 1st through October 31st) calculated. Ripening-period mean temperature (RPMT) was calculated for the months in which grapes typically ripen.\n\n11 The underlying geology of a region influences vineyards through the physical and chemical characteristics of surface soils evolved from weathering of parent rock (Wilson 1998; Macqueen and Meinert 2006). Climate and geology interact in soil-forming processes, and geology also determines the topography and land-forms of a region. Geologic data were obtained from the digital geologic map database of Texas, which was derived from the 1992 Geologic Map of Texas (Stoeser et al. 2005). The United States Geological Survey obtained original clear film positives of the Geologic Map of Texas and photographically enlarged them onto Mylar film. These films were scanned, geo-referenced, digitized, attributed, edge-matched, and combined into a single statewide database.\n\n12 Worldwide, wine grapes are successfully grown on a wide range of soils; there is no single soil type that is ideal for grape production. Soil characteristics define the baseline of water and nutrient availability, which together apply the greatest initial influence on grapevine vigour (Jones and Hellman 2003). The generally accepted criteria for vineyard suitability were summarized by Nicholas (2004): soil depth of at least 60 to 100 cm, good internal drainage, adequate water infiltration rate, good water holding capacity, pH between 5.0 and 8.5 in the root zone, and the absence of toxic concentrations of salts or mineral nutrients such as boron, aluminum or manganese.\n\n13 The source of soils data was the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) database, which consists of geo-referenced map data and associated tables of attribute data (Soil Conservation Service 1994). Map units in STATSGO are a combination of geographically associated phases of soil series. The attribute database gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and the soil properties. The characterization of Texas AVAs utilized the following soil properties: texture, depth, available water capacity, soil pH, and permeability. Permeability (saturated hydraulic conductivity) is a measure of the ease of water movement in soil. Soils with permeability within the range of 3.6 to 36 cm/hr are most favourable for grape production.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\n49 High elevation combined with little cloud cover produces high sunlight intensity that contributes to fruitfulness of vines and good colour and tannin development in fruit. Cumulative GDD in the coolest parts of the Texas High Plains AVA (2028) and the Texas Davis Mountains AVA (2190) are comparable to the California wine-growing regions of the Sierra Foothills and Lodi, respectively. It is noteworthy that wine grapes typically mature and are harvested in late August to early September in these west Texas AVAs, by which time degree-day accumulations are as much as 400 fewer than standard full-season (April to October) calculations used in comparisons to other winegrowing regions of the world. The Mesilla Valley and Escon-dido Valley AVAs are warmer still, having 2830 and 2980 GDD, respectively. These AVAs would be classified as ‘too hot’ for wine production by Jones et al. (2010), but this conclusion is contradicted by more than 20 years of successful wine production in the Escon-dido Valley AVA. Again, early grape maturity and harvest (July and August) in the Mesilla Valley and Escondido Valley AVAs may preclude meaningful comparisons of full-season degree-days with other winegrowing regions.\n\n50 The dry growing conditions throughout west Texas are advantageous for grape production because they are not conducive to spread of most fungal diseases of grapevines. Relatively low annual precipitation also enables irrigation practices to be used to manage grapevine vigor and potentially influence grape quality. Winter temperatures are generally mild, making possible the production of Vitis vinifera wine grapes with little risk of freeze injury. Recent vineyard plantings have focused on growing grape cultivars with known adaptation to warm and hot climates, including Sangiovese, Vermentino and Tempranillo, and the Rhone cultivars Viognier, Grenache, Mourvèdre, and Syrah.\n\n51 Soils are highly variable among west Texas AVAs. Vineyards are predominantly planted on loamy fine sands and fine sandy loams in the Texas High Plains AVA, whereas loams and clay loams predominate in the other AVAs. The Texas High Plains AVA leads the state in vineyard hectares and grape production, with more than 440 ha and continued growth underway. It also has the most potential for expansion, as more than 1.25 million ha of deep, well-drained loamy fine sands, sandy loams, and loam soils are well-suited for grape production.\n\n52 The combination of favourable climatic conditions, planting of climate-appropriate grape cultivars, and good vineyard soils has helped establish west Texas as a significant new winegrowing region with demonstrated capability of producing high quality wines and great potential for significant expansion."
