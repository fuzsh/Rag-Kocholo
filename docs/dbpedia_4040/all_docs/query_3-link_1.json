THE MAIN EFFECTS OF EL NINO OVER WEST CENTRAL TEXAS WERE THE ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND THE INCREASED RAINFALL OVER SOUTHERN AND EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE REGION...RELATIVELY MINOR EFFECTS COMPARED TO OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. THE OVERALL WEATHER PATTERN REVERSED ITSELF IN MARCH AS WEST CENTRAL TEXAS EXPERIENCED BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND ABOVE NORMAL RAINFALL...ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE RAINFALL OCCURRED IN ONLY TWO EVENTS DURING THE MONTH. THE FIRST EVENT OCCURRED ON MARCH 6-7 AS LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN FELL OVER THE NORTHEAST PORTIONS OF WEST CENTRAL TEXAS. SMALL HAIL FELL IN PARTS OF SAN ANGELO...BUT ONLY ISOLATED SEVERE WEATHER OCCURRED ACROSS THE REGION. FOLLOWING THIS RAIN EVENT AN ARCTIC AIR MASS PRODUCED FIVE DAYS OF DRY AND UNSEASONABLY COLD WEATHER WITH AVERAGE TEMPERATURES BETWEEN THE 8TH AND THE 12TH RANGING FROM 15 TO 20 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. THE SECOND SIGNIFICANT RAIN EVENT OF THE MONTH ON MARCH 15-16 WAS MORE WIDESPREAD WITH MOST LOCATIONS RECEIVING 1-3 INCHES OF RAIN WITH ISOLATED AMOUNTS UP TO 5 INCHES IN PORTIONS OF THE HEARTLAND.

SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE REGION RECEIVED RAIN AND THUNDERSTORMS ON THE MORNING OF THE 8TH...WITH SONORA ALSO RECEIVING GOLFBALL SIZE HAIL. SCATTERED STRONG AND SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ALSO STRUCK THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN BIG COUNTRY AND THE HEARTLAND...DURING THE AFTERNOON OF THE 26TH. HARDEST HIT AREAS WERE HASKELL COUNTY WHICH RECEIVED BASEBALL SIZE HAIL AND A BRIEF TORNADO...AND NORTHERN SHACKELFORD COUNTY WHERE ANOTHER TORNADO WAS SIGHTED. MAY AND JUNE WERE HOT AND DRY ACROSS MOST OF WEST CENTRAL TEXAS AS SAN ANGELO ENDURED 59 CONSECUTIVE DAYS WITHOUT MEASURABLE RAIN BETWEEN MARCH 28 AND MAY 26...SETTING A RECORD FOR THE LONGEST CONTINUOUS DRY SPELL FOR THE SPRING SEASON. ABILENE HAD ITS WARMEST MAY ON RECORD WHILE SAN ANGELO HAD ITS SECOND WARMEST MAY. DUE TO WIDESPREAD WILDFIRES IN MEXICO AND SOUTHERLY WINDS ALOFT...THE SKY WAS UNUSUALLY HAZY OVER WEST CENTRAL TEXAS DURING THE FIRST HALF OF MAY. TEMPERATURES REMAINED WELL ABOVE NORMAL THROUGH THE MONTH OF JUNE...WITH THE ONLY RESPITE FROM THE HEAT OCCURRING BETWEEN JUNE 5 AND 7 AFTER PASSAGE OF A STRONG COLD FRONT. DESPITE THE GENERALLY DRY CONDITIONS...SEVERAL EPISODES OF SEVERE WEATHER AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL OCCURRED THROUGH MAY AND JUNE. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS OCCURRED ON MAY 25 AND 26 WHEN A TORNADO STRUCK THE TOWN OF VERIBEST IN TOM GREEN COUNTY...FLOODING OCCURRED IN GRAPE CREEK...AND HAIL OF GOLFBALL SIZE OR LARGER STRUCK EASTERN PORTIONS OF SAN ANGELO AND WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE CONCHO VALLEY AND BIG COUNTRY. OTHER NOTABLE SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS OCCURRED ON MAY 8 IN HASKELL AND THROCKMORTON COUNTIES WITH BASEBALL SIZE HAIL AND BRIEF TORNADOES...ON JUNE 4 AND 5 IN PORTIONS OF THE HEARTLAND AND EASTERN CONCHO VALLEY WITH HAIL UP TO GOLFBALL SIZE AND MINOR WIND DAMAGE...ON JUNE 12 ACROSS THE HEARTLAND AND EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE BIG COUNTRY AND CONCHO VALLEY WITH SEVERAL REPORTS OF WIND DAMAGE AND HAIL...AND ON JUNE 20 IN HAMLIN WHERE 2.5 INCH DIAMETER HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS OF 80 MPH WERE REPORTED. THE HOT SUMMER CONTINUED THROUGH JULY AS BOTH ABILENE AND SAN ANGELO RECORDED THEIR THIRD WARMEST JULY ON RECORD...WHILE THE DROUGHT INTENSIFIED AFTER ANOTHER MONTH OF BELOW NORMAL RAINFALL OVER MOST OF THE REGION. A FEW LOCATIONS RECEIVED LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL...INCLUDING A 4-6 INCH RAINFALL IN BROWN COUNTY ON JULY 4TH...BUT THE HOT JULY SUN QUICKLY EVAPORATED THESE RAINS. SEVERE DOWNBURST THUNDERSTORM WINDS OCCURRED SEVERAL TIMES IN JULY...WITH THE MOST NOTABLE WIND DAMAGE OCCURRING AROUND ABILENE ON JULY 12...AND AT MILES IN SOUTHWEST RUNNELS COUNTY ON THE 16TH. THE HEAT WAVE SUBSIDED DURING THE MONTH OF AUGUST AS TEMPERATURES RETURNED TO NEAR NORMAL LEVELS. RAINFALL ALSO INCREASED OVER CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF WEST CENTRAL TEXAS AS MORE MOISTURE FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO WAS ABLE TO RETURN TO THE REGION. AREAS SOUTH OF A STERLING CITY TO SAN ANGELO TO SAN SABA LINE RECEIVED THE MOST RAINFALL IN AUGUST...WITH THE MOST NOTABLE RAIN EVENT OCCURRING OVER THE NORTHERN EDWARDS PLATEAU AND NORTHWEST HILL COUNTY DUE TO REMNANTS OF TROPICAL STORM CHARLEY. RAINFALL FROM THIS SYSTEM CAUSED FLOODING ALONG THE LLANO RIVER ON AUGUST 23...WHILE 6-10 INCHES OF RAINFALL PRODUCED ADDITIONAL FLOODING AROUND SONORA AND PORTIONS OF SCHLEICHER AND CROCKETT COUNTIES ON AUGUST 25. TYPICALLY SEPTEMBER IS THE WETTEST MONTH OF THE YEAR...BUT FOR ABILENE AND SAN ANGELO IN 1998 IT WAS ONE OF THE DRIEST WITH BOTH LOCATIONS RECEIVING 1/10 INCH OR LESS OF RAINFALL...WHICH WAS THE 7TH DRIEST SEPTEMBER ON RECORD FOR BOTH CITIES. ALTHOUGH UP TO 5 INCHES OF RAIN FALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTH OVER SOUTHEAST PORTIONS OF WEST CENTRAL TEXAS...THE DROUGHT CONTINUED OVER MOST OF THE REGION AS TEMPERATURES SOARED ABOVE MONTHLY NORMALS...WITH ABILENE RECORDING ITS FOURTH WARMEST SEPTEMBER ON RECORD. OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER CONTINUED WITH WARMER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES BUT THE EXTREME HEAT WAS FINALLY BROUGHT TO AN END ON OCTOBER 5TH BY A COLD FRONT THAT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HEAVY RAIN AND HAIL OVER THE SOUTHEAST HALF OF WEST CENTRAL TEXAS. PORTIONS OF SAN ANGELO RECEIVED HAIL UP TO GOLF BALL SIZE...WHILE ROWENA IN RUNNELS COUNTY RECEIVED BASEBALL SIZE HAIL FROM THIS STORM. OTHERWISE...MOST OF OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER WAS DRY UNTIL THE EVENING AND NIGHT OF HALLOWEEN WHEN THUNDERSTORMS DUMPED MORE THAN AN INCH OF RAIN ON ALL OF WEST CENTRAL TEXAS...WITH ISOLATED REPORTS OF WIND DAMAGE FROM THESE STORMS. THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT THAT PRODUCED THESE STORMS LED TO A COOL AND DAMP FIRST WEEK OF NOVEMBER...BUT THE REMAINDER OF THE MONTH WAS GENERALLY WARM AND DRY. THIS WARM WEATHER LASTED INTO THE FIRST WEEK OF DECEMBER...BUT A COLD AIR MASS FINALLY BROUGHT THE FIRST FREEZE OF THE FALL SEASON TO WEST CENTRAL TEXAS ON THE MORNING OF THE 8TH...ABOUT THREE WEEKS LATER THAN THE AVERAGE DATE FOR THE FIRST FALL FREEZE. SOME LOCATIONS THEN JUMPED STRAIGHT INTO WINTER AS A SNOWSTORM PRODUCED UP TO 7 INCHES OF SNOW OVER THE WESTERN BIG COUNTRY AND STERLING COUNTY ON THE 11TH. THIS SNOW MISSED THE CITIES OF ABILENE AND SAN ANGELO...BUT AN ARCTIC AIR MASS PLUNGING INTO ALL OF WEST CENTRAL TEXAS ON THE 21ST COINCIDED WITH THE OFFICIAL START OF THE WINTER SEASON WITH MUCH BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES THROUGH CHRISTMAS EVE. FREEZING RAIN AND SLEET PRODUCED SLICK ROADS OVER EASTERN PORTIONS OF WEST CENTRAL TEXAS ON THE MORNING OF THE 23RD...WHILE THE SOUTHEAST HALF OF THE REGION RECEIVED ABOUT 1/4 INCH LAYER OF ICE FROM THE EVENING OF THE 23RD INTO THE EARLY MORNING OF THE 24TH. THE ICE WAS MELTED BY CHRISTMAS DAY AS THE FINAL WEEK OF THE YEAR RETURNED TO THE FAMILIAR WARM AND DRY WEATHER CONDITIONS...WHICH IS GENERALLY EXPECTED IN WINTER OVER WEST CENTRAL TEXAS DURING A LA NINA PATTERN THAT IS NOW IN PLACE. $$ DEUTSCHENDORF"
