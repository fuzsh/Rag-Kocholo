But, once they became involved in the action, the Confederate Army was slowly pushed south from Arkansas into Louisiana and parts of Texas as the Union strived to take Shreveport and gain full control of the Mississippi River system.\n\nHORSESHOE BAY—Phil Dawson, who has been a field goal kicker in three different decades—college and NFL—did a superb job of stitching life’s lessons inside a pro football career, March 2, at the Horseshoe Bay Sports Club. Candor was abundant, as the former Longhorn (mid-to-late 1990s) indicated not every NFL player hums the Nationwide tune. “There’s a lot of insecurity,” said the 41-year-old Dawson, who recently re-signed for a fourth year in San Francisco.\n\nOne Jacket is heading to state, and two who missed were also outstanding in the Powerlifting Association, Region II, Class-4A Meet, March 12. “Great accomplishment,” declared head coach Clint Easley.

Dalton Dewveall, who plays a bit of tennis—see Spring Sports Special—and football, achieved one of his major goals.\n\nThe Llano Special Olympics Yellow Jackets participated in the 2-day Special Olympics Basketball Tournament, March 4 and 5 in San Marcos.

Are you going to tell me it takes four or five weeks to get ready for the 162-game endurance test?\n\nI’ve written this before, but my attacks were on Texas and Texas Tech. I didn’t like the Longhorns wearing black on the basketball court, and I really didn’t like seeing Tech in all that gray in football. I’ll bet Chris Christie will get back into the GOP presidential-nomination race and then beat Hillary Clinton, before Texas wears black at DKR Texas Memorial Stadium.\n\nOne Jacket is heading to state, and two who missed were also outstanding in the Powerlifting Association, Region II, Class-4A Meet, March 12. “Great accomplishment,” declared head coach Clint Easley.

Hooray, hooray. Callooh! Callay! They chortle in their joy. And drink green beer. Wear green clothes. Green being associated with St. Patrick due to the shamrock. He supposedly used the three-leaved plant to explain the Holy Trinity to pre-Christian Irish. One leaf, two leaf, ... St. Patrick was actually British. Invading Irish kidnapped him and kept him as a slave. Somehow he escaped and returned to Britain. Then later returned to Ireland as a devout Christian. Talk about ...\n\nBeautiful rain. There were many smiling faces at church Sunday morning. A good rain shower will perk up the entire community. All the reports I heard were from three to four inches. Other areas in Mason County had more rain, but we are grateful for slow rain that soaked in the parched ground. If you have tried to send me information for the column, I discovered last week that my email was incorrect in the paper.\n\nSouthwestern Chicken and Rice Casserole There are times I might have a little extra time on my hands when I like to make something to put in the freezer.

I join other Americans in bewilderment that some of the statements have been extremely poorly chosen, slipping from classification of absurdity to vulgarity.\n\nI’m not saying that I can solve all the problems, but there are a few I could put a dent in. Like, the commercials on television about drugs. The saving from these advertisements could be savings at the pharmacy and help whoever needed these drugs. You have to get a prescription from your doctor, so why advertise?\n\nMy Goat is Got This goat thing is driving me nuts. Not that I necessarily had all that far to go, of course, but still. I’m going to need some help on this one. What happened was, a goat got arrested. Now, right off, you know you’re looking at good column material when you see a headline that says, ‘No, seriously.\n\nMarch is National Nutrition Month—what better time to build a keyhole garden? Dr. Deb Tolman gave a great program last Saturday, and while “Rome wasn’t built in a day” our keyhole garden at the Food Bank was built in about 3 hours! We had 15 people stay after the program to help build it, and having Bob and Linda Laury and Craton and Wendy Hastings involved from the “get-go” was a huge factor in our success.\n\nCHINESE medicine dates back over 3000 years. It is still a very valid system that treats the body holistically. At first glance, it seems simplistic because the conditions treated within Chinese medicine use terms such as excess fire or water or wind rather than our modern scientific names. Yet this system is actually very complex and can be significantly more effective than our modern medicine especially with chronic health problems. The part of Chinese medicine that I find particularly useful ...\n\nIt’s that time of year again; we lost an hour overnight without hesitation. I woke up on Sunday feeling just as tired as the night before when I went to bed. It’s funny how the time just disappears while you are asleep. It’s like that theory of alien abduction, where the abductee experiences lost time.\n\nFull 5th Circuit to hear Texas voter ID case AUSTIN — The entire U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals will review Texas’ controversial voter identification law. A majority of the judges of the Fifth Circuit on March 9 voted in support of an “en banc” rehearing of oral arguments in Veasey v.\n\nRecalling Llano county's history\n\nEven though the soldiers from Llano County and the surrounding area enlisted at Camp Terry near Austin on April 1, 1863, unforeseen circumstances would prevent them from engaging in any battle or skirmishes with the Union Army for almost a full year. But, once they became involved in the action, the Confederate Army was slowly pushed south from Arkansas into Louisiana and parts of Texas as the Union strived to take Shreveport and gain full control of the Mississippi River system.\n\nHORSESHOE BAY—Phil Dawson, who has been a field goal kicker in three different decades—college and NFL—did a superb job of stitching life’s lessons inside a pro football career, March 2, at the Horseshoe Bay Sports Club. Candor was abundant, as the former Longhorn (mid-to-late 1990s) indicated not every NFL player hums the Nationwide tune. “There’s a lot of insecurity,” said the 41-year-old Dawson, who recently re-signed for a fourth year in San Francisco.\n\nI’ve written this commentary before, and I will be glad to stop the repetition if someone would listen to me! The general theme is: the baseball season is too long; the specific subject today is Spring Training, the main culprit. Are you going to tell me it takes four or five weeks to get ready for the 162-game endurance test?\n\nI’ve written this before, but my attacks were on Texas and Texas Tech. I didn’t like the Longhorns wearing black on the basketball court, and I really didn’t like seeing Tech in all that gray in football. I’ll bet Chris Christie will get back into the GOP presidential-nomination race and then beat Hillary Clinton, before Texas wears black at DKR Texas Memorial Stadium.\n\nOne Jacket is heading to state, and two who missed were also outstanding in the Powerlifting Association, Region II, Class-4A Meet, March 12. “Great accomplishment,” declared head coach Clint Easley.

She grew up in the Lake Buchanan area, went to school in Llano, then on to UT and became an RN where she worked in surgery in San Antonio.\n\nThe Recycle Center in Llano is just that, a recycle center, it is not a drop off for household trash. The center has asked us to get the word out about items that are accepted, household trash causes extra work for the employees of the center and keeps them from doing the job they need to do.\n\nThis goat thing is driving me nuts.

However, I’m not certain if people are aware of a provision known as Additional State Aid for Tax Reduction (ASATR) and how it affects Llano ISD.\n\nWhile the rock-stacking fans were flooding into Llano, another tournament was happening at the golf course. Contestants from 30 Texas cities and 3 states converged to fling the plastic discs that derived from college students playing with pie pans as early as 1938. Today’s discs are more refined and aerodynamic and more accurate. The development of the disc popularized challenging games such as disc golf and the rise of competitions, clubs and associations.
