        "text": "454th Bomb Group. Incised painted leather. Made in Italy.\n\nFlying from Italy, the group flew 243 missions on over 150 primary targets in Italy, Yugoslavia, Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Rumania, France, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Greece, and Poland. During this time, 13,389.19 tons of bombs were dropped during 7,091 sorties on enemy marshalling yards, oil refineries, bridges, installations, airdromes, rail lines, etc.\n\nThe 454th participated in the drive to Rome, the invasion of Southern France, and the defeat of Axis forces in northern Italy. The 454th was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for similar action on the high priority Messerschmitt Aircraft Factory at Bad Voslau, Austria on 12 April 1944.[2][citation needed] It earned a second DUC for \"outstanding performance of duty in armed conflict with the enemy\" as a result of their mission against the Hermann Goering Steel Works in Linz, Austria on 25 July 1944."
