        "text": "\"When I Joined VetFriends, I read about the email locator service, and sent an email to my old friend. Fortunately he had also become a member and responded to my email. We talked on the phone several times in the last few years, and finally we were able to meet in El Paso, TX for a short visit. It was a wonderful moment that we will both remember for the rest of our lives, and we owe it to VetFriends. Thanks for making it possible!\" U.S. Veteran L. Prickett\n\n\"Dear VetFriends, Thanks so much for your help! The first address you sent me is my buddy. I called the number ans wow he was blown away when he found out who I was. What a conversation we had. It's been nearly 40 years since we parted. He said we were like brothers and then all of a sudden, we lost all contact. We were stationed in Germany in 1975 through 1978. I'm the first to ever contact him. He is so thankful I called and we exchanged addresses and he wants to come and visit. How cool is that. We raced volkswagens on our time off and we'd go to the range and shoot all day. We wonder about the rest that served with us in the artillery unit we served in. Thank you so much again for helping me find my friend.\" U.S. Veteran C. Young"
