        "text": "by IreneBelserion69, Jul 1, 2019, 4:07:58 AM\n\nJournals / Personal\n\nAs expected I’m going to be revising many calcs for Fairy Tail and other anime with Adjacent calcs to this and what better than to redo the mother of all Fairy Tail feats, the Legendary Deus Sama Comet feat.\n\nThe original feat had various conflicting scaling issues due to the problem of estimating the true size of Deus Sama, thankfully the anime fixes this issue and we get a true size of this realsitivtic Asteroid of death.\n\nAs you see i was more than right on the original timeframe being less than 10 seconds, i measured ti between 3 to 5 second and going by this gif i wasn’t disappointed.\n\nEarthland:91px(12750km)\n\nDeus Sema:747px(1,704.2265 m)\n\nDifference between Earth-Size and Meteor Size:7481.399919552947 times\n\n95,387,848.97430007\n\n1909px/91px=20.97802197802198\n\n95387848.97430007/20.97802197802198\n\n747/91=8.2\n\n4,546,996.654400209/8.2\n\n554,511.7871219767\n\nFinal distance of Deus Sema: 554,511,787 meters\n\nThis is roughly the distance of the Earth and Moon. Irene’s activation of the spell seemed to take only between 0:5 and 0:11 to activate the Asteroid, the Asteroid was visible as a small Red Dwarf like a light in the background, meaning that even from a vast distance, it was radiating intense enegery.\n\nNow comes the crazy part, speed of the Asteroid.\n\nGoing by timeframe, the meteor was shown at its distance at 0:13, began acclreararting at 0:14 and reach earth in 0:17 and exploded at 0:19, this is actually more or less the timeframe i predicted within my journal.\n\n554,511.7871219767/3 seconds\n\nThe final speed of the Asteroid:184,837,262.3739922 m/s(61.65%c)\n\nIn other words just merely 1.02 times faster than i previously calced, in fact, my prediction was right on the fucking money, only slightly off by distance.\n\nThis would make the meteor between 3-5 seconds in the timeframe as i rightfully predicted in the past. We’ll go with 3 seconds as it seemed to have rapidly moved to space and the frame between 15 and 16 seems to be a close up on the asteroid.\n\nGiven our previous calculations used the Sema comparison and cloud dispersion, we’re still using the original\n\nThe Atmospheric Impact enegery is far scarier too, the collision of the Asteroid with the Atmosphere alone creates an intense flame that covers a considerable chunk of the planet itself\n\nPeople already beat me to calculate the explosion of this feat but i decide to use our real world scaling for this mega feat. This calc image is based on this calc below from Vs Battle Wik but to get the actual size of the area, let’s get the size of the two continents.\n\nSize of Isghal : 140 px( 2550km)\n\nEstimated Diameter of Atmospheric Fire:3023.571428571429 km\n\nEstimated Area of the Fireball:9,141,984.183673469 sg km\n\nTo give you a frightening context of the fireball, this fireball is large enough to engulf the entire Continental United States .\n\nNow we got that, we can use the Nuke Map to see the actual destructive force needed to generate a fireball of this size that spans roughly the size for the Continental United States excluding Alaska and Hawaii and given the meteor approached Erza at 61.6% the speed of Light, meaning within 1/54,347 th of a second , merely the fireball hitting the atmosphere, it would be enough to incinerate all of America instantly. Now for the math.\n\nGoing by the result to create a fireball roughly large enough to engulf the distance between Alvarez and Isghal, you would need at least 3150000000000 Kilotons of TNT or 3 150 000 000 megatons or TNT which translates to 3.15 Petatons of TNT.\n\nThis is roughly 31.5 times the destructive power of the Chicxulub Asteroid that killed the dinosaurs.\n\nWe would literally not be able to survive even a second if this hit us in the real world as, within a split second, a shockwave powerful enough to travel the entire world would blow down every building all across the entire Nothern Hemisphere. killing every living person and creature on the planet in a split second with only Southern Africa, Aursritila, Southeastern Aisa, Japan, and Southern South America surviving the first initial shockwave, they would live long enough to see the entire world on fire as temperatures dramatically rise to over 1,000 degrees instantly and would die from the global firestorm in several seconds, only those below ground and in reinforced buildings at the deep interior would have any chance of survival and that’s only for merely a few seconds as this was merely the initial contact with the Atmosphere, the worst has yet to come.\n\nThis is what windspeeds of over 900 mph looks like on our planet, nothing on planet earth would survive being hit by these winds. Now Imagine windspeeds traveling at 463,100 times that speed crossing the earth at speeds approaching lightspeed? There would be nothing left on the planet, you would be dead before you could even hear the shockwave.\n\nThe pressure of the explosive shockwave would equal roughly 1.1664929339e+26 pounds per square inch or 5.3e+25 kg per square inch, that’s roughly the pressure eqauilvent of 9 Earth Masses per Square Inch or the force eqauilvent of 9 Earths hitting you at 9.81 m/s per Square inch, meaning your body would be instantaneously obliterated into dust on a subatomic level and this is merely the sheer pressure wave.\n\nDeus Sema’s Atmospheric Shockwave: 3.15 Petatons of TNT.\n\nNow for the sheer volume of heat generated merely passing the Earth’s Atmosphere in under a second.\n\nExploison diameter: 278px(3023.57km)\n\nFireball Diameter:336px(3656.8 km)\n\nFireball depth:9px(97.95 km)\n\nVolume of Fireball:1.277569121808e+18 m\n\nDenisty of Air:1.225 kg/m^3\n\nMass of the Atomsphere:1.5650221742148e+18 kg\n\nVaporization of Oxygen:213,125 J/kg\n\nTemperature of Atmospheric Entry:3,825 °C\n\nAverage Atmospheric temperatures: -15 C\n\nThe size of the fireball is roughly eqauilvent to 1/4th the mass of the Earths Atmosphere or nearly 8 times the mass of Saturn’s Moon Prometheus so Deus Sema impacting our Atmosphere alone created a fireball large enough to equal a mega Asteroid the size of the Island of Sumatra.\n\nNow to factor all these in.\n\n1.277569121808e+18×1.225 kg/m^3\n\n1.5650221742148e+18 kgx213,125 J/kg\n\n3,825 °C – -15 C=3840°C\n\n1.5650221742148e+18 kgx213,125 J/kgx3840°C\n\n1.280814147377392e+27 Joules\n\n1.280814147377392e+27 joule = 306 121 928 150 megaton [explosive] or 306.121 Petatons of TNT.\n\nThis attacks power is devastating, to put into context, that’s enough heating enegery to completely engulf the entire planet in a firestorm. Given the fire gases are injected thousands of kilometers onto the planet instantaneously, it would take merely seconds before the vaporized gasses fall down and rain flames onto the entire planet.\n\nBefore the Asteroid even impacts the surface of the Earth, the planet would be engulfed in a planetary firestorm.\n\nIn other words, this would be pretty much the effect on every living person on planet earth, those not completely destroyed by the shockwave would be vaporized instantly by the intense inferno flames. Unless they’re immune to fire like Natsu, the chances of survival would be next to zero unless you’re within underground shelter however it might not do much good as with the atmosphere on fire, all oxygen is converted to slams and those in the flames are completely engulfed in fire and this is before the meteor even impacts.\n\nThe movie Knowing would probably be the best example of this destructive event as everything is engulfed by the sun, though many wouldn’t have time to save their final words as they would’ve melted already.\n\nNow for the potential enegery of the Fireball falling back to the earth, falling back to Earth at 20km/sec, the flames would fall back to earth in 5 seconds with the energy of 3.1300443484296e+26 Joules or 74.809 Petatons of TNT, The flames would burn at such intensity that it would equal 7.475 Quadrillion tons of oil per second or 974 945 637 458 764 544.00 US gallons per second, that’s over 23.212 Quadrillion Barrels of Oil burning per second.\n\nThat’s nearly 45 times the volume of great Scaprin Sea, the Largest Lake in the whole world with an astounding 1,059,723,518,976.917 Cubic Kilometers. That’s over 13751.2 times the World’s Oil reverses currently. That’s enough oil to cover the North American continent in 292.5 meters of intense oil like flames or nearly the height of the empire state building.\n\nThe thermal energy of Deus Sema impacting the Atmosphere: 306.121 Petatons of TNT.\n\nNow for the Dispersion of clouds, as covered already, the explosion dispersed clouds, not much to talk about here as the explosion already hit with a devastating force and speed. Given the clouds were parted isntantesouly to the point they created plasma in the upper atmosphere, this further reaffirms the previous measurement that the cloud pariting and the side effects would produce.\n\nFirst, let’s part some clouds.\n\nEarthland:955px(12,750,000 m)\n\nCloud parting impact:50px(667,539.26m)^2\n\nCloud Depth: At least 8,000 m\n\nVolume:3,564,869,384,062,937 m^3\n\nThe density of the cloud: 3 grams per m^3\n\nMass:10,694,608,152,188.81 kg\n\nVelocity184,837,262.3739922 m/s(61.65%c)\n\n3.653792936372352e+29 joule = 87 327 747 045 000 megaton [explosive]\n\nMerely approaching the planet and generating enough force to separate the planet’s clouds pushing through the Atmosphere is over 3 times the GBE of the Moon itself, the force of the meteor colliding with our Atompshere would be akin to the Dwarf Planet Ceres colliding with our Planet Earth. In Graphic terms, merely impacting the Atmosphere and causing a Realistic parting of clouds is more than enough to completely destroy the surface fo the planet and reduce the planet into a fireball in a single day.\n\nAll this produced by an Asteroid no bigger than a small mountain which going by my original calcs is around 111,814,512,144,166.9 kg versus Circus which is over 9.4×10^20 kg and is the size of the state of Texas whereas the Asteroid Irene flung at earth was no smaller than a large town.\n\nYet moving at over 61.6% the speed of Light, it impacts the Planet Earth as if was the mass of Ceres and this is before the Asteroid even lands on the Surface, just a mere 12 km downward. At this point, it just seems like complete overkill, if the hellfires don’t engulf the planet or the sheer secondary shockwave doesn’t kill what wasn’t already destroyed, the sheer force at this point as the Asteroid rapidly goes down would be exerting pressure on the planet of roughly 3.2338793607e+30 PSI. That’s basically the eqauilvent of carrying the mass of the Sun per Square Inch.\n\nDeus Sama Cloud Parting energy: 87.327 Exatons of TNT(Moon Level +)\n\nNow for the final verdict on the Asteroid impact itself.\n\nLet’s recap the feat with the Lake Siclroia scaling feat.\n\nFairy Tail Guild:40px (25.8 m)\n\nCillf depth:438px(282.51 m)\n\nNow for redoing the scaling with the mountain.\n\nFairy Tail Guild: 16px(25.8m)\n\nZeref’s Mountain: 96px(154.8 m)\n\nDistance between Gildarts and the mountain 669px(1,078.76 m)\n\nYeah, this calc is very cute, however now that we have a possible timeframe of this feat thanks to the Brandish calc and learned several things since then, let’s revise this and see what we get this time.\n\nGuild:9px(25.8 m)\n\nMeteor Fragment Length and width: 12px(34.4m)\n\nMeteor Fragment Height:29px(83.133 m)\n\nArea length:861px(2,468.19m)\n\nMeteor Fragment:10px(83.133 m)\n\nMeteor diameter:205px(1,704.2265 m)\n\nVelocity:184,837,262.3739922 m/s(61.65%c)\n\nThe anime further verifies the sheer size fo the Asteriod as Erza flies into the Asterido and seemingly disappears, implying the Asteriod is more or less 1 mile wide.\n\nwww.maps.com/custom-radius-map…\n\nThat’s the eqauilvent of stretching form as far north as Times Square to the Flation Building on 23rd street in Manhattan. That’s far larger than the Asteroid’s original projection at merely 30 meters.\n\nA normal Asteriod of this size moving at average Meteor speeds of 11km would be devastating enough, producing 8.983666110854478e+20 Joules of TNT or 214.714 Gigatons of TNT.\n\nEnough to be over 10 times the entire World’s Nuclear Stockpile during the cold war or equal the potentially destructive force of the Yellowstone Super Volcano Eruption that would doom humanity.\n\nThis, however, is far from a normal Asteriod. Given it’s Enchanted, it’s density is far superior to Iron, the same iron Irene at a much weaker and younger time could effortlessly slice through with a twig giving the Asteriod the same density as the densest metal in the planet Osmium\n\n, a metal twice as dense as lead at ~22.6 g/cm3 –1 000 000 = 22,590 kg/m^3\n\nCombined with its insane speed of traveling Lunar Obits in seconds, this Asteriod would be hitting at far more destructive force.\n\nMeteor dimensions:1,704.2265 mx^3\n\nThe volume of the meteor:4949734933.340722 m^3\n\nDensity of Rock:22,590 kg/m^3\n\nMass:111,814,512,144,166.9 kg\n\n1.910060980460806e+30 joule = 456 515 530 700 000 megaton [explosive] 456.515 Exatons of TNT (Small Planet Level)\n\n1.910060980460806e+30 joule = 1.9477201496e+29 kilogram-force meter.\n\nIrene’s Deus Sama: 456.515 Exatons of TNT (Small Planet Level)\n\nDragon Irene’s Lifting Strength:1.9477201496e+29 kilogram-force meter( Class N/Pre Stellar)\n\nIn other words, this would be the eqauilvent half the force of dropping the moon on Planet Earth with the moon traveling at 11 km/sec, to put in short this would be the eqauilvent of the ending of Majora’s Mask if you failed to stop Majora from dropping the moon in real life.\n\nTo put into perspective of how fucked someone is, this would be the end result of the entire earth if Deus Sama moving at 61.6%c impacted with the force eqauilvent of a Moon-sized Asteroid moving at normal meteor speeds. There would simply be no life, nothing, everyone would die instantouesly and the chances of all life would be pretty much gone from the planet, no bunker in the world or underground shelter would even protect you as the earth shakes and breaks and the entire crust of the planet is destroyed.\n\nEveryone in Isghal would be instantaneously pancaked and vaporized within a second, in five seconds the crust is ejected violently up the Atmosphere, those who survived the initial shockwave as the meteor casually shoots through the atmosphere or the massive plasma trail left behind or even the insane pressure generated parting the clouds, the moment the Comet of death hits the planet, you would be instantouesly destroyed.\n\nAt this point, the temperatures reach to that of Super Giant Star with your body feeling the pressure of over 3.3810929573e+31 PS1 which would be like every Square of your body being weighed down with Super Giant Stars.\n\nThe Impact would instantaneously produce a Magnitude 18.988 on the Richter Scale, in this state, the planet literally shakes as the crust shakes, breaks and sinks into the mantle of the planet so if you survive the thermal radiation, insane windspeeds and crushing pressure, you could be killed by the earthquake.\n\nwww.stardestroyer.net/Resource…\n\nThe force of the explosion is so powerful that even on the moon, you would get third-degree burns from the blinding thermal radiation caused by the explosion, thermal radiation would stretch out for 11,945,968.8 kilometers, the moon’s surface would be hit by flames over 3,000 degrees with the moon being at the Air Burst radius of 496,935.6 kilometers which is enough to desotry everything on the surface of the moon, the fireball 17781464 seconds or 6 months and 3 weeks before the fireball dissipates with the planets burning for over thousands of years.\n\nThe explosion would violently eject debris which would become their own asteroids with debris being over 1km wide, falling at average meteor speeds, they pelt the already damaged earth by the millions while some debris are sent flying as far as 145,120,589.901 km, pelting the nearby planets of Mars and Venus with thousands of debris and fragments in a matter of 83 days after the explosion doing damage to the surface of their planets. with each meteor being able to do at least 143.403 Gigatons of TNT per asteroid fragment impact on Mars and Venus\n\nOnce the planet eventually cools off after millions of years and it starts to rain to fill in the barren dry planet, there would be a permeant crater 5,223.781 Kilometers wide and 1,305.945 Kilometers deep which would make it almost impossible to reform our oceans, the Crater would premenatetly expose the Inner Mantle of the Earth creating one giant Volcano on the planet. The Volcano Crater would be hundreds of Kilometers high with the area equal to 27,287,887.935961 Square Kilometers, that’s larger than the entire North American Continent. The Earth would have its own ring system from the impact as quintillions of kg of rock hover over the planet, the planet would never be the same again.\n\nThe sheer mass eqauilvent of the impact of Deus Sema is if you placed the mass of 100 Jupiter sized planets on Earth’s Gravity at 9.81 m/s or the typical mass of a Drawf Star.\n\nMeaning going by physics, the Asteriod Impact would equal in energy to trying to lift more than 31,800 Earth’s in mass off the ground on earth’s Gravity of 9.81 m/s, a feat vritually impossible by physics as if the earth had such mass, it would cease to exist.\n\nIn other words, assuming scientists could even detect this realistivc Asteriod traveling to our planet, in other to have any chance of stopping this Asteriod is to construct a rocket that would need to go at the exact same speed of a meteor. This would require over 316527547535931.1 Kgs of steel or 316.5 Billion Metric Tons of Steel, that’s more steel than our planet produces annually at 1.6912 Billion Metric Tons meaning it would take over just to build this ship.\n\nThis would make the rocketship appormeixtely 3,410.4 meters in Diameter and height. That’s times larger than the Three Gorges Dam in length.\n\nOr the Cifruamance equal to nearly 13 Burj Khalifa’s\n\nWith a surface Area equal to 11.6308282 Sq Kilometers, that’s about 1/10th the size of the Bronx sustainable on this rocket ship. If compared to the Borough of the Bronx, you can pretty much fit my whole block inside this spacecraft, the Energy needed to propel this bad boy to space would be far too much for any possible Earth fuel source to achieve so to even come close to powering this.\n\nHumans would need to learn harassed Anti Matter to push it, fortunately, a single gram of Anti Matter produces roughly 1.8×1014 Joules of energy which is more destructive power than the first two atomic bombs dropped. To get the equivalent to pushing this mass at 60% lightspeed. You would need roughly 10,611,449,891,448.92 kg worth of Anti Matter to propel this massive ball of steel to the earth at 1.910060980460806e+30 Joules, which is eqauilvent 90,427,370,467 Barrels filled with Anti Matter, that’s more Anti Matter in the barrels than the world’s annual Oil production at 34,565,500,000 Barrels of Oil, you need around 2 years, 7 months, 1 week and 3 days of oil production to match the numbers of barrels.\n\nSuch a mindblowing amount of energy would probably require over 300 years of technological innovations, that would be the only way to stop Deus Sema realistically, assuming the asteriod is coming from 500 Lightyears away.\n\nAll of these would be the effects of Deus Sema at it’s purest power, it’s enough to kill any and all life on the planet almost instantousely. It would take over 45,651,553,070,500 Average W-76 Nuclear Warheads to even come close to equalling the power needed to cancel out a destructive Asteroid of this kind.\n\nThat’s enough nukes to give every living human being in the world 6,087 W-76 Nukes or basically the equivalent of giving every man and woman on the planet their own Nuclear Stockpile.\n\n, basically an ANCAP’s wetdream.\n\nOr giving every human being on the planet at least 12 Tsar Bombas for every 7.5 Billion Humans alive.\n\nThis would be roughly enough energy to 1.061 Billion exawatt hours, this is enough to power the entire world for over 212,200,000 years which is over 3 times the length between the modern era and the Cretaceous Period, which is basically enough to solve all energy problems in the world for millions of years.\n\nAnd all that is inferior to Erza who was able to destroy this Asteroid…At half her hidden potential! Yes, you’re not reading this wrong, Erza is generating more enegery in her entire body crippled than every human being armed with over 2,000 Tsar Bombas.\n\nSo how powerful is Erza? She not only stopped the meteor outright but intercepted it when it was reaching the planet at a distance of over 9 km away, meaning that her speed had to match that of the Asteroid at a bare minimum, as seen with the gifs there, Erza is moving very close to Lightspeed\n\nAs we showed in the anime timeframe, The meteor approached Earth in 3 seconds with a 2-second margin of error, if we include attack activation speed which took around 6 seconds, this would give Erza about 9-11 seconds to react to the spell used. This is consistent given the average use of words per minute is 150 and this is excluding anime logic. Erza spoke about 30 words in the timeframe Deus Sema was coming towards earth which is about 12 seconds which is more less close to the time passed to react.\n\nErza despite crippled was able to intecpert the meteor moving at the same speed as the meteor itself and this is prior to further acccleaerting pass the speed she was in…Meaning if she went even faster than 61.6%c, does that mean she’s achieved the speed of Light?\n\nGoing by this, very likely but let’s reaffirm this with hard calcs.\n\nMeteor diameter:164px(1,704.2265 m)\n\nDistance Erza is from Meteor:152px(1,579.527 m)\n\nDistance from Sea Level: 928px(9,643.428 m)\n\nVelocity of the meteor:184,837,262.3739922 m/s(61.65%c)\n\nDistance bullet was away from Surface= 9,643.428 m\n\n184,837,262.3739922 m/sx9,643\n\nDistance the character moved = 13.934+35 m) x (Speed of projectile ) / (Distance the projectile was away from the tank = 35m))\n\n184,837,262.3739922 m/sx9,643 m+1,579.527 m/9,643 m\n\nErza’s Speed:215,113,674.95 m/s (71.7 % SoL/Realsitstvic+)\n\nSo not quite Lightspeed but very close.\n\nFirst, let’s factor Erza’s speed regarding her takeoff launch speed\n\nKeep in mind she threw herself up into the air with one arm, which is impressive in itself.\n\nErza’s weight presumably: 54.43 kg\n\nThe distance achieved:9,643.428 m\n\nErza’s Speed:215,113,674.9557411 m/s (71.7 % c)\n\nErza’s throwing strength:2.518688004315843e+18 Newtons or 601.980 880 57 megatons of TNT(Mountain Level+)\n\nNow for ForcexDistance.\n\n2.518688004315843e+18 Newtonsx9,643.428 m\n\n2.428878642408352e+22 Joules\n\nNow comes the fun part, finding out how much cutting force/destructive power Erza has if she can spit a whole meteor in half and those halves violently fragment and break into so many pieces that they burn up.\n\nNow for the final possible kinetic Energy of Erza colliding with the Asteroid before doing her devastating slash that destroyed it.\n\nErza’s speed:215,113,674.9557411 m/s (71.7 % c)\n\nMass:111,814,512,144,166.9 kg\n\nE=MxC^2/2\n\nE=2.587046393955001e+30 Joules\n\n2.587046393955001e+30 joule = 618 318 927 810 000 megaton [explosive] 618.318 Exatons of TNT\n\nErza’s Kinetic Impact against Deus Sema: 618.318 Exatons of TNT(Smal Planet level+)\n\nGoing with Because science video on cutting bullets we can get a good take on perhaps what power is needed to cut something as massive as the Asteroid so instead of bullets, try an almost the speed of light death Asteroid.\n\nP=KE/ D/A\n\nErza: 591px(175 cm or 68.9 inches)\n\nSword Length:331px(38.58866328257191 inches)\n\nSword Width: 18 px(2.1 inches)\n\nArea of sword:\n\nP=KE/ D/A\n\nP=11,814,512,144,166.9 kgx184,837,262.3739922 m/s(61.65%c)\n\nD=1,704.2265 m\n\nA=80.97464468882175 sqaure inches\n\nP=2.924950245761383e+24 Pascals or 424.228 Quntillion Psi\n\nErza’s Slashing Pressure:424.228 Quintillion Psi\n\nThis is over 29.24 times Pressure inside the core of a white dwarf at the Chandrasekhar limit, Erza’s is actually exerting as much pressure from her sword strike as a Neutron star’s Surface pressure. Now that we got the pressure of Erza’s slash.\n\nErza within the instant of the slash also completely dispersed the immense fireball within the Upper Atmosphere roughly the size of the Continental United States and tanked the kinetic shockwave caused by the dispersing.\n\nAs we know fires can be dispersed by explosive shockwaves.\n\nThe Swedish Air Force dropped a laser-guided bomb on a forest fire to help suppress the flames. The idea here is to snuff out fires the way you’d blow out birthday candles at the base. In Sweden, the shockwave from a single bomb snuffed out flames within a 100-yard radius of the impact point. Going by 100 meters equalling 1,000,000 m^3 caused by the Mark 82 bombs.\n\nwww.endmemo.com/cconvert/m3m.p…\n\nThe Mark 82 bombs pack about 89 kg of Tritonal high explosives, which can produce around 421.3 megajoules, going by division, that means that a typical explosive shockwave can generate about 421.3 J/m^3, now imagine the flames.\n\nVolume of Fireball:1.277569121808e+18 m^3\n\nDenisty of Air:1.225 kg/m^3\n\nMass of the Atmosphere:1.5650221742148e+18 kg\n\n6.593438419966952e+20\n\n659 343 841 996 695 100 000 joule = 157 586.960 32 megaton [explosive]\n\nErza’s Slashing Secondary Shockwave:157.586 Gigatons of TNT(Large Island Level)\n\nAssuming Low End, Erza would be exterting roughly 2.12 times the force as the Toba Eruption, a Mega Eruption 70,000 years ago that almost wiped out humanity and that’s purely the shockwave alone indirectly caused by the meteor, enough to put out a 4.172 Trillion Gallon Oil Fire or 99.33 Billion Barrels of oil. That’s over 99 times the enegery burned by the Kuwaiti Oil Fires that took over 6 months to put out, with a single instantaneous sword swing.\n\nNow for the thermal power to completely put out flames instantly.\n\nVaporization of Oxygen:213,125 J/kg\n\nThe temperature of Atmospheric Entry:3,825 °C\n\nAverage Atmospheric temperatures: -15 C\n\nMass of the Atmosphere:1.5650221742148e+18 kg\n\nExplosive shockwave:421.3 J/m^3\n\n3,825 °C – -15 C=3840°C\n\n1.5650221742148e+18 kgx213,125 J/kgx3840°C\n\n1.280814147377392e+27 Joulesx421.3 J/m^3\n\n5.396070002900952e+29 Joules\n\n5.396070002900952e+29 joule = 128 969 168 330 000 megaton [explosive]\n\nErza’s Slashing Primary Shockwave: 128.969 Exatons of TNT(Moon Level+)\n\nSo even with the direct shockwave caused by the meteor being destroyed in the air that’s more than 4 times the force needed to destroy the moon via GBE.\n\nNow for the fragments of the meteor scattered across the area\n\nMeteor Fragment Length and width: 12px(34.4m)\n\nMeteor Fragment Height:29px(83.133 m)\n\nMeteor volume:98,376.26688 m^3\n\nDensity of Rock:22,590 kg/m^3\n\nMass:2,222,319,868.8192 kg(1/50,314th the meteor’s mass)\n\nThe fragments being flung are much slower than the meteor reaching 9km in under 3 seconds giving the fragments a speed of 3,000 m/s, far slower than average meteors.\n\nEach of the meteor fragments falling down would produce roughly 2.39 Megatons of TNT which is still a devasting city buster.\n\nDeus Sema broken meteor fragments:2.39 Megatons of TNT (Small City level+)\n\nThis is more or less equal to the power of One Russian R-12 missle pre fragment and as seen with the damage to mountains, each fragment is fatal.\n\nConsidering there are potentially 50,314 meteor fragments of this size if all of them are combined, the combined might of these fragments would be up to 120.251 Gigatons of TNT, that’s nearly 6 times the combined World’s Nuclear Stockpile in 1960 at over 20 Gigatons.\n\nThankfully most of the meteor fragments seem to have been destroyed by friction alone and the few remaining crashed into mountains.\n\nnow for the cutting force of her attack.\n\nThe meteor as we know is roughly 1,704.2265 m or roughly 67095.53in, adding Cirfurimfance of the slash, that is 210679.9642 inches across when you factor the slash of roughly 80.97464468882175 inches, the slashing force of Erza should be roughly 4.989887679499683e+31 Joules or 11 926 117 781 000 000 megatons or over 11.926 Zettatons of TNT to generate enough force to completely fragment the Asteroid with it’s intense slashing pressure.\n\nErza’s Hidden Potential Slash:11.926 Zettatons of TNT(Small Planet level+)\n\nErza is slashing with roughly 10.42 times the GBE of Mars which would require over 1.144 zettatons of TNT to essentially destroy the planet Mars.\n\nOr over 1.51 times the energy released by the sun daily which is 7.89 zettatons, all of this enegery released by Erza in presumably less than a second.\n\nNow that’s a shit ton of crazy destructive power Erza is unleashing at once. And this is not counting the fact she’s only using one hand……YES, THAT AMOUNT OF POWER WITH ONE HAND!\n\nYou can argue that with all but her right hand broken, this was only 25% of Erza’s hidden potential. Now, how strong would Erza be at 100% power with potential unlocked?\n\nMpultying this by 4 times and you get roughly 47.704 Zettatons of TNT as the striking potential for Erza, that’s on par with the Theia Collison with Earth that created the Moon.\n\nErza’s attack Potency would surpass that of Piccolo in the Radtiz fight and be strong enough to potentially kill Radtiz with her strongest sword slash as her attack potency is at least 2.75 times that of Piccolo’s Destructive Wave against the moon which is accepted at 17.34 Zettatons of TNT.\n\nErza likely is able to harness this potential power in the form of the Belserion sword.\n\nA sword infused with Dragon Slayer Magic from her deceased mother’s blood(Likely the same Katana Irene committed suicide with)\n\nAnd can likely chance her already high potential output combining it with her armors\n\nAnd with the stakes being raised even higher in the recent Fairy Tail 100-year quests as seen with a massive small country sized Dragon, it’s likely Erza might get a further major upgrade.\n\nDeus Sema Meteor vs HST Meteors.\n\nAs i did before we’re going to be comparing the meteors to its sister series.\n\nGremmy’s meteor is about half the size of Deus Sema but traveling at FAR slower speeds, it seems to be traveling around average Meteor speed.\n\nThe 851-meter meteor the size of the Bronx Zoo seemed to travel at least 72km/sec which is enough to give this meteor up to 1.14 Teratons of TNT (Small Country level)\n\nFiujitora’s meteors vary in size however what should be noted is that while his method of attracting meteors is slmair to Irene’s meteor feat, it’s nowhere near as fast nor as powerful.\n\nAfter all, unlike Fairy Tail, One Piece has hundreds of floating Islands and Fujitora has shown the ability to easily elevate the entire Islands and turn them into Pseudo Meteors hence the distance would be far shorter, it does not say Fujotira can’t pull an Irene but for the most part that’s pure speculation for the time being.\n\nAs opposed to Irene who ripped hers straight from space with no Ambiguity of its origin.\n\nBut Fuijtora’s meteors are still fast regardless and he can produce potentially a 15km Asteroid from the debris of Dressora.\n\nAssuming Fujotira sends this mass of rubble the size of Manhattan into the sky and drops it 72km/sec, the massive Concrete asteroid would impact with the force of 4.19904e+25 joules or 10 Petatons of Force, over 100 times the destructive force of the infamous Chicxulub Crater , making this deadly missle Multi Continent Level however it’s still not even 1/10,000th the destructive force of Deus Sema.\n\nMadara’s meteors despite being 8km wide or nearly 5 times the size of Deus Sema\n\nA meteor nearly twice the size of Central Park is moving at a far slower speed than Deus Sema with an asteroid rivaling the size of the one that killed the Dinosaurs purposely dropped one slower than average speeds but then drops one at much faster speeds.\n\nIf anything it’s confirmed in the Last movie that Debris from the Moon exists as a small Asertiod field between Earth and the moon in the Naruto world as it’s remnants of the moon that Juubi was sealed into. Using a conservative timeframe of at least 100km/sec as it took that long for the meteor to appear(It’s likely Madara could easily drop them much faster), this massive Asteroid would produce at least 7.68e+24 Joules or 1 .835 Petatons of TNT, a Contitent destroying Asteroid but puny compared to Deus Sema.\n\nThe closest feats to compare to Deus Sema would Rock Lee smashing the meteorite fragment of the moon however this required at least a team of Shinobi who also knew the Gates technique( Which honestly makes no sense on a narrative level) ignoring that it took from 1:04:14 to 1:04:34 before these meteorites reach Earth’s Atmosphere that’s roughly 20 seconds giving each Meteorite roughly 19,200,000 m/s speed which is 6% the speed of Light or just 10% the speed of Deus Sema.\n\nvsbattles.fandom.com/wiki/User…\n\nThese fragments are scalable to that of the Hokage Mountain. Given this calc above gives the meteor dimensions of 469 .22m diameter and around 185 meters high with the weight of 62,107,477,383.9kg,\n\nThis meteor would be roughly the size of Yankee Stadium,at the speed of 19,200,000 m/s, this would give our space warhead roughly 1.144765023140045e+25 joules or 2.736 Petatons of TNT, nearly twice the power of Madara’s Meteor with less than 24,731 times the mass of Madara’s asteroid however still nowhere near Deus Sema’s destructive force.\n\nThis would make all the Kages up to Continent Level+ in the Last Movie which makes them stronger than when they fought Madara. Dividing the output of attacks by 6, Rock Lee would have the attack potency of 456 Teratons of TNT, so yeah Large Country level Rock lee confirmed.\n\nEven the Asteroid Saitama smashed pales in comparison despite having nearly the same size as Deus Sema and of comparable distances.\n\nwww.narutoforums.org/xfa-blog-…\n\nGoing by the size, the Asteroid is at least 787.238 meters high and 664.058 meters in diameter with a volume of 181,767,694.1 m^3 and the mass of 1,041,452,172,347.942 kilograms.That’s roughly the size of the Manhattan Bridge.\n\nThe Asteroid was confrimed a Near Earth Object meaning it would be around 7,500,000 km from the earth, it took about 35 minutes before the Asteroid hits the earth making the meteor moving at 3,571,428.57 m/s or Mach 10,412.33 (1.182% SoL).\n\nThe Meteor at that speed would impact the earth at 6.641914359150384e+24 joules or 1.587 Petatons, over 15 times the destructive force of the Asteroid that killed the Dinosaurs.\n\nStill nowhere near the destructive force of Deus Sema.\n\nThe speed of Deus Sema\n\nSo how is Deus Sema so destructive despite its small size, simple, Velocity.\n\nFor example, a Missle Launcher shoots a Missle typically weighing around 7 pounds or 3.18kg’s which typically hit with the explosive force of explosive yield at around 2.1 kg of explosives or roughly 8 786 400\n\nYet in Fallout 4, the Gauss Rifle hits at roughly 81% of the force of a Missle Launcher,\n\njoules\n\ndespite firing a puny 2mm bullet, which as we know is fired from the smallest handgun in the world which produces a measly 4 Joules of enegery or only 35 PS1 which is barely enough to penetrate skin ,\n\nBut what if we gave the smallest handgun in the world with the speed of Deus Sema.\n\nE=MXC^2/2\n\nE=0.00001295978kgx215,113,674.9557411 m/s (71.7 % c)/2\n\nE=299,849,737,502.9614 Joules.\n\n299 849 737 502.961 4 joule = 71.665 807 243 ton [explosive]\n\nYep by giving this puny little handgun which can barely dent plywood\n\nTo a gun that surpasses any conventional weapon on the planet with the force capable of matching the force of 3.55 Davy Crockets\n\nMaking it kinda this gun the scary hybrid child of a Nuclear Handgun\n\nAnd the Nosy Cricket from MLB.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nThe final stats of Deus Sema\n\nFinal distance of Deus Sema: 554,511,787 meters\n\nThe final speed of the Asteroid:184,837,262.3739922 m/s(61.65%c)\n\nDeus Sema’s Atmospheric Shockwave: 3.15 Petatons of TNT (Continent Level+)\n\nThe thermal energy of Deus Sema impacting the Atmosphere: 306.121 Petatons of TNT(Multi Continent Level+)\n\nDeus Sama Cloud Parting energy: 87.327 Exatons of TNT(Moon Level +)\n\nIrene’s Deus Sama: 456.515 Exatons of TNT (Small Planet Level)\n\nErza’s Speed:215,113,674.95 m/s (71.7 % SoL/Realsitstvic+)\n\nErza’s Kinetic Impact against Deus Sema: 618.318 Exatons of TNT(Smal Planet level+)\n\nDeus Sema broken meteor fragments:2.39 Megatons of TNT (Small City level+)\n\nErza’s Slashing Secondary Shockwave:157.586 Gigatons of TNT(Large Island Level)\n\nErza’s Slashing Primary Shockwave: 128.969 Exatons of TNT(Moon Level+)\n\nErza’s Slashing Pressure:424.228 Quintillion Psi\n\nErza’s Hidden Potential Slash:11.926 Zettatons of TNT(Small Planet level+)\n\nAnd now for the final Verdict of Irene’s power overall.\n\nIrene Belserion( Dragon Civil War)\n\nPowers and Stats\n\nTier: High Meta-Human ( 6A )\n\nName: Irene Belserion, Scarlet Despair, High Enchanter\n\nOrigin: Fairy Tail\n\nGender: Female\n\nAge: 400+\n\nClassification: Dragon (formerly a human dragon slayer), Mage\n\nPowers and Abilities: Superhuman Physical Characteristics, Longevity, Enchantment Magic, Flight, Senses, Can extract and bestow power on others with enough time, Fire Manipulation, Explosion Manipulation, Possession, Debuffing Limited Durability Negation against Dragons (Can bypass the durability of dragons, and those with dragon-like properties), Magic Resistance Negation\n\nAttack Potency: At least Multi Continent level via powerscaling( One of the strongest humans of the era before becoming a Dragon Slayer, became queen merely by magical power alone long before she developed Dragon Slayer Magic.

An arena roughly 4 times the size of the largest stadium in the world. Given the mass of Grand Magic Games is 19,443,459,129.40597kg and the bare minimum heat he’s exerting is over 1,500°C degrees and generating 821.46 joules per kg against Fall Temperatures of 12°C., the mere heating energy alone would require over 2.376637161742544e+16 Joules of Energy or 5.68 Megatons of TNT in pure heating energy alone.\n\nThat’s enough Heating Energy to literally set almost the entire city of New York in flames engulfing most of the city in flames along with Yonkers Newark and as far as Paterson Country. This is the equipment of more than B-83 Nuclear Warheads. Natsu can somehow contain and concentrate the flames only on the stage itself and not melt people to death with it and not set the rest of Corcus ablaze with such heating energy.\n\nSo confirmed City level+ fodder characters for Second timeskip, especially since they can harm a suppressed casual Natsu.\n\nB Ranked Mages(Second Timeskip)\n\nNaturally, All B ranked mages should be far stronger than Frist Timeskip via powerscaling, if mere B rank mages could match Post Teneoru Island Arc Natsu being at least Mountain Island, then they’re at bare minimum Island level if not Large Island level, especially powerscaling to Bisca.\n\nWho’s able to wield the Jupiter Canon which is pretty much confirmed Large Island Level in attack potency using it almost entirely herself.\n\nBisca might be Low A rank even going by the fact she can harm Ajeel ablet catching himoff-guard doing considerable damage to the Spppargain 12 member. Logically the more fit and powerful B rank mages should be comparable to Bisca Second Timeskip. Avtar as a whole scales to Bisca.\n\nCharacters on this level\n\nSecond Skip Macao\n\nSecond Skip Wakaba\n\nSecond Skip Bisca\n\nSecond Skip Alzack\n\nSecond Skip Jet\n\nSecond Skip Droy\n\nAvatar Guild as a whole\n\nA Rank Mages(Second Timeskip)\n\nNatsu and Gray despite not being S Class no longer count as A Rank given Gray has powered up Devil Slayer Magic which boosts him greatly and Natsu can use Dragon Force and Blaze King Mode.\n\nMarakov’s Hand: 45px(1.87m)\n\nMarakov’s body:245px(10.18m)\n\nNow for the Tsunami itself.\n\nMarakov’s height:23px(10.18m)\n\nTsunami Height:309px(136.7m)\n\nNow for the length of the wave.\n\nSand Wave Height and Width: 11px(136.7m)\n\nSand Wave Length:452 px(5,617.13m)\n\nThe volume of Sand Wave:104,966,639.46 m^3\n\nSand :1650 kg/m^3\n\nMass of the Sand Wave:173,194,955,111.4 kg or 1.73×10^11kg\n\nNow for the speed.

Gray’s statements are very clear that Brandish alone surpassed anything previously fought, WHICH INCLUDES HADES! Even Gray comments her magical power was above Tenerou Island Marakov which is Large Country level+\n\nWith her potential being calced potentially in the Multi-Continental range if she turned herself massive like Marakov.\n\nIn fact, let’s read about what her powers can do.\n\nfairytail.fandom.com/wiki/Comm…\n\nCommand T is a Magic that allows the user to alter mass,[1] lest it be expansion[2] or reduction;[3] the user can direct the effects of their Magic towards virtually whatever they desire, allowing them to affect, for example, landmass in such a way that it becomes the size of a mountain,[4] or the size of a small boulder.[5] Humans (and other living species[6] and the user) are also susceptible to this particular form of Magic, and can either be expanded to titanic proportions[7] or be shrunk to minuscule sizes, however, in the case of the latter, to onlookers not aware of this Magic’s effects, the act of reduction can appear one of disintegration.[3] The acts of expansion and reduction can also be isolated to specific body parts\n\nIn other words, Brandish can manpauilte mass on an Atomic level… Does that sound eerily familiar?\n\nEtherion, once successfully prepared, fires an extremely large, destructive beam of Magic upon the desired location[9] (said Magic contains Fire Magic, among other elements),[14] that completely obliterates the target area, leaving only dust behind.[15] It’s energy is strong enough to reduce matter down to their smallest components\n\nIn other words, we’re talking about complete Atomisation of an enemy target. Brandish’s Command T and the “Country Demolisher” Monkier given to her is literally in lore comparing her powers to that of Ehterion itself.\n\nIn fact, Brandish is comparable to Etheriton as both are said to be capable of destroying entire countries, let’s now picture what a bloodlusted Brandish could do by going with what Ehtertion is shown to be capable of doing.\n\nAtomization: Applied only if clearly stated. It describes the energy to separate all atoms in a chemical substance. The value is 30852.2 (j/cc).\n\nthe average country size calculated from 194 world countries is 767 731 sq km (around the size of Turkey) Let’s round off the following countries to see which fits the closest to the area of a country and then have it atomized.\n\nFiore: 106 px/106 px( 330km^2/108,900 sq km)\n\nStella:100px/100px(311.3km^2/96,845.44 sq km)\n\nBosco:73 px/123 px(227.3kmx382.9km/87038.745 sq km)\n\nIceberg: 159 px/143px(495kmx445.2km/220,374 sg km)\n\nSeven: 121px/184px(376.7kmx572.83 km/215,785.132 sq km)\n\nDessrerito:87px/210px(270.84kmx653.8km/177,068 sq km)\n\nMidi: 67px/96px(208.6kmx298.9km/62,343.84 sq km)\n\nCaleulm:65px/282px(202.3584kmx877.924 sq km/177,655.4 sq km)\n\nMinstrel:273px/278px(849.9kmx865.47km/735,559.49 sq km)\n\nJoya:91px/65px(283.332kmx202.37km/57338.78sqkm)\n\nBellum:103px/131px(320.66 kmx407.8km/130,766 sq km)\n\nSin:54px/173px(168.12kmx538.545 km/90540.19 sq km)\n\nEnca:49px/129px(152.553kmx401.57km/61,261.325 sq km)\n\nPregrande Kingdom: 463px/545px(1,441.42kmx1696.7km/2,445,662.92 km)\n\nTotal area of known Isghal(All known countries:4,667,139.26240916 sq km\n\nSize of Isghal overall:8,048,456.73214 sq km(81% the size of Europe)\n\n4,829,074.039 sq km Land Area (62.8% the size of Austarila)\n\n3,219,382.69 sq km Water Area\n\nNow for the country in question. Fiore is considered a small country so we won’t use that as a scale, we would use a considerably larger country of considerable Area, let’s go with Minsterl since it fits the closest to being Average country size and use the forulma needed to destroy more than 735,559.49 square kilometers of the country.\n\nAssuming the blast works just like a nuke, you would need to be at least 3 meters below the ground in a safe shelter to have somewhat of a chance assuming you’re not at Ground Zero itself\n\nArea atomized by Ehteriton:735,559,490,000,000 cm^3\n\nPotential depth of ground destroyed:3,000,000 cm^3\n\nDensity of Rock:2.7 g/cm^3\n\n1.838183908287618e+26 joule = 43 933 649 816 megaton [explosive] or 43.933 Petatons of TNT ( Muilt Continetal Level+)\n\nEhteriton’s destructive capacity: 43.933 Petatons of TNT ( Multi-Continental Level+)\n\nThis is roughly 439 times the destructive power of the Impact that killed the Dinosaurs concentrated into a Country destorying blast that can literally atomize anything within a whole country.\n\nconvertalot.com/asteroid_impac…\n\nGoing by this Calculator of asteroid’s, this blast would generate a crater from the ruins of the country roughly 396,977.2636749119 meters in Diameter and up to 99,244.32 meters deep.\n\nThat’s a depth greater than the Crust of the earth and into the Upper Mantle with a crater roughly 157,590.738 sq kilometers wide, enough to bury the entire country of Bangladesh within the massive crater.\n\nAs for the planet itself, it’s pretty much fucked. Even if you fired the blast towards the Ocean far north from civilization in the real world, it would essentially vaporize the entire Northern Hemisphere in a planteary fireball expanding more than half the planet in seconds.\n\nIf you live in Southern Africa, Southeastern Asia, Asurtila and South American within the Southern Hemisphere, you might have enough time to see the massive fireball and would be the last thing you see before going blind and being blasted by a massive shockwave that would engulf the entire planet and blow down any buildings within the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nIt should be well noted that Wall Ehto has exactly the same destructive Capacity via his own Ehtertion canon which is said to be equally as powerful if not more so than the one used by the Magic Council given Wall Ehto is at least 2.5 times Brandish level who is herself a walking Etheriton Canon and merely took him a minute to charge up the Ehtertion canon whereas it took an hour for the canon to charge.\n\nSo yeah the Sparrgian 12 are confirmed at least Multi Continent level going by direct powerscaling from Wall Ehto Alone as well as Brandish. A massive world of difference from any previous villain stated. All Sparrigan 12 members scale to her own casual feats but also that of Ehteriton itself.\n\nAnd to prove my point here’s some individual feats from Sparrigan 12 level characters including the Sparrigan 12 themselves. First up Ajeel’ s sandstorm created by his Sand World attack.\n\nHe was able to engulf the entirety of the battlefield around Mongolia within a massive sandstorm in seconds. Going by the fact sand is 1.65 times denser than Water, the sand clouds Ajeel formed are easily 4.95 grams per Cubic Meter. Now time for the size of clouds, Windspeed and formation speed of the clouds.\n\nArea of Mongolia Town:61 px( 7160mx7160m=51,265,600 sq meters)\n\nLake Siclroia Length:442px(51,880.65 m)\n\nLake Siclroia Width: 158 px(18545.574 m)\n\nAjeel’s SandStorm Diameter: 445px(52,232.7811m)^\n\nThe thicknessss of Cloud: 12,000 m( It covered the sky and sea level\n\nCloud Volume:3,273,916,1057,286.21\n\nMass of Sand: 4.95 g/m^3 or 0.00495 Kilograms\n\nMass of the Cloud:162,058,847,233.5667 kg\n\nGoing by the anime, Ajeel summoned the sand clouds over Mongolia Instantly giving his Cloud formation speed 52,232 m/s speed or basically Mach 153.4926. Going by this, Ajeel casually produced 52.835 Gigatons of TNT forming the cloud alone. Now for Windspeeds\n\nGoing by Duststorm speed, it should have windspeeds moving at 22.352 m/s or 50 mph. This would give Ajeel casual energy of roughly 1.104457066939247e+23 joules or 26.397 Teratons of TNT given the Cloud formation speed and windspeed and this is a massive lowball.\n\nErza barely noticed the sudden change in the Manga from clear skies to Sandstorm meaing the sandstorm formed faster than Erza can even react and considering how fast Erza is…That’s saying something already.\n\nThis is Erza’s speed as of Second Timeskip\n\nBase=Mach 6,640 (Massively Hypersonic+)\n\nElemental Armors/Heaven’s Wheel Armor(X2 speed)= Mach 13,280 (Sub-Relativistic/1.5%SoL)\n\nBlack Wing Armor(X5 Speed)=Mach 33,200 (Sub-Relativistic/ 3.7%SoL)\n\nClear Heart Clothing/Rabbit Armor(X12.5 Speed)=Mach 83,000 (Sub-Relativistic+/ 9.42 %SoL)\n\nFairy Armor/Flight Armor(X25 Speed)= Mach 166,000 ( Relativistic+/ 18.84 %SoL)\n\nThe cloud would have to been moving at speeds comparable to her Black Wing Armor for her to be surprised of an instant sandstorm. Now the speed is 4,491,828m/s, this would make the cloud formation energy at 1.634891687464955e+24 joules or 390.748 Teratons of TNT or Large Country level+\n\nNow let’s include the wind speeds along with the cloud formation, that would be a potential maximum energy output of 4.084056744040696e+26 joules or 97.611 Petatons of TNT Which is Multi Continetial Level+\n\nWhich again fits the powerscaling of the Sparrigan 12 very well given Ajeel is shown to be comparable to Wall Eecht who’s superior to Brandish.\n\nSpeaking of which, Wal Itchi with a lesser feat was able to generate Pure Plasma and shoot it into the sky dispelling clouds around them\n\nvsbattles.fandom.com/wiki/Thre…\n\nGoing by the calcs, this is a casual Country level dispersion feat, especially if it’s producing up to 100 Million Kelvin heat energy.\n\nAnd then there’s Dimaria, who’s insane strength was enough to clash with Kahura near evenly.\n\nThe same Kagura who later effortlessly slashed down a hill with merely a pressure wave. While hardly an impressive large scale feat, the speed of the slash should equal Erza’s speed at 20% given she wasn’t going all out until she attempted and failed to slash down Lacacadre.\n\nSmall Tree: 54px(5 m)\n\nHill Length and width:796px (73.682 m)\n\nHill Height:308px(28.51 m)\n\nHeight Hill was uplifted:269px(24.9 m)\n\nVolume:154,781.84 m^3\n\nDensity:2,700 kg/m^3\n\nMass:417,910,990.694148 kg\n\nVelocity:4,491,828m/s\n\nForce:4.215994476385427e+21 Newtonsx24.9 m\n\n2.099565249239942e+23\n\n2.099565249239942e+23 joule = 50 180 813.796 megaton [explosive]\n\nKagura’s Casual Slash Attack Potency: 50.180 Teratons of TNT( Country level+)\n\nKeep in mind Dimaria held back the attack both presumably at 10% given this is base Dimaria and Kagura is at least half as strong as Erza. This would make Dimaria capable of holding back an attack that produces 2.1409607249e+22 kilogram-force meter or roughly the eqaulivent of holding back the mass of Tirion, the Largest Moon on Neptune, BTW just because I say holding back a mass eqaulivlent doesn’t mean that characters can hold back planets, it’s stating they can exert weight and force simlair to planetary mass, to hold a planet, you would need to exceed the GBE and hold back against the planet’s Gravity, Mass and Escape Velocity along with rotational Velocity.\n\nDimaria’s Lifting Strength(Potentially): Class Z\n\nDimaria’s Striking Strength: Class ZJ\n\nAs for God Serena, he was said to have destroyed the entire country of Bosco Nieghborhooding Fiore along with August and Jacob and curbstomped 4 Saint Wizards on par with Erza and Laxus sinlgehandely, this would put him above Dimaria by 5 times by sheer powerscaling alone and just below the 4 Strongest fighters of Alaverz.\n\nNow for Jacob and Natsu, this is where the fun part begins, Natsu during his fight with Jacob was able to casually melt and boil Lake Silcroia with his heat energy alone. As we established before in the Jupiter Canon feat, the lake is fucking huge.\n\nArea of Mongolia Town:61 px( 7160mx7160m=51,265,600 sq meters)\n\nLake Siclroia Length:442px(51,880.65 m)\n\nLake Siclroia Width: 158 px(18545.574 m)\n\nArea of Lake SIlcoria:962,156,421.8360656 m^3 or 962,156,421,836,065.6 cm^3\n\nNow for the depth of the Lake\n\nFairy Tail Guild: 370px(25.8 m)\n\nClif Height:238px(16.595 m)\n\nNow for the lake’s depth.\n\nFairy Tail Guild:40px (25.8 m)\n\nCillf depth:438px(282.51 m)\n\nNow subtract that from Clif heigh and lake.\n\n282.51m-16.595 m\n\nLake Sicorila Depth:265.915 m\n\nNow for the volume of the Lake.\n\n265.915 mx51,880.65 mx18545.574 m\n\nVolume of Lake Siclroia:255,851,828,078.7964 m^3 or 2.558518280787964e+17 cm^3\n\nThe density of Water: 1,000 kg/m^3\n\nMass of Lake Sciloria:255,851,828,078,796.4 kg or 2.55×10^14kg or 67,588,902,237,478.61 Gallons of water\n\nNow for the vaporization of water\n\nThe specific heat capacity of water is 4181 J/kg°K\n\nNatsu’s Flames: At least 1,000,000 degrees( Far hotter than Lightning Flame Dragon Mode at 28,000)\n\nGoing by statements from the manga, Natsu’s flames should be comparable to that generated by Nukes within the first Milliseconds putting his heating energy at 1,000,000 degrees going far beyond his heating capacity.\n\nAverage fall temperatures: 12 degrees celius\n\n1,000,000-12=999,988\n\n2.558487578568595e+23 joule = 61 149 320.711 megaton [explosive]\n\nNatsu’s Blaze King Dragon mode’s Heating Energy/Vaporization of Lake Siclroia: 61.149 Teratons of TNT(Country level+)\n\nAnd this was merely Natsu powering up that effortlessly melted a lake with flames so intense that it instantaneously melted a massive lake.\n\nNeihart is at least strong enough to nearly kill Jellal at 10% of Jellal’s base power. And summon Historia’s powerful enough to harm Erza despite their alive forms being inferior to weaker versions of Erza.\n\nAnd can summon Hades at his full strength who was able to toss around Marakov.\n\nNow for Jellal and his Grand Chariot Feat, yeah you’re wondering why I’m factoring Jellal here since he’s not shown anything impressive here, well you’re wrong. When doing his setup to Grand Chariot, he disprised all the clouds surrounding Fiore and created a magical aura making the day appear to be nighttime.\n\nGiven the ships stretch out to as far as 30km from Hargeon, the cloud is no smaller than the one Ajeel created, however, it’s moving at much faster speeds so time for Jellal’s cloud dispersion feat.\n\nCloud Diameter:At least 60,000 meters\n\nCloud Thickness:At least 8,000 meters\n\nCloud Volume:28,800,000,000,000 m^3\n\nColud Density: 3 g/m^3\n\nMass of cloud:86,400,000,000\n\nJellal’s speed:56,488,140m/s\n\n1.378473103004947e+26 joule = 32 946 297 873 megaton [explosive]\n\nJellal’s Cloud Dispersion/Grand Chariot Attack Potency:32.946 Petatons of TNT ( Multi-Continental Level+)\n\nBase Natsu Holding back: 0.25 to 0.5 Brandish\n\nNatsu full power base: 2.5x to 5 Brandish\n\nBlaze King Mode Natsu: 10 to 50 Brandish\n\nPartial END Mode: 500 Brandish\n\nWendy:0.5 Brandish base, 5 Brandish Dragon Force, up to 50 Brandish using Ehcantments+Dragon Force\n\nErza: 2.5x to 5 Brandish base,10 to 50 Brandish using weaker armors, 100 Brandish using stronger Armors, 500 Brandish full power\n\nGray: 0.25 to 0.5 Brandish base holding back, 5 Brandish full power base, 50 Brandish Devil Slayer Mode, 500 Brandish Demonized Gray\n\nLucy:0.5 Brandish, 5 to 10 Brandish potentially using Uno Materia\n\nGod Serena:10 Brandish base, 100 Brandish Dragon Force/Hybrid Mode\n\nDimaria: 10 Brandish base, 100 Brandish God Soul\n\nAjeel:10 to 50 Brandish\n\nBrandman:2.5x to 5 Brandish\n\nWal Itchi: 2.5x to 5 Brandish\n\nJacob: 2.5x to 5 Brandish\n\nNeihart: 2 Brandishs.\n\nBrandish: Standard Method of Test\n\nSS Class /Top Sparrigan Level\n\nAnd this is where you get into the heavy hitters of the verse itself, the top 4 Sparrigan 12 members and the Ultra elite mages. First, we go for the weakest of the 4 Inveel.\n\nWe already esbtlaished that Inveel is on a league of his own in terms of attack potency casually generating a Large Country level+ freezing feat worth around 800 Teratons dispelsiring Gray’s Ice Devil slash\n\nWe also have Laracade who effortlessly tanked Kagura’s strongest slash with merely his fingertips despite having casual Country level attack potency.\n\nBut even that pales in comparison to the Queen of Dragons herself Irene Belseiron.\n\nEven before she became the Queen of Dragons, she was said to be the most powerful human alive and said to be even above most dragons(Ingeel being an obvious exception) with Irene stating she became queen merely by magical power alone long before she developed Dragon Slayer Magic.\n\nWho within the flashback was said to been a queen since she was at least a Teenager.\n\nA queen in a country of Humans and Dragons.\n\nAnd was shown within flashback prior to becoming a Dragonslayer wielding a blade possibly capable of killing Fodder Tier Dragons and shown fighting alongside Dragons.\n\nThe same ones who can casually destroy cities with a stomp.\n\nCasually destroyed entire Mountains.\n\nAnd no sell hits from Grand Magic Games Arc Kagura. And were too powerful even for Dragon Slayers to even kill.\n\nYet going by Irene’s statement, she was strong enough to defeat Average Dragons within her heyday before becoming a Dragon Slayer.\n\nAnd comes from a long line of powerful human rulers who can keep up with the likes of Ingeel.\n\nThis would put her at least Multi Continent level Pre Dragon Slayer Magic given that Dragon scales can resist attacks from Small Country level and Country level character so even without Dragon Slayer magic, she’s insanely powerful. It’s honestly not far off considering how monsterously powerful she is currently.\n\nThis is further backed by the fact that she was stated to be able to Enchant already powerful Dragons by the thousands during the war and her country was confident that her enchantment Magic alone could win the Dragon War.\n\nA war that was said to beyond any human war.\n\nA war against Dragons, some which can achieve Sub-Relativistic speeds crossing a whole continent within a minute and covering almost as much Square Kilometers within a continent a minute.\n\nThis is further displayed in the Alaverz Arc as she casually enchanted over 1 million Soldiers to have the same attack Potency as Base Erza without breaking a sweat.\n\nThe same soldiers who can challenge a Surpessed Base Natsu in attack Potency.\n\nAnd Gray himself commenting that Alaverz Soldiers are much stronger than average fodder previously.\n\nSo basically imagine the already super strong Dragons, 10,000 of them or so each enchanted to be 10 times their already high power, the same dragons Dragon Slayers couldn’t kill? The same Dragons Natsu couldn’t flinch even with Dragon Slayer powers without Hellfire flames from Altas Flames.\n\nAnd only grew far more powerful once she obtained Dragon Slayer Magic.\n\nAnd going by statements from Ancologia that she learned techniques from Zeref. And the fact even Zeref was surprised by her trump card, she didn’t seem to get much weaker over time quite the opposite.\n\nHer mere energy alone casually melted Mount Zonia in seconds and dispersed the Snowstorm premenatly covering the region in a split-second. This is a twofold feat for this is both a melting energy heat feat and a Cloud dispersion feat in one which is beyond crazy.\n\nfairytail.fandom.com/wiki/Zoni…\n\nZonia (ゾニア Zonia) is a mountain located in northern Fiore.\n\nGoing this I found the possible mountain range where the mountain is at. Also going by Mount Haboke, it’s a region that snows all year round as well.\n\nfairytail.fandom.com/wiki/Mt._…\n\nMt. Hakobe is a high mountain with a characteristic alpine climate. Snow cover lasts all year-round in this mountain, no matter what season. There are also frequent snow blizzards.[1] Access is possible only to a certain altitude, at which point it is necessary to move on foot.[1] Its characteristics include the occurrence of numerous caves where the shelters are different representatives of the local fauna and flora.\n\nwww.livescience.com/30097-the-…\n\nGoing by the snowest place on earth Niseko, Japan , the depth of the snow snowing all year round should easily be 15 meters deep of snow around the Mountain Range stretching a whole range.\n\nweather.com/news/news/earths-c…\n\nOn Feb. 6, 1933, an observer, there, measured a temperature of -89.8 degrees Fahrenheit!

Ging by sheer mass alone, the energy needed to move a single Continental Plate even at 1 meter per second would require at the very least 4.0678242e+22 joules or 9.277 Teratons of TNT, nearly 1/10th the power of the Dinosaur-killing Asteroid that struck earth 65 Million years ago and this is merely moving the plate at a measly 1 Meter Per second which is slower than a human’ average walking speed\n\nNow for the fun part, moving the continental plates at with the alleged timeframe from Brandish, would that make Irene’s Universe One feat plausible?\n\n4.0678242e+21 joulesx1,922m/s^2/2\n\n7.5134421460164e+27 joule = 1 795 755 771 000 megaton [explosive] or 1.795 Exatons of TNT (Multi Continent level+)\n\nconvertalot.com/earthquake_pow…\n\nSuch tentotic movements would generate a 14.7 Managigute Earthquake, this earthquake would literally shake the very foundation of the world itself.

Going by this comic vine respect thread, they pointed out this very important note.\n\nThe chunks of the meteor that were sent flying were destroying tall, rock spires around the battlefield. Mashima isn’t the greatest at all when it comes to scaling, but I’ll point out the FT Guild Hall compared/relatively compared to some of the rock spires that were destroyed:\n\nWhich makes me completely rethink the entire feat itself, especially with recalculations of the Fairy Tail Guild so let’s redo things.\n\nLet’s recap the feat with the Lake Siclroia scaling feat.\n\nFairy Tail Guild:40px (25.8 m)\n\nCillf depth:438px(282.51 m)\n\nNow for redoing the scaling with the mountain.\n\nFairy Tail Guild: 16px(25.8m)\n\nZeref’s Mountain: 96px(154.8 m)\n\nDistance between Gildarts and the mountain 669px(1,078.76 m)\n\nYeah, this calc is very cute, however now that we have a possible timeframe of this feat thanks to the Brandish calc and learned several things since then, let’s revise this and see what we get this time.\n\nGuild:9px(25.8 m)\n\nMeteor Fragment Length and width: 12px(34.4m)\n\nMeteor Fragment Height:29px(83.133 m)\n\nArea length:861px(2,468.19m)\n\nMeteor Fragment:10px(83.133 m)\n\nMeteor diameter:205px(1,704.2265 m)\n\nHowever, one detail is missed by many calcers of Deus Sama. It’s an Ultimate Enchantment spell, hence it’s moving through space at impossible speeds.\n\nAnd Irene’s enchantment skills pre Dragon Slayer powers was enough to make Wood cut straight through Iron.\n\nSo needless to say the meteor itself might be alot denser than it looks. Now let’s do this with the density of Osmium since the meteor is moving at unnatural speeds just for the fuck of it really.\n\nscienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.ph…\n\nOsmium is the most dense metal! Many people are familiar with lead (11.3 kg/L), but osmium is twice as dense (22.6 kg/L)! Each liter (about 1/4 gallon) of osmium weighs 22.6 kg (50 lbs). For comparison, each liter of water weighs only 1 kg (~2.2 lbs). Some other heavy metals include tungsten and gold (19.3 kg/L), which are almost as dense as osmium.\n\n~22.6 g/cm3 –1 000 000 = 22,590 kg/m^3\n\nMeteor dimensions:205px(1,704.2265 m)^3\n\nThe volume of the meteor:4949734933.340722\n\nDensity of Rock:22,590 kg/m^3\n\nMass:111,814,512,144,166.9 kg\n\nVelocity:180,004,000 m/s\n\n1.811475604078764e+30 joule = 432 953 060 250 000 megaton [explosive] 433 Exatons of TNT (Small Planet Level)\n\nIrene’s Deus Sama: 433 Exatons of TNT (Small Planet Level)\n\nYep, now the meteor is literally capable of destroying all life on earth instantly via impact and would equal a massive Asteroid Impact of a massive Asteroid 170,000 meters wide and across impacting earth at 20km/sec. The surface area of the Asteroid in question would be 28,900 sq km which is slightly large than Albania, that would be the asteroid size equivalent to a Realststivc meteor under 2km.\n\nFirst, let’s factor Erza’s speed regarding her takeoff launch speed\n\nKeep in mind she threw herself up into the air with one arm, which is impressive in itself.\n\nClouds:12km\n\nMeteor Velocity: 180,000km/sec\n\nErza’s reaction time:0.00011/sec\n\nErza’s weight presumably: 54.43 kg\n\nDistance achieved:At least 12 kilometers\n\nThe energy of Erza throwing herself to the meteor:3.1743576e+17 joules\n\nEnergy of Erza’s throw propelling herself:1 763 532 000 000 000 000 joule = 421.494 263 86 megaton [explosive] (Mountain Level)\n\nNow for the feat itself smashing the meteor into fragments. Fragmentation energy is 8j/cc. Erza tanked the meteor with no further injuries on her part despite being heavily injured already, this would give her up to 4.33 Exatons of TNT durability.\n\nEnough to survive Hashirama’s strongest attack and keep on going.\n\nConsidering Erza reached to a meteor that was moving at 60% speed of light, this would easily put her speed on par with the meteor with that turbo boost of power.\n\nYep thanks to the upgrades, Erza and Irene are now Small Planet level baseline, low-end Small Planet level which is a major upgrade to the verses power, especially with the God Tiers.\n\nErza Post Timeskip in 100-year quest should easily equal her mother in power with the Dragon Slayer Sword: Belserion giving her at least 433 Exatons of force in this state.\n\nAugust and Gildarts also scale to Erza’s Deus Sema smashing feat putting them roughly Small Planet level+ and bordering towards Light speed at 60-90% SoL each at their full power. Meaning powerscaling wise, they’re almost Raditz level!\n\nGod Tier characters\n\nThe Dragon Cry Movie which is actually mentioned within the manga (Making it canon) has the potential to destroy all of Isghal\n\nSize of Isghal overall:8,048,456.73214 sq km(81% the size of Europe)\n\nArea atomized by Dragon Cry:8,048,456,732,140,000 cm^3\n\nPotential depth of ground destroyed:3,000,000,000 cm^3 (Low End)\n\n70,000,000,000 cm^3 (High End)\n\nAtomization:30852.2 (j/cc)\n\n7.44937790373989e+29 joule = 178 044 404 970 000 megaton [explosive]\n\n4.693108079356131e+31 joule = 11 216 797 513 000 000 megaton [explosive]\n\nAttack Potency of Dragon Cry: 178.044 Exatons of TNT( Moon Level+) Low End\n\n11.216 Zettatons of TNT (Small Planet level+) High End\n\nIt should be noted that Animus is nowhere near Zeref’s level because at no point of the movie Natsu used Ingeels power to fight him, had he did that along with the END power up, the fight would’ve ended in seconds. In fact Natsu probably could’ve taken Animus easily with the Ingeel powered Blaze King Mode. It’s likely Animus at best would be on the same level as Erza’s full potential but hard to kill because of Dragon Scales at the lowest end and on the same tier as Dragon Irene at his highest tier going by feats.\n\nHowever let’s talk about possible time travel and the potency of Last Ages, which was able to reverse time across the entire planet for a single minute at the cost of her magic and Ultear’s magic power is literally nothing.\n\nIt was affected by the entire world of Earth with the reversing of time. To do something of this scale, the planet itself has to be traveling close to the speed of light for Relativity to kick in.\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_o…\n\nGoing by Orders of Magnitude, in order to achieve Planetary Time Travel via relativity moving at the Mass Enegery of Earth, you would need roughly 5.4×10^41 Joules of energy or roughly 129 Tenatons of TNT, which is Small Star level+, apporaching towards Star Level. This may seem massively outilerish at first but you also have to consider just how much more powerful Zeref is to Ultear via Fairy Heart by scaling with Zeref at the frist place. If a mere S Class character who’s fodder compared to Zered can make the Earth Rotate at Lightspeed at the cost of her life, what thinks Zeref can’t do the same casually with Fairy Heart?\n\nHowever, what does scale is Irene’s Deus Sama which is roughly at the ballpark of Small Planet Level range. Base Zeref should logically be superior to both August and Irene putting him at least 4.3 Zettatons of power with a bloodlusted Zeref being roughly 43 Zettatons of TNT force which is near Planet level. Multiply 43 Zettaons by at least 100, Zeref would be at least 4.3 Yottatons of TNT power eqauilvent which puts him at least Large Planet Level and that’s merely powerscaling from Irene’s Deus Sama. Hell going by Dragon Cry scaling from Animus, Zeref is at least 11.216 Zettatons in base given Natsu needed Ingeel’s power against him whereas Animus was defeated by a Semi Awakened END, At least 112.16 Zettaons Bloodlusted and upwards of 11.216 Yottatons powerscaling in Fairy Heart form and possibly scaled up to Small Star Level if he used Neo Eclipse.\n\nZeref then gets a major power boost from Fairy Heart to the point he’s able to effortlessly one shot Dragon Force Natsu post-Dragon Seed who gained a great power boost(Yeah they really shat the bed on the wirting at this point of the arc)\n\nNatsu with END powers combined with Namaka Bullshit powers was able to beat Zeref who is at least 100 times more powerful than the base. Powerscaling from Irene alone, Natsu and Zeref should be at the very least Planet Level+ and Lightspeed to FTL speed. Logically if an awakened Erza who reacted to a 60% SoL meteor is Relativistic+ and Zeref and Natsu are at least close to Light speed at 99.999% the speed of Light in their full powered forms bloodlusted, then Zeref via Fairy Heart is easily Faster than Light by sheer powerscaling by 100 times, especially if one can argue that Gildarts and August scaling from Erza are near Light Speed already.\n\nIt should be arguable that Neo Eclipse should be far superior to Ultears Last Ages which wrapped Earth’s Rotation energy at Mass Enegery speed and described as having “Infinite Energy”\n\nAnna herself compares the size of Neo Eclipse to that of an Orange, an Orange is roughly 40cm wide.\n\nGoing by the description, Neo Eclipse is comparable to a Mirco Black Hole as it’s said not even Light could escape it and Anna was confident it could kill even Ancologia.\n\nwww.omnicalculator.com/physics…\n\nGoing by Anna’s description, a 40 cm blackhole the size of an Orange has the mass of 45.1 Earths. Going back to Ultear’s feat of Earth’s Mass Energy, muplty that mass Enegery by 45.1 and you would get up to 5.8179 Tenakilotons which is Large Star level+.\n\nSadly this is debatable whether it can be used at all given Ichyia and Anna survived it.\n\nThough considering Ancologia literally as in the middle of Absorbing the mass, it would be more likely Ichyia survived not merely because Mashima can’t kill any good characters(Although that doesn’t help either) but because Ancologia was already in the middle of absorbing the Blackhole like object hence Ichyia escaped due to luck and bad writing.\n\nIt should be noted that Ancologia was only beaten via prep that required at least a whole continent worth of Magic for Lucy to use Fairy Sphere while Acnologia was on a ship( A weakness of Dragon Slayers being motion sick).\n\nAnd Natsu combining all the Dragon Slayers Flames into one in order to beat Ancologia post Ravines of Time so it’s Nigh Impossible to scale EoS Natsu or any character aside from Fairy Heart Zeref to Ancologia Post Ravines of time until further notice so Natsu’s power would cap at best Star level+ via Seven Flames Mode given Savage Dragon Force+END mode Natsu killed Fairy Heart Zeref and Seven Flames Natsu>Savage Dragon Force+END.\n\nAnd for those who want to claim this feat is riddciolus, I didn’t write the series, Mashima did, I’m merely showcasing what’s written here. It would utterly absurd to claim Ultear’s feat doesn’t count when it actually affected the plot, And even more ridiculous to claim characters who literally have “Infinite Energy” who can ltierally bend space and time don’t casually produce the mass-energy of earth when much weaker characters could do that.\n\nThat’s like claiming because Pell survived a Nuke( Which is one of the biggest Outliers in One Peice,) means that the Nuke wouldn’t have destroyed the capital city of Alabasta\n\nI ran out of space to put the final tally at so expect that in another journal, but first time to go to the rival series of Fairy Tail(Power level wise, definitely not writing wise) One Piece.\n\nwell I think we’re at a good point to talk about FGO so far at this point as we are now in the final stretch and all hell has broken loose this week. let’s go over everything that’s happened from episode 10 to 15.\n\nFirst we got the inroduction of one of the best big sis waifus in FGO, Quetzalcoatl. She pretty much charges into Uruk and takes on a hundred men with her herculean strength and performs lucha libre style on them. yeah she loves how there’s luchadores in the present era and loves the showmanship. she can be pretty adorable when you make her feel flustered. she leaves Uruk cause she already defeated a hundred foes and would return the following day for another hundred. this puts gilgamesh in a spot to order ritsuka and the others to defeat her and retrieve the axe of marduk as well. the axe that was once used to slit tiamat’s throat. we also see “Ishtar” having more chats with Ritsuka but her sneezes give away it’s not actually Ishtar talking to Ritsuka giving us more cute moments and of course Ritsuka uses his Harem EX skill to charm and get Jaguar Man(yes Jaguar Man not Warrior) to join the party as another contracted servant much to Ana’s dismay and Mash making sure Jaguar understands she’s the “official” servant lol Am I sensing Mash yandere there? lol\n\nthe following episode gives us another amazing battle as Quetz takes on everyone and pretty much one dominates them due to the fact one of her divine trait abilities being that she is a goddess of absolute good and no one who has any amount of good traits can harm her. So, had Ritsuka brought a servant with an evil trait then they may have had a change but even then Quetz is too fast and has too much power on her especially since her sun stone from the aztecs is on the field that further boosts her power. Ritsuka eventually beats her by showing her humanity’s will by diving from the sky after Ishtar gives him a lift to do a body slam on her. now falling from that height would’ve killed him but Quetz caught him after he passed out cause as he reveals Quetz loves humanity which made her fall for the guy and declare she loses and will be his newest servant. I loved how she gets all scary face on jaguar man lol man Quetz is too awesome and cute and I gotta give her VA props in how she manages to pull off japanese and spanish and FYI I think funimation had to pay extra money for the english dub VA they hired for Quetz. this episode ended with Gilgamesh being declared dead and Gil waking up in Kur aka Babylonia underworld.\n\nSo everyone in the next episode talk about how Gil died and how Merlin could still be there and then Quetz reveals Ishtar was never in the 3 goddess alliance but it was actually her sister Ereshkigal. After realizing Ereshkigal was involved it was decided Ishtar would take Ritskua and Mash to Kur to convince Ereshkigal to let go of Gil. Once they got there and realize Babylonia much like Greece was once a place where the gods and humans existed in the same plane of existence where things like the underworld could be accessed pretty easily. Ereshkigal has 7 gates where she asks a question and in turn you give up something… at least normally where Ishtar notices Ereshkigal called out Ritsuka by name and asked her who between Ishtar and Ereshkigal is the most beautiful. in the game you get these questions which would determine the difficulty of the fight but the anime only did one gate and skipped the other 6 but still funny in how Ishtar proclaims how she’s so beautiful she will always be picked till ereshkigal brought down her godly wrath on her sister lol so with each gate Ishtar lost more of her divinity till she shrank down to the size of tinker bell and rides on Fou who looks annoyed she’s on his back lol this also leads to them finding Gil who’s a soul at the moment and can’t help but laugh at Ishtar’s situation in how she shrank so much. once at the bottom they find Ereshkigal in monster form.\n\nSo, the battle with Ereshkigal was done very well and it added that bit of emotional depth in show and explaining why Ereshkigal is doing all of this. This also gave Mash another shot to show off her noble phantasm as she becomes the unbreakable shield that is powered by her will that can even withstand a god’s wrath. once Ereshkigal saw she lost we get a lot of adorable moments of her and see Ishtar and Ereshkigal taunt each other lol it’s literally Rin taunting Rin lol But basically you get to see why a lot of people put Ereshkigal as their top waifu. We also see the return of the mysterious old man as he cut Ereshkigal in half but what he cut was her alliance to the 3 goddesses’ alliance since they have a pact where they can’t attack each other making her free to do what she wants. Ereshkigal makes the promise she’ll appear when they need the help and we also see how Ishtar is too tsundere to admit she’s always worried about her baby sister as everything gets resolved in kur and Gil as his soul returns to his body discovers Enkidu’s body is missing which revealed Kingu is using Enkidu’s actual body which is why he can’t kill Gilgamesh.\n\nin the following episode we get a lot of focus on Ana this time as she lets her hood down and she shows how she’s gotten attached to an old lady who runs a flower shop and Ana’s true identity is technically revealed but that’s mostly something fate fans realize easily enough from her appearance alone. We also get a pretty epic fight between Quetz and Kingu and one of 2 very impressive physical feats Quetz performs as she throws the axe at the temple where Gorgon hid herself to cut her divinity. Mash sees how the humans captured by gorgon were being mutated into monsters only for Ritsuka to tell her to ignore them and Merlin explains how there’s nothing they can do for them as they’re too far gone to be saved and need to focus on gorgon. once there Gorgon appears in all her massive glory and whether cause she wants Ritsuka for personal reasons or something else she basically tries to convince him to forget saving humanity cause he should know how pointless humans are given our whole history and join her and be her master. naturally he says no then Ana shows her face to Gorgon revealing that she is obviously Medusa as a child and Gorgon due to her hatred is unable to see her child self, as all Gorgon can see is dark shadows covering Ana and thinks she sees an ugly monster. Ana also releases her full divinity powers as Medusa that she kept sealed for this moment for her mystic eyes to counter Gorgon’s.\n\nand now we are at our most current episode. we start by looking at Ana and Gorgon’s or rather Medusa’s memories of the island she lived on with her sisters and reveals what she truly wanted more than anything as well as showing the guilt she has after becoming a monster and ate her sisters of which Stheno and Euryale accepted their fate to be with their baby sister. then we get to the fight with Gorgon as Ana handles most of the fight on her own with Ishtar, Merlin, and Mash providing support. Why just Ana? well aside from her mystic eyes, Ana has the scythe that can kill immortals whether human or god. Ana lands the killing blow as both Gorgon and Ana fall into the hole in the ground and both spirit origins apparently disappeared. Kingu appears where after a brief fight he reveals everything went according to plan as Gorgon obviously was put as a fake Tiamat who had the actual authority of Tiamat linked to her and that linked Tiamat to Gorgon to experience death and caused the real Tiamat to wake up from her sealed slumber. she still hasn’t fully awakened but the beast class disaster tiamat releases her children of new humans Kingu bragged about on the world as things get dark fast. these creatures known as Lahmu attack and speak in chuthullu sounding language but a twitter user points out that it’s still japanese but mostly spoken backwards. anyway the Lahmu are fucked up little shits as they have no reason to kill, hunt or even eat humans and are just attacking for literal shits and giggles to the point they make the people they capture attack and kill each other for their amusement and promise to let the winner leave only to kill them anyway. the children would’ve been next but Ritsuka’s group fight them. They also find Siduri is missing and upon fighting the Lahmu, the one Quetz drop kicks shows she’s Siduri by doing the white flag hand gesture that Ishtar did. they let her go as Siduri Lahmu walks away. Kingu comes in showing he’s not too happy with his new siblings wasting time and thinking he was safe only to be betrayed and stabbed by the lahmu as they say they found their brother to be very boring and laugh.\n\nMan…. that was a lot to go over but man a few minor things here and there one could nitpick but overall FGO Babylonia continues to be consistently good with great animation, voice acting, music, and well executed sound effects. even the Lahmu sound creepy as all sin and while the killings the lahmu did isn’t as fucked up as say Blood C, it is something dark for this story. with 6 episodes left to air I’m actually excited to see how they will play things out and hopefully things remain consistently good or better and all I gotta say is Cloverworks definitely stepped up where A1 and shaft messed up on fate apocrypha and last encore. what do you all think of FGO so far right? leave your thoughts in the comments below as we enter the final stretch of babylonia."
