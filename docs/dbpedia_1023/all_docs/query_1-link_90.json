Is there anyway to know. He has no hard feelings and would like to meet or make contact with the gunner. Irving was with another airplane in a dive and the gunner may not know that he hit him, but the shells damaged his tail section and hit the armor on the back of his seat really hard. Irving said that he knew that he was hit, but felt no problems until he landed and then damaged the plane on landing. Irving Mayer wrote \"I thought that I killed Ernie Pyle\"\n\nIf anyone can give any help, contact me here.\n\nこの要求は、 F6Fヘルキャット駆逐戦車パイロットキャプテンアービングマイヤーです。\n\n1944年4月9日、トラック環礁で、ウマンの島では約10日午前\n\n彼は銃を据え付け後、予定された日本の船には、銃の攻撃を受けました。\n\nどのような船だったこの人は砲手だった。とにかくそこがわかっている。つらい思いをしている彼と会うか、射手に連絡を取るようになる。アービング潜るの別の飛行機と砲手ヒットで彼を知ることはできませんでしたが、砲弾の尾部が破損し、自分の座席の背面には本当にハードの鎧だった。アービングは、彼は攻撃を受けた時、知っていたが、何の問題まで、彼と着陸機が破損し、着陸に感じているという。アービングマイヤー\"私は、 \"アーニーパイルが死亡考えを書いた\n\nもし誰には援助が、ここで私に連絡をすることができます。\n\nHello, I have this ring that was given to me by my grandfather (indirectly via my mom) almost fifty years ago. I dont really have any history other then knowing that he worked there and he was too old to serve during WWII. I have attached a photo to this e-mail and maybe you could shed some light on this for me. I was always under the impression that it was made by a group of folks in the bomber plant during the war years. Thank you in advance for you help.

Back in 2005 I was at the Willow Run air show and I wore the ring to the event as I wanted to show it to some B24 owners and or aficionados. The two people I showed it to found it interesting but just drew a blank. Thank you again.\n\nMichael. If you have any information on this ring, please let me know here, C.

Heavily illustrated with dozens of photos, diagrams and charts. 146 pgs., 8½\"x 11\", sfbd.\n\nBook Description\n\nThe Consolidated B-24 Liberator first saw combat in June of 1942, making a daring raid into Nazi-occupied Romania to bomb the oil fields at Ploesti. Nearly 18,500 Liberators were built during the war years, making it by far the most-produced American combat aircraft. It served in many roles beyond heavy bomber, transport, and anti-submarine patrol, and flew in Africa, Europe, India, the Atlantic, India and the Pacific Theatre. Originally printed by the United States Army Air Force in 1942, the B-24 Liberator Pilot's Flight Operating Manual taught pilots everything they needed to know before entering the cockpit. Originally classified \"Restricted\", the manual was declassified long ago and is here reprinted in book form. This affordable facsimile has been reformatted, and color images appear as black and white. Care has been taken however to preserve the integrity of the text.\n\n1855327813\n\n1855327813B-24 Liberator Units\n\n1855327813of the Pacific War\n\nBorn out of an approach made by the US Army Air Corps to Consolidated for a bomber with superior performance to the B-17, the Liberator was built in record numbers as the Allies' most abundant heavy bomber. From the first to see combat, the B-24D, to the ultimate Liberator, the heavily modified PB4Y-2 Privateer, all navy versions are featured in this, the first of four volumes on the B-24 family.\n\nBook Description\n\nEver present in the Pacific from Pearl Harbor to VJ-Day, the B-24 Liberator proved to be the staple heavy bomber of the campaign. From its ignominious beginnings in the Allied rout in the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies, the bomber weathered the Japanese storm with a handful of bomb groups, which played a crucial role in checking the enemy's progress firstly in New Guinea, and then actively participating in the 'island hopping' campaign through the south-west Pacific."
