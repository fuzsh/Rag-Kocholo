Section 33 of the above-entitled act, being section 6133, N.C.L. 1929, is hereby amended to read as follows:\n\nSection 33. Any party in interest being dissatisfied with an order of the commission fixing any rate or rates, fares, charges, classifications, joint rate or rates, or any order fixing any regulations, practices or services, may within ninety (90) days commence an action in the district court of the proper county against the commission and other interested parties as defendants to vacate and set aside any such order on the ground that the rate fixed in such order is unlawful or unreasonable, or that any such regulation, practice, or service, fixed in such order is unreasonable. The commission and other parties defendant shall file their answers to said complaint within thirty (30) days after the service thereof, whereupon such action shall be at issue and stand ready for trial upon twenty (20) days notice to either party.\n\nAll actions brought under this section shall have precedence over any civil cause of a different nature pending in such court, and the court shall always be deemed open for the trial thereof, and the same shall be tried and determined as other civil actions; any party to such action may introduce evidence in addition to the transcript of the evidence offered to said commission.\n\n(a) No injunction shall issue suspending or staying any order of the commission relating to rates, fares, charges, classification, joint rate or rates, or any order fixing any regulations, except upon application to the court or judge thereof, upon notice given the commission within 20 days of the rendition of the order of the commission complained of and no such injunction shall issue except upon such notice being first given and a hearing of the petition therefor by the court or judge thereof within 20 days thereafter; provided, that in any event that all rates, charges and regulations of the commission shall be deemed reasonable and just until set aside by the court, and in all actions for injunction or otherwise the burden of proof shall be upon the party attacking or resisting the order of the commission to show by clear and satisfactory evidence that the order is unlawful, or unreasonable, as the case may be. In the event an injunction is granted by the court and the order complained of is one which permanently suspends a schedule of rates and charges or a part thereof filed by any utility pursuant to section 14 of this act or which otherwise prevents such schedule or part thereof from taking effect, the public utility complaining may keep in effect or cause to be put into effect, as the case may be, the suspended schedule or part thereof pending final determination by the court having jurisdiction, by filing a bond with the court in such amount as the court may fix conditioned upon the refund to persons, firms, companies, or corporations entitled thereto of the amount of the excess if the rate or rates so suspended are finally determined by the court to be excessive.\n\nê1955 Statutes of Nevada, Page 409 (CHAPTER 250, SB 240)ê\n\ncourt to be excessive.

Within 90 days after the entry of final judgment the public utility shall prepare and file with the commission a statement and report in affidavit form stating that all rate payers entitled to refunds have been paid, and if there are rate payers to whom payment has not or cannot be made, the names, addresses and individual amounts of refund shall be listed in such report, and the public utility shall pay the aggregate of all such unpaid refunds to the commission. The commission shall retain such aggregate refunds subject to the claim of each rate payer for his, her or its share in the refund payment and shall pay all such claims which are presented for payment within 2 years from and after the date of the entry of final judgment of the court. All such claimants shall be required to identify themselves to the satisfaction of the commission before payment shall be made. Any rate payer shall have a right of action against the commission in the event of a refusal of the commission to pay his, her or its claim if the name of such rate payer appears in the report filed by the public utility. Action against the commission must be brought within 6 months from and after the refusal to pay the same. The commission shall investigate every case in which a claim is presented to it by a person claiming a refund but whose name does not appear in the report of the public utility, and if such investigation results in a refusal by the utility to pay such claim, then the claimant shall have a right of action against the public utility. Any unclaimed moneys remaining in the custody of the commission at the expiration of the 2-year period shall escheat to the state.\n\n(b) If, upon the trial of such action, evidence shall be introduced by the plaintiff which is found by the court to be different from that offered upon the hearing before the commission, or additional thereto, the court, before proceeding to render judgment, unless the parties to such action stipulate in writing to the contrary, shall transmit a copy of such evidence to the commission, and shall stay further proceedings in said action for 30 days from the date of such transmission. Upon receipt of such evidence the commission shall consider the same, and may alter, modify, amend, or rescind its orders relating to such rate or rates, fares, charges, classifications, joint rate or rates, regulation, practice, or service complained of in said action, and shall report its action thereon to said court within 25 days from the receipt of such evidence.\n\n(c) If the commission shall rescind its order complained of, the action shall be dismissed; if it shall alter, modify or amend the same, such altered, modified, or amended order shall take the place of the original order complained of, and judgment shall be rendered thereon, as though made by the commission in the first instance. If the original order shall not be rescinded or changed by the commission, judgment shall be rendered upon such original order.\n\nê1955 Statutes of Nevada, Page 410 (CHAPTER 250, SB 240)ê\n\n(d) Either party to said action, within sixty (60) days after the service of a copy of the order or judgment of the court, may appeal or take the case up on error as in other civil actions. Where an appeal is taken to the supreme court of Nevada, the cause shall, on the return of the papers to the higher court, be immediately placed on the calendar of the then pending term, and shall be assigned and brought to a hearing in the same manner as other causes on the calendar.\n\nSec. 4.
