        "text": "Nearly seventy-six years ago – on Wednesday, November 3, 1943 – an officer of the 823rd Bomb Squadron of the 38th “Sunsetter” Bomb Group made entries in his squadron’s historical records concerning that day’s central event: A strike mission along the New Guinea coast from Alexishafen to Bogadjim, to attack barges, buildings, and concealed enemy troops.\n\nThe outcome of the mission was reported as follows:\n\nOur pilots and crews took off again to slap the little Jap off the map. Nine B-25Gs took off at 0713L to blast out barges, possible large hideouts and buildings from Alexishafen south of Bogadjim, New Guinea. Fighter cover was effected over Nadzab at an altitude of 3500 feet. The fighter escort consisted of P-47s. The flights were of three planes each and were led by the flights of the 822nd Squadron. 28 x 500 lb. 4-5 second delay demolition bombs were dropped in specific targets. Many of the bombs scored direct hits on barges along the coast. 1 bomb dropped safe due to rack failure and 3 bombs were returned to base due to mechanical failure. 82 rounds of 75mm were fired on runs with a number scoring hits and the remainder with no visible results. Villages and hideouts were thoroughly strafed with 6100 x .50 calibre and 1300 x .30 calibre ammunition. Photos were taken of the strike.\n\nNext followed remarks covering events experienced by specific aircraft and crews, focusing on battle damage, and, the loss of B-25G 42-64850:\n\nThe ack-ack encountered was moderate inaccurate and heavy coming from Madang, Alexishafen and Erimhafen Plantation. Plane no. 769, piloted by Remshaw, received a hole in the bomb bay door from fragment of 20mm. Plane No. 874, piloted by Shulich, received large hole in left vertical stabilizer from undetermined type of shell. Plane No. 850, the crew of which were Smith F/O pilot, Newland O.T. co-pilot, Chapin R.D. navigator, Anagos T. radio man, Boykin J.R. gunner crashed in water between Bili Bili Island and mainland. Cause unknown but thought due to loss of power due to damage from ack-ack. All five crew members last seen in life raft, apparently uninjured, rowing toward Bili Bili Island.\n\nThroughout the attack no interception was encountered. The remaining eight planes landed at Durand at 1135/L.\n\nThe next day – November 4 – no combat missions were flown by the 823rd Bomb Squadron. This brief pause in operations gave the squadron historian time to ponder the fate of the missing crew, his brief notes encompassing the hope for their rescue against their more likely fate as captives of the Japanese. Specifically:\n\nAll crew members express deep sorrow for the five crew members who were last seen in a life raft heading toward Bili Bili Island. What will become of them no one knows. Let’s hope that they are safe.\n\nAlas, they were not safe.\n\nThey would never return.\n\nToday, the five crew members of B-25G #850 – Smith, Newland, Chapin, Anagos, and Boykin – remain among the over 73,000 American servicemen still missing from the Second World War. Barring a fortuitous archival or archeological discovery, they will probably ever remain as such: “Missing in Action”.\n\nBut, the historical record of this crew’s loss is singularly different from the overwhelming majority of accounts of Allied World War Two aviators lost in either the Pacific or European Theaters of War. This is because the Missing Air Crew Report covering the crew’s loss – MACR 1087, to be specific – includes a photograph of the crew (albeit, as viewed from a distance) as last seen by fellow members of the 823rd Bomb Squadron en route back to the 38th Bomb Group’s base at Port Moresby.\n\nThe photograph was first discovered as I was reviewing MACRs via Fold3.com, which database / website many readers of this post are probably well familiar. The Fold3 version of this image is shown below:\n\nIn August of 2014, I had the rare opportunity, during a visit to the National Archives in College Park, of viewing and digitizing the original (?) “physical” (!) MACR and the included photograph (see “The Missing Photos”).\n\nSo, here is the above image, as copied via an EpsonPerfection V600 scanner.\n\n______________________________\n\nThe “first” page of MACR 1087, covering the loss of B-25G 42-64850, a 75mm cannon-equipped ship – is shown below:\n\nThe following comments were recorded by the 823rd Bomb Squadron’s Statistical Officer, 2 Lt. Homer L. Cotham, and appear on the “second” page of the MACR:\n\n(12) Plane, while flying formation at low altitude over target, suddenly lost altitude striking water. The plane bounced twice, then sank immediately. Entire crew seen in Life Raft making for island in near vicinity of accident.\n\n(13) Plane crashed in water four miles south of Madang, three-quarters of a mile off shore, in near vicinity of Bili Bili Island, N.G.\n\n(15) Extent of search: Catalina flying boat attempted to reach vicinity of accident or crash the night of October [sic] third. This attempt was incomplete due to weather.\n\nThe plane’s loss was described by Squadron Operations Officer Capt. William Brandon, who stated:\n\nWhile flying on Mission number 306 H, Alexishafen to Bogadjim Road Barge Sweep, I was leading flight number one. Flight Officer Smith was flying number three left wing position at the time that I took my flight in over the target. When next I looked to check the planes in my formation I saw Flight Officer Smith’s plane in the water.\n\nCircling the plane as it sank I dropped a life-raft. This life-raft sank but the crew of the sunken plane were able to safely board the raft from their own plane.\n\nWhen last sighted all members of the crew were observed aboard life-raft making towards the vicinity of Bili Bili Island, N.G., course undetermined.\n\n______________________________\n\nUnlike MACRs which specify the last-known latitude and longitude of a missing aircraft, the location of B-25G #850’s loss is simply given in words: “Off Bili Bili Island.”\n\nTo give you a frame of reference of the location of Bili Bili Island, here are two Google Maps – each having Google Maps’ red location pointer centered upon Bili Bili Island – showing the location of that tiny geographic feature.\n\nThis first map shows New Guinea and northern Australia, with – moving west to east – the Arafura Sea, Gulf of Carpentaria, and Coral Sea between the two land masses. Bili Bili Island is located approximately 360 miles west-southwest of Rabaul, just off the eastern coast of New Guinea, and south of Madang.\n\n______________________________\n\nIn this second map, Bili Bili Island is not visible, but locations mentioned in the MACR – Alexishafen and Madang – are. These towns lie along the western shore of Astrolabe Bay, which body of water remains unlabeled.\n\n______________________________\n\nMoving from the pixels of 2017 to the paper of 1943, MACR 1087 includes C.I.U. (Central Interpretation Unit) Map No. 36 of the Alexishafen area. The location of the B-25’s loss, about half-way between Bili Bli Island and the New Guinea coast, is denoted by an “X” within a small circle.\n\n(By way of comparison, here’s the map as it appears at Fold3.com.)\n\n______________________________\n\nAt a slightly larger scale than the C.I.U. map is the Google map below. This closer view reveals that Bili Bili Island is approximately 3 miles south of the southern limits of Madang, and about 1.3 miles east of the New Guinea mainland. Oddly, Google Maps leaves the island un-named, with the designation “Bil-Bil” superimposed on the opposite shoreline. Is there a village by that name at this location?\n\n______________________________\n\nFinally, at the same scale as the preceding map, we come to a Google Earth view of Bili Bili Island and Astrolabe Bay.\n\n______________________________\n\nPacific Wrecks clearly describes the loss of un-nicknamed B-25G 42-64850, surmising that the men were captured and died in captivity, while the Pacific Wrecks essay concerning the fate of allied POWs at Amron, New Guinea (Death at Amron – by Undersea Explorer / Documentary Film-Maker Walter Deas) suggests that the Smith crew may have murdered at that Japanese base, a “hilltop high-ground 16 kilometers north of Madang,” which served as a Japanese Army headquarters and Kempeitai facility.\n\nPacific Wrecks’ history of the Japanese Army base at Amron, which served as a lookout point and headquarters for the 18th Army and Kempeitai, lists the names of eleven Allied airmen (nine Americans and two Australians) who were confirmed to have been murdered at that location, and, five others who probably suffered the same fate, all between June, 1943 and April, 1944.\n\nHowever, the members of the Smith crew are not listed among the sixteen.\n\n______________________________\n\nThe Capture of the Smith Crew\n\nThe Smith crew were definitely captured. This information comes from three sources.\n\nIn reverse chronological order, these comprise the 2011 book Sun Setters of the Southwest Pacific Area – From Australia to Japan: An Illustrated History of the 38th Bombardment Group (m), 5th Air Force, World War II – 1941-1946, As Told and Photographed by the Men Who Were There (by Lawrence J. Hickey, Mark M. Janko, Stuart W. Goldberg, and Osamu Tagaya); 1944 newspaper articles in (unidentified) Buffalo area newspapers, and most strikingly, transcripts of English-language Japanese propaganda broadcasts to the western United States covering the mens’ capture\n\nIn 2011\n\nAs described in Sunsetters: “Capt. Bill Brandon led the 823rd Squadron, and when his flight of three planes reached Bili Bili, roughly halfway between Alexishafen and Bogadjim, he and his wingmen dropped their bombs between the area’s plantation and Bili Bili Island, just off the coast. As his bomb bay doors were closing, Capt. Brandon looked out his window and was shocked to see that Flight Officer Richard Smith’s plane was in the water.\n\nBrandon circled back and dropped a life raft to the downed crew. Smith’s plane sunk immediately after hitting the water, but he and his crew escaped and climbed into the raft. The men were last seen rowing toward Bili Bili Island, where they were captured and interrogated by the Kempei Tai, the Japanese Military Secret Police. Major Nakamoto, the 18th Army Staff Intelligence Officer, led the interrogation, which lasted roughly a week. Afterward they were taken a mile southwest to a POW compound, then transported to Wewak. They were never heard from again.” (Unfortunately, there no bibliographic reference for the source of this information.)\n\nPacific Wrecks history of the Wewak POW Camp (Kreer POW Camp) lists the names of three airmen (members of Captain William L. “Kizzy” Kizzire’s crew, about whom see more below) who were confirmed as having been POWs there. Neither they, nor any other Allied POWs presumed to have been held captive at that location – the Smith crew among them? – survived the war.\n\nLate 1943 and early 1944\n\nNews items concerning F/O Smith from The Buffalo Evening News.\n\nThe first news item simply mentions Smith’s “Missing in Action” status.\n\nFlight Officer Richard Smith\n\nOverseas since last March, Flt. O. Smith has been stationed in New Guinea and had been piloting a bomber. His last letter to his mother was written Nov. 3, the day on which he was reported missing while on a mission over New Britain. Graduated from District School 3, West Seneca, and West Seneca High School, he was a carrier for The Buffalo Evening News before entering the employ of the Bethlehem Steel Company. He enlisted in the Air Forces June 28, 1941.\n\nNews about F/O Smith’s capture was published in February or March of 1944, in the context of news about the death of his cousin and fellow Buffalo resident, Army Private Floyd C. Smith.\n\nWAR-SERVICE FLAG HONORING 4 SMITHS NOW HAS GOLD STAR\n\nPatrolman Wayne Smith, a grizzled veteran of 20 years’ service as a West Seneca policeman, went about the sad task of replacing one of the four blue stars in the family’s service flag with a gold star today. He has just been notified by the War Department that his son, Pvt. Floyd C. Smith, 19, who had been previously reported missing in action in Italy, now is known definitely to have been killed.\n\nWhat makes the news even more tragic for the smith family is that over on the other side of the world Flight Officer Richard Smith, 23, a nephew of Patrolman Smith, is a prisoner of the Japs. Richard is the son of Albert Smith, an electrician, of 17 Klass Ave., West Seneca, and was taken prisoner last Nov. 3, when a twin-engine bomber he was flying was forced down on a flight from New Guinea to New Britain.\n\nTwo other members of the Smith family are in the nation’s service. One is Pvt. Wayne Smith Jr., 21, a brother of Floyd, who has been unheard of in recent weeks and is believed to be overseas, and the other is Seaman First Class Milton D. Smith, 38, an uncle of Floyd and Richard, who is now at sea. Milton’s home address is 80 Hayden St., Buffalo.\n\n“I guess the war is proving kind of hard on the Smiths,” commented Patrolman Smith in his home at 25 Harlem Rd., West Seneca. “But I guess the same thing is happening to the Smiths all over the country. I wish I were a little younger I’d go in and take Floyd’s place. The last word we received from Floyd was about seven weeks ago when he wrote that ‘everything is swell’. Shortly after that he was reported missing. But we didn’t give up hope until the second telegram came.”\n\nFloyd was inducted in the Army in April 1943 after he had been working at the Curtiss-Wright Corporation airport plant for about five months. He was a native of West Seneca and was in his third year at West Seneca High School when he left school for war work. Assigned to an infantry unit, he had been in North Africa before going to Italy.\n\nNews of his death has been kept from his grandmother, Mrs. Fannie Smith, who is ill and also lives at 25 Harlem Rd., West Seneca. (1)\n\nA particular sentence in the article stands out: “Richard … was taken prisoner last Nov. 3, when a twin-engine bomber he was flying was forced down on a flight from New Guinea to New Britain.”\n\nHow was this known by early 1944?\n\nProbably through English-language radio broadcasts transmitted from Tokyo, and beamed to the Western United States and Latin America, from…\n\nNovember of 1943 through April of 1944.\n\nEntitled “Message From the Front”, these broadcasts pertained to American aviators – members of the Marine Corps and Army Air Force – who had been captured in the Southwest Pacific between early 1943 and early 1944.\n\nTranscripts of these broadcasts are among records in the National Archives and Records Administration’s “Records of the Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service.”\n\nThe “Message From the Front” broadcasts were transmitted at 0330 hours, albeit transcripts of the programs don’t specify if “3:30 hours” means Greenwich Mean Time, the Western time zone of the United States, or, Tokyo Time. The transcripts are headed by a surname, presumably that of the person who monitored and transcribed the program as it was received and monitored, in “real time”. These people were Berman, Bernstein, Hanson, Keller, Litwin, Roth, Sachter, Searl, and Teel.\n\nThough varying greatly in content and length, the broadcasts follow a generally similar “script,” albeit with substantial variation. They generally commence with an introduction covering political or social effects of the war on American Society, as a whole. Sometimes, emphasis is placed on the contrast between the hardships endured by American soldiers and civilians, in contrast with the attitude – as it were – of American military and political leaders.\n\nThen, the broadcasts focus upon the POWs themselves.\n\nIn all cases, the bulk of the broadcast is devoted to a presentation of detailed – quite detailed; very detailed – biographical information about the Prisoner of War, and may cover such topics as the circumstance under which he was shot down and captured, the type of aircraft he was flying, and his biography, the latter including his education and civilian vocation. In virtually every case the broadcast concludes with a recitation of highly personal, information about his next of kin, comprising names and addresses of family members – whether wives, parents, or siblings – the material, financial, or emotional challenges they’re contending with, and, other facets of their lives.\n\nIn some cases – disquieting to read; still disquieting to contemplate, even decades later – special focus is accorded to the physical, psychological, and emotional reaction of the POW to captivity, sometimes including quotations of statements allegedly made by the POW to his captors.\n\nIt’s conjecture on my part, but I suppose that the information in the “Message From the Front” broadcasts was extracted from transcripts of interrogation sessions endured by the POWs, then provided to officials in the Japanese media responsible for disseminating propaganda. The original text was edited to varying degrees for maximum dramatic effect.\n\nIn that sense, a consistent and unsurprising facet of the broadcasts is the complete absence of information about American military technology or tactics. Unsurprising, in that the purpose of the broadcasts was probably psychological warfare: To influence public opinion and therefore contribute to a sense of demoralization. If this was so, this rested on an extremely naive understanding of the nature of American society. (At least, as it existed eight decades ago. But, that’s another subject.)\n\nIn terms of the Smith crew, “Message From the Front” broadcasts pertain to Sgt. Boykin (February 9, 1944), Sgt. Anagos (February 16, 1944), Lt. Chapin (March 8, 1944), and F/O Smith (on March 29, 1944). There is no record of a broadcast concerning F/O Newland.\n\nFor the purpose of this post, two transcripts will suffice.\n\nHere is the broadcast covering Sergeant Anagos, transmitted on February 16, 1944, as transcribed by “Roth” and “Teel”:\n\nA MESSAGE FROM THE FRONT\n\nYour subject for today is the Boeing bomber that flew on without a pilot. Hello listeners, this time Radio Tokyo presents an eye-witness report from a member of the Japanese army press participating at a certain front in the New Guinea sector. Yes, it is a very strange story. It is worth coming under the category of believe it or not. It is an unusual story for the outsiders but it is [stunning] news for no other person than Mrs. Phyllis Anagnos, whose address is eight-four-one-seven North Military Avenue, Detroit, Michigan. Should it happen that Mrs. Anagnos is listening to this broadcast, radio Tokyo advises here to keep up [word]. It is so far from being good news, but a very depressing [two words] can be seen. Well, she may feel easy that her husband Sergeant Theodore Anagnos is no by means dead. Instead of ending his life, he has been taken prisoner by the Japanese forces, [and being a prisoner] of war, he cannot return to his beloved wife so long as America does not make unconditional surrender to Japan. If Mrs. Anagnos wishes to see her husband, she had better write a letter to Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt asking for help. No doubt the sympathetic Mrs. Roosevelt might take it that she might be under the circumstances with the wife of [few words]. Mrs. Roosevelt [three words] cell every day at the White House wailing bitterly before President Roosevelt and insisting upon the release of Theodore Anagnos. Well, wait a moment, Mrs. Theodore Anagnos is yet happy because her husband is enjoying good health at a prisoner’s camp of the Japanese Army. One day he told a member of the Japanese Army [press], that he saw at a certain American movie show [three words] featuring Clark Gable. He said Gable was [wonderful]. He went on to say I have a wife but to tell you the truth, I have [few words] how marvelous it would be if I could see [several words]. It is as if I am playing the very same role as Gable was in this film. Sergeant Anagnos [few words]. Mrs. Anagnos can depend upon it that her husband is quite [jovial]. Radio Tokyo is not responsible for his relationship with [two words]. That is a matter for Mrs. Anagnos to conduct a cross examination of her husband in person, in the event he should come back to America.\n\n[Remainder of commentary unintelligible.]\n\nHere’s the broadcast covering Flight Officer Smith, transmitted on March 29, 1944, as transcribed by “Hanson”:\n\nMESSAGE FROM THE FRONT\n\nOnce again we bring you information of the officers and men [seven words inaudible].\n\nRadio Tokyo proposes to give you details that are not available from any other source. Many of the folks back home are not told that a large number of their boys are being held prisoners of war in Japanese hands. These boys are spending their daily life in an entirely different frame of mind – I say different in the sense that their outlook of life in general at the time when they sallied forth from the United States is no longer apparent. Having become accustomed to their new environment, they have regained their presence of mind. Yes, they have come down to earth. They are now able to see through the realities of things in general. Like an ancient philosopher, they have had an ample opportunity to reflect on the past and quietly analyze the present.\n\nHere is the story of one of the men as brought to us by a Japanese Army correspondent. His name is Richard Smith. To be more concise, Richard Smith is a Second Lieutenant belonging to the Twentieth Bomber Squadron, and the Fifth Bomber Group of the United States Air Corps. Smith is twenty-four years old and hails from Buffalo, New York. The address is Seventeen Klaas Avenue, Buffalo, New York. Second Lieutenant Richard Smith was a pilot at the time of his capture.\n\nAnyone listening on this broadcast will be doing a great favor for Richard and his folks if he, or she, would notify Mr. Albert Smith, the father of Second Lieutenant Richard Smith, at Seventeen Klaas Avenue, Buffalo, New York, that his son is in good hands under the care of the Japanese army authorities. The War Department at Washington may have listed him as missing, as they have done to hundreds of others. But as far as Second Lieutenant Richard Smith is concerned, he is very much accounted for, and in good shape, as a prisoner of war of Japan.\n\nOne of the things that Second Lieutenant Richard Smith inquired of our Japanese army correspondent is whether or not there were other officers in active service who come from Annapolis. By the way, I mean to add that Second Lieutenant Richard Smith is an Annapolis man. He would like to know why it is that there were no other Annapolis men on the front line. The officers that had come across were all reserve officers. Second Lieutenant Smith is anxious to know whether it is the policy of the War Department at Washington to spare the services of all full-fledged academy men. One can fully appreciate the complaint on the part of Smith of being placed on the front line while his colleagues are being given posts in [such safe] positions well to the rear.\n\nAnother point brought out by Second Lieutenant Richard Smith was the fact that there is too much favoritism given to the pilots over the ground troops. One of his friends at Port Moresby was a member of the regular [crew]. According to Smith, the pilots are given two weeks furlough after serving two and a half months on the front lines; whereas, the ground forces are allowed but one week after four solid months of drudgery.\n\nHere is a tip from Second Lieutenant Richard Smith to the young men back in the States. “If you are ever counting on serving the United States Air Corps, stick to the flying end and steer clear of any jobs oiling and repairing planes, which one has no chance of flying [himself].” Of course, as Smith would put it you are taking chances against one of the toughest enemies, the Japanese Zero fighter. Whether you care to agree with Second Lieutenant Richard Smith or not, the fact remains that there is a wealth of difference between being a pilot and being just one of the boys in the ground force.\n\nAnother factor pointed out to our Japanese Army Correspondent by Second Lieutenant Smith that once you are sent out on the [word] front, there is no chance of knowing just what the score is. It is common knowledge that the United States Army Air Corps is a fanatic stickler for the “hush hush” policy of keeping all things under cover. I mean among the officers and men themselves. According to Second Lieutenant Smith, he knows the name and rank of his squadron commander but he has yet to hear the name of his group commander. Worse than that, he has never seen the face of his group commander. None of his comrades seem to know for that matter. Where is there any army that knows not the identity or the name of his superior officer? Second Lieutenant Richard Smith is in dead earnest, as anyone can tell that he wasn’t telling a lie. He really doesn’t know. Here is the great American mystery of an officer who does not know, or rather, he is not told just who are his comrades even in [his adjoining fortress].\n\nAsked why he could not become more intimate with the other officers, Second Lieutenant Richard Smith said that he had been warned by his superiors to avoid mixing with the other officers. Hence, he had no knowledge as to the number or the designation or what had become of many of the officers once they [leave] [word or two]. The question naturally arises, “Why are the American air officers forbidden to associate with each other?” The answer is simple. It is the policy of secrecy. The authorities are on pins and needles in trying to keep all information as to the personal losses from reaching the ears of the men. Any divulgence of actual losses incurred by the United States Army Air Force [several words] would no doubt unbalance the morale of the rank and file. So there you are. It’s a mighty wise policy for a [word] which has lost quite a number of his valuable men to keep that information under a tight lip. What chances are there for the people back home to know just what has become of their boys? At least, the folks of Second Lieutenant Richard Smith can congratulate themselves on the fact that their boy is [quite safe and sound].\n\nThough these two “Message From the Front” broadcasts were transmitted on February 16 and March 29, that fact does not imply that the POWs were still alive at that time. Some “Message From the Front” broadcasts were transmitted on dates after the POWs to which they pertained were no longer alive.\n\nFor example, 1 Lt. Joseph W. Hill (husband of Roberta Hill, of 602 Palmetto Ave., De Land, Florida) of the 70th Fighter Squadron, 18th Fighter Group, lost on August 26, 1943, while flying P-40F 41-19834.\n\nCaptured and held captive at Rabaul, he was the subject of a broadcast on April 29, 1944. Nearly two months before, on March 4 or 5, 1944, he was one of the 32 American and Australian POWs (19 USAAF, 5 USMC, and 8 RAAF) who were murdered during the “Tunnel Hill Incident”. Lt. Hill’s flight school portrait, one of the thousands of similar images in the National Archives’ collection “Photographic Prints of Air Cadets and Officers, Air Crew, and Notables in the History of Aviation – NARA RG 18-PU”, appears below:\n\nAs for the Sunsetters, only one member of the Group survived captivity. He was Major Willison Madison Cox, of Knoxville, Tennessee. (3)\n\n______________________________\n\nWhat then, of the Smith crew?\n\nAkin to MACR 1423 for the crew of the 7th Air Force B-24D Liberator Dogpatch Express, covered in my earlier posts, “Upon An Endless Sea” and “Portraits of the Fallen: The Crew of the Dogpatch Express, in Photographs”, MACR 1087 (like many “early” (and not only “early”) Missing Aircrew Reports covering multi-place aircraft) carries neither the home addresses nor the names of the crewmens’ next-of-kin.\n\nThe men are “anonymous”; they are simply names and serial numbers, without real identities.\n\nHowever, akin to the crew of Dogpatch Express, it’s been possible to “reconstruct” nominal biographical information about these men. This was done using War Department Bureau of Public Relations Press Branch Casualty List issued on 13 December, 1943 (from the United States National Archives) and especially – particularly – various databases at Ancestry.com. Using these resources, the identities of the men’s next-of-kin, and wartime places of residence could be identified.\n\nSo, briefly, this is who they were:\n\nPilot: Smith, Richard, F/O, T-186554\n\nMr. and Mrs. Albert R. [Died June 7, 1965] and Mary (Hellinger) Smith (parents), 17 Klass Ave., Buffalo, N.Y.\n\nMentioned in Buffalo Courier-Express December 14, 1943. Mr. Albert Smith’s obituary appeared in the same newspaper on June 10, 1965.\n\nCo-Pilot: Newland, Otis Terrell, F/O, T-346\n\nBorn 1920, in Texas\n\nMr. and Mrs. Cam Alexander and Catherine C. Newland (parents), Joe L. Newland (brother), Route 3, Lone Oak, Tx.\n\nNavigator: Chapin, Robert Dudley, Jr., 2 Lt., 0-671281\n\nBorn 1921\n\nLt. Cdr. and Mrs. Robert Dudley [May 20, 1876 – 1945] and Sara (Newton) [1882 – August 21, 1961] Chapin (parents); Linda Chapin [1907 – September 30, 1916] (sister), Cynthia (Chapin) Taylor (sister) [April 1, 1917 – September 12, 1982], 20 Huntington St., Hartford, Ct.\n\nThe above genealogical information about the Chapin family is by FindAGrave contributor C. Greer, whose memorial / biographical profile for 2 Lt. Chapin includes a photograph of his parents’ tombstone, on which the younger Chapin’s name is inscribed.\n\nDue to uncertainty about copyright, I won’t display the photo “here”! Rather, you can view the image at this link.\n\nRadio-Operator / Gunner: Anagnos, Theodore, Sgt., 32503485\n\nBorn 1914, in Oregon\n\nMrs. Phyllis H. Anagnos (wife), 8417 North Military Ave., Detroit, Mi.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Speros and Evangeline Anagnos (parents), George and Peter (brothers), 1301 Hart Ave., Detroit, Mi.\n\nGunner: Boykin, Johnnie Rayford, Sgt., 18121719\n\nBorn May 27, 1922, in Swenson, Texas\n\nMrs. Berna Dean (Stephens) Boykin (wife) (Born July 28, 1925, Mountainair, N.M. – Died November, 1982)\n\nJohnnie Dean Boykin (son; born August 18, 1943 – died 2007) Dexter, N.M.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Roy Hammel and Lillian (King) Boykin (parents), Lee Roy Boykin (brother), Hagerman, N.M. / 408 W. 6th St., Roswell, N.M.\n\nSome Observations\n\nBorn in the 1910s and 20s, they were, unsurprisingly and typically, all “young” men, with Sgt. Anagos – born in 1914 – having been the oldest.\n\nAkin to radio operator Johnnie Boykin (yet unlike pilot Smith, co-pilot Newland, and navigator Chapin) Anagos was married.\n\nJohnnie Boykin (assuming I’ve interpreted records at Ancestry.com correctly – well, I think I have!) became a father while overseas. His son, Johnnie Dean Boykin, was born in August of 1943. Only two and a half months old by November 3, 1943, father and son would never meet. Johnnie Dean died in 2007, while his mother, Berna Dean, passed away in 1982.\n\nThough I have no knowledge of the numbers of sorties flown by the crew, their ranks (the pilot and co-pilot were Flight Officers) and the identical military awards received by each crew member (according to the ABMC website, each aviator was awarded the Air Medal and Purple Heart) suggest (?) that they were a relatively “new” crew, having flown – either as a unit, or individually – no more than ten combat missions.\n\nTo signify that these men were more than “data”; more than mere names and serial numbers; more than statistics, here’s the one portrait I was able to find of a crew member: Sergeant Boykin. His photograph and biography are among World War Two Records of the State of New Mexico, which can be accessed at Ancestry.com.\n\n______________________________\n\nThe airmen’s names are memorialized on the Walls of the Missing at the Manila American Cemetery in Luzon.\n\nThe ABMC website gives each man’s date death as December 15, 1945, which likely reflects a date arbitrarily established by the Army upon the closure of the postwar investigation of the crew’s fate.\n\n______________________________\n\nBut, what of the impetus for this post – the photograph itself…?\n\nScanned at 1200 dpi, it’s shown below.\n\nThe image has several notable qualities.\n\nIn a purely photographic sense, the picture is comprised of three “elements” that “balance” one another:\n\nB-25G 42-64851 captured in flight, in the right center. (2)\n\nA glassily calm sea extending to the horizon, a vague curtain of clouds suspended above, in the distance.\n\nAnd both significantly and ironically, the smallest element in the image: The Smith crew, in their raft, can be seen at center left, probably headed for Bili Bili Island. Of particular note, the silhouette of the aviator on the right (it looks like he’s wearing his Mae West) is clearly distinguishable against the surface of a remarkably smooth sea.\n\nWhether by chance, skill, or both – unfortunately, the MACR doesn’t list the photographer’s name! – the combination of composition, focus, lighting, and perspective is remarkable.\n\nGiven that neither the mainland nor the island are visible, the “direction” towards the horizon (as opposed to the direction of flight of the overlying B-25) is probably either to the north-northeast (so Bili Bili island is out of view to the “right”), or … south-southwest (thus, Bili Bili Island is out of view, to the “left”).\n\nIn this, the image is strikingly reminiscent of and similar to a photograph – below (in Lawrence Hickey’s Warpath Across the Pacific, from the Melvin L. Best collection) – showing the crew of Captain William L. Kizzire standing atop the rear fuselage of their B-25D Mitchell (41-30046 – Impatient Virgin) after their plane was ditched during a low-level attack mission to Boram Strip, near Wewak, a little over three weeks later: on November 27, 1943.\n\nAs listed at both Pacific Wrecks and Warpath, the men are:\n\nPilot: Capt. William L. “Kizzy” Kizzire, 0-726787, Greybull, Wy.\n\nCo-Pilot: 2 Lt. Charles G. Reynolds, 0-661563, Bridgeport, Oh.\n\nNavigator: 1 Lt. Joseph W. Carroll, Jr., 0-665898, Dallas, Tx.\n\nFlight Engineer: S/Sgt. Wilfred J. Paquette, 31127441, Northampton, Ma. (Killed while POW)\n\nRadio Operator: S/Sgt. Roy E. Showers, Jr., 18075424, Pampa, Tx. (Killed while POW)\n\nGunner: S/Sgt. Fred D. Nightwine, 13085578, Slippery Rock, Pa. (Killed while POW)\n\nAkin to members of F/O Smith’s crew, three members of Captain Kizzire’s crew – Sergeants Nightwine, Paquette, and Showers – were the subject of radio propaganda broadcasts, transcripts of which are available at Pacific Wrecks’ Radio Tokyo Broadcasts in English. (4)\n\n______________________________\n\nFinally, two photographs.\n\nFirst, an April 2010 image of Astrolabe Bay – looking east towards the Bismarck Sea – by Jan Messersmith, from his blog Madang – Ples Bilong Mi: A Daily Journal of a Permanent Resident of Paradise. Perhaps the crews of the Sunsetters saw a vista akin to this – actually, strikingly beautiful – on the third of November in the year 1943.\n\nSecond, to close the story – though its ending will likely ever remain uncertain; it will probably never be fully “closed” – the Smith crew, in their raft, floating between the New Guinea mainland and Bili Bili Island.\n\nI’m not in possession of Individual Deceased Personnel Files for members of the Smith crew, but considering that the definitive fate of the crew has never been established, I would suppose that those documents would offer little to resolve the men’s fate.\n\nWell, it may be a trite expression, but it’s true: Times marches on – and it proceedes quickly.\n\nNow 2019, only twenty-four more years remain until the year 2043. By then, a century will have transpired since the November day when crew of B-25G #850 flew into history. It would be as predumptuous as it would be naive (and probably inaccurate, to boot, though it would be intriguing!) to predict the nature of “that” world, for who in 1943 could have predicted the nature of “our” world; of 2019?\n\nBut, despite changes in technology, economics, and science, one constant will remain, and has always remained: That of human nature. And part of that nature is the need; actually very necessity, to remember the past and those who were part of it.\n\nNotes\n\n(1) Pvt. Smith, a soldier in the 133rd Infantry Regiment of the 34th Infantry Division, was killed in action on January 28, 1944. He is buried at the Sicily-Rome American Cemetery in Nettuno, Italy, at Grave 56, Row 10, Plot I.\n\n(2) Well, enlarged, the serial number of the overflying B-25G seems to be 42-64851! A check of the Aviation Archeology database (unfortunately inaccessible for some time), and a hunting expedition at DuckDuckGo reveal no information about this aircraft.\n\nFortunately, a review of B-25s assigned to the 823rd Bomb Squadron, listed in Appendix III of Sunsetters of the Southwest Pacific, reveals the following for this aircraft: “Possibly flown overseas by 2 Lt. George J. Maturi crew. (August, 1943) Transferred to 4th Air Depot (January 8, 1944), Townsville, then to 822nd BS.” The plane is consequently listed among B-25s assigned to the 822nd Bomb Squadron, specifically on February 26, 1944. After a mid-air collision on August 1, 1944, the aircraft was transferred to the 376th Service Squadron for salvage.\n\nIn this 1200 dpi scan, the pilot is clearly visible, while the head of the gunner can be seen within the dorsal turret. Other details of the plane – such as the plexiglass tail-cone, which seems to have been strangely truncated, and open to the air – are also evident.\n\n(3) The pilot of B-25D 41-30118 (Elusive Lizzie / Miss America, covered in MACR 16113) Major Cox’s was shot down during a mission to Madang on August 5, 1943. One member of his crew, S/Sgt. Raymond H. Zimmerman, was killed when the aircraft crashed. The four remaining crewmen were captured, and eventually murdered at Amron. Portraits of Major Cox and his navigator, 1 Lt. Louis J. Ritacco (from Port Chester, N.Y.) are shown below. Akin to the portrait of Lieutenant Hill, their pictures are from NARA’s “Photographic Prints of Air Cadets and Officers, Air Crew, and Notables in the History of Aviation – NARA RG 18-PU”.\n\nFlight Cadet Williston Madison Cox, Jr.\n\nCadet Louis James Ritacco\n\nMajor Cox’s loss is given notable attention in Garrett Middlebrook’s Air Combat At 20 Feet, the cover art of which I hope to (some day!) display in my brother blog, WordsEnvisioned, illustrating cover and interior art in books and pulp magazines from the 40s and 50s (and even more…).\n\n(4) Of the numerous members of the 345th Bomb Group – the “Air Apaches” – who were known to have been taken captive, eight survived the war.\n\nListed by date of capture, they were:\n\nMcGuire, James, 1 Lt., 0-674314, Pilot (Grants Pass, Or.)\n\nCaptured March 30, 1945, while piloting B-25J 44-29350 (500th Bomb Squadron), covered in MACR 15450.\n\nA remarkable and chilling photograph of Lt. McGuire’s B-25, on fire and diving towards Yulin Kan Bay, at the southern tip of Hainan Island, is shown below. This image, from the collection of Samuel W. Bennett (via Kevin Mahoney) appears in Lawrence Hickey’s Warpath Across the Pacific.\n\nThe latitude and longitude coordinates given for 44-29350’s loss are listed in the 500th Bomb Squadron Mission Report for the March 30 mission, as 18-10-20 N, 109-33-00 E, but they’re not given in the crew’s postwar “fill-in” MACR, which was filed on 10 April, 1946,\n\nWhen plugging this location Google Maps, the location generated is about halfway between “Shendao” and “Jinmu Corner”, just off the point of land projecting west.\n\nThe 3-D aerial view below gives you a better idea of the crash location, which is identified by Google Maps’ red pointer. Intriguingly, the location (of course, the coordinates should be understood as being approximate), appears to be at the very end of a breakwater / jetty projecting west into Yulin Bay, between Shendao and Jinmu Corner.\n\nHere’s a closer 3-D view…\n\nThe elevated terrain to the west of the “Yalong Bay National Tourism Holiday Resort” (the dark color of terrain, compared to the light-colored low-lying terrain just to its west, may simply be an artifact of image processing) might correspond to the ridge visible behind the descending B-25, in the Bennett collection photo shown above.\n\nFinally, for completeness, here’s a map of Hainan Island…\n\n________________\n\nLawlis, Merritt E., Capt., 0-432168, Navigator (Indianapolis, In.)\n\nMuller, Benjamin T., S/Sgt., 18090388, Radio Operator (El Paso, Tx.)\n\nCaptured April 3, 1945. Crew members of 1 Lt. William P. Simpson, from B-25J 43-27888 “Pensive” (500th Bomb Squadron), covered in MACR 14225.\n\n________________\n\nShott, John, Cpl., 33421756, Tail Gunner (Aliquippa, Pa.)\n\nCaptured May 17, 1945.

Though obviously of central use in resolving the fate of missing WW II Army Air Force personnel, the information in these reports extends to areas as military technology, aerial combat tactics, air-sea rescue, outdoor survival (in all manner of terrains and climates), escape and evasion, the experiences of POWs, war crimes, and even in a subtle way – perhaps inevitably, though indirectly – the postwar readjustment of veterans and military casualties to civilian life, and genealogy.\n\nAs presented in my earlier post, The Missing Photos: Photographic Images in Missing Air Crew Reports, I was very fortunate in 2014 to have had the opportunity to examine Missing Air Crew Reports in their “original” physical – print – format, ultimately making digital copies of a small number of these documents: specifically, those MACRs which include photographs.\n\nHaving first learned about MACRS in the mid-1980s, this was a marked change from the way I’d previously accessed and studied these documents. That effort was first done using microfiche copies purchased from NARA, next through visits to the National Archives in College Park, and finally, in digital format, via Fold3.\n\nIt was through latter format that I conducted the bulk of my research into these documents. Ironically, though the nominal ability to access and study MACRs via Fold3 has been extraordinarily convenient (and hey, fewer road trips via I-95 – ugh! – to College Park) and productive (searching by MACR number, surname, or aircraft serial number is extremely useful), I discovered that the potential value of digitized MACRs on Fold3 is severely hampered by the quality of images of the MACRs, and, the design of the Fold3 MACR database.\n\nThis problem was described by aviation historian Frank J. Olynyk in a 2012 post at the 12oclockhigh forum, which is worth reading in detail.\n\nI can verify Mr. Olynyk’s observations.\n\nAs he described, many Missing Aircrew Reports,are simply; completely absent from Fold3. (An example: Try searching for MACRs 3500 and 3631, for B-24H 42-95064 (464th BG, 778th BS) piloted by 2 Lt. Edward J. Barres, or, search by the bomber’s serial number. Good luuuck…!) This is even true for reports far “higher” in the numerical sequence of the documents than the mid-3000 range.\n\nIn addition, the quality of some scans, primarily among low-numbered MACRs (and even among some higher numbered MACRs) is extremely poor – sometimes so much as to render some digitized MACRs to be, well, er, uh…useless.\n\nThis is particularly ironic in light of Fold3’s company history, which states, “The concept for Fold3 is rooted in the company’s years of experience in the digitization business as iArchives, Inc. Starting in 1999, iArchives digitized historical newspapers and other archive content for leading universities, libraries and media companies across the United States.\n\nFrom the beginning, the iArchives team developed a unique understanding of the value of creating an online repository for the world’s original source documents. Leveraging the proprietary systems and patented processes built for the digitization of paper, microfilm and microfiche collections, the management team made a strategic decision: Use the iArchives platform to provide access to these historically significant and valuable collections.”\n\nUh? Okay.\n\nConjecture: These problems seem to have resulted from two factors.\n\nFirst, the primary source material seems to have been the fiche version of the MACRs, rather than the original documents themselves.\n\nSecond, perhaps the low-numbered documents (er … um … I mean fiche) comprised the start of the learning curve by which the processors (who? where? when? how?) became familiar with procedures for digitization. If so, once digitizing and data entry had been systemized, any poor quality scans eventuating from the initial efforts at scanning – of low-numbered MACRs – were never replaced by a “second round” of suitable, better quality images. Similarly, errors or gaps from the processing of higher-numbered MACRs were likewise not corrected.\n\n(Admittedly, conjecture on my part.)\n\nWhat’s not uncertain is the potential – in terms of ease of searchability and quality of both images and information – that could have resulted from a better-designed and implemented effort at document processing and scanning. Given what I observed of the physical quality of the original MACRs (they’ve held up very well over nearly eight decades) the original documents could have been (carefully; conscientiously) scanned at high resolution, and, in color. Paralleling this, the database by which the MACRs are accessed could have been designed with an altogether different primary key (as per Mr. Olynyk’s suggestion), or, multiple primary keys.\n\nIn this, I’m reminded of the database of the National Archives of Australia, or that of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which in terms of aesthetic design, ease of use, presentation of results to the user, and quality of digital files, are very, very (very) impressive.\n\nWhile obviously Fold3’s MACR collection is only one of numerous repositories of digital documents available through that website (owned by Ancestry.com since 2010), not a stand-alone collection with a dedicated website, the potential held for something much better.\n\nIn summary, though this digital resource is certainly valuable and useful, it is absolutely nowhere near what it could have been – in terms of quality, usability, and accuracy – had the design and creation of the product really been undergirded by measures of thought, planning, and quality control.\n\nReferences\n\nBooks\n\nGrover, Roy C., Incidents in the Life of a B-25 Pilot, AuthorHouse, October 19, 2006\n\nHickey, Lawrence J.; Janko, Mark M.; Goldberg, Stuart W., and Tagaya, Osamu, Sun Setters of the Southwest Pacific Area – From Australia to Japan: An Illustrated History of the 38th Bombardment Group (m), 5th Air Force, World War II – 1941-1946, As Told and Photographed by the Men Who Were There, International Historical Research Associates, Boulder, Co.

Some events appear – by all standards of understanding and reason – to present us with seemingly irrevocable and misfortune and challenge. Other situations and experiences can carry us – by all measures of sense and logic – to a horizon of apparently good fortune. But then, in time, what appears to have been misfortune may actually – albeit unknown to us, at the time – be a reprieve and “second chance”, while what seems to have been bountiful luck may – in a way of which we are comfortably unaware – presage a much more dire outcome.\n\nIf this is so during “conventional” times, then vastly more so during a time of war, when the pace, sweep, and nature of events – and the danger inherent to those events – is magnified many fold.\n\nSome 75 years ago, such a situation transpired in the life of the pilot of a B-24 Liberator bomber.\n\nBut first, an explanation.\n\n______________________________\n\nIn March and April of 2017, I created two blog posts concerning photographs I’d discovered at the United States National Archives in MACR (Missing Air Crew Report) number 1423. This MACR covers the loss of a B-24D Liberator (41-24214 – Dogpatch Express) of the 11th Bomb Group’s 42nd Bomb Squadron, over the Central Pacific Ocean, after a mission to the atoll of Taroa Island, in the Maloelap Atoll of the Marshall Islands, on December 21, 1943.\n\nA particular image appearing in the “first” post is a very high resolution (2400 dpi) cropped scan of one of the photographs, showing the damaged bomber shortly before it crashed into the sea…\n\nThe “second” blog post includes an image accompanying the FindAGrave biographical profile of T/Sgt. Roy T. Gearon, the bomber’s radio operator, via FindAGrave contributor Patrick Maher, Sgt. Gearon’s cousin. The picture shows most of the ill-fated bomber’s crew, as they appeared some months prior to the December twenty-first mission. The image is captioned: “Roy’s crew picture taken a few months before they were shot down. T/Sgt. Roy Thomas Gearon bottom left.” While T/Sgt. Gearon’s FindAGrave profile gives no further information about this image, in light of recently acquired information and photographs (see much more below…), it’s seen that T/Sgt. Gearon is at the far left, standing.\n\nThough my prior posts list the names of the plane’s crew members (from MACR 1423 – the first sheet is below), in the absence of other information it was then impossible to attach “names to faces”.\n\nThus, the men in the photograph remained, in senses both symbolic and very real, “unknown”.\n\n______________________________\n\nWell, time passes.\n\nSometimes; all too often (especially in the world of 2018) time can drape a veil of forgetfulness over history.\n\nBut, on occasion, the passage of time can actually bring the past into clarity, memory, and awareness. Fortunately, such has happened with the names of the crewmen of Dogpatch Express.\n\nRecently, I was contacted by Richard “Rich” Thomspon, Jr., through whom I learned that the officer in the center of the above photo – the fellow seated in the wheelchair – was his father, Second Lieutenant Richard (“Dick”) Sydney Thomspon, Sr. At the time the image was taken, Dick, severely wounded during the 11th Bomb Group’s mission to Wake Island, on July 24, 1943, was recovering from his injuries, probably at Oahu, Hawaii. As indicated by Roy Gearon’s FindAGrave biography, Dick indeed was being visited by his crewmen.\n\nAll but two of the men in the photo – aboard Dogpatch Express five months later – would not survive the war.\n\nRich has created a detailed, profusely illustrated, and well-written account of his father’s military experiences and postwar life, entitled Wicked Witch, which he has kindly shared with me. A few of the many evocative images from this document appear below.\n\nAs a result, through Rich’s assistance and enthusiasm, I’m now able to “attach” names to faces, and, casting aside time’s anonymity, definitively identify each airman. The mens’ identities have thus become more than the nominal information – “name, serial number, and next of kin” – typical of Missing Air Crew Reports and Casualty Lists.\n\n______________________________\n\nDick Thompson was born in Boston on December 9, 1918. His family eventually moved to Pennsylvania, residing at 25 Rolling Road in West Park Station, a suburb of Carrol Park, near Philadelphia’s Overbrook Park section.\n\nDick entered the military in 1941 (prior to which time he’d been an iron-worker), before Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor. He was eventually assigned to the “22nd Military Police” of the 1st Armored Division, and was stationed in Louisiana.\n\nIn time – though the details and specific dates are unknown – Dick entered the Army Air Force. Having completed training as an Aviation Cadet, he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant on the 12th of December (Saturday), 1942. The other significant – if not greater – transition in his life was his marriage the next day to Elizabeth Marie McCaffrey, of Philadelphia.\n\nThough the details are unknown, Dick spent the Winter and Spring of 1943 doing further training in the southwestern United States. According to Rich, it’s unknown, “…when his crew was assigned or how much stateside “bonding” they got in before leaving for Hawaii.”\n\nIn any event, his crew initially – almost certainly – consisted of:\n\n2 Lt. John E. Lowry, Jr. – co-pilot\n\n2 Lt. Carl A. “Mort” Mortenson – navigator\n\nLt. Lori – bombardier\n\nTechnical Sergeant Clarence T. Sopko – Flight Engineer\n\nStaff Sergeant Arnold J. Paradise – Radio Operator\n\nStaff Sergeant Carl N. Dell – gunner\n\nStaff Sergeant Earl D. Neilsen – gunner\n\nSergeant Del Vickio (spelling uncertain – could be “Del Vechio”, or, “Del Vecchio”) – gunner\n\nRich notes that each of the enlisted men wore at least four sergeant’s stripes, indicating that they may well have accrued more service time than their own four officers. The crew eventually arrived at Kualoa, Hawaii (specific date unknown – probably mid-June), where they were assigned to the 11th Bomb Group’s (the “Grey Geese”) 42nd Bomb Squadron.\n\nOn June 16, 1943, they flew aircraft 42-20688, the WICKED WITCH, as verified from data at the Oak Trust Library. Lt. George W. Smith, who would pilot the ill-fated DOGPATCH EXPRESS six months later, is known to have piloted the WITCH earlier – on June 7 – for a test of the plane’s automatic flight control equipment.\n\nThe 11th Bomb Group’s second combat mission since June of 1942 (the first having been a bombing and photo reconnaissance mission, staged from Funafuti (in the Ellice Island Group) to Makin and the Jaluit Islands), scheduled for July 24, 1943, was to be to Wake Island. For this purpose, the 11th staged at Fongafele Island, at Funafuti. Prior to that time the 11th Bomb Group was engaged in organizing itself as a combat organization, and, flying practice and patrol missions around the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nHere’s an image of Dick having briefly “gone native” near the Funafuti Island church…\n\nThe July 24 mission would be Dick’s first opportunity to fly the WITCH since June 16. As noted by Rich (via historian Bob Livingstone of Brisbane, a member of the Aviation Historical Society of Australia and author of two books on the B-24), “…when a new crew came in with a new plane, the other air crews would “seize” their plane and give the new crew one of the ratty old planes that was pretty well used up. Hard to argue after seeing what happened to the “WITCH” as it did 6 missions in the 5 weeks dad was there but with Lieutenants Deasy, Stay, and Sands.” (In the time intervening since his arrival, Dick had piloted 9 other B-24s on a total of 18 missions.) Rich has also suggested that the allocation of new planes to veteran crews was, “…part of the training for a new crew. If they just got to fly a new plane all the time, they would likely as not have any mechanical issues to deal with. … Flying the older planes, especially during training and sea search missions would give them a chance to think and interact as a team trying to survive under extenuating circumstances. I think this was all by design of the bomb group commander, Colonel William J. Holzapfel, Jr., At this point in the war, he was responsible to ensure his airman were trained in the skills to win the war and he was learning right along with his air crews.”\n\nAs noted by Richard, “in terms of aerial warfare, [the mission to Wake Island] was just one more mission with nothing to distinguish it from others. Conducted by Liberators of the reconstituted 11th, it was a “nuisance raid” ordered by the navy to relieve pressure in the South Pacific and to confuse the enemy as to where the next blow would fall.”\n\n“12 planes were scheduled, 10 took off and eight went over the target to drop seven 500 pound general purpose bombs, 55 fragmentation bomb clusters and three 650 pound depth charges. Hits were scored on Wake’s oil storage areas, barracks and a gun emplacement.”\n\n“When Lt. Richard Thompson’s WICKED WITCH got to Midway from Hawaii to stage for the Wake raid, their tail gunner, S/Sgt. Earl D. Nielsen, required an emergency appendectomy. When … Colonel Holzapfel asked the Marines for a replacement, there were more than 200 volunteers. So, the name of Sgt. William C. Campbell was drawn out of the hat. A Marine Captain offered $1,000 to take the Sergeant’s place, but was refused and Sgt. Campbell took over the tail guns of WICKED WITCH and over Wake, he downed a Zero. (The eight-plane raid claimed nine Zeroes destroyed, four probable and three damaged.)”\n\nThe Wake Island mission cost the 11th Bomb Group two B-24s and twelve airmen.\n\nOne aircraft, B-24D 42-40676 (Cabin in the Sky), piloted by First Lieutenant James R. Cason, was struck in the port fin and rudder by a Zero (whether accidentally or deliberately will remain unknown), crashing into the sea with no survivors. The plane’s loss is covered in Missing Air Crew Report 314.\n\nLieutenant Richard W. Lipman, whose detailed, frank, and often moving diary (encompassing November, 1942, through December, 1944) appears in Grey Geese Calling, recorded that, “Cason had his rear stabilizer rammed by a Zero and he spiraled down shooting all the way to explode upon hitting the water. I don’t know but I can’t seem to swallow the fact that the guys I know so well and the ship I flew in from Kualoa to Midway are gone forever. Clean cut Cason, good natured Thompson, “Slick” Moore, McConnell and Kane [?] just out of Cadets. Man, this ain’t for me!”\n\nAlong with Cason, the plane’s crew comprised:\n\n1 Lt. Loren E. Thompson – Co-Pilot (Nehama County, Nebraska)\n\n2 Lt. Robert B. McConnell – Navigator (Multnomah County, Oregon)\n\n2 Lt. Ernest W. Moore – Bombardier (Anderson County, South Carolina)\n\nT/Sgt. Lee R. Sterner – Flight Engineer (Muscatine County, Iowa)\n\nS/Sgt. Lloyd R. Taylor – Radio Operator (Wilson County, Kansas)\n\nS/Sgt. James W. Strope – Gunner (Chicago, Illinois)\n\nSgt. Louis N. Lane – Gunner (Lenawee County, Michigan)\n\nS/Sgt. Harlan G. Davis – Gunner (Harrison County, West Virginia)\n\nSgt. Robert O. Stephens – Gunner (Los Angeles, California)\n\nCpl. Walter F. Kowalski – Photographer (Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania)\n\nHere’s a photograph of eight members of James Cason’s crew, reportedly taken a few hours before this mission, from Cason’s FindAGrave biographical profile, provided by contributor Terry Woodward. The image comes from the scrapbook of Bill Morrison. Unfortunately, no names – “who is who?” – are listed.\n\n…and, also from Bill Morrison’s scrapbook, we find an image of Lt. Cason, as seen in Hawaii in the summer of 1943 (also contributed by Terry Woodward):\n\nAboard another B-24D, 41-23983, 1 Lt. Joseph A. Gall’s Daisy Mae, two crew members were killed and two wounded during attacks by Zero fighters. Lt. Gall and F/O Van Horn crash-landed their bomber at Sand Island, one of the three islands comprising the Midway Atoll (the others are Eastern and Spit Islands).\n\nIncluded in Lt. Gall’s crew were:\n\nF/O John N. Van Horn – Co-Pilot\n\n2 Lt. Benjamin I. Weiss – Navigator – Wounded\n\n2 Lt. Myron W. Jensen – Bombardier – Died of Wounds (Douglas County, Nebraska)\n\nS/Sgt. Arvid B. Ambur – Flight Engineer / Waist Gunner – Wounded\n\nT/Sgt. Thomas Wyckoff – Top Turret Gunner – Wounded\n\nS/Sgt. Robert L. Patterson – Radio Operator / Waist Gunner\n\nS/Sgt. Francis J. Perkins, Jr. – Gunner\n\nS/Sgt. Robert B. Storts – Nose Gunner\n\nS/Sgt. Earl W. Conley – Tail Gunner\n\nSgt. Joseph P. Evans – Photographer – Killed in Action (Tom Green County, Texas)\n\nAs described by Lt. Lipman, “Gall got shot up plenty. His ship I mean. Jenson [sic] got hit in the gut, shoulder and wrist – has a 50-50 chance of living. Sgt. Evans, photographer, got a gut wound and died before returning. There were 2 other injuries on board. There were 200 holes in “Daisy Mae”. I went over and saw it where Gall pulled to a stop on its nose 2 inches from the ocean at the end of the runway. He came in with 3 engines and no brakes.”\n\nHere’s a view of the Midway Atoll taken on November 24, 1941, 14 days before December 7, 1941. (Image 80-G-451086) Eastern Island is in the foreground, and Sand Island is across the entrance channel, in the center background.\n\nThese two images, from B-24 Best Web, show Daisy Mae after her crash-landing, at the water’s edge. Not visible in the lower photograph is the presence of a nose turret (a grafted-on B-24 tail turret) which replaced the bombardier’s “birdcage” typical of B-24Ds.\n\nLt. Jensen’s obituary, from his FindAGrave biographical profile, (contributed by Loren Bender) appears below:\n\nDespite Daisy Mae’s return, Lt. Jensen’s name is commemorated on the Courts of the Missing at the Honolulu Memorial. Quite strangely, it appears that he has no actual grave.\n\n______________________________\n\nAnd, aboard the WICKED WITCH?\n\nDuring the attack by intercepting Zero fighters, the aircraft was struck by a projectile which penetrated the left forward fuselage, directly through the location of the painted WITCH’s left arm. (See photo below.) The shell penetrated Dick’s calf left leg and thigh, the pain and loss of blood rendering him unconscious. According to bombardier Lt. Thrasher, another projectile entered the WITCH in front of the nose wheel, passing between his legs and knocking him away from his bombsight.\n\nLieutenant John Lowry, Dick’s co-pilot, took control of the aircraft, bringing it safely back to Funafuti. After repairs, the WITCH would bear the symbol of one Japanese flag, for the Zero shot down by Sgt. Campbell.\n\nLt. Thrasher described both projectiles as having been 20mm cannon shells (from the Zeros fighters’ Type 99-1 cannon). Though it’s a point of conjecture, given the destructive explosive power of such shells and the evident (fortunate!) seeming absence of a actual explosions within the aircraft, I wonder if the plane was actually struck by .303 machine-gun bullets. Just an idea. If so, this would be consistent with a letter of 30 July sent to Dick’s wife from Adjutant General J.A. Ulio, which specifically states that, “Lieutenant Thompson sustained gunshot wounds…”\n\n______________________________\n\nThis photo, taken some months before the July mission, shows Dick in the cockpit of the WITCH. Note the name “BETTINA” – evidently inspired by the name of his wife, Betty – below the cockpit. A name (“MUGGSIE”) also appeared under the co-pilot’s window, possibly the nickname of John Lowry’s wife, Margaret.\n\n______________________________\n\nThe WITCH was destroyed during a Japanese air raid on Funafuti on November 17, 1943, her incinerated remains being the subject of Army Air Force photos 62903AC / 3A43074 and B-62903AC / A43076, shown below, respectively. While most of the plane has been reduced to aluminum cinders, some parts, such as engines, oxygen bottles, landing gear wheel hubs, the supporting truss for the Sperry ball turret, machine guns, as well as belts of .50 caliber ammunition, are identifiable.\n\nWith the demise of the WITCH, Dick’s crew were assigned to the DOGPATCH EXPRESS, the subject of the two prior posts.\n\n______________________________\n\nThe following three photos, via Rich, show Dick being visited by his crew at Oahu. The men were identified through communication with Rich, and, a close examination the these images. Along with Dick, two men in the photo – (Lt. Jim Thrasher, the bombardier, and Sgt. Larson, a gunner) were not aboard the DOGPATCH EXPRESS on December 21.\n\nSo, at last and at least, we finally know “who” they are…\n\n______________________________\n\nThis “first” picture is identical to the crew photo appearing at Sgt. Roy Gearon’s FindAGrave biographical profile, albeit of much higher resolution. The men are, left to right:\n\nFront row (kneeling):\n\nT/Sgt. Clarence T. Sopko, gunner\n\nSgt. Larson (first name unknown) – gunner\n\nS/Sgt. Carl N. Dell – tail gunner\n\nRear row (standing)\n\nT/Sgt. Roy T. Gearon – Radio Operator\n\nS/Sgt. Earl D. Nielsen – waist gunner\n\n2 Lt. Carl. A. “Mort” Mortenson – navigator\n\nLt. Jim Thrasher – bombardier\n\nS/Sgt. Arnold J. Paradise – gunner / radio operator\n\n2 Lt. John E. “Jack” Lowry, Jr. – co-pilot\n\n______________________________\n\nIn the picture below, the men have shifted positions. Given that all crew members are visible in the image, the picture must have been taken by an anonymous photographer “behind the camera”, perhaps a member of the hospital staff.\n\nAll are standing behind Dick, while S/Sgt. Earl D. Nielsen is kneeling in the front. The men are (left to right):\n\nSgt. Larson\n\nT/Sgt. Clarence T. Sopko\n\nT/Sgt. Roy T. Gearon\n\n2 Lt. Carl. A. “Mort” Mortenson\n\nLt. Jim Thrasher\n\nS/Sgt. Arnold J. Paradise\n\n2 Lt. John E. “Jack” Lowry, Jr.\n\nS/Sgt. Carl N. Dell\n\n______________________________\n\nHere’s a superb photo of the crew’s officer’s. Behind Dick stand:\n\nLt. Jim Thrasher\n\n(Further information about Lt. Thrasher is unknown)\n\n2 Lt. Carl. A. “Mort” Mortenson, 0-738872, Navigator\n\nMr. Harry Walter Mortenson (brother), 1380 Riverside Drive, Lakewood, Oh.\n\n2 Lt. John E. “Jack” Lowry, Jr., 0-800907, Co-Pilot\n\nMrs. Margaret E. Lowry, Jr. (wife), Spring St., Smyrna, Ga.\n\nAlong with the loss of the Cason and Gall crews, Lt. Lipman made note of Dick’s injury, and, Lt. Lowry’s return of the plane to Midway: “Dick Thompson was wounded in the leg at several places and by now he’s probably back at Oahu via an LB-30. It was only a miracle that Lowry was able to land that one OK and on Midway instead of 200 miles out.”\n\n______________________________\n\nFirst Lieutenants George W. Smith and Ralph P. Ortiz, the pilot and bombardier of DOGPATCH EXPRESS on December 21, do not appear in these photos. As such, they were almost certainly shifted from other crews to “fill-in” for Dick and Lt. Jim Thrasher on that date, with Lt. Smith perhaps “taking over” for Dick’s crew after the latter’s July 24 injury. Smith’s receipt of the Air Medal and Purple Heart, and Ortiz’ receipt of the Air Medal, two Oak Leaf Clusters, and Purple Heart, would suggest that they respectively completed from five to ten, and fifteen to twenty, combat missions, prior to December 21.\n\nHowever, it is known that Smith had been injured almost six months previously. As recorded for June 14, 1943, by Lieutenant Lipman, “Well here’s the big story. Today 3 of our ships were to take off for an important photographic mission in the S.W. Pacific. All three were terrifically loaded down – the first two used every foot of the runway and barely cleared the trees then came #3 with me right alongside the runway in a jeep. About half-way down the runway its nose went down and it skidded for about 100 yards till it swerved off onto the highway. Two of its propellers flying off onto the adjacent beach. Well I can tell you that I spotted my underwear then and there. My first thought was to speed over there to see if I could help any of the crew to get out of the plane or to get to the hospital and off I flew in the jeep towards the plane about when I was 50 feet away flames broke out in engine #2 and off I went in the opposite direction only this time twice as fast because the uncomfortable vision of exploding hi-octane gas and exploding ammunition appeared in my mind.\n\nThe fire was put out, however, and the only person really hurt was Smith, the pilot, whose arm was quite smashed by a flying propeller.\n\nMan some experience! I took a lot of pictures but Capt. Peairs of S-2 is going to see them – I hope to get them back.”\n\n______________________________\n\nDick’s wartime scrapbook includes images of his crew’s enlisted men, possibly taken while his crew was undergoing training in the United States. (Further information may – ?- be forthcoming.) Fortunately, Dick had the foresight to record the names of each enlisted man below that man’s individual portrait.\n\nThat scrapbook page, which includes a group photo of the enlisted men, is shown below.\n\nIn this group photo, the men are (left to right):\n\nS/Sgt. Carl N. Dell\n\nSgt. Del Vickio (“Del Vechio” – “Del Vecchio”?)\n\nS/Sgt. Earl D. Neilsen\n\nT/Sgt. Clarence T. Sopko\n\nS/Sgt. Arnold J.

Such date discrepancies can be found for many servicemen still missing from the Second World War, particularly still-missing airmen and naval personnel who were casualties in the Pacific Theater and Asia.

However, here’s an image of his memorial tombstone, at Dale Cemetery in Ossining, New York, followed by a news item from the Citizen-Register, of Ossining, N.Y., on May 22, 1946, regarding memorial services in his honor, which were held on Sunday, May 20, of that year.\n\nBorn 1918\n\nMrs. Florence L.

His name also appeared in an honor roll of WW I, WW II, and Korean War military casualties from Ossining which was published in the Citizen-Register on February 21, 1952.\n\n______________________________\n\nDue to the severity of his wounds, Rick would fly no more combat missions. He faced a very lengthy period of recovery.\n\nThis telegraph to his wife, at her family’s Boyer Street address in Philadelphia, dated July 28, informed Elizabeth Thompson of her husband’s injuries:\n\nREGRET TO INFORM YOU YOUR HUSBAND SECOND LIEUTENANT RICHARD S THOMPSON WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED IN ACTION ON TWENTY FOUR JULY IN THE PACIFIC AREA REPORT FURTHER STATES MAKING NORMAL IMPROVEMENT YOU WILL BE ADVISED AS REPORTS OF CASUALTIES ARE RECEIVED\n\nULIO THE ADJUTANT GENERAL\n\n______________________________\n\nDick’s name appears (top right) in this casualty list published by the Philadelphia Inquirer on August 12, 1943, which represents only a part of the larger, nationwide casualty list released that day by the War Department.\n\n_____________________________\n\nRich surmises that his father was well enough to travel back to the United States by October of 1943, based on a telegram – from Dick to Elizabeth – dated on the 18th of that month.\n\nSome time around Christmas, 1943, while recovering at Brooke Army Hospital (now Brooke Army Medical Center) at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, Dick was featured in a broadcast on Armed Forces Radio.\n\nIn the photo below, the civilian holding the microphone is Dick Smith, the officer is Brooke Army Hospital Commander Brigadier General B.C. Beach, and the nurse is 1 Lt. Florence E. Judd, who made a full career as a military nurse, eventually rising to the rank of Major. According to George E. Omer’s 1957 article in Kansas History (“An Army Hospital: From Horses to Helicopters”), she, “…became the Fort Riley hospital chief nurse following an assignment at Walter Reed Army Hospital. Major Judd earned her R.N. degree in 1934 from Saint Mary’s Hospital in East Saint Louis and her postgraduate studies have earned a B.S. in nursing education from Columbia University and an M.S. in hospital administration from Baylor University.”\n\nAn excerpt of this interview follows this image of Dick, who appears to have an understandably pensive expression. Note especially the text…\n\n“[Dick cut this part out: It’s a pretty sight, that flack, red and green fire bursting in the air around you.],” which presumably was never broadcast.\n\n…and…\n\nSMITH: That must have been a wonderful crew you had.\n\nTHOMPSON: They were swell. And I have been pretty upset about the latest news I’ve had about them. I got shipped home with this leg but they – they stayed in the fight. I’ve been told recently the plane is missing and that means all of the crew too.\n\nWell, there are some events for which the fewer words, the better.\n\nThe transcript of the broadcast follows…\n\nSMITH: Wherever our forces go, the Army Nurses Corps follows. Wherever the fighting is, they are near by – and these boys in this hospital can tell you it is a wonderful thing to have them. When a man is wounded, it is comforting indeed, to know they are present, to be in their capable, responsible hands. Many of the nurses here in Brooke General Hospital have seen duty overseas. For instance, here is First Lieutenant Florence E. Judd. She put in a year’s service in a base hospital in the Fiji Islands. It was a magnificent job you nurses did there, Lt. Judd. I spent some time in that hospital you were in – and I say thank you.\n\nJUDD: You needn’t thank me or any other Nurse. I often think the hard work we did there, night and day, was its own reward. The lives we saved in those hospitals were worth all the work – and we felt that we were actually doing something in this fight for freedom everybody is always talking about.\n\nSMITH: You had to work hard in those hospitals.\n\nJUDD: Yes – everything was difficult because at that time we were starting from scratch. We were rushed there immediately after Pearl Harbor and had with us only such equipment as could be carried quickly. It was a rush job but I’m proud to say that it was also a good job. Some facilities were not comparable to those here at home, but we had the best equipment, best doctors, the best trained corpsmen – and it was amazing to see how rapidly the boys recovered from their injuries.\n\nSMITH: You want to be sent overseas again?\n\nJUDD: Definitely. Once you have seen the war at close hand, you feel strange in the ordinary, peaceful atmosphere of home again. You keep recalling all the suffering you have seen. You want to get back into it to see that you can do to lessen it. You feel guilty enjoying anything when you know how miserable, how dreadful are the things our men must face. Maybe what you do is very little, but at least, you are in it.\n\nSMITH: Don’t you feel you are in it here, serving in this hospital which is receiving overseas casualties?\n\nJUDD: Of course, I do. But this is home. Over there the men are far from home. It is a terrible thing to be wounded far from home.\n\nSMITH: It must be.\n\nJUDD: But we never heard the boys complain. They were the best patients I ever worked with. They were appreciative of even the- least attention.\n\nTHOMPSON: And they should have been. They had the best nurses in the world to give them attention.\n\nJUDD: Thank you, sir.\n\nTHOMPSON: I’m Lieutenant Richard S. Thompson, Mr. Smith. I want to say a thing or two on this broadcast, if I may.\n\nSMITH: Of course, you may.\n\nTHOMPSON: Just something I’ve had on my chest.\n\nSMITH: Go ahead.\n\nTHOMPSON: I was in the Air Force, pilot of a bomber on patrols out of Hawaii.\n\nSMITH: Is that where you were wounded?\n\nTHOMPSON: Oh, no. I got mine, flying in a nuisance raid over Wake Island.\n\nSMITH: Tell us about that.\n\nTHOMPSON: Well, you know Wake is a pretty small island –\n\nSMITH: But a famous one.\n\nTHOMPSON: That’s right. It cost the Japs plenty to take it from our Marines, and they have it well defended today. They mean to make it cost us when we take it back. We went over on our raid one day about noon. And we were very lucky. We caught twenty Japanese Zero planus on the ground. I’m pleased to report our aim was good and we put all of them out of commission. But we didn’t get away scot free – at least I didn’t.\n\nSMITH: What happened?\n\nTHOMPSON: Well, there were thirty Zeros which weren’t on the ground – and they weren’t out of commission either. They settled on us like hornets. The flack was bad, too. [Dick cut this part out: It’s a pretty sight, that flack, red and green fire bursting in the air around you.] And it scares the devil out of you. It’s meant for you. Just a few more feet in your direction – and it is yours forever.\n\nSMITH: Was it flack which wounded you?\n\nTHOMPSON: No – gun fire from one of the Zeros. Ripped right through my leg. I passed out: so I missed most of the excitement. The co-pilot later told me they downed nine of those thirty Zeros.\n\nSMITH: That must have been a wonderful crew you had.\n\nTHOMPSON: They were swell. And I have been pretty upset about the latest news I’ve had about them. I got shipped home with this leg but they – they stayed in the fight. I’ve been told recently the plane is missing and that means all of the crew too.\n\nSMITH: That’s not very good news.\n\nTHOMPSON: But that isn’t what I had on my mind to say. I’ve get a baby boy, three months old.at home, and I’ve never seen him.\n\nSMITH: Surely you’ll get to see him soon.\n\nTHOMPSON: Yes, right away. But think of the thousands of other American men overseas who won’t get to see their children soon – even for a year or so, maybe never. Millions of men, average American fellows like the boys you have talked with tonight, are spending the best years of their life away from the people they love, away from the opportunities they had planned to take advantage of. We all know it’s got to be that way. And you don’t hear those men complaining, though I can tell you they get pretty burned up sometimes at the softness and blindness of certain people back home, people whom the war has never touched and who don’t know what it is like to fight an enemy who isn’t playing a game with you but means to kill you for keeps. Yeah, I’ve got an injured leg, but at that I came out light. Those boys who talked to you a little while ago didn’t tell you all the things they know about that jungle warfare going on – right this minute – in the South Pacific. They talked about foxholes. You know what those foxholes are like? They’re not nice, clean holes in the earth. They are holes that the jungle rains fill with water and mud – and yet those boys have to stay in them. Sometimes they fill up with blood and you are in that, too. Those filthy, muddy holes become a man’s home. And that jungle they talk about. It is as bad as an enemy; it’s no pretty green land of palms and flowers. It is a matted mass of vines and trees and at times the ground beneath your feet is not ground but mud up to your knees and up to your thighs. And worst of all it hides an enemy you can’t see – all around you, sniping at you from a tree top or hiding on the ground right under you. And that enemy – the boys didn’t tell you all they know about him either. They didn’t tell you about those wounded men the Japs had found and slashed to shreds before our medical corpsmen could get them back to the aid stations. I listen to the radio and read the newspapers and they talk about what a good investment War Bonds are and how if you buy them you’re keeping down inflation. Frankly, I don’t get it. Does the government have to beg you to buy War Bonds? If you had seen sore of the things we’ve seen, you’d jump at the chance to get ammunition and other supplies to the men overseas. What is all this begging you to buy War Bonds anyhow? I know a lot of people are buying plenty of War Bonds, but what’s wrong with the rest of you? I don’t get it.\n\nSIIITH: We return you now to our downtown studio.\n\n______________________________\n\nHere’s a wartime article from an un-named (probably Philadelphia-area) neighborhood newspaper, covering the experiences of Dick and his brother Arthur. Note that the story mentions Dick having piloted a “Fortress” (!) back to Funafuti, when the aircraft was actually (!) a B-24, and Lieutenant Lowry took control of the plane.\n\nAnd, here are two photos of the Thompson family, at Brooke Army Hospital. Brother Art and his wife Kay stand at rear, while Dick, Betty, and baby son Richard, Jr. (born in September, 1943) in foreground.\n\nUnfortunately, Dick’s leg would never completely heal. It was amputated in 1946, with Dick being medically retired from the military.\n\n______________________________\n\nLife moves forward.\n\nHere’s a picture of Dick in a 1974 advertisement for the Sun Petroleum Company. However, there’s no actual recollection of how he came to work for Sun. As remembered by Rich, his grandfather [Dick’s father], “…Everett sold Cabot paints so being around a salesman must have turned him into one. His brother Art had a paint store in Long Beach, CA so that sort of thing was in their DNA. … It’s easy for me to say he was very good at it as he was chosen to appear in trade magazines representing Sunoco. …He enjoyed working for Sun for at least most of his career. I seem to remember however, that towards the end of his career, it was like they were trying to push out the good old boys and their way of doing business over 3 martini lunches – but that’s just my take. I think he was about ready for more golf, flying to Myrtle Beach for more golf, visiting his brother in CA and doing things not possible while raising a family.”\n\nThis image, from the late 1970s, was taken at Pearson Airport, Vancouver, Washington. Rich, “lived on the hill behind the airport in late ‘70s and dad really liked being able to sit in the house or porch and look across the field at “Joliet” (“four niner J”) while he was having a martini.”\n\nThough the Second World War changed Dick’s life, it did not dominate it. For example, though letters were naturally exchanged with his family after his wound in 1943, he did not keep a diary. According to Dick, “He didn’t have any really bad / negative things to say about his situation or the enemy (e.g. I have one letter where his mother makes mention of “those dirty japs”!)”\n\nSimilarly, Dick’s discussions of and attitude about the war remained “light”. Rich remembers, “…photos of him shortly after the amputation of him showing off his “stump” at family gatherings and waving it like his arm at folks that were there.\n\n“While growing up, I remember waking up one night when the folks had an adult poker party going and his prostheses was in the center of the table to cover a bet.\n\n“I took him to a party here in Oregon while he was visiting where there was a pool in the back yard. One of the smart-asses among the guests … took the liberty of pushing him into the pool – fully dressed. He could swim like a fish and came back over to the edge of the pool where the ‘perp’ was standing, took off his leg and threw it up in the deck and said – ‘Now look what you’ve done!’ One of the few times I’ve ever known that guest to be speechless.\n\nBut, he did seem to have been particularly close to co-pilot, John Lowry, in whose memory he was proud to have named his second son, John. In time, John Thompson attended college in Atlanta, and became friends (“…he was given V.I.P. treatment…”) with Lowry’s wife Margaret, who had remarried and had twin daughters and lived in Smyrna.\n\nAs remembered by John, “There were two family ‘reunions’ with Margaret Lowry / Mellon. The first was in 1966 when Mom came down to pick me up after my first year at college. There was a relationship between the two wives which indicates that they were together during some part (training)? of Dad and Jack’s early military career. The second and last reunion … was in 1969 when my parents … drove down for my graduation.”\n\n______________________________\n\nThe past remains within the present. In June of 2015, this took the form of a visit by the Collings Foundation Wings of Freedom Tour to Portland, Oregon. Rich, “…got there Sunday afternoon and didn’t even get to see the planes in the air but vowed to return at next opportunity and participate in what they call a “flight experience” and actually take a ride in the B-24 WITCHCRAFT.\n\n“During the visit, the flight engineer found me and three other people up on the flight deck. He wanted us out of there and apologized that they forget to put the ‘NO ENTRY’ rope across the opening. While talking with one of the people – an elderly gentleman accompanied by his family – the engineer learned that this fellow flew B-24s during WW II training pilots, and became very cordial, telling the old pilot, have a seat, stay as long as he liked, and insisted he leave a note and sign his log book.\n\nThen I saw my chance and dug out an old photo of dad with his head out the pilot’s window on the WICKED WITCH. He asked “Who is this”? I said, “My Father”. His jaw dropped to the floor! Once recomposed, he squatted down and looked down the bomb bay catwalk, now crowded with people and told them he had a pilot and the son of another pilot on the flight deck and asked for their patience while we finished up.\n\nI met the engineer later and showed him the photos you’ve been looking at and gave him a big THANK YOU.\n\nGreat day!”\n\nThe memory of that 2015 day – full circle from July of 1943 – is shown below.\n\n______________________________\n\nLooking back, Rich’s father, “…was always quick to relate how lucky he was to have only lost his leg and that the whole crew went out on the next mission and ended up missing in action.”\n\nAnd that brings us to a story that, whether true or apocryphal, is deep with meaning, carrying a message universal and perhaps eternal. Curiously, it is a very old Chinese Taoist story about a simple farmer in a poor country village.\n\nWhile such a tale nature appears – on first reading – to be completely unrelated to aviation and military history, on contemplation, it actually encompasses both, and much more.\n\nFor, it is a tale about the nature of life.\n\n______________________________\n\nHe [the farmer] was considered very well-to-do, because he owned a horse which he used for plowing and for transportation.\n\nOne day his horse ran away.\n\nAll the neighbors exclaimed how terrible this was, but the farmer simply said,\n\n“Maybe.”\n\nA few days later the horse returned and brought two wild horses with it.\n\nThe neighbors all rejoiced at his good fortune, but the farmer just said,\n\n“Maybe.”\n\nThe next day the farmer’s son tried to ride one of the wild horses; the horse threw him and broke his leg.\n\nThe neighbors all offered their sympathy for his misfortune, but the farmer again said,\n\n“Maybe.”\n\nThe next week conscription officers came to the village to take young men for the army.\n\nThey rejected the farmer’s son because of his broken leg.\n\nWhen the neighbors told him how lucky he was, the farmer replied,\n\n“Maybe.”\n\n(Maybe.)\n\n– February, 2019\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI’d like to extend my deep appreciation to Rich Thompson and his brother and sister, for sharing the photographs, documents, and information that have made this blog post possible.\n\nReferences and Suggested Readings\n\nBell, Dana, Air Force Colors – Pacific and Home Front, 1942-47, Squadron / Signal Publications, Carrollton, Tx., 1997\n\nBirdsall, Steve, B-24 Liberator in Action – Aircraft Number 21, Squadron / Signal Publications Inc., Warren, Mi., 1975\n\nBlue, Allan G., The B-24 Liberator – A Pictorial History, Charles Scribner’s Sons, New York, N.Y., 1975\n\nCleveland, W.M., Grey Geese Calling : Pacific Air War History of the 11th Bombardment Group (H), 1940-1945, Portsmouth, N.H., 1992\n\nDavis, Larry, B-24 Liberator in Action – Aircraft Number 80, Squadron / Signal Publications Inc., Carrollton, Tx., 1987\n\nForman, Wallace R., B-24 Nose Art Name Directory – Includes Group, Squadron and Aircraft Serial Numbers and Photo Availability, Specialty Press, North Branch, Mn., 1996\n\nHoward, Clive and Whitley, Joe, One Damned Island After Another, The University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, N.C., 1946\n\nLivingstone, Bob, Under the Southern Cross: The B-24 Liberator in the South Pacific, Turner Publishing Company, Paducah, Ky., 1998\n\nRust, Kenn C., Seventh Air Force Story, Historical Aviation Album, Temple City, Ca., 1979\n\nRust, Kenn C. and Bell, Dana, Thirteenth Air Force Story, Historical Aviation Album, Temple City, Ca., 1981 (The Grey Geese were assigned to the 13th AF from January through May of 1943.

Taken prisoner, they all returned to the United States after the war’s end.\n\nThe loss of the aircraft covered in this blog post – B-24D Liberator 42-63792 of the 36th Bomb Squadron, 328th (later 801st) Bomb Group, 8th Air Force, covered in Missing Air Crew Report 3666, resulted in a different outcome: One crew member evaded capture, but one aviator was killed in the loss of the aircraft, and the remainder spent the rest of the war as POWs.\n\nIn historical and archival terms, the Luftgaukommando Report (KU 1054) covering the loss of this bomber so far has the distinction of having the largest number of photographic images I’ve found in any KU Report I’ve examined.\n\nThis is probably attributable to the nature of the electronic equipment found in the plane, which comprised three notable items: 1) A BC-929-A “Rebecca” Radar Interrogator, 2) An APN-1 Radar Altimeter, and 3) A M.C.R.-1 Miniature Communications Receiver.\n\n____________________\n\nThis nicknameless Liberator, piloted by 1 Lt. Frank G. McDonald, squadron letter “U”, was lost at 23:30 on the evening of March 2 – 3, 1944, during an operation dubbed “Musician 5”. The Crew’s Mission Report for March 3, 1944 describes the plane’s load as 3 packages and 13 containers (both of unspecified contents), and 10 leaflets (containers of leaflets?).\n\nRoy Tebbutt’s extraordinarily comprehensive document “Aircraft lost on Allied Force’s Special Duty Operations & Associated Roll of Honour” states that the plane was shot down by flak mounted on railway cars. The crash location in his compilation is stated as “Hem-Hardinval, Fienvillers (Somme)”, France, which is consistent with the location given in the KU Report as “five kilometers southwest of Doullens”.\n\nCo-pilot Lt. Frederick C. Kelly’s Escape & Evasion Casualty Questionnaire (one page of which is included in the MACR; the transcribed account is given below), states that the propeller on the #1 engine was damaged, the #2 engine was on fire, the #3 engine was struck by flak and inoperative, the tail turret would not work because of damage to the hydraulic system. And unsurprisingly, the fuselage was peppered with flak holes.\n\nHere is a page from the KU Report describing the plane’s wreckage. Note that the investigator identified the plane as a “Boeing Fortress II”.

Sergeant Goswick appears to have been captured by May 11. The German crew roster in the MACR (translated from the German KU Report) also lists the capture of Lieutenants McDonald and Kendall, and Sergeant De Coste, but does not specify the dates and places of their capture. The surnames of Lieutenant Kelly, and Sergeants Ross and Jennings appear in the translated crew roster with no further information. The 801st/492nd BG website specifically states that some of the POWs had been betrayed to the Germans by collaborators.\n\nWhat about Lieutenant Kelly? As mentioned above, he was the proverbial “one that got away”.\n\nA transcript of the typewritten account he composed for his Escape & Evasion Report (E&E Report 699) appears below. (Notably, what follows isn’t a verbatim transcript. I’ve included those few sentences and phrases which were “struck out” of the original document, as struck-through text.)\n\n____________________\n\nLIEUTENANT FREDERICK C. KELLY’S ACCOUNT OF ESCAPE AND EVASION\n\nWe were shot down by flak. The plane crashed and a couple of us were thrown out. We walked several miles and slept the rest of the night in a gully, where we also stayed the next day. That night some Frenchmen who had seen us brought us bread. We continued walking, and lay up in a shed on the edge of town, and spent the next day there. In the evening a girl who had come upon us gave us food. At nightfall we continued on our journey southwards, found a barn from which no dogs scared us away, and rested part of the night in a barn.\n\nThe third morning we approached an old man. He said that the women of the village would take care of us. We were led down the main street of the village, still dressed in our flying clothes, and taken in out of sight. We were then given civilian clothes and taken to a house from which our journey was arranged.\n\nHowever, when I got down in the S of France something went wrong with my helpers’ connections, of the people who were helping me. I was given a railroad ticket to another town and continued the journey to Spain on my own. After the train ride I walked out of the town and spent the night in bushes by a river. The next morning I made the mistake of walking to the NE. I spent the night outside a village and approached help the next morning and was told to take a bus to a town where I could find directions for getting to Spain. The bus, however, went only as far as the town at which I left the railroad. So I continued walking S and was taken in by a peasant who agreed to shelter me if I would leave my identity papers with him for the night. It seemed that the farther S in France I went the more suspicious the people were.\n\nI walked to the town to which I had been directed, was fed by a peasant, and went on to a town farther to the S. On the way a French gendarme checked my identity papers and asked me where I was going. When I told him he a"
