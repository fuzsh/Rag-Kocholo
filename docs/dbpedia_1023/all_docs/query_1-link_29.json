        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\n140 I hated going more than a few days, or as long as a week, without flying. I just did not want to lose my touch at the wheel. Like a young teacher returning to the classroom after summer vacation, so it was with me. The B-24 was a demanding beast, and I would never take her for granted. The week’s leave at Capri, combined with bad weather before and after, left us with not flying a single mission for almost a month. During our first two months, we flew twenty-one missions, rarely having more than a few days off between flights. Returning to San Giovanni from Capri, we found the pace of our operations much different. Because of poor weather mainly, but also, because of the arrival of many new crews, I flew missions less regularly, only two missions each in December and January, and then three in February.1 This was a frustrating time, mostly cold and rainy, sloshing through mud to get anywhere. We flew a couple of practice missions, but outside of that, things were dull. The three months after Capri proved a challenge in many unanticipated ways. 1. By December, the Fifteenth Air Force had two crews for every bomber. Mahoney, Fifteenth Air Force Against the Axis, 294. Chapter 5 ✦ ✦ ✦ ✦ ✦ Slow March towards Thirty-five Missions Slow March Towards Thirty-Five Missions 141 Mission 22 • December 11, 19442 Target: Southeast Goods Depot3 Vienna, Austria At last! After twenty-five days without flying—a completed mission. The weather has kept us down a lot.4 The last few days we have taken off, but failed to reach the target because of heavy weather. On one of those aborts, number 1 engine lost power on the takeoff run, but I pulled back all engines before the wheels left the ground. 5 And yesterday, I became separated from the formation in clouds just as they were turning for home, lost them and returned to the base alone. Many others had the same experience. We came in over the Adriatic under a 500 foot ceiling, landed on a muddy runway in a heavy rain.6 Today, I had a new first pilot fly as my copilot, Lieutenant Frick – a good boy – keeps us supplied with cigarettes.7 We flew number 3 position in Able box.8 We were briefed for bad weather and 190 heavy guns. Uneventful trip up. Target finally in sight, good bomb run. Lots of flak but none hit Lotta Laffs. One ship in Baker box blew up over the target. The crew counted six chutes coming out.9 It was really cold, 45 degrees below. At one time my throttles almost froze solid. Tomorrow, we are deputy lead in a 3 ship box.10 Our group will be sending up only 12 to 15 ships, less than half normal. I hear it’s a sort of experiment. It’ll be either 2. Forty-nine B-24s with an escort of forty P-51s attacked the Southeast Freight Depot in Vienna. Ibid., 295. 3. Freight depots were often adjacent to railroad marshalling yards and were part of the focus of Fifteenth Air Force in trying to disrupt the German transportation system. Robert Ehlers argues, “The chaos brought on by the bombing is difficult to overstate. Every main and alternate route closed, most permanently, to anything but small trains rushed through after the repair crews made the lines operational until the next raids.” Ehlers, The Mediterranean Air War, 380–1. 4. The 454th was able to fly missions on sixteen days in December. The weather prevented missions on the other days. 454th Bombardment Group – Heavy – For the Month of December, n.d., Air Force Historical Research Agency, Reel B0601 – 454 Records, 1066. 5. The 454th began missions on December 7 and 9 but could not complete them. The mission Faulkner had to abort was probably one of these.
