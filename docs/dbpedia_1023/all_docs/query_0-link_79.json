In 2009 I uploaded, to Scribd, a collection of research documents and photos proving that the English kings began establishing what became another \"Empire on Which the Sun Never Sets\" by genocide, mass-murder and terrorism of the indigenous Celtic people of Scotland and Ireland. \n \nThis book takes up the story with the notorious Henry the Eighth and what he his clan did to the rest of the world over the next 500 years of exploitation. \n \nPlease watch my song Five Hundred Years on YouTube, and you may understand what I'm talking about. \n \nRomesh Senewiratne \n16 May 2013",
