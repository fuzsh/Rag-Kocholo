Author Christopher Schmitt has just gone shopping for you. By compiling hundreds of CSS recipes into this single book, he’s giving you a one-stop shop where you can pick up the ingredients to create stylish, flexible web pages. When I was first learning the wonders of CSS, trial and error prevailed as my primary means for discovering its creative powers: “Hmm, I’d like to turn this list into a horizontal navigation bar,” or “I need to stylize the components of a form using CSS for a client.” Several hours (or days) would go by after plugging in various CSS rules, removing some, and experimenting with endless combinations. This hit-or-miss approach worked (at times), and although a curious person like me may even consider it “fun,” it sure ate up a lot of time in the process. I wish I’d had this book. Instead of stumbling upon the solution for styling every element of the page, I could have just thumbed through CSS Cookbook, grabbed the recipe, and started baking. The guesswork would’ve been eliminated, and I could have instead spent my time doing what I love to do best: creating. The modular nature of this book makes it an indispensable reference for designers and developers of any caliber. Posed with problems from how best to handle typography, links, and navigation to even entire page layouts, Christopher clearly explains not only the styles necessary to complete the task, but also the caveats that may be attached for certain browsers. By additionally explaining the helpful workarounds to everyday CSS problems, he’s arming you with the critical knowledge you need to be a successful CSS designer. For example, a recent article told of a common usability problem: when posed with a Submit button at the end of a form, some users just can’t shake their double-clicking habits. The button may get clicked twice, with the results of the form getting duplicated. What to do? A solution wasn’t offered in the aforementioned article. However, unsurprisingly, there’s a recipe in this very book that’ll solve this little problem using CSS and a dash of JavaScript.\n\nxv\n\nAnd that’s the heart of this book’s purpose: real problems and the goods that will deliver real results. You’ve heard about how CSS will simplify your life, making pages lighter and easier to maintain. Now it’s time to start using it, and with this book, you’ll have one less excuse not to. So, my advice is to clear off a space on your desk because CSS Cookbook will take up permanent residency in the corner. Hopefully for you, that spot will be easily within arm’s reach. —Dan Cederholm Founder, SimpleBits (http://www.simplebits.com) Salem, Massachusetts\n\nxvi | Foreword\n\nPreface\n\nEvery book tells a story—even books on web design tips and techniques. This book is about Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS as it’s commonly abbreviated. CSS is a simple standardized syntax that gives designers extensive control over the presentation of their web pages and is an essential component of web design today. Compared to 1990s-era development techniques, CSS gives web designers greater control over their designs so that they can spend less time editing and maintaining their websites. CSS also extends beyond traditional web design to designing and controlling the look of a web page when it is printed. You don’t need any special hardware or software to design web pages. The basic requirements are a computer, a modern browser such as Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer for Windows (to name a few), and your favorite web page editor. A web page editor can be anything from a simple text editor such as Notepad (for Windows) or TextEdit (for the Mac), to a full-fledged WYSIWYG tool such as Adobe Dreamweaver set in code view. Now you know what the book is about. Let me tell you its story, its history. Some would say web design officially began when Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, put together the first set of web pages. Others would say it began when the center tag came about due to Netscape’s own extension of HTML. Though it might seem ironic, I happen to believe that this new media really got started with books. The books that helped lead the way to the dot-com boom in the 1990s started with Lynda Weinman’s first full-color book about web graphics, Designing Web Graphics (Pearson), which was published in January 1996, and then David Siegel’s Creating Killer Web Sites (Hayden), published several months later that same year. These two books helped to kick off the web revolution as much as those who invented the technologies that made the Web possible.\n\nxvii\n\nHowever, the methods written in those books, although cutting edge for their time, are out of date in today’s context. As I write these pages, it has been 13 years since those initial books were published; the same year Weinman’s and Siegel’s first books about web design came out describing how to use font tags, nested tables, and single-pixel GIFs was the same year CSS was first introduced. CSS has come a long way since then. With more than 13 years of development put into it, it’s only now—with the advent of Internet Explorer 8 for Windows reaching a large audience—that web designers, developers, and everyday users of browsers can use CSS2 to its intended potential. In addition to IE8, other browsers are making their presence known, and are often ahead of Internet Explorer in supporting new features. Browsers such as Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Opera are implementing the latest specifications of CSS3 and HTML5 as quickly as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Working Groups’ members are bandying them about. If you are serious about building today’s usable and cutting-edge websites, use CSS and CSS Cookbook, a collection of CSS-based solutions to common web design problems. Together they can help you create your own bit of web design history.\n\nAudience This book is for web designers and developers struggling with the problems of designing with CSS. With this book, web builders can solve common problems associated with CSS-enabled web page designs. CSS Cookbook is ideal for people who have wanted to use CSS for web projects but have shied away from learning a new technology. If you are this type of reader, use the solutions in the book one or a few at a time. Use it as a guidebook and come back to it when you are ready or need to learn another technique or trick. Even if you consider yourself an expert in CSS, but not in basic design knowledge, this book is useful to have next to your computer. It covers elements of design from web typography to page layouts, and even includes a chapter on designing with CSS to get you motivated.\n\nAssumptions This Book Makes This book makes several assumptions about you, dear reader. One assumption is that you possess some web design or development experience either as a hobbyist, a student, or a professional. Since CSS Cookbook is neither an introduction to CSS nor a book that goes into great detail on how CSS should work in browsers, people at the start of their web design or\n\nxviii | Preface\n\ndevelopment education might find this book a bit more challenging than a general or complete book on the theory of CSS. If you are looking for a book that delves into such topics about the CSS specification, you should look into CSS: The Definitive Guide, Third Edition, by Eric A. Meyer (O’Reilly), which serves as a solid complement to this book. If you use a program such as Adobe Dreamweaver only in its WYSIWYG or design mode and rarely, if ever, touch the markup in code view, you might have trouble getting the most out of this book right away. To get an introduction to handcoding HTML, look into Learning Web Design by Jennifer Niederst Robbins (O’Reilly). Although WYSIWYG tools allow for CSS-enabled designs, some of the tools have not caught up with some of the unorthodox approaches recommended in this book and might cause some trouble if you attempt to implement them by editing solely in WYSIWYG mode. To benefit from this book, you must be able to edit HTML and CSS by hand. Some of the code in this book can be re-created using dialog-box-driven web page building applications, but you may run into some problems along the way trying to click tabs and enter CSS values into said tabs. Another assumption is that web designers and developers practicing their craft with HTML table-based layouts, font tags, and single-pixel GIFs will find this book both helpful and frustrating. Web designers who are practicing or are more familiar with these old production methods are going to find CSS challenging. The “browser hell” often associated with cross-browser development still exists, as browser vendors tended to interpret the CSS specification differently or didn’t implement the CSS specification completely. This frustration is a natural part of the learning process. You should approach the process of learning how to design with CSS with patience and a good sense of humor. The good news is that the major browser vendors seem to have solved the problem. The recent version releases of browsers appear to have implemented CSS correctly; however, attempting cross-browser support for the older or less-popular browsers may still be a challenging exercise. Yet the benefits of CSS, including greater control over the look and feel of web pages and easier maintenance over multipage websites, outweigh the hardships associated with browser hell. A handful of solutions within this book use JavaScript and the JavaScript framework, jQuery. This book assumes that you have a general knowledge of the scripting language as well as the ability to successfully include JavaScript code into a web document. If this is a hurdle, I recommend that you download the code from the O’Reilly website to get a firsthand look at a working example. On the other hand, if you were looking for a solution-focused book that deals with recipes where CSS plays a minor\n\nPreface | xix\n\nrole compared to JavaScript, that book would be JavaScript & DHTML Cookbook by Danny Goodman (O’Reilly). The final assumption is that you desire a resource that provides fast answers to common CSS-based web design problems. The solutions in this book, covering everything from web-based typography to multicolumn layouts, are geared for modern browsers with version numbers later than or equal to 5, with the exception of Safari and Chrome. Whenever possible, I mention when a technique might cause problems in modern browsers. Although there is a chapter on hacks and workarounds to hide stylesheets from browsers with poor implementations of the complete CSS specification, this book makes no assurances that you are going to create pixel-perfect designs in every browser. Even with traditional web design methods from the 1990s, this has never been the case (see http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/ for more information).\n\nContents of This Book For me, the best use for a book such as this is to crack it open from time to time when trying to solve a particular problem, which I did with the first edition of the book to refresh my memory while writing this edition. To that end, this book will serve you well on or near your desk—always within reach to resolve a problem about CSS or web design. However, feel free to read the book from its first page to its last. The following paragraphs review the contents of each chapter and the appendixes. Chapter 1, Using HTML Basics, goes over semantic markup solutions on content. Chapter 2, CSS Basics, discusses the general concepts of CSS as well as some techniques associated with best practices in development. Chapter 3, Web Typography, discusses how to use CSS to specify fonts in web pages, headings, pull quotes, and indents within paragraphs as well as other solutions. Chapter 4, Images, discusses CSS techniques directly associated with manipulating styles and properties related to web graphics. Chapter 5, Page Elements, covers a loose collection of items that don’t necessarily fit in every chapter, but that all carry a theme of affecting the design of the overall page. Solutions in this chapter cover the topics of centering elements, setting a background image, placing a border on a page, and other techniques. Chapter 6, Lists, describes how to style basic list items in various ways. Solutions include cross-browser indentation, making hanging indents, inserting custom images for list markers, and more. Chapter 7, Links and Navigation, shows how to use CSS to control the presentation of a link and sets of links. Solutions range from the basic, such as removing an underline from links, to the more complex, such as creating a dynamic visual menu. xx | Preface\n\nChapter 8, Forms, discusses how to work around the basic ways browsers render forms. You’ll learn how to set styles to specific form elements, set a submit-once-only button, and style a login form, among other things. Chapter 9, Tables, shows how to style HTML tables. Although CSS can help you eliminate HTML table-based designs, sometimes you may need to style tabular data such as calendars and statistical data. This chapter includes solutions for setting cell padding, removing gaps in table cells with images, and styling a calendar. Chapter 10, Designing Web Pages for Printing, talks about how you can use CSS to engineer layouts. The solutions in this chapter include methods for designing onecolumn layouts as well as multicolumn layouts. Chapter 11, Page Layouts, provides information on how to set styles that are used when printing web pages. Solutions discuss how to add a separate print stylesheet to a web page, set styles for web forms, and insert URLs after links. Chapter 12, Hacks, Workarounds, and Troubleshooting, provides solutions that enable you to hide stylesheets that certain browsers cannot handle. Recipes include hiding stylesheets for browsers such as Netscape Navigator 4, Internet Explorer 5 for Windows, and others. Chapter 13, Designing with CSS, is an inspirational chapter. Focusing on the notion that CSS is merely a tool that implements design, this chapter covers topics such as playing with enlarging type sizes, working with contrast, and building a panoramic presentation. Chapter 14, Interacting with JavaScript, demonstrates how to use the JavaScript framework, jQuery, in conjunction with CSS for more advanced effects. Appendix A is a collection of links and websites you can access to learn more about CSS. Appendix B is a listing of CSS 2.1 properties that can help you define the look and feel of, or, in some cases, the sound of HTML elements on a web page. Appendix C is a listing of selectors, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements available within CSS 2.1. Appendix D is a listing of selectors and pseudo-classes available from the new CSS3 specification. Appendix E takes a look at how various modern browsers handle the display of form elements. The print book version contains an introduction to this appendix, as well as information on how you can access the full version. The online version of this appendix contains lookup tables that allow you to quickly check out which CSS properties are supported, as well as the entire form element review that contains screenshots of every test.\n\nPreface | xxi\n\nConventions Used in This Book The following typographical conventions are used in this book: Italic Indicates new terms, URLs, email addresses, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, directories, and Unix utilities Constant width\n\nIndicates commands, options, switches, variables, attributes, keys, functions, types, classes, namespaces, methods, modules, properties, parameters, values, objects, events, event handlers, XML tags, HTML tags, macros, the contents of files, or the output from commands Constant width bold\n\nShows commands or other text that should be typed literally by the user Constant width italic\n\nShows text that should be replaced with user-supplied values This icon signifies a tip, suggestion, or general note.\n\nThis icon indicates a warning or caution.\n\nUsing Code Examples This book is here to help you get your job done.

To set you on the right path with HTML, this chapter runs through the basics of using HTML well. You’ll explore basic but critical techniques for creating an HTML page, validating the markup to make sure it’s free of any typos and errors, and taking advantage of new possibilities for adding video and audio with HTML5. If you feel you’re an old hand at this, feel free to skim the chapter. Even a review of the chapter should help you build some good habits that will ease your work.\n\nStructuring Documents To build a design for your web pages, first there must be content in a web document, usually a simple text file. That content within a text file needs to be tagged with what is called HyperText Markup Language, more commonly referred to as HTML. HTML provides structure to documents through the use of elements. When you wrap these elements with tags, such as p for paragraphs and h2 for headings, throughout the content, the web page starts to form an inherent HTML document structure. The browser then applies its own stylesheet to render what is known as the default rendering of the web page onto this document structure. This default look and feel won’t win any design awards. It’s a starting point that allows the presentation or design to be associated through Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript more cleanly to provide appearance and movement to the web page.\n\n1\n\nSemantic Markup This chapter is a primer on how to code semantic HTML. Semantic markup is the “radical” notion that we use the appropriate HTML element for its respective content. For example, to denote a paragraph, we use the simple p tag at the beginning and end of the paragraph text:\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.\n\nAvoiding Old-Tag Soup The semantic approach to HTML isn’t common on the Web. Since various HTML elements look different when they appear in a browser, web designers occasionally brew often-strange concoctions of HTML elements into what is commonly referred to as tag soup to achieve the desired look and feel. To gain control of this look and feel, designers might add presentational HTML tags to otherwise semantically marked-up content, like so:\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.\n\nThose additional HTML tags are there to control the look and feel of just one paragraph. When you use traditional HTML coding, every single element in a site’s HTML page would therefore need to be coded with additional elements to create the specific colors, fonts, alignment, and layout that a designer wants; such a process is extremely tedious and prone to errors. Imagine you were designing a website that consisted of 20 pages, and you wanted to add certain design elements such as colors, fonts, sizing, and alignment to the site. Now imagine maintaining a 1,000-page website. How about a 1,000,000-page website? A site’s HTML documents quickly become bogged down with additional code that makes both the content and the code all but unmanageable.\n\nHTML Is Document Structure So, it’s important to get the document structure right as much as possible with HTML. Through the use of semantic, lean coding, web developers save time in terms of maintenance while also allowing the framework on which stylesheets can be applied. If you feel knowledgeable enough about HTML and HTML5 already, the information in this chapter might already be in your domain. If that’s the case, you might want to skip through this chapter.\n\n2 | Chapter 1: Using HTML Basics\n\n1.1 Picking a Text Editor Problem You want to choose a text editor for marking up content with HTML.\n\nSolution Numerous software applications are geared toward coding HTML. Some are free and some require payment. Some basic text editors that come preinstalled with operating systems include: • Notepad (Windows OS) • TextEdit (Mac OS) • gedit (Linux OS) Here are some other free text editors that have more features: • Notepad++ (Windows OS; http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm) • TextWrangler (Mac OS; http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/) • jEdit (Windows OS, Mac OS, and Linux OS; http://www.jedit.org/) For more professional-level, commercial integrated development environments (IDEs), try one of the following: • Adobe Dreamweaver (Windows OS and Mac OS; http://www.adobe.com/products/ dreamweaver/) • Panic Software’s Coda (Mac OS; http://www.panic.com/coda/)\n\nDiscussion For editing HTML, some applications come bundled with common operating systems such as Mac OS X and Windows. They are TextEdit and Notepad, respectively. Do not use word processing programs for working with HTML. Although these programs are ideal for creating common documents that you need to print, they add extraneous formatting to your text that you don’t want or need.\n\nBefore using TextEdit, go to File→Preferences and check “Plain text” as the format option. Otherwise, the text editor might strip out the HTML elements. If you use Notepad, select Format→WordWrap. This option allows long lines to be wrapped within the application window, making it easier to edit.\n\n1.1 Picking a Text Editor | 3\n\nFor both TextEdit and Notepad, make sure to save the HTML file with an .html file extension. Do not append an additional .html extension onto the file. For example, example.txt.html or example.html.txt only leads to heartbreak.\n\nEven though these code editors—which are free and already installed in the operating system—do not offer many options, many web designers rely on them for working with HTML.\n\nMore robust, still free Another text editing option that is also free is TextWrangler from Bare Bones Software. TextWrangler is not as full-featured as the company’s flagship product, BBEdit, but it might suit your needs just the same. TextWrangler and BBEdit are Mac-only applications. For Windows, there are options such as Notepad++ and TextPad (see http://www.text pad.com/). If you use Unix, there are the vi/vim and Emacs editors. Another potential text editor is jEdit, which is also available for Mac and Windows.\n\nIDE solutions More full-featured products often cost more, but they provide a complete solution for dealing with almost every aspect of building websites. Popular products in this realm include Adobe Dreamweaver and Panic Software’s Coda.\n\nSee Also http://www.notepad.org/logo.htm, to get a “Made with Notepad” graphical banner to place on your web page\n\n1.2 Coding a Basic HTML Page Problem You want to create your first HTML page.\n\nSolution Start with basic content, such as the following: My Basic Web Page Epsum factorial non deposit quid pro quo hic escorol.\n\n4 | Chapter 1: Using HTML Basics\n\nNext, add an html element around the entire document: My Basic Web Page Epsum factorial non deposit quid pro quo hic escorol.\n\nThen place the head and body elements in the document, like so: My Basic Web Page Epsum factorial non deposit quid pro quo hic escorol.\n\nInsert a title element in the head element: CSS Cookbook My Basic Web Page Sed quis custodiet ipsos custodes?\n\nThe heading (h1) and paragraph (p) elements go inside the body element, and the page should render as shown in Figure 1-1: CSS Cookbook\n\nMy Basic Web Page\n\nSed quis custodiet ipsos custodes?\n\nDiscussion Every web page needs to have an HTML element wrapping the entire document. Within each HTML element are two required elements: head and body. The head element contains the information about the document, often called meta information. The head element needs to have the title element within it. This text is usually set in the top portion of the browser window and is used when creating bookmarks. It’s important to be concise and to avoid long descriptions when using the title tag.\n\n1.2 Coding a Basic HTML Page | 5\n\nFigure 1-1. The default rendering of a basic HTML web page\n\nIf the title element contains no text, browsers will use either the filename or the first few words of the document instead. Only text is allowed within the title element. Other HTML elements aren’t allowed.\n\nThe content of a web document is placed within the body element. If you need to edit or revise a web page, most of the time it is within this element. For this example, the heading was set with an h1 element along with the standard p element for the paragraph.\n\nSee Also Recipe 1.1 for choosing a text editor\n\n1.3 Understanding DOCTYPEs and Effects on Browser Layout Problem You want to make your web page standards compliant and valid.\n\nSolution HTML 4.01 has three document types: Strict, Transitional, and Frameset. Both HTML5 and XHTML 1.1 have one document type, but XHTML 1.0, like HTML 4.01, has three.\n\n6 | Chapter 1: Using HTML Basics\n\nOnly one document type definition (DTD) appears in the HTML document. Use any one of the following DOCTYPEs that best fits your project needs. HTML 4.01 Strict DTD:\n\nHTML 4.01 Transitional DTD:\n\nHTML 4.01 Frameset DTD:\n\nHTML5 DTD:\n\nXHTML 1.0 Strict DTD:\n\nXHTML 1.0 Transitional DTD:\n\nXHTML 1.0 Frameset DTD:\n\nXHTML 1.1 DTD:\n\nHere’s a basic page with the HTML5 DTD and the required head, body, and html elements: CSS Cookbook\n\nMy Basic Web Page\n\nEpsum factorial non deposit quid pro quo hic escorol.\n\n1.3 Understanding DOCTYPEs and Effects on Browser Layout | 7\n\nDiscussion A DOCTYPE, short for document type definition, defines an HTML or XHTML document’s building blocks and tells the browsers and validators which version of HTML or XHTML your document uses. The DOCTYPE declaration must appear at the beginning of every web page document, before the html element, to ensure that your markup and CSS are standards compliant and that browsers handle the pages based on the appropriate DTDs.\n\nQuirks mode XHTML requires a valid DOCTYPE at the top of the document; otherwise, the pages won’t validate and the browsers will fall back into what is known as quirks mode. Quirks mode occurs when a browser treats a web page as “buggy.” As a result, such pages are treated as though they were written in invalid markup, and therefore will be improperly rendered in modern browsers even if the XHTML and CSS are coded perfectly. A web page that is without a DOCTYPE, with an older DOCTYPE, or with a typoriddled DOCTYPE triggers quirks mode. So, when coding pages, make sure to check that the DOCTYPE is both added to the page and typed correctly to ensure that browsers do not render pages in quirks mode. If a web page has an HTML5 DOCTYPE, modern browsers will trigger standards mode, even though the actual markup isn’t coded with HTML5 elements. Internet Explorer for Windows 6 and 7 ignores HTML5 features.\n\nFigures 1-2 and 1-3 show how a table contained within a div with a width of 100% goes into quirks mode in Internet Explorer 6, and how the page should look in standards mode.\n\nWhy not use the latest DOCTYPE? Using newer DOCTYPEs such as HTML5 is an option. However, it’s not the only option. Unlike software application releases, newer DOCTYPEs don’t make older DOCTYPEs moot. For example, you would be hard-pressed to install, much less run, Photoshop 4 on today’s computers. However, you can still use HTML4 syntax and DOCTYPEs without fear of browsers not rendering your content.\n\n8 | Chapter 1: Using HTML Basics\n\nFigure 1-2. Table width in Internet Explorer 6 in quirks mode with no DOCTYPE included\n\nFigure 1-3. Table width in Firefox 1.5 in standards mode with HTML 4.01 Strict DOCTYPE\n\n1.3 Understanding DOCTYPEs and Effects on Browser Layout | 9\n\nThe smallest web page ever The Solution provides an example of a relatively short HTML5 page. However, an even shorter and valid example can be made: Small HTML5\n\nHello world\n\nThese three HTML elements validate for HTML5 by checking out the page at http:// validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fjsbin.com%2Fowata&ss=1.\n\nSee Also HTML5 specification for DTD at http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-doc type; HTML 4.01 specification for DTD at http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/intro/ sgmltut.html#h-3.3; W3C validators at http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/#validators; DOCTYPEs article from A List Apart at http://www.alistapart.com/articles/doctype/; Article from QuirksMode at http://www.quirksmode.org/index.html?/css/quirksmode .html; Mozilla’s information on quirks mode, which explains the differences between the rendering modes and how it handles quirks mode, at https://developer.mozilla.org/ en/Mozilla's_Quirks_Mode; Opera’s DOCTYPE page at http://www.opera.com/docs/ specs/doctype/\n\n1.4 Marking Up Headers Problem You want to differentiate the importance of headings within the same document.\n\nSolution Use one of the six available headings, h1 through h6, as shown in Figure 1-4: CSS Cookbook\n\nMy Basic Web Page\n\nEpsum factorial non deposit quid pro quo hic escorol.\n\nSecondary Heading\n\nFeles mala! cur cista non uteris? stramentum novum in ea posui.\n\nTertiary Heading\n\nPor scientie, musica, sport etc., li tot Europa usa li sam vocabularium.\n\n10 | Chapter 1: Using HTML Basics\n\nQuaternary Heading\n\nLex clavatoris designati rescindenda est.\n\nQuinary Heading\n\nIre fortiter quo nemo ante iit.\n\nSenary Heading\n\nInterdum feror cupidine partium magnarum europe vincendarum.\n\nFigure 1-4. The default rendering of six heading levels\n\n1.4 Marking Up Headers | 11\n\nDiscussion You can choose from among six different levels of headings when marking up titles for a document. When marking up content, be sure to use the headings in order. For example, if you use the h2 element, the header underneath it should be wrapped in the h3 element (not h4 or h5). The title of the page should not be wrapped in the h2 element (use the h1 element). In short, don’t skip header tags! It’s not important to use all of the headers when creating a document. However, be sure not to overuse the h1 element, as that might lower your search engine ranking. Use the h1 element once for the unique title of your blog post or page; then use h2 and h3 for the other portions of the document. If you need to use h4, h5, and h6 elements in your document, break up the content into separate pages or investigate the document structure. A document requiring six different heading levels might be so loaded down with content that it will fail to hold an average person’s attention span.\n\nAlso, if you are concerned about the look of the headings, do not worry. Through the power of CSS, the design of the headings (along with the rest of the page) can be modified. Using headers appropriately in a document benefits people using screen readers. For a demonstration, see the video at http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=AmUPhEVWu_E.\n\nSee Also Chapter 3 for modifying headers and other common type treatments\n\n1.5 Making Appropriate Quotations Problem You want to cite quotations with HTML, as shown in Figure 1-5.\n\nSolution Use the blockquote element when quoting a large amount of text:\n\nSi fallatis officium, quaestor infitias eat se quicquam scire de factis\n\n12 | Chapter 1: Using HTML Basics\n\nvestris.\n\nFigure 1-5. The default rendering of quotations\n\nFor citing phrases, use the q element:\n\nVirgil said Sic itur ad astra.\n\nDiscussion The blockquote element is a block-level element. This means that text tagged with a blockquote element separates itself from the rest of the text by forcing a line break above and below itself. The q element is an inline element, which does not force a line break. Inline elements are useful for quoting small portions of text within a paragraph element. The q element is typically rendered with quotation marks around the text it envelops. However, these quotation marks do not appear in Internet Explorer for Windows.\n\nThe cite attribute is optional for both the blockquote and q elements. The value of a cite attribute is a URI where the source of the quote originated.\n\nSee Also Chapter 3 for other common type treatments\n\n1.5 Making Appropriate Quotations | 13\n\n1.6 Adding an Image Problem You want to add an image to a web page, as shown in Figure 1-6.\n\nFigure 1-6. An image placed within a document\n\n14 | Chapter 1: Using HTML Basics\n\nSolution Use the img element to specify the location of the image file:\n\nAdd an alt attribute within the img element to provide alternative text in case images are turned off or people are surfing with an assistive technology such as a screen reader:\n\nDiscussion The img element does not address content within the web document itself. It merely defines the location of its placement within the document and specifies its location relative to the HTML document.\n\nAdditional tips Even though a picture is worth a thousand words, the value of the alt attribute should be a relatively short description. As shown in Figure 1-6, some browsers display text next to a cursor, called a tool tip, within the title attribute of an image:\n\nFile formats Common image formats supported by browsers include GIF and JPEG. Both formats have their own pros and cons in terms of which types of images are best for each. Based on the compression scheme, which is the method with which an image’s file size is reduced, GIFs are better at areas of flat color and fewer gradients, and JPEGs are good for photos and subtle color changes. All browsers support the PNG file format; however, alpha transparency is only now supported in Internet Explorer 8 for Windows. Alpha transparency allows for opacity or levels of transparency within an image, unlike the GIF format, which can assign only one color to be transparent. If an older version of IE renders a PNG image with alpha transparency, the transparent portions usually turn into blocks of solid white.\n\nCharacter case sensitivity When specifying an image file within HTML, make sure the filename does not contain spaces and the lower- and uppercase characters match. Although your computer OS might be OK with a difference in cases, chances are the web server hosting your web files will not, and may keep images from appearing in the browser.\n\n1.6 Adding an Image | 15\n\nSee Also Chapter 4 for designing web pages with images\n\n1.7 Adding Audio with HTML5 Problem You want to add audio to a web page with HTML5.\n\nSolution Use the audio element to specify an audio file, as shown in Figure 1-7: <meta charset=\"utf-8\"> CSS Cookbook\n\nAudio Example\n\nDownload audio\n\nFigure 1-7. Audio added to a web page\n\nDiscussion The audio element has five attributes associated with it: src, autobuffer, autoplay, loop, and controls. If you don’t have the controls attribute, the audio player disappears. 16 | Chapter 1: Using HTML Basics\n\nAudio compatibility At the time of this writing, no one audio file type plays across all the browsers that support the HTML5 audio element, as shown in Table 1-1. Table 1-1. Audio file format support in HTML5 Firefox 3.5 Ogg Vorbis\n\nY\n\nMP3 WAV\n\nSafari 4\n\nOpera 10\n\nY Y\n\nY\n\nChrome 3 beta Y\n\nY\n\nY\n\nTo create a cross-browser solution, use the audio element along with the source element that cites both OGG and MP3 files. Then include Flash Player embed and object code afterward: <source src=\"html5audio.ogg\" /> <source src=\"html5audio.mp3\" />\n\nIf you do insert audio, setting the file to autoplay is not recommended, as it interferes with the experience for web surfers using screen readers.\n\nSee Also Recipe 1.8 for adding video to web pages\n\n1.8 Incorporating Video with HTML5 Problem You want to add video to HTML5.\n\nSolution Use the HTML5 video element, as shown in Figure 1-8: <meta charset=\"utf-8\"> CSS Cookbook\n\nVideo Example\n\n1.8 Incorporating Video with HTML5 | 17\n\nDownload movie\n\nFigure 1-8. Video added to a web page\n\nDiscussion You do not have to specify the width and height of the video element. If you do not set the video element with its respective attributes, the movie will play to the default values of the video file itself. A video file might have its own poster, which is a static image that represents the video as a whole, similar to a thumbnail. However, you can override this poster by using the poster attribute. The poster image can be any file type the browser supports (e.g., GIF, JPEG, or PNG). 18 | Chapter 1: Using HTML Basics\n\nAlthough the controls attribute is optional, for the sake of usability I suggest using it so as not to offend your site’s visitors.\n\nYou can place alternative text in between the video tags, including a link to download the video file, for browsers that do not recognize the video element. This method allows website visitors a method to view the content with third-party solutions other than browsers. At the time of this writing, Safari 3.1 and later, Firefox 3.5 and later, Opera 10 beta, and Chrome 3 beta support the video element.\n\nSee Also http://www.videolan.org/ for information on the export tools in the VLC software application, which you can use to convert common video files to OGG format (supported by Firefox and Opera)\n\n1.9 Using strong and em Effectively Problem You want to emphasize certain words or phrases in a paragraph, as shown in Figure 1-9.\n\nFigure 1-9. The default rendering of highlighted text\n\nSolution Use the strong and em elements to denote emphasis within a document:\n\nMa quande lingues coalesce, li grammatica del <strong>resultant lingue es plu simplic e regulari quam ti del coalescent lingues. Li nov lingua franca va esser plu simplic e regulari quam li existent Europan lingues. It va esser tam simplic quam Occidental: in fact, it va esser Occidental. A <em>un Angleso it va semblar un simplificat Angles, quam un skeptic Cambridge amico dit me que Occidental es.\n\n1.9 Using strong and em Effectively | 19\n\nDiscussion The strong element’s default rendering is to make text bold, while the em element sets text in italics. You would use em to draw attention to or contrast one or more words from the rest of a sentence. For example: • Darth Vader translates loosely as Dark Father in Dutch. • There are, not 57, but 50 states in the United States of America. • If you join him, he will complete your training. Strong is an alternative element to em to bring attention to words or phrases.\n\nAlthough the use of em and strong helps to break up the monotony of text, be sure to use these elements sparingly as well as consistently so that you do not overuse or abuse their importance.\n\nSee Also Chapter 3 for other common type treatments\n\n1.10 Creating Lists Problem You want to create a list of items within a web page, as shown in Figure 1-10.\n\nFigure 1-10. The default rendering of an unordered list\n\n20 | Chapter 1: Using HTML Basics\n\nSolution Use the ul element to wrap around a list of phrases:\n\nFirst Item Secondary Item Tertiary Item Quaternary Item\n\nThen use the li element to wrap around each item within the list:\n\nFirst Item\n\nSecondary Item\n\nTertiary Item\n\nQuaternary Item\n\nDiscussion There are three types of lists in HTML: unordered, ordered, and definition lists. Marking up unordered lists and ordered lists is fairly straightforward. Use two elements, ul and li, to mark up a series of items for an unordered list, which typically results in a circle appended to the left side of each list item. An unordered list is typically used to create the base of a navigation menu.\n\nOrdered lists, which use an ol element instead of a ul element, have a numeral in sequential order prepended to the list. As shown in Figure 1-11, definition lists, which are used to define terms, work a little bit differently from unordered and ordered lists. Each item is broken down into two parts: the term (dt) and the definition (dd).\n\nFirst Term\n\nSeriatim\n\nSecondary Term\n\nSequentia\n\nTertiary Term\n\nSequens mirabitur aetas\n\n1.10 Creating Lists | 21\n\nFigure 1-11. The default rendering of a definition list\n\nSee Also Chapter 6 on lists and Chapter 7 on links and navigation\n\n1.11 Making a Link to a Web Page Problem You want to link to another web page.\n\nSolution Using the anchor link:\n\nThis book's Web site contains links to download more materials.\n\nto link to another page in the same website, link to its file:\n\nCheck out the About page for more information.\n\nDiscussion Along with the img element (see Recipe 1.6), some browsers display a tool tip if a title attribute and value are present within the anchor link, as shown in Figure 1-12:\n\nThis book's Web site contains links to download more material.\n\n22 | Chapter 1: Using HTML Basics\n\nFigure 1-12. A tool tip displayed over a link\n\nLinking to another web page on the same site When you are creating links within the same site, use relative links instead of anchor links. Relative links are addresses that are valid only if you are visiting from certain web pages. For example, suppose you have a website composed of four pages within the same root folder, the main directory that contains the website files, as shown in Figure 1-13: • httpdocs/ — index.html — aboutus.html — contactus.html — services.html\n\nFigure 1-13. Sample directory structure\n\nIncluding everything that is needed to point a web browser to a location in a link means that you created an absolute link, which looks like this: Services Page\n\n1.11 Making a Link to a Web Page | 23\n\nIf you want to create a link from the index page to another page on the same website, use a relative link. A relative link is a little bit leaner than an absolute link and, as in this example, can cite just the filename itself within the href attribute: Services Page\n\nRelative links contain neither the full http:// protocol nor the domain name. When a browser navigates to a relative link, it uses the domain name of the page it is currently viewing to assemble the link to where it should go next.\n\nMoving up folders Just as your personal computer probably contains numerous folders holding numerous files for a project, websites are also composed of folder sets and files. To link from one document to another document within the same website, use relative links. For example, say you have a main technical specs page within a specs folder, which itself is in a widget folder. The organization of the files on the server might look something like this: • products/ — widget/ — specs/ — specs.html To provide a link to the main widget page from the technical specs page, use ../ to tell the browser to go up to the parent directory: Widget Page\n\nIf you want to go up two parent directories and link to the main products page from the technical specs page, you would format the link like so: Product Page\n\nUsing the root relative link The process for using relative links to move between the folders of a large website can sometimes be tricky, if not convoluted. Another type of link to use in such a case is a root relative link. Here is how you would use a root relative link to code the link from the technical specs page to the main product page in the preceding example: Product Page\n\nThe forward slash signifies the protocol and domain name of the URI, a sort of shorthand for links.\n\n24 | Chapter 1: Using HTML Basics\n\nLinking to certain elements within a web page You can also link to certain elements within an HTML document by creating anchors. You can create an anchor by assigning an id attribute to an HTML element:\n\nHire Me\n\nThen, link to that anchor by prefacing the id name with a hash symbol (#): Hire Me\n\nWhen clicked, the browser navigates to the part of the document that has the corresponding id name. If a document is not longer than the browser’s viewport or window, there won’t be any noticeable change that the browser has skipped to an anchored link.\n\nDesigners use anchors to create a table of contents at the top of a web page that lets you quickly navigate to other parts of the document. This approach is particularly useful on web pages with a large amount of content to help users avoid excessive scrolling.\n\nSee Also Chapter 7 on links and navigation\n\n1.12 Coding Tables Problem You want to create a simple HTML table, as shown in Figure 1-14.\n\nFigure 1-14. The default rendering of a basic HTML table\n\n1.12 Coding Tables | 25\n\nSolution Use specific elements related to marking up tabular data:\n\nKnow Your IE6 Adoption Rate 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 % 45 62 82 81 78 50 45 36\n\nDiscussion First, add a table tag at the beginning and end of the tabular data. The table tag defines the table as a whole. The optional caption element is for the summary of the tabular data and appears immediately after the opening table element. Then, if your table has a header, add the thead tag to one or more rows as the table header. Use the tbody tag to wrap the table body so that it is distinct from the table header. Next, add tr table row tags to mark off each table row. This element wraps groups of individual table cells. First you define a row, and then you add the enclosed cells. No tag exists for a table column. Only through building successive table rows do columns emerge.\n\n26 | Chapter 1: Using HTML Basics\n\nAfter that, use the th tag for each cell you want to designate as a table header cell, which includes years and percentages in the Solution. You should enclose the specific cell content in the tag. By default, browsers make the text in header cells boldface. Use the td tag to mark out individual cells in a table. Like the th tag, the td tag wraps specific cell content. For a simple, web-based HTML table generator to bypass handcrafting numerous table cells, try http://www.askthecssguy.com/kotatsu/index .html.\n\nSee Also Chapter 9 on tables\n\n1.13 Creating an HTML vCard (hCard) Problem You want to include in a web page contact information such as that found on a business card, as shown in Figure 1-15.\n\nFigure 1-15. The default rendering of an hCard\n\nSolution Use class attributes with specific attributes listed in the hCard microformat specification (see http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard):\n\nDiscussion The hCard microformat gives you a way to represent contact information, including people, organizations, and places, using XHTML class attributes. It is one of many standards detailed in the Microformats Project (see http://microformats.org/), the aim of which is to provide standards for coding machine-readable information into web pages using semantic HTML. Similar to a design pattern, an hCard standardizes the way in which information is represented, which allows third-party software to glean the information and put it to all kinds of good uses. To save time and avoid typos, use the hCard Creator (see http://microformats.org/code/ hcard/creator) to generate the HTML syntax.\n\nExtending hCards The H2VX web service (see http://http://h2vx.com/vcf/), which is available to use on the site and as a favelet, crawls the markup within a web page looking for hCard data from a web address. If it finds an hCard or hCards, it prompts the site visitor to download the data as a vCard. The site visitor can then import the vCard into his favorite address book application, such as Outlook (Windows) or Address Book (Mac OS X). Operator (see https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4106) is a Firefox add-on that detects microformatted text on a web page and then provides you with options to do various things with the data, depending on the type of microformat used. A similar plug-in is available for Safari at http://zappatic.net/safarimicroformats/.\n\nSee Also The hCard validator at http://en.hcard.geekhood.net/; Recipe 1.14 for using HTML to mark up an event\n\n1.14 Marking Up an Event (hCalendar) Problem You want to use HTML to mark up an event.\n\n28 | Chapter 1: Using HTML Basics\n\nSolution Use class and title attributes with specific attributes listed in the hCard microformat specification (see http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar):\n\nDiscussion Based on the iCalendar file format used to exchange event data, the hCard microformat uses standardized HTML to encode event time and place information into a web document. Each separate event is designated with the vevent class. This specifies the content as an hCalendar entry. The beginning time of the event, dtstart and summary, is required for every hCalendar event, whereas the end-time dtend and location properties are optional. An hCalendar cheat sheet, available at http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar-cheat sheet, provides a list of optional properties.\n\nSee Also The hCalendar Creator (http://microformats.org/code/hcalendar/creator) and the Conference Schedule Creator (http://dmitry.baranovskiy.com/work/csc/) to easily create your own hCalendar; Recipe 1.13 for including contact information in a web page\n\n1.15 Validating HTML Problem You want to make sure the HTML on your web page is properly coded.\n\nSolution Use the W3C validator (see http://validator.w3.org/) to input the URI of a web document to test its HTML validity, as shown in Figure 1-16. Alternatively, you can enter code for testing by uploading a CSS file or by entering the CSS rules.\n\n1.15 Validating HTML | 29\n\nFigure 1-16. Validating a web page\n\nDiscussion The W3C hosts a robust HTML checker on its website. However, sometimes the output can be hard to understand. When validating, make sure to select More Options→Verbose Output. This feedback option provides more background information regarding errors within your code, giving you a better chance at troubleshooting problems.\n\nCreating an HTML validator bookmarklet Take any page you visit on the Web directly to the W3C’s HTML validator through a bookmarklet. A bookmarklet is a tiny piece of JavaScript tucked away in the Address portion of a bookmark.\n\n30 | Chapter 1: Using HTML Basics\n\nCreate a new bookmark, name it “HTML Validator,” and then replace whatever is in the address field with this line: javascript:void(document.location='http://validator.w3.org/check? charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&ss=1&group=0& verbose=1&uri='+escape(document.location))\n\nWhen visiting another site, clicking on the bookmarklet takes the page currently loaded in the browser and runs it through the CSS validator.\n\nSee Also Recipe 2.27 for validating CSS rules\n\n1.15 Validating HTML | 31\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nCSS Basics\n\n2.0 Introduction Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) provide a simple way to style the content on your web pages. CSS may look complicated to first-time users, but this chapter shows how easy it is to use CSS. Here’s an exercise with the traditional “Hello, world!” example. First, open a text editor or a favorite web page editor tool and enter the following: CSS Cookbook\n\nHello, world!\n\nSave the file and view it in your web browser. There is nothing special about this line, as shown in Figure 2-1.\n\nFigure 2-1. The default rendering of HTML text without CSS\n\n33\n\nTo change the style of the HTML text to sans serif, add the following CSS, as shown in Figure 2-2:\n\nHello, world!\n\nFigure 2-2. The font, changed to sans serif through CSS\n\nTo keep the default font but change the font size to 150%, use the following code, as shown in Figure 2-3:\n\nHello, world!\n\nFigure 2-3. Increasing the size of the text\n\nIn this chapter, you’ll learn about selectors and properties, organizing stylesheets, and positioning. These general recipes will prepare you for fancier recipes in upcoming chapters. 34 | Chapter 2: CSS Basics\n\n2.1 Applying CSS Rules to a Web Page Problem You want to use CSS rules to dictate the design of your web page.\n\nSolution Start with a blank page in Notepad, your favorite text processor, or HTML development software such as Adobe Dreamweaver or Microsoft Expression. If you use a basic text editor, make sure the preferences are set to save as Plain Text (and not Rich Text).\n\nThen add the following HTML between the body tags, and save the file as cookbook.html: CSS Cookbook\n\nTitle of Page\n\nThis is a sample paragraph with a link.\n\nNow add the following code changes (shown in boldface) to redefine the style for links, bulleted lists, and headers, as shown in Figure 2-4: CSS Cookbook <style type=\"text/css\">\n\n2.1 Applying CSS Rules to a Web Page | 35\n\nTitle of Page\n\nThis is a sample paragraph with a link.\n\nFigure 2-4. Content rendered differently after adding CSS\n\nDiscussion CSS contains rules with two parts: selectors and properties. A selector identifies what portion of your web page gets styled. Within a selector are one or more properties and their values. The property tells the browser what to change, and the value lets the browser know what that change should be. For instance, in the following declaration block example, the selector tells the browser to style the content marked up with h1 elements in the web page to 120% of the default size: h1 { font-size: 120%; }\n\nTable 2-1 shows a breakdown of the selectors, properties, and values in the Solution. The “Result” column explains what happens when you apply the property and value to the selector. Table 2-1. Breakdown of selectors, properties, and values in the Solution Selector\n\nProperty\n\nh1\n\nfont-size\n\n120%\n\nText size larger than default size\n\np\n\nfont-size\n\n90%\n\nText size smaller than default size\n\n36 | Chapter 2: CSS Basics\n\nValue\n\nResult\n\nThe standard for writing CSS syntax includes the selector, which is normally the tag you want to style, followed by properties and values enclosed within curly braces: selector { property: value; }\n\nHowever, most designers use the following format to improve readability: selector { property: value; }\n\nThe addition of whitespace and line breaks helps make the CSS more readable. Both are valid approaches to writing CSS. Use whatever method is more comfortable for you. Also, CSS allows selectors to take on more than one property at a time, to create more complex visual presentations. To assign multiple properties within a selector, use a semicolon to separate the properties, as shown in the following code. Note the use of the semicolon following the last property in the list, though there are no other properties following it. This ensures that we can quickly add new items, without the potential of adding errors by forgetting the separator: selector { property: value; property: value, value, value; property: value value value value; } selector, selector { property: value; }\n\nWrapping the CSS rules For internal stylesheets (see Recipe 2.11), the CSS rules are wrapped within the HTML style element: <style type=\"text/css\">\n\nThe style element informs the browser that the content inside the element comprises formatted CSS rules and that the browser should be prepared to process the content. The HTML comment is there to shield older browsers that do not know how to render CSS rules appropriately. For most modern browsers, the HTML comment is no longer needed.\n\nSee Also Recipe 2.2 for more information about CSS selectors; Appendixes C and D for lists of selectors\n\n2.1 Applying CSS Rules to a Web Page | 37\n\n2.2 Using Basic Selectors to Apply Styles Problem You want to use basic selectors to associate styles to a web page.\n\nSolution Use different kinds of selectors to target different portions of web pages to style, as shown in Figure 2-5: CSS Cookbook <style type=\"text/css\">\n\nTitle of Page\n\nThis is a sample paragraph with a link. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna <em class=\"warning\">aliquam erat volutpat. Ut wisi enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exerci tation ullamcorper suscipit lobortis nisl ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.\n\nApples\n\nBananas\n\nCherries\n\n38 | Chapter 2: CSS Basics\n\nFigure 2-5. Web page with CSS styles\n\nDiscussion CSS allows for many, and sometimes ingenious, ways to pinpoint which parts of a web page should be styled. To better understand how to pick out portions of a web page using selectors, a developer needs to recognize that content marked up with HTML creates a structure. Although the elements used in the HTML in the Solution might look like a jumbled order, as shown in Figure 2-6, they do follow a certain structure. This structure might be invisible to the visitor visiting the web page, but it’s a crucial part of the rendering process a browser goes through. When a browser pulls a web page from the server and begins to display the page, the elements of the page are placed in a structure that the browser software assembles. Although this process of placing the elements in an organizational structure is more programming oriented, a good visual representation would be to view the structure much like an organizational chart at a company. Based on the HTML used in the Solution, the organizational chart would look like Figure 2-7.\n\n2.2 Using Basic Selectors to Apply Styles | 39\n\nFigure 2-6. Elements used in the Solution\n\nFigure 2-7. Elements used in the web page arranged in a structure\n\nType selectors Type selectors are selectors that name the element or HTML tag to style. The following rules apply font styles to the h1 and p elements within a web page, as shown in Figure 2-8:\n\n40 | Chapter 2: CSS Basics\n\nh1 { font-size: 120%; } p { color: blue; }\n\nFigure 2-8. The elements selected from the CSS rules\n\nClass selectors When you want to apply the same CSS rule on different elements, you can use a class selector. For example, you can use class selectors to identify warnings with boldface text in a paragraph as well as a list item. First, create a warning class selector preceded by a period (.), which is also known as a full stop: CSS Cookbook <style type=\"text/css\">\n\n2.2 Using Basic Selectors to Apply Styles | 41\n\n} #navigation { border: 1px solid black; padding: 40px; } li a { text-decoration: none; } p { font-size: 90%; } .warning { font-weight: bold; } -->\n\nTitle of Page\n\nThis is a sample paragraph with a link. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna <em class=\"warning\">aliquam erat volutpat. Ut wisi enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exerci tation ullamcorper suscipit lobortis nisl ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.\n\nApples\n\nBananas\n\nCherries\n\nThen add the class attribute to a link and a list item to style those elements, as shown in Figure 2-9: CSS Cookbook <style type=\"text/css\">\n\n42 | Chapter 2: CSS Basics\n\n} .warning { font-weight: bold; } -->\n\nTitle of Page\n\nThis is a sample paragraph with a link. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna <em class=\"warning\">aliquam erat volutpat. Ut wisi enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exerci tation ullamcorper suscipit lobortis nisl ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.\n\nApples\n\nBananas\n\nCherries\n\nFigure 2-9. The CSS class selectors modifying the look of the web page\n\n2.2 Using Basic Selectors to Apply Styles | 43\n\nFigure 2-10 shows which portions of the document are selected with this class selector.\n\nFigure 2-10. The styled elements within the page structure\n\nID selectors ID selectors resemble class selectors except they appear once in the HTML document. An ID selector can appear multiple times in a CSS document, but the element an ID selector refers to appears only once in an HTML document. Often, ID selectors appear in a div to mark major divisions within a document, but you can use them elsewhere. To create an ID selector, use the hash symbol (#), followed immediately by a label or name: #navigation { border: 1px solid black; padding: 40px; }\n\nThen add an id attribute with a value of navigation, as shown in Figure 2-11:\n\nApples\n\nBananas\n\nCherries\n\n44 | Chapter 2: CSS Basics\n\nFigure 2-11. An unordered list element, styled\n\nDescendant selectors Descendant selectors allow for more granular control in picking parts of a web page than type and class selectors. Descendant selectors typically have two elements, with the second element being a descendant of the first: li a { text-decoration: none; }\n\nThe following code adds the HTML in which a appears within li, as shown in Figure 2-12:\n\nApples\n\nBananas\n\nCherries\n\nIn this example, every time there is a link or a element within a list item or li element, this CSS rule is applied.\n\nUniversal selectors The universal selector is represented with an asterisk (*) and is applied to all elements, as shown in Figure 2-13. In the following code, every element containing HTML text would be styled with Verdana, Arial, or some other sans serif font:\n\n2.2 Using Basic Selectors to Apply Styles | 45\n\n* { font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; }\n\nFigure 2-12. The links within the list items selected\n\nFigure 2-13. Every element styled with the universal selector\n\n46 | Chapter 2: CSS Basics\n\nSee Also The CSS 2.1 specification for selectors at http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html; Selectutorial, a tutorial of CSS selectors, at http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/; the browser selector support guide from Westciv at http://westciv.com/style_master/ academy/browser_support/selectors.html; Chapter 3 for more on web typography; Appendix C for a list of selectors\n\n2.3 Applying Child Selectors Problem You want to style descendant selectors, but only child elements that are one level from their parent element.\n\nSolution Use a child selector, which you signify by a right-angled bracket often set between two type selectors, as shown in the following code: strong { text-decoration: underline; } div > strong { text-decoration: none; }\n\nDiscussion With a child selector, an element is styled if it is the direct descendant of its parent element. Only the strong element that isn’t contained within another element, the div element in this case, is not underlined, as shown in Figure 2-14: Nothing happens to this part of the sentence because this <strong>strong isn't the direct child of div.\n\nHowever, this <strong>strong is the child of div. Therefore, it receives the style dictated in the CSS rule.\n\nTo see which elements are affected by this CSS rule in an organizational chart, take a look at Figure 2-15. As shown in Figures 2-14 and 2-15, the first strong element was not underlined because it was placed within the div element.\n\n2.3 Applying Child Selectors | 47\n\nFigure 2-14. The effect of the child selector rule\n\nFigure 2-15. The child selector highlighted in the markup structure\n\nIf the direct parent-to-child relationship is not present, the style won’t hold. This is an easy but powerful difference between a child selector and a descendant selector. Child selectors are not supported in Internet Explorer 6 and earlier.\n\n48 | Chapter 2: CSS Basics\n\nSee Also The CSS 2.1 specification for child selectors at http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector .html#child-selectors\n\n2.4 Applying Adjacent Selectors Problem You want to assign styles to an element when it’s next to another, specific element.\n\nSolution Use an adjacent sibling, which is formed by a plus sign between two selectors, as shown in the following code: li + li { font-size: 200%; }\n\nDiscussion Adjacent siblings describe the relationship between two elements that are placed side by side within the flow of a web page’s markup. Figure 2-16 shows the effect of this adjacent sibling rule. Notice that only the second and third list items are styled, since the second and third list items are placed side by side. The first item is not styled because it does not meet the requirements of having a list item come before it. To see which elements are affected by this CSS rule showcasing adjacent sibling selectors in an organizational chart, take a look at Figure 2-17. Adjacent selectors are not supported in Internet Explorer 6 and earlier.\n\nSee Also The CSS 2.1 specification for adjacent selectors at http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector .html#adjacent-selectors\n\n2.4 Applying Adjacent Selectors | 49\n\nFigure 2-16. Adjacent sibling selectors, which affect the ordered list because it appears after the unordered list\n\nFigure 2-17. Showing which elements are being styled\n\n50 | Chapter 2: CSS Basics\n\n2.5 Applying Attribute Selectors Problem You want to use style elements based on preexisting attributes of HTML elements, rather than adding an additional class attribute.\n\nSolution CSS2 attribute selectors have the following four main options for finding an element: [attribute]\n\nSearches for matches based on the attribute. For example: a[href] { text-decoration: none; }\n\nAs a result of the preceding code, whenever the href attribute appears within an a element in the HTML, the link won’t have an underline. [attribute=val]\n\nSearches for matches based on the value. For example: a[href=\"csscookbook.com\"] { text-decoration: none; }\n\nAs a result of the preceding code, whenever a link that points to csscookbook.com appears in the HTML, the link won’t have an underline. [attribute~=val]\n\nSearches for matches that contain the space-separated attribute somewhere in the value. For example: a[title~=\"tv hd digital\"] { text-decoration: none; }\n\nAs a result of the preceding code, whenever the word digital appears in the title attribute of an anchor element, the link won’t have an underline. [attribute|=val]\n\nSearches for matches that contain the attribute with a hyphen. For example: a[title|=\"anti\"] { color: red; }\n\nAs a result of the preceding code, whenever the word anti appears in the title attribute of an anchor element, the link is colored red.\n\n2.5 Applying Attribute Selectors | 51\n\nDiscussion Although CSS2 selectors enjoy support in major browsers (except for Internet Explorer 6 and earlier), the following new additions to attribute selectors in the CSS3 specification, called substring matching attribute selectors, are just beginning to be adopted: [attribute^=val]\n\nSearches for matches where the attribute’s value begins with val. For example: a[href^=\"mailto:\"] { padding-right: 15px; background: url(icon-email.png) no-repeat right; }\n\nAs a result of the preceding code, whenever a link contains mailto:, an email icon is assigned at the end of that link. [attribute$=val]\n\nSearches for matches where the attribute’s value ends with val. For example: a[href$='.rss'], a[href$='.atom'] { padding-right: 15px; background: url(icon-rss.png) no-repeat right; }\n\nAs a result of the preceding code, whenever a link contains a reference to a syndication feed, an RSS icon is inserted at the end of the link. [attribute*=val]\n\nSearches for matches where the attribute value is anywhere within val. For example: a[href *=\"username\"] { padding-right: 15px; background: url(icons-star.png) no-repeat right; }\n\nAs a result of the preceding code, whenever a specific username appears in a link on a social media site, a star icon is added to the right of the link.\n\nSee Also The CSS2 specification for attribute selectors at http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector .html#attribute-selectors; the CSS3 specification for attribute selectors at http://www .w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#attribute-selectors; the Opera Developer Community article on CSS3 selectors at http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/css-3-attribute-selectors/\n\n52 | Chapter 2: CSS Basics\n\n2.6 Using Pseudo-Classes Problem You want to add styles to items that are not (typically) based on elements’ names, attributes, or content.\n\nSolution Create a pseudo-class. Here is an example of a pseudo-class that creates a common rollover effect on HTML links: a:link { color: blue; a:visited { color: purple; } a:hover { color: red; } a:active { color: gray; }\n\nDiscussion In this use of a pseudo-class, a basic link appears in blue. As soon as the mouse pointer hovers over the link, the link changes to red. While the link is being clicked, the link appears gray. When returning to the page with the link after visiting, the link appears purple. Three other CSS2 pseudo-classes include :first-child (which selects the first child element), :focus (see Recipe 7.4), and :lang(n).\n\nCSS3 pseudo-classes The CSS3 specification introduces a new slate of pseudo-classes. Although Internet Explorer does not support these new selectors, browser support is growing for them, as shown in Table 2-2. Table 2-2. Browser support for CSS3 pseudo-classes Selector\n\nFirefox 2\n\nFirefox 3.5\n\nOpera 9\n\nOpera 10\n\nSafari 3.1\n\nSafari 4\n\nChrome\n\n:target\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\n:enabled\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\n:disabled\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\n:checked\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\n:default\n\n2.6 Using Pseudo-Classes | 53\n\nSelector\n\nFirefox 2\n\nFirefox 3.5\n\nOpera 9\n\nOpera 10\n\nSafari 3.1\n\nSafari 4\n\nChrome\n\n:valid\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\n:invalid\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\n:in-range\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\n:out-of-range\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\n:nth-child()\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\n:nth-last-child()\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\n:nth-of-type()\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\n:required :root\n\nY\n\nY\n\n:not()\n\nY\n\nY\n\n:nth-last-of-type() :last-child\n\nY\n\n:first-of-type :last-of-type :only-child\n\nY\n\n:only-of-type :empty\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nSee Also The CSS2 specification for pseudo-classes at http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html #pseudo-class-selectors; the CSS3 specification for pseudo-classes at http://www.w3 .org/TR/css3-selectors/#pseudo-classes\n\n2.7 Using Pseudo-Elements Problem You want to style certain aspects of an element without introducing new markup such as a span element.\n\nSolution Use a pseudo-element. You can see an example of the ::first-letter pseudo-element in Figure 2-18: p::first-letter { font-size: 200%; font-weight: bold; }\n\n54 | Chapter 2: CSS Basics\n\nFigure 2-18. The first letter, styled A double-colon identifier was added in CSS3, but to add support for Internet Explorer 8, you need to recopy the CSS rules with the original single colon for cross-browser support.\n\nOr you can use ::first-line (as shown in Figure 2-19) to style the entire first line. If the first line isn’t a complete sentence or includes the start of a second sentence, ::first-line still impacts only the first line: p::first-line { font-size: 200%; font-weight: bold; }\n\nDiscussion With most selectors, a developer makes use of elements and their arrangement within a web document to style a document. However, sometimes developers can style an item that’s not marked up by elements through the use of pseudo-elements. CSS2 pseudo-elements consist of ::first-letter, ::first-line, ::before, and ::after.\n\n2.7 Using Pseudo-Elements | 55\n\nFigure 2-19. The first line, styled\n\nSee Also The CSS 2.1 specification for pseudo-elements at http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector .html#pseudo-element-selectors; the CSS3 specification for pseudo-elements at http:// www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#pseudo-elements\n\n2.8 Determining When to Use Class and ID Selectors Problem You want to determine the best use for class and ID selectors.\n\nSolution Use class selectors when you need to apply a style multiple times within a document, and ID selectors for one-time-only appearances within a document. In the following stylesheet, #banner and #content are ID selectors and .title and .content are class selectors:\n\n56 | Chapter 2: CSS Basics\n\nbody { margin: 0; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: .75em; padding: 0; } #banner { margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; background-color: #900; border-bottom: solid 1px #000; padding: 5px 5px 5px 10px; line-height: 75%; color: #fff; } #sub_banner { background-color: #ccc; border-bottom: solid 1px #999; font-size: .8em; font-style: italic; padding: 3px 0 3px 10px; } #content { position: absolute; margin-left: 18%; width: 40%; top: 100px; padding: 5px; } #nav1 { position: absolute; width: 30%; left: 60%; top: 100px; padding: 5px; } #nav2 { position: absolute; padding: 5px 5px 5px 10px; top: 100px; width: 15%; } #footer { text-align: center; padding-top: 7em; } .warning { font-weight: bold; color: red; } .title { font-size: 120%; } .content { font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;\n\n2.8 Determining When to Use Class and ID Selectors | 57\n\nmargin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;\n\n} .footer { font-size: 75%; }\n\nHere are the ID and class selectors in the HTML code: CSS Cookbook\n\nCSS Collection\n\nShowcase of CSS Web Sites\n\nContent Page Title\n\nContent Item Title\n\nContent goes here.\n\nAds go here.\n\nDiscussion ID selectors identify unique attributes that have one instance in the document tree, whereas class selectors can be used frequently throughout the web page. Remember that ID selectors use a hash symbol (#) and class selectors begin with a period (.).\n\n58 | Chapter 2: CSS Basics\n\nTypically, web developers will use ID selectors to mark off unique sections of a web page. In the Solution, notice that the page is divided into the following sections: • • • • •\n\nHeader Content Navigation Blipverts Siteinfo\n\nBy assigning these sections their own ID selector, designers are able to apply customized styles to those areas of the page, while keeping those same styles away from the other sections. This is accomplished through the combination of descendant selectors and ID selectors. In the following example, the different h3 elements get different CSS rules: #content h3 { font-size: 2em; font-weight: bold; } #navigation h3 { font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; }\n\nHTML5 divisions Although still a Working Draft at this stage, the HTML5 specification at the time of this writing creates new elements that replace common division in an HTML document with the div element. Some of these new HTML5 elements are: • • • • • •\n\nheader nav section article aside footer\n\nInstead of writing divisions in the HTML like so:\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n2.8 Determining When to Use Class and ID Selectors | 59\n\n...\n\n...\n\nyou write them within the HTML5 document as follows, resulting in cleaner markup:\n\n...\n\n<section> ...\n\n...\n\nYou can start using HTML5 now, but there are a few caveats. First you need to use the new DOCTYPE for HTML5, which is easy to memorize in comparison to XHTML’s DOCTYPE:\n\nThen you need to use JavaScript to get Internet Explorer to treat the new elements like block-level elements: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> document.createElement(\"header\"); document.createElement(\"section\"); document.createElement(\"nav\"); document.createElement(\"aside\"); document.createElement(\"footer\");\n\nAlthough you might rely on JavaScript to enforce a block-level element in Internet Explorer, some web designers have decided to take one step back: they still use div elements, but set the values of the id attributes to those of HTML5 elements. Through this technique, they are preparing themselves for when HTML5 has gained wider acceptance in browsers. At that time, they can do a simple search and replace through their code to convert a page to HTML5 elements.\n\n60 | Chapter 2: CSS Basics\n\nAlso, when styling the elements be sure to set the elements as block level: header, section, nav, aside, footer { display: block; }\n\nSee Also A clickable list of HTML5 elements at http://simon.html5.org/html5-elements; the CSS 2.1 specification for ID selectors at http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#id-se lectors; the CSS 2.1 specification for class selectors at http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/ selector.html#class-html\n\n2.9 Understanding CSS Properties Problem You want to learn more about CSS properties.\n\nSolution Recipes in this chapter cook up popular properties such as color, font-family, fontsize, and text-decoration. Properties fall between the brackets and their values immediately follow, as shown in the following generic example: selector { property: value; }\n\nA real-world example might look like this: li { list-style-type: circle; }\n\nAnytime li appears in the document, the bullet appears as a circle rather than as a traditional bullet.\n\nDiscussion Selectors identify what should be styled, whereas properties identify how the selectors should be modified. For example, the color property means the element’s color will change, but it doesn’t indicate what color it will change to. That’s the job for value.
