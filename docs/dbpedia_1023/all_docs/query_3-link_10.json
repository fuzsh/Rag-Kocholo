Over the target this aircraft and two others were attacked by Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters. During a firing pass, one of the Zeros attacked from below and hit the fuselage causing a fire to ignite inside the plane that extended out the waist windows and tail. Damaged, the aircraft released its bombs on the target and seven crew were observed to bail out. Of the seven that bailed out, one fell out of his parachute harness and fell to his death; the other six parachutes deployed successfully but were strafed unmercifully by clipped wing [A6M3] Zeros. With the pilots still at the controls, at 1,000 feet the tail of the B-17 wrenched off and floated downward. The rest of the bomber exploded and disintegrated just before it crashed into the sea; a few moments later it sank beneath the waves.

Attacked by enemy aircraft over Sofia, The engineer/top turret gunner was killed by cannon fire. Operated a mission to the railway marshalling yards at Padua, Italy 11Mar44. A group of lower flying B-24 Liberators on a different axis of attack caused the planes of the 2nd Bomb Group to abort the run and make a 360 to the right for a second bomb run at the target. This gave time for enemy fighters to assemble for an attack on the bombers. Attacked by enemy fighters the formation, consisting of B-17Gs, pulled ahead and left this B-17F trailing and exposed. The pilot had trained on Curtiss P-40 Warhawks and treated this bomber as if it was a fighter to avoid several rocket attacks. Surprised that the bomber was still flying, a couple of Bf 109s came close to inspect but the bomber had not been damaged and returned safely to base. {46 missions}. 348th Bomb Squadron, 99th Bomb Group, Foggia #2 (Sandfly), Tortorella, Italy 28Mar44. 840th Bomb Squadron, 483rd Bomb Group, Foggia #2 (Sandfly), Tortorella, Italy 31Mar44.

Foggia #7, Amendola, Italy 10Dec43. Failed to return from a mission to the railway marshalling yard and a road bridge at Certaldo, Florence, Italy 15Jan44 (5POW:5EVD). The plane was hit by flak over Northern Italy en route to the target. No.2 engine oil line was broken; oil covered the ball turret, fire was put out and the propeller feathered. The pilot tried staying with the formation and the crew jettisoned the bombs into Lago Trasimeno to lighten the aircraft. The Group did not encounter enemy fighters or flak in the target area, but because of confusion and errors in navigation, flew in the vicinity of Perugia airfield. The twenty-five to thirty airfield defense guns threw up a flak barrage over a stretch of fifteen miles. A short while later the No.1 engine began to run hot, the No.3 and No.4 engines were running okay, but the plane was losing altitude at the rate of 300 feet a minute. At 16,000ft, the crew threw out everything not bolted down. The bomber was last seen forty-eight miles northeast of Terni, Italy, with number one propeller feathered and smoke coming from number four engine, as the airplane lost altitude. When the aircraft was down to 13,000ft, the pilot informed the crew to bail out. The navigator and bombardier bailed out and the rest of the crew followed; they had bailed out near Radicofani and the aircraft crashed at Chiusi, Siena, Italy. {18 missions}. MACR 1814. Named ETHEL.

The aircraft took off early evening from Jackson Field (7 Mile Drome), Port Moresby, New Guinea on a mission against a Japanese convoy bound for Lae, New Guinea 6Jan43 (6MIA:3INJ). The bomber had two bomb bay fuel tanks for extended range plus thirty flares to shadow the convoy and drop flares to assist with a possible night attack against the convoy. Flying alone at 10,000 feet, the crew located the convoy before dark, spotting the ships and escorting fighters, but they didnt fly up to challenge them. Near the end of their patrol, the crew attempted to contact the squadron to learn if another bomber would replace them, but had radio problems. The bomber continued to shadow the convoy until early morning 7Jan43. Turning back for base, the bomber encountered bad weather over the Owen Stanley mountains. The pilot was forced to make repeated attempts to cross the mountains and climbed to 29,000 feet but was unable to locate Port Moresby. Out of fuel, the plane ditched into the Gulf of Papua roughly thirty miles off the southern coast of New Guinea. During the ditching, six of the crew went missing. The three surviving crew were badly injured but managed to deploy a life raft. Later that same day, a RAAF Anson from No.1 Communication Unit spotted the survivors and reported their position. A Short Empire flying boat overflew the three men, spotted the life raft and reported the downed crew. Thirteen hours after the crash, a boat rescued the three surviving crew and transported them back to Port Moresby. SOC 30Apr45. 24384 (MSN 3069) Accepted by USAAF 22Jun42.

Took off from Jackson Field on a bombing mission against a Japanese convoy off Tonolei Harbor on southern Bougainville 13Nov42. Over the target, the formation descended to 2,000 feet and was fired on by anti-aircraft guns. The plane was struck in the No.4 engine before skip bombing a 10,000 ton transport ship. When it made a second bomb run on a 8,000 ton transport ship, an anti-aircraft shell exploded close to the plane and broke the nose Plexiglas. Departing the area, another engine was only operating at half power. Damaged, the B-17 overcame both bad weather and damage but manage to returned to Jackson Field. Jackson Field (7 Mile Drome), Port Moresby, New Guinea 23Jan43. Battle damaged on a mission to shadow a Japanese task force in the Bismarck Sea 1Mar43. With two long-range fuel tanks in the bomb bay, the bomber monitored the convoy for more than eleven hours. During that time the plane was struck by anti-aircraft fire and hit repeatedly in attacks by enemy fighters but survived to return to Port Moresby. Took off from Jackson Field on a reconnaissance/administrative flight to Merauke, New Guinea and Horn Island, QLD, Australia 26Mar43 (12MIA). The pilot was Brigadier General Howard K. Ramey; aboard were passengers from Headquarters, Fifth Bomber Command. Twenty minutes after takeoff, the radio operator checked in with the ground station; there was no further communication with the aircraft. After the loss, General Douglas MacArthur was concerned that Brigadier General Ramey might have fallen into Japanese hands but there was no evidence that a Japanese aircraft intercepted this B-17 or that any of the crew became prisoner of war. {17 missions}. Named PLUTO - artwork of the Walt Disney character Pluto sniffing the ground. While the plane was being equipped at McClellan Field, the navigator was in charge of outfitting the bomber. Afterwards, he was asked what if he wanted to name the plane. He liked dogs so suggested 'Pluto\". Borinquen Field, Aguadilla, Puerto Rico was renamed Ramey Air Force Base after Brigadier General Howard Knox Ramey During February 2007 Australian news erroneously reported the discovery of an aircraft wreck off Cape York, claimed it to be this bomber. This claim was unsupported with serial number evidence; photos and video of the wreckage point to the wreckage being of a Douglas C-47 or derivative. 24385 (MSN 3070) Accepted by USAAF 22Jun42. 326th Bomb Squadron, 92nd Bomb Group, Dow Field, Bangor, ME 19Jul42.

This aircraft was part of a group of six B-17´s that departed transporting a group of high ranking American and British officer's via Gibraltar to the opening of Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa; took Generals Doolittle and Lemnitzer. En route, the bomber was attacked by four German Ju 88s patrolling over the Bay of Biscay. Since guns were lacking ammunition, the pilot decided to drop down to about 100 feet above the sea. The German planes joined them, two on each side and although the two turret guns were aimed at them, little firing was done, for ammunition was being rationed. Soon the German leader turned and made his pass followed by the others. The co-pilot was wounded by a bullet and General Doolittle, who had never been checked out in a B-17, replaced him. Low on fuel, the enemy returned home before further damage could be done. No.3 engine had been struck by a cannon shell and the propeller feathered.

Flew combat familiarization flights over northern Australia. 63rd Bomb Squadron, 43rd Bomb Group, Mareeba airfield, QLD Sep42. The aircraft took off just after midnight from Mareeba airfield 13/14Sep42 (9KIA:1KIS). Half way through the takeoff roll the right outboard engine began to misfire and quit. Takeoff speed was too high to abort so the pilot apparently applied full war power to the other engines and appeared to hauled back on the control yoke thus pitching the aircraft into a nose high attitude. The aircraft lifted off but overloaded and under powered flew for 1/4 of a mile off the end of the bomber airstrip then crashed into a woodland and dry creek bed. It caught fire and the bomb load exploded, killing one person on the ground. Assigned to LEFT (Fifth Air Force, Brisbane, Australia). Condemned 14Sep42. SOC 10Oct46.

Attacked by enemy Bf 109 and Fw 190 fighters. With his guns frozen, the tail gunner was injured when struck by a 20mm cannon shell. Seeing the fighters attacking the tail, the ball turret gunner instructed the pilot to raise the tail but at that moment a cannon shell struck the ball turret, originally aimed at the tail. The shell exploded in the turret, injuring the gunner. The radio operator had also been wounded, the no.3 engine propeller was feathered and the no.1 engine was on fire. As the pilot headed back to Châteaudun, the fire in no.1 engine had extinguished. On approach to land, a tire was found to have been shot out but the plane landed safely then grounded looped when the flat tire touched the runway, bending a couple of propellers.

After the target the formation was attacked by a force of enemy fighters. The bomber was tail end charlie and being shot at from the rear. A 20mm cannon shell exploded behind the upper turret. The right wing had been badly damaged and holed by machine gun fire. Two engines had been disabled, no.4 had an over speeding propeller and the controls were damaged preventing the propeller from being feathered. The no.2 engine was disabled and tail control surfaces had their control cables shot up. With part of the oxygen system damaged, the pilot dropped down to 20,000ft but a couple of gunners passed out with anoxia. The plane went into a steep climb but the two pilots managed to bring it back under control. With enemy fighters still attacking, the pilot advised the crew to prepare to bail out. Then The engineer/top turret gunner collapsed between the two pilots and was in no state to bail out. By now over the English Channel and with a RAF Spitfire escort, the pilot continued towards England and looked for an airfield to force land at. Finding an airfield, the aircraft struck a hangar but crash landed at RAF Gatwick, Sussex. The nose had to be cut off to release injured crewmen; sixteen cannon holes, over 300 bullet holes plus flak damage. Base Air Depot No.1, Burtonwood (Station 590), Lancashire. Regained by Group.
