Sloan and Mark A. Hager, WELLS FARGO & COMPANY, 90 South Seventh Street, MAC N9305-164, Minneapolis, MN 55479, for plaintiff.\n\nThomas P. Cole, Gregory E. Van Hoey, and Jacqueline C. Brown, UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, TAX DIVISION, P.O. Box 7328, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044, for defendant.\n\nPlaintiff WFC Holdings Corporation (\"WFC\" or \"Wells Fargo\"1) brought this action against the United States seeking a refund of federal income taxes in the amount of at least $82,313,366 for the tax year ending December 31, 1996. (Compl. ¶ 1, Docket No. 1.) According to the government, WFC's refund demand is based on capital losses accruing from a sham transaction intended to operate as a tax shelter. A trial on the merits was conducted by the Court without a jury on October 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 20, 22, 25, and November 3, 2010. The parties presented closing arguments on February 18, 2011. Having considered each party's evidence, exhibits, and arguments of counsel, the Court enters its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order for Judgment, pursuant to Rule 52(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n1. All of the Findings of Fact set forth herein are undisputed or have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n2. To the extent that the Court's Conclusions of Law include what may be considered Findings of Fact, they are incorporated herein by reference.\n\nI. CORPORATE STRUCTURE\n\n3. Wells Fargo & Company, formerly known as Norwest Corporation (\"Norwest\"), is a diversified financial services company that, together with its subsidiaries, provides banking, insurance, investment, mortgage, and consumer finance services. (Joint Stip. ¶ 1, Docket No. 157.)\n\n4. WFC Holdings is the successor-in-interest to the corporation previously known as Wells Fargo & Company (\"Old Wells Fargo,\" or simply \"Wells Fargo\" when the distinction is irrelevant), which was acquired by Norwest on November 2, 1998, through the merger of Old Wells Fargo into WFC Holdings. (Id. ¶ 2.)\n\n5. Following the 1998 Norwest merger and at all times relevant to this lawsuit, WFC Holdings was the parent corporation of an affiliated group of corporations, including Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank (Texas), N.A. (\"the transferring banks\" or, individually and/or with other Wells Fargo banking operations \"the bank\"). (Id. ¶¶ 2-3.)\n\n6. Following the 1998 Norwest merger and at all times relevant to this lawsuit, Wells Fargo & Company owned and continues to own all of the outstanding stock of WFC Holdings. (Id. ¶ 8.)\n\n7. Following the 1998 Norwest merger and at all times relevant to this lawsuit, WFC has been the common parent corporation of Charter Holdings, Inc. (\"Charter\"). (Id. ¶ 10.)\n\n8. Charter was known as AMFED Financial, Inc. (\"AMFED\") prior to December 10, 1998. (Id. ¶ 15.)\n\n9. At all relevant times, each of the transferring banks was and continues to be a national banking association subject to the regulatory oversight of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\") of the United States Department of the Treasury. (Id. ¶ 13.)\n\n10. At all relevant times, Charter was and continues to be a holding company subject to the regulatory oversight of the Federal Reserve Board (\"the Fed\"). (Id. ¶ 16.)\n\n11. The transferring banks, their parent corporation WFC Holdings, and Charter were at all relevant times and continue to be domestic corporations. (Id. ¶¶ 4, 9, 14.)\n\n12. As the parent corporation of an affiliated group of corporations including WFC Holdings and Charter, WFC files consolidated income tax returns for such entities. (Id.)\n\nII. LEASE RESTRUCTURING TRANSACTION AND REFUND CLAIM: SUMMARY\n\n13. The transaction at issue in this case -- known as the \"underwater lease transaction\" or \"lease restructuring transaction\" (\"LRT\") -- consisted of three steps, summarized briefly here and elaborated upon below.\n\n14. First, on December 17, 1998, pursuant to an exchange agreement among the transferring banks, WFC, and Charter, the banks transferred government securities with an aggregate fair market value of $429,899,099 and a tax basis of $427,849,534, and leasehold interests in twenty-one commercial properties (comprised of twenty-two master leases, collectively \"the selected leases\") to Charter in exchange for 4,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock (\"Preferred Stock\") in Charter and Charter's assumption of the lease obligations. By transferring the leases to Charter, the transferring banks transferred to Charter both assets (i.e. the leasehold interests) and their associated liabilities (i.e. the rent payable under such leases). (Id. ¶¶ 20, 25, 41.)\n\n15. The accounting firm KPMG LLP (\"KMPG\") estimated the present value of the future cash flows associated with the transferred leases to be negative $425,899,099. (Id. ¶ 25.)\n\n16. Second, on December 17, 1998, the transferring banks sold their 4,000 shares of Charter Preferred Stock to WFC for $4,000,000 in cash. (Id. ¶ 26.)\n\n17. Third, on February 26, 1999, WFC sold 4,000 shares of the Preferred Stock to Lehman Brothers, Inc. (\"Lehman\") for $3,750,022.22. (Id. ¶ 27.)\n\n18. WFC timely filed with the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\" or \"government\") a federal corporate income tax return for the tax year ending December 31, 1999 which included a deduction for a capital loss in the amount of $423,849,534 (\"1999 Capital Loss\"), but WFC did not utilize any portion of the 1999 Capital Loss in its 1999 tax return. (Joint Stip. ¶ 29.)\n\n19. On March 25, 2003, WFC filed a refund claim, Form 1120X, with the IRS, claiming a refund of federal income taxes previously paid by Old Wells Fargo on the 1996 tax return. (Id. ¶ 31.)\n\n20. In its refund claim, WFC claimed a net capital loss carryback from its 1999 tax return which was in part attributable to the 1999 Capital Loss. (Id. ¶ 32.)\n\n21. On April 6, 2007, the IRS disallowed the refund claim with respect to the carryback at issue in this suit. (Id. ¶ 34.)\n\nIII. ACQUISITION OF FIRST INTERSTATE/UNDERWATER LEASES\n\n22. The LRT at issue began with WFC's acquisition of a large quantity of real estate.\n\n23. On January 23, 1996, Old Wells Fargo reached an agreement to acquire First Interstate Bancorp (\"First Interstate\"), another financial services company. The acquisition was completed on April 1, 1996. (Id. ¶¶ 36-37.)\n\n24. At the time of the First Interstate acquisition, Old Wells Fargo was a publicly traded bank holding company with business operations concentrated in California. (Id. ¶ 35.)\n\n25. First Interstate was also based in the Western United States, with particular concentrations in California and Texas. (Id. ¶ 36.)\n\n26. Generally, when WFC is considering acquiring another company, its Corporate Properties Group (\"CPG\") values the target's real estate portfolio, the value of which is integrated in WFC's offer price. (Tr. 68.)\n\n27. From 1985 to the present, through dozens of acquisitions and mergers, Donald Dana has run CPG; he is the company's top real estate executive. (Tr. 64, 67.)\n\n28. CPG oversees all owned and leased real property held by every entity under the Wells Fargo umbrella, with the exception of real properties acquired by foreclosure. (Tr. 66.)\n\n29. WFC's real estate portfolio consists of over 110 million square feet of space with a present market value of approximately $10 billion. Real estate expenses account for either the second or third largest category of expenses in WFC's organization. (Tr. 65-66, 81.)\n\n30. CPG's responsibilities include negotiating the acquisition (i.e. purchase or lease) and disposition (i.e. sale or sublease) of properties, and managing existing properties. CPG's portfolio includes retail properties such as bank branches and administrative properties such as accounting offices. (Tr. 66, 72.)\n\n31. WFC does not always use or occupy all of the space under each master lease it holds for the entirety of the lease term. WFC mitigates the losses associated with rental payments for unused space through three methods: assignment of the lease, sublease of the space, or termination of the lease. (Tr. 68-69, 77.)\n\n32. Because Old Wells Fargo acquired First Interstate through a hostile takeover, information regarding First Interstate's real estate portfolio was generally unavailable to CPG prior to the acquisition. CPG was therefore unable to accurately value the assets and liabilities in First Interstate's real estate portfolio prior to WFC making an offer price. (Tr. 80-81.)\n\n33. Because the First Interstate acquisition joined two companies with significantly overlapping geographic footprints, Old Wells Fargo was left with a large quantity of excess leased space that it no longer needed for its business operations, but on which it remained obligated to pay rent. (Tr. 106-07.)\n\n34. After the acquisition, Old Wells Fargo discovered that it had vastly underestimated the costs of integrating the companies' real estate portfolios. (Tr. 105-06.)\n\n35. Old Wells Fargo maintained loss reserves on its books for properties it deemed \"underwater,\" meaning Old Wells Fargo's contractual rent and related obligations exceeded the market rent that it projected it could obtain from the properties (as through a sublease) over the remainder of the leases. (Tr. 335.)\n\n36. By March 1996, Old Wells Fargo calculated that the losses from the underwater leases acquired from First Interstate exceeded $310 million, while losses from Old Wells Fargo branches rendered redundant by the merger were approximately $185 million. By July 1996, Old Wells Fargo calculated that the total costs associated with combining the companies' real estate portfolios could exceed $1 billion, instead of its pre-acquisition estimate of approximately $360 million in losses associated with obtaining First Interstate's real estate portfolio. (Px. 7; Tr. 94-95, 105-06.)\n\n37. CPG took efforts to dispose of the excess property, selling or subleasing more than 362 such properties in 1997. It nonetheless still had a large number of administrative properties as well as some retail properties. (Tr. 106-07.)\n\nIV. THE ECONOMIC LIABILITY TRANSACTION: DESIGN, MARKETING, ANDSALE TO WFC\n\n38. Joel Resnick, formerly a partner at KPMG, WFC's accounting firm, offered testimony regarding a \"tax product\" KPMG marketed to clients called an \"economic liability transaction.\" (Resnick Dep. 26-28.)\n\n39. An economic liability transaction involves a corporate entity with a significant contingent economic liability, such as the prospect of liability in a series of pending asbestos-related lawsuits, post-retirement employee medical benefits, underwater lease obligations, or other \"unmature\" obligations. The parent corporate entity transfers assets and the contingent liability to a subsidiary in exchange for stock in the subsidiary; the fair market value of the stock equals the value of the assets minus the contingent liability. The parent entity receiving the stock then sells it to an unrelated third party, generating a deductible capital loss of approximately the same amount as the projected amount of the transferred contingent liability. In deducting this capital loss against its unrelated capital gains, the parent entity reduces its federal income tax liability, or as KMPG described it, the entity engages in \"capital gain sheltering.\" The subsidiary corporation that assumed the contingent liability, however, also deducts its payments of the contingent liabilities as they accrue. The parent entity and subsidiary file a consolidated federal income tax return. (Resnick Dep. 28-29, Walker Dep. 17-18; Dx. 49, 64, 298.)\n\n40. KPMG employees developing the economic liability transaction product knew that a company needed a non-tax business purpose to justify the transaction. Ascertaining a non-tax business purposes was \"the first question\" KPMG asked of clients considering the transaction. (Walker Dep. 37-40; Dx. 53.)\n\n41. An internal KPMG memorandum dated May 19, 1997 lists \"various theories that might be asserted by the Internal Revenue Service to challenge the validity of the Economic Liability transaction[,]\" and suggests that the IRS might prevail in its challenge to a deduction generated by an economic liability transaction. Nonetheless, in May 1997, KPMG approved the marketing of the economic liability transaction to \"appropriate clients.\" KMPG charged clients a fixed fee, generally based on the size of the anticipated capital loss generated, for its work in facilitating the transaction. (Dx. 57; Walker Dep. 53.)\n\n42. On February 18, 1998, KPMG representatives met with representatives from Old Wells Fargo, including its tax director Richard \"Dick\" Hayes and senior tax attorney Karen Bowen. Through a presentation, KPMG representatives explained the economic liability transaction in the context of CPG's underwater leases. KPMG represented to WFC that WFC would not need to recognize an accounting loss upon its sale of the stock to a third party, but could claim as a tax deduction the entire amount of the transferred contingent liabilities, the underwater leases. KMPG also clarified that WFC would need to represent to KPMG that the restructuring was \"motivated in part by significant non-tax reasons[,]\" namely reducing its anticipated losses from the lease obligations. (Dx. 71 at WFC-11-0330; Dx. 68, 69; Bowen Dep. 55-56.)\n\n43. In a letter sent by KPMG to Hayes on March 6, 1998, KMPG proposed that Wells Fargo engage KMPG to assess the feasibility of, design, and implement \"coordinated loss strategies related to losses inherent in the assets managed by the Corporate Properties Group (CPG).\" KMPG copied Ross Kari, then Wells Fargo's Chief Financial Officer, on the letter along with other WFC officials. (Dx. 73; Kari Dep. 11-13.)\n\n44. On June 3, 1998, as KPMG commenced developing WFC's economic liability transaction, it sent Hayes and Dana sample documents \"illustrative of documentation necessary to complete the proposed restructuring transaction.\" The documentation included memoranda summarizing representations for a sample tax opinion letter, a certificate of amendment of certificate of incorporation, a support agreement, an exchange agreement, and a stock purchase agreement, among numerous other documents. (Dx. 87.)\n\n45. Following the announcement of the proposed merger between Old Wells Fargo and Norwest on June 8, 1998, KPMG characterized the economic liability transaction as a \"quick hit\" tax-planning strategy to be accomplished before the merger. KPMG estimated that the transactions involving the underwater leases could generate tax savings of $80 million. KPMG represented that it had already begun to identify assets to be used in the transaction by working with Dana and others from CPG. (Dx. 100 at WFP2-08096, WFP2-09098-99.)\n\n46. WFC agreed to pay KPMG a commission of $3 million for its work on the LRT, the economic liability transaction involving the underwater leases. KPMG employee Todd Voss managed the project, which involved coordinating the actions of approximately two dozen people including KPMG personnel, WFC employees, and outside lawyers. (Dx. 123, 437.)\n\n47. On August 18, 1998, Bowen sent an internal e-mail message in which she stated, \"We are working with CPG on a project to move underwater leases to a special purpose entity to trigger unrealized tax losses.\" (Dx. 120 (emphasis added).)\n\n48. An engagement letter from KPMG dated August 18, 1998, refers to KPMG's $3 million fee for designing and implementing the LRT for projected tax savings. (Dx. 123.) A subsequent, more detailed engagement letter sets forth agreed upon procedures for KPMG's work in ascertaining the bank's leasehold equity position in twenty-one selected leases. This letter, dated September 1, 1998, does not refer to any prospective tax benefits. (Dx. 147.) Although the date September 1, 1998 appears below Dana's signature on that letter, it was backdated. The parties signed and faxed the letter in January 1999. (Dx. 435, 706 at 254-59.)\n\nV. DEVELOPING THE LRT: BUSINESS PURPOSE\n\n49. An initial step of developing the LRT was \"document[ing] [a] valid nontax business purpose for transferring the lease obligations.\" KPMG initially assigned this task to Hayes and Bowen in WFC's tax department. Bowen, however, responded that \"far more effective documentation would originate with the business drivers, prepared in nontax-oriented style (with our review and input as needed).\" (Dx. 110.) Accordingly, Don Dana was tasked with identifying a non-tax business purpose for the LRT. (Dx. 195.)\n\n50. In an August 31, 1998 draft by Dana to document the business purpose of the LRT, Dana wrote, in response to the question \"Why a separate subsidiary?\":\n\nIt has been over 2-1/2 years since our merger with [First Interstate]. We have done all we can with these underwater leases using traditional methods, we are about to enter into a new merger with Norwest, and I am concerned that focus and attention necessary to effectively manage these assets will be diluted. A separate subsidiary, similar to the one I set up years ago when we built and leased the 500,000 square foot Wells Tower in Sacramento, will preserve focus and attention by segregating the most hard core liabilities and directly incenting key managers for performance in excess of market expectations.\n\n(Dx. 142 (emphasis added).) Dana proposed incenting property managers to share in the equity of the subsidiary to the extent that their disposition of property exceeded the market expectations formed by an \"independent real estate review. . . .\" (Id.)\n\n51. On or around September 10, 1998, Voss -- the KPMG employee managing the LRT -- sent Dana a sample business purpose document used by another KPMG client. (Dx. 156.) The business purposes articulated in the sample document likewise primarily relate to efficiencies obtained through centralization. (Id.) It reflected a similar sample document sent to WFC in February 1998. (Dx. 71 at KPMG-Box02-0294 to 0295.)\n\n52. On September 19, 1998, Dana emailed to Wells Fargo and KPMG personnel involved in the LRT an updated and slightly lengthened draft of his business purpose document. (Dx. 188.) The business purpose as articulated by Dana remained focused on the benefits of focusing management and incentivizing disposition of the underwater leases. (Id.) Dana also, however, included a new justification relating to valuable customers of WFC (\"good bank customers\") which sought to leverage their banking relationship to obtain favorable lease terms:\n\nWe can be tougher on greedy landlords. While it may sound cosmetic, operating in a separate subsidiary with a different name limits the ability of our \"good customer\" landlords to leverage their lending or deposit relationship in sublease approval negotiations. In short, it changes the expectations of landlord and brokers, allowing us to act more like a real estate company and less like a financial institution.\n\n(Dx. 188.)\n\n53. As late as September 30, 1998, an internal KPMG email reflected the company's understanding that WFC's business purpose in conducting the LRT was \"to provide a capital gain stock incentive to certain key employees to incent them to drive down the amount of [the] 'underwater' lease liabilit[ies]. . . . [Wells Fargo's] real estate person . . . feels quite comfortable in defending this business purpose so long as the incentive plan is consistent with his views.\" (Dx. 204.)\n\n54. The business purpose document, however, was dramatically revised following a change in management of WFC's tax department after the Norwest merger.\n\n55. Prior to the merger, Dick Hayes was WFC's Vice President of Tax while Dan Vandermark was the Vice President of Tax for Norwest. (Bowen Dep. 38.) Ultimately, Vandermark became the Vice President of Tax for the merged bank. (Dx. 154.)\n\n56. On September 29, 1998, Karen Bowen advised Dana that Vandermark had learned about the LRT and had expressed concerns with the transaction, in particular with the asserted business purpose. Bowen advised that there were several suggestions of how to \"bolster the business purpose. . . .\" With regard to the new concerns, Dana responded that\n\n[i]t's important that we get a green light or red light on this deal as soon as possible. This continues to be a huge burden on me and my people despite the best efforts of KPMG to shoulder much of the work, and I personally will have a lot to say if this turns out to have been a huge waste of time.\n\n(Dx. 201.)\n\n57. Vandermark, who according to Bowen was attempting to exercise control during the leadership transition and ensure that he received some credit for concluding the transaction, asserted that the LRT was at risk of being challenged by the government. (Bowen Dep. 121-22.) In particular, Vandermark believed that the asserted business purpose of incentivizing managers through the issuance of equity was \"bullshit\" because there were numerous other ways to incentivize managers with a similar economic return. (Id. at 123.) According to Bowen, \"[i]t was [Vandermark's] expressed belief at that time . . . that the existence and desire to offer the incentive plan in the way we had crafted it did not contribute to the business purpose.\" (Id. at 124.)\n\n58. Vandermark expressed his concerns directly to Dana, instructing him to revise the business case with the expectation that the IRS would one day review it. By Dana's account, Vandermark wanted a business purpose document that could withstand IRS scrutiny, rather than Dana's draft which he testified was aimed at a narrower audience of executives and officers of WFC who needed to approve the transaction. (Tr. 234.)\n\n59. Dana testified that Vandermark was his colleague, not his superior, and that Vandermark did not have authority to \"pull the plug\" on the LRT. (Tr. 235; see also Tr. 324 (testimony from WFC's Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") that Dana's position was more senior than Vandermark's).) According to a contemporaneous email message from KPMG's Voss, however, \"Don [Dana] said that Vandermark is controlling the strategy [on the LRT] . . . [and Dana] reiterat[ed] that Vandermark has veto power\" over the LRT transaction. (Dx. 271 (emphasis added).) Dana testified that Vandermark had veto power only over whether the LRT was to be structured and used for a tax benefit, not whether it would occur. (Tr. 299.)\n\n60. Vandermark testified that, in his opinion, WFC \"wouldn't get through an audit lottery\" with such a large transaction. Accordingly, \"we knew we were going to be going to court on this, and so we wanted to be prepared for it from the get-go. So I told them that we would need to document -- fully document every aspect of the -- business purpose of this transaction.\" (Vandermark Dep. 36.)\n\n61. Dana testified that the concerns expressed by Vandermark were unrelated to his reasons for pursuing the LRT, and that he was committed to proceeding with the transaction regardless of whether Vandermark approved of it from a tax perspective. (Tr. 150-51.) Bowen similarly testified that \"early on,\" prior to meetings with KPMG about the transaction, \"Don Dana said he would do this transaction whether we got tax benefits or not.\" (Bowen Dep. 136.) Vandermark also recalled Dana's assertion that he intended to transfer some leases into a non-banking subsidiary regardless of the tax benefits. (Vandermark Dep. 67-69.)\n\n62. An internal KPMG email from October 6, 1998 indicates that Vandermark gave the LRT a \"99.9% chance of losing\" a tax audit unless, among other issues, its business purpose was bolstered and quantified. KPMG understood that Vandermark received authority from WFC's CEO to \"pull the plug\" on the transaction if his concerns were not adequately addressed. (Dx. 213.)\n\n63. On October 7, 1998, WFC regulatory attorney Julius Loeser explained by email that transferring underwater leases into a non-banking subsidiary would seem to confer a tremendous regulatory benefit to WFC. Specifically, Loeser explained that pursuant to OCC regulations, WFC had a limited time period in which to dispose (i.e. through assignment or termination) of leased space that was no longer actively used in banking operations and had not been coterminously subleased. By contrast, the Fed, with regulatory oversight over the non-bank subsidiary expected to receive the underwater leases, imposed no such mandatory disposition regulations for leased premises. Transferring underwater leases into a non-banking subsidiary would therefore allow WFC more flexibility in managing the leases. Loeser had gathered this information in the course of speaking with Ken Kinoshita of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. (Dx. 216.)\n\n64. A memorandum dated October 13, 1998, to Dana from another CPG regulatory attorney references Loeser's conversation with Kinoshita and affirms the information he obtained and his analysis. The memorandum purports to \"respond[ ] to your question regarding possible regulatory advantages of transferring, by assignment,\" bank premises into a non-banking subsidiary. (Px. 38 at 26.)\n\n65. On October 13, 1998, Dana circulated an expanded, fourteen-page version of his business purpose document. The cover sheet for the document included the statement, \"The business case stands on its own, but if you can figure out how to get some tax breaks in the process -- GREAT!\" For the first time, Dana articulated in writing another business purpose of the LRT: regulatory concerns. According to Dana, CPG's ability to execute lease extension options on behalf of prospective subtenants was impeded by the OCC's time-sensitive mandatory disposition rules. By transferring such leases to the non-banking subsidiary, thus causing the leases to fall under the Fed's regulatory oversight, WFC could avoid such restrictions and capitalize on existing lease \"tails.\" (Dx. 225 at WFC-37-0248, WFC-37-0254.)\n\n66. As an example, Dana cited the Garland operations building on the fringe of downtown Los Angeles. The Garland building, acquired from First Interstate in 1996, is a 700,000 square foot space rendered superfluous after the merger. The bottom floors have no windows and are essentially designed as a vault. WFC was liable to pay rent on a lease on the Garland building through 2009, with multiple purchase and lease extension options. Bank of America, WFC's competitor, was interested in leasing 130,000 square feet of the Garland building, including the cash vault, but required more than a ten-year term. According to Dana, OCC regulations prohibited him from offering such a sublease beyond the mandatory disposition period. Accordingly, Bank of America walked away from the deal. (Id. at WFC-37-0254.)\n\n67. In his October 13 business purpose document, Dana also elaborated on his explanation of the \"good bank customer\" purpose, comparing the LRT to his efforts with the Wells Tower in Sacramento (\"the Sacramento project\"). (Id. at WFC-37-0255-WFC-37-0259.)\n\n68. Dana's \"speak-now-or-forever-hold-your-peace[ ] draft\" of the business purpose document and subsequent final draft, dated November 17, 1998, were substantially similar, retaining and further expanding upon the regulatory benefit and \"good bank customer\" purposes, as well as the purpose of centralization/incentivizing managers. (Px. 37, 44, Tr. 251.)\n\n69. WFC ultimately proffered three non-tax business purposes to justify the LRT: (1) avoiding regulatory restrictions, (2) avoiding unfavorable deals with \"good bank customers,\" and (3) creating management efficiencies.\n\nVI. DEVELOPING THE LRT: BASE CASE AND \"WHAT IF\" SCENARIOS\n\n70. Another initial step of developing the LRT was determining which properties to utilize in the LRT. In assembling the portfolio of properties with underwater leases, Dana aimed for liabilities with a present value of approximately negative $400 million. He placed twenty-three leases under consideration. (Tr. 170; Dx. 149 at WFC-17-1007.)\n\n71. Dana testified that in choosing the selected leases for the LRT, he sought to assemble a portfolio that was large enough to provide him with the economies of scale sufficient to justify the time and expenses required of the transaction, yet small enough so that the employees managing the portfolio would retain focus on a select number of problematic properties. According to Dana, he excluded several properties with large potential losses, even though they would have ultimately increased the size of WFC's tax loss, because they might complicate Charter's mission. (Tr. 169-71.) Specifically, one of the largest underwater leases obtained by Wells Fargo through the First Interstate merger, 707 Wilshire, was excluded from the transaction because \"[w]e were in a partnership on the particular property, and [Dana] thought it just added one more conflict of interest, and [he] just didn't want to have Charter Holdings that complicated.\" (Tr. 169.)\n\n72. KPMG had previously confirmed that approximately $483 million in WFC's capital gains could be offset by capital losses. (Dx. 112.)\n\n73. Two properties -- Hayward Main and Stockton -- originally included in the portfolio were dropped from it in early October, as part of what a KPMG employee characterized as \"instructions . . . to get our numbers to the $390 million range.\" (Dx. 217, 680.)\n\n74. In September 1998, KPMG began to calculate a \"base case scenario,\" or the current value of the liabilities for the twenty-three underwater leases preliminarily selected for consideration in the LRT. To accomplish this task, KPMG considered information including Wells Fargo's expected revenue from current subtenants, market rates, and Wells Fargo's rent payments and operating expenses to master landlords. At Wells Fargo's direction, KPMG made certain global assumptions in formulating the base case scenario. These assumptions included the duration of each new sublease expected to be signed (generally five years, but ten years if Wells Fargo's master lease exceeded ten years), the down time between an expiring lease and the re-leasing of that space (nine months), and whether Wells Fargo could re-lease the \"lease tail,\" or space becoming available within forty-eight months of the maturity of the master lease (the assumption was it could not). KPMG also applied information supplied by a real estate broker from Cushman Realty. KPMG's base case scenario purported to reflect the net present value of the selected leases, assuming the LRT was not executed. (Dx. 349.)\n\n75. By September 25, 1998, KMPG's estimate reflected a total negative value of $410,338,482, although the number was still subject to change. (Dx. 195.) WFC ultimately dropped two of the twenty-three leases from the portfolio, settling on a portfolio of twenty-one properties. KPMG ultimately valued the selected leases at negative $425,899,099. (Joint Stip. ¶¶ 20, 25.)\n\n76. Around October 1998, Dana instructed KPMG to determine the LRT's effect on the total portfolio value by changing certain assumptions provided by WFC. These alternative calculations became known as the \"what if\" scenarios. They purported to reflect the savings that WFC could expect to achieve by entering into the LRT. Dana sought to have the calculation of the liabilities change by an amount of at least $10 to $15 million. (Dx. 223, Tr. 533.)\n\n77. Under one \"what if\" scenario, the occupancy level in each property was adjusted from 90% to 95%, based on the expectation that conducting the LRT would enable WFC to achieve a better occupancy rate in the properties. (Px. 44 at 13 (estimating that 5% of the success of the Sacramento project in beating market expectations was attributable to the structure of transferring responsibility to a non-banking subsidiary).) KPMG determined that achieving a 95% occupancy figure decreased the negative equity in the underwater leases by over $8 million, which was still, according to KPMG, \"below the range [Dana] sought.\" (Dx. 223.)\n\n78. Under another \"what if\" scenario, KPMG took those properties with empty space at the tail end of the master lease (sub-tenancies expiring within forty-eight months of the end of the master lease) and \"filled in\" the lease tails with subtenancies that were coterminous with the master lease. This \"what if\" scenario was predicated on WFC's ability to market the lease tails by using Charter to remove itself from OCC regulatory restrictions, at an estimated $14.1 million reduction in the leases' negative equity. (Px. 44 at 13; Tr. 278-79.)\n\n79. Under the third \"what if\" scenario, KPMG took properties that had existing subtenants paying below-market rent, and adjusted the rate to market value. WFC assumed that the LRT, by enabling CPG to avoid unfavorable real estate deals with \"good back customers,\" would facilitate a savings of approximately $1.5 million. (Px. 44. at 14.)\n\n80. Ronald Hendricks, an expert witness for the government, offered credible testimony criticizing the base case scenario for overstating the negative equity associated with the selected leases. (Dx. 671.)\n\n81. KPMG's estimation was not an independent market value appraisal because it relied exclusively on information provided by WFC and unchecked by KPMG or any other third party. (Dx. 671 at 8-10.) As even WFC's real estate expert, Gregory Gotthardt, acknowledged, KPMG's valuation was an \"investment valuation,\" not a market valuation, because it included assumptions obtained from WFC and was not the result of KPMG's independent market analysis. (Tr. 1043-44.)\n\n82. While WFC considered hiring a third party to conduct a market appraisal, it ultimately had the Cushman broker sign a letter stating that he had reviewed the final KPMG work and believed it to be reliable. (Dx. 257 (internal WFC email discussing the prudence of a third-party market valuation given the likelihood of governmental scrutiny of a transaction between a bank and a non-banking affiliate), 263 (noting request from Vandermark for valuation study by independent third party), 352 (letter from broker).)\n\n83. At the instruction of Wells Fargo representatives including Dana, KPMG changed certain assumptions in the base case scenario and otherwise manipulated the data to achieve Dana's target of approximately $400 million in negative equity. For example, Dana instructed KPMG to adjust the leaseback rate -- the rent rate that the bank would pay the WFC subsidiary for space it currently occupied and would sublet from the subsidiary after the LRT -- from the midpoint of the broker's market estimate range to the top. (Dx. 190.) Another example involved a KPMG estimate from September 22, 1998 of $383 million which identified two of the twenty-three leases as being \"in the money,\" meaning that they were not underwater but generating positive cash flows. (Id.) Further changes to the assumptions resulted in these two properties being re-characterized as underwater. (Dx. 195.)\n\n84. The base case included space already occupied by Wells Fargo as part of its banking operations. (Dx. 671 at 11-12.) This space was ultimately leased back to the bank by Charter. (See, e.g., 369.)\n\n85. For example, one selected lease, the Louisiana Street property, was almost completely occupied by Wells Fargo Bank-Texas as of fall 1998. (Dx. 155.) Nonetheless, Dana selected Louisiana Street for inclusion in the LRT. WFC maintained a loss reserve of at least $11 million on Louisiana Street, based on the difference between WFC's obligations to its landlord under the master lease and the rent it could expect to generate through subleases. (Dx. 111.)\n\n86. In addition, the base case assumes that the bank (and Charter) would not exercise early-termination options available with respect to several properties even though they were \"underwater\" and thus ostensibly undesirable. (Dx. 671 at 13.)\n\n87. As Hendricks documented, the base case's assumptions that new subleases would be for five-year periods and that it could not obtain any new sublease for the lease tail when a sublease expired within forty-eight months of the end of the master lease are contrary to WFC's actual subleasing practices with regard to the selected leases. In practice, prior to the LRT, WFC and its predecessor-in-interest obtained subleases for a variety of terms, frequently coterminous with the duration of the master lease. (Id. at 15-16.)\n\n88. The base case also assumes a flat rental rate for each new sublease, but in practice both the bank and Charter utilized an escalating rental rate structure for some properties. (Id. at 16.)\n\n89. While existing subtenants often renewed their subleases in the selected properties, the base case assumed zero retention of subtenants and a nine month period at the end of the sublease before a new subtenant would occupy the space. (Id. at 18-19.)\n\n90. As an example of how the base case overstates the negative equity of the selected leases, the government cites the Seattle Tower property in Seattle, Washington. By fall 1998, Wells Fargo Bank was using approximately 90,000 of 177,527 leased square feet (approximately 50%) in Seattle Tower for banking operations. (Dx. 371 at A-1, B-1.) The remainder of the useable space had been subleased to four subtenants. (Dx. 50, 52, 66, 402.) After the LRT, the bank subleased back from Charter approximately 90,000 square feet in Seattle Tower. (Dx. 371.) In calculating the base case, however, KPMG assumed that one subtenant occupied approximately 20,000 more square feet than it did, using the amount stated in its original sublease rather than the sublease as amended. KPMG assumed that WFC occupied and would continue to occupy all non-subleased space, but because of the miscalculation, the base case understates WFC's occupancy in Seattle Tower by approximately 20,000 square feet. Instead of stating that WFC occupied approximately 90,000 feet, the base case states that WFC occupied approximately 70,000 square feet. (Dx. 402.) However, in determining the base case negative value for Seattle Tower, KPMG assumed that WFC would only lease back 51,820 square feet. Although Seattle Tower was fully occupied, this number was selected to create a 90% occupancy rate for the building, to comport with KPMG's global assumption of 90% occupancy. (Tr. 1430-31.) From this figure, KMPG simply changed the occupancy rate from 90% to 95% to quantify anticipated lease improvement from the LRT.\n\nVII. IMPLEMENTING THE LRT: STEPS 1-2\n\n91. On November 17, 1998, Dana circulated the final version of his business purpose document to, among others, WFC's CEO and President Richard Kovacevich and Vice Chairman Rodney Jacobs. (Px. 44 at 1, 16.) He met with, among others, Kovacevich that day to obtain conceptual approval for the LRT. (Tr. 251.)\n\n92. The LRT was approved, with a few changes, including the decision to use AMFED, an existing non-banking subsidiary from Norwest which Dana subsequently renamed Charter, as the entity that would receive the underwater leases. (Tr. 322; Dx. 285, 318.) Earlier versions of the business purpose document had presumed the creation of a new non-banking subsidiary. (Dx. 142.)\n\n93. WFC executives approved changes to the articles of incorporation of AMFED, changing its name to Charter and designating 20,000 shares of preferred stock as Series A Preferred Stock. AMFED's directors appointed Dana and Mark Ingram, Senior Vice President of CPG, as officers of Charter. (Dx. 327, Tr. 658.)\n\n94. AMFED's Board also approved an Executive Officer Bonus Plan, applicable to Dana and Ingram, setting forth their eligibility for performance-based bonuses based on future calculations of leasing performance in the twenty-one properties. Dana was to receive 6% of the calculated improvements and Ingram 4%. (Dx. 327 at 5-6.) Dana participated in the development and structure of the bonus plan. (See, e.g., Dx. 192.)\n\n95. AMFED filed its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, reflecting the changes, with the Secretary of State for the State of Nevada on December 10, 1998. (Dx. 335.)\n\n96. Of the 20,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Charter sold 16,000 to WFC on December 17, 1998 in exchange for $16,000,000 in government securities. WFC also transferred to Charter government securities with a fair market value of $83,000,000 as a contribution to common capital. (Joint Stip. ¶ 21.)\n\n97. Also on December 17, 1998, pursuant to an exchange agreement among the transferring banks, WFC, and Charter, the transferring banks transferred government securities with an aggregate fair market value of $429,899,099 and a tax basis of $427,849,534, and leasehold interests in the selected leases to Charter in exchange for 4,000 shares of Preferred Stock and Charter's assumption of the lease obligations. (Id. ¶¶ 20, 25.)\n\n98. At the time the transaction was executed, KPMG estimated the present value of the future cash flows associated with the transferred leases to be negative $425,899,099. (Id. ¶ 25.)\n\n99. KPMG, and subsequently a spin off separate entity known as BearingPoint, Inc. (\"BearingPoint\"), determined the lease improvement calculation -- a quantification of the degree to which CPG's performance exceeded that anticipated by the base case scenario -- for every year from 1999 to 2006. (See, e.g., Px. 63.)\n\n100. Following the transfer of real estate assets and government securities to Charter by the transferring banks and WFC in exchange for Preferred Stock, the transferring banks and WFC collectively owned stock possessing at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of Charter stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent of the total number of shares of all other classes of Charter stock. (Id. ¶ 23.)\n\n101. By transferring the leases to Charter, the banks transferred to Charter both assets (i.e. the leasehold interests) and their associated liabilities (i.e. the rent payable under such leases). (Id. ¶ 41; Dx. 355.)\n\n102. By transferring the selected leases to Charter, the transferring banks transferred to Charter the trade or business of managing the selected leases. (Joint Stip. ¶ 42.)\n\n103. Pursuant to a December 17, 1998 service agreement between WFC and Charter, however, WFC (as \"Wells Fargo Bank, National Association\") agreed to provide real estate marketing and management services to Charter in connection with its business of leasing and subleasing the selected leases. (Id. ¶ 43.)\n\n104. The managerial services Wells Fargo agreed to perform on behalf of Charter included: billing and collecting payments from subtenants; making payments to master landlords under the master leases; negotiating or re-negotiating leases and subleases; maintaining the properties; purchasing and paying premiums for insurance; and managing security deposits. (Dx. 357.)\n\n105. The service agreement also enabled Wells Fargo to market vacant space in the leases and to exercise its judgment in obtaining new tenants or subtenants. Any new subleases, however, were to be executed in the name of Charter and subject to approval from Charter's board of directors. (Id.)\n\n106. Pursuant to the service agreement, Charter agreed to pay Wells Fargo a fee of 3% of the gross revenue received from the leases it managed. (Id.)\n\n107. The same CPG lease negotiators who managed the selected leases for the bank prior to the LRT generally continued to manage the properties after Charter's assumption of the leases. (Id.; Tr. 372-75, 382-83.)\n\n108. Dana testified that the service agreement with Charter was not unique; CPG provides real estate services for hundreds of subsidiaries that exist under the WFC umbrella through similar service agreements. (Tr. 70-71, 1110.)\n\n109. For fourteen of the twenty-one properties involved in the LRT, Dana (on behalf of Charter) and Dana and Ingram (on behalf of the bank) signed subleases pursuant to which Charter immediately leased back to WFC the space it had previously occupied; each such sublease bears an effective date of December 17, 1998. (See Dx. 362-76.)\n\n110. To implement the second step of the LRT, on December 17, 1998, the transferring banks sold their 4,000 shares of Charter Preferred Stock to WFC for $4,000,000 in cash. (Joint Stip. ¶ 26.)\n\nVIII. IMPLEMENTING THE LRT: STEP 3\n\n111. The third step of the LRT occurred on February 26, 1999, when WFC sold 4,000 shares of Charter Preferred Stock to Lehman for $3,750,022.22. (Id. ¶ 27.)\n\n112. WFC retained 16,000 shares of Preferred Stock and continues to hold those shares, while 20,000 additional shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding. (Dx. 669 at 6-8.) Accordingly, Lehman owned 20% of the shares and Wells Fargo 80%.\n\n113. Prior to that transaction, and contemporaneous with the first two steps of the LRT, executives of Charter and WFC signed a support agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, WFC agreed to provide sufficient funds to Charter to enable it to pay declared dividends on its Series A Preferred Stock and to ensure that Charter maintained solvency. The agreement also obliged WFC to retain majority ownership of the outstanding common stock of Charter. The agreement was signed by Dana, as executive vice president of Charter, and by Dana's boss Rod Jacobs, on behalf of WFC. (Dx. 356.)\n\n114. WFC represented to KPMG that it had not commenced negotiations with Lehman prior to the execution of the first two steps of the LRT on December 17, 1998. (Dx. 517.) However, WFC had commenced discussions with Lehman regarding the sale of the Preferred Stock much earlier, as evidenced by an October 22, 1998 letter from WFC asking Lehman whether its available documentation was sufficient for a future sale of the Preferred Stock. (Dx. 232.)\n\n115. An internal KPMG email suggest that Vandermark had no plan to sell the Preferred Stock \"any time soon\" after the LRT was conducted. (Dx. 431.) He decided to sell the Preferred Stock \"as quickly as possible[,]\" however, one week after the United States Treasury Secretary announced a proposal to limit taxpayers' ability to structure deals with high-basis, low-value securities. The new rule would not apply retroactively. (Dx. 458; see also Dx. 253, 450 at IRS-056, 452 at IRS-062.)\n\n116. The parties agree that WFC's negotiations with Lehman for the sale of the Preferred Stock were conducted on an arm's length basis, and Lehman paid fair market value to acquire the Preferred Stock. (Joint Stip. ¶¶ 44, 46.)\n\n117. However, the record reflects that Lehman's risk of loss on the Preferred Stock and its financial interest in Charter's success were negligible. Government expert Dr. Douglas Skinner, an accounting professor at the University of Chicago, testified that Lehman's stock in Charter functioned more like a debt instrument than like equity. (Tr. 1351; see generally Dx. 670.)\n\n118. Common stockholders are generally entitled to what Skinner described as a residual claim on the assets of the entity, or a portion of what remains after the entity has satisfied its debts and obligations. Debt holders, by contrast, have a \"fixed claim\" in that they are entitled to a specified, period return, usually in the form of an interest payment. (Tr. 1353-55.) As Skinner explained in his testimony and report, Lehman's Preferred Stock in Charter was more like a debt security, as it had a fixed liquidation value of $1,000 per share regardless of Charter's performance. Lehman was paid fixed, specified dividends on a quarterly basis based on a specified rate of 6.625% premised on the fixed, specified $1,000/share liquidation value of the stock. (Id.)\n\n119. The support agreement between WFC and Charter ensures that WFC would provide Charter sufficient funds to pay dividends on its Preferred Stock. It also requires WFC to continue to own a majority of Charter's outstanding common stock, and to contribute capital to Charter if Charter's net worth falls below one dollar. The support agreement can be terminated only if (a) WFC, Charter, and the holders of 90% of the outstanding Preferred Stock agreed, (b) all shares of the Preferred Stock ceased to be outstanding, or (c) WFC notified Charter that the two main credit ratings agencies advised WFC that the Preferred Stock would be rated at specified rates. (Dx. 356.)\n\n120. Charter has paid a fixed amount dividend on its Preferred Stock in each calendar quarter from February 16, 1999 through the present. (Dx. 669.)\n\nIX. ASSERTED BUSINESS PURPOSE 1: REGULATORY BENEFITS\n\n121. The first non-tax business purpose for the LRT proffered by WFC is the regulatory benefits of moving the selected leases from the regulatory ambit of the OCC, which imposes time sensitive mandatory disposition requirements on certain bank property, to the Fed, which does not.\n\n122. According to Dana, the regulatory issue was \"one of the largest moving factors\" supporting the LRT. (Tr. 172.)\n\n123. The National Bank Act permits a bank to hold real property only for limited purposes, including for use in the bank's business. 12 U.S.C. § 29. A property held by a bank but not used for the bank's business is considered \"Other Real Estate Owned,\" or OREO. 12 C.F.R. § 34.81(3).\n\n124. Pursuant to OCC regulations, \"[a] national bank shall dispose of OREO at the earliest time that prudent judgment dictates, but not later than the end of the holding period (or an extension thereof) permitted by 12 U.S.C. [ § ] 29.\" 12 C.F.R. § 34.82(a). Section 29 provides for a five-year disposition period, subject to an additional five-year extension if \"(1) the [banking] association has made a good faith attempt to dispose of the real estate within the five-year period, or (2) disposal within the five-year period would be detrimental to the [banking] association.\"\n\n125. The OCC five/ten-year disposition regulation extends to leases on former banking premises. (Tr. 796.) Technically, this property is Other Real Estate Leased, or OREL, but it is sometimes referred to as OREO, or simply ORE.2 (Tr. 791-92; 73-74.)\n\n126. In the 1980s and 1990s, Dana -- sometimes in conjunction with other competitor banks -- periodically lobbied the OCC to change its regulations and conform the rules applicable to leased former bank premises to those of the Fed. (Tr. 118-22; Px. 3, 4, 5, 169.)\n\n127. As Neal Petersen, WFC's banking regulation and supervisory practice expert, explained, the Fed does not treat operating leases as assets subject to the ORE mandatory disposition rules as does the OCC. The only guideline prescribed by the Fed is that the property be administered in an economically sensible manner. (Tr. 867-69; see also Dx. 216.)\n\n128. Among the methods of disposing of leased property permitted by the OCC regulations, a bank may assign or sublease the property, through a sublease coterminous with the master lease. 12 C.F.R. § 34.83(a)(3)(i). According to Dana and Jordan Cohen, CPG's chief regulatory attorney, the regulations do not distinguish between an assignment to a related party such as Charter or a third party; both are equally permissible. (Tr. 238-39; 798-99.)\n\n129. Many of WFC's properties are partially occupied by bank functions. There is no clear, bright-line rule promulgated by the OCC to determine when a partially vacated former bank premises constitutes ORE. According to Cohen, different OCC examiners may characterize partially vacated property differently and use varying factors to determine whether a property is ORE. (Tr. 809-10, 818.)\n\n130. Dana testified that in the 1980s, a local OCC examiner informed him that properties with 50% or less bank occupancy were subject to scrutiny as potential ORE. (Tr. 348.) Wachovia Bank, which WFC acquired in 2008, considered only property with 70% bank occupancy as safely constituting bank premises are therefore not ORE. (Tr. 812.) According to Cohen, WFC generally considers property with 60% bank occupancy as not ORE. (Tr. 812-13.) Below 60 or 50% occupancy, WFC would consider various facts and circumstances -- such as whether the building contained prominent Wells Fargo signage -- to decide whether or not it could be characterized as ORE. (Tr. 815-16.) Mark Ingram, however, testified that as of the late 1990s Wells Fargo only needed to occupy 15% of a given space to remove it from the ambit of the ORE disposition rules. (Tr. 700-01.)\n\n131. Cohen, who began work at CPG in 2002, testified that he and several employees are responsible for analyzing whether a WFC property is ORE. This type of work comprises a good portion of Cohen's work responsibilities. (Tr. 800, 809.)\n\n132. The OCC has never disagreed with Cohen's characterization of property, but \"[i]f it's a really close call[,]\" he will directly ask WFC's OCC regulator for guidance. (Tr. 814-15.) The risk of calling the OCC, according to Cohen, is that \"[i]f we call them up and they say, no, it's ORE, all similar situations in the future are also ORE.\" (Tr. 815.)\n\n133. In 1996, the OCC amended 12 C.F.R. § 34.83(a)(3)(i) to toll the statutory ORE disposition period for subleases not coterminous with the master lease held by the bank. It also permits the bank to extend the master lease in certain circumstances. The regulation states:\n\n12 C.F.R. § 34.83(a)(3)(i).\n\n134. The amended regulation refers to \"a sublease\" and \"the sublease\" in the singular. Id. Dana and Cohen testified that they believe the amended regulations permit the extension of leases only for small, single-tenant branches, not large, multi-tenant office buildings such as many of those transferred to Charter. (Tr. 275-76; 815-16.)\n\n135. Violating OCC regulations can result in serious consequences, including public and private reprimands, monetary fines, moratoriums or delays by the OCC in approving new mergers and acquisitions, as well as reputational harm. (Tr. 77-78; 817-18.)\n\n136. Dana testified about how the OCC's regulatory constraints hindered CPG's subleasing capabilities. Specifically, according to Dana, CPG could not offer extension options to prospective subtenants that extended beyond the termination of the master lease when marketing vacant space in properties treated as ORE, because doing so would violate the OCC's mandatory disposition period. (Dx. 225 at 6.) Dana testified that when the lease tail was less than forty-eight months long, the bank often could not attract any new subtenant for the duration of the lease. (Tr. 232-33.)\n\n137. For some of the selected leases, such as that applicable to the Garland building, the ORE disposition period was set to end before the master lease. According to Dana, had the Garland lease stayed with the bank and not been transferred to Charter, CPG would have been obligated to pay $90 million in future rent on the master lease without being able to collect any loss-mitigating sublease rent. (Tr. 268-74.)\n\n138. Dana testified that he had long contemplated moving underwater properties from the First Interstate merger into a non-banking subsidiary for regulatory purposes, but that the idea began to crystallize in the spring of 1998. (Tr. 118.)\n\n139. Dana testified that he considered the underwater leases at risk of being characterized as ORE as ticking \"time bomb[s]\" because every day that passed was one day closer to the mandatory disposition period, after which the company would be in violation of law if it had not properly disposed of the properties. (Tr. 185.)\n\n140. However, WFC produced no contemporaneous documentation from 1998 indicating which of the leased properties it considered ORE or at risk of being categorized as ORE by an OCC regulator, and no evidence of any communication with the OCC from 1998 on the issue of whether certain of the selected leases were ORE.\n\n141. In the course of discovery in this case, WFC asserted that in 1999 it changed the data system in which it tracked which of its properties were considered ORE, and that it had deleted its previous data files and did not have any software system that could produce a list of the properties it considered ORE as of December 17, 1998. (Dx. 674.)\n\n142. At trial, Dana testified that at least seven of the twenty-one selected leases had zero to 10% bank occupancy, meaning that they would almost certainly have been treated as ORE by the OCC: Garland, 830 Nash, First Interstate House, First Interstate World Center (\"FIWC\"), Telesis Tower, Laguna Niguel, and Heitman Centre. (Tr. 173, 179, 181-83, 188, 357, 348.)\n\n143. In his deposition, Dana identified at least ten of the twenty-one selected leases that he believed WFC did not consider ORE prior to their transfer to Charter: 2120 Park, National City, Seattle Tower, 401-B-San Diego, Koll-Main, Koll-Birch, Las Vegas Tower, Boise Main, 801 Travis, and Louisiana Street. (Dx. 706 at 263-65; see also Tr. 188 (explaining that he confused Telesis Tower with Louisiana Street in his deposition), 355 (same), 188-89 (explaining that his deposition testimony that the Post Oak property was not ORE was in error, as Post Oak was approximately 40% bank occupied and thus at high risk of being categorized as ORE in his view).)\n\n144. At trial, however, Dana testified that, although he compiled the list of twenty-one selected leases, and although ORE status was the primary factor he used in developing the list, he did not consult any kind of list that WFC might have maintained regarding ORE classifications in 1998. (Tr. 342; 354.)\n\n145. At trial, approximately two years after his deposition, Dana re-characterized many of the properties he had previously identified as not considered ORE by WFC in 1998. With regard to 2120 Park, for example, Dana testified in his deposition, \"I believe that 2120 Park was not ORE.\" (Dx. 706 at 264.) He was responding to the question, \"[D]o you know if, prior to December of 1998, Wells Fargo had categorized all of these 21 properties as being ORE? . . . Do you know which ones were not?\" (Id. at 263.) At trial, Dana testified, \"I do not know whether that was on ORE list in 1998. If you were to ask me today was that a property that would have been a risk, I would have said yes, that is an ORE risk.\" (Tr. 346.) Dana could not identify a point at which he would consider a property at \"risk\" of ORE categorization. (Tr. 347.) The bank occupied approximately 27% of 2120 Park. (Dx. 373 at A-1, B-1.)\n\n146. With regard to National City, Dana testified in his deposition, \"National City, that was not ORE\" in 1998. (Dx. 706 at 264.) At trial, however, Dana stated that he did not know whether the bank would have characterized National City as not ORE in 1998, but that he believed the property was at risk of being so categorized by the OCC. Dana testified that he could have reasonably argued that National City was not ORE because, although the bank occupied a small percentage of the building, its occupancy was an important use (a cash vault). Dana testified that ultimately, the designation would be left to the OCC examiner's discretion. (Tr. 349-50.)\n\n147. With regard to Seattle Tower, Dana testified in his deposition, \"First Interstate Tower, in Seattle, that was not ORE.\" (Dx. 706 at 264.) At trial, the following exchange occurred:\n\n(Tr. 354-55 (emphasis added).) The bank occupied approximately 50% of Seattle Tower. (Dx. 371 at A-1, B-1.)\n\n148. WFC did produce a list from mid-1999, which reflects at least dozens of properties WFC classified as ORE that were not included in the LRT. (Dx. 669 at 18; Dx. 674 at 6; Dx. 676; Dx. 680.)\n\n149. Several of the selected leases that were included related to properties in which the bank occupied well over 50% of the space, and sometimes nearly all of the space. (Dx. 671 at 11-12; Ex. 2.)\n\n150. An internal email between two WFC employees in CPG dated December 11, 2000 suggests that only three of the selected leases transferred to Charter were considered ORE. (Dx. 539.)\n\n151. Several of the selected leases were subject to master leases that expired before the ten-year OCC disposition period. (Dx. 671, Ex. 1.)\n\nX. ASSERTED BUSINESS PURPOSE 2: \"GOOD BANK CUSTOMERS\"\n\n152. WFC's second asserted non-tax business purpose for the LRT is that transferring the selected leases to Charter enabled CPG \"to act more like a real estate company and less like a financial institution.\" (Dx. 188.) By operating under the auspices of Charter, which was beholden to its own stockholders including outside parties, WFC argues that CPG lease negotiators were able to avoid less favorable real estate deals obtained by entities leveraging their banking relationship with WFC.\n\n153. Dana explained the \"good bank customers\" purpose by comparing the LRT to his work on the Sacramento project. (Tr. 125-26.) With the Sacramento project, under Dana's direction, CPG found a co-joint venturer -- a firm named William Wilson & Associates (\"Wilson\") -- to invest in the construction of a new building; CPG then leased out the building to tenants in the financial district in the area. (Tr. 550.) Dana testified that by operating as a joint venture with outside investors under the name Crocker Properties (\"Crocker\"), CPG was able to avoid offering disadvantageous lease terms based on tenants' banking relationship with WFC:\n\nWhen they [prospective tenants] came to us and said they wanted special deals, we were able to say, you know, we really can't. This is held under a separate entity. It has a separate name, and it has separate investors, so we can't give you a special deal because it would be a conflict of interest. . . . It worked beautifully. . . .\n\n(Tr. 126.)\n\n154. For example, under Dana's supervision, Old Wells Fargo employee Robert Paratte established a selection process for obtaining the most qualified and financially stable general contractor for the Sacramento project, an approximately $100 million project. (Tr. 551, 554.) Several of Old Wells Fargo's good bank customers solicited the bank to hire them as the project's general contractor by pressuring their lending contacts, who then implored Paratte to give the customers preferential treatment in the selection process. Paratte staved off the pressure by explaining that he was obliged to protect the interests of Crocker and Crocker's joint venturer Wilson. (Tr. 552-55.)\n\n155. In another example of how he used Crocker to diffuse tension relating to the Sacramento project with good bank customers, Paratte testified about how a national union -- a good bank customer -- picketed and campaigned against the Sacramento project, accusing the bank of using a nonunion electrical subcontractor. (Tr. 558-60; Px. 168.) Paratte spoke with the local union head and \"explained the nature of the venture,\" that all transactions with vendors and subcontractors were conducted at an arm's length \"and that other bank customers had also been turned away from doing work in the project, that they shouldn't feel picked upon, and certainly this wasn't something that Wells Fargo had done. This was something decided within Crocker Properties and William Wilson & Associates.\" (Tr. 561-62.) Within a day of the meeting, the union stopped picketing the building site. (Tr. 562.)\n\n156. In connection with the Sacramento project, Paratte used Crocker business cards, which identified him as a Vice President of Crocker rather than a bank employee. (Tr. 561, 578.)\n\n157. Wilson issued a capital contribution before the building was built. Both Crocker and Wilson were mentioned in the building's marketing materials, and Paratte knew of no examples of subleases relating to the project which mistakenly identified the bank, instead of Crocker, as the landlord. (Tr. 573-75.)\n\n158. As Paratte testified, Wilson invested significant capital into the venture, \"so we were truly partners in that particular entity.\" Wilson also brought in other investors. (Tr. 550.) While Wilson and the other outside investors did not have \"an active role in the development process[,]\" Old Wells Fargo did consult with Wilson, for example, by providing him a list of prospective contractors. Wilson also attended meetings with Paratte regarding the project. (Tr. 550-51, 573; Px. 167.)\n\n159. WFC's CEO Kovacevich also testified regarding the value of distinguishing the name of an affiliate, particularly one owned partially by an outside investor, from WFC in other contexts. (Tr. 319-20.)\n\n160. Early consideration of transferring underwater leases into a non-banking subsidiary seem to reflect the possibility of the same advantages recognized by the Sacramento project's structure. By May 1998, Dana had received information regarding the benefits and disadvantages of establishing a separate subsidiary to dispose of superfluous property. The first listed benefit was \"[m]arketing advantages by differentiating a subsidiary's business from traditional banking through the use off the a name [sic] distinct from Wells Fargo Bank or Wells Fargo & Company.\" (Px. 14, 17; Tr. 139.) The other \"pros\" included the ability to name a board of directors and officers different from those of the bank who have expertise in a specific business, possible state income tax benefits, containment of risks and losses arising from a subsidiary's operations within the subsidiary, and the \"[a]bility to engage in activities that must be conducted in an [sic] unique subsidiary for regulatory reasons (e.g., securities underwriting).\" (Dx. 14.)\n\n161. Dana testified that he hoped to use Charter to the same advantage obtained through his use of Crocker with the Sacramento project. (Tr. 139.)\n\n162. While regulatory concerns were allegedly the primary non-tax business purpose driving the LRT, Dana testified that not every one of the selected leases had to be subject to regulatory concerns to be included in the LRT; even if not at risk of being categorized as ORE, a property might still benefit from the Sacramento project's inoculation against pressure from good bank customers. (Tr. 172-73, 412 (describing the use of Charter as \"immunization in case the good bank customer issue c[ame] up\").)\n\n163. Contemporaneous documentation from 1998 indicates that WFC considered that twelve of the selected leases, including some that WFC considered ORE, were leased from landlords or subleased to tenants who also had significant banking relationships with WFC: Garland, Koll-Main, Koll-Birch, 830 Nash, 2120 Park, FIWC, Seattle Tower, Telesis Tower, Esperson, Las Vegas Tower, Louisiana Street, and Laguna Niguel. (Px. 38 at Ex. 11.)\n\n164. Dana sent an internal email to WFC employees on April 14, 1999 requesting that he and Ingram be elected officers of Charter so that they could sign Charter subleases. (Dx. 471.) Pursuant to the series of resolutions adopted by AMFED, however, Dana and Ingram became officers of AMFED (later Charter) in December 1998. By the time Dana sent the April 14, 1999 email, numerous subleases for space in the selected leases had already been signed.\n\n165. Although the lease negotiators managing the selected leases were the same individuals before the LRT as after the transfer of the leases to Charter, and Ingram testified that staff was informed about Charter's legal structure in late 1998 and early 1999, the record contains no documentation of any written notice to the lease negotiators on the effect of the transfer until June 30, 1999. (Tr. 372-75, 382-83, 697; Dx. 487.)\n\n166. That June 30, 1999 notice states that \"[o]ther than Charter becoming the sublessor under the existing third-party subleases, the transaction has had no effect on those subleases. Accordingly, no notices of the transfer will be sent to subtenants.\" The notice does not instruct the lease negotiators with regard to how to use the assignment of the leases to Charter to advantage the negotiators in their negotiations with subtenants. (Dx. 487 (emphasis added).)\n\n167. Even after the negotiators received the June 1999 notice, however, they still sometimes signed subleases and other documents relating to space in the selected leases -- including those specifically identified as having \"good bank customer\" issues -- that identified Wells Fargo Bank, not Charter, as the sublessor. Many of these documents were signed by Wells Fargo vice presidents. (See, e.g., Dx. 494, 609; Tr. 489.)\n\n168. For example, in May 1999, CPG decided to reduce the space it leased in Seattle Tower from 177,527 to 89,637 square feet, the latter quantity being the amount occupied by the bank. (Dx. 476.) Both the internal memorandum discussing the transaction, as well as the two contracts effectuating it -- a new lease for the desired amount of space and a space reduction amendment to the original lease eliminating obligations regarding the undesired space -- identify the tenant as Wells Fargo Bank and exclude all reference to Charter. (Id.; Dx. 473, 474.) Numerous other documents relating to Seattle Tower and executed after the LRT, including a subsequent master lease amendment, a license agreement, and several subleases, similarly refer to Wells Fargo Bank as the tenant on the master lease. (Dx. 531, 535, 536, 561.)\n\n169. Although Dana was told contemporaneously about the Seattle Tower master lease modification and although he received and cosigned a memorandum from a CPG employee seeking approval to execute the modification documents in the bank's name, there is no indication that Dana expressed concern that Charter held the leasehold. (Dx. 476.) Dana acknowledged that the (prior) ownership and management of Seattle Tower were considered good bank customers. (Px. 38 at Ex. 11; Tr. 450.) Dana testified that he believes he nonetheless could have used Charter's fiduciary duty to the outside investor \"in a reactive sense, . . . if this had come up in this transaction. . . .\" (Tr. 450.)\n\n170. Post-LRT documents relating to the Louisiana Street property, including a lease amendment from 2000 signed by Ingram expanding the amount of space covered by the master lease, also ignore the LRT's transference of the master lease to Charter. (See, e.g., Dx. 529, 562, 564.) Only in 2005, after Dana knew that the IRS was reviewing the LRT, did the eighth Louisiana Street lease amendment properly identify Charter as the tenant on the master lease. This amendment was signed by Dana himself. (Dx. 610, 576 (email from Dana indicating his awareness of the IRS audit and noting that \"if we win against the IRS, or even settle, it's a lot of money directly to the bottom line[;] [p]ersonally, I feel that the business case is strong, and I'm prepared to defend it vigorously in any administrative or judicial process.\").)\n\n171. Upon receiving the Louisiana Street leasehold, Charter immediately subleased 97% of the space back to the bank, which was occupying the space and had no intention of leaving it. (Dx. 368.) The sublease expired on December 21, 2002, yet the bank continued to occupy the space in what was, pursuant to the sublease, a tenancy at sufferance. (Id. at 5.) In 2006, years after the expiration of the sublease, Ingram and Dana signed on behalf of Charter a \"First Amendment to Sublease\" providing for a new expiration date of December 21, 2012 and an effective date of January 1, 2003. (Dx. 633.) While Dana stated that the amendment was drafted by \"very expensive and high profile counsel[,]\" he did not know whether the bank paid Charter rent for the three-year period during which it was a tenant at sufferance. (Tr. 469-70.) Ingram also did not know whether Charter received rent from the bank during that period. (Tr. 730.)\n\n172. In response to the question of whether the Louisiana Street property is held today by the bank or by Charter, Dana, a Charter officer, testified:\n\nWell, it should be held by Wells Fargo Bank. I'm sure you're going to tell me it's not, but I'm sure, you know, my understanding is it should be held by Wells Fargo Bank because I don't think Charter would have had an interest in holding onto the space, but these things are complicated. I don't know what counsel would have drafted up.\n\n(Tr. 466.)\n\n173. Even when subleases identified Charter as the sublessor, at times they identified Charter as a \"wholly owned subsidiary\" of Wells Fargo Bank. (See, e.g., Dx. 581 at 1, 692 at 15.)\n\n174. The bank did send some notices to master lease landlords informing them of the assignment of the selected leases to Charter. (See, e.g., Px. 249-51.)\n\n175. Dana acknowledged the existence of post-LRT documents misidentifying Wells Fargo Bank as the tenant in numerous selected leases. He testified, however, that these were relatively infrequent mistakes; Dana estimated that a few dozen out of hundreds of documents contained such errors. (Tr. 1127-30.)\n\n176. Ingram cited CPG's experience with a particular sublease at 830 Nash as an example of how the LRT immunized CPG from having to agree to disadvantageous real estate deals with good bank customers. 830 Nash was owned by Continental Development Corporation (\"CDC\"), which is wholly owned by Richard Lundquist, a developer in southern California. WFC considered both CDC and Lundquist good bank customers. (Tr. 660; Px. 38 at Ex. 11.)\n\n177. Towards the \"start of the Charter period[,]\" a start-up company called Globix Corporation (\"Globix\") approached the bank and Lundquist about subleasing space at 830 Nash. The building had a large quantity of vacant space, and Lundquist wanted to fill it to \"get some traction going in the area[,]\" where he also owned several other buildings. CPG's lease negotiators, however, did not believe that Globix was creditworthy. Accordingly, they declined to sublease the space to Globix. Ingram testified that CPG was able to use its fiduciary obligations to Charter's investors to prevent Lundquist from leveraging his banking relationship with WFC to compel CPG to sublease space to Globix. Instead, CDC itself subleased space back from Charter, and then CDC sub-subleased the space to Globix. Subsequently, when Globix defaulted on its sub-sublease with CDC and entered bankruptcy, CDC was nonetheless obliged to pay Charter over $6 million pursuant to its sublease with Charter. (Tr. 661-66.)\n\n178. When asked if Ingram would have responded to Lundquist's request in the same way had the property not been in Charter, however, Ingram responded:\n\n[P]robably I would have, but what is very likely that would have happened there is that Mr. Lundquist, like many bank good customers, would have gone to his line of business within the bank, and they would have become a party to the discussion. . . . That obviously didn't happen here.\n\n(Tr. 665-66 (emphasis added).)\n\n179. As another example of how the LRT allegedly immunized CPG from pressure from good bank customers, Ingram testified about the Koll Center. According to Ingram, the master landlord of the Koll Center, Cornerstone Properties, was a good bank customer, although it was not listed as such on the \"partial list\" of good bank customers prepared in conjunction with the business purpose document in 1998. (Tr. 666; Px. 38 at Ex. 11.) Following the LRT, CPG exercised its termination right with regard to part of the leased space. Ingram testified that if not for Charter, CPG \"would have had a lot of push back\" from other divisions of WFC with whom Cornerstone had significant business. (Tr. 667-68.)\n\n180. As an example undermining WFC's contention that the LRT financially benefited the company, the government cited Laguna Niguel, a property in a suburban shopping center anchored by a supermarket. (Dx. 485.) The master lease for Laguna Niguel prohibited the bank's leased space from being used for purposes other than financial services, and in particular prohibited its use for purposes that would compete with businesses that were already operating in the shopping center. (Dx. 25 at Add. 1; Dx. 480 (referencing a \"financial use only clause\").) WFC operated a bank branch in the Laguna Niguel property until April 1997, when it closed the branch. (Tr. 426; Dx. 480.)\n\n181. The Laguna Niguel lease was transferred to Charter as part of the LRT. As a result of the service agreement, the same CPG employees who managed the Laguna Niguel property before the LRT continued to manage it after the LRT. (Dx. 672 at 35.)\n\n182. Around May 1999, Washington Mutual Bank (\"Washington Mutual\") proposed to sublease the entire leased space as a home mortgage center. A CPG employee described Washington Mutual's proposal as \"really a good one, basically full market value.\" (Dx. 480.) In evaluating whether to enter into a sublease with Washington Mutual for the Laguna Niguel space, CPG employees consulted with members of the WFC's retail banking operations to ascertain any opposition. The retail banking operations employees opposed subleasing former WFC space to a competitor, however, and the deal with Washington Mutual fell through. (Dx. 480, 483, 485.) Two other attempts to sublet the space in 1999 were unsuccessful. (Dx. 489, 497.)\n\n183. Dana testified that he understood that there was an agreement between the bank and Charter to limit any subleases to office space, and that the Washington Mutual deal would have constituted a variance from that understanding. (Tr. 428; Px. 78 (1998 letter from Cushman reflecting that CPG wanted an opinion of Laguna Niguel that takes into account \"general market conditions and all relevant factors that a general office tenant would normally be expected to consider in deciding what it would be willing to pay to sublease the space in question. . . .\".) WFC cited no written evidence of such an agreement between Charter and the bank, however, and the internal emails among CPG employees regarding the prospective transaction with Washington Mutual do not reference any reason to decline the offer other than Washington Mutual's status as a competitor.\n\n184. Ultimately, CPG exercised its right to terminate the master lease, effective March 1, 2001, for a fee. (Dx. 534.) Although Dana testified that Laguna Niguel was selected for transfer into Charter in part because of a good bank customer issue, the notice informing the master landlord of the termination, like a letter of intent which did not result in a sublease, misidentified the lessor as Wells Fargo Bank and did not mention Charter's interest in the master lease. (Id.; Dx. 497; Tr. 1095.) The termination option could have been exercised even if the property had not been transferred to Charter. (Tr. 1095.)\n\n185. Internal emails among CPG employees indicate that they viewed a functioning Wells Fargo automatic teller machine (\"ATM\") at Laguna Niguel as high traffic. When CPG decided to exercise the termination option, they struggled to find an adequate new location for the ATM; several employees even suggested reopening the Laguna Niguel location. (See, e.g., Dx. 480 (\"I am not even sure it was a good decision to leave in the first place. . . .\"), 483 (\"[T]his leave behind location is a valuable site\" because of the ATM), 511, 519, 526 (\"Do you think we should consider reopening?\").) Wells Fargo Bank and the master landlord eventually signed an ATM License Agreement to allow for the continued use of the Laguna Niguel ATM following the early termination of the sublease in exchange for monthly rent of $2,000. (Dx. 558.) However, there is no record evidence of any comparable written contract between the bank and Charter for the use of the ATM between December 17, 1998, when it was transferred to Charter, and March 1, 2001, when the sublease ended.\n\nXI. ASSERTED BUSINESS PURPOSE 3: CENTRALIZATION/MANAGEMENTEFFICIENCIES\n\n186. WFC's third asserted non-tax business purpose for conducting the LRT involves management efficiencies allegedly obtained through the transfer of the leases to Charter.\n\n187. Dana's earliest business purpose document discussed the benefit accorded by centralization of focus and attention on problematic leases, and incentivizing key managers. (Dx. 142.) At trial, however, Dana discussed the LRT's benefit in facilitating a management efficiency emerging from the Norwest merger.\n\n188. After the Norwest merger was announced in June 1998 and it was determined that Kovacevich -- formerly of Norwest -- would head the merged companies, Dana was required to interview for his job. He learned he would be retained as head of CPG around the end of July 1998. (Tr. 142, 144.)\n\n189. In the course of Dana's interview with Kovacevich, he learned that Kovacevich expected the management of the company's real estate portfolio to change. Specifically, as Dana testified:\n\nWells Fargo, prior to the acquisition by Norwest, was a highly centralized company meaning that the decisions were made by a small number of officers at the very top. The Norwest business model was highly decentralized and decisions were made in literally, you know, hundreds and hundreds of business units. . . . [W]hat it would mean [for CPG] is I would have to take the properties that were currently under the management of Wells Fargo under a centralized model and essentially send it out to these business units which means essentially they would have to approve any checks or any real big decisions made on those properties.\n\n(Tr. 146-47.)\n\n190. As an example of how transferring the selected leases to Charter alleviated this internal bureaucratic entanglement, WFC highlighted a selected lease in Los Angeles, the FIWC. According to Dana, FIWC was one of the most problematic underwater leases; following the First Interstate merger, thirteen business units that had previously occupied FIWC vacated the building. (Tr. 182-83; Px. 10.) Not only was the property \"absolutely ORE[,]\" it was also \"replete with good bank customers.\" (Tr. 183.) By fall 1998, WFC's only operations in FIWC were the operation of three ATMs; 136,122 of the 162,828 square feet leased by the bank was leased to existing third-party subtenants. (Dx. 395.) In addition, Dana testified that although the business units no longer occupied the space, \"[u]nder [Norwest's] decentralized plan, [he] would still have to get their sign-off before [he] could make a decision relating to this property if it affected their floors.\" (Tr. 197.) Dana testified that he would not have been required to obtain a multitude of signatures prior to the Norwest merger. (Tr. 198.) According to Dana, he could avoid the requirements of Norwest's decentralized system with regard to real estate disposition by transferring the lease to Charter. (Tr. 195.)\n\n191. As with the ATM the bank operated at the Laguna Niguel property, the bank did not enter into a written lease with Charter despite continuing to use space in FIWC for three ATMs after the LRT. Instead, Wells Fargo Bank entered into a Third Amendment to the master lease, dated July 12, 2000, pursuant to which the parties agreed to terms regarding space rental for the ATMs. (Dx. 21 at 8.3) The amendment does not acknowledge Charter's interest in the master lease and misidentifies the bank as the tenant.\n\n192. Numerous other post-LRT documents generated by CPG relating to FIWC similarly misidentify the bank as the tenant on the master lease. For example, an amendment to a sublease agreement with Steptoe & Johnson LLP (\"Steptoe\") dated March 8, 2005, lists Wells Fargo Bank as the tenant and excludes any mention of Charter. (Dx. 609.) According to Dana, Steptoe was a good bank customer. (Tr. 489.)\n\n193. A sublease dated May 7, 2003 with City National Bank for space in FIWC likewise identifies Wells Fargo Bank as the sublandlord and excludes reference to Charter. (Dx. 588.)\n\n194. Dana testified that while he chose most of the selected leases on the bases of regulatory concerns and good bank customer concerns, there were a few properties that he included in the LRT but which did not raise either issue. He included those properties \"pretty much based upon my concerns about the approval process and centralizing the approval process.\" (Tr. 185.)\n\n195. According to Dana, he is not sure if he would have proceeded with the LRT if the only non-tax business reason to execute it was the benefit of centralized management; rather, this third justification was a \"pile on reason. . . .\" (Tr. 186.)\n\n196. As an example of how centralization facilitated cost savings, Ingram cited First Interstate House, a selected lease in London. GE Capital had tentatively agreed to take over WFC's entire lease obligation on the property, with the condition that WFC pay it $1.3 million as a concession. The master landlord also insisted that WFC remain a guarantor on GE Capital's obligation. (Tr. 671.)\n\n197. When asked what about that arrangement he could attribute to the LRT, Ingram testified:\n\nWell, from my standpoint, one of the great benefits of Charter was to be able to simply make decisions on transactions, and I guess what I would say a little bit of a quick, centralized manner where we were able to simply go back to the bank lines of business that were affected and indicate that this was something that needed to be done. It was such a valuable deal for Charter, whereas if Charter hadn't existed, let's put it this way, we would have gotten a significant amount of push back [from the lines of business whose budgets would have been affected], just as Wells Fargo corporate properties, for the expenditure of the 1.3 million.\n\n(Tr. 672-73.)\n\n198. Dana's business purpose document also initially cited the benefit of incentivizing key managers to beat market expectations with regard to the underwater leases. Dr. Oliver Hart, a Harvard economics professor and government expert, testified that WFC could have implemented the executive bonus plan contract at a lower cost without the LRT structure. (Dx. 672 at ¶¶ 56-59; Tr. 1227-33.)\n\n199. According to Hart, the managerial efficiencies typically associated with transferring certain business functions to a subsidiary involve managers obtaining more control over those functions and/or outside investors contributing valuable experience or specialized expertise. Early consideration of transference of underwater leases, and Dana's earliest business purpose documents comparing the LRT to the Sacramento project, reflected the potential of these advantages. (Px. 14 (identifying the \"[a]bility to name a board of directors and officers who are experts in a specific business and who differ from the Bank's Board and officers\" as a \"pro\" of using a separate subsidiary); Dx. 142.) In the case of Charter, however, control did not shift to Dana and Ingram (the incentivized executives), who already controlled the selected leases prior to the LRT. Moreover, Lehman (the outside investor) did not contribute any expertise to the enterprise. (Dx. 672 at ¶¶ 60-63.)\n\n200. The lease improvement calculations provided by KPMG and later BearingPoint determined Dana and Ingram's bonuses. As of December 31, 2006, the lease improvement calculations reflected that the present value of the losses related to the selected leases were reduced from the $425,899,099 anticipated in the base case to less than $360 million, an improvement of approximately $67.8 million. (Px. 63 at 2.)\n\n201. According to WFC's expert Greg Gotthardt, at least $26 million of the reduction in the selected leases' liabilities is reasonably attributable to one or more of the benefits allegedly obtained through the LRT; in his view, the transaction generated at least as many benefits as the \"what if\" scenarios anticipated. (Tr. 1002-04.)\n\n202. Pursuant to the bonus plan and based on KPMG and BearingPoint's quantification of how much better the selected leases fared through the transfer to Charter than they otherwise would have, Dana received a bonus of $3.4 million and Ingram a bonus of approximately $2.3 million. (Tr. 262.)\n\nXII. THE GARLAND BUILDING\n\n203. The Court will now focus -- as did WFC at trial -- on the changes and leasing activity in the largest selected lease, Garland, following the LRT. Garland had previously served as an administrative and operations center for First Interstate. (Px. 56; Tr. 173, 282, 676.) Following Old Wells Fargo's acquisition of First Interstate and the consolidation of the companies' operations, Old Wells Fargo vacated the facility completely. (Tr. 173.)\n\n204. Dana described Garland as \"the key poster child for something that should go into Charter.\" (Tr. 173.) It was ORE, with zero bank occupancy, and two of its subtenants -- Regulus and Prudential -- were \"good bank customers.\" (Px. 38 at Ex. 11.)\n\n205. In some ways, Garland was a very difficult property to sublease. In 1998, according to Dana, it was located in a crime-ridden part of downtown Los Angeles \"on the wrong side of the tracks\" surrounded by vacant lots. Several hundred thousand feet of the property were underground, unsuitable for general office space. (Tr. 282.) On the other hand, Garland's uniqueness was also potentially lucrative. It was designed as a \"virtual fortress\" with a helicopter pad and redundant power feeds, capable of sustaining itself for thirty days. (Tr. 281.) Garland's unusually robust electrical capabilities and other features make it particularly well-suited to address the burgeoning need for secure electronic data storage. (Tr. 283-84.)\n\n206. From the master lease's commencement in 1984, annual rents on Garland escalated from approximately $5.8 million to approximately $29 million for the last year of the initial term ending in February 2009. (Tr. 584.) However, after the initial term, the annual master lease rent during each of six five-year lease extension periods was fixed at approximately $13.4 million through the year 2039. (Tr. 584, 267.) The rent drop, in Dana's view, presented \"tremendous opportunity to turn that property from a money loser to a real gold mine. . . .\" (Tr. 267.) The OCC's five-year disposition period for Garland ended in 2001, while an additional five year extension would have ended in 2006. (Tr. 269-70.) Dana testified that, had Garland stayed under the purview of the bank instead of Charter, CPG would have had to dispose of the property pursuant to OCC regulations and miss the opportunity to capitalize on the prospective rent reduction. (Tr. 268.)\n\n207. As evidence of how the OCC mandatory disposition period hindered CPG's ability to market the Garland lease tail and extension options, Dana cited a potential $14 million sublease at Garland that Bank of America walked away from because it could not justify expending resources on necessary improvements to the cash vault without the possibility that it could remain in the space past the expiration of Wells Fargo's master lease and disposition period. (Dx. 225 at WFC-37-0254; Tr. 110-11.)\n\n208. After the LRT, CPG recommenced negotiations with Bank of America on behalf of Charter and successfully executed a sublease. That sublease, however, contained a provision in which Charter explicitly disclaimed any obligation to exercise its extension option beyond the master lease's expiration date in 2009. (Px. 96 at 65.) According to Dana, CPG did not need to include a sublease extension guarantee because at that point, one year after their initial negotiations, Bank of America was \"desperate\" for cash vault space and CPG had therefore gained substantial leverage in the negotiations. Dana testified that he gave Bank of America \"considerable comfort\" that it would be able to extend the sublease through a verbal \"gentlemen's agreement\" with Bank of America's real estate head. (Tr. 1118.)\n\n209. WFC also cited a sublease with the City of Los Angeles as an example of how Charter generated savings by executing subleases during the final forty-eight months of the master lease. Such subleases, according to WFC, would not likely have been possible absent the flexibility to exercise the lease extension option provided by the LRT. (Tr. 232-33.) The Garland sublease with the City of Los Angeles, however, commencing on October 1, 2007, had a term of only seventeen months; it expired before the master lease. (Px. 121.) WFC cited no record evidence of any \"gentlemen's agreement\" with the City regarding the likelihood of an extension.\n\n210. Ingram testified about using Charter to immunize CPG from pressure from good bank customers in relation to Garland. As an example, Ingram cited Aetna, a good bank customer subleasing space in the building. In 2001, Aetna attempted to exercise its right to contract, or reduce, its subleased space thirteen days after the deadline for asserting such a right expired under the terms of the sublease. CPG denied Aetna's request, and Charter continued to receive approximately $360,000 in annual rent from the contraction space until 2007. Ingram testified that but for the LRT, he likely would have considered Aetna's relationship with WFB and honored Aetna's contraction request; because of the LRT, he instead informed Aetna that Charter could not accept an untimely contraction because it owed a duty to maximize its third-party investor's interest. (Px. 116; Tr. 676-80.)\n\n211. The letter in which CPG rejected Aetna's request, however, is on Wells Fargo letterhead, and it does not reference Charter's fiduciary duty to any outside investor. Moreover, Ingram testified that had the bank retained possession of the lease and not transferred it to Charter, \"I would have started off with the same position which is that you, you know, you blew a deadline, and so we're not going to contract the space.\" Anticipating pressure from other WFC business lines, Ingram testified that \"it's not inconceivable to certainly think that an accommodation would have been made.\" (Px. 116; Tr. 680.)\n\n212. According to Ingram, another good bank customer and Garland sublessee, SBC Verizon, challenged its payment of approximately $150,000 in back rent over a dispute relating to power usage. SBC Verizon directly contacted an individual high in WFC's hierarchy seeking an accommodation. Ingram testified that after he explained the limitations imposed by Charter's fiduciary duty to the WFC executive, she relayed that explanation to SBC Verizon, which subsequently paid the past due rent. (Tr. 681-83.)\n\n213. The government, however, provided numerous examples of Garland subleases misidentifying Wells Fargo Bank as the tenant on the master lease and omitting any reference to Charter. (See, e.g., Dx. 466, 475, 479, 541.)\n\n214. WFC has exercised subsequent lease extension options at Garland, taking advantage of the master lease rent reduction and capitalizing on Garland's unique capabilities and increased interest in technical equipment storage. (Tr. 283-84, 591.) In 2007, WFC invested $34 million to upgrade Garland's electrical infrastructure. (Tr. 603.) Garland subleases have subsequently generated millions of dollars in profit. (Tr. 587-88, 629-30.)\n\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\nTo determine whether WFC is entitled to the deduction it seeks, the Court must decide two legal questions: (1) whether the LRT, on its surface, complied with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, and (2) even if it technically comports with statutory requirements, whether the LRT was nonetheless a tax shelter devoid of non-tax business purposes or economic substance under the common law \"sham transaction\" doctrine.\n\nI. STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe government challenges WFC's deduction on two statutory grounds: 26 U.S.C. § 357(b), and 26 U.S.C. § 351. Generally, the sale or exchange of property is a \"recognition\" event requiring a taxpayer to recognize any gain or loss on the property. 26 U.S.C. § 1001(c). Section 351(a), however, provides that \"no gain or loss shall be recognized if property is transferred to a corporation by one or more persons solely in exchange for stock in such corporation and immediately after the exchange such person or persons are in control . . . of the corporation.\" The taxpayer's basis in the received stock is usually the same as its basis in the transferred property, such that the taxpayer will recognize any unrecognized gain or loss the taxpayer had in the transferred property prior to the transaction later, when it sells the stock. If, in addition to receiving transferred property, the transferee corporation also assumes liabilities of the taxpayer, then the taxpayer's basis in the received stock is reduced by the amount of the liabilities assumed by the transferee pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 358, which governs the basis calculation in a § 351 exchange. 26 U.S.C. §§ 358(d)(1); 358(a)(1)(A)(ii). However, where the assumed liabilities would have given rise to a deduction by the taxpayer but for its assumption by the transferee corporation, the taxpayer's basis in the transferee's stock is not reduced by the amount of the liabilities. Id. §§ 358(d)(2); 357(c)(3).\n\nThe government insists that § 357(b) precludes a refund in these circumstances. Section 357(b) provides that if the taxpayer's purpose for the assumption of the liabilities (i) was to avoid federal income tax on the exchange or (ii) was not a bona fide business purpose, then the assumption of liability shall, for purposes of § 351, be considered \"money received\" by the taxpayer on the exchange. According to the government, § 357(b) means that the amount of the liabilities is subtracted from the taxpayer's basis. As discussed below, the Court concludes that WFC has not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that it executed the LRT for any reason other than avoidance of federal income tax. If the Court applies § 357(b) to the LRT, then the total amount of the liabilities assumed by Charter ($425,899,099) would be subtracted from the transferring banks' basis in the government securities ($427,849,535) to arrive at the transferring banks' basis in the Charter Preferred Stock ($1,950,436). Under this logic, when the transferring banks sold the Preferred Stock to Wells Fargo for $4,000,000 they realized a capital gain instead of a capital loss, which means that WFC is not entitled to a capital loss deduction or tax refund.\n\nAs the government has acknowledged, however, two appellate courts have squarely rejected its interpretation of § 357(b) and concluded that the section applies only to determine whether gain is recognized in a § 351 exchange, not to calculate the basis of stock received in such an exchange. See Coltec Indus., Inc. v. United States, 454 F.3d 1340, 1348-52 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Black & Decker Corp. v. United States, 436 F.3d 431, 438-40 (4th Cir. 2006). Specifically, both courts recognized \"the absence of any reference to § 358 [the basis calculation provision] on the face of § 357(b).\" Black & Decker, 436 F.3d at 438; Coltec, 454 F.3d at 1350-51. As the Fourth Circuit explained:\n\n[Section] 357(b)(1) refers (as pertinent here) only to the \"purposes\" of § 351, which are the purposes of gain or loss recognition, as indicated by the opening words of § 351(a) (\"No gain or loss shall be recognized . . .\"). Those purposes are distinct from the purposes of § 358, which concerns the computation of basis. Section 351(h) certainly refers to § 358, but this reference has no substantive content; rather, it simply guides the reader of § 351 to the basis computation rule for exchanges that qualify for § 351's tax-free treatment.\n\nBlack & Decker, 436 F.3d at 438. The Court agrees and concludes that § 357(b) does not operate to reduce WFC's basis.\n\nThe government's second statutory challenge is that § 351 itself precludes a refund because only part of the exchange qualifies under § 351. The government divides the transfer into two parts: (1) the transferring banks' transfer of $425,899,099 worth of government securities to Charter in exchange for Charter's assumption of lease liabilities with a projected value of negative $425,899,099, and (2) the transferring banks' transfer of $4,000,000 worth of government securities to Charter in exchange for $4,000,000 worth of Preferred Stock. Characterizing the transaction in this manner, only the second transfer qualifies as a § 351 exchange, meaning that: the transferring banks' basis in the Preferred Stock is less than $4,000,0000, they realized a capital gain upon "
