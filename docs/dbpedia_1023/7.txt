Being anxious to retain for ourselves a narrative of the activities of the 27th Bomb Group from the time it left America until it was rendered inactive by the War Department due to the almost complete depletion of its personnel in the Philippines and the activities of the few remaining survivors in Australia, I have asked Captain McAfee, the Group Intelligence Oﬃcer, to allot certain phases or periods of time to you to report on.

Preface

lenwood Stephenson has always been considered some-

thing of a hero among the members and descendents of his family. In the summer of 1934, at the height of the Depression, Glen left his home in Wisconsin to seek a better life. What began as a nomadic odyssey of riding the rails and picking up odd jobs just to stay alive culminated in his graduation from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and subsequent death in action as a U.S. Army Air Corps pilot in World War II. Glen’s family did not know much about his last years of life, nor were they able to obtain many details of his untimely death. After learning from oﬃcials that his son had died in a bomber crash in Australia in April 1942, Gordon Stephenson wrote to the army and to Glen’s fellow oﬃcers seeking information regarding his son’s military experience, though without much success. Other family members continued writing letters for years after the war and eventually were told that a ﬁre in 1973 at the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis was responsible for the lack of information. In 1995 Glen’s nephew Larry, the son of his brother Clyde, made what became a fortuitous trip to Australia. As a heart surgeon, he had been asked to speak at the annual meeting of the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand in Canberra. Knowing that his uncle had been killed in Australia and that the family had sought more detailed information, Larry devoted his spare time to researching at the National Military Museum. He did not ﬁnd much, but his curiosity was piqued. Back home he looked through the ﬁle that the family had accumulated on Glenwood and noticed an almost unreadable photocopy of a 1943 newspaper article listing the names of some surviving pilots who were known to have ﬂown with his uncle. Checking the West Point yearbook, Larry discovered that two of those pilots had been in Glen’s 1940 graduation class. He contacted the Military Academy Alumni Oﬃce, which agreed to pass letters of

PREFACE

inquiry to the two men, providing they were still alive. One of them, Julius B. “Zeke” Summers, responded and gave Larry a possible explanation as to why it had been so diﬃcult to ﬁnd information on Glen and his fellow airmen in the 27th Bombardment Group. 1,209 men had arrived in the Philippines in November 1941; one year later only twenty returned to the United States. The rest, according to Summers, were dead or in Japanese prison camps. Further complicating research eﬀorts was the fact that the 27th was consistently involved in America’s early World War II losses in the Philippines, Java, Australia, and New Guinea. Recordkeeping under those conditions had been a low- to nonexistent priority, and documents the units did have were often lost or had to be destroyed to prevent capture. Even so, Larry recognized that he held an ace for his research: He had spent twenty-one years in the army and reserves, retiring as a colonel, and as such would have access to records and personnel that civilians might not. Thus began literally years of letters, phone calls, and e-mails that slowly started to produce results. Glenwood’s service record began to take shape. A certain excitement was building. In 2000 Larry’s father, Clyde, met Adrian Martin. Adrian had written a book, Brothers from Bataan, about his own uncle who had been in the Philippines at the same time as Glen and had survived the Bataan Death March but died in a POW camp. Clyde, a Marine Corps veteran of World War II, believed, and Adrian agreed, that a book should be written about the 27th Bombardment Group. Almost immediately, Adrian began an investigation into the subject, with Larry sharing his accumulated information. After eight years of collaboration and further intense research, the story has emerged. For most Americans, the war in the Paciﬁc began at Pearl Harbor and continued with our costly but slow-and-steady march to Japan and victory. The shock and confusion of those early months of the war and the horrendous losses sustained by the 27th Bombardment Group and others were not events that the U.S. military wished to share with the home front. Once the tide had turned, the weeks and months of lost battles and lost lives were quickly forgotten in the rush to report every success. It is now recognized that units such as the 27th played a major role in the eventual defeat of the Japanese by delaying their progress and thus allowing America’s military production and troop training to gear up. This is a story worth telling. We wish this book to be a ﬁtting memorial to Glenwood Stephenson and his comrades in arms, who should no longer be the forgotten soldiers of the Paciﬁc. The epigraph that appears at the beginning of this book was written by

Preface

Col. John H. Davies, commanding oﬃcer of the 3rd Bombardment Group, U.S. Army Air Corps, writing at Charters Towers, Australia. Taken from the introduction to a ﬁfty-nine-page typewritten monograph, The 27th Bombardment Group Reports, which deals with the 27th Bombardment Group, it was completed in September 1942. The authors were U.S. Army Air Corps pilots from the 27th who had gotten out of the Philippines before Bataan fell. Photographs and many oﬃcial military documents such as troop lists, orders, and reports are included. Excerpts from this unpublished monograph are quoted throughout this book and referred to each time as the 27th Reports. At the time it was written, the authors only knew that U.S. forces on Bataan and Corregidor had surrendered but beyond that did not know their fate, which included that of most of their comrades in the 27th.

Acknowledgments As this project developed during the past six years, three former members of the 27th Bombardment Group have rendered invaluable assistance: Brig. Gen. William G. Hipps, USAF (ret.); Col. Ronald D. Hubbard, USAF (ret.); and Col. J. Harrison Mangan, USAF (ret.). They were always willing to give of their time to answer questions and provide explanations when necessary. Each also reviewed the manuscript during various stages of preparation. Chief MSgt. Paul H. Lankford, USAF (ret.), who has led the 27th Alumni Group over the past several years, has not only been helpful in answering questions and explaining various issues but also has provided us with introductions and access to other 27th alumni and their families. Other former members of the 27th and 3rd Bombardment Groups who have been particularly helpful include Ralph Harrell, Jack Heyn, George Kane, Dick Launder, and Lt. Col. Warren G. Stirling, USAF (ret.). Gus Breymann, whose uncle Gus Heiss was a pilot with both the 27th and 3rd, could always be relied upon to provide advice, track down a fact, or provide other information from his large collection on the subject. We appreciate the help of Mary Catherine May, author of The Steadfast Line, which focuses primarily on the 27th at Bataan, by providing troop lists and other group-related documents. We thank historian Noel Tunny, author of Fight Back from the North and Gateway to Victory, for his help and suggestions. Edward Rogers gave us documents, photographs, and good advice. We are indebted to author-historian William Bartsch, on whose two excellent books on the U.S. Army Air Corps in the Philippines, Doomed at the Start and December 8, 1941: MacArthur’s Pearl Harbor, we greatly relied on

Nearing the Brink of World Conﬂict

B

y the summer of 1940, the world was poised for global war. But no one was certain exactly when and where it would break out. During the prior twelve months, Europe had become engulfed in war. In the Far East, Japan was becoming progressively more belligerent toward its neighbors. Its armies had already invaded the Asian mainland, and by 1940 Japan controlled most of eastern China. Meanwhile, the United States, in its own search for world order, juggled several neutrality acts along with the Ludlow Amendment, which required a national referendum before Congress could declare war except in case of invasion. That summer two isolationist groups, America First and the Ohio (Over the Hill in October) Movement, ﬂoated propaganda through print and radio that the nation should stay out of these conﬂicts. But the longer the United States remained uncommitted, the more one-sided the struggles on the other side of the oceans became. Although land and naval strength were important, several strategists predicted that air power would win the next Great War. In response, the army and navy accelerated the training of U.S. military pilots in anticipation of America’s military involvement somewhere in the world. At the same time, the number of warplanes coming oﬀ West Coast assembly lines vastly increased. Glenwood Stephenson

It is easy to imagine a dusty Plymouth Road King coupe rolling up to the gate of the U.S. Army ﬂight school at Maynor Field near Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in July 1940. Peering inside, the MP on duty spotted the shiny gold bar on the collar of the driver’s khaki uniform and delivered a crisp salute. The gesture should not have taken 2nd Lt. Glenwood “Glen” Gordon Stephenson by surprise, but it did. It was his ﬁrst salute as a commissioned oﬃcer since graduation from one of the ﬁnest colleges in the nation the pre-

OPERATION PLUM

vious month. In his checkered earlier life, Stephenson had been continually penniless, a hobo who rode railroad freight cars, a “dogface” private in the army, and most recently that lowest of human forms, a cadet at the U.S. Military Academy. Salutes were something he was accustomed to giving, not receiving. Recovering, Stephenson returned the salute and showed his orders. Receiving permission to continue from the guard (and another salute), he put the Plymouth in gear, let out the clutch, and steered it through the gate to his new quarters. He was once again about to put himself on the trainee end of the military pecking order. But the young lieutenant was not dreading the experience—quite the contrary. Just prior to graduation, Stephenson learned that he had been accepted as a student in the U.S. Army Air Corps’s primary ﬂight school. Now here in central Alabama, he was reporting for training duty once again. His aim was to become a pilot. This was one more step along a challenging, fateful path. In June he had completed the four-year course at the Military Academy at West Point, New York, and achieved the ultimate goal of every cadet, which is to earn a bachelor of science degree and be commissioned a second lieutenant, U.S. Army. Stephenson was born in 1914 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to middle-class parents, Gordon and Hazel; his father was a successful electrical engineer. As a youth Stephenson displayed a sense of adventure. Twice, when things did not go his way, he tried running away. He spent hours in the ﬁelds and valley near his home searching for mischief with other neighborhood boys. Other times the boy enjoyed riding the streetcar from one end of Milwaukee County to the other alone. A Boy Scout, he ﬁnanced his streetcar trips by delivering newspapers. When Stephenson was in seventh grade, his comfortable life in Milwaukee came to an abrupt end. A doctor told his father that the dust at Cutler-Hammer, a manufacturer of electrical devices, and the dampness from nearby Lake Michigan were aggravating his asthma and he should move to the country. The family sold their city house in the spring of 1927. Gordon Stephenson closed on eighty acres of land near Arpin in central Wisconsin and became a farmer. The family’s new home was nothing like their comfortable Milwaukee residence. The house had no electricity or indoor plumbing, a shallow twenty-foot well provided water of dubious quality, and a round oak stove in the downstairs living room provided the only heat; the upstairs bedrooms in winter seemed as cold as the outdoors. The family never had a telephone. 2

Nearing the Brink of World Conﬂict

Years of ﬁghting asthma made his father rather frail, weak, and unable to perform strenuous physical activity, so Stephenson and his three brothers, Stuart (two years younger), Roland (four years younger), and Clyde (six years younger), supplied most of the farm labor. Fifteen cows provided milk that the family sold to a nearby cheese factory. Fifty chickens provided eggs, and a large vegetable garden provided food for canning. Grain was planted in the ﬁelds, and the trees at the back of the property furnished wood for heat. In the autumn of 1927, Stephenson began making the daily one-mile hike to the single-room Meadowbrook School, which had fewer students in all eight grades than there had been in one grade at his Milwaukee school. A year later he was a freshman at Auburndale High School north of Arpin. Because he lived on a farm, Stephenson drove his family Ford to school. It was about this time that the Stephensons’ ﬁnances took a turn for the worse because of the onset of the Great Depression. Proﬁts from the sale of the Milwaukee house had been invested in the stock market, which collapsed in October 1929, destroying all of the family’s investments. The wood the four boys cut now was sold to pay their mounting grocery debts. This and their other morning chores before school took a couple of hours minimum. The boys cleaned the cow stalls each morning, milked the cows, and fed them silage from the silo. They cooled the metal cans of milk to prevent spoiling before they delivered the milk to the cheese factory. Then they fed the horses and hitched them to the wagon. The milk cans were loaded afterward, and each, when full, weighed about eighty-ﬁve pounds. After the boys emptied them at the factory, the cans were ﬁlled with whey, a cheese byproduct, which the brothers fed to the hogs at home. They also had to feed other animals before ﬁnally heading oﬀ to class. After school, they had other farm chores, which often took hours to complete. Stephenson applied any extra energy to extracurricular school activities. He played on the varsity basketball team his junior and senior years and participated in school plays as well as the glee club. Academically, teachers lauded his skills but lamented that he seldom used them. During his senior year, the school principal appointed him president of the student council. The twenty seniors in Stephenson’s Auburndale High School Class of 1932 graduated that June. Herbert Hoover was still president. The New York Times index on the stock market was at its lowest, farm income was down $7 billion, and even college graduates were having diﬃculty ﬁnding work. That was the world confronting Stephenson. Because of family ﬁnances, a four-year college was out of the question. For those interested in becoming teachers, there were one-year programs oﬀered 3

OPERATION PLUM

at schools like WOCONO (Wood County Normal) in nearby Wisconsin Rapids. Stephenson moved in with the Fischers, who owned a creamery in which he worked for room and board while attending school. After a semester of teacher methods courses, he did classroom observations for six weeks and then was sent to a rural grade school for two months of actual teaching. Stephenson graduated with his twenty-six classmates in June 1933, but only ﬁve found teaching jobs. School districts were not hiring new teachers, and some were even cutting veteran teachers’ salaries. The young man often heard discouraging stories of the Depression from hobos who stopped at the creamery. In a letter to his family, he mentioned that “about a half dozen bums [hobos] a day stop in here for a drink of buttermilk. Everywhere, the general trend seems to be the same. Most of them have traveled to each of the government work projects that are supposed to be for the unemployed, but they say in nearly every instance, the work is done by contract.” Shortly after graduation, in another letter to his parents Stephenson described the bleak job situation in education and industry, suggesting that maybe he should look for “something diﬀerent” to do. By July he was a member of Battery E, 120th Artillery, Wisconsin National Guard, which was part of the 32nd Division. He was paid a dollar a month per meeting, with two weeks of summer camp required. He continued to work at the Fischer Creamery until the end of August. That month he drove to Waukesha, just west of Milwaukee, to see about enrolling in Carroll College but was unable to ﬁnd a job to pay for his room, board, and tuition. In November rumors began that the Wood County Civil Works Administration (CWA) might be hiring ﬁve hundred men in December to work on new road construction. Even unskilled workers in the CWA were making more than rural schoolteachers. By the end of the year he found employment at Richville Gravel Pit a few miles west of the family farm. During this time, Stephenson’s mother showed signs and symptoms of mental illness, and because of this, his sickly father, who was often ill-tempered, spent much of his time taking care of Lillian (seven and a half years old) and David (four years old), the youngest of the six children. In June 1934 Stephenson decided to head west in search of a job either along the way or along the West Coast. Hobos, those traveling vagabonds of the 1930s, were riding the rails looking for work. By the summer of 1934 estimates stated that 25,000 families and more than 200,000 young adults were wandering through the United States seeking food, clothing, shelter, and a job. Stephenson bought a camera, rolled up his few clothes in a bundle, and hitched a ride to the Green Bay and 4

Nearing the Brink of World Conﬂict

Western tracks in Wisconsin Rapids, where he hopped a westbound freight. He knew he had to be careful during his journey. Hobos usually hung out in “jungles” where trains stopped or where one line intersected with another heading in a diﬀerent direction. They were not a criminal element during the Depression. Many, like Stephenson, were educated folks down on their luck and looking for work and adventure; some even referred to themselves as “Knights of the Road.” Hobos usually looked out for each other and even developed their own symbol language, using chalk to mark sidewalks, trees, walls, fences, or doors to help their fellow travelers ﬁnd work, food, or a safe shelter in diﬃcult and dangerous environments. The symbols represented a particular direction or a warning such as “beware of dangerous dog,” “a kind lady lives here,” “people here will give you food for work,” “this is a safe place to camp,” “jail good but prisoners starve,” “police hostile to tramps,” or “bad man lives here.” As Stephenson rode west on the rails, he ﬁnally found a job in central Washington as a gandy dancer (one who installs or repairs railroad tracks), which lasted for a good part of the summer. In September the repairs were completed, and the railroad no longer needed the extra workers. He then made his way to California, where he found jobs just as scarce as anywhere. During this time, he wrote to his old high-school sweetheart, Maggie Zwaschka, and described himself as probably “the biggest ﬂop in the class so far.” Stephenson eventually enlisted in the army in November and was sent to Fort McDowell on Angel Island in San Francisco Bay, where he awaited transfer to the Philippines in January 1935. Arriving at Fort McKinley near Manila later that month, the fresh recruit was assigned to Company A, 31st Infantry Regiment and spent most of his time drilling and learning the craft of the soldier. Back in Arpin, life for his family was not going well. The Stephensons were having a diﬃcult time paying their bills. His father’s temperament, fueled by worsening asthma, his wife’s mental illness, and the poor economy, was not pleasant. That spring Gordon Stephenson ﬁled a quitclaim deed and turned over the farm to the man who held the mortgage. Also at this time, Stephenson’s mother was committed to the Mendota State Hospital in Madison. After hearing of the family problems, Stephenson wrote, “I’m sorry I can’t help out ﬁnancially, as I am still in the hole myself.” In late May his family left Arpin and rented a farm near Little Suamico, ten miles north of Green Bay. Within six months his maturity and intelligence had become evident to several of the company oﬃcers. They suggested that he attend the West Point 5

OPERATION PLUM

Prep School at Fort McKinley and then apply for an appointment to the military academy. For once, Lady Luck was on Stephenson’s side. That fall the Philippines held their ﬁrst national election and selected Manuel Quezon as president. The United States sent a forty-three-member congressional delegation to attend the inauguration, which included Wisconsin senator F. Ryan Duﬀy. While touring the military installation at Fort McKinley, Senator Duﬀy met Stephenson, who impressed him, and he encouraged the serviceman to apply to West Point. Afterward Stephenson soldiered on, but in a February 1936 letter the War Department informed him that he was the principal-at-large nominee of Senator Duﬀy. In May Stephenson left for New York by ship via California and the Panama Canal. That summer the prototype of the new four-engine Boeing B-17 bomber was being evaluated. The air corps wanted it for coastal defense, its primary mission at that time, as well as for strategic bombardment if that was needed. The Army General Staﬀ, however, had already cut the production order from sixty-ﬁve to thirteen airplanes and in June had vetoed a request by the air corps for additional planes. The army brass thought the range of this future super-bomber was excessive, one of the generals telling the airmen, “A couple hundred miles of range was enough to satisfy the interest of any Army commander.” On Wednesday, July 1, 1936, on the plain of West Point, Stephenson took the oath of “Duty, Honor, and Country.” Finances plagued him the ﬁrst year there. He did not realize that once accepted to the academy, he or his family had to deposit $300 to cover the cost of the plebe uniforms, books, and other necessities. The new cadet was both embarrassed and apologetic when his father received the bill, but fortunately, he was able to borrow part of the money from one of his aunts. Also, to economize, he had to miss many varsity football games and social events. Stephenson often referred to himself at West Point as a “dog face,” a nickname for lowly infantry grunts, which he had been in the Philippines. Near the end of Stephenson’s sophomore year, the Army Air Corps decided to test its navigational skills with the new long-range bomber, practicing the interception of an enemy ﬂeet sailing toward the East Coast. An Italian ocean liner, Rex, en route to New York served as the target for this exercise. Three B-17s were dispatched on the mission, locating the Rex 625 miles at sea. The liner was photographed and a message was dropped on her deck. The ﬂight on May 12 was broadcast on radio coast to coast and made front-page headlines across the country the next day. Naval oﬃcers, however, were incensed 6

Nearing the Brink of World Conﬂict

by this intrusion into their territory. The navy reminded the Army General Staﬀ of a rule promulgated by the War Department on September 1, 1936, at the apparent insistence of the navy, that limited Army Air Corps operations to an area within 100 miles of the continental coast. This rule would now be enforced, and the army promised to keep its airmen on a tighter leash. After successfully completing his ﬁrst two years at West Point, the cadets were given the summer of 1938 oﬀ. Stephenson had not seen his family or friends back home in the four years since he had left Wisconsin as a hobo. Much had changed for the Gordon Stephenson family since the last time the eldest son saw them. The Stephensons now lived near Little Suamico, a rural community just north of Green Bay, prompting Cadet Stephenson to write home for directions. Brothers Stuart, Roland, and Clyde were now taller than Stephenson, and Lillian and David could not remember what their absent brother looked like. And his mother was now conﬁned permanently to a mental institution. But one thing remained constant for the family; although never on relief, their struggle to survive the Depression was a daily challenge. Even though Stuart, Roland, and Clyde were good students, each had to drop out of school for at least a year at one time or another to help support the family. That summer, the cadet worked as a hired hand at a farm less than a mile from his family’s place, receiving twenty dollars a month plus room and board. He visited his family frequently and his mother at the mental institution. Clyde Stephenson later remembered: “I don’t recall Glen being any different the summer he was home from West Point—although he was more mature. I couldn’t see Glen acting big time because he came from such a poor family like ours. Glen had a good sense of humor, an outgoing personality, was adventurous, and deﬁnitely a leader.” On August 22 Cadet Stephenson’s visit came to an end. He said goodbye to his family and boarded a train, ﬁguring it would be only twenty-one months before he would see them all again following graduation. That summer, however, was the last time his close relatives and Wisconsin friends ever saw Stephenson. During his junior year, he started showing an interest in ﬂying.

U.S. Army Air Corps U.S. Army pilots had been in airplanes since before Stephenson was born, in fact beginning only eight years after the Wright brothers’ ﬁrst successful ﬂight. The army purchased three Wright Flyers and two Curtiss aircraft in 1911, its criteria for these heavier-than-air ﬂying machines including that they 7

carry two men aloft for at least one hour at a speed of forty miles per hour. Two second lieutenants, Henry “Hap” Arnold and Thomas Milling, were sent to Dayton, Ohio, to begin ﬂying lessons at the Wrights’ ﬂying school that May. In June they became the ﬁrst army oﬃcers to complete the course and returned to their base in Maryland. Wright Model B Military Flyers soon followed, crated in a railroad boxcar. After America entered World War I in 1917, the U.S. Army Air Service (which later became the Army Air Corps) swelled to more than 150,000 oﬃcers and enlisted men. Hap Arnold, who was a captain when the war began, rose to the temporary rank of colonel, serving at army headquarters in Washington as the executive oﬃcer of the Air Division, which was then part of the Signal Corps. By June 1919, with postwar demobilization, the air service shrunk to 5,500 oﬃcers and 21,500 enlisted men. In 1924 the air service conducted the ﬁrst successful ﬂight around the world, which began in Seattle on April 6 with four Douglas World Cruisers; two aircraft ﬁnished the journey 175 days later. Two years after this the Army Air Service became the Army Air Corps. In 1938 Major General Arnold, a member of the West Point Class of 1907, was made chief of the Army Air Corps. His World War I duties had included dealing with aircraft and engine production as well as pilot training. This experience well prepared him for things to come. Just as Stephenson was beginning his senior year, Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. Two days later France and Great Britain declared war on Germany. Within the next several days, many of the countries belonging to Britain’s Commonwealth of Nations, including Australia, Canada, India, Newfoundland, New Zealand, and South Africa, also declared war on Germany. On November 30 Russian troops invaded Finland. Germany attacked Denmark and Norway ﬁve months later. Pres. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was a proponent of a strong air force and on May 16, 1940, endorsed the expansion of the air corps by 2,748 ﬂying cadets and 7,000 enlisted men. One former air corps pilot recently recalled about this buildup: “General Hap Arnold, Chief of the Army Air Corps, was smart as hell. He decided that the only way that the President would have enough pilots for all the aircraft that were being built was to recruit them early. I went to every college town and explained that I was in town by orders of President Roosevelt, and I’d want to interview people about going into the Air Corps.” Those selected were put on a roster so that when the ﬂying schools opened, men were ready to attend immediately. On May 19 Germany invaded Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. As the Nazi regime continued to roll through Europe, Stephenson told 8

Nearing the Brink of World Conﬂict

his brother Stuart in a letter that the United States “would be damned fools to sit back, doing nothing, and watch other democracies fall.” In another letter home he wrote, “We are encouraged not to express too much in the way of opinions relative to government policies concerning the war in Europe, so consequently, I don’t say much—nor do any of us—even though we think quite a bit and draw conclusions among ourselves.” Right before his June graduation, Stephenson obtained a low-cost military loan and bought a 1940 Plymouth Road King coupe for $739.40. He had survived the academy’s four rigorous years and probably thought the tough times were behind him. But they had not yet begun. General Arnold’s eldest son, Henry H. “Hank” Arnold Jr., was also a member of the West Point Class of 1940, but unlike Stephenson, he was denied air corps training because of poor eyesight. On June 22 France surrendered to Germany. The fall of France eliminated most congressional disagreement about the need for massive expansion of national defense. Arnold and his air corps were soon given $1.5 billion with instructions to “get an air force.” During the second week of August, the Germans began massive air attacks on England.

Army Air Corps Pilot Training It was an intense environment that Stephenson stepped into that summer in Alabama. Primary Flight School lasted about three months. Much of that time was spent ﬂying with instructors in the primary trainer, a Stearman biplane. The wings, the fuselage, and the tail assembly of the aircraft were covered with cloth fabric instead of metal, the wings painted bright yellow and the fuselage a bright blue. There were two cockpits in tandem, each with a single seat, from which the plane could be ﬂown; the instructor would be seated in the back and the student pilot in the front. These airplanes took oﬀ and landed at a speed of 40–50 mph and cruised between 60–90 mph. Students learned not only to ﬂy during this phase but also some acrobatics to get a better feel for the plane. Classroom sessions followed daily early morning physical-ﬁtness workouts. By the end of the week, the weary pilots were looking for excitement. Fellow ﬂying cadet and West Point classmate Warren Stirling recalled: “Tuscaloosa County was dry. But 30 miles south in the next county, alcohol was permitted. Just across the county line was a bar called the Cotton Patch. Every Friday night, each student would migrate—as if it were a magnet—to the Cotton Patch to drink beer. They had a juke box in the corner that played continuously.” 9

OPERATION PLUM

While the ﬂyers were listening to tunes like “In the Mood,” “Georgia on My Mind,” “Moonlight Serenade,” and “Let’s Dance,” a controversial presidential election was approaching. Roosevelt was seeking an unprecedented third term, and before the election he urged the passage of the Selective Training and Service Act. The return of the draft was a risky political move. In September 1940 Congress passed the measure, which provided for the annual induction into the military of 900,000 men between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-six. This was the ﬁrst draft or conscription law enacted in the United States during peacetime. Also that month, Japan entered into the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy. The latter two had already agreed to come to each other’s aid in the so-called Pact of Steel. This considerably strengthened Japan’s hand in dealing with America, as the alliance bound the three powers to assist one another if attacked by a power not yet engaged in the European or Asiatic wars. In Washington, Roosevelt engineered a destroyers-for-naval-bases deal with Great Britain. Britain got ﬁfty U.S. Navy destroyers, while the United States received ninety-nine-year leases on several naval and air bases in the Atlantic and Caribbean. This was a major departure, many critics cried, from America’s position of neutrality. Shortly before the election, Roosevelt calmed voters who feared he was a warmonger by declaring in a Boston speech, “Your boys are not going into any foreign wars.” He was reelected with 84 percent of the electoral vote. Weeks later, while on a vacation cruise on the USS Tuscaloosa, the president received an urgent message from British prime minister Winston Churchill. To defeat Germany, Churchill said England needed every imaginable piece of war equipment plus seven thousand combat planes. Roosevelt’s response became the basis for the eventual Lend-Lease Act. His theory was that if the United States gave them the needed goods, England could defeat fascism and America would not have to get involved by sending manpower. After the war was over, they would return the materials that were lent to them. After all, Roosevelt had declared, “We must be the great arsenal of democracy.” By November, Stephenson had completed sixty-ﬁve hours of ﬂying and the ﬁrst phase of his pilot training. He would have been quite pleased with himself, for if you were going to ﬂunk out, it usually happened during Primary Flight School. Washouts were those who lacked the necessary ﬂying skills, especially those related to landing. Stephenson and his colleagues next moved on to the Southeast Air Corps Basic Flying School at Maxwell Field in Montgomery, Alabama. Leaving Tuscaloosa, the cadet pilots stopped at the Cotton Patch one last time for some of their delicious country-fried chicken. 10

Nearing the Brink of World Conﬂict

Maxwell Field, according to Stirling, was “one of the ﬁnest facilities of the Air Corps.” The men now entered Basic Flying School, which emphasized instrument ﬂying, navigational training, weather study, and day/night ﬂying in BT-13s and BT-14s. These trainer aircraft were sturdier aluminum-skinned monoplanes (having a single set of wings). They had an enclosed cockpit with two seats, one behind the other, with ﬂight controls with each. The student pilot would sometimes sit in the back and the instructor in the front seat, at other times the reverse, but after the students became familiar with the plane, they often ﬂew solo. BT-13s and BT-14s, mounting a 450-hp Pratt and Whitney engine, were much faster than the earlier Stearman biplanes. The cadet pilots also spent time in the Link Trainer, which was a mechanical mockup of a cockpit in which instrument ﬂying could be practiced without leaving the ground. In a fall letter Stephenson described the intensiﬁed training as “busy all the time getting up at 5:30 to drill the ﬂying cadets at 6:30. Then ground school all morning, and ﬂy from 12:00 to 5:00 every day. Have to keep awake all the time as we have about 50 instruments and plenty of power and speed. Often twenty or more ships try to land at the same time.” Getting leave time was next to impossible. Each ﬂying-school session usually lasted about four months but now was compressed to two to three months because of the need for more pilots with the expected outbreak of war. Thanksgiving furlough was canceled. Fortunately, Stirling and his wife, Florence, invited Stephenson and his roommates, Bert Hoﬀman and Jim Downing—all bachelors and members of the West Point Class of 1940—over for a turkey dinner. In many ways this was an ill-fated dining party, for Stephenson, Hoﬀman, and Downing would all die in air crashes during the war, and their host would spend three and a half years as a POW. But that was in the future. Of more immediate concern for the men, all four completed Basic in late December. On December 28 they began their ﬁnal phase of ﬂight instruction, Advanced Flying School, also at Maxwell. Pilots used AT-6 trainer airplanes, and the emphasis turned to night ﬂying, instrument ﬂying, cross-country ﬂying, and aerial gunnery. Flying the advanced trainer, with its 600-hp supercharged engine, retractable landing gear, and .30-caliber Browning machine gun, was more similar to ﬂying a ﬁghter of that time. Aerial gunnery consisted of in-ﬂight target practice with some stationary targets on the ground and others towed behind another plane. The .30-caliber machine gun ﬁred twenty rounds per second. The aerial target, about twenty feet long, made out of cloth, and resembling a big windsock with the larger end of the cone closest to the towing plane, was attached by a steel cable. When bullets hit 11

OPERATION PLUM

it, the target would ripple. Every so often the gun ﬁred a tracer so the pilot could observe the path of the shots. It was not uncommon to ﬁnd bullet holes in the tow plane after target practice. The seating arrangement in the AT-6 was the same as the basic trainer, where the instructor sat in one seat either in front of or behind the student pilot. On March 14 Stephenson graduated in the Class of 41-C with an aeronautical rating of Pilot. After the three ﬂying schools, he had 201 hours of ﬂying time, 64 percent of it ﬂying solo, and a ﬂying grade of C, very satisfactory. In his ground-school subjects he had a 92.6 percent average. Becoming an army pilot was not an easy task. From the time Stephenson entered ﬂight school until after the end of the war, the washout rate for this training regimen was 60 percent. Student pilots who did not make it often became navigators or bombardiers. Upon his graduation, Stephenson was ordered to report to the 27th Bombardment Group in Savannah, Georgia. West Point classmates Stirling (of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), James McAfee (of Charlotte, North Carolina), and Julius B. “Zeke” Summers (of Somerville, Tennessee) were also assigned to the unit. A new adventure was about to begin.

Savannah and Hunter Field Its oﬃcial name was the 27th Bombardment Group (Light, or L). The “L” designation at the end of its name indicated that the unit was equipped with smaller types of bombers, which were often more nimble and used in close support of ground troops. The aircraft needed to be fast and maneuverable, equipped with both forward- and rear-ﬁring guns, and able to carry a relatively large payload. They would swoop in low with their machine guns blazing and drop their ordnance. The airplanes themselves were referred to as “attack aircraft” and had the preﬁx “A” (attack) as part of the model number. The 27th at this time ﬂew single-engine Northrop A-17s and twin-engine Curtiss A-18s. It was also referred to as a “Bomb Group” and an “Attack Group,” the latter being the name of Army Air Corps units ﬂying these types of aircraft up until the late 1930s. In addition, 27th pilots ﬂew Douglas B-18s, which were twin-engine medium bombers and had been considered state of the art in the mid 1930s. The designation “Medium,” or “M,” indicated a group that primarily ﬂew medium bombers such as twin-engine B-18s, B-25s, and B-26s. The designation “Heavy,” or “H,” meant a unit ﬂew larger fourengine bombers like the B-17s, B-24s, and later B-29s. The 27th Bombardment Group was constituted on December 22, 1939, and activated on February 1, 1940, when the elite 3rd Bombardment Group 12

was split in two at Barksdale Field in Louisiana. In October the 27th and the 3rd moved to Hunter Field in Savannah, Georgia, so the airmen could practice low-level attacks against ships oﬀ the Atlantic coast. The 27th originally consisted of the 15th, 16th, 17th, and Headquarters Squadrons, but the 15th was sent to Lawson Field at Fort Benning, Georgia, then replaced by the 91st Squadron. Savannah’s civil airﬁeld had recently been named for hometown World War I ﬂying ace Frank Hunter. In ninety days more than three thousand Savannah-area workers changed the city airport into an army air base, adding barracks, hangars, and runways. Although civilian ﬂights continued temporarily at Hunter, local oﬃcials recognized that a new commercial airport was needed. Eventually, a new facility emerged northwest of the city, but in 1941 all air activity was at Hunter, or as the Army Air Corps called it at the time, the Savannah Air Base. About the time Stephenson motored to Savannah, the 27th had received twin-engine Douglas A-20 Havoc attack bombers fresh from the assembly line in California. Pilots took trains and sometimes Douglas DC-3 twin-engine transports to the plant at Long Beach and ferried the A-20s to Savannah, ﬂying in formation and making stops along the way. In his memoir pilot Ron Hubbard said about the thrill of ﬂying these brand-new high-performance warbirds: “The feeling of power and speed, it was the ﬁrst modern plane that I had ﬂown. When the air speed crept up over 200 mph, I screamed exultantly. It would seem slow now, but at the time it was wild. I was in love with the plane. The thrill was greater than when I checked out much later in the jet ﬁghters.” Hubbard was a ﬁrst lieutenant in the Headquarters Squadron at the time. He had grown up in Warren, Ohio, and spent the year after high school graduation working in a steel mill to earn money to attend college. After two and a half years at nearby Hiram College, he dropped out when his funds ran out and joined the Army Air Corps, with the intent of earning enough money to return to school and obtain a degree in mathematics. The army sent him to San Antonio, where he completed his primary and basic courses at Randolph Field, nicknamed the “West Point of the Army Air Corps.” He graduated from the advance course at nearby Kelly Field in October 1938, then served as a pilot in attack squadrons in Hawaii until his transfer to the Headquarters Squadron in 1941. Stephenson’s ﬁrst ﬂights in Savannah were in the older, slower B-18 bomber. In a letter home he described his often-dangerous ﬂights: “Cruise at about 150–180 mph and land at 90–100 mph. Last Sunday, I made an ordered ﬂight to Louisville, Kentucky, and we almost didn’t get back as one 14

of the props got to throwing oil from the engine. Lost 14 gallons in 3 hours, which is a lot of oil.” In the same letter he mentioned that fuel put in his plane contained some water, causing his engines to quit before he got on the runway. Another plane fueled at the same time crashed just after takeoﬀ, injuring the crew. Sand was also tough on the planes in Savannah. Stephenson noted that it was “especially hard on the airplane engines, even the cars. We’re lucky here if we get half the normal life out of an engine before it is ready for a complete overhaul.” Sometimes sod was laid to cut down on the blowing sand. Pfc. Paul Lankford of the 16th Squadron remembered that because of the soft soil, the pilots would have to rev the engines to almost maximum power to jockey the big planes into their parking space. “The air base commander was giving twenty young Southern belles a tour of our airbase. As the pilot turned the plane to park it, he throttled the engines to full rev. The skirts and petticoats went almost straight up over their heads and the ladies had all they could do to try and pull them down. It was quite a sight!” Lankford, who was from Gadsden, Alabama, was typical of the younger enlisted men in the 27th. He had joined the army in October 1939 shortly after 15

OPERATION PLUM

graduating from high school. Following in-processing, he was sent to Barksdale Field and attended a six-week Army Air Corps training course taught by 1st Lt. William Hipps of the 3rd Bomb Group, who, like Lankford in February 1940, would soon ﬁnd himself in the 16th Squadron of the 27th. He was sent to Love Field in Dallas, Texas, where he completed a six-month aircraft-engine maintenance course in March 1941 and then returned to the 27th. Stephenson’s job with the 27th, besides being a pilot, was as engineering oﬃcer for the 16th Squadron. He was third in command for a squadron of ﬁfteen oﬃcers, 190 enlisted men, and eighteen planes. There were many split ups of the 27th as the Army Air Corps expanded and some personnel were sent elsewhere to form new units. New men arrived daily from various mechanical and specialist schools. Stephenson observed in a letter that everyone had their yellow-fever shots and one unit expected to be sent to the Caribbean. He thought his unit might be next. They even had classes in Spanish on the base, which further fueled that speculation.

The 27th and Airborne Artillery After the success of the Nazi Stuka dive bombers early in the war, the army and the air corps decided that they needed dive bombers too. In late spring of 1941, the 27th would be one of the ﬁrst units to receive them. The German Junkers 87, better known as the Stuka, made its World War II debut over Poland and was the most conspicuous element in the fearsome Blitzkrieg. While Luftwaﬀe ﬁghter pilots controlled the air over many European countries, Stukas ﬂew precision-bombing missions in support of the rapidly advancing German armies, functioning as the ﬁeld commander’s airborne artillery. Although these planes proved highly eﬀective, the U.S. Army prior to the war had little interest in this form of bombing, mainly because of performance limitations, which they had found inherent in the design of such airplanes. They were developing larger two- and four-engine aircraft that could ﬂy longer distances and carry greater bomb loads. The U.S. Navy, however, found dive bombers eﬀective for precision bombing and for attacking maneuvering ships. These planes typically carried one large bomb, which was capable of crippling or even sinking a ship, attached to the underbelly of its fuselage. After the pilot initiated the dive, the closer he got to the target before releasing his weapon, the more accurate he tended to be (but he still had to allow enough altitude to safely pull out of the dive). Although the accuracy of the bomb-delivery system increased the closer the plane got to the target, unfortunately for the pilot, so did the eﬀectiveness of antiaircraft and other defensive ﬁre. 16

The U.S. Navy had dive bombers. In May 1941 the 27th Bombardment Group started getting these single-engine aircraft, which were called SBD (Scout Bomber Douglas)-2s and SBD-3s. The army referred to them as the Douglas A-24 Dauntless dive bomber. Some came directly from the navy, and others came from the Douglas factory in Long Beach. Pilots from the 27th would travel to California, then ﬂy the planes back to Georgia. Stephenson’s real ambition, however, was to ﬂy one of the new twinengine A-20 light bombers. He remarked in a letter that he might have to go to McDill Field in Tampa to be checked out in one. Because of a one-pilot compartment, the ﬁrst ﬂight was solo, and the men needed room for possible error. McDill had 7,000-foot-long runways that were 360 feet wide; Hunter’s were only around 4,000 feet. The light bombers could cruise at 300 mph and landed at from 110 to 130 mph. When Stephenson returned to Savannah, the 27th was preparing for maneuvers. But he was not going. He was one of a handful of group pilots instead detailed to “Ferrying Command” duties.

Air Ferrying Command President Roosevelt signed the Lend-Lease Act into law on March 11, 1941, just about the time Stephenson was graduating from ﬂight school at Maxwell. The bill went well beyond the destroyers-for-bases deal of a few months previous. Congress appropriated $7 billion to initiate the arrangement. Ships, tanks, guns, and planes were now headed to Britain. The United States remained neutral in name only and inched closer to entering the European war. England needed bombers, and the Douglas Long Beach plant was producing them at a rapid rate. What were needed were trained pilots to ﬂy them from the West Coast to the East Coast for shipment overseas. On May 29 the air corps created the Air Ferrying Command to ﬂy aircraft from U.S. factories to Canadian and American Atlantic ports for delivery. At ﬁrst factory crews delivered the planes, but by mid-July the ferrying task was in the hands of the Army Air Corps. Some aircraft destined for the British, such as four-engine B-17 bombers, were ﬂown directly to England using air-ferrying routes with refueling stops along the way. The war continued to spread. On June 22 Germany invaded the Soviet Union. At the beginning of July, Stephenson, James McAfee, Robert Ruegg, Arthur Rush, Robert Staﬀord, and possibly a few others from the 16th Squadron were ordered to California. Initially staying at the Hotel Carmel in Santa Monica, Stephenson sent a postcard to his brother Clyde indicating that his assignment of ﬂying one plane a week across the country would probably 18

Nearing the Brink of World Conﬂict

take forty-ﬁve days. In a letter to his brother Stuart, he described these ﬂights: “made the last trip from Long Beach to New York City in 2–1/2 days [actually fourteen hours of ﬂying time]. We have to cruise around 200 mph to conserve gasoline as we get the best hourly consumption rate at that speed.” The Long Beach Airport (Mines Field) was where the men usually boarded the Douglas aircraft. The company, however, was having diﬃculty producing enough planes, and Boeing took up the slack. Some pilots would go to a location near Seattle to ferry the Boeing-built planes to the East Coast. The aircraft being delivered were similar to the A-20s the 27th were ﬂying. The British designated them the DB-7B Havoc. The paint color of the Royal Air Force was slightly diﬀerent than the American A-20s, using the RAF red, white, and blue roundel instead of the American white star. Most shuttle crews for the DB-7Bs consisted of only one person, the pilot. Sometimes a group would ﬂy in formation, other times the men just kept visual contact with one another. Depending on which route the DB-7B pilots took determined where they stopped to refuel on their way to Floyd Bennett Field in New York City. Montreal, Canada, also received planes, and British pilots were on hand to ﬂy some of them to England by a northern route. Pilots often chose their own course and altitude cross-country. The rules were somewhat restrictive as the planes were not to be ﬂown at night or under instrument conditions. Occasionally, the men even got to have fun with the planes. Ruegg recalled that one time he and others ﬂew close to the ground and chased antelope across the prairie. Frank “Pete” Bender, who had grown up in Brooklyn, New York, was another pilot assigned to the Ferrying Command. He attended Hobart College in upstate New York, making the All-American lacrosse team. He joined the Army Air Corps in 1939 and completed his primary pilot’s course in Tuscaloosa. Bender was then sent to Randolph Field for his basic course and then to Kelly Field. Upon graduation in May 1940, he was assigned to the 3rd Bomb Group in Savannah. After completing his Ferrying Command duties and returning to Savannah in September, Bender was reassigned to Stephenson’s 16th Squadron of the 27th. In his memoir he reveals that the ferrying trips “were relatively leisurely, and while not boring, were not really challenging to us ‘hot pilots.’ But boys will be boys, and we quickly learned that we could avoid any boredom that might have bothered us en route by performing some mild aerobatics, such as slow rolls, which would keep boredom at bay.” Often, when one plane was delivered, the pilots had to immediately hop on a commercial airliner to return to the West Coast. Stephenson complained 19

OPERATION PLUM

once in a letter about landing at Floyd Bennett Field and then making a mad dash across Brooklyn to get to La Guardia, where they were holding a West Coast–bound plane for him. Returning to Long Beach was sometimes an adventure. On one occasion poor weather kept Stephenson’s ﬂight grounded in Denver, so he took a train to Salt Lake City and caught another plane to Long Beach. Problems also developed heading east. After staying overnight in El Paso, the next leg of the trip found him grounded in St. Louis because of a structural problem. Afterward, all DB-7Bs were temporarily grounded. Several times Stephenson ﬂew into Chicago on his way back to California and hoped he could visit his family in Wisconsin. Each time his day oﬀ was denied. By the winter of 1940–41, the Stephenson family had given up on being farmers. His brother Roland was then an engineering student at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, and his younger brother Clyde had joined the Marines and was stationed with the U.S. Paciﬁc Fleet at Pearl Harbor. Money continued to be a problem. In August, however, Stephenson was able to send Roland thirty dollars to buy a new suit and also sent brother Stuart a ten-dollar check to “buy something nice for the family.” In mid-September Stephenson learned that he would be returning to the 27th in Savannah by October 1. He fully expected to move to a new station shortly thereafter. While he was away, the 27th went to Louisiana on maneuvers in August and had a good opportunity to test their A-20s and dive bombers.

Louisiana Maneuvers Heat, humidity, dust, chiggers, mosquitoes, malaria, snakes, and mud were daily fare in Louisiana for the 27th as they and other units began the largest U.S. military maneuvers to that time. More than 350,000 soldiers—nineteen full divisions—and ﬁfty thousand vehicles participated. War games were a vital training tool in preparation for the war everyone thought was coming but no one wanted to discuss. The 27th was involved in two training maneuvers, one at Barksdale Field near Shreveport and the other at Lake Charles in the Louisiana bayous. While foot soldiers of the “Red Army” and the “Blue Army” fought through swamps and mud on the ground, the air corps practiced bombing, straﬁng, and air support for both sides. There were a few accidents, as evidenced by this excerpt from the 27th Reports: The entire ﬁrst phase went well with only one or two minor mishaps. Harry Mangan on a test ﬂight in an A-20 had one engine go out 20

Nearing the Brink of World Conﬂict

on the take-oﬀ and landed in the Red River, a little wet and a little wiser. Dick Birnn tore out six high-tension lines and blacked out 7 towns, coming out O. K. except for a power company complaint. Then, too, there was the episode told of the 27th when they bombed and routed their own cavalry. But who can tell which side one’s on when he’s on both. Fortunately the errant bombs did not injure anyone on the ground; they were only ﬂour sacks. In the ﬁrst week alone, seventeen soldiers died—seven by motor accidents, one by suicide, two by drowning, two by disease, and ﬁve by airplanes. Later a few others succumbed to coral-snake bites. Practicing without real weapons was far from ideal. Besides the ﬂour sacks for bombs, according to Ron Hubbard, trucks and jeeps simulated tanks and stovepipes became antitank guns. Soldiers ﬁred blanks. Most of the time the men slept on drenched soil. The 27th ﬂew more missions than any other group at the maneuvers. It was during this time that they used the airplane they were supposed to take overseas—A-24 dive bombers. By October the entire group was back in Savannah, where Stephenson rejoined the unit. In a late September letter sent to his brother Stuart from Long Beach, Stephenson included some unexpected news. “May get married if I get moved oﬀ to Texas or some such place so don’t be surprised. Not promising anything.” His family did not even know that he was dating.

Ann Grace Nail This abrupt two-sentence mention of marriage in the middle of a four-page letter to Stuart jolted the Stephenson clan. There was no way to question Stephenson by phone, for the family did not have one. By the time a letter arrived seeking answers, Glenwood Stephenson and Ann Grace Nail of Savannah already had their marriage license. His romance in one sense should not have caused surprise. The girls at Auburndale High School had adored him, female classmates at Wood County Normal found him good looking, there were numerous pictures of him at West Point with elegantly dressed young ladies by Lake Delaﬁeld and Flirtation Walk, and he constantly questioned his brothers about their love lives. Yet in his letters he never once mentioned dating anyone. Ann Nail was a slender beauty with radiant brown hair who possessed an engaging smile and was almost ﬁve years younger than Stephenson. She was eighteen in 1938 and an usherette at the historic Lucas Theatre. Two years 21

later she ran the cash register at Morrison’s Cafeteria a few blocks away. Both spots were popular with the air-base oﬃcers. In the early months at the new base, the food was not very good, and oﬃcers often drove downtown for a good meal and entertainment. Capt. William Hipps had introduced Nail to Stephenson at the Oﬃcers Club at Hunter in March 1941. The two hit it oﬀ immediately. Nail’s family came to Savannah from Reidsville, a small town forty miles west of Savannah. By the time Stephenson came into the family picture, the parents had separated. She continued to live with her mother and on occasion brought her new pilot-boyfriend home. Her mother adored Stephenson. He was a West Point graduate, good looking, humorous, and steadily employed. He represented a secure future for her daughter, who already had suﬀered through an impulsive and secretive ﬁrst marriage. When she was eighteen, Nail had eloped one night in April 1938 and was married before a judge. The union lasted only two weeks before the young bride was living back home. Stephenson’s whirlwind courtship slowed in July, when he was assigned to the Ferrying Command. Cards and letters from the various cities he ﬂew into and an occasional visit to Savannah kept the relationship going. When he returned in late September, Stephenson was convinced that no matter where he was going to be sent next, he would get married. The couple exchanged vows on October 6 in a quiet Monday afternoon ceremony at the home of Rev. Arthur Jackson, the pastor of the First Baptist Church. After the wedding, the couple toured New York City, visited the Catskills, and even spent a day at West Point. The honeymoon, however, was short. The 27th had received its secret orders. They were to be part of Operation PLUM and were scheduled to leave around October 19. While on his honeymoon, Stephenson was promoted to ﬁrst lieutenant.

“This Rumor Has Gone Too Far!”

A

cronyms and code names played a big role in the military lexicon of World War II. “Radar,” “OVERLORD,” and “D-Day” all had an additional life once the war was over. One name, however, seemed to fade away not long after its birth. That was Operation PLUM. The word “PLUM” was stamped on every piece of equipment and footlocker in October after the 27th received their secret orders. The reason this term has received little attention decades later is that for many it came to mean death, for most three and a half years as a POW, and for all an experience with extreme frustration. When Stephenson returned from his brief honeymoon trip to New York, most of the oﬃcers knew where the 27th was headed—the Philippines. Enlisted men like SSgt. Louis Kolger considered this a chance for travel and great adventure. “Our destination was supposed to be secret, and when the subject came up at Hunter Air Base, people would tell you so. On the other hand, you could go to any saloon in Savannah, and they would tell you that the 27th was being sent to the Philippines.” Operation PLUM Although many members of the 27th thought that PLUM was an acronym and meant either “Philippines-Luzon-Unaccompanied-Manila” or “Philippines-Luzon-Manila,” it was actually a code name for the “U.S. Army in the Philippines.” Pfc. Leland Sims of the Headquarters Squadron recalled that as a joke he and several others informed their families that PLUM stood for “Places Lost Unto Man.” Those who jokingly called it “PLUM to Hell,” however, would turn out to have the most accurate description of what was to follow. Some who had initially signed on escaped the assignment by pure luck. Pvt. Ralph Harrell had been with the 3rd Bombardment Group at Barksdale

“This Rumor Has Gone Too Far!”

Field in Louisiana and moved with them to Savannah. He missed the Louisiana maneuvers in September because he was attending a technical school. A week before the 27th left for the Philippines, one of his hometown buddies in the 3rd, Pvt. Granville “Buck” Prewett, said, “Ralph, if you get out now and don’t go overseas, you will miss all of the excitement, and have nothing to talk about.” Prewett had just signed up for the 27th on a bulletin board in the cafeteria. Harrell also went over and put his name on the list. Later that day, however, his girlfriend in Savannah talked him out of it, and he crossed oﬀ his name. A day later the orders were cut, and those on the list were in the 27th and no longer part of the 3rd. By going to the Philippines, Buck deﬁnitely had something to talk about. He would endure the Bataan Death March and three and a half years in Japanese prison camps. Many looked back on that month of October as being one of utter confusion. New men were suddenly assigned to the 27th. There were a few desertions by those who did not want to go overseas. Unfortunately, much equipment needed for the Philippines was left behind. Kolger was told to leave all his supplies and equipment in Savannah with the understanding that it would be replaced when he got to his new base. He left Savannah without as much as a screwdriver to service a bomb group. Some took items that seemed illogical at ﬁrst. Hubbard got some advice from a friend when he brought his wife to her parents’ home in Ohio. “Ran into an old retired army oﬃcer who had served in the Far East. Inspired by his stories of the hunting possibilities in the Philippines, I visited the local sporting goods store and bought the only big game riﬂe they had, a Winchester 348.” Since most of the oﬃcers and enlisted men assumed they were going to a warm climate, they packed such items as golf clubs and swimming suits. Gus Heiss, a pilot in the 17th Squadron from Houston, Texas, packed a small, but good, phonograph and his library of classical records. Despite the uncertainty over what to take, one thing seemed certain—the 27th would have A-24 dive bombers in the Philippines. Many of the pilots had only a few ﬂights in the plane before they left Hunter. The promise was that the bombers would be there for them when they arrived in Manila. Majs. Reginald F. C. Vance and John “Big Jim” Davies, the two senior oﬃcers in the 27th, went out to California ahead of the group and visited Sacramento, where they saw “Pop” Liggett, who commanded the Army Air Corps depot there. The oﬃcers tried to expedite the process of getting their bombers transported to the West Coast and then to the Philippines. The planes had to be disassembled, crated, and shipped by rail to California, where they would then be loaded on a ship. 25

OPERATION PLUM

Major Vance had recently returned from England, where he had been an observer for the Army Air Corps during the Battle of Britain. After his arrival, he was assigned to command a squadron of observation planes in Savannah, which was not part of the 27th Bomb Group. When it was determined that the 27th would be sent to the Philippines, Vance, who was senior to Davies in both age and years in the military, was then assigned to the unit as its new commander. Major Davies, who was the operations oﬃcer of the 27th, became assistant commander. Davies’s nickname, “Big Jim,” was well deserved as he was said to have stood six feet, four and a half inches tall by some and six feet, six inches by others. He was born in Piedmont, California, in 1903 and attended the University of California, where he earned a varsity letter as a javelin thrower. Soon after graduation in 1928, he joined the Army Air Corps and obtained his pilot training in California and San Antonio. Among his numerous previous air-corps assignments was a stint with the 3rd Attack (Bomb) Group in the mid-1930s. By October 21 the ﬁve troop trains were loaded, and supposedly all took diﬀerent routes to avoid sabotage. The A-24s were to meet them in California. The next day the men were moving west. The 16th Squadron boarded their train around noon. It was raining hard, and the men felt mixed emotions at their departure. Stephenson shared a compartment with fellow pilot Pete Bender. Leland Sims recalled that a ﬁve-day trip in a crowded train without the opportunity for a shower was more than quite annoying. Many thought the military would arrange a trip like those advertised in magazines. The reality was far from this ideal. Hubbard in his memoir states: “lured by the remembrance of a couple of train trips in the past, I decided to volunteer to travel with the troop train. It was a very bad mistake. Stops were at isolated sidings way oﬀ in the boondocks with bored hours of waiting for the tracks to clear. Food or drink, when it did come, was mainly dried out sandwiches and cold coﬀee.” The trains arrived in San Francisco between October 26 and 29, but not all of the men rode the rails. Several oﬃcers went by car, while a few others ﬂew. On Angel Island the men each received numerous vaccinations for prevention of the various diseases they might encounter in the tropics. While the President Coolidge was being loaded with equipment, the oﬃcers toured San Francisco. A foreshadowing of the disaster awaiting the 27th in the Philippines occurred while loading the ship. On October 29 a boxcar waiting on a siding of the pier, which contained the personal belongings of the oﬃcers, somehow broke loose and rolled oﬀ the dock and into the bay. A crane and a barge had to be procured. It took a day to retrieve the boxcar and another 26

“This Rumor Has Gone Too Far!”

day to unload it. Each oﬃcer claimed his belongings, which were spread out on the dock to dry and included suits, uniforms, coats, boots, shoes, books, golf clubs, a Winchester 348, and probably Gus Heiss’s phonograph and record collection. Because of the damp weather, those soggy items that were still salvageable were later taken to Angel Island, where attempts were made to further dry them before repacking them for the voyage. Finally the day came for departure to their not-so-secret destination. Ferry boats transported troops from Angel Island to the Coolidge, moored on the east side of Pier 45 in San Francisco Harbor: The men started down the Angel Island Hill on a dreary, drizzling November 1st. It somehow beﬁtted the mood of the time. Everyone was naturally sad at leaving their friends and families, but each had an inner conviction that he was doing the right thing. Sad, perhaps, but the men were really sure of themselves. On to the small ferryboats the Squadron passed. Each man was checked before he got on the boat. Finally loaded, the little vessel poked into the harbor and the ﬁrst famous words of the 27th were uttered by Willie Eubank, “This rumor has gone too far.” Then at once laughter and jeers broke out relieving the tension. That made the ferry land midst a great deal of kidding and laughter. Up the gangplanks into the U.S.S. Coolidge poured the 27th Group, young men, elderly men, eager men, anxious men, sad men, but all men. They were really a wonderful crew and the Group Commander had reason to feel proud. At last the whistle blew, people waved, and the great ship shuddered as her props dug into the water and headed for the Golden Gate Bridge. Everyone craned a neck for a last look. Then into the Paciﬁc Ocean the ship slipped. The 27th Group was Philippine Islands bound. The remark that had gotten the troops laughing was made by twenty-nineyear-old 1st Lt. William Eubank Jr. from Blueﬁeld, West Virginia. He was the leader of the 91st Squadron and had been a member of the 3rd Bomb Group before being assigned to the 27th. Another pilot, Harrison “Harry” Mangan, commented about departure day: “I recall my mother standing on the dock waving good-bye—a forlorn ﬁgure if I ever saw one. She had said good-bye to my step-father just a few months before from that same spot!” Mangan was born in Nogales, Arizona, located on the Mexican border, where his family owned property. His stepfather, Walter, was an army colonel and a graduate of West Point, whose 27

OPERATION PLUM

career had taken him to many diﬀerent places so that Harry had attended thirteen diﬀerent schools by the time he graduated from high school in North Carolina. Mangan then attended college for two years at the Citadel (the military college of South Carolina) before quitting to join the Army Air Corps. Wanting to be a “ﬂyboy,” he was initially too young to be a pilot, so his unit trained him as a bombardier. At age twenty-one he began pilot training at the Dallas School of Aviation in 1940 and completed the subsequent two courses at Randolph and Kelly Fields. He was then assigned to the 3rd Bomb Group in Savannah and reassigned to the 27th in January 1941. Parting in Savannah on October 22 had been diﬃcult for the Stephensons, newlyweds of only ﬁfteen days. He tried to make the best of it. In his long distance calls and letters to his wife, he tried to remain cheerful. His ﬁrst letter, written aboard the ship bound for the Philippines, expressed his true feelings: “I tried not to show how much it hurt when we parted, but somehow, today I feel worse than ever about it all, and I do miss you more than I ever thought possible. I never thought I’d ever settle down and be really contented and happy. Seems like a dream now, but I can thank Heaven I do have you to come back to.”

The Passage to the Philippines Despite the anguish of leaving friends and families, the trip on the President Coolidge was a rather pleasant experience. The ten-year-old cruise ship had been taken over by the army in 1941 to transport troops eight thousand miles to the Philippines and return to San Francisco with American military dependents, who were being evacuated because of a potential war with Japan. The Coolidge had been partially gutted to make room for all the soldiers but still retained some of the elements of leisure, including a swimming pool and theater. A ship of the American Presidents Lines, the Coolidge had huge eagles painted on its smokestacks, and being relatively new, it had speed. The senior oﬃcers were arranged three to a stateroom, while the younger oﬃcers had bunk beds or cots on the breezy screened-in decks. Enlisted men bunked below decks. Stephenson roomed with experienced oﬃcers Louis Hobbs and Ed Backus, who were both about to be promoted to captain. Their stateroom was one of the larger cabins, so many of the other oﬃcers used it to hold bull sessions and for loaﬁng. It was a leisurely, comfortable cruise. To prevent boredom, some read, some wrote letters home, some played cards, and some participated in the various recreational programs available. Swimming, deck tennis, and boxing were the favorites. Pfc. James Bollich of the 16th Squadron participated in boxing and recalled that the winner received 28

three dollars for his eﬀorts and the loser two dollars. Bender remembered in his memoir that “a ring was set up on the deck. Ruegg and I were the ﬂyweights. It was not until about 25 years later that we discussed this ﬁght and each of us thought we lost it based on the beating that each of us endured. We really went at it with vigor.” At least the troops were entertained. There were two army nurses as well as army physicians and dentists onboard who looked after the troops’ health needs and conducted sick call each morning. The 27th had its own dentist, Dr. Claude Daniels, and each squadron had a physician assigned. Capt. William Marrocco was the senior physician and assigned to the Headquarters Squadron. First Lt. Carl Mango 29

OPERATION PLUM

was assigned to the 17th, 1st Lt. Elack Schultz to the 91st, and 1st Lt. David Hochman to the 16th. Hochman’s training and the circumstances that led him to the 16th typiﬁed that of the younger physicians onboard. Originally from New York City, he graduated from New York University and then attended medical school at the Royal College of Physicians in Edinburgh, Scotland. After that he served a two-year internship in New York City before being drafted and assigned to the 16th Squadron, 27th Bombardment Group in July 1941. Although he had no military training whatsoever, he was given the title of ﬂight surgeon. The one thing that most of the men remembered about the trip was that the food was great. The cruise ship’s dinner menu, diﬀerent every night, oﬀered nine distinct appetizers, multiple soups, steaks, prime rib, salmon, roast duck, and ﬁve types of vegetables plus desserts. In his diary James McAfee compared the mess to “the kitchen of Henry VIII.” Little did those feasting like royalty know that, in a few short months, they would be starving on Bataan and considering themselves fortunate whenever they were able to obtain a morsel of meat from a monkey, water buﬀalo, or army mule. Stephenson took the menus, colorfully decorated with Far East scenes, and wrote on the back letters to Ann every night on the ﬁrst leg of the trip to Honolulu. Although the Coolidge had plenty of bars, none was open. Many of the oﬃcers, however, smuggled on their own liquor. For a price, the ship’s stewards could also supply alcohol. One of the party scenes was Stephenson’s stateroom. In a letter to his wife, he mentioned that one of his roommates smuggled a gallon of whiskey onboard and spent an inebriated evening drinking numerous toasts to Stephenson’s picture of Ann. But the trip was not just one big party. There was still soldiering to do. Each morning saw roll call followed by physical training exercises. The huge, comfortable lounge was the perfect spot for lectures from several oﬃcers who had prior Philippine experience. They provided an overview of what to expect in Manila and elsewhere in the islands. Capt. William Hipps lectured on dive-bombing techniques. Hipps had become leader of the 16th Squadron during the summer of 1941. He was born in Lumber City, Pennsylvania, in 1912 and had graduated from West Point in 1937. He obtained his pilot training at Army Air Corps schools in San Antonio and was then assigned to the 3rd Attack (Bomb) Group. When the 3rd was split in 1940 to form the 27th Bomb Group, Hipps was transferred into the new unit. At about the time they boarded the Coolidge, oﬃcials decided that the 16th Squadron was “top heavy” with West Pointers; the 17th Squadron already had Warren Stirling. Summers was 30

therefore transferred to the 91st Squadron while onboard the Coolidge, leaving Hipps, Stephenson, and McAfee in the 16th. Besides games of poker, bridge, and double-deck pinochle, many listened to radio station KGEI from San Francisco, which was broadcast over the ship’s PA system each evening. Pilot Columbus “Doc” Savage from the 16th Squadron remembered one of the sergeants was listening to the popular tune “Georgia on My Mind.” The sergeant told him, “Hmm, Georgia on my mind. What I really want is Georgia under my feet.” Homesickness set in for many. One oﬃcer had deserted and never boarded the ship. McAfee said in his diary that he missed his wife, Julia, so much that he thought of getting oﬀ the boat in Hawaii and returning home. Most of the married men could hardly wait for Hawaii so they could mail their letters and call home. Finally, on the morning of November 6, Diamond Head came into view. Major Davies granted shore-leave passes with the warning that everyone had to be back onboard by 2:00 p.m. Some rushed for phones while others hurried to the Waikiki bars. Everyone tried to pack as much fun into these six hours of freedom as they could. McAfee and “Zeke” Summers got a tour of the island from a friend. Savage toured Oahu by taxi. Mangan and another group went to the famous Royal Hawaiian Hotel on Waikiki Beach for drinks; later he walked the beach and was disappointed that it was all gravel and rocks. Some bought Hawaiian clothes, and some purchased cameras with which to take pictures to send home. Stephenson, unfortunately, missed meeting up with his younger brother Clyde, who was stationed on the USS California at Pearl Harbor, because his battleship was out at sea; the brothers had last seen each other during the summer of 1938. After mailing the letters to Ann and calling her, Stephenson and others returned to the ship loaded with “hair tonic” for their nightly “slug” parties. Bender and friends wandered into a bar for some refreshment, had a few drinks of gin and coconut milk, and after enough of this libation, thought it good enough to help out for the rest of their cruise. They purchased a case of gin and a bag of coconuts. Although they believed that they had enough to last the rest of the trip, they were spotted coming up the gangplank with their purchases, and their room became the place to be for a few days.

Blackouts to Manila By the time the men of the 27th slept oﬀ the eﬀects of their six-hour shore leave, they noticed distinct diﬀerences during the ensuing fourteen-day journey to the Philippines. The air was warmer, the seas calmer, and the two army 32

nurses onboard suddenly got better looking—a rumor soon spread that the two women were movie stars Greta Garbo and Betty Grable incognito. But something else was also distinctly diﬀerent. The convoy, which included the transport ship USAT Winﬁeld S. Scott, loaded with tanks and men of the 192nd Tank Battalion, was now being escorted by the cruiser Louisville because of suspected Nazi submarines or raiders in the Paciﬁc. Blackout conditions prevailed at night. All portholes, windows, and doors were covered, and there was no smoking on deck. To aid in identiﬁcation, men had to draw a silhouette of the escorting cruiser. Everyone, however, was a bit more on edge after the Louisville suddenly left the convoy one day. Hubbard in his memoir wrote: “the Louisville one afternoon heeled over and went roaring oﬀ at full speed toward a small dot on the southern horizon. Word spread that it was a Nazi Raider and everyone crowded on deck to watch a gun battle, but nothing happened.” The Nazi raider turned out to be the Norwegian ship M. S. Talisman. Because of Stephenson’s earlier overseas military experience, when his turn came to lecture, he was assigned to familiarize the men with the Philippines. He might have started by reminding them that Adm. George Dewey’s victory in May 1898 over the Spanish forces in Manila Bay during the Spanish-American War contributed to the United States obtaining the islands. By December of that year, the Treaty of Paris ended hostilities, and as part of the deal, Spain sold the Philippines to the United States for twenty million dollars. To preserve America’s interest, a military presence became necessary. After a recent decade or so of harmonious relationship between the two countries, leaders on both sides of the Paciﬁc believed that the Philippines were ready for independence. In 1934 Congress passed the Tydings-McDuﬃe Act, which called for a transition to full independence over a ten-year period. During this time, the U.S. military would be allowed to maintain army and naval bases as it saw ﬁt. Stephenson likely told them that his old unit, the 31st Infantry Regiment, was stationed at Fort McKinley there. After the inauguration of Pres. Manuel Quezon in November 1935, the challenge of preparing a Filipino military to withstand foreign aggressors fell into the hands of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who had left his position as U.S. Army chief of staﬀ in Washington, as a four-star general, to become the military advisor to Quezon. As military advisor he was still on active duty with the U.S. Army, but his new rank was now only major general (two stars). MacArthur, with the help of his handpicked staﬀ oﬃcers, Maj. Dwight D. Eisenhower and Maj. James B. Ord, devised a ten-year plan to signiﬁcantly upgrade the military of the new Filipino government. Some doubted at the 33

OPERATION PLUM

time that it could be done. Two years later MacArthur retired from the U.S. Army and shortly thereafter was made grand ﬁeld marshal of the Philippine Army, charged to continue the army’s development. With the passage of the National Defense Act, MacArthur envisioned that in ten years a strong Filipino army, quick torpedo boats, and fast dive bombers would make an invasion so costly in lives lost on the beaches that no foreign country would dare attack the islands. Up until the summer of 1941, U.S. Army units in the Philippines and the Philippine Scouts were part of the U.S. Philippine Department. The Philippine Army, which MacArthur commanded, remained separate, though over time many American oﬃcers served in advisory positions in its newly formed units. By 1940 thirty thousand Japanese citizens were living in the Philippines. Many were working undercover for the Imperial Japanese Army Headquarters, posing as businessmen, servants, and tourists. President Quezon would recall that “only later did I discover that my gardener was a Japanese major and my masseur a Japanese colonel.” About half of the Japanese males living in Manila were Japanese military reservists. Commercial planes of Nippon Airways, manned by military pilots and observers, ﬂew seven photographic missions over Luzon in November and December 1940. Extensive aerial photo reconnaissance included potential landing areas for invasion operations. Why were the Philippine Islands important to the Japanese? In order to secure the oil ﬁelds in the Dutch (or Netherlands) East Indies, Japanese military planners knew they had to capture the Philippines because the American units based there would be a threat to Japan’s ﬂanks as its troops proceeded south to invade Southeast Asia. They also wanted to seize the Philippines to facilitate air and sea travel between these new conquests and Japan proper. In addition, they intended to use the islands for intermediate staging areas and supply bases, which would facilitate military operations farther south. Because of the continuous breakdown in negotiations between Washington and Tokyo, most suspected that war in the Paciﬁc would eventually happen. The only question was where and when. What the men of the 27th were really concerned with, however, was where were their planes? They fully expected their dive bombers to be with the convoy escorted by the heavy cruiser USS Pensacola and were conﬁdent that the planes were right behind them. What they did not know was that the Meigs, loaded with their planes and ammunition, was still in port in San Francisco on November 13. By the time the 27th reached Manila, the Pensacola convoy, which included the Meigs, still had not reached Honolulu. 34

“This Rumor Has Gone Too Far!”

In hindsight, military overconﬁdence and unpreparedness hindered the U.S. war eﬀort from the start. Sims remembers some of the 27th enlisted men saying, “If we get into a war, we will just have to tear them a new one.” Another private remembered: “Nervous about Japan? No! Our own propaganda had us pretty well convinced we could whip the little myopic bastards in a couple of weeks when, not if, they attacked.” McAfee, in his diary entry of November 18, noted a word of caution: “There has been a great deal of discussion about the U.S. and Japan. Most everyone seems to believe that the U.S. has Japan licked and that irritates the hell out of me. Japan’s Navy is bound to be bigger than ours out here and that could decide the issue. The darn Japs ought to know that if I do. [If war breaks out], it will take airplanes, big naval concentrations, and lots of guys with guns.” None of these necessary items was in great supply in the Philippines in November 1941.

War Plan Orange and Rainbow 5 Military strategists had argued for decades about what to do with the Philippines in case of war with Japan. The Joint Planning Commission of the War Department had plans in place for potential wars with various countries. Each potential adversary and subsequent war plan was assigned a color code name. War Plan Orange (WPO) become the code name for a possible conﬂict with Japan. One contingency of WPO called for American and Filipino troops to retreat to the Bataan Peninsula if there were a successful Japanese invasion of Luzon, the main island of the Philippines. Accordingly, food, ammunition, and medicine were stored there. While Bataan protected the nearby fortiﬁed island of Corregidor, Corregidor in turn protected the entrance to Manila Bay, and if the U.S. held both, any Japanese attack would be costly. The battle for Bataan would be a defensive one as the Japanese struggled against not only the American and Filipino troops but also the rugged mountains and dense jungle terrain. Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy would steam from Pearl Harbor, sink the Imperial Japanese Navy in the South China Sea, and within six months enter Manila Bay to save the ﬁghters on Bataan. Although this looked good on paper, many naval experts said that realistically it would take two years, not six months, to reach Manila Bay. MacArthur thought that War Plan Orange was too conservative. He visualized the American and Filipino troops defeating the Japanese on the beaches; many scoﬀed at this overconﬁdent assessment. But to fulﬁll his plan, MacArthur needed additional air power. To help defend the beaches during an invasion, Army Air Corps leaders in Washington sent dive bombers— 35

OPERATION PLUM

the 27th Bombardment Group. Also included in the September voyage of the Coolidge were New Mexico’s 200th Coast Artillery and the 194th Tank Battalion to provide protection for the airﬁelds. MacArthur fully expected the Japanese invasion to come in April 1942, and by that time everything he needed to defend the Philippines would be in place. In contrast to the color war plans, the Rainbow war plans contemplated confrontation with multiple enemies versus a single foe. In January 1941 the United States and Great Britain had held secret meetings in Washington to discuss strategies for the impending world conﬂict. They decided that Germany, not Japan, was the main enemy. Victory in Europe would come ﬁrst. Rainbow 5, which was the plan the United States was adhering to by the summer of 1941, called for the protection of the Western Hemisphere and ultimately sending task forces to the eastern Atlantic, Africa, and/or Europe. Army and naval forces already positioned in the Paciﬁc would therefore have to ﬁght the Japanese with whatever supplies and reinforcements could be spared. The War Department, however, turned its policy 180 degrees regarding the defense of the Philippines in the summer of 1941 after they realized that the B-17 bombers just coming oﬀ the assembly lines had suﬃcient range to strike southern Japan from bases in the northern Philippines. Now they decided to develop the Philippines as an oﬀensive base from which to threaten the Japanese mainland with these long-range bombers if Japan did not stop its southern aggression. The War Department therefore started a rapid buildup of men and materiel there. During this time, the War Department made an important change in the command of the Army Air Corps, giving Hap Arnold much more power. Prior to this, the chief of the Army Air Corps was in charge of procurement, training, and supply, while the chief of the General Headquarters Air Force was in charge of operating and directing air-combat units. Neither man had authority over the other, and both reported directly to the chief of staﬀ of the army. In June the U.S. Army Air Forces was created by combining the Combat Command (formerly the General Headquarters Air Force) and the Army Air Corps. The new organization was placed under the command of Arnold. Also in June the Japanese military decided to set up bases and airﬁelds in southern Indochina and Thailand, even if that action “risked war with Britain and the United States.” Then, following negotiations with Vichy France, more than forty thousand Japanese troops began occupying French Indochina without incident on July 25. 36

“This Rumor Has Gone Too Far!”

On July 26 President Roosevelt issued an executive order freezing Japanese assets in the United States, thus halting all trade with Japan as well as banning its ships from using the Panama Canal. This was mainly an oil embargo, however, and was followed by similar restrictions by the British and Dutch. American leaders thought this would force the Japanese either to drop their long-term aggressive strategy in Southeast Asia or to seize the Dutch East Indies to meet their oil needs—a move that would lead to war. As part of this get-tough policy by Roosevelt, a new army command was created in the Philippines, the U.S. Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE). On July 26 sixty-one-year-old MacArthur was called back to active duty in the U.S. Army, quickly promoted to the rank of lieutenant general (three stars), and given command of the USAFFE. In August the Philippine Army, which MacArthur had so recently headed and belonged to the Philippine Commonwealth, was inducted into the service of the United States. MacArthur had known about Washington’s war plans all along and wanted Rainbow 5 changed to allow him to defend all of the Philippines, not just the Manila Bay area. Thus he was delighted to learn in November 1941 of the revision of Rainbow 5 allowing him to do just that. Estimates of army strength that month ranged from 120,000 to 130,000 troops, of which about 31,000 were U.S. Army troops. This contingent contained many types of units, including the 27th Bombardment Group and all other Army Air Corps commands. The only infantry unit consisting entirely of Americans was Stephenson’s old 31st Regiment, which had 2,100 men. The 11,957 men of the Philippine Scouts, considered fearless ﬁghters, were part of the U.S. Army and had American oﬃcers commanding the Filipino enlisted men. The other 90,000–100,000 troops were members of the Philippine Army. Many of them were poorly equipped and poorly trained, some havi
