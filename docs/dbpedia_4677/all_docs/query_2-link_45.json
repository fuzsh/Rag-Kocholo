        "text": "“Every problem, it seems to me, is more difficult to meet when it must be met in a glass house.”\n\nJoan Bennett, The Bennett Playbill\n\nJoan Bennett and Walter Wanger\n\nLobby Card for \"The Woman in the Window\" (1944)\n\nJoan Bennett was one of the most successful actresses of Hollywood's Golden Age. She rivaled Gloria Grahame as the queen of Film Noir, cast by Fritz Lang as his femme fatale in The Woman in the Window (1944) and Scarlet Street (1945). Unfortunately, her career was derailed by scandal in 1951. Her husband, the producer Walter Wanger, suspected she was having an affair with her agent, Jennings Lang, so he shot him. It became a notorious Hollywood scandal, and her career never recovered. His did. Even with his greater culpability, Wanger served a nominal jail sentence and returned to producing hit films.\n\nIs this an example 1950s-era chauvinism? Probably. It also mattered on which direction of the camera Mr. and Mrs. Wanger found themselves. Image was then (and now) of utmost importance to that magical elixir that transforms an actor or actress into box office gold. Yet, it does not seem fair that though Bennett and Wanger were living in the same home, only hers was made of glass.\n\nThe copy of The Bennett Playbill that Joan Bennett signed to her The Woman in the Window director, Fritz Lang, is available via James Pepper Rare Books, Santa Barbara, California.\n\n\"The Bennett Playbill\" Signed to Director Fritz Lang\n\n\"The Bennett Playbill\"\n\nEpilogue.\n\nJoan Bennett was from a theatrical family five generations-deep, whose fortunes were entwined with another famous—albeit notorious—theatrical family: that of John Wilkes Booth. A daughter she had by Wanger—Shelley Wanger Mortimer—defied the family legacy, steering clear of acting. Instead, she became an editor (currently at Penguin Random House) and is considered \"one of the most respected, serious editors in New York.\"\n\n“That’s the trouble with you American husbands—you’re so kind to your wives that they lose interest in you.”\n\nGene Markey, Stepping High\n\nIt is chronologically impossible that Gene Markey was referring to himself when he wrote about this flaw with American husbands in his 1929 novel Stepping High. In that year, he was just then becoming a popular man about town in Hollywood and had not yet begun his starstruck marital career that saw him wed (and divorce) three of filmdom’s most popular actresses:\n\nJoan Bennett (1932 to 1937)\n\nHedy Lamarr (1939 to 1940)\n\n​\n\nMyrna Loy (1946 to 1950)\n\nJoan Bennett, Gene Markey, and Daughters (1936)\n\nHedy Lamarr and Gene Markey (1940)\n\nMyrna Loy and Gene Markey (1948)\n\nIn 1952, Markey forsook California for the greener pastures of Kentucky (literally and figuratively). There, he remained happily married to the doyenne of Calumet Farms—the former Mrs. William Wright—for the remaining three decades of his life.\n\nIn addition to writing novels and marrying well, Gene Markey was a gifted caricaturist. We currently are offering for sale an inscribed copy of Stepping High in which Markey has sketched a self-portrait. We also have a book of delightful literary caricatures by him, Literary Lights, A Book of Caricatures. It include portraits of F. Scott Fitzgerald, John Dos Passos, H.L. Mencken, Carl Van Vechten, and others."
