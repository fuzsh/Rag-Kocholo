        "text": "Cindy Bennett, a longtime resident of Bowie, MD was called to heaven on January 29, 2020. She was born September 4, 1962 in Baltimore MD. She was the daughter of Richard Bennett and Irma Carncross and was the beloved step daughter to Victor Carncross. She was the youngest of seven siblings who lovingly nicknamed her “Nin”.\n\nCindy’s greatest joy in life were her three children and three granddaughters. She was a devoted mother who gave everything she had to bring happiness to her children. Although it is difficult to put her love into words, her children agree that she gave them a constant feeling of unconditional love and acceptance. In her eyes, her children were perfect and she lived everyday of her life instilling that feeling of self-worth into them.\n\nCindy saw the best in everyone. She was a magnet for those with insecurities and hard ships and instantly became a mother figure to so many. She was selfless in her acts and never hesitated to buy someone a meal, give her last dollar, provide a shoulder to cry on, or an open embrace to hug. At times she got less than she deserved but always gave more than she had.\n\nShe had an artistic eye and was very creative. She drew and painted beautiful pictures. She also found joy in sewing and loved to make quilts. She loved music and nature and appreciated the beauty in so many things.\n\nShe is survived by her three children, Katie Quader, Tony Fulginiti, Danny Fulginiti; her son-in-law Brett Quader; her granddaughters, Jenna Nuth, Madison Quader, and Molly Quader; and her six siblings, Debbie Boryenace, Eddie Taylor, Lou Kraus, Becky Wiedmaier, Kathy Hall, and Rick Bennett.\n\nHer family finds peace in knowing that her soul has been reunited with her mother, who was her best friend.\n\nFamily will receive friends on Thursday February 6, 2020 from 5:00pm to 7:00pm at Beall Funeral Home, 6512 Crain Hwy (Rt. 3 South), Bowie MD 20715."
