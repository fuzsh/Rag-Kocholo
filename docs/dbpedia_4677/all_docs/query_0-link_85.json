        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe image features a 20-year-old Lionel Messi, already a rising star at Barcelona, holding a six-month-old Lamine Yamal. Today, Yamal, at just 16, has become a soccer sensation for both Spain and Barcelona. The photo, captured by Joan Monfort, was taken in the dressing room of the Camp Nou stadium in Barcelona, Spain, and has now gone viral. In addition to the sentiment and admiration sparked by the photograph, people online are affectionately referring to the moment as \"baptised by GOAT.\"\n\nA heartwarming photo taken in September 2007 has taken the internet by storm. The image features a 20-year-old Lionel Messi, already a rising star at FC Barcelona, holding a six-month-old Lamine Yamal. Today, Yamal, at just 16, has become a footballing sensation for both Spain and FC Barcelona.\n\nThe photo, captured by Joan Monfort, was taken in the dressing room of the Camp Nou stadium in Barcelona, Spain, and has now gone viral. In addition to the sentiment and admiration sparked by the photograph, people online are affectionately referring to the moment as \"baptised by the GOAT.\" GOAT, or Greatest Of All Time, is a term of endearment bestowed upon the Argentine forward by footballing fans worldwide given his achievements in and contributions to the sport.\n\nMessi and Yamal are currently making headlines for their performances in the Copa America and Euro 2024, respectively. Messi recently scored Argentina’s second goal against Canada, securing their spot in the final. Meanwhile, Yamal became the youngest scorer in a Euro, netting a sublime shot in the 21st minute in the semi-final against France.\n\nThe backstory of the photo is just as captivating. It was taken for a charity calendar nearly 17 years ago and resurfaced when Yamal’s father posted it on Instagram with the caption, “the beginning of two legends.”\n\nFreelance photographer Joan Monfort recounted the photo shoot, which took place in the visitors’ locker room at Camp Nou in the fall of 2007. The shoot was part of an annual charity drive by local newspaper Diario Sport and UNICEF, where Barcelona players posed with children and their families.\n\nYamal’s family won a raffle organised by UNICEF in their neighbourhood of Roca Fonda in Mataro, allowing them to participate in the photo shoot with Messi.\n\nMonfort recalled the challenge of the assignment, particularly because Messi, known for his introverted nature, was unsure how to interact with baby Yamal, who was in a plastic tub for the shoot.\n\n“Messi is a pretty introverted guy, he’s shy,” Monfort said. “He was coming out of the locker room and suddenly he found himself in another locker room with a plastic tub full of water and a baby in it. It was complicated. He didn’t even know how to hold him at first.”\n\nAt the time, Messi was already seen as a prodigious talent, but it would take a few more years for him to establish himself as the preeminent player of his generation. Similarly, Yamal has progressed through Barcelona’s renowned La Masia youth academy and has been one of Spain’s standout players at Euro 2024.\n\nYamal will celebrate his 17th birthday the day before the final in Berlin.\n\nMonfort, who has been a sports photographer since 1991, had no idea the baby in the photos was Yamal until a friend alerted him as the images went viral. Reflecting on the newfound excitement surrounding his photos, Monfort said, “It’s very exciting to be associated with something that has caused such a sensation. To tell you the truth, it’s a very nice feeling.”\n\n(Inputs from agencies)\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n10 stocks that can defy the yen upheaval, as Sensex comes out of Dow shadow\n\nThree reasons why Mumbai, NCR beat Bengaluru in the IPO treasure hunt\n\nWhy Akasa’s losses are mounting when IndiGo is posting record profits\n\nIs the great Indian snacking boom slowing down finally?\n\n3 key things Nirmala Sitharaman can do to restore Buddha’s legacy, draw global tourists\n\nAnalysing Hindenburg’s three key allegations against Sebi’s Madhabi Buch\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
