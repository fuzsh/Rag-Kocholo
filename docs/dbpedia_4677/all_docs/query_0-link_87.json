        "text": "On the first day Rancho Palos Verdes hosted an information center to help residents impacted by landslide-forced natural gas shutoffs, the mood was one of mutual aid and community building.\n\nAfter 135 residents in the Portguese Bend neighborhood suddently lost their Southern California Gas Co. service last week, RPV had just days to organize assistance for residents.\n\nCity officials and staffers pulled together emergency preparedness resources from Los Angeles County, state agencies and nonprofits on Tuesday, Aug. 6. City staffers from the Planning Department were on hand to help residents navigate a switch from one fuel source to another.\n\nAnd more than a dozen vendors — from propane companies to solar vendors to plumbers — set up on tables lining the Ladera Linda Community Center’s main room to offer their services on Tuesday.\n\nThose various agencies and organizers will also be available on Thursday.\n\nThe cast of characters included emergency experts, engineers, contractors, building and safety staffers, mental health advocates and government officials. Also playing a starring role were residents themselves, some of whom came early to help organize the event.\n\nAnd all of those people, said RPV Mayor John Cruikshank, are dealing with things they’ve never dealt with before.\n\n“We’re all trying to work together as a team,” said Cruikshank, who was on site to offer assistance and media interviews. “And that’s what really makes me proud.”\n\nThat solidarity showed up in Tim and Joan Kelly, who arrived early to the six-hour open house to help set things up.\n\nThe Kellys, 30-year residents in the Portuguese Bend Community Association, live on Fruit Tree Street — one of the lesser-impacted streets, according to Tim. There are no fissures in his yard and minimal impact to his residence, but he’s still concerned.\n\n“I’ve got a good seat on the deck of the Titanic,” Tim Kelly said about his situation and that of his neighbors.\n\nEveryone in PBCA is nervous, he added, and coming together at the information center was a good idea to quash rumors and to dissemimate quality information.\n\nThe retired mechanical engineer said he doesn’t have to worry about his own home. About two months ago, Kelly converted his gas water heater and gas range to solar. He’s planning to change out his gas furnace for an electric heat pump next. He’ll spend tens of thousands to do that, he said.\n\n“We’re all concerned about our neighbors,” he said.\n\nThere’s a huge sense of community spirit, he added.\n\nSheri Hastings was also on hand to assist with vendor setup. She lives on Vanderlip Drive and was one of the homes that lost gas and electricity, along with the former Vanderlip Estate, last month. She also had already converted to solar power, but was keen to share her story of losing a $300,000 horse barn on her four-acre property because of a fissure that runs through her property.\n\nHastings stopped by a propane company’s booth to chat. A worker at that booth, Pattee Olsen, said she knocked on PBCA doors the day after residents lost gas service.\n\nSo many Portuguese Bend residents just referred her to others, Olsen said.\n\n“The neighbor down the street, she’s paralyzed. Go help her first,” was one of the responses she said she received.\n\nThat resilence and charity have also been visible on Sunday evenings when PBCA homeowners bring lawn chairs, beverages and notebooks to a corner of their neighborhood for an aid session organized by one resident.\n\nAmong those who have attended the neighborhood sessions is Suzanne Hoffman, who said the goal is to identify vulnerable residents and build a contact list. And everyone is learning from each other.\n\nHoffman met Nancy Kalthoff at the information center on Tuesday and the two swapped stories and similarities as they perused the solar and propane vendors.\n\nTo compensate for the lack of natural gas, Hoffman’s husband barbeques while she cooks side dishes in the microwave. She takes cold showers, she said, because, luckily, it’s summer.\n\nKalthoff showers at her gym five miles down the road. Any yet, neighbors who were once strangers have offered to let her shower at their solar-powered homes.\n\n“People I hardly know have offered me their showers,” Kalthoff said in disbelief.\n\nMany of the PBCA residents are dealing with losing gas service in stride.\n\nBut no one is more knowlegeable on the subject of the local land movement and its impact than Gordon Leon, who was also at the information center to corral vendors and offer support. Leon, a retired engineer and resident since 1999, is the chair of the Abalone Cove Landslide Abatement District, which works to pump out groundwater to slow the sliding.\n\nOn Friday, Leon and his wife will fly to Denver to coordinate buying a tiny home they plan to put on their property on Vanderlip Drive. They’ll live in the tiny home, he said, while he attempts to move his main residence about 500 feet away from a main fissure and onto a steel frame. That will cost about $200,000, he estimated.\n\nIt was his hope, Leon said said, that PBCA residents would take advantage of the information center and get educated. But mostly, Leon said, he emphasized to residents that the landslide is not something to be afraid of.\n\n“They should be concerned,” Leon said, “but not have fear.”\n\nThere’s just not an all-in-one solution for dealing with the land movement, Leon said.\n\n“There’s not a single product made for landslides,” he said.\n\nThe information center will be also be open again from 2 to 8 p.m. Thursday, Aug. 8, at Ladera Linda Community Center, 32201 Forrestal Drive, in Rancho Palos Verdes."
