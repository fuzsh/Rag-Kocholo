        "text": "Apparently a movie of this title is currently in production in Paris... -I know that a couple of the folk on this board will be delighted to hear that!\n\nOn a sadder note, the British actress who is playing Jane Birkin in the movie has been found dead at her Paris apartment...\n\nKeith\n\nLooks like they 'adjusted' the ears of Elmosnino, not ? 8)\n\nI've just returned from a few days in France, it never ceases to amaze & please me that you can't listen for a few hours to French radio without hearing his music or at least his name.\n\nclintrubber said:\n\nI've just returned from a few days in France, it never ceases to amaze & please me that you can't listen for a few hours to French radio without hearing his music or at least his name.\n\nHardly compensation enough for not going any 15 minute period without smelling horrible BO, though. . . :shrug:\n\nMike\n\nI can't wait to watch the film !\n\nI've just received the complete collection of all his albums, 17 cd's, just amazing, this guy was just a genius !\n\nConcerning the sound of his albums, most of the time it was at least very good.\n\nflaheu said:\n\nConcerning the sound of his albums, most of the time it was at least very good.\n\nI'm with you, I dig the early stuff for the nice sounding jazzy orchestration & the later stuff sounds good as well (until too many synths creep in )\n\nSingling out individual sounds, I like the sultry bass sound on albums like \"Histoire de Melody Nelson\" etc,\n\nmade me string a bass with flatwounds again, something I had never expected to do\n\nBe sure to check the work of JC Vannier as well, as I understood it he's the man behind the sounds & arrangements of albums like \"Histoire...\". There's for instance the experimental but very nice \"L'Enfant Assasin Des Mouches\".\n\nBye,\n\nPeter\n\nit never ceases to amaze & please me that you can't listen for a few hours to French radio\n\nif it could be true!!! :'(\n\nthis guy was just a genius\n\nhe was a great composer, that's true but...for those who know well the afro-american music (I'm a vynil collector), he took a lot from major artist of jazz/funk/blues.\n\nanyway, the're some major pieces of records from him...try to find (not easy) a record called \"madame Claude\" who is the lp of an erotic movie ...mainly instrumental and for those who knows the french, some joke with the titles of the songs.\n\ndiyfanatic said:\n\nhe was a great composer, that's true but...for those who know well the afro-american music (I'm a vynil collector), he took a lot from major artist of jazz/funk/blues.\n\nYep, nobody is perfect, as I understood he also took credit for work actually done by some of his 'sidemen', like JC Vannier, Alain Goraguer... guys with smaller ego's perhaps but still with enough remaining ego to stop collaboration at a certain point. Without doubt there are differing versions about this, but hey, in the end it all resulted in great music.\n\nWhile waiting for the movie, but sure to watch that 2DVD-box: \"D'Autres Nouvelles Des Etoiles\".\n\nThe rendition in B/W of La Noy√©e for instance is priceless: SG on mic & JCV on piano: very beautiful, yet at the same time hilarious because of the weird looks from SG, pretty much nuking the sensitive nature of the lyrics.\n\nBye,\n\nPeter\n\nI don't understand how anyone can stand that harsh mumbling voice, almost atonal, barely qualifies as singing.\n\nWorks well as an anti-smoking advertisement I guess.\n\nAdditional note,\n\nI've gathered there's is a kind of necessity mandated french school of mixing. Being that the language is rather difficult, they must mix all voices really loud, usually destroying a lot of the much more interesting instrumentation in the production. This pretty much applies to most french music with a vocalist, but especially anything older since they had to mix for lofi speakers.\n\nNow Serge, the mumbler that he is, must be mixed even louder, almost completely defeating the actual instrumental production. I guess this is an acquired taste.\n\nKingston said:\n\nI don't understand how anyone can stand that harsh mumbling voice, almost atonal, barely qualifies as singing.\n\n...\n\nI guess this is an acquired taste.\n\nHe certainly is an acquired taste. But hey, nobody said he was actually singing. I'm actually happy he doesn't. He did more ~singing on his first albums, maybe it was even singing there. But like say earlier Tom Waits work, it sounds more like anybody else, nothing special. Let's be glad people find an own route, and if it's at the 'expense' of leaving the route of like-things-should-be then that's no problem at all in my book.\n\nThe combination of broad orchestration & ~fully dry voice on top contributes to the assorted effect imho.\n\nLet's simply enjoy the music we each like & don't lose energy on things we don't like. I've for instance stopped buying-&-immediately-trashing piles of Coldplay-albums\n\nBye,\n\nPeter"
