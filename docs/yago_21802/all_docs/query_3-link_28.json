In the ’50s and ’60s no one more than BB personified the mix of youth, sophistication and specifically European sexiness better than Bardot. Her turn in Roger Vadim’s …AND GOD CREATED WOMAN (1956) kept the lights burning in countless art house theaters. As a screen subject she had a glowing, somewhat wild presence that was probably used to best effect by Louis Malle in VIVA MARIA (1965) and Jean-Luc Godard in CONTEMPT (1963). Even in her most crass commercial work she overflows the screen and redeems what might otherwise be unwatchable films.\n\nHere is a music video created for her 1968 television special. She performs the Serge Gainsbourg-written CONTACT. Interestingly, the French special was also aired on American network TV. Though it was not a ratings winner, Americans who saw it must have been thrilled and/or confused in equal measure."
