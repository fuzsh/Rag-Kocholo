Located in the Amazon rainforest, IKIAM is an international research center unique in the world. Here, researchers and students are inspired by the animal and plant world to find concrete solutions to local and global problems: major pollution, water treatment, energy, medicine of the future… For them, the answers to the planet’s ills are in the forest, and they only need a few steps to move from the laboratory to the study site. By combining their strengths and knowledge in synergy with local populations, these scouts will establish new advanced posts deep in the Amazon in search of invaluable scientific treasures."
