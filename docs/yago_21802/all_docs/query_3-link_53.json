        "text": "Souvenirs of Serge is Jane Birkin's ultimate declaration of love to Serge Gainsbourg. The mythical meeting between the two took place during the filming of Slogan at the end of the 60s. Since then, the couple have become inseparable, sharing a complicity that has remained even after their decade-long romance. Thirty years after their separation, Birkin delves into the memories she shared with Gainsbourg through a compilation of Super 8mm films - which she comments on with her characteristic honesty and tenderness. Souvenirs of Serge is a surprising portrait of the intimate side of the famous singer-songwriter, 20 years after his death."
