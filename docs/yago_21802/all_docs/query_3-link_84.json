        "text": "What’s that? Another film portrait of Jane Birkin? You may be experiencing déjà vu to 1988, when Agnès Varda directed Jane B. by Agnès V., a documentary that also covers the genesis of Kung-Fu Master!, conceived by Birkin and starring both Jane and Charlotte. Watching Varda’s mini-masterpiece is the perfect preparation for Jane By Charlotte, giving useful context to Birkin and their relationship—a skim of their Wikipedia pages for biographical details wouldn’t hurt, either.\n\nA startlingly intimate and personal film, Fernanda Renton writes on Letterboxd that Jane by Charlotte “felt like I entered a mom-daughter therapy session by mistake, but instead of leaving the room, I just pulled up a chair and watched…”. Pinpointing Gainsbourg’s direction, Ana sees in this “exactly what a debut feature should be: a raw, intimate, clumsy (not a bad thing) exploration of one’s obsessions, and I hope it’s not Charlotte’s last directorial effort, because she listens deeply and sees people for who they truly are. A very, very soft film.”\n\nWelcome, Charlotte, to your Life in Film! So we can get to know you both a little bit first, which movies starring yourself and Jane would you consider required viewing before watching Jane by Charlotte?\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg: I’d say Melancholia, not for my acting and not to get to know me, because I don’t think it’s very close to who I am, but it’s the film I’m the most proud of. Was that the goal [of the question]? I’m happy about that choice. For my mother, she won’t be happy if I say this, but when she started, she did comedies where she was so stunningly beautiful and sort of played stupid a little bit and she did it with such charm that it was really endearing. La moutarde me monte au nez [known as Lucky Pierre or I’m Losing My Temper] and La Course à l’échalote [The Wild Goose Chase] are films I saw when I was little that I’ve adored for such a long time.\n\nOf course, she’s done more serious work that she would be more proud of. I was surprised not to be shocked or embarrassed by the film Je t’aime moi non plus [I Love You, I Don’t]. It’s my father’s film that he did starring her and Joe Dallesandro and there’s a lot of sex. She’s very exposed, but it’s such a beautiful film. Thank god he was still alive when I saw it at eighteen so I had the time to tell him how much I loved it and how I admired his work. If I want to go serious for her, I’d say Je t’aime moi non plus, and for a not-serious film, I’d say La moutarde me monte au nez.\n\nThe new film follows closely in the footsteps of Jane B. by Agnès V., possibly operating as a quasi-sequel. Can you talk about the importance of the late great Agnès Varda in your life, both as a person and as a filmmaker?\n\nThe first film I saw of hers was Sans toit ni loi [Vagabond] with Sandrine Bonnaire. I adored this film. I saw it when it came out so I must have been fourteen or fifteen at the time, and it came out before Jane B. by Agnès V., so I admired her work before she entered our lives. Then I discovered a film that I loved called Cléo de cinq à sept [Cléo from 5 to 7] and I was just stunned by the film itself and Agnès’s personality. I was a teenager when she started shooting the documentary on my mum and I just hated the fact that there was a film crew in our house, morning ’til night, every day for a year. It was so painful. I remember just shutting my door and hating the whole thing. So I hated her for that. But in fact, she was quite funny.\n\nBesides Varda’s films, which documentaries mean the most to you? Were there any others that you used as points of reference when approaching Jane by Charlotte?\n\nThe one I think of because of the mother-daughter relationship is this crazy Grey Gardens. Thank god we’re not the same characters. I love that documentary and I did watch it again. The documentary that helped me during the shoot of mine was a documentary that Griffin Dunne did about his aunt Joan Didion. I’m not familiar with Joan Didion in the way American audiences are, so I discovered her work afterwards. It’s such a moving documentary because it’s her nephew filming her and you can see that there’s a really kind eye.\n\nWhen I was first shooting my film in Japan, we were at a breaking point and [Jane] said “I hated this experience, I want you to stop.” So I stopped, I respected her choice, but I didn’t understand what I had done so wrong. A few years later when she came to New York to visit, I showed her the footage that we shot for the Japan piece and she saw the emotion that you could clearly see was interesting. You could also see that there was something really awkward about it, but it wasn’t bad, and it certainly wasn’t unkind, so then she said okay, let’s start again.\n\nIt was thanks to watching the footage and also the documentary about Joan Didion. It helps when there’s a kind eye—there’s something very touching about the proposition.\n\nDo you have any films that you have fond memories of watching with your mother or father?\n\nI was taken to the cinema in London by my mother with my sister Kate when I was four to see Jaws and it’s the most terrifying experience because I was so young. To this day, I can’t really swim in the sea. It was the most horrific thing she could have done. She didn’t realize that it was a horror film, I don’t know what she thought. Anyway, she and Spielberg are responsible for my fear of the deep sea. Even swimming pools, sometimes. That’s the horrible thing about it, is that I’m a very good swimmer but not in a natural habitat.\n\nThat was my very fond memory of my mother taking me to the movies. My father never did. He was very famous, so going out was always a big deal. We went to restaurants and the stores, but never to the movies or theater. When my parents split in 1980, that’s when VHS started, and in his bedroom, he put a large screen that looked like a movie theater, it was so big. At that time, it was such a discovery to be able to pick films and what seems so banal today was incredible then.\n\nHe showed me every classic, every film that meant something to him. The Disneys too, the old ones that he had seen as a kid. The strongest memories I have are also of horror films, because he was very fond of horror, so we watched The Shining when I was quite young—I must have been nine or ten—and Carrie, A Clockwork Orange. Anyway, it was mostly horror movies, and mostly American and Italian films.\n\nWhat are some films that we wouldn’t expect you–Charlotte Gainsbourg, the star of tough-to-watch arthouse Lars von Trier movies, and a survivor of horror movies inflicted upon you—to love?\n\nSome Like It Hot is on the top shelf of comedies, I have a passion for Billy Wilder. [I also watch] all sorts of comedies that are done nowadays. Films that I can watch with my children mean a lot to me. My youngest is at an age where it’s incredible to start her film journey, to show her stuff that she’ll remember. I’m trying to navigate through the masterpieces—not too many masterpieces at once—and then the shitty stuff that’s always good to watch. My favorite film when I was young was always Grease and it’s a film I’ve shown my three children when they touch that age when they could be real fans. That’s a classic for us.\n\nWhat coming-of-age film characters did you relate to the most growing up?\n\nI was very affected by the children that I had seen in films. Taxi Driver of course. I don’t relate to [Travis Bickle]—it’s [Robert De Niro’s] performance that’s incredible—but Jodie Foster is an actress that I was watching, I was very focused on her acting. There was this young boy, the main character in a film by Luis Buñuel called Los olvidados [The Young and the Damned] and I was so in love with this character. I would brush my hair the same way as him. It’s funny how I related to boys the same way I did to girls.\n\nThere’s also another film, Jeux interdits [Forbidden Games], again with children, and Brigitte Fossey was the little girl, she was four or five, it’s a film I’ve loved since I was a child. I don’t know if that was the question because these were films that I grew up with and looking at those performances meant something to me. I never saw myself on screen.\n\nWhat do you feel is the sexiest, most erotic film?\n\nI adore Jane Campion, and before I saw An Angel at My Table I saw The Piano. I remember a love scene that was so incredibly sexual and the fact that it was shot by a woman made so much sense. I’d say that film, but it’s only one scene. I sort of remember Year of the Dragon. It’s very rare to know how to film sex scenes or erotic scenes [so it doesn’t] jump out of the film, I feel those are the most difficult scenes to shoot, so maybe The Piano is a good one."
