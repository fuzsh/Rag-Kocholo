It is a biopic of French singer Serge Gainsbourg.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film follows notorious musician Serge Gainsbourg's exploits from his upbringing in Nazi occupied France through his rise to fame and love affairs with Juliette Gréco, Brigitte Bardot and Jane Birkin to his later experimentation with reggae in Jamaica. It also incorporates multiple elements of fantasy, most significantly with the character called \"The Mug\", an animated exaggeration of Gainsbourg that acts as his conscience (or anti-conscience) at crucial moments in Gainsbourg's life. The film also includes many of Gainsbourg's more famous songs, which serve as the soundtrack to the film and often serve as plot elements themselves.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nEric Elmosnino as Serge Gainsbourg\n\nLucy Gordon as Jane Birkin\n\nLaetitia Casta as Brigitte Bardot\n\nDoug Jones as La Gueule (Gainsbourg's mug)\n\nDeborah Grall as Lise Levitzky\n\nMylène Jampanoï as Bambou (Caroline von Paulus)\n\nAnna Mouglalis as Juliette Gréco\n\nYolande Moreau as Fréhel\n\nSara Forestier as France Gall\n\nPhilippe Katerine as Boris Vian\n\nPhilippe Duquesne as Lucky Sarcelles\n\nGrégory Gadebois as Phyphy\n\nFrançois Morel as The Boarding's Director\n\nClaude Chabrol as Gainsbourg's Music Producer\n\nOphélia Kolb as The Model\n\nKacey Mottet Klein as young Serge Gainsbourg (Lucien Ginsburg)\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nLucy Gordon committed suicide while the film was in post-production, and it is dedicated to her.[4][5]\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes 73% of 78 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's consensus reads, \"It might be thinly written and messily made, but Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life is also appropriately glamorous and intense -- and powerfully led by a gripping performance from Erik Elmosnino.\".[6] Metacritic gave the film a score of 58 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[7]\n\nKenneth Turan of The Los Angeles Times enjoyed the film:\n\nUnconventional, imaginative, nothing if not audacious, Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life is a portrait of creativity from the inside, a serious yet playful attempt to find an artistic way to tell an emotional truth... the songwriter's life is heroic because he lived deeply in his own imagination and did continual battle with the personal demons who shared that space with him... Screenwriter Sfar's final word on his difficult, fascinating man is \"I prefer his lies to his truth,\" his dreams to his reality. It's not hard to see why.[8]\n\n[excessive quote]\n\nA.O. Scott of The New York Times gave it a mixed review:\n\n[M]uch of the best and worst of Gainsbourg— the chat show provocateur and the charismatic performer — can be found on Internet video sites, which makes Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life feel a bit superfluous. Its forays into his private life, including a brief, intense affair with Ms. Bardot and a long, tumultuous relationship with Ms. Birkin, are more dutiful than revelatory. And how can Ms. Casta and Ms. Gordon, both nimble actresses (and quite beautiful), be expected to measure up against real-life goddesses whose images remain ubiquitous and irresistible? The puppets and the music make Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life engaging, but it is also visually hectic and lacks either the dramatic intensity or the arresting insight that might have lifted it out of the pedestrian realm of the admiring biopic.[9]\n\n[excessive quote]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film was awarded 3 César Awards on 25 February 2011 including a César Award for Best Actor for Eric Elmosnino, a César Award for Best First Feature Film for Joann Sfar and César Award for Best Sound. It also received an additional 8 nominations.\n\nAward / Film Festival Category Recipients Result Cabourg Film Festival Swann d'Or for Best Actor Éric Elmosnino Won César Awards Best Film Nominated Best Actor Éric Elmosnino Won Best Supporting Actress Laetitia Casta Nominated Best First Feature Film Won Best Cinematography Guillaume Schiffman Nominated Best Editing Marilyne Monthieux Nominated Best Sound Daniel Sobrino, Jean Goudier and Cyril Holtz Won Best Production Design Christian Marti Nominated Globes de Cristal Award Best Actor Éric Elmosnino Nominated Lumières Awards Best Film Nominated Best Director Joann Sfar Nominated Best Actor Éric Elmosnino Nominated Magritte Awards Best Supporting Actress Yolande Moreau Nominated Tribeca Film Festival Best Actor in a Narrative Feature Film Éric Elmosnino Won\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
