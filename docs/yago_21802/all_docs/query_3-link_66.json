        "text": "“Sublime portrait of a poet in his own words.” – L’Express\n\nA stunningly edited collage of rare interviews, archives and sumptuous music portraying France’s most cherished enfant terrible, Serge Gainsbourg, narrated entirely by the artist himself.\n\nThe clumsy, ugly duckling son of a Russian Jewish cafe pianist went on to become the greatest French songwriter of modern times; director Pierre-Henry Salfati has painstakingly stitched together a wealth of footage to create a thrilling, poetic portrait of the man in his own words.\n\nThat rarest of biographical films – a biopic that allows the viewer to really get under the skin of a great creative mind."
