        "text": "The film looks at the construction of real projects with students, users, and architects themselves. Created by Chilean journalist Katerina Kliwadenko and Spanish architect Mario Novas the film has been featured at architecture exhibitions and presentations at universities in Brazil, Ecuador, France, Hungary, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the USA. The documentary will remain “on tour” at international film festivals until 2019, until it is released for individual viewing.\n\nWatch preview\n\nMore about the film\n\nThe project “Under Construction” was completed in 2016, with eight residences (totalling 400 square meters) restored in an abandoned building where tenants exchange their labour as a form of rent. Al Borde Arquitectos were invited to participate in the main exhibition in the 15th International Biennale of Architecture in Venice. Never before had an Ecuadorian studio been invited to showcase its work in the most important architecture exhibition in the world. The studio showed a series of projects and studios, all of them part of a unique “architectural movement” which seeks to address real issues, be part of society and change the established role of the architect.\n\nAl Borde Arquitectos have not only created their own niche for architectural production, but have gained substantial visibility in terms of shifting the parameters on what is defined as good architecture. Their form of architecture upholds local values with a heightened sensitivity to materials and human resources – and enhances social, economic, and environmental outcomes in the projects they develop."
