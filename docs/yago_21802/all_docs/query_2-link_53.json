Since 2010, this valuable ecosystem has been under the close custody of the Indigenous Council, which oversees its management and conservation in 10 communities. These communities, made up of 490 families and with a population of 1,900 people, are united in their mission: to safeguard the ancestral lands of the Awá people through judicious management of resources and the conservation of their rich cultural heritage. In an innovative way, the Reserve has adopted the concept of scientific tourism, encouraging the exchange of knowledge between researchers, tourists, students and the indigenous community. This has enriched the local economy and improved land management, but it also serves as a bastion for biodiversity conservation and safeguarding the cultural legacy for generations to come.\n\nRead More →\n\nFederación Mesa Nacional del Café – FEMNCAFÉ\n\nBy equator2017 |\n\nFEMNCAFÉ, comprised of 28 coffee associations, focuses on the economic, social, and community reintegration of the signatories of the 2016 Peace Agreement in Colombia and local communities.
