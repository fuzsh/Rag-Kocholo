        "text": "(music: Charlotte Gainsbourg â âIRMâ)\n\nâIRM,â with Beck.\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nI really love his writing style. I really respect his work so when I asked him I didn't expect him to say yes. We met up in the studio and he said, for the both of us, we'd have to see if it worked well together. We did three songs together, âHeaven Can Waitâ was one of the first ones. We realized that we had good musical chemistry Then I went back, and the album was made bit by bit at his house in Los Angeles. And at each stage, it took a new direction. I went to see him and I had just had a serious accident and had to do some MRI scans. I had done a lot of them. So I felt like the best way for me to personally involve myself in the album was to speak about that and make music about it. There wasn't a negative side to it because MRIs are reassuring now. So I really wanted to find a musical element to it. And Beck's response was that he couldn't think of something more exciting. Because he would start off with the rhythm and that's why the percussion album was important. The beginning of every song originated from a rhythm he had either recorded before and I saw the tracks being created with him and it really was magical understanding how he composed songs and how he wrote. That's one of the reasons why I didn't really try to write at that point. It was so easy for him, he'd go away with his notebook and come up with stuff just like that.\n\nGeraldine Sarratia\n\nI recall there being some parts of Apolinaire's poems sampled in âLa Collectionneuse.â\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nYes, because when he was writing he managed to put into words exactly what I meant. So I tried to find other sources of inspiration and direct him on other songs to make the album more personal. And Apollinaire was an easy one to delve into.\n\nGeraldine Sarratia\n\nSo we talked about your new album Rest, we've already heard two tracks. This time you worked with SebastiAn, a well-known producer in the French electronic sphere. He started off at Ed Banger Records and has done many projects since. He's worked with Philippe Katerine, Frank Ocean. How was it working with him? We're going to listen to two new tracks, not the two last releases though.\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nWhen I did the live performance, well the second one with Connan Mockasin, we got to know each other with Connan and he was convinced I had to write in French and he wanted to help me. So we started doing work sessions together, he was on the guitar. I had less inhibitions because he doesn't understand French. So I started trying to put words to his music. I left with a few songs I liked. But I knew, I mean not âbut,â just after that I started thinking about a new album. And electronic music had already become a vital element a long time ago. It's a style of music I love. And listening to SebastiAn and discovering his work, I realised that all the violence, brutality and orchestration in his songs, the very broad and brutal element to it, was what I wanted. And I wanted to see if my voice, that isn't very strong, would mix with that kind of universe. And some of my inspiration came from film soundtracks, that were all horror films with very heavy atmospheres.\n\nI went to see him, no, he came to my house. And our first meeting wasn't very promising. It's a shame he isn't here because we laugh about it now. He was very sure of himself and he was right in saying that I needed to sing in French that I should sing more like I did in my first album that I did with my father. You might say he was lecturing me. But I found him to be very charming in spite of that.\n\nGeraldine Sarratia\n\nA bit arrogant?\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nYes. He was playing a part, like all shy people do. I found that touching. Anyway, not a lot happened after that. I gave him a list of film soundtracks, there was some Georges Delerue in there too. There was a lot of music that people in the electronic sphere know about, like [Giorgio] Moroder. That kind of style. But there was also Psycho, more orchestrated pieces. And some classical music. There was also BÃ©la BartÃ³k that inspired me. My ambition was chaotic. He replied with, I think, five demos which were exactly what I was hoping for. It was all I had dreamt for. So I replied but... You know SebastiAn, he's really tough! He's really hard to catch, so we met several times. We had several work sessions, which weren't because we didnât get any results, and by that time I had recorded with Guy-Man[uel de homem-christo] the song âRest,â Which was just a side project, an encounter because I admire him a lot. He had a loop he wanted to show me. I started to write with Guy-Man, I used my personal notes, diaries.\n\nGeraldine Sarratia\n\nYour notebooks.\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nMy sister had just passed away, so we shortened it down and tried to abridge what I wanted to say. Looking back we did it in quite a naive way but it was very spontaneous. So that was done. After that I needed to leave Paris. I moved to New York. At that point SebastiAn finally understood we had to do the album then, and that he had to come. So he came and it finally took shape.\n\nGeraldine Sarratia\n\nHere is a snippet of one of the more electronic tracks.\n\n(music: Charlotte Gainsbourg â âLes Oxalisâ)\n\nSo to hear the rest you'll have to wait till the 17th of November. âLes Oxalis,â a song in French.\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nIt's one of the last ones we recorded. Not necessarily the last one, but... We wanted to make something more uptempo. And I really wanted to use that text with this song. And SebastiAn wasn't...\n\nGeraldine Sarratia\n\nIt's quite a sad text, right? Visiting a cemetery.\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nHe was scared I wouldn't take responsibility for it afterwards. And for me that's what the album was about. There are texts, they aren't all painful but... With some very personal and intimate content. And I wanted there to be a contrast with the music. Given the shamelessness of my texts I needed there to be a bit of modesty in the music. And I believe that SebastiAn really understood that and he made me understand that loss and grief could pass through violence and not just by indulging in one's own misfortune. And that's what I wanted to express with this album. That's the last song of the album. And after that the style is nearly, I would say disco. There is what you might call an antithesis Nut that's what I was hoping for.\n\nGeraldine Sarratia\n\nHere's another extract.\n\n(music: Charlotte Gainsbourg â âLying With Youâ)\n\nAnother one where here you aren't particularly gentle with yourself. It's âLying With You.â So âLying With Youâ is about your father's death.\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nYes, it's one of the first texts I wrote. It is what it is. My memory of him is torn between my childhood memories and that moment when I saw him dead. It is... I think I wanted to speak about him in a blunt way. And for it to be... It is a declaration of love but, I'm tougher in French than in English. And in English I'm a lot more affectionate, in the English choruses. So by speaking in English I could distance myself and embrace him and I used French to be a bit more vindictive. It was very important to me to be able to talk about that. There are some songs I wrote before my sister passed away. It became compulsive, I could only write about her. But I had tried to do so before, I had started this record beforehand. Yes, as if the necessity demands you to do certain things which gave rise to this record. Along with the trip to New York that enabled me to write because, even if I wrote this text in Paris, after that, I allowed myself to be shameless, self-critical yet still constructive. It's precisely because I was in an unknown place, completely isolated. I could rediscover myself and go through a sort of rebirth. I had to push myself into this new life. It's a mix of... It is a moment of my life as well. Even if it took 3 or 4 years it is still a moment of my life.\n\nGeraldine Sarratia\n\nIt's an excellent record in any case. We have reached the end of this lecture, we have finished our playlist. So now is the time if you have any questions, please let us know. Are we going to give the microphone to the audience or is there an extra one?\n\nAudience Member\n\nFirstly, thank you very much for this conversation. There is a song that really touched me in the IRM album that my father got me for my birthday, it was a few years ago, I was very young and at the time, there was a song I didn't understand. Since I now have the opportunity to ask, âLe Chat du CafÃ© des Artistes,â it's a song that delves into a very particular atmosphere. I believe the lyrics go... âIf you won't bury me...â I can't remember properly now I'm caught in the moment.\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nI'm not going to remember either.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI wanted to know if you remember the way you recorded it?\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nIt's not a song I knew of before, Beck made me listen to it. And I translated it for him. The lyrics are very strange. Mysterious yet trashy at the same time. I met the original artist, whose name is Jean-Pierre Ferland I think. In any case, I met him in MontrÃ©al. He is a Canadian artist. It was magical, but I love the original, you should give it a listen. There are children singing on it, it's quite lovely.\n\nAudience Member\n\nIf you wouldn't mind could I read you a poem I wrote for you?\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nOh really?\n\nAudience Member\n\nI don't know if I should read it?\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nOf course you should! It's very brave of you.\n\nAudience Member\n\nIt doesn't have a title yet. âA rasping cough, Along the cords, A vocal snack, a bitumen snack, On my tongue while yours, Naked in a surgical fog, Nothing left, over a drink, Not one bubble left, To rip the blindfold from my eyes. You fit me like a glove. You are here yet absent. Like the last sigh of a child, You absorb me. A sofa in the decor. The decor of my soul. A lie in a few sounds. A nightmare in a few gestures. I only have a few memories left. Don't steal them from me, Before my tears can avoid it.â That's it.\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nWell done!\n\nAudience Member\n\nCan I give it to you?\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nDefinitely. Can you tell me more about it? Thank you very much.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI wrote it just before I got here whilst listening to IRM, which is a really important album to me. And thank you very much for the new album.\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nThank you.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHello. I think your next album comes out late November?\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nNovember 17th, yes.\n\nAudience Member\n\nAre you going to do a live concert?\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nI would like to. I'm counting on SebastiAn, but today he didn't come when he was supposed to. I hope he'll be there when we are supposed to play together. I'd like to do it with him. And maybe one other artist. I'm hoping to find... I find that, I need more than just my own presence behind a microphone. It's not enough. I like there to be something more visual, for it to cost me. I like there to be an effort so I'm not sure how I'll do it, but I'm working on it.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThank you.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHello. There are so many questions I've been meaning to ask you but I've just chosen one. I've seen you live a few times. You sang âCouleur CafÃ©â and L'HÃ´tel Particulier. I'm disappointed because HÃ´tel Particulier is sublime and isn't on Stage Whisper.\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nYes, but, everything I performed live was rubbish, I didn't like it. I forced myself to do this record that I liked a lot less.\n\nAudience Member\n\nOk. So my question is why did you choose a cheerful song like âCouleur CafÃ©â from your father's work?\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nBecause it was a percussion track, which made sense with the album with Beck. That's why. And maybe it was because it was a more cheerfulâ¦ It was a pleasure to... I think my mother does that song too. Maybe before I did. Maybe I copied her. That's all, it's not my favorite song of his but it made sense when making this album and the way we made it with Beck.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThank you.\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nThank you.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI have a question about the music video for âDeadly Valentine,â that I really like. I was wondering why you didn't ask your mother to play the old lady?\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nI know, I know.\n\nAudience Member\n\nIt would have beenâ¦\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nYes, it would have been good. But I didn't dare ask because it was in New York, she was busy with her concerts. If I film my mother, I have filmed her since, I went to Japan, I started filming on my own, and I'll be able to do six video clips. It was a real challenge to begin with. I pushed myself and thanks to my friend Nathalie Canguilhem who pushed me too. Who assisted me throughout the whole project. Ever since, I have realised if there is one person I want to film, it's my mother. I went to Japan and followed her. I want to do something with it but it's not finished yet. There you have it. It would have been ideal to have her, but there you go. I didn't even talk to her about doing it.\n\nAudience Member\n\nOh yes?\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nNo. I was too reserved, I didn't dare.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHello Charlotte\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nHello.\n\nAudience Member\n\nWas âCouleur CafÃ©â an allusion to your father? He finished his shows with âCouleur CafÃ©.â\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nOk.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHe would finish on âCouleur CafÃ©.â\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nI think my mother ended one of her concerts with âCouleur CafÃ©.â\n\nAudience Member\n\nYes she did.\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nWell, there you go, I'm not very original.\n\nAudience Member\n\nCould you bring out your album a bit earlier perhaps?\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nI want it to be released too! I've been living with it for a long time now. But I'm happy because we need to do the visual part and I have been taking photos for it too. I have a much more active role for the first time. We have finalized the music and now we are finalizing the images. And November is the time necessary to achieve that.\n\nAudience Member\n\nPerfect, thank you.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHello Charlotte, I have a question. This time you wrote all the texts for the album. Could we hope that you make the music next time? That you play a bit of piano?\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nYes, I don't play the piano on this album.\n\nAudience Member\n\nNo, I mean on the next one. The 6th one.\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nThe problem is that I started off playing classical music, at the age of 9. I only know how to play classical music, I lacked the dexterity to try doing jazz and improvise. It's something I lack. Of course I'm tempted I'm tempted to just try some melodies. I'd love to be able to. I'd hope to one day, maybe not the next one. I do love collaborating, I love what emerges from an encounter. I feel like this album really is my album. But SebastiAn played along with me and lent me his personality because that is really a part of it too. There is his sense of humour. I mean, it's not a comedy album. There really is his personal touch to it. And I like using other people's personal touch.\n\nGeraldine Sarratia\n\nOk guys, time's up, thank you to you all.\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg\n\nThank you everyone and for the warm welcome."
