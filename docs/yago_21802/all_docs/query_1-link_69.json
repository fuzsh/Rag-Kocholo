        "text": "This interview was originally published on August 26, 2013.\n\nAfter Serge Gainsbourg met you, in 1968, he never appeared alone in a photo. We know that actresses attract photographers, but did Gainsbourg become Mr. Birkin by your side?\n\nNo, it's much more prosaic than that. I had just arrived from England. We were starting a life together. I think Serge simply wanted to introduce me to the French. Right from our first collaboration, he put me in the spotlight. On the cover of the album Je T'Aime... Moi Non Plus, he preferred to show my face... with my big teeth! It was a very conscious decision. He wanted me to be associated with this success.\n\nLater, when I took part in protests for abortion rights or against the death penalty, he was very concerned. It wasn't a question of conviction. I knew his ideas. But showing up at these rallies, which were unpopular at the time, seemed risky to him. I had to be a star that was accepted by the French.\n\nUntil then, Gainsbourg's success was mainly due to his female interpreters. What was it about actresses that so fascinated him?\n\nHe abhorred singers with powerful voices. He preferred Judy Garland to her daughter Liza Minnelli. [French TV reality musical program] \"Star Academy\" would have made him very unhappy. That's why he turned down Edith Piaf. He felt too sophisticated for her. \"You need guttural songs that come from the belly, whereas I play with words,\" he told her. Actresses, on the other hand... Their fragility, lack of confidence and professionalism were irresistibly attractive to him. From Michèle Mercier to Mireille Darc, he wanted them all.\n\nWhat about you?\n\nMy timing was perfect. I was 20 years younger than him. I amused him: He could play dolls with me, dress me up according to his fantasies.\n\nDid he have any female singing role models?\n\nYes, Billie Holiday, for her flaws. In the studio, he liked to direct his actresses, having them sing close to the microphone, in a whispered voice, as he did with Catherine Deneuve on \"Dieu Est un Fumeur de Havanes.\"\n\nNew\n\nLe Monde’s app\n\nGet the most out of your experience: download the app to enjoy Le Monde in English anywhere, anytime\n\nDownload\n\nYou met in May '68 [period of general strikes and massive student protests throughout France]...\n\nYes, I remember the big protests on Boulevard Saint-Germain. Then I went back to England. We had to meet again in June, to shoot the film Slogan. Today, there's a lot of sentimental stuff about that period. But we didn't think about May '68, and he certainly didn't. He didn't take it seriously. He was Russian! It seemed anecdotal compared to the October Revolution.\n\nHow would you define it?\n\nHe was a provocateur with a wildly romantic, Slavic-Jewish soul. From his mother, Serge inherited malignity, insight and humor; from his father, melodrama. It was an elusive mix.\n\nWhen he died, an English journalist said: \"In England, we have a clown,\" and he named Tommy Cooper. \"But is he also a poet? No.\" \"We have a poet,\" and he named Ted Hughes. \"But is he also an aesthete? No.\" \"We have a great aesthete,\" and he named David Hockney, \"But can he write songs? No. So, for these three reasons, England lacks a Serge Gainsbourg.\"\n\nThis combination of opposites made him unique, capable of telling Belgian or Jewish stories, while at the same time being a poet, perhaps the greatest since Apollinaire, with his very personal style of verse, and a songwriter whose lyrics exist on their own, even without music.\n\nOn its release, the Vatican called for 'Je T'Aime... Moi Non Plus' to be banned. Has its transgressive side made it a political song?\n\nIn spite of ourselves, this song was a symbol of freedom. I only found this out later. In countries under dictatorship, its brief broadcast opened a breach. For a month, it was played under Franco in Spain. It was also heard in Portugal and South America.\n\nBut Serge and I didn't realize it. This song had been written long before. Brigitte Bardot had asked Serge for it: a sexy song. In the end, she didn't sing it; I did. My aim was that no other singer should take my place in the studio with Serge!\n\nI sang with a very high pitch. He asked me to try a Chopin prelude, which gave rise to the song \"Jane B.\" Because, following the outcry over \"Je T'Aime... Moi Non Plus,\" Meyerstein, the head of the Philips record company, had summoned us. He told us: \"Listen, kids, I'm willing to go to jail, but for an LP, not for a single.\" The head of the Italian branch had already ended up in prison.\n\nSerge wrote \"Gainsbourg et son Gainsborough,\" \"Jane B.,\" and covered some older songs (\"Elisa,\" \"Les Sucettes,\" \"Sous le Soleil Exactement\"). The album, forbidden to minors, was sold wrapped in cellophane.\n\nYou sang like a church boy...\n\nYes, and Serge liked it a lot. This reading is even more disturbing in \"La Décadanse.\" This ecclesiastical side is supported: \"Dieu! pardonnez nos offenses/La décadanse/A bercé/Nos corps blasés/Et nos âmes égarées\" (\"God, forgive us our trespasses/The decadence/has cradled/Our jaded bodies/And our lost souls\"). Serge was looking for a hit. But it didn't catch on.\n\nYet, the song was released with a dedicated dance. We were convinced that everyone would adopt it. After three hundred years of face-to-face dancing, the idea was to turn your partner against you. It was comfortable, but above all very show-offish. A man shows off his wife to the woman in front of him, who is being held by her husband.\n\nAs a young actress who made her name in Antonioni's 'Blow up' (1966) and had just separated from composer John Barry, did you know Serge Gainsbourg when you arrived from London?\n\nNo, I even thought his name was Serge \"Bourguignon,\" the only French dish whose name I could remember. Offended, he offered me, in front of my mother, a little red-covered book, Chansons Cruelles. With this dedication: \"To Jane, a few cruel songs including 'Je T'Aime... Moi Non Plus.' Serge Gainsbourg. Missing here are the songs from Mallory, which I'll write for you, also Histoire de Mélodie Nelson...\" In 1968, the Histoire de Melody Nelson project was already in the making.\n\nThis collection of songs gave me an indication of the notoriety of the famous \"Serge Bourguignon\": He wasn't just anyone. Yet he loathed those songwriters who fancied themselves as poets. Without claiming to be the equal of Apollinaire, Baudelaire, Chopin or Rembrandt – who were his models, along with Alban Berg, considered to be the most modern of them all – Serge was very lucid about his place as an artist. He was a songwriter. But he had to be the best. He told me so after [French singer-songwriter Georges] Brassens' death. The best? \"Ah, [Charles] Trenet and [Léo] Ferré thank you for that!\" I retorted. \"But they don't write anymore,\" he replied.\n\nThat's right. Serge never parodied himself. He didn't set a style and never moved on from it. He had his jazz period, which people like but I don't, then the Manon period, the one I'm starting to like with that speaking voice, followed by a rose period that corresponds to my arrival and then a cubist period with Aux Armes et Cætera. His Gainsbarre alter ego then appeared. Finally, there's the American period: Love on the Beat and You're Under Arrest.\n\nBetween these albums lies Rock Around the Bunker. You never know where to place this one. And yet, what a record! \"Enfilez vos bas noirs, les gars/Ajustez bien vos accroche-bas/Vos porte-jarretelles et vos corsets/Allez venez ça va se corser/On va danser le Nazi rock Nazi\" (\"Put on your black stockings, boys/Adjust your suspenders/Your garter belts and your corsets/Come on, it's going to get tough/We're going to dance the Nazi rock Nazi\").\n\nNo document actually shows Serge Gainsbourg at his work table... Was it vulgar to exhibit this?\n\nListen: In the 13 years we were together, I never caught him in the bathroom or writing... He had a pure mind, he'd joke! At home, he felt too comfortable to work. However, on Rue de Verneuil, he had an upstairs bedroom that served as his office. But I never saw him there. He was an obsessive; he spent whole mornings tidying up. It was impossible to move even a pack of cigarettes.\n\nHe worked on my film shoots, in hotel rooms or on his knees. So my duds weren't for nothing! They allowed him to write. Serge insisted on coming along, because he thought the films were \"aphrodisiacs\" and feared I'd go off with a better-looking actor. Once there, he was bored to death.\n\nI remember a film in Oxford. I had booked a very nice hotel that I knew from my father, the Albert Hotel. Serge was writing Melody all day long.\n\nA few years later, I agreed to another shoot in Milan. Serge was furious when he saw the hotel I'd booked just outside the city. The bathtub, a shared one with no drain, was at the end of a long corridor. A construction site under our window was making a hell of a noise. So Serge rented the room opposite. There was a fire extinguisher. The album L'Homme à Tête de Chou was born there.\n\nDuring the day, Serge wrote. In the evening, he would join us for his show. Using pots and pans unearthed in the kitchen, he would become a one-man band. My brother Andrew would play along. It was laugh-out-loud funny. On these shoots, everyone dressed up. The boys would dress up as girls. And at the same time, Serge could burst into tears in a minute, as he had done for 24 hours in front of a candle in Paris, when he thought I was going back to England for good after shooting Slogan.\n\nDid he keep notebooks?\n\nNot a clue! On the other hand, he always kept reams of paper close by. Whenever he went off to write, he'd pack his briefcase with bundles of 500 francs bills, felt-tip pens and those A4 bundles. And his Parker [fountain pen], which he adored.\n\nYou deny any involvement in its creation. Yet you more than influenced the character of Melody Nelson. On this major album, you're featured on the cover photo... What was it about you that interested him so much?\n\nJean-Claude Vannier says Serge had always considered himself an old man. It's true, he was amused to be seen with a little girl. It didn't make much difference whether it was a boy or a girl; he imagined himself as Dirk Bogarde in Death in Venice. On the vacation films my parents shot, I look awfully like a boy. And he loved my body. He thought I was a Cranach. The character of Lolita and the \"poem\" Nabokov wrote for Dolores fascinated him.\n\nI wasn't Melody Nelson's age – 14 autumns and 15 summers – but I sure looked like it. All I had to do was hold my stuffed monkey \"Munkey,\" won by my Uncle Mike in a pub lottery and given to me as a present, over my pregnant belly!\n\nSerge nurtured his character through the super-8 films of my childhood. At my parents' house, he'd grill my mother so he'd know where to place the plot. My parents weren't from London, but from Sunderland. My mother thought it was \"so boring,\" but Serge liked the sound of the name. It was better than Nottingham, which sounded too sheriff-like for his taste. Then, with the discovery of Mondo Cane, Serge grafted this story of the Papuans of New Guinea's worship of airplanes onto his plot.\n\nDuring the 'Melody Nelson' photo shoot, he puts on your wig before you do. Is it like the passing of the baton?\n\nYou could say that, but you could also remember that he was a clown who loved to dress up as a girl. In fact, he made a beautiful album cover out of it, where he looks like his twin sister Liliane.\n\nDidn't he make you listen to his songs while he was writing them?\n\nHe wasn't the type to brag, to make people listen. Just a word or a rich rhyme could make him proud; that's all. I discovered his songs just before the recordings. Later, he relied heavily on his artistic director, Philippe Lerichomme.\n\nHe'd give me lyrics that I'd copy out phonetically, before throwing them in the garbage can! So there's not much left, apart from the drafts he produced, like this reconstructed manuscript of Je T'Aime... Moi Non Plus, which he gave to my brother Andrew.\n\nGainsbourg nevertheless kept a copy of the telegram he sent you from the Hotel Esmeralda, in 1968, when he thought you wouldn't be coming back from England. This resulted in a song, that he sang with Catherine Deneuve, in 1980...\n\nYes, \"Overseas Telegram.\" We'd just split up. That's when he suggested some new songs. \"But, Serge, I don't need to make a record,\" I said. \"I owe it to you,\" he replied. We spent a week together in the studio.\n\nThere I saw him working. He never slept, thanks to coffee and cigarettes, but not a drop of alcohol. On an illegible page, he presented me with titles. There was \"Les Dessous Chics\" and \"Fuir le Bonheur de Peur qu'Il ne Se Sauve.\" It was the first day. I had copied it phonetically and threw it away. Day two, another sleepless night, he arrived, even more exhausted, and released two more marvels, including \"Baby Alone in Babylon.\" Day three, still sleepless, he staggered in. He sternly threw out \"Une Chose entre Autres\": \"Une chose entre autres que tu ne sais pas/Tu avez plus que un autre le meilleur de moi/Je me démerde avec ce que je n'ai pas/Je suis passée à autre chose\" (\"One thing among others that you don't know/You've got the best of me more than anyone else/I'm making do with what I haven't got/I've moved on\").\n\nIn five days – Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday – he had written the entire Baby Alone in Babylon album. I wasn't with him anymore, but I could see how he worked as a creator.\n\nEven though you're separated from him, you still continue to sing it...\n\nFirst of all, it sounds terrible to sing about wounds you know you've inspired. Behind the studio glass, there was only one thing to do: sing as high as possible, even if it meant breaking my voice, so that Serge would cry not for the sadness but for the beauty of it.\n\nI didn't express it to myself at the time, but from that album, Baby Alone in Babylone (1983), then on to the following ones, Lost Song (1987) and Amours des Feintes (1990), this triptych nourished by our break-up, Serge gave me his feminine side to sing. He kept his provocative side, which he explored with his Rasta experiences and songs like \"The Boy,\" \"I'm the boy that can enjoy invisibility,\" the only one I know about homosexuality. By giving me this wounded side, he could do his Gainsbarre.\n\nYou recently told 'The Independent' newspaper that you knew what song would be played when you die: \"Je T'Aime... Moi Non Plus.\" Is it back to square one?\n\nIt's the one that will be played on TV. Despite everything else, it's the one people will remember. By the way, do you know this story? Lerichomme told it in an interview. It was during the recording of Aux Armes et Cætera, in Jamaica. At first, the musicians thought Lerichomme was the singer, and the older Serge the producer. Sly Dunbar and the Jamaican musicians were very casual with these white guys.\n\nBut, at one point, Dunbar told Robbie Shakespeare that there was only one French song that commanded his respect, the one with the moaning girl. Serge then exclaimed, \"Mais c'est de moi!\" (But that's me!) The Jamaicans couldn't believe it. \"Did you write that?!\" They were so enthusiastic that they performed all their musical parts during the day. Rita Marley came in the evening with her backing singers.\n\nThat's when Lerichomme said to Serge, \"Now it's your turn to play.\" Serge didn't have any lyrics ready yet. They had dinner at the hotel restaurant. Then Lerichomme took Serge back upstairs. Serge wanted to take Lerichomme's room because it was red. He laid out 10 blank sheets of paper on the bed, then knelt down with a pen. Lerichomme slipped away, leaving Serge with his back to him. The next day, he knocked on Serge's door. There was no answer. He entered and found Serge in exactly the same position as the day before, asleep, with the paper covered with his handwriting.\n\nLudovic Perrin\n\nTranslation of an original article published in French on lemonde.fr; the publisher may only be liable for the French version."
