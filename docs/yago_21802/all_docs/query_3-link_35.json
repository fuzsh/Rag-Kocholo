        "text": "If—as the director Ingmar Bergman once claimed—the most important image in the history of cinema is that of the human face, then the visage of Jane Birkin inspired a new zeitgeist of onscreen beauty. The British actor’s appearance in Jacques Deray’s 1969 film La Piscine was a cinematic coup de foudre. Birkin’s svelte cheekbones, expressive, almond-shaped eyes and slightly imperfect, gapped-tooth pout were neither the Platonic ideal of Greta Garbo nor the lyrical charm of Audrey Hepburn. Rather her face was a Baroque cathedral of angles and folds, angels and cherubs, that captured at once the sublime eroticism and starry-eyed naivete of the counterculture’s new religion of desire.\n\nIn her first film as a director, Jane by Charlotte (opening in New York this Friday and available to stream in May), Charlotte Gainsbourg—the celebrated French actor, fashion icon, and pop singer—trains a camera on her mother’s fabled face for a series of intimate conversations. What she presents is a private Birkin: the tentative maman of her childhood turned aging materfamilias, filled with generosity and humor but also beset by doubt and grief. Taking formal inspiration from the similarly titled Jane B. for Agnes V. (1988), Agnes Varda’s metafilm of Birkin at 40, Gainsbourg’s work is more cinematic portrait than traditional documentary. “The idea is to look at you as I never have before or have dared to look at you,” Gainsbourg explains to Birkin at the outset. “Filming you with a camera is basically an excuse just to look at you.”\n\n“A lot of the filming was daring for me,” Gainsbourg confessed over the phone to me last fall. Despite her storied, four-decade career in front of the camera for distinguished (and sometimes provocative) auteurs like Claude Miller, Wim Wenders, Lars von Trier, and Gaspar Noé, it was the prospect of documenting her own mother that gave Gainsbourg the most pause. “I’ve always been shy to even take a picture of her. We have this immense respect for one another, but that’s not what I needed. I wanted to be like my sisters”— the late photographer Kate Barry and singer Lou Doillon—“who have this very obvious connection between mother and daughter.”\n\nIn the film’s opening sequence, shot in Tokyo during Birkin’s 2017 world tour, Gainsbourg tentatively quizzes her mother on their mutual shyness. “You were intimidating as a child,” Birkin admits to her. “I felt privileged to be in your presence.” Gainsbourg was indeed a precocious child, having starred in three films (the second, L’Effrontée (1985), earning her a César Award) and released a debut album, Charlotte for Ever, with her father, Serge Gainsbourg, by the age of 15. But Birkin recalls a moment when, overcome by the need to commune with her teenage daughter, she asked to touch Charlotte’s nude body as a final gesture of maternal intimacy. “I knew it was the last time I could ever do that, and I wanted to be tactile with you.”\n\n“My mother hated [that first] experience filming,” Charlotte remembered when we spoke. Two years passed before they agreed to try again. In the middle of filming, Charlotte moved back to Paris after six years in New York City only to have the production stymied again by the COVID lockdown. “I went into a heavy depression,” she told me. “[But] I needed to shoot again. I went to film her in Brittany”—in France, where Birkin has resided alone for many years—“with no makeup artists or lights—just me holding my camera. And she was okay with everything. She would talk about death, pain, loss, her [cancer], everything. It was an incredible shift.”\n\nDespite the film’s ostensible focus on Birkin, Charlotte proves more than a simple interlocutor. She is equally mesmerizing onscreen, moving fluidly between roles both technical and emotional—sometimes sitting childlike at her mother’s feet and watching affectionately, other times gently pressing her about their shared past. “It’s a film about a daughter looking at her mother,” she said. “I have to be honest. It’s true—I filmed myself, I wanted to tell her things, so it’s also the way she listens that I wanted to get.”\n\nCharlotte captures the two of them in many intimate but unglamorous moments: wandering through Birkin’s seaside home among a lifelong collection of souvenirs (“I’m incapable of throwing anything away,” Birkin confesses); preparing a roast while musing on the inner lives of children; and cuddling in bed during a moving exchange about their shared anxieties and insomnia. These routines imbue the narrative with that peculiar French conceit of la vie quotidienne, a poetic celebration of the fanciful within the everyday. “I didn’t want to make another documentary about her with footage of her as a young woman—that’s not what I wanted to see,” Charlotte said. “I wanted to see her today like I see her onstage, which is with such charisma, something that is so powerful [and] transcends beauty.”\n\nIn another engrossing domestic scene, Charlotte invites Birkin back to Serge’s Parisian home at 5 bis rue de Verneuil, where the couple, along with Charlotte and half-sister Barry, had resided for a decade before Birkin ended the relationship in 1980. Although the address gained a debauched reputation as part of Paris’s 1970s party circuit, it was also the house of Charlotte’s childhood, where she listened to her father compose on the piano, obsessively watched horror films, and dreamed of ghosts. In the aftermath of Serge’s death in 1991, the wall outside of rue de Verneuil became a popular shrine to his memory, visited annually by thousands of fans. Inside, Charlotte began diligently preserving the house’s interior just as it was at the moment of her father’s death, including objects both big and small, from the black fabric walls to the Gitanes cigarette butts in the ashtrays.\n\n“It’s almost like being in a dream,” a pensive Birkin says as she roams the house’s dusky nooks and crannies for the first time in more than 30 years. “It’s like Sleeping Beauty.” After many years of planning, the house will finally be open to the public as a heritage museum, Charlotte added when we spoke. “Somebody told me the other day that I have to give up the keys.”\n\nThe past hovers over much of Jane by Charlotte. In addition to the passing of Serge, the sudden death of Birkin’s first daughter Barry in 2013 is a recurring topic of conversation between Charlotte and Birkin within the film and continues to bind them in grief. (Birkin’s most recent album, Oh! Pardon tu dormais…, is largely inspired by Barry’s life and death, while Charlotte’s 2017 record, Rest, contains the heartbreaking eulogy “Kate.”) In one of the most poignant scenes, Charlotte projects home movies of Barry as a child across a white wall behind Birkin, who tries to explain the insidious cycle of guilt that a mother endures for a dead child. “Even before it happened, I often had sleepless nights, worrying and wondering,” she says.\n\nCharlotte spoke candidly about the deep trauma that the family experienced after Barry’s death, one of the major reasons that she chose to exile herself from Paris until last year. As for her mother’s grief, she said, “She lost everything for a time. And [her humor] hasn’t come back entirely. But when I see her with other people, when she’s working, then she blooms again.”\n\nBut the film also reflects Charlotte’s anxieties over ghosts of the future, namely the specter of her mother’s death. “I didn’t want to end the shoot,” she admits, hoping the project’s continuation might forestall some imminent tragedy, much like the nightly tales of Scheherazade. “We just wanted to carry on as if we could go on forever.” When Birkin suffered a stroke in the weeks after the film’s Cannes premiere last July, Charlotte feared the worst. Birkin has now fully recovered. (Her 2022 European concert tour for Oh! Pardon… commences this week in Meaux, France, and includes a stop at New York’s Town Hall in June.)\n\nAt its heart Jane by Charlotte is a fascinating look beyond the conventions of feminine beauty or celebrity and toward the more enduring contours of motherhood—and how the passage of time and the loom of death can draw mothers and daughters closer. “The more I look at you, the more I love you,” Charlotte says in the film’s closing monologue. “I have always loved you. But it is so much clearer to me now. Why do we learn to live without our mothers? It seems to be a purpose in life: to free ourselves at any cost. I don’t want to free myself.” As she speaks, the camera captures Birkin walking along the seashore in slow motion, lingering over her to savor each remaining moment. A beautiful expression of cinematic portraiture, it is also a moving statement of a daughter’s love."
