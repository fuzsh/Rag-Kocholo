        "text": "And so, it seems that the string of biopics suffering from \"selective memory\" is set to continue.\n\nAs a slightly obsessive Serge Gainsbourg fan (but then, is there any other kind?) I was initially very excited when I found out about the forthcoming film of his life, Serge Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life, to be released next year. But after some research, I discovered that this may well be a film to file away with the disappointing recent stories of three other hero(in)es of mine: Dylan, Cash and Piaf.\n\nI'm Not There was, most people seem to agree, bafflingly half-baked and pointless; Dylan is an enigma, we get it – so why make a wilfully opaque film that, if anything, leaves the audience even more in the dark about its subject after the lights go up? When you start with the goal of mythologising him, as Todd Haynes did, all you're set up for is failure: there will be no trace of humanity. It's a cop-out and, worse, a lie.\n\nOf Walk the Line's flaws, the vilification of Cash's first wife, Vivian, was cynical, and the decision to end the story in 1968 was unsatisfying. Oh, and I was hugely let down to not see Cash being bested by the emu that reportedly once ventured onto his property - the funniest story in the history of popular music. And I agree with Peter Bradshaw that the decision by the director of La Vie en Rose to omit a crucial period of Edith Piaf's life in occupied France results in a \"formless and weirdly selective\" film.\n\nAccording to reports in the French press, A Heroic Life will span 40 years of Gainsbourg's life, up until the early 80s - which is a huge shame. This may seem an odd thing to say, given that it easily includes his greatest period of artistic achievement: his early chanson period, songs for other people (France Gall, Francoise Hardy) and classic albums such as Histoire de Melody Nelson. And, of course, it will cover his relationships with Brigitte Bardot and Jane Birkin, and myriad others, sexual or otherwise, with such luminaries as Catherine Deneuve, Juliette Greco and Isabelle Adjani. But what about the bad – and they really are bad – times that punctuated the last 10 or so years of Gainsbourg's life?\n\nI'm always incredulous when a story of a public figure is edited, and it seems to me that the director Joann Sfar, a French comic-book artist, is playing fast and loose with the truth of who Gainsbourg really was. In omitting the last years of Gainsbourg's life, Sfar is ignoring a number of key incidents: the infamous Whitney Houston incident, in which, on a French chat show in 1986, Serge made it explicitly clear to the host, Michel Drucker, what he wanted to do to fellow guest Houston; his setting fire, in 1984, to a 500-franc note on TV to protest against heavy taxation; and his proclamation to singer Catherine Ringer, again on TV in 1986, that she was \"nothing but a filthy whore, a filthy, fucking whore\". Not to mention 1984's duet with his 13-year-old daughter, Charlotte, Lemon Incest. In the words of Sylvie Simmons, author of the entertaining Gainsbourg biography A Fistful of Gitanes, \"its video, featuring Serge and Charlotte side by side on a circular bed, hit another 10 on the scandalometer\". (I actually quite like the song; rather than being pro-paedophilia, the lyrics are quite benign.)\n\nGainsbourg was a genius, and I have no doubt that he was, as Birkin and Bardot attest, a gentle and loving man who cared greatly about his family. But even if, as Ringer retorted to Gainsbourg's vicious verbal abuse, the man was in his last years \"a bitter old alcoholic\", and \"a disgusting old parasite\", to excise controversial and ignoble moments when telling the story of a life is to fail to capture the complexity of an individual.\n\nI will probably go and see A Heroic Life when it is released - I'll be fascinated to see, among other things, if Eric Elmosnino, a relatively unknown actor, can convince in an undoubtedly challenging role. And I'm also intrigued to see how successful the supporting female cast is (Laetitia Casta plays Brigitte Bardot and Anne Mouglalis is Juliette Greco, to name two).\n\nBut if you want the truth about a public figure, you're still better off reading a biography."
