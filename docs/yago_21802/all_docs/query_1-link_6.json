        "text": "In the 1930s Warner Brothers developed a serious line in earnest, inspirational films celebrating great scientists, liberators and social benefactors, usually played by Edward G Robinson or Paul Muni, dedicated to Longfellow's lines in his \"A Psalm of Life\": \"Lives of great men all remind us/ We can make our lives sublime/ And, departing, leave behind us/ Footprints on the sands of time.\" But Variety's contemptuous neologism \"biopic\" stuck, and biography has never had much standing in the cinema – unlike the literary world where, under the larger rubric of \"life writing\", it's a serious matter both to practise and study.\n\nOrson Welles's Citizen Kane in the 1940s and the Italian Marxist Francesco Rosi's Salvatore Giuliano in the 60s attempted to find an inventive form that would give cinematic biography the status of its literary equivalent. But while popular epics such as Lawrence of Arabia and Gandhi have won Oscars and provided prize-winning roles, critical condescension has continued almost unabated.\n\nRecently, however, as popular culture has come to be taken more seriously than it was when 20th Century-Fox made colourful showbiz biopics 60 years ago, a succession of movie lives of rock stars have done away with traditional narrative forms. Mostly made by independent film-makers, they've mixed documentary and fiction, fantasy and reality in an attempt to get at complex, vital truths: one thinks for instance of British pictures about Ian Curtis, Ian Dury and John Lennon, as well as Todd Haynes's American masterwork I'm Not There in which six different actors play faces and facets of Bob Dylan.\n\nTo this category belongs Gainsbourg, aka Gainsbourg (Vie héroïque), a portrait of the French singer Serge Gainsbourg (1928-1991). It's an altogether bolder film than La vie en rose which brought an Oscar to Marion Cotillard as Édith Piaf, though it too has a central performance, from Éric Elmosnino, that is remarkable both physically and aurally. It's the feature debut of the 38-year-old writer-director Joann Sfar, a comic-strip designer who, like Gainsbourg, was born in France of Jewish parents, and he finds Serge's \"Rosebud\" in his Jewish background.\n\nIn a pre-credit sequence the young child Serge (born Lucien) is rejected as \"too ugly\" by a little girl on a summer beach. The film then switches to his wartime childhood in German-occupied Paris. There he reacts against his father's ambition for him to become a classical musician, and against the authorities that force him to wear a yellow star pinned to his chest. He mocks and puzzles the French collaborators by the heavily ironic gesture of being the first to turn up and demand his star, before others start forming a queue. But the atmosphere of the time makes an indelible impression. From the antisemitic posters that line the streets two images continue to haunt him: a Humpty Dumpty grotesque and a mocking beak-nosed caricature that becomes his aggressive alter ego. The movie is rather vague in its treatment of the war, as about much else, though it does have a touching episode in which Gainsbourg lives secretly under the protection of a Catholic boarding school in the countryside, which evokes Louis Malle's autobiographical Au revoir les enfants, a key work in the cycle of French movies dealing with Jews during the Occupation.\n\nIn one of the best early sequences Serge's precocious interest in music, painting and sex come together when he attends a life class where he's supposed to keep his back to the nude model his elders are drawing. He subsequently chats up the model and takes her to a bar for a soft drink, where he encounters an elderly music hall chanteuse and exuberantly sings along with her to her biggest hit, a risqué number called \"Coco\". After the war the central role is taken by Elmosnino as the charismatic, chain-smoking, heavy-drinking Serge – lover, composer, performer in an ever-changing variety of genres and rebel with a mission to épater les bourgeois. His first two marriages don't figure in the film, chief attention being given to his affairs and collaborations with Françoise Hardy, France Gall, Brigitte Bardot and of course Jane Birkin. Laetitia Casta is priceless as Bardot, prancing around Serge's apartment wrapped in a sheet, charming Serge's parents. The late Lucy Gordon is a fetching, playful Birkin, and there's a highly amusing scene in the late 1960s when Serge's music producer (played by Nouvelle Vague director Claude Chabrol) tells them that their erotic duet \"Je t'aime… moi non plus\" (here, unlike most of the other numbers, performed in the original version) could land them in jail.\n\nThe self-destructive aspect of Gainsbourg is touched on impressionistically. The cops pick him up dead drunk in the street and transport him in a black maria not to jail but to a concert engagement. Most remarkably, we see him record his reggae version of \"La Marseillaise\" with a Jamaican group (as aggressively provocative in its way as Jimi Hendrix's treatment of \"The Star Spangled Banner\" at Woodstock). It's followed by right-wing veterans threatening to lynch him before being drawn into joining him in a straight version of the song.\n\nThis enjoyable, handsomely designed, somewhat ragged film brings us close to Gainsbourg as a personality. But it won't help anyone to a high score on Mastermind with \"The Life and Work of Serge Gainsbourg\" as the specialist subject. Nor will an average British audience come away understanding what François Mitterrand meant when he reacted to Gainsbourg's death saying: \"He was our Baudelaire, our Apollinaire. He elevated the song to the level of art.\""
