        "text": "Interview with an Andean Shaman\n\nIn June, I had the opportunity to film “The Andes Summit,” an event in Ecuador created by a non-profit. The summit brought together 10 shamans from various parts Ecuador to share their traditions and heritage through master classes and other events.\n\nMy wife was working as a translator for the event, and I was subsequently asked to shoot video for it. Filming the Andes Summit, was a great experience and opportunity to meet some wonderful people, and learn about their ancient traditions.\n\nOutside of my duties filming the event, I was able to interview several of the indigenous shamans who were participating. This interview with Shairy Quimbo is the first edit from the interviews I was able to capture.\n\nShairy Quimbo is a healer (shaman) of the Kichwa people, an indigenous group in Ecuador. He specializes in sound healing, and Huachuma (San Pedro -plant medicine) ceremonies.\n\nIn the interview Shairy speaks about his book, which is available on amazon in both Spanish and English. His music (Taky Samy) is also available, and can be heard in the video.\n\nFor more information about Shairy Quimbo, visit his website www.shairy-quimbo.com\n\nThis video is the first in a series. More interviews with Shamans can be seen here"
