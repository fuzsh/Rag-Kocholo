Annie: I never wanted to be your mother.

Peter: Why?

Annie: I was scared. I didn't feel like a mother. But she pressured me.

Peter: Then why did you have me?

Annie: It wasn't my fault! I tried to stop it.

Peter: How?

Annie: I tried to have a miscarriage.

Peter: How?

Annie: However I could. I did everything they told me not to do, but it didn't work. I'm happy it didn't work.

Peter: You tried to kill me.

Annie: No, I love you!

Peter: [crying] Why did you try to kill me?
