Had the privilege of catching this film early as it screened at the London Film Festival. I had high hopes after seeing the critics reviews and it did not disappoint.

The story follows Adam and his neighbour Harry, with whom he develops a romantic relationship with, as he deals with the grief from his parents tragic death when he was child.

The film cuts across genres. At times it is funny, sad, romantic, and even horrifying. It is a damning depiction of the loneliness epidemic among younger men while also dealing with the added challenges faced by those within the lgbt community in trying to fit in.

The chemistry between Scott and Mescal is brilliant, while Foy and Bell really hit the right note in their roles. The film is also beautifully shot and has a lovely palette of colours within.

It's a tough watch and left me with a lump in my throat for the entire final third, but it thoroughly deserves all the praise it has received so far.

9/10.
