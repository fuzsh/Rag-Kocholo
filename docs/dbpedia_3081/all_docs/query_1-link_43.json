The film stars Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis, with Joel McHale and Giovanni Ribisi in supporting roles, and MacFarlane providing the voice and motion capture of the title character. The film tells the story of John Bennett, a Boston native whose childhood wish brings his teddy bear friend Ted to life. However, in adulthood, Ted and John's friendship begins to interfere with the progression of John's relationship with his girlfriend, Lori Collins.\n\nMacFarlane's feature-length directorial debut,[3] the film is produced by Media Rights Capital and distributed by Universal Pictures. It was released in theaters in the United States on June 29, 2012, and was a box office hit, grossing $549.4 million against a $50–65 million budget. Ted was the highest-grossing comedy film of 2012, is the second highest-grossing R-rated comedy of all time (behind The Hangover Part II) and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. It received generally positive reviews, and successfully launched a franchise, with a sequel released in 2015 and a prequel television series in 2024.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1985, eight-year-old John Bennett is a friendless only child living in Norwood, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. On Christmas Day, he wished for his new Christmas gift, a jumbo teddy bear named Ted, to come to life and become his friend. The wish coincides with a shooting star and comes true; word spreads and Ted briefly becomes a celebrity.\n\nTwenty-seven years later, John, now 35, and Ted are still living together in an apartment in Boston with John’s girlfriend, Lori Collins, and are still staunch companions enjoying a hedonistic life. As John and Lori’s four-year anniversary approaches, Lori hopes to marry John but feels he could not move forward in life with Ted around. John is hesitant about making Ted leave, but he is persuaded to act when they find Ted at home with a group of prostitutes after their anniversary dinner.\n\nJohn finds Ted his own apartment and a job at a grocery store, where Ted begins dating his co-worker, Tami-Lynn. Lori learns that John has been skipping work, using her as an excuse, to continue to spend most of his time with Ted. John and Lori are invited to a party put on by Lori's womanizing manager Rex, but Ted lures John away to a party at his apartment, with the offer to meet Sam J. Jones, the star of their favorite film, Flash Gordon. John intends to stay only for a few minutes but gets caught up in the occasion. Lori finds John there and breaks up with him. Devastated, John blames Ted for ruining his life and ends their friendship.\n\nTed and John later argue about their ruined friendship but manage to reconcile after a violent brawl in John's hotel room. To repair John's relationship with Lori, Ted arranges for Norah Jones, an old lover of Ted, to help by having John express his love for Lori with a song during Norah's concert which Lori and Rex attend on a date. John does an off-key rendition of Octopussy theme song, \"All Time High\", by Rita Coolidge and is booed offstage. Lori is touched by the attempt and returns to her apartment where Ted confesses to his role in John's relapse and offers to leave them alone forever if she talks to John, in which Lori agrees.\n\nAfter Lori leaves, however, Ted is kidnapped by Donny, an obsessive stalker who idolized Ted as a child. Donny plans to make Ted into his brutish son Robert's new toy. Ted manages to reach a phone to contact John but is immediately recaptured. Realizing Ted is in danger, John and Lori locate Donny's residence and track him to rescue Ted. They chase them to Fenway Park, where John punches Robert, but Donny rips Ted entirely in half and he falls onto the field. Two police cars arrive, forcing Donny to flee. John and Lori gather Ted's stuffing and Ted relays his wish that John be happy with Lori before the magic in Ted fades away, making him a normal teddy bear again.\n\nUnable to accept Ted's death, a distraught John and Lori unsuccessfully attempt to repair Ted. Feeling saddened about the incident, Lori makes a wish on a shooting star. The next morning, Ted is magically restored as a result of the wish and happily reunites with John and Lori, encouraging them to resume their relationship. Sometime later, John and Lori are married (with Sam Jones as the presiding minister), and Ted comfortably accepts having a life of his own as he and Tami-Lynn continue their love affair. Sam Jones attempts to restart his career and moves into a studio apartment with Brandon Routh. Rex gives up his pursuit of Lori, goes into a deep depression, and dies of Lou Gehrig's disease. Donny gets arrested by the Boston Police Department for kidnapping Ted, but the charges are dropped. Robert hires a personal trainer, loses a significant amount of weight, and goes on to become Taylor Lautner.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nSeth MacFarlane's directorial debut is a live-action effort, with computer animation handled by visual effects facilities Tippett Studio and Iloura. MacFarlane wrote the screenplay with his Family Guy colleagues Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild.[5] MacFarlane originally wanted to make Ted into an animated television show, much like his previous works Family Guy, American Dad!, and The Cleveland Show- and later revealed in an interview with TheWrap ahead of the release of the prequel series in 2024 that he had actually pitched the idea as a family-oriented series during his time working at Hanna-Barbera, wherein Ted would be what MacFarlane described as a \"leech on the family\" as the boy went on to grow up, go to college and start said family. While MacFarlane himself admitted he \"never did anything with\" the original incarnation of the project, he came back to it when considering ideas for his first feature film, realizing it \"seemed like an idea that had some legs... and since it was a movie instead of a TV show and an ongoing group of characters, it seemed like telling a love story from start to finish and using that framework was maybe a better way to go. So the dad became a single guy trying to get his relationship back together\".[6][7]\n\nOriginally, 20th Century Fox was offered to finance and distribute the film, given its collaboration with MacFarlane for shows like Family Guy, American Dad!, and The Cleveland Show. However, MacFarlane wanted a $65 million budget for the film, which Fox considered the price to be too high for the R-rated comedy film, let alone for a first-time director, and was skeptical about the film's future success. They also wanted it to have a PG-13 rating instead of an R, which MacFarlane, Sulkin, and Wild ended up writing a version of. However, despite this, Fox backed out and MacFarlane began to take the project elsewhere.[8] On April 12, 2010, Universal Pictures announced that it had acquired the full rights to Ted after it agreed to the $65 million budget he requested and to direct the R-rated version of the script.[2][9]\n\nOn October 26, 2010, Mark Wahlberg joined in the project as the lead actor.[5] Two months later on December 14, Mila Kunis, the voice actress for Meg Griffin from Family Guy, also joined the cast.[10] On February 23, 2011, Giovanni Ribisi joined Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis in Ted.[11] Filming began in May 2011 in Boston, Norwood and other locations in Massachusetts.[12]\n\nThe film was scheduled for release in the United States on July 13, 2012, but it was moved up to June 29, both to avoid competition with Ice Age: Continental Drift and following the delay of G.I. Joe: Retaliation.[13] Internationally, the film was released in Australia on July 5, 2012,[14] and on August 1, 2012, in the United Kingdom and Ireland.[15]\n\nSoundtrack\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Ted (soundtrack)\n\nThe film's soundtrack was released by Universal Republic Records on June 26, 2012. It features the score by Walter Murphy and songs by various artists such as Norah Jones and Queen. Seth MacFarlane co-wrote the opening theme \"Everybody Needs a Best Friend\" with Murphy.[16] The song was later nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 85th Academy Awards.[17]\n\nMarketing\n\n[edit]\n\nTo promote the film, Universal Pictures teamed up with Axe in a marketing campaign that involved the title character and the brand's hair care product Axe Hair.[18] In one commercial, Ted takes a woman on a date to a fancy restaurant, where he brings her to orgasm under the table before handing another man a box of Axe Hair gel.[19]\n\nTo promote the film in Japan, United International Pictures teamed up with Spike Chunsoft in a marketing campaign that involved the title character and Danganronpa bear mascot Monokuma.[20]\n\nIn February 2013, Wahlberg and MacFarlane (as Ted) made an appearance at the 85th Academy Awards, which MacFarlane himself hosted.[21]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nTed grossed $218.8 million in North America and $330.6 million overseas for a total gross of $549.4 million, against a budget of $50 million.[1] It was Universal's highest-grossing film in 2012, ahead of Snow White and the Huntsman and Battleship[22] (the only one to pass $400 million[23]), and the 12th-highest-grossing film of 2012.\n\nAsia\n\n[edit]\n\nTed debuted in first place in Taiwan and got the best comedy opening ever there.[24] It also debuted in Hong Kong, with $1.4 million, and grossed $571,000 in its first week in South Korea,[25] eventually grossing $8 million, $3.8 million and $1.8 million respectively.[26] It also grossed $2.1 million in both Indonesia and Singapore, and $1.4 million in Thailand.[26]\n\nIn January 2013, the film opened at number one in Japan, its final market, with $4.5 million, the best start ever for an R-rated comedy there.

The website's consensus reads: \"Ted's 'romance versus bromance' plot is familiar, but the film's held aloft by the high-concept central premise and a very funny (albeit inconsistent) script.\"[52] On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 62 out of 100 based on 37 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[53] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[54]\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, citing the film as \"the best comedy screenplay so far [this year],\" also praising the film on the fact that it \"doesn't run out of steam.\"[55]\n\nNathan Rabin of The A.V. Club gave the film a \"B\" grade.[56] Brent McNight of Beyond Hollywood commented on the jokes: \"Some of these jokes hit, some jokes miss.\"[57] On the other hand, A. O. Scott of The New York Times called Ted \"boring, lazy and wildly unoriginal.\"[58]\n\nDirector Paul Thomas Anderson has stated that he is a big fan of the film, calling it \"great\" and also putting it on his favorite films of the 21st century list.[59][60]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nList of awards and nominations Award / Film Festival Category Recipients Result Ref.
