        "text": "Anne Hathaway and Nicholas Galitzine make a perfect pair in The Idea of You: They are attractive, likable actors; the former is a beloved titan of the industry and the latter is an undeniable up-and-comer; they share a musical-theater-quality earnestness that allows their screen presence to feel true and big all at once; and, most importantly, these are two of the most watery-eyed performers working today and they spend at least half this movie on the verge of crying.\n\nWhat‚Äôs there to be so sad about in The Idea of You, exactly? On its face, the film projects a shiny, absurd fantasy, in which a Harry Styles‚Äìesque fictional boy bander named Hayes Campbell (Galitzine) woos the 40-year-old divorced gallery owner Sol√®ne (Hathaway) after a chance encounter at Coachella. It could happen to anyone, no doubt, it just doesn‚Äôt. But it could! And wouldn‚Äôt that be grand? you might think to yourself. But The Idea of You seems to disagree. It wouldn‚Äôt be grand to have a second chance at love in your 40s, and it wouldn‚Äôt be fun to be in an age-gap relationship with a famous person. In fact, it might make you almost cry every time you hang out with each other.\n\nFor the first 15 minutes of the film ‚Äî in which Sol√®ne and Hayes share a meet-cute in his trailer that she mistakes for a VIP bathroom ‚Äî these characters are safe from crying, but they‚Äôre also showing each actor at their most restrained. The inherently glamorous Hathaway awkwardly embraces ‚Äútrying to be normal,‚Äù while Galitzine tries to remember in real time if he is British or American in the movie (British) and if he is British or American in real life (British). Once Hayes‚Äôs band August Moon (üôÇ) starts their performance, however, we‚Äôre off to the teary-eyed races.\n\nFirst Sol√®ne gets weepy when Hayes gets the band to play a slow song called ‚ÄúCloser‚Äù about dating an older woman. Then: She tears up explaining a piece of artwork to him the next day that makes her feel ‚Äúeverything.‚Äù And then Hayes gets watery-eyed explaining that he either could have been a pop star or Tiny Tim in a local theater production, and unfortunately now he‚Äôs so famous that it will be stressful to have a 40-year-old girlfriend named Sol√®ne. As Hathaway pours every bit of pathos into a lunchtime description of her marriage falling apart, cuts back to Galitzine show him mirroring her tears, his mouth wavering slightly. This movie‚Äôs version of an action scene is these two actors holding water in their eyeballs until the last possible second.\n\nIt‚Äôs this kind of weepy v√©rit√© that kills the fantasy aspect of The Idea of You, a movie that, for me, called to mind the scene in the season-one finale of Girls when Jessa yells ‚ÄúYour dreams are not what you thought they‚Äôd be!‚Äù into a crowd of people at her wedding. It should be fun and sexy to imagine a pop star and a divorced gallery owner getting together ‚Äî he‚Äôs so famous! she‚Äôs so regular! ‚Äî but the film suggests that this is actually a miserable coupling, full of annoyances like ‚Äúother members of the boy band‚Äù and ‚ÄúInstagram comments.‚Äù By the time two break up for the third (!) time in the film, as a teary Sol√®ne tells Hayes that he‚Äôs got a beautiful life ahead of him, it‚Äôs hard not to feel like these characters must be living with perpetual headaches, if not profound dehydration. The film cuts back and forth between them, standing in Sol√®ne‚Äôs doorway, all four eyes between them looking like the shallow end of a swimming pool.\n\nWhile we‚Äôve long known Hathaway to be a consummate crier, from her Oscar-winning turn as Fantine in Les Mis√©rables to Rachel Getting Married, this sensitive side of Galitzine is a newer revelation. He can do funny (see Bottoms), and he can do stiff upper lip (Red, White & Royal Blue), but in The Idea of You Galitzine goes toe-to-toe with a world-champion near-weeper. It‚Äôs not just that he‚Äôs a sensitive singer in a boy band; it‚Äôs that he‚Äôs in touch with his feelings enough to understand how complicated life can be if you are a 40-year-old divorc√©e with a French name who is always being upstaged by your ex-husband. Their shared mutual empathy for each other might suck the laughs out of the film, but it‚Äôs a type of fantasy unto itself, where almost crying is its own kind of emotional edging, teetering on the edge of shared relief."
