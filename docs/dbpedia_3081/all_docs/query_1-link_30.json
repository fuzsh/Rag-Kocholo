        "text": "American actress (born 1934)\n\nTina Louise (née Blacker; born February 11, 1934) is an American actress widely known for her role as movie star Ginger Grant in the CBS television situation comedy Gilligan's Island. Louise is both the last surviving and longest lived cast member of the TV series.\n\nShe began her career on stage in the mid-1950s before landing her breakthrough role in 1958 drama film God's Little Acre for which she received the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year.\n\nLouise had starring roles in The Trap, The Hangman, Day of the Outlaw, and For Those Who Think Young. She also appeared in The Wrecking Crew, The Happy Ending, and The Stepford Wives (1975).\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nLouise was born Tina Blacker on February 11, 1934, in New York City.[1] Her parents divorced by the time she was four. An only child, she was raised by her mother, Sylvia (née Horn, later Myers), a fashion model. Her father, Joseph Blacker, was a candy store owner in the Brooklyn borough of the city, and later an accountant.[2] Louise attended PS 6, Scarborough Day School and Miami University.[3] She is Jewish.[4]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly work\n\n[edit]\n\nLouise got her first role at age two after being in an ad for her father's candy store. She began studying acting, singing, and dancing at age 17 under Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in Manhattan. Her acting debut came in 1952 in the Bette Davis musical revue Two's Company,[5] followed by roles in such other Broadway productions as John Murray Anderson's Almanac, Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?, and the hit musical Li'l Abner.[6] She appeared in the live television dramas Studio One and Producers' Showcase.\n\nHollywood and Gilligan's Island\n\n[edit]\n\nLouise made her film debut in 1958 in God's Little Acre. That same year, the National Art Council named her the \"World's Most Beautiful Redhead.\"[7] The next year, she starred in Day of the Outlaw with Robert Ryan. She became a leading lady for stars such as Robert Taylor and Richard Widmark, often playing sombre roles. She turned down roles in the films of Li'l Abner and Operation Petticoat,[8] taking roles on Broadway and in Italian cinema. Among her Italian film credits were The Siege of Syracuse and Garibaldi (both in 1960).\n\nLouise returned to the United States, began studying with Lee Strasberg, and became a member of the Actors Studio.[9][10] In 1962, she guest-starred on the situation comedy The Real McCoys, portraying a country girl from West Virginia in the episode \"Grandpa Pygmalion\". She appeared with Bob Denver two years later in the beach party film For Those Who Think Young (1964). In 1964, she left the Broadway musical Fade Out – Fade In to portray movie star Ginger Grant on the situation comedy Gilligan's Island. Over time, she became unhappy with the role and was worried that it would typecast her. Although she continued to work in film and made guest appearances on television, she claimed repeatedly that playing Ginger had ruined her movie career. She did not appear in any of the subsequent Gilligan's Island sequel movies: Rescue from Gilligan's Island (1978), The Castaways on Gilligan's Island (1979), or The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island (1981). Other actresses played the role of Ginger in the sequels. She maintained a steady acting career after the series ended, going on to appear in the Matt Helm spy spoof The Wrecking Crew (1969) with Dean Martin and in The Stepford Wives (1975). As of August, 2024, she is the last surviving cast member of Gillian’s Island.\n\nLouise attempted to shed her comedic image by playing darker roles, such as a heroin addict in a 1974 episode of Kojak and as a cruel corrections officer in the 1976 television movie Nightmare in Badham County. Other television appearances included supporting roles in Look What's Happened to Rosemary's Baby (1976), SST: Death Flight (1977), and the soap opera Dallas during the 1978–1979 seasons. In the fall of 1984, she succeeded Jo Ann Pflug as Taylor Chapin on the syndicated soap opera Rituals.\n\nLater work\n\n[edit]\n\nLater film roles included a co-starring appearance in the Robert Altman comedy O.C. and Stiggs (1987) as well as the independently made satire Johnny Suede (1992) starring Brad Pitt. She appeared in the situation comedy Married... with Children as Miss Beck in episode \"Kelly Bounces Back\" (1990). In 2014, Louise starred in the spiritual drama Tapestry and the horror film Late Phases.[11][12]\n\nAlthough Louise declined to participate in any of three Gilligan's Island reunion television films, she made brief walk-on appearances on a few talk shows and specials for Gilligan's Island reunions, including Good Morning America (1982), The Late Show (1988) and the 2004 TV Land award show with the other surviving cast members. In the 1990s, she was reunited with costars Bob Denver, Dawn Wells, and Russell Johnson in an episode of Roseanne.[5] She did not reunite with them for the television film Surviving Gilligan's Island (2001), co-produced by Wells; Ginger was portrayed by Kristen Dalton in the television film.[13] Her relations with series star Denver were rumored to be strained, but in 2005, she wrote a brief, affectionate memorial to him in the year-end \"farewell\" issue of Entertainment Weekly after his death.[14]\n\nFollowing the news of Dawn Wells' passing in December 2020, Louise denied any longtime rumors that she resented the role of Ginger Grant: \"Never true – I loved doing my part, especially after they really started writing for my character, originally billed as a 'Marilyn Monroe' type of character. A different director took over and really started to write for my character. I really loved my character.\" She also said that she was very grateful to the show's fans for their continued support, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic: \"We were part of the wonderful show that everyone loves and has been a great source of comfort, especially during these times. We brought a lot of joy to people and still do. This show is an escape from so many things going on. Fathers share it with their children now. I get letters all the time about that.\"[15]\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nLouise made one record album, It's Time for Tina, which was released originally on Concert Hall in 1957 (Concert Hall 1521), and later reissued on Urania Records (1958 and 1959 respectively).[16] With arrangements by Jim Timmens and Buddy Weed's Orchestra, 12 tracks include \"Tonight Is the Night\" and \"I'm in the Mood for Love.\" Coleman Hawkins is featured on tenor sax. The album has been reissued on CD twice, most recently on the UK label Harkit Records.[17] The album was released on iTunes in 2012. She also recorded for United Artists Records[18] but recorded just one single for that label in 1958.[19]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom 1966 to 1971, Louise was married to radio and TV announcer/interviewer Les Crane, with whom she had one daughter, Caprice,[20][21] who became an MTV producer and a novelist. Tina Louise and Les Crane appeared together as a married couple in a 1973 episode of Love American Style. Caprice Crane's first novel, Stupid and Contagious, was published in 2006,[22] and was dedicated to her mother.[23]\n\nLouise is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and a lifetime member of the Actors Studio.[24] Louise has been a vocal advocate for improving child literacy. She donated a portion of the proceeds of her 2007 book, When I Grow Up, to literacy programs and said in a 2013 interview that she had been volunteering at local public schools since 1996.[24][25] She has written three books including Sunday: A Memoir (1997) and When I Grow Up (2007).[5] The last is a children's book that inspires children to believe they can become whatever they choose through creative and humorous comparisons of animal kingdom achievements. She also published a second children's book titled What Does a Bee Do? in 2009.[26]\n\nLouise is quoted as saying, \"The best movie you'll ever be in is your own life because that's what matters in the end.\"[27]\n\nA Democrat, she campaigned for John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election[28] and Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.[29]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Film Role Notes 1958 God's Little Acre Griselda Walden Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress\n\nLaurel Award for Best Female Supporting Performance (5th place) 1959 The Trap Linda Anderson 1959 The Hangman Selah Jennison 1959 Day of the Outlaw Helen Crane 1960 L'assedio di Siracusa Diana / Artemide / Lucrezia 1960 The Warrior Empress Sappho 1961 Garibaldi French Journalist 1961 Armored Command Alexandra Bastegar 1964 For Those Who Think Young Topaz McQueen 1967 The Seventh Floor Dr. Immer Mehr 1968 The Wrecking Crew Lola Medina 1969 How to Commit Marriage Laverne Baker 1969 The Good Guys and the Bad Guys Carmel 1969 The Happy Ending Helen Bricker 1970 But I Don't Want to Get Married!
