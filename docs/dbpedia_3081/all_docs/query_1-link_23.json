        "text": "1990 film by Garry Marshall\n\nFor other uses, see Pretty Woman (disambiguation).\n\nPretty WomanDirected byGarry MarshallWritten byJ. F. LawtonProduced byStarringCinematographyCharles MinskyEdited byMusic byJames Newton Howard\n\nProduction\n\ncompanies\n\nDistributed byBuena Vista Pictures Distribution\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n119 minutesCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBudget$14 millionBox office$463.4 million\n\nPretty Woman is a 1990 American romantic comedy film directed by Garry Marshall, from a screenplay by J. F. Lawton. The film stars Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, and features Héctor Elizondo, Ralph Bellamy (in his final performance), Laura San Giacomo, and Jason Alexander in supporting roles.[1] The film's story centers on Hollywood escort Vivian Ward and wealthy businessman Edward Lewis. Vivian is hired to be Edward's escort for several business and social functions, and their relationship develops during her week-long stay with him. The film's title Pretty Woman is based on the 1964 song \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" by Roy Orbison. The original screenplay was titled “3,000,” and was written by then-struggling screenwriter J. F. Lawton.\n\nOriginally intended to be a dark cautionary tale about class and sex work in Los Angeles, the film was re-conceived as a romantic comedy with a large budget. Pretty Woman received mixed reviews from critics upon release, but widespread praise was directed towards Roberts' performance. It saw the highest number of ticket sales in the US ever for a romantic comedy,[2] with Box Office Mojo listing it as the number-one romantic comedy by the highest estimated domestic tickets sold at 42,176,400, slightly ahead of My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002) at 41,419,500 tickets.[3] The film grossed US$463.4 million worldwide and at the time of its release, was the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide, behind only E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial ($701 million at the time), Star Wars ($530 million at the time), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade ($474 million at the time), and Jaws ($470 million at the time). It was also the highest grossing R-rated film released by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, holding the record for 34 years until Marvel Studios' Deadpool & Wolverine surpassed it in 2024.\n\nPretty Woman catapulted Roberts to superstardom, earning her the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, in addition to her first nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. The film also received nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Film and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nOne night, leaving a business party in the Hollywood Hills, Edward takes his lawyer Philip's Lotus Esprit and finds himself in the red-light district on Hollywood Boulevard. There he meets struggling prostitute Vivian Ward.\n\nLost and struggling to operate the stick-shift, Vivian offers to drive Edward to the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. Impulsively, he hires her for the whole night and, despite initial awkwardness, finds her charming and they have sex in his penthouse suite.\n\nThe following day, Edward asks Vivian to stay for the week, as he must attend a series of business events while attempting to acquire Jim Morse's shipbuilding company. After negotiating, Edward and Vivian agree on $3,000. He also gives her money to buy appropriate clothes.\n\nHowever, when trying to shop on Rodeo Drive, snobbish and rude saleswomen turn Vivian away. She asks the hotel manager Barney for assistance. He gets upscale store saleslady Bridget, who is very kind, to find her a cocktail dress for that evening's business dinner. Later, Barney teaches her table etiquette.\n\nEdward is astounded by Vivian’s transformation. At dinner, he introduces Vivian to Morse and his grandson David, who is to take over the company. The Morses are charmed by her, but ultimately the dinner does not go well as they are unhappy with Edward's plan to dismantle their company.\n\nEdward opens up to the transformed Vivian. He reveals details about his personal and business life, including his estranged relationship with his late father Carter.\n\nWhen Philip suspects Vivian is a corporate spy, as he sees her talking to David Morse at a polo match, Edward explains their arrangement. The married lawyer later crudely propositions her for her services after Edward leaves. She gets upset with Edward for exposing her in that way. He apologizes, admitting that he was jealous of Vivian talking to David and acknowledging that her directness is having a positive effect on him.\n\nEdward takes Vivian by private jet to see La traviata at the San Francisco Opera, a story about a prostitute who falls in love with a wealthy man. She is moved, and she breaks her \"no kissing\" rule before having sex with him. Believing Edward has fallen asleep, Vivian says she loves him.\n\nAs the week is almost finished, Edward offers to get Vivian a condominium and an allowance, promising to visit her regularly. However, Vivian is offended, feeling he is now treating her like a prostitute. She tells her childhood fantasy of being rescued by a knight on a white steed.\n\nEdward meets with Morse but, influenced by Vivian, chooses to work with him to save his company instead of dismantling it. Meanwhile Philip, furious that Edward's new direction has cost him a fortune, goes to the Beverly Wilshire to confront him. However, he finds Vivian. So, blaming her for Edward's changes and angry at his business decision, Philip hits her and attempts to rape her. Edward arrives, pulls Philip off of Vivian, punches and fires him.\n\nAfter completing his business in Los Angeles, Edward asks Vivian to stay with him for one more night, but only if she wants to, not because he is paying her. She gently refuses and leaves after telling him she thinks he has \"lots of special gifts.\"\n\nVivian returns to her apartment hotel to pack for her move to San Francisco to get a new job and finish her high school degree. She gives her roommate, fellow prostitute Kity De Luca, some money and tells her she has \"a lot of potential.\" Kit leaves sex work and enrolls in beauty classes. Vivian then waits in her apartment for the bus.\n\nVivian's rejection prompts Edward to re-evaluate his life, so he reroutes the chauffeur to her apartment instead of the airport. He climbs out of the white limousine's sunroof and ascends the fire escape to 'rescue' Vivian, just like the knight in her childhood fantasy. When he asks her what happens after the knight rescues her, she responds \"She rescues him right back\", and kisses him.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nAs per the opening credits\n\nRichard Gere as Edward Lewis, a rich corporate raider from New York who hires Vivian to be his escort for a week\n\nJulia Roberts as Vivian Ward, a free-spirited Hollywood prostitute\n\nRalph Bellamy as Jim Morse, owner of Morse Industries, a troubled shipbuilding company Edward plans to take over\n\nJason Alexander as Philip Stuckey, Edward's insensitive lawyer\n\nHéctor Elizondo as Barnard \"Barney\" Thompson, the dignified and soft-hearted hotel manager\n\nLaura San Giacomo as Kit De Luca, Vivian's sarcastic wisecracking best friend and roommate who taught her the prostitution trade\n\nAlex Hyde-White as David Morse, Jim Morse's grandson, who is being groomed to take over the Morses' shipbuilding company\n\nAmy Yasbeck as Elizabeth Stuckey, Philip's wife\n\nElinor Donahue as Bridget, a friend of Barney Thompson who works in a women's clothing store\n\nJohn David Carson as Mark Roth, a businessman in Edward's office\n\nJudith Baldwin as Susan, one of Edward's ex-girlfriends whom he runs into at Phil's party at the beginning of the film.

Edward eventually throws her out of his car and drives off. The original script by J. F. Lawton, called 3000,[5] ended with Vivian and her prostitute friend on the bus to Disneyland.[4] Producer Laura Ziskin considered these elements detrimental to a sympathetic portrayal of Vivian, and they were removed or assigned to Kit. The deleted scenes have been found, and some were included on the DVD released for the film's 15th anniversary.[4] In one, Vivian tells Edward, \"I could just pop ya good and be on my way,\" indicating her lack of interest in \"pillow talk.\" In another, she is confronted by a drug dealer, Carlos, then rescued by Edward when the limo driver Darryl gets his gun out.\n\nThough inspired by such films as Wall Street and The Last Detail,[5] the film bears a resemblance to Pygmalion myths: particularly George Bernard Shaw's play of the same name, which also formed the basis for the Broadway musical My Fair Lady. It was Walt Disney Studios then-president Jeffrey Katzenberg who insisted the film be re-written as a modern-day fairy tale and love story, as opposed to the original dark drama. It was pitched to Touchstone Pictures and re-written as a romantic comedy.[6] The title 3000 was changed because Disney executives thought it sounded like a title for a science fiction film.[7]\n\nCasting\n\n[edit]\n\nThe casting of the film was a rather lengthy process. Marshall had initially considered Christopher Reeve, Daniel Day-Lewis, Kevin Kline, and Denzel Washington for the role of Edward, and Albert Brooks,[8] Sylvester Stallone, Al Pacino and Burt Reynolds turned it down.[9][10] Pacino went as far as doing a casting reading with Roberts before rejecting the part.[11] Sam Neill, Tom Conti and Charles Grodin tested for the part along with Roberts.[1][12] Gere initially refused but when he met with Roberts, she persuaded him and he eventually agreed to play Lewis.[13] He reportedly started off much more active in his role; but Garry Marshall took him aside and said \"No, no, no, Richard. In this movie, one of you moves and one of you does not. Guess which one you are?\"[14]\n\nJulia Roberts was not the first choice for the role of Vivian, and was not wanted by Disney. Many other actresses were considered. Marshall originally envisioned Karen Allen for the role; when she declined, auditions went to many better-known actresses of the time including Molly Ringwald,[15] who turned it down as she didn't like the story as she felt there was something icky about it.[16][17] Winona Ryder auditioned, but was turned down because Marshall felt she was \"too young.\"[10] Jennifer Connelly was also dismissed for the same reason.[4] Emily Lloyd turned it down as it conflicted with her shooting for the film Mermaids.[18] Drew Barrymore, Patricia Arquette, Brooke Shields, Uma Thurman, and Kristin Davis also auditioned for the role of Vivian.[19][20] Meg Ryan, who was the studio and Marshall's top choice, turned it down as well.[21] According to a note written by Marshall, Mary Steenburgen was also among the first choices. Diane Lane came very close to being cast (the script was much darker at the time); they had gone as far as costume fittings, but due to scheduling conflicts she could not accept. Michelle Pfeiffer turned the role down, saying she did not like the script's \"tone.\"[22] Daryl Hannah was also considered but believed the role was \"degrading to women.\"[22] Valeria Golino was in consideration, but was not selected because of her thick Italian accent,[23] and Jennifer Jason Leigh had auditioned.[24] Lea Thompson unsuccessfully auditioned for the role as she thought the film was a drama.[25]\n\nWhen all the other actresses turned down the role, 21-year-old Julia Roberts, a relative unknown, with only the sleeper hit Mystic Pizza (1988) and the yet-to-be-released Steel Magnolias (1989), for which she would be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, won the role of Vivian. Her performance made her a star. J. F. Lawton, writer of the original screenplay, has suggested that the film was ultimately given a happy ending because of the chemistry of Gere and Roberts.[5]\n\nVeteran actor Ralph Bellamy, who plays James Morse, appears in his final acting performance before his death in 1991. Jason Alexander, who had also recently been cast for his role as the bumbling George Costanza in Seinfeld, was cast as Philip Stuckey. A VHS copy of Pretty Woman would appear in Seinfeld's apartment in later seasons of Seinfeld as a homage to Alexander's participation in the film.\n\nFilming\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film's budget was substantial, at $14 million, so producers could shoot in many locations.[4] Most filming took place in Los Angeles, California, specifically in Beverly Hills, and inside soundstages at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank. The escargot restaurant the \"Voltaire\" was shot at the restaurant \"Rex,\" now called \"Cicada.\" Scenes set in the Beverly Wilshire Hotel lobby were shot at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Filming commenced on July 24, 1989, but was immediately plagued by problems. These included Ferrari and Porsche declining the product placement opportunity for the car Edward drove, neither firm wishing to be associated with prostitutes.[4] Lotus Cars saw the placement value and supplied a Silver 1989+1⁄2 Esprit SE (which was later sold).[26]\n\nThe shooting was a generally pleasant, easy-going experience, as the budget was broad and the shooting schedule was not tight.[4] While shooting the scene where Vivian is lying down on the floor of Edward's penthouse, watching reruns of I Love Lucy, Garry Marshall had to tickle Roberts' feet (out of camera range) to get her to laugh.[27] The scene in which Gere playfully snaps the lid of a jewelry case on her fingers was improvised, and her surprised laugh was genuine. The red dress Vivian wears to the opera has been listed among the most unforgettable dresses of all time.[28]\n\nDuring the scene in which Roberts sang a Prince song in the bathtub, slid down, and submerged her head under the bubbles; she emerged to find the crew had left except for the cameraman, who captured the moment on film. In the love scene, she was so stressed that a vein became noticeable on her forehead and had to be massaged by Marshall and Gere. She also developed a case of hives, and calamine lotion was used to soothe her skin until filming resumed.[4] The filming was completed on November 30.[29]\n\nShelley Michelle acted as body double for Roberts in risqué scenes and the film's publicity poster.[30]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nIn its opening weekend, the film was at number one at the US box office, grossing $11,280,591 and averaging $8,513 per theater.[31][32] Despite dropping to number two in its second weekend, it grossed more with $12,471,670.[32] It returned to number one at the US box office in its sixth weekend and was number one for three weeks. It was in the Top 10 movies in the US for 16 weeks.[32] In Australia, it was number one for 12 weeks and was number one for nine consecutive weeks in the UK. As of September 29, 2009 , it has grossed $178,406,268 in the United States and $285,000,000 in other countries for a total worldwide gross of US$463,406,268.[3] It was the fourth highest-grossing film of the year in the United States and Canada[33] and the third highest-grossing worldwide.[34] The film was Disney's highest-grossing film ever, surpassing Three Men and a Baby. It was also Disney's highest-grossing R-rated release until Deadpool & Wolverine in 2024.[35][36][37]\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nPretty Woman received mixed reviews from critics.[38][39][40][41] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 65% based on 77 reviews, with an average rating of 6.0/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"Pretty Woman may be a yuppie fantasy, but the film's slick comedy, soundtrack, and casting can overcome misgivings.\"[42] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"[43] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[44]\n\nOwen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \"D,\" saying it \"starts out as a neo-Pygmalion comedy\" and with \"its tough-hooker heroine, it can work as a feminist version of an upscale princess fantasy.\" Gleiberman also said it \"pretends to be about how love transcends money,\" but \"is really obsessed with status symbols.\"[45] On its twentieth anniversary, Gleiberman wrote another article, saying that while he felt he was right, he would have given it a \"B\" today.[46] Carina Chocano of The New York Times said the movie \"wasn't a love story, it was a money story. Its logic depended on a disconnect between character and narrative, between image and meaning, between money and value, and that made it not cluelessly traditional but thoroughly postmodern.\"[47] Roberts would later say in a 2019 interview that she believes that the film would not be made today.[48]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nAward Category Nominee(s) Result Academy Awards[49] Best Actress Julia Roberts Nominated BMI Film & TV Awards Film Music Award James Newton Howard Won Most Performed Song from a Film \"It Must Have Been Love\" – Per Gessle Won British Academy Film Awards[50] Best Film Arnon Milchan, Steven Reuther and Garry Marshall Nominated Best Actress in a Leading Role Julia Roberts Nominated Best Screenplay – Original J.

The highly dramatic aria fragment that is repeated is the end of \"Dammi tu forza!\" (\"Give me strength!\"), from the opera. Roberts sings the song \"Kiss\" by Prince while she is in the tub and Gere's character is on the phone. Background music is composed by James Newton Howard. The piano piece Gere's character plays in the hotel lobby was composed and performed by Gere. Entitled \"He Sleeps/Love Theme,\" this piano composition is inspired by Bruce Springsteen's \"Racing in the Street.\"\n\nMusical adaptation\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Pretty Woman: The Musical\n\nA stage musical adaptation of the film opened on Broadway on July 20, 2018, in previews, officially on August 16 at the Nederlander Theatre.[55] This follows an out-of-town tryout at the Oriental Theatre in Chicago, which ran from March 13 to April 15, 2018. The musical has music and lyrics by Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance; the late Garry Marshall and J. F. Lawton wrote the book; and Jerry Mitchell is the director and choreographer.[56] The Chicago and Broadway cast featured Samantha Barks, in her Broadway debut as Vivian and Steve Kazee as Edward.
