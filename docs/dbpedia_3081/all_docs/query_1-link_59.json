B. White's novel of the same name. Directed by Rob Minkoff in his live-action directorial debut, the screenplay was written by M. Night Shyamalan and Greg Brooker, and stars Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie and Jonathan Lipnicki, alongside the voices of Michael J. Fox, Nathan Lane, Chazz Palminteri, Steve Zahn, Bruno Kirby and Jennifer Tilly.\n\nStuart Little premiered in Westwood at Mann Village Theatre on December 5, 1999, and was released in United States on December 17, 1999, by Columbia Pictures.[5] The film received generally positive reviews and became a box office success, grossing over $300 million worldwide. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, but lost to The Matrix.[6] After its success, it also started a franchise with the sequel Stuart Little 2 in 2002, the short-lived television series Stuart Little in 2003, and the direct-to-video sequel Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild in 2006. It was Estelle Getty's final film role.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nIn New York City, Frederick and Eleanor Little visit an orphanage to adopt a new brother for their son, George. Instead, they adopt an anthropomorphic mouse named Stuart. George refuses to acknowledge him as his brother and the family cat, Snowbell, is disgusted to be pet to a mouse. The next day, Stuart's life in the house goes off to a bad start when he is inadvertently trapped in the washing machine.\n\nThe Littles invite their extended family to meet Stuart where George confesses he does not regard Stuart as a brother but simply a mouse. Stuart asks Eleanor and Fredrick to enquire about his biological parents, feeling an empty space. Stuart encourages George to finish his model boat for an upcoming race and the duo start to bond. Meanwhile, Snowbell and his alley cat friend Monty meet with the latter's superior, Smokey, and formulate a plan to dispose of Stuart. On the day of the race, Stuart accidentally breaks George's remote control. He jumps into the boat and takes control himself, narrowly avoiding a crash and winning the race, finally enabling George to accept Stuart as his brother.\n\nAs the Littles host a celebration, a mouse couple, Reggie and Camille Stout, arrive and claim to be Stuart's biological parents who were forced by poverty to give him up. The Littles reluctantly allow Stuart to leave with the Stouts. The orphanage calls to ask how Stuart is doing and when the Littles explain he has gone home with his real parents, orphanage head Mrs. Keeper informs them that Stuart's real parents had died several years earlier. Realizing Stuart has been kidnapped, the family organizes a search party with \"missing person\" posters, using his photograph from the family photo. Fearing his involvement will be exposed and that he will be kicked out of the house, Snowbell informs Smokey about the news and the latter settles on assassinating Stuart instead.\n\nRemorseful about Stuart's sadness, the Stouts, now revealed to be reluctant pawns of Smokey, reveal their deception; he is delighted and makes his way back to the Little house. On the way, he is ambushed by Smokey and his gang but evades them by going into a sewer. At home, a jealous Snowbell lies that the family is out celebrating his absence, using the fact that Stuart's face has been removed from the family photo as evidence. Heartbroken, Stuart leaves, but Snowbell soon regrets his actions after the Littles return home. Snowbell finds Stuart at Central Park and admits his lie, encouraging Stuart to come home. When the duo are confronted by Smokey's gang, Snowbell refuses to hand Stuart over and they give chase, cornering Stuart hanging from a branch over the park's pond. Snowbell breaks the branch the cats are on, sending them into it. Smokey sneaks up on Snowbell, but Stuart releases a branch that hits Smokey in the face, defeating him.\n\nStuart is taken home by Snowbell and is reunited with the Littles. Stuart tells them he owes his life to Snowbell, who has realized Stuart truly is family.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nLive-action cast\n\n[edit]\n\nGeena Davis as Eleanor Little, the matriarch of the Little family and Frederick's wife.\n\nHugh Laurie as Frederick Little, the patriarch of the Little family and Eleanor's husband.\n\nJonathan Lipnicki as George Little, the eldest son of the Little family and Stuart's adoptive older brother.\n\nJeffrey Jones as Crenshaw Little, the older brother of Frederick Little, the younger brother of Beatrice and one of George and Stuart's two uncles.\n\nConnie Ray as Tina Little, the wife of Crenshaw and the sister-in-law of Beatrice and Frederick and one of George and Stuart's two aunts.\n\nAllyce Beasley as Beatrice Little, the older sister of Crenshaw and Frederick and one of George and Stuart's two aunts.\n\nBrian Doyle-Murray as Edgar Little, the cousin of Beatrice, Crenshaw and Frederick and the nephew of Grandpa Spencer.\n\nEstelle Getty as Estelle Little, the mother of Beatrice, Crenshaw and Frederick and George and Stuart's grandmother.\n\nHarold Gould as Spencer Little, the father of Beatrice, Crenshaw and Frederick and George and Stuart's grandfather.\n\nPatrick Thomas O'Brien as Stretch Little, the husband of Beatrice, the brother-in-law of Crenshaw and Frederick and one of George and Stuart's two uncles.\n\nJulia Sweeney as Mrs. Keeper, the head of the New York City Public Orphanage.\n\nDabney Coleman as Doctor Beechwood, a doctor who visits the Littles' house following Stuart's entrapment in its washing machine.\n\nMiles Marsico as Anton Gartman, a mean-spirited boy who bullies George during the boat race.\n\nJon Polito as Detective Sherman, a police detective who works for the New York Police Department.\n\nJim Doughan as Detective Phil Allen, Detective Sherman's partner.

A set designer for the film had purchased the painting at an antiques store in Pasadena, California, for $500 for use in the film, unaware of its significance. In 2009, art historian Gergely Barki, while watching Stuart Little on television with his daughter, noticed the painting, and after contacting the studios was able to track down its whereabouts.[8] In 2014, its owner sold the painting at an auction for €229,500.[9]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nStuart Little was released theatrically on December 17, 1999.
