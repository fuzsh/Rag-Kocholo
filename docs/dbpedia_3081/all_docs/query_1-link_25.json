        "text": "There is a body of films that feature home invasions. Paula Marantz Cohen says, \"Such films reflect an increased fear of the erosion of distinctions between private and public space... These films also reflect a sense that the outside world is more dangerous and unpredictable than ever before.\"[1] Home invasion films are commonly thrillers and horror films.[2] The home invasion subgenre goes as far back as D. W. Griffith's 1909 film The Lonely Villa.[3]\n\nThis list only covers films containing actual or attempted home invasions, and does not include movies based around assaults on other places such as Assault on Precinct 13, which dealt with a police station being invaded, or intrusion under false pretenses, such as Orphan.\n\nList of films\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm Year Ref. 36 Ghante 1974 [4] 388 Arletta Avenue 2011 [5] 3615 code Père Noël 1989 [6] Absurd (Italian: Rosso Sangue) 1981 [7] 2012 [8] Alone in the Dark 1982 [9] The Anderson Tapes 1971 [10] Angst 1983 [11] As Good as It Gets 1997 August Underground 2001 August Underground's Mordum 2003 August Underground's Penance 2007 Bad Influence 1990 [12] The Bat 1926 The Bat 1959 [13] Becky 2020 [14] Better Watch Out 2016 [15] Black Christmas 1974 [2] Black Christmas 2006 [2] Black Christmas 2019 [2] Blind Alley 1939 [12] Blood Simple 1985 Blue Steel 1990 [12] Bone 1972 [16] Breaking In 2018 [17] 1996 [18] 2013 [19] Cape Fear 1962 [20] Cape Fear 1991 [20] Captain Magal 1993 [21] Cherry Tree Lane 2010 [22] 1971 [1] Clownhouse 1989 [23] Cold in July 2014 [24] 2009 [25] Corruption 1968 [26] Count the Hours 1953 [27] Creep 2014 [28] Crimewave 1985 Cul-de-sac 1966 [29] Curfew 1989 [30] 2005 [1] 1948 Deadfall 2012 [31] Deadly Virtues 2014 [32] Death Game 1977 [33] Death Weekend 1976 [11] Death Wish 1974 [34] Death Wish II 1982 [35] Demon Seed 1977 [36] 1955 [37] Desperate Hours 1990 [38] Devil in a Blue Dress 1995 [39] Dial M for Murder 1954 [2] Disorder 2015 [40] Don't Breathe 2016 [41] Don't Say a Word 2001 Dream Lover 1993 [12] The Dress 1996 [42] E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial 1982 [43] (German: Die fetten Jahre sind vorbei) 2004 [44] Emelie 2015 [45] Extremities 1986 [46] Eye for an Eye 1996 [47] Fargo 1996 Farmer's Daughters 1973 [48] Fatal Attraction 1987 [49] Fear 1996 [2] 1992 [11] Fight for Your Life 1977 [50] Firewall 2006 [25] Five Minutes to Live 1961 [51] The Fugitive 1993 [25] Funny Games 1997 [1] Funny Games 2007 [1] Game Over 2019 [1] The Gift 2015 [52] Grotesque 1988 [53] Halloween 1978 1992 [49] Hangman 2015 [54] Hate Crime 2012 [55] Heart and Souls 1993 Hell High 1989 [56] Hellions 2015 [57] Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer 1986 [58] He Ran All the Way 1951 [37] Hider in the House 1989 [2] High Tension 2003 [59] Home Alone (franchise)[nb 1] 1990 [59] Home Sweet Home 2013 [25][61] Hostage 2005 [62] 1980 [11] Hush 2016 [63] If I Die Before I Wake 1998 [11] In Cold Blood 1967 [64] Incident in a Ghostland 2018 [65] Inside (French: À l'intérieur) 2007 [1] In Their Skin 2012 [66] Intruder 2016 [67] Intruders (Alternate Title: Shut In) 2015 [68] I Saw What You Did 1965 I See You 2019 [69] I Spit on Your Grave 1978 [70] John Wick 2014 [71] Kala 2021 [72] Keep Watching 2017 [73] Key Largo 1948 [74] Kidnapped (Spanish: Secuestrados) 2010 [75] Kimi 2022 [76] Kitten with a Whip 1964 [12] Knock at the Cabin 2023 Knock Knock 2015 [77] Kristy 2014 [67] Kung Fu Ghost 2022 [78] Lady in a Cage 1964 [38] Lady Stay Dead 1981 [79] Lakeview Terrace 2008 [25] Last House on Dead End Street 1977 [50] 1972 [59] 2009 [25] Law Abiding Citizen 2009 [80] The Lonely Villa 1909 [3] Malice 1993 [12] Man Bites Dog (French: C'est arrivé près de chez vous) 1992 [81] Manhunter 1986 [82] Martyrs 2008 [25] Martyrs 2016 [83] Masquerade 2021 [84] Mercy 2016 [57] Memento 2000 [25] Mischief Night 2013 [70] Mother!
