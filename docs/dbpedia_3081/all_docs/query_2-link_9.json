        "text": "Definition of the present perfect tense\n\nThe present perfect is used to indicate a link between the present and the past. The time of the action is before now but not specified, and we are often more interested in the result than in the action itself.\n\nBE CAREFUL! There may be a verb tense in your language with a similar form, but the meaning is probably NOT the same.\n\nThe present perfect is used to describe\n\nAn action or situation that started in the past and continues in the present. I have lived in Bristol since 1984 (= and I still do.)\n\nAn action performed during a period that has not yet finished. She has been to the cinema twice this week (= and the week isn't over yet.)\n\nA repeated action in an unspecified period between the past and now. We have visited Portugal several times.\n\nAn action that was completed in the very recent past, expressed by 'just'. I have just finished my work.\n\nAn action when the time is not important. He has read 'War and Peace'. (= the result of his reading is important)\n\nNote: When we want to give or ask details about when, where, who, we use the simple past. Read more about choosing between the present perfect and the simple past tenses.\n\nActions started in the past and continuing in the present\n\nThey haven't lived here for years.\n\nShe has worked in the bank for five years.\n\nWe have had the same car for ten years.\n\nHave you played the piano since you were a child?\n\nWhen the time period referred to has not finished\n\nI have worked hard this week.\n\nIt has rained a lot this year.\n\nWe haven't seen her today.\n\nActions repeated in an unspecified period between the past and now.\n\nThey have seen that film six times\n\nIt has happened several times already.\n\nShe has visited them frequently.\n\nWe have eaten at that restaurant many times.\n\nActions completed in the very recent past (+just)\n\nHave you just finished work?\n\nI have just eaten.\n\nWe have just seen her.\n\nHas he just left?\n\nWhen the precise time of the action is not important or not known\n\nSomeone has eaten my soup!\n\nHave you seen 'Gone with the Wind'?\n\nShe's studied Japanese, Russian, and English.\n\nRead more about using the present perfect with the words \"ever\", \"never\", \"already\", and \"yet\", and about using the present perfect with the words \"for\" and \"since\".\n\nForming the present perfect\n\nThe present perfect of any verb is composed of two elements : the appropriate form of the auxiliary verb to have (present tense), plus the past participle of the main verb. The past participle of a regular verb is base+ed, e.g. played, arrived, looked. For irregular verbs, see the Table of irregular verbs in the section called 'Verbs'.\n\nAffirmative Subject +to have +past participle She has visited. Negative Subject +to have + not +past participle She has not (hasn't) visited. Interrogative to have +subject +past participle Has she visited? Negative interrogative to have + not +subject +past participle Hasn't she visited?\n\nTo Walk, present perfect\n\nAffirmative Negative Interrogative I have walked I haven't walked Have I walked? You have walked You haven't walked. Have you walked? He, she, it has walked He, she, hasn't walked Has he, she, it walked? We have walked We haven't walked Have we walked? You have walked You haven't walked Have you walked? They have walked They haven't walked Have they walked?"
