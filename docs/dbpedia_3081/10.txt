OMG Name Already ,

Love it so much!

I truly appreciate the like/dislike option. It helps me keep track of what Iâve watched. I watch Tubi more than any other app. Including Netflicks and the like. Recently there have been a few glitches though. When I watch a preview sometimes the actual movie will play afterwards or, if I exit out before the movie starts then the audio will start playing. This issue includes live tv as well. It usually fixes itself after I turn off and then back on again or sometimes I have to unplug the box altogether. Iâve gotten to where I will back out of the app after each interaction and then reopen. That seems to help. Also, would you please hold the suggestion bar until the movie is over and playing the credits. Sometimes, especially with old movies ( which I love) the suggestion bar will pop up while the action is still playing thus hiding part of the screen. If I exit out of the suggestion bar it just comes back and if I exit again the whole movie exits out and I donât get to finish the movie unless I start it over and fast forward to the end and I still have to contend with the suggestion bar, so can still only see part of the screen. All in all itâs a great app, even if you donât fix those things. Thanks.
