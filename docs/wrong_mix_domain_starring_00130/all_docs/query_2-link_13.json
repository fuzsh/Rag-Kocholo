        "text": "Gareth Edwards’ ‘Godzilla‘ storms back into theaters on May 15th, starring Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabth Olsen and Ken Wantanabe. Fans are crossing their fingers that the new film properly services the cult classic films and avoids the same pitfalls that spoiled the 1998 Roland Emmerich version, which essentially boiled down to a ‘Jurassic Park‘ knock-off.\n\nWell, studio Legendary is hoping to alleviate any worries by releasing no less than five new video clips to whet audiences’ appetites.\n\n‘GET OUT OF THERE’ – In this first sequence we witness the impact of Godzilla’s first onslaught, featuring Bryan Cranston as scientist Joe Brody and Juliette Binoche as his wife Sandra.\n\n‘MUTO’ – One thing fans are excited about is the addition of more Kaiju. In the original movies, Godzilla battled the likes of Rodan and Mothra. Unfortunately, Legendary didn’t license the rights to those characters, so instead, meet MUTO.\n\n‘GODZILLA VERSUS MUTO‘ – Elizabeth Olsen‘s character Elle Brody finds herself stranded in a battle between Godzilla and Muto and interestingly, the studio is not keeping the title monster under wraps, as is often the case with such movies.\n\n‘THE TRUTH‘ – Joe Brody demands answers for what the military is trying to cover up, concerning these creatures, in a scene that allows Cranston to show off his acting chops which earned him several awards during his stint on ‘Breaking Bad’.\n\n‘THIS IS MY JOB’ – Finally, Aaron Taylor-Johnson appears as Ford Brody and insists on journeying into the city to help fight Godzilla, stating that he is suited for the job.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you excited to see this new take on the classic movies?"
