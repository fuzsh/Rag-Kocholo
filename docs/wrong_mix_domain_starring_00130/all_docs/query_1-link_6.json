        "text": "Spiders, Godzilla and X-Men, Oh My!\n\nL\n\nove sequels? Then the cineplex is definitely going to be the place for you this summer.\n\nNo fewer than a dozen sequels will hit theaters in the coming months. Add in a few remakes, reimaginings and what have you, and there’s not much room left for originality at the movies this summer.\n\nOf course, this is nothing really new. Summer is the season for familiarity at the box office. But this recycling trend is certainly growing wider. In fact, many entertainment journalists now offer up two summer preview lists — one for the blockbusters and the other highlighting intriguing independent titles.\n\nThe following lineup attempts to mix in a little of both. Inevitably, some of the films will be surprise hits and others inexplicable misses. Whatever you choose to see this summer, choose wisely, and if you miss something, don’t worry. Another version of the same movie will probably be here before you know it.\n\n“The Amazing Spider-Man 2” (May 2): As long as superhero movies continue to mint money, the studios are going to keep making them. And Sony is hoping this trend never ends; this is its fifth Spider-Man title in 12 years. If Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone appear to have chemistry as Peter Parker and his girl Gwen Stacy, perhaps that’s because they’re actually in a relationship.\n\n“Neighbors” (May 9): For all its legendary status, “National Lampoon’s Animal House” did not really give rise to a string of frat-house pictures following its release in 1978. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne, as a couple living next door to a fraternity overseen by a largely shirtless Zac Efron, are set to give the genre another go with this comedy.\n\n“Godzilla” (May 16): The movies, too many to count, have been around now for 60 years. Here in the States, however, the last attempt, a 1998 film starring Matthew Broderick, was so awful that any new effort has a lot to live down. Based on trailers alone, the new version looks very portentous indeed, as any “Godzilla” flick should. Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Olsen star.\n\n“Million Dollar Arm” (May 16): Sports films may have a loyal fan base, but it’s limited in scope; take, for instance, “Draft Day.” This mild, family-friendly story about a baseball scout who travels to the cricket fields of India in search of good pitchers will attempt to cross over. In its favor is its star, Jon Hamm, taking a break from playing a miserable drunk on “Mad Men.”\n\n“X-Men: Days of Future Past” (May 23): The second superhero movie of the month and the sixth X-Men title since the turn of the century (but who’s counting?) is loaded with far too many comic-book characters, and A-list actors, to list here. But if “The Avengers” can get away with it, why not this franchise? Bryan Singer, who first got these movies rolling, is back as director.\n\n“Maleficent” (May 30): Marvel and DC Comics have nothing on Disney, which has a repository of characters too vast for words. The name of this film refers to the mistress of all evil from “Sleeping Beauty,” and while Disney has taken a page from the spandex playbook to tell yet another origin story, Angelina Jolie is perfectly cast as the title character.\n\n“A Million Ways to Die in the West” (May 30): Multi-hyphenate Seth MacFarlane (OK, so he wasn’t the greatest Oscar host) directs and stars in this “Blazing Saddles”-esque western that features a bevy of unusually disturbing deaths. For a comedy, it doesn’t so much break new ground as tread familiar territory, but on the other hand, it also stars Charlize Theron.\n\n“The Fault in Our Stars” (June 6): Rising star Shailene Woodley (Hollywood is always going to need a new ingenue) follows up “Divergent” with this young person’s love story in which the two main characters meet at a cancer support group. This is a very sad story, and the calendar reads June. The film might have gotten the audience it deserved at another time of year.\n\n“Edge of Tomorrow” (June 6): Tom Cruise stars in a futuristic action thriller with a twist, and yes, he’s been here before. Indeed, everything about this flick seems borrowed, from the high-tech exoskeletons (“Elysium”) to the characters being forced to relive the past over and over (“Groundhog Day”). Tom’s leading lady this time out is Emily Blunt.\n\n“22 Jump Street” (June 13): Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are too old to go undercover on a college campus, but then again, they were too old for high school in 2012’s “21 Jump Street” (the sequel finds these buddy cops moving across the street). Anyone who enjoyed these actors riffing off each other last time out can expect more of the same. Just don’t go looking for much more than that.\n\n“Jersey Boys” (June 20): It’s taken a while; the musical first hit Broadway in 2005. But the story — yes, an origin story — of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons appears to open up nicely to fit the big screen. Clint Eastwood might seem an odd choice to direct a musical, but we should be beyond second-guessing him by now. Lloyd Young, who won a Tony for playing Valli on stage, reprises the role here.\n\n“Transformers: Age of Extinction” (June 27): There are some distinctions. Shia LeBeouf, who no longer considers himself famous or whatever that is, has been replaced by Mark Wahlberg, a marked improvement. And this time out, for the first time, we have dinobots. But still, this is the fourth “Transformers” movie offered up to moviegoers. Talk about trying our patience.\n\n“Tammy” (July 2): Melissa McCarthy can really light up the screen in the right vehicle, but a little of her goes a long way. This comedy is built around her, was written by her and her husband, Ben Falcone, and was directed by him as well. The movie may serve as a litmus test on whether America’s love affair with McCarthy has reached its limit or is still going strong.\n\n“Begin Again” (July 4): Its working title, “Can a Song Save Your Life?,” may have been the better one, but I’m still more interested in seeing this movie than any other this summer. Mark Ruffalo stars as a failed music agent (think “Jerry Maguire”) who finds his salvation in an unblemished singer, portrayed by Keira Knightley. Music, New York City and big, big dreams — what’s not to like?\n\n“Boyhood” (July 11): Richard Linklater, director of the “Before” movies with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, spent more than 10 years on this fictional film about a child’s growing up, from infancy to adolescence, starring one boy named Ellar Coltrane. Nothing like this has been tried before, unless you count the “Up” documentary series, and early reviews are rapturous.\n\n“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” (July 11): A sci-fi concept this evergreen is destined to be rebooted until the end of time, or whenever monkeys take over the world. Tim Burton’s 2001 reboot crashed and burned, but 2011’s was surprisingly fresh. This follow-up to that is decidedly dark, but perhaps it’s time more moviegoers took notice of this determined film franchise.\n\n“A Most Wanted Man” (July 25): The late Philip Seymour Hoffman, in one of his last roles, stars in this international spy thriller based on a John le Carre novel, along with Willem Dafoe, Robin Wright and Rachel McAdams. Anyone who cares about movies is going to miss Hoffman’s familiar presence on the big screen. Such a loss.\n\n“Guardians of the Galaxy” (Aug. 1): The folks who see every movie that’s released, i.e. film critics, are whispering the loudest about this latest superhero launch. Another comic-book franchise? Yes, but this movie’s deeply ironic tone may be just what this increasingly repetitive genre needs, and given that one of the guardians is a raccoon, it’s probably appropriate.\n\n“Lucy” (Aug. 8): Scarlett Johansson, aka ScarJo, is enjoying a career that’s hotter than blazes right now, and this thriller by Luc Besson, who reinvigorated Liam Neeson’s rep a few years back with “Taken,” is hitting at just the right time. Once her character develops superhuman powers after ingesting a large quantity of drugs, the movie becomes very ambitious, so this could be a bit of a high-wire act.\n\n“Sin City: A Dame to Kill For” (Aug. 22): Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller have finally reunited for a sequel to a 2005 film that was pretty much just an exercise in style, but oh, what style. The pair have done their level best to splash the graphic-novel format across the screen. Starring are Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, Josh Brolin, Rosario Dawson and Lady Gaga.\n\nthill3@nncogannett.com\n\n419-521-7283\n\nTwitter: @ToddHillMNJ"
