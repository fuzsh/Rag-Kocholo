        "text": "Filmmaker Marc Webb, who scored a smash rebooting Spidey in 2012, says about his follow-up: \"I want to unleash my inner Michael Bay.\" Please, God, no! The emotional connection Webb established between Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker and Emma Stone as his girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, saved his first Amazing Spider-Man from overkill. Now there's a trio of villains – Jamie Foxx as Electro, Dane DeHaan as the Green Goblin, Paul Giamatti as the Rhino – and 3D action choreography. Thankfully, Webb (great name if you want to direct a web-slinger movie) says the story is still \"emotional and endearing.\" Whew!\n\nYes, the giant lizard is back. It would be tough to top the 1954 Japanese original, with its subtext about the evils of nuclear testing. (Though no less a 'Zilla-fan than Oscar winner Nicolas Cage has said not to discount 2001's Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah.) We sure as hell can forget the limp-dick Hollywood take in 1998, with Matthew Broderick. For 2014, director Gareth Edwards (Monsters) casts Bryan Cranston as a nuclear physicist who knows those rumblings under the sea are not from Mother Nature. No jokes about Heisenberg killing the beast in a meth lab. In this reboot, Godzilla and his minions are getting the best CGI money can buy. \"I love Godzilla,\" raves Cranston, \"more than King Kong.\" Fighting words, Mr. White.\n\nKids who grew up on Disney's animated 1959 classic Sleeping Beauty remember their fear of the evil witch. Now that villainess, Maleficent, has her own movie — and Angelina Jolie is playing her. Some Wall Street analysts believe the movie might be too scary for the wee ones, endangering the box office for the $130 million live-action fairy tale. Jolie really got into the part, admitting she took a bit of the character home to her and partner Brad Pitt's six children: \"Mom was a bit nutso for a period.\"\n\nIt doesn't sound so hot based on the premise: Tammy walks out on her cheating hubby to go on the road with her grandmother. But add Melissa McCarthy – taking her Oscar-nominated work in Bridesmaids to an uproarious new level – as the woman and Susan Sarandon as her granny, and suddenly Tammy, directed by McCarthy's husband, Ben Falcone, seems can't-miss. McCarthy says Falcone ran a delightful set for her and Sarandon. He jokingly retorts, \"I have to break my actors down completely to get what I need.\" Whatever it takes.\n\nGive thanks to Austin filmmaker Richard Linklater, who sneaks out gems from Slacker and Dazed and Confused to Bernie and the Before trilogy (Sunrise, Sunset and Midnight) with such understated regularity that ward-givers hardly take notice. Screw them. Linklater is a true poet of the everyday.\n\n12 Must-See Sundance Successes\n\nThe premise here is deceptively simple: Folow a boy from Texas, a child of divorce, as he grows from ages seven to 18, from kid stuff to college. Documentarian Michael Apted is doing something similar in his ongoing Up series. But Linklater is crafting a movie, a fiction featuring actors and a script. Mason, played by the remarkable Ellar Coltrane, interacts with dad Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke), mom (Patricia Arquette) and sister Samantha (a sass queen luminously acted by Lorelei Linklater, the director's daughter).\n\nShot in 39 days and covering 12 years, Boyhood flows seamlessly over two hours and 40 minutes as we watch characters age, argue, reconcile, mature or not. Hawke excels as a mostly absentee dad, while Arquette brings a poignant urgency to a mother hobbled by her knack for bringing home the wrong men. But the film belongs to Coltrane, especially as he shows us mason coping with the perils of pursuing a career in photography and his scholl's hottest girl (Zoe Graham). Linklater never overplays his hand with tear-jerking or dramatic excess. He knows the boy's heart, and in the process he captures ours."
