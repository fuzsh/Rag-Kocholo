        "text": "Starring: Seth MacFarlane (Ted), Charlize Theron (Prometheus), Amanda Seyfried (Les Miserables), Neil Patrick Harris (How I Met Your Mother), Giovanni Ribisi (Avatar), Sarah Silverman (Wreck-It Ralph), Liam Neeson (Non-Stop)\n\nDirector: Seth MacFarlane\n\nWriter: Alec Sulkin & Seth MacFarlane & Wellesley Wild (Ted)\n\nRuntime: 1 hour 56 minutes\n\nRelease Date: 30 May (US, UK)\n\nFollowing up on a huge success is a daunting task no matter what field you’re in. After being a prominent figure on TV for a while with the likes of Family Guy and American Dad, Ted was the feature debut of Seth MacFarlane and it was a glorious one at that. It was funny, endearing and was a box office smash with a sequel on the way. But before returning to familiar ground, MacFarlane has decided to venture out into the frontier for A Million Ways to Die in the West. Does this sophomore effort firmly establish him as a talent to watch, or is it shaky enough to make Ted seem like a lucky shot?\n\nPlot wise, Million Ways is pretty standard fare; from the start, it’s obvious how everything is going to play out. What separates the film is, of course, MacFarlane’s unique brand of humour, but unfortunately the comedy doesn’t always work mainly due to the inconsistent tone of the film. Whilst Ted had a very similar feel to MacFarlane’s TV shows so his humour translated with little effort, Million Ways plays it a little more serious and cinematic. When you get right down to it, the film is a sweet little love story surrounded by western trappings, but most of the jokes don’t mesh with the visual and tonal aesthetic. I get that they’re being on-purposely anachronistic, but a lot of the gags feel out of place or, even worse, really juvenile and unpleasant (laxatives and sheep dick, anyone?). Sure, there are plenty of laughs to be had, but there were no huge or quotable knee-slappers and for every chuckle I got there was a groaner or two that killed the vibe. The film is also somewhat hampered by poor structuring. For example, Giovanni Ribisi and Sarah Silverman’s characters and their subplot plays heavy in the first act of the movie but then they disappear until near the end and their story is wrapped up way too quickly, whilst Liam Neeson similarly disappears after one early scene before showing up for the final act. I will say the film is decently paced and I was never bored, but Million Ways has far too many bumps in the road for it to be a consistently pleasant journey.\n\nSeth MacFarlane is certainly a very talented person, and after hiding behind a CG bear in his last outing he takes centre stage here to…mixed results. MacFarlane is not a terrible actor and he remains a charming and likable screen presence, but my issue is less with the performance and more with the character MacFarlane has written for himself. Albert Stark often feels less like a rounded comedic character and more like a self-insert ‘woobie’ of a protagonist; Stark is constantly told what a kind, funny, stand-up guy he is whilst he constantly makes dry remarks and observations, and beyond gaining a little courage and hindsight he doesn’t change much by the end. MacFarlane ultimately lacks edge and comes off as way too simpering for his own good. Charlize Theron is a far more interesting character, managing to balance the serious and the comedic very deftly, but despite good chemistry with MacFarlane I never really got why she fell for this guy beyond “he’s nice”. Ribisi and Silverman’s subplot is one ripe for comedy, but the film constantly throws them under the bus and feel somewhat pointless by the end. Neil Patrick Harris’ snooty Foy got the most laughs out of me, though I felt he lacked a proper comeuppance by the end, whilst Amanda Seyfried feels like little else other than a plot device (somewhat intentionally, sure, but still bland). Liam Neeson plays the whole movie straight, which certainly works in his favour, but he lacks enough screen time to become a truly threatening presence. The film is also chock full of cameos; some of them are funny, but many of them feel inorganic and stop the movie out of nowhere with no relation to what is actually going on.\n\nMillion Ways certainly makes the effort to look like a classic Western, and on a technically level it certainly feels much more unique than most comedies. The music creates the perfect vibe, the costumes and production design feel authentic to the period, and even the cinematography evokes the cowboy tales of old (though I think shooting on film rather than digital would have helped add to rustic aesthetic they were going for).\n\nA Million Ways to Die in the West certainly isn’t a complete miss, but it barely passes by. The plot is basic and sloppy, the characters aren’t the best defined, and the humour throws far too many misses. But despite all of the obvious flaws I did find myself caught up thanks to MacFarlane and Theron’s chemistry, and there were just enough genuine laughs to keep me entertained. Fans of MacFarlane will probably enjoy it enough, especially those with less discerning tastes, but it’s nothing you need to see in the theatre and it certainly comes nowhere near the quality of the man’s previous efforts.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: 6/10\n\nStarring: Hugh Jackman (Prisoners), James McAvoy (Wanted), Michael Fassbender (12 Years A Slave), Jennifer Lawrence (The Hunger Games), Nicholas Hoult (Jack the Giant Slayer), Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones), Patrick Stewart (Star Trek: The Next Generation), Ian McKellen (The Lord of the Rings)\n\nDirector: Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects)\n\nWriter: Simon Kinberg (X-Men: The Last Stand)\n\nRuntime: 2 hours 11 minutes\n\nRelease Date: 22 May (UK), 23 May (US)\n\nThe X-Men film franchise has had its ups and downs over the past 14 years, with quality ranging from some of the best comic book movies out there to some of the worst. If only there was a way to fix all of these issues, getting rid of the plot holes and misconceived storylines that the lesser films have given us. Or is there? Bryan Singer, the man who started it all, has come back to the series to tie together two timelines and adapt one of the most beloved storylines from the comics in Days of Future Past. With such enormous hype and insurmountable goals, can this seventh instalment be as good as it possibly sounds?\n\nHaving read the original “Days of Future Past” storyline, I can say the film’s plot is certainly not a direct adaptation but does take a lot of the key elements as well as the spirit of the tale; comparable to how X2 was a loose adaptation of “God Loves, Man Kills”. But as a story on its own, it works tremendously well. The time travel element is a welcome addition to the X-Men flavour and it never feels like a cheap gimmick, evoking both The Terminator and Back to the Future in execution and style. The film is packed to the brim but it never feels overstuffed or weighty like some comic book movies do, and the pacing is so air-tight that it both breezes you through the story and leaves you wanting more (in a good way). I only have two minor gripes with the plot. Firstly, I felt the balance between the two timelines was a little imbalanced. Once Wolverine (Jackman) travels back, it’s a long time before we see the future cast again and they unfortunately don’t get as much to do. What we do get is great, but I would have loved to see maybe just a few more character moments or another action scene with them. And secondly, the method of time travel isn’t really explained too well: Kitty Pryde (Elliot Page) has suddenly gained the power to send people’s consciousnesses back in time with nary an explanation. They could have maybe put a few lines in to explain this, but they don’t and it bugged me a bit; it felt like little more than an excuse to keep Kitty an important part of the plot (as in the original story, she was the one who got sent back in time). But besides these niggles, Days of Future Past is a rollicking good time and one of the better stories from the X-Men series, especially with its sentimental ending that could easily move devout fans to tears (it nearly did fore me). By the way, there is an after credits scene, but unless you’re a serious comic nut you are going to have no idea what it means (perhaps even more confusing to the uninitiated than Thanos’ appearance in The Avengers).\n\nWhat the bad X-Men movies always forgot is that, at the heart of it all, the series is an ensemble piece about these complex and interesting characters and not just an excuse to throw special effects around. Days of Future Past remembers this key fact and makes it the centre of the entire piece. Whilst Wolverine is a key part of the story and Jackman himself is still as ace in the role as ever, the real focus still remains on the main trio from First Class: Xavier (McAvoy), Magneto (Fassbender) and Mystique (Lawrence). Their characters and their triangular relationship is so fundamental for the film to work and thankfully it does. McAvoy delivers the standout performance of the film, portraying a Charles Xavier far more bitter and sorrowful than we’ve ever seen. His contemptible attitude makes him almost unlikable at points, but McAvoy manages to balance it out well enough that we don’t forget the kind man we know he was and will become again, as shown in a wonderful scene where he meets his future self (Stewart). Fassbender and Lawrence’s characters have certainly advanced much more towards their characters’ demeanours in the original trilogy, but also still keeps those slivers of humanity that made them so sympathetic in First Class. It’s these three that really make the movie what it is and, not to detract from everyone else in the movie, that’s how it really should be. As cool as it is to see all these characters from the comics, X-Men shouldn’t be treated like a Roland Emmerich film with a cast of thousands of unimportant characters. When it comes to the other mutants in the story, they all play their part but none of them detract from the core cast nor do they feel like wasted fan service like certain characters did in The Last Stand or Origins. In terms of new players, the key ones are Peter Dinklage’s Bolivar Trask and Evan Peters’ Quicksilver. Dinklage is always great to watch and he delivers a fine performance, though as an antagonist he lacks the menace of, say, Brian Cox’s Stryker from X2. Peters doesn’t get a whole lot of screen time, but when he’s there he’s one of the film’s surprising revelations, adding some clever and much needed comic relief to the proceedings.\n\nDays of Future Past is easily the most visually distinctive of the X-Men films. The design of the apocalyptic future owes as much to Terminator as the film’s plot does, but it feels just unique enough to separate it from that classic franchise. Plenty of detail has also gone into the 1970s section of the film, creating a similar atmosphere to First Class with a slightly different twist. The action sequences continue to find new ways of exploiting all the impressive powers on display, key highlights being Blink’s (Fan Bingbing) ability to create portals (any fans of the Portal series will clearly have some fun here) and Quicksilver’s superspeed. The cinematography manages to keep these two disparate eras distinct but unified, as well as making fun use of Super 8 footage during certain scenes. The visual effects are better than ever, and it’s so wonderful to hear John Ottman back doing the score and to hear a remixed version of his excellent theme from X2.\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past is one of the best of the franchise, ranking up there with X2 and First Class easily, as well as one of the better comic book movies in recent memory. It weaves a great story that respects the source material whilst giving it a new spin, the cast put in tremendous work in both big and small parts, and it reveres the series’ past whilst remembering its mistakes and leaves you with a warm nostalgic feeling inside. The franchise could easily stop here and I would be satisfied, but they are continuing and as long as they stay this consistently good I think we never have to fear anything as horrible as Brett Ratner’s dirty fingers ever again.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: 9/10\n\nStarring: Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick-Ass), Ken Watanabe (Inception), Elizabeth Olsen (Kill Your Darlings), Sally Hawkins (Blue Jasmine), David Strathairn (Good Night, and Good Luck), Bryan Cranston (Argo)\n\nDirector: Gareth Edwards (Monsters)\n\nWriter: Max Borenstein\n\nRuntime: 2 hours 3 minutes\n\nRelease Date: 15 May (UK), 16 May (US)\n\nThe self-proclaimed King of the Monsters has returned to the big screen after a ten year hiatus (his last appearance being 2004’s Godzilla: Final Wars), and this time the Americans are taking another shot at it. After Roland Emmerich’s 1998 disaster of a disaster film, Monsters director Gareth Edwards has been given the reigns to try and salvage Godzilla’s reputation in the western world. In a land inhabited by Cloverfield, Transformers and Pacific Rim, is there room anymore for the original giant movie monster?\n\nRight off the bat, I can easily get this out of the way: yes, this is a much better film than the Emmerich version and a much more accurate representation of Godzilla himself. He looks like Godzilla, he sounds like Godzilla, and he does the things you expect Godzilla to do. But getting that part right alone won’t make this a good movie, so how does the rest of it pan out? Godzilla certainly takes itself very seriously and strikes a good tone. It’s pensive enough that you can buy the somewhat ridiculous premise, but not so po-faced that it sucks the enjoyment out of the picture. The film takes the right approach by being coy about showing us the monsters at first before unleashing them onto the world, but I felt the pacing consistently lagged. It takes just a tad too long to get to the action, and even once the plot gets really going there’s too much time spent away from the main event. The film has about enough plot for a 90 minute romp, but it feels needlessly stretched out to just over two hours. When the film finally gets to its big climax it does deliver on its promise, but it feels less like a treat for your patience and more like an apology for the delay: you’re glad it’s finally here and you feel satisfied by the quality, but you can’t shake the fact that it should have come sooner.\n\nI could accept the long stretches spent on the human characters if they were interesting, but that’s the problem: they’re not. The film’s cast is impressive and they give it their all at every chance they can get, but their roles all feel a bit thinly drawn. Taylor-Johnson’s Ford Brody is your basic stock protagonist with no flourish: the brave hero with a family to get back to, a connection to the crisis at hand, and with just the right skills needed to help avert it. He feels too much like a passive observer of the narrative; an avatar for the audience to inhabit while they watch all of the excitement but doing very little to engage with it. Up until the climax, Brody never impacts the plot in a significant way and he’s only given the barest of motivations to keep going. That motivation happens to be played by Elizabeth Olsen, who shares good chemistry with Taylor-Johnson but their screen time together is minimal and we aren’t given enough time to connect with them as much as the film thinks we are. Pretty much everyone else feels like an archtype, but ones cast with really good actors. Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins play the classic “scientists that initially hide the truth as they try to avert disaster”, whilst David Strathairn is stuck with the old reliable “military man who will take drastic measures that threaten others in order to end the disaster earlier and ignores the scientists’ better solution”. They all do it very well, but it’s hard to excuse stereotypes especially when they play them so straight. Only Bryan Cranston manages to break this mould and he delivers a powerhouse performance despite the script’s deficiencies. Sure, he’s also stuck playing the traditional “crazy scientist who saw it all coming but nobody believes him” role, but Cranston sells it through sheer force of personality. He’s easily the acting highlight of the movie, and it’s a shame his screen time is fairly limited.\n\nWhere Godzilla thankfully shines is all in the spectacle. On a technical level, this gets everything pretty much right. The action sequences, when they decide to show up, are phenomenal. The scope and choreography of them is stupendous to behold, packed with plenty of crumbling buildings, fiery explosions and monsters throwing each other about. The cinematography really shows off the scale of the entire production, and the moody colours and lighting help sell a world in peril. The visual effects are top notch, creating the most believable and accurate representation of Godzilla on screen so far, and the design of him and the other creatures are interesting and unique. The sound design is masterful, with thunderous thumps and reverberant roars kicking in at all the right moments, and Alexandre Desplat’s score is saturnine and oozing with dread. If you can see this movie in IMAX, do so; the size of it all alone is worth the price of admission.\n\nGodzilla is an enjoyable film for the most part. The tone is well balanced, the action scenes are exhilarating and it represents Godzilla himself in the way he should be. But the story’s pacing issues and bland characters do put a serious damper on the fun. I understand that the film needs human characters, as Godzilla himself doesn’t have a personality to hold the entire film, but the humans don’t seem to have much persona either so it doesn’t work. Next time around, either give us more compelling characters or just make the movie about Godzilla; a remake of Destroy All Monsters done in this style would be much appreciated.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: 7.5/10\n\nStarring: Arnold Schwarzenegger (The Terminator), Sam Worthington (Avatar), Olivia Williams (The Sixth Sense), Terrence Howard (Prisoners), Mireille Enos (World War Z)\n\nDirector: David Ayer (End of Watch)\n\nWriters: Skip Woods (A Good Day to Die Hard) and David Ayer\n\nRuntime: 1 hour 49 minutes\n\nRelease Date: 28 March (US), 7 May (UK)\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger has had a surprisingly hard time since coming back to the movies. Aside from The Expendables franchise (where he only makes glorified cameos anyway), his recent fare has been either critically panned, done poorly at the box office, or both; a real step down for the man who helped define a generation of action movies. So does teaming up with the man behind End of Watch and Training Day seem like a good idea? On paper: sure. But in execution? Unfortunately no.\n\nSkip Woods, easily the worst screenwriter working in Hollywood right now, has struck again with this one, but with Ayer doing rewrites and directing you’d hope he could do something to make Sabotage watchable. But he hasn’t, and what ends up on screen is a sloppy mess. The plot outline seems good in concept, mixing hardcore action with mystery-thriller, but the actual script lets everything down. The pacing is horrendous, making what should feel like edge-of-your-seat thrills feel like a chore. The plot feels needlessly complicated and goes on for too long, and the reveals are so obvious because the film doesn’t cover its tracks well enough. Note to Mr. Woods: when you want to create a mystery, you make it seem plausible that it could be anyone. You don’t go sticking flashing arrows over the culprits, because it not only makes all the other characters look like idiots but it bores your audience to tears. The film’s tone is all over the place too, mixing crude humour with extremely violent imagery but in a way that doesn’t work at all, and even the film’s morals seem mangled and confusing.\n\nWoods seems to only have two character archetypes that he keeps using over and over again: bland or obnoxious. He made Wolverine a stodgy brute, he wrote John McClane as an ignorant blockhead, and now he’s managed the impossible: making Arnold Schwarenegger boring. The man just has nothing to work with here, and so he’s left feeling cold and uninteresting. I get that he’s played a much darker individual than usual, but Schwarzenegger doesn’t pull it off and his character’s motivations are left unclear until so late into the film that you just don’t care. The rest of his DEA team are just as flat. Sam Worthington continues to be the blandest man in movies despite his attempts to look tough, Mireille Enos comes off as so batsh*t insane that you can’t believe this woman would ever work for the government, and everyone else is just forgettable. When Josh Holloway’s name popped up in the credits, I had genuinely forgotten that he was in the movie. That’s how unmemorable most of the characters are. All you will remember about this band of twats is that their banter is annoying beyond belief. The only person I felt any connection to was Olivia Williams, mainly because she spends most of her time calling out all these character on their bullsh*t.\n\nThe film has that same gritty look that all of Ayer’s films have, utilising a lot of grimy locales and handheld photography. When the film finally gets to the action scenes, which are spread way too thinly across the runtime, they’re actually not too bad; a car chase near the end of the film I’d even call pretty fun. But it’s not worth sitting through everything else to get to it.\n\nSabotage holds the honour of being one of the most boring and irritating films I’ve seen in a long time. The story is messy and fails to follow up on its intriguing premise, the characters are one-dimensional and contemptible, and…you know what? That’s all I need to say. You fail at story and character, you fail overall by default. I don’t care if the action’s decent. David Ayer has done much better than this, and hopefully will continue to. As for Skip Woods? All I have to say is: who keeps hiring this schmuck?\n\nFINAL VERDICT: 2/10\n\nStarring: Seth Rogen (Pineapple Express), Zac Efron (Hairspray), Rose Byrne (X-Men: First Class), Dave Franco (21 Jump Street), Ike Barinholtz (The Mindy Project), Lisa Kudrow (Easy A)\n\nDirector: Nicholas Stoller (Forgetting Sarah Marshall)\n\nWriters: Andrew Jay Cohen & Brendan O’Brien\n\nRuntime: 1 hour 36 minutes\n\nRelease Date: 3 May (UK), 9 May (US)\n\nThe frat house comedy is a subgenre that just never dies. Ever since John Landis kick-started the trend with Animal House, every couple of years there comes along a movie that tries to become its generation’s Animal House. Revenge of the Nerds, Van Wilder, Old School, the list goes on. So how does Bad Neighbours (or just Neighbors as it is called in the US, changed overseas likely to avoid confusion with a certain Australian soap opera) fare against such a wide fair of similar offerings? Does it pass the test and join the fraternity, or is this one pledge that’s going to chicken out?\n\nBad Neighbours is a breath of fresh air for the genre mainly because it views the proceedings from a fresh perspective. The film is primarily from the point of view of the sensible adults for once but without making them look like spoilsports. They call out the frats on their behaviour, but they also get in on the fun every once in a while and even end up doing some devious stuff themselves. But that’s not to say that the frats themselves are one-dimensional obnoxious twats, no sir. Their perspective is painted with just enough sympathy that you never hate them completely even when they go over the line. The film manages to strike a good balance between the two sides, never making either one seem too despicable whilst still making both of them funny and entertaining. The story even manages to have morals better written than most comedies of this ilk, with Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne’s characters learning to be responsible adults without becoming curmudgeons, and Zac Efron coming to realise that his life as a party animal is coming to a close. It’s effort like this that makes Bad Neighbours that much more entertaining and not just a lazy hodgepodge of sex and stoner gags.\n\nSeth Rogen may not have much range as an actor, but he’s dependable and always worth a few laughs. He is playing a somewhat more responsible character with a job, a wife and a kid on his shoulders, but he’s still the pot-smoking dunderhead we’ve all come to love. His chemistry with Byrne is surprisingly good, working off each other both comedically and emotionally well enough that I bought them as a couple. Zac Efron, much like Rogen, has also been somewhat typecast as the pretty boy for most of his career and he’s always been, somewhat unfairly, thrashed about. Sure, he was in those High School Musical movies, but every other Hollywood teen crush was in a similar position at some point in their careers. Efron has proven himself to be a pretty decent actor at points (see the criminally underrated Me & Orson Welles for proof of that), and in Bad Neighbours he both transcends expectations and does well doing so. He manages to be everything you want from a stereotypical bro-douche, but imbues his role with enough character and motivation that he comes off like a somewhat real person and not someone you want to punch in the face, and he even plays off against Rogen startlingly well. It’s the most surprising comedic turn I’ve seen from an actor since Channing Tatum in 21 Jump Street, and I’d be happy to see him continue in this fashion. The rest of the cast works but don’t get a lot of focus. Dave Franco is pretty good; especially when opposite Efron (a scene where they exchange plentiful variations of the “bros before hoes” mantra is a particularly good moment). Ike Barinholtz also gets some good laughs, but everyone else just comes and goes. Lisa Kudrow is relegated to two brief scenes, Submarine’s Craig Roberts melds into the background for half the movie before being given something to do, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse feels completely wasted. His subplot with Barinholtz and Carla Gallo is seriously underdeveloped and mostly pointless. Why even hire McLovin if you’re not going to do anything with him?\n\nComedies aren’t usually where you go looking for a technical extravaganza, but Bad Neighbours does manage to look a bit more distinctive. The party scenes in particular look great, with lots of neon and pastels flying around to give these sections a different feel to the rest of the movie. Brandon Trost has become one of my favourite cinematographers lately, and he again proves he can make anything look cool. This is the guy who shot Crank 2, what else would you expect?\n\nBad Neighbours works because it puts in far more effort than you’d expect. It’s got all the laughs you want from a frat house comedy, but sweetens the deal with a well-conceived screenplay, relatable human characters, and excellent performances to carry it all. It’s not exactly revolutionary, but it is a lot of fun.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: 8.5/10"
