        "text": "In what has become a tradition on the blog, it is time to revisit the cinematic season that transpired ten years ago. In 2014, that meant the warmer months were ruled by a ragtag group of relatively unknown Marvel superheroes (at least compared to your Spideys, Batmen, and Supermen, etc…).\n\nAudiences might have been hooked on the feelings these MCU characters gave them, but they were also transfixed by apes, giant lizards, and pizza chomping turtles.\n\nLet’s take a trip down a decade old memory lane with the top 10 domestic earners of summer ’14 as well as other noteworthy pics and significant flops.\n\n10. How to Train Your Dragon 2\n\nDomestic Gross: $177 million\n\nWhile the DreamWorks Animation sequel couldn’t match or exceed the gross of its 2010 predecessor at $217 million, the fantasy tale won the Golden Globe for its genre and was Oscar nominated for Animated Feature. A sequel would follow five years later.\n\n9. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n\nDomestic Gross: $191 million\n\nWith Michael Bay producing and Megan Fox starring, the transformation of this franchise from the 1990s to the 21st century was a financial if not critical success. A sequel which made less cash came two summers later.\n\n8. 22 Jump Street\n\nDomestic Gross: $191 million\n\nChanning Tatum and Jonah Hill’s second go-round as hapless cops (this time graduating to going undercover at college instead of high school) outpaced the 2012 original financially. A third Street never arrived (there was a rumored crossover with the Men in Black series), but Tatum has recently spoken of his desire to get the ball rolling.\n\n7. Godzilla\n\nDomestic Gross: $200 million\n\nIt might be the 30th overall feature in the Godzilla franchise, but this monster mash from Gareth Edwards achieved some of the series’ best reviews and kicked off the MonsterVerse that is still wreaking havoc at multiplexes. It also assisted in washing away dirty memories of Roland Emmerich’s 1998 summertime treatment with Matthew Broderick\n\n6. The Amazing Spider-Man 2\n\nDomestic Gross: $202 million\n\nWhile it made over $200 million domestic, Andrew Garfield’s return to the Spidey suit was seen as underwhelming with critics and audiences. Planned sequels didn’t materialize though Garfield and head villain Jamie Foxx would reprise their roles in 2021’s Spider-Man: No Way Home.\n\n5. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\n\nDomestic Gross: $208 million\n\nThe follow-up to 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Matt Reeves took over directorial duties. The result was critical acclaim as Dawn became the long running franchise’s largest grosser. Two sequels (including Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes in May) have followed.\n\n4. X-Men: Days of Future Past\n\nDomestic Gross: $233 million\n\nThis sequel combined cast members from the 2000-06 trilogy including Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine, Ian McKellen’s Magneto, Patrick Stewart’s Professor X, and Halle Berry’s Storm with some of their younger counterparts from 2011’s X-Men: First Class like Michael Fassbender’s Magneto and James McAvoy’s Professor X (as well as Jennifer Lawrence’s Mystique). The result is the highest earning pic with X-Men in the title. With the exception of the Deadpool success that followed two years later, direct sequels Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix failed to replicate the success here.\n\n3. Maleficent\n\nDomestic Gross: $241 million\n\nAfter the massively profitable live-action remake of their animated Alice in Wonderland four years earlier, Disney continued the trend with Maleficent. Angelina Jolie starred as the Sleeping Beauty villainess and a 2019 sequel earned less than half of the total of this domestically.\n\n2. Transformers: Age of Extinction\n\nDomestic Gross: $245 million\n\nShia LaBeouf exited Michael Bay’s robotic mayhem and Mark Wahlberg entered this fourth entry. A billion in receipts worldwide resulted in making this 2014’s best worldwide grosser. Sequels are still coming and the latest Transformers: Rise of the Beasts hit a lower $157 million last year.\n\n1. Guardians of the Galaxy\n\nDomestic Gross: $233 million\n\nThis was the 10th feature in the MCU and it seemed like the first that could be a financial question mark. The heroes weren’t as familiar to audiences, but James Gunn’s tale of eccentric comic characters took by the box office by storm. Two sequels have followed in addition to Guardians appearances in other MCU sagas.\n\nAnd now let’s cover some other flicks from ’14 that had crowds and critics chatting.\n\nNeighbors\n\nDomestic Gross: $150 million\n\nThe comedic teaming of Seth Rogen and Zac Efron caused this fraternal experience to be the season’s most fruitful original comedy. A less regarded sequel came two years later.\n\nLucy\n\nDomestic Gross: $126 million\n\nTwo summers after The Avengers set records, Scarlett Johansson had a solid sci-fi action grosser with Luc Besson’s concoction.\n\nThe Fault in Our Stars\n\nDomestic Gross: $124 million\n\nJohn Green’s phenomenon of a YA romance bestseller became a blockbuster with decent reviews highlighting the chemistry of leads Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort.\n\nEdge of Tomorrow\n\nDomestic Gross: $100 million\n\nDoug Liman’s sci-fi actioner with elements of Groundhog Day was not a sizable hit upon release. However, the Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt led title’s reputation has grown since with occasional rumors of another Tomorrow.\n\nLet’s Be Cops\n\nDomestic Gross: $82 million\n\nThis buddy cop pic was an out of nowhere late season surprise with over $100 million globally against a meager $17 million budget. Unlike nearly all other movies I’ve spoken of above, a sequel (somehow) did not happen.\n\nChef\n\nDomestic Gross: $31 million\n\nAfter helming two ginormous Iron Man chapters and a disappointment with Cowboys and Aliens, Jon Favreau cooked up critical cred and impressive midsize numbers with this road dramedy.\n\nBoyhood\n\nDomestic Gross: $25 million\n\nShot over a span of a decade, Richard Linklater’s unique coming-of-age drama remains the best reviewed picture of the 21st century according to Metacritic. Six Oscar nods, including a Supporting Actress victory for Patricia Arquette, were among its many plaudits.\n\nSnowpiercer\n\nDomestic Gross: $4 million\n\nBong Joon-Ho, who would make the BP winning Parasite five years later, garnered acclaim for this post-apocalyptic pic that would eventually spawn a TV series.\n\nOK, so not all 2014 summer sagas were prosperous and here’s some that were considered commercial and/or critical disappointments.\n\nHercules\n\nDomestic Gross: $72 million\n\nBrett Ratner’s version of the Greek god wreaking havoc on his enemies cast Dwayne Johnson in the lead. The grosses were actually fairly decent, but I’m sure the studio were hoping for nine figures stateside… and does anyone even mention this movie anymore?\n\nJersey Boys\n\nDomestic Gross: $47 million\n\nThe original play earned Tonys but audiences mostly tuned out Clint Eastwood’s take on the decades spanning musical drama.\n\nBlended\n\nDomestic Gross: $46 million\n\nThe Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates were each lucrative rom coms with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. The third time was not the charm with moviegoers or reviewers.\n\nA Million Ways to Die in the West\n\nDomestic Gross: $43 million\n\nFamily Guy creator Seth MacFarlane ruled the comedic box office in summer 2012 with Ted. This follow-up starring him and Charlize Theron didn’t hit the bullseye.\n\nThe Expendables 3\n\nPredicted Gross: $39 million\n\nThe previous two action headliners with Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Statham, and Snipes and others did well. For inexplicable reasons, a PG-13 rating was slapped on this third one and audiences turned their nose up for what they wanted to be R-rated violence. A fourth (and also unsuccessful) pic came out last year.\n\nSex Tape\n\nPredicted Gross: $38 million\n\nJason Segel and Cameron Diaz couldn’t cause people to cue up this raunchy comedy which played to mostly empty establishments.\n\nSin City: A Dame to Kill For\n\nDomestic Gross: $13 million\n\nThe first Sin City in 2005 made nearly $30 million in its first weekend while this sequel grossed less than half that figure total. The comic book adaptation co-directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller might stand as the biggest flop of the season.\n\nAnd that’s your recap, folks! Hope you enjoyed this walk down memory lane and I’ll have a post about summer 2015 up in the summer of 2025!\n\nRate this:\n\nThis little blog of mine is over 10 years old now and a summer tradition has been to highlight the cinematic seasons of 30, 20, and 10 years ago. We saw recaps of 1992, 2002, and 2012 around this time in 2022. Now this site is aged enough that I shall only look back at a decade ago. Therefore let’s shine a light on 2013 and the offerings between May and August.\n\nHere’s how it works. I’ll recount the top 10 grossers domestically as well as other notable features and noteworthy flops. It was the summer after The Avengers dominated and Tony Stark still managed to rule in his own franchise.\n\nLet the countdown begin!\n\n10. The Great Gatsby\n\nDomestic Gross: $144 million\n\nBaz Luhrmann’s second collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio may have drawn mixed critical reaction, but audiences turned up and it won both Oscars it was nominated for (Production Design and Costume Design). It is still the stylish filmmaker’s largest worldwide earner even with last year’s success of Elvis.\n\n9. We’re the Millers\n\nDomestic Gross: $150 million\n\nJennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis headlined this raunchy comedy from Dodgeball maker Rawson Marshall Thurber. Like Gatsby, critics weren’t overly kind but crowds liked what they saw.\n\n8. The Heat\n\nDomestic Gross: $159 million\n\nSandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy (hot off Bridesmaids) teamed up for this buddy cop laugher from Paul Feig and it became the summer’s hottest live-action movie in its genre. Bullock would have a massive earner and Oscar nod in the fall with Gravity.\n\n7. World War Z\n\nDomestic Gross: $202 million\n\nSome had it pegged as a potential financial disappointment, but this would turn out to be the biggest grossing zombie flick ever. Despite Brad Pitt’s presence and plenty of development rumors, a planned sequel has yet to materialize.\n\n6. Star Trek Into Darkness\n\nDomestic Gross: $228 million\n\nJJ Abrams helmed this sequel two and a half years before taking on Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It holds the title of best global earning movie of the franchise.\n\n5. Fast & Furious 6\n\nDomestic Gross: $238 million\n\nVin Diesel and Paul Walker revved the series to unforeseen moneymaking heights at the time though part 7 would outdo it two years later. Six months after 6‘s release, Walker perished tragically in auto accident.\n\n4. Monsters University\n\nDomestic Gross: $268 million\n\nThe long gestating sequel to 2001’s Monsters University was a profitable venture for Pixar. It failed to nab an Animated Feature nod from the Academy (rare for the studio), but Disney likely wept into their cash.\n\n3. Man of Steel\n\nDomestic Gross: $291 million\n\nThe first picture in the DCEU came with gargantuan expectations with Zack Snyder directing and Henry Cavill donning the S. Reaction from critics and audiences was all over the map. Compared to this summer with the epic failure of The Flash, these were kinda the good ole days for DC.\n\n2. Despicable Me 2\n\nDomestic Gross: $368 million\n\nIllumination dwarfed Pixar in the animated race with this sequel that became parent studio Universal’s most profitable film of all time. It’s also responsible for the season’s ubiquitous ditty “Happy” from Pharrell Williams.\n\n1. Iron Man 3\n\nDomestic Gross: $409 million\n\nTony Stark’s third solo adventure was generally considered an improvement on #2 as Shane Black handled the behind the camera work. It ended up as the year’s second best grosser behind November’s The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.\n\nNow for some others worthy of discussion:\n\nThe Conjuring\n\nDomestic Gross: $137 million\n\nIt might be just outside the top ten in 11th, but James Wan’s horror classic spawned a decade’s worth of sequels (two thus far) and spin-offs (Annabelle, The Nun) with no end in sight.\n\nNow You See Me\n\nDomestic Gross: $117 million\n\nThe heist pic from Louis Leterrier (who just directed Fast X) was a sleeper smash with a $350 million worldwide haul. A less regarded sequel came in 2016.\n\nThe Butler\n\nLee Daniels helmed this decades spanning tale of Forest Whitaker’s White House employee with Oprah Winfrey as his troubled wife. The studio was likely hoping for more awards attention than it ended up with, but the earnings were impressive.\n\nPacific Rim\n\nDomestic Gross: $101 million\n\nGuillermo del Toro’s monster mashup didn’t wow with a significant domestic take, but the overseas dollars were enough to spawn a panned 2018 sequel. The international haul makes it the Oscar winner’s personal best.\n\nThis Is the End\n\nDomestic Gross: $101 million\n\nThis end of the world saga from Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg was a star studded (from Michael Cera to Rihanna) dark comedy with critics on its side.\n\nThe Purge\n\nDomestic Gross: $64 million\n\nThis dystopian horror pic launched another money minting series and was an early sleeper success for Blumhouse.\n\nBlue Jasmine\n\nPredicted Gross: $33 million\n\nThat number marks an impressive one for Woody Allen in the 21st century and this nabbed Cate Blanchett a Best Actress Academy Award.\n\nFruitvale Station\n\nDomestic Gross: $16 million\n\nMarking the first collaboration between Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan, this indie drama was a critical darling. The pair would achieve colossal success in the years to follow with Creed and Black Panther.\n\nThere were lots of hits a decade ago. Yet there’s always the projects that don’t match expectations.\n\nThe Hangover Part III\n\nDomestic Gross: $112 million\n\nAudiences were growing weary of The Wolf Pack in the lambasted third entry. It came in well below the previous two.\n\nElysium\n\nDomestic Gross: $93 million\n\nNeill Blomkamp’s District 9 in 2009 was nominated for Best Picture. This sci-fi follow up with Matt Damon was considered a letdown by not joining the century club.\n\nThe Lone Ranger\n\nDomestic Gross: $89 million\n\nI’m gonna go ahead and say you couldn’t green light this $250 million adventure starring Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer today. It turns out Disney shouldn’t have 10 years ago as this came in far under expectations. The box office magic that director Gore Verbinski and Depp created with Pirates of the Caribbean was gone.\n\nWhite House Down\n\nPredicted Gross: $73 million\n\nRoland Emmerich’s latest with Channing Tatum as a secret service agent and Jamie Foxx as POTUS had its thunder stolen in the spring by the similarly themed and better regarded Olympus Has Fallen (which spawned two sequels).\n\nAfter Earth\n\nPredicted Gross: $60 million\n\nMoviegoers slapped down M. Night Shyamalan’s sci-fi epic starring the father son duo of Will and Jaden Smith. Reviews were harsh with a 12% Rotten Tomatoes rating.\n\nThe Internship\n\nDomestic Gross: $44 million\n\nVince Vaughn and Owen Wilson’s 2005 romp Wedding Crashers was a $209 million earning smash. Eight years later, very few signed up for this forgettable reunion.\n\nR.I.P.D.\n\nPredicted Gross: $33 million\n\nIt might have been going for the Men in Black crowd, but audiences shunned this sci-fi comedy with Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds. Somehow a direct to DVVD prequel was commissioned and released last year.\n\nAnd there you have it! A look back at 2013 in the multiplex. I’ll have a 2014 recap conjured up next summer…\n\nRate this:\n\nMy Case Of posts will for the ten Best Picture hopefuls is past the halfway point as we consider the pros and cons of our sixth competitor The Fabelmans.\n\nThe Case for The Fabelmans:\n\nSteven Spielberg’s 13th movie to be nominated for BP (only Schindler’s List won) is his most personal as arguably today’s most iconic director gets autobiographical. It was first seen at the Toronto Film Festival where it took the People’s Choice Award. That’s a prize shared by later Oscar winners such as The King’s Speech, 12 Years a Slave, Green Book, and Nomadland. At the Golden Globes, it had a big night as it was bestowed Best Motion Picture (Drama) and Spielberg nabbed the directorial trophy. A victory here could be seen as a genuine thank you for its maker’s cinematic contributions.\n\nThe Case Against The Fabelmans:\n\nThat genuine thank you could just as easily come with Spielberg being Best Director and BP going to something else. Despite the Globes love, BAFTA was shockingly dismissive as its sole nomination is for screenplay. At Critics Choice, it went a mere 1/11 with Gabriel LaBelle as Best Young Actor (a non-existent Academy race). While the seven nominations are decent, there were notable omissions including Film Editing and Cinematography. It’s also undeniably a box office dud with $16 million at press time.\n\nOther Nominations:\n\nDirector (Spielberg), Actress (Michelle Williams), Supporting Actor (Judd Hirsch), Original Screenplay, Original Score, Production Design\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nThere is a universe in which The Fabelmans gets BP and Director, but I would put it behind Everything Everywhere All at Once and The Banshees of Inisherin right now. An Ensemble win at SAG could help momentum.
