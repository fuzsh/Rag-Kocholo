        "text": "When Lionsgate first announced that they were developing a genre project called Cobweb, the company – which had previously brought us horror films like The Devil’s Rejects, Cabin Fever, the Hostel films, and of course the Saw franchise – said they were doing so with the intention of taking back their “ownership” of horror. But the movie doesn’t seem to have made much of an impact since reaching theatres at the end of last month. We previously heard that Cobweb will be getting a Blu-ray, DVD, and digital release on September 12th (copies of the Blu-ray and DVD releases can be pre-ordered at THIS LINK)… but now it has been revealed that the digital release is actually going to happen this Friday, August 11th! The digital version of the film can be pre-ordered right HERE.\n\nOur own Tyler Nichols thought the movie was good enough to give it an 8/10 review.\n\nDirected by Samuel Bodin, who created Netflix’s short-lived French horror series Marianne, from a screenplay by Chris Thomas Devlin (Leatherface), Cobweb has the following synopsis: Eight-year-old Peter is plagued by a mysterious, constant tap, tap from inside his bedroom wall – a tapping that his parents insist is all in his imagination. As Peter’s fear intensifies, he believes that his parents could be hiding a terrible, dangerous secret and questions their trust. And for a child, what could be more frightening than that?\n\nWe previously saw a synopsis that said a boy’s abusive parents have always told him the voices he hears in the walls of his house are only in his head. But when he discovers that they’re real, he conspires to let them out.\n\nThe film stars Lizzy Caplan (Fatal Attraction), Antony Starr (The Boys), Cleopatra Coleman (Infinity Pool), and Woody Norman (C’mon C’mon).\n\nCobweb was produced by Point Grey’s Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, and James Weaver, along with Vertigo Entertainment’s Roy Lee. Vertigo’s Andrew Childs serves as executive producer with Jonathan McCoy and Josh Fagen, who oversaw the project for Point Grey. Jim Miller and Meredith Wieck oversaw the project for Lionsgate.\n\nWill you be watching the digital release of Cobweb this weekend? Let us know by leaving a comment below."
