        "text": "Director: Gareth Edwards Writer: Max Borenstein, Dave Callaham Starring: Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, Juliette Binoche Running Time: 123 Minutes Year: 2014\n\nGareth Edwards feature debut, Monsters, served as proof this man knows what to show, and what to leave to the nerdy recesses of your imagination. A modest flick it presented an intimate approach to monster invasion, the antithesis to Roland Emmerich’s bumbling brawl back in 1998. Choosing the Brit to helm the next big screen outing of Japan’s spikiest export, Godzilla, was no wild stab in the dark.\n\nRead More\n\nDirector: Anthony and Joe Russo Writer: Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely Starring: Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Redford Running Time: 136 Minutes Year: 2014\n\nThe Quite Nice Avenger, Captain America (Chris Evans), returns for his sophomore solo feature-length effort further unraveling the vast, vast landscape which is Marvel’s Cinematic Universe. If this were a high-budget comic actioner opening a new franchise, reviewing the flick would be a different proposition. As it stands, Captain America: The Winter Soldier serves as a lynchpin tying itself to the earlier Cap standalone flick and The Avengers. And all the other Avengers standalone movies. Which is where the limitations of any of Marvel’s features come to the fore; can they ensnare new fans, satisfy existing movie fans and do a good enough job of tackling the massive comic book canon?\n\nRead More\n\nDirector: Gore Verbinski Writer: Justin Haythe, Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio Starring: Johnny Depp, Armie Hammer, Tom Wilkinson Running Time: 149 Minutes Year: 2013\n\nGore Verbinski’s passion for Westerns is no secret. Following on from his animated kids flick with a heart, Rango, The Lone Ranger prowls deeper into the myths and legends of its titular character. It sets its sights on bringing the sheer awe of the plains and mountains of Texas into the fore as much as any of its leading characters. This first and foremost sets the tone and hints at a style previously witnessed in Pirates Of The Caribbean. This isn’t a small time flick about an outlaw. It’s a grandiose beast held together by a minimum of at least half a dozen exciting action sequences.\n\nRead More\n\nDirector: Paul Feig Writer: Katie Dippold Starring: Sandra Bullock, Melissa McCarthy Running Time: 117 Minutes Year: 2013\n\nPaul Feig’s Bridesmaids was not a fluke, folks. The Heat is here as bona fide evidence. We should all feel very lucky indeed, as it features two of cinema’s finest funnygals charging towards each other, drunk, wearing dumpster-ready outfits with mouthfuls of comedy gold.\n\nRead More\n\nDirector: Guillermo Del Toro Writer: Travis Beacham, Guillermo Del Toro Starring: Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi Running Time: 132 Minutes Year: 2013\n\nA fleet of giant monsters attack the planet, and humans create giant robots to defeat them. Who doesn’t want to see that played out on the big screen? It’s every fanboy’s dream, from the early Godzilla romps through Tokyo, to Cloverfield. An extinction event at the hands of scaly gargantuans from the deep is enough to whet the appetite of even the casual viewer. It screams of fun.\n\nRead More\n\nDirector: Richard Linklater Writer: Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy, Ethan Hawke Starring: Julie Delpy, Ethan Hawke Running Time: 109 Minutes Year: 2013\n\nThis review appears courtesy of Derby QUAD Blog\n\nRounding out trilogies is a feat no filmmaker can undertake without thinking of the diehard fans. Ensuring all loose ends are tied up, throwing in cheeky nods to forgotten elements of the first, ratcheting up the action….they all require careful attention. For lovers of the original two instalments of Richard Linklater’s trilo-talkie, there’s nothing left unsaid in Before Midnight. It will entrance you completely, blinding you with the ruthlessness of true romance and the joy in our opposites. You’ll rise from your seat, with an urge to leave your phone alone for a few hours and go for a walk with someone you care about.\n\nRead More\n\nDirector: Neil Jordan Writer: Moira Buffini Starring: Gemma Arterton, Saoirse Ronan, Jonny Lee Miller Running Time: 118 Minutes Year: 2012\n\nThis review appears courtesy of Derby QUAD Blog\n\nDirector Neil Jordan is no stranger to the blood sucking ways of the vampire. Adapting Ann Rice’s Interview With The Vampire back in 1994, he brought the luscious blood splatter of the fang-toothed ones to life and wrung out a winning turn from a young Kirsten Dunst. Byzantium’s world isn’t a million miles away from the domain in which Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt skulked.\n\nRead More\n\nDirector: Shawn Levy Writer: Vince Vaughn, Jared Stern Starring: Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Rose Byrne Running Time: 119 Minutes Year: 2013\n\nThose schticksters of comedy, Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn have been reunited for the first time since 2005’s Wedding Crashers for The Internship. Their irresponsible hijinks have been cast aside this time around, as they take on the role of two salesmen from Arizona. After losing their jobs, they trek to California in the pursuit of the American dream. A newly realised American dream; that of a bagging an internship at Google.\n\nRead More\n\nDirector: Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg Writer: Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg Starring: Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride Running Time: 107 Minutes Year: 2013\n\nHollywood’s giant bulge over the apocalypse is showing no sign of…diminishing. In another trend which has set cinema alight, the end of the world is bizarrely, rather a hot ticket to guaranteeing an audience. Yes, we’re all gagging to see our demise played out in Technicolour. Many times.\n\nRead More"
