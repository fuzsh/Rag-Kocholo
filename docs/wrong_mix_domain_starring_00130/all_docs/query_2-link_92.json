        "text": "Summer is just around the corner, bringing with it the promise of more Spider-Man, X-Men, Transformers, explosions and costumed adventurers. In other words, it’s popcorn season.\n\nA steady stream of raunchy comedies such as “Sex Tape” and “Neighbors” will push the limits of their R-ratings to the breaking point in coming months, and a smattering of family flicks such as “Maleficent” and “How to Train Your Dragon 2” promise to stay on the other end of good taste.\n\nSee photos: 47 Summer Movies on Our Radar: From ‘Amazing Spider-Man’ to Tina Fey’s Next Comedy\n\nThere are also a few brave dramas hoping to be heard above the clatter — “Million Dollar Arm” and “The Fault in Our Stars” among them.\n\nSo fire up the grill and get in a hot weather frame of mind for 21 essential summer releases you won’t want to miss.\n\nTHE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2\n\nCast: Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx, Dane DeHaan, Paul Giamatti, Sally Field\n\nDirector: Marc Webb\n\nRelease Date: May 2\n\nDanger: Given the number of comic book adaptations coming down the line, what will differentiate this second installment of a series that didn’t necessarily require rebooting? The first film was well-liked, if not a gigantic smash, and Sony is betting big on their web-slinger properties.\n\nWhy We’re Still Psyched: The chemistry between Garfield (Peter Parker/Spider-Man) and Emma Stone (Gwen Stacy) is very real — they are dating in real life, and it shows. And this is director Marc Webb’s second big-budget outing, meaning that he has a better command of the machine required to make these films swing.\n\nSee video: ‘Amazing Spider-Man 2’: Peter Parker Puns and Punches, Gwen Stacy Reveals His Secret Identity\n\nNEIGHBORS\n\nCast: Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne, Dave Franco, Zac Efron\n\nDirector: Nicholas Stoller\n\nRelease Date: May 9\n\nDanger: Frat parties were overrated in college. Stale beer, lines at the bathroom and all those fraternity brothers with a Jurassic appreciation for gender relations. Will binge drinking and borderline misogyny be better on the big screen?\n\nWhy We’re Still Psyched: Rogen and Efron may look like before and after advertisements for fad diets, but these guys were made to share the screen together. As a young father desperate to control the hard-partying fraternity next door, Rogen has his funniest role since “Pineapple Express” and Efron’s never put those washboard abs to better use than he does as the poster child for higher education excess. It looks to be the R-rated smash of the summer.\n\nTAMMY\n\nCast: Melissa McCarthy, Susan Sarandon, Toni Collette, Kathy Bates, Dan Aykroyd\n\nDirector: Ben Falcone\n\nRelease Date: July 2\n\nDanger: The film was written by McCarthy and Falcone with the latter also handling directing chores. Falcone happens to be McCarthy’s husband. Will this be a vanity project run amuck?\n\nWhy We’re Still Psyched: Their comedy chops are real, both having honed their penchant for pratfalls as members of The Groundlings, and McCarthy’s star has never been higher. From “Identity Thief” to “The Heat,” everything she touches turns to gold…and laughs.\n\nSee video: Melissa McCarthy Pulls a Shia LaBeouf in First ‘Tammy’ Trailer\n\nSee photos: 47 Summer Movies on Our Radar: From ‘Amazing Spider-Man’ to Tina Fey’s Next Comedy\n\nDAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES\n\nCast: Andy Serkis, Gary Oldman, Keri Russell, Jason Clarke\n\nDirector: Matt Reeves\n\nRelease Date: July 11\n\nDanger: With only a teaser trailer so far, Fox is keeping the sequel to summer 2011’s sleeper hit surprisingly under wraps. And recently-released set images of actors in mo-cap suits — instead of sporting CG ape skins — telegraphs that the film is most likely racing to get its effects done.\n\nWhy We’re Still Psyched: “Rise of the Planet of the Apes” was the rare franchise reboot that delivered more than just a cash-grab on brand recognition. Its surprising amount of heart and character-centric action was a hit with critics and audiences, which should bode well for the sequel as it pits Caesar’s growing ape army against a faction of humans struggling to live in a world where homo sapiens are an endangered species. Gary Oldman and “Zero Dark Thirty’s” Clarke bring some much-needed star power to “Cloverfield” director Matt Reeves’ first summer blockbuster.\n\nSee video: ‘Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ New Trailer Outlines Powerful Primates Major Advantage Over Humans\n\nSee photos: 47 Summer Movies on Our Radar: From ‘Amazing Spider-Man’ to Tina Fey’s Next Comedy\n\nJUPITER ASCENDING\n\nCast: Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, Eddie Redmayne\n\nDirector: Lana Wachowski, Andy Wachowski\n\nRelease Date: July 18\n\nDanger: The film is about a toilet-cleaning immigrant who finds out she is destined to rule the universe. Plus, Channing Tatum wears Vulcan ears. Is a trip to the Razzies in the cast’s future?\n\nWhy We’re Still Psyched: Come on, it’s directed by the siblings behind “The Matrix.” They know science-fiction. Admit it, if someone had tried to describe Neo’s adventures in a sentence, they’d be laughed off the stage, too.\n\nSee videos: Channing Tatum, Mila Kunis Reclaim Earth in New ‘Jupiter Ascending’ Trailer\n\nSee photos: 47 Summer Movies on Our Radar: From ‘Amazing Spider-Man’ to Tina Fey’s Next Comedy\n\nSEX TAPE\n\nCast: Cameron Diaz, Jason Segal, Rob Corddry, Ellie Kemper, Rob Lowe\n\nDirector: Jake Kasdan\n\nRelease Date: July 25\n\nDanger: The last time Segal, Diaz and Kasdan teamed up, they made “Bad Teacher,” which made a lot of money but earned lackluster reviews.\n\nWhy We’re Still Psyched: It’s a top-shelf cast from top to bottom, and director Jake Kasdan has a great track record, including “Freaks and Geeks” and now, “New Girl.” Hard to go wrong with this much talent, and it’ll be a nice break from all the explosions and superheroes this summer.\n\nSee video: Cameron Diaz, Jason Segel Get Busy in First ‘Sex Tape’ Red-Band Trailer\n\nSee photos: 47 Summer Movies on Our Radar: From ‘Amazing Spider-Man’ to Tina Fey’s Next Comedy\n\nGUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY\n\nCast: Chris Pratt, Vin Diesel, Glenn Close, Benicio Del Toro\n\nDirector: James Gunn\n\nRelease Date: Aug. 1\n\nDanger: These Marvel characters lack the brand name recognition of a Thor or Iron Man. There could be a reason they’re on the B-list.\n\nWhy We’re Still Psyched: The first preview for the story of interstellar vigilantes was witty, exciting and instantly went viral. It’s tongue-in-cheek tone and the performance of Pratt as a glib deep space policeman earned comparisons to “Raiders of the Lost Ark.” That’s rarefied company.\n\nSee video: ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’ Trailer Finally Drops on ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live’\n\nSee photos: 47 Summer Movies on Our Radar: From ‘Amazing Spider-Man’ to Tina Fey’s Next Comedy\n\nLUCY\n\nCast: Scarlett Johansson, Morgan Freeman\n\nDirector: Luc Besson\n\nRelease Date: Aug. 8\n\nDanger Signs: The film’s premise — a young woman is forced to become a drug mule — doesn’t exactly scream popcorn flick.\n\nWhy We’re Still Psyched: Johansson’s metamorphosis into a pistol-packing, revenge-obsessed warrior calls to mind Liam Neeson in “Taken,” which isn’t a surprise given that Besson directed that action hit. This one has all the markings of a similar under-the-radar smash.\n\nSee video: Scarlett Johansson Accidentally Accesses 100 Percent of Her Brain Power in First ‘Lucy’ Trailer\n\nSee photos: 47 Summer Movies on Our Radar: From ‘Amazing Spider-Man’ to Tina Fey’s Next Comedy\n\nTHE EXPENDABLES 3\n\nCast: Sylvester Stallone, Harrison Ford, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Statham, Wesley Snipes, Mel Gibson, Antonio Banderas, and any actor over the age of 50 who ever carried a gun on film.\n\nDanger: Like its cast, “The Expendables” franchise may be getting a bit long in the tooth.\n\nWhy We’re Still Psyched: The additions of Ford, Snipes, Gibson and Banderas give this film much needed ammo. When it comes to providing bang for the buck, nobody does it better than these guys.\n\nSee video: Sylvester Stallone Has a Small Army of Action Heroes in ‘Expendables 3’ Teaser\n\nSee photos: ‘Expendables 3’ Newcomers Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson, Wesley Snipes Show Off Their Guns\n\nSIN CITY: A DAME TO KILL FOR\n\nCast: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, Josh Brolin, Lady Gaga, Rosario Dawson\n\nDirector: Robert Rodriguez\n\nRelease Date: Aug. 22\n\nDanger: Fanboys love Rodriguez and his bloody, pulpy homages, but what plays like gangbusters in Comic-Con’s Hall H can land with a thud in the real world.\n\nWhy We’re Still Psyched: Even its detractors would be forced to admit that the first “Sin City” was some kind of crazy and beautiful experiment. A picture that strove and often succeeded at distilling the essence of a graphic novel on the silver screen. At the very least it will be gorgeous to look at.\n\nSee video: ‘Sin City: A Dame to Kill For’ Trailer: Josh Brolin, Joseph Gordon-Levitt Face a Beating in Frank Miller’s Deranged Town"
