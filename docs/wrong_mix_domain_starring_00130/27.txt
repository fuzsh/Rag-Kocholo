Gareth Edwards' reboot of the 1954 Japanese monster movie, which also stars Elizabeth Olsen, landed in the top spot, after making around 10.7 million US dollars (£6.4 million) on its opening weekend, reported Screen Daily.

It beat his previous offering Monsters, which had a run of 1.6 million US dollars (£950,000) and Roland Emmerich's take on the character, which managed seven million US dollars (£4.2 million) when it debuted in 1998.

Godzilla, which is to spawn a sequel, is also top of the US and Canada box office.

Risque comedy Bad Neighbours, which stars Seth Rogen and Zac Efron, took second place as it crossed over the £10 million mark over the weekend.

Superhero sequel The Amazing Spider-Man 2 swung into the third spot, followed by romantic comedy The Other Woman and Hossein Amini's directorial debut, The Two Faces Of January to round out the top five films.
