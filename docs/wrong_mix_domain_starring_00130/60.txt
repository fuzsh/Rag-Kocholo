An all-star cast of Mark Ruffalo, Julia Roberts, Matt Bomer and Jim Parsons team up with acclaimed director Ryan Murphey to bring us HBO’s TV film The Normal Heart. The two hour film is poignant, compelling, heart breaking and important. I say important because as wonderfully crafted the production is, it is also an extremely enlightening telling of the history of the gay community in the United States. Continue reading →

The past teams up with the future in the newest entry into the mutant franchise. Combining both the cast from the original trilogy and the newcomers from First Class, the movie takes on one of the most iconic story arcs from the comics. The movie pulls together the best parts from both the original movies and X-Men: First Class to produce not only one of the best X-Men movies of the franchise but one of the best superhero movies of the year.

Aside from knowing that Godzilla is a giant lizard I didn’t know much about ‘The King Of All Monsters’. Because of that I was excited to see the latest iteration of the story. This Godzilla shoots to up the ante after a generally panned version in 1998. Directed by Gareth Edwards and starring Bryan Cranston, Aaron Tyler-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen the movie exceeds in doing so for the most part, but is that really saying much? For die-hard Godzilla fans (of which there were many in our theater – there were several rounds of applause throughout and during the ending credits), there are some surprises in which you will appreciate. For those unfamiliar, like myself, you may leave slightly confused. Continue reading →

With The Amazing Spider-Man 2 serving as the “official” kick-off to Summer blockbusters we are now in high-traffic zone for your local theaters. The first comedy to test the waters is the Zac Efron and Seth Rogen flick Neighbors. The previews showcase a lot of LOL moments and the film definitely delivers – I was chuckling the whole way through. That being said, I couldn’t help but think as I was walking out of the theater “I’m glad I didn’t have to pay for these tickets”. The film, while funny, suffers from key mistakes keeping it from achieving the status of previous hits such as This Is The End or Knocked Up.

The Amazing Spider-Man 2 ups the stakes, story and action significantly from the first film but stumbles at many points under the weight of too many characters and storylines. *SPOILERS WITHIN*

When you’re seeing a movie like The Other Woman you have to manage your expectations. The trailers give you just about what you get – a silly, LOL-worthy chick flick. If you come out of the movie saying you were disappointed in the plot, well then you probably weren’t paying attention to the previews. All that aside, The Other Woman promises a hilarious female-powered comedy to rival blockbusters like Bridesmaids and The Heat. For the most part it delivers (although not nearly as successfully as the previous hits), managing to stumble along the way. (WARNING: SPOILERS) Continue reading →

Marvel’s newest entry into their cinematic universe is also one of their best! Captain America: The Winter Soldier takes the first movie and builds on it ten-fold to create an action packed thrill ride with intriguing thoughts on privacy, surveillance and freedom.

“Beware the winds of revenge,” takes on an entire new meaning with 300: Rise of an Empire. The film itself takes place after the events of the first movie, which originally centered around the character King Leonidas, now focuses on a new Greek general named Themistocles, played by Sullivan Stapleton (Strike Back on Cinemax).

Let me tell you – The Wolf of Wall Street was a lot to take in. There’s so much over-the-top mess happening in this movie – everything from the money, drugs, alcohol and sex was dripping in excess. Now, I’m not saying I didn’t enjoy the movie because I definitely did. It’s just – A LOT. Continue reading →

The Oscar nominated Her is set in the Los Angeles in the slight future, I’m guessing not to far ahead since the movie is feasible in the way technology grows by leaps and bounds every other day. Her follows Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), a complex, soulful man who makes his living writing touching, personal letters for other people. (And gets a book deal out of it) Heartbroken after the end of a long relationship, he becomes intrigued with a new, advanced operating system, which promises to be an intuitive entity in its own right, individual to each user.
