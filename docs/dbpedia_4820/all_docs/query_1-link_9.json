At the time I knew Dave Staniforth’s brother and he arranged complimentaries to pick up at the ground. When I asked at the entrance a bloke with a beard came out and handed me the tickets so I said thanks Dave. “I’m Graham” he said and I realized it was Graham Day.

Even in the days when I was fanatical, I don't think I ever planned a trip that far north.\n\nI'm fairly sure early in the 2003-2004 season I went away to Carlisle on a supporters club coach. Madness. I was definitely at the game, if not by train. I can't fy those sorts of distances for ninety minutes of football.\n\nPost by Mrs V Smegma on\n\nOnly ever been there once - 2 seasons ago. We lost 1-0 but played really well but just didn't take our chances and were not direct enough in final third. Would have been stopped at half time in our favour if a boxing match. They scored from the only chance they had.\n\nCumbria is a lovely part of the UK. No doubt some of our fans will sing the moronic “s**thole” song\n\nPost by Delsy on\n\nupload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/63/Carl_Badge.png/160px-Carl_Badge.png V upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/47/Bristol_Rovers_F.C._logo.svg/200px-Bristol_Rovers_F.C._logo.svg.png\n\nWe have played Carlisle United 38 times, W15, D9, L14, Biggest win 5-2, loss 4-0 and all 9 draws have been 0-0 or 1-1...\n\nCarlisle were founded in 1896 as Shaddongate United, are known as the Cumbrians & play at Brunton Park, which holds 17,949..\n\nManager Paul Simpson is 57 and played most of his football for Man.City, Oxford, Derby, Wolves, Blackpool, Rochdale & Carlisle, also England U18 & U21.\n\nPaul has managed Rochdale, PNE, Shrewsbury, Stockport, England U20 and Carlisle in two spells...\n\nIn 2012, market research company FFC surveyed fans of every Football League club across the country to find who they consider their main rivals to be.\n\nCarlisle United fans were unusually shown to consider the more distant Preston North End, Hartlepool United and Middlesbrough as their main rivals.\n\nThis is most likely explained by the fact that the survey did not include the option of choosing non-league clubs.\n\nNotable managers have been George Bistow, Fred Emery, Alan Ashman, Bob Stokoe, Mick Wadsworth, Mervyn Day, Greg Abbott, Keith Curle and PAUL SIMPSON...\n\nCarlisle United did get to the 1st division in the 1974-75 season, this remains their only time in the top tier..\n\nCarlisle's record goalscorer is Jimmy McConnell with 126 goals and record appearances is Alan Ross with 466..\n\nCarlisle lie in 21st place, BRFC are 12th in the table, this will be a tough challenge to come away with any points..\n\nAlways liked Paul Simpson, comes across as a very grounded and honest football man, I suppose geographically one of their closest rivals would be Queen of the South, the Dumfries team but unlike Berwick Carlisle have been lucky enough to play in the ‘proper’ league 😜\n\nPost by JeffNZ on\n\nHave a good mate who's a die hard Carlisle fan. (He flew back to the UK from NZ to go to the play off final last season). He tells me they have a depleted team due to injuries and poor recruitment and couldn't score in a brothel right now. He's predicting 2-0 to us.\n\nHe also tells me the 'good news' for Carlise is an American consortium (Wrexham Part II) are taking over at the end of the month and have promised a step change in transfer funding for the January window.\n\nSounds like now is a good time to be playing them and as long as we go up a couple of gears from Tuesday night we should win this one.\n\nCOYB!\n\nPost by trymer on\n\nMy best memory of Carlisle is from the 1976/77 season when Rovers won 3-2 in Division 2 ( Championship) match.

What a plonker I was.\n\nThat season Rovers were unbeaten in the last seven games and finished 15th with the top three promoted teams being Wolves, Chelsea and Nottingham Forest.\n\nI was at that match too Swiss,it was an important game because both clubs needed points to avoid relegation.\n\nRovers were losing until the last 10 minutes and then scored 3 goals ? anyway the result virtually doomed Carlisle to relegation they need to win their last game at Cardiff (they drew) and some of their supporters were unhappy after the match.\n\nAlthough Rovers finished 15th with 37 points some of the relegated clubs had 34 points so it was close.\n\nPost by o2o2bo2ba on\n\nLong way for nothing?\n\nThe journey back is sweet?\n\nIn between?\n\nFair play, many of us have made the trawl up there where the welcome is warm.\n\nI remember going up there a few months after those awful floods....the poor souls tied ribbons half way up trees. That was the waterline!\n\nWe have a great opportunity to advance today as their off form and personnel down..\n\nGet the first goal and we can settle.\n\nScore whilst on top the key as always.\n\nGas 2-1.\n\nMaybe Jervani can show something??\n\nEnjoy your game your way and safe travels everyone.

I think it was a very important England game.\n\nCould have been the one where Beckham scored the late free-kick to equalise and send England to a Finals tournament?\n\nAnyway, there was something like 252 Rovers fans who travelled north, which is a decent figure at any time and amazing in the circumstances."
