        "text": "Chelsea vs. Leeds United : 28 February 2024.\n\nAfter the defeat at Wembley on Sunday, we reconvened down at “The Eight Bells” in deepest Fulham – via a pint at “The Sawyers Arms” at Paddington – and although our spirits were low, a decent evening ensued. We spent three hours or so in the company of Johnny Twelve from California and also Rob and Karl from Hersham. Suffice to say, the drinks flowed and the smiles returned. However, on waking in the Premier Inn opposite the pub the next morning, I could not stifle a brief “I hate football” from flitting into my head.\n\nBut these were a busy few days for Chelsea Football Club.\n\nNext up was our first FA Cup tie against Leeds United since the 1970 FA Cup Final and subsequent replay. It was a busy time for me too. As Monday passed and as I toiled over the Wembley blog late into Tuesday, I managed to “let go” of the result on Sunday and I tried my best to look forward to the game on Wednesday.\n\nI was in early at work on the day of the game, but I could not get something out of my head. Back in 1986, Chelsea exited both domestic cups within the space of four days; we lost at home to Liverpool in the FA Cup on Sunday 26 January and at home to QPR on Wednesday 29 January. I sincerely hoped that there would be no repeat thirty-eight years later.\n\nPD and Parky had enjoyed a pub lunch and PD had then picked-up Ron Harris at 1.45pm. At just after 2pm, in the car park of “The Milk Churn” pub in Melksham, I stood with Ron as PD took a photo of the two of us. It seemed right that on the occasion of the first Chelsea vs. Leeds United FA Cup game in fifty-four years, we should mark the start of the drive to Chelsea in this manner.\n\nAs I pulled out of the car park, I realised once again how absolutely lucky I am to be able to drive our captain from those glory years up to Stamford Bridge.\n\n1970, eh?\n\nWhile Ron was busy leading the team to those two classic games, I was just starting out on a football life of my own.\n\nI began my school days at the age of for years and nine months, probably just before the Wembley Cup Final on Saturday 11 April. In the ensuing few months, I would choose Chelsea as my team, although the exact reason or reasons are not crystal clear. In my memory, it’s down to a list of a few motives. It has to be said that until school, my parents told me that I wasn’t particularly interested in football.\n\nMaybe I liked the name “Chelsea”. Maybe, after the replay at Old Trafford on 29 April, some school pals told me that “Chelsea had won the cup” (there is no recollection at all of me watching it, sadly) or maybe I had worked out that Chelsea were a good team. In a nutshell, Chelsea were the talk of the town, or at least the school playground, in the April and May of 1970 and I became a fan.\n\nI’ve had quite a journey, eh?\n\nAnd here I was, aged fifty-eight and seven months, driving the captain of that team to a game against Leeds United so many years later.\n\nAs I approached London, I could not resist asking Ron a question.\n\n“Ron. Of the two games at Wembley and Old Trafford in 1970, what is your one stand out memory?”\n\n“After the first game, Dave Sexton told me that I would swap positions with Webby, who had been given the biggest run-around I had ever seen by Eddie Gray, and in the second-game he never got a kick.”\n\nThe response did not surprise me at all. It is the classic moment from both games aside from the goals.\n\nThe 1970 FA Cup Final is so iconic, so fantastic, and so important to the history of the competition and to Chelsea Football Club alike. But it is, undoubtedly, so important for me too, although I did not even watch the games at the time.\n\nIt was a game-changer.\n\nI knew that Chelsea were issuing a programme for the game that would feature a cover photograph of the jubilant Chelsea players at Old Trafford, with Chopper holding the trophy alongside a few team mates, and I liked that. Sometimes Chelsea get it right.\n\nAs time moves on, though, it has been sad to see so many players from both teams pass away over the years. Of the twenty-two starters at Old Trafford, only ten remain.\n\nChelsea.\n\nPeter Bonetti : 20 April 2020, aged 78.\n\nRon Harris – aged 79\n\nEddie McCreadie – aged 83.\n\nJohn Hollins : 14 June 2023, aged 76.\n\nJohn Dempsey – aged 77.\n\nDavid Webb – aged 77.\n\nTommy Baldwin : 22 January 2024, aged 78.\n\nCharlie Cooke – aged 81.\n\nPeter Osgood : 1 March 2006, aged 59.\n\nIan Hutchinson : 19 September 2002, aged 54.\n\nPeter Houseman : 20 March 1977, aged 31.\n\nLeeds United.\n\nDavid Harvey – aged 76.\n\nPaul Madeley : 23 July 2018, aged 73.\n\nTerry Cooper : 31 July 2021, aged 77.\n\nBilly Bremner : 7 December 1997, aged 54.\n\nJack Charlton : 10 July 2020, aged 85.\n\nNorman Hunter : 20 April 2020, aged 76.\n\nPeter Lorimer : 20 March 2021, aged 74.\n\nAlan Clarke – aged 77.\n\nMick Jones – aged 78.\n\nJohnny Giles – aged 83.\n\nEddie Gray – aged 76.\n\nI dropped off PD and Parky at the bottom of the North End Road and I dropped off Ron outside the main gates. As I slowly retraced my steps back to my usual parking place, police sirens were wailing.\n\nLeeds were in town.\n\nAt about 5.15pm, I popped into an Italian restaurant on the Lillee Road – “Pizza@Home” – for the first time and I enjoyed some lovely food. I then dipped into “Café Ole” at the bottom of the North End Road once more for a large cappuccino. It was all about staying out of the rain for as long as I could. Funnily enough, there was a bundle of friends at “Café Ole” – Pete, Liz, Mark, Scott, Paul, Gerry, Tom, Leigh, Darren – probably all with the same need to keep dry.\n\nI had a nice talk with Tom, the first one for ages.\n\nI was inside Stamford Bridge at about 7pm. PD told me that, should we beat Leeds, we would play host to Leicester City in the Quarter-Finals.\n\nMixed blessings.\n\nI was angling for a dream draw of Newcastle United at home on Saturday 16 March as it would mark the fiftieth anniversary of my very first game against the same opposition. But I was relatively happy with a home draw. I hoped that the game would be played on the Saturday though. Outside of a home draw, we all wanted Coventry City. Ah well, it was not to be.\n\nPD ran through the team.\n\n“We’re playing with three wingers. Sterling, Madueke, Mudryk.”\n\nI had swapped out with Parky to allow him a seat next to PD in The Sleepy Hollow. There were around six-thousand noisy Leeds fans in The Shed, their largest away following at Stamford Bridge in over fifty-years, maybe ever.\n\nAt about 7.15pm, Ron Harris was interviewed pitch side with club historian Rick Glanvil as they spoke about the 1970 FA Cup Final and its place in football folklore. Amazingly, the replay was watched by 28.49 million people. It is at number six in the list of the highest-ever TV audiences in the UK, alongside royal weddings, royal funerals and England games. Apart from the “Matthews Final” of 1953, it is probably the most famous FA Cup Final of them all.\n\nThe usual dimming of lights and fireworks, but then the shock of Leeds in an all pink kit, albeit one with a shirt that resembled a polyester outfit from the ‘seventies that Mrs. Slocombe might wear at a Grace Brothers night out.\n\nHideous.\n\nTime to sort the team out. I had a look.\n\nSanchez\n\nGusto – Disasi – Chalobah – Gilchrist\n\nCaicedo – Enzo\n\nMadueke – Mudryk – Sterling\n\nJackson\n\nI had forgotten that Ethan Ampadu was now full-time at Leeds United after three relegations on loan to Sheffield United, Venezia and Spezia. Eddie Gray’s great-nephew Archie was playing for the visitors. He is the son of Andy Gray, who I remember at Leeds, and the grandson of Frank Gray who I also remember at Leeds.\n\nConclusion : I am getting old.\n\nThe visitors in The Shed noisily shouted “We are Leeds, we are Leeds, we are Leeds” and Enzo kicked the ball back to a team mate.\n\nWe were off.\n\nThe pink visitors attacked us in the Matthew Harding. Mudryk was in the “Number 10” slot, the space recently occupied by Cole Palmer. We began on top.\n\nI noted many empty seats during the first few minutes but most filled. There were, however a few hundred unused seats in the top corners of Westview all game.\n\nI was just getting settled, making a mental note of all the songs that the visitors were singing at us, when a lumped ball from deep released Daniel James who had lost the back-tracking Alfie Gilchrist. The Leeds player lobbed the ball just wide of the goal frame.\n\nFrom the goal-kick following this miss, a typical Chelsea disaster of 2023/24 occurred right in front of me. Sanchez played the ball to Axel Disasi who he chose not to clear his lines, no doubt under instruction from the management. He played the ball into the feet of Moises Caicedo, even though there were three opponents close by. Possession was lost, Jaidon Anthony pushed the ball square to Mateo Joseph who slammed the ball past Robert Sanchez.\n\nThe away hordes roared.\n\nAfter just eight minutes we were one-nil down.\n\nThe away end went through a few favourites.\n\n“Should I be Chelsea, should I be Leeds, here’s what she said to me.”\n\n“Let’s go fucking mental, let’s go fucking mental.”\n\n“Marching on together.”\n\nWe tried to retaliate immediately, with Sterling setting up Enzo but his low effort flew past Ilian Meslier’s post.\n\nOn fifteen minutes, we constructed a really fine move down the right, with a smattering of one-touch passes. Jackson back to Disasi, to Gusto, inside to Jackson, to Madueke, to Caicedo and a killer pass to Jackson, who carefully guided the ball home.\n\nLovely goal.\n\nIt was back to 1-1.\n\nAnother shot from Enzo, but easily stopped by Meslier.\n\n“Come on Chelsea, Come on Chelsea. Come on Chelsea. Come on Chelsea.”\n\nA slashed effort from an angle by Madueke that only hit the side-netting. Another shot from Madueke was so high and wide that it almost defied description. Mudryk went close at an angle. At a corner, Mudryk took Shedloads of abuse from the Leeds fans.\n\n“You’re fookin’ shit, you’re fookin’ shit, you’re fookin’ shit.”\n\nLeeds countered occasionally. For some reason, their right-winger James (he scored against us in his first game for Manchester United in August 2019) reminded me of Eddie Gray, his build and his running style.\n\nOn thirty-seven minutes, another fine move down our right. The ball was worked centrally at first, Caicedo to Chalobah to Madueke. As so often happens, he chose to dribble laterally, but in doing so encountered some space. He pushed the ball between defenders to Gusto on the right. A touch, a prod into Sterling, and a cutback to Mudryk, and a first-time finish, sweeping it low past the ‘keeper. Another great goal.\n\nHe stood in front of his detractors.\n\n“Ви казали?”\n\nWe were 2-1 up.\n\nThe visitors were not impressed.\n\n“2-1 and you still don’t sing.”\n\nLeeds came again and James fired over from a free-kick. Jaidon Anthony ghosted in from the left and thumped one that just missed the far post.\n\n“We all hate Leeds and Leeds and Leeds…”\n\nAt the break, it was time to reflect on the first-half. We had scored two nice goals, but some of our build-up play was just too slow. Moises Caicedo was the best of our bunch, strong in the tackle, decent passing, holding it all together. We had done just enough.\n\nAlas, in the second-half, we didn’t do much at all.\n\nLeeds began the stronger and after a while it dawned on me that we had hardly strung more than two passes together. On fifty-eight minutes, with the Chelsea crowd not involved and docile, Ampadu swung a long cross over to Anthony. I was dismayed that Gusto did not make a stab at the ball, allowing a long cross towards the far post where Joseph was able to leap, totally unmarked, and head down and in.\n\nIt was now 2-2.\n\nOn sixty-one minutes, a double substitution.\n\nConor Gallagher for Madueke.\n\nBen Chilwell for Gusto.\n\nChilwell to left-back, Gilchrist to right-back, Gallagher to the middle, Mudryk to the left, Sterling to the right.\n\nOur play went to pieces.\n\n“We’re second-best here.”\n\nA shot from Anthony was deflected but its trajectory stayed close to Sanchez.\n\nOur passing was off, our intensity had slowed, we had stopped doing the small things. We looked so tired.\n\nMudryk crossed high but Jackson was always underneath it.\n\nOn seventy-four minutes, more changes.\n\nLevi Colwill for Gilchrist.\n\nCole Palmer for Sterling.\n\nDisasi to right-back, Colwill in the middle, Palmer on the left.\n\nWe still struggled. We all began to wonder about extra-time and penalties, another late night.\n\nOn the ninetieth minute, there was really fine play from Enzo who fought to retain possession on the left and he scurried forward. He spotted the run of Gallagher and slotted a beautiful pass into him. Gallagher’s touch was exquisite and despite being squeezed by two Leeds defenders, he lifted the ball over Meslier.\n\nGet in you beauty.\n\nNow it was our turn to scream and shout.\n\nStamford Bridge roared, but how I wished that it had been roaring all night.\n\nIn injury-time, a debut was given to Jimi Tauriainen, whose first moment of action was to foul a Leeds defender; obviously he had read the script.\n\nChelsea 3 Leeds United 2.\n\nAt the end, “Freed From Desire “ and “One Step Beyond”\n\nWe can’t really grumble about getting home draws all of the way through the two domestic cups this season can we? Eight out of eight.\n\nWimbledon.\n\nBrighton.\n\nBlackburn Rovers.\n\nNewcastle United.\n\nPreston North End.\n\nAston Villa.\n\nLeeds United.\n\nLeicester City.\n\nDuring the day, I had joked to a few people about the game against Leeds.\n\n“Yeah, looking forward to it. But what’s the end goal? Get to another Cup Final at Wembley and lose that one too?”\n\nI don’t know whether to laugh or cry.\n\nOutside, mobs of Leeds made their way back to waiting cars and coaches. I had not seen so many police at Chelsea in years.\n\nOn the walk back to the car, Ron Harris explained that Eddie Gray was with the Leeds board at Stamford Bridge and had asked to be linked up with his old adversary from 1970. The two former players spent thirty minutes in each other’s company. In fact, Eddie Gray did the exact same thing on his last visit to Chelsea last season. I admired that. These old warriors must love to meet up and share stories of that game and others.\n\n“How old is Eddie Gray, Ron? Same age as you?”\n\n“Couple years younger, I think.”\n\n“Right.”\n\nWe walked on.\n\n“Oh yeah, I remember now. When he played against you in 1970 he was younger. But after the replay, I heard that he aged significantly.”\n\nRon smiled.\n\nI soon escaped from London and for the first time that I can remember I didn’t stop once until I pulled up at “The Milk Churn” at about midnight. I was home by 12.40am, a relatively early night.\n\nRight then, back to the league now. Brentford on Saturday. See you there.\n\nCrystal Palace vs. Chelsea : 12 February 2024.\n\nAs we travelled up to South London for the away game at Selhurst Park against Crystal Palace, we wondered if the performance of the season at Villa Park would turn out to be a solid stepping stone for the rest of the campaign. Or just a mad “one-off”.\n\nSelhurst Park is a real ball-ache to reach. Driving up from the West of England, we are at the hands of the Sat Nav Gods. It’s basically a case of “top, middle or bottom.”\n\nTop – up the M4 as far as the familiar turn off down the North End Road, past The Goose, then down to Wandsworth Bridge and then south-east in a straight line to Crystal Palace Football Club.\n\nMiddle – up the M3, around the M25, along the A3, almost as far as Kingston-upon-Thames, then through the B-roads of South-West London, nudging due east to Selhurst Park.\n\nBottom – up the M3 and then all of the way around the M25 to “six o’clock” before a dead straight route north up the A23 to the stadium.\n\nOn this particular afternoon, at just after 2pm in Melksham, the GPS went for the middle option. It suggested a journey of three hours. In reality, hit by traffic at a few key places, it became four hours. I had sorted out some parking at a private house just off Holmesdale Road, which runs north-south behind the home stand at Selhurst Park, and over the last few miles we tried to spot a pub to base ourselves for an hour. We had almost given up on finding anywhere, but I happened to spot a pub – “Pawson Arms” – a short drive from my parking space. There was even a free parking space right outside the pub.\n\nPerfect.\n\nIt was a home pub – full of Palace fans, full of Palace photos and memorabilia on the walls – but we sidled in and stood next to the bar. It was busy but not ridiculously so. It was nigh-on perfect, as away pubs go. Andy – a friend of a friend – arrived at about 6.45pm and I passed over a spare ticket. A few minutes later, we hopped in the car and I drove to my JustPark location, just a few yards off Holmesdale Road. The Selhurst Park floodlights were easily visible. We began the march up the hill to the ground.\n\n“Don’t remember it being this bloody steep last time.”\n\nIt took me a long time to visit Selhurst Park for the first time. My first visit was in August 1989 and a game against the then tenants Charlton Athletic, a match we lost 0-3. I watched from the middle of the Holmesdale Road terrace. My first game against Crystal Palace was in October 1991, a dull 0-0 draw, and the Chelsea support for that game was in a horrible corner section of the Arthur Wait Stand at the Holmesdale Road end. I include a few grainy photos.\n\nWe turned left at the top and began the slow walk down to the away turnstiles. I heard a young American lad, bedecked in a Palace scarf, ask where the fanzone was. I felt like saying to him “bollocks to the fanzone mate, get yourself down the “Pawson Arms” for an authentic pre-match experience”.\n\nThree spares were handed over to other lads and at about 7.40pm, we made our way in.\n\nI was down the front – row five – with Parky, John and Gary. Our usual match day companion Alan was convalescing after a health scare a few miles away in Anerley. We hope and pray that he can re-join us for a Chelsea game soon. Selhurst Park doesn’t change too much does it? However, for the first time I spotted a press box, illuminated, in the rear reaches of the old sand opposite, beneath the corrugated roof. This was my first evening game at Selhurst for ages and ages. I remember a FA Cup replay against Wimbledon in 1995, but nothing since.\n\nMore bloody flames. More bloody fireworks. Oh dear oh dear.\n\nWhile the Holmesdale Ultras displayed a variety of stark messages for the club’s board to ignore and the general public to perhaps spot on the TV feed, the Chelsea away support was rocking.\n\nOur team? Thiago Silva came in for the injured Benoit Badiashile. Raheem Sterling was again not chosen to start.\n\nPetrovic\n\nGusto – Disasi – Silva – Chilwell\n\nCaicedo – Enzo\n\nMadueke – Gallagher– Jackson\n\nPalmer\n\nThe home team were without Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze, their fleet-footed forwards. On the far side, Roy Hodgson looked frail while Ray Lewington lent on a post near the dugout.\n\nFine singing from the away section of the Arthur Wait Stand continued as the game began at 8pm. We dominated early possession. However, as the first-half continued, unfortunately our old habits resurfaced way too easily. We were passing the ball from side to side, but with no incisive passes to hurt the Crystal Palace defence. In fact, it was the home team who dominated the early chances, often breaking through our lines with ease. A shot from Jean-Philippe Mateta was saved by Djordje Petrovic.\n\nIt seems almost sacrilegious to say it, but Thiago Silva continued to slow things down. In his defence, there was little movement in front of him, but it was still so frustrating. It was if he was suffering from the football equivalent of “the yips” or the dart player’s worst nightmare of not being able to release the dart.\n\nElsewhere Cole Palmer was anonymous.\n\nOn the half-hour mark, a Palace player attempted a Paolo Di Canio scissor kick but the ball was not cleared. A calamitous scene ensued. Moises Caicedo and Noni Madueke colluded to get in each other’s way.\n\n“Get rid! Get rid!”\n\nThe ball was picked up by Jefferson Lerma, who dropped his shoulder and curled a magnificent effort wide of Petrovic but not wide of the goal.\n\nCrystal Palace 1 Chelsea 0.\n\n“Glad All Over” rang out.\n\nBollocks.\n\nAs the rest of the dour first-half continued, we became aware that we had not engineered a single effort on the Crystal Palace goal. So, after all, maybe Villa Park was indeed a mad “one-off” and this was the real Chelsea. We tended to attack down the right where there was an awkward alliance between Malo Gusto and Madueke. Their fine performances the previous Wednesday were not able to be repeated. On the left, Ben Chilwell and Nicolas Jackson struggled. The whole team struggled.\n\nOn forty minutes, Moises Caicedo lost possession and an almighty chase took place. Thankfully, a typically well-timed sliding tackle by Silva saved the day.\n\nOn forty-five minutes, a meek shot from Conor Gallagher was scuffed wide of the far post; our first shot of the game. Bloody hell.\n\nAt the break, Mauricio Pochettino replaced Madueke with Christopher Nkunku.\n\nNkunku was stood at the centre-circle, awaiting the restart. But, all of a sudden, several players were seen knocking footballs around between them. What was going on? Was this post-modern football here?\n\n“Don’t bother with the game, nor scoring, just pass the ball to each other. Just enjoy yourself. You will still get paid.”\n\nWe tried to work out why there was a delay. We then realised that the football match was missing a key ingredient; a referee.\n\nWhat could the matter be? Was the referee was stuck in the lavatory? Did nobody know he was there?\n\nIn an odd attempt at humour, the Palace PA played “Three Little Birds” by Bob Marley.\n\n“Don’t worry about a thing ‘cus every little thing is gonna be alright!”\n\nI wondered if this was, or had been, a Palace song. It certainly was a Chelsea song. It first appeared way back in 2010 and I specifically hearing it first during a 5-0 win at Fratton Park.\n\nThe Chelsea fans soon latched onto it.\n\n“Don’t worry about a thing ‘cus every little thing is gonna be alright! CHELSEA!”\n\n“Don’t worry about a thing ‘cus every little thing is gonna be alright! CHELSEA!”\n\n“Don’t worry about a thing ‘cus every little thing is gonna be alright! CHELSEA!”\n\nAfter an age, the ref Michael Oliver appeared. The game restarted.\n\nAnd how.\n\nAfter just two minutes of the second-half, with “Three Little Birds” still bouncing around the Arthur Wait, a fine ball from the hot and cold Caicedo found Gusto on the right. His pull-back to Gallagher was cleanly despatched despite the ball bouncing high as it approached him.\n\nScreams. Shouting. Mayhem. The players raced towards us. I was pushed, lost my footing, and almost lost my glasses. Photos were an impossibility until everything had died down.\n\nCrystal Palace 1 Chelsea 1.\n\nIt seemed as if the momentum had switched. We had witnessed a ridiculous few minutes when a song had rejuvenated the support and – possibly, probably – had sparked life into the team.\n\nI wondered if the Palace DJ would be awarded an assist for the equaliser.\n\nThe support roared on. With Nkunku in the middle, we caught a lot of Palmer as he drifted right. Chelsea dominated the play, with much of the action right in front of us. On a few occasions, I held my camera ready for Gusto or Palmer or Gallagher to break free.\n\nPalmer went close.\n\nAt the other end, Silva heroically blocked a shot from Matheus Franca but stayed down. He was replaced by Levi Colwill.\n\nAn hour had passed.\n\nEfforets from Chilwell and Jackson went close.\n\nAt the other end, a rare Palace break and a fine save by Petrovic from Franca.\n\nOn seventy-eight minutes, Raheem Sterling replaced Jackson.\n\nOn eighty-three minutes, Alfie Gilchrist replaced Gusto.\n\nA chance for Sterling but he needed extra touches and the chance went begging. A Disasi header was parried by the Palace ‘keeper Dean Henderson.\n\nTime was passing.\n\nWe entered injury time.\n\nJohn mentioned that the last two visits to Selhurst Park had resulted in ridiculously late winners; Hakim Ziyech in February 2022 and Conor Gallagher in October 2022.\n\nWell…\n\nOn ninety-one minutes, a fine break. Sterling found himself in space and passed to Palmer. I clicked. The photo shows Gallagher and Enzo racing through in support. Palmer advanced and adeptly slid the ball to Gallagher. The finish was exquisite, a slide-rule pass into the goal. It showed Jimmy Greaves levels of calm.\n\nPandemonium in South London.\n\nFackinell.\n\nThe players raced towards us all again.\n\nFootball – I fucking love you.\n\nCrystal Palace 1 Chelsea 2.\n\nJohn and his late winners.\n\nIt got better.\n\nTwo minutes later, we broke from our own box, the ball steered out to Palmer once more. He raced away, Nkunku occupied the thoughts of a key defender, and the ball was perfectly pushed into Enzo. He steadied himself, took a moment, then clipped the ball high into the net. I snapped that goal but not the ensuing madness in front of us once again.\n\nCrystal Palace 1 Chelsea 3.\n\nGame over.\n\nPhew.\n\nThe away section was on fire by now, and the supporters were a heady mixture of joy and disbelief. We sauntered out, regrouped and walked up and then down the hills of Selhurst to get to our car.\n\nThe getaway was ridiculously quick and the Sat Nav chose the top route to head back. It felt odd driving within half-a-mile of Stamford Bridge on the way home.\n\nIt had been another long day. I returned home at 1.40am.\n\nNext up, yet another away game, the third in a row.\n\nManchester City await.\n\nSee you there.\n\n1991\n\n2010\n\nIn the last few minutes of the game, my ears registered a new song emanating from the rowdy fans to my right. It didn’t take long to work out that it was a few lines from a Bob Marley song. More and more Chelsea joined in as our brains deciphered it. It had been an easy night, so we needn’t get carried away, but the song provided a nice uplift…a positive vibe for once.\n\n“Don’t worry – CLAP CLAP – about a thing…CLAP CLAP CLAP – ‘cus every little thing – CLAP CLAP – is gonna be alright.”\n\n2024\n\nAston Villa vs. Chelsea : 7 February 2024.\n\nWe weren’t expecting much from this FA Cup replay at Villa Park. Why would we be? In our previous two games we had conceded eight goals. There was, in fact, a real worry that we would become unstuck on a mighty scale.\n\nI had worked an early shift, collected Paul and PD at 2.20pm, and then headed north. We stopped off at “The Vine” at West Bromwich at about 4.30pm. Our modus operandi was that if we were travelling over one hundred miles to watch a football game that we would probably lose, we had best find our fun elsewhere. The three curries, as always, went down a treat.\n\nAt around 6.45pm, I dropped the lads off as close to Villa Park that I could get and then double-backed on myself to park up. The plan was to walk all of the way around the stadium to take a selection of wide-angled photographs of the stands and to try to capture the essence of a midweek cup tie.\n\nVilla Park, eh?\n\nThis is a ground that became synonymous with FA Cup semi-finals before the FA took the unfortunate step to host all semis at the new Wembley Stadium. We have played a few semis at Villa Park over the years dating back to our first one, a win, against Everton in 1915. There was then a long gap of fifty years followed by three games in quick succession. We then lost to Liverpool in 1965 and Sheffield Wednesday in 1966 before defeating Leeds United in 1967.\n\nHowever, my first viewing of an FA Cup tie at Villa Park took place in early 1987. I travelled down to Birmingham with two mates from college in Stoke; Bob, Leeds United, and Steve, Derby County. I remember we posed for a photo outside the famous steps of the Trinity Road but the weather was too overcast and my camera was too cheap for the photo to be worth sharing. I had visited Villa Park for a tedious 0-0 draw in November 1986, but this cup tie was a great match. We had about 5,000 fans in a 21,997 crowd on the low terrace behind the goal and in the seats of the old Witton Lane Stand. We watched from the seats. We went 1-0 up in the first-half via John Bumstead but Villa equalised with twenty minutes to go via Neale Cooper. David Speedie then put us ahead on eighty-six minutes only for Steve Hunt to equalise again. We would win the replay at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThat game in 1987 was our last FA Cup tie against Villa on their home patch. However, we would play two semi-finals at Villa Park within six years during the Glenn Hoddle to Claudio Ranieri era.\n\nIn 1996, we assembled at Villa Park for the game against Manchester United. We were allocated the old Trinity Road Stand and three-quarters of the Holte End. Luckily, we had seats in the very front row of the upper tier of the Holte End, and I decided to take advantage of this position by creating a flag in honour of Ruud Gullit that I could drape over the balcony. Although the great man himself headed us into the lead in the first-half, United came back to win 2-1 with two goals in quick succession a quarter of an hour into the second-half via Andy Cole and David Beckham.\n\nIn 2002, our semi-final against Fulham was to be played at Highbury but our opponents took umbrage that the split of the 38,000 tickets at Arsenal’s stadium slightly favoured ourselves. They demanded that the game should be played at a stadium that allowed more equal allocations. Lo and behold, the two clubs from West London were forced to decamp to Birmingham on a Sunday evening with the game kicking-off at a ridiculous 7pm. I travelled up with a car load from Frome and we enjoyed a lengthy pre-match in the “Crown And Cushion” pub at Perry Barr. This pre-match is notable for the first-ever photo of Parky and myself together. We watched in the noisy upper tier of the North Stand as a John Terry goal just before half-time sent us to Wembley. The irony is that the attendance was only 36,147 and Fulham – of course – did not sell all of their tickets.\n\n“Thanks, then.”\n\nI took a few photographs on the walk through to the away end. Three police vans were parked on the roundabout near the Witton train station. Emiliano Buendia drove past in his car and some Villa fans close by went all weak at the knees. Amidst the throng of match-goers, a chap stood in the middle of Witton Lane with a “God Is Love” placard. I took outside shots of three of the stands but I did not fancy the trot down to the Holte End on this occasion. Time was moving on and I wanted to get inside to join up with the lads. I could sense an air of buoyancy amidst the home fans.\n\n“The Giant Is Awake” is the current tagline at Villa Park and I suppose they have a point. They are playing their best stuff in years.\n\nI was inside at about 7.30pm. As I spoke to a few fellow travellers in the concourse and in the seating area of the away section, nobody was confident.\n\nI took my seat alongside the lads. We were towards the back of the lower tier and it was a decent view. Chelsea were given 6,298 tickets for this game as opposed to the standard 3,000 for league matches. It seemed that a fair few were going spare if the announcements on social media were a clue. I just hoped that there weren’t large swathes of gaps in our section. I soon realised that the split was around 3,000 in the usual areas of the Witton Lane / Doug Ellis but with around 3,300 in the top tier of the North Stand to our right.\n\nThere were occasional empty seats but this was a magnificent effort from our supporters. While the dynamics have changed – for the worse, for the worse – at home games, thank God that the football calendar can occasionally throw up an occasion like this where the bedrock of the club can get a chance to follow the team en masse.\n\nThe minutes ticked by.\n\nThere were a few rock anthems as the 8pm kick-off approached. Surprisingly, “Hi Ho Silver Lining” was aired – as it was at Wolves – but then “Crazy Train” by Ozzy Osbourne took over as the teams were spotted in the off-centre tunnel.\n\nVilla then overdid it a bit. Not only were there plumes of smoke by the tunnel, but flames all along the pitch by the Doug Ellis Stand and – fackinell – fireworks in the sky above the stadium.\n\nNot to worry, the six thousand Chelsea fans had a response.\n\n“CAREFREE!”\n\nOn a serious note, all of this manufactured noise before kick-off might well look good on TV and it might excite children, but the problem is that it doesn’t allow for atmospheres to sizzle along nicely resulting in a crackling crescendo of noise – self-generated – at kick-off. Maybe those days are gone forever.\n\nSigh.\n\nOur team? No Thiago Silva. No Raheem Sterling.\n\nPetrovic\n\nGusto – Disasi – Badiashile – Chilwell\n\nGallagher – Caicedo – Enzo\n\nMadueke – Palmer – Jackson\n\nThere were a few mumbles and grumbles about the starting positions of Cole Palmer and Nicolas Jackson, but – noticeably – nobody was bemoaning the absence of Raheem Sterling.\n\nOK. Everyone stood. Not many gaps in the immediate area. A few late-comers. Many familiar faces. I still wasn’t confident, but here we go. I tried to juggle photographs with shouts and applause for the team.\n\n“CAM ON YOU BLUE BOYS.”\n\nThe Chelsea players formed a pre-match huddle, and while they waited for captain Ben Chilwell to join them, I spotted Cole Palmer looking over at the Chelsea support in the Doug Ellis Stand. He seemed to be in awe :\n\n“Bloody hell, they have turned up tonight alright. There’s thousands behind the goal too.”\n\nHowever, not all parts of Villa Park were full. I soon spotted hundreds of central seats in the executive areas opposite not being used. That was just odd.\n\nSoon into the game, with Villa attacking our end, a long cross found Alex Moreno unmarked at the far post, but rather than attempt an effort himself he decided to head the ball back across the six-yard box. A defensive head cleared.\n\nIt was a lively start to the game with Chelsea breaking with speed and intensity. Malo Gusto linked with Noni Madueke and worked the ball in to Palmer inside the Villa box at the Holte End. His shot was an easy take for Emiliano Martinez.\n\nThere was a header, shortly after, from Enzo but his compatriot Martinez easily fielded this effort too.\n\nOn eleven minutes, we won the ball out on our left. I stood on tip-toes to watch the move develop. Inside to Conor Gallagher who spread the ball into the path of Jackson. He ran and ran, and played a low ball towards Madueke. Although surrounded by Villa defenders, he wisely took a touch before knocking it back into the path of Gallagher. The shot rose steeply but we erupted when the net rippled.\n\nPandemonium.\n\nBodies and limbs everywhere. I had no hope of taking a shot of the players celebrating away in the corner.\n\nWe were winning. Fackinell.\n\nI was so aware that Conor’s lack of goals is often cited by many as a major-downside. So I was doubly happy that the goal came from him. Lovely.\n\nVilla came into the game but Djordje Petrovic thwarted their couple of attempts on goal including an angled volley from Ollie Watkins.\n\nWe continued to purr. On twenty-one minutes, Disasi found Madueke in tons of space. He turned and pushed the ball wide into the over-lapping Malo Gusto. His cross into the box – a relatively low trajectory – was met by the leap of Jackson. His angled effort crashed into the goal.\n\nWe were 2-0 up, oh my bloody goodness.\n\nI saw the players celebrating through the forest of arms but I managed to cajole a photo or two out of my camera.\n\nThe away support boomed as we continued to dominate. I was really shocked by the lack of noise coming from the home areas though.\n\nNothing. I heard nothing at all.\n\nWe, not surprisingly full of it. However, songs about Willian, John Terry, Frank Lampard and Cesc Fabregas? Really? Save those for the last five minutes of games when we are winning 4-0 plus please. The Willian one was a real shocker.\n\nI took great pleasure in seeing Enzo get more and more involved. Just two examples of his play; the first a cushioned control of the ball with his instep that screamed quality, the second, a first-time transfer of the play from left wing to right wing that told me that he was full of confidence.\n\nAlongside him, Moises Caicedo was enjoying his best game for us, adeptly swatting Villa breaks, tacking hard, turning and passing. And then Gallagher, a one-man search-and-destroy unit, full of energy and running. It was a very fluid and powerful midfield indeed.\n\nThe natives were restless and I was loving it.\n\nChilwell, finding himself on the right, moved inside and unleashed a shot that whizzed just past the near post.\n\nOn thirty-three minutes, Madueke hugged the far touchline as he accelerated away after picking up a loose ball level with our penalty box. He skipped past a challenge and continued his run. He passed to Palmer whose shot was at a relatively easy height for Martinez to save.\n\nOn a rare break, Watkins set up John McGinn, but Petrovic tipped it over.\n\nAt the half-time break, there were nothing but happy faces among the travelling army. It had been, no doubt, the best half of the season by far. Against a decent team, too, let’s not forget.\n\nOzzy serenaded us with “Crazy Train” once again as the teams took to the pitch for the second-half.\n\nThe home team began brightly and I can honestly say that after a quick attack in the first minute I heard the Holte End for the first discernible time.\n\n“Yippee-aye-eh, yippe-aye-oh, Holte Enders in the skoi.”\n\nWe applauded them.\n\nOn fifty-four minutes, a foul on Enzo. The free-kick was a long way out. I wanted Palmer to take it, but Enzo stood with Chilwell. Chilwell peeled away and Enzo took aim. As did I.\n\nSnap.\n\nI looked up to see the ball fly over the wall and dip majestically into the top corner with Martinez beaten.\n\nWhat a goal.\n\nThe away sections again boomed.\n\nZola-esque.\n\nI snapped his euphoric run down to our corner. I sensed the meaning of his actions immediately.\n\n“Look at me. I’m Enzo. I’m staying.”\n\nAh, bloody lovely stuff.\n\nI instantly forgave him for the yellow card that followed him taking his shirt off. Sometimes emotion gets in the way of accountability and rational thought.\n\nThe Chelsea supporters on the side stand piped up.\n\n“North Stand. Give Us A Song. North Stand North Stand Give Us A Song.”\n\nLovely stuff.\n\nWe were through. And we just could not resist a nod to our next opponents.\n\n“We all hate Leeds and Leeds and Leeds…”\n\nAmongst all this, a word for the much-maligned duo of Axel Disasi and Benoit Badiashile. Their best games for ages too. There was even a song, only a few days after many for rubbishing his recent performances.\n\n“Brought us back a centre back. Benoit Badiashile.”\n\nWe’re a fickle bunch aren’t we?\n\nOn sixty-five minutes, a song for a former player that I could fully get behind.\n\n“VIALLI! VIALLI! VIALLI! VIALLI!”\n\nSome late substitutions :\n\n72 : Christopher Nkunku for Jackson.\n\n75 : Raheem Sterling for Madueke.\n\nMoreno rose at the far post but his looping header landed on top of the net rather than inside it.\n\nMore substitutions.\n\n81 : Thiago Silva for Palmer.\n\n87 : Alfie Gilchrist for Badiashile.\n\nVilla had a late flourish and in injury-time, Moussa Diaby coolly slotted in at the Holte End.\n\nAston Villa 1 Chelsea 3.\n\nA roar at the final whistle. What a night. Roared on by over six thousand our team rose to the occasion and played some gorgeous attacking football. Why can’t all away games be like this?\n\nLeeds – you are next.\n\n2023/24 FA Cup Round Five\n\nBlackburn Rovers vs. Newcastle United\n\nBournemouth vs. Leicester City\n\nChelsea vs. Leeds United\n\nCoventry City vs. Maidstone United\n\nLiverpool vs. Southampton\n\nLuton Town vs. Manchester City\n\nNottingham Forest vs. Manchester United\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers vs. Brighton & Hove Albion\n\nWalking out of the stadium after the game brought back memories of other away triumphs over the years. Everyone was singing – “sign him up for eight more years, Chelsea boys are on the beers” – and I sensed a swagger in our step, that good old Chelsea swagger of old. There’s nothing like it. We walked back to the car and we followed the old rule of being able to walk wherever you want after an away win.\n\nUp to the roundabout, out into the road, the cars can stop for us.\n\nThe swagger was back.\n\n1996\n\n2002\n\n2024\n\n1996 – Part 2.\n\nIt came to light after the game at Villa Park that a sports photographer – working for “Action Images” – had taken a photo of my “Ruud Boys” flag from behind the goal.\n\nI spotted that a cropped version of it soon appeared in a copy of “Total Football” later that year.\n\nI didn’t ask for royalties.\n\n1996 – Part 3.\n\nThe former Wimbledon striker Dean Holdsworth once had an affair with glamour model Linsey Dawn McKenzie. At a game at Selhurst Park in the 1996-1997 season – I wasn’t there – the Chelsea fans were full of rude comments about this romantic liaison. In the “Daily Sport” newspaper – that beacon of journalistic integrity – the following day, there was a photo of Linsey Dawn McKenzie (baring all) with a headline to the effect of “How dare Chelsea fans be rude to both Dean and me?”\n\nThe editor chose to illustrate her tirade at the Chelsea fans with a picture of some Chelsea fans, set just behind a large photograph of Linsey Dawn and her quite substantial charms. The photo that the editor chose was from the Villa Park semi-final. It was the photo of my Ruud Boys flag. Or rather, a close-up photo of Glenn and me (looking, strangely, straight at the camera). The story goes that Glenn was sitting with his workmates during a tea break when one of them opened up the middle pages of his “Daily Sport” to exclaim –\n\n“Hey, Glenn – there’s a picture of you and Chris Axon next to Linsey Dawn MacKenzie here.”\n\nNext up, a game at Selhurst Park once again; Crystal Palace away on Monday evening.\n\nSee you there.\n\nChelsea vs. Middlesbrough : 23 January 2024.\n\nMy seat for the second leg of the League Cup semi-final against Middlesbrough was in row Q – the rear row all but one – of the Matthew Harding Upper and I was inside with about fifteen minutes to go. There had been a greater queue than normal outside. It was a very mild night in SW6. I was beginning to regret to regret wearing a bulky puffer jacket. Up the other end, in The Shed, were the brightly-coloured visitors from Teesside, around 5,000 of the buggers, their biggest turnout at Stamford Bridge since “that” game in 1988.\n\nWhile we attempted to overturn a narrow 0-1 deficit from the first leg on this Tuesday night in the Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham, just twenty-four hours later, Fulham would be attempting to overcome a similar result in their semi-final against Liverpool. All of a sudden, our home borough was the centre of attention.\n\nWhile latecomers took their seats, I remained quietly confident of us advancing to yet another Wembley Cup Final. And – of course – we hoped that Fulham would join us.\n\nOn the pitch, the ground staff in matching dark grey puffer jackets of their own prodded away at the wet grass using forks. Then the lights dimmed, and the 1-2 punch occurred.\n\nFirstly, the pulsing electronic beat boomed out of the stadium’s speakers, the strobe lighting began and then the flames flashed into the sky.\n\nSecondly, the “what the fookin’ hell was that?” from the away support.\n\nIt was a very colourful away support, with many of the ‘Boro bedecked in red and white scarves and with replica shirts on show under unbuttoned jackets. I remember a similar number of Tottenham fans at our semi-final in 2019, occupying those same two tiers, and with everyone dressed in dark jackets, a large unsavoury mob, almost looking like a European team. This lot were far more brightly attired. There were a few flags dotted around too.\n\n“We Built the World.”\n\n“You Make Me Happy When Skies Are Grey.”\n\n“We Are Boro.”\n\nMy Middlesbrough mate Chris texted me :\n\n“You’ll probably win the match, but I’ll be happy if we out-sing you.”\n\nWith the players of both teams on the pitch, they then moved to the centre circle and the PA asked us to remember one of our own.\n\nI only ever saw Tommy Baldwin play once for Chelsea. On Saturday 10 October 1974, my second-ever visit to Stamford Bridge, Tommy played against Tottenham in a game that we won 1-0, the goal coming from an early John Hollins penalty.\n\nThe Chelsea team that day was :\n\nJohn Phillips.\n\nGary Locke.\n\nRon Harris.\n\nJohn Hollins\n\nMicky Droy.\n\nJohn Dempsey.\n\nSteve Kember\n\nTommy Baldwin.\n\nCharlie Cooke\n\nIan Hutchinson\n\nPeter Houseman.\n\nIt was also the only time that I saw John Dempsey play. Later that season, Tommy joined Manchester United on loan before drifting away from Stamford Bridge and finishing his career with a few games at Brentford. He had been a stalwart at Chelsea for eight years, playing almost two-hundred games as a bustling midfielder or inside-forward.\n\nI often used to see Tommy Baldwin meeting up with other former players as they congregated together before darting off to engage in hospitality activities on match days. Unfortunately, Tommy had been unwell for quite a while and on Monday we heard that he had sadly passed away. He was seventy-eight. Tommy Baldwin was nicknamed “The Sponge” for reasons that were sometimes debated. There are those that said that it was because of his ability to soak up pressure, attack after attack, in his midfield role. But I suspect that those that knew him better, knew that this was a name derived from his ability to drink. I had read through the detailed obituary that appeared on the Chelsea website on Monday evening; it was a fine summation of his time as a footballer in Chelsea colours and illustrated his often-under-appreciated role in that most revered of Chelsea teams.\n\nAlthough his name was not widely known outside SW6 circles – unlike Bonetti, Osgood, Cooke, Harris, Hollins, Hudson et al – his role in the functioning of the team was acknowledged by us all. He was as no footballing Corporal Sponge.\n\nWhile his image appeared in black and white on the two TV screens, both sets of supporters applauded in his memory.\n\nRest In Peace Tommy Baldwin, The Leader Of The Team.\n\nI scanned our team.\n\nPetrovic\n\nDisasi – Silva – Colwill – Chilwell\n\nPalmer – Caicedo – Fernandez\n\nSterling – Broja – Mudryk\n\nWe attacked the Middlesbrough fans in the first-half. They were, unsurprisingly, noisy.\n\n“That’s why we sing this song for the ‘Boro all night long.”\n\nFor the first ten minutes or so, it seemed like a seamless continuation from the game on Teesside a fortnight ago. They were sat back and we took forever to move the ball from one side of the pitch to the other, while the movement upfront was almost non-existent. A few pumps up field from deep did not hit targets.\n\nThere were a couple of worrying signs early on. Raheem Sterling was ball-watching during a ‘Boro attack, leaving his wide man ridiculously free but thankfully the ball stayed on the opposite side. Then, after getting sucked inside, Ben Chilwell had to race back – and across – like an express train as we were embarrassingly cut open down our left.\n\nBut we enjoyed a couple of efforts in this period; one from Mykhailo Mudrk, one from Chilwell.\n\nDjordje Petrovic got down well to save to his right.\n\nOn fifteen minutes, a swish move down our right involving Cole Palmer and Raheem Sterling set up Armando Broja. From my seat, I could not see the fine detail, but only the ball ending up in the net. We would soon find out that Johnny Howson had stuck out a leg and had scored the goal for us. But, I did not celebrate. Such is the spectre of VAR these days – even when it is not being used – that my celebrations were dulled. Of course, there was no flag, no nothing. The goal stood. It came at just the right time because the supporters in the Matthew Harding were starting to get a little agitated and nervous.\n\nPhew.\n\nThe tie was tied.\n\nThe rest of the first-half, unlike in Middlesbrough, certainly went to plan.\n\nOn twenty-eight minutes, some solid play between Sterling and Axel Disasi down the right set up a chance for Broja. His shot was blocked by a defender but Enzo Fernandez was on hand to slam the ball in. A slide into the corner from Enzo. I could celebrate that one.\n\nEight minutes later, Disasi broke up an attack with a superb tackle and passed to Sterling. As Sterling, who had enjoyed a mixed opening period, raced on, so did Disasi. Sterling played the ball back to our rampaging defender and his low finish put us 3-0 up. There was another slide into the corner.\n\n“That makes up for the chances we missed in the first-half two weeks ago.”\n\nIt was all Chelsea now.\n\nSome were singing “We’re Going To Wembley” but I resisted. It was a little too soon for me.\n\nMiddlesbrough tried to keep their shape but they suddenly looked tired.\n\nDespite the away fans dominating the night for most of the first-half – the twin staples of “your support is fooking shit” and “shall we sing a song for you?” were often heard – they were silent now.\n\nOn forty-two minutes, Palmer pick-pocketed a Middlesbrough defender and casually, and coolly, swept the ball in to the net.\n\nChelsea 4 Middlesbrough.\n\nNow I could join in…\n\n“Que Sera Sera.”\n\nIt had been an excellent half. After that slow start, we had grown as the game progressed. Petrovic had made the one save when he was needed. It was a joy to see Chilwell patrolling the left flank, and just inside him Levi Colwill looked a steady centre-back. We had been treated to two trademark sliding tackles from Silva. Disasi had enjoyed his best half for ages. In midfield, Enzo and Palmer created a few chances with their intelligent play and Moises Caicedo – not the easiest player to appreciate – was very solid. Broja was steady if not spectacular. Sterling was back on his game. The only negative was Mudryk, as perplexing as ever, a mixture of breath-taking speed mixed with jaw-dropping slowness of thought.\n\nBut we were happy at the break.\n\nFackinell.\n\nAt half-time, Nonu Madueke replaced Mudryk.\n\n“It’s probably for the best.”\n\nThe second-half began and I wasn’t quite sure how to behave. Did I want us to rampage away and score four more or conserve ourselves for the FA Cup game on Friday? In truth, we controlled the game without causing too much further damage to the scoresheet nor the away team’s morale.\n\nOn the hour, for the first real time, the whole crowd sang as one.\n\n“CAREFREE.”\n\nThat’s more like it.\n\nSome substitutions.\n\nCarney Chukwuemeka for Chilwell.\n\nConor Gallagher for Broja.\n\nOn seventy-seven minutes, Gallagher played in Palmer down below me, who did not bother with the burden of an additional touch and – as cool as you like – side-footed the ball in. Soon after, a blue flare was thrown onto the pitch from the MHL. It made for a great photo opportunity if nothing else.\n\nOn eighty-one minutes, Gallagher passed to Madueke, who shimmied and danced past a marker before slamming the ball at goal. The shot took a large deflection.\n\nChelsea 6 Middlesbrough 0.\n\nI was impressed that the away fans had been singing in the build up to the sixth goal and continued doing so when the goal came and for a while after too. Fair play to them. The biggest compliment that I can give them is that they reminded me of us when we were in our hey-day.\n\nThere was even time for a late debut.\n\nLeo Casteldine – “player number 54 where are you?” – replaced Sterling.\n\nI am unsure if we were being intentionally ironic, but we sang :\n\n“Shall we sing a song for you?”\n\nMiddlesbrough had two late goals; one annulled for offside but one stood, a fine low effort by Morgan Rogers.\n\nAt the whistle, Chelsea 6 Middlesbrough 1.\n\nI quickly gathered my stuff and headed out.\n\n“Blue Day” from 1997 blasted out on the PA. As I headed down the multiple flights of stairs at the rear of the stand, I heard the sweet voice of Doris Day. It did not compute. The opening bars just made me think of “that” Leeds song.\n\nI then got it.\n\n“Que sera sera.\n\nWhatever will be, will be.\n\nWe’re going to Wem-ber-lee.\n\nQue sera, sera.”\n\nOn the Fulham Road, there was some boisterous behaviour, some name-calling, some gesturing, some punches, some arrests.\n\nOutside the town hall, I spotted a female ‘Boro fan, arm in arm with her man – to possibly stop herself from falling over – who pointed at two Chelsea women and shouted “Chelsea Rent Girls!”\n\nWell, I had never heard that one before.\n\nWe got back to the car and set off for home at 10.30pm. I would be home by 1am. We hoped that the little brothers from Craven Cottage would do the business in the other semi-final, but our business in our borough was over for a few days.\n\nNext up, Aston Villa in the other cup on Friday.\n\nSee you there.\n\nPostscript 1 :\n\nThere was a regret that I didn’t hear Tommy Baldwin’s song during the game. Admitedly it is best suited for pre-match beers in the pub or concourse, but we always used to sing it at games.\n\n“Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee’re the Fulham Road supporters and we’re louder than The Kop.”\n\nPostscript 2 :\n\nNice to see my two friends Annette and Mark featured in the evening’s programme. They sometimes act as my unpaid spell-checkers.\n\nChelsea vs. Fulham : 13 January 2024.\n\nOn the long drive home from Middlesbrough last Wednesday, with the Semi-Final first leg defeat still fresh in my mind, I am not sure if I was overly brutal or just pragmatic about the rest of our campaign.\n\n“Listen, we are a tenth place team. We’ll beat Middlesbrough in the second leg and get to the final but lose to Liverpool once we get there. We’ll lose to Villa in the FA Cup. And that’s our season done.”\n\nHowever, by the time I had picked up the others – PD, Glenn, Parky, Ron – on the Saturday for the drive to London for the Fulham game at Stamford Bridge, my viewpoint had noticeably softened.\n\n“Well, I saw the highlights on “YouTube” and let’s be honest, Cole Palmer should have scored two. It could so easily have been one of those games where we didn’t play particularly well but squeaked a narrow win. New manager, new players, let’s give it some time. We have seen worse.”\n\nThoughts turned towards Fulham. We have a bloody marvellous record against this lot and at Stamford Bridge especially. However, although I had recently read that our last defeat at home to Fulham was forty-four years ago, there was absolutely no chance of me mentioning this to the lads in the car, bearing in mind how they had chastised me for talking about my unbeaten record against ‘Boro.\n\nThe last home defeat?\n\nSaturday 27 October 1979, a 0-2 loss in front of a very healthy 30,567 gate in the old Second Division.\n\n44 years.\n\n21 games.\n\n13 wins.\n\n8 draws.\n\n0 defeats.\n\nIt’s a very decent record indeed. Going back further, to our first home game against Fulham in 1911, the total stats are equally impressive.\n\n113 years.\n\n45 games.\n\n25 wins.\n\n18 draws.\n\n2 defeats.\n\nThe only other home defeat?\n\nSaturday 7 March 1964, a 1-2 defeat in front of a disappointing 26,219 in the old First Division.\n\nWith the kick-off for the 2023/24 version of the “SW6 Derby” taking place at 12.30pm, the pre-match routine took on a different guise. When I had dropped into “The Old Oak” last week, Alan had informed me that its doors would be opening at 9am for the Fulham game. This news was met with nods of approval from my fellow passengers. So, at about 9.20am I dropped Parky and PD outside the pub, which is just over the border to the north of Fulham in Hammersmith. I then drove down the North End Road and the Fulham Road to deposit Ron at the main gates bang on 9.30am. I was parked up on Normand Road a few minutes after. We bumped into Liz and Pete just as they were parking up. Glenn and I soon disappeared into a packed “Café Delight” for a quick breakfast, a first-ever visit. There were a couple of familiar faces in there. The clientele then moved south to “The Clarence” or “The Old Oak.”\n\nPD and Parky were supping pints of lager and we joined them at about 10.15am. More familiar faces were dotted around. I soon spotted Stu, a fellow season-ticket holder, who only lives four miles away from me. He sadly lost his wife Sue not so long ago – I went to Sue’s sixtieth birthday four years ago – and so I gave him a hug and offered words of sympathy. I spoke to Jonesy and Jocka, two lovely lads from the Nuneaton area, and we spoke a little about life – and Chelsea.\n\nJonesy pulled up a seat.\n\nWe mentioned the photos that I shared from the 1998 League Cup Final. We spoke about how quickly the time has gone since then.\n\n“Twenty-six years ago.”\n\nJonesy stated the unbelievable truth that in another twenty-six years some of us won’t be around.\n\n“Yeah. I’ll be eighty-four.”\n\nAnd yet 1998 seems fresh in my mind.\n\n“Life is accelerating away these days, mate.”\n\n“Don’t worry, Jonesy. The way we are playing at the moment, the next ten years will drag like fuck.”\n\nWe laughed.\n\nI met Mick from Hemel Hempstead for the first time and it was a pleasure. Mick has been reading these ramblings of mine for a while. He spotted me and came over to chat with the lads. It’s always nice to get positive feedback. I chuckled when he dropped one of my catchphrases in to the conversation.\n\nAt 11.45am we set off down the North End Road. A little mob of Fulham were – in football parlance – “giving it large” on their walk past outside the West Stand.\n\n“Stamford Bridge is falling down.”\n\nI just chuckled.\n\nI took my place in The Sleepy Hollow. Two of the usual four – Alan and Clive – were unable to attend. Glenn had Clive’s ticket and a young lad called Dan from way up in Carlisle had taken Alan’s ticket.\n\n“You’ve got some big boots to fill, mate.”\n\nBut Carlisle. Phew, that’s some train ride. Respect.\n\nThere was pre-match chat with Oxford Frank and we were both hoping for another three points to maybe edge closer, or even past, Manchester United and Newcastle United.\n\nOur team? It was the same as against ‘Boro apart from one change. Armando Broja was in to the lead the line, with Cole Palmer shifted to the wing in place of Noni Madueke.\n\n28\n\n27 – 6 – 2 – 26\n\n8 – 25\n\n20 – 23 – 7\n\n19\n\nIn the Fulham team, one man stood out.\n\n20\n\nIt was a cold winter day; a time for warm jackets, hats and caps.\n\nBig Brother vs. Little Brother.\n\nSW6 1HS vs. SW6 6HH.\n\nBlues vs. Whites.\n\nPensioners vs. Cottagers.\n\nChelstam vs. Fulhamish.\n\nThere has always been a very special relationship between the two clubs. It was always said that for the local populations in and around Fulham, Hammersmith, Chelsea, Putney and Battersea, football fans would go to Stamford Bridge one week and Craven Cottage the next.\n\nAs payment for taking wedding photos at a Chelsea wedding back in 2020, I was gifted a huge case of football programmes, including some lovely Wembley Cup Finals and England internationals from the ‘fifties. They all belonged to one man, a friend of Mick, the groom. But of special note here is that among many Chelsea home programmes were hundreds of Fulham programmes, from the ‘fifties onwards, too. It illustrates how the support was shared between the two clubs.\n\nHowever, they hate us these days.\n\nOn the other hand, we can’t be bothered about them.\n\nOh well.\n\nThe game began and for the first five minutes it felt like a continuation of the Middlesbrough game the previous Tuesday; tons of foreplay and no penetration.\n\nWe needed to get dirty.\n\nThe Fulham fans were bellowing about “One team in Fulham” and we responded, half-heartedly, with the usual “Come on Chelsea.”\n\nIt was all pretty timid stuff.\n\nAs the game began to get going, a shot from Enzo was blocked, and then the best move of the match resulted in a shot from Conor Gallagher rising over the bar at The Shed End.\n\nWe soon all admitted that we could see Willian – 20 for them, not 22 for us – drifting inside, down below us in familiar territory, dropping a shoulder and curling one in under the bar.\n\nShudder.\n\nOn twenty minutes, Armando Broja made a fine move towards the near post and flashed a header just wide of the goal. Until then, his lack of movement and lack of a physical threat was starting to wind me up.\n\nMidway through the half, there were two Fulham efforts on the Chelsea goal to my left. The second came after a fine move had found Harry Wilson and it needed an excellent save from Djordje Petrovic at his near post.\n\nChelsea were unsurprisingly dominant, but there were only glimpses of decent play, of players combining well, of coherent patterns. Not for the first time I lamented the movement off the ball. On two occasions, if only Broja had realised it, he was in acres of space if he had feinted one way and then spun the other. A pass or two from Silva would have released him.\n\nWillian came over to take part in a short corner. I rose to applaud him. As did many. I don’t go for singing songs about former players, but I certainly felt fine with applauding him just the once. The noise was loud. He clapped us too. I see nothing wrong with any of that. It shows us all in a good light, I think.\n\nTwo efforts from us; one from Cole Palmer, not at his best thus far, and a riser from Enzo, who was starting to show a lot more spirit to his performance.\n\nA crunching tackle from Malo Gusto left Willian rolling in pain, but I was too far away to see the detail.\n\nWe were treated to a ridiculous turn and dummy from Moises Caicedo on Wilson. The look of pain on the Fulham player’s face was – er – a picture.\n\nIn the last moments of the first-half, Palmer advanced and was thankfully aware of Raheem Sterling screaming for the ball to be played into him. A lovely reverse ball set him up. It seems that the Football Gods have decreed that Fulham must always have a towering player called Diop in their team, and it was the 2024 version – Issa – who took an ungainly chop at Sterling just as he cut past him. From one hundred yards away it looked a penalty.\n\n…in my mind : “either a penalty or a booking for a dive.”\n\nThe maligned Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot.\n\nPhew.\n\nCole Palmer took the ball. His record with penalties is perfect for us.\n\nHe slotted it home.\n\nGET IN.\n\nThe goal came at a perfect time. It meant that there were no boos at half-time. In truth, although not a vintage performance, I was quietly content with some of our play. In my mind, Enzo Fernandez and Levi Colwill were enjoying their best games for a while.\n\nBaby steps and all that malarkey.\n\nThe second half began. There was a noticeable increase in intensity from the players, and the crowd, certainly in the Matthew Harding, responded well. In the first few minutes of the second period, Broja found himself in a central area of the box, but could not get a shot away. He was ridiculously marked but took an extra touch, as is his wont.\n\nOn fifty minutes, a bender from Palmer whizzed over. Two minutes later, Sterling rose so well and headed down and against a post, but was flagged for offside.\n\nAt the other end, a deflected Fulham cross from in front of their fans, but a resulting header flew over.\n\nA couple of pacey Chelsea attacks, the fleet-footed Gusto involved on both occasions, but blocks from the Fulham rear-guard kept us at bay. This was an excellent spell from us.\n\nOn sixty-six minutes, Noni Madueke replaced Broja.\n\nPalmer moved centrally as a false nine. From here, there were a few tricks and spins. I like him in a central role.\n\nJust after, Colwill curled a shot over from the edge of the box.\n\nWe longed for a second goal.\n\nEnzo continued his little resurgence. He showed a lot more spirit, fight, intensity, and drive. We need that. We need him creating from deep. We need Palmer creating further up field. Amongst everything, Conor Gallagher was on his game, closing down space, winning fifty-fifties, setting the tempo. Thiago Silva was magnificent as the second-half developed.\n\nMadueke was often involved. I like the way that he uses his body, how he forces himself across defenders, using his upper body to barge past.\n\nHowever, a rare Fulham chance caused palpitations. Andres Pereira found space in the box and passed to Raul Jimenez. The low shot was thankfully saved by Petrovic, who dropped to his right and threw out an arm. It was a really fine save.\n\nOn seventy-seven minutes, a roar as Ben Chilwell replaced Sterling. I spent a few minutes working out if our shape had changed. Chilwell for Sterling seemed to be a straight swap.\n\nOn eighty-two minutes, a nice run from Madueke set up Gallagher, who was rather hemmed in, but beautifully curled a shot at goal with the outside of his right boot. The ball curved and smacked the left upright.\n\nFackinell.\n\nColwill continued to impress. One ball out to the wing was immaculate, with just the right amount of fade for it to drop into the path of our player.\n\nOn eighty-four minutes, Enzo gave the ball up cheaply and it lead to a free-kick being rewarded by Taylor. It was central, right on the edge of the box. Who else but Willian took the ball. I hoped that it was too central for him to get a good angle.\n\nI turned around to the blokes behind me.\n\n“Here we go then. We have all been fearing this.”\n\nHe clipped the ball over the wall, but over the bar too.\n\nI turned to them again.\n\n“He has gone downhill, that Willian.”\n\nWe laughed.\n\nMadueke forced a low save from Leno.\n\n…inside my head : “shouldn’t we be closing this game out rather than chasing a second?”\n\nTwo late substitutions.\n\nNice applause for Carney Chukwuemeka, replacing Palmer.\n\nWarm applause for Alfie Gilchrist, replacing Gusto.\n\nIt was all very fraught in the final moments of the game. A couple of Fulham free-kicks out on their right were slung into the box. The first one was sent deep, but after penalty-box pinball, the ball was hoofed clear. The second resulted in head tennis, but again our goal remained intact.\n\nTaylor blew up.\n\nRelief.\n\nBack in the car, we were happy. It wasn’t a bad outing and we had marked our third consecutive league win in a row. We had beaten Fulham at Stamford Bridge yet again. We had risen slightly in the table. I headed back to the West Country a contented Chelsea supporter.\n\nI stopped at Reading Services to hear that Frome Town were drawing 0-0 at home to Paulton Rovers. As I dropped off Parky, just after 5pm, I was to learn that my home town team had edged it 1-0. Lovely stuff.\n\nI dropped off Ron. I often say to him, as I collect him to take him up to Stamford Bridge, “have you brought your boots?”\n\nHis stock reply to this is always “they couldn’t afford my wages, Chris.”\n\nWell, on this occasion, perhaps it was just as well that Chopper had left his boots at home. The reason? Ron was playing for us on Saturday 7 March 1964 and also on Saturday 27 October 1979.\n\nI didn’t like to mention it.\n\nI dropped off Glenn, I dropped off PD. I reached home at just after 6pm.\n\nIt had been a good day.\n\nNext up, that second leg against ‘Boro. Let’s make some bloody noise. See you there.\n\nChelsea vs. Preston North End : 6 January 2024.\n\nWith the Christmas period over, our first match of 2024 saw us paired in a home FA Cup tie against Preston North End. Our paths do not cross much these days; this only would be our ninth head-to-head since 1963.\n\nI recollected the previous two, both FA Cup ties, from 2002 and 2010. These have been my only sightings of the lilywhites from Lancashire.\n\nOn 17 February 2002, we played Preston at Stamford Bridge in the fifth round of the FA Cup. I remembered the visitors going ahead with an early goal – which I happened to capture on film – but my memory was of it being scored by Jon Macken, but it was actually scored by Richard Cresswell. Thankfully, we recovered well and triumphed 3-1 with goals from Eidur Gudjohnsen, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Mikael Forssell. The gate was just 28,133, possibly a result of the club not getting the pricing structure correct back in those days.\n\nOn 23 January 2010, on a cold and misty day, Parky and I travelled up to Deepdale and watched us beat the home team 2-0 with goals from Nicolas Anelka and Daniel Sturridge. The gate was 23,119. Before the game, there was time for a quick photograph of the lovely statue of Sir Tom Finney, the Preston plumber, outside the stadium. This statue, nicknamed “The Splash”, is based on the famous photograph taken at Stamford Bridge in 1956 of Finney evading a tackle by Chelsea defender Walter Bennet, and captures the sun hitting the water as it is splashing up from a water-sodden pitch. In 2010, the National Football Museum was based at Deepdale, but it has since moved to Manchester. I remember being impressed by Deepdale, a neat and clean modern stadium. However, there is nothing much left of note in Preston these days, except perhaps its bus station, a brutalist gem.\n\nThere are a few other Preston “moments” in Chelsea’s history and social history.\n\nDuring the FA Cup run of 1968/69, we drew 0-0 at Deepdale and reconvened at Stamford Bridge on the following Wednesday. We were 2-0 up in front of 44,000 but after seventy-five minutes the floodlights failed. Lo and behold, the game was replayed on the following Monday when 36,000 showed up to see us win 2-1.\n\nAn episode of “Minder” was filmed at Stamford Bridge on the afternoon of 20 September 1980 during our game against Preston. The segment shows actor Denis Waterman watching at the bottom of The Shed terrace with some friends interspersed with some actual game footage, including a great little cameo by Mike Fillery, before he walks along the gangway at the back of The Benches.\n\nOn 28 February 1981, Chelsea fan Gary Lee was tragically killed after being chased, with some friends, by locals before our away game at Preston when he slipped and fell from a multi-story car park. At the game in 2010, supporters close to where I watched the game raised a banner in his memory. His mother, the well-loved Breda, was always on the Chelsea Specials. I remember seeing her around Stamford Bridge and at our away games on many occasions.\n\nGary Lee RIP\n\nI dropped my fellow travellers at “The Eight Bells” and at Stamford Bridge and I parked up just off Lillee Road at about 11.15am. I had a little time to kill. I would eventually meet up with the lads in the pub, but wanted a bite to eat. Lillee Road is the site of the 1873 FA Cup Final, just as it nears West Brompton tube station.\n\nAs I started walking down the North End Road, I spotted that the “Norbros” pizzeria next to “The Goose” had been re-opened as “Koka” and so as it was lunchtime I popped in for some food. Midway through my pizza I spotted Alan walk past, no doubt on his way up to “The Oak” further along the North End Road. In an instant, I decided to join him for a drink and the title of this “Tales” was immediately decided upon.\n\nI walked north, past “The Elm” which looked like it was being refurbished. Just as I was about to pop my head inside inside “The Old Oak”, I saw a Chelsea face pass by. He was heading a hundred yards further north to “The Clarence”. These little run of pubs are decidedly old school. No tourists make it up to these parts, away from the match day buzz and shiny attractions around Stamford bridge. Opposite “The Old Oak” is the site of “The Seven Stars”, a lovely old art deco pub that we popped into once or twice back in the mid-‘nineties, once after the 1997 FA Cup parade at Fulham Broadway. It is now flats but the façade has remained. I wondered if any North End supporters would be drinking anywhere along the North End Road. Maybe up at “The Famous Three Kings”, where we used to drink a few years back? I remembered some Sheffield Wednesday fans in there in 2019.\n\nAlan and Gal were inside “The Old Oak” and I joined them for a while. I hadn’t visited this particular pub since early 2019/20. My friendship with Alan goes back to 1984. My friendship with Gary goes back to around 1988.\n\nI then did myself proud. Rather than take the tube or bus, I walked the 1.6 miles from “The Old Oak” to “The Eight Bells” and got some steps in. It is pretty much a classic match day walk, deep in the heart of Fulham; down the North End Road, onto Fulham Road, onto Fulham High Street. I spotted a family of PNE fans opposite “The Temperance” but I was surprised that neither “The Temperance” nor “The King’s Arms” was full of away fans. Where the bloody hell were they? With six thousand of them in town, they couldn’t all be drinking at Earl’s Court surely?\n\nWhen I had set off from “The Oak”, at 2.25pm, I texted PD to say that I would be about thirty-five minutes. At 3pm exactly, I walked into “The Eight Bells.”\n\nI work in logistics.\n\nIt was a rather shortened drink-up in there. The pub was quiet. Still no away fans anywhere. With the tubes knackered, we caught a bus to Fulham Broadway.\n\nAs expected, Preston had the entire Shed End, some six-thousand strong. Again, I had swapped out with Parky to allow him to sit next to PD and Alan. I took up my “Cup” position in the MHU.\n\nThe team?\n\nPetrovic\n\nGilchrist – Disasi – Colwill – Gusto\n\nCaicedo – Enzo\n\nSterling – Palmer – Mudryk\n\nBroja\n\nSo, a full start for Alfie, soon becoming a Chelsea cult-hero.\n\nThe usual darkened arena, lights flashing, flames.\n\nOnce normal lighting had been resumed, there was a moment of reflection on the one-year anniversary of the passing of Gianluca Vialli. A banner was passed below in the MHL. This struck me as being a “first”. I do not recollect us acknowledging anniversaries of the passing of past players ever before. I think this exemplifies how much the great man was truly adored in SW6. Well done Chelsea.\n\nGianluca Vialli RIP\n\nAt kick-off, there was a ridiculous “shift” from Preston. Four players were lined-up on the half-way line between the centre circle and the East Stand touchline. Here was a variance on the way to start a match. I liked that. A deviation. Something out of the ordinary. One of the hideous buzzwords in popular football parlance these days is “overload” but here was a fine example of it. The ball was played back to Freddie Woodman, the ‘keeper, who pumped into the air. Chelsea won the first header and the resulting second ball.\n\nOh well. Next time Preston.\n\nThe first-half was shite, eh?\n\nI am not going to waste too much time writing about it.\n\nAs expected, the six thousand in The Shed were suitably energised and full of noise.\n\n“Jump around if you hate Blackpool.”\n\nAh yes, the rivalries in Lancashire are alive and kicking; Blackburn and Burnley, Preston and Blackpool, lovely.\n\n“PNE, PNE, PNE – PNE, PNE, PNE – PNE, PNE PNE – PNE – PNE!”\n\nAh, good old Paeonia lactiflora.\n\nPerhaps we should have replied with a song about Apium graveolens.\n\nOur first attempt on goal came after fifteen minutes. Then the visitors had a dig at our goal. But this was lukewarm stuff. On twenty minutes, Raheem Sterling unleashed a stinger at Woodman.\n\nI was sat next to strangers, and both were ridiculously quiet. I found myself commentating at times in the way that many football fans do.\n\n“Second ball!”\n\n“Don’t let it drop.”\n\n“Into them, Chels,”\n\nI felt a bit odd. I needed to engage with someone. Thankfully John and his son were sat right behind me, so I was grateful for an outlet.\n\nI could not but help notice that Alfie was wearing black boots. It seemed like he was trying to “out JT” John Terry.\n\nA beautiful ball from Enzo was lofted into space but Cole Palmer was quickly closed down by the Preston ‘keeper and the ball bounced wide. This remained virtually the sole moment of unscripted innovation from the whole team in that turgid first-half.\n\nThere was angled shot by a Preston attacker, but easily saved by Djordje Petrovic.\n\nThe half-hour was reached and it was so dull. I was getting so perplexed with the continued lack of movement from those in advanced positions. Armando Broja, like Nicolas Jackson, needs to move their markers more often. Everywhere I looked, we had players who were ball-watching, mesmerized into a state of inertia. There were hardly any runners looking to exploit space.\n\nWe would have been no match for Tony Hancock’s mother’s gravy which “at least moved about.”\n\nPalmer was a meagre plus point. Enzo showed a very occasional hint that he might be able to unlock things, but this was a terrible game. As the end of the first-half approached, even the away fans had almost given up on it, their noise decreasing with each passing minute. There were even a few muted boos as the referee signalled the end of the first forty-five minutes. I was mentally preparing for two more days off work to attend the replay at Deepdale in ten days’ time.\n\nAt the start of the half-time break, just before I trotted off to turn my bike around, I joked with John that I was leaving my camera at my seat so I would be forced to return for the second-half.\n\nChelsea attacked us in the Matthew Harding in the second-half. Early on, a lovely ball from Enzo was dropped towards Palmer but the ball fell short and he could not get a touch as it bounced above his leap.\n\nA Moises Caicedo error allowed a Preston attack but the effort from Alan Browne was always curing over.\n\nThroughout the game, the away team chose the currently out-of-favour style of goal kicks; all players huddled either side of the half-way line and a boot up field from the ‘keeper.\n\nJust after a booming shout of “Fuck The Tories” from the away supporters, Malo Gusto sent over a pacey cross down below me. A leap from Broja, a flick, and the ball ripped into the goal.\n\nOh how we love the sight of footballs nestling against the white mesh of goal nets.\n\nThe crowd was now alive at last.\n\nFifty-eight minutes had passed.\n\nCFC 1 PNE 0.\n\nGET IN.\n\nIn The Sleepy Hollow, Alan sent me a text that I soon reciprocated.\n\nYou know how it goes.\n\nBroja charged down a poor clearance but could not convert. Soon after, almost a copy of the first goal. A great cross from Mudryk, another leap from Broja, but the ball scraped the bar this time.\n\nOoooh.\n\nSome substitutions on sixty-one minutes.\n\nThiago Silva for Gilchrist.\n\nNoni Madueke for Mydruk.\n\nSilva slotted alongside Disasi, Colwill moved to left-back, Gusto moved to right-back.\n\nOn sixty-six minutes, a Palmer corner kick from my left and our right zipped towards the near post. Silva rose and headed it convincingly past Woodman.\n\nCFC 2 PNE 0.\n\nGET IN.\n\nI caught Silva’s celebrations on film, if not the goal. He was certainly pumped full of passion. He roared. I spotted him place a clenched fist beneath his shirt to signify his heart.\n\nAn iconic image.\n\nShortly after, John and I were completely bemused and befuddled as to why VAR had been consulted.\n\nThe. Goal. Came. Direct. From. A. Corner.\n\nVAR – do fuck off.\n\nAn air horn had been surreptitiously smuggled into the East Lower and every time that it sounded, I could not help but notice the predominantly young voices that responded “CHELSEA!”\n\nA very odd sensation. It sounded like every single voice had yet to brake; a choir of pre-pubescent young’uns. I looked around. There were, indeed, many more families with kids in attendance than for normal league games.\n\nThree minutes later, Palmer was fouled centrally and Sterling took aim. I caught his approach and strike on film. The ball spun and dipped over the wall. I could hardly believe it had beaten everyone.\n\nAnother roar.\n\nCFC 3 PNE 0.\n\nGET IN.\n\nI caught his run and leap too.\n\nThree goals in just ten minutes. And the floodlights stayed on.\n\nBroja came close again, but an effort was cleared off the line.\n\nOn seventy-six minutes, more substitutions.\n\nConor Gallagher for Palmer.\n\nDeivid Washington for Broja.\n\nThere were shots on goal from Gusto and Gallagher.\n\nOn eighty-eight minutes, a ridiculous scramble inside the Preston box, but the ball eventually presented itself for Enzo to prod home.\n\nWe celebrated but we soon saw a flag for offside. To be fair, it looked offside. Oh well. Then, the elongated pain of VAR. The players all tracked back to the half-way line. The wait seemed to go too long. Maybe ninety seconds? Ridiculous.\n\nThe sign from the referee : goal.\n\nI did not celebrate.\n\nCFC 4 PNE 0.\n\nI hate VAR.\n\nA very late substitution.\n\nMichael Golding for Enzo.\n\nThe substitute almost prodded home a debut goal. There was still time for a rousing “Zigger Zagger” from Cathy down below the lads in The Sleepy Hollow, a merry dance into the box by Madueke but a blocked shot and an effort from Sterling that zipped wide.\n\nIt finished 4-0.\n\nI am not sure what Mauricio Pochettino had dropped into the players’ cocoa at half-time but it certainly worked.\n\nWe made our way home and into the next round. Who do I fancy in Round Four?\n\nAn away game at any of these please –\n\nCoventry City\n\nIpswich Town\n\nMaidstone United\n\nNewport County or Eastleigh\n\nPlymouth Argyle\n\nSheffield Wednesday\n\nWrexham\n\nNow that we are not actively involved in the league’s top placings nor in European competitions, the two domestic cup competitions really are the focus of our attention this season.\n\nNext up, more days off work and another cup tie.\n\nMiddlesbrough away, Tuesday night, a League Cup semi-final, a Chicken Parmo,I can’t wait.\n\nSee you there.\n\n2002.\n\n2010.\n\nTHE NORTH END ROAD.\n\n2024 PART ONE.\n\nMYKHAILO MUDRYK.\n\nTHIAGO SILVA.\n\nRAHEEM STERLING.\n\n2024 PART TWO.\n\nChelsea vs. Brighton And Hove Albion : 3 December 2023.\n\nThere was a black and white photograph of Terry Venables on the front of the match programme. The news of his sad passing, at the age of eighty, came through while we were sat at a café in Gateshead on the day after the match at Newcastle. He had actually died on the day of the game. Although he had played for three other London teams, and managed them all, he was always fondly remembered at Chelsea, a club that he never really wanted to leave. Later that Sunday, in the pub that had become our local for the weekend, we raised our glasses in memory of one of the brightest lights of that ‘sixties Chelsea team, and one of the most innovative coaches of the past few decades.\n\nI never saw Terry Venables play. In fact, he was the manager of the opposing team in games that I saw a surprisingly few times. But he always seemed to me to be a genuine football man. The tales of him taking on Tommy Docherty with ideas of football tactics are legendary, and undoubtedly the reason why he was eventually moved on from Chelsea. There was only ever going to be one winner there. He joined the hated Tottenham, then QPR, then Crystal Palace. He was cherry-picked by Barcelona and won La Liga in his first season at Camp Nou. Alongside him as his number two was Alan Harris, brother of Ron. I always remember that I did a tour of the towering Barcelona stadium with two college mates in September 1987 on the very day that “El Tel” got the elbow, sacked after just over three seasons at one of the World’s largest clubs. As we left the stadium, I remember a gaggle of folk assembling outside the main stand and, at the time, I did not know why. The next day, we found out.\n\nLater, there was Tottenham and a few famous battles with Chelsea. With England there were the highs – I was at the Holland and Spain games of Euro ’96 – and lows of being national team manager.\n\nTerry Venables was an English football legend who lived life to the full – a singer and novelist too – and touched the lives of many. I often wonder how Chelsea’s story would have panned out if he had stayed in 1966.\n\nRest In Peace.\n\nI was inside at about 1.30pm ahead of the 2pm kick-off, and I found myself chatting to my mate Daryl. Neither of us were too optimistic about the outcome of the upcoming match with Brighton.\n\n“I’ll be happy with a draw mate.”\n\nAfter the second-half capitulation at Newcastle, it felt that the twin games against Tottenham and City were a blip and that our state of health was again being questioned.\n\nIt had been a decent pre-match and the tight confines of “The Eight Bells” had been livened by the appearance of our friends Linda and Deano, calling in before their three-month adventure in Thailand, and also my Brighton mate Mac and his four pals, plus Chad, Danny and Josh from Minnesota.\n\nUnlike the coldness of the day before, the weather was mild. The Chelsea team was announced and I took a look at it.\n\nIn goal, Robert Sanchez. A back four – without the suspended Reece James and Marc Cucarella – of Axel Disasi, Thiago Silva, Benoit Badiashile and Levi Colwill. In midfield, Moises Caicedo, Enzo Fernandez and Conor Gallagher. Out wide were Raheem Sterling and Mykhailo Mudryk. In the middle, Nicolas Jackson.\n\nNo Cole Palmer.\n\nThree former Brighton players; Sanchez, Colwill, Caicedo.\n\nI immediately turned to Alan and admitted that I – probably for no logical reason – disliked tall full-backs.\n\n“Only Ivanovic was any good…”\n\nWhy is that? I do prefer full-backs to be more compact, nippier, think Ashley Cole, Graeme Le Saux, Cesar Azpilicueta.\n\nOur back four was made up of centre-backs and with Brighton likely to be quick and agile, I feared the worst. At least there was no Kaoru Mitoma in the starting line-up.\n\nThere were a few moments of applause in memory of Terry Venables before the game began.\n\nAfter showing up in a vivid orange away kit for the League Cup game at the end of September, this time the Brighton kit man chose green and black striped shirts. It didn’t look right. If you were playing for your school and an opposing school showed up in green and black stripes, you would fancy your chances.\n\n“Looks like a rugby-playing school this, lads. Who wears green and black? Into them!”\n\nWell, despite all this, Brighton began brighter and I wondered if even a draw might be a tad optimistic. But we dug in, became a little more aggressive and won some battles. Conor Gallagher carried out his usual corner routine of holding the ball up above his head for a moment, before placing it in the quadrant.\n\n“That’s code for another shit corner…”\n\nOne or two of these missed their intended targets.\n\nA ball was played through to Nicolas Jackson who ran on but soon ran out of steam. I would soon lament that he had neither the pace, strength nor nous to be effective.\n\nLo and behold, on seventeen minutes, another Gallagher corner from out on our right beat the first man and Benoit Badiashile did ever so well to keep the ball alive and hook it back into the six-yard box. Enzo Fernandez rose to head home, and then celebrated wildly down in Parkyville.\n\nGET IN.\n\nJackson then surprised everyone with an excellent dribble into the box and to the by-line before prodding it goal wards but the Brighton ‘keeper Jason Steele saved. The rebound was headed well wide by Enzo.\n\nThis was a good little spell for us and a cross from Sterling was hit into the danger area but went off for a corner. Gallagher’s delivery again caused Brighton problems. Jackson headed back for Levi Colwill to head towards goal. In the follow up, a shot from Axel Disasi was thumped against the side netting. We groaned. But within a heartbeat the initial header from Colwill was signalled as having crossed the line. There was only four minutes between the two goals.\n\n2-0, oh my bloody goodness.\n\nThe game then meandered for a while. Despite us being 2-0 up, the atmosphere inside Stamford Bridge was truly dreadful. The away fans – any away fans – can usually be relied to stir things up a little, but the Brighton fans were as quiet as us.\n\nPah.\n\nThere was defensive hari-kari in our six-yard box, and – really Mister Pochettino – we need words, I already had a few heart attacks back in 2020. Please stop all that buggering about please.\n\nSimon Adingra seemed to be giving Axel Disasi a bit of a runaround.\n\nMykhailo Mudryk spun on a sixpence and accelerated away but his shot just missed the target. His effort was warmly applauded. Bit of an enigma, that kid, eh? We all wish him well though.\n\nIt wasn’t great, despite the 2-0 score line.\n\nPD blurted out “poor” just as I was thinking it.\n\nIt was deathly quiet.\n\nSadly, just before half-time, Facundo Buonanotte was on the end of an uncontested move and sent a fine curling shot between defenders and past Robert Sanchez to narrow the margin.\n\nBollocks.\n\nRaheem Sterling danced into the Brighton box but then fell over himself.\n\nAnother rapid break from Mydruk down the left showed him at his best; electric pace, a dangerous cross. Sadly, this resulted in a quite brilliant reflex save from Steele as a Brighton defender deflected the cross goal wards.\n\nThe away fans had found their voices.\n\n“Albion, Albion…Albion, Albion.”\n\nThen, a very clumsy – and silly – challenge by the previously-booked Gallagher on our former player Billy Gilmour resulted in a second yellow and marching orders.\n\nThe Brighton lot were happy.\n\n“Cheerio, Palace scum.”\n\nThis was the second red for a captain in consecutive games.\n\nFackinell.\n\nIt had been a Curate’s Egg of a first-half. There had been periods of good play but areas of concern too. I spoke with Oxford Frank about our failings during the first period. Despite the two goals, much of it was pedestrian. I recounted the game I attended on Saturday, a come-from-behind win by Frome Town at home to lowly Exmouth Town, and soon realised that I was far more excited as I found myself describing that game than dwelling on the match taking place below us. A special mention for my mate Josh – one of the Minnesota triplets – who travelled down to Somerset specially to see Frome play. The win, in front of a decent 376, left Frome in third place but with plenty of games in hand.\n\nAs I returned to my seat, Clive and Alan were in discussion about our second teams; Clive with Hereford, Alan with Bromley, me with Frome Town.\n\n“If your two teams played each other, who would you want to win?”\n\nAnd it is a great question.\n\nI was asked this same question years ago, maybe before my love for Frome Town reached its full blossoming, and I replied “Chelsea, of course…”\n\nNow, it’s a little more blurred.\n\nBut it’s still Chelsea.\n\nSay, though, Frome Town defeat Torquay United in the FA Trophy next Saturday and are then drawn away to Oldham Athletic on the same day that Chelsea at home to Fulham on Saturday 13 January. What to do? What to do? Thinking about that could ruin my Christmas.\n\nThe second-half began.\n\nAfter five minutes of play, the Stamford Bridge crowd eventually took the bull by the horns and got involved with the usual strains of “Amazing Grace” being used :\n\n“Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea – Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea.”\n\nYou know how it goes.\n\nI joined in. But I then – gulp – realised that this was my first vocal involvement of the entire bloody game. Oh Christ. Is this what I have become? My 1993 self would have been distraught to see this. Bloody good time travel is not yet with us.\n\nWe were down to ten men, of course, but it didn’t really show.\n\nRoberto De Zerbi made four substitutions on the hour, including James Milner, a player I have loathed for ages now.\n\nAlan had just been talking to Clive about playing Mudryk down the middle – not always, just on occasion, to mix things a little – when we broke at pace.\n\nA Brighton corner was claimed by Sanchez. A roll out to Sterling. To Jackson. To Mudryk. In on goal. Milner racing back.\n\nI took a photograph.\n\nMudryk’s legs crumpled.\n\nDid I immediately think it was a penalty? I hoped so.\n\nPlay continued. The crowd was roaring. I studied the image I had taken. I had my own little review. It looked like he had been caught.\n\nVAR was called into action.\n\nThe nerds at Stockley Park were not sure.\n\nBack it went to the referee Craif Pawson.\n\nPenalty.\n\nI did not cheer.\n\nEnzo.\n\nGoal.\n\nA roar from me.\n\nA roar from everyone.\n\nA slide into the corner down below us.\n\nSnap.\n\nGET IN YOU BEAUTY.\n\nObjectively speaking, my thoughts are that if the team of VAR “experts” can’t decide, then it doesn’t go back to the referee on the side of the pitch. The initial decision stands. I know that it would have meant that we would not have won that penalty, but VAR is killing our game.\n\nThe chants in support of the team grew louder.\n\n“Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea – Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea.”\n\nWe played well in the remainder. Pochettino made further substitutions.\n\nCole Palmer for Sterling.\n\nIan Maatsen for Jackson.\n\nAn extra man at the back now? I thought so,\n\nArmando Broja for Mudryk.\n\nWe were treated to a punt up field from Sanchez for Broja and I approved. A little variation in our attacking play always makes the opponents uneasy.\n\n“Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea – Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea.”\n\nThat man Mitoma looked lively. Sanchez stretched low to turn away a long shot from Pascal Gross.\n\nTen minutes of extra time were signalled.\n\nA corner from their left, in front of their fans, was whipped in and Joao Pedro lept well to glance the ball in; near post to far post.\n\nOh God.\n\nThe rain was lashing down now.\n\nThe minutes ticked by.\n\nI kept glancing at Alan’s ‘phone; he always puts the timer on at ninety minutes.\n\n6 minutes.\n\n8 minutes.\n\nAnother save down low from Sanchez.\n\n10 minutes.\n\nA cross from Adingra was slashed in.\n\nI saw nothing, nothing odd, nothing untoward. Imagine my shock when it became apparent that a penalty had been awarded.\n\nWhat? Why? Who? Where? How?\n\nThose of us in the ground were baffled, but obviously crestfallen. There was a big old kerfuffle in the penalty box. Confusion reigned.\n\nVAR.\n\nAnother delay.\n\nThe referee went back to the TV screen.\n\nAnother delay.\n\nI was fearing the worst.\n\nThe referee drew a rectangle with his hands like some stupid game of charades.\n\nI thought it was a penalty that he had signalled.\n\nSo did the Brighton fans who roared.\n\nMy heart sank.\n\nBut then a roar from the home fans.\n\nWhat?\n\nNo penalty.\n\nWhat the fuck has happened to our game?\n\nChelsea vs. AFC Wimbledon : 30 August 2023.\n\nA Winning Weekend.\n\nLast Friday’s 3-0 win at home to Luton Town was the first of four wins out of four over the Bank Holiday Weekend. It was followed by a narrow 1-0 away win for Frome Town at Yate Town on Saturday afternoon and a decent 2-0 home win against Larkhall Athletic on Monday afternoon in another local derby for my home-town team. I really enjoyed both games.\n\nSandwiched in between the two Frome games, I made an appearance at the Royal United Hospital in Bath on Sunday afternoon. Back in June, I had experienced an odd tenderness in my stomach, that thankfully only lasted around three weeks, but in the various tests that had followed, it was decided that a colonoscopy was required. This obviously brought a certain degree of worry. I think it was seeing the words “suspected bowel cancer” on a letter than brought it all home. There was one in early August that turned out to be inconclusive, but I was overjoyed to hear that the second one had found no abnormalities at all.\n\nI was clear.\n\nSuffice to say, I was a lot more relaxed at the Frome Town home game on Monday than I had been at the away game forty-eight hours earlier.\n\nSo, four wins out of four.\n\nPeroni don’t do weekends, but if they did…\n\nDifferent Club, Same Name.\n\nPlaying in the early round of the League Cup is a rare thing at Chelsea. As always, most people I know were looking for a new away ground to visit in the “Southern Section” (is that a new thing? I guess we had just never been exposed to it before) so there was a certain degree of being underwhelmed at the prospect of a home game, albeit against AFC Wimbledon. The rise of this new club through the football pyramid since the original team were moved lock, stock and barrel to Milton Keynes is surely one of the greatest stories of the past few decades. The tie would represent the two team’s first-ever fixture.\n\nThe original Wimbledon Football Club came into my recognition back in 1974/75 during their FA Cup run. They won away at Burnley, becoming the first non-league team in over a century to defeat a First Division team in an away tie. In the next round, they drew 0-0 at Elland Road against champions Leeds United before narrowly losing the replay at Plough Lane. They joined the Football League in 1977. The club rose steadily through the divisions and joined Chelsea in the First Division in 1986/87.\n\nExisting on small crowds, the club were favourites to be relegated. But in that first season at the highest level, despite an average attendance of around 8,000, they finished in a ridiculously high sixth position, way ahead of us in fourteenth place. They even beat us in the two league meetings; 4-0 at Stamford Bridge in December and 2-1 at Plough Lane in May.\n\nThey would often hand us heavy defeats at Stamford Bridge. There was a 5-2 win in December 1989 and a 4-2 win in October 1996.\n\nWe might well have had the last laugh in 1996/97 though, beating the Dons 3-0 in the FA Cup semi-final at Highbury. It was only when the club ground-shared at Selhurst Park from 1991/92 that gates increased, topping off with an average of 18,000 in 1998/99. Away fans often boosted crowds at these Wimbledon home games.\n\nI watched from a distance as the club fell apart and were moved to Milton Keynes. It was the saddest thing. For this reason, MK Dons remain hated throughout most of our football landscape.\n\nA side story. It is rumoured that Wimbledon’s move from south-west London to Buckinghamshire in 2004 was as big a shift as Arsenal’s move across London in 1913. The time it took supporters to physically travel from Wimbledon to Milton Keynes on a match day was virtually the same as the time it took supporters of Woolwich Arsenal to travel from Plumstead to Highbury using the transport available at the time. Think on that, Arsenal fans. It’s no wonder Tottenham dislike them so much, the original franchise team.\n\nThere is no place for franchise football in the UK.\n\nFarewell My Friend.\n\nOver the weekend, I heard some horrible news. My friend Russ, who used to sit a few rows in front of me in The Sleepy Hollow from 1997 to 2011, had sadly lost a long battle with cancer on Saturday evening. Russ was a lovely man, and Chelsea mad like all of us. On many occasions, I would leave my car at his house in Shepperton and he would drop me off at various terminals at Heathrow as I travelled to see Chelsea in far off locations. He did this for me from 2009 – Chelsea in Baltimore and Arlington – to 2019 – Chelsea in Baku – and I used to love chatting to him on those drives. I last spoke to him on the ‘phone just after Thomas Tuchel took over in 2021 and we were chatting on WhatsApp earlier this summer. He faced his battle bravely. He leaves his wife Kim and daughter Emily.\n\nOn the last few miles of our trip to London for the AFC Wimbledon game, for some reason I spotted a grey van as it slowly moved along a tree-lined avenue as I flew past on the M4. I have no reason as to why I paid attention to it. Imagine my reaction when I spotted that the van belonged to the same small firm of freight forwarders that Russ worked for.\n\nRuss Kemp. Love you mate. Rest In Peace.\n\nChelsea Is A Club, Not A Team.\n\nThe build up to the game was dominated by the news that Chelsea Football Club, despite promising a full period of consultation with supporter groups, had unilaterally decided to abandon the away travel subsidy this season. This dismayed many supporters and hinted at a bleak future of poor fan-related decisions under the new regime. In reality, this only affected a few hundred supporters per away game – maybe between three and five coaches – and indeed not all away games were serviced by the coaches, but this news cut deep. Originally, from my memory, Chelsea used to subsidise some coaches – and trains – at £10, and then after a large TV deal, the Premier League asked for some of the monies to be used by clubs to take away the sting of away travel. As everyone with half a brain knows, away fans are the lifeblood of our game in this country. Without a loyal band of vociferous away supporters at every game, noise levels would decrease and “the product” would be more difficult to sell to TV companies and, with it, advertisers.\n\nThe game needs away support.\n\nAnd those coaches have been a Godsend to many. I know many have used them over the past ten years or so. My fellow companions Alan, Gary and John always use them for tough away games in the Midlands and the North. Not everyone can afford car travel, n"
