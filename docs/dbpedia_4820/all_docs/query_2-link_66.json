        "text": "What Is the Suit Direct Stadium Like?\n\nVictoria Park, now known as the Suit Direct Stadium due to sponsorship reasons, is a traditional compact ground. On one side is the Cyril Knowles Stand, named after a former manager which was opened for the start of the 1995/96 season. It is a small single tier covered all seated stand, raised above the ground level.\n\nOpposite is the older Neale Cooper Stand (also named after a former manager). Opened in 1968 it has covered seating to the rear and an open terrace to the front. This stand does not run the full length of the pitch and has an odd mix of orange and green seating, which clashes with the club colours.\n\nAt the Town End, which was opened a couple of months after the Cyril Knowles Stand, is a covered terrace that is the home end.\n\nOpposite is Rink End which is a small, covered all-seated stand that houses away supporters. The ground has a set of four tall traditional floodlight pylons.\n\nWhat is it like for away supporters?\n\nThe wind whipping the North Sea goes right through you, so wrap up well unless there is a heat wave. Away fans are in the Rink End at one end of the ground, where up to 967 can be seated. Unfortunately there, are a few supporting pillars in this stand, which may hinder your view, especially if there is a large away following.\n\nThe acoustics of the stand are good even for small numbers, meaning that plenty of noise can be generated. Food on offer inside the ground includes hot dogs, pies and burgers.\n\nPubs for away fans\n\nPubs near the Suit Direct Stadium for away fans:\n\nThe Ward Jackson – 3-9 Church St, Hartlepool TS24 7EU\n\nLoons – 10 Victoria Rd, Hartlepool TS24 7SD\n\nThe Royal – Church St, Hartlepool TS24 7DN\n\nLatest Developments\n\nThe current Hartlepool stadium doesn’t have long left in its current state. It either needs major revamp or for the club to relocate. Given the club and council, who own the ground, have been discussing options for several years, something big is coming for the future of the Hartlepool stadium.\n\nWhat does that look like? Well, it will incorporate a substantial leisure facility alongside other commercial and hospitality units to boost the local area; the idea being the football club and the local area will mutually benefit from the entire development.\n\nGround History\n\nVictoria Park, which is named after Queen Victoria, was originally built to be the home of a rugby club. It wasn’t until some 22 years later that Hartlepool football club moved in. WW1 saw a bomb attack obliterate the main stand, which meant rebuild work was needed. Unfortunately, cash flow issues meant they actually used a wooden ‘stop gap’ stand until the eighties!\n\nIt wasn’t a one off though; Hartlepool were always behind the curve on the development of their stadium. They were the last club to have floodlights installed too. The mid nineties, however, did see some cash thrown around as two stands were completely revamped. Changes since then have been few and far between.\n\nDirections and Car Parking\n\nFrom the A19 take the A689 towards Hartlepool. Stay on this road following the Town Centre signs for 2.8 miles, over two roundabouts. Go straight over the next two sets of lights, passing Hartlepool College on your right. The next left takes you to the stadium. If you miss the turning (as I did), go past ASDA on your left, left at the next roundabout and then left at the next traffic lights for the ground.\n\nThere is limited car parking at the ground for away fans but these need to be booked in advance with the club.\n\nNear to the Millhouse Pub (TS24 8AP ) off Raby Road is a car park which charges £3 on matchdays. Otherwise, there is some street parking albeit a bit of a distance away, as a residents-only parking scheme is in operation on matchdays around the ground.\n\nPost Code for SAT NAV: TS24 8BZ\n\nBy Train\n\nHartlepool Railway Station is a ten minute walk from the Victoria Park ground. Leave the station and go straight up a short approach road. At the end of the approach, turn right and head up Church Street towards the large church. At the end of this road is a bridge and junction with the A689. Go straight across the junction and the ground is in front of you on the left hand side of the road.\n\nTicket Prices\n\nHartlepool ticket prices 2023/24:\n\nAdults: £20\n\nConcessions: £14\n\nUnder 18s: £10\n\nUnder 14s: £5\n\nUnder 5s: £0\n\nProgramme Price\n\nOfficial Programme £3.\n\nBiggest Rivals\n\nHartlepool vs Darlington rivalry: This rivalry has brought about several flash points across the years as the two sides have faced off an awful lot. They’re only separated by 25 miles so it’s more than points at stake.\n\nHartlepool vs York City rivalry: York and Hartlepool are more than twice the distance apart of Darlington and Hartlepool but Victoria Park isn’t the most pleasant atmosphere York players face. They too now find themselves out of the football league with meetings much reduced but there was a time when Hartlepool vs York City was each team’s biggest game.\n\nFixture List\n\nHartlepool United FC fixture list\n\nDisabled facilities\n\nFor details of disabled facilities and club contact at the ground please visit the relevant page on the Level Playing Field website.\n\nRecord and Average Attendance\n\nRecord Attendance\n\n17,426 v Manchester United\n\nFA Cup 3rd Round, January 5th, 1957.\n\nAverage Attendance\n\n2022-2023: 4,777 (League Two)\n\n2021-2022: 4,884 (League Two)\n\n2020-2021: N/A (Covid)\n\n2019-2020: 3,283 (National League)\n\n2018-2019: 3,124 (National League)\n\n2017-2018: 3,350 (National League)\n\n2016-2017: 3,788 (League Two)\n\nLocation Map showing the location of Victoria Park, railway station & listed pubs\n\nClub links\n\nOfficial Web Site:\n\nwww.hartlepoolunited.co.uk\n\nVictoria Park Hartlepool United Feedback"
