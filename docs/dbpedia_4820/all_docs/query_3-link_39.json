        "text": "Lookers has unveiled an all-new Nissan dealership in Carlisle following a transformative investment of £750,000.\n\nOriginally developed in 1990, the Lookers Nissan dealership had been serving the Carlisle community for over three decades before closing temporarily earlier this year to facilitate a complete redesign and upgrade.\n\nThe spacious new building is home to a strong, growing team of 42 staff and has been future-proofed to accommodate growing customer numbers from across Carlisle and beyond.\n\nLocated on the Rosehill Industrial Estate in the east of the city, the transformed Nissan dealership provides a new and enhanced showroom experience. A much larger floor area has enough room for up to 12 vehicles, allowing customers to explore the new Nissan models – including a growing electric range – in a lighter, bright and airy space.\n\nThe enlarged showroom area also provides for a new two-car bay customer handover area and includes a relocation of the sales and service team offices to provide an improved customer lounge.\n\nGraham Stokoe, General Manager, Lookers Nissan Carlisle, said the new dealership was a gamechanger for the city. “This investment in our Nissan Carlisle showroom is a positive sign for the future and the local economy and a real gamechanger for the area.\n\n“At Lookers, we work hard to give every customer a first-class experience and we’re delighted to reveal this outstanding, bright and modern showroom to better meet their needs.\n\n“We’re excited to be welcoming customers back to see and experience this transformation and to enjoy the extensive range of new and approved used Nissan models in real style and comfort.”\n\nThis latest Lookers investment cements its commitment to Nissan and to future collaborative growth.\n\nSteve Eley, Lookers Nissan Franchise Director, said: “As the UK moves to all-electric driving and petrol and diesel cars begin to take a back seat, Nissan is playing a pivotal role with a new and innovative range of electric and hybrid models and we’re delighted for Nissan to be partnering with us on this incredible journey.\n\n“This amazing new state-of-the-art space has been perfectly designed to showcase the best of Nissan including the highly anticipated new ARIYA electric crossover due in our showroom in the new year, the fully-electric Nissan LEAF and the new mild hybrid Nissan Qashqai.”"
