        "text": "Consett showed their fighting spirit today by coming from behind three times to draw 4-4 in a pulsating clash with Northern League leaders Hebburn Town at Belle View Stadium.\n\nThe Steelmen fell behind after just four minutes, when ex-Newcastle player Michael Richardson broke down the left. Consett keeper Kyle Hayes saved his initial shot, but Ben Dibb-Fuller reached the loose ball first to give the visitors the lead.\n\nConsett responded well, and on seven minutes they were level. Luke Carr picked up the ball in midfield and went on a mazy run where he beat three opponents before firing home to make it 1-1.\n\nFive minutes before half-time Consett took the lead as Calvin Smith crossed from the right, Arjun Purewal controlled the ball in the box, and teed up Dale Pearson to fire home his 17th goal in his last 12 games.\n\nTwo minutes into the second half Hebburn equalised. Good work by right-back Dan Groves set up Michael Richardson to score from a few yards out.\n\nThree minutes later the league leaders were back in front. Richardson delivered a left-wing corner into the box, and Graeme Armstrong netted from close range to make it 3-2 to Hebburn.\n\nIncredibly, in the 53rd minute Consett made it 3-3, with right-back Jermaine Metz cutting in from the flank and beating the keeper with a near-post effort which seemed to go through his legs.\n\nThe game was now anybody’s, and Hebburn must have thought they had won it when Dibb-Fuller’s crossfield ball was rifled into the net on the half-volley by Jack Robson to make it 4-3 to the visitors in the 73rd minute.\n\nIt was a stunning goal, good enough to win any game, but Consett weren’t finished yet. On 76 minutes the game swung their way when Hebburn were reduced to 10 men after skipper Louis Storey was shown a second yellow card and then red for crudely halting the lively Carr – not for the first time.\n\nConsett came close to levelling in the 80th minute when Carr played a free-kick short to Jake Orrell, whose well-struck effort was superbly tipped over by Hebburn keeper Andrew Jennison, at full stretch.\n\nThe Steelmen threw everything at the league leaders, and eventually their pressure paid off, when substitute Wouter Verstraaten‘s shot from just inside the box, pictured, was deflected past Jennison in the 90th minute, for his first goal for the club.\n\nIt made the final score 4-4 – probably a fair result – in a game which was a superb advert for everything the Northern League has to offer, in front of a bumper crowd of 610.\n\nFull match report and more pictures to follow.\n\nConsett’s reward for their thrilling 5-4 win at Gateshead in the Durham Challenge Cup this week is a home tie in the 2nd Round against Esh Winning from the Northern League 2nd Division.\n\nThe game will be played at Belle View Stadium on a date to be fixed, though ties must be played by Saturday 21 December.\n\nThe complete 2nd Round draw is as follows:\n\nNewton Aycliffe v Stockton Town\n\nHartlepool United v Birtley Town/Tow Law Town\n\nFC Hartlepool v Jarrow FC/West Auckland Town\n\nSpennymoor Town v Sunderland RCA\n\nConsett v Esh Winning\n\nSunderland AFC v Willington/Hebburn Town\n\nSouth Shields v Billingham Town\n\nWhickham v Seaham Red Star/Horden Colliery Welfare\n\nConsett and Esh Winning have met twice before in the Durham Challenge Cup, with the Steelmen winning by the odd goal on each occasion.\n\n1984/85 2nd Qual Rd Esh Winning 0 Consett 1 (Fowler)\n\n2009-10 1st Round Esh Winning 3 Consett 4 (Pounder 4)\n\nThis season, Esh received a bye in the Preliminary Round, before winning 4-3 at Darlington RA in the 1st Round.\n\nIt will be the clubs’ first competitive fixture since August 2010, when we met twice in the space of three days in Division One, winning 4-2 at our old Belle Vue Park ground, then 5-2 at Waterhouses.\n\nBookings are being taken now for seats on the official Consett AFC trip to Irlam, for the FA Vase 2nd Round tie on Saturday 2 November.\n\nOur club sponsor Stanley Travel will once again be providing the coach for players and officials, with a limited number of seats available to supporters.\n\nThe cost is £10 per person, and as usual it is first-come, first-served. Names are being taken at the bar in the clubhouse, and seats must be paid for in advance.\n\nThe coach will leave Belle View at 10am, to allow for possible delays on the M62 on the way to Greater Manchester.\n\nKick-off at Irlam’s Ambitek Stadium, in Silver Street, Irlam (M44 6JJ) is at 3pm. Admission is £5 for adults, £3 for OAPs and £1 for under-15s.\n\nFor those making their own way, there is a large free car park alongside the ground, off Silver Street. If it is full, street parking is available. Please consider local residents’ access to and from their properties.\n\nThe ground has its own clubhouse, along with a refreshment cabin selling a selection of hot and cold food and drinks. Toilets are at the rear of the cabin, with a disabled facility available inside the changing rooms.\n\nDeparture time for home depends what time the game finishes, as extra time will be played if the scores are level after 90 minutes.\n\nConsett remain third in the 1st Division after an excellent 3-0 win at Shildon – their first victory at Dean Street in five visits.\n\nThe Steelmen took the lead in the 10th minute when Calvin Smith’s precise pass saw Dale Pearson run onto the ball and bury it into the net with an excellent first-time finish.\n\nIt was the big striker’s 12th goal of the season, all scored in his last 10 games, and better was to follow.\n\nIn the 18th minute it was 2-0 when Ali Alshabeeb gave Pearson an almost identical chance, and again he drilled the ball home. His 13th of the season was certainly unlucky for Shildon.\n\nPearson and Luke Carr both had chances to increase the visitors’ lead as they passed the home team off the park, and the pair were both within inches of scoring from a great Darren Holden cross.\n\nKyle Hayes made an important save from Billy Greulich-Smith right on half-time, and the Steelmen carried a fully deserved 2-0 lead into the break.\n\nEleven minutes into the second half Consett scored again, though there was an element of good fortune about the goal which made it 3-0.\n\nA poor clearance by goalkeeper Shaun Newbrook fell to Carr, who slipped the ball to Jake Orrell. He drove into the box, and his shot was deflected past the stranded Shildon keeper by a defender.\n\nShildon had lots of possession in what was left of the game, leaving Consett to play on the break, and although both sides had a few chances, there were no more goals.\n\nThe result draws Consett level on points with second-placed Stockton Town, who were surprisingly beaten 1-0 at Ryhope CW, though the Anchors have lots of games in hand.\n\nNewton Aycliffe, who won 1-0 at Billingham Town, are 4th on the same points, again with games in hand, while North Shields, who beat Newcastle benfield 4-2, are a point behind in 5th.\n\nMany thanks to Stephen Finch for the excellent picture of Dale Pearson’s second goal which illustrates this article.\n\nFull match report and more pictures to follow.\n\nConsett eased into the knockout stage of the League Cup as they beat Brandon United on a night of firsts – one of them unwanted.\n\nIt was the Steelmen’s first visit to the Welfare Ground in 15 years, and they won 5-0 to top Group D with a 100% record, with four wins from four games.\n\nMichael Brown made his first start for the club, and scored his first goal, while Dan Hawkins got his first goal in more than two years after recovering from a career-threatening injury.\n\nBut Matty Slocombe also made history of the unwanted kind, becoming the first Consett player ever sent to the sin bin, for dissent to the referee late in the game.\n\nThe hosts made things hard for their visitors in the first half an hour, working hard and denying them space. Their best chance came in the 28th minute, when Calvin Smith hit a superb effort from 25 yards, which young keeper Callum Simms touched onto and over the bar.\n\nBut the midfielder, who is enjoying his best-ever season in front of goal, was not to be denied, and broke the deadlock a minute later, firing in from eight yards after Andrei-Vasile Ardelean had headed down Jake Stafford’s corner. It was Smith’s 11th goal of the season.\n\nThree minutes later it was 2-0, as Dan Hawkins cut in from the left and fired past the keeper, with the aid of a deflection.\n\nIt was the midfielder’s first goal since August 2017, when he scored in a 4-3 win at Stockton Town, though he has spent much of the intervening time injured.\n\nIt remained 2-0 at half-time, but within nine minutes of the restart it was three, as Hawkins turned provider for Michael Brown to lash home his first senior goal for the club on his first competitive start.\n\nIt was Brown’s last part in the game, as he was replaced by Dale Pearson, and the big striker made it 4-0 in the 77th minute, firing in left-footed after a free-kick from fellow sub Jake Orrell. The goal was Pearson 11th in his last nine games, making him joint-top scorer.\n\nSlocombe, who had come on for Smith at half-time, earned his dubious place in club history in the 84th minute, when he was sin-binned for dissent after contesting the award of a free-kick against him a little too vigorously with the referee.\n\nBut the 10 men of Consett made it 5-0 in the 87th minute when Orrell’s cross from the left saw Andrei-Vasile Ardelean volley in from six yards to complete the scoring.\n\nFull match report and more pictures to follow.\n\nLeague Cup - Group D\n\nPosClubPWDLFAGDPts1 Consett541018810132 Thornaby42021410463 Newcastle Benfield320165164 Bedlington Terriers4103810-235 Brandon United3003215-130\n\nDale Pearson’s ninth goal in his last seven games gave Consett a 4-3 win over Thornaby in a cracking League Cup encounter at Belle View Stadium tonight.\n\nThe victory means that with one game still to play, the Steelmen are virtually assured of progressing to the knockout stage of the competition.\n\nThey had to come from behind twice to claim the three points in the Group D game, with the Teessiders leading twice in the first half.\n\nThe visitors opened the scoring after just three minutes when Consett went to sleep at a throw-in. The ball was crossed in deep from the right, headed back into the middle, where Thornaby captain Joe Scaife-Wheatley was on hand to make it 1-0.\n\nIt took just four minutes for Consett to level, as Thornaby failed to deal with a corner, and Andrei-Vasile Ardelean headed in from close range to make it 1-1.\n\nIt was a good, open game, with both sides intent on attacking, and Pearson almost gave Consett the lead with a cross from the left which caught on the breeze and hit the bar.\n\nNick Allen almost scored in the 21st minute with a fine acrobatic effort from a left-wing cross, but Thornaby keeper Adrian Beblowski pulled off a superb save, diving low to his right to scoop the ball away.\n\nOn the half-hour the keeper then saved well from Pearson, and Consett penalty claims were waved away as Ali Alshabeeb appeared to be fouled as he prepared to finish the loose ball.\n\nSeconds later the Steelmen were behind again, as a swift counter-attack saw Thornaby striker Daniel Chapman make it 2-1.\n\nA minute before half-time it was all square again, as Alshabeeb found Luke Carr at the end of a mazy dribble, and the No 10 finished into the bottom corner.\n\nThe first minute of added time saw Consett go in front for the first time, with a superb goal from top scorer Calvin Smith. The midfielder picked the ball up 20 yards out, looked up, and curled an unstoppable effort into the top-right corner to give his side a 3-2 half-time lead.\n\nThornaby looked dangerous on the break all night, and in the 56th minute Ian Ward made it 3-3 via the underside of the bar.\n\nThe last half an hour belonged to Consett, and if it hadn’t been for Thornaby keeper Beblowski, the home side would have enjoyed a comfortable victory.\n\nHe made fine saves from Carr, Jake Orrell and Alshabeeb before Dale Pearson got what proved to be the winner in the 80th minute. Carr fed the ball to the in-form striker on the edge of the box, and he unleashed a thunderbolt into the top corner to make it 4-3.\n\nFull match report and more pictures HERE.\n\nLeague Cup - Group D\n\nPosClubPWDLFAGDPts1 Consett541018810132 Thornaby42021410463 Newcastle Benfield320165164 Bedlington Terriers4103810-235 Brandon United3003215-130\n\nConsett suffered their first defeat in seven games today when they lost 2-1 at West Auckland in a game they finished with only nine men.\n\nThe Steelmen took the lead in the 36th minute, slightly against the run of play, when Luke Carr’s superb pass sent Dale Pearson clear, and although keeper Tom Flynn got a foot to his shot, the ball looped up and over him and into the back of the net.\n\nBut things started to unravel for Consett just three minutes later when they were reduced to 10 men, after Carr was shown a straight red card for something he said to the referee.\n\nTwo minutes before time their one-goal advantage had been wiped out too, as West equalised. Anthony Bell’s cross was headed powerfully goalwards by Amar Purewal – the twin brother of Consett skipper Arjun – and although Kyle Hayes made a good diving save, ex-Steelman David Dowson reacted quickest to fire home the loose ball for 1-1.\n\nConsett brought Nick Allen on for Ali Alshabeeb at half-time, and sat deeper after the break, content to soak up pressure and play on the break, but they almost came unstuck in the 74th minute when Arron Thompson’s shot rattled the crossbar, and Dowson fired over from the rebound.\n\nThe respite only lasted two minutes, however, as West sub Alex Francis scored a goal good enough to win any game, curling the ball into the top corner from 25 yards, to make it 2-1.\n\nConsett’s 10 men almost grabbed an equaliser in the 85th minute, when a superb run down the right by Jermaine Metz saw him set up sub Andre-Vasile Ardelean, but the striker’s shot on the turn was denied by Flynn, who always seems to save his best performances for when he faces his former club.\n\nThere was a final sting in the tale for Consett in the 90th minute when Jake Stafford was shown a second yellow and then the inevitable red card after a last-man foul on Francis. It left them to play out the five minutes of added time with only nine men.\n\nThe result means Consett remain third in the table, a point ahead of Shildon and Billingham Town, who both have games in hand.\n\nFull match report and more pictures HERE.\n\nConsett went top of Group D in the League Cup tonight with a comfortable 3-1 away win at 2nd Division Bedlington Terriers.\n\nA dominant first-half performance laid the foundations for the victory in the Steelmen’s first visit to Dr Pit Welfare Park since April 2016.\n\nAndrei-Ardelean opened the scoring on 15 minutes with his first goal in 10 games, controlling Jake Stafford’s ball into the box superbly before turning and shooting into the far corner.\n\nA minute later Calvin Smith made it 2-0, firing home from the edge of the box, with his shot beating the keeper with the aid of a wicked bobble. It was the midfielder’s 9th goal of the season – his best-ever tally for the club.\n\nJust before half-time, recent signing Jake Orrell – making his first start after being given his debut as a sub at Stockton on Saturday – made it 3-0.\n\nJermaine Metz was fouled out wide on the right, and with everyone waiting for Orrell to deliver the free-kick into the box, he spotted a gap at the near post, and beat the keeper from an acute angle.\n\nConsett had chances to increase their lead in the second half, most notably when Ardelean rolled a shot inches wide after drawing the keeper, pictured, while Orrell hit the bar with a follow-up after unselfishly setting up Ardelean and seeing his initial effort blocked by the keeper.\n\nSubstitute Leighton Hopper grabbed a consolation goal for Bedlington in the 88th minute when a long clearance from the keeper sent him clear, and he kept his cool to fire past Kyle Hayes to make the final score 3-1.\n\nThomas McAloon played the full 90 minutes in his first appearance since rejoining Consett, while latest signing Wouter Verstraaten came on at half-time for his debut.\n\nLeague Cup - Group D\n\nPosClubPWDLFAGDPts1 Consett541018810132 Thornaby42021410463 Newcastle Benfield320165164 Bedlington Terriers4103810-235 Brandon United3003215-130\n\nFull match report and more pictures to follow.\n\nConsett have announced the signing of attacking midfielder Jake Orrell, who has just been released by Blyth Spartans.\n\nThe National League North side announced on Friday that the 22-year-old’s contract had been cancelled by mutual consent.\n\nOrrell is a player who has been on Consett’s radar for some time, and the club acted quickly to speak to him and agree terms once his availability was known. He went straight into the squad for the match against second-placed Stockton Town at the Coverall Stadium.\n\nOrrell began his career at the Sunderland AFC Academy, before joining Gateshead in January 2015, and making six substitute appearances for them towards the end of the 2014-15 season.\n\nA trial at Chesterfield earned him a professional contract, and he made two first-team appearances for the League One side before being loaned out to Matlock Town, and then joining Hartlepool United on a free transfer in June 2016.\n\nAfter a spell with Spennymoor Town in the Northern Premier League, he joined Northern League club Newcastle Benfield in October 2017, and was a member of the side who were League Cup runners-up last season.\n\nHe signed for Blyth Spartans in the summer, and although he had featured regularly, appearing in 10 of their 13 games this season, the club said the decision to release him from his contract was agreed reluctantly, at the player’s request.\n\nManager Lee Clark said: “Jake came to see me about leaving. I was disappointed, but if anyone wants to play at a lower level then they have not got the ambition I want. I wish Jake all the best for his future career.”\n\nJake said: “There was only one choice of club for me on leaving Blyth, and that was Consett. They’re a great club with big ambition, and can’t wait to get started.”"
