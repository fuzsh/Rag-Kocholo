Scott Burgess did well to nick the ball in the 53rd minute, driving it forward, but the Pools backline retreated well to stop the setup reaching Akinyemi.\n\nAn end-to-end exchange occurred after City won a corner in the 58th minute, when Fallowfield initially looked to pick out Akinyemi in the middle from a cross.\n\nThe corner was hooked away, recycled by Fallowfield, before a scramble occurred inside the area, with Chadwick hitting hard but into bodies.\n\nPools countered on their clearance, winning a corner but seeing their turn to whip one in draw a blank too.\n\nIn the 63rd minute, Paddy McLaughlin went in hard to win the ball to spark a City attack. It went left to Chadwick out wide, who picked out Akinyemi however a wild header followed.\n\nThe end-to-end nature of the game continued to flow when a minute later Callum Cooke arrowed one wide of the mark from just outside the area.\n\nAkinyemi continued to try and spark an opening for City as the game went on, sending a curled effort wide of Joel Dixon’s left-hand post.\n\nMcLaughlin continued to battle in the middle, throwing in a heavy but clean tackle on substitute Courtey Senior to halt a Hartlepool counterattack.\n\nDieseruvwe broke the deadlock in the 72nd minute, tapping into an empty net following Sykes-Kenworthy’s loose clearance on a cross from the right-hand flank.\n\nA double was notched in the 87th minute as the striker calmly converted the penalty won by the hosts.\n\nAkinyemi put life back into the tie to give glimmer of hope when he found the lower bottom corner after pulling the trigger on a shot inside the area.\n\nDespite a further effort from the forward, which bent wide, City couldn’t replicate their successes in past to snatch a point late on.\n\nHARLEPOOL UNITED: Dixon, Ferguson (43’ Onariase), Mancini (77’ Grey), Dieseruvwe, Cooke, Crawford, Hendrie, Parkes, Featherstone ©, Khan (69’ Senior), Waterfall.\n\nUNUSED SUBS: Jameson, Duffus.\n\nYORK CITY: Sykes-Kenworthy, Fallowfield ©, Crookes (90+3’ Barnes), McLaughlin, Davies (76’ John-Lewis), Akinyemi, Howe, Chadwick, Burgess (76’ Kennedy), Woodyard, Smith.\n\nUNUSED SUBS: Duckworth, Cordner."
