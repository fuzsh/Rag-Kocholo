        "text": "Livingston have allowed defender Tom Parkes to join National League side Hartlepool.\n\nThe centre-back made 27 appearances for Livi in an injury-hit spell in West Lothian after signing from Exeter in the summer of 2021.\n\nThe former Bristol Rovers and Carlisle player had an 18-month absence with a knee injury before returning in May.\n\nAlthough he had spells out of the team this season too, he was a reliable performer and joins fellow central defender Luiyi de Lucas in departing the club this month.\n\nA club statement read: “Tom’s family are all back in England and with his contract coming to an end in the summer, the opportunity to return closer to them was one that understandably appealed to the player.”\n\nManager David Martindale added: “I wish Tom nothing but success. His time at Livingston has been hampered by long-term injuries which has been a real shame for both him and the club.\n\n“He is a top, top professional and gives you everything every day and will be a huge miss around the club.\n\n“I can’t speak highly enough of him as a individual and would never have stood in the way of him being able to be closer to his family.”"
