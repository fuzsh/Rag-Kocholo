        "text": "Many of our supporters have long links to Dr Graham’s Homes – not least Peter Cook, who has just joined the DGHUK Board of Trustees after a long and distinguished career in the Foreign Office. Peter first visited the Homes as a two-year-old, developed a lifelong passion for the school and the work it does with our sponsored children, and recently returned there during his final posting in Kolkata. We asked him to tell us more about his DGH story, and why he’s excited to be joining the trustee team.\n\nHow did you first hear about Dr Graham’s Homes?\n\nIt was through my father. He came to India when he was appointed minister of the Church of Scotland kirk in Kolkata called St Andrew’s. It had lots of connections to Scottish people and institutions, and he became a governor of Dr Graham’s Homes – founded by a Church of Scotland missionary. So, my dad visited the Homes pretty regularly because of that. And, luckily for me, he took me with him.\n\nPeter’s mother and father in Kolkata, 1966\n\nDid he know anyone else there at the time?\n\nFunnily enough, there were vacancies for the school chaplain and the farm manager while my father was on the board of DGH. It just so happened that his best friend at university was a Bachelor of Agriculture and Divinity. That person was Reverend John Webster, now the Honorary Vice President of our charity. So, my father was responsible for introducing John to DGH!\n\nPeter and pal Callum, son of Rev John Webster, outside Bell House at DGH\n\nWhat makes the Homes so special?\n\nIt’s really the children who make it special. Just as we did then, we use our fundraising to help children in poverty – from Kolkata, from West Bengal, from all over India – come to this great school and get a fantastic education. Also: the way it cares for the kids. They have this cottage boarding system, where staff members (who are known as “uncles” and “aunties”) look after the children and become like parents to them. There’s a warmth and tenderness to the whole place that makes it really special.\n\nA Founder’s Day parade to the school chapel, late 1960s\n\nWhy did you decide to become a DGHUK trustee?\n\nJust before I retired, I was given one last mission – to stand in as the Deputy High Commissioner in Kolkata for a few months. Going back there flooded my head with memories. So I decided to visit DGH again. And when I came away, I began to think about how I could carry on supporting the Homes when I retired. That I might be able to use some of the connections I built up during my career, to tell them all about the Homes, what it does, and why it needs our support."
