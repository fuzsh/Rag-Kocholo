        "text": "The land on which Hartlepool United’s stadium is located was originally owned by North-Eastern Railway Company who sought to extract limestone from local soil, turning it into a quarry.\n\nLacking the minerals so to speak, the site was sold to West Hartlepool Rugby and Football Club for the construction of a new multi-purpose sports arena.\n\nThe club eagerly began to construct a stadium in celebration of Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee before shortly going bankrupt in 1908.\n\nA company by the name of “The Hartlepools United Football Athletic Company Limited” which later became Hartlepool United as we know it today then leased the land and began developing the professional football team until the disruptions caused by the First and Second World War.\n\nLargely destroyed by the Blitz, the club mounted an claim for compensation for Victoria Park from the German government after the war, but this proved to be unsuccessful, and thus Hartlepool FC erected temporary stands and portability until they could afford proper facilities in the 1990s.\n\nThe record attendance was set at 17,264 in a 3rd round FA tie against Matt Busby’s Manchester United side which saw the Monkey Hangers lose narrowly by 4-3 in one of the club’s legendary matches.\n\nThis record attendance is unlikely to ever be beat in the foreseeable future as expansion plans put forward in June 2012 were rejected by the council, with no signs of a resubmission.\n\nAway fans are housed in The Smith & Graham Stand which was formerly known as The Rink End. With an all-seater capacity of 1,033 the lack of terrace can almost be considered a luxury compared to a lot of other lower league stadiums.\n\nSome fans do however miss stand, and frequently complain of the cold, with the North Sea producing a howling wind even in the most Summerly months, so make sure you bring a jacket or jumper!\n\nRink End Ticket Prices\n\nAdults: £20.00\n\nConcession: £10.00\n\nHartlepool treat the away fans well with a catering outlet inside the away end of the stand selling their supposedly “famous foot-long hotdogs” along with a dedicated bar which can help warm your cockles.\n\nFans are still of course welcome to drink in either The Centenary Suite Bar on Clarence road although high profile matches such as the emerging derby against York City may be an exception to this.\n\nLook out for the club’s mascot, the H’angus Monkey (Presumably “Hang Us Monkey”, after the local legend which is responsible for the club’s nickname of “The Monkey Hangers”.\n\nTwo venues at the ground for a pre-match drink are the Centenary Suite on Clarence Road and The Victoria Lounge located within the Car Park at the stadium.\n\nAs well as selling the expected alcoholic beverages there is also a café which open before the match and offers your typical hot drinks such as teas and coffees.\n\nFor something different, and for those travelling in via train there is the Rat Race Ale House micro pub on the railway station platform which exclusively serves “Real Ale”in a cramped, no-frills environment.\n\nIf this isn’t your thing, The Engineers Social Club opposite the police station on route to the stadium is a much more traditional establishment."
