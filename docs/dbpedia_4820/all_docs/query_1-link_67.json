        "text": "Chelsea vs. Manchester City : 17 August 2024.\n\nWelcome to Chelsea 2024/25. This is my fifty-second season of continuous attendance at Chelsea games and the seventeenth year of these match reports. Last season, I celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of my first-ever Chelsea game and also the first season of attending every single Chelsea match.\n\nFor the most part, it was tough as hell wasn’t it? All those new players, a new coach, new ideas. There was a massive disconnect at times – it came to a vitriolic head at Brentford – but at season end, everything appeared to be moving towards a common goal. We were a form team, the manager was getting the best out of his charges, we had reached a domestic final, we had nailed a UEFA spot, Cole Palmer was king.\n\nAnd then it all fell apart.\n\nPochettino out, Maresca in.\n\nChange, change, change where there should have been stability.\n\nOver the summer, I felt increasingly disengaged from the love of my life as Chelsea’s bizarre recruitment policy kicked in again. It left me doubting my sanity at times.\n\nThe European Championships came and went with dwindling interest from me. It is a worry for me that my relationship with Chelsea Football Club might follow the same pattern as my relationship with England’s national team. I watched some of England’s games, not all. The Euros seemed to be taking place in an odd parallel universe for me this summer.\n\nIn truth, from a football perspective, my mind was elsewhere.\n\nMy non-league team, Frome Town, won promotion to the Southern League Premier South last season, regaining our place at step three of the non-league pyramid, last experienced in 2018/19. As I explained in these reports, the joy of last season and the sense of anticipation for the new season was a true highlight of the past twelve months. With an influx of new opponents and stadia, Frome’s 2024/25 campaign soon had the feel of Chelsea’s 1984/85 season for this football fancier. All those new away trips, all those new places to visit, the thrill of pitting our wits against teams in a higher level, the comparison was easy.\n\nWhen the fixtures for Frome were announced, a few weeks after Chelsea’s, I quickly did some logistical planning. The upshot is that I ought to be able to see nine of Frome Town’s first ten league games of the season.\n\nAnd if I am blunt and honest, I was actually looking forward to the first ten Frome games more than the first ten Chelsea games. Friends at Chelsea often talk about the dwindling connection between the club, the mother ship, and themselves over the past few seasons, but at Frome Town the connection gets stronger with every game.\n\nOver the course of this season, where needed, I will perhaps report on the differing senses of connection and belonging that Chelsea and Frome conjure up.\n\nHowever, season 2024/25 did not begin for me with a pre-season friendly involving Frome Town. It began at a stadium in Laranjeiras in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nAfter my incredible football-centered trip to Buenos Aires in February 2020, I have been mulling over another trip to South America for a while. I almost pushed the button on a trip to Rio de Janeiro last summer but the lingering threat of COVID and a few other issues put me off. In the summer of 2025, when I turn sixty, I am hoping to travel to the Eastern US for the first phase of the FIFA World Club Championships, so I quickly decided that I would look keenly at getting to Rio this summer. We never know how long we have left. It was time to get going.\n\nThe fixtures for the Brazilan Serie A were announced in March and I quickly focussed on the weekend of Saturday 6 July. Not only was this my birthday, but the fixture list had Fluminense playing Athletico Paranaense at the magnificent Maracana stadium on that date. Two things to mention here. It was widely rumoured that Thiago Silva would be returning to his first love of Fluminense in the summer and this sent me dizzy. Also, ever since seeing Roberto Rivelino in the maroon, green and white stripes of the Flumimense shirt in the mid-‘seventies, I have been in love with that kit, if not the team itself.\n\nIn early March, I decided to go for it. I sorted direct flights from Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro and eight nights in a three-star hotel a block from Copacabana Beach. There would be maybe three games in Rio, matching my three in Buenos Aires. It was all systems go.\n\nAnd then nature intervened. The floods in Brazil forced a re-arrangement of fixtures and my dream date with Fluminense, and maybe Thiago Silva, was hit. Instead, it was looking like Vasco de Gama vs. Fortaleza on the Wednesday, Flamengo vs. Cuiba on my birthday and Botafogo vs. Atletico Mineiro on the Sunday. I’ll admit it; I was devastated that there would be no Fluminense game.\n\nI waited for Saturday 29 June for take-off. Of course, Thiago Silva did indeed sign for Fluminense and there was talk of his first game being played in July. My annoyance in missing him play in Rio was palpable, yet I was sure that I was still going to have a superb trip. In the ten days before departure, I contacted Chelsea Football Club about sending Fluminense, temporarily, the huge Thiago Silva crowd-surfer flag that the “We Are The Shed” team created, and which marked his last ever game for us. One of the “We Are The Shed” folk is a friend and for a while it seemed that this idea was a runner. Alas, communication from Chelsea predictably dried up and the Thiago Silva flag has stayed in the bowels of Stamford Bridge. Sigh.\n\nI landed at Rio’s Antonio Carlos Jobim International Airport at 5.30am on Sunday 30 June.\n\nI hoped that I would arrive at my hotel by 7am and I soon caught a cab that took me through a surprisingly grey and rainy city centre. The cab driver pointed out the Maracana to our right, a thin sliver of white amongst the grey buildings. My pulse rate quickened. After a twenty-five-minute journey, I walked into my hotel at 6.59am and so here’s my first “I work in logistics” comment of the new season. I wolfed down a filling breakfast and trotted out onto the nearby Copacabana Beach to get my bearings and to get those first day vibes. The weather was still disappointing but I was overjoyed to be setting foot on such a famous location.\n\nMy first football-related task of the holiday involved getting an Uber to take me a few miles north to the well-heeled Laranjeiras district of Rio. Here, the driver deposited me right outside Manoel Schwartz Stadium. This historic ground, dating from 1914 was originally Brazil’s national stadium, and home of Fluminense, founded in 1902, who played here until decamping to the Maracana upon its construction in 1950.\n\nI liked it that I would be visiting the national team’s first three stadia in Rio – Laranjeiras, Vasco da Gama’s Estadio Centenario and Maracana – in chronological order during my stay.\n\nThe stadium soon captivated my heart and soul and, I think, was the absolute highlight of my stay in Rio. On that grey Sunday afternoon, I wandered in and out of its stands, and I truly fell in love with the place. There is an extra reason for this.\n\nWe need to go back to the summer of 1929.\n\nFrom 29 May to 7 July of that year, Chelsea Football Club played a ridiculous sixteen games in South America; ten in Argentina, four in Brazil and two in Uruguay. This tour is of significance for two major reasons. Firstly, it represents Chelsea’s longest-ever pre-season tour of any nature. Secondly, no British team has toured South America since.\n\nI had to smile when I heard that the current Fluminense president Mario Bittencourt say that he was so impressed with the way that Chelsea conducted themselves in the Thiago Silva transfer that he is now a Chelsea fan and hoped to schedule a friendly between the two teams at the Maracana at some stage during Silva’s contract.\n\nThis might well be silly lip-service, but you never know. Chelsea at the Maracana? Lovely. If I couldn’t see Fluminense on this trip, maybe on another.\n\nI stayed around ninety minutes, fittingly enough, at Fluminense’s first stadium and I enjoyed every second. The terraces are still intact and the main stand is a lovely structure. I was able to fully immerse myself in my visions of what it must have been like to see a game here. And especially a game that took place on Sunday 30 June 1929, exactly ninety-five years ago to the day.\n\nAll those years ago, Chelsea played a Rio de Janeiro XI at Estadio Laranjeiras. The game ended 1-1. Included in the Chelsea team were stalwarts such as Sam Millington, George Smith, Sid Bishop, Jack Townrow and Tommy Law.\n\nI clambered up into the main stand, and took photos of the beautiful stadium. It reminded me a little of the fabled Stadio Filadelfia in Turin. I loved the floodlight pylons in the shape of Christ the Redeemer and I loved the tiled viewing platform, no doubt where the VIPs of the day would watch in luxurious chairs.\n\nDown at pitch side, I spoke to one of the ground staff – a Flamengo fan, boo! – and when I told him about only arriving in Rio that day, and the Chelsea game in 1929, he walked me onto the pitch. There was a frisson of excitement as he told me to look over the goalmouth to my right, to the west. He pointed out the huge statue of Christ the Redeemer atop the Corcovado mountain. It would be the first time that I had seen the famous statue on the trip.\n\nMy heart exploded.\n\nThis was a genuine and real “Welcome to Rio” moment.\n\nAt this stage, I had not realised that I was visiting Laranjeiras on the exact anniversary of the game in 1929. If I had been told this at that exact moment of time, I would have probably feinted.\n\nThe stadium is still used for training games, and the occasional match involving some of Fluminense’s lesser teams. There is a small club shop, and I bought a few items.\n\nThat night I watched Flamengo play against Cruzeiro in a bar on Copacabana. David Luiz was playing for the home team and I felt surprisingly protective towards him. I liked him at Chelsea and I wanted to see him do well. Later, I watched a Copa America game between Venezuela and Jamaica in another bar and got talking to people from Chile and Venezuela. The common language was football. It had been an amazing first day.\n\nThe second day was spent touring the city in a mini bus with other tourists and it enabled me to get to grips with the scale and intensity of the city. Rio is ridiculously dramatic. It is a vibrant, sweaty and sultry city. Alas visibility was poor atop Corcovado and Sugar Loaf. There was a fleeting ten-minute stop outside Maracana, but I knew I would be back on the Saturday. That night I watched a game in another bar between Palmeiras and Corinthians, our two World Club Cup opponents in 2012 and 2021, er 2022.\n\nThe third day, the Tuesday, was spent on Copacabana, the weather now brighter, and I was so happy. Cristo Redentor looked magnificent against a deep blue sky above the hotels of the beach. I met up with a local guy that I had been put into contact with; Rudson would be my ticket broker for the week. He had texted me during my wander along the beach to inform me that, miraculously, there would be an extra Fluminense game squeezed into the schedule on Thursday. I was so happy. I would get to see them play. It amazed me that the fixture change had taken place only three days out. And we complain in England.\n\nSo, a change of plan. I binned the game at Vasco da Gama – in a rough area, and an expensive ticket, plus an odd pre-registration process involving QR codes and facial recognition – as I would now be going to Maracana twice.\n\nI walked west to Ipanema, and ended up in Garota Café, a super-cool establishment once frequented by Antonio Carlos Jobim – yes him again – and Vinicius de Moraes who penned the bossa nova gem “The Girl From Ipanema” in 1964. I shared a photo on Facebook and there would be an online conversation later between a Chelsea fan – Ian – and myself about the bossa nova revival in the summer of 1984 in the UK involving Everything But The Girl and Sade. We talked about how amazing that summer was for us Chelsea supporters.\n\nAs I mentioned in the last blog of 2023/24, I felt a comparison between the summers of 1984 and 2024, but for slightly different reasons.\n\n“I am really looking forward to the release date of the Frome Town fixtures for next season. I am likening it to the summer of 1984 when I daydreamed of Chelsea’s away days back in the First Division for the first time in five years. Dear reader; if you weren’t around forty years ago, you will simply have no idea of the excitement of those times.”\n\nMore of 1984 later.\n\nI had walked four miles from Copacabana to Ipanema and took a cab back to the hotel.\n\nHowever, events took a dark turn that evening. Unfortunately, I became victim to what I would term “Pele Belly” and was more-or-less confined to my hotel room for two days. I was so worried that I would not be able to chance going to any games. And I was horrified to think what the return eleven-hour flight to London might entail.\n\nFackinao.\n\nI slept for long periods and raided the fridge for snacks. Thankfully I bought some “Imosec” and things slightly improved. I felt so tired though. On the Thursday, Rudson met me in my hotel lobby – despite living way north of the city, his office is on Copacabana – and gave me my Fluminense ticket. It cost around £30. Gingerly, I caught an Uber to Maracana. Despite still feeling delicate and tired, I absolutely came to life on that cab ride. The Uber driver was a Fluminense fan too.\n\nIn my travels around the city, just like I had done in Buenos Aires, I asked the locals if they were Flamengo or Fluminense. In Buenos Aires, it was roughly 60% Boca and 40% River. In Rio, it was weighted far more steeply to one side. It was easily 95% Flamengo, 5% Fluminense. I knew Flamengo were enjoyed the larger support base, but the scale shocked me. Not to worry, it made me dig in and like Fluminense more.\n\nThose colours!\n\nI was dropped off to the north-west of the stadium, unlike on Monday when our visit had taken place by the statue of the Brazil World Cup winning captain Hilderaldo Bellini at the south-east side. I walked into the crazy hubbub of a Brazilian match day.\n\nStreet vendors, sizzling steaks, hot dogs on skewers, beer, soft drinks, water, flags, colours, supporters. Replica shirts of every design possible. The Flu fans are based at the southern end and Maracana’s only street side bar is just outside. I bought a Heineken from a street vendor who originally wanted to charge me 50 reais, but I paid 20; just over £3.\n\nMy seat was along the side, opposite the tunnel, and I entered the stadium. I chanced a burger and fries in the airy concourse.\n\nThen, I was in.\n\nMaracana opened up before me. Those who know me know my love for stadia, and here was one of the very best.\n\nGrowing up in the ‘seventies, the beasts of world football were Wembley, Hampden and Maracana. For me to be able to finally step inside the Maracana Stadium filled me with great joy. Back in the days when it held 150,000 or more – the record is a bone-chilling 199,854, the 1950 World Cup, Brazil vs. Uruguay, Brazil still weeps – its vastness seemed comprehendible. When it was revamped and modernised with seats for the 2014 World Cup, the two tiers became one in reality and its visual appeal seemed to diminish. Simply, it didn’t look so huge. Prior to my visit this year, I hoped that its vastness – it is still the same structure after all – would still wow me.\n\nIt did.\n\nI had a nice seat, not far from the half-way line. Alas, not only was Thiago Silva not playing, neither was Marcelo, the former Real Madrid left-back; a shame.\n\nFluminense’s opponents were Internacional from Porto Alegre.\n\nIt was an 8pm kick-off.\n\nThe home team, despite winning the Copa Libertadores against Boca Juniors in 2023, had enjoyed a terrible start to the season. After thirteen games, Flu were stranded at the bottom of the national league, while the hated Flamengo were top. The stands slowly filled, but only to a gate of 40,000. Maracana now holds 73,139. The northern end was completely empty apart from around 2,500 away fans in a single section. The game ended 1-1 with the visitors scoring via Igor Gomes on forty minutes but the home team equalising with a brilliant long-range effort from Palo Henrique Ganso four minutes into first-half stoppage time. In truth, it wasn’t a great game. The away team dominated the early spells and Fluminense looked a poor team. Their supporters seemed a tortured lot. There were more shrieks of anguish than yelps of joy.\n\nAs with the fans in Argentina, there were melodic songs rather than vitriolic and barked chants that the European supporters favour. There were no pointed arms, no staccato clapping, no rapid vocal jousting. The songs from the stands, with occasional flag-waving, were accompanied by rolling arm movements, as in Buenos Aires, and it reminded me of Max Bygraves and his “I wanna tell you a story” arm shrugs. All very floppy. Not aggressive at all.\n\nI caught a cab – a Fiat, there are tons of Fiats in Rio – back to the hotel and slept well that night.\n\nFriday was a quiet day. I visited a local churrascaria steakhouse in the evening and then the Lapa area of the city centre where the bars and nightclubs are centered. I was still 58, but in the UK I was 59. I sank a few beers to celebrate, but if I was honest I still wasn’t 100% and returned home early.\n\nSaturday, my birthday, and a day of contrasts. I stayed in the hotel, again not wanting to chance it, but then booked an Uber to take me to the Flamengo vs. Cuiba game which kicked-off at 8pm. What I found nice about travelling anywhere in Rio was that I was invariably driven past the white walls of Laranjeiras stadium, as if the city was telling me “it all started here, remember.”\n\nLater on, nearing Maracana, the city’s hills spotted with lights, the Uber driver played two Sade songs. This was magical. Truly magical. I instantly remembered the conversation that I had with Ian on the Tuesday. I leaned forward.\n\n“Sade? Sade Adu?”\n\nThe driver smiled. I think she was amazed.\n\n“Sade. Yes.”\n\nIt was one of those gorgeous moments where life does not get any better.\n\nSade. The summer of 1984. Rio de Janeiro. The home of bossa nova. The Maracana. Flamengo. The summer of 2024. My birthday.\n\nMusic. Football. Travel.\n\nBliss.\n\nI was deposited in exactly the same spot as on Thursday, but immediately the mood seemed different. More noise. More supporters. More banners. It seemed that Flamengo really were the city’s team. I felt a little conflicted.\n\nFlu over Fla for me, though.\n\nI had paid a little more for my ticket – £40 – but was rewarded with a sensational view high on the main stand side. I took a lift up to the top level and the vast bowl of the Maracana took my breath away. I bought myself a beer – alcohol is allowed in the stands in Brazil – and raised a toast to myself.\n\n“Happy birthday young’un.”\n\nI really loved this game. It was a lot more competitive, and the noise was more constant, and actually quite breath-taking. Cuiba, from the city of the same name, only had a few hundred fans for this match and I didn’t even try to hear them. Surprisingly, Cuiba scored early on when Derek Lacerda waltzed through and struck a shot into the massive Maracana goals. For aficionados of goals, goal frames, stanchions and goalposts, these are beauties.\n\n“Deep sag.”\n\nIt was a decent game. My view of it made it. Maracana, dear reader, is vast.\n\nAt half-time, I trotted out to the balcony that overlooked the city. I took a photo of a section of the Maracana roof support, pocked and cracked through time, and contrasted it with the lights shining on a nearby hill. Rio is surrounded by huge rising pillars of black rock. And here I was inside the city’s mammoth concrete cathedral.\n\n“Diamond life, lover boy.\n\nWe move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy.\n\nCity lights and business nights.\n\nWhen you require streetcar desire for higher heights.”\n\nThe second-half began, and the intensity rose and fell. All eyes were on David Luiz. It was so good to see him play again. I last saw him play for Chelsea at the away friendly against St. Patrick’s Athletic in Dublin in 2019. The Fla – or ‘Mengo, take your pick – support never waned and were rewarded when Pedro tucked in an Ayrton cross on the hour. One through-ball from David Luiz will stay in my mind for a while. He was arguably their best player. It ended 1-1. The gate was 54,000. I was expecting more.\n\nThere was one more thrill to come.\n\nWhenever I saw photos of Maracana as a child and in later years, I was always mesmerized by its exit ramps, and I tried to imagine how many millions of carioca – Rio’s inhabitants – had descended those slopes over the years. After the game, I walked them too.\n\nThe whole night had been a wonderful birthday present to myself.\n\nOn the next day, I revisited Corcovado and took in the magnificence of the view of the city underneath the open arms of Cristo Redentor.\n\nAnother magical memory.\n\nTo complete the 1984 vibe, Everything But The Girl released a song in 1999 called “Corcovado” and it was in my mind all day long.\n\n“Um cantinho e um vilao. Este amor, uma cancao.\n\nPra fazer feliz a quem se ama.”\n\nFor my final game of Brazil 2024, Rudson had booked me a driver to take me out of the Zonal Sud comfort zone and into the central part of the city. Vincius called for me at 6pm for the 8.30pm start. We made our way out, not only past Laranjeiras, but Maracana too.\n\nThere are four Serie A teams in Rio; Fluminense, Flamengo, Vasco da Gama and Botofogo. Interestingly, all originated in the affluent Zonal Sud area, some originally as rowing clubs. Botafoga’s full title is Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas. Botafogo now play at Estadio Nilton Santos – along with Garricha and Jairzinho, its favourite son – which was built for the Olympics of 2016. It’s in a pretty shady area. I was grateful that Vincius was with me. He parked up in a grimy side-street and walked me to the modern stadium.\n\n“After you wait here” and he pointed to a statue of Garrincha.\n\nBotafogo play in black and white stripes – like Juventus, an old flame – and I must admit I fell in love with an old Botafogo Kappa black jersey.\n\nVery Juventus 1990.\n\nThere was time to relax and take in the local environs. Again, lots of street vendors, lots of replica shirts, lots of hustle and bustle. Both Botafogo and Vasco advertise themselves as the real clubs of Rio. Think Everton over Liverpool. Fluminense once had a tainted history of elitism and racism but thankfully that has virtually disappeared now. There are smaller clubs elsewhere in Rio. But, still, nowhere near as many pro clubs as Buenos Aires, the city that I constantly felt myself comparing Rio against during my stay.\n\nI wolfed down another Heineken at a street side bar. Unfortunately, hardly anybody speaks English in Rio so although I was bursting to talk to the locals, I knew it was a futile wish. At the turnstiles, a camera took my photo as I entered. And we complain in England.\n\nThe stadium is a little odd. With a running track, the spectators are a long way from the pitch. One end was completely empty. In fact, both ends are single story but look like they can have extensions if required. The noisy section of home fans was therefore in the two tiers opposite the main stand where I sat. To my right were around 2,000 away fans of Atletico Mineiro, who now boasted Hulk in their ranks, who I saw play at Stamford Bridge for Porto. He is now thirty-eight.\n\nUnlike at the Maracana, there was a full tifo display here, with vertical strips, a huge horizontal banner, flares and smoke. It was mightily impressive. The home team scored after just thirteen minutes via Luiz Henriques. Hulk’s far from incredible team mate Igor Rabello was sent off on twenty-five minutes, and the home team totally dominated the game. Two late goals from Cuiabano and Jefferson Savarino gave Botafogo a deserved 3-0 win in front of 23,000. I knew that Rudson would be happy.\n\n“I am a humble man. I like Botafogo.”\n\nSoon back at my hotel, I decided on a nightcap and popped over the road for a couple of beers in a small bar. Just like on night one, I lucked-out with some drinking companions. I chatted to a group of kit-wearing Botafogo supporters, a few of whom spoke English – thank heavens – and I had a great final hour of my final match day. They had been sat above me in the upper tier of the west stand. The youngest liked Chelsea – and Barcelona, ugh – and we spoke about all sorts. The group were all from Brasilia and one of them is the owner of a lower league team, FC Capital. It was a cracking end to my stay in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nNine days, eight nights, three stadia, three games, a few Chelsea moments, a truly unforgettable holiday. Rio truly loves its football. I have not stayed in a city where so many locals wear football shirts as a matter of course, going about their usual tasks. There were Flamengo shirts everywhere. Many wore the famous yellow of Brazil too. In Rio, it remains a working class sport. I hope to return one day.\n\n“A corner and a guitar.\n\nThis love, a song.\n\nTo make those you love happy.”\n\nThe rest of my summer was spent trying to avoid most of the rumours about the comings and goings at Chelsea Football Club; my game plan was to try to get to game one, Manchester City at home, and then make my mind up about what I saw with my very own eyes.\n\nInstead, I spent my time following Frome Town as their – “our”? – pre-season developed and merged seamlessly into the first few games in the Southern League Premier South. My travels took me to friendlies at Clevedon Town, Shepton Mallet and Westbury United, with home friendlies against Yeovil Town, Bath City and Swansea City U21s. There was an exceptional opening game in the league at fancied Gosport Borough – the last time I saw Frome play there in 2018, we lost 0-7 after ignominiously starting with only ten players – where a late Curtis Jemmet-Hutson goal gave us a wonderful 1-0 win. Frome were then brought down to Earth with two home defeats against Merthyr Tydfil – 0-2 – and Bracknell Town – 1-2 – in the week leading up to Chelsea’s league opener.\n\nBefore the game at Stamford Bridge, I had a walking tour of SW6. I walked from a new parking spot on Star Road to Stamford Bridge, then out to the Bedford Arms on Dawes Road to see Alan and Gary, then down the Fulham Road and Fulham High Street to see the usual suspects in The Eight Bells. It was a yomp of some three miles.\n\nThe Eight Bells doesn’t change. I was there from 2pm to 3.30pm, and although it was packed with Chelsea supporters – maybe sixty inside, maybe thirty outside – I only saw two Chelsea shirts. Both were worn by the younger element; excusable.\n\nI met up with Parky and PD, Salisbury Steve, the Kent lot, and Deano called in too. He is off to Chile in November and I vowed to contact the Chilean family I met in Rio. A barmaid had travelled in South America with two friends for four months since the last time I saw her and there was a heady South American feel to the pre-match.\n\n“Sixteen games in 1929. And we complain about pre-season tours in 2024.”\n\nWe caught a tube up to Stamford Bridge. Chelsea have adopted the “CFC – LDN” tagline for this season and there is signage everywhere in and around the stadium. The shite new kit is heavily paraded on every spare inch of Stamford Bridge.\n\nSet aside under a section of the old Shed Wall is a bizarre display called “The Garden Of Eden”, some Xbox or Playstation nonsense involving Eden Hazard, geared towards the EA Sports generation that seems to account for a huge proportion of our global fan base these days. The display could easily have been in honour of Jeff Koons.\n\nThe first programme of the new year had a striking cover. It consisted of an “upshot” from the middle of a players’ huddle. It reminded me of the famous scene from Stanley Kramer’s “It’s A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World” when the protagonists realised that they were at last “under a big dubya” and they peer over the hidden treasure.\n\nI am not so sure what treasure we will find at Chelsea this year, but it will be a mad world for sure.\n\nInside, Stamford Bridge looked the same, but as kick-off approached, there were a couple of “I Hate Modern Football” moments. For a while now, in addition to the Dug Out Club nonsense, we have been treated to the sight of around twenty well-heeled individuals watching the Chelsea players go through their pre-match drills from the West Stand touchline. It looks ridiculous. And God knows how much they pay for the privilege. In close proximity to all of this baloney, a young DJ was set up to spin some discs at a booth and my eyes rolled to the heavens.\n\nIn that crucial thirty minutes before kick-off, it would be nice to be able to sing our own songs, adding to the atmosphere nicely – just like we used to do decades ago – rather than be voyeurs to some dance music being pumped out to disinterested spectators.\n\nWhen I showed a photo of this ridiculous scene to a Brentford fan at work, he commented “it looks like a wedding.”\n\nWomen in posh frocks, blokes in tailored shirts and trousers, children at play, a DJ booth, the green grass below. It could easily be a scene from a summer wedding.\n\nThat ain’t football.\n\nI could hear the cariocas in Rio laughing at us from six thousand miles away.\n\nI shook hands with Charlie and Alan who sit alongside us. Sadly, Charlie’s father and Alan’s brother Gary passed away on 29 May after a battle with motor neurone disease. Gary’s last match at Stamford Bridge was the last game of 2022/23. Along with their father Joe, Alan and Gary had been sitting alongside us since 1997. Glenn and I attended Gary’s funeral in Crawley at the end of June. He will be missed.\n\nRIP Gary Buchmann.\n\nAs 4.30pm approached, another new-fangled addition at Stamford Bridge. In addition to flames alongside the East Stand, there were fireworks and blue fumes from atop the East Stand.\n\nAs Alan said “we will get banned for bringing in flares, but it’s OK for the club to fill the air with blue smoke.”\n\nThe teams entered the pitch.\n\nUs?\n\nSanchez\n\nGusto – Colwill – Fofana – Cucarella\n\nCaicedo – Lavia\n\nEnzo\n\nPlamer – Jackson – Nkunku\n\nOr something like that.\n\nEven from afar, our new kit looks shite. Maybe I will write more about it later.\n\nWe started well with a fair amount of the ball. I immediately sensed that the battle between Marc Cucarella and Jeremy Doku was going to be entertaining.\n\nDecent noise too. The usual songs.\n\nEnzo was ahead of Lavia and Caicedo. The Argentinian began well.\n\nThen calamity, Doku swapped sides and on eighteen minutes, he gained a yard of space and sent in a low ball into the box. It evaded our defenders, Bernardo Silva touched it on, and Erling Haaland fought off a late challenge from Cucarella to stab home.\n\nHere we go.\n\nChelsea 0 City 1.\n\nBollocks.\n\nNothing about the goal looked dodgy, but VAR was called into action. The goal stood, no surprises.\n\nCity had three thousand in the far corner and they were chirping away as you would expect.\n\nJust after, the Conor Gallagher song, to be expected really. I didn’t join in. I was already pissed off with our transfer policy and the new season wasn’t even half-an-hour old yet.\n\nCity went close again via Kevin de Bruyne, but Chelsea were having a share of the play. The ball was played in as Enzo made a Lampard-esque run into the box. He was clattered but no decision.\n\nAt the other end, a shot from Doku was deflected and Sanchez did ever so well to tip the ball over.\n\nI liked the look of Romeo Lavia, breaking up play and physically strong.\n\nA nice move involving Cole Palmer and Christopher Nkunku set up Nicolas Jackson. A lay-off to Enzo, but his shot was blocked.\n\nCity were finding angles to play through us, and we had to rely on Sanchez to spread his legs wide to block a shot.\n\nAt last some noise.\n\nCAM ON CHOWLSEA – CAM ON CHOWLSEA – CAM ON CHOWLSEA – CAM ON CHOWLSEA.\n\n“Come on lads, hit the runners early.”\n\nJust before half-time, a goal from Jackson after Ederson spilled a Palmer effort, but I had soon spotted the linesman’s flag.\n\nVAR…no goal.\n\nThe spectators watching on, quite bewildered.\n\nThere was a lovely through ball by Jackson in to Nkunku but he did not do himself justice.\n\nBoos at half-time, but surely for Anthony Taylor rather than for our performance. I was relatively happy at the break, though. We had played better than I had expected. This was always going to be the toughest of tasks. Lavia had been excellent.\n\nSoon into the second period, Enzo and Jackson became entangled in front of the City goal just as Jackson was about to strike and the Chelsea fans’ frustrations rose.\n\nSanchez saved well from Haaland at the other end.\n\nWe lost our way a little as the second-half progressed.\n\nWe became quiet, City too.\n\n58 minutes : Pedro Neto for Nkunku.\n\nHe almost got on the end of a chance, close in, with his very first touch, after a fine ball from Palmer to Enzo, whose cross almost reached the substitute.\n\n“CAREFREE – WHEREVER YOU MAY BE.”\n\nA nice rumble of noise again.\n\nNeto then beat his man and sent over a fine cross that Enzo headed on. The move was kept alive, the ball found Jackson whose acrobatic stab at goal was well saved by Ederson.\n\n67 minutes : Marc Guiu for Jackson and Keirnan Dewsbury-Hall for Romeo Lavia.\n\n80 minutes : Renato Vega for Cucarella.\n\nOn eighty-four minutes, Mateo Kovacic, who had grown into being the game’s most impressive player, picked up a loose ball from Wesley Fofana and ran with pace through the middle of our pitch. As he aimed at goal, I uttered the immortal “Fuck off Kovacic” and he duly swept a strike past Sanchez.\n\nBollocks.\n\nThe bloke sitting between PD and Alan, who had not sung a single note of support for the team all game, got up and fucked off out, the City fans did a Poznan and that was that.\n\nChelsea 0 City 2.\n\nDid anybody, anywhere, really expect anything different?\n\nNext up, Servette Geneva in the Europa Conference on Thursday.\n\nSee you there.\n\nEstádio Manoel Schwartz, Laranjeiras.\n\nFluminense vs. Internacional, Maracana.\n\nFlamengo vs. Cuiabá, Maracana.\n\nBotafogo vs. Atlético Mineiro, Estádio Olímpico Nilton Santos.\n\nChelsea vs. Manchester City, Stamford Bridge.\n\nChelsea vs. Leeds United : 28 February 2024.\n\nAfter the defeat at Wembley on Sunday, we reconvened down at “The Eight Bells” in deepest Fulham – via a pint at “The Sawyers Arms” at Paddington – and although our spirits were low, a decent evening ensued. We spent three hours or so in the company of Johnny Twelve from California and also Rob and Karl from Hersham. Suffice to say, the drinks flowed and the smiles returned. However, on waking in the Premier Inn opposite the pub the next morning, I could not stifle a brief “I hate football” from flitting into my head.\n\nBut these were a busy few days for Chelsea Football Club.\n\nNext up was our first FA Cup tie against Leeds United since the 1970 FA Cup Final and subsequent replay. It was a busy time for me too. As Monday passed and as I toiled over the Wembley blog late into Tuesday, I managed to “let go” of the result on Sunday and I tried my best to look forward to the game on Wednesday.\n\nI was in early at work on the day of the game, but I could not get something out of my head. Back in 1986, Chelsea exited both domestic cups within the space of four days; we lost at home to Liverpool in the FA Cup on Sunday 26 January and at home to QPR on Wednesday 29 January. I sincerely hoped that there would be no repeat thirty-eight years later.\n\nPD and Parky had enjoyed a pub lunch and PD had then picked-up Ron Harris at 1.45pm. At just after 2pm, in the car park of “The Milk Churn” pub in Melksham, I stood with Ron as PD took a photo of the two of us. It seemed right that on the occasion of the first Chelsea vs. Leeds United FA Cup game in fifty-four years, we should mark the start of the drive to Chelsea in this manner.\n\nAs I pulled out of the car park, I realised once again how absolutely lucky I am to be able to drive our captain from those glory years up to Stamford Bridge.\n\n1970, eh?\n\nWhile Ron was busy leading the team to those two classic games, I was just starting out on a football life of my own.\n\nI began my school days at the age of for years and nine months, probably just before the Wembley Cup Final on Saturday 11 April. In the ensuing few months, I would choose Chelsea as my team, although the exact reason or reasons are not crystal clear. In my memory, it’s down to a list of a few motives. It has to be said that until school, my parents told me that I wasn’t particularly interested in football.\n\nMaybe I liked the name “Chelsea”. Maybe, after the replay at Old Trafford on 29 April, some school pals told me that “Chelsea had won the cup” (there is no recollection at all of me watching it, sadly) or maybe I had worked out that Chelsea were a good team. In a nutshell, Chelsea were the talk of the town, or at least the school playground, in the April and May of 1970 and I became a fan.\n\nI’ve had quite a journey, eh?\n\nAnd here I was, aged fifty-eight and seven months, driving the captain of that team to a game against Leeds United so many years later.\n\nAs I approached London, I could not resist asking Ron a question.\n\n“Ron. Of the two games at Wembley and Old Trafford in 1970, what is your one stand out memory?”\n\n“After the first game, Dave Sexton told me that I would swap positions with Webby, who had been given the biggest run-around I had ever seen by Eddie Gray, and in the second-game he never got a kick.”\n\nThe response did not surprise me at all. It is the classic moment from both games aside from the goals.\n\nThe 1970 FA Cup Final is so iconic, so fantastic, and so important to the history of the competition and to Chelsea Football Club alike. But it is, undoubtedly, so important for me too, although I did not even watch the games at the time.\n\nIt was a game-changer.\n\nI knew that Chelsea were issuing a programme for the game that would feature a cover photograph of the jubilant Chelsea players at Old Trafford, with Chopper holding the trophy alongside a few team mates, and I liked that. Sometimes Chelsea get it right.\n\nAs time moves on, though, it has been sad to see so many players from both teams pass away over the years. Of the twenty-two starters at Old Trafford, only ten remain.\n\nChelsea.\n\nPeter Bonetti : 20 April 2020, aged 78.\n\nRon Harris – aged 79\n\nEddie McCreadie – aged 83.\n\nJohn Hollins : 14 June 2023, aged 76.\n\nJohn Dempsey – aged 77.\n\nDavid Webb – aged 77.\n\nTommy Baldwin : 22 January 2024, aged 78.\n\nCharlie Cooke – aged 81.\n\nPeter Osgood : 1 March 2006, aged 59.\n\nIan Hutchinson : 19 September 2002, aged 54.\n\nPeter Houseman : 20 March 1977, aged 31.\n\nLeeds United.\n\nDavid Harvey – aged 76.\n\nPaul Madeley : 23 July 2018, aged 73.\n\nTerry Cooper : 31 July 2021, aged 77.\n\nBilly Bremner : 7 December 1997, aged 54.\n\nJack Charlton : 10 July 2020, aged 85.\n\nNorman Hunter : 20 April 2020, aged 76.\n\nPeter Lorimer : 20 March 2021, aged 74.\n\nAlan Clarke – aged 77.\n\nMick Jones – aged 78.\n\nJohnny Giles – aged 83.\n\nEddie Gray – aged 76.\n\nI dropped off PD and Parky at the bottom of the North End Road and I dropped off Ron outside the main gates. As I slowly retraced my steps back to my usual parking place, police sirens were wailing.\n\nLeeds were in town.\n\nAt about 5.15pm, I popped into an Italian restaurant on the Lillee Road – “Pizza@Home” – for the first time and I enjoyed some lovely food. I then dipped into “Café Ole” at the bottom of the North End Road once more for a large cappuccino. It was all about staying out of the rain for as long as I could. Funnily enough, there was a bundle of friends at “Café Ole” – Pete, Liz, Mark, Scott, Paul, Gerry, Tom, Leigh, Darren – probably all with the same need to keep dry.\n\nI had a nice talk with Tom, the first one for ages.\n\nI was inside Stamford Bridge at about 7pm. PD told me that, should we beat Leeds, we would play host to Leicester City in the Quarter-Finals.\n\nMixed blessings.\n\nI was angling for a dream draw of Newcastle United at home on Saturday 16 March as it would mark the fiftieth anniversary of my very first game against the same opposition. But I was relatively happy with a home draw. I hoped that the game would be played on the Saturday though. Outside of a home draw, we all wanted Coventry City. Ah well, it was not to be.\n\nPD ran through the team.\n\n“We’re playing with three wingers. Sterling, Madueke, Mudryk.”\n\nI had swapped out with Parky to allow him a seat next to PD in The Sleepy Hollow. There were around six-thousand noisy Leeds fans in The Shed, their largest away following at Stamford Bridge in over fifty-years, maybe ever.\n\nAt about 7.15pm, Ron Harris was interviewed pitch side with club historian Rick Glanvil as they spoke about the 1970 FA Cup Final and its place in football folklore. Amazingly, the replay was watched by 28.49 million people. It is at number six in the list of the highest-ever TV audiences in the UK, alongside royal weddings, royal funerals and England games. Apart from the “Matthews Final” of 1953, it is probably the most famous FA Cup Final of them all.\n\nThe usual dimming of lights and fireworks, but then the shock of Leeds in an all pink kit, albeit one with a shirt that resembled a polyester outfit from the ‘seventies that Mrs. Slocombe might wear at a Grace Brothers night out.\n\nHideous.\n\nTime to sort the team out. I had a look.\n\nSanchez\n\nGusto – Disasi – Chalobah – Gilchrist\n\nCaicedo – Enzo\n\nMadueke – Mudryk – Sterling\n\nJackson\n\nI had forgotten that Ethan Ampadu was now full-time at Leeds United after three relegations on loan to Sheffield United, Venezia and Spezia. Eddie Gray’s great-nephew Archie was playing for the visitors. He is the son of Andy Gray, who I remember at Leeds, and the grandson of Frank Gray who I also remember at Leeds.\n\nConclusion : I am getting old.\n\nThe visitors in The Shed noisily shouted “We are Leeds, we are Leeds, we are Leeds” and Enzo kicked the ball back to a team mate.\n\nWe were off.\n\nThe pink visitors attacked us in the Matthew Harding. Mudryk was in the “Number 10” slot, the space recently occupied by Cole Palmer. We began on top.\n\nI noted many empty seats during the first few minutes but most filled. There were, however a few hundred unused seats in the top corners of Westview all game.\n\nI was just getting settled, making a mental note of all the songs that the visitors were singing at us, when a lumped ball from deep released Daniel James who had lost the back-tracking Alfie Gilchrist. The Leeds player lobbed the ball just wide of the goal frame.\n\nFrom the goal-kick following this miss, a typical Chelsea disaster of 2023/24 occurred right in front of me. Sanchez played the ball to Axel Disasi who he chose not to clear his lines, no doubt under instruction from the management. He played the ball into the feet of Moises Caicedo, even though there were three opponents close by. Possession was lost, Jaidon Anthony pushed the ball square to Mateo Joseph who slammed the ball past Robert Sanchez.\n\nThe away hordes roared.\n\nAfter just eight minutes we were one-nil down.\n\nThe away end went through a few favourites.\n\n“Should I be Chelsea, should I be Leeds, here’s what she said to me.”\n\n“Let’s go fucking mental, let’s go fucking mental.”\n\n“Marching on together.”\n\nWe tried to retaliate immediately, with Sterling setting up Enzo but his low effort flew past Ilian Meslier’s post.\n\nOn fifteen minutes, we constructed a really fine move down the right, with a smattering of one-touch passes. Jackson back to Disasi, to Gusto, inside to Jackson, to Madueke, to Caicedo and a killer pass to Jackson, who carefully guided the ball home.\n\nLovely goal.\n\nIt was back to 1-1.\n\nAnother shot from Enzo, but easily stopped by Meslier.\n\n“Come on Chelsea, Come on Chelsea. Come on Chelsea. Come on Chelsea.”\n\nA slashed effort from an angle by Madueke that only hit the side-netting. Another shot from Madueke was so high and wide that it almost defied description. Mudryk went close at an angle. At a corner, Mudryk took Shedloads of abuse from the Leeds fans.\n\n“You’re fookin’ shit, you’re fookin’ shit, you’re fookin’ shit.”\n\nLeeds countered occasionally. For some reason, their right-winger James (he scored against us in his first game for Manchester United in August 2019) reminded me of Eddie Gray, his build and his running style.\n\nOn thirty-seven minutes, another fine move down our right. The ball was worked centrally at first, Caicedo to Chalobah to Madueke. As so often happens, he chose to dribble laterally, but in doing so encountered some space. He pushed the ball between defenders to Gusto on the right. A touch, a prod into Sterling, and a cutback to Mudryk, and a first-time finish, sweeping it low past the ‘keeper. Another great goal.\n\nHe stood in front of his detractors.\n\n“Ви казали?”\n\nWe were 2-1 up.\n\nThe visitors were not impressed.\n\n“2-1 and you still don’t sing.”\n\nLeeds came again and James fired over from a free-kick. Jaidon Anthony ghosted in from the left and thumped one that just missed the far post.\n\n“We all hate Leeds and Leeds and Leeds…”\n\nAt the break, it was time to reflect on the first-half. We had scored two nice goals, but some of our build-up play was just too slow. Moises Caicedo was the best of our bunch, strong in the tackle, decent passing, holding it all together. We had done just enough.\n\nAlas, in the second-half, we didn’t do much at all.\n\nLeeds began the stronger and after a while it dawned on me that we had hardly strung more than two passes together. On fifty-eight minutes, with the Chelsea crowd not involved and docile, Ampadu swung a long cross over to Anthony. I was dismayed that Gusto did not make a stab at the ball, allowing a long cross towards the far post where Joseph was able to leap, totally unmarked, and head down and in.\n\nIt was now 2-2.\n\nOn sixty-one minutes, a double substitution.\n\nConor Gallagher for Madueke.\n\nBen Chilwell for Gusto.\n\nChilwell to left-back, Gilchrist to right-back, Gallagher to the middle, Mudryk to the left, Sterling to the right.\n\nOur play went to pieces.\n\n“We’re second-best here.”\n\nA shot from Anthony was deflected but its trajectory stayed close to Sanchez.\n\nOur passing was off, our intensity had slowed, we had stopped doing the small things. We looked so tired.\n\nMudryk crossed high but Jackson was always underneath it.\n\nOn seventy-four minutes, more changes.\n\nLevi Colwill for Gilchrist.\n\nCole Palmer for Sterling.\n\nDisasi to right-back, Colwill in the middle, Palmer on the left.\n\nWe still struggled. We all began to wonder about extra-time and penalties, another late night.\n\nOn the ninetieth minute, there was really fine play from Enzo who fought to retain possession on the left and he scurried forward. He spotted the run of Gallagher and slotted a beautiful pass into him. Gallagher’s touch was exquisite and despite being squeezed by two Leeds defenders, he lifted the ball over Meslier.\n\nGet in you beauty.\n\nNow it was our turn to scream and shout.\n\nStamford Bridge roared, but how I wished that it had been roaring all night.\n\nIn injury-time, a debut was given to Jimi Tauriainen, whose first moment of action was to foul a Leeds defender; obviously he had read the script.\n\nChelsea 3 Leeds United 2.\n\nAt the end, “Freed From Desire “ and “One Step Beyond”\n\nWe can’t really grumble about getting home draws all of the way through the two domestic cups this season can we? Eight out of eight.\n\nWimbledon.\n\nBrighton.\n\nBlackburn Rovers.\n\nNewcastle United.\n\nPreston North End.\n\nAston Villa.\n\nLeeds United.\n\nLeicester City.\n\nDuring the day, I had joked to a few people about the game against Leeds.\n\n“Yeah, looking forward to it. But what’s the end goal? Get to another Cup Final at Wembley and lose that one too?”\n\nI don’t know whether to laugh or cry.\n\nOutside, mobs of Leeds made their way back to waiting cars and coaches. I had not seen so many police at Chelsea in years.\n\nOn the walk back to the car, Ron Harris explained that Eddie Gray was with the Leeds board at Stamford Bridge and had asked to be linked up with his old adversary from 1970. The two former players spent thirty minutes in each other’s company. In fact, Eddie Gray did the exact same thing on his last visit to Chelsea last season. I admired that. These old warriors must love to meet up and share stories of that game and others.\n\n“How old is Eddie Gray, Ron? Same age as you?”\n\n“Couple years younger, I think.”\n\n“Right.”\n\nWe walked on.\n\n“Oh yeah, I remember now. When he played against you in 1970 he was younger. But after the replay, I heard that he aged significantly.”\n\nRon smiled.\n\nI soon escaped from London and for the first time that I can remember I didn’t stop once until I pulled up at “The Milk Churn” at about midnight. I was home by 12.40am, a relatively early night.\n\nRight then, back to the league now. Brentford on Saturday. See you there.\n\nCrystal Palace vs. Chelsea : 12 February 2024.\n\nAs we travelled up to South London for the away game at Selhurst Park against Crystal Palace, we wondered if the performance of the season at Villa Park would turn out to be a solid stepping stone for the rest of the campaign. Or just a mad “one-off”.\n\nSelhurst Park is a real ball-ache to reach. Driving up from the West of England, we are at the hands of the Sat Nav Gods. It’s basically a case of “top, middle or bottom.”\n\nTop – up the M4 as far as the familiar turn off down the North End Road, past The Goose, then down to Wandsworth Bridge and then south-east in a straight line to Crystal Palace Football Club.\n\nMiddle – up the M3, around the M25, along the A3, almost as far as Kingston-upon-Thames, then through the B-roads of South-West London, nudging due east to Selhurst Park.\n\nBottom – up the M3 and then all of the way around the M25 to “six o’clock” before a dead straight route north up the A23 to the stadium.\n\nOn this particular afternoon, at just after 2pm in Melksham, the GPS went for the middle option. It suggested a journey of three hours. In reality, hit by traffic at a few key places, it became four hours. I had sorted out some parking at a private house just off Holmesdale Road, which runs north-south behind the home stand at Selhurst Park, and over the last few miles we tried to spot a pub to base ourselves for an hour. We had almost given up on finding anywhere, but I happened to spot a pub – “Pawson Arms” – a short drive from my parking space. There was even a free parking space right outside the pub.\n\nPerfect.\n\nIt was a home pub – full of Palace fans, full of Palace photos and memorabilia on the walls – but we sidled in and stood next to the bar. It was busy but not ridiculously so. It was nigh-on perfect, as away pubs go. Andy – a friend of a friend – arrived at about 6.45pm and I passed over a spare ticket. A few minutes later, we hopped in the car and I drove to my JustPark location, just a few yards off Holmesdale Road. The Selhurst Park floodlights were easily visible. We began the march up the hill to the ground.\n\n“Don’t remember it being this bloody steep last time.”\n\nIt took me a long time to visit Selhurst Park for the first time. My first visit was in August 1989 and a game against the then tenants Charlton Athletic, a match we lost 0-3. I watched from the middle of the Holmesdale Road terrace. My first game against Crystal Palace was in October 1991, a dull 0-0 draw, and the Chelsea support for that game was in a horrible corner section of the Arthur Wait Stand at the Holmesdale Road end. I include a few grainy photos.\n\nWe turned left at the top and began the slow walk down to the away turnstiles. I heard a young American lad, bedecked in a Palace scarf, ask where the fanzone was. I felt like saying to him “bollocks to the fanzone mate, get yourself down the “Pawson Arms” for an authentic pre-match experience”.\n\nThree spares were handed over to other lads and at about 7.40pm, we made our way in.\n\nI was down the front – row five – with Parky, John and Gary. Our usual match day companion Alan was convalescing after a health scare a few miles away in Anerley. We hope and pray that he can re-join us for a Chelsea game soon. Selhurst Park doesn’t change too much does it? However, for the first time I spotted a press box, illuminated, in the rear reaches of the old sand opposite, beneath the corrugated roof. This was my first evening game at Selhurst for ages and ages. I remember a FA Cup replay against Wimbledon in 1995, but nothing since.\n\nMore bloody flames. More bloody fireworks. Oh dear oh dear.\n\nWhile the Holmesdale Ultras displayed a variety of stark messages for the club’s board to ignore and the general public to perhaps spot on the TV feed, the Chelsea away support was rocking.\n\nOur team? Thiago Silva came in for the injured Benoit Badiashile. Raheem Sterling was again not chosen to start.\n\nPetrovic\n\nGusto – Disasi – Silva – Chilwell\n\nCaicedo – Enzo\n\nMadueke – Gallagher– Jackson\n\nPalmer\n\nThe home team were without Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze, their fleet-footed forwards. On the far side, Roy Hodgson looked frail while Ray Lewington lent on a post near the dugout.\n\nFine singing from the away section of the Arthur Wait Stand continued as the game began at 8pm. We dominated early possession. However, as the first-half continued, unfortunately our old habits resurfaced way too easily. We were passing the ball from side to side, but with no incisive passes to hurt the Crystal Palace defence. In fact, it was the home team who dominated the early chances, often breaking through our lines with ease. A shot from Jean-Philippe Mateta was saved by Djordje Petrovic.\n\nIt seems almost sacrilegious to say it, but Thiago Silva continued to slow things down. In his defence, there was little movement in front of him, but it was still so frustrating. It was if he was suffering from the football equivalent of “the yips” or the dart player’s worst nightmare of not being able to release the dart.\n\nElsewhere Cole Palmer was anonymous.\n\nOn the half-hour mark, a Palace player attempted a Paolo Di Canio scissor kick but the ball was not cleared. A calamitous scene ensued. Moises Caicedo and Noni Madueke colluded to get in each other’s way.\n\n“Get rid! Get rid!”\n\nThe ball was picked up by Jefferson Lerma, who dropped his shoulder and curled a magnificent effort wide of Petrovic but not wide of the goal.\n\nCrystal Palace 1 Chelsea 0.\n\n“Glad All Over” rang out.\n\nBollocks.\n\nAs the rest of the dour first-half continued, we became aware that we had not engineered a single effort on the Crystal Palace goal. So, after all, maybe Villa Park was indeed a mad “one-off” and this was the real Chelsea. We tended to attack down the right where there was an awkward alliance between Malo Gusto and Madueke. Their fine performances the previous Wednesday were not able to be repeated. On the left, Ben Chilwell and Nicolas Jackson struggled. The whole team struggled.\n\nOn forty minutes, Moises Caicedo lost possession and an almighty chase took place. Thankfully, a typically well-timed sliding tackle by Silva saved the day.\n\nOn forty-five minutes, a meek shot from Conor Gallagher was scuffed wide of the far post; our first shot of the game. Bloody hell.\n\nAt the break, Mauricio Pochettino replaced Madueke with Christopher Nkunku.\n\nNkunku was stood at the centre-circle, awaiting the restart. But, all of a sudden, several players were seen knocking footballs around between them. What was going on? Was this post-modern football here?\n\n“Don’t bother with the game, nor scoring, just pass the ball to each other. Just enjoy yourself. You will still get paid.”\n\nWe tried to work out why there was a delay. We then realised that the football match was missing a key ingredient; a referee.\n\nWhat could the matter be? Was the referee was stuck in the lavatory? Did nobody know he was there?\n\nIn an odd attempt at humour, the Palace PA played “Three Little Birds” by Bob Marley.\n\n“Don’t worry about a thing ‘cus every little thing is gonna be alright!”\n\nI wondered if this was, or had been, a Palace song. It certainly was a Chelsea song. It first appeared way back in 2010 and I specifically hearing it first during a 5-0 win at Fratton Park.\n\nThe Chelsea fans soon latched onto it.\n\n“Don’t worry about a thing ‘cus every little thing is gonna be alright! CHELSEA!”\n\n“Don’t worry about a thing ‘cus every little thing is gonna be alright! CHELSEA!”\n\n“Don’t worry about a thing ‘cus every little thing is gonna be alright! CHELSEA!”\n\nAfter an age, the ref Michael Oliver appeared. The game restarted.\n\nAnd how.\n\nAfter just two minutes of the second-half, with “Three Little Birds” still bouncing around the Arthur Wait, a fine ball from the hot and cold Caicedo found Gusto on the right. His pull-back to Gallagher was cleanly despatched despite the ball bouncing high as it approached him.\n\nScreams. Shouting. Mayhem. The players raced towards us. I was pushed, lost my footing, and almost lost my glasses. Photos were an impossibility until everything had died down.\n\nCrystal Palace 1 Chelsea 1.\n\nIt seemed as if the momentum had switched. We had witnessed a ridiculous few minutes when a song had rejuvenated the support and – possibly, probably – had sparked life into the team.\n\nI wondered if the Palace DJ would be awarded an assist for the equaliser.\n\nThe support roared on. With Nkunku in the middle, we caught a lot of Palmer as he drifted right. Chelsea dominated the play, with much of the action right in front of us. On a few occasions, I held my camera ready for Gusto or Palmer or Gallagher to break free.\n\nPalmer went close.\n\nAt the other end, Silva heroically blocked a shot from Matheus Franca but stayed down. He was replaced by Levi Colwill.\n\nAn hour had passed.\n\nEfforets from Chilwell and Jackson went close.\n\nAt the other end, a rare Palace break and a fine save by Petrovic from Franca.\n\nOn seventy-eight minutes, Raheem Sterling replaced Jackson.\n\nOn eighty-three minutes, Alfie Gilchrist replaced Gusto.\n\nA chance for Sterling but he needed extra touches and the chance went begging. A Disasi header was parried by the Palace ‘keeper Dean Henderson.\n\nTime was passing.\n\nWe entered injury time.\n\nJohn mentioned that the last two visits to Selhurst Park had resulted in ridiculously late winners; Hakim Ziyech in February 2022 and Conor Gallagher in October 2022.\n\nWell…\n\nOn ninety-one minutes, a fine break. Sterling found himself in space and passed to Palmer. I clicked. The photo shows Gallagher and Enzo racing through in support. Palmer advanced and adeptly slid the ball to Gallagher. The finish was exquisite, a slide-rule pass into the goal. It showed Jimmy Greaves levels of calm.\n\nPandemonium in South London.\n\nFackinell.\n\nThe players raced towards us all again.\n\nFootball – I fucking love you.\n\nCrystal Palace 1 Chelsea 2.\n\nJohn and his late winners.\n\nIt got better.\n\nTwo minutes later, we broke from our own box, the ball steered out to Palmer once more. He raced away, Nkunku occupied the thoughts of a key defender, and the ball was perfectly pushed into Enzo. He steadied himself, took a moment, then clipped the ball high into the net. I snapped that goal but not the ensuing madness in front of us once again.\n\nCrystal Palace 1 Chelsea 3.\n\nGame over.\n\nPhew.\n\nThe away section was on fire by now, and the supporters were a heady mixture of joy and disbelief. We sauntered out, regrouped and walked up and then down the hills of Selhurst to get to our car.\n\nThe getaway was ridiculously quick and the Sat Nav chose the top route to head back. It felt odd driving within half-a-mile of Stamford Bridge on the way home.\n\nIt had been another long day. I returned home at 1.40am.\n\nNext up, yet another away game, the third in a row.\n\nManchester City await.\n\nSee you there.\n\n1991\n\n2010\n\nIn the last few minutes of the game, my ears registered a new song emanating from the rowdy fans to my right. It didn’t take long to work out that it was a few lines from a Bob Marley song. More and more Chelsea joined in as our brains deciphered it. It had been an easy night, so we needn’t get carried away, but the song provided a nice uplift…a positive vibe for once.\n\n“Don’t worry – CLAP CLAP – about a thing…CLAP CLAP CLAP – ‘cus every little thing – CLAP CLAP – is gonna be alright.”\n\n2024\n\nAston Villa vs. Chelsea : 7 February 2024.\n\nWe weren’t expecting much from this FA Cup replay at Villa Park. Why would we be? In our previous two games we had conceded eight goals. There was, in fact, a real worry that we would become unstuck on a mighty scale.\n\nI had worked an early shift, collected Paul and PD at 2.20pm, and then headed north. We stopped off at “The Vine” at West Bromwich at about 4.30pm. Our modus operandi was that if we were travelling over one hundred miles to watch a football game that we would probably lose, we had best find our fun elsewhere. The three curries, as always, went down a treat.\n\nAt around 6.45pm, I dropped the lads off as close to Villa Park that I could get and then double-backed on myself to park up. The plan was to walk all of the way around the stadium to take a selection of wide-angled photographs of the stands and to try to capture the essence of a midweek cup tie.\n\nVilla Park, eh?\n\nThis is a ground that became synonymous with FA Cup semi-finals before the FA took the unfortunate step to host all semis at the new Wembley Stadium. We have played a few semis at Villa Park over the years dating back to our first one, a win, against Everton in 1915. There was then a long gap of fifty years followed by three games in quick succession. We then lost to Liverpool in 1965 and Sheffield Wednesday in 1966 before defeating Leeds United in 1967.\n\nHowever, my first viewing of an FA Cup tie at Villa Park took place in early 1987. I travelled down to Birmingham with two mates from college in Stoke; Bob, Leeds United, and Steve, Derby County. I remember we posed for a photo outside the famous steps of the Trinity Road but the weather was too overcast and my camera was too cheap for the photo to be worth sharing. I had visited Villa Park for a tedious 0-0 draw in November 1986, but this cup tie was a great match. We had about 5,000 fans in a 21,997 crowd on the low terrace behind the goal and in the seats of the old Witton Lane Stand. We watched from the seats. We went 1-0 up in the first-half via John Bumstead but Villa equalised with twenty minutes to go via Neale Cooper. David Speedie then put us ahead on eighty-six minutes only for Steve Hunt to equalise again. We would win the replay at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThat game in 1987 was our last FA Cup tie against Villa on their home patch. However, we would play two semi-finals at Villa Park within six years during the Glenn Hoddle to Claudio Ranieri era.\n\nIn 1996, we assembled at Villa Park for the game against Manchester United. We were allocated the old Trinity Road Stand and three-quarters of the Holte End. Luckily, we had seats in the very front row of the upper tier of the Holte End, and I decided to take advantage of this position by creating a flag in honour of Ruud Gullit that I could drape over the balcony. Although the great man himself headed us into the lead in the first-half, United came back to win 2-1 with two goals in quick succession a quarter of an hour into the second-half via Andy Cole and David Beckham.\n\nIn 2002, our semi-final against Fulham was to be played at Highbury but our opponents took umbrage that the split of the 38,000 tickets at Arsenal’s stadium slightly favoured ourselves. They demanded that the game should be played at a stadium that allowed more equal allocations. Lo and behold, the two clubs from West London were forced to decamp to Birmingham on a Sunday evening with the game kicking-off at a ridiculous 7pm. I travelled up with a car load from Frome and we enjoyed a lengthy pre-match in the “Crown And Cushion” pub at Perry Barr. This pre-match is notable for the first-ever photo of Parky and myself together. We watched in the noisy upper tier of the North Stand as a John Terry goal just before half-time sent us to Wembley. The irony is that the attendance was only 36,147 and Fulham – of course – did not sell all of their tickets.\n\n“Thanks, then.”\n\nI took a few photographs on the walk through to the away end. Three police vans were parked on the roundabout near the Witton train station. Emiliano Buendia drove past in his car and some Villa fans close by went all weak at the knees. Amidst the throng of match-goers, a chap stood in the middle of Witton Lane with a “God Is Love” placard. I took outside shots of three of the stands but I did not fancy the trot down to the Holte End on this occasion. Time was moving on and I wanted to get inside to join up with the lads. I could sense an air of buoyancy amidst the home fans.\n\n“The Giant Is Awake” is the current tagline at Villa Park and I suppose they have a point. They are playing their best stuff in years.\n\nI was inside at about 7.30pm. As I spoke to a few fellow travellers in the concourse and in the seating area of the away section, nobody was confident.\n\nI took my seat alongside the lads. We were towards the back of the lower tier and it was a decent view. Chelsea were given 6,298 tickets for this game as opposed to the standard 3,000 for league matches. It seemed that a fair few were going spare if the announcements on social media were a clue. I just hoped that there weren’t large swathes of gaps in our section. I soon realised that the split was around 3,000 in the usual areas of the Witton Lane / Doug Ellis but with around 3,300 in the top tier of the North Stand to our right.\n\nThere were occasional empty seats but this was a magnificent effort from our supporters. While the dynamics have changed – for the worse, for the worse – at home games, thank God that the football calendar can occasionally throw up an occasion like this where the bedrock of the club can get a chance to follow the team en masse.\n\nThe minutes ticked by.\n\nThere were a few rock anthems as the 8pm kick-off approached. Surprisingly, “Hi Ho Silver Lining” was aired – as it was at Wolves – but then “Crazy Train” by Ozzy Osbourne took over as the teams were spotted in the off-centre tunnel.\n\nVilla then overdid it a bit. Not only were there plumes of smoke by the tunnel, but flames all along the pitch by the Doug Ellis Stand and – fackinell – fireworks in the sky above the stadium.\n\nNot to worry, the six thousand Chelsea fans had a response.\n\n“CAREFREE!”\n\nOn a serious note, all of this manufactured noise before kick-off might well look good on TV and it might excite children, but the problem is that it doesn’t allow for atmospheres to sizzle along nicely resulting in a crackling crescendo of noise – self-generated – at kick-off. Maybe those days are gone forever.\n\nSigh.\n\nOur team? No Thiago Silva. No Raheem Sterling.\n\nPetrovic\n\nGusto – Disasi – Badiashile – Chilwell\n\nGallagher – Caicedo – Enzo\n\nMadueke – Palmer – Jackson\n\nThere were a few mumbles and grumbles about the starting positions of Cole Palmer and Nicolas Jackson, but – noticeably – nobody was bemoaning the absence of Raheem Sterling.\n\nOK. Everyone stood. Not many gaps in the immediate area. A few late-comers. Many familiar faces. I still wasn’t confident, but here we go. I tried to juggle photographs with shouts and applause for the team.\n\n“CAM ON YOU BLUE BOYS.”\n\nThe Chelsea players formed a pre-match huddle, and while they waited for captain Ben Chilwell to join them, I spotted Cole Palmer looking over at the Chelsea support in the Doug Ellis Stand. He seemed to be in awe :\n\n“Bloody hell, they have turned up tonight alright. There’s thousands behind the goal too.”\n\nHowever, not all parts of Villa Park were full. I soon spotted hundreds of central seats in the executive areas opposite not being used. That was just odd.\n\nSoon into the game, with Villa attacking our end, a long cross found Alex Moreno unmarked at the far post, but rather than attempt an effort himself he decided to head the ball back across the six-yard box. A defensive head cleared.\n\nIt was a lively start to the game with Chelsea breaking with speed and intensity. Malo Gusto linked with Noni Madueke and worked the ball in to Palmer inside the Villa box at the Holte End. His shot was an easy take for Emiliano Martinez.\n\nThere was a header, shortly after, from Enzo but his compatriot Martinez easily fielded this effort too.\n\nOn eleven minutes, we won the ball out on our left. I stood on tip-toes to watch the move develop. Inside to Conor Gallagher who spread the ball into the path of Jackson. He ran and ran, and played a low ball towards Madueke. Although surrounded by Villa defenders, he wisely took a touch before knocking it back into the path of Gallagher. The shot rose steeply but we erupted when the net rippled.\n\nPandemonium.\n\nBodies and limbs everywhere. I had no hope of taking a shot of the players celebrating away in the corner.\n\nWe were winning. Fackinell.\n\nI was so aware that Conor’s lack of goals is often cited by many as a major-downside. So I was doubly happy that the goal came from him. Lovely.\n\nVilla came into the game but Djordje Petrovic thwarted their couple of attempts on goal including an angled volley from Ollie Watkins.\n\nWe continued to purr. On twenty-one minutes, Disasi found Madueke in tons of space. He turned and pushed the ball wide into the over-lapping Malo Gusto. His cross into the box – a relatively low trajectory – was met by the leap of Jackson. His angled effort crashed into the goal.\n\nWe were 2-0 up, oh my bloody goodness.\n\nI saw the players celebrating through the forest of arms but I managed to cajole a photo or two out of my camera.\n\nThe away support boomed as we continued to dominate. I was really shocked by the lack of noise coming from the home areas though.\n\nNothing. I heard nothing at all.\n\nWe, not surprisingly full of it. However, songs about Willian, John Terry, Frank Lampard and Cesc Fabregas? Really? Save those for the last five minutes of games when we are winning 4-0 plus please. The Willian one was a real shocker.\n\nI took great pleasure in seeing Enzo get more and more involved. Just two examples of his play; the first a cushioned control of the ball with his instep that screamed quality, the second, a first-time transfer of the play from left wing to right wing that told me that he was full of confidence.\n\nAlongside him, Moises Caicedo was enjoying his best game for us, adeptly swatting Villa breaks, tacking hard, turning and passing. And then Gallagher, a one-man search-and-destroy unit, full of energy and running. It was a very fluid and powerful midfield indeed.\n\nThe natives were restless and I was loving it.\n\nChilwell, finding himself on the right, moved inside and unleashed a shot that whizzed just past the near post.\n\nOn thirty-three minutes, Madueke hugged the far touchline as he accelerated away after picking up a loose ball level with our penalty box. He skipped past a challenge and continued his run. He passed to Palmer whose shot was at a relatively easy height for Martinez to save.\n\nOn a rare break, Watkins set up John McGinn, but Petrovic tipped it over.\n\nAt the half-time break, there were nothing but happy faces among the travelling army. It had been, no doubt, the best half of the season by far. Against a decent team, too, let’s not forget.\n\nOzzy serenaded us with “Crazy Train” once again as the teams took to the pitch for the second-half.\n\nThe home team began brightly and I can honestly say that after a quick attack in the first minute I heard the Holte End for the first discernible time.\n\n“Yippee-aye-eh, yippe-aye-oh, Holte Enders in the skoi.”\n\nWe applauded them.\n\nOn fifty-four minutes, a foul on Enzo. The free-kick was a long way out. I wanted Palmer to take it, but Enzo stood with Chilwell. Chilwell peeled away and Enzo took aim. As did I.\n\nSnap.\n\nI looked up to see the ball fly over the wall and dip majestically into the top corner with Martinez beaten.\n\nWhat a goal.\n\nThe away sections again boomed.\n\nZola-esque.\n\nI snapped his euphoric run down to our corner. I sensed the meaning of his actions immediately.\n\n“Look at me. I’m Enzo. I’m staying.”\n\nAh, bloody lovely stuff.\n\nI instantly forgave him for the yellow card that followed him taking his shirt off. Sometimes emotion gets in the way of accountability and rational thought.\n\nThe Chelsea supporters on the side stand piped up.\n\n“North Stand. Give Us A Song. North Stand North Stand Give Us A Song.”\n\nLovely stuff.\n\nWe were through. And we just could not resist a nod to our next opponents.\n\n“We all hate Leeds and Leeds and Leeds…”\n\nAmongst all this, a word for the much-maligned duo of Axel Disasi and Benoit Badiashile. Their best games for ages too. There was even a song, only a few days after many for rubbishing his recent performances.\n\n“Brought us back a centre back. Benoit Badiashile.”\n\nWe’re a fickle bunch aren’t we?\n\nOn sixty-five minutes, a song for a former player that I could fully get behind.\n\n“VIALLI! VIALLI! VIALLI! VIALLI!”\n\nSome late substitutions :\n\n72 : Christopher Nkunku for Jackson.\n\n75 : Raheem Sterling for Madueke.\n\nMoreno rose at the far post but his looping header landed on top of the net rather than inside it.\n\nMore substitutions.\n\n81 : Thiago Silva for Palmer.\n\n87 : Alfie Gilchrist for Badiashile.\n\nVilla had a late flourish and in injury-time, Moussa Diaby coolly slotted in at the Holte End.\n\nAston Villa 1 Chelsea 3.\n\nA roar at the final whistle. What a night. Roared on by over six thousand our team rose to the occasion and played some gorgeous attacking football. Why can’t all away games be like this?\n\nLeeds – you are next.\n\n2023/24 FA Cup Round Five\n\nBlackburn Rovers vs. Newcastle United\n\nBournemouth vs. Leicester City\n\nChelsea vs. Leeds United\n\nCoventry City vs. Maidstone United\n\nLiverpool vs. Southampton\n\nLuton Town vs. Manchester City\n\nNottingham Forest vs. Manchester United\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers vs. Brighton & Hove Albion\n\nWalking out of the stadium after the game brought back memories of other away triumphs over the years. Everyone was singing – “sign him up for eight more years, Chelsea boys are on the beers” – and I sensed a swagger in our step, that good old Chelsea swagger of old. There’s nothing like it. We walked back to the car and we followed the old rule of being able to walk wherever you want after an away win.\n\nUp to the roundabout, out into the road, the cars can stop for us.\n\nThe swagger was back.\n\n1996\n\n2002\n\n2024\n\n1996 – Part 2.\n\nIt came to light after the game at Villa Park that a sports photographer – working for “Action Images” – had taken a photo of my “Ruud Boys” flag from behind the goal.\n\nI spotted that a cropped version of it soon appeared in a copy of “Total Football” later that year.\n\nI didn’t ask for royalties.\n\n1996 – Part 3.\n\nThe former Wimbledon striker Dean Holdsworth once had an affair with glamour model Linsey Dawn McKenzie. At a game at Selhurst Park in the 1996-1997 season – I wasn’t there – the Chelsea fans were full of rude comments about this romantic liaison. In the “Daily Sport” newspaper – that beacon of journalistic integrity – the following day, there was a photo of Linsey Dawn McKenzie (baring all) with a headline to the effect of “How dare Chelsea fans be rude to both Dean and me?”\n\nThe editor chose to illustrate her tirade at the Chelsea fans with a picture of some Chelsea fans, set just behind a large photograph of Linsey Dawn and her quite substantial charms. The photo that the editor chose was from the Villa Park semi-final. It was the photo of my Ruud Boys flag. Or rather, a close-up photo of Glenn and me (looking, strangely, straight at the camera). The story goes that Glenn was sitting with his workmates during a tea break when one of them opened up the middle pages of his “Daily Sport” to exclaim –\n\n“Hey, Glenn – there’s a picture of you and Chris Axon next to Linsey Dawn MacKenzie here.”\n\nNext up, a game at Selhurst Park once again; Crystal Palace away on Monday evening.\n\nSee you there.\n\nChelsea vs. Middlesbrough : 23 January 2024.\n\nMy seat for the second leg of the League Cup semi-final against Middlesbrough was in row Q – the rear row all but one – of the Matthew Harding Upper and I was inside with about fifteen minutes to go. There had been a greater queue than normal outside. It was a very mild night in SW6. I was beginning to regret to regret wearing a bulky puffer jacket. Up the other end, in The Shed, were the brightly-coloured visitors from Teesside, around 5,000 of the buggers, their biggest turnout at Stamford Bridge since “that” game in 1988.\n\nWhile we attempted to overturn a narrow 0-1 deficit from the first leg on this Tuesday night in the Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham, just twenty-four hours later, Fulham would be attempting to overcome a similar result in their semi-final against Liverpool. All of a sudden, our home borough was the centre of attention.\n\nWhile latecomers took their seats, I remained quietly confident of us advancing to yet another Wembley Cup Final. And – of course – we hoped that Fulham would join us.\n\nOn the pitch, the ground staff in matching dark grey puffer jackets of their own prodded away at the wet grass using forks. Then the lights dimmed, and the 1-2 punch occurred.\n\nFirstly, the pulsing electronic beat boomed out of the stadium’s speakers, the strobe lighting began and then the flames flashed into the sky.\n\nSecondly, the “what the fookin’ hell was that?” from the away support.\n\nIt was a very colourful away support, with many of the ‘Boro bedecked in red and white scarves and with replica shirts on show under unbuttoned jackets. I remember a similar number of Tottenham fans at our semi-final in 2019, occupying those same two tiers, and with everyone dressed in dark jackets, a large unsavoury mob, almost looking like a European team. This lot were far more brightly attired. There were a few flags dotted around too.\n\n“We Built the World.”\n\n“You Make Me Happy When Skies Are Grey.”\n\n“We Are Boro.”\n\nMy Middlesbrough mate Chris texted me :\n\n“You’ll probably win the match, but I’ll be happy if we out-sing you.”\n\nWith the players of both teams on the pitch, they then moved to the centre circle and the PA asked us to remember one of our own.\n\nI only ever saw Tommy Baldwin play once for Chelsea. On Saturday 10 October 1974, my second-ever visit to Stamford Bridge, Tommy played against Tottenham in a game that we won 1-0, the goal coming from an early John Hollins penalty.\n\nThe Chelsea team that day was :\n\nJohn Phillips.\n\nGary Locke.\n\nRon Harris.\n\nJohn Hollins\n\nMicky Droy.\n\nJohn Dempsey.\n\nSteve Kember\n\nTommy Baldwin.\n\nCharlie Cooke\n\nIan Hutchinson\n\nPeter Houseman.\n\nIt was also the only time that I saw John Dempsey play. Later that season, Tommy joined Manchester United on loan before drifting away from Stamford Bridge and finishing his career with a few games at Brentford. He had been a stalwart at Chelsea for eight years, playing almost two-hundred games as a bustling midfielder or inside-forward.\n\nI often used to see Tommy Baldwin meeting up with other former players as they congregated together before darting off to engage in hospitality activities on match days. Unfortunately, Tommy had been unwell for quite a while and on Monday we heard that he had sadly passed away. He was seventy-eight. Tommy Baldwin was nicknamed “The Sponge” for reasons that were sometimes debated. There are those that said that it was because of his ability to soak up pressure, attack after attack, in his midfield role. But I suspect that those that knew him better, knew that this was a name derived from his ability to drink. I had read through the detailed obituary that appeared on the Chelsea website on Monday evening; it was a fine summation of his time as a footballer in Chelsea colours and illustrated his often-under-appreciated role in that most revered of Chelsea teams.\n\nAlthough his name was not widely known outside SW6 circles – unlike Bonetti, Osgood, Cooke, Harris, Hollins, Hudson et al – his role in the functioning of the team was acknowledged by us all. He was as no footballing Corporal Sponge.\n\nWhile his image appeared in black and white on the two TV screens, both sets of supporters applauded in his memory.\n\nRest In Peace Tommy Baldwin, The Leader Of The Team.\n\nI scanned our team.\n\nPetrovic\n\nDisasi – Silva – Colwill – Chilwell\n\nPalmer – Caicedo – Fernandez\n\nSterling – Broja – Mudryk\n\nWe attacked the Middlesbrough fans in the first-half. They were, unsurprisingly, noisy.\n\n“That’s why we sing this song for the ‘Boro all night long.”\n\nFor the first ten minutes or so, it seemed like a seamless continuation from the game on Teesside a fortnight ago. They were sat back and we took forever to move the ball from one side of the pitch to the other, while the movement upfront was almost non-existent. A few pumps up field from deep did not hit targets.\n\nThere were a couple of worrying signs early on. Raheem Sterling was ball-watching during a ‘Boro attack, leaving his wide man ridiculously free but thankfully the ball stayed on the opposite side. Then, after getting sucked inside, Ben Chilwell had to race back – and across – like an express train as we were embarrassingly cut open down our left.\n\nBut we enjoyed a couple of efforts in this period; one from Mykhailo Mudrk, one from Chilwell.\n\nDjordje Petrovic got down well to save to his right.\n\nOn fifteen minutes, a swish move down our right involving Cole Palmer and Raheem Sterling set up Armando Broja. From my seat, I could not see the fine detail, but only the ball ending up in the net. We would soon find out that Johnny Howson had stuck out a leg and had scored the goal for us. But, I did not celebrate. Such is the spectre of VAR these days – even when it is not being used – that my celebrations were dulled. Of course, there was no flag, no nothing. The goal stood. It came at just the right time because the supporters in the Matthew Harding were starting to get a little agitated and nervous.\n\nPhew.\n\nThe tie was tied.\n\nThe rest of the first-half, unlike in Middlesbrough, certainly went to plan.\n\nOn twenty-eight minutes, some solid play between Sterling and Axel Disasi down the right set up a chance for Broja. His shot was blocked by a defender but Enzo Fernandez was on hand to slam the ball in. A slide into the corner from Enzo. I could celebrate that one.\n\nEight minutes later, Disasi broke up an attack with a superb tackle and passed to Sterling. As Sterling, who had enjoyed a mixed opening period, raced on, so did Disasi. Sterling played the ball back to our rampaging defender and his low finish put us 3-0 up. There was another slide into the corner.\n\n“That makes up for the chances we missed in the first-half two weeks ago.”\n\nIt was all Chelsea now.\n\nSome were singing “We’re Going To Wembley” but I resisted. It was a little too soon for me.\n\nMiddlesbrough tried to keep their shape but they suddenly looked tired.\n\nDespite the away fans dominating the night for most of the first-half – the twin staples of “your support is fooking shit” and “shall we sing a song for you?” were often heard – they were silent now.\n\nOn forty-two minutes, Palmer pick-pocketed a Middlesbrough defender and casually, and coolly, swept the ball in to the net.\n\nChelsea 4 Middlesbrough.\n\nNow I could join in…\n\n“Que Sera Sera.”\n\nIt had been an excellent half. After that slow start, we had grown as the game progressed. Petrovic had made the one save when he was needed. It was a joy to see Chilwell patrolling the left flank, and just inside him Levi Colwill looked a steady centre-back. We had been treated to two trademark sliding tackles from Silva. Disasi had enjoyed his best half for ages. In midfield, Enzo and Palmer created a few chances with their intelligent play and Moises Caicedo – not the easiest player to appreciate – was very solid. Broja was steady if not spectacular. Sterling was back on his game. The only negative was Mudryk, as perplexing as ever, a mixture of breath-taking speed mixed with jaw-dropping slowness of thought.\n\nBut we were happy at the break.\n\nFackinell.\n\nAt half-time, Nonu Madueke replaced Mudryk.\n\n“It’s probably for the best.”\n\nThe second-half began and I wasn’t quite sure how to behave. Did I want us to rampage away and score four more or conserve ourselves for the FA Cup game on Friday? In truth, we controlled the game without causing too much further damage to the scoresheet nor the away team’s morale.\n\nOn the hour, for the first real time, the whole crowd sang as one.\n\n“CAREFREE.”\n\nThat’s more like it.\n\nSome substitutions.\n\nCarney Chukwuemeka for Chilwell.\n\nConor Gallagher for Broja.\n\nOn seventy-seven minutes, Gallagher played in Palmer down below me, who did not bother with the burden of an additional touch and – as cool as you like – side-footed the ball in. Soon after, a blue flare was thrown onto the pitch from the MHL. It made for a great photo opportunity if nothing else.\n\nOn eighty-one minutes, Gallagher passed to Madueke, who shimmied and danced past a marker before slamming the ball at goal. The shot took a large deflection.\n\nChelsea 6 Middlesbrough 0.\n\nI was impressed that the away fans had been singing in the build up to the sixth goal and continued doing so when the goal came and for a while after too. Fair play to them. The biggest compliment that I can give them is that they reminded me of us when we were in our hey-day.\n\nThere was even time for a late debut.\n\nLeo Casteldine – “player number 54 where are you?” – replaced Sterling.\n\nI am unsure if we were being intentionally ironic, but we sang :\n\n“Shall we sing a song for you?”\n\nMiddlesbrough had two late goals; one annulled for offside but one stood, a fine low effort by Morgan Rogers.\n\nAt the whistle, Chelsea 6 Middlesbrough 1.\n\nI quickly gathered my stuff and headed out.\n\n“Blue Day” from 1997 blasted out on the PA. As I headed down the multiple flights of stairs at the rear of the stand, I heard the sweet voice of Doris Day. It did not compute. The opening bars just made me think of “that” Leeds song.\n\nI then got it.\n\n“Que sera sera.\n\nWhatever will be, will be.\n\nWe’re going to Wem-ber-lee.\n\nQue sera, sera.”\n\nOn the Fulham Road, there was some boisterous behaviour, some name-calling, some gesturing, some punches, some arrests.\n\nOutside the town hall, I spotted a female ‘Boro fan, arm in arm with her man – to possibly stop herself from falling over – who pointed at two Chelsea women and shouted “Chelsea Rent Girls!”\n\nWell, I had never heard that one before.\n\nWe got back to the car and set off for home at 10.30pm. I would be home by 1am. We hoped that the little brothers from Craven Cottage would do the business in the other semi-final, but our business in our borough was over for a few days.\n\nNext up, Aston Villa in the other cup on Friday.\n\nSee you there.\n\nPostscript 1 :\n\nThere was a regret that I didn’t hear Tommy Baldwin’s song during the game. Admitedly it is best suited for pre-match beers in the pub or concourse, but we always used to sing it at games.\n\n“Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee’re the Fulham Road supporters and we’re louder than The Kop.”\n\nPostscript 2 :\n\nNice to see my two friends Annette and Mark featured in the evening’s programme. They sometimes act as my unpaid spell-checkers.\n\nChelsea vs. Fulham : 13 January 2024.\n\nOn the long drive home from Middlesbrough last Wednesday, with the Semi-Final first leg defeat still fresh in my mind, I am not sure if I was overly brutal or just pragmatic about the rest of our campaign.\n\n“Listen, we are a tenth place team. We’ll beat Middlesbrough in the second leg and get to the final but lose to Liverpool once we get there. We’ll lose to Villa in the FA Cup. And that’s our season done.”\n\nHowever, by the time I had picked up the others – PD, Glenn, Parky, Ron – on the Saturday for the drive to London for the Fulham game at Stamford Bridge, my viewpoint had noticeably softened.\n\n“Well, I saw the highlights on “YouTube” and let’s be honest, Cole Palmer should have scored two. It could so easily have been one of those games where we didn’t play particularly well but squeaked a narrow win. New manager, new players, let’s give it some time. We have seen worse.”\n\nThoughts turned towards Fulham. We have a bloody marvellous record against this lot and at Stamford Bridge especially. However, although I had recently read that our last defeat at home to Fulham was forty-four years ago, there was absolutely no chance of me mentioning this to the lads in the car, bearing in mind how they had chastised me for talking about my unbeaten record against ‘Boro.\n\nThe last home defeat?\n\nSaturday 27 October 1979, a 0-2 loss in front of a very healthy 30,567 gate in the old Second Division.\n\n44 years.\n\n21 games.\n\n13 wins.\n\n8 draws.\n\n0 defeats.\n\nIt’s a very decent record indeed. Going back further, to our first home game against Fulham in 1911, the total stats are equally impressive.\n\n113 years.\n\n45 games.\n\n25 wins.\n\n18 draws.\n\n2 defeats.\n\nThe only other home defeat?\n\nSaturday 7 March 1964, a 1-2 defeat in front of a disappointing 26,219 in the old First Division.\n\nWith the kick-off for the 2023/24 version of the “SW6 Derby” taking place at 12.30pm, the pre-match routine took on a different guise. When I had dropped into “The Old Oak” last week, Alan had informed me that its doors would be opening at 9am for the Fulham game. This news was met with nods of approval from my fellow passengers. So, at about 9.20am I dropped Parky and PD outside the pub, which is just over the border to the north of Fulham in Hammersmith. I then drove down the North End Road and the Fulham Road to deposit Ron at the main gates bang on 9.30am. I was parked up on Normand Road a few minutes after. We bumped into Liz and Pete just as they were parking up. Glenn and I soon disappeared into a packed “Café Delight” for a quick breakfast, a first-ever visit. There were a couple of familiar faces in there. The clientele then moved south to “The Clarence” or “The Old Oak.”\n\nPD and Parky were supping pints of lager and we joined them at about 10.15am. More familiar faces were dotted around. I soon spotted Stu, a fellow season-ticket holder, who only lives four miles away from me. He sadly lost his wife Sue not so long ago – I went to Sue’s sixtieth birthday four years ago – and so I gave him a hug and offered words of sympathy. I spoke to Jonesy and Jocka, two lovely lads from the Nuneaton area, and we spoke a little about life – and Chelsea.\n\nJonesy pulled up a seat.\n\nWe mentioned the photos that I shared from the 1998 League Cup Final. We spoke about how quickly the time has gone since then.\n\n“Twenty-six years ago.”\n\nJonesy stated the unbelievable truth that in another twenty-six years some of us won’t be around.\n\n“Yeah. I’ll be eighty-four.”\n\nAnd yet 1998 seems fresh in my mind.\n\n“Life is accelerating away these days, mate.”\n\n“Don’t worry, Jonesy. The way we are playing at the moment, the next ten years will drag like fuck.”\n\nWe laughed.\n\nI met Mick from Hemel Hempstead for the first time and it was a pleasure. Mick has been reading these ramblings of mine for a while. He spotted me and came over to chat with the lads. It’s always nice to get positive feedback. I chuckled when he dropped one of my catchphrases in to the conversation.\n\nAt 11.45am we set off down the North End Road. A little mob of Fulham were – in football parlance – “giving it large” on their walk past outside the West Stand.\n\n“Stamford Bridge is falling down.”\n\nI just chuckled.\n\nI took my place in The Sleepy Hollow. Two of the usual four – Alan and Clive – were unable to attend. Glenn had Clive’s ticket and a young lad called Dan from way up in Carlisle had taken Alan’s ticket.\n\n“You’ve got some big boots to fill, mate.”\n\nBut Carlisle. Phew, that’s some train ride. Respect.\n\nThere was pre-match chat with Oxford Frank and we were both hoping for another three points to maybe edge closer, or even past, Manchester United and Newcastle United.\n\nOur team? It was the same as against ‘Boro apart from one change. Armando Broja was in to the lead the line, with Cole Palmer shifted to the wing in place of Noni Madueke.\n\n28\n\n27 – 6 – 2 – 26\n\n8 – 25\n\n20 – 23 – 7\n\n19\n\nIn the Fulham team, one man stood out.\n\n20\n\nIt was a cold winter day; a time for warm jackets, hats and caps.\n\nBig Brother vs. Little Brother.\n\nSW6 1HS vs. SW6 6HH.\n\nBlues vs. Whites.\n\nPensioners vs. Cottagers.\n\nChelstam vs. Fulhamish.\n\nThere has always been a very special relationship between the two clubs. It was always said that for the local populations in and around Fulham, Hammersmith, Chelsea, Putney and Battersea, football fans would go to Stamford Bridge one week and Craven Cottage the next.\n\nAs payment for taking wedding photos at a Chelsea wedding back in 2020, I was gifted a huge case of football programmes, including some lovely Wembley Cup Finals and England internationals from the ‘fifties. They all belonged to one man, a friend of Mick, the groom. But of special note here is that among many Chelsea home programmes were hundreds of Fulham programmes, from the ‘fifties onwards, too. It illustrates how the support was shared between the two clubs.\n\nHowever, they hate us these days.\n\nOn the other hand, we can’t be bothered about them.\n\nOh well.\n\nThe game began and for the first five minutes it felt like a continuation of the Middlesbrough game the previous Tuesday; tons of foreplay and no penetration.\n\nWe needed to get dirty.\n\nThe Fulham fans were bellowing about “One team in Fulham” and we responded, half-heartedly, with the usual “Come on Chelsea.”\n\nIt was all pretty timid stuff.\n\nAs the game began to get going, a shot from Enzo was blocked, and then the best move of the match resulted in a shot from Conor Gallagher rising over the bar at The Shed End.\n\nWe soon all admitted that we could see Willian – 20 for them, not 22 for us – drifting inside, down below us in familiar territory, dropping a shoulder and curling one in under the bar.\n\nShudder.\n\nOn twenty minutes, Armando Broja made a fine move towards the near post and flashed a header just wide of the goal. Until then, his lack of movement and lack of a physical threat was starting to wind me up.\n\nMidway through the half, there were two Fulham efforts on the Chelsea goal to my left. The second came after a fine move had found Harry Wilson and it needed an excellent save from Djordje Petrovic at his near post.\n\nChelsea were unsurprisingly dominant, but there were only glimpses of decent play, of players combining well, of coherent patterns. Not for the first time I lamented the movement off the ball. On two occasions, if only Broja had realised it, he was in acres of space if he had feinted one way and then spun the other. A pass or two from Silva would have released him.\n\nWillian came over to take part in a short corner. I rose to applaud him. As did many. I don’t go for singing songs about former players, but I certainly felt fine with applauding him just the once. The noise was loud. He clapped us too. I see nothing wrong with any of that. It shows us all in a good light, I think.\n\nTwo efforts from us; one from Cole Palmer, not at his best thus far, and a riser from Enzo, who was starting to show a lot more spirit to his performance.\n\nA crunching tackle from Malo Gusto left Willian rolling in pain, but I was too far away to see the detail.\n\nWe were treated to a ridiculous turn and dummy from Moises Caicedo on Wilson. The look of pain on the Fulham player’s face was – er – a picture.\n\nIn the last moments of the first-half, Palmer advanced and was thankfully aware of Raheem Sterling screaming for the ball to be played into him. A lovely reverse ball set him up. It seems that the Football Gods have decreed that Fulham must always have a towering player called Diop in their team, and it was the 2024 version – Issa – who took an ungainly chop at Sterling just as he cut past him. From one hundred yards away it looked a penalty.\n\n…in my mind : “either a penalty or a booking for a dive.”\n\nThe maligned Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot.\n\nPhew.\n\nCole Palmer took the ball. His record with penalties is perfect for us.\n\nHe slotted it home.\n\nGET IN.\n\nThe goal came at a perfect time. It meant that there were no boos at half-time. In truth, although not a vintage performance, I was quietly content with some of our play. In my mind, Enzo Fernandez and Levi Colwill were enjoying their best games for a while.\n\nBaby steps and all that malarkey.\n\nThe second half began. There was a noticeable increase in intensity from the players, and the crowd, certainly in the Matthew Harding, responded well. In the first few minutes of the second period, Broja found himself in a central area of the box, but could not get a shot away. He was ridiculously marked but took an extra touch, as is his wont.\n\nOn fifty minutes, a bender from Palmer whizzed over. Two minutes later, Sterling rose so well and headed down and against a post, but was flagged for offside.\n\nAt the other end, a deflected Fulham cross from in front of their fans, but a resulting header flew over.\n\nA couple of pacey Chelsea attacks, the fleet-footed Gusto involved on both occasions, but blocks from the Fulham rear-guard kept us at bay. This was an excellent spell from us.\n\nOn sixty-six minutes, Noni Madueke replaced Broja.\n\nPalmer moved centrally as a false nine. From here, there were a few tricks and spins. I like him in a central role.\n\nJust after, Colwill curled a shot over from the edge of the box.\n\nWe longed for a second goal.\n\nEnzo continued his little resurgence. He showed a lot more spirit, fight, intensity, and drive. We need that. We need him creating from deep. We need Palmer creating further up field. Amongst everything, Conor Gallagher was on his game, closing down space, winning fifty-fifties, setting the tempo. Thiago Silva was magnificent as the second-half developed.\n\nMadueke was often involved. I like the way that he uses his body, how he forces himself across defenders, using his upper body to barge past.\n\nHowever, a rare Fulham chance caused palpitations. Andres Pereira found space in the box and passed to Raul Jimenez. The low shot was thankfully saved by Petrovic, who dropped to his right and threw out an arm. It was a really fine save.\n\nOn seventy-seven minutes, a roar as Ben Chilwell replaced Sterling. I spent a few minutes working out if our shape had changed. Chilwell for Sterling seemed to be a straight swap.\n\nOn eighty-two minutes, a nice run from Madueke set up Gallagher, who was rather hemmed in, but beautifully curled a shot at goal with the outside of his right boot. The ball curved and smacked the left upright.\n\nFackinell.\n\nColwill continued to impress. One ball out to the wing was immaculate, with just the right amount of fade for it to drop into the path of our player.\n\nOn eighty-four minutes, Enzo gave the ball up cheaply and it lead to a free-kick being rewarded by Taylor. It was central, right on the edge of the box. Who else but Willian took the ball. I hoped that it was too central for him to get a good angle.\n\nI turned around to the blokes behind me.\n\n“Here we go then. We have all been fearing this.”\n\nHe clipped the ball over the wall, but over the bar too.\n\nI turned to them again.\n\n“He has gone downhill, that Willian.”\n\nWe laughed.\n\nMadueke forced a low save from Leno.\n\n…inside my head : “shouldn’t we be closing this game out rather than chasing a second?”\n\nTwo late substitutions.\n\nNice applause for Carney Chukwuemeka, replacing Palmer.\n\nWarm applause for Alfie Gilchrist, replacing Gusto.\n\nIt was all very fraught in the final moments of the game. A couple of Fulham free-kicks out on their right were slung into the box. The first one was sent deep, but after penalty-box pinball, the ball was hoofed clear. The second resulted in head tennis, but again our goal remained i"
