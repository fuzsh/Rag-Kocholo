        "text": "\"Last weekend, Hartlepool's goals were scored by Peter Hartley and James Poole,\" says Lucy Clark. \"Are there any other teams whose scorers could form the name of the team?\"\n\nThe lack of a \"United\"-named goalscorer aside, these sorts of combos are sadly rather elusive. Dundee United had Tommy Dunne but alas, no Amos Dee; in 1898 Aston Villa had only a lone Charlie Aston; and in the 1960s Scunthorpe had Arthur Thorpe on the wing, but there aren't many Scuns to the dozen.\n\nIf we're allowed to cheat a little bit, Arthur and Fred Blackburn both played for Blackburn Rovers, with Arthur scoring on four occasions. Bradford City defender Lew Bradford scored once in his 68 post-war appearances, and Dave Barnett scored three for Barnet during the early 90s. We're not sure if Tommy Lees of Leeds United counts, or the former Wolves defender John de Wolf. Or indeed Graham Stokoe of, you guessed it, Stoke City. We have discovered a West-Bromage pairing for West Bromwich Albion, but unfortunately Colin West arrived about 60 years too late to play with Enos Bromage.\n\nAs far as we can find (and you know how to fix it if we're wrong), only one team might potentially have had goalscorers echoing the club name. Reg Chester signed for Manchester United in 1935, missing Tom Manns by a season, but both Herbet Mann and Frank Mann played for United while Arthur Chesters was on the books, between 1929 and 1933. Which means that technically, a report might have shown Manchester United 2 (Mann, Chesters) – but since Chesters was the reserve goalkeeper, it was never very likely.\n\nBIGGEST AWAY FOLLOWING\n\n\"I was at Queens Park v Rangers in December when the attendance was 30,117,\" says Karl Johnston. \"The home website said they had sold 2,400 tickets which suggests that at least 27,717 were away fans (not including away fans in the home section). I'm not sure there will always be official stats on away fans, but is there any way of knowing the largest ever away support in the UK and globally (not including cup finals and semi-finals at neutral venues)?\"\n\nAs Karl says, there are no official statistics in most cases so we have to rely on anecdotal evidence. There are a number of stories of teams attempting to avoid relegation bringing huge away support. Sunderland (an estimated 13,000) and Southampton (14,000) against Wimbledon at Selhurst Park in 1996-97 and 1998-99 are two of the more famous examples; the latter led to the portmanteau \"Dellhurst Park\". The same is true of sides going for the title or promotion. Aston Villa apparently brought at least 20,000 to Highbury on the day they clinched the 1980-81 title, while Manchester City had around 25,000 at St James' Park when they beat Newcastle to win the league in 1967-68. Bolton were responsible for at least three-quarters of the 27,835 attendance at Ewood Park when they sealed promotion in 1977-78. \"I couldn't stop crying when the final whistle went,\" wept their centre-half Sam Allardyce.\n\nOther examples include Burton Albion, who brought 11,000 misery-hunters to Old Trafford in 2006; Ghana, who had around 21,000 fans against England at Wembley two years ago; and Dynamo Dresden reportedly took around 27,000 to the Allianz Arena to face 1860 Munich in 2005-06. None of those can match the hard core of Trabzonspor, however: they had around 60,000 fans for the match away to Istanbul Buyuksehir Belediyespor in 2010-11. It made for quite the scene, as you can see here.\n\nAny more for any more? If so, you know what to do\n\nTHE PREMIER LEAGUE'S COMEBACK KINGS\n\n\"Manchester United's 2-1 victory over Southampton last week was their ninth league win this season after going behind, giving them 27 points from losing positions,\" says Jennifer Peters. \"Is this a record?\" United have also won three games in the Champions League this season after going behind, making a total of 12 wins in all competitions. However, the 27 points they have accrued in the league is not a record. Our friends at Opta tell us that Bobby Robson's swashbuckling Newcastle side picked up 34 points after going behind in 2001-02. In that season they had 10 comeback victories – including three in a memorable week just before Christmas, when they beat Blackburn at home and then overcame their fellow title challengers Arsenal and Leeds at Highbury and Elland Road. The list also included a 4-1 win away to Middlesborough and a 6-2 shellacking of Everton.\n\nManchester United need eight more points to break Newcastle's record. They lie joint second on the list, along with West Brom's 2010-11 side. They also picked up 27 points, most under the management of Roy Hodgson. Who knew Two Banks of Four had such hidden depths?\n\nManchester United's Treble side, who were renowned for their fightbacks, picked up only 18 points in the league after going behind. They did, however, manage one or two vaguely memorable comebacks in the Champions League and FA Cup.\n\nCan you beat Newcastle's record of 34 comeback points? If so, email knowledge@theguardian.com\n\nKNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE\n\n\"When I was at school in the early 80s, I remember our teacher reading us a novel about a future World Cup (I think it was 1998) in which the finalists were Zaire and Iceland,\" recalls Colin Leckey back when there was a Labour government. \"I seem to remember Iceland winning after nobbling Zaire's Pelé-like talisman, who played in bare feet. Have I completely imagined this, or does anyone else recall the book?\"\n\nDon't worry Colin, your mind isn't playing tricks on you. The Ice Warrior, from The Ice Warrior and Other Stories (published 1976) by Robin Chambers, tells how Zaire's star player is killed in a bizarre freezer-related accident. The all-conquering, efficient Iceland (a case of taking symbolism too literally) meet bare-footed and mercurial Zaire in the World Cup final – and the evil Iceland manager plots the downfall of Zaire's star player, Odiwule, who can, apparently, bend the ball 90 degrees. When Zaire are awarded a free-kick, Iceland's equivalent of Douglas Jardine swaps the ball with a special refrigerated one he had been keeping under the team bench (how he did this without anyone else seeing in unclear).\n\nWhen the Zairean maestro strikes the ball his foot and leg shatter (it's those modern boots, you know) and he is killed instantly. The chilly northern cheats win the final. Fast forward 10 years and a vengeful ghost of the victim returns to haunt the Iceland manager, who has, rather unusually, become the county's prime minister.\n\nFor more classic Knowledge, click here.\n\nCAN YOU HELP?\n\n\"Next Saturday, with both teams playing for a place in the play-offs, Cambridge United play Kidderminster Harriers in a promotion six-pointer,\" notes Karl Handy. \"Last September, with the teams both mired in the drop zone, they met in a relegation six-pointer. Has this happened before in the same season and are there any better examples?\"\n\n\"Looking at this season's Capital One Cup, it strikes me as fairly odd (if not completely unique) that Bradford have disposed of three Premier League sides in Arsenal, Wigan and Villa,\" writes Shaun Tooze. \"Has any bottom-tier side in football ever done similar (or better) against top tier sides in a major cup competition before?\"\n\n\"Tottenham have now failed to make an FA Cup final appearance since 1991, during which time they have remained in the English top flight. Has any other team managed remain in the top division while going longer than 22 years without an appearance in the final of the main domestic cup competition?\" muses Paul Fowler."
