        "text": "I always enjoy the Durham County Cup finals. The Challenge Cup is always the one I look forward to the most but I do like the Trophy and Minor Cup too. In the past season or two, more and more Wearside League clubs have entered the Trophy. They used to all enter the Challenge Cup but didn’t normally do very well so a lot of them entered the Trophy where there is a chance of silverware instead. A chance of silverware was proved today was both of these sides are in the Wearside League. Jarrow FC will more or less certainly be promoted to the Northern League last season. It is a ground which needed a lot of work but they seem to have done that work and are now in a position to achieve promotion. They aren’t the force Stockton Town were last season so I’ll be interested to see how they get on in the Northern League next season. This game today was my first of two today. This cup final kicked off at 11am and then I would make my way to Hartlepool to watch them take on Carlisle United. Callum Turnbull was at work today so I managed to get his season ticket for the Hartlepool game and that saved me a few pound.\n\nMatch report:\n\nAshbrooke Belford House come from behind to lift Durham Trophy\n\nAshbrooke Belford House came from behind to beat Jarrow FC in the Durham Trophy final at Eppleton CW on Friday morning.\n\nWith Jarrow clear favourites, it was all following the script when Andrew Wilkinson slotted home in the 32nd minute and the South Tynesiders went into the break with the lead.\n\nHowever, Harry Graham pulled Belford House level three minutes before the hour mark. The goal spurred Belford House on and they cruised to victory with Kieran Stokoe, David Scott and Stephen Bogie all getting on the scoresheet.\n\nIn a competitive start, half chances came at both ends as both sides looked for an early advantage.\n\nThere was no early nerves as both sides piled players forward in search of an opener and that almost came in the 19th minute.\n\nIn the 19th minute, Jarrow’s Jonathan Hirst burst down the wing and whipped a dangerous cross-cum-shot into the penalty area but it just say evaded the far corner.\n\nJarrow were edging possession but good build up play from Belford House saw Stephen Bogie collect possession in the penalty area but he could only drag wide.\n\nA breakthrough was to come in the 32nd minute and it went the way of Jarrow. After working the ball down the wing, a low cross found Wilkinson and he kept his cool to slot home to put Jarrow in front.\n\nThe goal gave Jarrow confidence and they were playing some free-flowing football as they looked to punish Belford House further.\n\nEleven minutes from time, quick one touch football worked the ball to Hirst whose first time effort was saved.\n\nAs Belford House looked for a response, Kyle Summer worked the ball to Bogie but the former Easington Colliery forward couldn’t beat Mark English.\n\nCorey Steel volleyed Belford House’s final chance of the first half wide and Jarrow went into the break with a slender lead.\n\nJarrow looked to double their lead early in the second half and went close when Josh Allan fired not too far wide.\n\nThree minutes before the hour mark, Ashbrooke Belford House pulled level. Graham collected the ball on the edge of the penalty area and looked up before firing a fine effort in off the post from an actue angle to give the ‘keeper no chance.\n\nIt was game on now and Belford House had their heads up.\n\nGraham could have collected his second only two minutes after pulling Belford House level but a superb save from English prevented Graham.\n\nThere was nothing English could do about the next chance though as Belford House took the lead. Stokoe drove a low free-kick into the penalty area and it evaded everyone to nestle into the bottom corner.\n\nNow in full control, Belford House were playing some brilliant football and it was almost 1-3 19 minutes from time but a goal-line clearance prevented a glancing header.\n\nBogie could have wrapped it up as the game approached the final 10 minutes but he could only drag wide after a sharp turn.\n\nBelford House wouldn’t be left to rue on missed chances though as they doubled their lead seven minutes from time with a goal that sealed the win. A low cross found substitute Scott and he kept his cool to fire home.\n\nThe cherry was placed on top of the cake four minutes from time when an exceptional strike from Bogie rounded off a fine morning for the Sunderland outfit. Collecting the ball on the corner of the penalty area, Bogie had little support. He decided to quickly turn and fire an effort which bulleted right into the angle between the post and crossbar.\n\nIt was a fine second half performance from Belford House who now have silverware after a troublesome season.\n\nFull-time: Jarrow FC 1-4 Ashbrooke Belford House\n\nNext up for me is Easington Colliery vs Brandon United tomorrow.\n\nJarrow FC: English, Bone, Burrell, Little, Mellish, Allen (Hutchinson, 8′), Hirst, Graham, Allan (Kirkham, 73′), Kane, Wilkinson (Pressling, 63′)\n\nUnused subs: Smith, Kah\n\nAshbrooke Belford House: Brown, Curry (Green, 84′), Stokoe, Burton, Coomber (Scott, 78′), Burrell, Farquhar, Summer, Bogie, Steel (Fisk, 49’), Graham\n\nUnused subs: Cambell, Bradley\n\nAdmission: £3 adults, £1 concessions\n\nProgramme: Free with admission\n\nAttendance: About 400\n\nReferee: Sam Ross"
