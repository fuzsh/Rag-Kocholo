His name also featured towards the head of the next Glasgow Rangers manager market. The English-born Jansen was raised in Holland and has managed two clubs in that country: Jong PSV, the reserve team of PSV Eindhoven, and AZ Alkmaar, where he had been since 2020 before being dismissed in January 2024.\n\nStephen Robinson\n\nThe Northern Irishman is at St Mirren after previous appointments at Morecambe and Oldham Athletic in England and Motherwell north of the border. It seems strange that his name is featured prominently in the betting as he had never managed a club with the expectations of Sunderland.\n\nRene Maric\n\nAustrian-born Rene Maric has worked at Red Salzburg, Leeds United, Borussia Monchengladbach, Borussia Dortmund, and Bayern Munich. He has mostly been an Assistant Manager.\n\nRaphael Wicky\n\nIn 2009, after retiring from playing, Raphael Wicky became a youth football coach in his birth country, Switzerland. His first full-time managerial position came at Basel in 2017 in the Swiss Super League. From there, he moved to the US, managing the Under 17s national team and then on the Chicago Fire in the MLS. From June 2022 - March 2024, he managed Young Boys back in Switzerland, but is now available.\n\nLiam Rosenior\n\nIn his first permanent position at Hull City, Rosenior impressed with his particular brand of possession football, but the club's owners sacked him after he missed out on the playoffs by just one spot.\n\nDave Challinor\n\nThe Chester-born Challinor has managed four clubs: Colwyn Bay, Hartlepool United, AFC Fylde, and his current club Stockport County. His win percentage rates at all of his clubs are impressive.\n\nKevin Muscat\n\nMuscat played for Crystal Palace. Glasgow Rangers, Wolverhampton Wanderers, and Millwall, but has yet to manage a club in the UK. His managerial career has seen him take charge of teams in Belgium, Australia and Japan. He is currently in charge of the Japanese JI League side Yokohama F. Marinos. He was the favourite to be appointed at Glasgow Rangers in October 2023 prior to Philippe Clement getting the Ibrox vacancy.\n\nPaul Heckingbottom\n\nMost associated with clubs in the north of England, Heckingbottom was sacked by Sheffield United in December 2023. We suspect the Barnsley-born manager is actively looking for an appointment at a Championship club.\n\nAlex Rae\n\nFormer Sunderland midfielder Alex Rae is currently at Glasgow Rangers assisting Philippe Clement. His CV shows he has managed two clubs both in Scotland (Dundee 2006-2008) and St Mirren (2015-2016).\n\nNathan Jones\n\nA candidate for the Sunderland vacancy who is a regular in many next-manager markets. Jones has managed three clubs: Luton Town (twice), Southampton and Stoke City. His spells at Luton were successful, winning promotion for the Hatters from League Two in 2019. His time at the other clubs he managed could have been better, winning just 15% of games at Stoke and lasting only three months at the Saints. He is another manager who in between Mowbray and Beale being sacked took up another managerial position.\n\nFrank Lampard\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Lampard transitioned into management. He started his managerial career at Derby County in the English Championship before moving to Chelsea as their manager in 2019. Due to disappointing results, he was relieved of his duties at Stamford Bridge in January 2021. A year at Everton did not go well; he seemed always under the cosh at Goodison Park before returning to Stamford Bridge as caretaker manager after Graham Potter was dismissed."
