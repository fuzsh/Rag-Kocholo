        "text": "How is your transition to EY going, Timm? Probably the question I heard most this year already and of course happy to share some insights and thoughts. Really appreciate many of you being so curious and still with me and us on this journey üòä (1) There's a great collaboration culture and nice win-win-energy here so far. Really enjoyable and, to be honest, kind of surprising in a way. (2) We are pretty overwhelmed with all sorts of processes, systems, learnings (mandatory ones as well) that don't seem to be too useful or relevant. I guess it's part of the corporate structure, but still a bit annoying coming from a lean startup... (3) There's a huge internal network and expertise, much broader of course, compared to what we had before. This brings nice insights, learning and also opportunities to complement each other. For example with #GenAI or #DigitalTransformation where we could never cover the Tech part ourselves. (4) Specifically for our little Teal Dot & Teal Team, it feels like we are a little island that not many can really understand how we work, but then again grant us autonomy to just 'be' like we are. (5) For the team what I hear most often seems to be that everyone enjoys having an office - not having had that in our whole company history, this is maybe the most striking insights. People enjoy not only f2f connection, but being able to have this a bit less planned and more adhoc via the office. (6) While we don't care so much internally in the team and where we are coming from with our teal/self-org setup, there's quite some tensions coming up with the ranks and levels and the perceived capabilities coming with these (salaries and stuff people don't seem to care about yet, but really the perception of capability is bothering). (7) KPIs and metrics drive behaviours - an old recognition again. Sometimes for the good, sometimes for the bad, but always important to be aware what you measure, why you measure it and if you really want the behaviours that come with it. If not, measure other stuff üòâ I am personally grateful for a ton of learning already in the first 2 months, some great connections, a lot of support from so many people and really nice opportunities to grow and extend what we have been delivering for clients before. Conclusion is, I guess: I am still somehow in between worlds, or maybe in both worlds at the same time, but it's an enjoyable ride so far! I will keep sharing how the experience and journey unfolds üôÇ (big thanks üôè go to Dr. Katharina Luh, Michael Seemann, Simon Olive, Christine Vogel, Ren√© Wagener, Silke Karin Pilger, Sofia Stavri and especially Balazs Hargitai, but really so many more!) #first2months #transition #transformation #newlife #humansatthecenter\n\nToday one year ago was a pretty life-changing day. I didn't know at the time, it was just really nice to meet Balazs Hargitai, PhD and chat a bit about the good old times üòÄ Turns out that just today after this chat we started exploring a whole new chapter for me and the team. Balazs send some internal emails at EY... And what should I say? One year later we're a happy part of EY in Switzerland, bringing our Teal ideas to the world - both internally and externally üöÄ It's, no doubt, a huge change for me and the team, but we're intergrating super well and actually just have a great time. Here's some reflections why: 1. We spent 5 offsites and endless other internal meetings mid last year to talk about the option to make this move and change. All the team was involved, everyone had a voice and everyone had TIME to think about it, let it sink in and maybe also grief to be open for the new! 2. We evaluated what we anticipated to be advantages and trade-offs, knowing that there's never a perfect setup. Not in a startup, not in a big corporate. Everything got it's time and place, but we've taken a conscious decision (together!). 3. We talked to many people - outside-in inspiration is something I always recommend our clients to do, and here it paid off well. We talked to folks at EY who were not part of the official process, we talked to ex-EY, we talked to other Big4, we talked to clients. It was great insights and certainly a big part of the success of #2. 4. We tackled the integration and transition time with a light and fun mindset, with an explorative mind and curiosity. There's always something to learn :-) I guess the only thing I keep hearing is the question if I now only wear suits...well, the answer is no üòÇ But after Covid, I like my teal jacket actually and enjoy walking it into the world. Looking forward to your thoughts or questions on this one! Or just if you like my Teal jacket (which I had before EY times already üòã ) #change #transition #humansatcenter\n\nThe first lie about work: \"People care which company they work for.\" In the thought-provoking book \"Nine Lies About Work\" by Marcus Buckingham and Ashley Goodall, the first lie they address is the belief that people primarily care about the company they work for. However, it refutes this by stating that the true relevance lays in the power of each team. One month ago, I embarked on an exciting new journey as a manager in the PwC‚Äôs AC Deployment Enablement Team. As we began building our new team including US, Argentina and Mexico I couldn't help but reflect on the profound impact of working with a good team, especially in a virtual environment. In this month, I have witnessed firsthand how the power of the synergy, creativity, and camaraderie help us leverage our collective strengths to overcome challenges, innovate, and deliver exceptional value to our stakeholders. As professionals, let us recognize the true significance of building and working with trusting and motivated team. It is not just about the company we work for, but the people we work alongside that shape our experience and drive our success. Together, we can achieve extraordinary things and make a meaningful impact. #TeamBuilding #Collaboration #NineLiesAboutWork #PwCAC #ProfessionalGrowth\n\nToday marks my one year anniversary leading this brilliant team at EY. And what a year it's been. Professional services is unlike any other business environment I've ever worked in. A co-operative or 1000's of entrepreneurs, the pace of change and the drive to do more never takes a breath. Someone, somewhere is always trying something new - looking to move things forward another important step for the business, our clients or the communities we serve. It's why when colleagues say it can take a full year to feel like you really understand EY, they're only partly joking. To wrap arms around all of this energy, innovation and movement and seek some consistent stories to tell to an external audience is no easy task. (And by no means is it one we have cracked just yet.) But, one year in (I hope, the first of many) I can see the path we're on and the destination we're heading for - and I like the look of both. Curveballs will arrive without doubt. And brand new questions will arise but I look forward to that, knowing I work surrounded by the very best people to help answer them. A massive thank you to my incredible team for all your support so far, and to colleagues across the business for your time, patience, challenge and inspiration. If year one was about understanding this business, year two is all about helping audiences across the world to do the same. Let's get to work. #ThatswhyEY #employerbrand #employerbranding"
