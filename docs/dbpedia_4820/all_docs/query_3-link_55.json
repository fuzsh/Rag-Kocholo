Can you imagine Cloughy having to deal with the power the pampered players have today.\n\nI'm no expert on all things Sunderland but at a guess it's because because Revie was a cheating bribing tw@t and Bob Stokoe was one of the main sources of that info\n\nWhy has Mirror scoop on Don Revie been airbrushed from history?\n\nA bad omission in the Sunday Telegraph's article on disgraced former England football manager\n\nKen Jones: Bob Stokoe: a paragon of football's old-fashioned values\n\nObituaries on Bob Stokoe retold for the thousandth time the tale of Sunderland's remarkable victory over Leeds United in the 1973 FA Cup final barely six months after 10 straight defeats threatened them with relegation from the old Second Division. Chances are they set some readers to musing on...\n\n\"When Stokoe was cutting his teeth in football management at Bury he fell out with Don Revie, who was beginning to shape an outstanding career at Leeds. Facing up to the bleak prospect of relegation, Revie offered Stokoe a sum of money to take things easy in a match at Gigg Lane. Revie was told what he could do with the bribe, and the two men never spoke again. \"I'd heard of such things happening but I couldn't believe it was being put to me,\" Stokoe said one night in the long ago. \"\n\nThe incident was embedded so deep in Stokoe's mind that a number of years later, as manager of Blackpool, he was reluctant to agree a deal with Leeds for a talented Scottish international inside-forward Tony Green, who eventually joined Newcastle United. \"I tried to get Liverpool interested,\" he told me. \"When Bill Shankly asked me why I was set against the offer from Leeds I told him about the thing with Revie at Bury. Bill went silent. I don't think he ever again saw Revie in the same light.\"\n\nI could only take Stokoe's word for this but matters moved on when allegations of bribery, mainly involving a match against Wolverhampton Wanderers, were levelled at Leeds in 1973, leading to a probe by the Daily Mirror whose hard-bitten investigative team sought my assistance on the basis of what they assumed to be a friendship with Revie. As an employee of the Sunday Mirror I was obliged to give the investigators some time but I chose not to pass on things I had been told. One of their questions concerned Stokoe's feelings about Revie, another the 4-0 victory Leeds suspiciously gained at Sunderland a few days after failing to enlist his co-operation at Bury.\n\nCloughie made it known how much he liked us. When he was injured it was people like John Watters who kept him going. He lived in Zion St in Fulwell. He was too strong-minded for our directors when he wanted the job. They were scared of him. I heard one say \"You know he doesn't let Directors travel on the team coach!\" He endered himslef to the fans with his goal-scoring and his desire to be manager and for that he will always be quite rightly revered.\n\nRevie was manager when Collins destroyed the career of Willie McPheat. Alan brown shouted from the Directors' Box \"Deliberate!\" as he ran down to the pitch. That was the start of our dislike of Leeds United. The team was hard and dirty but most clubs had a player like that. I was luicky enough to work at both clubs for a long time. I found Revie to be well-mannered and nice enoigh to talk to. The players were just like playersa at any club. Most of them were just happy to be getting paid to do something they enjoyed. Edie Gray, Paul Madeley ad all were good people. The stand out one for me was a man I got to know quite well and went to his home. He woould always say that Sunderland Football Club was a great club and a proper footbal club. He praised indivudual players who he played against- Charlie, Monty, Mulhall, Harvey - all great players. Who was he? - Billy Bremner. I can only speak as I find. Bob Stokoe quite rightly had little time for Revie like a few people in the game did. I liked Bob very much - a genteman and a great man to work with.\n\nI'm too young to have seen them manage but I've never quite understood why Sunderland Fans and ( the whole nation in fact) never gave Don Revie the full respect he deserved.\n\nBoth done well in their playing career for the lads.

Can you imagine Cloughy having to deal with the power the pampered players have today.\n\nBrian Clough was a friend of my father.\n\nHis team's achieved success fairly and thoroughly respected the rules and the officials.\n\nDon Revie, like Jimmy Hill, was a cheating bastard.\n\nHope this answers your question.\n\nI'm too young to have seen them manage but I've never quite understood why Sunderland Fans and ( the whole nation in fact) never gave Don Revie the full respect he deserved.\n\nBoth done well in their playing career for the lads.
