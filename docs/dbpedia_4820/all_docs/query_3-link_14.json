Ajit Sane, Director of IT M&A at Aligent, joins us to shift perceptions so we can see these transactions as a positive aspect of good corporate hygiene. #cpa #accounting #cpe #divestitures #carveout #spinoff\n\nThe great \"reshuffle\" in professional services and accounting sector continues. I've been aware of these discussions for a while and this one actually makes sense - Forvis get essential international outlet into Europe and Mazars get access to North America. At $4.5b (the magic number for scalability) this may be getting presented as a merger of two Firms but its not. Its the creation of another new International member Firm network. #professionalservices #accountingservices #strategicexecution Mazars FORVIS"
