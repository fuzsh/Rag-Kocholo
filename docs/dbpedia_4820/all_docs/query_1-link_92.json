        "text": "Shoot\n\nTyne Tees Television (North East) Football Highlights 1962-83\n\nThe North East was the 2nd ITV region to begin regular football highlights which they originally showed in a 30 minute slot on Saturday nights before expanding to 55 minutes on Sunday afternoon's, but it wasn't until 1977 that the programme included the added attraction of a 2nd and 3rd match covered by the other region's - Presentation was moved from the ground to the studio that same year.\n\nThe Tyne Tees region's league teams 1962-1983\n\nNewcastle United, Sunderland, Middlesbrough*, Darlington and Hartlepools United.\n\n*Yorkshire Television cameras would also turn up at Ayresome Park, although by 1978 they appeared to have conceded that Middlesbrough were a Tyne Tees club. York City were paid a visit by Tyne Tees cameras in 1974 but other than that they were left to Yorkshire TV.\n\nTyne Tees commentators and presenters\n\n1962 - Mid 1960's and 1970/71\n\nThe original face of Shoot, George Taylor was still presenting the programme when its' 21 year run came to and end in 1983, he had also served as the regular commentator until 1970 and continued to voice the odd match until 1973/74.\n\nMid 1960's - 1970*\n\nGeorge Bayley - originally a golf correspondent who became better known nationally as the North East football correspondent for BBC Radio's Sports Report. He also hosted Radio Newcastle's Sports coverage.\n\n*There was also an Australian commentator working for Tyne Tees around this time.\n\n1971 - May 1973\n\nDavid Taylor - Like Gerry Harrison at Anglia, Taylor had been a runner-up in the BBC's \"Find a commentator\" competition in 1969, he later narrated for Granada TV's World In Action documentary series.\n\n?August 1973? - May 1974\n\nJeff Thomas - apparently from the Republic of Ireland.\n\nAugust 1974 - May 1979\n\nKenneth Wolstenholme was 54 when he joined Tyne Tees having been the voice of the BBC's televised football in the 1950's and '60's. A former RAF Bomber pilot during the 2nd World War, the Lancashire born Bolton fan joined BBC Television in 1948 and went on to describe 23 successive FA Cup finals and 5 World Cup tournaments, including England's triumphant 1966 success in which he delivered the most famous commentary soundbite of all time. His final commentary for the BBC was the 1971 European Cup Final and following his 5 year stint at Tyne Tees he went into semi-retirement before making a comeback with Channel 4 - reporting on their Italian League coverage. He died in 2002 at the age of 81.\n\nMarch 1979 - May 1983\n\nRoger Tames first joined Tyne Tees in 1976 as a reporter from the Dagenham Post, the Arsenal fan commentated on a couple of matches for Shoot towards the end of the 1978/79 season before taking over full-time from the start of 1979/80, he continued to work for the station long after the end of Shoot in 1983 - presenting the last ever local ITV sports production (Soccer Night) in May 2008.\n\nWhat matches were shown\n\nThe following lists detail all the known matches recorded by Tyne Tees cameras for local highlights, the re-edits of other region's matches are not included here (see the other region's pages for those). Given dates are for when the fixture was played (not the broadcast). Blanks* denote that we don't know what game was shown (if one was shown at all). Tyne Tees sometimes showed LWT's The Big Match if their sole ob unit had been required for horse racing, winter postponements may have forced them to occasionally schedule an alternate non-football programme. Known mid-week & pre-season North East matches (not necessarily aired under the title Shoot) are included in grey, networked ITV coverage of other matches of interest are in italics.\n\n*Do please e-mail [email protected] if you are able to fill in any blanks/missing scorers.\n\nSeason 1962/63\n\nAll Tyne Tees highlights were broadcast in 405-line black & white on VHF only throughout the 1960's.\n\n26/Dec Possibly Sunderland 0 Bury 1 *a clip of Brian Clough's knee injury looks like TV film\n\n18/May Sunderland 0 Chelsea 1 *footage exists with commentary\n\nThe region's trio of big clubs were all in the 2nd tier at the time Tyne Tees began broadcasting football highlights. Alan Brown's Sunderland missed out on promotion in 1963 due to a poorer goal average than Chelsea. Middlesbrough, who replaced manager Bob Dennison with Raich Carter in January, were one place further behind in 4th with Alan Peacock rattling in 31 goals. Newcastle, now managed by Joe Harvey, finished 7th. In the Fourth Division Darlington were 12th whilst Hartlepools finished rock bottom of the 92.\n\nSeason 1963/64\n\n04/Sep Newcastle United 2 (Penman, McGarry) Middlesbrough 0 *played on a Wednesday night, highlights probably broadcast the following night\n\n18/Sep Sunderland 1 (Crossan) Scunthorpe United 0 *another Wednesday night fixture with highlights probably shown on the Thursday\n\n14/Nov Sunderland v Benfica [Friendly] *footage exists with commentary\n\n21/Mar Sunderland 4 (Sharkey 2, Crossan, Mulhall) Preston North End 0 *footage exists with commentary\n\n04/Apr Sunderland 1 (Usher) Swansea Town 0 *footage exists with commentary\n\nSunderland won promotion as runners-up but then came the surprise departure of manager Alan Brown, Newcastle finished 8th, Middlesbrough 10th.\n\nSeason 1964/65\n\n??/Aug Darlington v Carlisle United [Friendly]\n\n??/Aug Sunderland v Huddersfield Town [Friendly]\n\n22/Aug Intended match was Sunderland 3 Leicester City 3, but a problem with a new ob unit resulted in a blank tape!\n\n24/Aug Newcastle United 1 (Hilley) Charlton Athletic 1 (????) *played on a Monday (Bank Holiday presumably)\n\n29/Aug\n\n05/Sep\n\n09/Sep Sunderland 2 Aston Villa 2\n\n12/Sep\n\n19/Sep Sunderland 1 (Sharkey) Blackburn Rovers 0 *listed in the Times, no surviving footage\n\n21/Sep Hartlepools United 1 Torquay United 0 *Monday night match, probably shown on Tuesday\n\n26/Sep Newcastle United 5 (McGarry 2, Cummings, Hilley, ???(og)) Preston North End 2 (????, ????) *Times/no footage\n\n30/Sep Sunderland 4 West Ham United 1 [League Cup 2nd Round]\n\n03/Oct Hartlepools United 1 Millwall 0 *Times/no footage\n\n10/Oct Newcastle United 5 (Iley, Robson 2, Anderson 2) Leyton Orient 0 *footage exists with commentary\n\n17/Oct Sunderland 0 Fulham 0 *Times/no footage\n\n24/Oct Middlesbrough 2 Norwich City 0 *Newcastle United 2 Crystal Palace 0 is listed in the Times\n\n31/Oct Sunderland 2 Stoke City 2 *Times/no footage\n\n07/Nov Newcastle United 3 (Suddick, Iley, McGarry) Rotherham United 1 (????) *Middlesbrough 4 Swansea Town 0 is listed in the Times\n\n14/Nov Sunderland 3 Burnley 2 *Times/no footage\n\n21/Nov Middlesbrough 4 Swindon Town 1 *Newcastle United 2 Derby County 2 is listed in the Times\n\n28/Nov Sunderland 4 (Hood, Sharkey, Herd, Mulhall) Everton 0 *Times/no footage\n\n05/Dec Newcastle United 3 (Hockey, Iley, Anderson) Portsmouth 0 *Middlesbrough 0 Manchester City 1 is listed in the Times\n\n12/Dec Newcastle United 5 Northampton Town 0 *Times/no footage\n\n19/Dec Sunderland 3 Chelsea 0 *Times/no footage\n\n26/Dec\n\n28/Dec Newcastle United 2 (Hilley 2) Middlesbrough 1 (????) *Bank Holiday Monday fixture\n\n02/Jan Newcastle United 2 Huddersfield Town 1 *Times/no footage\n\n09/Jan *Billed as 'Cup Tie Special'\n\n16/Jan Sunderland 0 Arsenal 2\n\n23/Jan Newcastle United 2 (Hilley, Anderson) Cardiff City 0 *Middlesbrough v Preston North End is listed in the Times\n\n30/Jan *Billed as 'Cup Tie Special'\n\n06/Feb\n\n13/Feb Middlesbrough 1 Plymouth Argyle 3*Newcastle United v Ipswich Town is listed in the Times\n\n20/Feb\n\n27/Feb Newcastle United 2 Bury 3 *footage exists with commentary\n\n06/Mar Whitley Bay 1 Hendon 3 [Amateur Cup QF] *Sunderland v Nottingham Forest is listed in the Times\n\n13/Mar Middlesbrough 3 Rotherham United 5 *Newcastle United v Norwich City is listed in the Times\n\n20/Mar Sunderland 2 Tottenham Hotspur 1 *Times/no footage\n\n27/Mar Whitby Town 2 Enfield 1 [Amatuer Cup SF] *at Roker Park\n\n03/Apr Sunderland 3 Sheffield United 1 *Times/no footage\n\n10/Apr Newcastle United 1 Swindon Town 0 *Times/no footage\n\n17/Apr No programme billed this weekend\n\n19/Apr Middlesbrough 2 Leyton Orient 0 *A Monday night match, Middlesbrough needing points to avoid relegation\n\n24/Apr Whitby Town 1 Hendon 3 [Amateur Cup Final] *at Wembley, complete show archived but was not titled \"Shoot\" - Middlesbrough v Charlton is listed in Times.\n\n01/May Networked LIVE coverage of the FA Cup Final - Liverpool 2 (Hunt, St.John) Leeds United 1 (Bremner) AET\n\nGeorge Hardwick managed Sunderland for this one season only and the team finished 15th in their first term back in the top flight, Newcastle would be joining them next season after being crowned champions of the 2nd tier. Middlesbrough finished 17th.\n\nSeason 1965/66\n\nThere was a dispute between the Football League and the TV companies at the beginning of this season, highlights returned to BBC2 on 02/Oct and to ITV channels a week later.\n\n14/Sep Middlesbrough 3 Ipswich Town 2 *probably a newsreel\n\n23/Oct Newcastle United 0 Tottenham Hotspur 0 *listed in the Times, no surviving footage\n\n30/Oct Sunderland 3 Northampton Town 0 *Times/no footage\n\n13/Nov Sunderland 0 Burnley 4 *Times/no footage\n\n20/Nov Newcastle United 1 Leicester City 5 *Times/no footage\n\n27/Nov Darlington 3 Rochdale 1 *Times/no footage\n\n04/Dec Middlesbrough 1 Coventry City 1\n\n18/Dec Newcastle United 0 Liverpool 0 *First complete \"Shoot\" known to be archived\n\n16/Mar Networked Tyne Tees coverage of Football League v Scottish League [Friendly Match] *Commentator John Camkin\n\nNewcastle were this season's highest placed local club in 15th with Sunderland, now under Ian McColl, in 19th. In the 2nd tier, struggling Middlesbrough sacked Raich Carter and replaced him with Stan Anderson but the club were still relegated to the 3rd tier for the first time in their history. There was better news from the 4th tier where Darlington were promoted as runners-up. At the age of just 30, ex Sunderland player Brian Clough was appointed manager of Hartlepools in October and they finished 18th.\n\nSeason 1966/67\n\n25/Mar Sunderland 0 Everton 2\n\nSunderland and Newcastle again did little more than survive in the top flight in 17th and 20th place respectively. Middlesbrough immediately bounced back from relegation by taking the runners-up spot in the 3rd tier and 27 of their goals were scored by John O'Rourke, but Darlington were swiftly relegated back down to the basement league. Hartlepools improved to finish 8th but at the end of the season Brian Clough left to manage Derby County.\n\nSeason 1967/68\n\n11/May Newcastle United 3 (Robson, Sinclair, McNamee) Manchester City 4 (Sumerbee, Young 2, Lee) *commentator was George Bayley\n\nNewcastle managed a top half finish - 10th, Sunderland were 15th with manger Ian McColl departing in February prompting the return of Alan Brown. Back in the 2nd tier Middlesbrough finished 6th and had the division's leading scorer in John Hickton with 24 goals. Down in the 4th tier, Hartlepools United won promotion for the first time since joining the Football league in 1921 and they would now drop the 's' and 'United' from their name to become known as merely 'Hartlepool'. Darlington reached the Quarter-finals of the League Cup losing 5-4 away at Derby.\n\nSeason 1968/69\n\n10/Aug Newcastle United 1 (B.

Newcastle also lifted silverware in the form of the Anglo-Italian Trophy by beating Fiorentina 2-1 in Florence, the Magpies had finished 9th in the league. In the 2nd tier Middlesbrough finished 4th having changed manager in January, Harold Sheperdson took charge until the end of the season following Stan Anderson's resignation. It was another poor season for the region's 4th tier clubs with Hartlepool 20th and Darlington rock bottom of the entire Football league.\n\nSeason 1973/74\n\n25/Aug\n\n01/Sep Newcastle United 1 (McDermott) Arsenal 1 (George)\n\n08/Sep Sunderland 1 (Guthrie) Cardiff City 1 (Vincent)\n\n15/Sep\n\n22/Sep\n\n29/Sep Newcastle United 2 (Tudor 2) Queens Park Rangers 3 (Thomas, Francis, Leach)\n\n06/Oct Sunderland 3 (Hughes, Porterfield, Halom) Sheffield Wednesday 1 (Coyle)\n\n13/Oct\n\n20/Oct Newcastle United 2 (Macdonald 2(1pen)) Chelsea 0\n\n27/Oct\n\n03/Nov Middlesbrough 2 (Foggon, Armstrong) Luton Town 1 (Butlin)\n\n10/Nov\n\n17/Nov Newcastle United 3 (Cassidy 2, Hope) Manchester United 2 (Macari, Graham)\n\n24/Nov\n\n01/Dec\n\n08/Dec\n\n15/Dec Middlesbrough 1 (Boam) Nottingham Forest 0\n\n22/Dec\n\n29/Dec\n\n05/Jan Newcastle United 1 (Howard) Hendon 1 (Haider) [FA Cup 3rd Round]\n\n12/Jan\n\n19/Jan\n\n26/Jan Newcastle United 1 (McDermott) Scunthorpe United 1 (Keeley) [FA Cup 4th Round]\n\n02/Feb Sunderland 4 (Halom 2, Hughes 2) Millwall 0\n\n09/Feb Newcastle United 5 (Craven(og), Bruce, Dugdale(og), Tudor, Macdonald) Coventry City 1 (Alderson)\n\n16/Feb [FA Cup 5th Round]\n\n23/Feb\n\n02/Mar Networked LWT coverage of the League Cup Final - Wolves 2 (Hibbitt, Richards) Manchester City 1 (Bell)\n\n09/Mar Newcastle United 4 (Craig, McDermott(pen), Tudor, Moncur) Nottingham Forest 3 (Bowyer, O'Kane, Lyall) [FA Cup QF]\n\n16/Mar Sunderland 1 (Longhorn) Fulham 0\n\n23/Mar\n\n30/Mar Networked coverage of Newcastle United 2 (Macdonald 2) Burnley 0 [FA Cup SF] *at Hillsborough\n\n06/Apr Middlesbrough 4 (Hickton, Needham(og), Armstrong, Foggon) Notts County 0\n\n13/Apr\n\n20/Apr Newcastle United 1 (Robson) Birmingham City 1 (Francis)\n\n27/Apr Possibly showed Yorkshire coverage of York City 1 (Jones) Oldham Athletic 1 (Whittle)\n\n01/May \"Charlton's Champions\" (A Wednesday night Tyne Tees Special programme celebrating Middlesbrough's promotion)\n\n04/May Networked LIVE coverage of the FA Cup Final - Newcastle United 0 Liverpool 3 (Keegan 2, Heighway)\n\nNewcastle were no-doubt doubly determined to make an impression in the FA Cup this season following their neighbours success the previous year, United had won the cup three times during the 1950's but it had now been over 12 years since they had even reached the last eight. 1974 almost proved to be Newcastle's year in a run which included an extraordinary Quarter-final tie v Nottingham Forest which Newcastle won 4-3, but only after a pitch invasion had interrupted play when United went 3-1 down to a hotly contested penalty which resulted in Pat Howard being sent off. Despite Newcastle playing on with 10 men the FA decided that the pitch invasion had influenced the result and the match had to be replayed, the re-match at a neutral venue was drawn before Newcastle went through at the 3rd attempt and went on to beat Burnley in the Semi-final, but at Wembley they came up against a Liverpool side in dazzling form and in a one sided final Newcastle were soundly beaten 3-0. In the league, Newcastle finished 15th. England World Cup 1966 hero Jack Charlton was the new manager of 2nd tier Middlesbrough and he guided them to a Championship winning campaign. Sunderland were 6th but only two points short of a promotion place, the Rokerites cup success of the previous season had also earned them a place in Europe to compete in the Cup-winners Cup, they overcame Vasas Budapest in the opening round and then beat Sporting Lisbon 2-1 at Roker Park but lost the 2nd leg 2-0. It was now three up/three down between the top three divisions and fringe Tyne Tees club York City were one of those benefiting from the new rule as they claimed promotion by finishing 3rd in the Third tier. In the Fourth Division Hartlepool finished 11th (manager Len Ashurst was then tempted away to manage elsewhere), Darlington were 20th.\n\nSeason 1974/75\n\n17/Aug\n\n24/Aug Middlesbrough 1 (Mills) Luton Town 1 (Butlin) *Ken Wolstenholme now commentating for Tyne Tees\n\n31/Aug Newcastle United 2 (Tudor, Macdonald) West Ham United 0\n\n07/Sep Middlesbrough 1 (Maddren) Chelsea 1 (Hutchinson)\n\n14/Sep Newcastle United 1 (Tudor) Carlisle United 0\n\n21/Sep Sunderland 0 Bolton Wanderers 0\n\n28/Sep\n\n05/Oct Sunderland 2 (Robson 2) Oxford United 0\n\n12/Oct York City 3 (Seal 2, Hinch) Bristol Rovers 0 *One source says Darlington 0 Barnsley 0\n\n19/Oct Middlesbrough 4 (Souness 2, Mills, Foggon) Coventry City 4 (Stein, Cross, Holmes 2)\n\n26/Oct\n\n02/Nov Hartlepool 3 (Gauden 2, Dawes) Workington 0\n\n09/Nov\n\n12/Nov Hartlepool 1 (Moore) Aston Villa 1 (Aitken) [League Cup 4th Round] *Probably Gerald Sinstadt commentating, Villa won replay 6-1\n\n16/Nov Newcastle United 5 (Cannell, Macdonald 2, Kennedy, Barrowclough) Chelsea 0\n\n23/Nov\n\n30/Nov Newcastle United 2 (Macdonald, Howard) Manchester City 1 (Marsh)\n\n04/Dec Probably showed YTV coverage of Middlesbrough 0 Manchester United 0 [League Cup QF] *'Boro lost replay 3-0\n\n07/Dec Sunderland 4 (Halom, Hughes(og), Malone, Robson) Portsmouth 1 (Mellows)\n\n11/Dec Newcastle United 3 (Tudor, Bruce, Cannell) Southampton 0 AET [Texaco Cup Final 2nd Leg] *4-2 on agg, Gerald Sinstadt commentated\n\n14/Dec Middlesbrough 3 (Foggon, Hickton, Page) Birmingham City 0\n\n21/Dec Newcastle United 3 (Tudor, Kennedy, Howard) Leeds United 0\n\n28/Dec\n\n04/Jan [FA Cup 3rd Round]\n\n11/Jan\n\n18/Jan\n\n25/Jan [FA Cup 4th Round]\n\n01/Feb Newcastle United 2 (Macdonald, Burns) Middlesbrough 1 (Hickton)\n\n08/Feb Sunderland 3 (Towers(pen), Morgan(og), Robson) Cardiff City 1 (Anderson)\n\n15/Feb [FA Cup 5th Round]\n\n22/Feb\n\n01/Mar Networked LWT coverage of the League Cup Final - Aston Villa 1 (Graydon) Norwich City 0\n\n08/Mar\n\n15/Mar Possibly showed YTV coverage of Middlesbrough 3 (Hickton, Souness 2) Tottenham Hotspur 0\n\n22/Mar\n\n29/Mar Middlesbrough 2 (Murdoch, Foggon) Burnley 0\n\n05/Apr Probably LWT coverage of Fulham 1 (Mitchell) Birmingham City 1 (Gallagher) [FA Cup SF]\n\n12/Apr Darlington 2 (Cattrell, Sinclair) Mansfield Town 1 (Clarke)\n\n19/Apr Sunderland 3 (Bolton, Robson, Belfitt) Bristol City 0\n\n26/Apr\n\n03/May Networked LIVE coverage of the FA Cup Final - West Ham United 2 (A.Taylor 2) Fulham 0\n\nBack in the top flight, Middlesbrough finished a creditable 7th and threatened to make it a successive hat-trick of North East clubs reaching the FA Cup final, but 'Boro lost 1-0 at Birmingham in the Quarter-finals, they also reached the last eight of the League Cup - only to be knocked out by Manchester United in an Old Trafford replay.

In the 2nd tier, just weeks into the season, Newcastle sacked Bill McGarry, his replacement was Arthur Cox and United finished 11th.

Despite last season's relegation, Bobby Murdoch kept his job at Middlesbrough but only until the end of September, Malcom Allison arrived a month later but 'Boro sunk to an alarming 16th placed finish.
