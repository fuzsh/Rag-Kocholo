        "text": "As we all say a very fond farewell to our beloved Bootham Crescent, I am shamelessly going to recall the highlight of my sporting life. Playing in goal for York City reserves in May 1982 against Doncaster Rovers. To play at BC and represent the club Ive supported since 1973 was and still is, one of the best days of my life. To make it more of an unforgettable day, although we lost 2-0, the first goal was scored by Billy Bremner and the second by Steve Lister (who later played for City in a loan spell). Thanks to Shane Winship who got me the gig, and the photos from Ray Wynn that I am so grateful he took. Sometimes dreams do come true!\n\n\"Farewell To Bootham Crescent\", by Jiggerypoetry, commissioned by Radio York\n\nFrom footplate of bus and from platform of station,\n\nThrough Saturday lunchtimes acclimatisation,\n\nThe scarved and bob-capped from days gone and present\n\nHave strode through our streets to the lights of the crescent.\n\nOn weekdays and weekends our action replay;\n\nDevoted, uncoated from August to May.\n\nWe chanted their names and we sang for the team;\n\nWe watched from the wings as they lived out our dream.\n\nFor this is the place where Wilkinson, Storey\n\nAnd Bottom and Fenton took City to glory:\n\nIn 55 Blanchflower, Ramsey were gone\n\nAs we rolled over Spurs in the Cup, 3-1.\n\nIn 48, Patrick, v Rotherham hit five\n\nAs the red and white thousands in here came alive.\n\nThose epic encounters when Liverpool came,\n\nAnd the back from the brink in that Southampton game.\n\nAnd that icy last minute with hearts in a knot,\n\nAs the ball took its place on the penalty spot.\n\nWhen the Crescent grew hushed and the Arsenal did quake\n\nAnd Houchen rolled in and made this old ground shake.\n\nLets remember the men who anointed this turf:\n\nFrom Forgan, MacMillan, through David McGurk.\n\nThe good on the deck and the great in the air -\n\nSee Boyer and Burrows and Parslow and Blair\n\nThe soldiers supreme that were glued to the ball:\n\nCanham and Creswell and Bishop and Hall.\n\nAnd the boys in the dug-outs behind all the thrills:\n\nWorthington, Lockie, Dennis Smith, Gary Mills.\n\nAnd this is the place where wed curse or discuss:\n\nThe three in attack or the parking the bus.\n\nThe tip of a diamond, the man-to-man marking,\n\nThe roaring, the shouting, the growling, the barking\n\nThe chipping, the bending, the lobbing and curling;\n\nThe scarves and the flags and the banners unfurling.\n\nThe spins and the grins and the tricks and flicks\n\nAnd the tap-ins, the clapping, the overhead kicks.\n\nThe chanting and ranting, the whinging and moaning;\n\nThe car journey home and the radio phone-in.\n\nFor here on this ground are the fakes and the feins,\n\nAnd the race down the flanks and the rush in our veins\n\nThe tackles, the barges, the trips and the slides -\n\nAnd the ghosts and the glides and the never off-sides.\n\nThis is the place where the mud and the sweat\n\nGave us just past the post or a bulge in the net.\n\nAnd this is the place that thumps its own chest,\n\nThat looks to the future and kisses its crest.\n\nAnd as day turns to dark and the floodlights grow dim\n\nAnd the shutters are drawn and the shadows move in.\n\nAs the kit bags are packed and the boot room is cleared,\n\nWhen the fans and the players have long disappeared.\n\nAs the lines on the overgrown grass start to fade\n\nAnd the hard hats move in with the pick and the spade,\n\nWell roll up our programmes and save souvenirs\n\nAnd well look to the future through eyes full of tears\n\nAnd the songs from the stands will ring in our ears\n\nAs the whistle blows time on our eighty-eight years.\n\nBye Bye Bootham\n\nChuitar remembered Bootham Crescent in Bye Bye Bootham to the tune of The Stone Roses \"Bye Bye Badman\".\n\nFarewell\n\nNo real chance to say goodbye, people attending the last game didn't know it was the last game and the last 2 games postponed.\n\nAway Games\n\nWigan 2 City 5. Two of Wigan's old codgers praising their side in the first half as they lead City by 1-0. We changed ends at half time and ended up winning 5-2. Always wondered what they had to say at full time\n\nPort Vale away, their fans ran at us but XLB shook his wooden leg at them\n\nSpending the whole game in Millwalls old Den ground as the only City supporter constantly looking over my shoulder for the Millwall crew after Steve Senior had blown my cover during the pre match warm up\n\nWembley, Old Trafford, Highbury, Craven Cottage, Kenilworth Road (several times) and many more."
