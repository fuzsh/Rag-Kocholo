        "text": "HOW IT ALL BEGAN! Never on a Sunday\n\nSeason 1967\n\nDurham and District Sunday Football League\n\nNever on a Sunday had been attitude of the Durham Football Association. The Secretary at the Time Mr J. B. Blenkinsop was totally against Sunday Morning Football, but he felt he was forced into allowing Sunday Morning Football because the Durham Football Association had now accepted affiliation Fees from Sunday Morning Clubs.\n\nThe League began approximately two years before its inception, with players joining to forms 'teams' that just played friendly games each week on the local parks. It was in July 1966 that the Durham and District Sunday Morning League was formed.\n\nThe Durham Football Association would not sanction Sunday Football, but at a meeting in July 1966 Sunday Football appeared from the shadows and gained recognition from the Durham Football Association.\n\nAt a Durham Football Association council meeting on the 1st of July. Mr George Todd from Darlington had expressed his distaste for Sunday Football but added it is here to stay. Mr Jackson proposed that they organise a Sunday Cup Competition for affiliated Sunday Teams, this would be discussed at the next Meeting of the Durham Football Association Council. The Same meeting admonished a further 16 players several of them Northern League players, who have been playing in unaffiliated Sunday football. The Players who were dealt with were Charles Blythe (Washington), George Brown (Crook), Mel Brown (Mercantile Marine), Tom Cooney (Even wood) , George Elliott (Washington), Joh Gittens (Spennymoor), Ken Grant , (Evenwood), Harry Hunt (Tow Law), Keith Hylton (Crook), Malcolm Leask ,( Mercantile Marine), Steve Myers (Tow Law), Mike Robson (South Shields), James Simpson (Tow Law), George Carr (Silksworth) .All received fines for playing unaffiliated football on Sunday mornings.\n\nAt the Time of the Meeting Sunday Affiliated Football was being played in Teesside and Darlington, The South Shields Sunday Football League and the Hartlepool Sunday League were not affiliated but would be soon. The Football Association had shown few signs that they were prepared to recognise Sunday football. Pitches were only available on a week –to-week basis- which meant club secretaries had to be quick off the mark to ‘phone the Parks Department to obtain one of the few pitches available.\n\nIn September of the same year The Durham Football Association Council met again and decided to organise a Sunday Football Cup Competition this was proposed by Mr Jack Ison. The council felt their hands had been forced, because they accepted affiliation fees from Sunday Clubs, they should on principle provide them with a Sunday Cup. The Council decided that all affiliated Sunday clubs would enter the cup competition but applications for exemption would be accepted.\n\nThe Travellers Rest Football Team from Belmont and Durham Press Joined forces in December 1966 in a bid to attract local clubs who were playing friendlies on a Sunday morning to a meeting in the Travellers Rest, Broomside Lane Belmont on Friday 16th December. Tony Nichols the Manager of the Travellers Rest Football Team said ‘we have invited club secretaries to a meeting at the Travellers Rest pub on Friday 16th Dec at 8pm’ we expect several team secretaries to attend, and we hope to have a Representative from Durham Football Association attending as well.\n\nFormed in 1967and originally known as the Durham and District Sunday Moening League, the League has developed to become one of the top adult Sunday football leagues in the Durham County FA area and possibly the country. More recently the League's reputation as one of the most progressive was further highlighted by it becoming the first male adult Sunday League in the Durham County FA area to sign up to the FA's Charter Standard campaign and in 2012 were awarded The FA's Bronze Award for its work towards the aims of The FA's Respect campaign.\n\nThe League Officials were Mr R.M. Alsop League Secretary, President Mr R Staffierri, Chairman Mr T Walker and the Management Committee included Mr R Forster and Mr J.S. Williamson\n\nThe Leagues Referee List\n\nMr R Ball, Mr R Barker, Mr D.C. Edwards, Mr R Fairley, Mr L Haywood, Mr M Henderson, Mr J Lane, Mr G McConnell, Mr P McNamara, Mr R.M Alsop, Mr E Oyston, Mr J.W Purvis, Mr R Ranson, Mr M Robinson, Mr J Salisbury, Mr K Simmons, Mr C Standish, Mr T Trotter, Mr T Usher, Mr I Walker.\n\nThere were two Divisions 10 Teams in the First Division,8 Teams in the second division, the Season started on Sunday 15th January 1967 and Finished on May 12th.\n\nThere in front of them sat 18 teams eager to get out there and play football.\n\nRemember it was 1967, England were World Cup winners, and everybody was ‘buzzing’. Who was going to be the next Bobby Moore, Alan Ball or even match heroes Martin Peters & Jeff Hurst? Football boots looking like Dr Martens and shorts down to their ankles, but most importantly respect amongst the players, referees and committee. Yes, the mid-sixties were a great time for playing football. 18 clubs, in two divisions, the first team to be crowned Division One champions where Durham Press Runners-Up were Belmont Wmc ‘A’ In Division Two, the champions were Bursgreen Sports with Ushaw Moor ‘A’ as runners-up. The 18 teams that took to the fields that season played at grounds such as Murton Colliery Welfare, Sherburn Village, King George Framwellgate Moor, Witton Gilbert, Pelton Rec., all of which are still being used today, many of those teams no longer play in our league or folded long ago. Just two teams are still and still hold pride of place in the history of our league…Witton Gilbert Wmc and Belmont Wmc\n\nOne of the Stronger teams in the League were Durham Press Who had started playing two years earlier when a team of Durham newspaper men played a Police team to raise money for Charities. They also played in the Newcastle based Northeast Sunday Football League. The pressmen were the only Durham and District Sunday Team to have played organised football before joining the league. Dave Willey was the Club Secretary, with Everton player Jim Pearson the manager, Dennis Stokoe a committee man and Tommy Burney was Treasurer. They were confident of doing well in the Durham and District Sunday League with some good signings, Bobby Gibson a former youth international, John Davison Former Army player, Bobby Hall ex Middlesbrough, Goalkeeper Tom Passmore who had played for Hartlepool last Season, Bernie Davies of Ferryhill, Dennis Stokoe had played pro football with Sunderland and Carlisle. They were using Chester moor as their home Ground.\n\nLeague Meetings were Held in the Travellers Rest Broomside Lane Belmont thanks to landlord’s Jim and Betty Williamson.\n\nThe Handbook was printed by The Langley Press, Langley Moor Durham. Durham Press winning Division One and Bursgreen winning Division Two. Ushaw Moor CC winning the Staffierri Trophy.

Organised youth football was not played outside the school curriculum except on a Saturday, or in the professional game. In general, football and other pursuits were not accepted as a widespread suitable activity on a Sunday. Most businesses were closed, and workers generally had the day off. To introduce organised Sunday football in this ‘climate’ was contentious and ground-breaking, potentially bringing about changes to a way of life. However, lovers of the game in the Durham City area saw a demand for Sunday Morning football. Young men, with the advent of rock and roll and more freedom in their lives, together with a change of attitude, were shaking off the ‘shackles’ of the traditional Sunday routine and looking for a different outlet for their interests. Football was very attractive to them.\n\nAt the 84th Annual General Meeting of the Durham County Football Association in June 1967 it was reported that 741 Sunday Morning Clubs Had Affiliated.\n\nSeason 1967-68\n\nDurham and District Sunday Football League\n\nThe previous seasons AGM Took place, and it was decided to extend the League to tree Divisions due to the interest from many teams wanting to Join.
