        "text": "B.Andrew Hindle was part of the ‘secret six’ new board members who took over and ultimately ousted Fred Ratcliffe with all the usual promises of cash etc. We finished bottom of the league in 79/80 and infamously got re-elected over Altrincham by 1 vote (26-25) with Luton and Grimsby not voting. Hindle/ Euroway allegedly had the ground, all that was needed was for us to get voted out and that would have been that! We didn’t of course and then enter kilpatrick and Morris who we owe our very existence to as we do Peter Madden who somehow got a team together out of nothing and we finished 15th in 80/81. Friend or foe- the latter !\n\nI've just finished reading the book whilst on holiday.\n\nI left Rochdale in 1979 after the Doug Collins team just dodged re-election so was only able to keep up with news via the Observer.\n\nI was 24 then so very much a child of the RAP generation and also knew most of the main characters in this book one way or another.\n\nRAP was always having a pop at Fred Ratcliffe; a lot of this was down to the claims that he was making a lot of money from his business and lording it round the Crimble whilst some of his workforce were allegedly being paid a pittance.\n\nDavid Wrigley was also a frequent target.\n\nThe one man who doesn't seem to come across particularly well at times is Bob Stokoe.\n\nHis second time at Spotland was obviously nothing like his first spell.\n\nI've just finished the book as well,, which I found fascinating. I was aware of the basic story but the detail and background regarding the club and the characters involved was eye-opening. It added a lot of colour to the whole period.\n\nAs someone who has never lived in Rochdale I also found it interesting to read about the social/economic situation around the town at the time and the effect that had on the club. I knew the club was not very well off in those days but I don't think I really appreciated how much of a shoestring it was run on with quite a lot of the senior players (not just the short-term ones) having second jobs to make ends meet. It seems we were effectively semi-professional at that time, but perhaps some of our competitors were in a similar state. If I remember the book correctly, the PFA dispute with Bob Stokoe over fining half the wages revealed that the players earned a lot less than an unskilled labourer.\n\nBack on topic I find it hard to see Andrew Hindle as a complete foe, having read the book. Obviously there is the issue with the ground, which on the surface looks like some sort of insurance policy if the club had gone bust as looked likely, but on the other hand he did put quite a bit of money in which kept the club going. The impression I had in advance was that he was up to no good from the start but I didn't get that from the book. As the previous poster says if Kilpatrick (who knew him) doesn't think he was bad then I will go with him.\n\nI would also like to see a follow-up about the Cannon era as originally that was what I thought the book would be about.\n\nAnyway, the lesson is don't lose control over your ground!\n\nJust remembered something rather surprising I read in the epilogue, that Kilpatrick and Morris had their complimentary season tickets revoked in September 2018 (but later restored) - that seems very petty given what they did for the club."
