        "text": "Danny Graham may wish to reconsider his request to leave Swansea City for Sunderland this week after he was booed by sections of the home crowd during this tedious stalemate.\n\nThe 27-year-old even told Michael Laudrup of his desire to go back to his native North-East on the eve of this game, yet there are some Sunderland fans who have no intention of welcoming him, despite Martin O’Neill’s obvious need for a new striker.\n\nWhether the boos and chants of “you’ll always be scum”, inspired by nothing more than his Newcastle allegiance, will be enough to put Graham off remains to be seen.\n\nAs for those who seem to think the sight of him in a Sunderland shirt will be an abomination, it is worth pointing out they have no problem with their left-back, Jack Colback, a Newcastle fan who came through Sunderland’s academy and neither did they reject Bob Stokoe, the Geordie who guided them to FA Cup success in 1973.\n\nThe poison that accompanies the derbies between Newcastle and Sunderland has intensified in recent years, but this hostility towards a player who is desperate to join them is dangerously counter-productive. Sunderland need a striker of Graham’s ilk. O’Neill heard the negative reaction to Graham’s introduction, but is still likely to conclude his arrival will be worth the hassle.\n\n“He has said himself he is a Newcastle fan and that reaction, as things stand, was quite a normal reaction,” said Sunderland’s manager. “Although I’m not sure Bob Stokoe would have been impressed with it.\n\n“Even though we have scored a few goals in recent weeks, we are overly reliant on Steven Fletcher and are trying to sign a striker. We have made a couple of bids this month and we’re waiting to see what happens. Maybe tonight was an indication of why we need to strengthen in that area.”\n\nIt must have been a strange experience for Graham playing for the club he wants to leave against the club he wants to join and he will be forgiven if he spent the next 90 minutes rethinking his career aspirations. As well as leaving a Swansea side that will play League Two’s Bradford City in the Capital One Cup final on Feb 24, he will be joining a side who struggled to touch the ball for half an hour.\n\nSwansea move the ball around as well as anyone in the top flight and they repeatedly sliced their way through Sunderland’s midfield, dominating territory and possession.\n\nThey should have had a penalty after just four minutes when John O’Shea challenged Itay Shechter, missed the ball and caught his standing leg. Referee Andre Marriner, though, decided to rule in favour of the Sunderland captain.\n\nIt was a big let-off, although Sunderland struggled to capitalise as Swansea pinned them in their own half. Simon Mignolet made one good save to keep out Chico Flores’s shot on the turn, but in the main, Swansea were kept away from the Belgian’s goal by a defence in which Titus Bramble and John O’Shea were once again impeccable at centre-back.\n\nUnfortunately, their performances were not matched by their attacking players and they only tested Gerhard Tremmel once when he fisted away a curling Seb Larsson free-kick.\n\nThe second half began as the first had ended, with two counter-attacking sides locked in a stalemate.\n\nNeither were willing to throw enough men forward to risk leaving themselves exposed at the back, which made it easier for both defences.\n\nSunderland could not manage to hurt Swansea in the final third, while the visitors missed their two good chances, Nathan Dyer side-footing Michu’s cross wide before Graham was denied a provocative winner when Bramble made a superb block in the final minute of stoppage time.\n\n“I don’t know what is going to happen with Danny in the next two days,” said Laudrup. “It was my decision not to start with him because of everything that has happened in the last few days and the fact Sunderland are one of the teams who have been talked about a lot with him, but when he came on he was the ultimate professional and was unlucky not to score.”"
