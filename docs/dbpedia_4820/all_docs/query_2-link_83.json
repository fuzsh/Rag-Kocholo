        "text": "The Vic, as it’s known to Hartlepool supporters, is built on ground that used to be a limestone quarry that was owned by the North-Eastern Railway Company. Founded as Hartlepool United Football Athletic Company in 1908, Hartlepool have played their home games at Victoria Park during their entire history. The club absorbed the assets and liabilities of West Hartlepool Football Club, who had won the FA Amateur Cup in 1905, when it was dissolved in 1910. They were elected to the Football League in 1921, spending the 37 years that followed in the Third Division North.\n\nVictoria Park opened its doors in 1886 as the home of West Hartlepool Rugby Football Club, who played their matches there until 1908 and then briefly returned between 1998 and 1999. The land was originally a limestone quarry before it was developed for a rugby stadium. It was named as a celebration for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria and was soon registered as The Hartlepools United Football Athletic Company Limited.\n\nStats\n\nVictoria Park Stats Year Opened 1886 Capacity 7864 Average Attendance 3125 Record Attendance 17264 (Hartlepool v Man United (1957)) Pitch Size 103 x 70 (7210) Nickname The Vic, Viccy Park Owner Hartlepool United F.C. Clubs Hosted Hartlepool United F.C., West Hartlepool R.F.C.

The Town End Terrace welcomes 1,775 supporters, whilst the Niramax Stand can welcome 1,617 people seated and 1,832 standing. The Cyril Knowles Stand has an official capacity of 1,599, whilst the Rink End’s capacity stands at 1,033.\n\nHartlepool United Ticket Prices\n\nThere are different prices for tickets depending on how old you are, but apart from that it’s pretty standard stuff and the price doesn’t vary at all. Have a quick look below:\n\nAdults: £20.00\n\nConcessions: £14.00\n\nHow To Get Hartlepool United Tickets\n\nAs is so often the case in the modern era, the club’s website is the best place to look for match tickets. If you fancy taking a chance then you can always try to get one on the get on the day of a match, with the fact that they rarely sell out their games meaning that you’ll be in with a good chance of getting one.\n\nYou can get tickets on the turnstile, over the phone or in person from the ticket office. Just be aware there is a £1.50 charge for card payments.\n\nWhere to Buy\n\nTicket Compare\n\nGetting To Victoria Park\n\nTrain – The good news for those wishing to travel by train to watch Hartlepool United play is that Hartlepool Railway Station is just ten minutes or so walk from the ground. It’s always worth booking your tickets in advance if you’re hoping to save a bit of money on the cost.\n\nBus – The number 1, the 36, the 3, 3A, 6 and 20 are all buses that stop within a quick walk of the stadium, so they’ll be the ones that you’ll want to look out for if you’d rather get the bus to the stadium than walk.\n\nCar – Those of you using a car to get to Victoria Park will use the A689 or the A179 to do so, depending on which direction you’re coming from. Obviously there are plenty of signs directing you once you get close enough to the ground.\n\nBy Air – Durham MME Airport is the closest to Hartlepool at about 15.1 miles, but it’s not exactly a main airport. Instead, you might want to look to the likes of Newcastle Airport if you’re flying in for the match.\n\nTaxi – Hartlepool boasts a number of private taxi companies, so you’ll be looking at around £5 for a journey in one of them from the town centre to Victoria Park.\n\nParking Near Victoria Park\n\nThere is a decent enough sized car park at the ground with limited spaces on match days, but failing that you’ll find on-street parking easily enough. Just make sure that you keep an eye out for local parking restrictions and try your best not to fall foul of them.\n\nMillhouse Car Park is located behind The Niramax Stand.\n\nSee Available Parking Near Victoria Park\n\nUseful Resources\n\nParking - Just Park\n\nVictoria Park Hotels\n\nHartlepool is on the coast so there are plenty of options for a place to stay:\n\nPubs and Bars Near Victoria Park\n\nIf you’re looking for somewhere in this coastal town to sink a pint and sing a few sea shanty’s (or not), check out one of these little gems:\n\nFacilities\n\nPremier League and even Championship grounds are of a certain quality, which can’t necessarily be reached by clubs lower down the English Football League pyramid. You can’t expect phenomenal conditions, therefore, but Victoria Park has everything most football supporters would want in the way of facilities.\n\nPrices\n\nProgramme: £3\n\nPie: £3\n\nCup of tea: £2\n\nHospitality\n\nYou have a couple of options when it comes to match day hospitality; you could opt for an executive box for up to 12 guests, including a 2 course meal, half time refreshments, and seats in the CK stand. Otherwise you could go for the Maidens Restaurant enjoying a 2 course meal and possibly a half time visit from players.\n\nPrivate Hire\n\nClubs of relative modesty tend to be quick to offer areas out to private hire, with Hartlepool United being no exception. Whether you want to use one of the boxes or even the pitch itself, an arrangement is likely to be reached for the right price.\n\nThe Vic is one of the premier conference venues in Hartlepool. It has excellent facilities including rooms that can house up to 120 people, whilst the meeting rooms can be turned around to accommodate anything from theatre presentations to classroom-style get togethers.\n\nStadium Tours & Museum\n\nAs things currently stand, there’s no museum at Victoria Park and you also can’t do a tour of the ground. Of course, both of those are the sorts of things that can change relatively quickly.\n\nAbout Hartlepool United\n\nYaffa Phillips / Flickr.com\n\nKnown to most football fans as the team supported by Soccer Saturday’s Jeff Stelling, Hartlepool also have famous fans in the form of the musician Meatloaf and the film director Ridley Scott. In 2002 Hartlepool United’s mascot, H’Angus the Monkey, was actually elected as mayor of Hartlepool after the man who portrays him, Stuart Drummond, decided to run as an independent under the slogan ‘free bananas for schoolchildren’.\n\nAway from the whacky and cooky side of life in Hartlepool, the club has led a solid if uninspiring existence since its formation in 1908. Brian Clough began his managerial career at The Vic, despite saying ‘I don’t fancy the place’ when offered the job. Up until 1968 the club was still officially called Hartlepools United. It dropped both the ’s’ and the ‘United’ that year when West Hartlepool, Hartlepool town and the village of Hart were all incorporated into one borough. The ‘United’ was restored to the team’s name in 1977.\n\nIn 1905, West Hartlepool were the FA Amateur Cup winners, which was relatively prestigious at the time. Indeed, only the FA Cup proper was seen as being more prestigious, which opened up the ability to have a professional team in Hartlepool. When West Hartlepool Ruby Club went bust, it meant that there was an empty stadium ready for a new club to fill. The Hartlepools United Football Athletic Company was therefore formed, representing both West Hartlepool and Old Hartlepool.\n\nOver the years of the club’s existence, it has bobbled around the various lower divisions of the English Football League. They played in the Second Division for the third time in the club’s history in 2002-2003 after finishing in second place in the lower tier, but problems and relegation soon followed. This included a decline into non-league football for a period, which finally came to an end when the club won the National League Play-Offs in order to get back into League Two.\n\nVictoria Park History\n\nJohn Lord / Flickr.com\n\nWest Hartlepool Rugby Football Club bought the area that the ground now stands on from North-Eastern Railway Company in 1886. They did so with the specific aim of opening a ground suitable for rugby matches to be played on, naming it in honour of Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee. The rugby club went busy in 1908, leaving the ground vacant for a new tenant. A football team was formed and took over ownership of the site.\n\nThe Main Stand on Clarence Road was destroyed by a zeppelin bomber during the First World War, with a small wooden stand being built in its place. A new stand was built in its place in the 1980s in the wake of the Bradford Stadium fire and the new regulations that were introduced as a result. Hartlepool were the last Football League club to install floodlights at their stadium. In 1986, both Hartlepool and Middlesbrough played their opening games of the season at the ground after Middlesbrough became locked out of their own ground due to going into liquidation.\n\nThe ground has twice been used by West Hartlepool Rugby Football Club with the most recent time being from 1998 until 1999. In 1996 the stadium changed its name from The Victoria Ground to Victoria Park because of the amount of work that had been done to it over the years. One claim to fame came in 1986 when Middlesbrough and Hartlepool both played their opening matches of the season on the same day at the ground because Middlesbrough were locked out of the home stadium after going into liquidation.\n\nFuture Developments\n\nHartlepool United gained promotion back to the Football League at the end of the 2020-2021 season. As a result, numerous changes were planned for Victoria Park, with more in the pipeline should the club maintain its place in the Football League. Obviously if that happens then we’ll update this section, but progress so far has been frustratingly slow."
