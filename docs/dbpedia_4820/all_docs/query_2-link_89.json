        "text": "Scunthorpe United will travel to face Hartlepool United on Tuesday, July 30th, as part of their pre-season preparations.\n\nThe encounter will take place at Victoria Park, kicking off at 7.45pm, and will represent the side's penultimate match in preparation for the Iron's 2024-25 Vanarama National League North campaign.\n\nBoth sides last met competitively in the 2021-22 season, as Scunthorpe's 72-year Football League stay came to an end. The last meeting, at the Attis Arena, still stands as the side's last home game in the EFL, which ended in a 1-1 draw with Cameron Wilson netting the goal for Scunthorpe.\n\nPrevious to that, the two sides have met at Victoria Park in pre-season friendlies in 2015 and 2016. Scunthorpe won the first of those 4-0 before triumphing 1-0 in the second 12 months later.\n\nAs soon as we have ticket details for the fixture, we will announce."
