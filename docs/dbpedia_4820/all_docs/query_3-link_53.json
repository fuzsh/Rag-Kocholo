        "text": "Kayte is currently an affiliate researcher in French Studies at the University of Warwick. Having undertaken undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in Comparative Literature at the University of Kent, Kayte obtained a doctoral scholarship on the AHRC-funded project ‘Queer Theory in France’, based jointly at the University of Warwick and King’s College London. Kayte’s thesis was supervised by the project’s Co-investigator, Dr Oliver Davis.\n\nResearch Interests\n\nKayte’s research spans a range of areas, which include, but are not limited to, critical disability studies, drag studies, feminism and transfeminism, and medicalization. Their current research aims to develop a transfeminist approach to drag, which challenges the definition of drag as ‘performing as the opposite sex’ – a definition which is unable to account for the diverse identities, performances, and forms of embodiment which are present in current drag scenes. Kayte is also developing plans for a postdoctoral project, which will explore the medicalization of gender diversity in France, the U.K, and the U.S. from 1880 to the present. Kayte is passionately invested in marginalized people’s right to determine and describe their own identities and experiences. Kayte is on Twitter as @drkaytestokoe.\n\nKey Publications\n\nBook\n\nReframing Drag: Beyond Subversion and the Status Quo, London: Routledge, under contract.
