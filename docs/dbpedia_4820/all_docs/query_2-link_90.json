        "text": "Media team sponsored by Northumbria Print\n\nMorpeth Town are delighted to announce the signing of Ryan Donaldson after he left League Two Hartlepool United.\n\nThe midfielder, a former Newcastle United academy graduate, captained Pools to promotion into the Football League, scoring a decisive spot-kick in the play-off final at the end of last season.\n\nAfter four years at the Vic, he has opted for a switch to the Highwaymen, taking a role within our new academy alongside his playing duties.\n\nHe admitted it was the perfect time in his career to make the switch and is excited to be part of an ambitious project currently underway at Craik Park.\n\n“The way it has been going over the last few years and the things that are set in place here at Morpeth, we have scope to really push on to become another club in the North East that is up there with best of the North East non-league teams,” said Donaldson after signing for the Highwaymen.\n\n“I wanted to get into the coaching side, either at Hartlepool or if I left there. When I got to 30, I knew I wanted to start coaching and I’ve known academy director Nicky Gray for a few years so I’m thankful for the opportunity to be part of it.\n\n“With the academy starting this year at Morpeth, it aligned perfectly with my football journey. I wasn’t sure how full-time football and the academy coaching was going to work together.\n\n“It’s the continuation of my footballing journey and it’s a great place to start my coaching. I just felt combining coaching and playing, at an ambitious club, it was the perfect time to start something fresh.”\n\nHis decision to leave Pools was far from an easy one, with a fairy-tale ending to the previous campaign making the choice an even tougher one over the summer.\n\n“I said to the manager of Hartlepool I’ve not taken it lightly,” he added.\n\n“We got promoted and you felt like you deserved that chance to play in the league again. Four years of hard work then you do it, to step away was really difficult.\n\n“The way we went up, the way the season went. It was a perfect ending for me so I can walk away with my head held high.\n\n“They are an important club to me, and I’ve got some great memories. It is a club I care about deeply. I’m a fan now and I hope they have continued success because the chairman, manager and the fans deserve it.\n\n“I’d like to say thanks for the way they’ve treated me while I have been deciding and also to the chairman and manager for the way they’ve been.\n\n“But I’m looking to forward to getting involved at Morpeth and I’m really excited for it.”\n\nManager Stephen Turnbull was delighted to secure the signing of Donaldson, who has also played for Gateshead, Cambridge and Plymouth Argyle in his career.\n\n“I’m absolutely delighted to sign Ryan,” said Turnbull.\n\n“Every non-league club in the north would have fancied him. He’s another player that brings a lot of experience; I’ve spoken to players he’s played with and coaches he’s played for and they all say what a good lad he is, a model professional.\n\n“He will be a top, top player this season, and I’m really looking forward to working with him and welcoming him into the group.”"
