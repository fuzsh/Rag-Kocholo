        "text": "FC Halifax Town were defeated 1-0 away Hartlepool United this afternoon in the Vanarama National League thanks to a second half penalty from former Town striker Mani Dieseruvwe.\n\nTown boss Chris Millington made one change from the 4-2 win against Chesterfield with Andrew Oluwabori dropping down to the bench and Max Wright into the starting eleven.\n\nBoth sides looked to play football and it was a first half with few chances. Town midfielder Florent Hoti looked to play a ball into the box but found Peter Jameson there to stop a good chance for the Shaymen.\n\nA quick throw from Max Wright found Tylor Golden and his cross was blocked for the first corner of the game. It was taken short, but Town were unable to find a shot inside the box and the home defence was able to clear.\n\nThe home side were awarded a freekick on 15 minutes, Callum Cookeâ€™s ball into the far post looked for Tom Parkes but Johnson was able to claim.\n\nSam Johnson had to be alert to save from former Town striker Mani Dieseruvwe on 22 minutes and his fine save stopped a 20th league goal of the campaign and out for a corner.\n\nJust after the half hour mark, Max Wright found Hoti, he beat his man, but his 30-yard shot was always wide of the target. Then a freekick in a central area, Golden looked for Thompson-Sommers, he was able to get the ball into the box but the home defence that leaked 7 goals in midweek held firm and cleared.\n\nRob Harker had an effort from distance which had to be held by Pools keeper Peter Jameson 6 minutes before the break.\n\nA foul by Luke Waterfall saw him become the first man into the referee Jamie Oâ€™Connorâ€™s book and Town worked the ball to Wright but his shot was again straight at Jameon.\n\nThere was still time for a final chance in injury time, Goldenâ€™s freekick to the far post was missed by Jameson and Adam Senior could only head over the bar.\n\nInto the second half, Tylor Golden had to clear off the line as Dieseruvwe â€˜s effort was goal bound before a freekick into the box and Luke Waterfall headed wide of the target.\n\nChris Millington made his first substitution with Luke Summerfield on for Kane Thompson-Sommers.\n\nAaron Cosgrave was put through on goal, but Jameson was able to save at his feet and he was quickly subbed for Andrew Oluwabori.\n\nHarker was put through on goal and he fired into the side netting, but the offside flag was up against the Town man.\n\nOluwabori had options but choose to shoot from distance but was high and wide of the target.\n\nGood play saw Hoti finding Summerfield at the edge of the box, but his effort was straight at Jamieson.\n\nThe home side were given the perfect chance to go ahead as Golden fouled Agyemang in the box and Mani Dieseruvwe made no mistake with the ball dispatched into the top right corner of Sam Johnsonâ€™s goal for his 20th league goal of the season.\n\nCooke looked for Dieseruvwe, but his effort was deflected wide for a corner as they looked for a second goal.\n\nThe Shaymen were appealing for their own penalty on 81 minutes. A freekick into the box, Senior down in the box â€“ the players wanted a penalty kick but nothing give by Jamie Oâ€™Connor.\n\nGolden cut in from the right-hand side in injury time but his effort was high and wide of the target.\n\nDeep in injury time, a freekick into the box looked for Stott and went out for a corner. Summerfieldâ€™s ball into the box was headed out and the final whistle was blown.\n\nTown denied anything this afternoon and will remain outside the play-offs going into the Easter Monday game at home to York City, 3pm kick-off.\n\nHartlepool United\n\n13 Peter Jameson, 32 Louis Stephenson, 42 Luke Waterfall, 29 Tom Parkes, 3 David Ferguson, 35 Nicky Featherstone Â©, 22 Tom Crawford, 12 Joe Grey, 10 Callum Cooke (41 Chay Cooper 89), 36 Courtney Duffus (28 Terrel Agyemang 61) , 20 Mani Dieseruvwe\n\nSubs: 1 Joel Dion, 23 Emmanuel Onariase, 34 Kwaku Oduroh\n\nFC Halifax Town\n\n1 Sam Johnson Â©, 2 Tylor Golden, 5 Adam Senior, 6 Jamie Stott, 3 Ryan Galvin, 8 Jack Hunter, 14 Kane Thompson-Sommers (4 Luke Summerfield 53), 18 Florent Hoti (27 Adan George 81) 17 Max Wright, 9 Rob Harker, 19 Aaron Cosgrave (22 Andrew Oluwabori 59)\n\nSubs:12 Jack Evans, 28 Jack Jenkins\n\nReferee: Jamie Oâ€™Connor\n\nGoals: Dieseruvwe 72 (pen)\n\nYellow Cards: Waterfall 45, Galvin 58, Agyemang 69, Wright 87\n\nRed Cards: None\n\nAttendance: 4444 (474 away)\n\nHartlepool United 1 FC Halifax Town 0"
