        "text": "JOE BENNETT played more league matches (41) than any other outfield Brighton player during the 2014-15 season.\n\nNot bad for a loan signing who’d been edged out at Aston Villa after a season in their first team.\n\nBennett’s appearance record for the Seagulls was perhaps even more noteworthy in that it spanned the reigns of three managers.\n\nBrought in by Sami Hyypia, the defender retained the left-back berth during Nathan Jones’ temporary spell in charge right through to the end of the season after Chris Hughton had taken over.\n\nBennett hasn’t been afraid to travel the length and breadth of the country plying his trade as a footballer.\n\nIt all began in his home town, Rochdale, where he was born on 28 March 1990. His early promise with a football saw him join up with the under-eights at their centre of excellence.\n\nWhen he was 10, his parents separated and he moved to the north east to live with his mum and stepdad in Swainby, eight miles north east of Northallerton.\n\nHe quickly got fixed up with Sunday league side Northallerton Town. One of their coaches, Gary Ramsbotham, also scouted for Middlesbrough and through him Bennett went for a trial and got taken on.\n\nHis progress suffered a setback when he was 15. He was de-registered by Boro and had a year away from the club, during which time he worked hard on his fitness and strength before being taken back on.\n\n“The year away really helped me focus on my football and I realised then how badly I wanted to make it,” he told Tony Higgins in an interview for gazettelive.co.uk.\n\nAs he progressed through the youth ranks, Bennett, who’d originally been a striker, was converted to a left-back by Boro coach Steve Agnew.\n\nHe also had a perfect work experience stint from school when he got to go training with Boro’s under 18 side, and he relished the opportunity of being a ballboy at Riverside home games.\n\nEventually, he made it to the first team, Gareth Southgate giving him his debut as a substitute in the final game of the 2008-09 Premier League season against West Ham, although Boro had already been relegated by then.\n\nBennett thought he’d get chances to play in the Championship, but new boss Gordon Strachan turned to more experienced players, and Bennett only made 13 appearances in 2009-10.\n\nIt was a different story following the arrival of Tony Mowbray and the young full-back was a regular over the following two seasons, eventually starting 84 matches for Boro and going on as a sub eight times.\n\nHe earned the club’s young player of the year title at the end of the 2010-11 season and the North East Football Writers’ Association’s young player of the year accolade in 2011-12.\n\n2011 was a good year for him because he also caught the eye of the international selectors and won three caps for England under-21s.\n\nHis debut came in a 1-0 defeat away to Italy on 8 February 2011, he was a sub for Ryan Bertrand in England’s 2-1 home defeat to Iceland on 28 March, and he started the 5 September game against Israel at Barnsley’s Oakwell ground which England won 4-1, with Jonjo Shelvey and Ross Barkley pulling the strings in midfield.\n\nIn August 2012, Premier League Aston Villa paid £3m to take him to Villa Park. Boss Paul Lambert told avfc.co.uk: “Joe’s a really good player, young and hungry to succeed and he’s exactly the type of player we want here at the football club.\n\n“There’s no doubt in my mind that he will thrive in this environment and he fits in exactly with what we are trying to build here.\n\n“His energy level is really high and he can get up and down the pitch really well, which will be important for the team and important in terms of how we want to play as a team.\n\n“He’s an exciting signing for the club and I’m really pleased we’ve been able to take him here.”\n\nWhile Bennett made 30 appearances for Villa in his first season, increased competition and back and knee injuries restricted his involvement in 2013-14 to only seven matches.\n\nAt the start of the 2014-15 season, Albion had been expecting Irish international Stephen Ward to join permanently after his season on loan from Wolves. But his last-minute u-turn en route to putting pen to paper on the deal meant the Seagulls were in the market for a new left-back because new boss Hyypia wanted someone more experienced than Adam Chicksen.\n\nWith playing time at Villa again looking like only being sporadic, Bennett went along to Elland Road on 19 August 2014 and liked what he saw as Albion won 2-0 in what would turn out to be one of the few decent performances under Hyypia.\n\n“I went to watch them against Leeds and I think that just made me realise what a good team they are,” said Bennett. “They just kept the ball really well, from the back to the front, defended well and they looked like they had a lot of energy.\n\n“The full-backs like to go forward as well which is part of my game as I like to go forward and get involved a bit more up the pitch, so it was nice to see.\n\n“I spoke to the manager and he told me a bit about how he likes the team to play and how I could fit in to that, and hopefully I can.”\n\nAfter the Hyypia reign came to an early end, Bennett remained suitably diplomatic in interviews and in a matchday programme feature spoke about the positive influence on his game of former full-back Hughton.\n\n“Obviously it’s good for me on a personal level having a former defender as manager,” he said. “He knows his stuff and is there to give me plenty of advice, especially in the left-back role. Since the gaffer came in he’s been working hard on defensive shape and being more compact as a team.”\n\nHe spoke about Hughton’s greater emphasis on defending compared to Hyypia’s desire for the full-backs to push up. “I’ve got a more defensive role now but I’m really enjoying my football under Chris. I feel I’m learning all the time,” he said.\n\nAt one point it looked like Bennett might join Albion on a permanent basis, but when Tim Sherwood took over from Lambert, he indicated the full-back may yet have a future at Villa Park.\n\nThe new Villa boss ran his eye over the defender and said: “Joe has done very, very well. I am now looking forward to seeing him in pre-season.”\n\nHe did enough to earn a one-year contract extension and scored his first goal for the club in a 5-3 League Cup win over Notts County. But, with Aly Cissokho still ahead of him in the pecking order, and with only an hour to go before the end of the August transfer window, Bennett was loaned to newly-promoted AFC Bournemouth.\n\nOstensibly he was signed as cover for Tyrone Mings and Charlie Daniels, but he hoped the move would give him the opportunity to play regularly in the Premier League.\n\n“I’m really excited about the prospect of playing for Bournemouth and hopefully helping them perform well this season,” he told Villa’s website. “They’ve already made a positive start to the new season and, like everyone else, I’ve been really impressed with the fantastic job Eddie Howe has done. They have a really good side.”\n\nUnfortunately, it didn’t unfold how Bennett had hoped. He didn’t make any appearances for Bournemouth and returned early to Villa Park after suffering an achilles tendon injury.\n\nRecovered from the injury, Bennett joined Sheffield Wednesday on loan in mid-January 2016 until the end of the season. Again, a permanent move looked on the cards, especially when new Villa boss Roberto Di Matteo indicated he wouldn’t be part of his first-team plans.\n\nVilla chairman Tony Xia blocked the move, not wishing to sell to a Championship rival, but, within a fortnight, Bennett moved on a free transfer to fellow Championship side Cardiff City. A calf injury meant he had to wait two months before making his debut, but he went on to spend an eventful five years in South Wales, riding a rollercoaster emotionally, on and off the field.\n\nNevertheless, his popularity with the Bluebirds was perhaps best encapsulated by chairman Mehmet Dalman who described him as “the best left back in the league”.\n\nBennett endured a somewhat turbulent relationship with boss Neil Warnock, although he admitted in an extended interview with Oscar Johnson: “He is a nice, genuine and down-to-earth guy. He was really good to me during his time here.\n\n“At first, I don’t think he really fancied playing me to be honest, but I was the only left-back at the club, so he didn’t have a choice.\n\n“Our relationship got better as it went along and he was really good for me both personally and as a player.”\n\nThat didn’t seem to be the case in January 2018 when Bennett was in the headlines for the wrong reason. He escaped what looked like a straight red card for a bad foul on Leroy Sane in a FA Cup tie against Manchester City but eventually saw red for a second booking, which incurred Warnock’s wrath.\n\n“I was disappointed he got sent off at the end,” said Warnock. “Obviously he doesn’t want to go to Leeds next weekend, because it was an absolutely pathetic challenge when on a booking. To do something like that I think is disrespectful to teammates.”\n\nEven so, Bennett was a regular fixture in defence during Cardiff’s brief spell in the Premier League, playing 30 of the 38 matches.\n\n“Being relegated after one season was obviously gutting, but nobody had given us a chance of staying up before the season began, so to battle as long and hard as we did was definitely something to be proud of,” he said.\n\n“We had a really good team and got some really good results over the course of the season. I think that, with a little bit of luck, we could maybe have stayed up. If VAR had been in use, we might have done it because we had some horrible decisions go against us.”\n\nIn March 2019, Bennett opened up to Dominic Booth about how it felt playing against the backdrop of losing the father who had first urged him to pursue his dream of becoming a professional footballer.\n\nHe remained with Cardiff and was enjoying a new lease of life after Mick McCarthy’s appointment as manager when he suffered an anterior cruciate knee ligament injury in March 2021 that put him out of the game for the rest of the season.\n\nAfter surgery, he made a swift-than-expected recovery and, even though he’d been given a free transfer at the end of his contract, he continued his recovery by training with the Bluebirds.\n\n“The club had a duty of care to aid the player’s rehabilitation and, as such, Bennett has been at the club’s Vale of Glamorgan HQ gradually working his way back to fitness,” reported walesonline.co.uk.\n\nMcCarthy explained that a new deal had been in the offing before the injury, but it never got signed. “I was quite sad about it because I spoke to Benno when I came in, I knew his contract was running out,” he said. “I discussed with him about staying, then injury comes and it changed it all.”\n\nBennett was not the only departure at the end of the season, and a statement on the club website read: “We would like to place on record our sincerest thanks and best wishes to Sol Bamba, Joe Bennett and Junior Hoilett who will be moving on this summer upon the expiration of their current deals.\n\n“The three players joined us in 2016 and would go on to become key figures in our 2017-18 promotion squad. Between them they made a total of 478 appearances across a five-year period, representing a significant contribution to the club’s recent progress and history.”\n\nBennett subsequently moved north and signed a two-year deal with Wigan Athletic.\n\nA CAREER-ENDING leg break led one-time international hopeful George Dalton into a new career as a football physio.\n\nGeordie-born Dalton was an emerging left-back at Newcastle United being watched as a possible candidate for a call-up to the England Under-23 side.\n\nBut he was never the same player after breaking a leg in a tackle with Leeds United’s Johnny Giles.\n\nThen, only seven months after trying to resurrect his career with third tier Brighton, unlucky Dalton sustained a double fracture of the same leg in a freak collision and never played professionally again.\n\nHowever, he turned his familiarity with the treatment table to good use and he later became Coventry City’s physio for the best part of 20 years.\n\nBorn in Dilston, Northumberland, on 4 September 1941, Dalton went through the junior ranks at Newcastle and turned professional at St James’s Park in 1958.\n\nHe made his Toon debut on 10 October 1960 in a 4-1 League Cup defeat away to Colchester United, and made his First Division debut the following February, ending up on the losing side in a 5-3 defeat away to Leicester City.\n\nAfter Newcastle’s relegation to the old Division Two, Dalton made a lot more appearances (including being in the Toon side who thumped Brighton 5-0 at St James’ on 21 October 1961).\n\nHe was in and out of the side over the next two years but became a regular from March 1963 and, in January 1964, eagle-eyed Ken McKenzie, reporter for Newcastle’s The Journal, spotted England Under-23 selector Mr E.Smith in the stands at St James’s.\n\n“This visit can only mean imminence of England Under-23s selection to meet Scotland at St James’s Park on Wednesday evening, February 5, and check up, particularly on George Dalton and Alan Suddick, of United,” he wrote. “On this basis, I feel that Mr Smith’s trip to Tyneside holds out very bright prospect of Forest Hall, Newcastle, product, Dalton, gaining his first representative honour on February 5.\n\n“I know that Dalton has been recommended to the England selectors for some time by United directors and manager, and his consistency and clean, strong play has been commented on by influential observers at several away games.”\n\nUnfortunately, the call-up didn’t happen, and revered reporter Ken Jones wrote in the Daily Mirror: “Despite local claims for left back George Dalton and inside forward idol Alan Suddick; neither has been chosen by the England team manager, and clearly they have no place in his ideas at present.”\n\nInterestingly, the left-back berth went to Keith Newton, who later went with England to the 1970 World Cup in Mexico. Mike Bailey and Graham Cross both played in the Under-23s’ 3-2 win over Scotland, while the reserves that day were Peter Grummitt, Alan Mullery and Martin Chivers.\n\nWithin a matter of weeks, Dalton’s football fortunes were turned upside down when, in his 40th game of the season, on 30 March 1964, three days after Newcastle had surrendered an eight-game unbeaten run losing 1-0 at home to promotion-chasing Leeds on Good Friday, the full-back suffered a leg break that virtually finished his Newcastle career.\n\nThe Journal saw it thus: “This is the tale of a noble resistance by a Newcastle side who had Alan Suddick crippled in the 17th minute and lost George Dalton with a broken right leg (just above the ankle) with 14 minutes to go.”\n\nmightyleeds.co.uk recorded it like this: “Newcastle finished with one man in hospital and another limping, but Leeds just about deserved to win their third hard match in four days. For once, however, there was no malice attached to the game and left-back Dalton confirmed he had broken his right tibia after himself kicking the sole of Giles’ boot.”\n\nDalton didn’t play his next Newcastle first team game for nearly two and a half years, and then it was just the one game. After that solitary appearance – his 94th for Toon – on 27 August 1966, when they lost a Division One match 2-1 at home to Spurs, he was cast into the shadows and eventually given a free transfer in May 1967.\n\nThird Division Brighton gave the player the chance to salvage his career and he arrived on the south coast in June 1967 together with a young centre forward, Bob Fuller, who went on to score regularly for Albion’s reserves but subsequently moved to South Africa and in later life became a senior executive at mobile phone companies Orange and 3.\n\nThere were a couple of familiar faces amongst Dalton’s new teammates: Dave Turner, had been a fringe player at Newcastle before joining Brighton in December 1963, while forward Kit Napier had moved to the south coast the previous summer.\n\nStewart Ogden also joined straight from school in the north east in the summer of 1967 and the matchday programme declared: “Instead of Sussex by the Sea, Albion’s rousing signature tune, they may be playing The Blaydon Races this season, with so many Geordies on the staff.”\n\nDalton took over the no.3 shirt from Bobby Baxter, who had moved on to Torquay United, and went straight into Albion’s starting XI alongside new £25,000 record signing John Napier from Bolton Wanderers.\n\nThe matchday programme acknowledged Dalton’s past injury misfortune and said: “We all hope the change of club will see this fine defender recapturing his old form. He is married and recently moved into a pleasant club house at Portslade.”\n\nDalton made 28 appearances in the first half of that 1967-68 season under Archie Macaulay before tragically suffering a double fracture of his right leg in a 0-0 draw at home to Oxford United.\n\nIt was on 27 January 1968 that Dalton was involved in a heavy collision with United’s Graham Atkinson (big Ron’s brother) and Albion goalkeeper Brian Powney.\n\nThe cruel blow came almost four years after the injury he’d sustained at Newcastle and the Albion matchday programme commented how he had “completely shaken off the effects and was playing with great confidence” adding: “Albion’s popular left-back has played some fine games this season and his stylish work has been admired by supporters of other clubs, as well as the Albion fans.”\n\nIn its Albion Postbag column, a correspondent from Newhaven, calling himself ‘Veteran Player’, wrote: “George Dalton has had two unlucky accidents and we all hope he comes back fit and well and able to continue to delight us with his polished full-back play.\n\n“Brighton have nearly always been lucky with their left-backs, and we have had a string of really fine players in that position. George Dalton can be included in that impressive list.”\n\nMacaulay was optimistic the player would recover and in October 1968 the programme told supporters: “George is doing light training, jogging round the pitch, up the terracing also carrying out weight training exercises.”\n\nIn the meantime, Mike Everitt had been brought in to fill the gap and, by the time Macaulay was succeeded as manager by Freddie Goodwin, as 1968 drew to a close, Dalton still wasn’t in contention.\n\nIt looked even less likely he’d get back in when Goodwin signed his former Leeds teammate Willie Bell from Leicester City, but his next career step was closely linked to both of them.\n\nIn the summer of 1970, Dalton, who’d combined studying physiotherapy with coaching the Albion junior team in the latter part of his contract, joined Goodwin and Bell as part of the new management team at Birmingham City.\n\nAlbion took serious umbrage at the exodus and the matter ended up with City having to pay £4,500 compensation for Goodwin (who still had 18 months of his contract remaining) and a £5,000 fine for illegally approaching Bell.\n\nDalton’s situation was viewed differently because he’d technically been a player out of contract thus free to make a move.\n\nWhen Goodwin left City in 1976 and returned to manage in America, Dalton moved on to Midlands neighbours Coventry City, taking over as physio from Norman Pilgrim, and he retained the position for two decades.\n\nSeveral former players had nothing but good things to say about him when interviewed in Steve Phelps’ book 29 Minutes From Wembley. Striker Garry Thompson spoke highly of the care with which Dalton treated him when he suffered a broken leg that put him out of the game for 11 months.\n\n“George Dalton, our physiotherapist, was magnificent with me,” he said. “He kept saying my leg was going to be like a twig and I’d have to rebuild the muscles and learn to walk again.\n\n“My Mum and Dad thought it was career over, but, the way I think about it now, I was so lucky because there weren’t that many options for me and I had to play football.\n\n“George’s own career was ended by injury. He was a very good footballer when he trained with us so, when I broke my leg, he really took care of me and was superb.\n\n“I couldn’t thank him enough and all George had was the sponge and two machines in the treatment room, the electric currents and the ultrasound, that was it.\n\n“He worked miracles down the years with players and, if it wasn’t for him, I would not have played until I was 37. I owe him a lot.”\n\nGarry’s praise for Dalton was echoed by Paul Dyson, who spent prolonged periods in the treatment room with ankle and back injuries during his teenage years. “George was a real character. We all had a lot of time for him and he tended a lot of us through our respective injuries.\n\n“He used to drive us to the hospital in his Morris 1100 and had a great left foot. He’d played left-back for Newcastle United before his own career was ended by injury. There were the two machines in his room and he used to have ice cubes on sticks in his freezer.”\n\nScottish international winger Tommy Hutchison was another admirer. “He was a smashing lad, George, very old-school. He suffered no fools and could always tell if a player was injured or not.\n\n“In our days broken legs did finish careers, along with knee ligament injuries, and George rehabilitated so many players at Coventry. There was no squad rotation as you wanted to stay in the team and play every week because if you didn’t someone else would step in to take your place and you wouldn’t be able to get back in.”\n\nMidfielder Andy Blair added: “George was a great physiotherapist, a terrific calming influence and a great man to have around.”\n\nExperienced full-back Mick Coop was another who appreciated the physio. “George really was a lovely man who worked injured players very hard in the gym to get them back on to the pitch,” he said. “He was very quiet but did his job well and garnered a lot of respect off the playing squad. I can’t speak highly enough of him.”\n\nDalton keeps in touch with many of his former colleagues through the Coventry City Former Players’ Association, which has reported how he returned to live in Newcastle in retirement.\n\n* Pictures from matchday programmes and various online sources.\n\nPACY SCOUSE winger Craig Noone was a born entertainer who bounced back from early rejection by Liverpool to make it all the way to the Premier League.\n\nBrighton in the Championship under Gus Poyet provided the former roofer with a platform to showcase his ability before Cardiff City gave him the opportunity to perform at the top level.\n\nAfter he’d scored (below) and impressed in an away game at Manchester City, then newly-appointed Cardiff boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said: “Noone is a terrific little player.\n\n“He causes defenders problems with his pace and his technique; he can go inside and outside. He’s got a good left foot, but he can cross it with his right.”\n\nBorn in Kirkby, Liverpool, on 17 November 1987, Noone was on Liverpool’s books between the ages of eight and 11.\n\n“I was spotted playing for my Sunday team St Peter and Paul and I used to train at Melwood a couple of times a week – it was unbelievable,” he recalled. “We wore the cream and black training kit and I loved every minute. I was a big Steve McManaman fan, the way he ran at players, and would try to do the same.\n\n“Unfortunately, when I got to 11, Steve Heighway called one night to say that I wasn’t good enough to stay on – I’ll never forget it.”\n\nNoone would eventually get to play on the hallowed turf of Anfield, but not on behalf of the home side.\n\nIt was New Year’s Eve 2010 that he joined Brighton, making his debut four days later in a 2-1 win away to Exeter City, where he’d spent six weeks on loan the previous year.\n\nPoyet had admired the winger’s attributes up against Inigo Calderon in one half and Marcos Painter in the second during the Seagulls’ 2-0 win at Plymouth three months earlier, Noone discovered from another Argyle player, Ashley Barnes, who’d scored against his old club that day.\n\n“Barnesey later told me that the management thought I was a good player and had mentioned me a lot in the half-time team talk,” he said. “When Brighton made their interest official, I didn’t have to think twice. The manager, the team, the stadium…it ticked all the right boxes for me.”\n\nThe slightly built Noone swiftly endeared himself to the crowd with jinking runs at pace and it was perhaps inevitable that the fans would adapt for him the chant more widely associated with England and Manchester United star Wayne Rooney.\n\nMore a provider of chances for others than a goalscorer, ‘Nooney’ made 10 starts and 13 appearances off the bench as Poyet’s Seagulls romped to the League One championship title, getting his first goal in a home 2-0 win over Colchester United at the end of January, followed by one of Albion’s four in a convincing win over Hartlepool United on 12 February.\n\nThe highlight of the following season for Noone was Albion drawing Liverpool in cup games; not once, but twice. In the League Cup at the Amex, Noone put in a man-of-the-match performance as Albion narrowly lost 2-1 to the Reds.\n\nFour years previously, Noone had been working on the roof of an extension at Steven Gerrard’s house, but in the post-match TV interview for Sky Sports he was stood alongside the Liverpool captain.\n\n“It was his comeback match after injury and he gave me his shirt,” Noone told the Liverpool Echo. “To do the Sky interview alongside him afterwards was unbelievable for me. He said I deserved to be man of the match because I’d caused Liverpool a lot of problems.\n\n“For him to say that made me really proud, especially when I think about where I’ve come from. It wasn’t long ago I was playing non-league football part-time and working as a roofer. That puts into perspective how far I’ve come and sometimes I have to pinch myself.”\n\nIndeed, Noone’s resilience and ability to bounce back from adversity did have something of a Roy of the Rovers feel to it. After the disappointment of not progressing at Liverpool, Noone nonetheless did get to play representative games at Anfield: for Merseyside Schoolboys in the final of the National Cup against Bedfordshire.\n\n“I scored to make it 1-0 in front of The Kop and it was an unbelievable feeling,” he said. “That was the only part of the ground open to spectators and I had all my friends and family watching. We went on to win the game 3-1.” He also played for Myerscough College in the National Colleges Cup final, again scoring in front of the Kop.\n\nNon-league Skelmersdale United guided Noone from their youth team through to the first team. In early 2007, he had a trial at Royal Antwerp, a feeder club for Manchester United, but it wasn’t until November that year that he started to climb the football pyramid.\n\nHe was 20 when he stepped up two divisions to Blue Square North neighbours Burscough in exchange for experienced non-league striker Kevin Leadbetter. A regular for Burscough under Liam Watson, Noone followed the manager to Southport in June 2008.\n\nHe made his debut for Southport on the opening day of the 2008-09 season against Gainsborough, watched by the Plymouth chief scout Andy King, the former Everton striker. After the game, King approached him and told him to expect a call. Sure enough, the following Tuesday, the Devon club made contact and he was soon on his way for a £110,000 fee.\n\n“Craig comes to us with a glowing reputation,” said Argyle boss Paul Sturrock. “It is now up to him to prove that it is merited. If he shows me he can make the step up to the Championship, the door is open for him.”\n\nWith Plymouth battling to stay in the division, Noone struggled to get games under his belt initially and was sent on loan to Exeter to gain some league-playing experience. But an intended three-month arrangement was cut to only six weeks by Sturrock, and he returned to Home Park and became a regular until his transfer to Brighton.\n\nThe least said the better about the FA Cup fifth round clash when the Seagulls were thumped 6-1 at Anfield. Noone only got on as a substitute, but the pre-match hype gave him the chance to tell his story to the Echo and he said: “I’m loving it at Brighton. I’m learning all the time and Gus is unbelievable to play for. His coaching is spot on and he’s made me a much better player.”\n\nIndeed, Championship football didn’t faze Noone and, with the close season departure of Elliott Bennett to Norwich City, it presented him with the opportunity to start 21 games (coming off the bench in a further 16 matches) despite the addition of another wideman in Will Buckley.\n\nHe was also a popular character in the dressing room, having inherited a sense of humour from his dad, Steve, a part-time stand-up comedian. Skipper Gordon Greer said of the winger: “He’s a real top guy. He’s a great laugh and a really good personality to have about the place. He does some hilarious things and that really adds to the good atmosphere we have about the place.”\n\nHowever, Noone’s performances didn’t go unnoticed by others and promotion-chasing Cardiff tested Albion’s resolve to keep the winger by offering £500,000 for him in January 2012. Albion rebuffed the approach and, in March, extended Noone’s contract until June 2015 with manager Poyet declaring: “He was a key player for us in the second half of last season and has already established himself as a top Championship player.”\n\nA satisfied Noone told the club website: “I set my sights on a long-term contract so I’m very happy to get it sorted, because this club is going from strength to strength.\n\n“We have a few wingers here but we all have our individual qualities and the way this team plays lets me express myself on the pitch. This contract shows that the club has confidence in me and I’m very happy here at Brighton.”\n\nHowever, just a matter of days after playing for Brighton against Cardiff in a 0-0 draw at the Amex at the start of the new season, Noone was on his way to Wales when the Bluebirds doubled their previous offer to £1m, and Malky Mackay got his man.\n\n“They matched my ambitions to get to the Premier League as quickly as possible,” said Noone, who appreciated their persistence in trying to sign him. “It’s a shame the move didn’t happen in January because I would have liked to be here and settled, but I enjoyed my time at Brighton and wouldn’t change that.\n\n“But Cardiff are better equipped than Brighton to go up after going so close and not quite making it. Hopefully this time we will do it. I’m a Cardiff player and want to do the best I can.”\n\nNoone played 25 times (plus six as a sub) and scored seven goals as Cardiff went up as Champions, while Albion slipped up in the play-offs, so making the switch certainly worked in his favour.\n\nCity went straight back down after one season in the Premier League, but Noone managed 15 starts plus eight appearances as a sub. He spoke to the matchday programme about how tough it had been to force his way into the side and said: “When you’re not playing it can be frustrating, but you have to take a step back and take a look at your situation. If I’d have been moaning and groaning, I don’t think I would have lasted long here.”\n\nHe was in Cardiff’s midfield when they lost 3-1 at Liverpool on 21 December 2013. The BBC report of the game noted: “Cardiff started the game promisingly and went close early on when a swift counter attack resulted in Mutch playing a ball though to Craig Noone, whose 22-yard shot was palmed over by goalkeeper Simon Mignolet.”\n\nHe was not involved in the return match in March when Liverpool thumped City 6-3, by which time Solskjaer had taken over the reins.\n\nApart from the individual goal against Manchester City that had Solskjaer purring, Noone also enjoyed a FA Cup third round match away to Newcastle United on 4 January 2014 when he scored from distance a minute after coming on as a late substitute, when City were 1-0 down.\n\nFellow substitute Fraizer Campbell scored a winner, turning the lead in City’s favour only seven minutes later. The victory proved historic, because it was the first time the Bluebirds had won at St James’ Park since 1963.\n\nNoone’s humble journey back into the game meant he was always happy to contribute to community activities too and he was named Community Champion by Cardiff City FC Foundation for his inspiring involvement in its futsal programme.\n\nHis voluntary efforts, also recognised by the PFA, included taking part in classroom sessions before leading pupils in practical lessons.\n\nHe somewhat modestly said: “I’ve been in the classrooms with the young lads and girls as well. I’ve just been helping them out and giving them ideas of what it feels like to come into football late, the way I did.”\n\nCardiff’s website said of him: “Having risen from non-league football to the Premier League, Craig Noone has shown what a player can do for a club both on and off the pitch, and is remembered fondly by the Bluebirds faithful for his part in helping the club soar to historic new heights.”\n\nIn March 2015, Noone leapt at the chance to play at Anfield again, all in a good cause, when he was part of Jamie Carragher’s team against a Steven Gerrard side in an All Star Charity match.\n\nNoone spent five years at Cardiff, scoring 19 goals in 170 appearances, but in the summer of 2017 manager Neil Warnock went public in suggesting the winger should look for another club. That move came in September 2017 when he joined fellow Championship side Bolton Wanderers on a two-year deal. He went on to score twice in 65 games for Bolton, where he once again found himself lining up alongside Buckley.\n\nIn 2019, Noone went Down Under to continue his career, linking up with A-League side Melbourne City FC, one of the sister clubs to Manchester City – the team Aaron Mooy was playing for before he returned to England.\n\n“It’s a big life-change, but it’s something that I’m looking forward to,” he told a-league.com/au. “I like a challenge. The previous clubs I’ve been at it’s always been a challenge, whether it’s going for promotion or staying in the league.”\n\nCity football boss Michael Petrillo said of the new signing: “Craig is a creative, pacey wide player who, after playing at the highest level in the UK, will bring a lot in experience and threat to the team.\n\n“Craig is a proven goalscorer and provider who is just as comfortable cutting inside and shooting from range as he is at linking up with his fullback and delivering dangerous crosses.”\n\nAfter two years with Melbourne, Noone switched to Macarthur FC in South West Sydney for the 2021-22 season.\n\n• Pictures from Albion’s matchday programme and online sources.\n\nAARON MOOY spent a year as a Manchester City player without playing a game for the club and left Brighton only seven months into a three-and-a-half-year contract.\n\nSuch is the at-times puzzling nature of moves in the modern game where multiple club ownership is a factor and players have release clauses inserted into contracts before they’ve set foot onto the field for their new club.\n\nHaving starred for City’s sister club Melbourne City in his native Australia, Mooy switched to the rather better-known City Football Group operation – Manchester City FC – in June 2016, signing a three-year deal with the English Premier League side.\n\nHis arrival coincided with Pep Guardiola taking over the reins at the Etihad and was one of the first moves between the various clubs bought by the Abu Dhabi-owned City Football Group.\n\nBrian Marwood, managing director of City Football Services, said at the time: “Aaron is an extremely talented player who possesses the attributes we hope to foster and encourage within the City Football Group.\n\n“With the unique model CFG provides, Aaron’s move to Manchester allows us to further expose him to a high standard of opportunities to ensure his professional growth.”\n\nHowever, just six days later, Mooy was sent on loan to Championship side Huddersfield Town, where he ended up spending three seasons.\n\nHe was their player of the year as he helped them to win promotion from the Championship via the play-offs in 2017, he signed permanently for Town and then featured in their two seasons back in the Premier League.\n\nBut when they were relegated from the elite in 2019, he didn’t fancy dropping back down and seized the opportunity provided by Brighton to remain in the top division. Town neatly got him to pen a new three-year deal before allowing him to join the Seagulls on loan.\n\nHuddersfield head coach Jan Siewert said: “Aaron was adamant that he wanted to test himself again in the Premier League when Brighton’s interest came in, and we didn’t want an issue where we had a disillusioned player on the pitch in the final year of his contract.”\n\nHowever, after he’d made 15 appearances (plus three off the bench) in the first half of Graham Potter’s first season in charge, the 29-year-old was signed on a permanent basis on 24 January 2020 on “undisclosed terms”.\n\n“He’s been an important player for us and will have a key part to play going forward,” said Potter. “We knew what Aaron would bring, and he’s proved to be an excellent addition to our squad and a great professional both on and off the pitch.”\n\nMooy’s deal with Brighton was not due to expire until June 2023 but, sensing one day he might have the opportunity to make big money in China, his contract at both Huddersfield and Brighton contained a clause allowing him to be released if a Chinese club offered to pay £4m – which, in the summer of 2020, Shanghai Port FC were willing to do.\n\nMaybe the player also sensed the arrival at Brighton of Adam Lallana, together with the emergence of Alexis Mac Allister, might mean reduced playing time in the Premiership. However, perhaps the lure of being paid £60,000 a week to play the game he’s loved since a boy back home watching David Beckham on the TV might just have swayed it.\n\nThe shaven-headed Mooy had often stood out when playing for Huddersfield against Brighton and their fans were full of admiration for him. David Wood on Twitter said: “It was an absolute privilege to watch Aaron Mooy wear the blue and white of Huddersfield Town. A true class act.” Graeme Rayner added: “Without doubt the best player I’ve seen in a Town shirt. He was immense for us. He gave us some great memories, and was a model pro.”\n\nSeagulls supporters took to him quickly too. ‘Farehamseagull’ on North Stand Chat declared: “Mooy is a wonderful player for us. We’ve been crying out for a player like him for years. His ability on the ball and appreciation of space is second to none. You can just always rely on him to make the right decision with the ball; that is a talent only truly gifted players who can see the game two, three moves ahead have.”\n\nMooy certainly shone in games against Spurs and Arsenal but possibly his best performance in a Brighton shirt came in the 28 December 2019 home game against Bournemouth when his 79th minute goal completed a 2-0 win for the Seagulls.\n\nNewspaper headlines hailed the Australian’s contribution to the win and Sky Sports commentator Alan Smith capped the lot in analysing Mooy’s goal. “What a way to settle it,” he said. “Shades of Dennis Bergkamp here, the way he took it on his chest and chipped it in.\n\n“A quite brilliant goal from a really talented player. Great awareness and look at that finish. Bergkamp would’ve been proud.”\n\nMooy was born in Sydney on 15 September 1990. His German father walked out when he was a toddler and his Dutch mother, Sam, brought him up using her maiden surname. Mooy has said his earliest football memories were of playing for Carlingford Redbacks who were coached by his stepdad, Alan Todd.\n\nHis early life, as chronicled by Hale Hendrix on lifeblogger.com, was pretty much football obsessed and he went to the same high school, Westfield Sports High, as Albion goalkeeper Mat Ryan (who was in the year below). Former Leeds and Liverpool player Harry Kewell also went to Westfield.\n\nMooy played for Sydney-based Hajduk Wanderers and the former National Soccer League team Northern Spirit FC, as well as enhancing his potential at the New South Wales Institute of Sport, based at Sydney Olympic Park, an organisation which nurtures the country’s high performing sports people.\n\nBut he was spotted playing for his school as a 14-year-old by Bolton Wanderers’ former head of youth Chris Sulley and he was invited to the UK with his family for an assessment.\n\n“It was a big decision to move to England but I knew it was a great opportunity,” Mooy told the Bolton News.\n\nA serious knee injury threatened to halt his progress but Wanderers’ youth team coaches were convinced they had an outstanding prospect who was eager to earn a professional contract.\n\nIn his third season as a scholar, he managed to get some minutes in Alan Cork’s reserve team, and he said: “It’s a big year for me and I have got to show the coaches what I have got, so when I got injured, I knew I had to get back as quickly as possible.\n\n“My rehabilitation involved lots of weight sessions and time on the bike, but I am feeling much sharper now.”\n\nUnfortunately for Mooy, the club’s then-manager, Gary Megson, thought it unlikely he would develop into first-team material – a decision which baffled former Wanderers youth team coach, Peter Farrell.\n\n“I couldn’t believe they released him,” Farrell told Bolton News reporter Marc Iles. “I always thought he was going to make it as a footballer but, as with anything, it’s all about opportunity.\n\n“If Big Sam would have been in charge, or Phil Brown would have taken over I think he would still be there now. They valued that type of player and built their team around him.\n\n“For me, Aaron had it all – he could go with his left foot, his right foot, he was physically strong on the ball and I don’t think he has changed at all from what I saw of him playing for Huddersfield.”\n\nHe added: “People thought he was maybe a bit lazy. You’ll never see him tackle. You need players around him to do that. But he reminds me a bit of Zidane – he’s even got the bald head.\n\n“He isn’t as good a player, of course, but he has that grace about the way he plays. He’s a lovely balanced player but he wasn’t Gary Megson’s type of player, and that was the end of it.”\n\nSix months after he left Bolton, Mooy surprisingly turned up in the unlikely surroundings of Paisley, Scotland, for a two-year stint at Scottish Premier League St Mirren (where former Albion midfielder Steven Thomson was at the other end of his career).\n\n“It was a big decision to leave Bolton,” he told The Daily Record at the time. “But I wanted to try to get some first-team action and I’m doing that so I’m happy.\n\n“Some people were a little surprised, but it didn’t bother me. I just thought I wasn’t really going to get much of a chance at Bolton. At St Mirren, I knew I was going to get some decent game time.”\n\nMooy later told The Scottish Sun: “St Mirren was the start for me. It was the first time I had really experienced proper football. I always remember how much I learned there. I was in the reserves at Bolton, but St Mirren was the first club I was at where winning and collecting points mattered hugely and I had to buy into that mentality.”\n\nMooy featured in 18 matches for Danny Lennon’s side in the 2010-11 season but he suffered a stress fracture in his back during pre-season and he managed only 12 appearances in 2011-12 and was released on a free transfer at the end of it.\n\nAt that point he decided to return to Australia and he joined Western Sydney Wanderers on a two-year deal. Mooy’s story was told excellently by Paul Doyle in The Guardian in a November 2017 article. He wrote:“Although he did well at Western Sydney, even there he was not a guaranteed starter, having to compete with two other players for a deep midfield spot as the team’s playmaking rights were entrusted to Shinji Ono, the former Japan international and 2002 Asian player of the year who would end his career in Australia.”\n\nAt the end of his contract, Mooy moved on to Melbourne City where he had an impressive 2015-16 campaign in which he was named Australian Players’ Player of the Year after scoring 17 goals from midfield and setting an A-League assist record.\n\nAlthough Man City sent him to Huddersfield on loan, news of his strong performances hadn’t escaped Guardiola’s attention, as he noted in media interviews before Town took on City in the FA Cup in January 2017. “Aaron Mooy is playing amazing this season and we are glad at that,” Guardiola said. “It is not easy coming from Australia and going to the Championship and play as good as he is.\n\n“We are going to consider what will happen at the end of the season but it’s good.”\n\nMooy responded to Guardiola’s praise, telling Huddersfield’s official website: “It’s obviously excellent and I’m very humbled and all that sort of stuff.\n\n“It’s great to know he’s watching me and has his eye on how I’m doing, that’s great.\n\n“They come to watch the games and stay in contact and hopefully they like what they see,” he said.\n\nThe Manchester Evening News even ran a story about Mooy headlined ‘The midfielder who could save Pep Guardiola and Man City a fortune this summer’.\n\nHowever, at the end of June 2017, with Huddersfield preparing for their return to the Premier League, Mooy made the switch from City permanent for a club record fee of £8m.\n\nBoss David Wagner told BBC Radio Leeds: “He was one of our key targets because he was the heart of our team last season.\n\n“When we had the chance to get him permanently, we all agreed that we needed to get it done as quickly as we could.”\n\nChairman Dean Hoyle added: “Aaron made it very clear to us last season that he wanted to play in the Premier League this season and, if we were there, he would want to do that with us.\n\n“I think we had a duty to try to make that happen for him because he made a huge contribution last season. He was a true terrier for us.”\n\nMooy drew praise for his role in Wagner’s gegenpressing style of play – bringing an energy and creative use of the ball in a slightly deep-lying midfield role – and Doyle observed in his Guardian article: “Strong on the ball, genuinely two-footed and blessed with vision and precision, he is the conduit of most Terriers attacks and never shirks defensive duties in a team that made more tackles than any other Premier League side during the first 12 matches of the season.”\n\nThrough his parents, Mooy could have played internationally for Germany or the Netherlands but he opted to play for the country where he was born and has played at several age group levels for the Australian national side. He made his full debut in 2012, scoring in a 9-0 win over Guam, and has since won more than 40 caps.\n\nAfter Mooy played well for Australia at the 2018 World Cup, there was speculation City might activate a £20m buy-back clause but this was an unfounded rumour and reporter Stuart Brennan said in the Manchester Evening News: “Mooy has been playing well but has not done enough to suggest he could handle the rarefied atmosphere of Pep Guardiola’s midfield.”\n\nCity’s loss was Huddersfield and Brighton’s gain, but amongst the reasons suggested for his sudden departure after only a season with the Seagulls was Shanghai taking advantage of an overseas players loophole which allows Australian players to be counted as Asian.\n\nMooy certainly hit the ground running in China, scoring within 25 minutes of making his debut on his 30th birthday. He came off the bench in Shanghai’s 2-1 win against Wuhan Zall, scoring the winner after fellow Premier League export Marko Arnautovic had scored Shanghai’s first.\n\nMooy scored with a delightful one-two down the flank and easy chip over the onrushing keeper.\n\n“I have only just arrived so my physical condition is not what it could be,” Mooy told Chinese television after the game.\n\n“The coach asked me before kick-off if I could play some part in the game and of course I was happy to do so.”\n\nMooy’s career has certainly been of interest to a number of football observers around the world and Marco Jackson chipped in on onsideview.com, discussing the rationale behind his move to China.\n\nMooy’s recent playing time has been non-existent because the Chinese Super League is having a three-and-a-half month break to enable the national side to prepare for World Cup qualifiers. The West Australian reported on 4 October 2021 how Mooy had returned to Scotland to be with his family while keeping fit working on a programme devised by Socceroos strength and conditioning coach Andrew Clark.\n\nA CAREER highlight saw Welshman Mark Walton keep goal for Norwich City in a FA Cup semi-final in front of 40,000 at Hillsborough but his time with the Seagulls was marred by Brighton’s boo boys.\n\nWalton’s first action in an Albion shirt was in front of only a few Albion followers because Brian Horton signed him in the summer of 1998 when the side was playing in exile at Gillingham’s Priestfield Stadium.\n\nWalton, who’d been part of Micky Adams’ fourth tier Fulham promotion side in 1996-97, found himself out of favour at Craven Cottage once Kevin Keegan had been installed as manager following the club’s takeover by Mohamed Al-Fayed.\n\nNot wishing to play second fiddle to Northern Ireland international Maik Taylor, Walton moved for £20,000 to Brighton, who were a ‘keeper light after Nicky Rust’s departure to Barnet. Walton was Horton’s first choice between the sticks in the opening 16 games of the season.\n\n“When Maik arrived, it was a matter of when I went rather than anything else,” he told fulhamfocus.com. “I was at a stage in my career that I just wanted to play, so moving was a necessity. In retrospect, I probably should have thought harder about my decision to join Brighton.”\n\nAfter he’d shipped six goals in two successive 3-1 defeats in October, young Mark Ormerod took over and kept the ‘keeper’s jersey until Horton quit to take over at Port Vale shortly into the new year.\n\nCaretaker boss, Jeff Wood, who’d been a goalkeeper himself, reinstated Walton to the starting line-up for five matches, but he damaged a hamstring in a 3-0 defeat at Southend on 20 February and didn’t play again that season.\n\nWalton must have been encouraged when his old boss Adams took over from Wood, and he shed a stone and a half during the summer to get back into shape. Although Ormerod started the first five games of the new season back in Brighton, Walton was then reinstated as first choice ‘keeper.\n\nBut a gaffe — wearebrighton.com recounted how Walton’s attempted clearance from a back pass cannoned into the back of Paul Watson and into the net for an own goal — as Albion succumbed 3-2 to previously winless Chester City on 18 September (despite a goalscoring debut for Danny Cullip) saw feelings running high.\n\nAdams had the players in for an extra training session the following day and Walton was dropped for the next match. Before the month was over, he submitted a transfer request citing the stick he was receiving as his reason for wanting to go.\n\n“It’s one of those things you cannot really do too much about,” he told The Argus. “I am not the first and I won’t be the last. Everybody hears it. It’s just general abuse from boo boys and it’s the same home and away.\n\n“It is obviously not the best feeling in the world, but you are paid to do a job and you go out and give your best.”\n\nThe manager was clearly upset that Walton felt he had to leave because of criticism from supporters.\n\n“I’m immensely disappointed that a boy has come in to see me and wants to leave the club because he feels he is not being given a fair crack of the whip by the fans,” Adams told The Argus. “I am disappointed it has come to this and that he feels he has got to bow to fan pressure.\n\n“Mark is a great lad. Whichever eleven lads I put out on the pitch in the blue and white stripes, they are representing Albion and the fans have got to get behind them. They are going out to give their best for the supporters and the club.”\n\nSupport came too from part-time goalkeeping coach John Keeley, who said: “Mark looks ever so fit now and the way he has trained and looked after himself in the summer shows he wants to prove to people he is a good goalie.\n\n“As a goalkeeper you want the crowd on your side because it gives you a certain amount of confidence, especially when you are playing at home.”\n\nAdams showed his faith in Walton by restoring him to the starting line-up and he was rewarded for his loyalty by two shut-outs on the road as Albion drew 0-0 at Peterborough and beat Carlisle United 1-0.\n\nThe matchday programme noted of the big ‘keeper’s performance at London Road: “Walton didn’t put a foot, or should that be hand, wrong during the 90 minutes, prompting praise from supporters, who chanted his name at the final whistle.”\n\nAdams added: “Mark was terrific. I cannot speak highly enough of him. He is a good, honest pro and he answered his critics.”\n\nWalton collected a player of the month award for conceding only one goal in five matches during October. He kept the shirt for the rest of the season, only missing two games towards the end, and playing a total of 45 games.\n\nBut the last-day 1-0 home win over Carlisle United turned out to be his last for the Seagulls. It was reported he’d verbally agreed a new contract but just before the start of the new season he chose to move on to Cardiff, along the road from where he was born in Merthyr Tydfil on 1 June 1969.\n\nAs it turned out, the move worked out well all round because Walton helped the Bluebirds win promotion from Division Three as runners up behind the Seagulls in top spot, Adams having unearthed a more than capable replacement in Michel Kuipers.\n\nIn an interview with Dan Smith in 2018 for fulhamfocus.com, Walton explained how his footballing life began at South Wales valleys village side Georgetown Boys Club and, because he suffered from severe asthma when he was 12, he decided it would be better to play in goal than in an outfield position. He was inspired by Phil Parkes of West Ham, Jimmy Rimmer of Aston Villa and Everton’s Neville Southall.\n\nWalton played youth team football for Swansea City but his first senior professional club was Luton Town, where he spent six months. With the experienced Les Sealey and Andy Dibble ahead of him, he wasn’t able to break through to the first team. He moved initially on loan to Colchester United, managed by Mike Walker, who’d previously kept goal for the Us after a distinguished career at Watford.\n\nWalker gave him his debut at Layer Road as an 18-year-old in August 1987 and he went on to make a total of 56 appearances for United, having moved permanently for £17,500 in December 1987, by which time Roger Brown was in charge.\n\nWalker, meanwhile, had moved on to take charge of Norwich’s reserve side and, on his recommendation, City signed the Welsh goalkeeper for £75,000 in 1989.\n\n“I owe Mike Walker a debt of gratitude to this day, as he basically taught me from scratch and helped develop me into a solid keeper with a sound technique,” Walton told Ed Couzens-Lake in a 2013 article for myfootballwriter.com.\n\nWalton spent most of his three years at Carrow Road as understudy to first choice Bryan Gunn. It was because of a serious back injury to Gunn that Walton found himself facing Sunderland in the 1992 FA Cup semi-final, when a single goal from John Byrne settled the tie.\n\nLooking back on his time with the Canaries, Walton told Couzens-Lake: “I loved my football and I loved Norwich, and, for me, it is still ‘my club’. The camaraderie of the dressing room was fantastic – indeed, whilst I don’t miss playing one bit, I do miss the changing room banter, all the characters, bad and good, and those shared triumphs, disasters and the shared sense of humour.”\n\nThe admirable Flown From The Nest website notes Walton made 28 appearances for the first team and 114 for their reserves. He had loan spells with Wrexham and Dundee United, trials with St Johnstone and West Ham, but it was Bolton Wanderers during Bruce Rioch’s reign that he next saw first team action, playing three games for the Trotters.\n\nAfter his release from Norwich, a bizarre series of circumstances which he explained to fulhamfocus.com saw him spend two years out of the game before a Fulham fan, who was a member of the Norfolk cricket club he’d been playing for, wrote to Adams and suggested he give Walton another crack at league football.\n\n“Micky telephoned and invited me for a trial. After three weeks, I was offered a year’s contract,” he said.\n\nWhen ousted by the upheaval at the Cottage, Walton went on loan to Gillingham in March 1998 but couldn’t agree terms for a permanent move and on transfer deadline day ended up back at Norwich on loan as cover for Andy Marshall.\n\nAfter his stint with the Albion and initial success at Cardiff, Walton slipped down the pecking order and briefly tried his luck with a semi-professional side in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nHe returned to South Wales after retiring from playing and went on to gain a first-class sports psychology degree at Cardiff Metropolitan University, a Masters degreeand a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) which led him to become a teacher for 10 years.\n\nHe also worked for Cricket Wales as a researcher and community coach and in January 2021 joined the cricket staff of Glamorgan.\n\n“Cricket has always been a passion of mine,” he told his new employers’ website. “I’ve always played but that became more sporadic when I focused on football, but I always tried to sneak in the odd game here and there which was often in midweek.\n\n“I played some league cricket in Norfolk, Essex and Wales and was able to represent Wales Minor Counties. Then about 20 years ago I fell into coaching and it’s prospered from there and I’ve coached every age group within Cricket Wales.”\n\n• Pictures from the Albion matchday programme and online sources.\n\nMARK FLATTS was destined for a glittering career after breaking into Arsenal’s first team when only eighteen.\n\nIt was the season when George Graham’s side finished in a disappointing 10th place in the league but won the League Cup and the FA Cup, beating Sheffield Wednesday in both competitions.\n\nFlatts got seven starts plus four appearances off the bench and the following season, after he’d been troubled with a few injuries, Graham sent him out on loan to get some games under his belt.\n\nHis first loan was at Cambridge United, then in January 1994 Flatts joined forces with former Gunners legend Liam Brady at Brighton.\n\nThe former midfield maestro who’d graced the game at the highest level as a player had not long arrived at the Goldstone Ground, creating a buzz of anticipation amongst the largely disillusioned Albion faithful.\n\nBrighton were bumping along around the foot of the third tier table when he arrived and it augured well that Brady could use his connections with his former club to secure the services of a prodigious young talent who’d already played a handful of matches in the Premier League.\n\nHe made his debut in a cracking 4-1 New Year’s Day home win over Cambridge United when Kurt Nogan scored a hat-trick and he was only on the losing side twice during his two months at the club, helping the Albion move away from the relegation zone.\n\nBrady wrote about it in his autobiography Born To Be A Footballer, describing how “livewire” Flatts had heated up “a freezing Goldstone” on that debut day. “He’s a lovely young kid off the field but on the park there’s a strut about him. That’s exactly what we need. He’s full of tricks.”\n\nFlatts started nine matches, came on as a sub once, and scored one of Albion’s goals in a 3-2 home win over Blackpool, but it was his skill on the ball and pace that fans enjoyed most.\n\nAfter he had returned to Highbury, Brady thanked him for his contribution and said in his programme notes: “He gave the place a tremendous lift. He’s a very confident lad and he did us a real favour and hopefully he’s got something out of it as well. I think he has and I think he enjoyed his time with us.”\n\nFlatts confirmed as much recently. Although he has kept a low profile for many years, in 2020, online from his home in Norfolk, he appeared in two podcasts talking about his career.\n\nOn the Shoot the Defence podcast in April 2020, Flatts talked admiringly of his time under Brady at Brighton – “He still had it in training” – as well as the experience of playing alongside senior pros Jimmy Case and Steve Foster at the Goldstone Ground.\n\n“Loyal fans as well. It was a good time,” he said. “I got on well with the fans and a few of them still text me, so that’s nice. Liam Brady and Jimmy Case had seen me in a few games, said they wanted me on loan, and I went there and enjoyed it.”\n\nBorn in Islington on 14 October 1972 and brought up in Wood Green, Flatts played for Haringey Borough and Middlesex County school teams and he was playing for Enfield Rangers when he caught the eye of professional clubs.\n\nHe spent time training with Watford and West Ham, but his mum and older brother were Arsenal fans so, when they invited him to join them, it was no contest. The scout responsible for picking him up for the Gunners was the former Brighton wing-half, Steve Burtenshaw.\n\nFlatts was one of the country’s top talented 14-year-olds who went through the FA National School of Excellence at Lilleshall before becoming a trainee at Highbury after graduating.\n\nIn the first edition of a new fans’ podcast Over and Over and Over Again on 20 August 2020, Flatts talked about how he, Andy Cole and Paul Dickov up front, Ray Parlour and Ian Selley in midfield, Scott Marshall at the back and Alan Miller in goal were all going through from youth team to reserves at the same time. “It was a good strong youth team,” he said. “Pat Rice was the youth team manager who brought us through. He was a good coach.”\n\nFlatts signed professional in December 1990 and he progressed to the reserve side who were managed by another Arsenal legend, George Armstrong.\n\nOne particular reserve match stands out as memorable – but not because Flatts scored a goal in a 2-2 draw. Ordinarily, Flatts was accustomed to playing in front of a few hundred supporters for the second string, but on 16 February 1991 it’s reckoned more than 10,000 turned up.\n\nThe Ovenden Papers Football Combination game against Reading was originally scheduled to be an away fixture but freezing conditions meant the game was swapped to Highbury because it had undersoil heating.\n\nThe reason for the surge of interest was the match saw the return to playing of Tony Adams after his release from prison, having served half of his four-month sentence for drink driving. The amazing response of the Arsenal faithful was remembered in this football.london article in February 2018.\n\nOften niggled by injuries, Flatts was sidelined by one he hadn’t even been aware of, other than what felt like a small discomfort. “I got a stress fracture on my ankle and was playing on it for a month without realising,” he said.\n\nPhysio Gary Lewin arranged for him to see a Harley Street specialist and it was only after he was put through tests on a running machine that the problem was diagnosed. The injury required surgery that put him out of action for over a year.\n\nFlatts got his first real involvement with the first team on a pre-season tour of Norway ahead of the 1992-93 season, getting on as a substitute against Stabaek and Brann Bergen. He was a non-playing sub in two subsequent pre-season friendlies away to Wolves and Peterborough.\n\nIt was back to reserve team football at the start of the season but Graham selected him to travel with the squad for an away game at Sheffield United on 19 September and he made his competitive debut as a 71st minute substitute for Anders Limpar, shortly before Ian Wright netted an equaliser for the Gunners.\n\nHis next involvement came in a third round League Cup encounter with Derby County. He was a non-playing sub in the away tie but started in Limpar’s place for the replay on 1 December 1992, when Arsenal edged it 2-1.\n\nHe kept his place for the league game which followed four days later but was subbed off as Arsenal lost 1-0 at Southampton.\n\nAt one point, the Islington Gazette declared Flatts, Neil Heaney, Parlour and Dickov as the “next crop of Arsenal starlets who will take the club forward”.\n\nAs the year drew to a close, on 19 December, Flatts earned rave reviews for his showing in a 1-1 home draw against Lennie Lawrence’s Middlesbrough.\n\n“It’s very unusual to have a quick player with a brain,” said manager Graham. “Mark has skill but he also has the application to go with it.”\n\nWriting about how brightly Flatts shone in the game, Trevor Haylett, of the Independent, said: “He possesses an easy and deceptive running style which frequently carried him away from markers, and has a confidence that few of his colleagues shared in a desultory first 45 minutes.”\n\nHaylett observed: “The problem for Graham is that his most productive line-up, with Merson in the ‘hole’ to distribute and ghost into scoring areas, leaves no room for Flatts, who amply justified his manager’s contention that he has a ‘very big future in the game’.”\n\nFlatts kept his place for the following match, a goalless Boxing Day home draw against Ipswich Town, and was back on the bench away to Aston Villa three days later but came on for the second half in a game Arsenal lost 1-0.\n\nThe game he remembers most fondly came just over a fortnight later away to Manchester City at Maine Road. He sped past two players and crossed it for Paul Merson to score with a near post header that gave Arsenal a 1-0 win.\n\nBut competition for places was intense and he didn’t next get a start until 1 March against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, another game that finished goalless.\n\nHe had to wait until May for his next involvement, as a sub in a 1-0 defeat away to Sheffield Wednesday, who his teammates would play twice in the space of five days later that month to win the FA Cup on penalties, both games having ended in draws.\n\nWith the first of those matches only four days away, Graham put out a young side to face Spurs in the last league game of the season, and Flatts was part of a side who lost the north London derby 3-1, Dickov getting the Arsenal goal.\n\nAfter his loan spell at Brighton, Flatts got back into the first team picture at Arsenal towards the end of the 1993-94 season, featuring in three successive league games: as a sub in a 1-1 draw with Wimbledon and starting in a 2-1 win at Villa and a 1-1 home draw against QPR.\n\nWhile he travelled to Copenhagen with the squad for the European Cup Winners’ Cup Final on 4 May 1994, he didn’t play in the Gunners’ 1-0 win.\n\nFlatts wasn’t back in the Arsenal first team set-up until December 1994, when he had a four-game spell, starting in a 2-2 draw away to Nottingham Forest, being a non-playing sub away to Manchester City and then coming on as a sub in a 3-1 defeat at home to Leeds on 17 December and in the goalless Boxing Day home match with Aston Villa.\n\nHe came off the bench in a third round FA Cup replay defeat to Millwall on 18 January 1995 but the following month the manager who had supported his development was sacked, and the young wideman went out on loan to Bristol City.\n\nFlatts didn’t reckon much of the man management skills of Graham’s temporary successor, Stewart Houston, but it was the manager who eventually succeeded him who showed the youngster the door.\n\n“Bruce Rioch took over, and said: ‘No, you’re not good enough’ and that was it,” Flatts recalled. He had another short loan spell, this time at Grimsby Town, in the 1995-96 season, but when his contract was up in 1996, he was given a free transfer.\n\nWhen Flatts left the famous marble halls of Highbury, all that early promise rapidly evaporated and despite a handful of trials at several clubs, his career fizzled out, the player admitting he fell out of love with the game.\n\nInitially, he headed off to Italy to try his luck with Torino in Serie B. He said while he enjoyed his few months there, a limit on the number of foreign players who could play at any one time edged him out of the picture.\n\nAccording to arseweb.com, back in the UK he had trial periods with Manchester City (September 1996) and Watford (October 1986), although the scathing Hornets fans website, Blind, Stupid and Desperate has a less than flattering summary of his efforts to impress at Vicarage Road. He was briefly at Kettering Town in December 1996, then Barnet (1997-98 pre-season) and Colchester United (1999-00 pre-season) but none of them took him on.\n\nFormer Arsenal striker Martin Hayes, manager at Ryman League Division One side Bishop’s Stortford, signed him during the 1999-00 season.\n\nAnd his last appearance on a team-sheet was as an unused substitute for Queens Park Rangers in a 2000-01 pre-season 4-2 away defeat at Dr Martens League Premier Division side Crawley Town.\n\nFlatts told host Richie Wakelin on Over and Over and Over Again that he kept on picking up niggling injuries too regularly. “With fitness concerns, I just lost interest,” he said. “I ain’t got no regrets. I loved it at Arsenal. I loved playing football. George Graham had faith in me and he gave me a go.”\n\nHe said his teenage son and daughter both play football and he has done some coaching at a local level and has considered setting up his own coaching school. He has also done some scouting work for Cambridge United and Norwich City.\n\nPictures from Albion’s matchday programmes and various online sources.\n\nJOURNEYMAN striker Calvin Andrew is unlikely to forget his eventful months playing for the Seagulls on loan from Crystal Palace.\n\nThe Luton-born forward got off to a great start in January 2009 when he scored a 90th-minute winner on his debut for the Seagulls.\n\nIn only his fourth game, he damaged a hamstring against his hometown club – a match that turned out to be the last for the manager who’d brought him in on loan.\n\nWhile Andrew was back at Selhurst Park recovering from the injury, a new boss – but familiar face – took charge at the Withdean.\n\nAndrew rejoined the Seagulls but couldn’t force his way into the starting line-up because Lloyd Uwusu had arrived to take centre stage. However, the loanee scored two vital goals in Albion’s ‘Great Escape’ when going on as a substitute.\n\nTo cap it all, in the nail-biting last game of the season, when Brighton just preserved their League One status with a 1-0 win over Stockport County, Andrew suffered a horrific injury which sidelined him for six months.\n\nAndrew, who had lost his place at Palace after picking up an injury at the start of the season, had joined the Seagulls as part of a major January transfer window overhaul Micky Adams oversaw in an attempt to revive the club’s flagging League One fortunes.\n\nWhen he signed, Adams said: “Calvin is a young centre-forward and will complement our existing forwards by giving us an added physical presence up front.\n\n“He is over six-foot tall and the type of striker who makes things happen and can be a real handful for opposing defenders.”\n\nThe player himself, who had only joined Palace the previous summer for a £30,000 fee, said: “I went there and at the start of the season I was playing games and I was doing well. But then the situation changed. I got injured and since then I haven’t been able to get back in the team.\n\n“The team has been doing really well and it’s totally understandable from my point of view. Neil Warnock still rates me highly, but he wants me to go out and get some games and get myself ready for when my chance does come.\n\n“It was quite an easy decision. There were a few clubs in for me, but Brighton is relatively close to where I’m living so it was an easy choice. It’s a good club.\n\n“I didn’t know any of the players, but I knew the manager. He’s a great manager and I’m looking forward to playing for him. Everybody knows about Nicky Forster. He’s an experienced player and there’s always something to learn as well as forming a good partnership.”\n\nWith Forster scoring Albion’s first against Hartlepool United at the Withdean on 31 January 2009, the script looked like it had been perfectly written when Andrew netted a winner in the last minute to seal a 2-1 victory.\n\nUnfortunately, successive home defeats – 4-2 to Peterborough United and 2-0 to Carlisle United – in five days followed by elimination from the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy at Luton the following week was too much for Adams to stomach and he decided to quit after meeting chairman Dick Knight the day before the next match, which ironically saw Albion win 1-0 at Millwall.\n\nAndrew wasn’t involved because he’d picked up a hamstring injury at Kenilworth Road, a ground where he’d made a first team debut as a 17-year-old in the 2004-05 season. Born in Luton on 19 December 1986, Andrew was a prolific goalscorer as a youth player at his hometown club.\n\nWhen he was sent out on loan to gain experience at League Two Grimsby Town in 2005, he played nine matches under manager Russell Slade.\n\nAnd it was Slade who was parachuted in at the Withdean to try to steer Albion away from the League One relegation trapdoor in the Spring of 2009.\n\nEven though Albion picked up only four points from Slade’s first seven games in charge, the former Yeovil boss slowly turned things around with four wins in the next five games to lift the Seagulls out of the bottom four.\n\nAndrew spoke about the change in fortunes in an Argus interview. He told reporter Steve Hollis: “We have shown different qualities which I don’t think we had when I was at the club before my injury. There is some real resilience now.\n\n“I know Russell Slade quite well and he asks all of his teams to show some grit when the going gets tough. He demands you stick in there when you are struggling and to keep going.”\n\nAndrew was buoyant having headed the winner from Gary Hart’s cross in the 52nd minute at Bristol Rovers after leaving the bench before half-time to replace the injured Dean Cox.\n\n“That was a big goal,” he said. “It was important for me because I am coming back from injury but it was more important for the club and the town.\n\n“I usually hang around the back post when I am playing on the left but Dean White told me to get into attacking positions and it was a cross you dream about from Hart.”\n\nHe told Hollis: “When I initially had the injury, my fear was that I wouldn’t play again this season. I had a very bad tear in two places in the hamstring and was told it would take a very long time to repair.\n\n“Fortunately, I seem to recover pretty quickly, and I am glad because I want to play a part in helping Albion stay up. It means a lot for me that Brighton stay up, even though I am only on loan.\n\n“I have been made to not only feel part of the team but part of the town and it would be awful to go down.\n\n“The supporters have been great and welcomed me even though I am from a rival team, so it is my duty to give 110 per cent. Just because I am on loan doesn’t make any difference.”\n\nAndrew had to contend himself with another appearance from the bench in the following match but, again, he made a positive impact after replacing Hart, who limped off injured after only nine minutes of the game at Huddersfield.\n\nThe young striker levelled up the game after Town had taken the lead and Owusu continued his purple patch of form by netting a second equaliser to give Albion a share of the spoils.\n\nPalace boss Warnock had been contemplating recalling Andrew but was told he would start in Albion’s crunch final home game against Stockport County. In fact, Slade once again opted to use Gary Hart in the starting line-up instead but Andrew was sent on in injured Hart’s place after only 17 minutes and went close to breaking the deadlock with a header that hit the top of the bar.\n\nForster, who had also been troubled by injury throughout the season, had to replace Andrew for the second half because he picked up an anterior cruciate knee ligament injury which ultimately prevented him playing for six months.\n\nIt wasn’t until October 2009 that Andrew got back playing for Palace reserves, and their assistant manager, Mick Jones told the club’s website: “Calvin played for half-an-hour on Monday. He is miles ahead of schedule following one of the worst injuries I have ever seen.”\n\nThe 2009-10 season saw Palace in all sorts of trouble: going into administration, Warnock departing as a result, Paul Hart taking over as manager, and the side only narrowly avoiding relegation. Andrew got 13 starts as Palace battled at the wrong end of the Championship, but he was more often a substitute, coming off the bench on 19 occasions.\n\nWith game time limited under new boss George Burley the following season, Andrew once again went out on loan: briefly to feature in three games for fellow Championship side Millwall in November, and in the New Year to League One Swindon Town, where his old Palace boss Hart was in charge.\n\nAlthough he was involved in the Palace set-up at the start of the 2011-12 season, by the following March he went out on loan again, this time reuniting with Slade at Leyton Orient. He only started two matches, though, and didn’t score in any of the 10 games played while he was at Brisbane Road.\n\nAt the end of the season, Palace boss Dougie Freedman didn’t offer Andrew a new contract. His next stop saw him link up with League Two Port Vale on a two-month deal under former Albion boss Adams.\n\nWhile he managed to earn a contract until the end of the season, he only started eight matches and was used as a substitute on 15 occasions.\n\nWith no new deal in the offing, he then switched to another League Two side, Mansfield Town, for the first part of 2013-14 before joining York City in the closing months.\n\nIt was in the summer of 2014 that he finally found a more permanent berth, at Rochdale, who’d been newly promoted to League One.\n\nIn six seasons at Spotland, Andrew scored 28 goals in 231 appearances and over four years was recognised as a ‘community champion’ for the amount of work he did in the local community, including school visits and involvement with the club’s women’s teams. In 2020, he was declared the League One PFA Community Champion.\n\nOne blot on his copybook came in 2016 when he was handed a 12-match FA ban (later reduced to nine games) after video evidence found him guilty of elbowing Oldham’s Peter Clarke in the face in an incident the referee missed.\n\nAfter leaving Rochdale, he didn’t get fixed up with a new club until March 2021, when he joined Barrow AFC until the end of the season.\n\n• Pictures from matchday programmes.\n\nROBERT CODNER, Brighton’s first black captain in the early ‘90s, was an enigma for plenty of managers throughout his playing days but, by his own admission, the much-maligned Barry Lloyd got the best out of him.\n\nA dynamic midfielder with a terrific shot in his locker, Codner made way more appearances for the Albion than any other club he went to and his attachment to the Seagulls continued into the modern era when he was Solly March’s agent.\n\nOf Lloyd, he told Albion’s matchday programme: “Barry Lloyd was good for me and I don’t think he gets the acknowledgement he deserves as he steered the club through some difficult times. I know I had my moments on and off the pitch, but he always stood by me and backed me all the way.”\n\nBorn in Walthamstow on 23 January 1965, nearby Tottenham Hotspur were Codner’s first club and, although he featured in their youth team alongside future first-teamers Ian Crook, Mark Bowen and Tony Parks, he didn’t take the next step with them.\n\n“It is very difficult to come through at White Hart Lane, they always seemed keener to go and buy someone than risk a youngster,” Codner told Shoot! magazine.\n\nAnd in a matchday programme interview with Dave Beckett, he said: “At 18, Tottenham told me that they wouldn’t put me on a professional contract, so I ended up at Leicester under Gordon Milne for about 18 months.\n\n“I never managed to make a break into the first team which I thought I deserved, and that’s why I left in the end.”\n\nIn a slightly different telling of the story, he said: “At the end of my contract he (Milne) didn’t offer me another one which was a bitter disappointment. I felt let down and was disillusioned with the game.”\n\nAfter a spell working on a building site, he tried to get fixed up with Luton Town but their manager, David Pleat, urged him to get experience playing non-League football while they kept tabs on him.\n\n“That’s why I joined Dagenham for four or five months, but I didn’t particularly like it there, so when Barnet offered me a good deal and Luton said they couldn’t top it, I switched clubs,” he said.\n\nHis form for Barnet brought him selection for the England semi-professional side; Wimbledon showed some interest but in a pre-season game in August 1988, as a triallist for Millwall, he played against the Albion.\n\nBrighton boss Lloyd was sufficiently impressed that he was prepared to fork out what at the time seemed like an amazing sum of £115,000 for a non-league player to give him another chance to make it as a professional. (Only a matter of days previously, Lloyd paid the same sum to secure the services of centre back Nicky Bissett from Barnet).\n\nThe ebullient Barry Fry, Barnet manager at the time, said: “Codner is a super athlete with two good feet, pace and an ability to score goals.”\n\nThe conundrum at the time was that away from football Codner had begun to pursue a successful career in the City, having turned the tables on a would-be finance salesman suggesting he could do a better job.\n\nThe salesman’s employers agreed and Codner was suddenly thrust into the world of advising on unit trusts, pensions, mortgages and insurance.\n\nIt prompted a description of him in that Shoot! article as the ‘City whizz-kid with talent in his boots and balance sheets in his briefcase’.\n\nIn an interview with John Vinicombe in the Argus, Codner denied he was not utterly dedicated to playing.\n\n“That is not so,” he said. “I’m more dedicated because I choose to play. I always believed I would get a second chance after what happened at Leicester, and Brighton have given me that chance.\n\n“Players have to look ahead, and, ten years from now, I want to be comfortably off.\n\n“Of course, I’m ambitious. I want to be a millionaire as a footballer and be a millionaire financial consultant too.\n\n“I’m lucky because I don’t have football as the be all and end all, I play because that’s what I enjoy doing.”\n\nHe added: “People may ridicule me sometimes for carrying on in business as well, but a lot of footballers end up on the scrapheap; I’m determined not to be one of them.\n\n“Having been given a second bite of the cherry, I’ll make sure I don’t end up with nothing.”\n\nHis time with the Seagulls was certainly not a smooth ride, however, and even the club’s own mouthpiece – ie the matchday programme – said: “His time at the Goldstone has not been without controversy. Earlier this season he failed to report on time for the game at West Bromwich Albion.\n\n“At the beginning of the season the manager said he was hoping that Robert would be one of those players who, having benefited from the experience of more than a season in the league, would play a prominent part in the club’s performances this campaign. However, he is still striving to reach a high level of consistency and his name has now been circulated to other clubs as being available for transfer.”\n\nA retrospective article in a subsequent matchday programme also didn’t spare the midfielder’s feelings. “Codner made an immediate impact and went on to score some brilliant goals, but his relationship with the supporters, like his form, eventually blew hot and cold.\n\n“Several clubs were interested in Codner during his time with the Albion, including West Ham, who were reported to have bid £500,000 for the player in 1991.”\n\nCodner was almost a permanent fixture in the no.10 shirt as Albion reached the 1990-91 end-of-season play-offs with the chance to return to the top tier. He scored in the away semi-final leg at Millwall as the Seagulls guaranteed a place in the Wembley final v Notts County with a 6-2 aggregate win.\n\nAfter the disappointment of losing to Neil Warnock’s County, Albion began to implode financially and were relegated at the end of the next season. Codner was still a mainstay of the midfield, though, making more appearances than any other player, and it was a spot he shared with Mark Beeney and Gary Chivers in the 1992-93 campaign.\n\nPerhaps it was fitting that both Codner and Bissett should be the scorers in the first game after Lloyd parted company with the Albion (Martin Hinshelwood was in temporary charge). Bissett’s 89th-minute goal salvaged a point in a 2-2 draw at Hartlepool on 11 December 1993 but Albion supporter The Groundhog remembered Codner’s 54th-minute goal for the Seagulls thus: “You can’t not love a guy who, at Hartlepool’s Victoria Ground in 1993, while the away fans were shielding themselves from freezing sideways daggers of rain blowing in off the North Sea onto the exposed corner terrace, unleashes a 35-yard thunderbolt thwang-er-wang-er-wanging off the underside of the bar to score. You just can’t.”\n\nWhile Codner appeared in new manager Liam Brady’s first game in charge, a 1-0 defeat at home to Bradford City, his off-field demons caught up with him when he had to serve three weeks in Lewes Prison for driving offences.\n\nCodner was restored to the side towards the end of January and retained his place through to the end of the season.\n\nA subsequent matchday programme noted: “He emerged from prison a more focused player, but, after an alleged bust-up with (Liam) Brady, was dropped in early 1995 and then released at the end of the season.”\n\nAlthough Codner had been a regular under Brady in the first half of the 1994-95 season, he didn’t play for the first team again after being part of the side thrashed 4-0 at Crewe Alexandra on 14 January. Brady maintained in his programme notes: “The attitude on the day was not what we were looking for and that’s what contributed largely to losing as badly as we did.”\n\nAfter finally leaving the Albion with more than 260 appearances for the club under his belt, Codner popped up at a multitude of clubs subsequently (Wikipedia lists 17 he was associated with), playing a handful of games for Reading, Peterborough and Southend United, and having a slightly longer spell back at Barnet in the 1996-97 season.\n\nCodner now operates his own Epsom-based football agency, RC Ballers Ltd.\n\nHE took a circuitous route back to his hometown club but full-back Graham Pearce eventually made it to Brentford’s first team after Brighton had resurrected his career and given him a chance to play at the top level of the English game.\n\nPearce was first on Brentford’s books as a teenager between 1971 and 1976, but he didn’t make it as a pro with the Bees and, after also being turned down by QPR, he went non-league, initially with Hillingdon Borough for three years and then Barnet.\n\nWhen Pearce lined up for Barnet in a FA Cup third round tie on 2 January 1982, it must have been beyond his wildest dreams to imagine just over a year later he’d be playing in that competition’s final at Wembley.\n\nBut the steady, assured performances 21-year-old Pearce put in as Alliance Premier League Barnet held Brighton 0-0 before losing 3-1 in a replay at the Goldstone impressed the watching Albion boss Mike Bailey sufficiently to sign him up for the Seagulls.\n\nAlthough he was itching to join, he had to serve a week’s notice with the Putney printer where he had a full-time job because they weren’t in a position to release him sooner.\n\nJust over a year later, when injuries depleted Jimmy Melia’s cup hopefuls the closer they got to a dream Wembley date, Pearce seized his chance to put his own name in print. Circumstances fell just right for him, but it might not have happened if the experienced left-back Sammy Nelson hadn’t been sidelined.\n\nPearce played in the third round 1-1 Goldstone draw with Newcastle – one of six games he played in January 1983 – but he missed the 4-0 demolition of Manchester City in the fourth round and didn’t feature again until 22 March when he was sub for the 2-2 home draw with Liverpool.\n\nBecause versatile Gary Stevens was more than capable of playing alongside Steve Foster, normal centre back partner Steve Gatting was preferred at left-back for 14 matches from the end of January.\n\nBut when right-back Chris Ramsey was suspended for the semi-final against Sheffield Wednesday, Stevens took his spot, Gatting returned to the middle and Pearce slotted in at left-back.\n\nBecause Foster was suspended for the final against Man Utd, Stevens paired up with Gatting in the middle and Pearce retained his place.\n\nEven when Foster returned for the replay, Pearce kept his place because Ramsey had been crocked in the first match and wasn’t fit to play (Melia making the mistake of putting left-footed Gatting at right-back instead of Stevens).\n\nIn a pre-match interview with the Daily Mail, Pearce said: “There’s money to be made from appearing at Wembley but the thrill for me is just being there – a player from non-League who thought his chance of playing league football had gone.”\n\nPearce retained the no.3 shirt at the start of the 1983-84 season back in the second tier but, when Chris Cattlin took over from Melia, he made it clear he wanted someone with more experience in that position.\n\nIn his matchday programme notes he wrote: “With Kieran (O’Regan), Eric Young and Graham Pearce all playing together, we have three players who haven’t been long out of non-League football.\n\n“Normally these players would have been blooded slowly into the side, instead of being plunged in the deep end. They have done well and shown the right attitude, but when we play against aggressive sides away from home, some of their inexperience has been exposed.”\n\nUntil a suitable replacement could be found, Pearce remained in the side and even poked home his first Albion goal in a 4-3 win away to Cambridge United on 29 October 1983.\n\nBut four weeks later, after a 2-2 draw at home to Shrewsbury Town, Cattlin was typically forthright in his next programme notes, declaring: “I was unhappy with our defence and our failings in this department cost us the game.”\n\nPearce and fellow full-back Ramsey were promptly dropped; the left-back berth going to new signing Chris Hutchings from Chelsea.\n\nCattlin had high praise for his new recruit as he said: “Chris Hutchings is an enthusiastic, strong and determined defender and has a lot to offer, he’s also a fine footballer.”\n\nAfter 18 consecutive games, Pearce found himself out of the side for the rest of the season.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that the reserve side for the 1 May 1984 fixture at home to Southampton featured five players (Pearce, Ramsey, Gary Howlett, Gerry Ryan and Neil Smillie) who’d been in the FA Cup Final squad a year earlier.\n\nThe new season was almost three months’ old before Pearce was seen in the first team again, and, ironically, the opponent was once again Shrewsbury.\n\nThe game at the Goldstone finished a goalless draw and, with Hutchings having been switched to right-back, Pearce got a run in the side extending to 19 matches.\n\nUnluckily for him, he was then left out of the side in favour of Martin Keown, who Cattlin managed to bring in on loan from Arsenal, and the future England international quickly proved his calibre.\n\nPearce made one further appearance, in a 2-1 defeat at Middlesbrough, before the end of the season but in the 1985-86 season he finally cemented his place in the side and played a total of 41 matches.\n\nThree days after Christmas 1985, he scored a rare goal as the Seagulls beat Leeds 3-2 at Elland Road. Ian Baird – later to play for the Albion in the old Fourth Division – missed a penalty but scored one of Leeds’ goals and Pearce clinched the winner on a pitch rutted by a rugby league game played on it only two days earlier.\n\nThe matchday programme described the goal thus: “Pearce played a one-two with (Steve) Jacobs and found himself with only (Mervyn) Day to beat and Leeds screaming for offside. The trusty left foot of the Londoner lobbed goalwards, Day was stranded, and Pearce had scored his first goal in 26 months to give Albion another three valuable points.”\n\nNot such a memorable game came in a 3-0 defeat away to Norwich City on 5 April 1986. The full-back went into the referee’s notebook for a foul on future Albion winger Mark Barham, who was substituted shortly afterwards. Albion had a great chance to pull a goal back when Pearce was through one-on-one with Chris Woods, but the England ‘keeper saved his effort comfortably. Then, eight minutes from time, Pearce fouled Wayne Biggins in the penalty area and Welsh international David Williams buried City’s third from the penalty spot.\n\nPearce played in Albion’s final game of the season, a 2-0 defeat at Hull City under George Petchey, following Cattlin’s sacking, and it turned out to be his last match in a Brighton shirt.\n\nThe returning Alan Mullery explained in his programme notes for the opening game of the new season that he released Jacobs and Pearce because “I felt we had too many defenders”.\n\nPearce switched to Third Division Gillingham under Keith Peacock and played a total of 48 matches as the Gills narrowly missed out on promotion when losing a play-off final replay against Lou Macari’s Swindon Town in 1987.\n\nFollowing a disappointing second season with the Gills, when they finished mid-table, Pearce returned to hometown club Brentford where he played 14 times (+ 8 as sub) in Steve Perryman’s 1988-89 side. One of his teammates was fellow former Albion cup star Smillie.\n\nPearce joined up with Peacock again for Maidstone United’s debut season (1989-90) in the Fourth Division, which culminated in a play-off semi-final defeat at the hands of a Cambridge United side featuring Dion Dublin up front.\n\nThe following season, under Phil Holder, Pearce was back at Brentford as first team and reserve coach. He subsequently had spells as player-manager with Isthmian League clubs Enfield and Molesey. He later became a PE teacher at Homefield Preparatory School in Sutton.\n\nBorn in Hammersmith on 8 July 1959, Pearce was one of seven children (five boys, two girls) and attended Grove Park Primary School, where he was captain of their under-9 football side. He went on to play for the Middlesex County side and Middlesex Wanderers before his stop-start professional career began.\n\n• Pictures from my scrapbook and matchday programmes.\n\nSHANE DUFFY has seized the opportunity to re-establish himself at the heart of Brighton’s defence to the obvious delight of the manager who appeared to have shunned him.\n\nWith injury sidelining Dan Burn and Covid-19 isolation protocol ruling out Joel Veltman, Duffy stepped up with a solid performance in the season-opener at Burnley, and a goalscoring return to the Amex in the 2-0 win over Watford.\n\n“It was a fantastic header from Duffy, he’s a monster in the box,” boss Graham Potter told the BBC after the televised Watford match. “He is so big and strong to stop – it was a great goal.”\n\nDuffy’s form has been a reminder of the solid centre-back partnership he formed with Lewis Dunk as the bedrock of Brighton’s promotion from the Championship in 2017.\n\nAlthough a metatarsal injury in a 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest meant he missed out on the run-in, Duffy was obviously confident of being restored to the line-up when the Premier League season got under way.\n\n“I’m looking forward to going back to Everton to see a few mates but they’re all going to be big games,” Duffy said in a matchday programme article. “I feel more ready for it than I was four or five years ago at Everton, and I deserve another crack at it, but I know I’ve got to work hard.”\n\nWhile additions to the squad were to be expected as the Albion sought to stay among exalted company, the Duffy-Dunk pairing at the back didn’t look much like being broken up. Certainly not under Chris Hughton.\n\nHappy with his mainstays at the heart of the defence, Hughton allowed Connor Goldson to leave for Glasgow Rangers and Uwe Hünemeier to return to Germany and Duffy was comfortable alongside Dunk as Albion retained their top division status. And so it remained for Albion’s two first two seasons back amongst the elite.\n\nBut when Potter replaced the popular Hughton in 2019, it soon became apparent Duffy didn’t fit the mould of the sort of ball-playing centre-back he wanted in the side.\n\nAlthough he started the season under Potter, his place was gradually taken over by big money signing Adam Webster. Duffy invariably ended up warming the bench and at the start of the 2020-21 season, with Ben White preferred alongside Dunk and Webster, he jumped at the chance to go on loan to Glasgow giants Celtic, the team he’d supported as a boy.\n\nUnfortunately, it didn’t turn out to be quite the dream move Duffy had hoped for, with criticism arrowing in from all quarters as the Republic of Ireland international underwhelmed in the centre of the Hoops defence, and Celtic could only watch as city rivals Rangers won the Scottish title.\n\nDoubtless the irony wasn’t lost on Duffy that his first match back in a Seagulls shirt saw him up against Rangers in a pre-season friendly, when the home fans ensured he was given a ‘warm’ reception.\n\nBut let’s go back to where it all started.\n\nBorn in Derry, Northern Ireland, on 1 January 1992, Duffy was playing for Northern Ireland Under-16s against England in the Victory Shield when he caught the eye of watching Everton boss David Moyes.\n\nDuffy had been playing for his local side, Foyle Harps, at the time and, although Arsenal took him on trial and offered him a scholarship, Everton invited him to train with them and offered him a professional contract immediately.\n\n“Of the two clubs, I just had a good feeling about Everton; obviously it was more of a family club, and there’s also the Irish connection with the city of Liverpool, so it was easy for me to settle in,” Duffy told the matchday programme.\n\nIn his second season at Goodison Park, he made his first team debut aged just 17 in a Europa League match against AEK Athens.\n\n“David Moyes handed me my debut and I owe him a lot because he always had belief in me, whereas I could have gone somewhere else and maybe ended up back in Ireland,” he said. “I was raw as I hadn’t been with an academy before, but he was patient with me, as were all the coaches, and I came through the youth team and reserves before I got my break in the Europa League and then later in the Premier League.”\n\nDuffy played against Brighton when the third-tier club’s youngsters (with Dunk in defence) acquitted themselves brilliantly in the fourth round of the FA Youth Cup against Everton at the Withdean on 21 January 2010 before eventually losing 2-0. The programme pen picture said of him: “Strong in the tackle and dependable in the air, Shane is considered a ball-playing defender.”\n\nDuffy recalled: “I’d just turned 18 and had recently broken into the Everton team in the Europa League. I do remember Dunky a little bit because we were marking each other at corners.”\n\nA month after his visit to Withdean, Duffy decided to switch allegiance to the Republic having previously captained Northern Ireland’s Under-19s. It came just as he was selected for the full international squad to face Albania in a friendly in Tirana where he was expected to receive his first cap in the absence of captain Aaron Hughes (who later spent a season with Brighton) and Chris Baird.\n\nDisappointed Northern Ireland boss Nigel Worthington told The Guardian: “There is a loophole where a player can walk away after a lot of time and investment has gone in. Until it is resolved, that’s where we are. Shane has represented Northern Ireland all the way through from a very early age to the Under-21s.\n\n“I am a big admirer of Shane. I like him as a player and a lot of work has"
