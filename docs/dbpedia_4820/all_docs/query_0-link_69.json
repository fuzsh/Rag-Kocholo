        "text": "Predominantly focusing 'Cotes's managerial career, we talked about managing on a shoestring budget, bust-ups with opposition managers and the highs and lows of non league football. Thank you for supporting and listening to the Non-League Lounge over the past 18 months. We can't promise we'll be back, but we'll try. Setting up this channel has allowed us to meet extraordinary guests, learn new skills, educate listeners on non-league football and, above all, have a laugh.\n\nThere is no better way to finish this podcast series than chat with the ex-Altrincham legend and manager, Graham Heathcote. In the first episode of two, Graham gave Tom the low down of his playing career in football, a few exclusive stories to the podcast, a number of his footballing regrets and so much more.\n\nSilkRadio Broadcaster and former non-league manager Mike Wain talked about his time covering the lower leagues as both an insider and an outsider. He gave young budding coaches, managers and presenters tips to break into the world of non-league and league football.\n\nLong-time former Curzon Ashton gaffer John Flanagan gave a no-holds-barred interview in the studio, talking earnestly about the highs and lows of his stint in charge of 'the Nash'. Flanagan also discussed his playing career and his time as manager of Winsford Town.\n\nAfter an extensive career in non-league, bagging over 300 goals in the process, Mike Lennon had a whole host of stories to keep us entertained. We talked about the highs and lows of football, as well as whether he regretted not playing at a higher level during his career. Another must listen!\n\nLiam Watson, Southport's current and most successful manager, was in the studio to discuss his career in non-league football. We talked about his managerial ups and downs, how the pandemic affected the lower leagues, and his future as a manager.\n\nWe're back in the studio after six long months! Next up: Farsley boss Adam Lakeland. Although he never made it into professional football, Lakeland has been a coach for over 20 years. During this time he has coached Curzon Ashton and managed Northwich Victoria and Farsley Celtic.\n\nFormer TNS manager - as well as Newton, Chester, and TNS player - was on the podcast to talk about his passion for non-league and his European experiences as a player.\n\nThe current Gloucester City manager - and former Grimsby Town legend and football league veteran - was interviewed by Tom and Andy for this week's episode. We discussed his opinions on the termination of the National League North back in February, his managerial aspirations and the future for Gloucester City.\n\nFormer Chelsea, Southampton, Luton Town player and now Hayes and Yeading manager spoke to Tom about his career in both the league and non-league. He's broken club records at Hayes and intends to bring the club back to 'where they belong' - in the conference.\n\nLee Attenborough, the current manager of Loughborough Dynamo's, spoke candidly about his career as a player and manager in non-league football. While playing in step four for a fair few years, we mainly discussed his career as a manager in the lower leagues.\n\nTuffs is one of the most exciting young managers in non-league football. He's set club records at Hartley Witney, turned fortunes around at Knaphill FC, and is now the current gaffer at Asford Town. And as the first, and only, openly gay manager in football we talked about the prejudice, and support, he has encountered.\n\nSince starting management at the mere age of 21, Danny has picked up 12 trophies in 14 years, including the prestigious FA Vase with Thatcham Town in 2018. In his short career he's gone from strength to strength, and is one of the most exciting young prospects in non-league.\n\nAfter playing for Tottenham Hotspur, Cardiff City, Hayes and Havant and Waterlooville, Gray's playing career was curtailed by injury. At a young age he then became assistant manager for Crawley and Aldershot, before taking the reins at Sutton United in 2019. Now a hot managerial prospect with a team very much on the up, we caught up with the U's gaffer to talk about his team's chances of reaching the play-offs.\n\nWarning: this is an interview with the Harrow borough manager, NOT the right honourable member for Wycombe. We focused on what it's like to be a manager at non-league level, the struggles involved in lower league management, and the antics Steve got up to in a past life as a former player himself.\n\nBefore taking over the reins at Boston United in 2017, Elliott managed Shaw Lane, Ossett Town, Pontefract Collieries and Kellingley Welfare. With an abundance of experience in non-league, Craig had many interesting stories to tell.\n\nAs football fans know all too well, every league in England was suspended in March 2020 due to outbreak of coronavirus. With Tom to discuss some of the problems that smaller non-league clubs have faced in the past year was the Wimborne club secretary, Wayne Jones; their Chairman, Tony Grant; and the Magpies' manager, James Stokoe.\n\nCo-host of the Non League Football Show, and former Enfield, AFC Wimbledon, Harrow Borough manager, Dave Anderson, was interviewed by Andy and Tom on Zoom. With over three decades of non-league management, Dave had an abundance of fascinating stories.\n\nDespite being south of 40, our next guest has a wealth of experience within non-league football - both as a player and a coach. He's managed Wealdstone Town, Hemel Hempstead, Billericay Town and Kingstonian. As a player he's played for a whole host of clubs - with notable mentions coming from Halesowen, AFC Wimbledon, Stevenage Borough and Hitchin Town. Another really insightful listen from a player that really knows the non-league game.\n\nSince 2004, Perry has played for a whole host of clubs, most of them residing in non-league. In this Christmas bumper issue, Perry shared the highs and lows of his career, as well as a few funny stories at the end. Merry Christmas, and enjoy!\n\nHaving amassed 82 points by March 2020, won 27 out of a possible 31 league games, and recorded 20 consecutive away victories, Vauxhall Motors were denied promotion in March 2020, after the FA null and voided all leagues below step two in non-league. Mick McGraa came on the Non-League Lounge to vent his frustrations, as well as discuss his time at The Motors and his former playing career.\n\nSpennymoor centre-back and former Blyth, Gateshead and Hartlepool man was interviewed by Tom and Andy. We also designated a 'social media' section to this podcast, where we read out comments and gags directed at our guest from the North East. An interesting and humorous listen from a player who has an impressive number of FA Cup scalps and league trophies under his belt.\n\nLockdown 2.0 shut us out of the studio. But instead of stopping us in our tracks, we decided to hop on the broadband and venture down south. Nathan Ashmore was a towering figure on the podcast as well as a colossus in the box. He had plenty of stories for you from his time at Havant and Waterlooville, Gosport Borough, Ebbsfleet and Boreham Wood.\n\nFormer Leigh RMI, Witton, Leek, Nantwich left-back and now Pilkington manager was our guest this week. We spoke about the mental health crisis in football and the difficulty for footballers to find a level they are satisfied with in non-league. A few corking stories were thrown in for good measure too!\n\nFormer Macclesfield, Northwich, Accrington and Altrincham Centre-Back talked to us about his playing career in non-league football. Great stories of holidays but also the misery of playing at clubs in financial ruin. Another funny and interesting episode.\n\nFormer non-league Referee Alex Kirkley was in the studio to discuss his experience as an officiator of the lower leagues. We discussed abuse, big games and much more. A few stories that weren't necessarily non-league related were added in for good measure too. Enjoy!\n\nAtherton Colls Manager Brad Cooke was in the studio talking about his career in non-league and the future for his management career. He's played under iconic management such as Bernard and Jono, Michael Clegg and Steve Wilkes.\n\nIn the first of this new two-parter we welcomed Northwich Victoria manager Steve Wilkes. In the first episode we discussed Steve's playing career at Wigan Athletic, Preston North End, EVV Eindhoven, Southport, Morecambe, Bamber Bridge and Darwen. From bust-ups with Sam Allardyce to being hung on coat hangers, it's a corker of an episode!\n\nAfter two promotions in three seasons, the Robins are clearly getting something right behind the scenes. Tom had a chat with Neil Sorvel, Altrincham Assistant Manager, on how himself and Phil Parkinson have achieved this success. We also discussed Neil's former playing career in both league and non-league football.\n\nIn February FC Isle Of Man had their proposal accepted to join the North West Counties League. They will join fellow islanders Guernsey and Jersey in the non-league pyramid. To talk about this seismic moment for non-league football we welcomed the teams director, Paul Jones, and the clubs gaffer, Chris Bass.\n\nThis week we entertained Matlcok Town manager Paul Phillips. Philo is a non-league legend, who after having played for Droylsden, Stalybridge Celtic and Marine, he then went on to manage Ashton United and Buxton. In January 2020, however, he took over the reins at Matlock Town.\n\nWe've interviewed another goalkeeper! And yes, Craig Dootson was on fine form. The non-league veteran discussed his past life as a goalkeeper for several iconic non-league teams including Stalybridge Celtic, Hyde, Leigh RMI and Kendal Town. It's a right laugh this one!\n\nIn our 18th episode we welcomed former Barrow, Gateshead and Altrincham goalkeeper, Tim Deasy. Deasy gave an honest compendium of his past life as a shot-stopper in non-league football. The interview had everything; it was emotional, thoughtful and funny. So sit back and enjoy!\n\nTom and Andy have interviewed players, managers, fans, and a chairman. But until this week, we had never interviewed a commentator. It was therefore an honour to welcome Brian Flynn- Altrincham FC's Media and Press Officer- into the studio to discuss his experience of following non-league football. Brian has over five decades' worth of memories, both from the gantry and the terraces- which ranged from the introspective to the inane!\n\nAfter three torturous months, we are finally back in the studio. First up was Ashton United Manager, Micheal Clegg. The former Atherton Collieries and now Ashton United manager has, to date, enjoyed an illustrious career in management. At Coles, he won three promotions in five seasons. Moreover, after he was pinched by Ashton in 2019, 'The Robins' have seen a revival in form. The man himself gave us in-depth and insightful analysis into what it's like to be a manager in non-league football.\n\nHaving achieved the ninth largest attendance in non-league football this season, with an equally reputable atmosphere to go with it, Dulwich Hamlet have become a club difficult to ignore. Inquisitive on how they were put on this pedestal, we wanted to hear from a fan who had witnessed their journey. Ben, the clubs social media guru, gave us his account from behind the scenes. This included FA Cup drama, away day nonsense and an unforgettable trip to 'Coach House Decadence'.\n\nIn our 14th episode, we welcomed three lads from County Durham. After having entertained three blokes from the North East, some could compare the nature of this episode to Geordie Shore. One disclaimer, however, is that our guests were far less attractive in comparison to those on the reality television programme. Manuel, Chris and Gary- who are co-commentators for the Mariners- have witnessed the unassailable rise of Shields over the past few years. Success on the field reflects the ascent of club off the field. From nights out with the boys, abuse in the stands and unforgettable Wembley wins. But, in the midst of the banter, there is one certainty: this is not an episode to be missed!\n\nIn this weeks episode we talk to the most plastic 'northerner' we have ever met: Kyle Milne Cameron. Having been exiled from Newcastle (his homeland) at the start of his career, Cameron subsequently made the long and laborious march down to sunny Torquay. Having recently signed a contract extension in what are uncertain times for many, Cameron gave his views on how the Devonshire club can progress and how non-league can get itself out of this quagmire.\n\nSutton United and Barrow. Greater London and Cumbria. North and South. Chalk and Cheese. Few things seemingly bind these two clubs. Both teams, however, have enjoyed successes on shoestring budgets within the last few years. We picked a fan from each club to talk about their best days following their club and the miracles that are being worked at their respective teams.\n\nTake a deep breath- this is quite a mouthful. Jennings previously played for Macclesfield Town, Altrincham, Kettering, Cambridge United, Forest Green, Mansfield, Cheltenham and Morecambe. But now he's a fans favourite at Wrexham, where he is extremely content. Amongst other things the non-league veteran told us about his big FA Cup game at Stamford Bridge, how he deals with abuse from fans and what he loves about lower-league footy!\n\nBroughton was a piece of work. But my god did he have some stories for you! This Salford City legend reflected on his time supporting his local club; from drinking sessions with the players, stag do's with Ricky Hatton and his overall vision for the City."
