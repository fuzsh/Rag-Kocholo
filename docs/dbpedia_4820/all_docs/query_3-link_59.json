        "text": "Where will the interview be published?\n\nThanks - Backpass magazine - www.backpassmagazine.co.uk\n\nI remember GT as a very, very good keeper for one so young. We were all sickened by the injury -- he would have had a great career without it.\n\nNot sure it's interview material but I remember going to see him in the now defunct Hither Green hospital, I think a few days after it happened at Sunderland. I was 9 at the time and I think I made him a card! I might just've been a bit young to make a balanced judgement but felt sure he'd play for England! All the best Graham; a horrendous fate for any young athlete.\n\nEven though still a teenager he was a physically imposing keeper and particularly decent with crosses from what I remember.\n\nI can't remember any real weaknesses and definitely a very sad tale of a largely unfulfilled talent.\n\nTom Finney has a lot to answer for.\n\nAsk him if he still goes to Aunt Charlies pub in Atlanta? I met him in there once in 1990 as he was mates with my Charlton supporting friend who also lived there.\n\nDid he/the players feel Finney did it deliberately ?\n\nI remember watching MOTD as a 14 year old & I was convinced that he did.\n\nDisgraceful. Should have received a very lengthy ban.\n\nRemember his home debut well, 3-0 v. Oldham, and thinking what a great prospect he was. Finney's was a terrible foul and we didn't even get a free kick let alone any punishment for him. I also remember reading somewhere that Millwall didn't sign Graham as a youngster as they thought he was too tall! Is that true?\n\nAlso, in the promotion game against Preston in '75, after Bob Curtis missed a penalty and they went ahead 0-1, did Mr. Nelson have some words to say at half time?"
