        "text": "Hartlepool United are set to complete a deal to sign Oldham Athletic midfielder Nathan Sheron, becoming Darren Sarll’s third signing of the summer so far.\n\nThe 26-year-old is currently under contract at Oldham Athletic heading into the 2024/25 campaign, but as seen with Mark Shelton’s switch to Barnet, this doesn’t mean he will be sticking around but there has been no confirmation as to whether it’s an undisclosed fee or he’s been let go on a free transfer.\n\nHartlepool have already confirmed the arrivals of Jack Hunter from Halifax Town and Luke Charman from AFC Fylde, with Sheron now set to be the second midfielder to sign for the club ahead of the new season.\n\nHow did Sheron fair last season?\n\nSheron was a regular first-team player for Oldham Athletic last season, making 44 appearances in the National League alone, scoring six goals and providing an additional assist.\n\nThe midfielder started 38 of the 44 league matches, averaging a passing success rate of 78% as well as 4.2 interceptions and nine ball recoveries per 90 minutes over the course of the campaign.\n\nFurther experience added to the Hartlepool midfield\n\nFollowing a busy post-season which saw several players including Josh Umerah and Tom Crawford leave the club after their contracts came to an end, Darren Sarll’s side have begun their summer recruitment.\n\nLuke Charman joins the attack, hoping to add goals to the Pools side. Meanwhile, Jack Hunter helped to secure Halifax Town’s play-off place last season and will be looking to kick on again in his new home.\n\nAccording to the Oldham Times, Nathan Sheron is expected to sign for Darren Sarll’s side to add additional experience into the football club ahead of the new season.\n\nWith Hartlepool losing several midfielders already this summer, the arrival of Sheron will add further depth and experience into the football club ahead of the 2024/25 campaign."
