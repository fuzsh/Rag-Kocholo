        "text": "Ambrose Fogarty was an Irish international and ex Sunderland hero who, when he was signed by Hartlepools United as it was then in 1963, was by far the most expensive and high profile player the team had ever had. He cost £10,000.\n\nHe made 138 appearances and was awarded a testimonial on March 2nd 1967. Hartlepools, including manager Brian Clough, played Charlie Hurley's 11. Hurley was another Sunderland and Irish international.\n\nThe Pools side won 6-3 and the scorers were Jimmy Mulvaney, Terry Bell, John Sheridan, Joe Livingstone(2) and Fogarty himself. There was a crowd of over 7000 and also a dance in his honour.\n\nOn the photo taken at the time are L-R Tony Parry, Brian Drysdale, Stan Aston, manager Brian Clough, Joe Livingstone, Brian Grant, Tony Bircumshaw, John Sheridan, Amby Fogarty, director Bert Young, Ken Simpkins, Ernie Phythian and Jimmy Mulvaney.\n\nWhen he retired, Fogarty managed a number of Irish teams and he died in January 2016 aged 82.\n\nMore detail »\n\nOn January 8th 1955, Pools played local rivals Darlington in the FA Cup 3rd round. There was a crowd of 12,450 and increased prices meant it cost 2 shillings and sixpence admission.\n\nThe game ended at 1 all and there was a replay at Feethams where a two all draw meant a second replay at Ayresome Park Middlesbrough's ground. Pools won 2 nil on a snowbound pitch and on January 29th, 17,200 fans packed the Vic as Pools faced Nottingham Forest in the 4th round. This was a further draw and forced a replay at City Ground Nottingham where Pools just lost in the dying minutes. Had they won, they would have had a further derby with Newcastle in the 5th round.\n\nMore detail »\n\nSince Victoria Park (Ground) had opened, there had been an open terrace on the Mill House side of the ground or 'tips' side.\n\nFinally in 1969, work began on the Mill House Stand which was to cost £40,000 and would seat 1800. The plans were for dressing rooms, offices and bars underneath but it was unclear when this was to happen.\n\nToday the Mill House Stand is much as it was built and rather strangely does not run the full length of the pitch. Although there is a bar and food outlet under it, the other plans never came to fruition.\n\nMore detail »\n\nKenny Johnson – Local hero; played in the famous home F.A. Cup tie against Manchester United in January 1957 – Hartlepool lost a very close game 4-3. In later life Kenny and his wife ran a Fish ‘n Chip shop on the Fens.\n\n? Can’t remember this Irish lad’s name, but he was one of Brian Clough’s early signings, coming from Nottingham Forest.\n\nKenny Simpkins – Welshman – Great lad. Played Goalkeeper and at times as a Centre Forward and was good in both positions. Lives on the Headland and still attends Pools’ games.\n\nAlan Fox – Another Welshman, signed from Wrexham. Played a lot of league games for the Pool’s and was a very good Centre Half, popular with the supporters. Still lives in the town.\n\nBrian Cooper – Local lad and a very competitive full-back. Still lives in the town and runs a building and plumbing business with his sons.\n\nWinston Roberts – Another local lad and a great midfield player – a real wizard with the ball. Played lots of local league football, with teams such as the Boys Welfare and Lion Social.\n\nTommy Johnson – A Pool’s legend, who spent many years at the Club, and who was also a Physio at Middlesbrough. Tommy encouraged many a young player to realise their full potential.\n\nAlan Melville – A very imposing and competitive player who also spent some time with St. Joseph’s F.C. Still lives in Hartlepool working as a carpet fitter.\n\nJohn McGovern – A legend in the world of football, winning two European Cup medals with Nottingham Forest. Still lives in the town.\n\nHugh Hamilton – Played many games for the Pools’, and later Stockton F.C. and Lion Social. Still lives in the town with his wife and family.\n\nPeter Thompson – A great Centre Forward, who also spent time with Bournemouth. Peter now works as a Youth Leader in Owton Manor, and is a great inspiration to young people.\n\nColin Temple – “Temps”, local lad and a good player for the Pools’. Also spent time at a number of Northern League clubs. Still lives in the town.\n\nAndy McCluskey, October, 2012.\n\nMore detail »\n\nTaken at Victoria Park, then called Victoria Ground, in 1961 when Hartlepool Reserves were playing York Reserves. The photo is taken from the 'Town End' goal looking towards the Rink End. On the right is the old wooden stand which at the time and until the 1980s, was the only seated part of the ground.\n\nThe pointed roof in the background was Clock Garage and became incorporated into the ground. It is now the main office block.\n\nFloodlights did not come to Victoria Ground until 1967.\n\nMore detail »\n\nThanks to the attached recollection of Jim Brownlee, this image is of the 1953 – England Schools Shield clash on Victoria Ground in February, they had accounted for Stoke Boys in the previous round and faced Chesterfield in the next.\n\nA goal from Greenwood on 12 minutes sealed the West Boys win against Manchester Boys, , and their side on the day was\n\nField; Beavs, Norris; Eyre, Dixon, Deathers; Greenwood, Musgrave, MacGregor, Clyburn.\n\nNorris was from Elwick Road School, Eyre (Sacred Heart) Deathers (St Bega's), all the rest were from TDS in Lauder Street.\n\n(Source CMcL)\n\nAccording to Mr Jim Brownlee, the match was played at Victoria Park with over 14.000 attending.\n\nHe recalls players such as brothers Terry and Peter Mcgregor, King who played in goal, Deathers a half back and Clyburn the outside left. Many of the side were from what was then the Technical Day School.\n\nHe goes on to say the Terry and Peter's father Jim Mcgregor was instrumental in setting up the local Sunday League once Sunday football was sanctioned by the FA.\n\nJim Brownlee was a former pupil of the rugby playing Grammar School who enjoyed many years in the Sunday League for Teesmouth and West Rugby.\n\nMore detail »"
