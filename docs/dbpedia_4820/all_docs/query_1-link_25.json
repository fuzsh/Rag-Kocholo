        "text": "Chelsea vs. Everton : 15 April 2024.\n\nAfter the game at Bramall Lane on Sunday 7 April, I was again treated to a two-game football weekend. But this was no Saturday and Sunday double-header. No, nothing as easy as that. With modern football being modern football, this was one that featured matches on a Friday and a Monday.\n\nThe reward for working my first five-day week for a month – what a slog – was a Friday evening at Frome Town with a game against Bishops Cleeve, a team from near Cheltenham in Gloucestershire. After the dropped points at Exmouth Town the previous Saturday, this was a match that my local team just had to win. Thankfully, a Sam Meakes goal mid-way through the first half gave the home team a slender 1-0 win. However, it was a tough match, despite the visitors having a player sent off just before half-time. In the second half, the visitors enjoyed much of the possession, and everyone became more and more nervous with each passing minute. Thankfully, Frome’s defence were resolute and kept attacks at bay. The Frome ‘keeper Kyle Phillips, in fact, did not have too much to do. Frome, defending deeper than we thought necessary, took all three points, which kept the team at the top of the Southern League South. The attendance was a very pleasing 690, which took the home average up to 483 for the season. Frome have just three games left; if we win them all, we will be automatically promoted.\n\nSaturday and Sunday came and went, but with some pretty hilarious football results along the way.\n\nNewcastle United 4 Tottenham Hotspur 0.\n\nLiverpool 0 Crystal Palace 1.\n\nWest Ham 0 Fulham 2.\n\nArsenal 0 Aston Villa 2.\n\nI worked another early shift on the Monday. At 2pm, I set off from Melksham in Wiltshire with PD and LP. There was a little chat about the evening’s game with Everton, who last won a league game at Stamford Bridge almost thirty years ago. Did I expect us to win against the SW6-shy Toffees?\n\nYes. There I said it.\n\nI dropped the lads off near “McGettigans” on Fulham Broadway at 4.30pm so they could enjoy a quiet drink with Salisbury Steve. My pre-match was spent at Stamford Bridge where I took a few photographs of the pre-match scene. Overhead, there was a clear blue sky, but despite the Spring sun, it was bitter. In fact, it was so cold, thanks to a raw wind, that I had to disappear inside the megastore for twenty minutes to keep warm. It’s a place that I hardly ever visit these days. I am still trying to get over the sight of a bloke, probably in his early thirties, with a small Chelsea crest painted on his face. Outside under old The Shed wall, I bumped into a few friends before I finally made my way inside the ground at 7.30pm.\n\nAs I walked up the steps to the MHU and made my way to my seat, I was serenaded – appropriately enough – by “Blue Monday” by New Order.\n\nPerfect.\n\nI wondered if there might be a Chelsea-themed sequence of songs, but no. However, the next three songs were decent enough.\n\n“Going Underground” by The Jam.\n\n“Echo Beach” by Martha And The Muffins.\n\n“Call Me” by Blondie.\n\nAh, four favourites. Four classics. The person choosing the set list certainly knew his target audience; it always seems that the match-goers around me in The Sleepy Hollow are children of the ’eighties, in thoughts, words and deeds.\n\nThen, “Money For Nothing” by Dire Straits.\n\nUgh. Oh well, four out of five ain’t bad.\n\nIt was still light as the kick-off approached. The lightshow and the flickering flames did not have quite the same impact in the evening dusk.\n\nThe teams appeared.\n\nUs?\n\nPetrovic\n\nGusto – Silva – Chalobah – Cucarella\n\nGallagher – Caicedo\n\nMadueke – Palmer – Mudryk\n\nJackson\n\nThem?\n\nA smattering of familiar names, a few young ones, and two old ones; Seamus Coleman, aged thirty-five, and Ashley Young, aged thirty-eight. Young always looks like he has his legs on incorrectly.\n\nJust before kick-off, Tommie Senior and Tommie Junior – from Riverside in California and last spotted at Sheffield United – appeared twenty-yards away in seats to my left. It would be their first match at Stamford Bridge; I had managed to get them tickets via a mate. They looked ridiculously excited. Alan and Clive sat alongside PD and little old me, the first time that all four of us had been present at Chelsea for a while.\n\nThe game began at 8pm. I wasn’t keen that we were attacking the Matthew Harding in the first-half.\n\nEverton, dressed in an all pink ensemble that reminded me of Daytona Beach in the late ‘eighties, began quite brightly. In front of the three thousand away fans, a cross came in from the Everton right – that man Coleman – but Beto thankfully stabbed his shot over the bar.\n\nOn thirteen minutes, a magnificent Chelsea move was played out in front of us. Cole Palmer received the ball forty yards out, nut-megged one of the young Evertonians – Jarrad Branthwaite – and adeptly back heeled a pass to Nicolas Jackson who quickly returned the ball to Palmer. I felt myself relax. Palmer’s body language reeked of self-belief and as he coolly and calmly slotted the ball towards the far post with a delicate flick of his left-foot wand, it seemed churlish for me to be worried about the outcome. The goal quickly came.\n\nChelsea 1 Everton 0.\n\nPalmer again, ole, ole.\n\nIt was almost too easy.\n\nAlan : THTCAUN.\n\nChris : COMLD.\n\nJust after, Noni Madueke, who had begun positively, drilled a ball in from the wing. From our position high above the corner flag it appeared that the forward movement of Palmer had hindered the path of the ball into the net. Palmer looked momentarily deflated.\n\nOn eighteen minutes, we attacked again. Moises Caicedo to Mykhailo Mudryk and a burst down below us, and a pass to Jackson. The young striker’s shot was parried by Jordan Pickford, who used to be a goalkeeper. The ball sat up nicely for Palmer to nod emphatically home from just inside the six-yard box.\n\nChelsea 2 Everton 0.\n\nPalmer again, ole, ole.\n\nAlan had noted that his two goals had been scored by his left peg and his head, and so was already thinking ahead about a perfect hat-trick.\n\nIt was an open game. Chances were shared. Mudryk raced back well to hack away a goal bound effort off the line at the Shed End. Jackson, not shy to come forward, fired a blooter just over the bar.\n\nOn twenty-nine minutes, a terrible pass out of defence by Pickford was pounced on by Palmer of all people. He instantaneously accessed the situation. His GPS was spot on, as he quickly lifted the ball high over Pickford’s gurning face, and the flight of the ball immediately impressed me.\n\n…thinking : ”this looks in.”\n\nYep, the ball dropped into the empty net.\n\nA roar from the Chelsea crowd.\n\nChelsea 3 Everton 0.\n\nPalmer again, ole, ole.\n\nI looked over towards the Two Tommies; oh boy, they were loving it.\n\nAlan : “was that his right foot?”\n\nChris : “yep.”\n\nAlan : “Perfect.”\n\nStamford Bridge had taken a while to make some worthwhile noise, but now the place was rocking to one or two “Carefrees.”\n\nWe thought that the visitors had pulled a goal back but I quickly spotted a raised flag for offside.\n\nPhew.\n\nTo their credit, Everton kept attacking, but they looked awfully exposed when we got on the front foot. On forty-four minutes, Marc Cucarella – most definitely an improved player from last season – sent over a cross towards the near post. Jackson brought the ball down with a really exquisite move, and swivelled smoothly before slotting the ball home. This was another beautiful goal. What a performance.\n\nChelsea 4 Everton 0.\n\nAt half-time, all was well in the world. I joked with the lads that I had not taken too many photographs of the game thus far, but 90% of them had been of goal celebrations. The actual breakdown was as follows :\n\nTotal photos : 58\n\nGoal celebrations : 28\n\nSo, the actual percentage was 48% but never let the truth ruin a good line. In truth, we hadn’t exactly peppered the Everton goal with shots, but we found ourselves four goals to the good. In a season – or more – when we have bemoaned our lack of quality in front of goal, it was lovely to see our goals to shots ratio increase, if only for one game.\n\nBaby steps and all that.\n\nThe second-half began and I was dreaming of a cricket score. I am sure that I was not alone. The new Chelsea midfield of Caicedo and Gallagher was performing well, allowing others to move forward to exploit the tiring Everton defence. We kept to the same script and were rewarded in the sixty-fourth minute when Madueke tumbled after a crude challenge by James Tarkowski. The referee quickly pointed to the spot.\n\nThe madness that then ensued caused unnecessary tensions in the stadium, both on the pitch and off it. While Palmer, who had fallen just before the foul on Madueke, gathered himself, there seemed to be a feisty altercation on the penalty spot between Madueke, Jackson, Silva and Gallagher. In everyone’s mind, Palmer was the obvious – and only – choice for the penalty. Madueke and Jackson seemed to have other opinions. Silva and Gallagher wrested the ball away from Madueke, who flounced off in a pathetic strop.\n\nPalmer placed the ball on the spot.\n\nPalmer scored.\n\nChelsea 5 Everton 0.\n\nPalmer again, ole, ole.\n\nAlan asked me to name the last occasion that we were 5-0 up at home in the league. I could only think of that magnificent game – better than this one – in November 2016 when we beat Everton 5-0.\n\n(The correct answer was Norwich City in 2021 when we went in to win 7-0.)\n\nMauricio Pochettino made some changes.\n\nCarney Chukwuemeka for Madueke.\n\nMadueke had played well, but had blotted his copybook with his stupid tantrum on the penalty spot. I expected a few boos, but there were hardly any.\n\nThe Everton fans, wh had sreadfastly resisted the desire to return to Merseyside began to leave en masse.\n\nMore changes came.\n\nCesare Casadie for Palmer.\n\nWhat a player this young lad is. Twenty goals for our number twenty this season, level with a certain Manchester City totem. The applause for Palmer was loud and sustained.\n\nBen Chilwell for Mudryk.\n\nNot Mudryk’s best game, not his worst, he was applauded too.\n\nThiago Silva was serenaded on many occasions during the game, especially with him defending down below us in the second-half. I am sure that everyone wants to let him know how much he is loved in these last few weeks of his Chelsea career.\n\nTwo more late changes.\n\nAlfie Gilchrist for Gusto.\n\nAnother decent outing for young Gusto, who was warmly applauded.\n\nDeivid Washington for Jackson.\n\nJackson is getting there, there are improvements taking place, and he was applauded too.\n\nIn the ninetieth minute, a cross from the left by Chilwell eventually fell to Alfie Gilchrist. The youngster took aim and fired a strong shot past the hapless Pickford and a huge roar enveloped the stadium. It was, of course, his first goal in the first team. The scorer raced towards the corner flag and seemed to be accelerating as he ran on. I thought he was going to keep on running onto the West Stand forecourt and down the Fulham Road before eventually stopping at “Chubby’s Grill” or whatever it is called these days for a hot dog and onions.\n\nFackinell.\n\nThe joy in Alfie’s celebrations warmed us all up on a very fine night at a cold – Cole Palmer cold – Stamford Bridge.\n\nWhisper it, but our team is slowly coming together. Those glimpses of quality are becoming more frequent. In our last two home games in the league we have scored ten goals. We have a difficult run of games to finish this season, but let’s see how high we can get.\n\nNext up we meet Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley, bloody Wembley.\n\nSee you there.\n\nEverton vs. Chelsea : 10 December 2023.\n\nDespite the feeling of desolation after that terrible performance at Old Trafford, my spirits were raised as the weekend approached. I sincerely hoped that it would be one of the nicest footballing weekends of recent memory.\n\nFirst up, on the Saturday, my nineteenth Frome Town match of the season, and the biggest game that I will have seen the team play in over fifty-three years of attending games at Badgers Hill. My local team were to play former Football League outfit Torquay United in the Third Round of the FA Trophy. I had been looking forward to this since the draw was made and I was hoping that an attendance of over 1,500 would be reached.\n\nThen, on the Sunday, my nineteenth Chelsea game of the season and a visit to my favourite away ground for the Everton game at Goodison Park. This looked likely to be my last ever visit, my twenty-third, as the home club were looking to move into their swish new riverside apartment next season. However, with both clubs in the last eight of the League Cup, there was a small chance that Chelsea could be back in the New Year for a semi-final, and an even smaller chance that we would draw Everton away in the FA Cup. However, I have been keeping tabs on the new build at Bramley Moore Dock over the past year and there have been rumours of the stadium not being ready for the start of the 2024/25 season. There has been some debate within the Evertonian ranks about moving in as soon as the stadium is ready, even if it is in the middle of the 2024/25, making use of the extra match-day income as soon as possible. The other view is to delay and move in at the start of the 2025/26 campaign, thus ensuring a grand, and planned, send off for the Grand Old Lady, as Goodison is affectionately known, rather than being unsure when the actual last game would be. I would imagine that would be a nightmare for most Evertonians; not knowing when “the last goodbye” would be.\n\nOn the Saturday, I met up with a few pals at “The Vine Tree” pub near the Frome Town ground. This pub used to be run by former Frome Town and Portsmouth player Willie “Farmer” Haines, though my father knew him as “Wyndy” Haines, in the ‘forties. He scored 119 goals in 164 games for Pompey. I mention this in passing as my school friend Richard, who met me and some other Frome mates at this pub, is currently one of two poets in residence at Fratton Park. We joked how he has come a long way from when the two of us used to contribute semi-satirical and semi-humorous pieces to a sixth-form journal forty years ago.\n\nI was buzzing as I walked up the hill to the ground. I could see that the Devon club had brought around three-hundred fans, most of whom were nestled under the roof of the side terrace. Despite an even start, the visitors went 2-0 up in the first-half. Frome Town were then awarded a penalty but Jon Davies saw his low effort saved. In the first few moments of the second-half, Alex Monks hit the post, and we then watched in horror as Torquay scored two more in quick succession. Sam Meakes pulled one back to make it 1-4 and we had a goal disallowed too. It was not to be. The gate was a healthy 1,305 but fell short of my hoped-for target. At times, the atmosphere was a little subdued. In truth, I felt a little underwhelmed. It could have been so much better. Frome failed to score in key moments and paid the price against a far fitter team. But the club are well placed, and could go top of the league very soon.\n\nOn the Sunday, I collected PD at 7am and we headed up to Merseyside. Despite the slight chances of further games at Goodison Park, this felt like my last-ever visit, and I promised myself to spend some time circumnavigating the tight streets around the famous old ground – those who mock it shamefully call it Woodison – before taking my place in the Bullens Road Upper. As I drove north, I could not stop myself from humming the “Z Cars” tune to myself.\n\nI also found myself humming the tune of a song that some Evertonian fans taught me in a cab in Manhattan a few years back, after having met them at a Yankees game.\n\n“Oh we hate Bill Shankly and we hate St. John, but most of all we hate Big Ron.\n\nAnd we’ll hang the Kopites one by one on the banks of the royal blue Mersey.\n\nTo hell with Liverpool and Rangers too, throw them all in the Mersey.\n\nAnd we’ll fight fight fight with all our might for the boys in the royal blue jersey,”\n\nWe were parked up at Stanley Park, for the last time perhaps, at around 11.30am. Thankfully, the rain had held off. We walked to the ground with our friends Michelle and Dane who were parked close by. PD went straight in, but I absolutely wanted to linger a while. I began an hour long walk around the stadium, and took – ahem – a few photos. I soon bumped into a chap who would later take his position behind the Park End goal as an official game photographer, and he took a few shots of me outside the Bullens Road. I told him of how these visits resonate for me due to the fact that my father visited Goodison Park in around 1943 while taking part in his RAF training on The Wirral. I walked over and stood under the “Welcome To Goodison” sign and I said that it felt like I was waiting for Dad to walk past.\n\nI was happy with the selection of images that I took. Again the rain held off for the most part. Walking down Goodison Road, the sun came out a lit up the sky. It fired some life into the dark brooding clouds to the north, past the Trinity Statue of Ball, Kendall and Harvey and the red brick of the church of St. Luke’s on the corner of Gwladys Street and Goodison Road.\n\nGoodison is ridiculously photogenic. I think the fact that it is so different to the old sprawling – and huge – Stamford Bridge is a reason that attracts me to it. It absolutely nestles perfectly within the tight terraced houses of Walton. It bleeds history.\n\nAh, I will miss it.\n\nThe rain came and it was time to get inside. As I walked past a bus stop on Walton Lane, I felt an immediate tinge of sadness for the couple of people who were under its roof. I felt sad for them because it meant that they weren’t going to the game. This felt like something of a “eureka” moment for me. Despite my concerns about us getting anything, even a point, from this game, I still felt the absolute need to be here, to be at Goodison, at the game, cheering on the team.\n\nI had a little moment to myself, a second of self-awareness.\n\n“Mark of a true fan, that, Chris lad” I thought to myself.\n\nI inwardly smiled.\n\nMy anticlockwise perambulation complete, I headed inside. The security check was easy, no issues with my SLR, and I was in. I asked the second person of the day – a tourist I am sure – to take a photo of me at the bottom of the old stairs leading to the cramped upper concourse. The vast majority of my games at Goodison have been watched from the upper tier. We used to have a decent record at this historic venue, but not of late. It has been a real bogey ground. The game in the latter stages of 2021/22, with Frank Lampard in charge of Everton, almost felt like it would turn out to be my last visit since the home team were in such dire straits. My camera had gone into overdrive on that day, as it had on this visit too.\n\nClick. Click. Click. Click.\n\nI joined PD, Gary and John in the front row of the upper tier. For once, a decent seat; usually we are shunted way to the left, way past the goal-line.\n\nIt dawned on me that I have watched us on three of the stadium’s four sides. In fact, I have watched us from five distinct areas.\n\nPark End terrace.\n\nPark End seats.\n\nMain Stand top balcony.\n\nBullens Road paddock.\n\nBullens Road upper.\n\nAll those memories.\n\nI waited for “Z Cars.”\n\nThe team were just finishing off their pre-match shuttles, wearing another ridiculous and busy set of training gear. At least I saw the light green shorts being worn. We have worn black too many times at away games; surely the hardest colour to pick out at pitch level.\n\nThe minutes ticked by.\n\nI thought back to my first visit, the cramped subterranean view from the Park End terrace, us in all red, me getting chased around Lime Street by some scallies. I thought back to the last visit, that dire 1-0 win, with Tuchel in charge of us and Lampard in charge of them.\n\n“I’d settle for a draw, Gal.”\n\nThe time was ready.\n\n“Z Cars.”\n\nMagnificent. Gets me every time.\n\nThe team? Definitely a 4-3-3.\n\nSanchez\n\nJames – Disasi – Badiashile – Cucarella\n\nGallagher – Caicedo – Enzo\n\nPalmer – Broja – Mudryk\n\nIt felt really odd to see us attacking our end in the first-half at Goodison. I am not so sure that I have ever seen this before. My first thoughts were centered on a potentially decent battle that might be played out between Armando Broja and the rather lanky and gangly Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite, a kid with a surname out of the nineteenth century and a first name out of the twenty-first century. In truth, after a few early runs, our centre-forward had a quiet first-half. That battle-royale never really materialised.\n\nIt says so much of our recent form that, genuinely, it seemed that we were playing more cohesively than at Old Trafford on the previous Wednesday. We were keeping the ball, and Enzo seemed to be linking things together. He was having a more influential game. I was worryingly content. But then as I watched, I realised that our chances were hardly causing Jordan Pickford – the same name discrepancy as Jarrad Branthwaite – any issues. There were two identikit shots, curling up and away, from Cole Palmer, who was also booked for taking a dive inside the Everton box. Another shot from Palmer tested Pickford but the ‘keeper saved well.\n\nMudryk, down below us in the area where Eden Hazard once toyed with Everton full-backs, was an exasperating mix of speed and indecision.\n\nThe Everton fans were ridiculously quiet, especially in the Park End to our left. There had been multi-banner displays in the Gwladys Street before the game condemning the Premier League’s decision to dock the club ten points, and I expected a feverish hotbed of support, maybe like that game in May 2022, with the fans galvanised together in defiance. What I saw, and heard, was nothing of the sort.\n\nThe entire Park End was seated and silent.\n\nHalfway through the half, an Everton volley whistled past the post and we heard them for the first time.\n\n“We forgot that you were here…”\n\nOn the half-hour, a calamity for James, replaced by Levi Colwill. Marc Cucarella switched to the right flank. We quickly discussed Reece James and the views were not favourable. In short, he has been way off his form of even two years ago of late. Sigh.\n\nOn thirty-seven minutes, Mudryk was super-fast but Broja could not finish, his shot going over from a tight angle.\n\nAnd that was it.\n\nAs the second-half began, I said to Gary that I couldn’t see either side scoring. With that, Sanchez got down remarkably well to turn an effort from Dwight McNeil around the post. The home fans were warmed by some more adventurous play from their team.\n\nOn fifty-four minutes, a quick break. McNeil to Dominic Calvert Lewin, well saved by Sanchez, but Abdoulaye Doucoure slotted home the rebound.\n\nNoise now.\n\nFackinell.\n\n“E – ver – ton, E – ver – ton.”\n\nWe replied with a loud “Carefree”.\n\nGame on? Maybe.\n\nWe dominated possession, but yet again had no cutting edge. A free-kick from Palmer just outside the box did not trouble Pickford.\n\nOn sixty-six minutes, a double substitution.\n\nRaheem Sterling for Enzo.\n\nNicolas Jackson for Broja.\n\nGod knows what the formation was now, but Sterling was wide right. Our final ball was always poor, but our movement off the ball was far worse.\n\nWe were treated to the king of shoulder charges by Cucarella down below us. His quality might not always be there, but his commitment this season is much much better.\n\nA new song from the Park End, presumably aimed at their noisy neighbours at the top of the hill, and a line about “sticking your trophies up your arse” was followed by a rendition of a rejuvenated song from the ‘sixties…\n\n“We are the Goodison Gang.”\n\nThe Chelsea support was quieter now. The mood was grey.\n\nOn eighty-four minutes, more substitutions.\n\nThe injured Sanchez was replaced by Djordje Petrovic, a debut. Ian Maatsen for Cucarella.\n\nIn injury time, a corner from down below us was punched out by the debutant ‘keeper but as the ball broke to an Everton player, I uttered the words “here we go.”\n\nI must have had a sixth sense.\n\nSubstitute Lewis Dobbin rifled the ball home.\n\nFackinell.\n\nI felt desolate. I stood silent. Many Chelsea drifted away.\n\nThe whistle blew and I was left with a dull ache inside.\n\nI let the crowds leave. A few more final photos.\n\nSo, Goodison, is that it then?\n\nWell, it would seem not. Just before I began typing this up, it was announced that Everton will remain at Goodison next season and move into Bramley Moore Dock in August 2025. It looks like I have one more tale from the Grand Old Lady to compose next year after all.\n\nIt had been an ultimately unrewarding weekend.\n\nFrome Town FA Trophy glory on Saturday? No.\n\nA win at my last visit to Goodison Park on Sunday? No.\n\nSo much for those two game nineteens.\n\nSee you at Stamford Bridge against Sheffield United.\n\nSaturday\n\nSunday\n\nManchester United vs. Chelsea : 6 December 2023.\n\nOriginally the plan was to stay up in the North-West for four nights, taking in the matches at Manchester United and Everton without the need to travel up and back twice. I had booked accommodation near Piccadilly for Wednesday night, and accommodation near Goodison Park for the other three nights. With it being our last-ever visit to the old lady, I thought it worthwhile to base ourselves in Liverpool, exploring some previously unvisited areas – North Wales maybe – while being close to the stadium for one last hurrah.\n\nThat was the plan.\n\nAnd then Frome Town buggered it all up.\n\nThe Mighty Dodge drew ex-Football League outfit Torquay United in the Third Round of the FA Trophy. Well, I couldn’t miss that. I even thought about leaving PD and Parky in Liverpool and driving to Frome on the Saturday. But then Parky decided that he needed to make other arrangements and we chose to cancel both stays.\n\nAt 1pm I collected PD in Frome and we began our journey north. It honestly did not seem too long ago that I last visited Old Trafford; it came at the end of last season, the first of two games in Manchester in a mere five days.\n\nIt’s a well-worn path. This would be my twenty-eighth away game with Chelsea at Old Trafford. It used to be a decent hunting ground. However, those days seem a long time ago. It is now over ten years since our last win at United, a lone strike from Juan Mata giving us the points in May 2013. Alex Ferguson announced that he would retire as United manager the very next day. I would like to think that the two are linked.\n\nWe reached “The Windmill” at the Tabley Interchange on the M6 at 4.45pm and we had a bite to eat. At 6pm, I set off on the last stretch. Alas, we were hit with tiresome traffic congestion as we crawled along the A56 through Altrincham and Sale, and then eventually along Chester Road and into Stretford. Past the old Art Deco cinema. Past the new McDonalds where “The Drum” used to be, past the shopping centre. We were parked up at 7.15pm.\n\nIt was a clear night. A little cold. No rain.\n\nI am sure I could walk this last section in my sleep. It is so familiar.\n\nAcross Gorse Hill Park. The floodlights of the cricket ground to my right. Back onto the Chester Road again. Past a lot of new buildings, much changed in the last fifteen years. But still that working men’s club on the right. A new car dealership. The hot dog stand. The steel of Old Trafford across the way. That large “Tesco” on the right. A new pop-up bar on the other pavement, a re-furbished 20’ sea container. Those tower blocks to the left. The trot over the road. “The Bishop Blaize” pub. The line of fast food places as you walk up to the cross-roads. Red-brick terraced houses beyond. Lou Macari’s chip shop. People queueing for food. The pungent smell of vinegar. The grafters selling match day scarves. Onto Sir Matt Busby Way. The bloke yelling out “United We Stand” and yet more stalls selling scarves and tat. The crowds getting deeper, a mix of accents. The line of police as the forecourt is reached. The neon signage on the East Stand. The Munich memorial. The Munich clock. The slope down to the away turnstiles. The hunt for familiar faces.\n\n“Kim!”\n\nI spotted Kim, from the US, now residing in Liverpool, and I handed over her match ticket. We bump into each other at a variety of locations – the last one a boat in Bristol harbour – and this was her first visit to Old Trafford for a few years.\n\nIt’s always the biggest away game for me, this one. It’s a classic battle. North vs. South. Red vs. Blue. Manchester vs. London. Old Trafford. The largest club ground in the UK. The scene of our 1970 FA Cup win. The scene of our 1915 FA Cup loss. Some huge battles over the decades.\n\nMy SLR is banned at both Manchester stadia and so I again wanted to take a few photos of the match-going support, close-up, rather than rely on too many grainy and fuzzy action shots using my smaller camera. There was a mandatory search and I was in. It was 7.50pm.\n\nThere was a new vantage point for me for this one. I am usually positioned in the curve above the corner flag. This time I was in Section 233, square behind the goal-line, a few yards inside the pitch. I was only a few seats away from the home fans. It allowed me a few new angles of Old Trafford for which I was grateful.\n\nThis was an 8.15pm kick-off. This relatively new kick-off time, at the behest of Amazon, seems particularly pernicious. An extra twist of the knife for match-going fans. There seemed to be no valid reason for it. Why not stage all of “their” midweek games at 7.30pm? With an 8.15pm start, it’s more tiredness, more pain, more stress, especially for those pour souls who were straight back in to work the next morning.\n\nAlan, alongside me in row seven had travelled up by coach. There were no trains back to London after the game. He aimed to get back home to South London by around 6am, another couple of days of annual leave used up, just like me.\n\nKev, a few rows behind me, had travelled up with some friends from the Bristol area, and although his father Brian was taking a turn to drive, Kev would be back in work at 6am on the Thursday, the poor sod.\n\nDespite the ridiculous kick-off time, our end was full. Three thousand strong. But of course. We may be going through a tough spell but the clamour for away tickets is as frenzied as ever. I saw no gaps in our section. Not one.\n\nTop marks.\n\nBefore the kick-off, I met up with Pete from Texas. His wife, a United fan, was in The Stretford End.\n\nThe teams entered the pitch from the corner. I had not yet seen the team.\n\nSanchez\n\nCucarella – Silva – Disasi – Colwill\n\nEnzo – Caicedo\n\nSterling – Palmer – Mudryk\n\nJackson\n\nOr something like that.\n\nThe home team had a mixture of names that I was and wasn’t overly familiar with. This isn’t the team of Rooney, Ronaldo, Ferdinand and Evra.\n\nIt isn’t even the team of Coppell, Buchan, Hill and Macari.\n\nThe current United team is not known in my household.\n\nThe game began.\n\nI had heard a new song in the crowded concourse before the game and here it was again.\n\n“Who’s that twat who comes from Portsmouth?”\n\nWell, Mason Mount wasn’t even playing, nor was he even on the bench.\n\nWe were under the cosh from the start and in the fourth minute Robert Sanchez collapsed well to finger-tip an angled shot from Rasmus Hojland, whoever he is, past the far post. It was all United.\n\nOn nine minutes, after another United attack, the referee signalled a penalty after VAR was called into action. I did not know why the penalty was given. There is no TV screen at Old Trafford. There was just the briefest of mentions of the penalty on the scoreboard in the corner of the Stretford End. So, I was left in the dark as Bruno Fernandes tee’d up the penalty. I lifted up my camera to capture the kick. With everyone stood, I saw nothing. I just heard a roar and I immediately tried to ascertain, in a nanosecond, if the roar was from us or from them. It was from us.\n\nGET IN.\n\nI had no idea if the ‘keeper had touched it, but I did not care one jot.\n\nIt was still 0-0.\n\nNot long after, Cole Palmer intercepted a pass from Sofyan Amrabat, whoever he is, and the ball fell to Nicolas Jackson. He passed to Mykhailo Mudryk who tamely shot against the near post.\n\nGary wasn’t sure who the United midfielder was and we both said that he looked like Juan Sebastian Veron.\n\n“Don’t worry, we’ll sign him in the summer.”\n\nUnited were carving us open, with their wide men enjoying tons of space. I didn’t like how Levi Colwill, the night’s captain, was not close to his man, while Raheem Sterling was reluctant to double-back and help Marc Cucarella, who often had to cope with two or even three men running at him. A shot from Alejandro Garnacho was saved by Sanchez and in the immediate break, Mudryk must have been overwhelmed as he raced forward with players in support to his left and right. In the end, his pass to the right to Sterling was awful, and was easily intercepted.\n\nShots were exchanged. Antony at Sanchez. Enzo at Onana.\n\nPossession was given up easily. It was as if the ball was an unexploded bomb awaiting detonation. The ball was nobody’s friend. On twenty minutes, a move down our right carved us open, and when the ball came back to Scott McTominay, the midfielder purposefully volleyed it low and into the net. He celebrated down below us.\n\nMore mistakes followed. And chances. A poor touch by Jackson allowed Onana to block.\n\nIt frustrated the living hell out of all of us to see Chelsea continue to play the ball out from the back. This well-rehearsed ploy attempted to entice United on, allowing us to cut them open with a series of blistering passes played with cutthroat precision that would lead to devastating counter-attacks.\n\n“Er…what?”\n\nOur passing throughout the first-half was to prove to be our Achilles heel. Yet United were almost as bad. This was no remake of the 2008 Champions League Final.\n\nOn the half-hour, Jackson set up Mudryk. He drove on in the inside left channel but his effort was as tame as they come, the ball idly missing the near post by yards.\n\nThe mood in the away end was of frustration and then perhaps even anger.\n\nI noted how Cole Palmer often came deep in an effort to knit things together but he found it oh-so difficult. Enzo was quiet. Caicedo non-existent.\n\nApproaching the last five minutes of the first-half, I quickly tallied up that it could have been 5-3.\n\nCrazy game.\n\nWith Harry Maguire finding himself in an advanced position on their right down below us, the tall centre-back adeptly back-heeled the ball to a team mate and the United fans in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand collectively laughed.\n\nOn forty-five minutes, Mudryk played in Palmer. He drifted in along the edge of the penalty box, defenders close by, and magnificently stroked the ball in at the far post.\n\nYES!\n\nWe went doo-fucking-lally.\n\nHe must have loved that, an ex-City player scoring at the Stretford End.\n\nThere was a song for Palmer.\n\n“He moves it from the left to right. Cole Palmer is dynamite.”\n\nThis was followed by a loud “Carefree” that rung out from Sections 230 to 233. We had been pretty quiet as the half developed but here was a moment to enjoy.\n\nThe inevitable “just like London your city is blue.”\n\nAt half-time, I bumped into a few faces in the concourse.\n\n“Not much quality but there’s a lot going on.”\n\nI briefly met up with Johnny Twelve from California, celebrating his fiftieth Chelsea game. His wife was alongside him in the away section. I spotted that hundreds of central seats in the lower tier of the Stretford End were empty at the start of the second-half. This is obviously where United had decided to locate many of their corporate guests, many of whom were taking their time to return to their seats.\n\nThe lower tier of the Stretty.\n\nGood God.\n\nThis end was the beating heart of Old Trafford when I was younger, when I first visited the stadium in 1986, and throughout the next few decades. I can’t imagine what the United faithful think about this.\n\nModern football, eh?\n\nMauricio Pochettino replaced the keen but exposed Cucarella with Reece James. The second-half began and we wondered what on Earth would happen next.\n\nChances were not so frequent as in the first-half.\n\nLuke Shaw, at left-back, and defending near us, was the object of some abuse from Gary.\n\n“The size of your shorts, Shaw.”\n\n“Oi, Shaw. Billy Smart wants his tent back.”\n\nA corner from down below us from Mudryk was flicked on by James and Jackson’s header at the far post really should have hit the target. A strong run from Mudryk then took him into the danger area but his shot was deflected for a corner. At the other end, Garnacho cut inside and his shot on goal reminded me so much of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s late equaliser against us in the autumn of 1997. Thankfully, this effort continued to rise over the bar.\n\nAlas, from virtually the same place in the penalty box, Garnacho sent a teasing cross over to the far post and Teddy Sheringham, Eric Cantona, Andy Cole, Denis Law, Lou Macari, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Wayne Rooney, Gary Pallister, Billy Meredith and Bobby Charlton were among those lining up to head home. Scott McTominay got the touch.\n\n2-1. Bollocks.\n\nTwo goals for McTominay. Bollocks.\n\nThere was a sniff of VAR cancelling the goal – again, I have no idea what for – but the goal stood. What with late kick-off times and VAR replays for those watching elsewhere, football is a TV game now. As if anyone was in any doubt.\n\nThere were twenty minutes’ left. The mood in the away end deteriorated. Rather than improve things with stability, James was having a ‘mare. In fact, the whole bloody team were awful.\n\nGarnacho, with an instinctive angled shot, wide.\n\nFackinell.\n\nIn the first-half there had been rare breaks. In the second-half there had been virtually nothing. Armando Broja replaced Mudryk on seventy-seven minutes, and I wondered why Jackson will still playing. He had been, perhaps, the poorest of the bunch all night long.\n\nReece James blazed over from an angle.\n\nRidiculously, we were only losing 2-1 and we were one goal away from the most improbable point. In the last few minutes, a deep cross from James found the leap from Broja at the far post. He hit the frame of the goal.\n\nOh God.\n\nThe final straw for me took place in added time, with us showing no urgency at all at a throw-in, and no players looking like they were too bothered about anything.\n\nNo movement. No desire. No talking. No gesticulating. No fervour.\n\nNo hope.\n\nThe final whistle was blown and I headed for the exits. I couldn’t face clapping the players, but I heard the boos from among our fans. I just glowered.\n\nWe walked, as quickly as we could, back to the car. I overheard a few conversations from the home fans. They were pragmatic, but generally subdued, far from euphoric.\n\n“Scott McTominay. He’s our top scorer now.”\n\n“Says it all, doesn’t it?”\n\nYeah, Scott bloody McTominay.\n\nWe walked past the chippies. The smell of vinegar cut through the air again. Along the Chester Road, the familiar walk, the familiar feeling.\n\nWe were back on the M6 at 11pm and, after stopping at Keele Services and Strensham Services, I made good time heading south. PD ran through the league positions and – yes – all of the teams above us are undoubtedly better than us. We seem destined to finish in tenth place this season. I joked that the best that we can hope for in May is to finish top of the West London League, ahead of Brentford and Fulham.\n\nEverton on Sunday will be a struggle and I can hear the words already.\n\n“I’ll take a draw now.”\n\nIt is becoming our mantra this season.\n\nI eventually made it home at 2.50am.\n\nThere is no punchline.\n\nTEAMS\n\nUS\n\nCORNER\n\nSTAND\n\nYELLOW\n\nSTEPS\n\nTHEM\n\nALONE\n\nOUTSIDE\n\n> dedicated to the loyal three thousand\n\nChelsea vs. Newcastle United : 28 May 2023.\n\nA month or so ago I mentioned that Ron Hockings, one of our greatest ever supporters, celebrated his 1,400th first team Chelsea game with our away match at Craven Cottage in April 1983. At the time, as a seventeen-year-old from Somerset, I could only dream of such ridiculous numbers of attendance. While Ron was clocking up game number 1,400, I was yet to break thirty matches. In those days, I would go to around four games each season.\n\nBut years pass, right?\n\nLo and behold, our last game of the 2022/23 season would be my 1,400th Chelsea game too. As I reviewed the letter from Ron in the programme from forty years ago, I was reassured that he counted first-team friendlies in his total. As do I.\n\nIt gave my total a certain cachet of authenticity.\n\n“Bloody hell, I am not travelling to Kuala Lumpur with Chelsea without including it in my total.”\n\nI like it that Ron celebrated 1,400 in 1982/83, a season that I have been detailing during this campaign. And here I am celebrating 1,400 forty years later. I am not sure that I ever spoke to Ron. I may have “nodded” a hello on a few occasions, but you used to see Ron everywhere. Like Peter Kemp and Alan Bruce, they would appear wherever Chelsea were playing. I have dipped into his book “100 Years Of The Blues” to help me add to my own memories of that season and I owe him a huge pile of gratitude. From 1947 to 2006, Ron went to a grand total of 2,703 Chelsea games, a ludicrous amount. He passed away around fifteen years ago, but his books will live forever.\n\nWith a lovely touch of symmetry, game number 1,400 would be against Newcastle United, as was my very first game in 1974.\n\n16 March 1974 : Chelsea vs. Newcastle United.\n\n29 May 2023 : Chelsea vs. Newcastle United.\n\nPerfect.\n\nAnd while we are on the subject of numbers and milestones, my attendance at the game on 29 May would allow me to complete my third – and only my third – ever-present league campaign of Chelsea matches.\n\n2008/09 : 38/38\n\n2015/16 : 38/38\n\n2022/23 : 38/38\n\nAs my friend Ian would point out, a pattern has emerged here. Is my need to attend all the league games a seven-year itch? Is my next ever-present season due in 2029/30 when I will be – gulp – sixty-four? No, it’s just a product of being able, or not, to get to as many as I can. There is no plan.\n\nI can’t really explain all this. But ever since that first game almost fifty years ago, I just love going to Chelsea matches. At the start, it was all about the players. Seeing my heroes play. Then, over time, I fell in love with the routine of attending games, the camaraderie, the laughs. Now, that is more important than the football.\n\n“Which is just as bloody well after this season” I hear you all joking.\n\nWell, I’ve seen worse, as my chronicles of 1982/83 prove.\n\nThis season hasn’t been the worst in our history, but at times it has felt the most disjointed, disappointing, under-achieving and – crucially – the least enjoyable.\n\nIt’s a shame that this accolade is bestowed by myself on 2023/24, my fiftieth consecutive season of match-going support for the club.\n\nWe can’t really class that as an honour can we?\n\nThe pre-match routine for the final game of this tortuous season followed the usual lines. Once I had walked down to Stamford Bridge with Ron – he played in Game #1 of course – it was lovely that my friend Kathryn and I managed to sort out a photo that would include four players from the 1982/83 season; Colin Pates, Paul Canoville, John Bumstead and Gary Chivers, plus Rodders thrown in for good measure. Kathryn and I then decamped to “The Eight Bells” via a stop at “The Broadway Bar & Grill” and we spent a decent hour or so with the two Glenns, Salisbury Steve and the Kent Lot.\n\nThe pub was bouncing with laughs and giggles; an outsider would find it hard to believe that we had all been following such a poor team over the past ten long months.\n\nInside “The Eight Bells”, there was a poignant moment for a few of us too. The Chelsea match-going family had recently been saddened by the death of a friend, Ian Oliver, who we had last seen in “The Eight Bells” before a game at Chelsea around six weeks ago. Ian was one of those chaps that you always bumped into at Chelsea, usually in “The Goose” but other pubs too. His was a face that I recognised from decades ago. And Ian was one of those rare Chelsea fans that lived locally, in Fulham, along with just a handful of other fans in my circle. I am pretty sure that his sister worked at “Chubby’s Grill” on match days, a hot dog van that was part of the furniture for years. Ian had recently gone to the gym and I commented to him during that last time in the pub that he had lost some weight and was looking good, bless him.\n\nIan – “Elvis” – will undoubtedly be missed by all of his Chelsea friends.\n\nRest In Peace.\n\nAs we left the pub, two female away fans sauntered past and one of them noisily remarked :\n\n“Oh, youse have had a shite season, eh?”\n\n“No need for that, is there?” I replied.\n\nIndeed, there was a noisy bunch of Newcastle United fans, who had been drinking in Putney and close to our pub in Fulham, alongside us on the tube journey up to Fulham Broadway. A few were in fancy dress. There had been a few boats containing away fans alighting at Putney and I got the feeling that this was the happiest that the Geordies had been at a game at Chelsea since the days of Kevin Keegan as their manager.\n\nTo be fair, Eddie Howe has had a fine season up on Tyneside and all of us look forward to visiting the area again next season, as always a favourite away destination.\n\nElsewhere, three teams were fighting off relegation; two of Everton, Leeds United and Leicester City would join Southampton in a final relegation place by the end of the afternoon. I know that many wanted Everton to go, but not me. From a purely selfish reason, I wanted to be able to plan, visit and appreciate one last away day at Goodison Park at some stage in 2023/24 before they decamp to their new stadium at Bramley Moore Dock in 2024. It has been my favourite away ground for ages. I hoped for a win for them at home to Bournemouth.\n\nOn the Saturday, we had learned that Luton Town would be joining Burnley and Sheffield United in the top flight, though I wanted Coventry City to prevail. With Luton Town, Sheffield United and Burnley in the top flight, 2023/24 was beginning to resemble 1974/75, and this sent a shiver down my spine.\n\nI was inside Stamford Bridge with plenty of time to spare. There was a small eulogy, with a photo, of Ian Oliver in the match programme.\n\nBefore the game, trophies were handed out to Lewis Hall – Academy Player Of The Year – Conor Gallagher – Goal Of The Season, Crystal Palace away – and Thiago Silva – Player Of The Year.\n\nFrank presented Silva with his award. Surely this was a unanimous decision. The man ought to have won it last season too.\n\nThere had been Chelsea chat on the way up to London in the car. A lot of it centered upon Frank Lampard. I remember how happy he was on his return to the club, smiling at Cobham, full of delight. Looking back, it is clear that the club that he was forced to leave in early 2021 is not the same beast that it is now. Everything seems to have changed for the worst. There is no continuity now, that “Chelsea DNA” seems to have evaporated, we are a club in disarray. With hindsight, Frank’s gamble hasn’t paid off. I wonder how difficult it will now be for him, should he really feel the need, to get back into football management after this second spell with his beloved Chelsea.\n\nThat said, it has really disappointed me that so many in the Chelsea fan base, and – alas – even in my band of match day acquaintances have almost gleefully mocked Frank Lampard in recent weeks using language that I really found hard to stomach.\n\nNo respect.\n\nBefore the game, we were reminded that the day would probably mark another “farewell” to a Chelsea great. Since signing in 2012, Cesar Azpilicueta has played over 450 games for Chelsea and I always say he is “Mister 7/10”. His legs have gone recently but nobody can doubt his spirit. Before the players appeared on the pitch, a banner with mosaics honoured Dave – I still call him Dave, you might have noticed – in The Shed.\n\nFranks final starting eleven?\n\nKepa\n\nDave – Silva – Chalobah – Hall\n\nEnzo – Loftus-Cheek – Gallagher\n\nMadueke – Havertz – Sterling\n\nNewcastle were in white shorts, and I remembered that they wore these in a 6-0 Chelsea win in 1980, but I doubted a repeat.\n\n“Grabbing at straws, there, Chris.”\n\nThe Sleepy Hollow was ready; the Buchmann Brothers Alan and Gary – sons of lovely Joe – Glenn, Clive, Alan and little old me. Clive had treated us to hot chocolates once again before the game.\n\nThis has often felt like the longest ever season, what with the horrible World Cup break in November and December, though the COVID hit season three years ago went on even longer. It seemed like this one was never going to end, and there was a slightly surreal to the game with both teams having not a great deal to play for.\n\nHere we go then, Chelsea…game one thousand, four hundred.\n\nNo pressure.\n\nThe travelling Toon Army were in good voice as their team edged the opening exchanges. A white flare was set off in front of their fans; that fog from the Tyne was drifting long distances. Kepa did well to save at his near post after Aleksander Isak found space in the penalty area.\n\nIn an open first few minutes, it was the away team who looked the likelier to score. Indeed, we looked stretched after ten minutes when Allan Saint-Maximin was released on their left, amid acres of space, with Dave sadly nowhere near the wide man. It was if Dave had forgotten that he was the wide defender in the back four. The ball was played outside to Elliot Anderson who drilled a low cross into that infamous “corridor of uncertainty” for Anthony Gordon, hopelessly unmarked, to pounce.\n\nBack in 1974, Ian Hutchinson gave us a 1-0 lead on ten minutes. In 2023, the start was sadly reversed.\n\nOn fourteen minutes, a Thiago Silva effort seemed to be creeping in at the far post but Martin Dubravka clumsily pushed it out for a corner. We were clawing our way back into the game. We enjoyed some pressure with Noni Madueke looking lively at times. A deflected shot from his volley soared just over. The corners mounted up.\n\nOn twenty-seven minutes, a free-kick was awarded in a deep but central position. Everyone was expecting a cross towards the far stick, but Enzo was switched on and drilled a ball into the path of Raheem Sterling in the inside-right channel who cut in past his marker and unleashed a goal-bound shot that was deflected in by Kieran Trippier.\n\nPhew.\n\nJust after, Stamford Bridge was united with a stadium-wide chant for the first time.\n\nI looked around and, despite our rotten – by our standards – season, there were not many empty seats in the stadium. This has to be a good sign. This augurs well for the future.\n\nMadueke, a teasing threat down the right, then went close but a defender blocked his shot.\n\nJust before the half-time whistle, the two ‘keepers made two fine saves. The first came from an awful, unchallenged break from Saint-Maximin who set up fan favourite Miguel Almiron, with Lewis Hall out of position, but Kepa stood up and palmed a weak effort away. Then, Dubravka clawed away an effort from Sterling, after a pin-point cross from Hall, and the follow-up was hacked away too.\n\nAs first-halves went it was “fair to middling.”\n\nI mentioned to Ian, who sits a few rows in front, that supporting Chelsea this season has been like watching a tribute act, a poor one at that, to a once great band.\n\nThe intermission came to an end and one last forty-five minutes remained.\n\nWesley Fofana replaced Trevoh Chalobah.\n\nThe game continued and the first part of the second-half was neither dull nor entertaining. With Chelsea attacking us in the Matthew Harding, I was hoping for some action down below us. Elsewhere, it was advantage Leicester City, winning at home to West Ham United but I fully expected Everton to nab a winner. Leeds were losing at home to Tottenham and were dead and buried.\n\nWe were having the majority of the ball now, but were unable to do much with it. The game was in danger of fizzling out.\n\nA Madueke effort, after a shimmy inside, curled high over the framework of the goal.\n\nWe heard that Everton had scored.\n\nOn the hour, some substitutions.\n\nCarney Chukwuemeka for Loftus-Cheek.\n\nThere was a slow walk to the touch-line from Ruben, and he applauded the fans who were applauding him. Undoubtedly, this was his final game in Chelsea blue. I first saw Ruben, aged just seventeen, at a friendly in New York against Manchester City in May 2013 and he has been on the periphery of our first team ever since. We have waited in vain for his early promise to blossom – his injury in a superfluous friendly in Boston in 2019 was cruel in the extreme – and it is hard to believe that he has played ten times for England. His play confused me and often irritated me. I longed for him to show more urgency in his play and in himself. He will move on, but I don’t think he will improve in the next five years; a shame.\n\nJoao Felix for Kai Havertz.\n\nHavertz’ play irritates me too, but that’s another story.\n\nOn sixty-four minutes, an over hit cross luckily found Hall, but he in turn over hit the shot.\n\nGood work from Carney and Hall set up a chance, close in, for Sterling but he blasted wildly over.\n\nI was convinced that we’d win this.\n\n“COME ON CHELS.”\n\nAn old favourite was aired, which I adapted to my own styling.\n\n“Fabregas is magic.\n\nHe wears a magic hat.\n\nHe could’ve signed for Arsenal.\n\nBut he said ‘no, fuck that’.\n\nHe passes with his left foot.\n\nHe passes with his right.\n\nAnd when we win the league again.\n\nI’ll be ninety-seven.”\n\nOn seventy minutes, Mateo Kovacic replaced Conor Gallagher.\n\nWe still dominated possession.\n\nThere were Shots from Felix and Enzo but these did not really threaten Dubravka.\n\nOne excellent move lit up the final part of the game. A high ball by Enzo out to Hall was delightfully flicked on to Madueke, who hunted down a defender and passed back to Carney, who in turn set up Sterling. His shot was destined to be going in, I thought, but was deflected wide. I stood up and scowled at everyone behind me.\n\nThere was a VAR review for a possible handball but nothing was given.\n\nA cross from Maduele and a slide from Felix; just wide. A shimmying run from Madueke – he has had a good few games – but a weak shot signalled his last participation. He was replaced by the forgotten man Christian Pulisic, who struck poorly at Dubravka. Our chances were coming thick and fast now, as if the painful season-long constipation in front of goal had been suddenly relieved by a powerful laxative. A Felix free-kick flew wide.\n\nA beautiful move then saw a perfect cross from Hall pick out the jump from Felix. His body contorted wonderfully to allow a fine header, but the effort flew just over.\n\nIt was a surprising end to our season; and yet, not.\n\nTons of chances; no goal scorer.\n\nRight at the death, a loud and resounding chant of “Super Frank” enveloped the whole stadium. We couldn’t say goodbye to him properly in 2014 nor 2021 with a proper “Franksgiving” send-off, so this was better, though far from ideal in lieu of the unconvincing end to his second spell as manager.\n\nThe game ended 1-1.\n\nElsewhere, Everton stayed up.\n\nI suspected that Frank would be happy about that.\n\nWe had spoken about the risk of a “lap of honour” on the way up in the car. Usually, at the end of far more successful seasons, players disappear and then come back on to the pitch. My view was that it would be better for the players to stay on the pitch at the final whistle, because if they went off for even five minutes, not many Chelsea fans would be left.\n\nThey played it right, just like I had hoped for.\n\nThe Newcastle team went over to thank their fans, then the Chelsea squad walked slowly in front of The Shed End and Parkyville specifically – where Kathryn was spotted ten seats away from Parky – before slowly marching towards us in the Matthew Harding.\n\n“Azpilicueta. We’ll just call you Dave.”\n\nBizarrely, I only focused on Frank – in a navy tracksuit – quite late on. My eyes must have been on others, and his final farewell was relatively subdued. There were no smiles on Frank’s face, nor did I expect any. This had been a tough two months at the end of a tough season and a tough fifteen months for Chelsea Football Club.\n\nN’Golo Kante and Mason Mount were reduced to throwing small footballs into the crowd; I wondered if we would see these two players next season. N’Golo has been wonderful for us since 2016, but we are all concerned about his recent injuries. But oh what a player, what a person, and what a smile. Mason has endured a frustrating time since Porto. I will not be surprised if he decides to move on. Let’s see what happens.\n\nThe season has ended, and it has been such a tough watch. Looking back, the highlights were undoubtedly the three Champions League trips to Milan, via Turin, to Salzburg, via Nurnburg, and to Dortmund, via Brussels. I really enjoyed them. Outside of those, there has been little, and not even a win against Tottenham. Yes, it has been that bad. The football itself, from day one at Goodison, has been dire and I have found it difficult to get emotionally close to any of our players.\n\nI admire Thiago Silva though. I like Enzo. I am thankful for Dave’s service. I worry about Reece. Let’s get a striker and we’ll see what develops.\n\nI took my time leaving the Matthew Harding. Outside, I took one final photo of other fans walking down the last flight of steps, now adorned with “CFC”, and I am using it now as a closing photo, and end point, for this season.\n\nI will pair it up with the very first photo that I took this season, previously unshared anywhere, and I repeat here the story that I told way back in August\n\n“I hopped up onto a small wall to gain a good vantage point of the overall scene. This would be photo number one of the season.\n\nSnap.\n\nOn leaping down from the wall, my legs crumpled and I fell.\n\nSplat.\n\nThe camera and spare lens went flying. My knees – my fucking knees! – were smarting. I was sure I had torn my jeans. There was blood on my right hand. What a start to the season’s photographs. I dusted myself down, then let out a huge laugh.\n\nThe first fackinell of the season? Oh yes.\n\nOne photo taken and carnage.”\n\nI should have known, then, that this was going to be a tough old season.\n\nFrom Goodison Park, and Bramley Moore Dock, to Stamford Bridge – from first to last.\n\nOne final word. I have enjoyed recapturing the feelings that I had for Chelsea in 1982/83 throughout this campaign. It has been a ten-month dip into my youth. I have re-read diaries, checked old programmes, researched on-line and devoured Ron Hockings’ books. To be honest, it’s almost as if I knew that this current season was going to be – er – “troublesome” and that I needed a historical counterbalance to the turmoil of 2022/23.\n\n“Was 2022/23 bad? Oh yes. But you should have lived through 1982/83.”\n\nOne thing made me smart though. I noticed that in my diaries, I usually referred to Chelsea as “they” which really surprised me. I am always chastising Chelsea fans for referring to Chelsea as “they” and “them” rather than “we” and “us” for reasons that I hope are clear.\n\nWe are one of the same.\n\nYet, forty years ago, I too was referring to Chelsea as a separate entity. Fear not, I am sure that this was soon to change. After all, 1983/84 was just around the corner, and that was my team.\n\nAnd we will be Chelsea forever.\n\nSee you in August.\n\nBefore Game 1,400\n\nGame 1,400\n\nAfter Game 1,400\n\n1982/83 & 2022/23\n\nThe First And The Last\n\nThe First And The Last\n\nThe First\n\nThe Last\n\nThe 1,400 Games\n\n1973/74 : 1\n\n1974/75 : 2\n\n1975/76 : 4\n\n1976/77 : 3\n\n1977/78 : 2\n\n1978/79 : 2\n\n1979/80 : 3\n\n1980/81 : 2\n\n1981/82 : 4\n\n1982/83 : 4\n\n1983/84 : 11\n\n1984/85 : 22\n\n1985/86 : 22\n\n1986/87 : 20\n\n1987/88 : 15\n\n1988/89 : 15\n\n1989/90 : 2\n\n1990/91 : 10\n\n1991/92 : 14\n\n1992/93 : 10\n\n1993/94 : 15\n\n1994/95 : 29\n\n1995/96 : 31\n\n1996/97 : 33\n\n1997/98 : 35\n\n1998/99 : 30\n\n1999/00 : 38\n\n2000/01 : 27\n\n2001/02 : 29\n\n2002/03 : 31\n\n2003/04 : 31\n\n2004/05 : 44\n\n2005/06 : 40\n\n2006/07 : 51\n\n2007/08 : 55\n\n2008/09 : 54\n\n2009/10 : 51\n\n2010/11 : 44\n\n2011/12 : 58\n\n2012/13 : 57\n\n2013/14 : 47\n\n2014/15 : 42\n\n2015/16 : 55\n\n2016/17 : 47\n\n2017/18 : 56\n\n2018/19 : 56\n\n2019/20 : 41\n\n2020/21 : 2\n\n2022/23 : 55\n\n2023/24 : 47\n\nChelsea vs. Brighton And Hove Albion : 15 April 2023.\n\nJust as I was driving away from my usual parking space at Chelsea after the game with Brighton, I summed things up to PD in the seat alongside me :\n\n“Out-played, out-shot, out-fought, out-thought.”\n\nIn a season of sub-par performances, this perhaps had been the worst of the lot. No positives at all? It certainly bloody felt like it. I will come back to the game later but as there is a lot to get through in this ramble I had best begin.\n\nShall we do things chronologically again?\n\nThe next game to feature in my retrospective look at our worst-ever season, 1982/83, is our away match at Boundary Park, the home of perennial Second Division battlers Oldham Athletic. This encounter was played on Saturday 9 April 1983 and came on the back of a four-game winless streak for John Neal’s troops. My diary noted that the game kicked-off at 2pm. Perhaps this was a result of that afternoon’s televised Grand National which, from memory, used to start around 4pm. Clubs were so desperate for spectators in those days that I suspect that this was the reason. Regardless, the match was really poorly attended; just 4,923 showed up. I often hear talk of us taking thousands to away games in those days. I suspect that it wasn’t the case on this occasion.\n\nAt the time, Oldham Athletic were stacked full of former Manchester City players and were managed by the former City striker Joe Royle. Playing for the Latics on this occasion were Kenny Clements, Tony Henry and Roger Palmer. Not involved on this day were Paul Futcher and Ged Keegan. All of these players had previously turned out for Manchester City.\n\nAt half-time, the score was 1-1, at full-time it ended up 2-2. Mercurial midfielder Mike Fillery scored both, with one from the penalty spot. The Chelsea team included debutant Paul Williams, a young central defender, who only ever played this one game in our colours. After the match, we dropped two places to fifteenth in the twenty-two team division. We had six games left to play with four being at home, yet were just two points off a relegation place.\n\nI, and many thousands of others, were worried. We were barely limping along as the end of the season approached.\n\nMy diary the day after the Oldham game mentions my thoughts :\n\n“All of a sudden, things are looking really desperate. Only now does relegation seem a possibility. I hadn’t really considered it to any depth until today.”\n\nDespite all of this, I was definitely excited to be attending our next fixture, a home match with Newcastle United, only my fourth “live” game of the season. I was still at school and I had only worked a couple of Saturdays in my father’s shop that season so every spare bit of pocket money, Christmas money and ad hoc gifts from relatives were saved up with such frugality that I rarely spent any extra money on anything else. An occasional illegal beer on a night out, quaffed slowly, was really my only other expenditure. These were definitely simpler times but Chelsea was everything to me. The game against the Geordies, on Saturday 16 April, could not come quick enough.\n\nAs a quick aside, on the preceding Thursday I had met up with a couple of Canadian relatives who were touring England at the time. My father’s cousin Mary was chaperoning her daughter Marina on a school band trip. I met Marina for the first time one evening in nearby Bath. I, sadly, already knew that Marina was a Manchester United supporter. She kindly presented me with a Chelsea scarf, but also a few of Vancouver Whitecap items. Marina and both her parents were Whitecaps season ticket holders. No doubt I tut-tutted when I saw Marina wearing an actual United shirt. Anyway, for reasons beast known to Marina, she had been wearing the Chelsea scarf on her travels around England but the coach driver had warned her to take it off as she would get beaten up. This, I thought, was a bit excessive, but no doubt fed into the narrative of Chelsea Football Club being famous, only, for hooliganism in 1983.\n\nFast-forwarding to 2023, I have three games to mention.\n\nOn Bank holiday Monday, I watched Frome Town defeat local rivals Melksham Town 2-1, winning the game with a last-minute goal from Jon Davies in front of 491.\n\nOn the Wednesday, I watched at home on my computer as Chelsea lost 0-2 against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu. Such is my level of expectancy at the moment that I was relatively happy that we didn’t get beaten more heavily.\n\nThen, on Thursday evening I returned to see Frome Town defeat strugglers Cinderford Town 5-1. This game attracted 425, a gate helped by a fine sponsorship deal involving local businesses allowing fans to enter for free. The football against Melksham and Cinderford was the best all season and, as daft as it now seemed, Frome now have an outside chance of sneaking into the last two play-off positions, currently held by Wimborne Town and Tavistock.\n\nOn the morning of the Brighton game at Stamford Bridge, a sizeable part of me wished that I was staying in Somerset to see a third Frome game in six days, another derby against Paulton Rovers.\n\nBut Chelsea was calling.\n\nAs often is the case, the pre-match was far more enjoyable than the main event. I met up with Ollie from Normandy once again and also my Brighton mate Mac and two of his friends Barry and Guy. We enjoyed a fine time in “The Eight Bells.” I arrived at about midday. PD and Parky were already there. Salisbury Steve would join us too. We just about fitted around a table.\n\nOllie told me that he much prefers the older stadia in England as opposed to the new ones. He is yet to visit The Emirates and has no desire to do so. He much prefers the likes of Goodison Park, Fratton Park and Selhurst Park. We promised each other to meet up at Turf Moor next season.\n\nMac and I are soon celebrating ten years of friendship; we started chatting about football in a Manhattan bar in late May 2013 and have kept in touch ever since. Our two teams play, ironically, in the US in July. I, for one, won’t be there. Barry asked me for advice about travelling to Wembley as they are playing Manchester United in an FA Cup semi-final next weekend. This ties in nicely with my 1982/83 retrospective as in that season’s FA Cup Final, Brighton took eventual winners Manchester United to a replay.\n\nIt honestly didn’t seem six months ago that we were all drinking in Lewes before that shocking 1-4 defeat at the Amex. And who would have thought that both of our teams would now be hosting Argentinian World Cup winners?\n\nAlexis Mac Allister – no relation – I would realise, was playing for Boca Juniors at the time that I saw them play Atletico Tucamen in January 2020, although he did not take part in that particular game. On the previous night, however, I did see his brother Francis play for Argentinos Juniors against Lanus.\n\nLike me, Mac gets no thrills from watching England play these days. And also like me, he hardly watches football on TV if it doesn’t involve his team. His wife can’t understand it.\n\n“But you are a football fan. Why don’t you watch?”\n\n“I’m a Brighton fan.”\n\nI had a knowing chuckle.\n\nAnd I summed up my reluctance to get emotionally involved with England these days.\n\n“Why bother watching millionaires who play for teams I hate?”\n\nMy bluntness shocked me, God knows what the others thought.\n\nWe made our way to Putney Bridge tube, Ollie’s Army, an updated version of Oliver’s Army.\n\n“The boys from Somerset, Wiltshire, Sussex and Normandy…”\n\nThe rain had held off; the sun was out. I was in at around 2.30pm, perfect.\n\nFrank’s starting eleven?\n\nKepa\n\nChalobah – Fofana – Badiashile – Chilwell\n\nEnzo – Zakaria – Gallagher\n\nPulisic – Sterling – Mudryk\n\nA few question marks there. The forward line certainly didn’t thrill me. And a return to a flat-back four? Righty-oh.\n\nThe new pre-match of Blur, Harry J. All-Stars and – er – the Foo Fighters.\n\nA sign was unfurled in The Shed.\n\n“WELCOME HOME SUPER FRANK.”\n\nBut this was as low key as it gets.\n\nNot many people that I spoke to expected a win. I have been saying all season long that our position does not lie and that Brentford, Fulham and Brighton are better than us. I still could not see where a goal was coming from. It was four games in a row now. I mentioned our horrific end to 1980/81 to a few souls; “nine games with not one single goal.”\n\nGulp.\n\nThere was no emotional backdrop of noise welcoming Frank Lampard back at Stamford Bridge. I’ll admit that it seemed odd, super-odd, to be seeing him in navy blue in front of the East Stand once more, our first sighting since the Everton game slightly more than three years ago. What a crazy time it has been since.\n\nCOVID, football behind closed doors, Lampard sacked, Tuchel in, European Cup glory, a war in Ukraine, sanctions, Roman Abramovich ousted, reduced-capacities, Lampard to Everton, Clearlake in, Billy Gimour to Brighton, Levi Colwell to Brighton, Marc Cucarella to Chelsea, Tuchel sacked, Potter to Chelsea, De Zerbi to Brighton, Chelsea walloped at Brighton 4-1, Lampard sacked at Everton, Potter sacked at Chelsea, Lampard returning to Chelsea, Tottenham still shite.\n\nFootball, eh? Fackinell.\n\nThe game began with Brighton looking the most-threatening in the opening spell. After just two minutes, I thought they had scored via Kaoru Mitoma but cross was touched wide at the near post by Mac Allister.\n\nIn a very open start to the game, a Mykhailo Mudryk run from deep promised much before he was felled unceremoniously by Joel Veltman. There then followed a cross from Mudryk that was deflected away for a corner by Lewis Dunk. The Ukranian then followed this up with a shot from thirty yards that went wide.\n\nNext, breathless stuff this, a chance for Brighton with the goal gaping but wide. They then hit the bar a minute later, Evan Ferguson digging one out from outside the box. Trevoh Chalobah and Benoit Badiashile were looking nervous in their first starts for a while.\n\nOn ten minutes, the first “Super Frank” chant but it was hardly deafening.\n\nOn fourteen minutes, probably against the run of play, Mudryk broke in from the left, advanced, and played the ball back to Conor Gallagher. His strike was on target but hit Lewis Dunk – the own goal king a few years ago – and spun high and over Robert Sanchez in the Brighton goal.\n\nBloody hell, a goal, I hardly knew how to react.\n\nPhew.\n\nWe had spoken about getting a little luck to break our recent drought and this was just right. Conor reeled away, a former Palace player, and celebrated in front of the Albion fans.\n\nSadly, we didn’t push on and Kepa soon had to be called into action to thwart the away team’s advances. Twice in a minute he saved us. First, he claimed a high ball into the six-yard box and then ran out to block.\n\nOn twenty-five minutes, the elusive Mitoma slalomed into the box but Kepa did ever so well to save low.\n\nThe atmosphere was quiet. I was yet to join in with anything.\n\nOn the half-hour, three more Brighton chances. A really fine break at pace carved through our lines but the end result flew wide. Another shot was blocked. Then Kepa saved well from point blank range, a Ferguson header palmed over.\n\nThis was turning into a very ropey Chelsea performance indeed. On thirty-seven minutes, a rare attack saw Wesley Fofana cross from the right, but it was slightly too high for Raheem Sterling to either head goal wards or properly steer the ball back to Mudryk.\n\nJust before the break, Brighton moved the ball well and a hanging cross came in from the right. I was hoping that Chalobah would be able to head away, but the ball fell between him and Fofana, and new substitute Danny Welbeck pounced.\n\n1-1.\n\nMy sadness temporarily evaporated when a friend messaged me to say that Frome had gone 2-0 up against Paulton. As I shouted over to PD with this information, no doubt with a smile, I was filled with absolute guilt.\n\nThe away support boomed loudly.\n\n“ALBION! ALBION!”\n\nJust before the whistle, a fine move from us but a save from Sanchez at the near stick.\n\nAt least there were no boos at half-time.\n\nAt the break, Gary Cahill, Jimmy-Floyd Hasselbaink and Eidur Gudjohnsen appeared on the pitch, promoting the good work carried out by the Samaritans.\n\nThe irony wasn’t lost on me.\n\nEidur and Jimmy were a fine partnership up front for us. My God, how I wished one of them, or even both, could lose twenty years and parachute into the current squad.\n\nI took a photo as they exited the pitch down below me.\n\nThe second-half began. There were no substitutions.\n\nEarly on, Kepa needed to be called into action again, saving well on two occasions. There was a fine diagonal out to Ben Chilwell down below us but although he advanced well, his shot was weak.\n\nChalobah raked the shin of a Brighton player and was booked. This elicited the humorous response from Brighton : “You dirty northern bastards.”\n\nOur play just wasn’t joined up.\n\nOn fifty-seven minutes, a quadruple change.\n\nReece James for Fofana.\n\nHakim Ziyech for Pulisic.\n\nMateo Kovacic for Enzo.\n\nJoao Felix for Sterling.\n\nI was only disappointed with the Enzo substitution, but I suspected that the Argentinian was being saved for Tuesday against Real Madrid. Still four at the back.\n\nThis new injection of players seemed to wake the crowd up from our collective slumber.\n\n“CAM ON CHOWLSEA. CAM ON CHOWLSEA. CAM ON CHOWLSEA. CAM ON CHOWLSEA.”\n\nAt last I joined in.\n\nMy poor performance had mirrored that of virtually all of the players.\n\nJust after, there was a mix-up between James and Chalobah on our right and we were pickpocketed. Julio Enciso’s shot slammed against a post but Welbeck could not touch home the rebound.\n\nIt was all Brighton. All the tackles. All the movement. All the passing. We were being given a horrible lesson in team work.\n\nPD chirped : “I’ve got Samaritans on speed dial.”\n\nWith sixty-five minutes gone, at last we perked up a little. A shot from Kovacic was blocked by that man Dunk. At long last, the noise boomed around a sunny Stamford Bridge and it was a joy to hear.\n\nHowever, all this was to be deadened. On sixty-nine minutes, a wonder strike from Enciso gave the visitors an absolutely deserved lead. We had given the ball away cheaply and the resultant rising shot was magnificent.\n\nBrighton had never won at Stamford Bridge before. The scorer celebrated in front of their supporters. I strongly suspected that this would be their first victory.\n\nA few minutes later, Mason Mount replaced Zakaria.\n\nI turned to Clive : “you wouldn’t even know he was playing would you?”\n\nOn seventy-eight minutes, an enlivened Mudryk broke away and reached the bye-line but appeared to play the ball too far behind our attackers. The low ball found Mount but he leaned back and the ball flew high over the bar.\n\nNeat interplay allowed Gallagher – out best outfield player – to wriggle in to the box but he couldn’t get his shot away.\n\nReece drilled in a beautiful cross into the six-yard box but sadly Jimmy-Floyd Hasselbaink was nowhere to be seen.\n\nIn the last minute, Mudryk cut in and sent a riser just over. To be fair, he had shown very occasional glimpses throughout the game. I haven’t given up on him just yet.\n\nThe away fans were the only ones singing now.\n\n“We are Brighton, super Brighton. We are Brighton from the south.”\n\nAt the final whistle, boos.\n\nThis was yet another tough watch and it seemed that virtually all of our games this season – Tuchel, Potter, Lampard – have been a tough watch.\n\nI didn’t know whether to laugh or cry about the club’s choice to play “Three Little Birds” as we trudged out. Better than the fucking Foo Fighters, I suppose.\n\nSo, were there any pluses from the day? Kepa had played well, saving us on many occasions. But this was a rare positive. If he was a 7, maybe Gallagher was a 6, maybe Mudryk a 5, with everyone else 4 or less. It was grim. And by the time I had reached home – early, at 8.30pm – the internet was full of supporters getting off on ripping into Lampard – some were actually enjoying it as far as I could see – while some were talking about boycotting the remaining games. I honestly didn’t know what to make of it.\n\nIn the midst of this gloom, I saw that Tottenham lost at home to Bournemouth, so that raised a smile..\n\nFrome won 2-0 in front of another gate of 491. It had meant that the club had enticed 1,407 into three home games over just six days; a fine achievement. While Chelsea play Real Madrid on Tuesday, Frome will visit already promoted Totton.\n\nDon’t worry, I will be at Stamford Bridge.\n\nBring a hard hat. See you there.\n\n1982/83 & 2022/23\n\nChelsea vs. Everton : 18 March 2023.\n\nOne of the markers that I use to gauge the progress of the year lies in the hedgerow opposite my house. A month or so ago, snowdrops appeared, blossomed and then slowly vanished. Recently, they shared the space with some newly-arrived daffodils which are now in full bloom. A few days ago, there were no more snowdrops left – only the stunning yellow blossoms remained – and in my eyes, winter had ended and spring was here.\n\nSpring has been a winning season for us in fifteen of the past twenty-five years. It’s the business end of the football campaign. It’s when we, with amazing regularity, have gone to work.\n\nBut this one might be a little different. With domestic honours an impossibility in 2022/23, our only hope for silverware lies in Europe, but we were given a hideously difficult path to the final in Istanbul. First up, a tie with Real Madrid for the third season in a row. Unfortunately, I will only be able to attend the home leg as others in the office have already booked that Easter week as holiday. The same thing happened last year. It is grimly ironic that we chased a trip to the Bernabeu for years and have now drawn Real Madrid three times in a row, yet on all three occasions, I won’t be in attendance.\n\nBernabeu has become my new San Siro. One day I’ll get there.\n\nShould we defeat Real Madrid, we then have to play Manchester City or Bayern Munich.\n\nYeah, I know.\n\nWith the kick-off for our home game with Everton at 5.30pm there was a relatively late start to the day. However, by 9.30am all of my fellow passengers had been collected and I then set off on our latest pilgrimage to London. At midday PD and Parky were settling down for an afternoon of lager and large laughs in “The Eight Bells” and I joined them at around 1.45pm. I had met up with my friend Bill from just outside Toronto at Stamford Bridge and by the time we arrived, our friends Diana and Ian, from Chicago, were already sat alongside PD, Parky and Salisbury Steve. Rene from Chicago, who I had not previously met, joined us too.\n\nA table for eight at the Eight Bells.\n\nWe chatted about all sorts.\n\nBill told me that he felt that he already knew PD and Parky, through reading these rambles over the years, and was actually quite excited to be eventually meeting them for the first time. You can imagine my response.\n\nI was amazed how easy it was for Diana – an Everton fan – to get a ticket for the away section. Her husband Ian and Bill would be sat together in the West Lower after I managed to secure tickets for them both via a reliable source.\n\nRene would be sat in the West Lower too.\n\nThe chat continued. I hadn’t been feeling great, though, for a few days. I had been suffering with a cold. As I chatted away to the friends from near and far I could feel my sore throat beginning again. I felt a bit groggy too. I hoped the players were in better nick than me.\n\nI was able to personally thank Bill, at last, for helping me to obtain a ticket for the incredible Racing vs. Independiente derby that I witnessed over in Buenos Aires in February 2020. This feat of kindness came about when a friend of his, Victor – as featured a few weeks back – who he played football with in West Virginia a decade or so ago, was contacted and within an hour, I was sorted. I sent a photo of us to Victor, who lives just a few blocks from Enzo’s former home El Monumental, and eagerly await the opportunity to be able to return the flavour when Victor comes over to London in hopefully the near future.\n\nIronically, the bloke who I secured the two tickets from for Bill and Ian is currently in Buenos Aires himself on a football jolly.\n\nIt had been raining on the drive to London. Now, leaving the pub, the sun was out. However, walking up the steps to the platform at Putney Bridge, I suddenly felt knackered. At least the weather was mild. I was rough, but if it had been a freezing day, I would have felt even worse.\n\nI reached my seat and still felt below par. I had a feeling that I wouldn’t be strongly participating in this one.\n\nThe team?\n\nKepa\n\nFofana – Kouilbaly – Badiashile\n\nJames – Enzo – Kovacic – Chilwell\n\nFelix – Havertz – Pulisic\n\nThe presence of Christian Pulisic surprised me. Surely Mykhailo Mudryk needed games more.\n\nSo, the McNally Derby.\n\nChelsea in blue / blue / white.\n\nIan in the West Lower.\n\nEverton in pink / grey / pink.\n\nDiana in the Shed Upper.\n\nThe game began with us fizzing the ball around nicely. I must admit it did feel odd for us to be attacking the Matthew Harding in the first-half. A half volley from Enzo was blocked. Not long after, a Ben Chilwell free-kick was worked to Mateo Kovacic who unleashed a volley that everyone in our section of the stand thought was goal bound. It whizzed just past the far post.\n\nWe dominated the first ten minutes almost completely.\n\nBut the atmosphere wasn’t particularly loud, nor even above average.\n\nThere was a “if you know your history” from the Evertonians every few minutes but that was about it.\n\nKalidou Koulibaly over hit a diagonal out to Pulisic to such an extent that I wondered if he had put his boots on the wrong feet. At least Pulisic looked full of running. Enzo looks a proper footballer doesn’t he?\n\nThere was a swift break that flew through the Everton defence but we were unable to finish. Kai Havertz was starting to come to life. On twenty minutes, undoubtedly the best move of the match took place down below me with great passing involving Reece James, Enzo, Havertz and Joao Felix but a lunging Pulisic was just unable to toe-poke a finish past Jordan Pickford.\n\nWithin quick succession, we purred at two pieces of sublime skill from Felix. Firstly, he showed complete calm and unerring presence of mind to contort his body to keep the ball from going out for an Everton throw-in down to my right. Next, a phenomenal spin into space after a remarkable first touch that left his marker consulting a “London A to Z” for his current whereabouts.\n\nIt was Zola-esque.\n\nMagnificent stuff.\n\nOn the half-hour, I heard The Shed for the first real time.\n\nNext up, a nice move but a weak effort from Felix right at the ‘keeper. On forty minutes, a terrible waste of a cross from Pulisic. His star had faded already.\n\nThings were a bit edgier now, and although Everton had hardly mustered more than a couple of attacks on our goal in the entire length of the first-half, the support around me definitely became more nervous. There was desperate defending at times – much of the defending involving Koulibaly by definition looks desperate – and we were grateful, I think, that the first-half was nearing completion. In the last few minutes of the half, the only sound to be heard in the Matthew Harding Upper was that of plastic seats being flipped back.\n\nOne last free-kick, well-worked, a dummy, something from the training ground, but the eventual shot from Enzo did not bother Pickford one iota.\n\nAt the break, I grimly predicted a 0-0 draw at full-time. It’s not that we had played badly – far from it – but our lack of firepower in and around the box was haunting us yet again. I was still feeling rough and had not really joined in too many songs and chants in support of the boys.\n\nI sat myself down alongside PD – Alan was unable to make it, Clive had shifted over to sit with Gary – and prepared myself for another half of attrition against a bleak but regimented Sean Dyche team.\n\nStraight away we were on the attack. A couple of crosses were zipped over from our left with Chilwell having a fine game, and Havertz should have buried the second one with a virtually free header.\n\nEight minutes into the second-period, Enzo floated the ball perfectly out to our left wing-back. A first-time cross from Chilwell was not cleared and the ball reached Felix slightly to the left of the penalty spot. I looked on and hoped for the best as he dug a shot out. Miraculously, the ball was struck with such accuracy that it slowly crept just inside the far post.\n\nThe Toffees were becoming unstuck, as was my recent score prediction.\n\nChelsea 1 Everton 0.\n\nThe players cuddled underneath the TV screen and in front of the away fans in the far corner of The Shed.\n\nAt last some noise.\n\n“He came from Portugal.”\n\nAnd then a rousing “Carefree” – seemingly – from all four stands.\n\nI joined in, coughed and spluttered, and soon stopped.\n\nArguably the best move of the game soon followed when a cute back-heeled pass from Felix set up Pulisic in a nice little pocket of space. He lifted a fine shot into the goal – similar to the Havertz disallowed goal against Dortmund – but the flag was raised for an offside. Ian and Bill must have got a good view of that decision.\n\n“We need a second, Paul.”\n\n“Yep.”\n\n“A goal there would have killed them off.”\n\nThe prize for this win, with Fulham playing in the FA Cup this weekend, would be a step up to ninth position.\n\nIn the pub, Bill and I had laughed about the varying expectations of us Chelsea fans over the years.\n\n“Back in 1983, we would have craved a safe ninth spot in the top division.”\n\nAh 1983.\n\nForty years ago, my mind was full of school discos and terrible “Mock A Level” results but it was also full of Chelsea’s nosedive down the Second Division table. The next game to be featured in my look back on the dreadful 1983/83 season, which took place on Saturday 12 March 1983, paired us against Carlisle United at Stamford Bridge. In the pre-amble in the match programme the game was described as a “six pointer as we skirt with the relegation zone.” I had predicted a bare 6,000 to show up at The Bridge. Both teams were mired in the bottom nine positions of the table with Chelsea just two points above the visitors. These were grave times.\n\nThe team’s two managers were both from the North-East; John Neal from Seaham in County Durham and Bob Stokoe from Hartlepool. Their two teams were now embroiled in a fight to avoid the drop. I mention these two fine fellows because, at the time, I was only seventeen and yet Stokoe and Neal, gentleman managers in every sense of the word, seemed decidedly ancient at fifty-two and fifty years of age.\n\nAnd yet here I am, pushing fifty-eight.\n\nThere is no punchline here. And if there was, it wouldn’t be very funny.\n\nAt the time, Chelsea’s home record wasn’t too bad – 7 – 5 – 2, promotion form – but it was our away record – 2 – 3 – 11, relegation form – that was the root cause of our troubles.\n\nA notable change saw our regular ‘keeper, the eighteen-year-old Steve Francis, being replaced by Bob Iles, a signing from non-league Weymouth a few years earlier. Despite going a goal down, Chelsea lead 2-1 at the break and we went on to win 4-2 The goal scorers were Paul Canoville with two, John Bumstead and Clive Walker. The gate was 6,667.\n\nOn the same day, Everton played at Old Trafford against Manchester United in front of a huge 58,198 gate in the FA Cup quarter finals with a Frank Stapleton goal giving the home team a narrow 1-0 win.\n\nBack to 2023, and – I could hardly believe my ears – there was a strange sound emanating from the very upper echelons of the West Stand.\n\n“Oh when the Blues…oh when the Blues…go steaming in…go steaming in.”\n\nFackinell.\n\nJust after the hour, Conor Gallagher replaced Pulisic.\n\nThere was another scooped ball from Enzo. He is quickly becoming my favourite in this new assortment of players that we now find ourselves supporting.\n\nEverton attacked. There was a free-kick from their right that caused nervousness. Then from a corner on the far side, a ball was floated in and James Tarlowski rose above Wesley Fofana, otherwise enjoying a fine game, and headed the ball down towards Kepa. Abdoulaye Doucore nipped in to flick the ball in. Havertz hooked the ball away but it was a clear goal. The buggers were level and they celebrated wildly down below me.\n\nWe got going again. There was a clean break down our right and Fofana found James. His ball inside enabled Felix to continue the move. The ball was played back to James, entering the danger zone for Everton, and as he galloped on, he came crashing down after a coming together of bodies.\n\nPenalty.\n\nI felt so rough that I just sat in my seat.\n\nPD was up celebrating and he looked down on me with a look of disbelief.\n\nMore hesitancy on the run up from Havertz.\n\n…oh bloody hell man.\n\nThankfully the soft shoe shuffle sent Pickford to the left and the ball was struck high to the right.\n\nChelsea 2 Everton 1.\n\nSafe?\n\nYou would hope so, eh?\n\nThere was a loud and passionate chant for Gianluca Vialli and despite my sore throat, I had to show some respect and join in.\n\n“VIALLI! VIALLI! VIALLI! VIALLI!”\n\nWith around ten minutes to go, our manager could not resist some typical pottering.\n\nKovacic, forging a decent partnership with Enzo of late, was hoiked off in favour of Ruben Loftus-Cheek and I felt a little murmur of concern.\n\nEverton came at us again. A mistake from Koulibaly thankfully went unpunished.\n\nWith five minutes to go, two more substitutions and my head struggled to fathom it all out.\n\nTrevoh Chalobah for Forfana.\n\nCarney Chukwuemeka for Felix.\n\nPD, his hip hurting, and needing a long time to walk back to the car, set off.\n\n“See you soon mate. Here are the car keys.”\n\nThe game was very almost over.\n\nThen, an Everton break down our right and Doucoure played in Ellis Simms, who still had a lot to do. Sadly, he breezed past a sadly immobile Koulibaly and slotted home with far too much ease.\n\nOh Kepa.\n\nIt was a terrible sucker punch.\n\nThe buggers celebrated in our faces again.\n\nWhen Havertz had scored what we thought was our deserved winner, flags of many colours were waved enthusiastically in front of the West Lower and “equality” was observed on a few of them. Maybe our players had taken the word far too literally.\n\nFive minutes of extra time were announced.\n\nI shouted out : “Come on Chels, keep going.”\n\nAlmost immediately after, a bloke behind me repeated the exact same words.\n\n“Come on Chels, keep going.”\n\nIt wasn’t to be. This was an evening when we flattered to deceive yet again. We will have to make it our new slogan.\n\nNext up, a kick-off at the same time and in the same place, but not for a while.\n\nIn a fortnight we play Aston Villa at home.\n\nSee you there.\n\nLiverpool vs. Chelsea : 21 January 2023.\n\nI think that I am going to enjoy writing this one.\n\nGoing into our match at Anfield, there was much gallows humour about this being a mid-table clash, a battle for ninth position, and that some fancied our chances because “they are bloody worse than we are”. It must surely be a while since Liverpool and Chelsea have occupied such lowly positions ahead of a league encounter.\n\nThere was a nice little bit of symmetry ahead of the game; our first match this season was at Goodison against Everton and the match at Anfield would be our twentieth. Therefore, both halves of the current campaign would commence on Merseyside.\n\nI was up early. The alarm sounded at 4.30am and after de-frosting the car and picking up a couple of tinned coffees for the journey at a local garage, I collected PD and then Glenn at 6am, and Lord Parky bang on 6.30am as planned.\n\nWe were full of talk about the club for the first half-an-hour, with Glenn bemoaning many in the media, both social and unsocial, for calling our new buying policy “scattergun” and with me being foolish enough to admit the fact that I fancied a win later in the day.\n\nWe stopped at Strensham on the M5 for a quick breakfast between 7.40am and 8am, and I then made a bee-line for Merseyside. As I slowed down to a halt to wait for a green light to turn onto Queens Drive, we spotted “The Rocket” pub to our left; the very pub where hundreds of Scousers had been stranded ahead of the Champions League Final in Paris last May, the victims of a prank by playful Evertonians.\n\nAt this moment, amidst a little side-chat about the merits of managers Thomas Tuchel and Graham Potter, and how fans have moaned about both, I summed things up as succinctly as I have ever done.\n\n“Well, we’ve been going through a rebuild since Conte left. And since then, we have won the Europa League, the Champions League and are current World Champions. That’s not a bad rebuilding stage, is it?”\n\nI was half-tempted to drive past the new Everton stadium at Bramley Moore Dock to check on its considerable progress since I visited the site in August, but we just wanted to get parked up and into Anfield. The five months that have elapsed since game one in August seemed like five minutes. I was parked up outside the away turnstiles at Goodison Park just after 10.30am; the price had increased from £10 in 2021 to £15 in 2023. Outside, the winter weather was biting hard. We headed off up the gentle slope to the top of Stanley Park with parts still touched by frost. The extension to the Anfield Road end, where we would be stationed, dominated my focus.\n\nIt was eleven o’clock. Just right. While I waited outside for a while to hand over a spare ticket, the others marched inside. Two Liverpool team buses appeared from my right and were then swallowed up by the huge shutter doors beneath the gigantic new stand. Mobile phones were held aloft by the hundreds of Liverpool fans. This must be a regular occurrence, part of the Anfield routine. But there was no real buzz about the place. Times must be hard at both ends of Stanley Park these days. Since my last visit, a mural of Ian Rush had been painted on the end wall of some terraced houses. There were voices and accents from everywhere.\n\nThe weather was tough. I have never seen so many North Face jackets and bobble-less hats.\n\nI chatted to many fellow Chelsea fans.\n\n“They are shite. They’re worse than us.”\n\n“Yeah, I fancy us today, God knows why.”\n\nKim arrived and I handed her a ticket. At the security checks, I had the usual little panic that my camera would be shown the red card but the seemingly short-sighted security guard just frisked me without spotting the camera bag draped over my shoulder.\n\nIn.\n\nI checked my ticket but soon spotted that I had mistakenly ended up with the ticket intended for Kim in row 20. Not to worry, Kim would be with Parky, John, Al and Gal down in row 7. Not a problem. There were only fifteen minutes to go so there was no time to waste. As I edged through the tight concourse, I was aware of a new song being enthusiastically chanted by the younger element.\n\n…”said to me.”\n\nI entered the familiar away end and my spot was in line with the touchline in front of the main stand, not as far jammed into the corner as I had feared. This was my twenty-sixth visit to Anfield, level-pegging with visits to Old Trafford; only five Chelsea wins at each venue, though. That pre-match hope for a win suddenly seemed unlikely.\n\nThere was rail-standing in the away quadrant now. Of all places, standing at Anfield. I never thought I would see it.\n\nI once stood on the old Kop, though, and this was way different.\n\nJoe Cole, Steven Gerrard and Rio Ferdinand took part in pitch-side interviews. Joey was serenaded. And so was Gerrard. As he walked past us – he must have dreaded that – he momentarily cupped his hands over his ears.\n\nThe usual pre-match ritual at Anfield.\n\nFlags on poles, banners, huge crowd-surfing mosaics, the teams, mascots, the PA announcer with ridiculously low voice, The Kop waiting for “You’ll Never Walk Alone” and scarves held aloft.\n\nI remembered my first visit in April 1985 when a big pot of Crown Paint used to take pride of place on the centre spot.\n\nNoticeably, I spotted the highest concentration of scarves in the lower corners of the main stand and the Centenary Stand – née Kemlyn Road – where those Rangers fans congregated in November 1985.\n\nOur team?\n\nI tried, again, to work it all out.\n\nKepa in goal.\n\nA back four of Cucarella, Badiashile, Silva and Chalobah.\n\nLewis Hall was tucked into midfield, somewhere, maybe just alongside Jorginho.\n\nA three of Mount on the left, Gallagher in the middle, Ziyech wide right.\n\nKai Havertz up top.\n\nLiverpool’s team involved players such as Gakpo and Bajcetic, and these two were completely unfamiliar to me. They reminded me of the final hopeless selection of letters in a game of “Scrabble”\n\nHere we were. At the football again. Waiting to see Chelsea again. Everyone together, the lucky ones, the lucky three-thousand. This meant that I was thankfully able to avoid the unappetising avalanche of buzzwords that the TV folk habitually, and without any self-awareness, foist on our poor ears.\n\n“The press”, “transition”, “between the lines”, “little pockets”, “overload”, “high press”, “low block”, it goes on and on, like a relentless deluge of shite. On a recent “MOTD2” I am sure I heard Danny Murphy mention “overload” three times in ten seconds without the merest hint of irony.\n\nFuck adventures in TV Land.\n\nWe were at the football.\n\n“Into them Chelsea.”\n\nAs the game kicked-off, no surprises us attacking The Kop, four spaces to my left were unfilled. Not long into the match, four young lads sidled in. Up in front of The Kop, my eyes straining in the mist, a corner came over from Conor Gallagher and in the resulting melee we gasped as the ball was thwacked against the left-hand post. A leg prodded the rebound home, the net gently rippling.\n\n“GET IN.”\n\nNow then dear reader, there have certainly been tough moments in my recent history when I have questioned my devotion to the cause, especially in the post-COVID era, and I have publicly shared my concerns about me losing the passion for football and maybe even Chelsea. So I am so pleased to report that at 12.33pm on Saturday 21 January in the Anfield Road Stand, there was no ambivalence nor doubt. I, like the thousands around me, was going fucking doolally.\n\nMy celebration of choice on this occasion was a Stuart Pearson fist pump, but a double one for good measure.\n\nI turned to the lads to my left…”great timing.”\n\nAlas, we then suffered that horrible delay that these days suggests that VAR was about to rear its ugly ahead once again.\n\nWhen the goal was disallowed, Mr. Deep Voice on the PA mumbled something incomprehensible. There was no follow-up explanation on the screens. Unlike those in TV Land, I was left to ponder the mystery of why the goal was disallowed.\n\nModern football.\n\nUnlike in our last visit in August 2021, there would be no Anfield goal for Kai Havertz this time.\n\nBoth teams started brightly enough, and Liverpool started to attack. I could hardly believe that James Fucking Milner was starting for them. Gakpo fired over. On a quarter of an hour, things were even.\n\nWe then hit a decent spell. There were a couple of lovely long bombs from Thiago Silva towards Kai Havertz, one slightly over hit, another better, but a slip from Mount when free. Havertz then played in Hall, but his shot from an angle was wild. There was a lovely cushioned lay-off from Havertz, a lot more physical in this game, for Gallagher. This was good stuff, or at least, better than we had been used to.\n\n“VIALLI! VIALLI! VIALLI! VIALLI! VIALLI! VIALLI! VIALLI! VIALLI!”\n\nLet’s sing that all season.\n\nThe home crowd was so quiet, easily the quietest that I had ever witne"
