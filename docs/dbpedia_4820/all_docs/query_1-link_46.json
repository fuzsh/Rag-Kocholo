        "text": "Hereford United ran out thoroughly deserved winners in tonight’s Edgar Street encounter with table topping Bournemouth. Marc Pugh notched a brace with Fletcher replying as the home side produced arguably their best performance of season to outplay the frontrunners.\n\nManager Trewick largely retained faith in the team that had lost at Rochdale with the only change being the inclusion of Keith Lowe to replace the suspended Ryan Green at right back.\n\nThe South-Coasters kicked off attacking the Meadowend and showed their early intent with a series of lofted balls towards the giant but clumbersome Fletcher. An early cross from the fleet-footed Liam Feeley was dealt with by Lowe who chested back to Bartlett while at the other end; James Walker’s effort missed the target to the left. Another Feeley cross was met by a Brett Pitman header but again it sailed wide of Bartlett’s goal. Ten minutes into the game, The Bulls produced the best of the game so far instigated by Kenny Lunt who fed Pugh. The dangerous winger played a one-two with James Walker before testing Shwan Jalal in the visitor’s goal with an on target shot. Bournemouth’s direct play was more than matched by Hereford’s more scientific approach as The Bulls started to show signs of what was to come. Deputising fullback Lowe sent searching ball forward to the marauding Walker forcing a hacked clearance as loanee Craig King worked tirelessly to create options and space. Marc Pugh received the ball from Valentine deep in his own half and set off on a mazy run, which ended with an effort that was beaten away by Jalal.\n\nMeanwhile, a flicked header from Fletcher found Pitman just 10 yards from goal but the striker blazed over as Bartlett was quickly out to narrow the angle. Lunt delivered a telling free kick into the box, which Marshall hit just over the bar before The Cherries broke down the right. Feeley fed Pitman who had drifted wide but Ryan Valentine’s swift challenge cleared the threat although he collected a viscous elbow in the mouth which went unnoticed despite the assistant being just 15 yards from the incident. As the first period drew to a close, a Marshall/Walker combination produced another on target attempt as The Bulls finished the far superior outfit.\n\nHT HUFC 0 Bournemouth 0\n\nWith the second period having been the downfall in recent games, the remaining 45 minutes was to provide some of the best football seen from the home side this season. Marc Pugh skipped passed his marker to deliver a low cross that was fractionally too close to Jalal as Walker closed on goal. Shortly afterwards, Hereford took the lead. The industrious Craig King picked up the ball wide on the halfway line and covered fully 35 yards leaving players in his wake before slipping it through to Pugh who’s cross shot found the net passed the floundering Jalal.\n\nCraig King was running riot with his all-action style providing much of what has been missing during the early season reverses. As The Bulls continued to dictate, even Ryan Valentine forced a block from Jalal following neat interplay with King. Pugh and Marshall continued to torment down the flanks and Kenny Lunt produced a thunderous shot, which whistled passed the post, but Bournemouth replied through Fletcher who managed to roll his marker before firing in on the hour. The Bulls needed to show improved character to avoid a repeat of their previous second half collapses. However, the fans were not to be disappointed this time as the hosts continued to impose their much-improved passing game on the visiting beach boys. King was unlucky as his movement and tenacity produced a chance that cannoned off the keeper’s knees while at the other end, Dennehy, who had replaced Blanchett, conceded a needless free kick to Alan Connell but the free kick was easily dealt by the efficient Bartlett. King then combined with Lunt to produce another effort which was just wide before Lunt’s superb cross-field ball found Pugh who again tested the keeper. Then with 13 minutes left on the clock, another flowing move developed through midfield ending with King providing Marc Pugh with a ball that the winger again slid passed Jalal to push The Bulls towards the three points.\n\nThe Bulls were playing by far the better football with some fine passing movements whereas Bournemouth continued to lump the ball forward to the giant Fletcher who on this performance might be better employed giving rides to children on the beach.\n\nFT HUFC 2 Bournemouth 1\n\nIf this sort of performance and effort is repeated in the coming weeks, fans can expect to see Hereford pulling away from the danger zone. We, at last, appear to have a forward line that runs for 90 minutes and chases back to help out in midfield. Sam Gwynne has added steel to the central area while the much-maligned Kenny Lunt had his best game to date. After a nervous start, the defence in the main dealt competently with the aerial bombardment while Bartlett gave another assured display. The front pairing were a constant threat with Craig King giving a Man-of-The-Match performance.\n\nAttendance 2103 with 431 from the seaside.\n\nHereford: - Bartlett, Lowe, Jones, Blanchett (Dennehy, 66), Valentine; Marshall, Gwynne, Lunt, Pugh; Walker, King. Unused Subs: Adamson, Lowe, Sonko, Done, Constantine, McCallum.\n\nBournemouth: - Jalal, Bradbury (McQuoid, 81), Pearce, Guyett, Cummings; Feeney (Connell, 60), Bartley, Robinson, Hollands; Pitman, Fletcher. Unused Sub: Tindall.\n\nThe Bulls entertain Bournemouth in League Two for the first time since 1982 on Tuesday night.\n\nThe two sides spent six seasons, and met five times in various cups, over a ten year period from the early 1970's, but haven't met in more than 25 years with the Cherries usually in a higher division to the Bulls. On the times the two sides have met the Cherries have won eight of the 17 meetings, with the Bulls winning four. Last time they came to Edgar Street in March 1982 Derek Showers scored for the Bulls but it wasn't enough and the Cherries won 2-1.\n\nThe Bulls collapse at Spotland on Saturday has done little to raise the morale of the supporters, who remain deeply concerned at the start of the season. An indifferent debut from Southend striker James Walker has led fans to call for a debut for unknown quantity Mathieu Manset, while Edrissa Sonko remains without an appearance. The attacking midfielder has sat on the bench for the last two games and will hope to make a debut with the Bulls remaining short on goals.\n\nBournemouth are top of the League. Somehow. Still struggling for money, with a threadbare squad and the taxman's axe still hanging, Eddie Howe has continued his miracle start in the hotseat. He's won 21 of his 34 games and, with a record like that, he'd have walked away with the League Two title last season - and may well do this term if they can get their transfer ban lifted. Brett Pitman has six goals in the League this season, but the Cherries' strength is their defence with only four conceded.\n\nHereford United vs AFC Bournemouth, Edgar Street, 29th September, 7.45pm.\n\nJeremy Waymouth asks for better facilities for disabled Hereford United supporters.\n\nI am still trying to work out if the current situation where the view from the wheelchair section is so restricted is a good thing or a bad thing. On the one hand we can't see one quarter of the pitch so that's 25% less frustration but on the other hand we may miss that \"piece of magic\" that all the supporters will talk about for the following week.\n\nI started going to Edgar Street 6 years ago before I became a wheelchair user. Standing behind the goal in the Meadow End I didn't even see the wheelchair section and never ever gave a thought to the facilties on offer. But even then I knew the ground was poor. I went to the conference semi-final play offs at Aldershot and Stevenage and the grounds were so much better. Even visiting Forest Green showed me what Hereford United was lacking.\n\nThen my MS really took hold of my body and a wheelchair became the order of the day. I will never forget my first match as a wheelchair user. My friend drove us into the Car Park and it's at that point you realise there are no disabled spaces. Spaces for Burger vans, Sky television, the Players etc but none for disabled supporters. At both the Bristol grounds you can ring up and reserve a disabled parking space. And lets face it the car park has more pot holes than Cheddar Gorge! By the time the wheelchair had got from the parking space which I think was located closer to Shrewsbury than Edgar Street I had severe spinal trauma from the gravity sapping potholes and then the boulder like stones littering the carpark. Apparantly Tarmac has become as rare as a home win.\n\nSo we got outside the ground. And now what? Turnstiles are a bit of a bugger to be honest and I am fairly stunned that some of the Cider loving Herefordians get through them due to their width never mind a wheelchair. No signs telling us what to do. How the hell are we as a club going to attract away supporters in wheelchairs when we dont even tell them how to get in the ground and watch their team get the three points?\n\nEventually someone asked the guy manning the turnstiles how to get in. It turns out we have to knock loudly on the white doors and wait for a steward. Well - that's been well thought out! So the club want us to knock on a door where on the other side 2,000 people are singing or whatever. At the best of times it drowns out the P.A. system never mind a geezer rapping on a wooden door 150 ft away. After 5 minutes of hitting the door and knuckles bleeding we are let in. Here I will compliment the club on two things. The ticket price is good value. Secondly, the stewards are incredibly helpful and like all Herefordians I have met really funny and jovial.\n\nSo we go towards the disabled section. Now when I say section I mean that in the loosest sense of the word. It's a paved bit outside the back windows of legends with awning above us. Obviously as the ground is flat it can only be single file viewing unlike a terrace where you are raised above the guy in front. So you travel in front of the people that are already there until the first avaliable blank piece of wall. The chances are that you have now passed through the awning bit so are exposed to the weather and as we all know Edgar Street has a micro-climate like the Phillipines. Tornadoes, monsoons or blinding sun are all frequent visitors.\n\nSo the game kicks off. Hereford attacking towards the Blackfriers End - Pugh takes it up the left wing and beats two and then.................. bloody disappears from sight. He is replaced by a view of the St. Johns ambulance section - none of whom could care less. Then like some kind of weird Sky advert the ball appears into vision arriving in the penalty area completed unaided by anyone. Bizarre! We rely totally on the Meadow End to hear if we have won a corner or not at the Blackfriers End and I have been fortunate enough to see the ball take itself into the bottom corner of the goal - no idea who hit the shot but according to my view it was that fat St. Johns ambulance bloke with the Guinness bottle glasses!\n\nIts half time - fancy a beer - tough! Not sure if I can get into Radfords and even if I can I think it would take years to get to the bar. If we do have a drink then we may need to toilet. This is an experience. Disabled cubicles are in the ladies or gents. Well forget the Gents at half time at the back of Radfords. It's too busy and quite frankly - disgusting. So that leaves the ladies. Now although I am in a wheelchair I am still deeply nervous of enetering ladies toilets. So I knock on the door - nothing! I get in there lock the cubicle door - use the facilties - then a lady enters! I don't want to leave the cubicle in case she thinks I am some kind of mobile pervert - so I have to wait. They take so bloody long! What the hell do they do in there? I heard the jeans unzip and then..............................nothing for what felt like days!!! Eventually she leaves the cubicle and goes to the sink. Now a bloke washes hands - (sometimes) then flicks hands dry and leaves. I dont know what she did but it took weeks. So eventually it's safe to leave. Back to our spot.\n\nSecond half underway - the subs are warming up! Right in front of us. The season we had Trevor Benjamin his arse could block out the entire Meadow end penalty area! Subs tend to follow the ball up and down the touchline so without fail they are in our line of vision competing with the linesman to get in the way. Ocaasionally we can remind a sub of his liking of pies of mildly correct the linesman on yet another dyslexic offside decision. But apart from that its crap.\n\nSo a game can end 4-2 and we have not seen 80% of the build up or goals. We leave only to be confronted by the car park again that I think only Bear Grylls could safely negotiate and leave.\n\nMaybe it wasn't such good value after all.\n\nI dont know if the club read the forums but the one thing that is said time and time again is more supporter participation in the club. Please talk to us! Why can't we have a disabled supporters group? I know so many people who would come if the had an enabler - why can't the club set up a buddy system? Wouldn't it be great if we could liase with other clubs disabled supporters so we can all help each other out? Maybe even meet for a pint? Believe it or not we have opinions as well! In some cases going to the football maybe a wheelchair users only real social contact in a week - I don't think anyone else could understand how inportant that is. So why make it as difficult and unrewarding as possible?\n\nThis afternoon's match report has been written by Terry Goodwin.\n\nTwo late goals and a red card for captain Ryan Green summed up another away day disappointment for Hereford United as they lost 4-1, suffering their biggest League defeat of the season to date.\n\nRochdale were stronger, more organised, and more clinical than the Bulls at a sunny Spotland, and on this performance, they can expect to be among the play-off candidates in League Two this season.\n\nHereford went into the game boosted by last week's 2-0 win over Accrington, and they should take heart by elements of their showing at Spotland. But some weaknesses were exposed by Rochdale, who edged the first half, and grew in stature as the second progressed.\n\nJohn Trewick made one change, loan signing James Walker replacing the departed Marlon Jackson, and at times going forward, the Bulls showed some very good spells. There was an understanding between Sam Gwynne, Walker, Craig King and Mark Marshall which led to some exciting moments, particularly in the first half. Marshall whipped in several telling crosses to signal his intentions, although Rochdale tended to dominate.\n\nWalker tested the Rochdale goalkeeper Kenny Arthur in the early stages, while Will Buckley forced Adam Bartlett into an early save too. Defensively, Hereford were unsure of themselves in the early stages, despite the leadership of Ryan Green, who continued as captain. It's not surprising that the Bulls' players are still learning about each others' games - only five of those starting this match opened the season at Morecambe in August.\n\nHereford pushed on through Craig King, who took a good touch before volleying just wide, but on 19 minutes, Rochdale struck. From the right channel, Gary Jones took the ball past a defender and then fed a low cross to Buckley. His shot was pushed away by Bartlett, but Chris Dagnall fired a low strike into the net to put the home side ahead. Hereford were left short at the back, but Gwynne had been held down in the midfield as Rochdale moved forward.\n\nWithin four minutes, the Bulls were level. Marshall and King linked well, before a low pass found Marc Pugh at the far post. Pugh struck a foot out, enough to get a clean touch, to find the net.\n\nHereford had the opportunity to build on the goal. Pugh fired at the goalkeeper, while Marshall continued to cause problems for Rochdale, and King shot across the face of goal after another decent move forward.\n\nOn the stroke of half time, Rochdale broke away from a Hereford attack. They held the ball up, allowing a swift attack, and the ball was fed through to Simon Whaley who struck home when one-on-one with Bartlett. Despite the setback, the Bulls' players looked relatively upbeat coming off at the break.\n\nRochdale stepped up a gear after the restart, and were positive from the outset. They kept Hereford at bay, and for periods looked content with their single goal advantage. Bartlett was called into action on a couple of occasions, and the best Hereford could muster was a shot on the turn from Walker which went straight into the arms of Arthur.\n\nRyan Green picked up a yellow card for a foul of Dagnall, and Trewick opted to shuffle the pack. Pugh, who had had a quieter second half, was replaced, with Matt Done coming on, but it did little to inspire Hereford.\n\nWith ten minutes left, Rochdale's Tom Kennedy swung in a long corner, and Bartlett saved after a scramble in the six yard box. But his push away fell to Buckley, and he drilled into the roof of the net to make it 3-1.\n\nThree minutes later, another Rochdale corner, and another goal, this time from Craig Dawson. The ball was flicked on in the area, and the unmarked Dawson scored on the turn. It cued chants of \"easy\" from the home fans, and many of the away supporters had seen enough, and headed for the exits.\n\nRochdale looked for a fifth, as O'Grady fired into the side netting, while the increasingly frustrated Gwynne, pictured, was booked after reacting to a challenge from Rochdale defender Tom Wiseman.\n\nThen, two minutes into injury time, there was insult to injury for Hereford. Green pulled back a Rochdale player, picked up a second yellow card, and got the first use of the hot water. He will miss Tuesday's home match against Bournemouth.\n\nThe result means Hereford drop a place to twenty-first.\n\nROCHDALE: Arthur, Wiseman, Tom Kennedy, Stanton, Dawson, Jason Kennedy, Jones, Whaley (Thompson, 77), Buckley, O'Grady, Dagnall. Subs not used: Edwards, Flynn, Rundle, Holness, Spencer, Stephens\n\nHEREFORD: Bartlett, Green, Valentine, Lunt, Pugh (Done, 72), Gwynne, Jones, King, Blanchett, Marshall, Walker. Subs not used: Rose, Lowe, Constantine, Sonko, Adamson, McCallum.\n\nBookings: Jones, Green (x2), Gwynne\n\nATTENDANCE: 2,620 (around 150 away fans)\n\nJohn Trewick spoke to BBC Hereford and Worcester after today's game:\n\n\"I thought giving two goals away before half time give us a lot to do, particularly the manner of the goals. First one we had posession and lost it on the edge of our box, Second one we took a corner in such a hurry with a minute to go before half time. We've talked about these things, we've got to keep clear heads on the football field and understand the state of the game. We were well in the game until then and at 1-1 at half-time who knows.\n\n\"Obviously we tried to rally at half time and stay in the game and make sure we give ourselves a chance as I always thought we had a chance of creating something against them.\n\n\"When the third goal went in that was it. Finished.\"\n\nOn Ryan Green's dismissal, Trewick added: \"He got too tight with the player, the ball was 25 yards away from him and he was right up against him. O'Grady turned him, he's good at that, rolled him round and Ryan got himself into a very bad position. I've got no complaints, it was a yellow card and he's off the pitch. We've got to deal with that.\"\n\nLooking to Tuesday's game with Bournemouth he finished: \"It's a home game. It doesn't matter whether it's a top of the table or bottom side, we've got to look to get a positive result. The players should look at that (Bournemouth's position as leaders) and hopefully they'll be up for it.\"\n\nRochdale V Hereford United\n\nFootball League 2\n\nSaturday 26th September 2009 KO 3.00pm\n\nSpotland\n\nSandy Lane\n\nRochdale\n\nOL11 5DR\n\nPhone 0870 822 1907\n\nRochdale FC was formed in 1907 and eventually played their first League game on 27th August 1921 running out 6-3 winners over Accrington Stanley. Despite spending most of their time in the lower divisions, in 1961/62 they reached the final of the League Cup losing to Norwich City over two legs having beaten Southampton, Doncaster Rovers, Charlton Athletic, York City and Blackburn Rovers along the way. Over the years the Club has suffered many financial problems and has managed a promotion only once during its history which came during the season 1968/69 under the managership of Bob Stokoe.\n\nAll four sides of the Spotland Stadium have been redeveloped in the last ten years making it now one of the best grounds we will visit this season. Away fans are accommodated in the Westrose Leisure Stand (Willbutts Lane) that officially houses 3644 supporters and is the newest of the stands offering unrivalled views of the game.\n\nFacilities beneath the stand include a well-stocked catering kiosk where the pies are claimed to be among the best in the land.\n\nAdmission Adults £20 Concessions £12 (The most expensive Adult seats in the ground!)\n\nHUISA coach departs from Radford’s at 9.30am with a fare of £17. Seats can be booked through the Club office during normal hours or by phoning 08442 761939.\n\nBy Car - M5, M6, M62. Spotland is just over two miles off Junction 20 of the M62 following signs for Rochdale A627M. Bear left at your first opportunity prior to the traffic lights passing B & Q on your right. You will quickly approach a roundabout at which you will pick up the signs for Spotland Stadium directing you to take the second exit. After about two miles you will find the stadium on your right. Street Parking. Postcode OL11 5DR.\n\nTrains - Via Manchester to Rochdale. The Station is about three miles from the ground and therefore a 30/35-minute walk so a taxi may be the answer (approx £7). Alternatively, the 436 bus picks up at the station half hourly on match days (quarter to/past) and drops off in Sandy Lane next to the ground. Please note, the last bus back from Sandy Lane is at 17.10!\n\nPRE-MATCH REFRESHMENTS - Rochdale offers a plethora of Pubs within a five-minute walk of the ground. The Cask and Feather at 1 Oldham Road, was the “brewery tap” for the Thomas McGuinness Brewing Co but following a fire the brewing equipment was sold to the Offa’s Dyke Brewery. It still offers three handpumps usually supplied by Phoenix, Hornbeam and Moorhouse beers. At 35 Toad Lane is The Baum, which has received good reports and has up to five handpumps sporting the likes of Coach House, Phoenix, Slaters and Holts. The local Wetherspoons is the Regal Moon in The Butts which is a converted cinema and any lovers of Hydes beer can find satisfaction at the Merry Monk in College Road. At the ground is Studds Bar, which is accessible from outside the ground while the Ratcliffe Arms is to be found at the car park entrance to the ground in Sandy Lane. Also close to Spotlands are the highly recommended Cemetery Hotel at the traffic lights on the approach to the ground and The Church Inn on the corner of Willbutts Lane. There is a particularly handy chip shop in Willbutts Lane, which is coincidently called the Willbutts Lane Chip Shop.\n\nEnjoy and COYB.\n\nThe Football League has confirmed that 'Help for Heroes' will be its Official Charity Partner for the 2009/10 season. This decision should be especially welcome at Hereford United with its close links with the Armed Forces.\n\nFounded in the summer of 2007, Help for Heroes raises funds for all members of the Armed Forces injured whilst serving their country.\n\nChosen following a vote on the official Football League website, the charity was picked by football fans from five shortlisted candidates.\n\nThe Bobby Moore Fund, Care of Police Survivors, Everyman, Marie Curie and Help for Heroes all went head-to-head in the week-long vote which saw a staggering 25,000 fans nominate their favoured organisation.\n\nThe top two causes were then passed to the League Board who made the final decision to choose Help for Heroes.\n\n\"I am delighted to have Help for Heroes as our Official Charity Partner,\" said Football League Chairman, Lord Mawhinney.\n\n\"The Football League is dedicated to helping good causes and the work done by Help for Heroes is hugely relevant to our lives today.\n\n\"The Football League's unprecedented reach across the UK will assist Help for Heroes to raise awareness, funds and provide Armed Forces with the opportunity to see live matches.\n\n\"Help for Heroes has always been an organisation that I and our clubs have supported in practice and I am thrilled that The Football League is working to help such a great cause.\"\n\nAs the Official Charity Partner, Help for Heroes will have an unrivalled exposure across The Football League, where clubs already have countless initiatives in place supporting the Armed Forces.\n\nThe partnership will add to this passionate work currently underway that includes fund raising and the provision of matchday tickets for members of the Armed Forces and their families throughout England and Wales.\n\nThe Armed Forces will also be honoured at the prestigious Coca-Cola Football League Play-Offs Finals at Wembley with more than 300 troops receiving VIP treatment, including a lap of honour and a stadium-wide standing ovation before kick-off.\n\nHelp for Heroes co-founder, Bryn Parry said: \"Thank you to everyone at The Football League. Your support will make a huge difference to some incredible Heroes.\n\n\"The Football League will help us provide direct and practical support for our injured service personnel. We may not be able to prevent our blokes from being wounded, but together we can help them get better.\n\n\"We wish you all the very best for the upcoming season and look forward to seeing you very soon. Thank you from all at Help for Heroes.\"\n\nThe huge response from fans has encouraged the Board to take the unprecedented step of naming Marie Curie, runner up to Help for Heroes, as the Official Partner for the 2010/11 campaign."
