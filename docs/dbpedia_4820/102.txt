My best memory of Carlisle is from the 1976/77 season when Rovers won 3-2 in Division 2 ( Championship) match. At the time I knew Dave Staniforth‚Äôs brother and he arranged complimentaries to pick up at the ground. When I asked at the entrance a bloke with a beard came out and handed me the tickets so I said thanks Dave. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Graham‚Äù he said and I realized it was Graham Day. What a plonker I was.

That season Rovers were unbeaten in the last seven games and finished 15th with the top three promoted teams being Wolves, Chelsea and Nottingham Forest.

We have played Carlisle United 38 times, W15, D9, L14, Biggest win 5-2, loss 4-0 and all 9 draws have been 0-0 or 1-1...

Carlisle were founded in 1896 as Shaddongate United, are known as the Cumbrians & play at Brunton Park, which holds 17,949..

Manager Paul Simpson is 57 and played most of his football for Man.City, Oxford, Derby, Wolves, Blackpool, Rochdale & Carlisle, also England U18 & U21.

Paul has managed Rochdale, PNE, Shrewsbury, Stockport, England U20 and Carlisle in two spells...

In 2012, market research company FFC surveyed fans of every Football League club across the country to find who they consider their main rivals to be.

Carlisle United fans were unusually shown to consider the more distant Preston North End, Hartlepool United and Middlesbrough as their main rivals.

This is most likely explained by the fact that the survey did not include the option of choosing non-league clubs.

Notable managers have been George Bistow, Fred Emery, Alan Ashman, Bob Stokoe, Mick Wadsworth, Mervyn Day, Greg Abbott, Keith Curle and PAUL SIMPSON...

Carlisle United did get to the 1st division in the 1974-75 season, this remains their only time in the top tier..

Carlisle's record goalscorer is Jimmy McConnell with 126 goals and record appearances is Alan Ross with 466..

Carlisle lie in 21st place, BRFC are 12th in the table, this will be a tough challenge to come away with any points..

Safe trip to travelling Gasheads. Even in the days when I was fanatical, I don't think I ever planned a trip that far north.

I'm fairly sure early in the 2003-2004 season I went away to Carlisle on a supporters club coach. Madness. I was definitely at the game, if not by train. I can't fy those sorts of distances for ninety minutes of football.

Only ever been there once - 2 seasons ago. We lost 1-0 but played really well but just didn't take our chances and were not direct enough in final third. Would have been stopped at half time in our favour if a boxing match. They scored from the only chance they had.

Cumbria is a lovely part of the UK. No doubt some of our fans will sing the moronic ‚Äús**thole‚Äù song

Always liked Paul Simpson, comes across as a very grounded and honest football man, I suppose geographically one of their closest rivals would be Queen of the South, the Dumfries team but unlike Berwick Carlisle have been lucky enough to play in the ‚Äòproper‚Äô league üòú

Have a good mate who's a die hard Carlisle fan. (He flew back to the UK from NZ to go to the play off final last season). He tells me they have a depleted team due to injuries and poor recruitment and couldn't score in a brothel right now. He's predicting 2-0 to us.

He also tells me the 'good news' for Carlise is an American consortium (Wrexham Part II) are taking over at the end of the month and have promised a step change in transfer funding for the January window.

Sounds like now is a good time to be playing them and as long as we go up a couple of gears from Tuesday night we should win this one.

COYB!

I was at that match too Swiss,it was an important game because both clubs needed points to avoid relegation.

Rovers were losing until the last 10 minutes and then scored 3 goals ? anyway the result virtually doomed Carlisle to relegation they need to win their last game at Cardiff (they drew) and some of their supporters were unhappy after the match.

Although Rovers finished 15th with 37 points some of the relegated clubs had 34 points so it was close.

Long way for nothing?

The journey back is sweet?

In between?

Fair play, many of us have made the trawl up there where the welcome is warm.

I remember going up there a few months after those awful floods....the poor souls tied ribbons half way up trees. That was the waterline!

We have a great opportunity to advance today as their off form and personnel down..

Get the first goal and we can settle.

Score whilst on top the key as always.

Gas 2-1.

Maybe Jervani can show something??

Enjoy your game your way and safe travels everyone. UptheGas!

The Stitch2Print Devon & Exeter Football League do not have enough referees for this weekends fixtures and as a result we are without a referee for our second team fixture at home agains City Raiders.

If anyone is available to referee it would be greatly appreciated, you do not need to be qualified but an understanding of the laws of the game is essential

After Reading on Tues (Dire) I couldn't even think of going today but this SOS has made me consider a comeback.78 but unlike some refs at very lower league level I can still run a bit.

Haha! Some refs!?

Was that the most blatant penalty decision not given since the Gibbons handball?

Some things just equal themselves out?

There was a Carlisle v Rovers game that clashed with something else. I think it was a very important England game.

Could have been the one where Beckham scored the late free-kick to equalise and send England to a Finals tournament?

Anyway, there was something like 252 Rovers fans who travelled north, which is a decent figure at any time and amazing in the circumstances.
