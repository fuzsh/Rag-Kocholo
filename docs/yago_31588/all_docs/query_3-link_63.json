        "text": "by Elizabeth Salazar\n\nSIGACT has awarded the 2020 Donald E. Knuth Prize to IQSS faculty affiliate Cynthia Dwork for her impactful work in the field of computer science .\n\nThe Knuth Prize is given annually by the Association for Computing Machinery’s Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT) to an individual who has made “high-impact, seminal contributions to the foundations of computer science” over an extended period of time.\n\nCynthia Dwork, Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science and Radcliffe Alumnae Professor at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, has earned this recognition for her transformative contributions to multiple areas of computer science, including cryptography, data privacy, and distributed systems. Among her many accomplishments is the co-invention of differential privacy, a system which provides mathematical guarantees to protect the privacy of individuals included in a dataset while still making it possible to gain meaningful insight from the data."
