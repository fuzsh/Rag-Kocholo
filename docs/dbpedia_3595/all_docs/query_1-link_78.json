        "text": "byPierre Grande Guerre\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n01 Oct, 2019\n\n‚Ä¢\n\nYear of visit: 2011\n\nThis trip we start at the L√©omont near Vitrimont and we will with some exceptions concentrate on the Battle of Lorraine of August-September 1914 in the area, called, the ‚ÄúTrou√©e de Charmes‚Äù, the Gap of Charmes.\n\nAfter the L√©omont battlefield we continue our explorations to Friscati hill and its N√©cropole Nationale. Next we pay a visit to the battlefield of la Tombe to go on to the Ch√¢teau de Lun√©ville. There we cross the Vezouze to move on southward to the Bayon N√©cropole Nationale. At Bayon we cross the Moselle to pass Charmes for the panorama over the battlefield from the Haut du Mont. North-west of Charmes we will visit the British Military Cemetery containing 1918 war victims. From Charmes we go northward to the battlefield of the First French Victory of the Great War, the Battle of Rozelieures of 25 August 1914. North of Rozelieures we will visit the village of Gerb√©viller. From there we make a jump northward to visit the ruins of Fort de Manonviller to finish with an interesting French Dressing Station bunker, west of Domjevin.\n\nWe start our trip at the battlefield of the height of the L√©omont, north of Vitrimont, east of Nancy, and west of Lun√©ville.\n\nAfter we have parked our car, we are welcomed by this first view of the L√©omont.\n\nAt the same location I am standing with my back to an uninteresting plot of wild vegetation, which conceals the ruins of the Farm of L√©omont. A sign with a period photo tells us about the history of the Farm of L√©omont.\n\nAs we walk up the hill, we get a closer look at this statue of a French Soldier.\n\nThe sculptures of Gaston Broquet\n\nAlthough this is a 1950 copy of Broquet's statue, the sculptor Gaston Broquet deserves some more attention. The sculptures of Gaston Broquet often show soldiers in a realistic battle situation. Gaston Broquet was a famous Lorraine sculptor, and also a war experienced Poilu, a member of the 94th R.I. See also on this website photos of other examples of Broquet's sculptures; of the wounded Sergeant Maginot near Fort de Souville, the horrified Poilu with gasmask of Samogneux, and the remarkable \"Raon-l'Etape Monument aux Morts\".\n\nOn the base of the statue are two interesting bas-reliefs, representing scenes of the battle.\n\nA sign tells us concisely the history of the Battle of L√©omont.\n\nThe spot of Broquet's statue offers a wide panorama, fit for a first acquaintance with this battlefield.\n\nFrom the back of the statue we will first take look westward and north-eastward with four overlapping panorama views. Later on, after a framed intermezzo with more background information, we will continue with panoramas northward and eastward. All panoramas in this photo impression are shown in a clockwise sequence.\n\nWe start with a view at Anthelupt and Dombasle.\n\nAnthelupt.\n\nPanorama view north-eastward, left Nancy.\n\nDuring the last phase of the Battle of Lorraine Nancy formed the main target for Crown Prince Rupprecht von Bayern's 6. Armee.\n\nA teleview to show you how close the Bavarians came to Nancy.\n\nA view of the landscape more north-eastward.\n\nThis hill is one of the locations, which formed together the Trou√©e de Charmes, or the Gap of Charmes.\n\nThe Gap of Charmes\n\nThe ‚ÄúTrou√©e de Charmes‚Äù, or the Gap of Charmes, formed literally a gap in the French defensive lines north-east of the town of Charmes. As you can see on the map above, there were many fortresses around Toul and Epinal in the Vosges. But around Lun√©ville, in the rather open landscape of plains and hills, there was only one fortress, the Fort de Manonviller.\n\nIn this open country there are three natural obstacles, being the rivers Moselle, Vezouze and Meurthe. These last two rivers link together directly west of the city of Lun√©ville.\n\nAny German Army which could break through the Gap of Charmes, would have been awarded with the advantage of three options to facilitate the continuation of its campaign on more accessible terrain: 1. Go right and attack Nancy and Toul, or 2. Go left, and attack St. Di√© and Epinal, or 3. Advance directly to the Champagne.\n\nAnother reason why this weak link in the French defensive line was called the Gap, was the fact that the French 2nd Army linked up here with the 1st Army. During the period of 20 -23 August the flanks of these armies almost lost contact. During the Battle of the Trou√©e des Charmes from 24 until 26 August 1914, it took the French 2nd Army much effort to withstand the German attacks. It even needed the assistance of the 8e Corps d‚ÄôArm√©e of Dubail‚Äôs 1st Army.\n\nThe Battle of Lorraine was fought during a period of mobile warfare with almost daily moving front lines.\n\nBroquet's statue does not show us, alas, the colourful 1914 outfit of the French officers and soldiers.\n\nThis Poilu wears a field cover over his red cap. Light infantry men, Chasseurs √† Pied, wear dark blue trousers and a dark blue cap.\n\nBefore we go on: To understand better this location and the other locations we will visit during this trip, I explain in the frame below some concise background information about the complex situation of the several 1914 battles in the area of the Trou√©e de Charmes.\n\nThe Battles of the Frontiers - The Battle of Lorraine - 14 August - 13 September 1914\n\nThe Battle of the L√©omont was only one of the battles fought during the period of 14 August until 13 September in this region of the Gap of Charmes.\n\nDuring the period of mobile warfare of the Battles of the Frontiers the German Armies advanced in Belgium according to the Schlieffen Plan to Brussels, Namur and Mons. In Alsace-Lorraine Joffre deployed three Armies to execute his Plan XVII, or Plan 17, to win back the territories France had lost to Germany in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871.\n\nThough the Alsace Army was at first rather successful in the Alsace Sundgau, the fighting in Alsace Lorraine and the Northern Vosges did not develop at all according to the French plans for the 1st Army and 2nd Army.\n\nThe Battle of Lorraine - 14 August ‚Äì 13 September 1914\n\nThe French historians call this period of 14 August ‚Äì 13 September 1914 in Lorraine the Battle of Lorraine. It was in fact a sequence of several battles in almost the same area during 4 weeks; the Battle of Morhange, the Battle of the Trou√©e de Charmes, including the Battle of Rozelieures, the Battle of the Mortagne, and the Battle of the Grand Couronn√©, east of Nancy. The Battle of Rozelieures resulted also in the first French victory of the Great War.\n\nSouth of the Trou√©e de Charmes the French 1e Arm√©e of G√©n√©ral Dubail fought during these battles in the Alsace Vosges and G√©n√©ral Bonneau‚Äôs Army of Alsace in the Alsace Sundgau (later G√©n√©ral Pau) against the 7. Armee of General von Heeringen. In the Vosges the 1e Arm√©e would fight another battle, the Battle of the Haute-Meurthe, which lasted from 24 August ‚Äì 11 September.\n\nThe Opponents in Lorraine\n\nIn Lorraine the units of G√©n√©ral de Castelnau‚Äôs 2e Arm√©e fought against the units of the Bavarian 6. Armee, commanded by Kronprinz Rupprecht von Bayern, Crown Prince Rupert of Bavaria.\n\nThe Bavarian opponents were less colourfully dressed than their French enemies, and used a more natural colour.\n\n14‚Äì20 August 1914 - The Battle of Morhange\n\nThe troubles in the Trou√©e de Charmes started on 14 August 1914 with the French attacks on German territory, annexed from France in 1871.\n\nCrown Prince Rupert's mission was to engage the French forces and to keep these fixed in the centre, giving room to the advance of the right wing of the German Army, which as part of the Schlieffen Plan, encircled his opponents in the north-west.\n\nDuring these days the French and Germans deployed each some 150,000 men on the Lorraine battlefields.\n\nThe Bavarian troops proved to be better marksmen than the French, inflicting heavy casualties on the French infantry.\n\nFrom the beginning of the war the town of Morhange was defended by hills, fortified by light military works and artillery batteries and it acquired the nickname \"Wall of Morhange.\" The French armies were stopped at the foot of these hills. They could not break the German resistance and were forced to retreat. For more details, visit later my web chapter about The Battle of Morhange - 1914.\n\n20-23 August 1914 - The French Retreat - \"Die Schlacht in Lothringen\"\n\nAfter six days, on the 20th, the counter attacks of Prince Rupert‚Äôs units forced the 2nd Army to withdraw. Three days later also Dubail‚Äôs 1st Army in the Vosges was forced to withdraw under pressure from von Heeringen‚Äôs 7th Army.\n\nThe Bavarians counterattacked and recaptured Ch√¢teau-Salins, Morhange and Dieuze.\n\nOn 20 August, Crown Prince Rupprecht‚Äôs Bavarians started to hunt the French in their fighting retreat to the Franco-German Border. On 22 August the Bavarians captured Lun√©ville. The Battle of Morhange ended with a German victory.\n\n24 -26 August 1914 - The Battle of the Trou√©e de Charmes\n\nThe 8e Corps d‚ÄôArm√©e was temporarily separated from Dubail‚Äôs 1e Arm√©e and attached to the 2e Arm√©e to serve as its right flank. General de Castelnau‚Äôs units counterattacked in a pincer movement from the east and west the flanks of the 21. Armeekorps. At Clayeures and Romain, north of Bayon , the units of the 74e D.I. stopped the Bavarian advance.\n\nAt St. Boingt the 8e Corps d‚ÄôArm√©e repelled the attack of the Bavarian 1. Armeekorps. G√©n√©ral Fayolle‚Äôs 70e D.I. attacked the units of the Bavarian 2. and 3. Armeekorps with success near the villages of Erb√©viller, R√©m√©r√©ville and Courbesseaux. In all these villages in this area there was fierce hand-to-hand fighting in the streets. That day the French succeeded partly in halting the Bavarian advance.\n\nThe Battle of Rozelieures - France's First Victory\n\nOn 25 August the Battle came to a head at Gerb√©viller and Rozelieures. During the night de Castelnau ordered almost all artillery fire to concentrate on the centre of the battle zone near the village of Rozelieures.\n\nFighting from the early morning on and after a fierce battle of 9 hours the 2e Bataillon des Chasseurs √† Pied of the 6e Groupe de Chasseurs Cyclistes (light infantry on bicycles) and a half squadron of the 1e R√©giment des Hussards (light cavalry) succeeded in forcing the units of the 21 Armeekorps to retreat from the village northward.\n\nAccording to French sources the Bavarians counted on the 25th at least 2,500 men killed and 6,000 other casualties. The Battle of the Trou√©e de Charmes ended as a French victory.\n\nMore details about the Battle of Rozelieures are to be found later on this page.\n\n26-29 August 1914 - The Battle of the Mortagne\n\nThe next day, on the 26th, the Bavarians retreated over the Meurthe and the Mortagne.\n\nOn the location, where we stand now, on the L√©omont near Vitrimont and Lun√©ville, the French Iron Division, the 11e D.I., and especially the unit of the 26e R.I., celebrated that day their own victory over the units of the Bavarian 2. Armeekorps. The 26e R.I. captured the L√©omont and other units of the 11e D.I. captured that day also the nearby height of Friscati, and the villages of Deuxville, Maixe, and Drouville.\n\nThe Capture of Fort de Manonviller\n\nOn 27 August after a continuous artillery bombardment with large calibre shells for two days the Bavarians captured the Fort de Manonviller - by then already totally destroyed. This capture formed for the Germans a most important event. The Crown Prince came to inspect himself the ruins of the fortress.\n\n29 August - 3 September 1914: A short period of rest and reorganization\n\nWith his troops decimated at Morhange and Rozelieures and with a gap to secure for eventual next attacks, de Castelnau decided not to deploy a counter-offensive but to reinforce the lines around Nancy and the lines of the Trou√©e. Rupprecht von Bayern‚Äôs troops counted also heavy losses, especially on the flanks, and he decided to withdraw his Army for a short period of rest and for reorganization.\n\n4‚Äì13 September - The Battle of the Grand Couronn√©\n\nDuring the period 4 - 13 September the north-western area of the Gap, around Lun√©ville and Vitrimont, was again involved in another battle; the Battle of the Grand Couronn√©.\n\nThe Grand Couronn√© formed a defensive line on a series of heights, east of Nancy, including the heights of the L√©omont and Friscati.\n\nOn the heights of the Grand Couronn√©, east of Nancy, De Castelnau placed the 20th Army Corps of Ferdinand Foch to defend the city.\n\nOn 4 September Crown Prince Rupprecht launched a new offensive to conquer Nancy. Rupprecht deployed some 350,000 men, while de Castelnau waited with some 225,000 men.\n\nOn the same day in the west the French Army was preparing for a more famous battle, which would start the next day: the Battle of the Marne.\n\nDuring the battle all villages in the region were destroyed. On 9 and 10 September Nancy suffered an artillery bombardment of two days.\n\nThe German Withdrawal\n\nIn the Vosges von Heeringen‚Äôs Haute-Meurthe Offensive did not reach its goal, the capture of St. Di√©. From 10 September von Heeringen retreated from theCol de la Chapelotte on Saales.\n\nFor the 6th Army the Battle for the Grand Couronn√© was also not successful at all. Under pressure of General's Foch's 20th Army Corps Rupprecht was not able to capture Nancy.\n\nOn 11 September the Oberste Heeres Leitung decided to withdraw Rupprecht‚Äôs 6th Army under cover of artillery fire. The Bavarians left Lun√©ville and retreated from Nancy to the Franco-German border of 1871-1918. At some places they even retreated to locations in front of this border, on French territory. After the German retreat the new frontline of Lorraine consolidated until 1918.\n\nOn 13 September the 2e Arm√©e recaptured Lun√©ville, left by the retreating Germans, without firing a single shot.\n\nThe Battle of the Grand Couronn√© ended with a French victory. (For more details visit later my web chapter about the Battle of the Grand Couronn√©.)\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nIn France the Battle of the Trou√©e de Charmes is not only considered a great victory, but in combination with the Battle of the Meurthe-Mortagne all these consecutive Battles of Lorraine are also considered to be of great importance, having a decisive influence on the outcome of the other more famous battle: the German defeat in the Battle of the Marne.\n\nAfter this intermezzo we return to 2011 and to the view of the statue of the L√©omont.\n\nFrom now we follow the view of the eyes of Broquet's soldier .\n\nWe continue with some clockwise panorama views over the L√©omont battlefield northward and eastward. Perhaps now you will be able to recognize some names of the locations, mentioned in the frame above.\n\nView slightly north-west and north.\n\nView northward at the village of Deuxville.\n\nTeleview of Deuxville.\n\nWe continue and turn north-east and eastward.\n\nView into the direction of a location, called la Tombe, which we will later visit and the Hill of Friscati.\n\nView eastward to the valley, where Lun√©ville is.\n\nA teleview from the L√©omont to Lun√©ville.\n\nWe leave the L√©omont, ...\n\n... and we continue some 1.5 km. eastward to the hill of Friscati.\n\nIn the valley along the D 400 we detect this memorial, ...\n\n... commemorating three units, which were active in this area.\n\nAt this memorial we leave the D 400, we go left, and we follow the D 97 up the hill. At the cemetery building near the junction we park our car.\n\nWe will first visit a small chapel, opposite the cemetery.\n\nView eastward from the chapel to Lun√©ville.\n\nWe cross the D 97 and we enter the Vitrimont - Friscati N√©cropole Nationale.\n\n...this Arch of Triumph, covering a colourful Poilu statue in a 1915-1918 outfit.\n\nThis Poilu, guarding his 1914 comrades in arms, is equipped with the \"Bleu Horizon\" battle dress and the \"Casque Adrian\", the Adrian M 1915 helmet. From February 1915 this light blue outfit, meant as camouflage, was distributed gradually to the French troops.\n\nFrom the arch we descend the slope of the cemetery\n\nThe three large communal graves, from right to left: Ossuary Number 1, ...\n\n... Ossuary Number 2, ...\n\n... Ossuary Number 3.\n\nThe majority of the human remains, buried in these communal graves, belong to unknown soldiers.\n\nThe grave of a member of the 71e Bataillon Chasseurs √† Pied.\n\nThe grave of Zouave soldier of the 1e R√©giment des Zouaves.\n\nZouaves\n\nOriginally, in 1831, the Zouaves were founded and based in Algeria. In 1914 the Zouaves regiments were developed as a mix of Algerian soldiers and a majority of French soldiers. To demonstrate the colourful outfit of these Zouaves, I show you here an original colour period photo of 1914-1915, a so called \"Autochrome\", of a unit of the 3e R√©giment des Zouaves.\n\nThe grave of a Jewish Zouave soldier is sharing the same plot of the graves of his Muslim brothers in arms, fallen in 1917.\n\nLeft: The grave of a Tirailleur of the 3e R√©giment Marocain des Tirailleurs. (Sharp shooters / Riflemen) - Right: The grave of a cavalryman of the 2e R√©giment de Cavalerie Musulman (Second Muslim Cavalry Regiment)\n\nThe grave of a soldier of a light cavalry unit, ...\n\n.... the 1e R√©giment des Hussards, fallen in September 1914.\n\nThe grave of a member with a German sounding name of the unit, the 26e R.I., which captured the L√©omont.\n\nWe ascend the hill for a last view of an interesting memorial, ...\n\n... dedicated to the Moroccan troops, ...\n\n... on the initiative of their former commander, Mar√©chal Lyautey, who was born in Nancy.\n\nWe leave the cemetery.\n\nFrom the road before the cemetery a teleview eastward at Lun√©ville.\n\nWe continue northward to a location, called la Tombe.\n\nOn our way to la Tombe we find in the verge of the road this individual memorial:\n\nOutside the village of Deuxville we arrive at a junction at a location with the ominous name la Tombe (the Grave).\n\nA memorial reminds us of some of the units, who fought in these fields of la Tombe.\n\nFrom the la Tombe Memorial I made some panorama shots of the battlefield northward in 4 overlapping panorama views, clockwise from west to east. The first panorama north-westward is above, the next three will follow below.\n\nView northward.\n\nView north-eastward.\n\nView eastward.\n\nA normal view slightly more eastward.\n\nWe leave the la Tombe battlefield and we continue via the D 70 ...\n\n... southward for a short visit to the city of Lun√©ville.\n\nAfter crossing the Vezouze we visit in the centre of Lun√©ville its impressive Ch√¢teau de Lun√©ville.\n\nLun√©ville; \"City of the Cavalry\"\n\nOn the eve of the Great War, Lun√©ville became the \"City of the Cavalry\", being the garrison city of the 2nd Cavalry Division and its units, amongst others: the 17e et 18e R√©giments de Chasseurs √† Cheval, the 3e Bataillon de Dragons Port√©s (Dragoons), the 8e et 31e R√©giments de Dragons, the horse batteries of the 8e et 39e R√©giments d'Artillerie de Campagne (Field Artillery). To house these units Lun√©ville counted at least 8 barracks, including its Ch√¢teau.\n\nThe 2e Bataillon de Chasseurs √† Pied\n\nThe infantry unit of the 2e Bataillon de Chasseurs √† Pied, a component of the 11e D.I., had its barracks also in Lun√©ville. This unit played a decisive role in the combats in Rozelieures, Remenoville and Gerb√©viller.\n\nIn front of the Ch√¢teau stands this equestrian statue, which has no relation to the Great War at all. But I thought it to be too beautiful to leave it out. The statue represents G√©n√©ral Lasalle.\n\nComte de Lasalle\n\nAntoine Charles Louis Collinet, Comte de Lasalle (Metz, 10 May 1775, ‚Äì Wagram, 6 July 1809) was a French cavalry general during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars known as ‚ÄúThe Hussar General.‚Äù On 5 and 6 July 1809 Lasalle fought at the massive clash of Wagram, Austria, commanding a Light Cavalry Division in the IV Corps of Marshal Mass√©na. On the night of the second day Lasalle‚Äôs men had still not been ordered to fight, so Lasalle went to Marshal Mass√©na to ask permission to pursue the enemy. Mass√©na ordered him to go in aid of General Macdonald. As he rode to General Macdonald‚Äôs support, Lasalle was temporarily separated from his division. He accidentally alerted a battalion of enemy infantry and he charged them with the 1st Cuirassier Regiment.\n\nLasalle was shot in the chest but continued to charge. The Austrian infantry broke and were routed as Lasalle and the 1st Cuirassier Regiment pursued the fleeing Austrian infantry. As he charged, Lasalle was shot between the eyes by an Austrian grenadier and was dead before his body hit the ground.\n\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Charles_Louis_de_Lasalle .\n\nWe leave Lun√©ville, we cross the Meurthe, and we continue southward, passing Lamath to Bayon.\n\nSometimes, when the traffic on the D 9 allowed us to stop safely, ...\n\n... I made some photos of the landscape here.\n\nThis ugly antenna tower is an important landmark to help you not to miss ...\n\n... the Bayon N√©cropole Nationale on the other side of the hill on the west side of the road.\n\nBayon N√©cropole Nationale\n\nAccording to the records the Bayon N√©cropole Nationale contains the human remains of 169 men. I estimate this number as being higher, because the communal graves contain more men than the official records do tell us. There are 100 individual graves and two large communal graves, containing together the human remains of 71 men. There are also several communal graves, marked with a white cross, each containing the human remains of 10 men. The majority of officers and soldiers, buried here, were killed during the Battle of the Grand Couronn√© of September 1914. You will find also here graves of French and Polish soldiers, killed during the Second World War.\n\nOssuary No. 1.\n\nOssuary No. 2.\n\nSome of the communal graves, shared by 10 soldiers.\n\nWe leave the cemetery.\n\nAt the nearby village of Bayon we cross the bridge over the Moselle.\n\nWe continue southward to Charmes, where we pass the centre of the town, to go directly southward, to the Haut du Mont.\n\nAt the Haut du Mont (384 m.) stands this memorial, the \"Monument de Lorraine\".\n\nA sign tells us some information about the inauguration of this memorial to commemorate the Battle of the Trou√©e de Charmes.\n\n‚ÄúMemorial of Lorraine\n\nErected to commemorate the Battle of the Trou√©e de Charmes on 25 August 1914.\n\nHistory: The Lieutenant Ren√© Georges Kimpflin, participator in the battle, was the initiator of it.\n\nThe first stone was laid on 23 August 1925 by G√©n√©ral Curi√®res de Castelnau.\n\nThe first inauguration of the memorial in stone took place on 19 August 1934 by:\n\nM(onsieur) Albert Lebrun, President of the Republic, M. Marshall P√©tain, M. Henry Breton, Mayor of Charmes.\n\nThe second inauguration of the actual memorial took place on 11 November 1968 by: M. Jean Faussemagne, Prefect of the Vosges, M. Paul Legrand, Vice-President of the General Council, M. Marcel Gourmand, Mayor of Charmes.\n\nThis monument is the work of the Nancy architect, Leon Cayotte (1875-1946).\n\nThe actual memorial in reinforced concrete has been realised by the Richard Ducros Company in Charmes.

The cemetery now contains 202 burials and commemorations of the First World War. Three of the burials are unidentified and there is a special memorial to one casualty buried in NEUFCHATEAU Communal Cemetery whose grave could not be found. The cemetery also contains 13 Second World War burials and three war graves of other nationalities.\n\nSource as always: Commonwealth War Graves Commission - http://www.cwgc.org/\n\nThe records do not mention the presence of graves of members of the Indian Labour Corps and the Chinese Labour Corps. The registry of the cemetery itself tells us also about the initiative of the Royal Air Force:\n\nThe headstones of the British R.A.F. airmen are standing almost \"shoulder to shoulder\".\n\nThe Royal Air Force was founded on 1 April 1918 by the amalgation of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS).\n\nThis crew of air mechanics was killed three days before Armistice, on 8 November 1918.\n\nThese two R.A.F. Second Lieutenants fell on 14 May 1918.\n\nThis Lance Corporal of the Royal Irish Fusiliers died after the Armistice. I presume he died after all of his wounds.\n\nInscriptions in Hindi and Urdu on the graves of members of the Indian Labour Corps.\n\nThe Indian Labour Corps\n\n\"The Indian Labour Corps\n\nThe Indian Labour Corps was employed in Mesopotamia from 1916 onwards. When insufficient men volunteered the Indian Government recruited men serving sentences in prisons and created the Indian Jail Labour Corps. Indians continued to be employed in Mesopotamia until the early 1920s.\n\nMen were recruited in India to serve in the Indian Labour Corps in France with the first men arriving in June 1917. Each Indian Princely State and Province recruited their own units, so, on arrival the British found there were varying restrictions on how they could be used. The length of their contracts also varied, some being for twelve months and some the duration of the war.\n\nThere were also problems with officers who had little or no military experience and who had held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, which meant they were too senior to command a labour company.\n\nAlmost 50,000 Indians served in France in the ILC although as labour units they were hampered by illness caused by the cold weather and confusion about their terms of their contract.\"\n\nSource:\"Military Labour During The First World War\" . http://www.labourcorps.co.uk/\n\nIn a small corner along the wall stand four headstones of members of the Chinese Labour Corps.\n\nThe Chinese Labour Corps\n\n\"The Chinese Labour Corps\n\nRecruitment for the Chinese Labour Corpsbegan in China in October 1916 with the first contingent reaching France in April 1917. Almost 100,000 Chinese were to work for the British in France.\n\nAlthough the Officers and N.C.O.s were British their own Gangers gave instructions to the men and were responsible for supervising the work.\n\nA number of skilled companies were formed and coolies could take trade tests, which entitled them to more pay. 51 and 69 Companies, CLC, for example, undertaking skilled work in the Tank Workshops and almost 2,000 Chinese were employed in skilled railway companies on Railway maintenance.\n\nFollowing the Armistice the CLC was to undertake major roles as crane drivers at the docks and in battlefield clearance.\n\nThe Chinese were recruited on a three year contract and this enabled more continuity than other foreign labour who were often recruited for a year or less. In March 1918 the actions of Ganger Liu Dien Chen in rallying his men when they came under shellfire led to him being recommended for the award of a Military Medal. At the time the Chinese were not eligible for any awards but this was changed to allow them to be awarded the Meritorious Service Medal. As a result Liu Dien Chen and four other Chinese were awarded MSMs.\n\nChinese labourers were also recruited for service in Mesopotamia and Northern Russia.\"\n\nSource: \"Military Labour During The First World War\" . http://www.labourcorps.co.uk/\n\nThe two graves of the German Airmen, who also died a few weeks after the Armistice .\n\nA last view over the Charmes Military Cemetery.\n\nVia Damas-aux-Bois and the D 12, switching at St. Boingt to the D 22d, we continue to Rozelieures.\n\nAlong the D 12, between Damas-aux-Bois and St. Boingt, we spot on our right the Haut de la C√¥te (422 m.)\n\nAfter leaving the village of St. Boingt we get our first impression of the Bois de R√©thimont, north-west of the Rozelieures Battlefield.\n\nSome satellite photos of the Rozelieures battlefield.\n\nBecause we are running late on our planned schedule, we have to skip a visit to the Rozelieures N√©cropole Nationale. Of course I still made an overall photo of it.\n\nN√©cropole Nationale de Rozelieures\n\nThe N√©cropole Nationale de Rozelieures contains the human remains of 1,154 men. There are 239 individual graves and several communal graves, containing together the human remains of 915 men. The officers and soldiers, buried here, were all killed here in these fields during the Battle of Rozelieures on 25 August 1914.\n\nAs the cemetery is located almost in the centre of the battlefield, ...\n\n... I made a landscape photo of the battlefield, from the entrance of the Rozelieures Cemetery. Left the edge of the Bois de la l'√âau.\n\nThe village of Rozelieures.\n\nFrom the cemetery we enter the village, in the village we turn left, and just outside the village we stop at a cluster of memorials.\n\nBefore we visit the memorials a concise, but still more detailed, reminder about the Battle of Rozelieures of 25 August 1914.\n\nThe Battle of Rozelieures - 25 August 1914 - France's First Victory\n\nOn 24 August units of the 21. Armeekorps reached Gerb√©villers, Remenoville and Rozelieures. General de Castelnau‚Äôs units counterattacked in a pincer movement from the east and west the flanks of the 21. Armeekorps.\n\nAt St. Boingt the 8e Corps d‚ÄôArm√©e repelled the attack of the units of the Bavarian 3. Infanterie Division, the B.I.R. 17, B.I.R. 22, and the Prussian I.R. 71. But the Bavarian units still succeeded in occupying the village of Rozelieures.\n\nDuring the night of 24-25 August de Castelnau ordered to concentrate almost all artillery fire on the centre of the battle zone near the village of Rozelieures.\n\nIn the morning of 25 August, at 7.00 AM, the 2e Bataillon des Chasseurs √† Pied of the 6e Groupe de Chasseurs Cyclistes (light infantry on bicycles) and a half squadron of the 1e R√©giment des Hussards (light cavalry) attacked from the northern outskirts of St. Boingt and the Bois de la l‚ÄôEau, south of the village of Rozelieures, entered it and almost captured it.\n\nFrom 8.00 AM the French units received fierce counter-attacks from support units of the 3. B.I.D., advancing from Remenoviller and the Bois de R√©thimont, north of Rozelieures.\n\nThe Chasseurs were driven from the village southward to the Bois de la l‚ÄôEau.\n\nThe Bavarians took advantage of this success and continued to move southward, further into the Gap of Charmes.\n\nDe Castelnau ordered immediately three regiments of the Cavalry Corps to advance from St. Boingt and to reinforce the troops fighting in the wood.\n\nWith the support of the newly arrived cavalry the 2e B.C.P. successfully regrouped. Around 16.00 hrs. they launched in the wood \"with a magnificent elan\" a fierce charge with bayonets at the Bavarians, chasing them out of the wood over the open battlefield, out of the village. Later on that day there followed fierce fighting in the Bois de R√©thimont, south of Remenoviller and further northward, which caused the Bavarians to retreat on the 26th over the Meurthe and the Mortagne.\n\nIn this battle, Lieutenant de Cazenove is distinguished for his bravery and energy. He fell mortally wounded by 4 bullets some 500 metres from this spot at the edge of the Bois de la l'Eau (old spelling: \"Bois dela Lau\"). He wrote in a letter, dated on 17 August: \"Victory is certain and with it the recovery of France, our lives would mean nothing to offer for such a blessing. \"\n\nAccording to French sources the Bavarians counted on the 25th at least 2,500 men killed and 6,000 other casualties.\n\nThe Battle of Rozelieures ended as a French victory and blocked definitely the advance through the Gap of Charmes.\n\nFrom the Battle of Rozelieures memorial, a view south-eastward, over the battlefield to the Revers le Renard hill (301 m).\n\nSome 20 m. futher on, on the northern side of the road, stands the Battle of Lorraine memorial.\n\nIt is dedicated ...\n\nThe memorial shows a map of the battlefields of the large 4 battles, the Battle of Rozelieures, the Battle of the Mortagne, the Battle of the Grand Couronn√©, and the Battle of the Meurthe - Mortagne, here called the Battle of Baccarat - la Chipotte, and it mentions all the units of the 1e and the 2e Arm√©e involved in these battles.\n\nOn the memorial we find three quotations, referring to the decisive influence of these battles on the results of the Battle of the Marne. We have read already two of these quotations at the Monument de Lorraine, Charmes. The third quotation is of the veterans, Isorni & Cadars:\n\nWe turn our back for the next view over the Rozelieures battlefield.\n\nBefore us we see a crucifix and the grave of the war hero, Lieutenant de Cazenove.\n\nOn the base of the crucifix is an inscription with an elaborate, but interesting text.\n\n\"Arnaud de Cazenove, 15 September 1886 ‚Äì 25 August 1914.\n\nLieutenant of the 13e Bataillon de Chasseurs Alpins, Knight of the Legion of Honour, Croix de Guerre. Died being the group commander of the Group of Cyclists of the 6th Cavalry Division (21-08 - 25-08-1914). Cited in the Order of the Division: courageous attitude and enthusiastic under fire.\n\nOn 25 August (de Cazenove) found a glorious death leading his light infantry men into the opening of a wood under a fire of extreme violence. (He) fell making the gesture of a leader, who launches his troops against the enemy. Cited in the Order of the Army: Officer of a high moral value. On 21 August 1914 during the night attack of Hertzing he took command of the Group of Cyclists of the 6e D.C. After the death of its commander (taking over also its command) he definitely caused the enemy to flee. On 25 August 1914 he defended brilliantly Rozelieures. The Bois La Lau (old spelling for the modern name of Bois de la l‚ÄôEau) was entrusted to his guard. During all combats, without counting his personal safety, with the most profound contempt for danger, he did his best during the critical moment to gather his light infantry men around him. At the head (of his group) he launched the assault and forced back the enemy, inflicting on him heavy losses. He fell, beaten to death, in the noble fulfilment of his duty.\"\n\nThis period photo of the grave and the village has been taken from the western side of the grave.\n\nLet us have an extra and better look at the panorama, which this spot offers.\n\nThe N√©cropole Nationale, along the D 22d, is located left of the top of the crucifix. The Bois de la l'Eau (Bois dela Lau) is located right at the horizon.\n\nA teleview to the Rozelieures N√©cropole Nationale.\n\nThe Bois de la l'Eau.\n\nWith some period photos in our mind we leave Rozelieures.\n\nVia Remenoville we continue ...\n\nOn the northern bank of the river stands near the bridge this memorial, dedicated to the inhabitants of Gerb√©viller and the 2e Bataillon de Chasseurs √† Pied.\n\n\"IN MEMORY OF THE CHILDREN OF GERBEVILLER, WHO DIED ON THE FIELDS OF HONOUR 1914-1918 AND THE CHASSEURS OF THE 2E B.C.P., DEFENDERS OF THE PASSAGES OVER THE MORTAGNE ON 24 AUGUST 1914\n\n+\n\nGERBEVILLER, GRAND CITY OF LORRAINE, WHICH WAS DURING THE MONTH OF AUGUST 1914 BY REASON OF ITS ADVANCED POSITION ONE OF THE FIRST VICTIMS OF THE ENEMY HORDES, PAYING FOR THIS WITH ITS DESTRUCTION AND WITH THE MARTYRDOM OF ITS INHABITANTS.\n\nTHE GALLANT RESISTANCE OF ITS DEFENDERS AND THE ARDENT PATRIOTISM OF ITS POPULATION WITH THEIR CALM AND PROUD ATTITUDE WILL STAY FOREVER ONE OF THE FINEST EXAMPLES OF DEDICATION AND SELFLESSNESS\"\n\nWe walk some 30 metres to the bridge. On 24 August 1914 this bridge formed an important site of action.\n\nA marble plaque tells us: ...\n\nThe fights for the Gerb√©viller Bridge\n\nAfter an artillery bombardment during the night of 23-24 August from Fraimbois, north of Gerb√©viller, the Bavarian I.R. 17 entered in the morning around nine o‚Äôclock the northern part of the village.\n\nThe B.I.R. 17 was a unit of the Bavarian 6. Infanterie Brigade, commanded by General von Clauss, a component of the Bavarian 3. Infanterie Division. The 3rd and 4th Bavarian Infantry Divisions formed together the Bavarian 2nd Army Corps, and in 1914 this corps was attached to Rupprecht's 6. Armee.\n\nWhen the Bavarians reached this barricaded bridge, they met fierce resistance of 54 Chasseurs of the 2e B.C.P., commanded by 2nd Lt. Ch√®vre. It was their mission to give the units of the 8e Corps d'Arm√©e just enough time to retreat and to reorganise in the south. Although it was in fact a Bavarian regiment and not a whole brigade, this small unit of Chasseurs successfully blocked the passage over the Mortagne of the units of the B.I.R. 17 and the rest of the Brigade for a whole day.\n\nAfter inflicting heavy losses on the Bavarians, but also after having taken themselves many casualties, the Chasseurs retreated, unseen in the dark of the late evening.\n\nBavarian atrocities\n\nThis blockade frustrated the Bavarians so much, that their anger resulted in atrocities against the Gerb√©viller citizens on 24 August; all kinds of violence took place, also against women and children. The Bavarians started to loot and to set fire to the few last buildings of the town, which were still standing after the bombardent. Later on that day they evacuated with force a part of the population.\n\nAfterwards, on 1 September, the French civilian aviator, Doctor Emile Reymond, flew over the ruins of Gerb√©viller and observed that the ruins of Gerb√©villers were still burning.\n\nOf the 475 houses only 20 houses stayed intact. Some 100 civilians of Gerb√©viller are still missing, another 50 persons were killed. At a location, called la Pr√™le, north-west of the town, the Bavarians executed 15 inhabitants.\n\nOn the 25th the 8e Corps d'Arm√©e liberated temporarily Gerb√©viller until the next Bavarian occupation of 5 - 12 September 1914.\n\nFrom the bridge we continue through the village to the north-western outskirts of Gerb√©viller. For lack of time we have to skip our visit to the two Gerb√©viller war cemeteries, east of the village. Instead we prefer to visit the location, where the execution of the 15 civilians took place, near the Monument de la Pr√™le.\n\nThe la Pr√™le Memorial commemorates the civilian victims of 24 August 1914 of the hamlet of Tanconville, west of Gerb√©viller, and of Gerb√©viller itself.\n\nMost of these civilian victims are buried here.\n\nThe four sides of the base of the obelisk wear the inscriptions of the names of these citizens.\n\nThree rows of approximately 15 graves each \"surround\" the obelisk.\n\nThe headstones are in the shape of a sword in blue horizon, decorated with a lion's head, the citizen's name and simply \"1914\".\n\n\"Le Souvenir Fran√ßais\", \"The French Remembrance\", is an official French, and also a private, association, since 1887 responsible for creating and maintaining the majority of the war memorials in France.\n\nOn this spot, or nearby, General Clauss himself attended the execution of the 15 Gerb√©viller citizens.\n\nAbout the execution near the Monument de la Pr√™le the French official war historian of the period, Gabri√´l Hanotaux, records in a modest footnote a handwritten note of the eye-witness, Soeur Julie:\n\n‚ÄúDuring this execution General Clauss was sitting under an ash tree behind a table with a bottle of champagne, when he ordered to shoot at the moment that he raised his glass.‚Äù\n\n(Source: Hanotaux: ‚ÄúL'Histoire Illustr√©e de la Guerre de 1914‚Äù)\n\nWe continue via Lun√©ville to Manonviller, where we pass the village to pay a short visit to the ruins of the Fort de Manonviller.\n\nThis view from the north is the best view, which I can offer you of the location of the ruins of the Fort de Manonviller, overgrown with vegetation.\n\nExperienced fellow travellers of the Front warned me not to enter this time the dangerous and forbidden premises of the ruins, where I might risk at least breaking a limb. As an exception this time I listened to their advice. Instead I show you in the frame below some period photos of the ruins, taken after its destruction.\n\nThe Siege of Fort de Manonviller ‚Äì 25-27 August 1914\n\nThe Fort de Manonviller was constructed to defend the valley of the Vezouze and the road to Lun√©ville.\n\nOn 25 August in the morning the Fussartillerie Regiment 18 started an artillery bombardment with large calibre shells, which would last until the late afternoon of 27 August. The Fussartillerie Regiment 18 used fromAvricourt (Elfringen) also two heavy 420 mm. artillery guns. They fired their first shells during the evening of the 25th. One of the first artillery shots was sufficient to destroy the main armoured gun turret of the fortress.\n\nDuring the bombardment units of the Bavarian 70. Reserve Division, a.o. B.R.I.R 12, and four battalions of Pioniere, components of the Bavarian 1. Armeekorps, all under command of General der Pioniere Ritter von Brug, encircled the fortress. Under protection of their artillery these infantry troops created a circle of barbed wire entanglements around the fort, leaving only one narrow exit.\n\nImpressed by the continuous artillery bombardment of 6,000 German shells, demoralised by its total destruction of his defensive works, and intimidated by the Bavarian encirclement of the fortress, Commandant Rocolle telephoned the Bavarians on the 27th and offered them the capitulation of his garrison.\n\nOn 27 August 1914, somewhere between 4 and 5 o‚Äôclock in the afternoon, Rocolle ordered the white flag to be hoisted and surrendered his garrison to the Bavarians.\n\nRocolle‚Äôs capitulation caused a public discussion in the French media about the question, whether he had surrendered too early or without fighting the Bavarian infantry units.\n\nConsidering the later developments during the following month the Bavarian success here was not of any strategic importance, but for the time being it was still better news in the German media than the news of being beaten on the same day at the Battle of Rozelieures.\n\nUnfortunately this memorial in front of the fort forms the only site of interest, which we are able to visit.\n\nFrom the fort we return to Manonviller.\n\nAt the centre of the village we go westward along the C 7 into the direction of the village of Domjevin ...\n\n... on our way to a French Dressing Station Bunker.\n\nSome 1,5 km. west of the village of Domjevin, and in bird's flight some 2 km. away from the fort de Manonviller, we park our car.\n\nWe follow this from the road rather inconspicuous sign:\n\nBeing not more than 2 km. away from the later consolidated front line of Laneuveville-aux-Bois, V√©ho and Reillon, it is possible that this bunker functioned as a dressing station, not only during 1914, but also afterwards, until 1918.\n\nAt first we detect in the copse only an open spot with the two eastern entrances of the bunker. The eastern main entrance of the bunker.\n\nThe extreme eastern entrance is almost hidden beneath the vegetation.\n\nAs the entrance is partly filled in, I estimate the corridor inward to be not higher than 1,25 m. and about 0,75 m. wide.\n\nWe return to the open spot and follow a long wall westward.\n\nSurrounded by three walls we detect the western main entrance.\n\nThis French concrete is also still of an amazingly good quality.\n\nView from the entrance outside.\n\nWe enter a wide and high arched corridor, with wide door openings.\n\nThese corridors are not like the narrow and low shafts, used elsewhere on the front for underground mining activity.\n\nThe two in the centre connecting tunnels had to be wide enough to let stretcher parties pass, coming from the front.\n\nA detail of the arched ceiling, where two large rooms come together with the two tunnels.\n\nI suppose this room and the one opposite were used for first aid surgery.\n\nAn airshaft in the ceiling.\n\nThe southern \"operating theatre\".\n\nWe continue our exploration through the eastern tunnel, ...\n\n... on our way to the eastern exit.\n\nThe eastern exit, photographed from the outside.\n\nThe outer concrete wall, that protects the eastern exit, forms not only the start but also the end of our exploration of this French dressing station near Domjevin.\n\nSatisfied after such an interesting day we return to our car."
