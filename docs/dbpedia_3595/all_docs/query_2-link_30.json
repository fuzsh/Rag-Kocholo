        "text": "Was it harsh? The Germans were about to take Paris and they only got 2 provinces. They also didn't take any of France's overseas possessions.\n\n\"Men must be treated generously or destroyed for they take revenge upon small insults. For large insults they can not.\" - Machiavelli\n\nBismarck knew Alsace-Loraine would create a French desire for revenge. Wilhelm I, however, insisted there had to be some territorial gain. Otherwise the German people would think the war had been fought for nothing. Bismarck negotiated generous terms for Austria, but Wilhelm had not read his Machiavelli when it came to France.\n\nThe main reason for the harsh conditions of the treaty was public opinion which was shared by several high-ranking members of the German government and the military, including the King/Emperor Wilhelm I. and the officer's corps. While the war seems short in comparison to wars of the 20th century, it had dragged on for quite a while. Napoleon III. and his Army had been defeated by Autumn 1870 already, but the French revolution and the new Republican government kept on fighting for six more months which involved bloody fighting, a very long siege of Paris and increased activities by partisans in the back. All that caused increasing frustration and bad feelings on both sides. It's well-known that the longer a war lasts, the worse things and opinions become.\n\nThe basic idea on the German side was that the French should be \"smashed to the ground so they couldn't recover for 100 years\" - basically the same attitude the French displayed in 1918/1919 after World War I. The concept of a \"punishing peace\" gained traction in those days.\n\nCompared to other \"punishing peace treaties\" like Versailles (1919) or Brest-Litowsk (1918), Frankfurt wasn't THAT bad, but for the year 1871 it was quite harsh. Just remember that France did receive a comparatively friendly peace treaty after more than 2 decades of revolutionary wars and Napoleon-campaigns in 1815 - and now it was reduced in size and had to pay reparations after less than a year of war. Emotions in France were also bad because following the surrender, the French had to deal with a left-wing extremist uprising in Paris which ended with a lot of destruction and thousands of dead within the capital.\n\nFrance was able to pay the reparations within a couple of years (1873 or 1874, I don't remember exactly), but the loss of those two provinces hurt badly. Bismarck finally relented to pressure from public opinion and others because he thought that the French would want revenge in any case, so giving a future Germany an advantage by having two extra provinces made sense in his mind.\n\n(Source: 70/71 by Klaus-JÃ¼rgen Bremm (German source))\n\nThough the treaty did polarise French policy and opinion towards Germany for the next 40 years. The reconquest of Alsace-Lorraine became an obsession (in my opinion) and would be a major reason for Frances involvement in WW1.\n\nA myth. By 1914 Alsace-Lorraine was long forgotten.\n\nAlsace-Lorraine may not have been as visceral as it used to be in 1914, but it still mattered. French governments were still talking about an inevitable war with Germany.\n\nAfter the start of the war, yes , they talked much about Alsace-Lorraine. An important part of the French propaganda.\n\nJust to clarify, when were the French propagandizing about A-L? 1875? 1885? 1900? 1910? 1915?\n\nSo after 1900 A-L didn't matter anymore. The die was already cast. Germany and France were going to be on opposite sides of the next war. But as these decisions were being worked out, in the 1870s, '80s, and '90s, the A-L issue weighed heavily on French minds. The Treaty of Frankfort was therefore important in deciding the system of alliances that became WW1.\n\nIt still mattered. It just didn't dominate French politics to the same extent. After 1900, reclaiming Alsace-Lorraine was a national goal. Before 1900, it was a national obsession.\n\nTwo things determined the WWI alliances - the conflict between France and Germany over Alsace-Lorraine and the conflict between Russia and Austria-Hungary for suzerainty in the Balkans.\n\nGermany had been bullied , ravaged , humiliated by the militarist French for centuries\n\nthis was seen as comeuppance by the press and the public\n\nthe problem with democracy is that sometimes reason go out of the window while passions rule\n\nAlsace Lorraine was the man motor for the french military to get more money from the national budget ,\n\nit was the everlasting cornucopia for them , too many people profited from military contract ,\n\nit acted the same in Germany to prepare for those dastardly French aggressors ,\n\nBritain Army had to do with colonial expansion but the Royal Navy got some serious gravy for ship building\n\npre-war , Europe was arming itself to the teeth , it just needed a spark\n\nAfter the Treaty of Frankfurt Bismarck made it the guiding principle of his foreign policy to keep France isolated. He assumed the next war would see Germany and France on opposite sides, and he made certain that France had no allies. It was only after Bismarck had left the scene that France was able to enter into alliances with Britain and Russia. After the war with Austria, Bismarck reconciled with them and eventually entered into an alliance with Austria-Hungary. After the war with France, Bismarck made no effort to reconcile. He had advised Wilhelm I to not annex A-L but Wilhelm did not listen."
