The Enchantment of Picturesque Towns and Villages\n\nAlsace is home to some of the most beautiful villages in France and, arguably, all over Europe. Every time I step into towns like Eguisheim, Riquewihr, and Colmar, I feel like I am wandering into a living, breathing postcard.\n\nWith their cobblestone streets and half-timbered houses adorned with flowers, these villages seem untouched by time.\n\nColmar, often called the ‘Capital of Alsatian Wine’, is enchanting with its canals and brightly coloured buildings, earning it the nickname ‘Little Venice’.\n\nEach village in Alsace tells its own unique story, with buildings that range from the medieval to the Renaissance, all beautifully preserved. It’s a photographer’s dream and a haven for those who seek the simple joy of meandering through streets filled with history, charm, and beauty.\n\nAs you visit Alsace, you enter a world where fairy tales don’t seem so far from reality.\n\nVisit Alsace with my Favourite Towns and Villages: Colmar, Eguisheim, Kaysersberg, Obernai, Ribeauvillé, Riquewihr, Sélestat, Wissembourg\n\n2. A Toast along the Alsace Wine Route\n\nIf there is ONE (only one) place I should choose from when I visit Alsace, I would definitely choose a tour of the Alsace Wine Route. Indeed, the scenic route is akin to entering a portal to a world where the vineyard-strewn landscapes rival the wines’ richness and diversity.\n\nStretching over 170 kilometres, this famed route meanders through rolling hills and past ancient castles, inviting oenophiles and novices alike to explore the heart of Alsace’s wine country.\n\nHere, the tradition of winemaking dates back centuries, offering a deep dive into the region’s soul through its Rieslings, Gewurztraminers, and Pinot Gris.\n\nFamily-owned and steeped in history, the vineyards offer tastings that are as educational as they are delightful. Along the way, picturesque villages dot the route, with wine festivals and celebrations inviting visitors to taste the wine and immerse themselves in the local culture and hospitality.\n\nA journey along the Alsace Wine Route isn’t just about sipping wine; it’s about experiencing a way of life that cherishes the land, the grape, and the timeless art of winemaking.\n\nVisit Alsace with my Favourite Sites on the Wine Route: Andlau, Colmar, Eguisheim, Hunawihr, Kaysersberg, Obernai, Ribeauvillé, Riquewihr, Turckheim, Thann\n\n3. A Tapestry of Rich History\n\nAlsace is a region where the past is preserved and vibrantly alive, woven into the very fabric of its towns, villages, and landscapes. This is why I love Alsace. As a curious mind, the historic province never stops impressing me.\n\nThis area has seen a multitude of rulers, from the Romans to the Holy Roman Empire. Its unique position at the crossroads of France and Germany has left a rich, multifaceted cultural heritage. The region was home to a unique alliance of 10 cities: the Decapolis of Alsace.\n\nThe storied past of Alsace is evident in its diverse architecture, from the imposing Haut-Koenigsbourg Castle, perched high above the wine route, offering panoramic views and a glimpse into medieval life, to the Strasbourg Cathedral, a masterpiece of Gothic architecture that took centuries to complete.\n\nThe region’s history is also deeply etched in its smaller towns, where buildings bear the marks of Renaissance beauty and the scars of wars past. Museums throughout Alsace, such as the Alsatian Museum in Strasbourg, delve into local customs and traditions, telling the stories of people who have called this region home.\n\nVisiting Alsace allows you to step into a living history book, where every cobblestone, vineyard, and village has a story to tell. This offers a profound connection to the past that is both educational and deeply moving.\n\nVisit Alsace with my Favourite Historic Sites: Belfort, Colmar, Ferrette, Fleckenstein Castle, Hartmannswillerkopf (Vieil Armand), Haut-Kœnigsbourg Castle, Mont Sainte-Odile, Neuf-Brisach, Sélestat, Strasbourg, Thann\n\n4. A Culinary Journey Through Alsace\n\nAlsace is a feast for the senses, where culinary traditions are as rich and layered as its history. The region’s cuisine is a delightful amalgamation of French finesse and German heartiness, creating dishes unique to this area and celebrated across the globe.\n\nAgreed, not every Alsatian dish appeals to me, but to those who enjoy hearty food, you’ll be in heaven!\n\nOne cannot visit Alsace without indulging in the local speciality, choucroute garnie, a lavish dish of sauerkraut topped with a variety of meats, a true testament to the region’s love for both flavour and abundance.\n\nAnother must-try is the tarte flambée, also known as flammekueche, a thin, crispy pizza-like delight topped with cream, onions, and lardons, embodying the simplicity and elegance of Alsatian cooking.\n\nThe region’s cheeses, like Munster, are not just food but a piece of Alsatian heritage, best enjoyed with a slice of crusty bread and a glass of local wine.\n\nAlsace’s culinary journey doesn’t end with savoury dishes; it’s also renowned for its pastries and desserts, such as kugelhopf, a crown-shaped, raisin-studded cake that perfectly accompanies a cup of coffee or tea.\n\nEach meal in Alsace is an opportunity to explore the rich tapestry of flavours and traditions that make this region a paradise for food lovers.\n\nVisit Alsace with my Favourite Alsatian Specialties: Baeckaoffe, Bredles (Chrismtas cookies), Bretzel, Choucroute Garnie, Flammekueche (Tartes Flambées), Kugelhopf, Munster cheese, Gertwiller Gingerbread, Wines of Alsace\n\n5. The Magic of Christmas Markets\n\nAlsace transforms into a winter wonderland come December, with its Christmas markets (Marchés de Noël) capturing the essence of holiday spirit and tradition. This is why Alsace is my favourite place in France to spend Advent.\n\nStrasbourg hosts one of the oldest and most famous Christmas markets in Europe, dating back to 1570, where the city comes alive with festive lights, aromatic mulled wine, and carols floating through the air.\n\nThese markets are not just places to shop; they are a deeply rooted part of Alsatian culture, offering a magical experience where every stall tells a story. Handcrafted ornaments, local artisanal products, and seasonal treats like gingerbread and bretzels make perfect gifts or personal treasures.\n\nWalking through these markets, you’re enveloped in a sense of joy and community, with the historic squares and timbered houses providing a picturesque backdrop to the festivities.\n\nThe Christmas markets of Alsace are a testament to the region’s capacity to blend tradition with celebration, inviting visitors from around the world to partake in its warmth and cheer.\n\nA visit to Alsace during this season is a journey into the heart of Christmas itself, where the magic of the markets leaves you with memories that linger long after the holiday lights have dimmed.\n\nVisit Alsace with my Favourite Christmas Markets: Colmar, Eguisheim, Haguenau, Kaysersberg, Mulhouse, Obernai, Riquewihr, Sélestat, Strasbourg, Wissembourg\n\n6. Exploring the Great Outdoors\n\nAlsace is not just a feast for the senses but a playground for the soul, offering endless opportunities for outdoor enthusiasts to connect with nature. I remember the traditional Sunday afternoon walk in the Upper Vosges, from which we could see the Swiss Alps emerging in the distance from a sea of clouds in the middle of winter. Or countless cycle rides in the rural land of the Sundgau in southern Alsace.\n\nThe Vosges Mountains cradle the region to the west and the Rhine River to the east, creating a landscape that is as varied as it is breathtaking. Hikers and cyclists are spoilt for choice, with trails winding through vineyards, forests, and mountain paths, each offering stunning views and a chance to experience the tranquillity of the Alsatian countryside.\n\nThe Ballons des Vosges Regional Nature Park is a highlight. It encompasses rolling hills, serene lakes, and lush forests, providing a haven for wildlife and a peaceful retreat for visitors.\n\nFor those seeking a more leisurely pace, the Route des Crêtes offers a scenic drive along the Vosges’ crest, with viewpoints stretching across the plains to the Black Forest in Germany.\n\nWhether it’s the adrenaline rush of mountain biking, the serene pleasure of a leisurely hike, or the simple joy of a picnic amidst nature’s beauty, Alsace offers an outdoor experience that rejuvenates the body, mind, and spirit.\n\nVisit Alsace with my Favourite Natural Sites: Alsace Bossue, Ballon d’Alsace, Grand-Ballon, Hohneck, Northern Vosges, Sundgau, Alsatian Jura, Pays de Hanau, Grand-Ried\n\n7. A Fusion of Architectural Marvels\n\nAlsace is a living museum of architectural styles, each building and village a testament to the region’s tumultuous history and cultural fusion. I have always been interested in monuments and architecture, and Alsace is a great place to marvel at Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance styles.\n\nThe unique Franco-German influence is evident in the picturesque half-timbered houses that line the cobblestone streets of villages like Eguisheim and Riquewihr. Their colourful facades and flower-filled windowsills offer a postcard-perfect view at every turn.\n\nStrasbourg, the capital of Alsace, is home to the stunning Strasbourg Cathedral. This masterpiece of Gothic architecture dominates the city’s skyline with its intricate façade and soaring spire.\n\nWith its canals and traditional houses, the Petite France district feels like stepping back in time, while the modern European Parliament building represents the region’s role in contemporary governance.\n\nIn Colmar, the blend of Germanic and French styles creates a unique townscape. Landmarks such as the Maison des Têtes and the Bartholdi Museum (birthplace of the Statue of Liberty’s sculptor) showcase the region’s artistic and historical depth.\n\nAlsace’s architectural diversity is a visual journey through time, reflecting the shifts in power and culture that have shaped this borderland and offering visitors a chance to experience the seamless blend of history and beauty that defines the region.\n\nVisit Alsace with my Favourite Monuments: Citadel and Lion of Belfort, Little Venice of Colmar, Pfister House in Colmar, Castle of Ferrette, Fleckenstein Castle, Necropolis of Hartmannswillerkopf (Vieil Armand), Haut-Kœnigsbourg Castle, Abbey of Mont Sainte-Odile, Fortified town of Neuf-Brisach, Petite-France District in Strasbourg, Strasbourg Cathedral, Collegiate of Thann\n\n8. The Heartbeat of Cultural Events\n\nAlsace vibrates with cultural events throughout the year, each festivity a window into the soul of this vibrant region. There’s an event for every interest, from traditional wine festivals that celebrate the region’s rich viticultural heritage to folk dancing and music festivals that bring Alsatian traditions to life. I fondly remember my visits to the Mulhouse Carnival and the Wine Festivals.\n\nOne of the highlights is the Fête de la Musique in Strasbourg, where the streets come alive with sounds ranging from classical to contemporary music, reflecting the diverse cultural tapestry of Alsace.\n\nThe region’s calendar is dotted with Christmas markets, which transform towns into festive wonderlands and create a magical experience for visitors.\n\nAdditionally, Alsace hosts unique events like the Pottery Market in Soufflenheim and Betschdorf, where artisans showcase their crafts, and the Easter markets that signal the arrival of spring with beautifully decorated eggs and local delicacies.\n\nThese events are not just celebrations; they’re an invitation to immerse yourself in the local culture, meet the people who call Alsace home, and experience the warmth and hospitality that define this enchanting region.

Museums and Art: A Journey Through Creativity\n\nAlsace is a treasure trove for art lovers and history buffs, offering an impressive array of museums catering to a wide range of interests. I remember my first time at the Unterlinden Museum in Colmar; it was an amazing visit that complemented other visits to Strasbourg’s museums.\n\nThe region’s rich history and unique cultural heritage are encapsulated within the walls of its many museums, from the Unterlinden Museum in Colmar, which houses the famed Isenheim Altarpiece—a masterpiece of German Renaissance art—to the Strasbourg Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, showcasing cutting-edge works in a sleek, modern setting.\n\nThe Ecomusée d’Alsace, one of the largest open-air museums in France, brings history to life. It recreates an Alsatian village from the early 20th century, where visitors can explore traditional houses, farms, and workshops, offering a vivid glimpse into the past.\n\nAdditionally, the Automobile Museum in Mulhouse features one of the world’s most impressive collections of vintage cars, illustrating the region’s industrial heritage.\n\nEach museum in Alsace tells a part of the region’s story, from artistic achievements to historical milestones and technological advancements. Visiting these museums provides a deeper understanding and appreciation of Alsace, enriching the travel experience with knowledge, inspiration, and awe.\n\nVisit Alsace with my Favourite Museums: Citadel of Belfort, Unterlinden Museum in Colmar, Historic Museum in Haguenau, Ecomusée d’Alsace, Museums of the City of Strasbourg, Technical Museums of Mulhouse (Musée de l’Automobile, Cité du Train, Electropolis, Musée de l’Impression sur Étoffes, Musée du Papier Peint)\n\n10. Gateway to European Adventures\n\nAlsace’s strategic location at the heart of Europe makes it an ideal starting point for broader European adventures. That’s what I like about Alsace: it is a region that gives easy access to Germany and Switzerland. And the French Alps are not that far either (when crossing Western Switzerland).\n\nNestled on the border between France and Germany, with Switzerland a short drive away, Alsace offers unparalleled access to a trio of European cultures.\n\nFrom Strasbourg, you can quickly embark on day trips or longer excursions into the Black Forest in Germany, offering dense woodlands and picturesque villages, or cross into Switzerland to explore the cosmopolitan city of Basel, known for its vibrant arts scene and beautiful Rhine River views.\n\nThe region’s well-connected transportation network, including high-speed trains and well-maintained roads, means that cities like Paris, Frankfurt, and Zurich are only a few hours away. This makes it possible to breakfast in Colmar, lunch in the Alsace vineyards, and dine along the banks of the Rhine in Germany.\n\nThis ease of movement opens up many travel opportunities, allowing visitors to Alsace to experience a rich tapestry of European cultures, landscapes, and cuisines within a single trip.\n\nAlsace is not just a destination; it’s a gateway to exploring the heart of Europe, making every visit a journey of discovery far beyond its borders.\n\nMy Favourite Sites to Visit just outside Alsace: German Wine Route in the Palatinate, Imperial City of Speyer, City and Castle of Heidelberg, Schloss of Bruchsal, Schloss of Rastatt, Baden-Baden, Black Forest Mountain, Titisee, Basel (Switzerland) and the Rhine Falls in Rheinfelden\n\nFinal Words\n\nIn the enchanting region of Alsace, where history whispers from the cobblestone streets and the landscape unfolds like a storybook, I have found a blend of culture, cuisine, and natural beauty unmatched in Europe.\n\nFrom the picturesque villages that seem to spring from a painter’s canvas to the vibrant cultural festivals that celebrate the rich tapestry of local life, Alsace has always offered me a journey of discovery at every turn. And I believe it will be the same for you.\n\nThe wine routes invite exploration of a centuries-old viticultural tradition, while the region’s museums and architectural marvels connect visitors to the past in a profoundly personal way.\n\nAlsace is more than a destination; it’s an experience that lingers in the heart long after the journey ends, a reminder of the joy of exploration and the beauty of embracing different cultures.\n\nOn the way to Lorraine\n\nAs we bid adieu to Alsace’s enchanting landscapes and rich cultural tapestry, our journey through the heart of Europe takes us to another region steeped in history and beauty: Lorraine.\n\nNestled west of Alsace, Lorraine beckons with its unique allure, from the mirroring waters of Lake Madine to the art nouveau elegance of Nancy. This region, with its poignant World War memorials and the majestic Vosges Mountains, offers a profound exploration of resilience, beauty, and the enduring spirit of discovery.\n\nLorraine, like Alsace, is a blend of cultures and histories but with its own distinct narrative. Here, the past and present merge in cities like Metz, with its Gothic Cathedral housing the world’s largest expanse of stained glass windows, created by artists including Marc Chagall. The region’s culinary offerings, from the savoury quiche Lorraine to the sweet madeleines, beckon food enthusiasts to indulge in flavours that tell stories of the land and its people.\n\nAs we delve into Lorraine’s wonders, we uncover a region that, though less travelled, is brimming with gems waiting to be discovered. From the tranquil beauty of its lakes and forests to the vibrant streets of its cities, Lorraine invites us to continue our journey of discovery, promising experiences that enrich, inspire, and captivate."
