        "text": "Alsace-Lorraine, a historic province in Eastern France, is where you will find the ancient capitals at Strasbourg and Nancy. The only thing that separates Germany from this region is the Rhine, and the area is extremely reminiscent of the German look (and sometimes feel). With its Germanic dialect, French sense of fashion, love of Foie gras and sauerkraut, fine wine and beer, this region often leaves you wondering quite where you are.\n\nBurgundy\n\nBurgundy has it all - glorious countryside and vineyards, amazing gastronomy, a fabulous history, picturesque villages and beautiful towns, the Burgundy Canal, and an incredible capital city - Dijon. There are also more chateaux in this region than any other in France, many of them with well-stocked wine cellars, gourmet restaurants nearby and swimming pools. It`s a stunning region with plenty going for it!\n\nLoire Valley\n\nFrance`s Loire Valley is the lush area surrounding the 170-mile center portion of the Loire River in Central France. This region is considered to be the `Gardens of France`. There are literally countless chateaux (castles) scattered between a beautiful river and charming little towns. The abundance of stunning landscapes with vineyards, fairly tale castles and rich history, that surrounds them, makes the Loire Valley truly an incredible region to visit.\n\nChampagne\n\nhe winemaking region of Champagne, located in the northeast part of France just 55 miles outside of Paris, is known for its sparkling white wine. This is one of the most famous and posh areas of France with many well-known Champagne companies like Moet and Chandon, that have cellars and vineyards. This region is intended to enjoy at a leisurely pace if you truly want to appreciate what it has to offer.\n\nNormandy\n\nNormandy, a region of Northern France just west of Paris, is famous for its role in World War II as well as a number of other significant events throughout its history. However, its rugged coastline on the English Channel is also home to a number of beautiful small towns and villages perfect for an escape from the congestion of Paris, including Caen, Le Havre, and Rouen.\n\nProvence\n\nWith many of the most beautiful places to visit in France, Provence, a region in southeastern France, is made for explorers. From the Southern Alps and Camargue plains to rolling vineyards, olive groves, pine forests and lavender fields, the stunning variety of landscape offered here make it an irresistible destination to discover. Swim in the Calanques in Cassis, shop in the lively markets, eat Provencal bouillabaisse, catch a festival, cruise the rivers and canals, and discover the many quaint towns and villages.\n\nFrench Riviera\n\nThe southeast coast of Provence, France, is sprinkled with some of the world`s most popular beaches and destinations, including Nice, Monaco, Cannes, Saint Tropez and Menton. Known all over the world for its glamour and beauty, the Riviera is a playground for the rich and famous and a true paradise destination. The French Riviera offers a picture-perfect stretch of coastline, historic hilltop towns, twisting mountain roads and white pebble beaches leading into the azure water. The entire stretch of coastline in the south of France is dotted with a countless number of sights to be explore.\n\nBrittany\n\nBrittany is a place that is not usually on a lot of traveler’s lists. France’s northwest cul-de-sac that reaches out into the Atlantic Ocean is just too far off the beaten path for many tourists. However, this can make all the more reason to visit. With over 1,500 miles of jaw-dropping panoramic coastline, charming medieval towns and villages, and the amazing diversity on display, there are really great things to see in Brittany."
