        "text": "From annexation to World War I\n\nMain article: Franco-Prussian War\n\nFrench map with shading showing dÃ©partements before 1870 with black lines after 1871.\n\n[lower-alpha 2]\n\nPhoto of a statue in the Place Maginot Nancy that personifies the loss of Alsace as separation of a mother and daughter.\n\nThe Black Stain[lower-alpha 3] (1887) by Albert Bettannier.[lower-alpha 4]\n\nThe general government of Elsass (1875) by A. Petermann.\n\n1887 German map, using German place-names, of Alsace-Lorraine.\n\nIn 1871, the newly created German Empire's demand for Alsace from France after its victory in the Franco-Prussian War was not simply a punitive measure. The transfer was controversial even among the Germans: The German Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, was initially opposed to it, as he thought (correctly) it would engender permanent French enmity toward Germany.[4] Some German industrialists did not want the competition from Alsatian industries, such as the cloth makers who would be exposed to competition from the sizeable industry in Mulhouse. Karl Marx also warned his fellow Germans:\n\n\"If Alsace and Lorraine are taken, then France will later make war on Germany in conjunction with Russia. It is unnecessary to go into the unholy consequences.\"[5]\n\nBismarck and the South German industrialists proposed to have Alsace ceded to Switzerland, while Switzerland would compensate Germany with another territory. The Swiss rejected the proposal, preferring to remain neutral between the French and Germans.[6]\n\nThe German Emperor, Wilhelm I, eventually sided with army commander Helmuth von Moltke, other Prussian generals and other officials who argued that a westward shift in the French border was necessary for strategic military and ethnographic reasons. From a linguistic perspective, the transfer involved people who for the most part spoke Alemannic German dialects. At the time, ethnic identity was often based primarily on language, unlike the more multifaceted approach focusing on self identification in use today. From a military perspective, by early 1870s standards, shifting the frontier away from the Rhine would give the Germans a strategic buffer against feared future French attacks. Due to the annexation, the Germans gained control of the fortifications of Metz and Strasbourg (StraÃburg) on the left bank of the Rhine and most of the iron resources of Lorraine.\n\nCreating a new Imperial Territory (Reichsland) out of formerly French territory would achieve this goal: Although a Reichsland would not technically be part of the Kingdom of Prussia, being governed directly by the Empire (headed by the King of Prussia as Emperor, and the minister-president of Prussia as Imperial Chancellor) would in practical terms amount to the same thing. Thus, by annexing AlsaceâLorraine, Berlin was able to avoid complications with Baden and Bavaria on matters such as new fortifications.\n\nMemory of the Napoleonic Wars was still fresh in the 1870s. Wilhelm I himself had had to flee with the Prussian royal family to East Prussia as a nine year old in 1806 and had served in the Battle of Waterloo. Until the Franco-Prussian War, the French had maintained a long-standing desire to establish their entire eastern frontier on the Rhine, and thus they were viewed by most 19th century Germans as an aggressive and acquisitive people. In the years before 1870 the Germans feared the French more than the French feared the Germans. Many Germans at the time thought that the creation of the new Empire in itself would be enough to earn permanent French enmity, and thus desired a defensible border with their long-standing enemy. Any additional enmity that would be earned from territorial concessions was downplayed as marginal and insignificant in the overall scheme of things.\n\nThe annexed area consisted of the northern part of Lorraine, along with Alsace.\n\nThe area around the town of Belfort (now the French Territoire de Belfort) was unaffected, because Belfort had been defended by Colonel Denfert-Rochereau, who surrendered only after receiving orders from Paris, and was compensated by another territory.\n\nThe town of MontbÃ©liard and its surrounding area to the south of Belfort, which have been part of the Doubs department since 1816, and therefore were not considered part of Alsace, were not included, although they were a Protestant enclave belonging to WÃ¼rttemberg from 1397â1806.\n\nThis area corresponded to the present French dÃ©partements of Bas-Rhin (in its entirety), Haut-Rhin (except the area of Belfort and MontbÃ©liard), and a small northeast section of the Vosges dÃ©partement, all of which made up Alsace, and most of the dÃ©partements of Moselle (four-fifths of Moselle) and the northeast of Meurthe (one-third of Meurthe), which were the eastern part of Lorraine.\n\nThe remaining two-thirds of the dÃ©partement of Meurthe and the westernmost one-fifth of Moselle, which had escaped German annexation were joined to form the new French dÃ©partement of Meurthe-et-Moselle.\n\nThe new border between France and Germany mainly followed the geolinguistic divide between French and German dialects, except in a few valleys of the Alsatian side of the Vosges mountains, the city of Metz and its region and in the area of ChÃ¢teau-Salins (formerly in the Meurthe dÃ©partement), which were annexed by Germany although most people there spoke French.[lower-alpha 5] In 1900, 11.6% of the population of AlsaceâLorraine spoke French as their first language (11.0% in 1905, 10.9% in 1910).\n\nThat small francophone areas were affected was used in France to denounce the new border as hypocrisy, since Germany had justified the annexation on linguistic grounds. The German administration was tolerant of the use of the French language (in sharp contrast to the use of the Polish language in the Province of Posen), and French was permitted as an official language and school language in those areas where it was spoken by a majority. This changed in 1914 with the First World War.\n\nThe Treaty of Frankfurt gave the residents of the region until 1 October 1872, to choose between emigrating to France or remaining in the region and having their nationality legally changed to German. About 161,000 people, or around 10.4% of the AlsaceâLorraine population, opted for French citizenship (the so-called Optanden); but, only about 50,000 actually emigrated, while the rest acquired German citizenship.[7]\n\nThe sentiment of attachment to France stayed strong at least during the first 16 years of the annexation. During the Reichstag elections, the 15 deputies of 1874, 1881, 1884 (but one) and 1887 were called protester deputies (fr: dÃ©putÃ©s protestataires) because they expressed to the Reichstag their opposition to the annexation by means of the 1874 motion in the French language:\n\n\"May it please the Reichstag to decide that the populations of AlsaceâLorraine that were annexed, without having been consulted, to the German Reich by the treaty of Frankfurt have to come out particularly about this annexation.\"[8]\n\nThe abusive and oppressive behaviour by the German military towards the population of the town of Saverne (the Saverne Affair, usually known in English-language accounts as the Zabern Affair) led to protests not just in Alsace, but in other regions, which put a severe strain on the relationship between the people of AlsaceâLorraine and the rest of the German Empire.\n\nUnder the German Empire of 1871â1918, the annexed territory constituted the Reichsland or Imperial Territory of ElsaÃâLothringen (German for AlsaceâLorraine). The area was administered directly from Berlin, but was granted limited autonomy in 1911. This included its constitution and state assembly, its own flag, and the ElsÃ¤ssisches Fahnenlied (\"Alsatian Flag Song\") as its anthem.\n\nDuring World War I\n\nFurther information: World War I\n\nIn French foreign policy, the demand for the return of Alsace and Lorraine faded in importance after 1880 with the decline of the monarchist element. When the World War broke out in 1914, recovery of the two lost provinces became the top French war goal.[9]\n\nIn the early 20th century, the increased militarization of Europe, and the lack of negotiation between major powers, led to harsh and rash actions taken by both sides in respect to AlsaceâLorraine during World War I. As soon as war was declared, both the French and German authorities used the inhabitants of AlsaceâLorraine as propaganda pawns.\n\nGermans living in France were arrested and placed into camps by the French authorities. Upon occupying certain villages, veterans of the 1870 conflict were sought out and arrested by the French army.[lower-alpha 6]\n\nThe Germans responded to the outbreak of war with harsh measures against the AlsaceâLorraine populace:[10] the Saverne Affair had convinced the high command that the population was hostile to the German Empire and that it should be forced into submission. German troops occupied some homes. The German military feared French partisans â or francs-tireurs, as they had been called during the Franco-Prussian War â would reappear.\n\nGerman authorities developed policies aimed at reducing the influence of French. In Metz, French street names, which had been displayed in French and German, were suppressed in January 1915. Six months later, on 15 July 1915, German became the only official language in the region,[11] leading to the Germanization of the townsâ names effective 2 September 1915.\n\nProhibiting the speaking of French in public further increased the exasperation of some of the natives, who were long accustomed to mixing their conversation with French language (see code-switching); still, the use even of one word, as innocent as \"bonjour\", could incur a fine.[lower-alpha 7] Some ethnic Germans in the region cooperated in the persecution as a way to demonstrate German patriotism.[lower-alpha 8]\n\nGerman authorities became increasingly worried about renewed French nationalism. The Reichsland governor stated in February 1918: \"Sympathies towards France and repulsion for Germans have penetrated to a frightening depth the petty bourgeoisie and the peasantry\".[11] But in order to spare them possible confrontations with relatives in France but also to avoid any desertion from the Alsatian soldiers to the French army,[12][lower-alpha 9] German Army draftees from AlsaceâLorraine were sent mainly to the Eastern front, or the Navy (Kaiserliche Marine). About 15,000 Alsatians and Lorrainers served in the German Navy."
