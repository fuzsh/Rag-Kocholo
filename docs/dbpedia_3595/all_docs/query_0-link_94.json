        "text": "Honestly I dunno how unrealistic that is. The CP was *really* vindictive in the treaties it pushed on powers that beat them, Versailles was nothing compared to the Treaty of Frankfurt and Brest-Litovsk.\n\nTreaty of Frankfurt? You mean the 1871 one? Because though in its time was considered harsh it was incredibly mild compared to any of the treaties at the end of WWI.\n\nIt's because Austria-Hungary didn't have the capability to absorb millions more Italians who hate them and it isn't like Italy is that thoroughly beaten just because Venice is occupied. They didn't do anything drastic to Romania, a far weaker country the CP decisively won in and occupied and they even gave Romania land with the only territorial losses being a few southern areas to Bulgaria and a few villages along the mountain passes to A-H. Realistically they'd probably do the same with Italy and just grab a few mountain passes and villages in the event of victory, the sort of peace treaty that barely registers on the national conscious (i.e. France annexing a few bordering villages after World War II, although they had wanted to annex more).\n\nThe Venice cliche probably exists because Germany's ally needs some sort of territorial aggrandizement to at least partially much Germany's gains (usually a chunk of Poland, Belgium, or another giant bite out of France).\n\nAs idiotic as it was there were actual planes by austrian politicans and military officers before the war to reannex either Venice or both of the lost provinces in the event of a successfull war against Italy.\n\nTreaty of Frankfurt?

Germany was never occupied outside of a small part of the Rhineland and only a third of their debt was to be paid unconditionally with the rest subject to revision based on their ability to pay.\n\nOverall, I’d say the Franco-Prussian terms were a good deal harsher.\n\nAside from carving a sizeable chunk out of France, they occupied nearly all of Northern France for years and forced the French to pay a five billion gold franc indemnity before they withdrew, which while less than the Versailles debt (the indemnity was about $33B in today’s money) was crushing when you consider how small France’s economy was in the 1870s vs Germany’s 50 years later and the fact that France’s economy had been wrecked by the Franco-Prussian War while WWI hadn’t touched Germany.

Germany lost much more territory than France did. A huge chunk of the country was also demilitarized.\n\n2. Crushing? France was able to pay of the idemnity in a few years (2-3 I think). In the case of Germany it was so huge that it was scheduled to be payed in 90 years (the french originally was for 5 years I think), and it was so crushing that it had to be restructured several times before finally giving up on it altogether. I have no idea how you can comapre the 2 and conclude the Versailles treaty was milder.\n\n3. The German economy in 1914 might have been much stronger than the french in 1871. But by 1918 Germany has collapsed - after total exhaustion. Just because there was no actual fighting doesnt mean Germany was untouched: the people were starving, the factories have been converted to produce warmaterial, the german merchant fleet was completely gone etc.\n\n4. The Frankfurt treaty had no provisions for the strength of the french army, for the french navy etc. When they paid the indemnity they were free to do what they wanted.\n\n5. The Frankfurt treaty did not make out Napoleon III to be a warcriminal.\n\n6. The Frankfurt treaty did not lay all blame at the feet of France. It contained no warguilt clause.\n\n7. Forbidding the Anschluss was also unparalelled.\n\nThe idea that the Franco-Prussian treaty was in any way harsher than the Versailles treaty is so absurd to me its baffling.\n\nFrance was able to be rid of any constraits in 2-3 years. The german troops left and the only consequence left still affecting France was the loss of Alsace Lorraine.\n\nFor the Germans the contraints did not automatically end - they were finally broken by Hitler 15 years later.\n\n2.

Bismarck himself quoted that the French economy was crippled for three decades when the indemnity clause was written down amounting to 479 Billion dollars in todays money, but France managed to stave off the worse effects by introducing the Economic Reforms of 1872.

As far as the indemnity and occupation though, that aspect was harsher. The only reason the Germans didn't put such restrictions on France's military was because the defeat, occupation, and indemnity were expected to basically end them as a major power. I wouldn't say the rest as far as the war guilt and war criminal clause were much more humiliating than the German victory parade through Paris and their occupation of it.\n\nThis was more in fact due to French prudence rather than vindictiveness or whatever.

Something that Germany did not do and was unwilling to reform in 1919 and 20, even with a hyperinflation going on.\n\nYeah, Germany's military rearmament ended up costing far more than the actual Versailles reparations would have. After the Young Plan, they needed to come up with 26 billion dollars to pay it off completely, and they spent about 2.5 billion in 1937 in that year's dollars on rearmament alone (which was before all their military expenditures got REALLY insane), never mind all the other stupid stuff the Nazis spent money on. With a comparable level of effort to what France put into its indemnity, they could have paid it off in a short amount of time. They decided not to."
