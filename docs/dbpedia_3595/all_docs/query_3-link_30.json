By this time, Germany was dominated by Prussia.\n\nFrance strongly opposed Prussia’s further allegiance with other German countries.\n\nSince France opposed the nationalist endeavor of Prussia to unite Germany, Prussian officials speculated that a war between France and Germany was necessary.\n\nOtto von Bismarck, the Prime Minister of Prussia, believed that a war against France should be waged in order for German Unification to succeed.\n\nBismarck also knew that, with France as their opponent, the French aggression would only push southern German countries to side with Prussia, resulting in their superiority in terms of number.\n\nGermans also held a traditional view that France was the destabilizer of Europe.\n\nFORCES INVOLVED\n\nBelligerents\n\nThe German Empire was made up of the German countries of Baden, Bavaria, and Württemberg, along with the North German Confederation.\n\nThe French forces involved the French Empire and French Republic.\n\nLeaders\n\nNotable Leaders from the German Forces were:\n\nWilliam I\n\nOtto von Bismarck\n\nHelmuth von Moltke\n\nCrown Prince Friedrich\n\nPrince Friedrich Karl\n\nKarl F. von Steinmetz\n\nAlbrecht von Roon\n\nOn the French side, there was:\n\nNapoleon III\n\nFrançois A. Bazaine\n\nPatrice De MacMahon\n\nLouis Jules Trochu\n\nLeón Gambetta\n\nGiuseppe Garibaldi\n\nMilitary Forces and Casualties\n\nThe German Empire deployed a total of 1,494,412 soldiers in the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nCasualties totaled to 144,462\n\n44,700 dead\n\n89,732 wounded\n\n10,129 missing or captured\n\nThe French Empire deployed a total of 2,000,740 soldiers.\n\nCasualties totaled to 756,285\n\n138,871 dead\n\n143,000 wounded\n\n474,414 captured\n\nDURING THE WAR\n\nNo other nations intervened in the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nEven though Austria-Hungary and Denmark suffered recent defeat from Prussia and might want to avenge, they were not confident enough to side with France.\n\nNapoleon failed to form allegiances with the Russian Empire and United Kingdom, as Bismarck already deployed diplomatic efforts to these kingdoms.\n\nOne reason why the German army was superior was because of their apt usage of Prussian railroads.\n\nThe major battles that happened in mid-August of the Franco-Prussian War include:\n\nOccupation of Saarbrücken\n\nBattle of Wissembourg\n\nBattle of Spicheren\n\nBattle of Wörth\n\nBattle of Mars-La-Tour\n\nBattle of Gravelotte\n\nSiege of Metz\n\nBattle of Sedan\n\nThe Battle of Sedan, happened on September 1, 1871. It ended in the French defeat and the capture of Napoleon III.\n\nIt was led by the Prussian Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke.\n\nThe Prussians successfully encircled the French and broke their military line of defense.\n\n104,000 French soldiers were captured and imprisoned.\n\nThe Third French Republic was quickly established upon hearing of the fall of Napoleon III.\n\nTHE END OF FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR\n\nFamine ruled Paris, and the French government was forced to initiate peace talks.\n\nPeace talks began on January 24, 1871.\n\nCeasefire agreements were achieved.\n\nThe Germans successfully proposed a treaty.\n\nThe Germans were given Alsace-Lorraine, the German-speaking region of France.\n\nFrance was also made to recognize the German Empire.\n\nThis treaty was known as the Treaty of Frankfurt.\n\nFrench President Trochu resigned on January 25, 1871. He was replaced by Favre.\n\nAt Versailles, French President Favre signed the surrender on January 27, 1871.\n\nThe French Statesman León Gambetta heard the news and refused to surrender.
