        "text": "All European Union Member States are part of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and coordinate their economic policy-making to support the economic aims of the EU. However, a number of Member States have taken a step further by replacing their national currencies with the single currency – the euro. These Member States form the euro area.\n\nWhen the euro was first introduced in 1999 – as 'book' money –, the euro area was made up of 11 of the then 15 EU Member States. Greece joined in 2001, just one year before the cash changeover, followed by Slovenia in 2007, Cyprus and Malta in 2008, Slovakia in 2009, Estonia in 2011, Latvia in 2014, Lithuania in 2015 and Croatia in 2023. Today, the euro area numbers 20 EU Member States.\n\nOf the Member States outside the euro area, Denmark has an 'opt-out' from joining laid down in a Protocol annexed to the Treaty, although it can join in the future if it so wishes. Sweden has not yet qualified to be part of the euro area.\n\nThe remaining non-euro area Member States are among those which acceded to the Union in 2004, 2007 and 2013, after the euro was launched. At the time of their accession, they did not meet the necessary conditions for entry to the euro area, but have committed to joining as and when they meet them – they are Member States with a 'derogation', such as Sweden.\n\nAndorra, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City have adopted the euro as their national currency by virtue of specific monetary agreements with the EU, and may issue their own euro coins within certain limits. However, as they are not EU Member States, they are not part of the euro area."
