        "text": "It's an old service station, inhabited by a retired couple, on the edge of a small country road. With flowerbeds, garden gnomes and porcelain animals, it's hard to miss. But even more eye-catching are two large pictures hanging under the awning, where the gas pumps used to be. There are two reproductions of paintings depicting columns of soldiers and horses in a snowy landscape. Between them, a sign reads \"1871.\"\n\nSoldiers. 1871. What immediately comes to mind is the war between France and Germany. At the same time, it makes you wonder why the memory of this war should be kept alive here, in Les Verrières, a Swiss village of 650 inhabitants with no obvious connection to the conflict. To find out, the two pensioners who live here will be happy to give you a quick history lesson: \"See those houses, 100 meters away? That's where the border with France is. Well, in 1871, when the Prussians won the war, that's where General Bourbaki's retreating French army landed. And it was here, on the road in front of our house, that these unfortunate soldiers were taken in by the Swiss.\"\n\nIn Les Verrières, Daniel and Lucette Haldi are not the only ones to preserve the memory of this episode, which at best barely features in history books. As soon as you cross the border from France, you can't miss the roadside sign \"Bienvenue au Pays des Bourbaki\" (\"Welcome to Bourbaki country\"). A kilometer further on, a bistro offers \"Bourbaki beer,\" \"Bourbaki absinthe,\" \"Bourbaki jam\" and \"Bourbaki cookies.\" There's even a small museum where brochures advertise a \"Bourbaki educational trail,\" a one-hour walk marked by a dozen stops: the village's Protestant church, transformed for the occasion into a field hospital, a commemorative stone recalling that 33 French soldiers are buried here, a \"peace lime tree\" planted in 2013, a cart from the period and the house where, in the early hours of February 1, 1871, the agreement was signed allowing General Bourbaki's army to enter Switzerland on condition that they lay down their arms.\n\nIn all, some 88,000 French soldiers came into Switzerland between February 1 and 3, 1871. Surrounded by the Germans at Pontarlier, some 15 kilometers from the border, they had not been warned that the armistice signed on January 28 excluded the zone they were in, leading them to retreat hastily in the face of an enemy who was still fighting. As for General Charles Denis Bourbaki (1816-1897), he was no longer in a position to command his troops. On January 26, to avoid the dishonor of surrender, he tried to commit suicide by shooting himself in the head, but without success."
