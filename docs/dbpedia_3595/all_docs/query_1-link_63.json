        "text": "\" Travel back in time at the Museum of the Battle of August 6, 1870. Discover first-hand accounts of this painful period, which opened the way to the Vosges mountains and Paris for the German army. \"\n\nThis museum is entirely dedicated to the battle waged on the day of 6 August 1870. Recorded in history as the \"Battle of Reichshoffen\", it was in truth the battle of Froeschwiller for the french army and the battle of Woerth for the prussian army. Found on the battlefield, the majority of the items exhibited testify to France's painful past. A diorame of more than 4,000 tin figurines captures a moment in the battle in which so many courageous combatants gave good account of themselves.\n\nThough the documents, pictures and postcards... produced for the purposes of remembrance tourism, form an interesting part of the collection, the firearms, the bladed weapons, the uniforms, the helmets, the caps, the tools and the items necessary to the life of a soldier, form the lion's share.\n\nA French defeat that opened up the Vosges and thus Paris to the German coalition army, this battle resulted in the annexation of Alsace and Lorraine to Germany. Guided tours in French, German and English in the museum and outside on the battlefield."
