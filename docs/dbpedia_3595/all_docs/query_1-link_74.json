The fire had a lasting impact on the Forest Service and wildland firefighting.\n\nOrganizations and individuals from around the state and the nation, led by staff from the Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest, have come together to commemorate this anniversary. The Montana Historical Society participated by producing, in collaboration with other members of the planning committee, a pop-up banner exhibit on the fire. You can currently view the display at Ten Mile Brewery or the Helena Airport, and it will be transported to the different upcoming events. Click this link for more information.\n\nSaturday, August 10, 10:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m.\n\nGarden Party at the Original Governor's Mansion\n\n304 N Ewing St, Helena\n\nThe Montana Historical Society invites community members of all ages to attend a festive summer garden party at the Original Governor’s Mansion. Visitors will explore the historic house and grounds at their leisure while enjoying the beautiful tunes of local musicians including the Dearborn String Trio.\n\nThis house served Montana’s First Families from 1913 to 1959 and displays impressive Queen Anne-style architecture with furnishings and artifacts from the era. Brochures will be provided so that guests can discover the history of the house through a self-guided tour. Volunteers will be stationed on each floor to answer any questions that may arise.\n\nThe Mansion also has a lovely lawn where visitors will enjoy refreshments and admire the historic carriage house. Traditional lawn games such as ring toss and lawn bowling will keep the entire family entertained. Local musicians will be playing timeless music on the porch to complete the experience.\n\nPlease note that the Mansion is not ADA compliant. There are stairs to the front porch, with two flights of stairs inside the house.\n\nTuesday, August 20, 7:00 p.m.\n\nHome of Peace Cemetery Walking Tour\n\nHome of Peace Cemetery, Helena\n\nListed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Home of Peace Cemetery is the oldest active Jewish cemetery in Montana and is tangible evidence of this small but influential community, whose deceased members have been buried at the cemetery since 1867. The lives of Confederate States of America veterans, bankers and cattlemen, intellectuals and writers, hoteliers and schoolteachers, Masons, and Eastern Star members, hailing from Poland, Alsace-Lorraine, Germany, various towns in Montana Territory and the United States, will be presented and contextualized. The design of Jewish cemeteries and burial practices will also be discussed. Patty Dean, the tour presenter, is a regular contributor to the Montana Jewish Project’s social media biographical profiles and wrote her undergraduate thesis at Carroll College on Helena’s early Jewish community.\n\nFor more information and to register, visit this link. Capacity is limited."
