        "text": "The best reason to spend the next few weeks in the city: The Lincoln Center Festival — a month-long, seven-venue, multidisciplinary antidote to the summertime blues.\n\nAlan Cumming, indelible as the lascivious emcee of “Cabaret,” launches the festival tonight in an acclaimed one-man “Macbeth.”\n\nThe series has extra star power this year: Cate Blanchett, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Sinead O’Connor and composer John Adams, plus the Paris Opera Ballet, the world’s oldest national ensemble.\n\nFestival director Nigel Redden says that freedom — artistic license — is the festival’s chief advantage:\n\n“We are not bound by a particular art form, so that this year, for example, we are able to bring to New York one of the world’s greatest ballet companies performing a Baroque opera, an exquisite chamber opera by a major Chinese composer, a modern dance company and puppet troupe from China, and plays about what it means to be Irish by a writer who deserves more recognition in America,” says Redden.\n\n“At the same time, in this, our 17th year, we are happy to welcome back artists who have worked with us in the past, from Atom Egoyan, and Guo Wenjing, to National Theatre of Scotland, and the soprano Elizabeth Futral, who was with us for our first Festival in 1996.”\n\nTHEATER\n\nCumming’s one-man “Macbeth” is a National Theatre of Scotland production being directed by John Tiffany (“Once,” and “Black Watch”) and Andrew Goldberg.\n\nAs Cumming explains his enthusiasm for the Scottish play: “I have been obsessed with the play all my life. Speaking to John in New York, earlier this year, I had this idea I wanted to swap the roles of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, because there are so many things about gender in the play... So we did this reading like that, in New York, and Andrew suggested that I play all the parts, and I agreed.”\n\nSimultaneously, “Druid Murphy, The Plays of Tom Murphy,” a three-play retrospective devoted to one of Ireland’s most influential playwrights, will run tonight through July 12, presented by Galway’s Druid Theatre Company and performed by an ensemble of 17 actors in the Gerald Lynch Theater.\n\n“Hand Stories,” Chinese puppeteer Yeung Fa’s interwoven set of vignettes (employing traditional hand puppets, live and archival video) will play July 18-25 in the Clark Studio Theater.\n\nThe piece, developed at the Theatre Vidy-Lausanne in France, has video design by Taiwanese media artist Yilan Yeh and music by Australian composer Colin Offord.\n\nThe Sydney Theatre Company’s production of Chekhov’s “Uncle Vanya” arrives (with 10 performances at City Center, July 19-28) with the original cast intact: John Bell, Cate Blanchett, Sandy Gore, Hayley McElhinney, Anthony Phelan, Richard Roxburgh, Andrew Tighe, Jacki Weaver and Hugo Weaving.\n\nFor “In Paris,” August 1-5, dancer/choreographer Mikhail Baryshnikov will emote for the first time (on a New York stage) in his mother tongue, Russian.\n\nThe play, taken from a short story by Ivan Bunin, the first Russian to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1933, was adapted and directed by Russian director Dmitry Krymov.\n\nThe venue is the Gerald Lynch Theater at John Jay College.\n\nDANCE\n\nIn the city’s dance-crazed enclaves, feverish excitement is preceding the 11-day stay (July 11-22) of the Paris Opera Ballet, performing at the David A. Koch Theater.\n\nThe company is bringing five repertory productions, including the U.S. premiere of choreographer Pina Bausch’s dance opera “Orpheus and Eurydice” to music by C.W. Gluck. The late Ms. Bausch was the founder of the Tnanztheater Wuppertal, a much beloved ensemble.\n\nAlso on the POB sked: three one-act ballets by celebrated French choreographers and composers (Serge Lifar’s Suite en blanc, with music by Édouard Lalo; Roland Petit’s L’Arlésienne, with music by Georges Bizet; and Maurice Béjart’s Boléro, with music by Maurice Ravel).\n\n“Giselle,” choreographed by Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot, had its world debut at the Paris Opera Ballet in 1841. Six performances of its current production are planned. Bejing’s TAO Dance Theater, often touted as the top contemporary dance ensemble in China, has just two shows, July 25 and 27, at Alice Tully Hall.\n\nBoth full-evening programs have numbers for titles. “2,” is “a duet developed from the rhythms of the spoken word.” “4,” the company’s newest work, “is described as a high-impact and intensely physical piece for four women.”\n\nMUSIC\n\nOn July 11, composer John Adams will lead members of the Juilliard Orchestra and London’s Royal Academy Orchestra in “Feste Romane,” (Respighi); Ravel’s Piano Concerto in G major with soloist Imogen Cooper; and his own “City Noir,” a symphony inspired by the Hollywood’s ‘noir’ films of the late forties and early fifties.\n\nThe 8 p.m. concert will be performed in Avery Fisher Hall\n\nThe festival periodically celebrates musicians (Ornette Coleman in 1997; Philip Glass in 2001 and Elvis Costello in 2004). This year’s awardee is the guitarist, vocalist and songwriter Curtis Mayfield, composer of “Gypsy Woman,” “People Get Ready,” and the score of “Superfly.”\n\nLincoln Center and the artist's estate (he died in 1999 at 57) are collaborating on “Tribute: Curtis Mayfield,” July 20 at 8 p.m. in Avery Fisher, with an all-star lineup: Sinéad O’Connor, Bilal, Meshell Ndegeocello, William Bell, Ryan Montbleau, Inyang Bassey, The Impressions, Mavis Staples, Aloe Blacc, Kyp Malone and Tunde Adebimpe, Dr. Lonnie Smith and a 14-piece house band led by music director Binky Griptite of the Dap-Kings.\n\nOPERA\n\n“Émilie,” a 75-minute work by Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho and Lebanese librettist Amin Malouf about the French Enlightenment figure Émilie de Chetelet (1706 – 1749) will play July 19, 21 and 22 at the Lynch Theater, starring Soprano Elizabeth Futral in the title role.\n\nAs the opera begins. Emile, 42, is pregnant with her fourth child and abandoned by her lover. She knows that she will most likely not survive the birth. In her day Chetelet was a much respected mathematician and woman of letters."
