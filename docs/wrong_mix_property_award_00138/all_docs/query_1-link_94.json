        "text": "The paper offers a close reading of \"The Case of Cornet Elagin” (1925; published in 1926), which is so far lacking in Bunin scholarship. \"The Case\" was written as a semi-documentary, semi-fictional account of the 1891 trial of Aleksandr Bartenev (in the story renamed Alexander Elagin), accused of murdering Maria Wisnowska (renamed Maria Sosnovskaia). This paper is an attempt to distinguish between its fictional and non-fictional components by showing how \"The Case\" fuses real facts with various ready-made sub-plots taken from Russian and French literature. What is more, intertextual analysis of these fictional episodes reveals the implicit message of the novella. Several months before his death Bunin inscribed the following enigmatic words on a copy of \"The Case\" published decades before: \"This whole story is a very ugly story.\" The paper is an attempt to understand what is so “ugly” about this novella. The answer is sought by contextualizing \"The Case\" within Bunin’s poetic world and within the intellectual context of the Silver Age. \"The Case\" emerges as the author’s masterful commentary on traditional and modern themes involving mimetic desire and post-Pushkinian “Cleopatromania.” Bunin subjects the worship of a femme fatale, so pervasive in the Silver Age, to radical subversion.\n\nThe article examines the literary fate of the famous Russian writer, Nobel Prize winner Ivan Bunin, a bright face of Russian émigré literature, and his place in the first wave of Russian émigré literature. It is noted that the work of Ivan Bunin, one of the last magnates of classical Russian literature, has almost always been in the focus of literary criticism. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, especially in the post-Soviet space, the writer's work is involved in research from all sides, his works are carefully studied. The article touches upon the life and work of the writer who, after the October Revolution, went abroad, not reconciling with the new ideology. In the first years of emigration, it was emphasized that the controversy surrounding his work, as well as the critical views of proletarian critics and bourgeois literary critics, could not overshadow Bunin's work. It is noted that throughout his creative activity I. Bunin continued the traditions of classical Russian literature, enriched world literature with many priceless works. He created artistic images of his contemporaries-people of all social strata, both in prerevolutionary Russia and in emigration. As a writer and intellectual, Bunin senses the types of people who play an important role in the destinies of Russia and the world, and represents them in his works. His prose is also distinguished by harmony, fluidity, rhythm, artistic perfection, expressive means and mysterious descriptions. Moreover, since the 1990s, a lot of research has been carried out on the turbulent life and rich creative path of the writer, but \"unexplored pages\" of Bunin's personality and work have remained. There are still unexplored pages of his work as a master of the word, who conquered the heights of literature and left his name in world literature.\n\nThere are many perspectives that we may adopt when writing a history of literary theory and criticism and, in general, a history of literary thought. One of the approaches that I consider stimulating is the mapping of personal relationships between various literary scholars.The study deals with the relationship between two literary scholars: Jan Mukařovský and Roman Jakobson. The study analyses their transformation in the broad context of their life and work, but also in the context of the political and cultural events that took place during their lifetime. The central point of the study is an outline of the epistemological basis of Mukařovský ́s and Jakobson ́s structural poetics. Five key theoretical and methodological principles are: 1) A work of art is a sui generisphenomenon; 2) The principle of whole and part; 3) Movement. Literature is in constant motion; 4) Working with (literary) material; 5) A work of art is a sign. Art is a system of signs. (continua na p. 1)"
