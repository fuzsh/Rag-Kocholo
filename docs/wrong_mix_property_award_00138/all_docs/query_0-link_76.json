        "text": "Aleksandr Sergeevich Pushkin (1799-1837) Review 1..docx\n\nAleksandr Sergeevich Pushkin (1799-1837) Review 1..docxnettletondevon\n\nAleksandr Sergeevich Pushkin (1799-1837) Review 1. In 1799, Aleksandr Sergeevich Pushkin was born into an aristocratic family in Russia’s ancient capital of Moscow. His father and paternal uncle were descendants of ancient Russian aristocracy. Pushkin’s mother was a descendant of a Moor from Africa whom Tsar Peter the Great had brought to his court, then educated to become an officer in the Russian Army. Heavily under the influence of 18th-century French language and culture, they spent long hours reading French poetry (Russian was the language of the serfs), often in the presence of young Aleksandr. Pushkin’s nurse, a serf woman by the name of Arina Rodionovna, spoke to him in the Russian language used by non-aristocrats at that time. She had a vast store of folk poetry that she would recite to him for long stretches. 2. St. Petersburg was founded in 1703 by a Russian tsar, Peter the Great. By the end of the 19th century, it became the center of an expanding empire, a city of great mansions and glorious residences, and a glittering jewel of Russian and European culture. 3. In the beginning of 19th century, tsar Aleksandr I established a new school for the young aristocrats, the Lyceum (located at Tsarskoe Selo – The Tsars’ Village – near St. Petersburg). Among its first group of highly talented youths from Moscow came Aleksandr Pushkin. At the Lyceum, the staff, who numbered among the finest teachers in aristocratic Russia, did not take long to realize that they had a genius on their hands - as well as one of the most mischievous and sometimes ungovernable brats in Russia. 4. Pushkin’s schoolmates, many of them future famous leaders in Russia, found in him a loyal and staunch friend, although one with a passionate and unpredictable temper. Neither did it take long for Pushkin’s brilliant poetry to be recognized, in the Lyceum and beyond. 5. When this talented but rebellious and mischievous youth came out of school into the supercharged aristocratic life of early19th-century St. Petersburg, he showed neither interest nor promise as a “top-drawer” bureaucrat. During his absences from work, he spent a great deal of time at the gambling tables, balls, theaters, and, most especially, the ballet. At a theatrical performance, he circulated the portrait of a famous French assassin of a high-ranking aristocrat. The caption, in Pushkin’s handwriting, read: “A lesson to tsars!” 6. When this episode inevitably came to the attention of the St. Petersburg chief of police, Pushkin did not remain long in the Russian capital. He was exiled, first to the southwest, to the town of Kishinev in Bessarabia, near present-day Romania, then to Odessa and Mikhailovskoye, Pushkin’s exile lasted for six years including – virtually, his entire youth. When Pushkin was leaving the capital, his first long poèma, “Ruslan and Liudmila” (based on the Russian fair tales and folk motifs) was being prep.\n\n0mihai_eminescu_2.ppt\n\n0mihai_eminescu_2.pptFlaviu17\n\nMihai Eminescu (Romanian pronunciation: [miˈhaj emiˈnesku] (listen); born Mihail Eminovici; 15 January 1850 – 15 June 1889) was a Romanian Romantic poet from Moldavia, novelist, and journalist, generally regarded as the most famous and influential Romanian poet. Eminescu was an active member of the Junimea literary society and worked as an editor for the newspaper Timpul (\"The Time\"), the official newspaper of the Conservative Party (1880–1918).[2] His poetry was first published when he was 16 and he went to Vienna, Austria to study when he was 19. The poet's manuscripts, containing 46 volumes and approximately 14,000 pages, were offered by Titu Maiorescu as a gift to the Romanian Academy during the meeting that was held on 25 January 1902.[3] Notable works include Luceafărul (The Vesper/The Evening Star/The Lucifer/The Daystar), Odă în metru antic (Ode in Ancient Meter), and the five Letters (Epistles/Satires). In his poems, he frequently used metaphysical, mythological and historical subjects. His father was Gheorghe Eminovici, an aristocrat from Bukovina, which was then part of the Austrian Empire (while his grandfather came from Banat). He crossed the border into Moldavia, settling in Ipotești, near the town of Botoșani. He married Raluca Iurașcu, an heiress of an old noble family. In a Junimea register, Eminescu wrote down his birthday date as 22 December 1849, while in the documents of Cernăuți Gymnasium, where Eminescu studied, his birth date is 15 January 1850. Nevertheless, Titu Maiorescu, in his work Eminescu and His Poems (1889) quoted N. D. Giurescu's research and adopted his conclusion regarding the date and place of Mihai Eminescu's birth, as being 15 January 1850, in Botoșani. This date resulted from several sources, among which there was a file of notes on christenings from the archives of the Uspenia (Princely) Church of Botoșani; inside this file, the date of birth was \"15 January 1850\" and the date of christening was the 21st of the same month. The date of his birth was confirmed by the poet's elder sister, Aglae Drogli, who affirmed that the place of birth was the village of Ipotești, Botoșani County.[4]Mihail (as he appears in baptismal records) or Mihai (the more common form of the name that he used) was born in Botoșani, Moldavia. He spent his early childhood in Botoșani and Ipotești, in his parents family home. From 1858 to 1866 he attended school in Cernăuți. He finished 4th grade as the 5th of 82 students, after which he attended two years of gymnasium. The first evidence of Eminescu as a writer is in 1866. In January of that year Romanian teacher Aron Pumnul died and his students in Cernăuţi published a pamphlet, Lăcrămioarele învățăceilor gimnaziaști (The Tears of the Gymnasium Students) in which a poem entitled La mormântul lui Aron Pumnul (At the Grave of Aron Pumnul) appears, signed \"M. Eminovici\". On 25 February his poem De-aș avea (If I Had) was published in Iosif Vulcan's literary magazine Familia in Pest."
