        "text": "John Galsworthy Born: August 14, 1867\n\nKingston, Surrey, England Died: January 31 1933 (aged 65)\n\nLondon, England Occupation(s): Writer Nationality: English\n\nJohn Galsworthy (August 14, 1867 – January 31, 1933) was an English novelist and playwright. Notable works include The Forsyte Saga (1906–1921) and its sequels, A Modern Comedy and End of the Chapter. Galsworthy's novels addressed the class system in England, especially the rise of the merchant class, or \"new money,\" and its relations to the aristocracy, or \"old money.\" In the wake of the Industrial Revolution and urbanization, Galsworthy's works reflected the inevitable conflicts that arose during the transition from a more pastoral society to a modern one. He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1932.\n\nBiography\n\nGalsworthy was born at Kingston Hill in Surrey, England, into an established wealthy family, the son of John and Blanche Bailey (nee Bartleet) Galsworthy. He attended Harrow and New College, Oxford, training as a barrister and was called to the bar in 1890. However, he was not interested in practicing law and instead traveled abroad to look after the family's shipping business interests. During these travels he met Joseph Conrad, then the first mate of a sailing-ship moored in the harbor of Adelaide, Australia, and the two future novelists became close friends. In 1895, Galsworthy began an affair with Ada Nemesis Pearson, the wife of one of his cousins. After her divorce the pair eventually married on September 23, 1905, and stayed together until his death in 1933. During World War I, he worked in a hospital in France as an orderly after being passed over for military service. John Galsworthy lived for the final seven years of his life at Bury in West Sussex. He died from a brain tumor at his London home, Grove Lodge, Hampstead. In accordance with his will he was cremated at Woking, and his ashes scattered over the South Downs from the air.[1] There is also a memorial in Highgate \"New\" Cemetery.[2]\n\nLiterary Works\n\nFrom the Four Winds was Galsworthy's first published work in 1897, a collection of short stories. These, and several subsequent works, were published under the pen name John Sinjohn, and it would not be until The Island Pharisees (1904) that he would begin publishing under his own name, probably owing to the death of his father. His first play, The Silver Box (1906), became a success, and he followed it up with The Man of Property (1906), the first in the Forsyte trilogy. Although he continued writing both plays and novels, it was as a playwright that he was mainly appreciated at the time. Along with other writers of the time, such as Shaw, his plays addressed the class system and social issues; two of his best known plays were Strife (1909) and The Skin Game (1920).\n\nOver time his reputation shifted; he is now far better known for his novels and particularly The Forsyte Saga, the first of three trilogies of novels about the eponymous family and connected lives. These books, as with many of his other works, dealt with class, and in particular upper-middle class lives. Although sympathetic to his characters, he highlights their insular, snobbish, and acquisitive attitudes and their suffocating moral codes. He is viewed as one of the first writers of the Edwardian era; challenging in his works some of the ideals of society depicted in the proceeding literature of Victorian England. The depiction of a woman in an unhappy marriage furnishes another recurring theme in his work. The character of Irene in The Forsyte Saga is drawn from Ada Pearson even though her previous marriage was not as miserable as Irene's.\n\nHis work is often less convincing when it deals with the changing face of wider British society and how it affects people of the lower social classes. Through his writings he campaigned for a variety of causes, including prison reform, women's rights, animal welfare, and censorship, but these have limited appeal outside the era in which they were written.\n\nLegacy\n\nHe was elected as the first president of the International PEN literary club in 1921, was appointed to the Order of Merit in 1929—after earlier turning down a knighthood—and was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1932.\n\nThe popularity of his fiction waned quickly after his death, but the hugely successful adaptation of The Forsyte Saga in 1967 renewed interest in the writer.\n\nA number of John Galsworthy's letters and papers are held at the University of Birmingham Special Collections.\n\nAdaptations\n\nThe Forsyte Saga has been filmed several times:\n\nThat Forsyte Woman (1949), directed by Compton Bennett, an MGM adaptation in which Errol Flynn played a rare villainous role, as Soames.\n\nBBC television drama (1967), directed by James Cellan Jones, David Giles, starring Eric Porter, Nyree Dawn Porter, Kenneth More, Susan Hampshire, Joseph O'Conor, adapted by Lennox Philips and others, 26 parts.\n\nGranada television drama (2002), directed by Christopher Menaul, starring Gina McKee, Damian Lewis, Rupert Graves, Corin Redgrave, 13 parts.\n\nThe Skin Game was adapted and directed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1931. It starred VC France, Helen Haye, Jill Esmond, Edmund Gwenn, John Longden.\n\nEscape was filmed in 1930 and 1948. The latter was directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, starring Rex Harrison, Peggy Cummings, William Hartnell. The screenplay was by Philip Dunne.\n\nOne More River (a film version of Galsworthy's Over the River) was filmed by James Whale in 1934. The film starred Frank Lawton, Colin Clive (one of Whale's most frequently used actors), and Diana Wynyard. It also featured Mrs. Patrick Campbell in a rare sound film appearance.\n\nSelected works\n\nFrom The Four Winds, 1897 (as John Sinjohn)\n\nJocelyn, 1898 (as John Sinjohn)\n\nVilla Rubein, 1900 (as John Sinjohn)\n\nA Man Of Devon, 1901 (as John Sinjohn)\n\nThe Island Pharisees, 1904\n\nThe Silver Box, 1906 (his first play)\n\nThe Forsyte Saga, 1906-21, 1922\n\nThe Man Of Property, 1906\n\n(interlude) Indian Summer of a Forsyte, 1918\n\nIn Chancery, 1920\n\n(interlude) Awakening, 1920\n\nTo Let, 1921\n\nThe Country House, 1907\n\nA Commentary, 1908\n\nFraternity, 1909\n\nA Justification For The Censorship Of Plays, 1909\n\nStrife, 1909\n\nFraternity, 1909\n\nJoy, 1909\n\nJustice, 1910\n\nA Motley, 1910\n\nThe Spirit Of Punishment, 1910\n\nHorses In Mines, 1910\n\nThe Patrician, 1911\n\nThe Little Dream, 1911\n\nThe Pigeon, 1912\n\nThe Eldest Son, 1912\n\nMoods, Songs, And Doggerels, 1912\n\nFor Love Of Beasts, 1912\n\nThe Inn Of Tranquility, 1912\n\nThe Dark Flower, 1913\n\nThe Fugitive, 1913\n\nThe Mob, 1914\n\nThe Freelands, 1915\n\nThe Little Man, 1915\n\nA Bit's Love, 1915\n\nA Sheaf, 1916\n\nThe Apple Tree, 1916\n\nBeyond, 1917\n\nFive Tales, 1918\n\nSaint's Progress, 1919\n\nAddresses In America, 1912\n\nThe Foundations, 1920\n\nIn Chancery, 1920\n\nAwakening, 1920\n\nThe Skin Game, 1920\n\nTo Let, 1920\n\nA Family Man, 1922\n\nThe Little Man, 1922\n\nLoyalties, 1922\n\nWindows, 1922\n\nCaptures, 1923\n\nAbracadabra, 1924\n\nThe Forest, 1924\n\nOld English, 1924\n\nThe Show, 1925\n\nEscape, 1926\n\nVerses New And Old, 1926\n\nCastles In Spain, 1927\n\nA Modern Comedy, 1924-1928, 1929\n\nThe White Monkey, 1924\n\n(Interlude) a Silent Wooing, 1927\n\nThe Silver Spoon, 1926\n\n(Interlude) Passers By, 1927\n\nSwan Song, 1928\n\nTwo Forsyte Interludes, 1927\n\nThe Manaton Edition, 1923-26 (collection, 30 vols.)\n\nExiled, 1929\n\nThe Roof, 1929\n\nOn Forsyte Change, 1930\n\nTwo Essays On Conrad, 1930\n\nSoames And The Flag, 1930\n\nThe Creation Of Character In Literature, 1931 (The Romanes Lecture for 1931).\n\nMaid In Waiting, 1931\n\nForty Poems, 1932\n\nFlowering Wilderness, 1932\n\nOver the River, 1933\n\nAutobiographical Letters Of Galsworthy: A Correspondence With Frank Harris, 1933\n\nThe Grove Edition, 1927-34 (collection, 27 Vols.)\n\nCollected Poems, 1934\n\nEnd Of the Chapter, 1931-1933, 1934 (posthumously)\n\nMaid In Waiting, 1931\n\nFlowering Wilderness, 1932\n\nOne More River, 1933 (originally the English edition was called Over the River)\n\nPunch And Go, 1935\n\nThe Life And Letters, 1935\n\nThe Winter Garden, 1935\n\nForsytes, Pendyces And Others, 1935\n\nSelected Short Stories, 1935\n\nGlimpses And Reflections, 1937\n\nGalsworthy's Letters To Leon Lion, 1968\n\nLetters From John Galsworthy 1900-1932, 1970\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nISBN links support NWE through referral fees\n\nMarrot, Harold Vincent.
