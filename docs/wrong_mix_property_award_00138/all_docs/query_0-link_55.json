        "text": "Bibliography (and more)\n\nBelow is a full bibliography for The Secret History of Vladimir Nabokov. Before the bibliography is a space set aside for clarifications or corrections on the printed text, and a separate section listing Nabokov sites I've found useful or interesting. If you have a site you'd like to see included on this list, please email it to me, noting any especially interesting aspects.\n\nDigital Nabokoviana\n\nThe Nabokov Musuem (in St. Petersburg)\n\nNabokov family tree\n\nNabokov homes and haunts\n\nZembla\n\nNABOKV-L, the Vladimir Nabokov Listserv\n\nNabokov Online Journal\n\nKeys to The Gift\n\nAda, annotated\n\nClarifications/omissions/errata\n\n2/18/13 – noted by the author - page 99 - “soon to be called Glory”: “soon” should read “eventually.”\n\n2/18/13 – noted by the author - page 100 - “pretends to be Swiss”: it may be worth clarifying that Martin is one-quarter Swiss, but his identity is fully Russian.\n\n2/18/13 – noted by the author – page 162 – “filled out their declarations of intent”: Before disembarking, the Nabokovs did on their immigration paperwork declare their intent to stay in the U.S. permanently, but they did not sign the forms titled “Declaration of Intention” until later that same year.\n\n2/26/13 – Acknowledgments: A (regrettably missed) thank you to D.

File starts from April 1943 and continues through July 1948, then picks for several final pages covering April to June 1967. Includes background check information from Nicholas’ intelligence work during the war, as well as a more in-depth Cold War investigation.\n\nEdmund Wilson – File #105-177115 This portion of Wilson’s FBI file deals with just an investigation of whether or not Wilson attended a 1968 Cultural Congress in Havana, Cuba.

Information on Sonia Slonim’s immigration, name change request, and eventual US citizenship. Some of this information already written up/posted here.\n\nCarl Junghans - A File A-7595300. Over 300 pages, this file details Junghans’ relations with USDOJ-INS on questions of deportation, alien registration, internment and visa status from 1941 to 1950. (Another FOIA is still in process for the 1950s and 1960s information on Junghans). Some information already written up/posted here.\n\nUS National Archives and Records Administration\n\nCarl Junghans – Record Group 60, Department of Justice, Entry UD UP 5 “World War II Alien Enemy Detention and Internment Case Files, 1941-1952″ – Case File # 146-13-2-12-771 – Stack Location 230/25/06/05 – Box 119.

In order to let spelunkers more easily dive into this material, where The New York Times covered a given story, I have cited its version, which can be accessed electronically without charge at most public libraries in the United States.\n\nI reviewed many of Nabokov's draft manuscripts, journals, and letters in the holdings of the Berg Collection at the New York Public Library and the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress, but did not always cite the primary source in my book. In situations where Andrew Field, Brian Boyd, or Stacy Schiff had already covered a matter in the Nabokovs' lives in one of the biographies, I often cited their reference(s) to a given conversation or incident in my endnotes, both to acknowledge their work and to inform readers about other already-published accounts that would not require them to visit or gain access to (in some cases) restricted archives.\n\n“2 Nazi Airmen Slain in Canadian Break,” NYT, April 22, 1941, 3.\n\n“28 Nazi Fliers Tunnel to Liberty in Canada,” NYT, April 20, 1941, 1.\n\n“30 Children Join Picnic of Nations,” NYT, July 20, 1959, 12.\n\n“66 Are Executed by Soviet, Accused of Terrorist Plots,” NYT, Dec. 6, 1934, 1.\n\nAbarinov, Vladimir, The Murderers of Katyn, Hippocrene Books: New York, 1993.\n\nAbraham, Richard, Alexander Kerensky, Columbia University Press: New York, 1990.\n\nAction on Dissident Protested in Soviet,” NYT, March 13, 1968, 6.\n\nAdams, J.
