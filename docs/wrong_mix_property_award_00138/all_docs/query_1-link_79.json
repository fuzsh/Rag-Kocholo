        "text": "The translators maxim what you look for, that is what you find has a thousand meanings, so I am going to share with you a random episode that belongs to the phenomena translators keep secret rather than boast of.\n\nThe editor of a literary periodical, which cherishes the love story column, called me recently and asked for a Russian translation, but the story should be no longer than one page.\n\nThinking it over, I reached for the (old, Soviet) edition of the Nobel Prize winner Ivan Bunin, sure to find what I needed there. The discrete but quite intensive erotics of his stories deserves the steady reputation of classics in the genre.\n\nWhile reading, I neglected my deadlines and understood more clearly than ever before that Bunins stories are really rather uniform: he (more seldom, she) after some accidental impulse, reconstructs the details of first love.\n\nThis is especially true of the book Dark Alleys, written in Paris, 1937-1944, a real encyclopedia of first love dramas. The book contained a short novella, Wolves, which suited me by its length. I started translating  like a participant in a blind date. It did not take long just to type the translation while reading the original. Less than half an hour.\n\nHowever, the result was disappointing. I had a helpless collection of details in front of me, some kind of a troubled pastorale, full of white, red and black chromatic spots, without a distinctly formed eros of speech. The basic narrative suspense was reduced to two youngsters riding in a cart at night and the girls fear of wolves, which actually appeared in the end, in the middle of a sudden forest fire. The girl took the reins and successfully maneuvered through the ambush of fire and beasts, but she was hurt and permanently scarred.\n\nIs it possible that a Nobel Prize winner (the story was written in 1940) could write such confusion on the page? Then the telephone rang again. This time the editor of a childrens magazine asked for a shorter Russian story. Without thinking I sent him this short-tailed translation (which, by the way, soon appeared with a pretty illustration). It seems that we all behaved according to the prejudice that the world of children is simplified and confused. If a good adult book is not good for a child (Justejn Gorder), a bad one may serve the purpose...\n\nAnd then I returned to the original. I took out, from my innermost pocket, completely different, interactive glasses. And suddenly, as if through a microscope, Bunins prose starts to swarm with different forms of expression and highly allusive symbolism.\n\nIt is considered that in translating prose the sound picture is not necessarily in the foreground, but in reality this is not so. Bunins prose resounded in its hollow rhythms, which skillfuly conveyed the supressed. As in real poetry, the prosodic components diluted the concentration of details in a scant space...\n\nArriving at the centre of a unique fragrant event, captured in a polyphonic whirlpool, I catch the runners of hinted meanings, I communicate with the untranslatable residue that is available only in an inspired, admiring reading, and not at all in fulfillment of a daily routine. Receiving an artistic message (in translation as well as the original) is never the same with different persons; moreover, at a different time, the same person can react in a different way. My mood influences the message substantially!\n\nHaving finally read it in an adult way, I calmly sent the translation, without any change, to the obscure adult column as well. I hope the readers enjoyed its erotic charge. It is not always compulsory to know whom we translate for, but that assumed echo is essential, even if it is a posteriori. A translator, namely, does not only receive but also sends a message, so that he or she can also expect complex reactions, restricted by the authors competence.\n\nA propos of some return signals about that double translation with a severe erotic display, I cite a keen comment from the poet Radivoj Sajtinac, who sent me word: Thank you for Bunin. You laced it up well. He read the first, juvenile version, burdened with the translators guilty conscience. Sajtinacs comment, which presents a skilled reader as well as a writer, and above all an unselfish man in personal communication, led me to share this episode with you. It seems that you cannot hide anything from a true reader\n\nReading is a fact that frees the text from the matter of words and leads it to the current life (good old H. R. Jaus). It is especially so when we consider a rematerialized translators reading, which can result in the change of a texts intention (launching hard Bunin in a childrens magazine).\n\nThis episode (which does no credit to the translators honour) indicates that the attitude towards a receiver is not just a survey of his wishes, but a thoughtless gesture, not always in the readers interest. The translator is the one who is caught as an unfit receiver. The translator is the one who stepped across the threshold of the translators action, keeping the original form but menacing the readers benefit. I blushed with shame before the desecrated innocence of the children. The makeup examination of readdressing the text was a relief. After a certain delay, I felt myself capable of opening the poetry of Bunins prose.\n\nA threatening atmosphere of uncertainty, running out of control. Is not the very title Wolves and the episode with a sheep full of ominous predictions? Matches like the simulation of a controlled fire, flirting instead of passion, and all that as a symbol of destructive fire of sensual power, hanging over from all sides. It can be seen that these are Red Riding Hood and the Wolf from Her inexperience joined with the utmost boldness as well as from His teriomorphic portrait (the lean, bony face of a high school boy). The landscape configuration supports the roles of the partners being taken on. The leitmotiv of wolves confirms Bunins supposition that the world is clearly divided into those who are plunder and the others, who are greedily disposed. While the former are under the sign of the natural and innocent, the latter are dangerous in their insincerety (like hot red currant syrup). The wolf is the one who becomes a heraldic custodian of a/the primeval emotional scenario. Through that ghostly messenger a dialogue was established with the mythological text, lasting from time immemorial. The burnt roof, compared to the book covers, directs us to the big codex, in which everybody wins according to merit...\n\nMythologizing a bit, Bunin brings us to the closeness of archetype psychology. The mechanisms of the unconscious equalize with the principles of a mythological understanding of reality, not without a recognizable folkloric ritualism.\n\nLove, however, is a matter that does not stay, either in strong female or in weak male hands. That is why every story of Bunins is a story of death of love, literal and metaphoric. He simply offers his characters no chance to fight for their relaxation and comfort, to combine love and everyday life. All our lives we are followed by sensual, physiological, scarred remembrances of love as a supreme judge of human relationships. Mentioning the moments of pouring out such a remembrance, with the flower of melancholic epiphany, Bunin unintrusively favours euphemism for the loss of chastity. The story Wolves is dedicated to the creation of such a transformed, bright, nostalgic remembrance of a thing that happens only once in life. And that is why the author can say that for those she loved many times in her life, there was nothing more dear than that scar, which resembled a permanent mild smiling.\n\nIn order to make this translators footnote more complete, I will share with you the extension of my dance with wolves: there was a poem in my mailbox just written by Irina Mashinski, entitled Wolf...\n\nIt seemed to me methodically worthwhile to compare the same metaphor in the two texts, which shape the sequences of one and the same mythopoetic happening. Having the impression of finding an addition to Bunins lyrical prose, I also translated a poem, this time immediately but without haste, as often happens with the translation (and writing?) of poetry, when the sound picture is the one that directs a bundle of possible, often distant, associating meanings.\n\nThere is one more version of the same story, about eternal love-hate. Let us imagine a lonely hero who wanders through an inhospitable landscape, in a barking sponday of steps-moves of Russian orthoepy (sag  sah), with the neurotic reflex of a chased beast. If she makes brilliant moves why is there always a checkmate menace, as if the heroine is wondering. The winding running looks like a steady pursuit and escape, but the checkmate is delayed very far, as the wolf is simply uncatchable*...\n\nThat metaphor is now being used for a beloved man; the emotional omen is completely opposite in relation to Bunins Wolves! Aggression and inertness, the greedy one and the prey change places, this time in the background of the mytheme of Adam and Eve.\n\nWe are on the very border of self-identification, reaching the initial wholeness, which preceded the creation of Eve with her original sin. It is not by chance that this remythologization of the wolf was realized in the infantile, naive visual style of Henri Rousseau, with a contour aura of night and moonshine. The whole woodcut contains ice as well as transparency and glow and the sharpness of dark waters, similar to obsidian layers. The crack of a ribbed spring lies under the inner charge of complex, essentially antagonistic, agonized feelings. Mashinskis poem unwillingly celebrates the moral codex (hard is the law, too many letters) of nomadic, unsettled rootless manliness. In the return of the heroine to such a native scar (pure twin, the axis-bristles of my life) there is an innovative, neither Darwinian nor Biblical, evolution-creation.\n\nPresumably it is the impulse of return to her own self, to ones own Animus. For: is there in reality so fine an Adamic, manly loneliness that is marked as feminine? If we speak about the wolf, then is it about us (or the Animus), and if it is about the fox, then it is about the Other, or Anima? In the syntax of this poem the scattered grain of released first person singular pronouns, insubordinated by normative grammar, testifies about that.\n\nThe game of a beater and a chased one is finished, it is time to return to the primogeniture of ones own soul, to something terribly lonely, terrible and lonely.\n\nThis is a poem about the most personal and therefore the most general theme, as is always the case in true literature. A most precious amalgam with which the talented are immediately successful. Nevertheless, the author was surprised by my reading. Her wolf had his baptismal masculine name, the poem was created as a talented expression of feminine resentment. Exchanging our readings, we came to a certain competition. We each held irreconcilably to our opinions, followed by obligatory compliments. Your poem is marvelous. Your translation is fine.\n\nDoes the translator, consequently, have the right to be unfaithful to the original intention, to develop the other potential of the text, to place the accents differently, to be partial to his own implanted meaning? The sender (author) surely has his communicative intention, but the secondary sender (translator) can have one as well. Replacement of the original language by the target language is sometimes the replacement of original intentions by target intentions. We are speaking of the moment when the translators interpretation passes to semi-intentional, giving the meaning independently from the intentions of the primary sender, and for which meaning there is a foundation in the very text. May the translator arbitrarily liberate the original from its basic instincts, annulling the fundamental (un)certainty of the original? Or does the original unerringly find its way to the addressee, in spite of these coauthors efforts?\n\nAt moments of sincere auto-mistifying exaltation, the translator wants to believe that everything is not lost, that there is something to be found in the translation. While the readers orientation is first of all one of obtaining and procuring, does the translator, having taken, immediately return his or her debt to literature, sometimes with a rich interest rate? Let us agree on the following: the materialization of the reading following straight after the authors is full of countless, not only dangerous but also salutary maybes...\n\n* The authors kind epistolary autocomments are in italics"
