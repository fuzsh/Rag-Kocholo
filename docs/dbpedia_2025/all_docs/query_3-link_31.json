        "text": "1967\n\nEven through the haze of smoke in the dimly lit lounge, Sam Ybarra\n\nglimpsed Ken Green as he walked through the door. “Kenny, over\n\nhere!” shouted Ybarra over the music blaring from a tape deck.\n\nMeeting, the two friends hugged as the other soldiers looked up from\n\ntheir beers and shot glasses.\n\nIt had been nearly a year since they arrived in Vietnam, and this\n\nwas one of the few weekends the two could meet on a break. They’d\n\nbeen waiting it out, and now at long last it was time to down beers\n\nand later slip into the brothels that lined the streets of Kontum.\n\nGreen introduced Sam to two buddies, Leon Fletcher and Ed Beck. For\n\ndays, Ken had been telling them about his time with “Crazy\n\nSam”-cruising the streets of Globe, Arizona, in Green’s blue 1964\n\nChevelle SS, guzzling Ripple with the Rolling Stones’ “Satisfaction”\n\ncrackling over the radio. And now, in this sad and near corner of\n\nSoutheast Asia, the two old friends were together again.\n\nTo most people, they were as opposite as they were close: Green was\n\nboyish, good-looking, and cocky-the type of guy who could turn heads\n\nin a crowded room. Ybarra was dark skinned, with a round, pockmarked\n\nface-awkwardly shy unless he was drinking. But for all their\n\ndifferences, they shared something in common: they were constantly\n\nin trouble.\n\nGreen was known for his temper-quick to start fights with other\n\nstudents at Globe High School, regardless of their age and size.\n\nThough he stood only five feet, five inches, he rarely backed down.\n\nEveryone knew to stay away from him. As a junior, Green had brutally\n\nattacked another student who was a year older and a foot taller for\n\nlooking at him the wrong way in the hallway. Dozens of classmates\n\nwatched in horror as he pummeled the student senseless on the floor.\n\nIt took three teachers to pull him away.\n\nBack home, on some summer nights, Green would sneak out of the house\n\nwith his .22 rifle and head for a ridge overlooking a dam on nearby\n\nLake Roosevelt. Patiently, he would wait for Sheriff Dutch Lake to\n\ndrive onto the roadway over the dam, and then Green would shoot out\n\nthe lights on the road before fleeing into the darkness. The sheriff\n\nsuspected it was Green but could never prove it. Nor could the\n\nsheriff prove that Green was the one who rolled a boulder onto the\n\ndirt runway at the tiny Lake Roosevelt airstrip, shutting down\n\nflights for hours. By the time authorities arrived to remove the\n\nlarge rock, Green and the two buddies who carried out the prank had\n\nvanished. But they left their calling card on the boulder: the words\n\n“Fuck You,” painted in black.\n\nHis father, Melvin, was a laborer for the state highway department\n\nwho also ran Carson’s Café, a diner on Lake Roosevelt. He was quick\n\nto discipline his son for misbehaving, sometimes beating him in\n\nfront of his friends, but those beatings only made Green more\n\ndefiant. Once, his father grounded him for coming home with alcohol\n\non his breath, ordering him to work extra hours at the diner with\n\nhis sister and older brother. Instead of washing dishes, Green stole\n\nhis father’s boat, later flipping the craft in a race on the other\n\nside of the lake. The beatings that followed his pranks only seemed\n\nto make him more aggressive, and by his late teens, he was getting\n\ninto fights almost weekly.\n\nYbarra was angry, but for more obvious reasons: he was painfully\n\naware of his own physical appearance and never felt accepted in the\n\nsmall mining community that looked down on Mexicans and Native\n\nAmericans. Sam was burdened with the shame and angst of being a\n\n“half-breed,” and his longing for a father who had died when Ybarra\n\nwas five was profound. (Manuel Ybarra was a truck driver for the\n\nInspiration Consolidated Copper Company when he stopped at a bar on\n\nthe way home and was stabbed to death in a brawl.)\n\nBesides getting into fights, he was arrested three times for\n\nunderage drinking and once for disorderly conduct. At sixteen, he\n\nhad dropped out of high school, guzzling beer and wine behind Mark’s\n\nor Pinky’s-the two nightspots in town that catered to Native\n\nAmericans. He was too young to go inside, so he would wait outside\n\nthe door and ask elders from the reservation to buy him a Coors or a\n\npint of Thunderbird.\n\nIn Globe, Indians and whites weren’t supposed to socialize. It had\n\nbeen that way for generations. But by the 1960s, some of those rules\n\nbegan to be challenged. Though Ybarra and others from the\n\nreservation went to “Indian schools” during their grade-school years\n\nin the 1950s, they were now attending the white public schools.\n\nWhites and Indians were at this point playing on the same football\n\nand basketball teams, and even joined in school dances. Still, the\n\nolder Indians would tell Ybarra to stay out of the white bar, The\n\nHuddle.\n\nGreen and Ybarra didn’t meet until high school, where they began\n\nhanging out in the parking lot before classes. Though they came from\n\ndifferent worlds, they found something in common: they were angry\n\nand were quick to pick fights. Ybarra was an outcast, and Green was\n\nbecoming one.\n\nTheir bond became deeper after Green began driving, and the two\n\nstarted skipping school and drinking. “No one knows the shit that\n\nSam has gone through,” Green told family members who tried to\n\ndiscourage him from associating with Ybarra. It was them against the\n\nworld, as ferocious as suns.\n\nAnd now, here they were in late May 1967, ten thousand miles from\n\nhome and oblivious to the soldiers around them in the bar. They\n\nordered Black Labels and toasted each other.\n\n“At least we’re both still alive,” said Green.\n\nThe night before they had enlisted, the two friends had sat in\n\nGreen’s car downing beers when they heard a radio broadcast about\n\nthe war. They began talking about joining the Army. Sam had\n\nchallenged his friend: “If you do it, I’ll do it.”\n\nGreen had agreed. As a boy growing up along Lake Roosevelt, he was\n\nspellbound at the sight of the paratroopers dropping from the sky\n\nduring training exercises. And when Green and Ybarra hunted deer and\n\nquail in the nature preserves near the lake, they often talked about\n\nwhat it would be like to be soldiers. Besides, there was nothing for\n\nthem in Globe, except working in the copper mines. Ybarra knew all\n\nabout that life: his relatives had toiled underground for years, and\n\nhe didn’t want any part of it.\n\nThe next day, they showed up at the local recruiting office and\n\nenlisted under the Army’s buddy system. Together they entered the\n\n101st Airborne in January 1966 and, after jump training at Fort\n\nBenning, Georgia, were sent to Vietnam, Ybarra in July and Green a\n\nmonth later.\n\nIt had been about ten months since they arrived in Vietnam, leaving\n\nbehind their lives in Arizona, and for most of that period, they\n\nwere assigned to different units. Green was in a mortar platoon but\n\nspent most of his time humping in the mountains in the heart of\n\nSouth Vietnam with heavy equipment and only sporadic contact with\n\nthe enemy. Ybarra’s experiences were different-and it showed even in\n\nhis uniform. Unlike the others in the lounge that night, he wasn’t\n\nwearing the traditional olive green. Instead, he was dressed in\n\ntiger-striped fatigues and a soft-brimmed jungle cap, and he carried\n\nhis own sidearm and hunting knife.\n\nTiger Force, the 101st Airborne’s version of Special Forces. Badass\n\nof the badass.\n\nYbarra had actually been sent to a signal corps after arriving in\n\nVietnam, but quickly grew bored and asked to be transferred to the\n\nTigers in early 1967. He didn’t regret his move. As soon as he\n\njoined the platoon of forty-five men, he felt part of a special team\n\nof soldiers who were treated differently than the grunts in the line\n\ncompanies. He remembered the first time a battalion commander\n\naddressed his platoon in Phan Rang: “You’re the Tigers, men,” he\n\nreminded them before they went on a reconnaissance mission. “The\n\nTigers always get it done, no matter how many gooks you see.” It was\n\nan exceptional group that allowed no exceptions.\n\nTiger Force was founded in November 1965 by Major David Hackworth to\n\n“outguerrilla the guerrillas,” a platoon known as a “recondo unit”\n\nbecause it was to carry out reconnaissance and commando functions.\n\nThe model for Apocalypse Now‘s Colonel Kilgore, Hackworth was a\n\nhell-for-leather soldier of savage brilliance who had revealed\n\nhimself as a daring hero during the Korean War. In Vietnam, he had\n\nrealized that conventional warfare was a dead end. Following his\n\nlead, his commanders found the best way to locate the new enemy was\n\nto blend into the jungle terrain. That meant breaking into small\n\nteams, donning camouflage, and carrying enough rations and supplies\n\nto last several weeks. They would leave themselves behind.\n\nSuch was Hackworth’s answer to an enemy that moved in intricate\n\nunderground tunnels and carried out hit-and-run tactics.\n\nBeyond surveillance, the Tigers were often ordered to perform\n\nimpossible maneuvers, such as acting as a blocking unit for\n\nretreating guerrilla forces and often relieving much larger line\n\ncompanies trapped in firefights. In February 1966 at My Canh II, an\n\narea covered by rice paddies and mountains in the Central Highlands,\n\nthe Tigers were trapped by a well-fortified enemy until the unit’s\n\nown commander, Lieutenant James Gardner, heroically charged three\n\nbunkers. Gardner was killed, but his actions allowed his platoon to\n\nescape, and he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. At Dak\n\nTo, a city just thirty-five kilometers from Laos, eleven Tigers were\n\nkilled on June 11, 1966, when they pursued a fleeing North\n\nVietnamese Army (NVA) regiment. In that case, as it would be often,\n\nthey had been the first unit sent to face the enemy. Let the other\n\nguys mop up-the Tigers wanted fresh blood, even if it meant some of\n\nit might be their own.\n\nOnly forty-five men were accepted in the Tigers, and that was only\n\nafter three months of combat experience and a screening process by\n\ncommanders that included a battery of questions, mostly centered on\n\nthe soldiers’ willingness to kill.\n\nYbarra had impressed the officers. With cold, steely eyes, he said\n\nhe could kill without hesitation-using a knife, M16, or even his own\n\nhands. It made no difference. Ever since jump school at Fort\n\nBenning, Georgia, he had been looking for a home. He hated the\n\nstructure of the line companies-the chain of command, the rules, the\n\nofficers. The Tigers were different, part Green Beret, part line\n\ncompany. They would break into small teams, two or three men at a\n\ntime, creep deep into the jungles, “and do whatever the hell you\n\nwant to do,” he was fond of saying. When the commanders told him he\n\nwas accepted into the platoon, he was “thrilled.”\n\nAfter several rounds of beer, Sam sank down into his chair. There\n\nwas so much smoke in the lounge it was almost impossible to see\n\nacross the room. Not that there was anything special worth noticing.\n\nThe room was a typical makeshift military bar, with round\n\nFormica-top tables, folding chairs, and thin wood walls built on a\n\nraised bamboo platform, and filled with the stench of cigarettes and\n\nwhiskey. There were hundreds of these cheap versions of nightspots\n\nin South Vietnam that were supposed to remind American soldiers of\n\nthe watering holes they left behind. The only prop in the lounge was\n\nthe flickering Black Label neon light dangling over the bar.\n\nYbarra guzzled the last of his beer, leaned over, and began telling\n\nGreen and the others about the Tigers’ most recent battle. On May 15\n\nYbarra and the Tigers were called to a valley west of Duc Pho in the\n\nheart of the Central Highlands-Quang Ngai province-where another\n\nArmy reconnaissance unit, the Hawks, was pinned down by enemy fire.\n\nIn the late morning, with a dozen Tiger Force soldiers at the bottom\n\nof the valley, the enemy launched a surprise attack. “They were\n\nfuckin’ all over the place,” Ybarra angrily recalled. Well-fortified\n\nenemy bunkers at the top of the valley suddenly opened up, and NVA\n\nsoldiers began shelling the helpless Tigers below.\n\nLed by the Tigers’ commander, Lieutenant Gary Forbes, the platoon\n\nmembers charged the bunkers but were forced down by a flurry of\n\nmortars and .50-caliber machine-gun fire. For hours, the platoon was\n\nat the bottom of the basin, dodging artillery, grenades, and bullet\n\nfire. Tiger Force radioed for helicopters to evacuate the wounded,\n\nbut each time a chopper tried to land, it was forced to leave\n\nbecause of enemy artillery. One helicopter was able to land in a\n\nrice paddy but was immediately hit by fire and destroyed.\n\nBy early afternoon, Tiger Force was no closer to escaping and was\n\nrunning low on ammunition. But the platoon finally caught a break\n\nwhen the soldiers found a new position and were able to call in\n\nAmerican air strikes without being hit. For two hours, U.S. jets\n\ndropped bombs on the bunkers. The combination of air strikes and the\n\narrival of some additional American troops allowed the Tigers to\n\nescape. By the end of the day, two were dead and twenty-five\n\nwounded. For some of the injured, including Lieutenant Forbes, the\n\nwar was over.\n\nBecause of the losses, Sam admitted the Tigers “were down” and\n\nunable to go back out on maneuvers until they could find\n\nreinforcements. The battalion officers were trying to bring in new\n\nvolunteers. Now Ybarra did his part. He turned to Green. “You need\n\nto come with me, Kenny. You need to be a Tiger.”\n\nGreen always knew when Ybarra was serious; his smile would disappear\n\nand his eyes would narrow. He had seen the look many times before,\n\nand he saw it now.\n\nVietnam in early 1967 was still vastly different from what it was to\n\nbecome at year’s end. There was still a sense of patriotism that had\n\nnot yet been eroded by the bitterness of the Tet Offensive and\n\ncasualties that would soon turn most Americans against the war.\n\nUntil now, most of the conflict had been marked by skirmishes and,\n\nif not wild optimism, at least a sense of inevitable triumph.\n\nThrough most of the conversation, Green’s friend Leon Fletcher was\n\nquiet. But after several minutes, he grew agitated. “You don’t want\n\nto join these guys, Kenny,” he said. “You’re going to get yourself\n\nkilled.”\n\nFletcher had looked up to Green. Ken had been the one who took the\n\ntime to show Leon the basics of survival, from throwing him to the\n\nground during sniper attacks to teaching him how to avoid booby\n\ntraps. And now Fletcher thought it was time to return the favor.\n\nGreen was quiet for a moment, and then he turned to Fletcher. “At\n\nthis point, I just want to kill a lot of them. My job is to kill.”\n\nEd Beck joined in. After several months in South Vietnam, he was\n\nlooking for real action-not just maneuvers or air strikes with no\n\nreal targets. He had come to Vietnam to escape, not just from the\n\nboring western suburbs of Chicago but from a wife who was making his\n\nlife miserable. “How do we get in?” he asked.\n\nBefore Ybarra could answer, Fletcher interrupted again. “You guys\n\nare crazy. You’re supposed to be trying to stay alive. Why do you\n\nwant to join a fucking recon unit?”\n\nYbarra quickly cut him off. “Look, man, stay out of this,” he said,\n\njabbing a finger at Fletcher. “Don’t be telling Kenny what he’s\n\ngoing to do. We go way back.” There was not a trace of friendliness\n\nin his comment.\n\nYbarra’s anger may have been what Green most admired, especially\n\nwhen his fury involved protecting Ken’s right to do whatever the\n\nhell he wanted to do. Green turned to his friend. “I’m in, man. Tell\n\nme what I need to do.”\n\n“If you’re going, I’m going,” Beck said.\n\nFor Green and Beck, it was their way of finally taking part. Like so\n\nmany others in the bar that night, they had been in high school when\n\nthe first U.S. fighting units arrived in Da Nang in March 1965, and\n\nhad watched the television reports of a war that was supposed to\n\nstop the spread of Communism.\n\n(Continues…)\n\nExcerpted from Tiger Force\n\nby Michael Sallah Mitch Weiss\n\nCopyright &copy 2006 by Michael Sallah and Mitch Weiss.\n\nExcerpted by permission.\n\nAll rights reserved.
