        "text": "NEW YORK -- The Los Angeles Times on Monday won five Pulitzer Prizes, the most for any newspaper this year, in categories ranging from breaking news to feature photography, and Washington Post foreign correspondent Anthony Shadid won a Pulitzer for international reporting for his coverage of the Iraq war.\n\nShadid was shot and seriously wounded two years ago while working as a correspondent on the West Bank. He insisted on remaining in Baghdad last year as the bombs fell, and the Pulitzer board commended his \"extraordinary ability to capture, at personal peril, the voices and emotions of Iraqis as their country was invaded, their leader toppled and their way of life upended.\"\n\nAnne Applebaum, a Washington Post editorial writer, won the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction for her book \"The Gulag: A History.\"\n\nThe Toledo Blade won the Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting for its series on atrocities committed by Tiger Force, an elite U.S. Army platoon during the Vietnam War. Michael D. Sallah, Mitch Weiss and Joe Mahr spent nine months on the story, which took them from Washington to Vietnam.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal won two awards: Kevin Helliker and Thomas M. Burton took the explanatory reporting award for an examination of aneurysms, a medical condition that kills thousands of people each year. Reporter Daniel Golden won the beat reporting award for his articles detailing the college admission preferences given to the children of alumni and wealthy donors.\n\nThe New York Times won the prestigious Public Service Award for a series examining the problem of workplace safety in many corners of the nation.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times' haul of five prizes was the second-largest in Pulitzer history -- the New York Times won seven awards in 2002. Its staff, collectively, won two awards. It took the Pulitzer in national reporting for its examination of the often hardball tactics that WalMart used in becoming the world's largest company. And it received a Pulitzer for breaking news for its coverage of the wildfires that scorched Southern California last year.\n\nLos Angeles Times writer Dan Neil won the Pulitzer for criticism for his \"one-of-a-kind reviews of automobiles, blending technical expertise with offbeat humor and astute cultural observations.\" William Stall won for editorial writing. And Carolyn Cole won for feature photography for her \"cohesive, behind-the-scenes look at the effects of civil war in Liberia.\"\n\nwith special attention to innocent citizens caught in the conflict.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles Times acquired a new leadership team in recent years whose tenure has been rich in prizes. The newspaper won three Pulitzers last year. Executive Editor John Carroll used to edit the Baltimore Sun and Managing Editor Dean Baquet came to the paper from the New York Times, where he had served as national editor.\n\n\"I'm kind of blown away by it,\" Carroll said. \"We didn't do anything terribly original as editors -- we simply tried to identify talented, motivated people and let the stories come up from the grass roots.\"\n\nThe Washington Post had five finalists this year, three in journalism and two in letters. Executive Editor Leonard Downie Jr. took to the newsroom floor at 3 p.m. and recounted how Shadid, the grandson of Lebanese immigrants, had telephoned Phil Bennett, the assistant managing editor for foreign news, and pleaded to remain in Baghdad on the eve of war, even as many other newspapers were pulling their journalists out.\n\nWith no hint of bravado in his voice, Shadid told Bennett: \"I'm basically begging you to let me stay here. I've prepared for this story my whole life. Please let me do this.\"\n\nShadid's pieces touched on geo-politics and history and culture, but what distinguished the core was a relentless focus on the human side, his editors said. As Bennett noted: \"He was embedded with the soul of the place.\" So he told tales of the burial of 14-year old Arkan Daif and of a family living beneath the bombs.\n\nShadid, 35, joined The Post a little more than a year ago as its Islamic affairs correspondent based in the Middle East. (His wife and child live in Silver Spring, Md.) He previously worked for the Boston Globe, and was shot and seriously wounded while covering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nShadid spoke to the newsroom by a crackling speaker phone from Baghdad. It was just past midnight there and he was still working on a story about the Shiite uprising. \"I've had four hours sleep and 10 cups of coffee and I was trying to figure out my lede,\" Shadid said. \"Then a bomb went off outside my window. Just another day in Baghdad.\"\n\nShadid, who will soon depart for a six-month book leave, noted that the storyline in Iraq is unpredictable, changing not so much week by week as moment by moment. \"The arc and narrative changes all the time,\" he said. \"It's a complicated place that defies cliches. The longer I'm here, the more confused I am.\"\n\nOther winners included Leonard Pitts Jr. of the Miami Herald, who won for commentary for what the board called his \"fresh, vibrant columns.\" Matt Davies of the Journal News in White Plains, N.Y., won the prize for his \"piercing\" editorial cartoons. The prize for breaking news photography went to David Leeson and Cheryl Diaz Meyer of the Dallas Morning News for their pictures from the war in Iraq.\n\nThe Pulitzer board decided not to award a Pulitzer in feature writing, the first time a prize has not been given in that category's 25-year history. None of the three finalists garnered a majority of the votes."
