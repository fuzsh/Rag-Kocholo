        "text": "Or, please God, make it end.\n\nWell, this has been quite the (action) adventure. I wasn’t sure what to expect going into this, but I know I didn’t think it would drag on for so long. However, the sad reality is that Spielberg’s films are long: most clock in over two hours, and seven of them are over two and a half hours.\n\nIn and of itself, this wouldn’t be a problem. Some of my favorite films are long, and some many people might call them boring: Les Enfants du paradis (Children of Paradise) and The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp come to mind. But I think many of Spielberg’s films are unnecessarily long. Maybe this is because he wants to make big, epic pictures like his hero David Lean, but I don’t think he has a knack for them.\n\nAnd it seems I’m not the only one who thinks so. Internationally, Spielberg’s reputation is mixed. While he claims five of the spots on the American Film Institute’s Top 100 list (the most of any director), only one of these films, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, appears in the Sight & Sound Top 250 greatest films of all time (and it’s way down the list at #183). Even more surprising, Schindler’s List, which is #8 on the AFI list, is the only film in the Top 25 to not appear anywhere on the complete Sight & Sound list, which includes 1000 films. Saving Private Ryan, which comes in at #71 on the AFI list, is also nowhere to be found in the Sight & Sound poll.\n\nAs a point of comparison, fifteen of the Top 25 AFI films appear in the Sight & Sound Top 100, and five more are in the Top 250.* [Yes, of course I made a spreadsheet, why do you ask?] Of the three directors—Hitchcock, Kubrick, and Wilder—who come closest to Spielberg in the AFI list, with four films each, only Wilder has a film that didn’t make the Top 250, and that’s Double Indemnity at #283. So, despite any issues I might have with some of Spielberg’s films, I do feel he is woefully underrepresented in the Sight & Sound poll, especially when someone like Bresson has a whopping seven films (I mean, really, shoot me now). And Spielberg’s one film is E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial? Really? But more on that later.\n\nTo the awards!\n\nBest Film: Jaws. Not only is Jaws a great story that holds up after repeated viewings, but it also produced some of the finest performances seen in a Spielberg film as well as being one of his most “cinematic” efforts.\n\nFavorite Film (Readers’ Choice): Raiders of the Lost Ark was the clear winner here. Readers chose it three to one over the next leading contenders, including E.T., Jaws, Jurassic Park, and The Last Crusade. Thanks to everyone who voted!\n\nDesert Island Film: This remains Raiders of the Lost Ark, although depending on the day I might pick The Adventures of Tintin. Good, (mostly) clean fun.\n\nMost Underrated Film: A.I. Artificial Intelligence. I’m sure this comes as no surprise after my science fiction post. This film broke me in the best way possible, all while containing a multitude of gorgeous shots and angles.\n\nMost Overrated Film: E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. That’s right, I went there. It may be a good movie, but it’s not a great film. While it might squeak into my top ten Spielbergs, it would not be nearly as high as most seem to put it. Feel free to register your displeasure in the comments.\n\nThe Spielberg Film You Probably Haven’t Seen But Should: Duel. Seriously, if you haven’t seen this, get your hands on a copy.\n\nBest Opening: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. I think this tops Raiders of the Lost Ark by just a smidge.\n\nBest Ending: Raiders of the Lost Ark. How can I not go with the film whose last line is about getting a drink and whose last shot launched not-quite-a-thousand episodes of The X-Files? I can’t. And it’s not just because Chris Carter and I share the same birthday.\n\nWorst Ending: Munich. I think the sex may have been worse the second time. And that’s just wrong on so many levels.\n\nMost Wasted Potential: 1941. This could have been so funny; instead, it was a sad mess.\n\nWorst Film: Hook. I admit that Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, War of the Worlds, and Always put in good showings, but Hook is just abysmal from beginning to end.\n\nI think most of my “technical” awards remain what they were out the outset. I’ll just say that, regardless of my issues with the length of Spielberg’s films, he does work with incredible collaborators and the production values of his films are invariably high.\n\nBest Ensemble: Saving Private Ryan. The secondary characters make this movie.\n\nBest Actor/Actress: Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln in Lincoln.\n\nBest Actor/Actress, junior division (tie): Christian Bale as Jamie Graham in Empire of the Sun and Haley Joel Osment as David in A.I. Artificial Intelligence.\n\nWorst Actor/Actress: Julia Roberts as Tinker Bell in Hook. I’m no Julia hater, but she is cringe-inducing here.\n\nBest Stunt Casting: Sean Connery as Professor Henry Jones in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Considering Spielberg originally had a James Bond type of character in mind for this series, this bit of casting is sort of brilliant.\n\nBest Stunt Casting, runner-up: Robert Stack parodying himself as Major General Joseph Stilwell in 1941.\n\nFavorite Character: Robert Shaw as Quint in Jaws. For the USS Indianapolis speech and so much more. Quint just gets under your skin.\n\nFavorite Character, runner-up: Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm in Jurassic Park. I love this character and he elevates a rather lackluster cast.\n\n—God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates man. Man destroys God. Man creates dinosaurs.\n\n—Dinosaurs eat man … woman inherits the earth.\n\n—Ian Malcolm to Ellie Sattler in Jurassic Park\n\nBest Use of Trains: Duel set the standard for the train obsession to come.\n\nBest Use of a National Park: Arches National Park in the opening of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\n\nPrettiest Sunset Shot: The shots at the end of War Horse were so glorious they seemed fake.\n\nMost Ominous Sunset Shot: The men in helmets coming up the hill to Elliott’s house in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.\n\nMost Impressive Crowd Scenes: Empire of the Sun. These scenes were apparently choreographed to the inch as no digital effects were used.\n\nBest Silent Film Imitation: The Japanese “descendents of Ninja assassins” disguised as Christmas trees in 1941.\n\nBest Inside Joke: E.T. dressed as a ghost on Halloween, looking at “Yoda” walking by.\n\nBest Callback to a Previous Spielberg Film: The falling ferris wheel in A.I. Artificial Intelligence, calling back to 1941.\n\nBiggest Musical Rip-Off: Jurassic Park. The only Spielberg score that was not composed by John Williams was The Color Purple, which was by Quincy Jones. However, I think Williams must have liked it because the main theme was disconcertingly similar to the one found years later in Jurassic Park.\n\nFavorite Musical Moment: Sallah singing Pinafore in Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nFavorite Surprise Moment: When Jamie runs over the hill to get his plane and sees the Japanese soldiers in Empire of the Sun.\n\nTenderest Moment: Lincoln picking up his sleeping son in front of the fireplace in Lincoln.\n\nEeriest Moment: Approaching the Twin Towers and a few other tall buildings sticking out of a drowned, and then frozen, Manhattan in A.I. Artificial Intelligence. The Twin Towers appear prominently in the closing shot of Munich as well.\n\nAll in all, I’m very glad that I undertook this project. It definitely helped me understand Spielberg’s work and, for better or worse, changed my existing opinion on a number of his films. Those that rose the most in my esteem were The Adventures of Tintin, A.I. Artificial Intelligence, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Lincoln, and Saving Private Ryan. Those that fell furthest were E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, neither of which I would have expected when setting out on this journey.\n\nFor posts in the Spielberg series, click below:\n\nSteven Spielberg: Introduction\n\nSpielberg I: Planes, Trains, and Automobiles\n\nSpielberg II: To Boldly Go… Captains, Creatures, and Crusaders\n\nSpielberg III: Father Figures and Freedom Fighters\n\nSpielberg IV: Science Fiction Triple Feature\n\nTo see the complete Spielberg filmography, click here.\n\n*The Top 25 AFI films that are also in the Sight & Sound Top 100 are Casablanca, Chinatown, Citizen Kane, City Lights, The General, The Godfather, Lawrence of Arabia, Psycho, Raging Bull, The Searchers, Singin’ in the Rain, Some Like It Hot, Sunset Blvd., 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Vertigo. Those in the Sight & Sound Top 250 include E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Gone with the Wind, The Grapes of Wrath, Star Wars, The Wizard of Oz.\n\nAlthough one might be tempted to include Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) or E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) in any look at Spielberg’s take on science fiction, I find those films very much grounded in their own present-day. On the other hand, A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001), Minority Report (2002), and War of the Worlds (2005) look ahead to an extremely grim future. Unfortunately, this future still seems to include The Gap, which you might think would give it more color, but alas no.\n\nA.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) is probably Spielberg’s most controversial film. People either seem to love it or hate it, especially the ending. I can understand this reaction because it is a curious amalgam of the original Kubrick project and Spielberg’s own sensibilities (except, apparently, the parts that people usually think are Spielberg’s were Kubrick’s and vice versa). I thought I would hate it, but actually I think it’s one of Spielberg’s best.\n\nLike many science fiction stories, A.I. concerns itself with larger philosophical questions about what makes us human, here, the capacity to love and be loved, and the ability to dream. Kubrick’s original concept for the film, based on a story by Brian Aldiss, was a futuristic Pinocchio, where a robot-boy longs to become “real” so that he can gain the love of his human mother. I usually love a re-contextualized fairytale and think that this one works particularly well. The fairytale theme is set up from the beginning, as Monica and Henry walk along hospital corridors lined with paintings of well-known stories. Later, Monica reads aloud from Pinocchio and David goes on a quest to find the Blue Fairy from the tale.\n\nBut this is no happily-ever-after story. It is very creepy in the beginning: the story itself is chilling, as is Haley Joel Osment’s portrayal of David, and the jarring camera angles and ominous music only emphasize this aspect. So I was already quite disturbed when the bear came on the scene.\n\nOh, yeah, there’s a freak-ass robot bear in the movie. Think Teddy Ruxpin meets Talky Tina. At this point, I considered shutting the movie off completely. Luckily, I decided to stick with it and gradually I gained an enormous amount of sympathy for David, and even became extremely fond of Teddy, rooting for them to be reunited when they are separated. I didn’t quite get the point of Jude Law’s Gigolo Joe character, although I suppose every quest needs a sidekick and he certainly is entertaining.\n\nAbout the ending: I found it exceptionally moving. And by moving, I mean I moved into a fetal position and began bawling like a baby. Both times.\n\nI presume this ending seeks to get people thinking about the price one pays when one sacrifices the humanity of others to fulfill one’s own desires, or some other similar moral dilemma, but all I was thinking was WHERE IS THIS TECHNOLOGY?!? Because, having now lived on this earth longer without my mom than with her, there’s no question what I’d do.\n\nI guess some people see this resolution as a typical Spielberg happy ending, but I didn’t view it that way at all. It was so full of melancholy. And, in the end, I think that is why it is so effective. Love it or hate it, I can’t imagine not being affected by this work. It posits complex moral questions, provides compelling drama and tense action sequences, and has more incredible frames than you can count.\n\nIf A.I.’s big question centers on love, then Minority Report (2002) looks at the question of free will. If you can see the future, and you are committing murder in that future, what do you do? Can you change your fate simply by knowing it?\n\nIn other words, this is one of those plots where the more you think about space-time logistics, the more your head feels like it’s going to explode. Or maybe that’s because I had just recently watched La Jetée. Better to just sit back and enjoy the ride.\n\nAnd it is quite a ride. I couldn’t really connect with this film and I think that had a lot to do with the digital production design and my lack of interest in the special effects. Plus, there was the whole thing with the eyeballs, which meant that it had a major squick factor for me. However, it is well-paced, with some interesting performances. There are a few killer shots, but nothing close to A.I. or some of Spielberg’s other films. However, like his more adventure-based stories, there was both a train and a sunset.\n\nTrain sighting: Tom Cruise in the metro when he first goes on the run.\n\nSunset shot: In the epilogue, with the pan out from the house.\n\nIf A.I. asks us to ponder love, and Minority Report to consider free will, War of the Worlds (2005) compels us to consider the vital question: “What would happen if aliens rode lightning down to earth and replaced Michael Bay with Steven Spielberg?”\n\nSadly, the answer to that question is nothing, you would still get the same crappy, nonsensical action movie. Probably the only redeeming thing about this movie is Tim Robbins portrayal of a crazy man. And surely one can get that elsewhere.\n\nTrain sighting: A runaway train on fire(!) in the Hudson Ferry sequence.\n\nSunset shot: The Arc de Triomphe in the “world” montage at the beginning.\n\nI suppose it is only fitting that I end my Spielberg odyssey with War of the Worlds. Much like Tom Cruise in that film, I may be bruised and battered, but I live to fight another day.\n\nFor the complete Spielberg filmography and links to other posts in this series, click here.\n\nMuch like his films, this Spielberg project just seems to go on and on, doesn’t it? This penultimate installment looks at his “prestige” endeavors.\n\nAs I wrote last time around, Spielberg takes a definitive turn toward the serious with Schindler’s List in 1993; however, his exploration of the darker side of humanity can be traced back to his first prestige projects in the mid-80s: The Color Purple and Empire of the Sun, both based on literary works. Although Spielberg had already been well rewarded by the Academy with multiple nominations for Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, these new films seem to be part of a different agenda.\n\nWhat’s Your Childhood Trauma?\n\nThe Color Purple (1985), based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Alice Walker, tells the story of Celie, an African-American girl who has been sexually abused by her father (resulting in two children taken from her after childbirth and presumed dead) and forced to marry a local widower who is interested in her younger sister, Nettie. “Mister” beats her regularly and basically treats her as a slave for him and his kids. Although Nettie runs away from home and stays with Celie for awhile, she is chased away for good by Mister’s advances. Later on, Shug Avery, jazz singer and former mistress of Mister, comes to live with them, which eventually sets Celie on the road to independence.\n\nWhen I was first reading the novel (just prior to viewing), I couldn’t imagine why or how Spielberg wanted to make this into a film, but when it got to Africa about halfway through, it started to make sense to me. Unfortunately, Spielberg doesn’t really develop the Africa section, which I thought was a real shame. However, he does use it to set up one of the great visual sequences of the film—the parallel recounting of the cutting ceremony and the shaving scene. Yet these moments of visual creativity were few and far between, at least when compared to Spielberg’s earlier films.\n\nEven more problematic is that this is an extremely sanitized version of the novel. While the film contains some good performances, especially from Whoopi Goldberg as Celie and Oprah Winfrey as Sofia, as an adaptation it fails miserably. Spielberg amplifies the character of Shug, but somehow renders her less important. I missed the book’s early set up of Celie’s obsession with Shug and the nuances of their changing relationship. There is also a shift in focus of Shug’s character arc, with an added storyline about reconciling with her father. I failed to see this supposed obsession of Spielberg’s in his earlier works, but at this point I started to understand why people say he has daddy issues.\n\nThis was a difficult story to tell and, for such a short novel, hard to condense to even standard Spielberg length (most films here are at least two and a half hours), so I give him props for trying. But it’s not surprising to me that, while the film garnered eleven Oscar nominations,* it is now mostly remembered for not having won any. And Spielberg himself was not even nominated.\n\nEmpire of the Sun (1987), the next film in Spielberg’s filmography, is also a tale that revolves around a child’s growing independence and loss of innocence. As such, it fits quite well in this transitionary period to the dark side of storytelling. The film, which recounts the experience of a young English boy under Japanese occupation in China during World War II, was nominated for six Academy Awards (Art Direction, Cinematography, Costumes, Editing, Score, Sound); however, like The Color Purple before it, took home none. And, once again, Spielberg was shut out of the directing category. [Side note: For some reason, I remember well both these shutouts and used to feel quite sorry for Spielberg until I realized how rewarded his earlier films had been.]\n\nWhile I had remembered liking this film when it came out, and did again, it is also the first evidence of what I think has become Spielberg’s biggest problem—how to end a picture. At this stage in his career, money or directorial clout was not particularly an issue, so I can only put his editorial hesitation down to respect for the fact that this was originally a David Lean project with a strong literary pedigree and so he didn’t want to tinker too much with Tom Stoppard’s script. Later on, I will not give him this benefit of the doubt.\n\nDespite a somewhat muddled script and seeming to lack any real point or message, I think this film is worth seeing for the performances alone, including that of a young Christian Bale in the lead role, and John Malkovich being very John Malkovich. I’m not a huge Bale fan, but if you ever thought kids can’t act, this movie will change your mind.\n\nIf I had remembered what a big role planes and airports played in Catch Me If You Can (2002), I would have included this work in Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, but the movie works here too since it is yet another story that Spielberg completely reworks to focus on the father-son dynamic. Despite this heavy hand with the family drama elements (for the most part invented for the film), this tale of real-life con man Frank Abagnale Jr. is more a light-hearted caper film than anything. This mood is evident from the fantastic opening credits, which hearken back to the 1960s work of Saul Bass.\n\nCatch Me If You Can is an odd film to watch post-Mad Men as I realize how much that show now colors my view of the 60s. This movie has a much brisker tone than Mad Men, which now (to me) seems at odds with a 60s style. However, the briskness was certainly a welcome relief after one too many long, slow Spielberg films. This film is fun to watch and rarely boring. Naturally, Tom Hanks drove me crazy, but Leonardo DiCaprio and Christopher Walken do great work. And one can never have too much Nathalie Baye.\n\nGratuitous train scene: Celie in The Color Purple throwing chocolate coins from the caboose to a young girl running alongside the train she is on. I’m not sure if this scene is supposed to represent her heading to Memphis or returning in style. In any case, it doesn’t make much sense and isn’t in the book.\n\nSunset moment: There are a number to choose from in Empire of the Sun. The scene above, which ends up with a reciprocal salute between Bale and three Japanese pilots, even seems to have more than one sun (Continuity error or homage to Tatooine? You be the judge.), but I think my choice would be the scene where Jim sings the Welsh lullaby from the opening of the film and the Japanese planes fly off into the setting sun.\n\nThe Dogs (and Horses) of War\n\nWar and the military come up tangentially quite a bit in Spielberg’s work, from Quint’s USS Indianapolis speech in Jaws, to the government men in Close Encounters and E.T., to the Nazis scattered throughout the Indiana Jones series. Even Frank Abagnale’s parents in Catch Me If You Can meet in France because of the war. One of Spielberg’s first films, 1941, is entirely about the aftermath of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and Empire of the Sun takes place during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai.\n\nBut, with Schindler’s List (1993), Spielberg goes straight to the heart of World War II, telling the story of Oskar Schindler, who saved much of his Jewish workforce from Nazi persecution. This is an incredible film, beautifully shot in black & white by Janusz Kaminski, with a haunting score by John Williams, featuring Itzhak Perlman on violin. It won a well-deserved seven Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director. I actually think it should have won two more, as Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes lost out on acting awards to Tom Hanks (Philadelphia) and Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive).\n\nOf course, at three hours and fifteen minutes, it is ridiculously long. For most of the film, the story is so compelling I don’t mind the length; however, I do think Spielberg completely undercuts the story’s power by having it devolve into melodramatic sentimentality at the end (brilliantly skewered by Judge Reinhold on the Seinfeld episode “The Raincoats”), not to mention the documentary bookend involving actual Schindler Jews. I understand these choices, but I don’t think they make for a better film, and this may be one reason the film enjoys a much better reputation in the US than in the global film community (something I’ll discuss in my awards post to come at the end of this series).\n\nAnother film that suffers from awkward and sentimental bookending is Spielberg’s second foray into the European theater, Saving Private Ryan (1998). I really didn’t like this film when it came out, and pretty much had a stopwatch out while viewing it this time in order to see how much I could mentally edit out of the picture. The shocking answer was: almost nothing. This film runs almost three hours, yet, aside from the horrific present-day bookends, there’s not much I would cut out. Like Schindler’s List, the earnest speech near the end somewhat ruins it for me and I think I would rate both films much higher were Spielberg to have resisted hitting the audience over the head with these sentimental hammers.\n\nOf course, what makes this film is the incredible opening depicting the storming of the Normandy beaches. It is this opening scene, portraying at once the cruelty and bravery of war, that I believe earned Spielberg his second Oscar for Directing. The film also garnered Janusz Kaminski his second Oscar for Cinematography as well as awards for Editing, Sound, and Sound Effects. It was nominated for six others, famously losing out on the big prize to Shakespeare in Love.\n\nBefore I go off and direct a movie I always look at four films. They tend to be: Seven Samurai, Lawrence of Arabia, It’s A Wonderful Life, and The Searchers.\n\n—Steven Spielberg\n\nThe other key element of this picture is the ensemble. If I had ever seen it, this is where I might say you can see the influence of Seven Samurai in Spielberg’s work. The cast of characters he brings together is amazing: from Barry Pepper as the sharpshooter to Jeremy Davies as Upham the translator, not to mention Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi, and Tom Sizemore. Heck, even Ed Burns (being very Ed Burns) works here. [Side note: I really need to rewatch Band of Brothers.]\n\nSadly, this camaraderie is mostly absent from War Horse (2011). First off, because it focuses on a horse (duh). However, that is really the least of this film’s problems, because I actually loved the relationship between Joey and Topthorn. The bigger problem is that there’s no real cohesive narrative, or even narrator. And there seemed to be a huge gap between the beginning and end of the war; it’s not clear to me how Joey even makes it through, given that he is assigned to pull artillery, where horses usually last only “two or three months.” I would love to know how this worked as a play because I can’t see it at all. That said, the sequence of Joey in No Man’s Land was masterful, and there are a number of gorgeous shots, such as the British cavalry getting on their horses in the field.\n\nGratuitous train footage: Even in a film filled with incredibly moving and dramatic sequences involving trains, Spielberg still manages to add a completely superfluous train station quay departure scene between Oskar Schindler and his wife in Schindler’s List.\n\nSunset moment: If you thought Spielberg had gotten sunsets out of his system, fear not, the final moments of War Horse are a virtual orgy of them.\n\nMorality Plays\n\nLastly, we have what I like to call Spielberg’s morality plays. These seem to be primarily discourses on good and evil, right and wrong—what freedom and justice are and should be.\n\nAmistad (1997) is of so little interest, it’s barely worth discussing. The film, about a mutiny aboard a slave ship and the resulting court case, seems awkward and forced and is easily the worst directorial effort in this bunch. Except for the obvious appeal of certain aspects of the subject matter (given Spielberg’s general interest in the plight of strangers in strange lands), this story makes even less sense to me as a Spielberg film than The Color Purple.\n\nMunich (2005), on the other hand, is an underrated film. It has a well-crafted plot with lots of tension and interesting camerawork. Watching it fairly soon after Saving Private Ryan, I realized they had more in common than I would have guessed: Both portray men on a deadly mission, here a mission of vengeance following the 1972 Munich massacre, and make excellent use of that washed-out look in their cinematography.\n\nUnfortunately, they also both have the fatal flaw of using flashback structures based on people who didn’t witness the events in question. I don’t mind Avner (Eric Bana) having nightmares, but why of the Munich events? Why not his own assassinations? That would make more sense. I think one prologue with the entirety of events at the beginning would have been sufficient set up for the film. And then maybe that whole nasty sex scene could have been avoided.\n\nThere’s no sex in Lincoln (2012), thank goodness. I am also thankful that I liked this film a bit better watching it at home than in the theater. For one thing, Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field were a lot less annoying on the small screen. Daniel Day-Lewis remained phenomenal in his role as the president, providing a human dimension for someone who it is so easy to view as caricature. The film also seemed tighter to me than I remembered, although personally I would still cut out much of the soldier prologue as well as some of the final fifteen minutes, and certainly everything after the doorway shot.\n\nWhile many point to The Color Purple or Amistad when speaking of Lincoln, collecting them together under the banner of some sort of African American trilogy, I rather think Spielberg’s interest in the dual narrative of Lincoln can be traced in part back to the 25-minute extended opening of Saving Private Ryan, which closes with General Marshall quoting Lincoln’s letter to a Mrs. Bixby:\n\nDear Madam,\n\nI have been shown in the files of the War Department a statement of the Adjutant General of Massachusetts that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle. I feel how weak and fruitless must be any word of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save. I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.\n\nYours, very sincerely and respectfully, A. Lincoln\n\nGiven that it was my negative reaction to initially seeing Lincoln in the theaters that led to this project, which has resulted in a new appreciation of Saving Private Ryan, it was interesting to see these parallels crop up. Ultimately though, I don’t think it is a film that people will be pointing to in twenty years.\n\nGratuitous train footage: Amistad may represent the most inconsequential use of a train yet: Martin Van Buren’s campaign train. I can’t believe someone paid for that. Of course, there’s a lot of that in Amistad, notably any scene with Anna Paquin as the queen of Spain. Munich also manages to sneak in a key scene at the Gare du Nord train station in Paris.\n\nSunset moment: None. All of these films have mostly night or indoor scenes and Lincoln uses a very cool blue palette. I guess when you are taking on the weightier questions of good and evil there’s no time for sunsets.\n\nFor the complete Spielberg filmography and links to other posts in this series, click here.\n\n*The Color Purple was nominated for the following Academy Awards: Actress (Whoopi Goldberg), Supporting Actresses (Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey), Art Direction, Cinematography (Allen Daviau), Costumes, Makeup, Best Picture, Score (Quincy Jones), Song, and Writing.\n\nIn a way, this post on captains, creatures, and crusaders is the sequel to Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, but with a focus on exploration and action-adventure.* While there are fewer trains, there are an awful lot of planes and ships and a continuing emphasis on travel and movement. And sunsets, of course. Lots of sunsets.\n\nCrusaders\n\nThe Indiana Jones movies seem to fit so perfectly into the Spielberg canon, it is easy to forget that the original character was very much a creation of George Lucas, who was instrumental in the production of the first film in the series, Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). Raiders proved to be such a success (even garnering five Oscars, for Art Direction, Editing, Sound, Sound Effects Editing, and Visual Effects as well as nominations for Best Picture, Cinematography, Directing, and Score) that it was soon followed by Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom in 1984 and then Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade in 1989. If only they had stopped there, but no, they just had to make Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), of which it may be best to say as little as possible.\n\nComing into this project, my love of Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) was very clear. I selected the film for Best Opening, Desert Island Film, and Best Score. I still have a great fondness for Raiders, but also a new appreciation for Temple of Doom and new insight into Last Crusade. Watching them together, there are definite patterns that emerge: For example, in each, the Paramount mountain logo fades to a mountain on the screen. In Raiders, it is a real mountain in Central America, in Temple of Doom, it is a mountain depicted on a large gong, in Last Crusade, it is a rock formation in Arches National Park, and in Crystal Skull, it is a gopher mound in the desert (tacit admission, perhaps?). I love that kind of attention to detail.\n\nAdditionally, each opening sequence is modeled after a particular film genre, the old action-adventure serials for Raiders, 1930s musicals and screwball comedies for Temple of Doom, westerns for Last Crusade, and science fiction for Crystal Skull. This is one thing I love about Spielberg, and we already saw it at work in 1941—his deep love and knowledge of cinema history and his integration of that history into his work. These openings are very reminiscent of James Bond films (although in each one Indiana Jones ultimately loses the object he is seeking to a rival) and it was not surprising to me to learn that it was this type of character and film that Spielberg had in mind when he originally discussed the project with Lucas.\n\nWhile ultimately I think that Raiders is by far the best film, there are many highlights throughout the series that merit and reward repeat viewings, except, of course, for Crystal Skull, which was even worse than I remembered. I mean, really, from the bands of Russians roaming freely through Nevada to the giant ants consuming a body in mere seconds, not to mention the magnetic-when-convenient alien and using a refrigerator to survive a nuclear bomb, honestly, I can’t even discuss that film seriously. Let’s speak of it no more.\n\nRandom things I love about the Indiana Jones movies:\n\n1) Maps. I just love the whole marking his route on maps thing. And Indy’s very first trip to Nepal starts in San Francisco as he flies over the Golden Gate Bridge!\n\n2) Marion’s introduction in Raiders. You know I’m going to love a scene where a woman drinks a man under the table. And this talent isn’t just a clever introduction, it actually comes up later as Marion tries to escape in the desert. I appreciate that the women in this series are not just window dressing, but rather individually drawn characters.\n\nCome on. I’ll buy you a drink. You know… a drink?\n\n—Marion Ravenwood has the last word in Raiders of the Lost Ark\n\n3) The basket chase in Raiders. As this website points out, this scene owes much to Hitchcock, but the music reminds me of David Lean’s Lawrence of Arabia, a favorite of Spielberg. This, and the sword/gunshot battle just before it, capture the often slapstick nature of the series.\n\n4) Sallah’s love of Gilbert and Sullivan. Why this denizen of the desert repeatedly sings tunes from H.M.S. Pinafore, I’m sure I don’t know, but I love him for it.\n\n5) Katanga, the ship’s captain in Raiders. A great example of a minor character who nevertheless is fleshed out with a distinct personality and moral code.\n\n6) Club Obi Wan. Oh, did you miss that in Temple of Doom? I’m sure I did when I first saw it (along with the fact that this film actually takes place in 1935, one year before the events of Raiders), but, yes, the brilliant opening scene takes place in Shanghai in Club Obi Wan. This scene is probably my favorite opener. I’m quite sure the first shot must be an homage to the Rank gongman, who first appeared in British productions in 1935. There is also a heavy James Bond influence here, from the costumes and set, to the Lazy Susan gag, and then especially the raft down the mountain at the very end of the sequence.\n\n7) The ice spilling out over the floor in Temple of Doom. Perhaps my favorite moment in the opener above is when Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) is frustrated in her chase after the diamond when two buckets of ice spill across the floor, effectively hiding it forever. This diamond/antidote chase sets the screwball tone that really improved the film for me this time around. When viewed through that lens, Willie and so many other elements start to make sense and seem far less annoying than I remembered. (Although I still hate the heart thing. Yuck.)\n\n8) The flying monkeys in Temple of Doom. Okay, not really, but the shot of the bats as Indy, Willie, and Short Round are approaching Pankot Palace reminded me of the flying monkeys in The Wizard of Oz. And Dan Ackroyd’s cameo at the airport had a distinctly Casablanca vibe. People talk about Tarantino’s filmic references, but there are so many in Spielberg’s work.\n\n9) Sean Connery as Henry Jones in Last Crusade. This was just brilliant casting and he and Ford make a great team. I love the scene when they are tied together and Connery starts the fire. Their reconciliation near the end of the film, when Connery calls Ford Indiana instead of Junior, is very moving. Of course, River Phoenix as the young Indiana Jones isn’t bad either.\n\n10) The train in Last Crusade. Note that while Spielberg seems to have left his train obsession behind for most of this series, this train plays an extremely important role, providing much of the origin story for Indy’s character, from his fear of snakes to the use of the whip. Also, that initial shot of the train moving across the landscape has David Lean written all over it.\n\n11) The umbrella and the birds in Last Crusade. I think that Last Crusade leans a little too heavily on campy humor (the Ark joke, the Hitler autograph) and action sequences (the boat chase, the interminable tank fight) and this scene is a reminder of how simple is sometimes best. It also highlights the gulf between the two leads.\n\n12) The three riddles in Last Crusade. My love of puzzles of all kinds makes this sequence stand out from the seemingly relentless action set pieces of the third installment. This obstacle course is a great throwback to the original Raiders opening, in fact, I had muddled them in my memory and was surprised at how short the “puzzle” part was in Raiders when I rewatched.\n\n13) Sunset shots. While the iconic shot is probably the end of Last Crusade, with Indy, Henry, Marcus, and Sallah riding off into sunset, I love the shot at the dig site in Cairo after they have pinpointed the location of the Ark. One of Spielberg’s prettiest sunsets is the one at Pankot Palace in Temple of Doom.\n\nThere is not too much to find fault with in these three movies. One consistent problem is the continuity of mechanisms—the speed of lowering doors, ceilings, etc. often does not match the time Indy has to get out. I realize this is done to ratchet up the tension, but it is so far off as to be ridiculous.\n\nA few things don’t quite fit in this world, notably the Kali Ma sequence in Temple of Doom (which seems like something from an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer does it not?), Indy’s blatant destruction of the library/church floor in Last Crusade, and the presence of the knight in the final scenes of Last Crusade, especially the waving part. But these are minor quibbles, all three installments are worth watching multiple times.\n\nCreatures\n\nWhile the Indiana Jones films have many layers and can be appreciated on multiple levels, the Jurassic Park films are more straight-up “creature features”—in fact, I had initially thought I would write up Jaws, E.T., and Jurassic Park as a separate post under this banner, but, as I watched them one after the other, they didn’t really seem to go together thematically. And, while Jurassic Park (1993) is an incredible film, it is not really on the same level of cinematic achievement as the other two, and The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) is really just a remake of King Kong, but with dinosaurs. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, I love King Kong in all its incarnations. [Confession: my shocking order of preference is 1976, 1933, 2005.]\n\nWhat have they got in there, King Kong?\n\n—An eerily prophetic Ian Malcolm upon entering Jurassic Park\n\nOf course, Jurassic Park itself is really just a slasher film in disguise, albeit one with terrific pacing, writing, and special effects. And, like the best slasher films, it has just the right mix of terror and humor. As always, Spielberg is very deliberate with his camera; for example, the kitchen sequence with Lex and her reflection is a thing of genius. But my favorite scene is probably the one with the impact tremors of the T-Rex in the glass of water in the jeep.\n\nLess character-driven than most of his other adventure films, Jurassic Park does give us Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), the only reason to even watch the sequel (apart from a few glorious shots such as the glass slowly breaking under Julianne Moore suspended in the RV over the ocean and the ship coming out of the fog and crashing into the pier in San Diego).\n\nOne reason I think Jurassic Park doesn’t quite measure up to Spielberg’s earlier adventure films is that it seems very self-aware (this is also partly why I think Last Crusade is less successful than Raiders). This awareness is quite blatant in the character of Malcolm, who deliciously comments on the mayhem, years before the arrival of self-aware slasher films like Scream and Cabin in the Woods. This self-awareness is indicative of what will prove to be a turning point in Spielberg’s career, as he leaves behind his mostly hopeful, relatively innocent films to take on much more serious, often pessimistic, subjects, starting with Schindler’s List (1993) released just six months later.\n\nCaptains\n\nHook (1991), which was released between Last Crusade and Jurassic Park, also reflects this developing pessimism, and is almost a last-ditch attempt to preserve a childlike sense of wonder, much as Peter Pan refuses to grow up in the original story. However, this attempt is an utter failure. As bad as Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was (and it was), it still wasn’t as bad as Hook. If you haven’t seen it (and please don’t), the story follows an adult Peter Pan (Robin Williams), who doesn’t remember his earlier life until he flies to London to visit Granny Wendy (Maggie Smith), and Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) kidnaps his children, forcing him to return to Neverland and rescue them. Julia Roberts is woefully miscast as Tinker Bell and pretty much brings down the whole movie single-handedly, although the Lost Boys were pretty bad too. And, if that’s not enough, for those haters out there, Gwyneth Paltrow makes a cameo appearance as the young Wendy. In the end, all gets wrapped up in a saccharine bow—fatherhood is beautiful, blah, blah, blah, life’s an adventure, blah, blah, blah—ugh.\n\nThankfully, in recent years, a new captain has come on the scene, one that perhaps indicates a return to the glorious action-adventure of yore. I said in my first Spielberg post that the film I was most looking forward to was The Adventures of Tintin (2011) and I wasn’t disappointed; I really loved it. The motion capture looks far better than I anticipated and the film exhibits a great respect for the original comic book series. In fact, if you know the books well, there are numerous Easter eggs throughout for Tintin fans, especially in the opening credit sequence, the first scene in the open-air market, and Tintin’s apartment. The animation is absolutely gorgeous, particularly the depiction of the ocean and desert landscapes, as well as the detail found in the street scenes in Europe and Morocco.\n\nIf you are not a Tintin fan, think of him as a proto-Indiana Jones, with a touch of James Bond. Spielberg’s movie weaves parts of three separate stories into one adventure tale involving intrepid reporter Tintin, his faithful dog Milou (Snowy), and soon-to-be-sidekick Captain Haddock, all chasing after the mystery of a model ship and the treasure of Haddock’s seafaring ancestor. There are numerous elements changed or rearranged from the original books, but I thought they made good choices overall. The two things that seem a bit off because of these changes are the fact that Tintin buys the ship before knowing Haddock (in the books, it’s a present for him), and the pickpocket (which is how they finally reunite the three rolls of parchment). Here, the whole pickpocket storyline seems superfluous, although it serves to keep the detectives Dupont and Dupond (Thompson and Thomson) in the story, so I guess I can live with it. Milou, as always, is awesome.\n\nOne can only hope this is a captain and crew who will go on and on to further adventures.\n\n*Note: I’m sort of assuming you know the plot of most of these films.
