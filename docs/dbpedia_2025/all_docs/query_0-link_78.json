James Mangold was recently interviewed about that ending shot on Entertainment Weekly:\n\n“”So, with Hollywood's penchant for remakes, reboots, and sequels, are we meant to read more into that final shot? According to the film's director, James Mangold, the scene is nothing more than a tip of the proverbial hat to the fact that, though we as an audience may not accompany Ford's Indy on any more adventures, the character himself is never \"giving up.\"\n\n\"I don't think he'll ever stop digging,\" Mangold explains to EW. \"And when he takes the hat off the clothesline, I think it's because, first of all, you shouldn't put hats on clotheslines. And second of all, no, I don't think he's done. I think that an ending doesn't mean that the characters never move again in their lives. It just means that you feel that you've entered a state of grace with their story.\"\n\n\"I think he'll wake up tomorrow and want to do something.

And I could see him really enjoying his life as a retired archeologist.\"\n\nThese things are easy to imagine, the helmer says, because \"Indy and Harrison are so close together, and Harrison will never retire, and I don't think Indy will [either].\"\n\nHe clarifies, \"He retires as a teacher [in Dial of Destiny], but I don't think he will retire from being an obsessive learner, thinker about the past and the future, and science and mankind. I think that the second he stops thinking about that, I think it's game over.\"”\n\nhttps://ew.com/movies/indiana-jones...ciZXs7Gm0BQ7n3swrhQLkT1G7NQYA&mibextid=Zxz2cZ\n\nLovely\n\nHopefully Marion and Indy are finally at peace.\n\nDoD kinda makes me view the ending of KOTCS in a different way now. Sadder?\n\ngod knows how many arguments the 3 of them had after KOTCS. It's clear Mutt and Indy never saw eye to eye on a lot of things. But that's expected with Indy being out of Mutt's life for so long. My biggest gripe in KOTCS was that they made Indy an absent father for so long (can't really blame Marion though)\n\nIndy has all the luck in the world.....just not with the family.\n\nHis mom dying when he was very young, poor relationship with his father growing up, walking out on a wedding, Marion not telling him he has a son for so many years.....Mutt's death.....\n\nSo I hope they can finally be happy. And hopefully Helena stays close with them.\n\nWe sort of have our answer!

His father, Marion twice, his friends, you name it. An adrenalin junkie. I also didn't read that \"reconciliation\" as two people who had a horrendous divorce. I think they needed time, and really it probably just took Indy having to take the first step, which was never going to happen LOL."
