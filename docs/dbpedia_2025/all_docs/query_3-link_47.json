        "text": "Panipak Wongpattanakit of Thailand, the returning Olympic champion from Tokyo 2020, retained her Olympic title in fine style. She cruised through the preliminary rounds and defeated Croatia's star Lena Stojkovic in the semi-finals.\n\nThe final against China's Qing Guo was intense and Panipak had to use all her skills to come out on top. Guo lost the first round but managed to win the second. However, Wongpattanakit was the better fighter in the decisive round, winning 2-1.\n\nStojkovic won the bronze medal by defeating 2023 World Champion Merve Kavurat of Turkey. The Turkish player had beaten Wongpattanakit in the final at the World Championships, but lost to Guo in the semi-finals in Paris.\n\nMobina Nematzadeh from Iran faced one of the surprises of the day, Saudi Arabia’s Dunya Abutaleb in the second bronze medal bout and defeated her in two rounds.\n\nAt Tokyo 2020, Korea failed to win a gold medal and it was a huge blow for taekwondo's home country. And now, on the first day of the taekwondo competition in Paris, Korea has won its first gold medal.\n\nTaejoon Park came up against Azerbaijan's Gashim Magomedov in the final. Magomedov was injured in the first round, and Park claimed in easy win. He won the first round 9-0 and in the second, he landed two powerful kicks to take a 13-1 lead. Magomedov couldn't continue after aggravating the injury.\n\nFrance claimed their first taekwondo medal when Cyrian Ravet's opponent, Tokyo 2020 champion Vito Dell'Aquila was withdrawn from the competition. The Italian had been one of the favourites for gold, but lost to Magomedov in the semi-finals.\n\nRavet started the day with a good win over the 2023 World runner-up, individual neutral Georgii Gurtsiyev, but was later beaten by Park.\n\nThe second bronze medal went to Tokyo 2020 runner up Mohamed Khalil Jendoubi from Tunisia, who defeated Spain’s Adrian Vicente."
