        "text": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. - The 2023 Summit League Men's Soccer Academic All-League Team was announced this morning, with a pair of Kansas City student-athletes earning the distinction. Seth Kacich was named to the Academic All-League team for the fourth time in his career, while Luke Hoelting earned the honor for the first time.\n\nKacich holds a 3.95 GPA while pursuing an Accounting BS and made starts in all 18 games this year for Kansas City. He becomes just the second men's soccer player in Summit League history to earn All-League honors in four seasons, joining Denver's Destan Norman from 2018-21. Kacich was the team's leader in minutes, playing full-time in 16-of-18 games for a total of 1,614 minutes played. He also was involved in the Roos' offense, attempting 10 shots on the year and logging one assist, coming in KC's 3-0 win over Western Illinois on Oct. 18.\n\nHoelting, a sophomore with a 3.84 GPA in Biology, appeared in seven games for the Roos this year, including seven starts. This honor makes him the fifth player in program history to earn a spot on the Academic All-League team, joining Michael Oakley (2012), Kacich (2020-23), Cooper Clark (2021, 22) and Arne Neufang (2022). Hoelting scored two goals on the season and logged one assist for a total of five points, tied for fifth-most on the team. Hoelting scored his first-career goal in a 1-1 draw with No. 18 SIUE on Sep. 8, then scored again in a draw at St. Thomas on Sep. 29. His lone assist of the year came in the Oct. 18 win over WIU.\n\nTo be eligible for the Academic All-League team, a student-athlete must have a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.30 (on a 4.0 scale), completed at least one full academic year at the current institution and participated in 50 percent of their team's competitions.\n\nNominations are brought forth by sports information directors from the league's six institutions that carry men's soccer. The Academic All-League Team is made up of the 11 student-athletes receiving the most votes with all ties standing.\n\n2023 Men's Soccer Academic All-League Team\n\n*Career Academic All-League honors"
