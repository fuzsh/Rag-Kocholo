He follows behind him through the temple's traps on the way in. When Indy and Satipo reach a pit on the way out, Satipo makes it over with Indy's whip and Indy is stuck on the other side. Indy throws over the fertility idol to Satipo, who offered to throw him his whip for it; but he betrays Indy, dropping the whip and fleeing. In his haste, he forgot to mind the wall trap he had witnessed Indy test and is killed; Indiana makes it out.\n\nIn an early script of the film, written by Lawrence Kasdan, Satipo flees the boulder with Indy, only to be met with Barranca's ultimate fate in the finished film and killed by the Hovito tribe, but the script was scrapped.\n\nHe appears in the video game Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine (1999) in the secret level \"Return to Peru\", where Indiana returns to the same temple and finds the second idol.\n\nHis name is based on that of a Peruvian town, Satipo in Satipo Province in Junín Region.\n\nJock Lindsey\n\n[edit]\n\nJock Lindsey (Fred Sorenson) is an American freelance pilot. Jock cut his teeth as a stunt pilot performing in Midwest airshows and relocated to Venezuela after a rumored flight-related tragedy. He frequently was hired by Jones to fly the archaeologist to remote parts of the world. Easygoing and affable, Jock butted heads with Indiana on only one subject: his pet snake Reggie. According to the novelization of Raiders of the Lost Ark written by Campbell Black aka Campbell Armstrong (1981), Jock is Scottish. The \"Jock Lindsey's Hangar Bar\" cocktail lounge at Disney Springs says he settled down in central Florida in 1938.\n\nBarranca\n\n[edit]\n\nBarranca (Vic Tablian) is the other Peruvian guide who turns against Indiana.[12] When Barranca draws a revolver, Indy uses his famous bullwhip and wraps the whip around the gun. The gun is yanked from Barranca's hand and lands in a stream. Barranca then runs away but is later killed with poisonous darts by the Hovitos tribe.\n\nIn the early script of the film, written by Lawrence Kasdan, when Barranca pulls his gun out on Jones, the archaeologist uses his whip to make Barranca shoot himself, but the script was scrapped.\n\nLike Satipo, his name is based on a Peruvian town and county, Barranca, Barranca Ward, Barranca County, Lima state.\n\nRené Belloq\n\n[edit]\n\nRené Emile Belloq (Paul Freeman) is a French archaeologist and the main antagonist in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Belloq is the arch-nemesis of Jones, and the two know each other very well, including each other's strengths and weaknesses, as shown by their very first exchange in the film, where Jones says \"Too bad the Hovitos don't know you the way I do, Belloq.\"; to which Belloq replies: \"Yes, too bad. You could warn them, if only you spoke Hovitos\". He is highly intelligent, as evinced by Sallah's \"They have not one brain among them... except one... he is very clever - a French archaeologist...\".\n\nIn the film's opening, Belloq and Hovitos tribesmen force Indiana to hand over a fertility idol he has braved numerous booby traps to obtain. Belloq aids the Nazis in finding the Ark of the Covenant, as he wants to use the relic to speak with God. When the Ark is opened, its contained spirits engulf Belloq in flames and cause his head to explode; Indiana and Marion are spared and turn the Ark over to the US government. At one point in the film, Belloq says to Indy that they are very much alike and that he is Indy's \"shadowy reflection\".\n\nThe novelization of the movie reveals Belloq became Indiana's foe at graduate school, when he plagiarized his essay on stratigraphy, thus winning an award that rightfully belonged to Indiana. Another encounter in 1934 is detailed, when Indiana spends months preparing a dig in Rub' al Khali, only to arrive and discover Belloq has excavated the region.[13] Indiana also encounters Belloq in two novels by Max McCoy, set before the films, in which Jones and Belloq meet for the first time (contradicting the novelization of Raiders of the Lost Ark) and Belloq gives Indiana information for locating a crystal skull.[14][15]\n\nBelloq's first name was Emile in an August 1979 draft of the script,[16] and Marion was originally more infatuated with him.[17] Spielberg considered Jacques Dutronc and Giancarlo Giannini for the part before casting Freeman. While watching Death of a Princess he noticed that Freeman had very piercing eyes.[18]\n\nBelloq was intended to appear in the prequel Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, but the character was written out for unknown reasons.[19] He was set to appear in The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, but the show was canceled before its third season. He and the 21-year-old Indiana would have become friends in Honduras in 1920, although his ruthless traits would be exhibited by stealing and selling a crystal skull to F. A. Mitchell-Hedges. He would have aided Indiana and Percy Fawcett in Brazil in an episode set in 1921.[20] He was also intended to appear in the canceled Dark Horse Comics limited series Indiana Jones and the Lost Horizon, in which he appears in the prologue discovering a fake Turin Shroud in New York City in 1926.[21]\n\nIn an early script of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull called Indiana Jones and the City of the Gods and written by Frank Darabont, the Nazis were set to appear, seeking revenge for Belloq's and Toht's deaths, but the script was rejected.\n\nKenner released a 3.75 in (95 mm) action figure (dressed in Jewish robes) in late 1982, which was available by mail order until 1983.[22] A Belloq figure in normal clothes was also released in 1983.[23] He was included in a TSR, Inc. collection of metal miniatures the following year.[24] Hasbro released a 3.75 in (95 mm) Belloq in Jewish robes in 2008 (which comes with the fertility idol).[25][26] An Adventure Heroes figurine, which comes with the Ark and a murderous spirit, will also be released.[27] Lego made a Belloq figure for a playset based on the Raiders opening sequence.[28]\n\nMarcus Brody\n\n[edit]\n\nMarcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) is an academic and curator who has known Indy since he was a child. Brody was friends with Indy's father, Henry Sr., and served as something of a surrogate father figure, as Indy did not get along well with his own father. In the film, Brody makes a deal with government agents that Indy will recover the Ark of the Covenant and put it in a museum, but the agents put it away in a top secret hiding place, much to his disappointment. He reappeared in The Last Crusade (1989), aiding Indiana on the search for his father and getting captured by the Nazis. In 1940, Marcus Brody retired as curator of the National Museum and accepted a position as dean of students at Marshall College. After Brody died in 1952, Indy lobbied hard for the bronze statue of Brody featured in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull on the Marshall College grounds. The statue of Brody lists his years of service as dean of students from 1939 to 1944.[29] Denholm Elliott's death in 1992 was written into Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull with the death of his character.\n\nSpielberg cast Elliott in the role because he was a fan of the actor. His return in Crusade was motivated by the director's desire to have the film hew closer to Raiders. He was initially portrayed in the first film as a knowledgeable, accomplished archaeologist in his own right, with much apparent field work under his belt, and tells Indy that he would accompany him on his quest but for other responsibilities. By the third film in the series, though still portrayed as intelligent, his character had changed to a somewhat bumbling figure who Indy mentions had gotten lost in his own museum and provided much of the film's comic relief.[30] Brody has also appeared in Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, the Marvel Comics Indiana Jones series, a Young Indiana Jones book[31] and the Bantam novels series.\n\nMarion Ravenwood\n\n[edit]\n\nMarion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) had a crush on Jones in 1926, leading him to pursue a relationship with her, despite the fact that she was a minor. This ended abruptly when her father Abner Ravenwood (Jones' mentor) discovered their romance. Ten years later, a resentful Marion is forced to aid Indiana in retrieving the Ark of the Covenant after her bar in Nepal is burned down by Arnold Ernst Toht and his thugs. Marion was a regular supporting character in the Marvel Comics series set after the film.\n\nIn the early script of the film, written by Lawrence Kasdan, Marion was set to be a prostitute after Abner's death, but George Lucas rejected the script.\n\nAccording to Steven Spielberg, Marion was set to appear in the prequel Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, alongside her father Abner, but George Lucas scrapped the idea. During the development of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, an early draft, called Indiana Jones and the Saucermen from Mars, written by Jeb Stuart, Marion was set to appear in the wedding of Indy and Dr. Elaine McGregor, alongside Sallah, Short Round, and Willie Scott, but the draft was rejected. In another early script, Indiana Jones and the City of the Gods, written by Frank Darabont, Marion was set to appear again as Indy's partner, but this draft was also scrapped.\n\nAllen reprised the role for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in 2008. It is revealed over the course of the film that Indy and Marion were engaged to be married, but Indiana left her a week before the wedding as he was concerned that it wasn't going to work out. Indiana was thus unaware that Marion married his old friend Colin Williams, or that Marion gave birth to his son, Henry Jones III (who adopted the nickname \"Mutt\" as a teenager). After the two are reunited when a Soviet plot attempts to find a secret discovered by an old colleague of Abner and Indiana, Marion reveals the truth about Mutt's parentage, and Indiana admits that none of the women he was with after Marion left compared to her. Once they return to America, the two marry in a ceremony at the college.\n\nAllen reprised the role for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny in 2023 in a cameo appearance. It is revealed over the course of the film that Indy and Marion are in the process of a divorce after Mutt was killed in the Vietnam War. After Indy is brought back from travelling back in time to Ancient Greece by his goddaughter Helena, he reconciles with Marion, and the mourning couple embrace.[32]\n\nArnold Toht\n\n[edit]\n\nSS-Sturmbannführer Arnold Ernst Toht (Ronald Lacey) is the secondary antagonist of Raiders of the Lost Ark. He is the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) agent who attempts to steal the medallion from Marion, but his hand is badly burned by it, as it had been engulfed in flames prior to his grabbing it. The scarred inscription on his hand is used by the Nazis to pinpoint the Ark's location, but as his hand lacks the code on the medallion's other side, they dig in the wrong area (the inscription on his half tells them how tall to make a staff to help find the right area, but the other half reveals that the staff should be subsequently shortened by a head in homage to God). Toht dies at the end of the film when his face melts after he is exposed to the supernatural powers of the Ark. (In the novelization and the original script, Toht dies earlier in the story when Gobler's car flies off a cliff during the chase sequence with Indiana Jones riding on horseback to intercept the truck carrying the Ark.) In a sequel comic book, Indy is confronted by his vengeful sister Ilsa.[33]\n\nToht was called Belzig in the August 1979 draft of the script.[16] Spielberg wanted him to be a cyborg, with a metal arm that could convert to a flamethrower or machine gun.[17] The 1979 script gave him a light in place of a right eye.[16] Lucas rejected these as too far-fetched.[17] Lacey was cast as Toht, as he reminded Spielberg of Peter Lorre.[30] Klaus Kinski turned down the role, as he hated the script.[34] Lacey later made a cameo appearance in The Last Crusade as Reichsfuhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, opposite Michael Sheard (who himself auditioned for Toht) as Adolf Hitler.[35]\n\nIn Indiana Jones and the City of the Gods, an early script (written by Frank Darabont) of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the Nazis were set to appear seeking revenge for Toht and Belloq's death, but the script was rejected.\n\nA 3.75 in (95 mm) figure was released in late 1982,[22] and he was part of a metal miniature collection in 1984.[24]\n\nHermann Dietrich\n\n[edit]\n\nOberst Hermann Dietrich (Wolf Kahler) is an arrogant German Army officer who serves as the head of the Tanis excavation project. He was chosen by Hitler due to his ruthless efficiency. Dietrich expresses doubt over Belloq's desire to perform a \"Jewish ritual\" with the Ark and also refers to Captain Katanga as a \"savage\", due to the captain hinting at selling Marion Ravenwood into slavery. He is killed when the Ark is opened causing his head to implode.\n\nIn the early script of the film, written by Lawrence Kasdan, Dietrich's surname was Schliemann, and he was set to survive the Ark of the Covenant's opening; after this, he and other surviving Nazis were set to pursue Marion and Indy in a minecar chase. However, the script was scrapped, and the minecar chase was recycled for Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. The only piece of Dietrich merchandise has been a 1984 metal miniature.[24] The DK Indiana Jones guide established his first name in the index.[36]\n\nSallah\n\n[edit]\n\nSallah Mohammed Faisel el-Kahir[31] (John Rhys-Davies) is an Egyptian excavator and a friend of Indiana. He reappeared in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. He also appeared in a Marvel comic,[33] a Young Indiana Jones book (which detailed his first meeting with Indiana in 1913), and two Bantam novels.[37][38][39]\n\nIn Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Sallah does not appear physically, but appears in a photo in Indy's office. In an interview of TheForce.net, Davies told that Steven Spielberg offered him to return as Sallah in a cameo, but he declined. During the development of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, an early draft titled Indiana Jones and the Saucermen from Mars, written by Jeb Stuart, Sallah was set to appear in the wedding of Indy and Dr. Elaine McGregor, along with Marion Ravenwood, Short Round, and Willie Scott, but the draft was scrapped. On February 20, 2016, Davies expressed interest in reprising his role of Sallah in the upcoming fifth movie.\n\nIn Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Sallah now works in New York City as a cab driver, after Indy helped his family emigrate to America following the Second World War, helping out Indy in 1969 when he is framed for murder by the CIA.\n\nDanny DeVito was the original choice to portray Sallah, but he declined. Also, Kevork Malikyan auditioned to portray Sallah, but was not chosen (he later portrayed Kazim in Last Crusade).\n\nCairo Swordsman\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Cairo Swordsman (Terry Richards) appears when Marion is being kidnapped by Nazi forces. The entire crowd moves aside when the swordsman appears, swinging his scimitar and coercing Indiana into a battle. Jones simply pulls out his revolver and shoots him, causing the crowd to burst into cheers. The gag came about because Harrison Ford was suffering from dysentery and did not want to spend three days filming a \"conventional\" fight. On the first take, Richards \"took a minute-and-a-half to die\", so on the next take, Ford shot him so quickly that Richards fell over in surprise. Ford would later say he felt sorry for Richards because \"he worked so hard on that swordplay\".[40]\n\nRichards felt \"it turned out to be the funniest thing in the film\", and was surprised he was not cut out of the picture.[41] Many, including Lucas, disliked the brutality of the gag,[42] and Richards concurred the joke was very morbid.[41] Nevertheless, it was placed 38th on Empire's Top 50 film gags list,[42] and it is one of Spielberg's favorite scenes in the series.[40] Kenner released a 3.75 in (95 mm) figure of the swordsman in 1982.[22] Walt Disney Parks & Resorts released a figurine of the swordsman in a box set in January 2001 (to scale with the Micro Machines vehicles models),[43] and a 4.5 in (110 mm) figure in August 2003.[44] In 2008, Hasbro released a 3.75 in (95 mm) action figure,[25] an Adventure Heroes figure,[28] and a 12 in (300 mm) figure.[45]\n\nGobler\n\n[edit]\n\nMajor Gobler (Anthony Higgins) is a German major of the military contingent attached to the Tanis project. He is personally chosen by Hitler due to his ruthlessness and efficiency. Gobler is strict whereas Dietrich is practical. He dies when the truck driven by Jones rams his car, sending it flying off a cliff.\n\nSimon Katanga\n\n[edit]\n\nSimon[36] Katanga (George Harris), is a friend of Sallah and the captain of the Bantu Wind, a tramp steamer Indiana and Marion use to transport the Ark. When his ship is boarded by the Nazis, he conceals the pair, claiming to the Nazis that he killed Indiana and intends to sell Marion to slavery. Colonel Dietrich believes him and calls him a savage.\n\nKatanga appears in a Marvel Comics sequel, in which Indiana bails him from a Panama City jail after being charged with rum-running. Katanga and his crew take Indiana to the Aleutian Islands, where they are attacked by pirates, who commandeer the Bantu Wind. Following a battle, Katanga regains his ship.[46]\n\nLuftwaffe Mechanic\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Luftwaffe Mechanic (Pat Roach) challenges Indiana to a one-on-one fight as Indy is attempting to reach the pilot of a flying wing. The muscular mechanic gets the better of Indy for most of the fight, which takes place on the airstrip, but he fails to move away from the propeller of the flying wing in time and is cut to pieces.\n\nAbner Ravenwood\n\n[edit]\n\nAbner Ravenwood is Marion's father and an unseen character. He was Indiana's mentor at the University of Chicago, but the two split in 1926 when Indiana had an affair with the teenage Marion. The Ark of the Covenant was his lifelong obsession, and he owned the headpiece to the Staff of Ra, which could pinpoint its location. He is said to be dead when Indiana and the Nazis come to Nepal (where the Ravenwoods live) in 1936, to use it to find the Ark at Tanis. The novelization details he died in an avalanche in 1936.[13]\n\nIn Marvel Comics' The Further Adventures of Indiana Jones, it is hinted that Abner is alive when Indiana and Marion travel to the fictitious city Ra-Lundi to free its people from the power of a meteorite: Indiana is briefly aided by a masked man.[47] Abner is in the back-story to a gamebook, where he lost an ebony dove from Malakula after being chased off by the island's inhabitants in 1927; five years later Indiana and his cousin must retrieve it.[48] A supplement to a role-playing game said that Abner studied under Franz Boas, and disliked the British for their \"armchair anthropology\", in which they made assumptions about other cultures based on reports instead of exploring themselves.[49]\n\nAbner was set to appear along his daughter Marion in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, but George Lucas scrapped the idea. In the early scripts of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Fedora was intended to be Abner, but the idea was rejected. Abner was intended to appear in the canceled third season of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, when a ten-year-old Indiana meets him searching for the Ark on the Temple Mount.[20] The canceled Dark Horse Comics limited series Indiana Jones and the Lost Horizon was going to depict him and Indiana recovering the headpiece to the Staff of Ra in Tibet in 1926. Artist Hugh Fleming modeled Abner's appearance on actor Wilford Brimley, and the series would explain that Abner taught Indiana to behave cynically with others, so that they would not think he was crazy if he mentioned his encounters with the supernatural.[21] The character was also intended to appear in the 2003 video game Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb (set in 1935, before Temple of Doom) but the developers of the game deemed his role as Indy's partner \"too unwieldy\".[50]\n\nIntroduced in Temple of Doom\n\n[edit]\n\nWillie Scott\n\n[edit]\n\nWilhelmina \"Willie\" Scott (Kate Capshaw) is an American singer working at Club Obi Wan (a reference to Star Wars character Obi-Wan Kenobi) in 1935 Shanghai who is caught up in Indiana's adventures and becomes his love interest. Unlike Marion, she is more of a damsel in distress. According to the novelization, Willie was born in Missouri to a wealthy family. However, in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, she tells Indiana that her father had been a magician who had \"made a lot of children very happy and died a very poor man\". She moved to Shanghai when she was unable to break into Hollywood during the Great Depression. She also claims to know Al Capone (whom Indy met in 1920) and Frank Nitti. She returns to the United States following her adventure.[51] Spielberg liked the character of Willie, describing her:\n\nWillie has led this pampered life and feels that's what's due her — to be cared for and looked after. She meets Indiana Jones, a person unlike anyone she has ever been involved with, and ends up going off with him. In the course of all their adventures, all of her earlier life is stripped away from her, and Willie must fall back on her own resources. She discovers that she is a very strong woman, a gutsy lady. Willie is a much different character than the woman Karen Allen played in Raiders.[52]\n\nIn Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, she does not appear physically, but appears in a photo in Indy's office. In an early script of the film called Indiana Jones and the Saucermen of Mars, written by Jeb Stuart, Willie was set to appear in Indy and Dr. Elaine McGregor's wedding, along with Sallah, Short Round, and Marion Ravenwood, but the script was rejected. In another early script, Indiana Jones and the City of the Gods, written by Frank Darabont, Scott was set to be mentioned by Indy, but this script was also rejected.\n\nWillie was named after Spielberg's dog.[53] Spielberg wanted Willie to be a complete contrast to Marion, so Capshaw dyed her brown hair blonde for the part.[18] Spielberg later married Capshaw in 1991.[30] A Willie figure was made by LJN in 1984, but it was never released,[54] although an unpainted metal miniature of her was made for a TSR, Inc. collection that year. She has appeared in two Lego sets: Shanghai Chase, and The Temple of Doom.\n\nSharon Stone and 120 other actresses were considered for the role of Scott.[citation needed]\n\nLao Che\n\n[edit]\n\nLao Che (Roy Chiao) is a Chinese gangster, the owner of Club Obi Wan, and Willie Scott's employer; his two sons, Chen and Kao Chan, are also prominent members of their father's gang. Che hires Indy to find the ashes of Nurhaci and promises him a valuable diamond in return. Indy recovers the ashes and Che sends Kao Chan to steal the urn while Indy is sleeping to get out of paying him, but Indy retains the urn and severs Kao's left forefinger, letting him live. Indy shows up to Club Obi Wan to make the exchange; Che threatens Indy for the urn, but Indy takes Willie hostage to complete the exchange. Che gives Indy the diamond and an unknowingly poisoned drink; Indy gives Che the urn and drinks the poison, and Che offers the poison's antidote in exchange for returning the diamond. Indy gives him the diamond, but Che refuses to give the antidote, even when Indy takes Willie hostage again. Indy's friend, Wu, holds the gangster at gunpoint, but Chen shoots and kills him amidst a bunch of champagne bottles popping to mask the gunshot. Indy impales Chen with a skewer of pigeon flambé in retaliation and a gunfight ensues. Indy, Short Round, and Willie escape with the antidote and leave Shanghai, unknowingly on a plane owned by Lao Che. Che orders the pilots to parachute out of the plane in hopes of killing Indy when the plane crashes, but Indy deploys a raft and lands safely on the ground.\n\nIn the Bantam novel Indiana Jones and the Dinosaur Eggs,[14] Indiana meets Lao Che for the first time in 1933 at a nightclub he owns in Shanghai.\n\nBefore the death of Roy Chiao, Steven Spielberg was planning to return Che in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but he declined the idea after Chiao's death in 1999. Ric Young, the actor that portrayed Kao Kan, expressed interest in reprise his role of Kan in the movie, but he declined after Roy's death. [citation needed]\n\nWu Han\n\n[edit]\n\nWu Han (David Yip) is an old friend of Indiana Jones who holds Lao Che and his sons at gunpoint during the meeting at Club Obi Wan. He is shot and killed by Lao's son Chen. Max McCoy's prequel novel Indiana Jones and the Dinosaur Eggs detailed how Wu first met Indiana in 1914, during his trip to China with his father. Years later, he is studying political science when his parents and sister die in an influenza outbreak. Their ashes wind up in the possession of Lao, who uses the promise of a proper burial to force Wu into servitude. In 1933, Indiana meets Wu in Shanghai on his way to Mongolia, and steals his family's ashes from Lao, securing his old friend's freedom. Indiana inspires him to study archaeology upon his return to school.[14] Wu also aids Indiana in the 2003 video game Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, set just before Temple of Doom. He regularly arranges Jones's transportation.[55]\n\nShort Round\n\n[edit]\n\nShort Round (Ke Huy Quan) is a 12-year-old taxicab driver in Shanghai, Short Round was orphaned when the Japanese bombed Shanghai in 1932; he helps Indiana escape from Lao Che.\n\nHe is essential in freeing Indiana and the Maharajah of Pankot from Mola Ram's psychic control. The novelization explains that Short Round was born Wan Li (Chinese: 萬麗) in 1924. Despite attending a Christian school, he respects Chinese mythology, and believes that the baby elephant that transports him in India is a reincarnation of his brother Chu. He immigrates to the United States with Jones following his adventure.[51] In the film, Short Round is frequently heard speaking the Cantonese dialect of Chinese (despite being born in Wu dialect-speaking Shanghai), as well as English.\n\nIn an early script of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, called Indiana Jones and the Saucermen from Mars, written by Jeb Stuart, Short Round (now an adult) was set to appear in the wedding of Indy and Dr. Elaine McGregor, alongside Sallah, Marion Ravenwood, and Willie Scott, but the script was scrapped by George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.\n\nShort Round was named after Temple of Doom screenwriters Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz's dog.[30] Lucas's initial idea for Indiana's sidekick was a virginal young princess, but Huyck, Katz, and Spielberg disliked the idea.[56] Around 6,000 actors auditioned worldwide for the part; Quan was cast after his brother auditioned for the role. Spielberg liked his personality, so he and Ford improvised the scene where Short Round accuses Indiana of cheating during a card game.[18] Quan had a martial arts instructor to help him on set.[30]\n\nThe character cameoed in an issue of Marvel Comics' The Further Adventures of Indiana Jones, rescuing Indiana from a pirate attack in the Caribbean, before he returns to boarding school.[57] The Lost Journal of Indiana Jones, published in 2008, detailed Short Round becoming an archaeologist and tracking down the Peacock's Eye (the diamond seen in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom 's opening sequence) to Niihau.[58]\n\nHe also appeared in the non-canonical crossover story in Star Wars Tales, where he and Indiana discover the remains of Han Solo in the crashed Millennium Falcon in the Pacific Northwest.[59] A Short Round action figure was planned by LJN in 1984, but was never released.[54] However, an unpainted metal miniature of him was released by TSR that year.[24] He appears in the 2009 Lego sets Shanghai Chase and The Temple of Doom.\n\nEmpire named Short Round as their sixteenth favorite element of the films, explaining \"you could argue that Shortie is the real hero of Temple of Doom – while the titular relic hunter is off searching for fortune and glory, it's Short Round's moral compass that keeps the adventure on the right track\".[60] In 2008, a poll conducted by movietickets.com to coincide with the release of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull named Short Round \"favorite Indy sidekick\".[61]\n\nChattar Lal\n\n[edit]\n\nChattar Lal (Roshan Seth) is the Prime Minister of Pankot and personal representative and chief advisor of Maharaja Zalim Singh. He graduated from Oxford and speaks English with a pronounced accent as a result, and also knows well Indiana's reputation. Like Indiana he was apparently forced to drink the Blood of Kali by Mola Ram, controlling him, and the young Maharaja. During the attempted sacrifice of Willie Scott, Lal is injured by Indiana when he gets caught in the wheel used to lower victims into the lava pit. He is last seen crawling away and collapsing but disappears after this. It is unknown if he escaped.\n\nIn an early script of the film, Lal was set to have a more important role, but the script was rejected. In another early script, Lal was intended to be killed by Indy throwing him into the lava pit, but the script was scrapped.\n\nIn the novelization, Chattar Lal is thrown into the lava pit while in the film he is injured but he does not die, whereas in Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures, he is blown apart by a blast of heat caused by Indy and Short Round.\n\nZalim Singh\n\n[edit]\n\nMaharajah Zalim Singh[29] (Raj Singh) is the ruler of Pankot State. He is a young boy, probably a year or two older than Short Round. Despite considering the Thuggee an evil cult and vowing that they would never return, it is revealed that Singh is an unwilling member, having been forced to drink the Blood of Kali. During Indiana's fight against the chief Thuggee guard, Singh hinders Indiana by using a voodoo doll. He is stopped by Short Round, who burns him with a torch, releasing him from the Black Sleep of Kali. He atones for his crimes by telling Short Round how he, Indiana, and Willie can escape from the mines. He also apparently alerts British troops about the recent events, as he is seen among them when they arrive to battle the Thuggee after Mola Ram's death.\n\nIn an early script of the film, Singh was set to have a more important role, but the script was scrapped.[citation needed]\n\nMola Ram\n\n[edit]\n\nMola Ram (Amrish Puri) is the Thuggee high priest and main antagonist of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. He has made Pankot Palace his lair and wants to use the five Sankara Stones to set up the reign of Kali. To that end, Mola Ram enslaves the children of a village that had one of the Stones (the taking of it bringing his total to three). They mine for the other two and for gems to fund his cause in catacombs underneath the palace. He also brainwashes people, including local politicians and royalty, with the \"blood of Kālī Ma\"—a magic potion—to make them devout followers (unless they are exposed to extreme pain, such as a burn). He forces Indy to drink the Blood of Kali, thinking that he could use Indy's archaeological skills to find other power artifacts in the world to bolster the Thuggee cult's power. He tries to get Indy to sacrifice Willy Scott as an act of supreme cruelty, but Short Round frees Indy of Kali's curse, Willy is rescued, and Mola Ram escapes through a hidden trap door under the Kali altar. Indiana eventually confronts Mola Ram over a nearby gorge, calling on the power of Shiva to use the Stones against the evil cleric, who is burned by them and falls into the river, where he is devoured by crocodiles. In the novelization, Ram's death is the same, but he returns to normal when he burns his hand on the stone; Indy tries to pull him to safety, but Ram falls to his death.\n\nMola Ram is named after an 18th-century Indian painter.[citation needed] Lucas wanted Mola Ram to be terrifying, so Huyck and Katz added elements of Aztec and Hawaiian human sacrificers, and European devil worship, to the character.[56] To create his headdress, make-up artist Tom Smith based the skull on a cow (as this would be sacrilegious to Hinduism) with a latex shrunken head. Puri was chosen as Spielberg and Lucas did not want to cast a European actor and apply dark make-up.[52] In the role, Puri resembles Eduardo Ciannelli, who played Thuggee cult leader in Gunga Din, the main inspiration for the film.[62]\n\nIn an early script of the movie, the burning Sankara Stones actually release Mola Ram from the same \"Black Sleep of the Kali Ma\" he inflicts on Jones before falling to his death, hinting that he may not have been in control of his actions. It was also intended that Mola Ram, after falling from the bridge, be killed by landing on the embankment below, followed by the crocodiles tearing apart his corpse. However, this script was scrapped and rejected.\n\nA 6-inch (15 cm) action figure and an unpainted metal miniature of Mola Ram was released in 1984.[24][54] In 2008, Hasbro released several Mola Ram items as part of their Indiana Jones toy line, including a 3.75-inch (9.5 cm) action figure, an Adventure Heroes figure, and a Mighty Muggs figure.[63] A \"One Coin\" (caricature) figure of Mola, standing 1.97-inch (5.0 cm) was released in Japan in 2008.[64]\n\nChief Guard\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Chief Guard (Pat Roach) is the ruthless, coldhearted commander of Mola Ram's Thuggee guards and also helped oversee the enslaved children in the mines that were under Pankot Palace in 1935. After releasing the children from the mines, Indy fought the chief on a conveyor belt leading to a rock crusher. Indy escaped, but the guard's sash became caught in the crusher's gears and he was dragged in and crushed to death.\n\nCaptain Phillip Blumburtt\n\n[edit]\n\nCaptain Phillip Blumburtt (Philip Stone) is a British Indian Army officer who commands troops of the 11th Poona Rifles. He is frequently sent to inspect Pankot Palace on behalf of the British government. He is alerted to the evil of Pankot Palace apparently by the young Maharajah to deal with the remaining Thuggees, whom Blumburtt's men kill so Indy and Willie can escape.\n\nIn an early draft of the film, Blumburtt was set to have a more important role, but the draft was rejected.\n\nDavid Niven was considered to play the role of Blumburtt, but died before production, so Philip Stone from The Shining, then Delbert Grady, was cast instead.\n\nIntroduced in The Last Crusade\n\n[edit]\n\nHerman Mueller\n\n[edit]\n\nHerman Mueller (J. J. Hardy) is Indiana's fellow Boy Scout in the 1912 prologue, who brings Indiana to the Sheriff's attention after his battle with outlaws for the Cross of Coronado. He reappears as Indiana's sidekick in the English and French Young Indiana Jones novels, which introduces his archaeologist father Herman Senior.[65][66][67][68]\n\nGarth\n\n[edit]\n\nGarth, also known as Fedora (Richard Young), is a treasure hunter and archeologist, who appears in the 1912 prologue. Garth is the leader of a treasure hunter gang who find the Cross of Coronado in a cave deep in present day Arches National Park. The Cross is stolen by a teenage Jones who uses his Boy Scout horse to get away. Garth and his men pursue Jones by car and follow him on a train. Garth, showing a good side for a brief period of time, saves Jones' life when Jones falls into a car carrying a lion, but then tries to reclaim the cross. Jones escapes with the cross with help from a magician's caboose, and runs home, with Garth smiling in admiration for Jones' courage and knowledge. However, Garth and the gang get the Moab sheriff on their side and Jones is told to give the cross back. Garth, however, consoles Jones, admiring the young man's attempts to claim it. He then gives Jones his fedora before walking out.\n\nIn an early draft of the film, Fedora was intended to be Dr. Abner Ravenwood, but the draft was rejected and scrapped.[citation needed]\n\nHenry Jones, Sr.\n\n[edit]\n\nDr. Henry Walton Jones, Sr. (Sean Connery) is Indiana's estranged father, who was distant from his son due to his obsessive study of the Holy Grail and its possible location. Captured by Nazis in 1938, he is rescued by his son, and in the process of racing the Nazis to the Grail's location, they become closer. Alex Hyde-White stood in for Connery in the film's 1912 prologue, and the character was played by Lloyd Owen in The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, which showed his anger at his son running away to fight in World War I. He also appeared in the Young Indiana Jones novels and the graphic novel Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny (set in 1945). At the time of the events of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in 1957, it appears the elder Dr. Jones has already died in 1951.[29]\n\nWalter Donovan\n\n[edit]\n\nWalter Donovan (Julian Glover) is an American businessman who desires the Holy Grail in order to achieve immortality and the main antagonist of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. He secretly works with the Nazis, and sends both Indiana and his father on the search for the Grail without their knowledge of his ties to Nazi Germany. He fatally shoots Henry in order to force Indy to clear the traps for him. After Indy does so, Donovan and Elsa follow him into a room filled with cups, one of which is the Grail. Donovan remarks that he is not a historian so cannot know what the true grail looks like. Elsa purposely chooses a false grail – a bejeweled gold cup – for Donovan, who falls for her deception, remarking that it \"certainly is the cup of the King of Kings\". When he drinks from the false grail, he ages so rapidly that his body crumbles to a skeleton and then dust in seconds.\n\nGlover enjoyed playing the part because of the character's ambiguous nature:\n\n\"What would you do, if you had the chance of having eternal life? That's quite a question. Where would you draw the line? People say [Donovan] was a Nazi, he wasn't a Nazi, he joined the Nazi Party in order to investigate its property, and he bloody nearly got that. Only because he was greedy did he [fall]. This is an advice for you [the viewer]: always choose the pewter cup. It applies to everything. An allegory for life.\"[69]\n\nIn an early script of the film, Donovan's surname was set to be Walter Chandler, and he was set to die in Hatay, when the Nazi tank falls off a cliff (a fate that would later go to Ernst Vogel), but the script was changed. The character of Walter Donovan was partially based on Irish American businessman and politician Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., father of the 35th President of the United States John F. Kennedy.[citation needed] Kennedy Sr. was the United States Ambassador to Great Britain during the 1930s and was known for his advocacy of isolationism and appeasement towards the Third Reich.\n\nIsla Blair, Glover's wife, cameoed as Mrs. Donovan in the scene where he and Indiana discuss the Holy Grail. The in-joke was conceived by one of the producers.[70]\n\nPanama Hat\n\n[edit]\n\nPanama Hat (Tim Hiser and Paul Maxwell) is a minor villain who appears in the prologue of the film. He hired grave robbers to dig up the Cross of Coronado, which is immediately stolen by a teenage Jones. A horse chase and pursuit on board a circus train follow. Indy escapes, returns to his home, and attempts to talk to his father, who rebuffs him. The Sheriff arrives with Panama Hat's men, and Indy is forced to give the Cross back. Panama Hat is seen taking back the cross and handing a stack of money to the gang.\n\nIn 1938 Jones steals the Cross again, this time on a ship, but is caught. He struggles with the villain's men and gets the cross back. Indy jumps off the ship as a giant fuel drum rolls wildly, falling directly onto a crate of TNT. The crate explodes, causing the entire ship to blow and seemingly killing Panama Hat and his crew, with the former's shredded hat floating past Jones.\n\nIn the novelization of the story, it is stated that Indiana's final showdown with Panama Hat began because he got word from a worker of the villain that his boss had an affair with his wife and he wanted revenge. Jones realized it was a set-up and was told by Panama Hat that he had been hit badly by the Great Depression and was auctioning off the cross to wealthy buyers. He got one deal from a buyer with a provision that said he had to kill Jones. Indy would later suspect the buyer was Walter Donovan.\n\nElsa Schneider\n\n[edit]\n\nDr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody) is the secondary antagonist of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and an Austrian archaeologist who desires the Grail, and like Donovan, keeps her involvement with the Nazis a secret. She is revealed to have seduced both Joneses, Henry first and then Indiana, and it is implied that she is more fond of the latter. Later, she deliberately picks a false grail for Donovan as revenge after he shoots Henry, and watches him decay into a skeleton before her eyes. Afterwards, she crosses the temple's seal with the Grail, causing the temple to collapse and her to drop the Grail as well as nearly falling into a chasm. Indy catches her, but she sees the Grail on a shelf of rock and greedily reaches for it despite Indy's warnings. Her hand that Indy is holding slips out of its leather glove, causing her to fall to her death. According to Doody, Elsa's role as a femme fatale was an attempt to distance the character from Willie Scott.[71]\n\nIn an early script of the film, Elsa was going to be the one who shot Henry Jones, Sr. in the Holy Grail Temple, and she was set to die after drinking from the False Grail (a fate that which would later go to Walter Donovan), but the script was changed.\n\nIGN placed Elsa 33rd on their list of the best bad girls in film in 2008,[72] while Empire noted Doody \"achieved the unlikely feat of making a Nazi sympathiser sympathetic\".[60]\n\nKazim\n\n[edit]\n\nKazim (Kevork Malikyan) is the leader of the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, an ancient organization protecting the secrets of the Holy Grail. Kazim initially attempts to kill Indy and Elsa by setting fire to the petroleum-soaked waters of the Venice catacombs in which they are searching for clues to the Grail. After Indy and Elsa escape the catacombs, Kazim and his men chase them in speedboats and try to gun them down. Indy reluctantly saves Kazim from being cut to pieces in a boat engine propeller, and Kazim reveals his father's location after learning that Indy has no interest in finding the Grail. Kazim is later killed while leading an attack on a Nazi convoy closing in on the Grail. It was originally intended that when Kazim died, Elsa would step away and see her hands covered in blood (as a homage to The Man Who Knew Too Much), but Spielberg was unsatisfied with each take.[71] Malikyan was once in the running for the part of Sallah in the first film, but traffic made him late to the audition.\n\nIn the early script of the film, written by Jeffrey Boam, Kazim was set to be an agent of Hatay, named Kemal, seeking the Holy Grail and an ally of the Nazis. Also, he was set to die after drinking from the False Grail (a fate that which would later go to Walter Donovan), but the script was rejected and changed.\n\nVogel\n\n[edit]\n\nStandartenführer Ernst Vogel (Michael Byrne), also known as Herr Oberst (German for Mister/Lord Colonel), is an SS officer who aids Donovan in finding the Holy Grail. His main objective is to kill the Joneses — whom he hates because Indy killed three of his men in Castle Brunwald — on direct orders from Adolf Hitler. Vogel discovers Jones Sr. on a German Zeppelin bound for Athens, but Indiana throws Vogel out the window just as the Zeppelin is taking off. Later, Vogel and Donovan are heading towards the location of the Grail when Indiana ambushes their convoy. Indy and Vogel struggle on the back of a tank until it goes over a cliff. Vogel is killed in the ensuing crash.\n\nIn the early scripts of the movie, Vogel actually makes it to the Holy Grail Temple, and was set to be killed by getting crushed by a rock while trying to steal the Grail. Later, his death was changed to that of being beheaded by the Holy Grail Temple's traps (a fate that which would later go to a Hatayan soldier), but the scripts were changed.\n\nJulian Glover was the original choice to portray Vogel, but Robert Watts suggested him for Walter Donovan's role.\n\nGrail Knight\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Grail Knight (Robert Eddison) was the youngest knight of three brothers set out to find the Holy Grail. In the late eleventh century, he and his two brothers (Richard and a third sibling) became Knights of the First Crusade. During their journeys in the Holy Land, they discovered the Holy Grail and protected it at the Temple of the Sun in the Canyon of the Crescent Moon for 150 years, using the Grail's power to extend their lifespans. As the bravest and most worthy, he was chosen to remain as the Grail's sole guardian while his two brothers traveled back to Europe, leaving behind two markers leading to the Grail's location. The Knight lived in a side chamber off of the inner sanctuary of the Temple of the Sun. In time, a cult of protectors, the Knights of the Cruciform Sword, formed around the presence of the Grail, but it is not known whether these people knew about the Knight.\n\nIn 1938, Indy enters the sanctuary. There the knight tries to fight him to determine who should protect the grail but falls from the weight of his own sword. Gracious in defeat, the knight tries to pass on the responsibility of protecting the grail to Jones, but is interrupted by the arrival of Walter Donovan and Elsa Schneider. Donovan asks which of the cups is the Grail. The knight refuses to tell Donovan, saying instead that they must choose wisely as a final test, and also warning them that any of the false grails will take their lives. Donovan drinks from a golden jewel-encrusted grail, chosen for him by Elsa. He remarks that it \"looks like the cup of the King of Kings\", but it proves to be false and he crumbles into dust within seconds. The knight sympathetically says Donovan \"chose poorly\". Indy on the other hand selects a pewter grail (the cup of a carpenter) and is told he has \"chosen wisely\".\n\nThe knight warns them that if they take the Holy Grail past the great seal they will forfeit their immortality. Elsa Schneider ignores the warning and falls into a chasm created by an earthquake. The knight is last seen waving goodbye to Indy as the temple collapses, but is also relieved that the Grail is safe now that it is out of reach to anyone.\n\nIn the early scripts of the film, the Grail Knight was set to fight with Indy, but the script was changed. However, this idea was used in the level \"Temple of the Grail\" of Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures.\n\nHavelock\n\n[edit]\n\nHavelock (Larry Sanders) was the Scout Master of the Boy Scout troop in which Indiana Jones and Herman Mueller were members by 1912.\n\nAdolf Hitler\n\n[edit]\n\nMichael Sheard appears as Adolf Hitler, whom Jones briefly encounters at the book-burning rally in Berlin. Although a non-speaking role, Sheard could speak German and had already portrayed Hitler three times during his career.\n\nHeinrich Himmler\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the book-burning scene, Ronald Lacey, who played Toht in the Raiders of the Lost Ark, cameos as Heinrich Himmler.\n\nSultan of Hatay\n\n[edit]\n\nAlexei Sayle played the Sultan of Hatay.\n\nIntroduced in The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\n\n[edit]\n\nAnna Jones\n\n[edit]\n\nAnna Mary Jones (Ruth de Sosa) is the mother of Indiana Jones and the wife of Henry Jones Sr. Very little had been established about the character prior to production, so de Sosa was allowed to create many aspects of the character, in addition to the basics that had been established by Lucas.[73]\n\nIn the series, Indiana is shown to have a strong relationship with his mother, whom he calls \"the sweetest, smartest, most wonderful woman who ever lived\".[74] In the unaired episode \"Florence, May 1908\" (later released as part of The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones: The Perils of Cupid), Anna briefly has an affair with composer Giacomo Puccini. She also reveals she is from Virginia.[75] Although it is explained she died of scarlet fever in the series,[76] it is contradicted in new footage shot for the 1999 re-edit, where Indiana explains she died of influenza.[77] In The Lost Journal of Indiana Jones, it is stated that Anna died on March 3, 1912, aged 33 years.\n\nShe was first mentioned in passing in Raiders of the Lost Ark; Indy remarks Brody \"sound[s] just like my mother\" when discussing the dangers of finding the Ark. In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Indy's father Henry does mention that her death drove him and his son apart. Indy does believe that his mother \"never understood\" his father's obsession with the Holy Grail, though Henry says she supported him fully. In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Indy indirectly mentions her, when he tells Mutt Williams (his son and her grandson) that people only get one mother and sometimes not for very long.\n\nPreviously, the 1989 computer game, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure, came with a replica of Henry's diary which had named her Mary.[78] More recent publications, such as the Lost Journal of Indiana Jones, rectify this by making Mary her middle name.\n\nSusie Jones\n\n[edit]\n\nSusie Jones was the sister of Indiana Jones, daughter of Anna and Henry Jones Sr., along with posthumous aunt of Mutt Williams and Sophie Jones. Indiana and Anna mention her in \"Peking, March 1910\" (later edited into Journey of Radiance), where Susie is implied to have passed away from poor health as a baby.\n\nFrank\n\n[edit]\n\nFrank (Stephen Graf) is the cousin of Indiana Jones, nephew of Henry Jones Sr., and son of Grace. He appears in the second half of Young Indiana Jones and the Curse of the Jackal, where he and Indiana go to Mexico, but get separated when Indy ends up meeting Pancho Villa. Frank's appearance was later edited into the second half of Spring Break Adventure, with Stephen Graf returning to shoot additional scenes for the bridging segments.\n\nGrace Jones\n\n[edit]\n\nGrace Jones (Deborah Strang) is the mother of Frank, aunt of Indiana Jones, and sister of Henry Jones Sr. She appears in Spring Break Adventure. The character was created for the bridging segments, when they edited \"Princeton, February 1916\" and the second half of Young Indiana Jones and the Curse of the Jackal together.\n\nRemy Baudouin\n\n[edit]\n\nRemy Baudouin (Ronny Coutteure) is a Belgian who becomes the comrade-in-arms and best friend to the young Indiana Jones during World War I. He meets the 16-year-old Indy in Mexico while fighting under Pancho Villa: he joined the Villistas because his Mexican wife Lupe had been murdered by the Federales. After seeing newsreel footage of the devastation of his country by the Germans in World War I, Remy resolves to return to Europe to join the Belgian army and defend his homeland, and Indy decides to join him.[74] After fighting on the Western Front and being wounded, Remy wearies of life in the trenches and transfers with Indy to the Belgian forces fighting in Africa. They later transfer together to the secret service.\n\nHelen Seymour\n\n[edit]\n\nMiss Helen Seymour (Margaret Tyzack) is Indiana's tutor during his father's worldwide lecture tour from 1908 to 1910. Miss Seymour had taught Henry Jones, Sr. at the University of Oxford.[74] In one of the final episodes broadcast in 1996, she dies just before Indiana returns to visit her in Oxford after the war has ended. Her maid gives him her final letter, in which she urges him to finish his education and reconcile with his father.[79]\n\nIn a comic book adaptation of the first episode, it is explained she dislikes her old classmate T. E. Lawrence due to their divided religious beliefs (her father was a minister).[80] Seymour also appears in three books based on the series. In one, she inherits a fortune, and is courted by a Colonel (whom Indiana is suspicious of) aboard the RMS Titanic.[67][81][82]\n\nT. E. Lawrence\n\n[edit]\n\nA fictionalized version of T. E. Lawrence has a recurring role in the series. He first appeared in the pilot episode, Young Indiana Jones and the Curse of the Jackal, and appears or is mentioned multiple times throughout the series. Lawrence is portrayed by Joseph Bennett and Douglas Henshall.\n\nDemetrios / Claw\n\n[edit]\n\nDemetrios (Vic Tablian) is a Greek demolitions expert, who later becomes an arms dealer in Mexico. He appeared in the pilot episode, Young Indiana Jones and the Curse of the Jackal, where Indiana Jones encounters Demetrios, while visiting an archeological dig in Egypt, in 1908. Demetrios murders a man, and steals an Egyptian jackal headpiece. Indiana encounters Demetrios (then known as \"Claw\", having lost one of his hands) again, while Indiana rides with Pancho Villa in 1916. Demetrios sells arms to Pancho Villa, while also selling information to General Pershing. Indiana confronts Demetrios, who is still in possession of the Jackal headpiece. Demetrios tries to kill Indiana, but is himself killed in an explosion, while Indiana gets away with the Jackal headpiece. Demetrios' encounters with Indiana Jones were later edited into the films My First Adventure and Spring Break Adventure. Demetrios was portrayed by Vic Tablian, who had previously portrayed Barranca and the Monkey Man in Raiders of the Lost Ark. All three of Tablian's characters attempts to kill Indiana Jones.\n\nPancho Villa\n\n[edit]\n\nA fictionalized version of Pancho Villa. He appears in the second half of the episode Young Indiana Jones and the Curse of the Jackal (later edited into the second half of the film Spring Break Adventure), where he encounters a 16-year-old Indiana Jones in Mexico. Indy mentions this encounter in the 2008 film Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Pancho Villa was played by actor Mike Moroff.\n\nFrederick Selous\n\n[edit]\n\nA fictionalized version of Frederick Selous. He first appears in the episode \"British East Africa, September 1909\" (later edited into the first half of the film version Passion for Life). He returns in the episode Young Indiana Jones and the Phantom Train of Doom, where Indiana Jones is reunited with Selous, upon arriving in Africa in 1916. In Young Indiana Jones and the Phantom Train of Doom, Selous is a Captain with the 25th (Frontiersmen) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (as was the real Frederick Selous). In both of his appearances, Selous is portrayed by Paul Freeman, who had played Dr. René Emile Belloq in Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nPrincess Sophie of Hohenberg\n\n[edit]\n\nA fictionalized version of Princess Sophie of Hohenberg. She appears in the episode \"Vienna, November 1908\" (later edited into the first half of the film The Perils of Cupid). Sophie becomes the first love of a then 9-year-old Indiana Jones. She becomes the first girl that he ever kisses, but he is forbidden from seeing her further. Before they are separated, Sophie gives Indiana a locket with her picture in it. Indiana can be seen wearing the locket from \"Princeton, February 1916\" (Spring Break Adventure) all the way up to Young Indiana Jones and the Hollywood Follies (set in 1920). In the original broadcast version of \"Vienna, November 1908\", Old Indy references having encountered her later in life. Sophie was portrayed by Danish actress Amalie Ihle Alstrup. However, for the episode \"German East Africa, December 1916\" (edited into Oganga, the Giver and Taker of Life), a photograph of the real Sophie of Hohenberg was used for Indiana's locket.\n\nGiacomo Puccini\n\n[edit]\n\nA fictionalized version of Giacomo Puccini. He appears in the episode \"Florence, May 1908\" (later edited into the second half of the film The Perils of Cupid). Puccini becomes infatuated with Anna, Indy's mother, and pursues her romantically. Puccini asks Anna to run away with him. However, in the end, Anna makes the choice to stay with her husband and son. In the original broadcast version of \"Florence, May 1908\", it is implied that Puccini based his opera 1910 La fanciulla del West on his affair with Anna Jones. Giacomo Puccini was portrayed by Georges Corraface.\n\nNancy Stratemeyer\n\n[edit]\n\nNancy Stratemeyer (Robyn Lively) is Indiana Jones' high school sweetheart. Nancy is a fictional daughter of Edward Stratemeyer (the creator of Nancy Drew). Nancy first appears in the episode \"Princeton, February 1916\", where she and Indiana investigates a theft from Thomas Edison.

She attempts to alert Schmidt, but is captured by Indiana before she call tell him. Indiana leaves Nadia tied up and gagged in a closet, but he soon lets her out to give her food. When he removes the gag, an angry Nadia calls him an idiot, and threatens to have him thrown out of the espionage corps.

Indiana kills Stefan, and Molly dies in Indiana's arms.\n\nMaria Straussler\n\n[edit]\n\nMaria Straussler (Simone Bendix) is a woman working for American Intelligence in World War I. She appears in the unaired episode \"Transylvania, January 1918\" (later edited into the second half of the film Masks of Evil, with the events being moved towards the end of the war). Indiana meets Maria, when he is sent to Romania to investigate a Romanian General named Mattias Targo, together with American spy Colonel Waters (Keith Szarabajka). Maria reveals that she is engaged to French spy François Picard, one of the Allied agents previously sent to investigate Targo. She works with fellow Allied agents Nicholas Hunyadi and Dr. Franz Heinzer. Colonel Waters is reluctant to bring a woman with them, due to the danger involved. In response, Maria asks to borrow the Colonel's knife, which she reveals to have already picked from his pocket. She then proves herself an expert with knives, by throwing it within an inch of the Colonel's head. At Targo's castle, she is reunited with François (who has seemingly been turned into an undead by Targo, who is revealed to be a vampire), who exposes Dr. Heinzer as an Austrian double agent. Heinzer shoots François (seemingly killing him for a moment), which causes Maria to throw a knife into Heinzer's heart, killing him. Maria is captured by Targo, together with Indiana and Nicholas Hunyadi (whom Targo kills). Targo attempts to drug Maria, but she tricks him (only pretending to drink the drug), allowing her to save Indiana from Targo. She and Indiana later destroys Targo by driving a stake through his heart. An act that frees all the people under Targo's control, including François, leaving their dead bodies spread about. Afterwards, Maria and Indiana head back to their superiors in Venice. Unlike Dr. Heinzer (Austrian) and Nicholas Hunyadi (Romanian), Maria's nationality is never established.

The next day, Lily was thrown out of town (implied to be because of prostitution), and onto the ship, that Indy and Remy were leaving on. Indy showed her kindness (the first that she had experienced in over a year, during which she had been miserable), and the two developed feelings for each other (though, Lily warned him about being seen with a woman like her). As Lily did not have a cabin of her own, Indy let her sleep in his bunk (while he shared Remy's). When the ship was robbed by pirates, Lily was revealed to have the box that Indy and Remy had been looking for. Lily claimed that Zyke had told her that they would be partners, but had tried to kill her, so she had killed him. Together with Indy and Remy, Lily followed the ship belonging to the pirates. She managed to get her hands on the box, but was shot by pirate captain Jin Ming. Indy tried to get Lily off the pirate ship, in a desperate effort to save her life, but she died in his arms. Lily's last words to Indy were: \"Goodbye, my prince\".\n\nJin Ming\n\n[edit]\n\nJin Ming (Alice Lau) was a Chinese pirate captain in 1918. She appears in the TV movie Young Indiana Jones and the Treasure of the Peacock's Eye. She is first introduced as a singer, on board a ship that Indiana Jones and Remy Baudouin travel on.

As a result, Indiana, Remy, and bargirl Lily followed the pirates to their ship. Jin shot and killed Lily, while she was trying to get away with the box. However, Jin was forced to flee with her crew after their ship caught fire, taking the box with them. Indiana and Remy followed them to a small island. The island quickly proved inhabited by killer natives, who attacked Jin's crew. Jin's crew did their best to shoot at the natives, but Jin was struck in the leg by a spear, and dropped the box (which Remy quickly grabbed). She was presumably killed by the natives, along with the rest of her crew.\n\nAmy Wharton\n\n[edit]\n\nAmy Wharton (Brooke Langton) is an American upper-class woman, whom Indiana Jones briefly dates in 1919.

Claire and Indiana departs on friendly terms, when he goes back to the University of Chicago.\n\nJohn Ford\n\n[edit]\n\nA fictionalized version of famed Western director John Ford. He appears in the TV movie Young Indiana Jones and the Hollywood Follies. He befriends Indiana Jones in 1920, after Indiana comes to Universal Pictures to shut down the runaway production of the Erich von Stroheim picture Foolish Wives. After Indiana fails, and gets fired (ending up stranded in Los Angeles, without the money for a ticket back to Chicago), Ford hires Indiana as his assistant for his upcoming film Six Steps to Hell (a fictional movie, though, potentially inspired by Ford's 1917 film Straight Shooting). When one of the lead actors is killed from a snake bite, Ford gives the actor's role to Indiana. After all of the film's stuntmen are injured, Ford asks Indiana to perform a dangerous stunt with a wagon, which Indiana requests $60 (most of Indiana's tuition at the University of Chicago) for. Ford agrees to his demand, and shoots the sequence (which resembles a famous stunt sequence in Ford's 1939 Western Stagecoach, and the truck stunt sequence in Raiders of the Lost Ark). John Ford was played by Stephen Caffrey.\n\nSpike\n\n[edit]\n\nSpike (Mark Auerbach) is the grandson of Indiana Jones, who appears in the bookends of the two-part episode \"Young Indiana Jones and the Mystery of the Blues\". Spike is an aspiring rock musician, who drives Indy, and the neighbors, crazy, with his band's practicing. When the episodes were re-edited into the Adventures of Young Indiana Jones movies, the bookends with Spike were dropped in favor of bookends with Harrison Ford (set in 1950). Spike is apparently the son of Sophie, who cameos at the end of the episode.\n\nSophie Jones\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the Chrononauts character, see Chrononauts: Futureshock § Characters.\n\nSophie Jones (Susan Bigelow) is the daughter of Indiana Jones (the identity of her mother is never established), who appears in the bookends of the episodes \"Ireland, April 1916\" and \"Chicago, May 1920\" (and the bookends for the episode \"Peking, March 1910\", played by a different actress). In the episode \"Ireland, April 1916\", it is established that she has a daughter named Lucy, a granddaughter of Indy. Her appearance in \"Chicago, May 1920\" indicates that she likely is also the mother of Spike. However, it is unknown if she is the mother or aunt of Indy's other grandchild, the much older Caroline. \"Chicago, May 1920\" indicates that Sophie, and her children, live with Indiana in his house on Staten Island. The character's scenes were removed, when the episodes were re-edited into the Adventures of Young Indiana Jones movies (which deleted all old Indiana Jones bookends). Lucas first and later Frank Darabont in his script for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Indy and Marion were going to have a 13-year-old daughter (it is unknown if said daughter would have been a younger version of Sophie), but Spielberg objected to this idea,[86] and the character of Mutt Williams was created instead. The bookends for \"Vienna, November 1908\" establishes that Indy has several children,[87] making it possible that Sophie is simply Mutt's sister or half-sister (depending on whom her mother is). The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones films and the first four Harrison Ford movies shows Indiana Jones having multiple sexual partners for decades, starting with Mata Hari in 1916, before he marries Marion Ravenwood in 1957.\n\nCaroline Jones\n\n[edit]\n\nCaroline Jones (Candy Aston) is the granddaughter of Indiana Jones. It is unknown who her grandmother was. It is also unknown if Caroline is the daughter of Mutt (conceived at some point before his death), Sophie, or another child of Indiana Jones (in bookends for \"Vienna, November 1908\", Old Indy references having multiple living children). Caroline is also the mother of Harry Jones, Indy's great-grandson. She appears in the episode \"Peking, March 1910\", where she attends a family Thanksgiving dinner with her grandfather. The character's scenes were removed, when the episodes were re-edited into the Adventures of Young Indiana Jones movies (which deleted all old Indiana Jones bookends).\n\nHarry Jones\n\n[edit]\n\nHarry Jones (Jeremy Gerber) is the great-grandson of Indiana Jones, and son of Caroline Jones. He appears in the episode \"Peking, March 1910\", where he attends a family Thanksgiving dinner with his great-grandfather. The character's scenes were removed, when the episodes were re-edited into the Adventures of Young Indiana Jones movies (which deleted all old Indiana Jones bookends).\n\nAnnie Jones\n\n[edit]\n\nAnnie Jones (Joy Miller) is the great-granddaughter of Indiana Jones. She appears in the episode \"Peking, March 1910\", where she attends a family Thanksgiving dinner with her great-grandfather. It is unknown if Annie is the daughter of Caroline Jones, or another of the adults at the dinner. The character's scenes were removed, when the episodes were re-edited into the Adventures of Young Indiana Jones movies (which deleted all old Indiana Jones bookends).\n\nIntroduced in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\n\n[edit]\n\nMac\n\n[edit]\n\nGeorge \"Mac\" McHale[58] (Ray Winstone) is an anti-hero who is a friend with Jones. He is a spin on Sallah, Belloq and Elsa.[88] Mac served in MI6 during World War II, working with Indiana (who worked for the Office of Strategic Services).[89] Writer David Koepp said Mac represents the confusion of the Cold War, with Winstone concurring \"figuring out who you were working for and who you were working against must have been crazy\".[90] Mac's look was inspired by a photo of Ernest Hemingway wearing boots, so Winstone was told to tuck his pants into his boots and \"rock\" them throughout the film.[90] Mac calls himself a \"capitalist\", and frequently makes his decision based upon what he gets in return. Mac is also extremely greedy, enthusiastic to accompany Indy to Akator, a \"city of gold\", and expresses clear frustration when Akator does not turn out to be what he expected, calling the venture a \"waste of [his] time.\" Mac is eventually sucked into a vortex created by aliens to another dimension. It is not clear whether Mac died after being sent to the dimension.\n\nMac reappeared in the novel Indiana Jones and the Army of the Dead. Set after the second World War, he and Indiana battle German and Japanese agents, a voodoo priest and legions of the undead for the Heart of Darkness, an object made of pearl and ebony in Haiti.[91]\n\nIrina Spalko\n\n[edit]\n\nColonel Doctor Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) is a Soviet agent born in a small village in the eastern regions of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, she was believed by those in her village to be a witch as her apparent psychic powers began to manifest themselves through animal control. She is skilled in fencing and hand-to-hand combat and is Indiana's main antagonist as she brings the crystal skull to Akator to utilize the power there as part of the Soviet Union's experiments in mind control. Her desire for knowledge proved her undoing when the crystal skull entity grants her desire to know everything, overloading her mind and causing her to disintegrate as her scattered essence is teleported to another dimension.\n\nFrank Marshall said Spalko continued the tradition of Indiana having a love–hate relationship \"with every woman he ever comes in contact with\".[92] Blanchett had wanted to play a villain for a \"couple of years\" before being cast.[93] Spalko was modeled on Marlene Dietrich,[90] while her bob cut was George Lucas' idea and was inspired by Louise Brooks.[clarification needed][89]\n\nIn an early script of the film, Spalko was set to fight with Williams in a real virgin jungle, but the idea was scrapped because of the risks.\n\nUma Thurman was considered for the role of Spalko, but she declined.\n\nAntonin Dovchenko\n\n[edit]\n\nColonel Antonin Dovchenko (Igor Jijikine) leads a company of Soviet soldiers to aid Spalko on the quest for the crystal skull. He is ruthless and despises weakness. Dovchenko is large in stature and a brutal hand-to-hand combatant. The character is a tribute to the muscular henchman Pat Roach played in the first three films.[90] He fights Indiana several times until Indy finally beats him and his dazed body gets carried off and eaten alive by siafu ants in the jungle. Hasbro released 3.75-inch (95 mm) and 12-inch (300 mm) action figures as well as an Adventure Heroes model,[94][95][96] and is available in two Lego playsets.[97]\n\nGeneral Ross\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneral Bob Ross (Alan Dale) was an American general whom Indiana Jones befriended during the second World War. In 1957, after Jones was coerced by Soviet agents to find alien remains in Hangar 51, he was trapped in Doom Town and barely survived. During his subsequent interrogation by FBI agents Smith and Taylor, General Ross arrived and vouched for Jones, insisting that he was not someone who would side with the Communists. Later, when Mac revealed to Jones during a chase through the Amazon jungle that he was a double agent working for the CIA, he mentioned that General Ross was his control agent, and he had secretly contacted him to bail Jones out of the aftermath of the Hangar 51 intrusion. However, its unclear if this was the truth as Mac later admitted to lying about being a double-agent though its possible he really might've called Ross to help Jones out. Ross later attended Indiana's wedding to Marion Ravenwood.\n\nDean Charles Stanforth\n\n[edit]\n\nDean Charles Stanforth (Jim Broadbent) is Indiana's friend at Marshall College.[98] The character replaces Marcus Brody following Denholm Elliott's death in 1992.[90] Stanforth resigns to protect Indy from government agents who want him on trumped up Communist charges, and is later reinstated, with Indy joining him as the Associate Dean.\n\nMutt Williams\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Mutt Williams\" redirects here. For the baseball player, see Mutt Williams (baseball).\n\nMutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf), born Henry Walton Jones III,[36] is introduced in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull as a Panhead motorcycle-riding greaser and becomes Indiana Jones' sidekick. He is the rebellious son of former bar owner Marion Ravenwood and archaeologist Indiana Jones, although Indy and Mutt are unaware of their relationship until the events of Crystal Skull.\n\nHaving never met Jones after birth, Mutt believed that his British stepfather, Royal Air Force pilot Colin Williams, was his biological father, until he and his mother are reunited with Jones in 1957. Mutt accompanies Indiana to Peru to search for his mother, his surrogate father-figure and mentor, Harold Oxley, and the crystal skull. Mutt, who has travelled extensively with his mother, never graduated from school. Mutt is highly intelligent and excels at fencing (which proves useful in his duel with Spalko) and other practical adventuring skills. After both Mutt and Indiana discover their relation, the latter is furious that his son is a dropout and is determined to get him back to school. Mutt also resents his father as a schoolteacher despite his also being an adventurer and hates Indiana referring to him as, \"Son\". They gradually develop their relationship towards the end of the film, when Mutt serves as his father's groomsman when Indiana and Marion finally marry. Later on, sometime before Dial of Destiny, Mutt enlists in the US military and is killed in the Vietnam War.\n\nMutt has a horizontal scar across his right cheek inflicted during a duel with Irina Spalko. Mutt has stated that his prep-school education has made him \"handy with a blade\". The novelization explains Mutt was champion on the fencing team, but was kicked out of school for placing bets on his matches. Mutt's occupation prior to meeting up with Indy is that of a motorcycle mechanic. It is implied that he has a fear of scorpions (similar to his father's fear of snakes and his late paternal grandfather's fears of rats and heights).\n\nFrank Marshall said Mutt represents a youthful arrogance, to show Indiana is older and wiser.[99] LaBeouf was Spielberg's only choice for the role.[40] Excited at the prospect of being in an Indiana Jones film, LaBeouf signed on without reading the script and did not know what character he would play.[100] LaBeouf watched Blackboard Jungle, Rebel Without a Cause and The Wild One to get into his character's mindset, copying mannerisms and dialogue from characters in those films, such as the use of a switchblade as a weapon.[101] Authentic 1950s jackets were found for LaBeouf's costume,[90] while The Indian Motor-Company provided his motorcycle.[102]\n\nGeorge Lucas was interested in producing a spin-off centered on Mutt and his own adventures, with Indiana in a supporting role. However, Lucas later retracted a statement on the possibility of a spin-off series or LaBeouf taking over as the lead of the Indiana Jones series, stating \"Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones, no Harrison means no Indy\".[103]\n\nTwo 3.75-inch (95 mm) figures of Mutt,[94] a deluxe figure of him on his motorcycle,[104] an Adventures Heroes figurine,[95] and a 12-inch (300 mm) figure were released in 2008.[105] Mutt is available in four Lego Indiana Jones sets based on Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.[97]\n\nIn 2017, Dial of Destiny writer David Koepp revealed that the character will not return in the fifth film.[106] It is revealed that the character died while serving in the Vietnam War prior to the film's events taking place, causing his parents' estrangement out of grief over his death.\n\nHarold Oxley\n\n[edit]\n\nHarold \"Ox\" Oxley (John Hurt) born in Leeds, England, is a colleague of Indiana who broke off contact with him in 1937 while searching for the skulls.[107] Both Ox and Indiana studied under Abner Ravenwood. Ox was a close friend of Ravenwood's daughter, Marion, and hence became a surrogate father for her son Mutt, following the death of Mutt's stepfather. He is also aware of Mutt's true paternity to Indiana. Ox's wits have been addled by long exposure to one of the crystal skulls.[36] As soon as the skull is returned to Akator, Ox regains his sanity, and is last seen at Indy and Marion's wedding, clapping enthusiastically. The character was inspired by Ben Gunn from Treasure Island.[90]\n\nThe character of Oxley was created by Frank Darabont in his script of Indiana Jones and the City of the Gods. However, in his scrapped script, Oxley's name was Vernon Oxley.\n\nColin Williams\n\n[edit]\n\nColin Williams was a friend of Indiana, Marion's first husband, Mutt's stepfather, and another unseen character. He and Marion started dating when Mutt was three months old and were married. He was an RAF pilot and died in the line of duty during World War II.\n\nIntroduced in Dial of Destiny\n\n[edit]\n\nHelena Shaw\n\n[edit]\n\nHelena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) is the daughter of Basil Shaw, who fought with Indy during the Second World War and was eventually driven mad by the Antikythera. She is Indiana's goddaughter and she plays a vital role in this film. She is first seen during the university scene, where Indiana Jones teaches class.\n\nDr. Jürgen Voller\n\n[edit]\n\nDr. Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) was a German scientist, astrophysicist and \"former\" Nazi during World War II who was later hired by NASA under the name \"Dr. Schmidt\" to run the Apollo Moon landing program for them, while using CIA assets to search for the Antikythera, a time travel device built by the ancient Syracusan mathematician Archimedes which Voller intends to use to travel back in time to 1939 and assassinate Adolf Hitler.\n\nIn 1944, Voller discovers the Lance of Longinus in a Nazi fortress. He reports this to his superior, Colonel Weber. When they duck after hearing an explosion, Voller realises that the Lance is a replica. On a Nazi train headed for Berlin, Voller tells Weber that the Lance is a fake, but tells him that there is another relic on train. This is revealed to be one half of the Antikythera, a dial built by Archimedes that could allow for time travel. Voller explains that the power of the Antikythera is mathematics, instead of supernatural. Weber dismisses the Antikythera, asking Voller if he's ever met Hitler. Voller and Indy first encounter each other on the train, when Indy punches him, then Basil discovers the Dial half, which Indy tells him to take. Voller finds Basil and Indy with the Dial, and tells them to drop the gun (which Basil had), and then to give him the Antikythera. Indy throws something to Voller, and Voller is then hit by a metal pole.\n\nBy 1969, Voller has been recruited by NASA, and helped with the Apollo 11 Moon landing. He has been given the alias of 'Dr. Schmidt' from Alabama University. In his hotel room in New York, he asks the attendant bringing his food about his racial identity, and also if he fought in the war. Before the attendant leaves, Voller tells him that the Americans didn't win the war, but Hitler lost. He is still searching for the first half of the Dial, stolen by Indy in 1944. His accomplices in the CIA find where Helena Shaw is, which is at Hunter College with Indy. After the parade chase, Voller is being interviewed by a journalist. When the journalist asks if he intends Mars to be the next victory in the Space Race, Voller tells him that he's moving to the next frontier, as space has been conquered. Voller also makes a disparaging remark about the President when it is recommended that he has his suit pressed. He encourages the journalist to use the remark. Voller is informed by Agent Mason that they found Helena and Indy, but they escaped. Instead of flying to Los Angeles to collect a medal from the President, Voller secures a private charter that takes him, Klaber and Hauke to Tangier, Morocco. Voller arrives at the auction with Klaber and Hauke. When Indy recognises him from 1944, Voller tells him that he is confused, as his name is Schmidt, who comes from Alabama University. He tells Helena that the Dial is his, but Indy tells him that the Dial isn't his, because he stole it, and then Voller tells Indy that he also stole the Dial. During the chaos at the auction, Teddy runs into Voller, who then takes the Dial back. Voller, Klaber, and Hauke take a Mercedes-Benz to the airport, before Indy, Helena, and Teddy catch up to them on a tuk tuk. After the tuk tuk chase, they are captured by Agent Mason and the CIA. He is informed that the government wants him to vanish, as his accomplices blew up a nationally televised parade, killed 3 people, and then they went to Morocco, and created an incident that required military extraction. Voller asks to be taken to DC so he can explain, but Mason tells him that the government never cared about the Dial, only getting to the moon, and they only allowed Voller to search for the Dial in order to keep him happy. As the pilot informs them of their destination, Voller insists that he's not going back to Alabama. He tries to persuade Mason to continue the search for the Dial's second half, but she declines. At this point, Voller's accomplices take control of the plane, and kill Mason, when she intervenes. Voller tells her that his name isn't Schmidt, his name is Jürgen Voller. Whilst Indy and Helena search for the Grafikos in the Aegean Sea, Voller and his accomplices take control of Renaldo's boat, killing the crew. When they return with the Grafikos, Voller tells Indy that he's pleased that he isn't wasting his retirement, to which Indy tells him that he should have retired him when he had a chance. After Voller and Klaber wash the dust off of Grafikos, Voller asks Indy to read it, as it is in a code, Polybius, and Voller isn't familiar with it. Indy refuses, so Voller kil"
