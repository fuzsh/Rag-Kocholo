Updated\n\nby the P.O.W. NETWORK 2020.\n\nREMARKS: BTL - LFT FR DED - LATR BOD GONE - J\n\nSYNOPSIS: On November 11, 1967, PFC Edwin Martinez-Mercado, PFC Gary Shaw,\n\nPVT John Stuckey and SP4 Robert Staton were all members of the 173rd\n\nAirborne Brigade on a search and destroy mission in Kontum Province, South\n\nVietnam, when the unit engaged an enemy force.\n\nFollowing the battle, the three were judged to have been killed in action,\n\nand were left on the battlefield for later recovery. A few days later, the\n\narea was searched for casualties, but their bodies could not be found.\n\nThe three members of the 173rd killed on November 11, 1967 are listed with\n\nhonor among the missing because no remains were found. Their cases seem\n\nquite clear. For others who are listed missing, resolution is not as simple.\n\nMany were known to have survived their loss incident. Quite a few were in\n\nradio contact with search teams and describing an advancing enemy. Some were\n\nphotographed or recorded in captivity. Others simply vanished without a\n\ntrace.\n\nWhen the war ended, and 591 Americans were released in Operation Homecoming\n\nin 1973, military experts expressed their dismay that \"some hundreds\" of\n\nPOWs did not come home with them. Since that time, thousands of reports have\n\nbeen received, indicating that many Americans are still being held against\n\ntheir will in Southeast Asia. Whether the men from the 173rd are among them\n\nis not at all likely. What is certain, however, is that if only one American\n\nremains alive in enemy hands, we owe him our best effort to bring him home.\n\n----------------------------\n\nRuling that son died in Vietnam ends vigil\n\nPublished 1996\n\nBy Michael D. Sallah\n\nBlade Staff Writer\n\nFor 29 years, Don Shaw waited for his son, Gary, to walk through the\n\ndoorway.\n\nSo many times, the father would stare at pictures of son, and break down in\n\ntears......\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHe was born in Windsor, Nova Scotia and he no marker.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n02/2020"
