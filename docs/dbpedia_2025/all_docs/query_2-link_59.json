        "text": "Welsh actor (born 1944)\n\nFor the priest, see John Rhys Davies (priest).\n\nJohn Rhys-Davies (born 5 May 1944) is a Welsh actor known for portraying Sallah in the Indiana Jones franchise and Gimli in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. He has received three Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, with one win, and a Primetime Emmy Award nomination.\n\nRhys-Davies is also known for his performances in the films Victor/Victoria (1982), The Living Daylights (1987), The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004), Aquaman (2018) and its sequel Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023). He is also known for his extensive voice work including Aladdin and the King of Thieves (1996), The Jungle Book 2 (2003), Gargoyles (1995–1996), and SpongeBob SquarePants (2000–2002).\n\nHe also gained acclaim for his television roles as Macro in I, Claudius (1976), Vasco Rodrigues in Shōgun (1980), and Michael Malone in The Untouchables (1993). From 1995 to 1997, he portrayed Professor Maximillian Arturo in Sliders.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn Rhys-Davies was born in Salisbury on 5 May 1944,[1] the son of Welsh parents. His mother, Phyllis Jones, was a nurse, while his father, Rhys Davies, was a mechanical engineer and colonial officer.[2]\n\nDue to his father's work as a colonial police officer, he was raised in Tanganyika (today part of Tanzania) before his family moved to the Welsh town of Ammanford.[1] While in Tanganyika, his family lived in places such as Dar es Salaam, Kongwa, Moshi, and Mwanza. He was educated at independent Truro School in Cornwall and then at the University of East Anglia, where he was one of the first 105 students admitted and became a co-founder of its drama club. After a stint teaching at a secondary school in Watton, Norfolk, he won a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nRhys-Davies appeared sporadically on UK television in the early 1970s, including his role as the gangster \"Laughing Spam Fritter\" opposite Adam Faith in Budgie. Later he played Praetorian officer Naevius Sutorius Macro in I, Claudius. He then began to appear more frequently, and not just in the UK, with roles as a Portuguese navigator Rodrigues in the 1980 television miniseries Shogun, based on the novel by James Clavell, and as Sallah in the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark.[3] He reprised the role of Sallah in two subsequent Indiana Jones films.[4]\n\nIn 1989, he played Marvel Comics character Kingpin in The Trial of the Incredible Hulk.[5] Rhys-Davies also starred in another Clavell adaption, Noble House, set in Hong Kong, in which he plays Ian Dunross' corporate enemy, Quillan Gornt.[6] He has since appeared in numerous television shows and miniseries, including Agent Michael Malone in the 1993 remake of the 1950s television series The Untouchables[7] as well as a leading role in the television series Sliders as Professor Maximillian Arturo from 1995 to 1997.[8]\n\nHe also appeared in Reilly, Ace of Spies in 1983, made several appearances in Star Trek: Voyager as a holodeck version of Leonardo da Vinci,[9] starred as an ally of James Bond in The Living Daylights, and appeared in the film One Night with the King. Davies has played the character Porthos in two separate projects; a two-part episode of The Secret Adventures of Jules Verne, and the Hallmark Channel film La Femme Musketeer. He appears in the full motion video cut scenes of computer games including Ripper (as Vigo Haman) (1996), Dune 2000 (as Noree Moneo) (1998), and the Wing Commander series (as James Taggart, doubling as the voice of Thrakhath nar Kiranka in the third game of the series).\n\nIn 2004, he narrated The Privileged Planet, a documentary that makes the case for intelligent design.[10] He also provided narration in the MTV series Wildboyz around this time. In 2013, he appeared in the family history programme Coming Home, in which he discovered information about his grandfather's life in the Carmarthenshire coal mines.[11]\n\nIn 2014, he joined the cast of the television show Metal Hurlant Chronicles to play Holgarth, an immortal alchemist.[12]\n\nIn 2015, he had a role in the single-player campaign of the PC game Star Citizen alongside Mark Hamill and Gary Oldman.[13] The work consisted of full body motion capture, including facial expressions and his voice; it was recorded primarily at the Imaginarium studios in the UK.[14]\n\nThe Lord of the Rings trilogy\n\n[edit]\n\nRhys-Davies appeared as the dwarf Gimli in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The cinematography of the films was aided in that Rhys-Davies is tall – 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m), compared to the actors playing hobbits at around 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m).[15] Therefore, although his character was supposed to be short, he was properly in proportion compared to the hobbit actors. Had he been of more similar height, shots of the entire fellowship would have required three camera passes rather than two.[16]\n\nRhys-Davies is the only one of the nine Fellowship of the Ring actors who did not receive a tattoo of the word \"nine\" written in the Tengwar script; his stunt double, Brett Beattie, was offered the tattoo instead as Rhys-Davies was disinclined to get one himself and Beattie had spent so much time as his double that he almost received co-credit.[17]\n\nRhys-Davies suffered severe reactions to the prosthetics used during filming, and his eyes sometimes swelled shut. When asked whether he would consider returning to the role for the film version of The Hobbit, he said, \"I have already completely ruled it out. There's a sentimental part of me that would love to be involved again. Really I am not sure my face can take that sort of punishment any more.\" He added that this time around \"[t]hey've got a different set of problems ... because you've got 13 dwarves, a whole band of them ... You're trying to represent a whole race ... You're trying to do for dwarves what The Lord of the Rings did for hobbits.\"[18] He offered help as a dwarf advisor in 2011, but ruled out returning as Gimli in The Hobbit because of the punishing makeup required.[19]\n\nVoice work\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to voicing the Ent Treebeard in Lord of the Rings, Rhys-Davies has lent his distinctive voice to many video games and animated television series, including the role of Hades in Justice League, the original voice of Man Ray in SpongeBob SquarePants (until both roles were recast with Bob Joles), and numerous times in Gargoyles (1994–1996), as the character Macbeth. He also lent his vocal talents to the games Freelancer (as Richard Winston Tobias) and Lords of Everquest (both in 2003) and the game Quest for Glory IV: Shadows of Darkness, which was released with his narration on a CD-ROM version in 1995. He also had a voice role on Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance as the character Jherek, and narrated a documentary called The Glory of Macedonia. Next Generation magazine gave its Dune 2000 review 'an automatic one-star deduction for featuring John \"Multimedia Whore\" Rhys-Davies in the FMV.'[20]\n\nJohn Rhys-Davies' voice can be heard on the 2009 documentary Reclaiming The Blade.[21] In the narration, Rhys-Davies explores swords, historical European swordsmanship and fight choreography on film, a topic very familiar to him from his experiences in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, where his character wielded an axe in many scenes.\n\nIn 2004, he was the unknowing subject of an internet prank that spread false rumours in several mainstream media sources that he was scheduled to play the role of General Grievous in Star Wars Episode III.[22]\n\nRhys-Davies is the narrator of The Truth & Life Dramatized audio New Testament Bible, a 22-hour, celebrity-voiced, fully dramatised audiobook version of the New Testament which uses the Revised Standard Version-Catholic Edition translation. In 2011, he presented KJB: The Book That Changed The World, which features him reading diverse snippets from the King James Version.\n\nJohn Rhys-Davies’ voice work also includes voice-over work with Breathe Bible.[23]\n\nIn 2016, he provided spoken words for Voices of Fire, the sixth album by a cappella power metal band van Canto.[24]\n\nA resident of the Isle of Man since 1988, John Rhys-Davies provides the introductory voice-over to the Island's Castle Rushen, one of the best-preserved medieval fortresses in the British Isles. In 2018, he lent his voice to the Isle of Man's tourism commercial.\n\nRhys-Davies voice was recorded for some of the callouts in the 1993 Williams SuperPin Indiana Jones: The Pinball Adventure.[25]\n\nIn the 2023 video game The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, he reprises the role of Gimli and narrates the opening scene.[26][27][28]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nRelationships\n\n[edit]\n\nRhys-Davies married Suzanne Wilkinson in December 1966, and they had two sons together. Although they legally separated in 1985, they remained married until her death from Alzheimer's disease in 2010. They remained friends, and he took care of her in her final years.[29]\n\nIn 2004, Rhys-Davies began dating Lisa Manning. They have a daughter together, and split their time between homes in the New Zealand region of Waikato[30] and on the Isle of Man.[31]\n\nReligious views\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen it comes to religion, he holds Christianity in high regard and has stated that \"Christian civilisation has made the world a better place than it ever was.\"\n\nIn February 2020, Rhys-Davies stated, \"All the things that we value, the right of free speech, the right of the individual conscience, these evolved in first and second century Roman Christendom, where the individual Christian said, 'I have a right to believe, what I believe and not what the Emperor tells me.' From that our whole idea of democracy and the equality that we have has developed. We owe Christianity the greatest debt of thanks that a generation can ever have, and to slight it and to dismiss it as being irrelevant is the detritus of rather ill-read minds, I think.\"[32][33]\n\nPolitical views\n\n[edit]\n\nRhys-Davies is not a member of any political party. He was a radical leftist as a university student in the 1960s, but changed his views when he went to heckle Margaret Thatcher, who he said \"shot down the first two hecklers in such brilliant fashion that [he] decided [he] ought for once to shut up and listen\".[34]\n\nIn 2004, Rhys-Davies said in an interview with World magazine: \"There is a demographic catastrophe happening in Europe that nobody wants to talk about, that we daren't bring up because we are so cagey about not offending people racially. And rightly we should be. But there is a cultural thing as well. By 2020, 50% of the children in Holland under the age of 18 will be of Muslim descent.\"[35] In an interview with the conservative journal National Review, he said that he is opposed to Islamic extremism because he believes that it violates the Western values of equality, democracy, tolerance, and the abolition of slavery.[34]\n\nRhys-Davies was vocal in his support for Brexit.[36]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Film Role Notes 1973 Penny Gold Rugby Player 1974 The Black Windmill Fake Military Policeman Uncredited 1975 The Naked Civil Servant Barndoor 1979 A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square Solicitor 1981 Raiders of the Lost Ark Sallah 1982 Best Revenge Mustapha Victor/Victoria Andre Cassell The Island of Adventure Smith 1983 Sahara Rasoul Sadat Gamal Abdel Nasser 1984 Sword of the Valiant Baron Fortinbras Kim Babu 1985 King Solomon's Mines Dogati 1986 Firewalker \"Corky\" Taylor 1987 The Living Daylights General Leonid Pushkin 1988 Waxwork Werewolf 1989 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade Sallah Rising Storm Donwaldo 1992 The Double 0 Kid Rudi Von Keseenbaum The Lost World Professor Challenger Return to the Lost World Professor Challenger 1993 Sunset Grill Stockton Cyborg Cop Kessel The Seventh Coin Captain Galil The Unnamable II: The Statement of Randolph Carter Professor Warren 1994 The High Crusade Bruder Parvus Robot in the Family Eli Taki / Rashmud / Sashri Blood of the Innocent Captain Shmuda 1996 The Great White Hype Johnny Windsor Glory Daze Luther Aladdin and the King of Thieves Cassim Voice, direct-to-video[37] Marquis de Sade Inspector Marais 1997 Cats Don't Dance Woolie the Mammoth Voice[37] Bloodsport III Jacques Duvalier The Protector Rasheed 1999 Secret of the Andes Father Claver 2000 Sinbad: Beyond the Veil of Mists King Akron, Baraka Voice Delta Force One: The Lost Patrol Ivan 2001 Never Say Never Mind: The Swedish Bikini Team Hakim The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Gimli, Gloin 2002 Sabretooth Anthony Bricklin Endangered Species Lieutenant Wyznowski Scorcher Matthew Sallin The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Gimli, Treebeard 2003 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King Coronado President Hugo Luis Ramos The Jungle Book 2 Ranjan's Father Voice[37] The Medallion Commander Hammerstock-Smythe 2004 12 Days of Terror Captain The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement Viscount Mabrey La Femme Musketeer Porthos The Lost Angel Father Kevin The Privileged Planet The Narrator Voice 2005 The Game of Their Lives Bill Jeffrey Chupacabra Terror Captain Randolph The King Maker Phillippe 2006 Shark Bait Thorton Voice, English dub[37] One Night with the King Mordecai The Legend of Sasquatch Ranger Steve Voice[37] 2007 In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale Merick The Ferryman The Greek Catching Kringle Santa Voice 2009 Reclaiming the Blade The Narrator 31 North 62 East John Hammond 2010 Tom and Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes Dr. Watson Voice, direct-to-video[37] 2011 KJB: The Book That Changed the World Self / Presenter Sophie and Sheba Alistair Winston Treasure Hunters Nathan Pickett Ferocious Planet Senator Jackson Crenshaw 2012 Escape Malcolm Andrews 2013 100 Degrees Below Zero Ralph Dillard Scooby-Doo!
