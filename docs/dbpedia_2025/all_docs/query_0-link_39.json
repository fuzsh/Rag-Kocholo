        "text": "Monkey status: There are monkeys featured in this film\n\nMy first memory of this film came from surfing the channels on the family television with the volume down and the lights off way after my bedtime some night back when I was seven or eight years old.\n\nI remember stumbling across the scene where an oil-covered zombie, played by Alan Trautman, stumbled out from the corner of a room and says ‘BRAAAAAINS’ in a voice that sounds like Leonard Cohen in slow-motion.\n\nNeedless to say it scared the shit out of little me. The figure underneath that mass of black stuff and slimy zombie skin looked emaciated anyway – it seemed to me that even if he took off the costume and did the scene just as a regular human I would have been terrified anyway. He just seemed to live in that border area, the abject. That was a word I probably didn’t know at the time – but it was an idea that we could all sure feel. That’s why dumb horror movies like this stick in our minds forever.\n\nIt should be noted that Alan Trautman, the fella beneath all of that make-up, went on to be a star puppeteer in the webseries Simian Undercover Detective Squad as an orangutan detective. So there’s some monkey points straight up.\n\nThis one is a bit of a cult classic in terms of dumb horror movies. It was created in part by John Russo, the co-writer of Night of the Living Dead alongside George A. Romero, who we talked about last week in our review of 1980’s Creepshow. After a falling out, the two decided to split the patent of the modern zombie right down the middle and go theirseparate ways.\n\nRomero went off to make Dawn of the Dead and the films that followed it, and they are sternly creepy films with a consistent tone and critical appeal to this day. Russo, along with director and co-creator Dan O’Bannon made this. It doesn’t really have a third act. The protagonist role is handed around like a baton in a relay as main characters get sick or die. James Karen moans like a literal newborn for two thirds of the run-time. It’s a really hot mess.\n\nThe gist of the plot is that the workers of a medical supply warehouse in Louisville, Kentucky, inadvertently start off a miniature zombie apocalypse after becoming contaminated with a government-created evil undead toxin. At the same time, a group of punks are getting naked in a nearby cemetery. Then a bunch of zombies show up, people yell ‘Jesus!’ at each other, and then all of the characters die in a nuclear blast. The end.\n\nThat’s the whole plot. The tone is so over-the-top that anything more sensical would be nonsensical. The lines are from the mouths of aliens trying to emulate humans after watching the home movies of Tommy Wiseau.\n\nFrom a monkey perspective, films like this kind of show how we are not so different from our furrier cousins. The characters wail and moan and run around and hit things with sticks. If you squint it looks a little like the first scene of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Linnea Quigley does an impromptu striptease in a cemetery and her gaggle of friends dressed as 80s stereotypes dance around her hollering like a pack of Chacmas. It’s fun.\n\nYou might watch wondering where our monkeys show up. This one is just for the eagle-eyed. Or actually perhaps not even them. Although monkeys are in this film, they aren’t actually even directly visible.\n\nAfter Bert chops up the animated cadaver, ties its body parts up in rubbish bags and takes them to his friend, Ernie the mortician (notice that the characters are named Bert and Ernie – and Trautman later worked with Jim Henson – curiouser and curiouser), the monkeys have their little cameo.\n\nSo in order to create the effect of the body parts moving around on their own accord inside the rubbish bags, wind-up monkeys with cymbals were used. The toys were wound up prior to the big scene and then let to play from inside the bags. The effect is a bunch of bin bags moving around creepily all on their own, and it’s perfect.\n\nSo it just goes to show – even when monkeys aren’t taking centre stage in a piece, they still somehow manage to contribute to the best of films. And the best of films this most certainly is.\n\nThis film has a lot more hiding under its unturned stones. Take Don Calfa’s character, Ernie. When we meet him he is listening to German War Marches on his walkman. He carries a luger, swears in German and has a picture of Eva Braun on his bulletin board. None of this is noticed or mentioned by the other characters. Did Dan O’Bannon simply decide to heavily imply that one of the heroes of his film is a Nazi?\n\nThe more you look into O’Bannon, the more you uncover. He’s probably most famous for writing the original screenplay for Alien. During the 1970s he was a college friend of John Carpenter’s and went on to make similar fare.\n\nBut he seems like an eccentric when you look at the internet’s opinion of him. During the making of this film, extras playing zombies were required to eat calf’s brains. Not wanting anyone to have to do something that he wouldn’t do, he organised the cast and crew around the set and had them watch as he ate them himself. OK, I called that eccentric – but he actually seems like kind of a good dude for that.\n\nHe eventually died of Crohn’s Disease. And before he died, he said that the inspiration for that chest-burster scene in Alien came from his experiences with it. Watching this film you have to wonder if James Karen’s agonising rigor mortis and Linnea Quigley’s morbid obsessions aren’t somehow connected to the writer’s experiences with chronic illness.\n\nO’Bannon died in 2009, but not before leaving us with a bunch of crazy films, and not least of which one which couldn’t have been the film it was without the participation of a bunch of toy monkeys.\n\nMonkey status: There is one ape in this film\n\nYou know, we dish out a lot of criticism on this website for the alleged ‘human-washing’ of major films (see our article on Gravity for further explanation), but Werner Herzog’s Encounters At The End Of The World is a spectacular exception.\n\nWe follow Herzog to Antarctica where he provides us with a stunning exposition of the great southern continent. Though as he so often does, Herzog introduces a distinctly existentialist bent to the film.\n\nHe arrives at the American McMurdo base and is instantly uninspired. The base is industrial-looking, crawling with Caterpillars, and reminds Herzog of a quarry. He wonders, “who are the people that drive the heavy machinery and what brought them to Antarctica?” It turns out one of them is a Russian philosopher with a love for Greek epics. He answers Herzog’s second question – natural selection.\n\nIt’s the people who want to fall off the margins of the map. They all end up at the same place, where all the lines converge. It’s then that Herzog realises he’s in his element.\n\nIn the perpetual summer daylight he spends days and nights with various outposts of scientists, studying various seemingly esoteric phenomena. Herzog was drawn to Antarctica in the first place by footage taken under the thick sea ice by his scientist friend. Herzog juxtaposes these fascinating other-worldly environments with the mundane reality of those who study them. We quickly learn that there isn’t a whole lot to do down there.\n\nMuch of the scientists’ down-time is spent watching old sci-fi movies on an antiquated computer monitor. A penguin researcher Herzog attempts to interview has in fact all but forgotten how to communicate with fellow humans due to his isolation. Even the penguins he studies are nihilistic.\n\nEncounters at the End of the World is visually perfect and thought-provoking from start to finish, but it’s crowning moment has to be one of cinema’s great ape cameos. The brilliance of the sequence itself is beyond humanly description, though what makes it truly remarkable is its context – you show me someone who expected a brushwork illustration of a chimpanzee riding a goat in a serious documentary about Antarctica and I’ll show you a bald-faced liar.\n\nHats off, Herzog.\n\nMonkey status: There are no monkeys featured in this film\n\nSpielberg’s Lincoln was hotly anticipated by pretty much the whole world at its release in 2012. Maybe it was the tale of a truly historical dude making the silver screen, or the promise of another crazy inhuman transformation of Daniel Day-Lewis by his creators.\n\nFor me, there were other reasons to be excited about this trip to the cinema. I have long been a subscriber to the theories put forward by historian George Kurylenko, even though he was dismissed as a crackpot by much of the academic mainstream.\n\nI first came across his writings in the basement of my university’s library. I was drawn by some crude graffiti somebody had scrawled across the cover of one of his thick doorstopper volumes – Here lies Curious George. Needless to say I was converted that evening there in the library and I never looked back.\n\nIf you’re not familiar with the works of Kurylenko, providing even a rough summary of the bulk of his theories here would be a Sisyphean task. His work covered the globe and the eons. His expertise was spread out across an entire world and an entire timeline, but was not the thinner for it. Some called him the backward-looking Nostradamus. Personally, I suspect that he was secretly a time-traveller.\n\nMy interest in Lincoln was borne from an interview I read with actor Anthony Hopkins, talking about his work on the film Amistad. Somewhere online in the very early days of the internet, I squinted through the dial-up to make out Hopkins’ words. He said that much of Spielberg’s approach to his treatment of the 1839 mutiny aboard the slave ship La Amistad off the coast of Cuba was informed by some of his favourite bedside reading – Spielberg was a fan of ol’ Curious George himself.\n\nSince then I watched Spielberg’s films with my eyes peeled for little tidbits of Kurylenko lore thrown in for the informed and observant. Mostly there was little to prove my suspicions, but then I heard of his plans to make Lincoln.\n\nKurylenko’s theory about Abraham Lincoln was way out of left field but also satisfyingly plausible when you sat down and thought about it for long enough.\n\nKurylenko posited that underneath his trademark stovepipe hat, Lincoln kept a squirrel monkey. The monkey lived under the hat whenever the two were in public together, and it would clutch at his hair as he took sharp corners in order to keep its position.\n\nThe public often wondered why Honest Abe’s towering hat managed to keep perched on his head through all kinds of athletics. This was why. The monkey, whose true name is unknown for sure but can be presumed to be named Ape-raham Lincoln, would remain crouched beneath the hat waiting to be of use to its master.\n\nKurylenko was of the opinion that Honest Ape helped its master to pen the Gettysburg Address. This little part of his theory isn’t held up by my much real world evidence.\n\nHowever, there is some that is more compelling – after Lincoln’s April 15 1865 assassination by John Wilkes Booth, passersby reported that a small squirrel-like animal had been seen fleeing from the theatre. It’s unknown what the final whereabouts of Ape-raham Lincoln are.\n\nSpielberg doesn’t show the little monkey on screen, and I think it was the right decision. Abe never showed his little friend in public, so it makes sense that his presence should simply be implied.\n\nBut you can see in the consternation of Daniel Day-Lewis’ face as he walks into Congress that something is obviously clinging unseen to the top of his head.\n\nMonkey status: There is one ape featured in this film\n\nThis film was one of those romantic comedies that critics acclaimed as a romantic comedy that deconstructed romantic comedy, like When Harry met Sally and Annie Hall. But at the end of the day those films are still just rom-coms. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, actually. I forget my point.\n\nOK the point was that I remembered seeing this film when it came out and I had this distinct memory of Joseph Gordon-Levitt riding a bike around anempty downtown Los Angeles at night with a little rhesus monkey poking its head out of the basket like a furry ET. So of course I had to go back and verify the memory.\n\nI don’t know what movie I was watching in 2009 but it definitely wasn’t this one. JGL’s bike doesn’t even have a carrier basket in this film!\n\nThis film has a lot of Regina Spektor music and conversations about greeting cards that I didn’t really understand. It doesn’t have many monkeys. They could have included a scene between Tom and Summer where they go on a date to the zoo or something, it wouldn’t even have seemed shoehorned!\n\nActually, on that note – the characters are seen watching The Graduate, a movie which contains a scene identical to the one I just described. We could have watched Tom and Summer watching a movie with a monkey in it. That would have been several levels of monkey-ness.\n\nSo I watched the credits roll with a sinking feeling. My mind seemed to have artificially inserted a monkey into my memory of a film again. It seems to be happening more and more these days.\n\nI wasn’t going to accept that grim reality just yet, though. I rewound right back to the start and sat through the film’s 95 minute runtime again. And again. And again. Until the sun was peeking in between my banana print curtains.\n\nIt was mid-afternoon before I hit paydirt.\n\nTom is hanging out with his friends Paul and McKenzie at a cafe cum arcade somewhere in Los Angeles. They are lounging over an old table-style arcade machine with coffees in their hands, talking about Tom’s crush on Summer. I sat there with my eyes glazed over watching this scene for the umpteenth time, despair beginning to ensnare my heart in her cold tendrils.\n\nAnd then I heard it – if you listen to the background noises beneath the banal dialogue spouted by Tom and his co-workers, you’ll hear it, too:\n\nThe arcade machine that Tom and his friends are hanging out over is Nintendo’s 1981 classic, Donkey Kong. The game is famous for being the first ever appearance of Mario, Nintendo’s flagship character. But the antagonist and titular character of the game is what interested me.\n\nDonkey Kong is a giant gorilla wearing a red necktie and nothing else. He was based in part on King Kong and Bluto from Popeye, and he is undoubtedly, incontrovertibly, undebateably, a non-human primate.\n\nSo it just goes to show. Never stop looking for the monkey in the movie. He may be hiding, but he will reveal himself to you if have the patience and the wherewithal to keep your vigil as long as it takes. Now I need some sleep.\n\nMonkey status: One ape-like creature is featured in this film\n\nRecently George A. Romero died at the age of 77 of lung cancer. To honour his legacy, Is there a monkey in it? has decided to take a look at some of his films. Acursory glance at his filmography revealed Monkey Shines: An Experiment in Fear (1988) but to be honest, that just seemed like low-hanging fruit. Is there a monkey in that movie? I mean, obviously.\n\nSo we checked out some of his other lesser known classics. He was best known for his zombie flicks such as Dawn of the Dead (1978) and the one that started the whole walking dead phase, Night of the Living Dead (1968).\n\nWhat not of people know is that he also directed a rom-com in 1971 called There’s Always Vanilla, about a guy leaving the army and then hilariously moving back home to Pittsburgh and relying on an old lady for total physical, emotional and spiritual support. I don’t know, I haven’t seen it – I was told there are no monkeys in it.\n\nWhat we did go back and dig up from its shallow grave was 1980’s Creepshow, a horror anthology film adapted from the works of Stephen King. Most of this film isshockingly monkey-less. We begin with a wrap-around narrative about a kid who likes to read horror comics. The little kid playing him is in fact Joe King, Stephen King’s son. Nowadays we know him better as author Joe Hill – he wrote that film Horns where Daniel Radcliffe walked around with inexplicable devil horns the whole film. Weren’t any monkeys in that one either.\n\nKing himself also shows up as Jordy Verrill and proves to everyone why he probably shouldn’t be on screen for anymore than a cameo. His acting co-star is a space fungus growing on his face and unfortunately it comes off more believablethan the Crimson King himself. When he shows up as a character in the upcoming Dark Tower movie franchise they are going to have to figure out a solution. He can’t do it himself. Maybe Jason Segel can sew Stephen King’s face over his own like in Face-Off. (Weren’t any monkeys in that one either, were there!)\n\nBut enough about movies that don’t have monkeys, because Creepshow ain’t one of them. While four of the five segments are totally monkey-less, The Crate pulls the entire film back from the brink.\n\nShot at Romero’s alma mater, Carnegie-Mellon University, this is a simple tale about a big ol’ box that’s been under a stairwell for 147 years. Inside a monstrous gorilla-like creature is discovered with an unmatched bloodlust. Another potential job for a simian actor squashed – the ape is played here by a puppet (which I might add, is almost indistinguishable from the real thing!)\n\nThe ape in the box kills anybody who comes close. The plot has it serve as a kind of physical manifestation of the protagonist’s murderous impulses – Henry Northrup, played by Hal Holbrook, is a meek and mild lecturer at the university who totally detests his wife, to the point of showing his gory daydreams of killing her in cold blood. When he learns of the creature in the box he oddly sees it as an opportunity to get his wife off his back – by having the thing rip her to bits and then eat the remains. Simple and understandable scheme.\n\nI don’t know how your average ape would feel about being portrayed in such a bloodthirsty way, but I guess we do have our human serial killers in films and we don’t complain about them. Maybe it was high time for a Gibbon Voorhees or a Hannibal Lemur.\n\nSo if you have a jonesing for something monkey-like pulling a bunch of people into a big crate and then tearing them to bits, look no further. One of the many sadnesses of Romero’s passing is that we will never see this creature’s future through his eyes. Where does it go after its escape? Are there more apes out there with similar bad attitudes?\n\nI mean, it’s sad we won’t say that, but I guess it’s sadder for his kids and stuff. Sorry if Isounded insensitive. It’s a bummer. Lung cancer, ay. Sorry.\n\nDedicated to the memory of George A. Romero\n\nMonkey status: Non-human primates are featured prominently in this movie\n\nTo celebrate the release of War for the Planet of the Apes, we here at Is there a monkey in it? decided to go way back to where it all began. Well, not quite – this monkey series really began with Pierre Boule’s 1963 novel, but this is a movie blog not a book one so we can’t talk about that. There are rules.\n\nThis is one of the famous depictions of primates in Hollywood. Everybody knows a shot or a line from this classic, from “Take your stinking paws off me you damn dirty ape!” to the iconic shot of the run-down Statue of Liberty.\n\nAs a result we all basically know the plot. A team of astronauts in far-off space crash-land on a mysterious planet that turns out to be run by a species of humanoid apes.\n\nWatching this film makes you miss the physical effects of an earlier Hollywood. We are all erect and excited about the visual wizardry of Weta Digital, as soon in the newest series of film, but there is still something missing. Our brains know on some level that we are looking at nothing at all. In this film, the gorillas and the orangutans are real. You can basically smell them through the screen.\n\nThe film is a polemic largely on different groups dehumanizing each other. Taylor, our human hero, takes the role of a lab monkey and is prodded and probed and generally treated like a beast. The apes react to him with disgust and patronising comments:\n\nLucius: Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?\n\nCornelius: It makes you look somehow … less intelligent.\n\nAt its most superficial level, the film puts us behind the eyes of the zoo animal. We experience Taylor’s losing end of the role reversal with him.\n\nOne thing interesting about the film is how they depict the ape civilisation. It is at anachronistic and varied levels of technological development and sometimes seems to have a heavy Greco-Roman classical influence. This hodge-podge creates a new and fresh vision o\n\nf culture which asks the question – say monkeys do go on to take over from us as custodians of this soil, what does that look like? What is monkey culture? Monkey language? Monkey rock’n’roll? Monkey jazzercise? Monkey chia pets? Monkey improv?\n\nIn deleted scenes Charlton Heston went through all of these ordeals. Rumour has it that a scene of him appearing on a monkey talk show was left on the cutting room floor by director Franklin J Schaffner.\n\nIn the film it seems like everybody has a reason not to speak. Taylor has a throat injury that renders him mute through about half the film and his co-pilot Langdon is lobotomised by the apes, taking away his power of speech.\n\nNova, the woman that Taylor ‘befriends’ in the zoo, never says a word.\n\nWell, her character is actually really problematic. All that she is given to do in the whole film is look sexy. Literally. Her character has no lines, no important actions, just follows Charlton Heston around like a pet. That element was kind of creepy, and with only one other speaking female character in the whole movie, it is safe to say that it wouldn’t pass the Bechdel Test. I guess that hadn’t even been invented yet.\n\nBut when it comes to the Monkey Bechdel Test (that is, the test of monkeys appearing in scenes with no humans and not talking about any humans), this film passes with flying colours. So for that, as well as the trippy desert cinematography and awesome kind of sun-drenched psychedelic gladiator set designs, this movie is a must-see.\n\nAnd of course the film did give us this: The Planet of the Apes Musical, in which Phil Hartman actually does a really good Charlton Heston impression. I love you, Dr Zaius!\n\nMonkey status: Non-human primates are featured prominently in this film\n\nThe third instalment of the new Planet of the Apes reboot series, we even get a bit of monkey quotient going in this film. There are no climbing monkeys with tails, but this film is chock full of ape characters. Of all named characters in the film, only three are human. The rest are gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans. Perfect.\n\nThis film was born out of the 1963 novel by Pierre Boule, La Planète des Singes, which detailed the adventures of a group of astronauts who land on a foreign planet where the roles of man and monkey have been switched.\n\nThe films deals with this idea, too, with humans suggesting to be regressing back into earlier pre-civilisation versions of themselves and the great apes rising up and taking their place on the planet as the dominant species.\n\nWar for the Planet of the Apes kind of glosses over the fact that these apes are from pretty radically different species and have really different social structures and lives in the wild. Some of them would never even come into contact with each other, like Maurice the Orangutan whose ancestors all hail from South-East Asia, and Luca, a Western Lowland Gorilla, who is therefore of African origin. The apes don’t even seem to be aware of some of their aesthetic differences, and just group themselves as one new species – ape.\n\nThis suggests that they aren’t even aware of these special differences. Maybe they just think Red the Gorilla is really buff. But then what are they to make of the swollen facial flaps Maurice carries his face between – its normal for an orangutan, but if they are considering him genetically identical to him they must think that he is tragically deformed. Well, they are still nice to him so that’s good.\n\nAs can be expected, this film is full to the brim with monkey references. Of course there are little nods to the original 1968 The Planet of the Apes, such as Caesar’s son being named Cornelius. It’s hard to say if the 1968 Cornelius and the 2017 Cornelius are meant to be the same ape – Charlton Heston’s voyage is meant to take place way in the future, right? Presumably questions like this will be answered in the next film, Around the Planet of the Apes in 80 Days.\n\nAnother reference are in the ‘Nam style army helmets we see the human soldiers wearing in the very first shot of the film as they stalk the apes through the Northern California woods. Like Full Metal Jacket, this movie features a lot of monkeys. Oh, no, wait, like Full Metal Jacket, the helmets are emblazoned with cute little messages like ‘Monkey Killer’ and ‘Bedtime for Bonzo’ – the latter being a film that starred a little-known actor named Roger Reagan starring alongside a chimpanzee.\n\nThe apes are also referred to as kongs by the soldiers. This is both another Vietnam War reference and a call-back to our King of all movie monkeys – King Kong.\n\nSpecial mention must be made to Steve Zahn in his role as Bad Ape, who shows up out of nowhere wearing a hoodie to be comic relief. Even a total monkey movie is best served with a side of monkey comic relief. And one point he holds binoculars up to his face the wrong way round and his reaction is hilarious.\n\nSo for the discerning ape connoisseur, this film is perfect. What other blockbuster film features apes in lead roles on screen for most of its run-time? OK, maybe Space Chimps. But we’ll get to that one soon.\n\nMonkey status: This film features monkeys\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark was created an homage to old Hollywood serial heroes like Doc Savage and… um… Uncle Scrooge. It followed that such a script would take its hero to exotic locales like Peru, Egypt and… that big room with all the boxes of artefacts.\n\nPerfect opportunity for a monkey role. The Cairo scenes have one of the real classics of the genre. The capuchin that follows the main characters around for a few scenes is enshrined in the hearts of the world.\n\nGeorge Lucas’ first ideas for the script involved the monkey giving a Hitler salute. While this would have been a novel experience for audiences, one has to wonder exactly how an animal trainer would get the animal to perform the gesture. And while they were at it, why don’t they make it goose step as well?\n\nExtensive research by the team here at Is there a monkey in it? found that the Sieg Heil effect was created by hanging a grape off a fishing rod and dangling it above the monkey’s head. That’s what they call method acting.\n\nWe are treated to a monkey character that is villainous. He is shown hanging out with an Egyptian fellow (played by the multi-talented Vic Tablian, who also played a Peruvian mercenary in the same film) moonlighting as a Nazi henchman – by proxy that is a Nazi monkey.\n\nYou have to wonder what the life path was that lead the character to this place. Did Lucas have any ideas of back-story that he may h\n\nave shared with the actor? Maybe the political vacuum and economic wasteland of post-war Germany had driven this monkey to skid row, and reactionary politics were the only weapon that his limited brain function allowed him to see that he could even envisage fighting back with. Sounds sort of relevant to certain events of this year, doesn’t it?\n\nSo somehow that little Nazi monkey represents all of us. Searching for the way through this confusing world while holding onto the shreds of dignity we have left. But there’s a warning in there for our inner Nazi monkey. The poisoned dates.\n\nIt’s the monkey that takes the forbidden fruit in Sallah’s house and dies alone and uncared for on the floor, serving only as a warning to bigger animals that danger is afoot. If we keep on going in this direction, we too will be nothing but a little capuchin corpse on the sandy floor of an Egyptian man’s apartment.\n\nBut all that gross polemic aside, the monkey is really cute. It really pulls at your heartstrings that you don’t know whether to cheer for it or root against it. He may be on some level working for some pretty evil people, but he doesn’t know that! He’s just doing what he’s been trained to do, right? That’s what I want to believe.\n\nBut taking the monkey’s agency away in my head to preserve its morals kind of makes his story even sadder. He reaches for that poisoned date without the space in his head to conceive that it might pose a danger to him. His death is uncelebrated, his sentience feather dusted away into the great abyss of post-life with barely a word from Indiana Jones.\n\nOn a cheerier note, the monkey was voiced by the third highest grossing actor in Hollywood history, unbeknownst to many. In his turn as the ill-fated simian’s shrieks and cries, Frank Welker wowed critics – particularly with his soliloquy scene. But one has to wonder – are we humans really better at making monkey noises than the monkeys themselves? I knew human-washing would rear its ugly head again before too long.\n\nMonkey status: There are no monkeys featured in this film\n\nSpider-Man is back. For the third time in what, four years? We can expect another Spider-Man next year I suppose and this time Peter Parker will be even younger. Then we will go full circle and have Tobey Maguire CGI-d back into his teenage years for another swing at the box office.\n\nPart of the problem of rebooting this franchise so many times is that Spidey’s rogues gallery is starting to wear a bit thin. The villain propping this film up is The Vulture, whose main characteristic in the comics are being really old and being bald. I forget anything else about him – oh, he can also fly. The film gives this jokey character a little bit of weight by enlisting Michael Keaton to play him and updating the story to that of a modern Tony Soprano with access to alien technology.\n\nMainly it works. Keaton chews up the scenery and Spider-Man is much more like his comic-book counterpart than we have seen before. But this a retread of some tropes that we are all pretty familiar with by now, and this version of The Vulture is basically just a palette swap of Spider-Man’s arch-nemesis, The Green Goblin, down to the whole zooming around on a high-tech flying machine to his weird and slightly shoe-horned paternal relationship with other characters. He’s a dad- but he’s evil- and he can fly- and he hated Spider-Man- and- we’ve seen it before.\n\nOf course, what else were they going to do? Make a movie about Mysterio? Mysterio is lame. He wears a fishbowl on his head and the rules of his powers are super unclear. How does he even make his illusion things? I’m sure plenty of people know but I am not one of them, and I’m not about to lookit up. Oh, maybe I will.\n\nOK, I’m back, I was sucked into that rabbit hole for a while.\n\nThe point is, the writers of these super-hero things seem to have a bit of a block when it comes to creating cool villains. We’ve seen it all before.\n\nSo I was disappointed when The Vulture swooped into screen. Up to that point in the film I’d been hoping for what could have been its saving grace – a move that would have breathed fresh life into the whole super-hero movie antagonist thing, and given us here at ‘Is there a monkey in it?’ a whole lot more to write about. Maybe it would have got the editor-in-chimp off my back.\n\nI’d say there’s a monkey on my back, but no, he’s a chimp. Easy mistake to make.\n\nThe answer that they totally missed was Hit-Monkey. Hit-Monkey is a Japanese Macaque who took up the mantle of a super-villain and swore revenge after an assassin killed his whole troupe. (Did you know that troupe is the collective noun for monkeys? Makes sense from where I’m sitting). In his adventures, Hit-Monkey came up against Spider-Man and even accidentally shot him at one point.\n\nThe Hit-Monkey story is gripping and dramatic, and something that hasn’t been explored in this whole MCU business. Why are we always watching humans and humanoid aliens? We have plenty of non-human primates wandering around the Marvel Universe doing cool stuff as well.\n\nThis movie would have been markedly improved if all of The Vulture scenes had been rewritten to feature Hit-Monkey. I’m not sure how the flying scenes would have worked, but I guess that would be the writer’s job to figure out. The monkey could jump around really quickly or something.\n\nMaybe the next Spider-Man outing will finally feature Hit-Monkey. Lord knows what else they are going to do from here: After lizards and rhinos and alien symbiotes, it seems they’ve already covered the rest of the animal kingdom.\n\nSo this was almost a film devoid of any reference to non-human primates. There is one scene worth mentioning, however.\n\nAt one point Spider-Man climbs the Washington Monument to save some people who are trapped inside or something. This made me wonder, can you actually go inside the Washington Monument in real life? I thought it was just a big concrete pillar. I guess that’s the kind of question that nobody will ever really know the answer to.\n\nAnyway, as Spider-Man reached the top of the obelisk, police helicopters arrive and circle around him. The camera spins around the top of the monument in a blatant reference to perhaps the most famous giant ape of all time.\n\nSo it goes to show, that even in a non-monkey film, the legacy of Monkey Hollywood is still there, influencing everything else in pop culture, slowly oozing out until everything is Monkey, you are Monkey, I am Monkey, We are all moving towards eternal and holy Monkey-ness together at the top of the Washington Monument as we look down on the Planet of the Apes rendition of the Lincoln Memorial and across state lines to the distant banana-coloured lights of Monkeyhattan where the coconut trees are always laden and the leopards suck at climbing.\n\n(At this point the tape recorder cut out. On closer inspection some mushy yellow residue seemed to have been jammed in the mechanism -Eds.)"
