We LOVE Maine and Disneyworld up north would be AWESOME !!!\n\nI agree with you!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMain Street, U.S.A.\n\nTime seems to soften amid the orchestral rhythm of ragtime and the clip-clop of horse hooves as they pull the old trolley. As the stress of contemporary life gives way to the quaint charms of yesteryear, we find ourselves in a little town that you might have seen all across America at the turn-of-the-century. On one hand is Town Hall, on the other is a fire station. We see a department store, the popcorn man, the old cinema, and all the many shops before us… This is, of course, the charming acreage of\n\nTown Square\n\nIn the center of the square, we find Elias Park. Well-kept lawns and vibrant planters surround a single bandstand adorned with graceful, pink flowers. The Main Street Philharmonic performs daily in Town Square, often taking to the streets with a selection of Disney favorites and synchronized marches. Sat beneath the cool shade of tall palms, aptly placed benches provide ample seating for the ongoing entertainment throughout the day. Of course, no Town Square would be complete without an appearance or two from the world famous Disney Characters. Throughout the day, starting promptly at 9:00 a.m., Mickey & Pals are there, eager to welcome guests to a day of fun and excitement here at Disneyland Park!\n\nTown Hall presides over the western half of Town Square, its mighty clock tower chiming every quarter hour. The American flag billows peacefully atop the building. As the in-park home of guest relations, friendly cast members are always on hand to answer questions, provide touring tips, make reservations, and assist guests with special needs. The Disneyland Fire Station provides a glimpse at a period facility of the sort, housing a real fire engine. It is here that the world-famous Dapper Dans often perform for Main Street visitors, respectively featuring barbershop standards, tap dancing, corny jokes and the harmonious Deagan Organ Chimes.\n\nLuggage dollies and baggage mounds addressed to far-off locales - some found elsewhere within the park - adorn the entrance to the Town Square Lockers, neighbored closely by the Baby Care Center, First Aid Station, and Lost & Found. To further set the Disney standard of excellence in customer service, self-service, coin-operated storage lockers are available for rent, complete with built-in electrical outlets, although portable, reusable chargers are available for purchase at an adjacent kiosk.\n\nHaving made their first stop outside Town Hall, the atmospheric Main Street Vehicles provide transport to and from the center of the park via the main thoroughfare. In this menagerie of transit, we are able to board an old-fashioned Fire Engine, Omnibus, or Horse-Drawn Trolley.\n\nWalt Disney may have done more to touch the hearts and minds of millions than any other man in modern history. He brought joy, happiness, and a universal means of communication to people of all nations. Certainly, our world shall know but one Walt Disney. It is in this legacy that Just One Dream: The Walt Disney Story casts its foundation. Held within the Town Square Exposition Hall, located to the eastern side of Town Square, a pre-show exhibits honor the legacy of the man behind the mouse. From a re-creation of his Burbank office to a scale model of the original Disneyland, artifacts and memorabilia recall the triumphs and heartbreaks of Walt Disney. In the main theater, the story of Walt's life is told in a style similar to The American Adventure at EPCOT Center. Utilizing animatronics, video clips and stirring music, we follow the life and times of Mr. Disney, all set to the strains of \"Just One Dream\", a song that used to underscore Golden Dreams at Disney California Adventure.\n\nThe theater exits out into Walt's Hobbies, a tribute to the childlike qualities of Walt Disney. This old-fashioned toy store sells model trains, doll house accessories, and other fine miniatures, combined with photos and memorabilia pertaining to Walt and his interests. Of course, these items are relatively simple when compared to the varying items of significant value - and importance - held in the museum down the road.\n\nIn a private collection of portraits, paintings, caricatures and sculptures, the Disney Gallery serves as a showcase for the artwork of Walt Disney Imagineering and Animation, past and present.\n\nMain Street\n\nFrom Town Square, we head down Main Street itself, a charming collection of storefronts and restaurants leading up to the park's Hub. Amidst the patriotic bunting, swaying palms and musical stylings of Scott Joplin and George Gershwin, we embark on a nostalgic stroll down Main Street. Here we experience the simpler pleasures of small town America as it were in the turn-of-the-century.\n\nThe sprawling Emporium occupies almost an entire block on the western side of Main Street. Renown as the largest shop inside Disneyland, the Emporium is beauty in all it is, complete with crystal chandeliers and sweeping rotundas, all built in the opulent, Victorian style.

House of Magic acts as Main Street's leading purveyor of fine magic, tricks, gags and novelties. Here, master magicians often perform sleight-of-hand tricks for passers by. Main Street Cinema harkens back to the early days of nickelodeons. Here, guests can enjoy classic Disney shorts in a cool, air-conditioned place. The Curious Curio Cabinet, marked by the famous Cigar Store Indian, completes the southeastern block, a collectible store to rival even the finest of antiquity dealers. Antiques of high value - and history - are for sale.\n\nThe soft glow of gas-lit streetlamps mark Center Street, the dead-center of Main Street, U.S.A. Here, the streets are wide open and merchants take use of the beautiful weather to sell wares outside. Market House harkens back to a turn-of-the-century restaurant, down to the finest detail. Found along the western stretch of Center Street, Market House offers fruits, vegetables, sweet treats, and some good old-fashioned comfort food. Crystal Arts, found on the eastern stretch of Center Street, sells exclusive Disney statuettes, glass miniatures, crystal castles, snow globes, dishware, music boxes, ornaments, and stylized silverware. Here, a talented glassblower creates hand blown souvenirs in full view of patrons, an attraction all its own.\n\nSherman Music Co., found to the northwestern block of Main Street, displays a surplus of music-themed wares. CDs--and even old records--can be found here, as an old phonograph plays some classic music from the turn-of-the-century, mixed in with the occasional Disney tune here and there. Next door, The Mad Hatter, a shop devoted exclusively to hats and head gear resides, complete with the world-famous mouse-ears. At the Candy Palace, peculiar treats and sweets of the period are sold from shelves stacked from floor-to-ceiling.

Odd inventory, such as marshmallow bouquets, chocolate Easter bunnies and peculiar popcorn varieties are in full supply. An old-fashioned Penny Arcade takes up residence next door, offering guests a world of old-fashioned arcade games and amusement. On the edge of the northwestern side of Main Street, overlooking the Hub, is Casey's, a tribute to the golden age of baseball. In this candy-striped place, classic baseball-themed shorts play as servers serve up classic ballpark fare: hot dogs, peanuts, Cracker Jack, you name it.\n\nOn the northeastern block, your attention is first pulled towards Ye Olde Christmas Shoppe, a year-round store where it is quite literally Christmas… 365 days a year! The scent of pine and gingerbread fill the air as we take in the fun sights and nostalgia of a turn-of-the-century Christmas. Even so, storefront window displays depict scenes from such holiday favorites as Pluto’s Christmas Tree, Donald’s Snow Fight and Santa’s Workshop. Come December, this is the place to go if you want to meet Santa Claus himself. Tying in with this frigid theme, the Main Street Ice Cream Company takes up residence next door.

As the stress of contemporary life gives way to the quaint charms of yesteryear, we find ourselves in a little town that you might have seen all across America at the turn-of-the-century. On one hand is Town Hall, on the other is a fire station. We see a department store, the popcorn man, the old cinema, and all the many shops before us… This is, of course, the charming acreage of\n\nTown Square\n\nIn the center of the square, we find Elias Park. Well-kept lawns and vibrant planters surround a single bandstand adorned with graceful, pink flowers.

Feel free to share any feedback you wish. Got a question or comment to ask? Post it right here!\n\nIt's great to see you back imagineering again DisneyMan.\n\nHave you ever thought about doing Discoveryland instead of Tomorrowland or as an additional land?\n\nP.S Can't wait for what you have in store for Adventureland.\n\nMy Tomorrowland will pretty much be a mix of Discoveryland at Disneyland Paris and the rejected Discovery Bay concept. I'll still call it \"Tomorrowland\", because I see this more like MK's Tomorrowland, showcasing a vision of the future as seen by times past. I plan to keep Disneyland to just five lands (Main Street, Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland and Tomorrowland), because I want this to be more like a tribute the original Disneyland...but on a much larger scale. Besides, I have plans for another park, so expect that popping up eventually.\n\nBTW, the backstory for this first half of Adventureland was inspired by an earlier version of @MANEATINGWREATH's excellent dream resort, so all credit to him!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe vast world of dreams offers many scenarios and places. Some project us into mysterious and exotic locales, worlds far away from every-day. These dreams become real in\n\nAdventureland\n\nPrimeval, exotic and mysterious, Adventureland is a wonderland of both fact and fantasy. In this timeless realm of exploration and discovery, we leave the everyday world far behind, for here the atmosphere is filled with the sights and sounds typical of an isolated trading post on some hidden jungle waterway. Our senses are stirred by the sights of lush jungle foliage, the harrowing sounds of not-too-distant wild animals, and the aromas of tropical blossoms.\n\nWe answer the call to adventure via boardwalk, akin to a distant port of call in some exotic region, seldom seen by modern civilization. The great sign welcoming you to the land, decorated with spears, primitive masks and...human skulls...glows eerily at night as nearby bamboo torches light up the surrounding darkness. Exotic creatures call out from the dense rainforest as a murky green river below flows out into the foggy abyss of this tropical setting. Our adventure is about to unfold...\n\nParadise Springs\n\nLet me set the scene: Dateline: 1922. An island somewhere in the South Pacific. A luxury liner crashed along the beaches of this island. The survivors were led by Old Betty, a 90-year-old woman with fond memories of past wars. Betty established Paradise Springs, discovered countless ancient mysteries, all the while made famous by wrestling and defeating a tiger with her bare fists. Although Betty has left this earth for the next, a statue in her memory lies in the middle of town, the monument boasting the moment when Betty stood proudly with one foot on top of the slain tiger. Naturally the swampwater beneath the earth has made its way to the surface and begun to create little spurts and geysers from within the statue.\n\nParadise Springs grew into somewhat of a tourist destination when notable archaeologist Dr. Indiana Jones discovered the ancient Temple of the Forbidden Eye while stopping at the island for supplies. Word got out of the discovery and soon enough tourists began flooding into the place, boosting the town’s economy and turning the rundown colonial fishing village into a luxurious tropical resort. Old Betty grew rich and created an elaborate mansion to the town's south while tourists from around the world began to explore the ruins of the old temple. Betty opened up the Jungle Navigation Co. to transport visitors on boat trips through the jungles where they'd get a chance to see the exotic wildlife and natural beauty for themselves. All was well until in 1934 when Indy mysteriously disappeared into the depths of the temple and perhaps even worse, Betty suddenly died. Locals believed it to be the work of ancient spirits and fearing the worse, tourists fled and Paradise Springs slowly became a desolate little fishing village as it was before. But that doesn't stop us from wanting to visit this town for ourselves and see what's going on...\n\nA hazy mist rains down from the trees as we enter the rundown colony, where tangled wires and excavation lamps illuminate the muddy streets and steamy swamps, flickering and fading in sync with a churning power generator in the heart of town. Crackling phonographs and old radios churn out big band rhythms of the ‘30s and ‘40s. The decrepit Statue of Old Betty trickles water from its foundation, depicting her legendary duel with a fearsome tiger. Tattered canvas awnings, collapsed ruins and rusted excavation equipment establish a theme among the symphonic chatter of exotic birds, mischievous monkeys and the rhythmic beating of distant tribal drums. Lush waterfalls, rushing streams and lazy bayous flow into cattail-infested bogs, where leeches and crocodiles undoubtedly lie in wait of blood. On the horizon, a crumbling, centuries-old temple looms before the haunting sunset. This is Paradise Springs, 1935.\n\nAmidst architecture reminiscent of British-Colonial India, Arabia, the Caribbean and French-Polynesia, we first come across the entrance to Aloha Isle, a vibrant market of fresh fruits, refreshing drinks, and the elusive Dole Whip. Nearby, the Adventureland Bazaar is where all manner of adventure-related materials can be found, ranging from human skulls to shrunken heads to golden doubloons to rubber snakes. Above the rooftops of the Adventureland Bazaar is Aladdin's Enchanted Passage, where we wander through a narrow maze of stone halls and towering domes, where, before our eyes, the timeless tale of Aladdinis retold through miniature scenes from the city of Agrabah. Aladdin, Jasmine, Abu, Jafar, and Genie can often be found meandering about in front of the Bazaar, or near the gate leading into Adventureland.\n\nA weathervane, shaped in the likeness of Colonel Hathi, teeters from the highest point of a crooked clock tower. Weathered planks and moss welcome us to the jungle's finest eatery, Colonel Hathi's Pizza Outpost, an old-time pizzeria, purported to belong to the pachyderm colonel himself. Inside, mosiacs depict scenes and characters from The Jungle Book, framed by rocks and rotted walls. Trees and vines spread out from the middle of the restaurant, quite fitting for a restaurant seemingly taken over by the jungle.\n\nPulsing drums and a mysterious mist invite us to stand in a gathering of towering totems, the weathered, wooden faces of a primeval culture. As the drumming of the Ancients echoes amid an ethereal fog, look out - the mischievous tiki gods are poised to burst in a torrential \"flood.\" Located near the heart of town, the Liki Tikis is a Polynesian-inspired water playground for explorers looking to relax, refresh and enjoy a break from the dreadful weather of the mighty jungle.\n\nNearby, a moss and vine-draped wooden pagoda plays host to our friends from Disney's three jungle-based films: The Jungle Book, The Lion King and Tarzan. Expect to find faces like Baloo, King Louie, Colonel Hathi, Timon, Rafiki and Terk; alongside their human friends Mowgli, Tarzan and Jane. The Adventureland Swingers, a Dixieland band inspired by ole’ King Louie himself, provide jazz and swing throughout the town, aptly draped in tattered clothing, withered moss and sticky cobwebs. And don't be surprised if some of our animal friends come along for a dance or two! Crocodile Mercantile, a rather scaly shop, sells the goods of a Natural History Museum - statuettes, fossils, gemstones, photographs, books - products aimed toward conservation efforts. Of course, the namesake crocodile can be seen waiting for a handout in the bog beneath the shop...\n\nWe wander past the bazaars and small cafes, and make our way down a flight of stairs toward an old boathouse, worn from years of monsoon damage, now rotting and entangled in rich foliage. What lies ahead is anyone’s guess… Native masks, hanging cargo nets, dusty photographs, timber canoes, preserved specimens and wooden crates stand out among the interior decor of this foreboding explorer’s launch. Before us is the world-famous Jungle Cruise.\n\nAs we leave the last outpost of civilization, we venture out into the exotic heart of darkness, where beautiful plants, fearsome beasts and other remnants of a pulp fictitious yesteryear reside… Aboard one of sixteen 30-passenger riverboats, we travel down twisted, “danger-filled” rivers through impenetrable jungles and mysterious waterways, where dancing natives and charging hippos roam. A band of exuberant gorillas invade a deserted safari camp, while a frenzied rhinoceros attempts to teach a misguided film crew the point of “location, location, location.” Per tradition, waiting around the final bend is Trader Sam, “Head Salesman in the Jungle,” offering his collection of shrunken heads in a climactic “Two for One” sale. Situated nearby the boarding station, held in an upturned Jungle Cruise boat, is Trader Sam's Outpost, the ultimate venue for Hawaiian attire, plush animals, tikis, masks, imitation shrunken heads, pop-guns, faux rifles, pith helmets, sunglasses, rubber snakes, plastic insects and other peculiar gifts. Though Sam is out on \"business\" in the jungle, the \"Head Salesman\" runs his shop with utmost pride, his own collection of shrunken heads and skulls hanging from his favorite chandelier.\n\nIn an alcove to the left, we find the entrance to an old cave, a cave where, as legend has it, shamans of jungle civilizations past gathered to weave the tales of the jungle. Some say these tales are still told, especially the tale known as the Legend of the Lion King. In this cave, the story of Disney's 32nd animated feature is brought to life. Utilizing large puppets, in-house effects, film clips, and Hans Zimmer's sweeping score, this is a show that is not to be missed.\n\nBack ashore, our travels bring us to the end of town. You know, as you wander through Paradise Springs, you may feel a sense of elation and happiness. Maybe that's the side effects of the Dole Whip, or maybe it's because of the charm of Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room. Held inside a nineteen-foot Balinese Temple, conjoint closely with a lavish spirit house, this show eatures the singing of some 225 tropical birds, flowers and tiki gods. The macaw hosts of our show - José, Michael, Fritz, and Pierre - have welcomed hundreds of thousands of guests into their special “world of joyous songs and wondrous miracles.”\n\nThe romance of Hawaiian steel guitars provide a musical backdrop for this lush oasis of swaying palms and colorful tiki gods. In a natural extension of the Enchanted Tiki Room, we find the entrance to The Voyages of Moana, a trackless boat ride through the world of Disney's 2016 film. Hopping aboard our own boats, we set sail with Moana as we re-live her quest to restore Te Fiti's heart. Along the way, we meet Maui, face Kakamora, explore Tamatoa's lair and get swept up in a great battle with Te Ka. Nearby, we find the Grotto of Motonui, a space evoking the ambience of a South Seas paradise, with lush foliage, cascading waterfalls and exotic blossoms. This is the place to go if you want to meet Moana herself.\n\nA bridge leads the way out of town, towards the deepest parts of the jungle, past crumbling ruins and ominous stone creatures, relics of a long-forgotten civilization. Miniature waterfalls and trickling streams point the path towards the place that stared all the troubles for Paradise Springs...\n\nAbout a year ago, in 1934, world renowned archaeologist, Dr. Indiana Jones, accompanied by Sallah, washed ashore after an artifact trade with René Belloq on a passing airship went awry. Soon taken in by the friendly folks of Paradise Springs, Indy recognized the island as the location from the little-known “Legend of Mara's Eye,” believing that the mythical Temple of the Forbidden Eye could indeed reside deep within the island’s jungle. Sure enough, it did, but then we all knew what happened next...\n\nNestled along the banks of a misty, forgotten river engulfed by a symphony of waterfalls, an overgrown bamboo forest gives way to the Temple of the Forbidden Eye itself, the home of the greatest adventure in Adventureland: Indiana Jones Adventure.\n\nWe follow Indy's footsteps into the dig site, where deadly booby traps, ancient relics and mysterious tales await. It's said that the god Mara is quite compassionate towards visitors, offering guests riches and fates no man had ever seen before. But, don't think it's all good: a hidden wrath lies in Mara should you look into its eyes...\n\nUndeterred by these warning signs and eager to make a profit, Sallah organized tours and set up shop deep within the temple, assuring would-be adventurers that treasures beyond their wildest dreams would await them inside... Despite Indy's initial reluctance, tourists began to disappear without a trace. Even so, Indy went into the temple to investigate, and hasn't been seen since...\n\nUnearthed artifacts and the remnants of an archaeological dig lead us toward a rusty motor pool, where well-worn troop transports await us for an unforgettable journey through a fantastic subterranean world. An off-road trip across a rickety suspension bridge leads us through ancient jungles and into the heart of the age-old Temple of the Forbidden Eye. Inside, our most incredible expedition begins. With Indy's help, we escape the supernatural wrath of Mara - whose powers against those who look in its eyes lead to eternal torment. We careen along precarious precipices that plummet into molten lava, avoid the screaming undead mummies of the temple's past victims, evade the waters of a torrential flood, swarms of insects and evil wraiths, a deadly sandstorm, the awe-inspiring, elemental power of Mara. Only one man is brave enough - or crazy enough - to save us... Indiana Jones! Naturally, we exit through a gift shop; Sallah's Souvenirs to be precise; the ultimate Indiana Jones gift shop.\n\nBack on the mainland, on a beaten path leading from the Legend of the Lion King, we find another well-worn building on the outskirts of the town. It's the mansion that used to house Old Betty--barely noticeable by day, but carefully avoided by night. Strangely, the mansion's grounds and courtyards are painstakingly groomed and well-kempt, as is the graveyard that was set up nearby the mansion, but as night falls, eerie lights pass from window to window, while the unnatural silhouette of an otherworldly wraith peers out from the attic window. As it seems, the old manor is apparently abandoned, as it has been ever since Old Betty kicked the bucket. The well-worn wooden architecture, draped in all sorts of jungle foliage, as well as the clock-tower standing steadfast nearby, eternally stuck at XIII (the Roman numeral for 13), have given residents and tourists alike a similar viewpoint. That is no longer the house of Old Betty. They've given it a new title: The Haunted Mansion.\n\nIn keeping with the tradition of having this Disneyland classic be in a different land, Adventureland has been chosen to play host to this foreboding abode. But, fear not--Adventureland's Haunted Mansion is just as foreboding as the other four Haunted Mansions worldwide. A peculiar chill shivers through us... The hairs on our neck stand straight up... And we feel as if someone is watching as we hasten past the gardens and graveyards... A high, cast iron-fence stands around the property... Is it there to keep somebody out? Or something inside... The massive doors creak open, as our \"Ghost Host\" urges us to step \"lively,\" others are just dying to get in... Inside is a rotting piece of real estate inhabited by 999 happy haunts from around the world. In this creepy Gothic atmosphere, we board a Doom Buggy for a supernatural journey through a labyrinth of frightful chambers. We glide past a casket-filled funeral parlor, a chilling séance circle, a haunting party in the grand ballroom, a \"swinging\" wake in the graveyard out back, and an unforgettable encounter in the attic, all guided by the ominous voice of our Ghost Host...\n\nDisneyland Maine's take on the Haunted Mansion ties closely to its brothers here in the States. Why mess with perfection, as I always say? So, expect a ride that borrows from both American versions of the ride, with a few new twists thrown in here and there. But no matter which way you slice it, the Haunted Mansion remains an unforgettable tour through the boundless realm of mist and decay, all culminating in a tour of Memento Mori Cemetery, an overgrown, almost ancient graveyard just outside the Mansion's crypt-exit. In this peaceful burial plot, we pay tribute to some of Hollywood's fallen icons, as well as some family pets and former residents of the Haunted Mansion, including Old Betty herself. Nearby, Swinging Wake Supplies offers us any and all merchandise themed around the Haunted Mansion...as well as few scary surprises...\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHow about that? Stay tuned, because there's still one more section of Adventureland to visit. Until then, keep posting any feedback you may have, and I'll see you next time!\n\nThank you for providing due credit. I plan on finishing my dream resort eventually.\n\nI'm still waiting anxiously to see the finished product!\n\nSo your Tomorrowland will explore visions of the future in a steampunk esque land? That's cool. I'm loving Disneyland Maine so far, and I wish you the best of luck for the rest of your resort; I'd love to see that second gate in the near future (though I probably shouldn't count my chicks before they hatch).\n\nThank you very much; and I promise, the second gate will be coming eventually!\n\nNow then, let's move on and keep exploring Adventureland.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAs we venture deeper and deeper into the jungles, we leave behind the tropical mystery of Paradise Springs and journey back even further in time...the early 20th-century becomes the 18th century, as it was during the Golden Age of Piracy. The waters of the Jungle Cruise pass underneath a bridge and out into a mighty lagoon on the edge of a seaport. In this seaport of collapsed shipwrecks, winding waterways and mysterious islands, many a brave buccaneer has once set sail for an adventure upon the high seas, undoubtedly involving vile sea monsters, cutthroat captains and buried treasure. Now, all that remains of this romanticized scene are crumbling relics of these adventurous tales. Ye come seekin’ adventure and salty old pirates, eh? Sure, you come to the proper place. But keep a weather eye open, mates, and hold on tight—with both hands, if you please. You have arrived at\n\nPort Royal\n\nhttp://www./wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160601120652570.jpg\n\nFrom the bridge leading to Port Royal, the remnants of former pirates begin to appear amidst the overgrown moss and swaying palms, many having fallen just short of their earthly duties. Amidst the shipwrecks, palms and jagged rocks of Pirate's Cove, the structural remnants of a former colony - presumably of the Spanish Empire - reside, ancient, well-worn, forgotten by time. The battle-scarred facade of the mighty La Fortaleza (Spanish for \"The Fortress\") soars above the treetops, a once-empowered stronghold meant to protect the thriving seaport from unwanted visitors. Tragically, the efforts of the colonists proved futile - the familiar skull and crossbones of the Jolly Roger soar proudly from the highest turret.\n\nThrough a secret entrance into the fort, we find ourselves lost in the flickering gloom of La Fortaleza's foreboding arsenals and dungeons, still left as they were prior to a devastating sea battle, where forgotten prisoners and deceased soldiers still reside. A crumbling passage leads into a lush, tropical lagoon at twilight. From this Blue Lagoon, we board a cargo ship to set sail with the \"wildest crew that ever sacked the Spanish Main!\"\n\nIn Pirates of the Caribbean, we sail off for a time earlier than the 18th century, a time where rowdy rogues and rambunctious rapscallions invade a sleepy, Spanish seaport. An ominous skull warns us of danger ahead as we plunge down a waterfall and into the sacked seaport. As the pirates auction off the town beauties, engage in sword combat, deplete the village rum supply, and battle with a moldering fortress, we clap along to the iconic tune of \"Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me).\" One plump pirate brandishes a frilly underskirt, having lost its lovely owner. A foul captain and his flutist first mate interrogate the googly-eyed magistrate by dunking him in the well. Drunken ne'er-do-wells set the seaport ablaze in a rum-induced stupor, culminating in a fiery finale.\n\nThis version of Pirates of the Caribbean should be a happy medium for fans of the original ride and fans of the film series. Jack Sparrow will still be part of the ride, but as in olden days, the pirates are more concerned with finding the treasure than finding him (thus explaining why Jack, who isn't part of the crew, has found it himself at the end of the ride). But despite Jack's part in the ride, the experience still focuses on Buddy Baker's epic score, the late X. Atencio's script and the breathtaking designs by Marc Davis and Claude Coats.\n\nThe Blue Lagoon Restaurant is perhaps Adventureland's most elegant dining location, simulating the romance and beauty of a Caribbean jungle in the glow of twilight. Here we dine under the moon and stars while boats carrying Pirates of the Caribbean passengers peacefully glide by, just before entering the cut-in-two hull of a proud galleon. Seafood is what's for dinner at this quaint veranda - surf 'n' turf, lobster bisque, fish and chips - while tattered flags, hanging lanterns and rusted lanterns provide ample lighting.\n\nUpon disembarking from our journey with the Pirates of the Caribbean, we make a quick detour through Pieces of Eight, where glittering jewels, treasure chests, gold doubloons and treasure maps hint at the loot within. Toy rifles, fool's gold, plastic cutlasses, hook-for-hand replacements, miniature telescopes, pirate hats, and eye patches are all for sale.\n\nOur travels whisk us through the ruins of this former Spanish seaport and into a dockside collection of shops, merchant stalls, and converted storehouses filled to overflowing with imports - obtained legally or otherwise - from around the world, starting with the aptly named House of Treasure. The House of Treasure is a true one-of-a-kind shop with a knack for knickknacks and keepsakes of the seafaring sort. Tortuga Tavern, a scoundrel's den of pirate-y treasures, has a mouthwatering menu of pulled pork, sliced beef brisket and grilled chicken breast, all served with beans and coleslaw. Of course, what tavern would be complete without wine, beer and rum?\n\nDocked on the edges of Port Royal is Jack Sparrow's ship, The Black Pearl. An appropriate bridge connects the mainland to the infamous vessel, allowing us to explore the inner and outer sanctums of Jack Sparrow’s beloved ship. Guests can scout all of the hidden artifacts, treasure maps, the cursed medallions and even the Dead Man’s Chest throughout the hull of the ship, collected by Captain Barbossa, Captain Jack Sparrow and the entire crew of the Black Pearl throughout their excursions. Interactive elements are naturally in great supply, including but not limited to an animatronic Jack the Monkey and a rum cellar that has been recently emptied...sigh...why is the rum always gone? Deep in the hull of the ship, lies a watery, gloomy passage. Here, guests can experience a simulated attack by the formidable Kraken, who seemingly drags the ship underwater! In another passage of the Black Pearl, a meet-and-greet is hosted with Captain Jack Sparrow himself. On the deck, guests can witness real pirates doing their daily chores of pillaging and plundering, they can use real telescoped the scout out the secrets of Adventureland and use the interactive water features to blast away their onlookers.\n\nBack ashore, The Bootstrappers, a motley band of musical pirates, bring a sense of atmospheric charm to the long-lost seaport. La Fuente de la Fortuna, meaning “The Fountain of Fortune,” operates from within the ruins of the former magistrate’s house (“Don’t tell him, Carlos! Don’t be chicken!”). Now, a familiar wishing well resides out front, not forgetting the interior storehouse for pirate attire. As such, the shifty shopkeep insists that his goods will provide good fortune for those who wear it. However, considering the rotted, pirate corpses hung from the gallows across the road, this \"good fortune\" is all but a myth...\n\nHonest Marooned Pete's offers us soft-serve yogurt, ice cream, juice and smoothies to quench our thirst after all that pillaging and plundering. The place is owned and operated by Honest Marooned Pete, a salesman who got his name after being stuck on an old island for quite some time. The East India Trading Co. acts as Port Royal’s resident gift shop, selling merchandise pertaining to the film franchise and attraction, including pins, “treasure,” and plastic pirate weaponry. This final (and thematically appropriate) port-of-call bids us farewell as our trip of Adventureland heads north towards a world quite unlike the 18th-century port-of-call we stand upon. The stone turns into wood...pirate ships turn into sternwheelers...it appears we have made the transition from Adventureland into\n\nFrontierland\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nI hope you're ready to face the \"wildest rides in the wilderness\", because at high noon tomorrow (provided I can the post finished by then), I'll take you to the next realm of Disneyland Park. See ya then!\n\nI apologize that this didn't come out promptly at high noon, as promised, but anyways, here's the next half of Disneyland\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nImagine...a proud sternwheeler makes its way up a muddy river. Stagecoaches and covered wagons make their way up the street, as simple townsfolk and Indians walk side by side. Gold miners sail out on makeshift rafts to the mines across the river, while music and laughter emits from the local saloon. And from the dense wilderness comes the whistling of trains and the lonely howl of a coyote, longing to be with its companions. The realm we have entered is an amalgam of sights and sounds that authentically conjure up images of America's expansion. Come by land, water, or rail, the pioneer days live on in\n\nFrontierland\n\nJust a short distance north of Adventureland's distinctly Polynesian-style entrance rests the fortress-style entrance to Frontierland, a representation of North America as it appeared over a century ago during the time of Manifest Destiny and many a prosperous Gold Rush. The aforementioned \"fortress-style\" entrance takes the form of Fort Lincoln, an accurate representation of a cavalry fort as seen during the American Civil War. Poised-and-ready rifles peer over the walls of the fort, ready for battle. Crossing a grand entry-bridge (also composed of logs), we pass above the waters of the Hub and towards the fort. A hand-carved sign reading \"Frontierland\" hangs from Fort Lincoln's opened-gates. Just a short distance away, the music of many a classic western film call to us, beckoning us to continue further. Our adventure back in time is about to begin...\n\nOur adventures in Frontierland begin in the sleepy mining town of\n\nThunder Mesa\n\nTruly, we feel as if we have stepped into the reels of a classic western as we take in the romanticized western-architecture. Horseshoe-prints and wagon wheel-tracks appear embedded in the pavement... Cacti and tumbleweeds create rugged gardens among the planters... A cigar store Indian stands guard from a nearby porch... Fellow guests relax from the heat of desert life atop rocking chairs and a hammock, taking in the shade of a quiet storefront... Wanted posters and advertisements for various frontier goods and services line the walls of the dust-kissed buildings, offering bits of humor here and there. This is truly a journey back in time...\n\nThe General Store, marked by its antler-covered rooftop (an old trick to attract cowboys), appears to our left, dabbling not just in souvenirs, but also in candy, soda, ice cream, and a rather odd oddity...exotic jerky. Next door, the Yensid Hotel and bathhouse labeled \"Baths 5 Cents\" serve as a clever disguise for the public bathrooms, a subtle nod to Disneyland's long-gone Bear Country. Other faux-storefronts appear, allowing us glimpses into typical western life. A peek inside the Assayer's Office shows a desk covered in gold nuggets, but a closer look at the abandoned assayer's chair shows a fresh supply of bullet-holes in the back of the chair, hinting at something gone awry in the past. The Sheriff's Office and Jailhouse next door do allow us to enter, giving us a chance to attempt to breakout of an \"authentic\" frontier prison or place our face within the frame of our own wanted poster.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the entry-path we find Westward Ho! Clothing Co., a western-inspired clothing store, neighbored by Ravenscroft Ltd. Undertaker who is offering a two-for-one sale at this time. Although the shop itself is inaccessible (it's really just faux storefront connecting Westward Ho to the next shop), an upright coffin outside allows us to test our final resting place before making a purchase. Suspiciously, the local Gallows (a bit dark, don't you think?) are located just a few feet from the Undertaker's shop... Next door to Ravenscroft is Prairie Supply. This is a rather unique store as it sells authentic western wares that one would not typically find in Australia, such as Native American-made blankets, figurines, and artwork.\n\nAs we continue forward into Frontierland, we catch our first glimpse of a Disneyland-staple: The Rivers of America. Marked by the majestic sternwheeler, the Mark Twain Riverboat, the Rivers of America represent the many great rivers of the North American continent: the Missouri, the Mississippi, the Rio Grande, etc., as they appeared in the time of American expansion. This oval-shaped river serves as the centerpiece of Frontierland, a beacon for the land's varying sub-areas. But, no beacon is complete without a \"weenie\", and we have ours in the form of Tom Sawyer Island.\n\nThe works of Mark Twain come to life on this island, not unlike an island where the likes of Tom Sawyer, Becky Thatcher and Huckleberry Finn might have played. Dusty dirt roads lined with sycamore and oak trees and creaky suspension bridges mark this natural haven. You may even stumble upon secret mined caves and uncover an age-old fort. Heading to the island via raft, we find a wealth of unique experiences\n\nHarper's Mill stands to the island's southern shore, a mysterious beacon of exploration and discovery. Marked by the large waterwheel to its side, the creaky wheels and cranks still turn inside this place, since long-abandoned. And Disney nerds, take good notice here: a nest of birds is lodged between the wedges of one of the wheels...not unlike a similar set of birds in the Academy-Award winning short The Old Mill. From Harper's Mill, we venture deeper into the forest, filled with unique blossoms and rushing streams. A rugged trail leads into a clearing of tall grass and giant boulders. Tall redwoods and pines mark the entrance to Injun Wood, where distant native drums and chanting set the scene. Of course, some displaced logs here and there provide ample \"playground equipment\" in this natural wonderland.\n\nCastle Rock is a large rock structure which features stationary telescopes, giving guests views of specific scenery and points of interest back on the Frontierland and Critter Country mainland.\n\nDeep in the cavernous depths of Tom Sawyer Island, we come upon the foreboding Injun Joe's Cave. Despite the warning signs, we enter this mysterious network of tunnels and caves, where the eerie sounds issuing from within echoes from wall to wall, accompanied by the eternal howl of an unseen wind. Lush waterfalls cascade into underground pools through jagged fissures in the rocks. Glistening crystals, stalagmites and stalactites reflect in the sheen of the rushing waters. Warning signs insist that we \"follow the river\" for our only hope of survival... An expansive labyrinth of subterranean paths are marked by strange fossils and jetting stalagmites. At the center of the labyrinth is a tower, built entirely from skulls. Once through an archway built from skulls and ribcages, a dark path takes us into an expansive, underground lake lined with glistening crystals and mysterious colors. The howl of a ghostly wind, rolling thunder and a frightening scream (perhaps one and the same with the Wicked Witch of Snow White) welcomes us to the Chamber of the Bottomless Pit, where, as expected, one could fall for an eternity...\n\nReturning to the warm glow of daylight, we find more things to do. Smuggler's Cove offers a network of interactive elements, as well as suspension bridge and pontoon bridges. In the dead center of the island is Tom and Huck's Treehouse, where guests can get dramatic views of the Rivers of America and of Disneyland Park.\n\nBack on the mainland, we find that Thunder Mesa splits into two directions at the riverbend, north and south (from our viewpoint, north is left, south is right). Deciding to turn left, we find the Golden Horseshoe Saloon, a rough-n-rowdy saloon of an era gone-by. Inside is a quick service restaurant where ice cream sundaes, fish and chips, fried chicken, and sasparillas are nearly all the menu has to offer. Also inside is the one and only Golden Horseshoe Revue where a collection of melodramatic vaudeville performers, from stand-up comedians to cancan-dancing showgirls put on a musical comedy show where anything can happen.\n\nThe Bluegrass Boys, an authentic bluegrass band often take to the streets of Buzzard Rock County, providing appropriate music for the time period. Sharing a kitchen with the Diamondback Rattlesnake Saloon is the Cowboy Cookout Barbecue, an outdoor table service restaurant selling all-you-can-eat barbecue dishes and Tex-Mex selections. Borrowing performers from the saloon, live musicians and a honky tonk pianist provide entertainment during each meal, a tradition dating back to Disneyland's own Big Thunder BBQ.\n\nJust outside the Diamondback Rattlesnake Saloon is an once-per-hour celebration of Frontierland: the Frontierland Hoedown. As if it were a flash-mob of the modern-era, a select group of Frontierland cast members and characters, including Brer Bear, Horace Horsecollar, Clarabelle Cow, Big Al, and Liver Lips McGrowl quietly sneak into the large \"dance-floor\" outside the saloon and randomly burst into a dance break. Following their flash mob, we are invited to participate, learning such steps as the electric slide, the box step, and so on so forth...\n\nOn the outskirts of this section of town is the mountain that gives Thunder Mesa its name: Big Thunder Mountain.\n\nNestled along the banks of the Rivers of America, a rock-built masterpiece seeming to be straight from Yosemite National Park once served as the booming gold mine in which the people of Thunder Mesa gained their fortune. Rumor has it that a flash-flood halted all business within the mine when a group of miners digging deep in the mountain were swept away...but mysteriously, the trains that transported those miners still kept going. Now, those brave enough to explore its reportedly \"haunted\" shafts and caverns board those trains, and set off for the miners' old stomping grounds, speeding past dinosaur fossils, bubbling desert pits, stalactite-filled caves and the long-lost spirits of those miners who lost their lives to the flash-flood so many years before. All this is the foundation for the \"wildest ride in the wilderness\" itself, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad! Nearby, a worn old train station serves as the second stop of the Disneyland Railroad, serving as the western quadrant of the train's four stops.\n\nTurning right at the river from the aforementioned split, Thunder Mesa continues south, starting with the legendary Mile Long Bar. In this snack-food-based eatery, the bar actually appears to be a mile-long, thanks to a cleverly-placed mirror at either end of the bar. The Mile Long Bar, of course is connected to the exit of a musical revue composed of pure fantasy, the Country Bear Jamboree.\n\nHeld within the historic Grizzly Hall, the Country Bear Jamboree is a down-home salute to country music. Hosted by Henry, a top hat and shirtfront-clad brown bear, we are taken through the various realms of the American frontier, experiencing a wide array of musical stylings performed by the likes of the Sun Bonnets, Wendell and Shaker, and of course, Big Al. The Bandwagon, a large Conestoga wagon set up outside the theater's entrance sells a small sampling of what can be found in Frontierland's bigger shops, including merchandise unique to the Country Bear Jamboree.\n\nAdjacent to Grizzly Hall's entrance is Big Al's Galley, a riverside establishment selling bread bowls, clam chowder, tomato bisque, lobster rolls, and the beloved Disney turkey leg (and pork shank). Big Al, perhaps the most memorable character in the Country Bear Jamboree can be heard snoring loudly from his cave which is coincidentally located along the muddy shoreline near the restaurant's riverside dining area. As evident by the various portraits and statues found around the galley, Big Al has an affinity for sailing and fishing, dramatic portraits showcasing a much skinnier and younger Al venturing out upon the high seas.\n\nWoody, Jessie, Bullseye, Big Al, Liver Lips McGrowl, Shaker and Wendell all make appearances in Thunder Mesa, entering from an alleyway between the Country Bear Jamboree and the neighboring structure. Although they mostly wander around at their own discretion to cause general mischief, a specified meet-n-greet space is found in the form of Lookout Dock, a small dock offering stunning views of adjacent Big Thunder Mountain, a perfect photo opportunity with your favorite frontier character.\n\nThe last portion of Thunder Mesa is found in the form of Davy Crockett's Wilderness Arcade. Found next door to the Country Bear Jamboree, Davy Crockett's Wilderness Arcade is a good old-fashioned shooting exposition themed to the king of the wild frontier himself, where interactive elements and triggers make one feel as if they \"tamed them a 'bar when they were only three.\"\n\nNow, let's head back over by Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. A bridge passes over some of the train tracks and along the banks of the Rivers of America, and towards the next sub-area of Frontierland...\n\nFolktale Forest\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nYes, this coming side of Frontierland will focus more on Western-based folklore and more on some of Disney's Western-inspired friends. As you can tell by the teaser picture, this is where Splash Mountain will be located. But what else will you find here? Ah, that is a question to be answered in the next post. See ya then!\n\nA lot of my ideas from the various dream resorts always seem to find a second home in Disneyland Maine. Realistic, considering they might exist in the same universe and Disney would carry over ideas lol.\n\nConsidering how many rides show up in the same resorts all over the world, I'd say there's plausibility behind that theory.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPassing along by Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, we find ourselves leaving the sweltering deserts of Thunder Mesa in favor of a cooler, shaded oasis: a shady forest of pine, fir, and redwood. Rustic cabins and crystal-clear streams bring us into a world reminiscent of the Pacific Northwest. The true beauty of nature comes out here as a lush waterfall thunders down into a gently flowing river (Which eventually enters the Rivers of the Frontier). Dwellings of all shapes and sizes appear, some embedded into trees, oversized mushrooms, and rocks, perhaps belonging to some kind of critter. Muddy hills caked with grass pop up throughout the area, leading up to a large mountain caked with a gnarled-up tree trunk. My friends, we have just stepped foot into...\n\nFolktale Forest\n\nFolktale Forest is a backwoods oasis where great frontier folk tales and legends come to life. Much like Critter Country at Disneyland, the first point of interest in the second formation in Frontierland's mountain range. It's a large mountain scraping the great Northern skies. A thundering waterfall pours down from inside a large gnarled-up tree trunk at its peak. Every few seconds a log pours down the falls seemingly filled with...people? Screaming people. What is this, some kind of thrill ride? Well...yes. Yes, it is. This is Splash Mountain, the world's biggest log ride featuring the biggest, wettest drop in the entire resort.\n\nInspired by Disney's 1946 live-action (and highly-controversial) film Song of the South, Splash Mountain takes place on and inside Chickapin Hill, the muddy home of the villainous Brer Fox and his bumbling assistant Brer Bear. The two rogues are constantly on a hunt for Brer Rabbit, a crafty little rabbit always in search of something better. Currently, Brer Rabbit is planning to leave his humble home in the Briar Patch to spend the rest of his days at the Laughin' Place. But what happens when Brer Fox and Brer Bear kidnap him before he gets there? Well, what happens is the wettest and wildest ride in Disney park history, all culminating in a 50-foot drop down Chickapin Hill!\n\nA few feet away, along the banks of the Rivers of America is an old explorer's launch. This launch is the home of the Mike Fink Keel Boats, a long-lost relic of nearly every major Disneyland-style park makes its triumphant return at DLA, this time launching from a dock just a few feet away from the canoe launch. Boarding either the Gullywhumper or the Bertha Mae, passengers are taken on a grand circle tour of the Rivers of the Far West, treated to an audio tour provided by King of the River himself, Mike Fink. The Davy Crockett Explorer Canoes launch from a nearby landing, allowing man-powered journeys around and about the Rivers of the Far West, narrated by a wise-cracking guide on either end of the hand-carved and hand-painted canoe.\n\nAt the farthest edge of the forest is Hungry Bear Lodge, a dimly-lit restaurant themed to some hunting lodge or forest rangers' lodge in the woods. The Hungry Bear is home to some of the best comfort food (i.e. fried chicken and greens) this side of the Mississippi River. Much like its Disneyland counterpart, there's a patio right on the banks of the River; providing excellent views of Tom Sawyer Island and a good spot for people-watching, as the various watercraft glide past. You may even catch a glimpse of the Disneyland Railroad as it passes the Hungry Bear and heads for Columbia Gorge at the northern-most tip of the Rivers of America.\n\nThe Disneyland Railroad separates the two halves of Folktale Forest. Heading underneath the railroad tracks, we find the old barn entrance to Splash Mountain on our left; but on our right are a few small shops. First, we find Paul Bunyan's, a clothing store selling mainly flannels and plaid clothing. Various tributes to the giant lumberjack Paul Bunyan and his big blue ox Babe adorn the store. The Apple Tree is an odd store with a large apple tree growing in the middle of it. A stationary sculpture of Johnny Appleseed himself (Accompanied by some forest friends) picks apples from the tree. The Apple Tree specializes in mainly candy and other sweet treats, including their famous caramel apples.\n\nIn the center of Folktale Forest's back-half is Nature's Wonderland, a beautifully-kept garden where nature rules over all. If you want to meet more characters, you're in luck. The likes of Brer Rabbit, Brer Fox, Brer Bear, Kenai, Koda, Pocahontas, John Smith and Meeko all can be seen roaming through Nature's Wonderland, eager to greet guests. In the center of Nature's Wonderland is the Nature Tree, a towering tree whose long limbs and ample green leaves provide shade.\n\nIn an alcove to the right of Nature's Wonderland is Grandmother Willow's Grove, a playground for little kids. Young explorers can enjoy running, climbing and jumping around the encampment of swings, bridges and slides suspended between the open wooden supports of tepees. Details recall the forest friends of Pocahontas, whilst parents and older visitors can enjoy a peaceful place to sit by the river, watching the logs of Splash Mountain rush by and the riverboats slowly ply their course through the luscious green trees.\n\nNearby is the Gathering Place, an outdoor entertainment arena where throughout the day, different events take place. First is the Dance Circle, where authentic Native American dancers in the appropriate garbs perform dances that have been passed down for centuries among their people, as seen in this incredible video.\n\nAlternating with the Dance Circle is the Brother Bear Totem Ceremony. Here, an apprentice to the Shaman, with the aid of Kenai, Koda, Rutt and Tuke, tries to invoke the Great Spirits to reveal a totem hidden inside a log. It's the same kind of show that used to be performed at Redwood Creek Challenge Trail at Disney California Adventure.\n\nAt the northern-most edge of Folktale Forest, we head down a forest trail past thundering waterfalls and crystal-clear streams. Rock formations in the shape of eagles, owls, and other \"forest spirits\" lay hidden among the falls, suggesting that perhaps magic lays deep within the earth. Totem poles appear on either side of the trail, the distant howl of a wolf setting an eerie tone. Down the trail, the drumming and chanting of the Native American people seems to grow louder and louder, until we finally find ourselves in front of a world seemingly untouched by modern man. Marked by a great rock formation, covered in grass, wildflowers and waterfalls, weaved boats stand ready to takes us down The Rivers of Nature. On this incredible journey, set to Native American tribal music, we sail through the forests and deserts of North America, coming across many friendly animal faces. But be warned--man is not so friendly, and nearly threatens to destroy the forest! Fortunately, all ends well, and the journey concludes with a trek through the Heart of the Forest, where man, animal, and nature all gather in perfect harmony. (This is the concept I thought up for the SYWTBAI Festival of Imagination earlier this year. I knew I had to put it here somewhere!)\n\nReturning back to the outskirts of Folktale Forest, we notice something across the river. Deciding to investigate, we rush back across Thunder Mesa and head to the right-hand side of the fork in the town. The breathtaking western film orchestrations give way to jazz standards typical of New Orleans...in fact, even the rustic Southwestern structures appear to be giving way to more Southern-style buildings...could it...could it be? Yes, it could! We've just stumbled upon the Golden Age of New Orleans, Louisiana. Winding alleyways and bustling restaurants beckon us towards Frontierland's third and final sub-area...\n\nThe French Quarter\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWhat did y'all think of our sojourn through Folktale Forest? Well, until next time, better brush up your jazz steps and start cooking the beignets, because it's off to the French Quarter we go! Until then, so long!"
