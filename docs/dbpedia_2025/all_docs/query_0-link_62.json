        "text": "Post by codystarbuck on\n\nSo, in my Original Gangstas thread (featuring Guardians of the Galaxy, I promised a new thread with a bit more variety, as I had grown bored with the formula of the Guardians series, from the early 90s. I had been thinking about this for a while and decided to pull the trigger. This is about the Marvel showcase anthologies, designed the present try-outs for potential series or as a vehicle for inventory or uncompleted stories. I intend to focus on the three main ones: Marvel premiere, Marvel Spotlight and Marvel Fanfare. I've already covered the Defenders and Thing & Captain Marvel issues of Marvel Feature; but, I may also through in the in between Ant-Man stories and the other Thing team-up stories. I have gone back in forth about going sequentially in each series, switching to the next one when I'm at the end of one series, or going back and forth, like my 4th World thread. i think I will probably go that route, since it lets me have more variety, as Marvel premiere starts out as a Warlock vehicle and Marvel Spotlight has long stretches where it was Ghost Rider and Son of Satan, before settling done into revolving features.\n\nSo get ready for the characters without homes, the abandoned storylines that got finished, and the shot at the majors by some very minor characters. Just like Rudolph, it's a home for the misfits.\n\nps Maybe, down the road, I'll look at Marvel Super Heroes, Marvel Presents (comic and magazine) and Marvel Super Special.\n\nPost by codystarbuck on\n\nMarvel Premiere #1\n\nCreative Team: Roy Thomas-story, Gil Kane-pencils, Dan Adkins-inks, Sam Rosen-letters, colors-unknown, Stan is not credited as editor; but, he is noted on the editorial notes, during the flashbacks.\n\nSynopsis: An asteroid is floating near Earth orbit; an asteroid, with a satellite dish. Inside is the High Evolutionary (sounds like an Underground Comix character), who is busy musing about the past (probably with some herbal help) and we get a recap of Thor #134-135, where HE met Thor, after creating his New-Men and the Man-Beast, which led a rebellion. Next, he moves into Tales to Astonish #94-96, as HE had scooped up the Hulk, to help him beat his newly rebellious New Men, and when HE evolved into a higher form and buggered off to be One With The Cosmos. Now he's back and looking to try again, when Sir Raam, his only loyal creation, tells him that they have a visitor. A cocoon is floating nearby and they haul it in and it makes contact and HE meets Him. Him tells HE his story, about the FF and fighting Thor...\n\nwhich he lost and he sealed himself back in his cocoon, leading HE to find Him. HE tells Him about HIS plan to create a new Earth, from a lump of the old. So, in the beginning, there was nothing (except a ball of mud) and HE said let there be light (or energy) and the light was okay. Soon, the ball had gravity that sucked in asteroids and other debris and a world was formed, a moon was spewn up, seas and land formed and life forms evolved rapidly...\n\nAnd on the 7th score hour, HE rested. Then, Man-Beast turned up, murdered Sir Raam, and corrupted the new humans, creating murder. He then further corrupts the rapidly changing world, creating wars, crusades, Hitlers and such, until he is attacked by HE. The Man-Beast's followers counter-attack and the fight is on. Man-Beast has mental powers and they are pretty strong. Finally, Him sees all he can stands until he can stands no more. he gulps his spinach, bursts out of the cocoon, and quicker than you can say \"Shazam!\" he opens a can of whoop-ass on the New Men.\n\nHim chases off the Man-Beast and HE decides he is going to scrap His experiment, when Him stops HE and pleads the case of the humans, saying there is good there and offers to help nurture it. HE zaps Him with energy and sends his only begotten son (begotten out of a cocoon floating in space) to Counter Earth, so that they might know their creator and find salvation. He slaps a green gem on His forehead and sends Him to Counter Earth, where \"Men shall call you Warlock!\" for some reason, or another (why Warlock? Why not Joshua, or some variation of that?) We end with humans witnessing something crashing in the desert.\n\nThoughts: This story seems awfully familiar........\n\nRoy spends the first half with the High Evolutionary monologuing, does a lot of recap, then unleashes Genesis (the older one, not the band) and weget his little Biblical allegory. I take it Roy had been to see Jesus Christ, Superstar once or twice (maybe Godspell). All that is missing is the soundtrack.\n\nWith Gil Kane on art, it, of course, looks fantastic. When Warlock is reborn, we are given shades of Captain Marvel, while Kane also added touches of Bill Everett's Amazing Man, who was one of Kane's favorite early comic characters. I do notice that in a crucifixion scene, rather than crosses, we see men nailed to Ts. Wonder if Stan felt crosses were taboo or if Gil was just trying to be different, since this is a different world. Our Cain and Abel are shown to be primitive man; so, it seems that Roy is mixing the Biblical story with scientific discoveries. We also see dinosaurs and trilobites.\n\nIt's all very allegorical and suitably hippy. Kind of ironic, though, that a Jesus allegory is being drawn by a Jewish artist.\n\nPretty good first issue for Marvel Premiere and the launch of Warlock. Having Gil Kane helps tremendously, as Roy gets kind of flowery and long-winded in the story.\n\nPost by codystarbuck on\n\nMarvel Spotlight #1\n\nCover by Neal Adams.\n\nCreative Team: Gardner Fox-writer, Syd Shores-pencils, Wally Wood-inks, Jean Izzo-letters, Marie Severin-colors, Stan Lee-editor.\n\nSynopsis: We open with red Wolf riding desperately for fort Rango, with the sacred white buffalo hide, which he took from those who stole it. he has to reach the fort in time to stop a war. A group of indians spots him and shoot his horse, . He gets up and kicks their collective butts. then white men, who originally stole the hide, show up and start shooting. Red Wolf is backed to the edge of a cliff, which forces him into flashbacks of the Pony Soldiers (cavalry) attacking his village, killing his father and mother and wounding him. A less bloodthirsty soldier stops another from killing him and turns the wounded boy over to the Wakely's, pioneers headed for new territories. The adopt him and raise him in the world of the white man; but, he retains memories of his past life and practices his indian skill. One day, he returns to find his family's farm burned and his adopted parents dead, killed by renegade indians. he rebuilds; but, a greedy land baron wants the farm. They burn him out and he goes off and becomes a scout, for the Pony Soldiers. He is not treated like a white man (well, duh!) and gets his but kicked by a sergeant, when a red haired white woman enters and says that the Cheyenne are on the warpath and someone has stolen the sacred white buffalo hide. Seeing a chance to prove himself, Red Wolf goes after it. He finds the Cheyenne andhears their plans. he is about to go off to warn the fort when his horse is shot, dumping him to the ground. He crawls into a cave, which just happens to be the tomb for an old warrior of legend, where he finds a wounded red wolf. He has a vision and goes and proves himself to the Cheyenne, while wearing a wolf headpiece. he then tracks the thieves and we are back to where we came in. the wolf attacks the white men as Red Wolf nears the cliff edge and it gives him the distraction to fight back. he defeats the white men and takes them prisoner, bringing them to the fort, with the buffalo hide.\n\nThoughts: Fairly cliched story, but well told. The plot is cobbled together from dozens of westerns, though Gardner Fox knows what he is doing. It's filled with western tropes, like the red man, raised by whites and taught the ways of \"civilization;\" thus, elevating the savage. His indian skills allow him to do things that the white soldiers can't. He, of course, sides with the whites, when conflict comes, thought the natives are stirred by white agitators, looking for gold.\n\nIt's not likely to win awards or praise from Native Americans; but, it's a serviceable twist on the average western.\n\nSyd Shores' art is fine and most artists of this era seemed to enjoy doing westerns, especially veteran artists of the Golden Age.\n\nFox was forced out of DC in the writers purge, when a group got together to try and force DC into the modern world, with better pay and health benefits. True to form, they fired the lot. Some of those involved ended up working for Marvel, who also did not offer health benefits; but, at least they would give them work. Fox turned to writing novels, before picking up a bit of work for Marvel. I don't know if Roy Thomas was a factor in getting Stan to hire him or not, though I'm sure Stan was familiar with Fox's work, having handled some of the most high profile comics of the Golden and Silver Ages. Syd was an old hand at Marvel, going back to work on Captain America, after Simon & Kirby. Wally Wood and Marie Severin bring the EC connection. Nice mix of comics history in this issue, even if it isn't a masterpiece.\n\nPost by Rob Allen on\n\nThat first Warlock story had a huge impact on me. I thought it was one of the best things ever published. When I was growing up, my family would attend a Methodist church on an irregular basis, so I recognized the Biblical parallels. But in the year or so before this issue came out, my parents had become \"born again\" charismatic/evangelical Christians. To their credit, they didn't force me or my brother to join them, they just encouraged us to try it. Neither of us did, and my parents left the evangelical movement after about half-a-dozen years. But this issue came when they were heavily into it.\n\nI've told this story before here: My father got a job with an evangelical publisher in our home town, and they put out some comic books, trying to compete with Spire Christian Comics. I got a look at their first two comics, fresh from the printer, and thought they looked like crap. I've seen them again in more recent years and they don't look as bad now. The artist was Tony Tallarico. I decided to give my father some recent comics that had what I thought of as good art, so he could take them to the office and show people what good comics looked like. I LOVED the art in this issue, but I knew that if anyone there read the story, they'd go ballistic. So I didn't give him this one, and I didn't give him Son of Satan, but I did give him the Dr. Strange issue by Frank Brunner that I liked so much. They went ballistic over the Master of the Mystic Arts, which to them meant Satan.\n\nOn another note, it's interesting that Roy and Gil did this overhaul of an older character a few years after the pair did a similar overhaul on another older character, Captain Marvel. And a few years later, both characters would be changed again by Jim Starlin. Marvel's cosmic comics owe a lot to Roy Thomas and Gil Kane.\n\nPost by codystarbuck on\n\nThat first Warlock story had a huge impact on me. I thought it was one of the best things ever published.

And a few years later, both characters would be changed again by Jim Starlin. Marvel's cosmic comics owe a lot to Roy Thomas and Gil Kane.\n\nI think a lot has to do with Roy and Gil being on the same page and having similar tastes in literature (or, at least, overlapping tastes). They did a bang up job on the Ring of the Nibelungs, though P Craig Russell's is still more gorgeous (he just excelled on his opera stuff). Roy and Gil are great at mythic, which fits the cosmic stories well. I would have rather seen them tackle the 4th World than Conway and his collaborators (as much as I love Marshall Rogers and Don Newton on their art).\n\nPost by codystarbuck on\n\nI covered Marvel Feature #1-3 in my Defenders thread, and issue 12 in my Thanos thread. So, we will pick up with Ant-Man.\n\nMarvel Feature #4\n\nSeriously, that is one dangerous location. You have matches and a smouldering cigarette but around paint and nails lying around, waiting for someone to step on them (if only aided by shrunken superheroes).\n\nCreative Team: Mike Friedrich-writer, Herb Trimpe-artist, John Costanza-letters, colors just magically appeared (no credit given), Stan-editor, Roy-intro.\n\nSynopsis: See, this is what happens if you don't clean up food spills.....you get Ants......and Ant-Men!\n\nRoy gives us a rundown of Hank Pym's past, from testing shrinking formulas and tours of ant hills, to red and blue longjohns to ride ants, to Giant men, to Yellowjacket breakdowns, to current semi-retired lab work. Petey Parker is visiting and assisting in the lab, when Hank unveils his limbo formula...\n\nThey survive and clean up the lab, with the help of Hank's dog, Orkie, a gift from Jan. A knock at the door reveals a mobster, who has kidnapped the son of Curt Connors (aka The Lizard), and wants the\"American Indian Drugs,\" upon which Hank and Petey are experimenting. (Riiiiiight.....experimenting!) Hank gets physical, the mobster says the kid dies if he isn't left alone and a meeting is arranged. Petey doesn't want Hank to tell Connors, or the stress might turn him into the Lizard, though he can't tell Hank that. They tell his wife and then concoct a plan to free the kid. Hank grabs his duds, while Petey acts as a courier. Hank travels via dog, instead of ant (might have to change his name to the Human Flea).\n\nPetey meets the mobsters, gives them guff, when Ant-Man swings into action, smacking a mobster in the head, ala David and the non-Hank Pym Goliath. They scuffle, then we see the Connors boy, who has been injected with bacteria. Petey and Hank surrender and go with the hoods. Turns out, they have the standard, hidden inside a mountain hideaway and, somehow, off panel, the Connors boy gets away from his babysitter and swipes a car. Ant-Man shrinks, finds Orkie and they go off in search of the boy, while Petey concocts a ridiculous plan to be the new hostage, which the hoods agree to. hank finds the kid at a construction site, shivering in a pit, from the bacteria. Hank tries to enlarge; but, the bacteria they injected in him prevents it and he is stuck at ant size. He gets Orkie to lower a rope and then ties it around the kid; then Rin-Tn-Tin....er... Orkie, pulls the kid out. They then head back to rescue Petey and find the antidote, with Hank steering and orkie working the pedals....\n\nPetey gets loose and Spider-Man appears on the scene. he wraps up the crooks, except the leader, who hot-foots it. Hank shows up in time to jab a nail in the guy's foot. He unties Petey (who snuch back into his bonds and then they give the kid his medicine. Hank hides the fact that he has taken the antidote; but, is still stuck at ant size. There is some whining and vowing, then the story ends.\n\nThoughts: Hooray for Orkie!\n\nHank gets a canine sidekick, who then disappears completely, like Tiger Brady. It's silly; but, it is the one element of this that is actually pretty fun. Parker is mostly in civies, until the end and Hank is unaware that he is Spider-Man. there are some convenient elements to the story, like the kid escaping, without us ever seeing it. Sounds like someone forgot to tell herb about that plot point.\n\nHerb Trimpe's art seems a little stiff and some of the faces are a bit odd. He's doing a sort of Kirby pastiche, in parts; but, it comes off oddly, elsewhere. Some of the bodies are a bit cartoony, especially the crooks. Herb was usually a stronger artist than we see here, though he does a good job with perspective on the size changing.\n\nI suspect the dg sidekick came from Roy, as that was a feature of Quality Comics' Doll Man, the original shrinking hero. Doll Man had Elmo, the Wonder Dog, as a canine helper and Roy would be quite familiar with that. Alas, poor Orkie, we knew him, Irving Forbush! One shot was all he got. I do have to wonder how the dog, who doesn't appear that large, is able to haul the kid out of a pit. The lid looks to be somewhere around 8-10, and should be getting on the heavier side. Orkie's size is a bit hard to gage, based on the shots of him in panels; but, he doesn't look quite German Shepherd or Great Dane size (like Elmo, the Wonder Dog). It's a comic, though.\n\nIf you ask me, Roy and the gang missed the boat by featuring Ant-Man, instead of Orkie, Dog Wonder!\n\nHank is stuck at his wee size, which had already been done, after a fashion, when he was stuck at giant size, as Goliath. I suppose Roy wanted to exercise his inner Richard Matheson. Unfortunately, Roy was busy, so he turned things over to Mike friedrich. Mike wasn't a bad writer; but, he was a better publisher and artist rep. He's not quite clicking, here.\n\nKind of a goofy first issue; but, goofy isn't necessarily a bad way to start a new series.\n\nPost by codystarbuck on\n\nMarvel Premiere #2\n\nCreative Team: Roy Thomas-writer, Gil Kane & Dan Adkins-art, Herb Cooper-letters, Stan Lee-RIP\n\nSynopsis: Warlock has landed on Counter-Earth. he has been found by a group of teens, who seem to be runaways. They help him to a barn, where he passes out again, reawakening later. intros are made, with David, Jason, and twins Eddie and Ellie. He remembers the name Warlock and that becomes his surname and Ellie gives him the name Adam. The teens are argumentative, though Warlock is drawn to the barn cat (called Gray Mouser). Meanwhile, the High Evolutionary watches from above and wonders what went wrong with Warlock's memory.\n\nWe get a long recap, then see the Man-Beast call for an assassin and assign Rhodan, a rat creature, to do the job. On C-E, a gumshoe, named Marlowe, takes an Air Force officer, senator, an entrepreneur on a trip to find their missing kids, leading them to the teens and Warlock. The reunion is tense, as the kids have run away from their parents greed and involvement in the military and war. Finally, the senator has enough and is about to sick the shamus on Warlock, when Rhodan shows up and it gets even weirder. Warlock is atacked by one of the hounds and kills it, then remembers who he is and why he is there. He floats into the air and turns the other hound into light, then catches up to Rhodan, who floated to the ground and ran into the barn. Warlock goes in, there is a scream, and only he comes out. he then hits the three adults with images of what there work has done to the world, with death and destruction. The men leave, their world shattered, and leave their children with Warlock. The scream turns out to have been Rhodan, transformed back into a simple rat, who was then killed by \"Gray Mouser,\" who is seen with the carcass.\n\nThoughts: Damn, dirty hippies! This kind of comes across like a superhero version of an episode of Room 222, an early 1970s tv show, with an idealistic black teacher and a group of high school students (To Sir, With Love, minus Lulu and with Karen Valentine added). It tended to idealistic kids wanting to change the world and dealing with or running away from social issues. Lots of dirty hippie, too, though James L Brooks was more sympathetic than Jack Webb). The kids are running from their military-industrial complex parents and though Roy does try to put some reason into the mouths of the parents, the truth is they are complicit with murder and destruction, on a societal scale. Idealistic kids good, parents bad. Military are just uniformed killers. It's a reflection of the time and the perceived audience. It ain't subtle; but, then, Marvel didn't build a name on subtlety.\n\nKane and Adkins continue to rock the art and Roy is young and hungry and his writing is a cut above much of the industry, even if it has the naivete of youth, even if there are large doses of truth within.\n\nthe cat, \"Gray Mouser,\" is an homage to the Fritz Leiber character, who was a slightly built man, dressed in grey, with a rapier and a dagger as his weapons. he was an apprentice sorcerer who quit the magic biz to be a thief and rogue, eventually running into and teaming with northern barbarian (who is rather cultured) Fafhrd, who ran away from his tribal position, to choose his own destiny. None of that has any bearing on the story; Roy is just being cute. Rhodan is possibly a reference to the Perry Rhodan sci-fi stories, since the sculptor is Rodin, and the Toho monster is Rodan. Perry Rhodan is the star of a German series of pulp novels, by KH Scheer and Walter Ernsting, which debuted in 1961. It was published as a weekly series, intending to last around 50 issues; but nearly 3000 have appeared to date. Ace Books began translating them, in 1968 and got through the first 126 issues, before cancelling the series. Forry Ackerman helped initiate the American editions and his wife was the chief translator. US reaction was that the series was too juvenile, as there was little characterization and cheesy dialogue, though engaging plots. The publisher cancelled the series, before it got to the more sophisticated stories, as the German series had evolved. The hero is a major of the US Space Force (wonder where Trump got the idea...), who leads the first moon mission, where they find a derelict alien craft. The technology allows the advancement of Earth and the unification of its people and their travels through the stars, where Rhodan encounters various groups. They are pure space opera and Roy Thomas was a fan. The Alburquerque sci-fi convention, Bubonicon, adopted as its mascot Perry Rhodent, a rat with one shoe. Npt sure; but, I am willing to betthe Hounds of Helios is a reference, if oblique, to a storyline in Perry Rhodan.\n\nFrom here, Warlock moves into his own series, where he will battle the forces of the Man-Beast. It's all very allegorical and would end when the plug was pulled, then concluded in the Hulk. Jim Starlin picked up the character and started his saga, with the Magus and the Universal Church of Truth, and Thanso, as covered in my Thanos thread. Starlin's work tends to overshadow Roy Thomas'. frome here, Marvel Premiere becomes a temporary home to Dr Strange, then launches Iron Fist. So you can blame this book for the Netflix series.\n\nPost by codystarbuck on\n\nMarvel Spotlight #2\n\nWerewolf By Night (insurance agent by day....)\n\nCreative Team: Gerry Conway-writer, Mike Ploog-artist, John Costanza-letterer, plot by Roy and Jeanne Thomas, edited by Stan \"The Wolfman\" Lee\n\nSynopsis: Lon Chaney is walking home.......\n\ner...........a lone figure walks the streets of Los Angeles, when a mugger with a knife wishes he had gone to the movies, instead....\n\nA cop shows up and the wolfman legs it, running down some very Eisner-esque streets. He escapes and thena young man wakes up from a dream. Except, his arm is wounded where the cop's bullet grazed the arm of the wolfman. He gets dressed and sees his mother being berated by the chauffeur. He and his sis wonder why their mother allows it, and why their step father does, as well. Something is up, there. The young man's name is Jack Russell, He goes out for a drive, to think, then returns for his birthday party. However, he is overcome by pain and runs outside, where he transforms. he runs up the coast and comes to a dilapidated house, where he is attacked by a wolf. he kills it, then sees his reflection in the water and passes out.\n\nJack's step father finds him on the beach and brings him inside and tells him that his mother nearly died in a car accident, when her brakes gave out. Earlier, we say Grant, the chauffeur, working on the car. Jack overhears his father on the phone, talking to Grant and saying something about bringing money. Jack goes to the hospital to see his mom but she can't have visitors. So, he sneaks in. Jack's mother tells him of his father, a baron, of a Baltic state, who she met as a student. they fell in love, married and had Jack and his sister. the Baron would disappear for three nights a monthand it turns out he was a werewolf and his genes were passed on to Jack. the Baron was killed by villagers, hunting the killer wolfman. Laura returned home and married Jack's stepfather. Now, he has inherited the curse. laura dies and Jack transforms, after swearing not to raise a hand to his stepfather, just before his mother expired. He hunts for Grant, remembering him tinkering with the car. he finds him at the appointed meeting place and they battle, with Jack ultimately, though not easily, killing him. he then sees his father, who had come to pay off gant, now that he was a rich man. jack wants to kill his step father, but promised his dying mother and is torn up by that promise.\n\nThoughts: it's a bit rushed in execution; but, filled with great atmosphere and modernizes the old legend and universal film. Conway's dialogue is a bit weak; but, Ploog is in his element, with shadows and creepy environments and monsters. Mike Ploog had served 10 years in the Marines, leaving in 1968. he then went to work for Filmation and then Hanna-Barbera, doing clean-ups and layout work. A colleague passed him a flyer for an assistant to Will Eisner, on PS Magazine. Ploog contacted him, showed him his work and got the job. the magazine covered preventative maintenance topics for the military, using cartoons to show the procedures. One of the most famous one dealt with maintenance for the M-16 rifle, which a generation of Vietnam vets had seen. Ploog worked there 2 years, before breaking in with Warren. A western sample got him the job at Marvel, where this was his first story.\n\nYou can see the Eisner influence in his work, as he swipes some of Central City's architecture and the faces are very Eisner-esque. He uses shadows like his mentor; but his strength is in the atmosphere, more than character. As such, he was perfect for Marvel's growing line of horror books. Ploog would go on to work on Ghost Rider and Man-Thing, as well as the B-17 sequence, in the Heavy Metal animated movie.. he left Marvel after a dispute over work-for-hire contracts, while working on a Weirdworld script. he returned to working in Hollywood, though occasionally popped up in comics in the 90s and 00s.\n\nWerewolf by Night runs for 3 issues here, before graduating to his own title. We'll see what happens with Jack Russell next time.\n\nps The name is Jack Russell, for a wolfman, just conjures up a little, hyperactive werewolf, who's always jumping around. Kind of a were-terrier."
