        "text": "Here's something I wrote that was published recently in the Global Media Journal. I hope it can be of help and is of interest to anyone (especially #journalists and #humanrights researchers)dealing with potentially #disturbingdigitalcontent (e.g., gruesome images, videos) and support in protecting their #mentalwellbeing. It is furthermore intended to shed a light on the topic generally, point out existing research in the field (and respective research gaps) and raise awareness. After all, a lot is at stake - namely the #mentalhealth of individuals working on the 'digital frontline'! Other topical keywords #journalism #gruesomeimagery #disturbingdigitalcontent #eyewitnessmedia #UGC #trauma #PTSD Access to the paper is free!\n\nThis is the best journalism, along with the NY SUN, in that business today. There is no spin, propaganda, or lies. Real game-changing research is the facts. Look where it has led: to a historic injunction against censoring First Amendment free speech by this current administration, never before envisioned but warned of by our founders. Free speech was first on the Bill of Rights; it is more powerful than any man-made weapon.\n\nJournalists report what happens in the world. That‚Äôs what we call the ‚Äònews‚Äô. While news outlets make their own editorial decisions on what to cover and how, big stories like wars and disasters are reported by almost everyone. Over the past few years, the content we had to put out there has drastically gone violent. What we now describe ‚Äòdistressing visuals‚Äô, would have made anyone in any newsroom speechless even six months ago. The normalisation of exposure to onscreen violence has reached such levels that even journalists, who are trained to deal with consuming graphic images, struggle. So much so that secondary trauma cases among journalists have become very common. This is not an, ‚Äòoh, woe is me‚Äô sort of a post. I have recently come across a quote by the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung which goes; ‚ÄòA political situation is the manifestation of a parallel psychological problem in millions of individuals. This problem is largely unconscious (which makes it a particularly dangerous one!)‚Äô *Carl Gustav Jung, Letters, Vol 1: 1906-1950 Which made me think‚Ä¶ If the biggest stories we cover on news get less and less human, and more and more difficult to digest, does that mean we have an even bigger story to report: the collective death of empathy and compassion?\n\nWe are celebrating World Press Freedom Day 2024 by appreciating the freedom of the press and acknowledging journalism's evolution over the years. From üìù handwritten newsletters to ü§≥social media, the press has been adapting to meet the challenges of our times. Technological advancements such as the printing press, telegraph, radio, and TV have revolutionized the way news is spread. The internet has empowered citizen journalists and giving voice to marginalized communities. Despite all the advancements, the press still faces challenges such as fake news, censorship, and attacks on press freedom. However, the press has continued to adapt and innovate, using AI and data journalism to uncover the stories that matter. Collaborative journalism and cross-border investigations foster greater transparency and accountability in the media industry. #worldpressfreendomday2024 #himalayanmonal #healthylife #healthylifestyle #healthyliving #himalayas #himalayansalt #healthysnacks #HealthyHair #healthysnacking #himalayan #himalayanmonal #snacks #snacktime"
