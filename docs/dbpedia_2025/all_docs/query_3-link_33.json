Sallah is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s deputy managing editor who has led the newspaper’s investigations team since late 2020, overseeing stories that have uncovered sweeping failures in Pittsburgh’s housing program, money laundering in the U.S. steel industry and regulatory breakdowns at big banks that allowed criminal networks to move billions through the institutions. His work in accountability reporting has led to criminal investigations, legislative reforms and the recovery of hundreds of thousands in taxpayer dollars. He has previously worked on investigations teams at the Washington Post, Miami Herald, USA Today, and Toledo Blade."
