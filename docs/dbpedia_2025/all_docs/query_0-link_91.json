        "text": "Previous Part | Masterlist | Next Part\n\nPairing: Indiana Jones x Reader\n\nRating: M but will likely have explicit bonus chapters\n\nNotes: Welcome back to the latest garbage fire!\n\nAlso the face cast for Michael Harris is Nicholas Hoult. Hope y'all are well 💙\n\nAlso also Horemheb is a real pharoah but Horemheb II is a fictional figure for this fic.\n\nWarnings: Cursing; period-typical sexism; period-typical expectations of women; ~tension~\n\nSummary: It’s bright as all get-out, and incredibly hot. It’s not the heat you’re familiar with in Connecticut—it’s not a soupy heat with thick, watery, hair-frizzing air. This is a dry heat; it sticks in your throat and burns your nostrils a touch as you follow the others to the car.\n\n“You’re still looking at that old thing?”\n\n“What do you mean still looking?”\n\n“You were staring at it during the last flight.”\n\n“Don’t you have anything better to do than to spy on me, Dr. Jones?”\n\nIndiana grunts, adjusting his hat on his head as you primly focus on the map in front of you.\n\n“You’re gonna know every inch of the goddamn Valley’a the Kings by the time we get there,” He mutters.\n\n“Then I’ll know exactly where not to look for Horemheb.”\n\n“Horemheb the second.”\n\n“Oh, well excuse me,” You tease, glancing at Indiana out of the corner of your eye. Jones grunts, shifting in his seat. He leans closer, seeming to peer out of the window beside you before he comments, “If I knew you’d spend the entire flight looking at the map, I would’ve taken the window seat.”\n\n“That’s not fair,” You frown a little, lowering the map into your lap. “I’ve never sat in a window seat before.”\n\n“Not even the last time you went to Egypt?”\n\n“We sailed.”\n\n“Oh?”\n\n“Yeah, my mother was certain that if we got on a plane, we’d be struck by lightning and knocked out of the sky.”\n\n“Ah.”\n\n“Mhm.”\n\nYou’re fighting the urge to look down at the map again in favor of staring out of the window—but what is there to look at but clouds?\n\n“…Go on,” Jones urges.\n\n“Hm?”\n\n“I’ll get out of your hair about the map,” Indiana sighs heavily. You look over to see him taking his hat off and setting it down over his eyes.\n\n“We can trade seats—” You start to offer, but Jones just grunts again, sliding down in his seat a little. You turn away from him, peering down at the map again. After a few minutes, you find that you can’t focus on it at all. You huff softly, folding the map and setting it in your lap before crossing your arms. You peer out of the window for a moment before tipping your head back against the seat, gazing upward. You arrived at Athens around eleven at night, and had loaded onto the plane for Luxor around midnight. You’re exhausted—but you’ll look at your map, and you won’t fall asleep.\n\n–\n\n“Hey.”\n\n“Mmm,” You grumble.\n\n“Kid.”\n\n“Stop talking.” You turn your face and nuzzling against a slightly scratchy surface.\n\n“…The plane’s landed and I don’t think I’m allowed to leave you here.”\n\nIt takes you a moment, but you pry your eyes open and find yourself cuddled up against Dr. Jones, your head on his shoulder. You sit up hurriedly, scrubbing a hand over your rapidly-heating face and muttering, “I’m sorry.”\n\n“…Get your hat,” Dr. Jones says as he stands, straightening his jacket. And before you can get too far—“Don’t forget your map.”\n\nIt sends you scrambling back into the aisle to pluck it up from the floor.\n\n–\n\n“Jeez,” You mutter, looking around as you fan your face with the map. It’s bright as all get-out, and incredibly hot. It’s not the heat you’re familiar with in Connecticut—it’s not a soupy heat with thick, watery, hair-frizzing air. This is a dry heat; it sticks in your throat and burns your nostrils a touch as you follow the others to the car. You duck inside, glad to be out of the sun, though the car is just as hot—and now that you’re packed in beside Dr. Jones and Dr. Brody in their suit jackets, it’s almost worse.\n\n“I do hope you adjust to the weather quickly,” Brody comments as the driver starts away from the airfield. “I’m afraid it won’t grow any cooler.”\n\n“And you can’t always to fan yourself with that map. You’ll look like a tourist,” Dr. Jones tacks on.\n\n“Well that’ll teach me. All I packed were my woolens,” You answer dryly, leaning around Indiana to look through the window. The rocking of the car nudges you into him now and again. Your head knocks into his chin a couple of times.\n\n“Is this payback for taking the window seat on the plane?” You mutter as you try to take in Luxor through the open window.\n\n“I don’t know what you’re talking about, kid.”\n\nYou don’t have to look at Dr. Jones to know he’s smiling. His warm breath brushes your ear, and his arm curls around the seat behind you. Your entire body is going hot, and you wish you could blame it on the weather.\n\n–\n\nThe bedroom you’ll be spending the dig in is stunningly beautiful. You run your fingers over the cool sheets, taking in the desk in the corner of the room, and the large dresser against the wall. You drift toward the window, mouth opening in surprise at the view of the Nile not too far off. You hear a knock on your door, but it takes you a moment to answer. You’re so caught up in the sight.\n\nWhen you hear the knock again, you finally manage, “Hang on.” Your eyes remain set on the window for as long as they can, even as you back away—though you finally focus up when you walk into the bedframe. You walk around it once you’ve straightened up, and reach out, nudging your suitcases out of the way of the door frame before you tug your door open. Dr. Jones is leaning there, brow raised. His jacket and hat have been discarded, and before you can say a thing, he’s walking past you.\n\n“You like it in here?” He asks.\n\n“I do, it’s very nice.”\n\nJones grunts, strolling over to your window and leaning against the wall beside it, peering outside. You fold your arms, cocking your hip.\n\n“This isn’t more window envy, is it?” You ask, arching a brow.\n\n“Not at all. I’m right next door,” He nods to the wall to your right. “In fact, I think my view might be better.”\n\nYou can’t even bring yourself to be irritated by the tease because Dr. Jones is right next door to you? The fact shouldn’t make you nervous, but you suddenly feel even hotter than you did in the car.\n\n“Well,” You finally manage, “I’m pleased for you.”\n\nJones’ brow raises before he straightens up, heading for the door. “Orientation dinner tonight at seven. Everyone’s meeting in the lobby. Don’t be late.”\n\n“I’ve always been punctual.”\n\n“Uh-huh. I’m just saying, don’t let the jet lag get to you. You’ll insult the staff if you’re snoring in the koshari.”\n\n“I do not snore!”\n\nJones turns back to you, brows raised in disbelief. “So that was just an effect of dozing at 25,000 feet?”\n\nBefore you can so much as answer, Jones shuts the door behind himself. You huff in slight irritation before you turn to look around the room. You’ll shower first. You need a shower—badly—and then you’ll find something to wear for dinner…No, outfit first, then dinner. You can finish unpacking everything else later—and maybe you’ll have time to write a letter home and post it before dinner.\n\n–\n\nYour plans were overly ambitious. You only make it through the shower, the outfit, and half of the letter before you feel yourself drifting off to sleep. When you hear a knock at your door, you startle awake, smearing pen across your half-composed letter. You stand, hurrying to the bathroom and muttering, “No no no no no no no no,” As you spot a smudge of ink on your chin. You hurriedly scrub it off as you hear another knock. You hurry toward the door, taking up your small notebook, pen, and room key.\n\n“I don’t wanna hear it, Jo—” You start as you fling the door open, and then go quiet in embarrassment. “O-Oh. I’m sorry.”\n\nThere’s a startlingly handsome and familiar young man standing there. He just gives you a charming smile, chuckling.\n\n“S’alright. You heading down to orientation?”\n\n“Yes.” You get a couple of steps into the hall before tugging and locking the door behind yourself. The two of you walk side by side down the hall.\n\nMichael Harris has been your classmate in almost all of your courses so far. He’s a friendly guy, and incredibly smart. He’s ahead of you in the graduate program by at least one year, and you don’t know much about him. You find yourself glancing at him curiously as you turn the corner to the stairs.\n\nHis hair is an almost mousy brown, and trimmed neatly. His nose is upturned slightly over the pout of his pink lips. His bright blue eyes are focused ahead of you, which is a relief—finding them fully focused on you when you’d opened the door had been startling. They’re quite piercing, and warm where Walter’s were often cool.\n\nWalter. You wonder what he must be up to just now—and shove the thought back down as soon as it arises.\n\n“How’d you know to knock on my door?” You ask halfway down the stairs.\n\n“Oh, I heard Dr. Brody mention who was along our hall as he listed our rooms to me and the others. I’m uh—Two doors down, I think?”\n\n“Ah! Neat.”\n\nAs the two of you reach the lobby, you spot a cluster of students and teachers. Jones is lingering nearby, but seems to deliberately be refusing to engage with anyone. When another student walks to speak over him, Jones stands and excuses himself, taking a couple of steps away and seeming to mutter something as he checks his watch. The student lingers for just a second before he slouches away, looking defeated. You spot Dr. Brody flagging Michael down, and Michael smiles, reaching out and lightly touching your lower back as he murmurs, “Excuse me.” You nod understandingly, watching him go for a moment before you look around at the rest of the university group.\n\nIt doesn’t escape your notice that you’re the only female student—hell the only woman in the party, period. There are no girls from your classes, none of your incredibly knowledgeable female professors. You tuck your hands into the pockets of your linen pants, wandering toward the group, a touch at odds with who to speak with. That is, of course, when Dr. Jones sidles up beside you.\n\n“I think you’re the only one that brought a notebook,” He comments.\n\n“Well, their loss. If we wind up needing notes, they can’t copy off of mine and it’ll be their mistake for not planning ahead.” You turn to look at Jones, arching a brow. “I’m surprised you’re speaking to me.”\n\n“Why’s that?”\n\n“You seemed very occupied with your watch a moment ago,”\n\n“Oh, you noticed?” Jones asked, leaning against the railing as he lowered his voice, “Sweetheart, I’m flattered.”\n\nYou scoff a laugh as you turn to look at the others, your face going hot with the casual endearment.\n\n“C’mon,” He adds, straightening as the others head in for dinner.\n\n–\n\nIt’s an informative evening. You sit sandwiched between Michael and Dr. Jones, taking the odd note as Dr. Brody informs you about the plans for the excavation, and gives a brief lecture on Horemheb II.\n\nThe son of Horemheb, the last ruler of the eighteenth dynasty, Horemheb II had been trained as scribe of the House of Life, the institution charged with recording the lives and actions of the kingship. Supposedly, Horemheb II died near the end of his father’s reign, dashing one of many hopes for the line’s succession. An unfinished tomb for the pharaoh himself was diverted to house his son. This occupied a great deal of time and resources, the amount of which was almost unheard of at the time of his reign.\n\nHoremheb’s tomb had been discovered in 1908, and had included a number of innovations to tomb building. Horemheb II’s tomb is expected to have similar innovations, such as inscriptions of the Book of Gates, and bas-reliefs in place of the more basic paintings common for the period.\n\n“Now, there is a crew that will be working on this dig with us, a full crew,” Brody says, “So it won’t just be us rattling around out there. I know we all go in with dreams of discovering the next bust of Nefertiti…” He smiles as a chuckle rippled through the group. “But you may wish to cast that from your mind. There is always a chance that regardless of what we hope, we may not find what we are looking for. Any professor here can tell you more than one story about digging in a single spot for months and to no avail. We haven’t as much time as we’d like. There will reach a point when the heat is unbearable not only for us, but for the crew. When that time comes, we will shift our focus to what we’ve found, if anything—and turn our studies to the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities in Cairo. We’ll take on additional in-depth courses, and we will use the time inside to treat our sunburn before the semester begins in the fall. Alright? Any questions?…Excellent. Get some good rest. Our work begins tomorrow.”\n\n–\n\nIt’s chilly on the ferry to the East bank. You know that once the sun rises, you’ll be sweating, but as it is now, in your white linen shirt and khakis, you’re fighting the urge to shiver.\n\nYou peer over the railing of the ferry, shifting from foot to foot. Many of the others are sitting and getting in a brief, early nap, still drowsy from a short night’s sleep and lingering jet lag, but you can’t calm your excitement. You’re stunned you’re as awake as you are—you hardly slept last night. You were too excited, going over maps, guides, notes—marking out where you think may be a good place to look.\n\n“Are you alright?”\n\nYou turn to see Dr. Brody approaching, and you nod.\n\n“Eager to begin?” He adds.\n\n“Very.”\n\n“It’ll fade, once your body begins to ache.”\n\nYou chuckle softly, shaking your head. “I don’t know about that.”\n\n“We shall see.”\n\nBrody peers out over the water beside you for a few moments.\n\n“You know…When Jones recommended you come along, I was surprised,” he admits. The comment raises your hackles. But Brody goes on—“But he could not have chosen a better candidate.”\n\nYour smile at Dr. Brody, flattered, and mumble your bashful thanks.\n\n–\n\n“What are you worried about?” Dr. Brody asks. Indiana doesn’t answer right away, eyes clapped on the back of her head, watching her shift her backpack on her shoulder.\n\n“She’s the only woman here,” He mutters. He hadn’t even thought about that when he recommended her. Now and again, as the group treks more deeply into the valley, one of the guys will hold a hand out to help her along a particularly difficult path, but she always waves them off with a smile.\n\n“Surely you were aware that that was a possibility.”\n\n“I didn’t exactly pay attention to your rouster, Marcus.”\n\nHe can hear the ring of pick-axes now, hear the yell of Sallah’s orders to lift. As they near, Jones spots a team already working on pulling out a large rock on a wooden slab with a pulley. There are pulley ropes hanging loose where some men were either expected, or have moved to help the rock from the other side with wooden planks.\n\n“What’s your concern?” Marcus asks.\n\nIndiana stomach swoops with concern as she wobbles ahead of them, and then he spots someone—Michael, he thinks the guy’s name is—curl an arm around her lower back to keep her steady. He hears her laugh, sees her grin as she looks up to thank him. It raises an ire that Indiana has become all-too familiar with.\n\n“Nothing,” Indiana grumbles. “It’s just a very physical thing, an excavation.”\n\n“Something tells me she’s not concerned about breaking a nail.”\n\nIndiana opens his mouth to argue, but his yell is staunched by Sallah’s frantic yells of warning as the wood and rock begin to slip backward. Indiana watches as she drops her backpack, darting forward with other students to take hold of the dangling ropes. His breath catches in his throat as the rope slips in her grip—he can imagine that burns, is sure she’ll let go—but she just wraps her hand around the rope for a better grip and tugs when Sallah calls to pull. She and the others move with the workman, turning with the wooden slab and stone and lowering it away as Sallah directs.\n\nMarcus glances up at Indiana, a pleased smile on his lips.\n\n“I think she can handle it,” He reassures, patting Jones’ back before moving forward. Jones watches him go before turning to look at her again. He scoops up her backpack on the way over, watching her unwind the rope from her left hand, and wince. He clears his throat as he nears her, holding out her backpack.\n\n“Thank you,” She mutters, slinging it over his shoulder. Before he can ask about her hand, or look, he hears, “Indy!”\n\nIndiana looks up, grinning as he sees Sallah approaching. The two embrace lightly, patting one another’s backs before drawing away.\n\n“It is good to see you again, my friend,” Sallah grins.\n\n“And you. How’s Fayah?”\n\n“She is well.”\n\n“And the kids?”\n\n“Growing every day.”\n\nSallah turns to look at her, smiling. “Thank you for your assistance, Miss…?”\n\nIndiana watches her introduce herself, give a small wave with her right hand before she tacks on, “Happy to help.”\n\n“She’s one of the most promising students in the history department,” Jones admits before he can stop himself. She’s looking at him then in surprise, brows raising, almost in confusion. Indiana turns away from her without another word, already regretting saying a thing.\n\n“We can use quick hands and quick thinking,” Sallah smiles, though he gives Jones a knowing look. Sallah’s name is called by one of the workman, and he murmurs, “Excuse me.”\n\n“Sure—Hey, don’t forget to say hi to Brody.”\n\nSallah offers a wave of acknowledgement as he walks away. Jones looks at her again, his gaze dropping to where she seems to be fidgeting with her pocket.\n\n“Show me your hand,” He orders. When she doesn’t right away, he gives her a knowing look.\n\n“I’m fine,” She insists.\n\n“If you’re fine, then show me and I’ll drop it.”\n\nShe winces before she raises it just enough for him to see. There’s irritation across the palm, and the raising of broken skin in a couple of spots.\n\n“C’mon,” Indiana orders, pointing her toward a space away from the business of the dig. “Sooner we bandage it, the sooner we get to it.”\n\n“We don’t need to—” She starts, but a knowing look from under the brim of Jones’ hat quiets her.\n\n–\n\nYou glance around at the rock, eyeing the ground before you lower yourself down. You let your brown leather backpack slide to the ground, setting your open hand on your knee as you wait for Jones to get the kit out of his bag.\n\n“It’s gonna sting,” He warns.\n\n“It already stings,” You sigh, fighting the urge to flex around the irritated skin. Jones takes hold of your wrist, lifting it from your pant leg and pouring water over your palm. You wince, fingers tensing, still straining not to close your hand and worsen the feeling. You push a soft breath out between your lips before glancing around self-consciously. But no one is minding you, or Jones, or your closeness. You look back down at your palm as Jones dabs bactine onto the patches of broken skin.\n\n“…You moved pretty quickly,” Jones mutters.\n\n“Well, it looked important.”\n\n“It was. But try not to be so impulsive next time.”\n\nIrritation roils through you, and you glare at Jones as he tucks the bactine away.\n\n“I’m not the only one who ran,” You argue.\n\n“I know.”\n\n“So are you going to give them this talk, too?”\n\n“If I have to.”\n\n“You don’t have to give it to me.”\n\nJones offers you an amused glance before looking down at your hand again, unrolling gauze.\n\n“You have gloves?” He asks.\n\n“Yeah. In my backpack.”\n\n“Should’ve worn them.”\n\n“I didn’t have time to go into my backpack for them.”\n\n“Well, put them on for the rest of the day—and don’t forget to clean it tonight.”\n\n“Alright, alright.” You go quiet as Jones begins to tenderly and securely wrap the bandage around your hand. He does it with such care and concentration, taking careful hold of your wrist now and again to steady you. The touch sends goosebumps skittering up your arm, despite the rising heat in the valley. As Jones tucks the bandage in, he lifts his head, seemingly to say something else to you. But he goes quiet as his fingers smooth over your bare left ring finger, his eyes searching yours for some answer to an unasked question.\n\nYou swear the ringing of pickaxes dims, the call and singing of the workmen quieting as you look at Jones. You’ve looked at him this way before—you know how dangerous this feeling is.\n\nYou clear your throat, pulling your hand back from his and reaching into your bag, rifling around for your leather gloves.\n\n“…Got ‘em?” Jones asks. You hum in the affirmative, nodding, and pull the gloves out, tugging them on.\n\n“Thanks,” You mumble, “For—You know.”\n\n“Sure,” Jones nods, standing. Then—“Try not to make it a habit of it.”\n\nYou roll your eyes, watching Jones descend toward the site. You stand, dusting off your pants and hiking your backpack up onto your shoulder, making your way back down to the others. You sigh softly, glancing down at your injured hand and curl your fingers just a little to test to pain. It’s not too bad—you’re certain it’ll be worse after some more work. But there’s only one way to find that out, of course."
