Sallah, Blade National Affairs Writer\n\nDRUG PROBE SPOTLIGHTS THE SECRET LIFE OF O.J.\n\nMIAMI - Bloodied by a custody battle and stripped of his wealth, O.J. Simpson left his native California two years ago with his children to seek refuge on the forgiving shores of South Florida.\n\nThe single parent vowed he just wanted to be a doting father, play golf, and live quietly in an unpretentious home amidst the cookie-cutter neighborhoods of suburban Miami.\n\nBut since his arrival, his life has been anything but tranquil.\n\nThe 54-year-old former football great has been living a self-indulgent lifestyle of cocaine binges, strip club rendezvous, and late-night visits to the home of a Miami dealer to buy illegal drugs, defendants in a drug case have told the FBI.\n\nSo close has been Mr. Simpson to the Miami drug scene that a dealer in an international narcotics ring stayed in Mr. Simpson's guest home - and drove the Simpson children to and from school at the same time he was orchestrating drug transactions, according to the statements in confidential FBI documents obtained by The Blade.\n\nThe admitted dealer, Andrew Anderson, 34, allegedly was supplying the former athlete and his girlfriends with the illegal drug Ecstasy - a hallucinogenic substance that's popular in many Miami Beach clubs.\n\nThroughout his first two years in Florida - as Mr. Simpson was trying to restore his image through hospital visits and media interviews - he was indulging in cocaine and Ecstasy, records state.\n\nShortly after his acquittal in his now famous road rage case on Oct. 24, he visited the home of drug dealer Zenaida Galvez, 36, to buy cocaine to celebrate with girlfriends, the dealer told the FBI this year.\n\n\"Simpson stated that he knew he was going to win,\" her statement says.\n\nInformed of The Blade's story, Mr. Simpson said the allegations aren't true. \"I live a simple lifestyle,\" he told the Associated Press yesterday. \"I raise my kids. I play golf. I don't do drugs, and no drug dealer has ever stayed in my house.\"\n\nThe public has become familiar with Mr. Simpson's sometimes topsy-turvy life in South Florida, including public spats with former girlfriend Christie Prody.\n\nBut now, for the first time, the FBI records reflect events, places, and in some cases, times in which the onetime actor is alleged to have taken part in drug parties.\n\nThough he was never the target of a narcotics probe - and has not been charged - federal agents stumbled across his name in the course of investigating an international Ecstasy ring, FBI records show.\n\nMore than 200 pages of documents covering a period of late 1999 to November, 2001 - including transcripts of FBI wire taps - were reviewed by The Blade. About a dozen of those records relate to Mr. Simpson.\n\nThe reports - including FBI agents' records of witness statements and surveillance of his ranch-style home - paint a vastly different picture of the man who moved to the Miami suburb of Kendall to keep a low profile and be a soccer dad.\n\nHis lawyer, Yale Galanter, said on Friday his client was not involved in drugs, nor did he ever allow a dealer to live at his home, located 15 miles southwest of Miami. \"There is no link between them.\"\n\nTo be sure, the allegations against Mr. Simpson are coming largely from three key members of a drug ring that imported hundreds of thousands of Ecstasy pills from Holland.\n\nThe three suspects, Anderson, Galvez, and John Thorburn, 32, have pleaded guilty to their roles in the case that led to the high-profile search of Mr. Simpson's beige, Spanish ranch-style home on Dec. 4.\n\nThough agents said they did not find Ecstasy in the home, police inventory records show that four bags of suspected marijuana, cocaine residue, two drug pipes, and a can with marijuana residue were turned up by agents.\n\nDuring a six-hour search, agents seized several pieces of satellite-dish equipment from the home.\n\nPart of the FBI investigation touched on the illegal sale of counterfeit dish cards that allow viewers to steal signals, but agents did not say whether they found those cards in the Simpson home.\n\nSeven years after he was acquitted in the killing of former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman - the so-called trial of the century - Mr. Simpson is under the scrutiny of law enforcement again.\n\nThe U.S. attorney's office in Miami refuses to comment. \"We just don't confirm investigations,\" said Barry Sabin, the chief assistant U.S. attorney in Miami.\n\nMost of the defendants in the drug ring - a total of nine - have pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy charges and will be sentenced on May 20 and June 4 by U.S. District Judge Paul Huck. One suspect is believed to be in Brazil.\n\nOne former defendant, Toledo developer Mark Nowakowski, was acquitted by a federal jury in Miami on March 14 - with people on both sides of the case now saying there's no evidence the developer was selling drugs.\n\nBut ironically, it was his cell phone - used by a friend - that helped lead authorities to O.J. Simpson, according to federal wire-tap records.\n\nInitially, the Hall of Fame running back was not part of the federal investigation into Ecstasy.\n\nIn fact, when the Drug Enforcement Administration and FBI began their probe in 1999 - now known as Operation X - Mr. Simpson was still living in California.\n\nBut several months after the former athlete bought his home in the Miami suburb in September, 2000, FBI agents heard his name in telephone wiretaps, according to interviews and records.\n\nBy February, 2001, plainclothes investigators were watching his 4,343-square-foot home, and later, eavesdropping on cell phone conversations between Mr. Simpson and Anderson.\n\nIn several instances, the 6-foot-2-inch former actor was seen with Anderson at the Simpson home, and making trips to the popular South Beach.\n\nMr. Simpson's lawyer says his client is being depicted as a drug user by people who don't even know him. He said Mr. Simpson barely knew Anderson, and it was only because his client went to a massage parlor owned by the drug dealer.\n\nMr. Simpson is just trying to raise his children, Sydney, 16, and Justin, 13, without the distractions that he experienced in California.\n\n\"It's as normal as life could possibly be for someone with the name O.J. Simpson,\" says the Fort Lauderdale attorney\n\nFootball hero and the Ohio developer\n\nOrenthal James Simpson never met developer Mark Nowakowski, court testimony shows. The men come from vastly different backgrounds.\n\nThe 44-year-old Mr. Nowakowski was building custom homes in northwest Ohio when Mr. Simpson was standing trial with a dream team of lawyers.\n\nBut a call from the developer's cell phone on Feb. 24, 2001 - combined with other events - would thrust both men into the middle of one of Florida's most publicized Ecstasy investigations.\n\nAccording to FBI records, Mr. Nowakowski, who was spending the winter in South Beach, was sleeping on a chaise lounge when an acquaintance used the developer's cell phone to call a local drug dealer, John Thorburn.\n\nThe reason: to buy the club drug Ecstasy - a substance that carries similar criminal penalties as cocaine.\n\nUnbeknownst to the people on both ends of the phone call, federal agents were listening on a wiretap.\n\nDuring the conversation, Thorburn said he'd get the drugs, and then called his supplier: Andrew Anderson.\n\nThorburn needed more Ecstasy for his customers.\n\n\"OK, well, listen here, you ... bring the package for me, you know,\" said Thorburn to his supplier.\n\n\"Oh, Lord, that's in my car,\" Anderson answered.\n\n\"Where's your car? Down south?\" asked Thorburn.\n\n\"Yeah,\" answered Anderson. \"Over at O.J.'s house.\"\n\nWithin an hour, task force agent Antonio Marciante and four others were secretly watching Mr. Simpson's home. Parked in his driveway was Anderson's car.\n\nLater, Thorburn called Anderson again to see if he had the drugs, but Anderson said he had not yet retrieved them from his car in O.J. Simpson's driveway, records state. He said he was actually walking along Ocean Drive in Miami Beach with Mr. Simpson and his son, Justin, then 12.\n\nDuring the phone call, Anderson commented that women were walking up to Mr. Simpson to get his picture while complimenting his son on how \"beautiful\" he looked to them.\n\nLater that evening, drug task force agents noted that Mr. Simpson drove into his driveway in his black Lincoln Navigator with Anderson inside.\n\nAnderson climbed into his car and left.\n\nThe Holland connection\n\nFor six months, agents not only watched Anderson, but tapped his phone.\n\nRecords show they soon learned that he was a companion to Mr. Simpson, as well as a dealer in an Ecstasy ring.\n\nOthers would smuggle the drug into the country from Holland - 200,000 pills in 2001 - and Anderson would help sell it.\n\nAlso known as Adrian Burke, he was wanted in Mississippi on marijuana trafficking charges when he moved to Miami.\n\nThe muscular, 5-foot, 10-inch Jamaican national with a goatee became a known figure in the South Beach clubs, witnesses told agents.\n\nSeveral years ago, he opened a Kendall massage parlor called Euphoria, which was later suspected by FBI agents as a front for prostitution.\n\nThough Anderson sometimes stayed at O.J. Simpson's guest house - next to the main house and pool - he actually met the former actor when Mr. Simpson was visiting the area and looking for a home in 1999, records state.\n\nAnother person who met Mr. Simpson around the same time was Zenaida Galvez, also known as Gigi.\n\nShe told FBI agents during extensive interviews on Jan. 11 and Jan. 14 that she was introduced to the former football player by Anderson at a sushi restaurant in the fall of 1999.\n\nLater, at Anderson's behest, she began selling cocaine regularly to Mr. Simpson and his onetime girlfriend, Christie Prody, the dealer told agents.\n\nBy early 2000, Miss Prody was living in Miami, and Mr. Simpson would stay with her until he bought his house. At the time, he was steeped in a custody battle in California with the relatives of his slain former wife - a dispute he won.\n\n\"When Simpson visited Miami, both Prody and Simpson called Galvez for cocaine, and would visit Galvez at her apartment to pick up cocaine,\" her FBI interview states. Galvez even showed agents that she had Mr. Simpson's number logged in her cell phone memory.\n\nGalvez went on to tell agents that during the course of her friendship with Mr. Simpson, he offered to get her a \"counterfeit\" satellite dish card.\n\nWhen Galvez gave birth to her daughter in January, 2001, Mr. Simpson brought her a stuffed panda, she said.\n\nFor a time, Mr. Simpson and his girlfriend were popping into her life at all hours - much to her dismay, reports said.\n\n\"Simpson and Prody arrived at Galvez' house approximately three to four times during the early morning hours to buy cocaine from Galvez,\" her statement reads. \"Galvez did not let them in the house due to the odd hours and the fact that Simpson and Prody were already high on drugs.\"\n\nProblems arose in October, 1999, when Mr. Simpson called police to complain that Miss Prody was \"on a cocaine binge\" with a former Los Angeles Dodgers player, and was not at home, according to a police report.\n\nLater, he said it was all a misunderstanding: He was talking about another person - not Miss Prody.\n\nTwo months later, Mr. Simpson was invited to a party thrown by Thorburn at his fashionable high-rise apartment in Miami Beach.\n\nAnother known figure on the South Beach club scene, Thorburn told FBI agents early this year that he and the former actor snorted cocaine through the evening with two other guests. \"The cocaine was taken in Thorburn's bedroom,\" according to the dealer's statements.\n\nThe move to Florida\n\nAfter winning his custody case, Mr. Simpson was mired in debt when he moved to Miami in May, 2000.\n\nHis $10 million fortune was eroded by his legal fees from his 1995 murder trial, and two years later, he was found liable for the deaths of his former wife and Ronald Goldman.\n\nOrdered by the California court to pay $33.5 million to the surviving relatives, his lawyers said he was broke.\n\nHowever, while he lost his accumulated wealth, he still had a source of income: a $20,000-a-month pension from his NFL playing days - money that can't be touched by the courts.\n\nTo further protect his assets, Mr. Simpson said he moved to Florida because of a state law that forbids the seizure of a person's home to pay a civil penalty, according to published interviews.\n\nBut it was a rough start. At first, he was involved in public spats with Miss Prody, whom he met in California.\n\nIn May, 2000, security guards at a Miami hotel called police to a late-night dispute between the couple - where Miss Prody allegedly kicked and slapped the former actor. He refused to press charges.\n\nIn September - the same month he purchased his home for $575,000 in Kendall - - he was accused by his girlfriend of breaking into her Miami home, erasing a message on her answering machine, and stealing a letter, a police report states. She did not press charges.\n\nThat fall, Mr. Simpson enrolled his two children in the Gulliver Academy, one of the oldest private schools in the area. During an impromptu press conference near the school, he asked reporters to respect his children's privacy.\n\n\"We just want to go about our normal lives,\" he said.\n\nBut according to FBI reports, life was anything but normal.\n\nGalvez, the cocaine dealer, was becoming frustrated with Mr. Simpson and his girlfriend. They were knocking at her door at all hours, she told agents.\n\nEventually, Galvez said she told Mr. Simpson he was welcome at her home - but not Miss Prody.\n\n\"Prody frequently arrived at Galvez' house unannounced for cocaine,\" her statement reads. \"Prody called Galvez so much that Galvez changed her cellular telephone number.\"\n\nOn Dec. 4, Mr. Simpson ran into his own problems that would spill over into the courts.\n\nIn a dispute with another motorist in Kendall, he was accused of exiting his vehicle, reaching into the open window of the other vehicle and grabbing the driver's $300 sunglasses, while scratching the man's temple.\n\nMr. Simpson was charged with a felony and misdemeanor in what became known as the O.J. Road Rage case.\n\nSeveral local defense lawyers weighed in, saying it was a case of overkill. Mr. Simpson called a press conference, saying he was being singled out unfairly because of the controversy surrounding his double murder acquittal.\n\n\"I want to test this case [in court] to show people what kind of life I live,\" he said.\n\nAround the same time of his arrest, he met Galvez, Anderson, and two others for dinner at the Bahama Breeze, Galvez told agents.\n\nLater that night, Mr. Simpson began snorting cocaine - and continued through the early morning, she said.\n\nFrom the restaurant, they went to the Pink Pony strip club, and later, to other strip clubs: Stir Crazy and Tootsie's. \"Galvez advised that the group received VIP treatment at every club, including free drinks and free entertainment,\" the report says. \"Simpson was using cocaine the entire evening ...\"\n\nEight months later, Mr. Simpson took his road rage case to trial in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court and was acquitted of all charges on Oct. 24. As the verdict was read, he closed his eyes and bowed his head, mouthing the words, \"thank you,\" to the jury.\n\nGalvez told agents that after the trial, Mr. Simpson called her looking to get drugs to entertain several girlfriends.\n\nShe said Mr. Simpson came to her apartment and gave her a $100 bill. She went out and bought 21/2 grams of cocaine - with Mr. Simpson waiting at her home - and she returned to give him the drug.\n\nThe former actor then \"called the girls he was to meet on his cellular telephone and agreed to meet them at Bahama Breeze,\" her report states. \"Simpson bragged about how good-looking the girls were\" before leaving.\n\nGalvez' last recollection of her alleged dealings with Mr. Simpson was not about drugs. In November, 2001, she asked him to adopt a Rottweiler that a friend was giving away. He agreed.\n\nThe search of O.J.'s home On the morning of Dec. 4, O.J. Simpson was getting his children ready for school when he answered the doorbell in his bathrobe.\n\nHe was greeted by federal agents with a search warrant.\n\nAfter more than two years, Operation X - the investigation into Ecstasy and the sale of illegal satellite-dish cards - was nearly over.\n\nWith a television helicopter hovering overhead and news reporters standing by, 15 agents spent the next six hours combing through Mr. Simpson's home.\n\nWhile the search was under way, other agents fanned out across the Miami area, arresting eight people, including Galvez, Anderson, Thorburn, and Mark Nowakowski. All were charged with conspiracy with intent to distribute Ecstasy.\n\nMr. Simpson's lawyer, Yale Galanter, showed up at his client's home and talked to reporters, casting doubts on whether his client knew the other suspects.\n\nHe said Mr. Simpson's only connection to the case is that his name was mentioned in a phone conversation between two suspects. In a recent interview with The Blade, he said \"there is no link at all\" between his client and the others.\n\n\"This was two guys bullshitting about their alleged contacts with a celebrity,\" he said.\n\nMr. Galanter said federal agents carted away satellite-TV equipment, but that Mr. Simpson had purchase receipts for the goods.\n\nAccording to FBI documents, Galvez, who said she watched TV at the Simpson home, said the former athlete told her he had counterfeit cards.\n\nAfter the search and the arrests of the other suspects, prosecutors were alarmed to learn that some of the people taken into custody confessed they knew the federal agents were coming.\n\nTurns out, a member of the grand jury hearing the case knew the boyfriend of Galvez - and tipped him off. The juror, John Ocosta, 31, admitted he called Galvez' boyfriend, who in turn told Galvez.\n\nAfter her arrest, Galvez admitted she called Anderson to warn him. It's not known whether Anderson then called Mr. Simpson.\n\nSo far, nearly all of the defendants have pleaded guilty, except for Mr. Nowakowski, who refused to accept a plea deal.\n\nAfter nearly four days of trial, he was found not guilty by a federal jury in Miami. He took the stand and admitted he purchased small amounts of Ecstasy for personal use, but never sold it.\n\n\"It was the most asinine thing I ever did,\" the Toledo developer said recently. \"But I never, ever sold it. Nor was I ever part of any conspiracy.\"\n\nHe said he did not know any of the defendants except for Thorburn, whom he met at a South Beach party.\n\nThe divorced developer said his arrest occurred during a mid-life crisis filled with excess partying in South Beach, once even getting arrested in a barroom brawl. But it was a brief period - one that he regrets, he says.\n\nConsidered by local planners as an innovative developer, the St. Francis de Sales High School graduate is back in Toledo trying to restart his life - and repair his image.\n\nHis two lawyers, Jeffrey Zilba and Ed O'Donnell, said they believe the sole reason Mr. Nowakowski was arrested was because his cell phone was used to start a series of calls that led investigators to O.J. Simpson.\n\nThe person who used the Toledo man's phone was identified in court as his acquaintance, Thomas Barone of Miami, who was never arrested.\n\n\"Mark should have never been charged. His reputation was hurt for something he never did. And that, to me, is outrageous,\" says Mr. O'Donnell, a longtime Miami criminal defense lawyer.\n\n\"In all my years, I never saw anything like it. This was not about Operation X. This was Operation O.J.\"\n\nAuthorities hold items\n\nFive months after the search of Mr. Simpson's home, prosecutors have not returned the items seized from the house.\n\nQuestions abound over whether anyone else will be charged, or whether the case will end with the sentencing of four defendants, including Anderson and Thorburn, on June 4. They face up to 20 years on the conspiracy charges.\n\nMr. Simpson's lawyer says he has been dutifully watching the activities of prosecutors in this case. \"I am in the very fortunate position that my client has not been arrested,\" Mr. Galanter said in an interview last month.\n\n\"Not only has my client not been arrested, but it is clear now, many months after Dec. 4 [the search of the Simpson home], that the feds didn't find anything of any narcotics-related illegal activity in the house.\"\n\nProsecutors refuse to talk about the inventory list, which states that marijuana and other suspected drugs were found on the property, or if they have found counterfeit satellite-dish cards - a federal offense that carries a penalty of up to five years in jail.\n\nMr. Galanter counters that any marijuana found on the property does not belong to his client and amounted to only trace amounts.\n\nMore than 250 phone calls to and from Anderson's phone were recorded by federal agents last year on a 60-day wire-tap order, including numerous conversations with Mr. Simpson, say people familiar with the matter.\n\nBut for now, the information that led to the search of the former football player's home is sealed under a court order.\n\nMr. O'Donnell, a former Miami assistant state attorney, said he believes O.J. Simpson and the Ecstasy dealer, Andrew Anderson, were more than just passing acquaintances. After spending weeks pouring over FBI surveillance documents, witness accounts, and wire taps, he said he is convinced they knew each other well.\"\n\n\"I think there is enough information to establish that,\" he said.\n\nMr. O'Donnell said he believes prosecutors tried, but fell short, of pulling the former running back into the heart of the investigation.\n\n\"It's not like they set out to get him, but once they saw his name pop up, they tried to put him in the middle of this thing,\" he said.\n\nMr. Simpson said yesterday that he believes his name emerged in the drug investigation \"because it's a non-story if I'm not in it.\"\n\n\"I don't sell drugs. I don't buy drugs,\" he said.\n\nOver the past year, Mr. Simpson has been appearing at concerts and events, and making visits to patients in Miami hospitals.\n\nHe kicked off a rap concert in Cincinnati's Music Hall on March 2, where he beckoned the crowd \"not to give the media anything to write about ... rap is getting a bad name, and I know about bad raps.\"\n\nLike other retirees in Florida, he hobbles around on arthritic knees, plays golf at mostly public courses, and retreats to his tree-shrouded home set on a half acre of former scrub land.\n\nHis lawyer insists his client has been well received in the Miami area, and \"absolutely loves it down here.\" Others agree.\n\n\"He's a star down here,\" says Mr. O'Donnell. \"People want to play golf with him. He's invited to parties.\"\n\nBut Mr. Simpson does run into people who remind him of his double murder acquittal.\n\nAt O'Casey's Pub, a popular lounge near his home, a customer recently made a remark to the former athlete about the stabbing death of his former wife.\n\n\"I haven't seen O.J. in here since then,\" said a bartender. \"And he used to come in here and have lunch all the time. He'd even bring his kids.\"\n\nThough South Florida has traditionally been a place where people could move to drop out, that would be difficult for Mr. Simpson.\n\n\"He's a well-known figure who happened to be the defendant in one of the most watched trials in American history,\" says Dr. Don Nance, a psychologist who studies sports heroes. \"People all have an opinion on his guilt or his innocence - and he's going to run into all those people down there.\"\n\nGiven the divided feelings about Mr. Simpson, controversy will follow him in South Florida as long as he lives there, says Mr. O'Donnell, who has practiced law 32 years in the area.\n\n\"If you're someone like O.J., you've got to be careful of your associations down here,\" said Mr. O'Donnell, referring to the intense media and police presence in the area. \"Prosecutors will look at him and say, 'He may have gotten off in California, but he's not going to get off here.'''\n\nMAP posted-by: Jay Bergstrom"
