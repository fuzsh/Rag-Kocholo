        "text": "Career\n\nAlexander made his Broadway acting debut in the short-lived Stephen Sondheim musical Merrily We Roll Along (1981), and he earned critical acclaim for his performance in the musical Jerome Robbins’ Broadway (1989). He appeared in several television shows and films, such the medical drama series E/R (1984–85), the comedy film Brighton Beach Memoirs (1986), and the drama The Mosquito Coast (1986). In 1989 he moved to California to work on Seinfeld, a comedy series that was initially called The Seinfeld Chronicles.\n\nOn Seinfeld, which would become a huge commercial and critical success, Alexander teamed up with stand-up comedian Jerry Seinfeld and actors Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Michael Richards to portray a group of friends in late 1980s and ’90s New York City. Alexander would ultimately become a star, playing the mendacious ne’er-do-well George Costanza, whose character was partly based on comedian and writer Larry David, the show’s cocreator. George’s various jobs and life roles include assistant to the traveling secretary for the New York Yankees baseball team, trapped fiancé, and poseur marine biologist and architect. In the process, George would utter several memorable lines and catchphrases that highlighted his emotional instability and bizarre perspective, such as “A George divided against itself cannot stand!” and “The sea was angry that day, my friends, like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli.”\n\nDuring his time on Seinfeld, which ran for nine seasons, Alexander also appeared on several films and other television shows, such as Pretty Woman, the drama Love! Valour! Compassion! (1997), and the comedy series The Larry Sanders Show (1994–98). His post-Seinfeld projects include directing the coming-of-age comedy Just Looking (1999), portraying the character Mauricio in the romantic comedy Shallow Hal (2001), and taking roles in the comedy series Bob Patterson (2001) and Listen Up (2004–05). Alexander appeared as himself in several episodes of Larry David’s comedy series, Curb Your Enthusiasm (2001 and 2009), joining fellow Seinfeld cast members in a fictional reunion. In 2019 he portrayed Asher Friedman, a blacklisted playwright, in the comedy-drama series The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel."
