        "text": "I get why this group of A-listers got involved - when Jerry Seinfeld calls, you pick up the phone. But why is Jerry Seinfeld doing this in the first place? Does anyone think this looks good?\n\nOf course it will probably be Netflix’s top movie of 2024.\n\nAh, but he was a co-writer and co-producer as well as a voice artist. It was Jerry’s burning idea and drive about a platonic romantic relationship between a bee and a human woman that (he thought) would light up the silver screen. He went to Steven Spielberg for help realizing his creative vision; Spielberg passed him along to his DreamWorks compatriot Jeffrey Katzenberg. And why not? Katzenberg had championed that previous masterwork about drone insects, romance, and life in the big city, anchored by the vocal talents of a legendary comedian with a penchant for dating much younger women: Antz.\n\nIt’s true that on Bee Movie, Seinfeld did not take the role of what cineastes may refer to as an auteur. He may not have worked on the animation rigging, lighting, data storage, vocal direction, shot composition, and so on, ensuring that every frame was his and only his conceptual output. But often, definitionally, a producer is also referred to as a filmmaker.\n\nIf Bee Movie had won the 2008 Academy Award for Best Picture (assuming a few premises, such as, but not limited to, if the Animated Best Picture category did not exist, and if that Ratatouille would not have then defeated No Country For Old Men and There Will Be Blood as well as Bee Movie (possibly replacing Juno?)), Jerry Seinfeld, as producer, would have given the acceptance speech. And so I submit that Unfrosted is not his first foray into filmmaking."
