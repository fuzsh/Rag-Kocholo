        "text": "To hear Jerry Seinfeld deconstruct a joke is like watching a world-renowned artist paint something just for you. Take his beloved Pop-Tart joke. On the surface, it chronicles the invention of the breakfast staple, and especially how the delicacy resonated with a young Seinfeld. It’s a simple idea, but what you don’t see when he tells the joke in his 2020 stand-up special 23 Hours to Kill is how the sausage—or in this case, the Pop-Tart—was made. Seinfeld spent roughly 10 years testing out the joke, refining it, and making sure every beat hit just right before he committed it to film.\n\nAs good as the joke ended up being, it wasn’t initially clear to him that it should be…a movie. Over the years, Seinfeld would joke about the prospect of the film with one of the cowriters, Spike Feresten, who was an early believer. Another cowriter, Andy Robin, suggested making the movie like The Right Stuff, except set in the cereal world. That idea tickled Seinfeld, so along with another cowriter, Barry Marder, they all started writing it.\n\nUnfrosted, which Seinfeld himself directed and which comes out on Netflix on May 3, is the story of two cereal juggernauts, Kellogg’s and Post Cereal, with Seinfeld playing Bob Cabana, a Kellogg’s employee. The premise is loosely true in that both companies were competing to come out with a mass-produced breakfast pastry first. Beyond that, reality takes a backseat to the jokes and the comedy all-stars in the cast, including Jim Gaffigan, Amy Schumer, Melissa McCarthy, Hugh Grant, Jon Hamm, Sarah Cooper, James Marsden, Peter Dinklage, Bill Burr, Dan Levy, Christian Slater, Sebastian Maniscalco, Cedric the Entertainer, and more.\n\nVanity Fair spoke with Seinfeld about crafting jokes, directing for the first time, the Curb Your Enthusiasm finale, and whether he has any life goals he hasn’t yet achieved.\n\nVanity Fair: Before we get started, I want to say that one of the earliest supporters I ever had as a writer was your late manager, George Shapiro.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Aw, that’s great. Anytime someone brings up George to me, I know it’s going to be a great day.\n\nLet’s talk about your original Pop-Tart joke. You put it in a Netflix special in 2020, but you had been working on it for a full decade before then. When do you feel like a joke is ready? Is it when you feel like the audience is connecting with it?\n\nWell, yeah. I’ll just say right up front I’m very guilty of endless baseball analogies, but you have to hit at a certain level to be in the lineup. And it’s the same with jokes. They have to work with a certain consistency and get a certain size laugh where I say “Okay, that’s good enough. You can be part of the regular team.” But before that, they try. They want to get in. They want to be part of the show. It’s very difficult because you keep raising the line, or try to.\n\nEspecially when you’re such a tough critic of your jokes.\n\nIt’s not me. It’s them. The audience. When you’re talking to an audience, there’s nothing else going on in that room. And if that joke is not good, it is intensely boring and annoying. That’s the kind of unforgiving part of comedy.\n\nYou’ve mentioned that you were sort of hesitant to the idea of doing a film of the Pop-Tart bit when Spike Feresten first ran the idea by you. How much convincing did it take?\n\nI never knew if he was serious all those years that we were joking about it. When we were in COVID and doing nothing, he said “Let’s have a meeting about making that movie.” And I still thought it was a ridiculous idea. But Andy Robin—who was one of my favorite writers from the years of the series—threw out “Why don’t we tell the story like it’s The Right Stuff.” That was the click that I went, “Oh yeah. That’ll be fun. Let’s make it super serious.”\n\nWas there a specific moment when you’re writing the film that you just couldn’t wait to get it up on its feet and shoot it? What were you most excited about?\n\nFull Cereal Honors [which takes place at a funeral sequence for one of the characters]. That was also Andy’s idea—that someone who dies in the service of creating a breakfast product would be buried with Full Cereal Honors. And then we came up with all the pieces. One of the key pieces was my daughter’s idea of the prize inside the box being the American flag folded up for the widow.\n\nThere’s about 10 jokes layered on top of each other in that sequence.\n\nBut the thing that makes it, for me, is you see the mascots and you think, “Okay, that’s the joke.” And then you see the cereal and the milk in the grave and you think, “Okay, that’s a good joke. That must be the reason they did this.” And the way they say “Snap. Crack-el. Ppppop!” Like marines. Which I think those guys came up with on the day we were shooting. That’s what I live for. I literally live for Wow. We put a sprinkle on top of a cherry.\n\nWhen did you realize that you wanted to direct the movie yourself?\n\nDirecting’s nothing. When you have an idea as a writer, you know how you want it to be. But most writers are not good at talking to people and navigating a layered social situation. But as a comedian, I’m able to do that. It’s just a way to streamline. It’s just a writer making a movie. That’s all a director is, for me.\n\nWas there anything you were nervous to direct? When I’ve talked to other directors, the general consensus is crowd scenes are the trickiest, and you have a pretty big one towards the end, which features all kinds of food mascots in a parody of a recent historical event.\n\nThe crowd scene was the worst for me. That was the most tension. I remember walking into that set in Irvine and thinking, “I have no idea how to do this.” But I had these amazing people around me, like my first AD, Bill Pope, who shot the movie. They knew exactly what to do. And I know what’s funny and not funny. So it really was not hard.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, I love how far you take that crowd scene. Seeing all those angry mascots comes completely out of left field.\n\nIf you’re gonna waste people’s time, you have to really waste it with bravado. That’s comedy: wasting people’s time with real bravado. You can’t be shy about it.\n\nYou’ve always said that your first time on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson was a pivotal part of your life. How surreal was it to recreate the atmosphere of that show and put your character on that couch back in 1963?\n\nThat was too fun because we made it the New York Tonight Show, where Jimmy Fallon works now. We got Kyle Dunnigan to do the Carson impression. And then we did the CGI face replacement thing. It’s pretty flawless. The hardest part was getting the hair right. The set is an exact duplicate of his old set, which we took from old video, and obviously the face is his face. Yeah, it’s really funny to go on The Tonight Show in 1963. For me, obviously, that was a dream come true. That’s when I was first watching comedians and falling in love with them.\n\nDid you write the film with certain actors in mind?\n\nThe only person that we knew was that Jim Gaffigan was going to play Edsel Kellog, mostly because I thought he just looked so perfect. He’s such a food guy, and he’s such a funny guy. And because he was my friend, I knew he’d say yes. So we just knew we had him, but we didn’t know we had anybody else.\n\nMelissa McCarthy really gives her absolute all in this film.\n\nOh, she is the greatest. And she’s so experienced. She comes on the set and she helped me with cameras and blocking, because she knows so much about making films. Me coming from TV, you don’t really move the cameras that much. But with film, you can do anything—even though it’s, of course, technically video. So she was so helpful and brilliantly funny.\n\nThere are some fun Easter eggs that people will have a field day with. What are some of your favorites?\n\nThere’s so many, like when Hugh Grant is complaining as Tony the Tiger about shooting the commercial. I wanted that to be a tribute to the Orson Welles Jolly Green Giant frozen peas commercial when he loses it and starts screaming at the guy in the booth. “From the depths of your ignorance, what is it that you want?” So that’s one of my favorites. But there’s lots of them.\n\nI’ve got to ask about the Curb Your Enthusiasm finale, which you guested on. When Larry David first approached you with this idea, were you game right away?\n\nOh, sure, yeah. That just seemed like nothing but fun. And I just love hanging out with Larry. We always just laugh all day long.\n\nAnd you got the chance to tie a nice little bow onto the Seinfeld finale.\n\nYeah, I think connecting the two finales [was the way to go]. We were talking that day a lot about who has the best series finale episode. I personally favor the Mad Men one. I thought The Sopranos was great. Bob Newhart was great. And ours was not thought of as great. But I think now we’re in the conversation because we connected the two TV series 25 years apart. And to do that, you have to have two people playing themselves. I played myself in my show and he played himself in his show. And then you need 25 years separation. I think we’re in the conversation now for one of the better ones, when we used to be for one of the not-so-good ones.\n\nOne of my other favorite cameos you ever did was on 30 Rock, where they digitally inserted you into a ton of shows, and called it Seinfeldvision. With all the talk of AI, are there any shows that you wouldn’t mind being digitally inserted into?\n\nOh, I’d be okay with being in any show. As long as I don’t have to actually show up, you could do whatever you want. [Laughs].\n\nFinally, is there anything you haven’t gotten to do yet that you’d still love to do?\n\nI’ve gotten to do a lot of stuff. I would’ve said stand up on a surfboard, but I’ve done it a couple times. It was 20 years ago. But that’s my only regret—I never really learned how to surf. And I think that’s one of the most worthwhile things you could do in human life is surfboard. I don’t want to fly a plane. I’ve hang-glided, I’ve skydived, I’ve scuba dived. I’ve tried a lot of crazy things. The only one I really like is stand-up comedy. Stand-up comedy kind of replaced all those things for me because you get kind of that same feeling of excitement and risk. I like that combination.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity."
