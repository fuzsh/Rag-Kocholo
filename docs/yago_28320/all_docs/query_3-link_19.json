        "text": "Likening it to who could first set foot on the moon between the U.S. and Russia, it’s Kellogg’s vs. Post in a race for breakfast toaster pastry superiority. That’s the premise behind Jerry Seinfeld’s new Netflix movie which takes place in Battle Creek, Michigan, a place he’s joked that he’s never actually been to.\n\n“Unfrosted” is set to be released on Netflix on Friday, May 3rd and we are getting our first look at the movie as the first trailer dropped today. It stars Seinfeld, Melissa McCarthy, Jim Gaffigan, Amy Schumer, Hugh Grant, James Marsden, Max Greenfield and Christian Slater.\n\nIt started out as a comedy bit from Seinfeld’s 2020 Netflix special, “23 Hours to Kill,” where the comedian joked about his excitement of the invention of the Pop-Tart when he was a kid in the 1960s. The comedy bit evolved into a full movie script and eventually the comedy film, itself.\n\nRelated: Grand Rapids man, inventor of Pop-Tarts, dies at 96\n\n“I grew up on it because it’s the first thing you can make hot when you’re a kid. You know, you can make it and it’s like cooking, wow, there’s heat and I made it,” Seinfeld said on “Jimmy Fallon” last night. “I wanted to write the greatest Pop-Tarts bit so no other comedian would ever talk about Pop-Tarts. That was the goal.”\n\nSeinfeld says this movie won’t be like “Barbie,” because Kellogg’s had no part in making the film.\n\n“Is this like “Barbie?” Fallon asked? “No, not like “Barbie.” Because “Barbie” was made by Mattel. Kellogg’s did not even know we were doing this,” Seinfeld added. “We took all their products. We took all their characters. Snap, Crackle and Pop are in the movie. Tony The Tiger is in the movie. Toucan Sam. We took everything. I didn’t know we had to ask. There could be some serious legal exposure.”\n\n“If I were to be hauled into court on Pop-Tart charges, that would make my life.”\n\nSeinfeld says one of his favorite characters in the film is Thurl Ravenscroft, the voice of Tony The Tiger, played by Hugh Grant.\n\n“He’s very unhappy because the character is Thurl Ravenscroft, the real voice of Tony The Tiger. I imagined this guy as a frustrated Shakespearean actor who has to play this embarrassing character to make his car payments. Hugh Grant is perfect for that.”"
