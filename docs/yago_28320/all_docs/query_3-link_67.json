        "text": "Tickets Go On Sale Friday, August 11 at 10 a.m.\n\n(DETROIT – August 4, 2023) – 313 Presents and JS Touring announced that America’s premier comedian, Jerry Seinfeld, will perform his newest stand-up routine on the Fox Theatre stage on Saturday, October 28 at 7 p.m. Comerica Bank is the exclusive presenting partner of the Fox Theatre.\n\nTickets go on sale Friday, August 11 at 10 a.m. at 313Presents.com and Ticketmaster.com.\n\nSeinfeld has been hailed for his uncanny ability to joke about the little things in life that relate to audiences everywhere.\n\nJerry Seinfeld’s comedy career took off after his first appearance on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson in 1981. Eight years later, he teamed up with fellow comedian Larry David to create what was to become the most successful comedy series in the history of television: Seinfeld. The show ran on NBC for nine seasons, winning numerous Emmy, Golden Globe, and People’s Choice awards, and was named the greatest television show of all time in 2009 by TV Guide, and in 2012 was identified as the best sitcom ever in a 60 Minutes/Vanity Fair poll.\n\nHis latest Emmy nominated Netflix projects include Jerry Before Seinfeld and 23 Hours to Kill along with the highly acclaimed web series, Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.\n\nSeinfeld has also starred in, written, and produced movies (Comedian, Bee Movie), directed and produced a Broadway hit (Colin Quinn Long Story Short), and wrote three best-selling books (Is this Anything?, Seinlanguage, and The Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee Book) and a children’s book (Halloween). Seinfeld recently announced his upcoming film Unfrosted and continues to perform both nationally and internationally."
