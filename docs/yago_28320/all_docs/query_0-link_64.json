His own character is literally a bee version of huimself, making the same kind of observational humour that he does as a comedian. The animations are the same as all Dreamworks, and best of all it includes David Puddy, I mean, Patrick Warburton.\n\nIf you have any appreciation or liking for Seinfeld and his humour, the Bee Movie is a joy.\n\nLooking at the plot of the film we can try to find the distinct plot points at the end of Act I and Act II.\n\nThe first act concludes with the first major plot point after Jerry Seinfeld's character, Barry B. Benson, breaks the number one bee rule- he speaks to a human. While the very rule itself is hinted at a few times at the beginning, never is a human character actually introduced for the audience to consider it. About 20 minutes into the film, after the first introduction to humans, the main character is tempted to break the rule, does so, and spins the entire plot into a different direction.\n\nThe second act finishes towards the end of the film, after the resolution of what seemed to be the main issue (humans taking the honey of bees). Once humans are no longer able to do so, there is an excess of honey and the bees can no longer work. This comes about 60-70 minutes into the film. The analysis and resolution of this final issue is left to be handled in the final act of the film."
