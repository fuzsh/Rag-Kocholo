        "text": "It might be full of bees, but Bee Movie is an A-list flick. Kidzworld has the buzz on our five favorite characters from the upcoming film. Check it out!\n\nBee Movie Characters - Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld)\n\nBarry is a bee who isn't content to blend into his black-and-yellow world. A recent college graduate, Barry wants more out of life than the standard corporate gig at Honex making honey - for crying out loud, who wants a one-job career? Setting out on a journey of self-discovery, he eventually opts to think outside of the hive... literally. For the sharp-witted Barry, life isn't just about the honey. And sometimes, a bee's gotta do what a bee's gotta do.\n\nBee Movie Characters - Vanessa Bloome (Ren√©e Zellweger)\n\nNew York City florist Vanessa is a big hearted idealist with a quirky streak and a love of flowers. What better human companion to a bee than that? And this sweet bloom arranger is there for her little guy when things get tough... and especially when it comes time to save the world's flowers.\n\nBee Movie Characters - Adam Flayman (Matthew Broderick)\n\nBarry's best friend and confidante, Adam, is a company man (meaning Honex) all the way. He finds nothing wrong with following the party line and doing what bees have always done - make honey. After all, 27 million years of history can't be wrong.\n\nBee Movie Characters - Mooseblood (Chris Rock)\n\nBarry crosses paths with this rambling mosquito when they both run into a little environmental danger - windshield washer fluid - as the mosquito is hitching a ride on a truck and heading to Alaska for moose blood (don't knock it, it's amazing stuff). A loner with a flair for colorful expressions, Mooseblood shares his distinctive views on life before heading off up north for some big game hunting.\n\nBee Movie Characters - Layton T. Montgomery (John Goodman)\n\nThis high-powered southern attorney has never lost a case - to a human, that is. And losing to a bee? Unthinkable! But just to make sure, he'll use every dirty tactic in the book to discredit Barry and his unprecedented lawsuit.\n\nRelated Stories:"
