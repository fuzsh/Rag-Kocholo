        "text": "We used a variety of Panasonics to shoot the 2 minute clips currently being aired on NBC primetime with Jerry Seinfeld, promoting his Bee Movie.\n\nBefore I came on board, a number of clips had been shot with two DVX100b's outfitted with Century wide angles and onboard shotguns, in a run-and-gun doc style. The pieces were originally intended for the web only, but NBC decided to buy them to air during commercial breaks during prime time. When I was brought on I suggested we switch to the HVX200's so that the bits could be mastered in HD (unfortunately they are only airing in SD) with similar accessory packages.\n\nI arrived in NYC for a one-day shoot in and around the press junket for the movie, where we shot Jerry riffing with Matthew Broderick and Rene Zellweger. Although it had been explained to me that the M.O. was true run-and-gun with no lighting, the task of finding an appropriately lit section of the hotel where the junket was taking place was daunting, and we ended up in a service corridor where exposure was at least possible! For the subsequent LA shoot I was able to bring in a gaffer and small lighting package for at least a modest amount of control in this area, but we still had to work lightning-fast and be ready to change locations at the drop of a hat if Jerry wanted to restage a particular segment, which did indeed happen.\n\nWe also shot the intros and outros in a beautiful old building downtown that was dressed as a fancy office. For this section of the shoot we bumped up to two HDX-900's. As the director had requested a simultaneous wide and tight version to save time (and yet Jerry needed to make eye contact with the camera in both cases), I came up with an elaborate mirror gag similar to a 3D dual camera rig to facilitate this which worked out well.\n\nThe clips are called \"TV Juniors\" and can be seen sandwiched in various NBC shows for the next few weeks, also viewable at nbc.com/beemovie.\n\nHi guys, so sorry I haven't gotten back in here for a bit (no notification of responses...hmm, have to check that).\n\nHere is a link to a discussion with pictures of the mirror camera gag. It was unquestionably cumbersome, not something you would want to have to move from location to location, but it got the job done. It occurred to me that shooting on a large format camera (RED is the obvious one, but any of the 35mm-size sensor cameras like D20, Genesis, Dalsa would likely work as well) and simply shooting the wider size then extracting the tighter size later would work fine for SD delivery, but it would obviously take a fair amount of post time to fix the tracking (erasing whatever moves are present from the wide view then adding whatever is necessary to compose for the tighter). In this instance the post schedule was way too tight to allow this.\n\nIt was a fun shoot overall; for the doc-style bits we had to move really quickly at the various locations (mostly Dreamworks) and be ready to change things at the drop of a hat if Jerry wanted to restage a bit to a different spot. I kept the lighting minimal, a few kinos and an HMI Joker bug with chimera for most of it so we could work fast.\n\nRegarding the choice of shooting HD, the final delivery format (SD or HD) was unknown when we shot it, and it made the most sense to future-protect the footage by capturing in HD. It wasn't a huge budget but the difference between the HDX-900 and the SDX-900 for the wraparounds was minimal, and obviously with the HVX-200 it's just a matter of more storage space for the footage. It's pretty well documented that HD footage downconverted to SD usually has a slightly improved look compared to SD originated footage anyway, so it couldn't hurt.\n\nI have noticed that there is a substantial difference between the clips that were shot on the DVX100's and those on the HVX200's when they air on NBC, although it's a bit harder to tell online."
