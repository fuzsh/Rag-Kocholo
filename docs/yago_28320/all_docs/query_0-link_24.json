        "text": "Post by Return of the Thin Olive Duke on\n\nBee Movie\n\nDir. Simon J. Smith and Steve Hickner\n\nPremiered November 2, 2007\n\nBee Movie is exactly the kind of film you’d expect from Dreamworks at the tail end of its mission to make fun of Disney and particularly Michael Eisner. It’s exactly what you’d expect from a movie whose trailer contained no footage from the actual film. It’s exactly what you’d expect of a film where Jerry Seinfeld attempts to play an actual character. And it’s exactly what you’d expect from the kind of movie that got product placement on 30 Rock. Let’s talk about it.\n\nSeinfeld plays Barry Benson, a recently graduated bee looking to start his career in the honey business. Faced with the terrifying prospect of doing the same job forever, he goes outside the hive with the elite “pollen jocks” (led by Rip Torn) and ends up in the home of kindhearted florist Vanessa Bloome (Renée Zellweger), who saves his life. Barry then breaks bee law by thanking her, revealing that bees can talk. While Barry’s friendship with Vanessa alienates her highly allergic boyfriend Ken (Patrick Warburton), his discovery that humans have been enslaving bees to produce honey starts a lawsuit for the ages, with unexpected consequences of its own.\n\nBee Movie is weird; everything about it suggests that this went through many, many drafts, none of which were satisfactory as a whole. It’s not terrible, but it’s definitely not good. It varies from a re-hash of Dreamworks’ debut animated feature Antz, tries for consumerist satire, parodies courtroom drama with weird racial overtones, and then ends up as an environmental fable that inadvertently endorses slavery. It even gets a parting jab at Disney when Winnie the Pooh gets shot with a tranquilizer gun (meaning yes, Winnie the Pooh is a sentient being in the “real” world presented here).\n\nWhile the film has its share of veteran voice actors (notably Patrick Warburton as Ken and John Goodman as the defending attorney), it’s far from their best work, and the biggest celebrity voices are severely wanting. I have no idea why Jerry Seinfeld was picked to play Barry, but evidence suggests the film went through a lot of replacement cast members, and his contribution can’t have been the first. Renée Zellweger is the worst, however, awkwardly rushing through her lines in a manner reminiscent of Ewan McGregor’s uncharacteristically horrible performance in Robots.\n\nIn short, Bee Movie is a camel, a haphazardly constructed, endlessly retooled contractual obligation of a film. It’s heavy on plot but light on story, and has some decent jokes but never builds up to a coherent whole, and borrows so blatantly from other animated films as to be little more than a self-parody. The good news is that Bee Movie’s inability to turn a profit helped Dreamworks Animation turn the page toward more passionate, non-disposable work.\n\nSigns This Was Made in 2007\n\nAlmost all the dated cultural references take place in the courtroom segment. John Goodman’s attorney character accuses Barry of being on steroids, and researches by reading The Secret Life of Bees. Barry spouts puns about Halliburton and Enron, and references the Build-A-Bear Workshop.\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nThe movie has several jokes at the expense of Ray Liotta of all people. Considering Liotta’s other contribution to film in 2007, it’s well-deserved.\n\nThis is the only animated film I’m aware of that depicts my hometown of Pasadena– if briefly. It’s very weird.\n\nTime magazine accused the film of ripping off those Nasonex commercials. Because Time.\n\nAlso in Theaters\n\nAmerican Gangster and Bee Movie premiered November 2, 2007. The same weekend saw the debut of Martian Child, one of John Cusack’s star vehicles that probably looked good on paper.\n\nNext Time: Lions for Lambs\n\nPost by pairesta on\n\nBee Movie is weird; everything about it suggests that this went through many, many drafts, none of which were satisfactory as a whole. It’s not terrible, but it’s definitely not good. It varies from a re-hash of Dreamworks’ debut animated feature Antz, tries for consumerist satire, parodies courtroom drama with weird racial overtones, and then ends up as an environmental fable that inadvertently endorses slavery. It even gets a parting jab at Disney when Winnie the Pooh gets shot with a tranquilizer gun (meaning yes, Winnie the Pooh is a sentient being in the “real” world presented here).\n\nGod, this part so much. It's like four different movies crammed together. First part is a slightly edgier Pixar movie a la Antz, then it takes a turn when they discover what honey is used for by humans, then it becomes a FUCKING COURTROOM DRAMA, then finally this weird dystopian satire.\n\nMy daughter was briefly obsessed with this for a bit when she was younger, so it was on alot. My arc with the movie went from \"hey, this is kinda cute\" to \"what a cynical, half assed piece of shit\" in an alarmingly short period of time.\n\nI can just picture Seinfeld watching some awful kids movie with his kids, realizing that you can make bank by putting in minimal effort to some stupid kids movie, then rounding up his comedian friends and half-assing the final product. Then they put two media titans (Oprah and Larry King) in as cameos so they'll promote the shit out of it when it comes out. And then of course there were Seinfeld's own promo spots playing up being your good funny buddy with a dead-eyed desparation that screamed \"just give me your money already!\"\n\nPost by Return of the Thin Olive Duke on\n\nI have no idea why Jerry Seinfeld was picked to play Barry, but evidence suggests the film went through a lot of replacement cast members, and his contribution can’t have been the first.\n\nMaybe I'm dismembering, but wasn't the whole thing Seinfeld's idea? I kind of recall the story being that he decided the joke of \"B-movie = BEE movie\" was hilarious and they hung the whole project on that very slight hook. If memory serves there was also a fair amount of hoopla about this being the first time he'd agreed to do any kind of voice-work. I'm pretty sure his involvement was far from an afterthought.\n\nColor me surprised, because to my knowledge he'd never played any character besides some variation on himself. Say what you will about Woody Allen in Antz, but at least he has more of a persona than Seinfeld's \"easily annoyed\" shtick.\n\nSide note: I never made the Bee Movie/B-movie connection until Doug Walker pointed it out. It doesn't work because the film has nothing to do with b-movies."
