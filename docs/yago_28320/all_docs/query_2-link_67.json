One of the rules, of course, she is not allowed to trust the other bugs, especially the hornets, that live beyond a camp in the meadow. But cute sweet little Maya can't help but make friends with all kinds of other bugs, including a violin-playing grasshopper, a dung beetle and even a young hornet named Sting, who has a hatred of bees.\n\nVoice cast\n\n[edit]\n\nCoco Jack Gillies as Maya, a young bee girl.[7]\n\nKodi Smit-McPhee as Willy, a young bee boy, Maya's best friend.[8]\n\nJoel Franco as Sting, a young hornet, Maya and Willy's best friend and sidekick.\n\nRichard Roxburgh as Flip, a grasshopper.[8]\n\nJustine Clarke as Miss Cassandra, a teacher at the bee school and Maya's mother at heart.[8]\n\nJacki Weaver as Buzzlina Von Beena, the royal counselor of the beehive and Maya's arch-enemy.[8]\n\nAndy McPhee as Hank, the leader of hornets, Sting's father, Bees friends, and former arch-rivals.[8]\n\nMiriam Margolyes as The Queen, the mother of Bees.[8]\n\nDavid Collins as Arnie, an ant soldier, Paul's right-hand.[8]\n\nShane Dundas as Barney, an ant soldier, Arnie's partner and Paul's right-hand.[8]\n\nJimmy James Eaton as Paul, an ant colonel, the leader of ants.[8]\n\nHeather Mitchell as The Nurse, chief of the worker bees.[8]\n\nNoah Taylor as Crawley, the hilariously bumbling of the beehive, The Queen's loyal assistant and Buzzlina's former henchman.[8]\n\nCameron Ralph as Momo, a moth.[8]\n\nGlenn Fraser as Kurt, a dung beetle.[8]\n\nHeather Mitchell as Thekla, a stubborn spider.[8]\n\nStavroula Mountzouris as Lara, a ladybug who is Willy's love interest.[8]\n\nSam Haft as Drago, a dragonfly.[8]\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nAnimation World Network announced in May 2013 that Universum Film would distribute all German rights of the film.[9] The film is directed by Alexs Stadermann, and produced by Patrick Elmendorff and Thorsten Wegener from Studio 100 Animation in Munich; Jim Ballantine and Barbara Stephen from Buzz Studios in Sydney.[10][4] The film was produced in association with Flying Bark Productions and the channel ZDF.[11][12] This film was Coco Jack Gillies' film debut, voicing the role of Maya.
