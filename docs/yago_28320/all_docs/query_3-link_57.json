        "text": "It’s been said that the times that we’re happiest are when we forget about ourselves. For a couple of hours in the evening of October 7th, I didn’t have a care in the world. Seeing Jerry Seinfeld’s second performance in Boston was an experience I’d been yearning for.\n\nYou see, it was in April 2020 that I had planned to see Jerry at a venue called the Classic Center in Georgia.That event was canceled, along with everything else. You know why.\n\nBut I told myself that I’d see him someday and that put a little wind in my sails. We all need something to look forward to, and laughter is always a worthy destination.\n\nJerry Seinfeld Review: why does a certain comedian tickle you?\n\nJerry Seinfeld has been my comedy dealer since youth. My dad got me started with the sitcom. Jerry just spoke to my particular humor appetite. It was my gateway to the first book and the comedy specials. But why does a certain comedian really tickle you?\n\nGeorge Shapiro, the famed talent manager who represented Seinfeld for more than 30 years, described this to me in an interview we did: “A lot of times when you say you’re attracted to comedian, like when I saw Jerry Seinfeld, you know, for the first time, I call it falling in love with a comedian. It’s the closest thing to falling in love, because you’re so elevated. I said that with Jerry Seinfeld, I fell in love at first laugh.”\n\nThe Wang Theatre is some place\n\nTraipsing into the Wang Theatre, I realized that when you see an act in this venue, the show begins the moment you walk through the doors. I can’t recall a more ornate room in my life. The palatial Wang Theatre is nearing 100 years old. It would be remiss of me not to mention the exactitude of design and decoration. Looking around I couldn’t help but wonder if George Shapiro had ever accompanied Jerry to the Wang.\n\nAs the clock ticked closer to showtime, recorded music served as an interlude. The musical selections evoked the all-time great entertainers—Sinatra, big band instrumentals, Steve Tyrell and more Sinatra. The music fit with Seinfeld’s New York vibe.\n\nI’ve always respected and even been amused at how Jerry Seinfeld tries to steer clear of being schmaltzy. But if you’ve spent your life laughing with Jerry’s help, it’s hard not to feel a little tug at the heartstrings when you hear Sinatra sing “New York, New York” at a time like this. It seemed to foretell that it was showtime.\n\nIndeed.\n\nMark Schiff opened for Jerry Seinfeld\n\nThe opener came on-stage and had the audience in stitches within seconds. I’m glad I did some digging to find out his name: Mark Schiff. I pray that I get to see his set again. He’s one of the funniest comedians I’ve seen. Schiff introduced the headliner.\n\nIt’s Jerry time\n\nThen Jerry sprinted out. We were very lucky to have great seats, and seeing him up close was quite a thing. You see this guy on the tube and as the times change he goes with you, on the phone. On the flatscreen or whatever.\n\nHe could coast just a little bit, but Jerry Seinfeld doesn’t. After a brief greeting, he allowed the room to adjust to him being there and immediately went to work. Seeing him live, there’s no doubt how much he feeds off of the audience. It was an endless barrage of laughs. Like the opener, his material and delivery is so tight. I especially was in awe of how compact his bits are. There’s no waste.\n\nAlthough I entered the theatre feeling worn out, all of that dissipated as the jokes were delivered. I love greatness, and it’s thrilling to see someone at the top of their field delivering the goods. Jerry has a captivating force when he’s on stage. And before I knew it, the evening was coming to an end. The best comedians can make you lose your sense of time.\n\nA Pop-Tart film may be in your future\n\nBefore his departure, Jerry called for a little question and answer. Someone asked if he liked the “Seinfeld” finale. Jerry teased that he and Larry David are working on something related, but that we’d be finding out soon enough. Personally, I was more tuned in when he was talking about his forthcoming Netflix project “Unfrosted: The Pop-Tart Story.” That seems promising.\n\nAs the crowd spilled out into the street, there was an echo of laughter. I loved hearing people saying their favorite parts of the show. The “deer” bit was popular. Even though the show was over, there were lots of laughs, but also a touch of wonder. That one guy and a microphone can keep everyone’s constant attention. It’s something to see.\n\nMy wife was telling me how she forgot about “everything” during the performances. She had never seen stand up comedy in her life. You’ve never seen comedy and your first show is Jerry Seinfeld? I told her, “it’s like never going to the movie theatre in your life and the first movie you see is ‘The Godfather.’”\n\nJerry Seinfeld is always worth it\n\nThere are very few things in life that don’t eventually let you down. Usually when you follow a person’s career, you’ll observe ebb and flow—ups and downs. Jerry’s put out plenty through the years: the sitcom, the books, the comedy specials, “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee” and many years of live performances.\n\nAfter seeing him live in Boston, I’m happy to say he’s never let me down.\n\nSpecial thanks to Amy, Alexis and TMK."
