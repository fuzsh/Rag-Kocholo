On a chance opportunity to venture outside the hive, Barry's life changes forever when he meets a beautiful florist named Vanessa and discovers an appalling secret: humans have been stealing honey for themselves!\n\nThe Art of Bee Movie dips into the artistic pot of this hilarious film with more than 300 bee-autiful pieces of art, including sketches, pastels, digital paintings, and clay models. Delicious quotes from the artists, production designers, producers, and Jerry Seinfeld himself will tickle the funny bone and the imagination of all animation fans.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nJerry Beck is an American animation historian and author. He has written numerous books on animation and taught at UCLA and conducted seminars for the American Film Institute (AFI), New York University, and at the School of Visual Arts. He is also been an animation producer, an industry consultant to Warner Bros., and has been an executive with Nickelodeon and Disney."
