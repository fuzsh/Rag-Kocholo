Have an account? .\n\nNBC's \"Seinfeld\" followed the misadventures of friends living in New York.\n\nStars Jerry Seinfeld, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Jason Alexander have continued acting.\n\nRecurring actors like Bryan Cranston and Patrick Warburton found success on hit shows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJerry Seinfeld played the titular character.\n\nSeinfeld portrayed a semi-fictionalized version of his life as a stand-up comedian on the sitcom.\n\nPrior to that, he had a short-lived, recurring role as mail-delivery boy Frankie on the ABC sitcom \"Benson.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeinfeld remains a comedy legend.\n\nSeinfeld returned to New York and his stand-up comedy roots when the show ended in 1998. He chronicled his post-\"Seinfeld\" tour in the Emmy-nominated 1998 HBO comedy special \"I'm Telling You for the Last Time.\"\n\nHis next Hollywood project was the animated film \"Bee Movie\" (2007), which he wrote, produced, and did lead voice-acting for.\n\nIn 2012, he created the web series \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,\" which featured Seinfeld and high-profile guests like Dave Chappelle, Ellen DeGeneres, Jimmy Fallon, David Letterman, and President Barack Obama riding around in vintage cars before stopping to chat over coffee. The series became so popular that it was picked up by streaming giant Netflix.\n\nThe streamer also struck a deal with Seinfeld for two stand-up specials and the development of scripted and unscripted comedy programming. \"Jerry Before Seinfeld\" was released on September 19, 2017, and \"23 Hours to Kill\" — his first original stand-up special in 22 years — premiered on May 5, 2020.\n\nThe comedian still tours and most recently directed the Netflix movie \"Unfrosted,\" a comedy about the history of Pop-Tarts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Richards played Cosmo Kramer.\n\nThe stand-up comedian got his big break on Billy Crystal's cable television special.\n\nHe was a series regular on ABC's \"Fridays\" and had roles on NBC's \"Cheers.\"\n\nHe also appeared in films like \"So I Married an Axe Murderer\" (1993), \"Problem Child\" (1990), and \"Coneheads\" (1993).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichards ran into some trouble after \"Seinfeld.\"\n\nIn 2000, Richards went on to play the lead in the eponymous \"The Michael Richards Show\" on NBC, which was canceled shortly after its debut.\n\nHe returned to stand-up and famously found himself in hot water during a performance at the Laugh Factory comedy club in late 2006 for hurling racist epithets at a group of audience members. The incident was caught on video and led to a hiatus from stand-up.\n\nRichards appeared on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" from \"Seinfeld\" co-creator Larry David in 2009. The season-seven episode featured a reunion of the core \"Seinfeld\" cast for the first time since the finale.\n\nOther television stints included the role of Frank on the TV Land sitcom \"Kirstie\" and a gig on the 2019 romantic comedy \"Faith, Hope & Love.\"\n\nMost recently, he reunited with Seinfeld on his first red carpet in almost a decade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Alexander played Jerry's best friend George Costanza.\n\nBefore his role as Seinfeld's perpetually scheming best friend, Alexander nabbed notable roles as Phillip Stuckey in the film \"Pretty Woman\" (1990) and Hugo in the Disney-animated feature \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" (1996).\n\nHe also voiced the lead character in \"Duckman\" (1994) and won an Emmy for his guest appearance on \"Dream On.\"\n\nAlexander won a Tony and a Grammy for his work on \"Jerome Robbins' Broadway\" (1989).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlexander returned to his Broadway roots.\n\nAlexander didn't immediately find the same level of success after \"Seinfeld.\"\n\nHis first project after the show ended was the ABC sitcom \"Bob Patterson\" which only aired five episodes. He was also on the short-lived CBS sitcom \"Listen Up!\"\n\nOver the years he continued to make appearances on television with roles on episodes of NBC's \"Friends,\" UPN's \"Star Trek: Voyager,\" Fox's \"Malcolm in the Middle,\" USA Network's \"Monk,\" and CBS's \"Criminal Minds.\"\n\nHe returned to Broadway as the artistic director of Los Angeles' Reprise Theatre Company from 2007 to 2013.\n\nAlexander also appeared on live-stage shows including \"The Producers\" (2003) opposite Martin Short, \"A Christmas Carol\" (2004) with Kelsey Grammer, Broadway's \"Fish in the Dark\" (2015), and \"The Portuguese Kid\" (2017).\n\nUntil 2020, Alexander also voiced Sy Borgman on Warner Bro's animated television series \"Harley Quinn.\"\n\nSome of his recent work includes cameos on Amazon Prime's \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" as Asher Friedman and as Gene Lundy on CBS's \"Young Sheldon.\" He also still performs onstage, most recently starring in the comedy \"Judgement Day\" at Chicago Shakespeare Theater.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus played Jerry's ex-girlfriend Elaine Benes.\n\nPrior to winning audiences over for her portrayal of Seinfeld's ex-turned-buddy, Louis-Dreyfus spent three seasons as a cast member on NBC's iconic sketch-comedy series \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLouis-Dreyfus cemented her legacy as an A-list comedian.\n\nLouis-Dreyfus has convincingly broken what came to be known as the \"Seinfeld curse\" since the sitcom ended.\n\nShe took her talents to her own show, CBS's \"The New Adventures of Old Christine,\" where she won an Emmy.\n\nLouis-Dreyfus followed that up with HBO's \"Veep,\" where she played American Vice President Selina Meyer until the show ended in 2019. That role earned her a record-setting six consecutive Emmys.\n\nShe received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor — one of America's highest achievements in comedy — in 2018.\n\nShe also voiced characters in the animated films \"A Bug's Life\" (1998), \"Planes\" (2013), and \"Onward\" (2020).\n\nIn 2021, Louis-Dreyfus made her first appearance as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. She's now set to produce and star in \"Tangles,\" an animated movie based on a graphic novel about Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWayne Knight played Seinfeld's archnemesis, Newman.\n\nKnight is best known as Seinfeld and Kramer's meddling neighbor Newman.\n\nBut before this role, Knight had several memorable performances in films like \"Dirty Dancing\" (1987), \"Born on the Fourth of July\" (1989), \"JFK\" (1991), and \"Basic Instinct\" (1992).\n\nHe also worked as a private investigator in New York for five years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnight continues to act on television and voices animated characters.\n\nWhen \"Seinfeld\" ended its run, Knight continued his role as Officer Don Orville on NBC's \"3rd Rock from the Sun\" which he took up when the show premiered in 1996.\n\nHe also appeared on Broadway in \"Art\" (1999).\n\nKnight had several more television stints including guest spots on NBC's \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,\" CBS's \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,\" FX's \"Nip/Tuck,\" Fox's \"Bones,\" ABC's \"The Whole Truth,\" and Netflix's \"Narcos.\"\n\nHe starred as a recurring character on TV Land's \"Hot in Cleveland\" and as part of the main cast on TV Land's \"The Exes.\"\n\nHis most extensive work after \"Seinfeld\" has been voicing characters on animated shows like Fox Kids cartoon \"Toonsylvania,\" Disney's \"Buzz Lightyear of Star Command,\" the Kids' WB! series \"Xiaolin Showdown,\" the Nickelodeon cartoon \"Catscratch,\" and in iconic Disney films \"Hercules\" (1997), \"Toy Story 2\" (1999), and \"Tarzan\" (1999).\n\nMost recently, he appeared on the Prime series \"Them.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJerry Stiller played Frank Costanza.\n\nStiller gained a new following late in his career as George Costanza's long-suffering father and proponent of Festivus, an anti-Christmas celebration.\n\nBut his late-career resurgence came after years as one half of the comedy duo Stiller and Meara with his wife of over 60 years, Anne Meara.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStiller continued to find late-career success until his death in 2020.\n\nAfter \"Seinfeld,\" Stiller continued to find success as Arthur Spooner on the CBS comedy \"The King of Queens.\"\n\nHe also did some voiced characters in the animated films \"The Lion King 1½\" (2004) and \"Planes: Fire and Rescue\" (2014).\n\nStiller also teamed up with his son, Ben Stiller, in multiple films including \"Zoolander\" (2001), \"The Heartbreak Kid\" (2007), and \"Zoolander 2\" (2016).\n\nHis memoir \"Married to Laughter: A Love Story Featuring Anne Meara\" was published by Simon & Schuster in 2000.\n\nIn 2020, Ben Stiller confirmed in a post on X that his father died of natural causes at the age of 92.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEstelle Harris played George's shrill-voiced mom Estelle Costanza.\n\nHarris started her career later in life with the films \"Looking Up\" and \"Summerdog\" in 1977 and \"Once Upon a Time in America\" in 1984.\n\nShe also made appearances on NBC's \"Night Court\" and Fox's \"Married... with Children.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris continued her career in television and animation.\n\nHer list of voice-over credits is extensive.\n\nHarris provided the voice of Mrs. Potato Head in \"Toy Story 2\" (1999), \"Toy Story 3\" (2010), and \"Toy Story 4\" (2019).\n\nShe can also be heard as Mama Lipsky in \"Kim Possible,\" Thelma in \"The Proud Family,\" and Death's mother in \"Family Guy.\"\n\nShe had a recurring role on Disney Channel's \"The Suite Life of Zack and Cody\" and has made several guest appearances on television since \"Seinfeld\" wrapped.\n\nHarris died of natural causes in April 2022 — she was 93 years old.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn O'Hurley played J. Peterman.\n\nBefore playing the founder of the J. Peterman Company and Elaine's boss, O'Hurley had roles on multiple soap operas.\n\nThese roles included CBS then ABC's \"The Edge of Night,\" ABC's \"Loving,\" CBS's \"As the World Turns,\" CBS's \"The Young and the Restless,\" NBC's \"Santa Barbara,\" and ABC's \"General Hospital.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nO'Hurley appeared on several other shows.\n\nLike a few of his other former costars, O'Hurley did voice-over work after the show ended.\n\nHe voiced Roger Doofenshmirtz, Heinz Doofenshmirtz's brother, on the Disney Channel's \"Phineas and Ferb\" from 2008 to 2015.\n\nHe also had a recurring role as Dr. Christopher Neff on Lifetime's \"Devious Maids\" and preceded Steve Harvey as the host of \"Family Feud\" from 2006 to 2010.\n\nO'Hurley is also a musician who released a multi-album compilation of his original instrumental compositions called \"Peace of Our Minds\" in 2004.\n\nViewers might also be familiar with his appearance as a contestant on the first season of ABC's \"Dancing With the Stars.\" He lost to \"General Hospital\" star Kelly Monaco but was voted the winner by fans in a charity rematch months later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCranston's career took off after \"Seinfeld.\"\n\nHe landed the leading role of Hal Wilkerson on Fox's comedy \"Malcolm in the Middle,\" earning three Emmy nominations.\n\nTwo years after \"Malcolm in the Middle\" ended, Cranston found even more success as the terminally ill high-school chemistry teacher Walter White on AMC's \"Breaking Bad.\" He won multiple Emmys for it.\n\nCranston won critical acclaim on Broadway as well, winning Tony Awards for playing American President Lyndon B. Johnson in \"All the Way\" (2013) and Howard Beale in \"Network\" (2017).\n\nIn recent years, he starred on Showtime's \"Your Honor\" from 2020 to 2023 and appeared in movies like \"Asteroid City\" (2023) and \"Argylle\" (2024).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPatrick Warburton played Elaine's on-again, off-again boyfriend, David Puddy.\n\nWarburton made appearances on multiple television shows early on in his career including NBC's \"Quantum Leap,\" CBS's \"Northern Exposure,\" CBS's \"Murphy Brown,\" and NBC's \"Mad About You.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarburton is still an actor.\n\nHe continued to work steadily after \"Seinfeld.\"\n\nWarburton made a cameo as Agent T in the film \"Men in Black II\" (2002).
