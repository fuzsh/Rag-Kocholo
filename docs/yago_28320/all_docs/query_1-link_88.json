        "text": "Jerry Seinfeld has been in production on his upcoming film project Frosted, which will tell the story of the creation of Pop Tarts. The cast for the film was announced a couple of years ago, and Hugh Grant was among them.\n\nWe’ve now learned today that Grant will be taking on the role of cereal mascot Tony the Tiger, and you can see a first-look photo of him in the movie above. The man behind Tony the Tiger is described as “a disgruntled Shakespearean actor who, much to his chagrin, finds himself having to don the Tony the Tiger outfit.”\n\nDuring an interview with Empire, Seinfeld talked about the casting of Grant: “That was the greatest part of the whole thing, honestly. Because I am a crazy fan of his. [Hugh] asked me if it matters that Tony the Tiger has a British accent. I told him, ‘No, who cares?’”\n\nSeinfeld also commented on the rest of the cast saying, “Everybody I asked said ‘yes’, so we ended up with this crazy cast.”\n\nThe full cast for the film includes James Marsden (Sonic the Hedgehog 2), Melissa McCarthy (Ghostbusters), Jim Gaffigan (Linoleum), and Amy Schumer (Life & Beth). They wil be joined by Christian Slater (Dr. Death). Jack McBrayer (Hello, Jack! The Kindness Show), Tom Lennon (Reno 911!), Adrian Martinez (iGilbert), Bobby Moynihan (Saturday Night Live), Max Greenfield (The Neighborhood), and Sarah Cooper (Sarah Cooper: Everything’s Fine).\n\nSeinfeld is also set to star in the film, and he’ll be making his feature film directorial debut with it. The film is inspired by a joke that Seinfeld has told in his Netflix comedy special about the world-shaking invention of the Pop Tart, which rocked his world. He wrote the script with Spike Feresten.\n\nThe movie is billed as “a tale of ambition, betrayal, sugar and menacing milkmen.” The story set in 1963 Michigan and “will watch as sworn cereal rivals Kellogg’s and Post race to create a pastry that will change the face of breakfast forever.”\n\nI’m excited about this movie!"
