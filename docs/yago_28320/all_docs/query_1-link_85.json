        "text": "Jerry Seinfeld is making some statements about the movie industry as he makes his feature directorial debut in Netflix’s Unfrosted, the comedy about the creation of Pop-Tarts.\n\nIn a new interview, the stand-up comedian reflects on his experience in filmmaking at this point in his career.\n\n“It was totally new to me. I thought I had done some cool stuff, but it was nothing like the way these people work,” Seinfeld told GQ in an interview. “They’re so dead serious! They don’t have any idea that the movie business is over. They have no idea.”\n\nHe continued, “Film doesn’t occupy the pinnacle in the social, cultural hierarchy that it did for most of our lives. When a movie came out, if it was good, we all went to see it. We all discussed it. We quoted lines and scenes we liked. Now we’re walking through a fire hose of water, just trying to see.”\n\nWhen asked what replaced film, Seinfeld said, “Depression? Malaise? I would say confusion. Disorientation replaced the movie business. Everyone I know in show business, every day, is going, ‘What’s going on? How do you do this? What are we supposed to do now?'”\n\nAs for Seinfeld’s position in the industry, he said, “I’ve done enough stuff that I have my own thing, which is more valuable than it’s ever been. Stand-up is like you’re a cabinetmaker, and everybody needs a guy who’s good with wood.”\n\n“There’s trees everywhere, but to make a nice table, it’s not so easy. So, the metaphor is that if you have good craft and craftsmanship, you’re kind of impervious to the whims of the industry. Audiences are now flocking to stand-up because it’s something you can’t fake. It’s like platform diving. You could say you’re a platform diver, but in two seconds we can see if you are or you aren’t. That’s what people like about stand-up. They can trust it. Everything else is fake.”\n\nThe actor recently appeared in the Curb Your Enthusiasm finale with Larry David, who Seinfeld co-created the sitcom with, poking fun at the controversial Seinfeld finale."
