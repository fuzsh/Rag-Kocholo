        "text": "Copying and pasting the Bee Movie script is a niche internet meme that originated on Tumblr and quickly spread to Reddit, YouTube, Facebook, and other social media platforms.\n\nBy Shaurya Malwa\n\nMar 14, 2024 at 7:18 a.m. UTC\n\nEthereum’s Dencun upgrade has significantly reduced data fees, allowing developers to post the Bee Movie script on the blockchain at a much lower cost.\n\nThe new “blobs” feature is designed for layer 2 networks. It provides a cheap and temporary way to store data, lowering fees for layer 2 networks like Optimism and Base blockchain.\n\nEthereum developers are having some fun on the blockchain as a drop in data fees on the Ethereum network after the Dencun upgrade.\n\nDevelopers are posting the entire script of the Bee Movie, an animated comedy by legendary comedian Jerry Seinfeld about a bee who sues humans, on the Ethereum blockchain for cheap following the Dencun upgrade.\n\n“I didn’t get the first blob, but as far as I can tell, I DID get the first BEE MOVIE on mainnet,” posted Paradigm developer Dan Cline on Wednesday, shortly after the new blobs feature went live. The transaction cost only about $14.\n\nShortly afterward, another developer posted the script for just $5 as fees fell further. Copying and pasting the Bee Movie script is a niche internet meme that originated on Tumblr and quickly spread to Reddit, YouTube, Facebook, and other social media platforms.\n\nIn March 2023, a developer posted the script on the Bitcoin blockchain for the first time after Ordinals technology, a way to post text data on Bitcoin, went live.\n\nBlobs are a cheap way to temporarily carry data about transactions that are now possible after Wednesday’s upgrade. Uploaded data exists on the network for about eighteen days, after which it is permanently removed.\n\nThese blobs are designed primarily for layer 2 networks that run atop Ethereum as an alternative to data storage within Ethereum blocks.\n\nAnd it’s working well so far. Data from L2Fees shows that fees on layer 2 network Optimism were less than a cent as of Thursday morning, much lower than their usual levels. Elsewhere, Base blockchain developers are reporting a 99.8% drop—with fees at $0.0005 instead of $0.31.\n\nEdited by Parikshit Mishra.\n\nDisclosure\n\nPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated .\n\nCoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.
