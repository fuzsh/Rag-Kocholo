        "text": "In the vibrant city of Chicago, where diversity and creativity intersect, the Renegades of Funk Chicago stand tall like Logan Square’s Monument iconic beacon, home to their notable Battle for the Eagle event. Committed to preserving, learning, and teaching the five elements of hip-hop culture, this nonprofit organization works to ensure that future generations have the opportunity to experience and celebrate the rich history of hip-hop.\n\nThis year, Renegades of Funk (ROF) are set to bring the fire to the 2023 Fiestas Patronales Puertorriqueñas, as they host programming for the Cultural Stage. We met a few ROF crew members at the Humboldt Park Boathouse to learn what they’re planning for this year’s Puerto Rican Festival.\n\nFirst to arrive is Cari da RAGE, who radiates the energy of a dancer. She sits beside me to wait for the others. She begins telling me about her 20-year dance teaching career, and how it brought her to where she is now, a teacher at The Joy Room in Old Irving Park.\n\nCari’s dance career began at an early age, where her love of dance would ultimately inspire her stage name, Cari da RAGE. At twelve years young, Cari enrolled in an adult hip-hop class, where she met her mentor Daniel “BRAVEMONK” Haywood, who immediately recognized the ability Cari has to set the floor on fire. “There was this freestyle at the end of class and at the end, BRAVEMONK screamed ‘’Damn, you just raged!’ and the name stuck.”\n\nAnd so did their partnership. “I just called him this week actually. I was trying to remember when we previously performed at the Puerto Rican Festival. He remembered it was in 2012 when we performed with Pinqy Ring and Calle 13,” said Cari.\n\n“Cari would bring her kids to dance in front of our graffiti walls and we thought it was so cool,” said founding ROF member BBoyB. “We want to share that energy with everyone.”\n\nWhich is why at this year’s festival, Cari will be performing with her students from Graffiti Rhythms Dance & Fitness alongside a special surprise guest. “The best part of the scene is teaching kids. The kids and the music give me all the energy I need.”\n\nAs we are chatting, we are joined by Roldare Nation, a legendary Chicago promoter who has been organizing and hosting events since 1992. He’s an educator at Steinmetz College Prep, where a colleague inspired his stage name after he mentioned how all the high school kids would follow him around, like a nation. Roldare Nation has an extensive history in the music scene, having brought in artists such as Nas, Common, and Wu-Tang Clan. He has also hosted events at venues such as Congress Theater, Alcatrazz, and Alternatives, but that was only the beginning. He soon started attending street-dance battles and using his skills to organize his own.\n\nRoldare Nation demonstrates how cultivating these kinds of spaces invites the community to collaborate, showcase their skills, and engage. By using their voices, their artwork can inspire, change, and uplift the culture.\n\nFrom the ‘80s to present time, Chicago has been a breeding ground for some of the most incredible breakdancers in the world, undoubtedly true hip-hoppers. Fueled by undeniable energy, breakdancing, also known as b-boying or breaking, has become a defining element of Chicago's urban culture. Breakers showcase a dynamic blend of athleticism, creativity, and self-expression, captivating audiences with their intricate footwork, acrobatic moves, and signature style. Rooted in the streets, walls, and spirit of Chicago are the legendary dance crews and battles that have been taking place for decades, mainly in the underground scene.\n\nA scene that co-founding ROF member, BreakerRay, is committed to keeping vibrant. Arriving last at the Boathouse, BreakerRay, from Comerío, Puerto Rico, who is an original Brickheadz crew member, started hosting underground parties where breakdancers could battle and become better dancers.\n\nNow, BreakerRay will be bringing the underground to the Cultural Stage. “The best part of the [Puerto Rican] Festival experience is when the community is at peace with each other. Just listening to the melodies of the artists on stage motivates me to one day be on stage representing something positive for my friends, family, and Puerto Rican community.”\n\nChicago's breakdancing scene has not only nurtured exceptional talent but has also fostered a community and camaraderie among dancers. Its influence has transcended beyond New York City, inspiring aspiring breakers worldwide and contributing significantly to the global expansion of hip-hop culture. From electrifying battles to impactful performances, Chicago's breakdancing scene continues to evolve, pushing artistic boundaries and affirming its status as a vital force within the broader hip-hop movement.\n\nWith dreams to one day run an international street style and breaking battle, Roldare Nation is happy to continue his legacy of bringing his recognizable Wrestlemania-like energy to the Puerto Rican Cultural Stage.\n\n“I am so excited. To be able to say, ‘hey I’m doing the PR Fest, come through,’ that means a lot to me because it’s a historic fest. Even through all the gang wars, the gentrification, people are still standing tall, still coming out. I’m doing my part to try and preserve that culture, the street essence, and that we do have a history in the park. I take it all on as a challenge and I feel it’s my responsibility to do it right to keep it going,” said Roldare Nation.\n\nDon’t miss BreakerRay, Roldare Nation, and more members from Renegades of Funk, as they host Battle con Gandules, DJ sets, and live art performances on Saturday, June 10th starting at 5pm.\n\nJoin Cari and her dance kids as they kick off the party for the Puerto Rican Festival on Community Day, Thursday, June 8th at 6pm."
