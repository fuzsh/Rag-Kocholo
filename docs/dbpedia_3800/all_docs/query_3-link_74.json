        "text": "DANCE BREAK MIM so-when Public Enemy used the words They reminded us young Black men are People first, not criminals just because of phenotype or dress. Don’t Believe The Hype was a messsge to non law enforcement folks being fed lies about the \"hard core maniac\" Black kids, kids marginalized, kids seeking connection. The message was for Black kids- you are NOT what they say you are And For white supremacy believers. A form of “we see you.” Now, I think it’s about the GOP Lies. Watch and see how they begin to backpedal overtly- Oh no, OUR candidate LOVES women. To use To abuse To dominate and control To Salivate over( think Homer). No matter what Rs say about how the “leaders” like girls? Don’t believe the hype. Rs who do love women and girls as fully autonomous Hu, formed as planned, won’t vote R this round. #truth\n\nI want your support, and assistance in the following areas: 1. Racism is not compatible with both Christianity and Islam; I can’t be hustled with for my everything. 2. Controlling my sexuality, productivity, time usage, properties, finance, talents, money, and so on are both illegal and unconstitutional. If technology seduces me to females, and erects my private part for more than 30 minutes, and yet I deprived the right to enjoy my life, it’s slavery. I want support in getting back my freedom and properties. 3. I don’t like to erode the social capital and tolerance of the society, but I have never, and will never ever consent to slavery, persecutions, conspiracies against rights, human experimentations, robbery, and so on. I strongly request your involvement in ending 32 years of hustles via dialogue with Chrisitan leaders, and Muslim leaders. I am not an irresponsible person to blame Christians for 32 years of persecutions and conspiracies without facts, if I lie you will find out. I want Christians to tell this hard truth. 4. Exercising constitutional and statutory rights, seeking solutions from public leaders, diplomacy, outreaches, tolerance, government agencies, and hard works must be alternatives to terrorist acts, violence, criminals’ acts, and so on.\n\n\"...descendants of captive Africans held in the U.

It is these peoples, who in the past were referred to and identified collectively as the Colored, Mullatoes, Creole peoples, Negro, Black, and Afro-American and who now generally consider themselves African Americans. Their history is very, very rich with ingenuity, innovation, intelligence, courage, faith, perseverance, tolerance, unrelenting and most raw will, constant and multiple struggles and triumph after triumph under the most adverse conditions for the lengthiest time period ever forced upon human beings throughout the history of all of “man”. Their history should be celebrated by all and for all time for it is the very essence of resiliency and the definition of an unbreakable spirit.\" A. A. Bomani https://lnkd.in/gUu-thzA"
