        "text": "Earlier tonight, Rage Against The Machine drummer Brad Wilk announced that the band is breaking up. “I know a lot of people are waiting for us to announce new dates for all the canceled RATM shows,” he posted to Instagram. “I don’t want to string people or myself along any further. So while there has been some communication that this may be happening in the future…I want to let you know that RATM (Tim, Zack, Tom and I) will not be touring or playing live again. I’m sorry for those of you who have been waiting for this to happen. I really wish it was…”\n\nIn the comments, Wilk wrote, “Bottom of my heart… Thank you to every person who has ever supported us.”\n\nRage Against The Machine — Wilk, frontman Zack de la Rocha, guitarist Tom Morello and bassist Tim Commerford — reunited in 2022 for a North American and European tour, which was originally scheduled for spring/summer 2020. Zack de la Rocha injured his Achilles tendon at the second stop of the tour. He performed the remaining dates by sitting on a road case. They then canceled their European shows. Then, they canceled the remaining North American dates.\n\nZack’s return to the stage\n\nOn October 12, 2023, de la Rocha joined hip-hop group Run The Jewels on stage in Los Angeles. This gave fans hope that he might be able to perform again with Rage. But as Tom Morello noted at the band's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in November, “Like most bands, we have differing perspectives on a lot of things, including about being inducted into the Rock Hall.” Morello was the only member to appear at the event.\n\nAs Morello said during his speech, “Don’t wait for us: Rage is not here, but you are. The job we set out to do is not over. Now, you’re the ones that must testify!” And, possibly foreshadowing the band’s end, he added, “If you’re bummed out that you didn’t get to see Rage Against The Machine, then form your own band and let’s hear what you have to say.”\n\nThe band has not issued an official statement at press time.\n\nRage Against The Machine: Top 20 Songs Ranked\n\nRage Against the Machine announcing a reunion tour was easily one of the best surprises in the rock world in recent years.\n\nOf course, those tour plans had to be pushed back, and sadly, partially canceled due to an injury sustained by Zack de le Rocha. However, that doesn’t mean still can’t celebrate the incredible catalog of this dynamic band, and what better time than now to do so?\n\nHere is Rage Against the Machine’s top 20 songs ranked.\n\nBrian has been working in pop culture and media for about three decades: he’s worked at MTV, VH1, SiriusXM, CBS and Loudwire. Besides working as a writer and an editor-in-chief, he’s also appeared on air as a pundit, guested on radio shows and hosted podcasts. Over the years, he’s interviewed the surviving members of Led Zeppelin, the members of U2, Beyonce, Pink, Usher, Stevie Nicks, Lorde… and is grateful to have had the chance to interview Joe Strummer of the Clash and Tom Petty."
