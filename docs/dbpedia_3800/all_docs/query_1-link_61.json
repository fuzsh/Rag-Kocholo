        "text": "Less than two months after being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, it seems that Rage Against The Machine has once again disbanded. Drummer Brad Wilk posted a message on Instagram thanking fans and “every person who has ever supported us.”\n\n“I know a lot of people are waiting for us to announce new tour dates for all the canceled RATM shows,” he wrote. “I don’t want to string people or myself along any further. While there has been some communication that this may be happening in the future… I want to let you know that RATM (Tim, Zack, Tom and I) will not be touring or playing live again. I’m sorry for those of you who have been waiting for this to happen. I really wish it was…”\n\nThe group, anchored by bass heavyweight Tim Commerford, was formed in 1991 and is known for hits like “Killing in the Name,” “Bulls on Parade,” and “Renegades of Funk,” as well as their political activism. The band split up in 2000 and again in 2011. They reunited once again just before the pandemic and waited until 2022 to launch their first shows in 11 years. The remainder of their North American and European tour was canceled after singer Zack de la Rocha tore his Achilles tendon.\n\nAn official statement from the band has not been released, and a cause for the split seems unclear. De la Rocha’s leg injury may have something to do with it, although there has always been turmoil in the group. Another possible factor is Commerford’s health; he announced he was battling prostate cancer in 2022 and received treatment two months before going on tour. He continues to be active with his band 7D7D, which recently released a new single.\n\nWe’ll keep you updated with details as they become available."
