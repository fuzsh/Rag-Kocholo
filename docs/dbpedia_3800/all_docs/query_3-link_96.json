Hmm… I have enough silver I just needed a spot long enough, and this spot fit the bill perfectly for that. I also didn’t want to be spending too much time in this spot so I enlisted the help of my homie Werk VFW to blast in the fill with a fat cap and and the 3D while I did the outline and detail work. We were done in about two hours. Not to bad for a couple of old salts. This piece was freestyled off the head with the backwards lower case e to pay respects to the year of 1988.\n\nA little background on the Renegades thing. I was a prez of the VCR Crew back in 88/89 with most of the members later to be absorbed into the TMK crew, and we called ourselves the VC Renegades, and I was also a member of the San Diego BBoy Crew Renegades of Funk who later became the SD chapter of RSC . So the Renegade thing has always has a special place in my hip hop heart and history..Thanks for stopping by. Hint: CLICK PICS TO VIEW LARGE"
