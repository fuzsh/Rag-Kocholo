He sang it to her at their wedding ceremony in Como, Italy.\n\nZoot Suit RiotCherry Poppin' Daddies\n\n\"Zoot Suit Riot\" isn't just a Cherry Poppin' Daddies song - they were real riots in Los Angeles in 1943 that inspired the lyrics.\n\nLivin' La Vida LocaRicky Martin\n\n\"Livin' La Vida Loca\" is a Latin pop landmark, but \"la vida loca\" are the only Spanish words in the lyric - \"mocha\" is English.\n\nCome DancingThe Kinks\n\n\"Come Dancing\" by The Kinks was inspired by the older sister of Ray Davies, who would make guys take her out dancing and spend their money on her, only to send them home frustrated with just a peck on the cheek.\n\nGuy ClarkSongwriter Interviews\n\nVince Gill, Emmylou Harris and Lyle Lovett are just a few of the artists who have looked to Clark for insightful, intelligent songs.\n\nMichael SchenkerSongwriter Interviews\n\nThe Scorpions and UFO guitarist is also a very prolific songwriter - he explains how he writes with his various groups, and why he was so keen to get out of Germany and into England."
