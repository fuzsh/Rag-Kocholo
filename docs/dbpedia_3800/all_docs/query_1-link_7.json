        "text": "On December 5th 2000, \"Rage Against The Machine\" released their last studio album to this day, almost two months after the band's official and first breakup.\n\nThe album is a homage to artists who influenced the band members and had a significant role in music history in the eyes of the Rage Quartet.\n\nThis is Rage's only album to not be accompanied by a supporting tour. Shortly after the release of the album, three of the four band members (minus vocalist Zack de la Rocha) formed a new band, \"Audioslave\", with Chris Cornell. RATM did, however, release the live album \"Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium\" in 2003, consisting of their final two concerts before their initial break-up.\n\n(Photo: Rage Against The Machine)\n\nThe album's cover art is a parody of the pop artwork \"LOVE\" by Robert Indiana, with the word \"love\" replaced with \"rage\" and the letter G at the bottom left corner slanted (in the original sculpture, the slanted letter O is at the top right corner). The album's packaging also includes a poem by Josh Koppel. On the back of the album's cover, there is an artwork with a photograph of an American one-dollar bill with the message \"You are not a slave\" written on the back.\n\nThe album achieved platinum status a little over a month after its initial release.\n\nThere is no doubt that each and every song in the album was adapted to the Rage style and it sounds like an original Rage album!!\n\nThe album contains 12 cover songs as below:\n\n1. \"Microphone Fiend\" - Eric B. & Rakim (1988)\n\n2. \"Pistol Grip Pump\" - Volume 10 (1994)\n\n3. \"Kick Out the Jams\" - MC5 (1969)\n\n4. \"Renegades of Funk\" - Afrika Bambaataa (1983)\n\n5. \"Beautiful World\" - Devo (1981)\n\n6. \"I'm Housin\" - EPMD (1988)\n\n7. \"In My Eyes\" - Minor Threat (1981)\n\n8. \"How I Could Just Kill a Man\" - Cypress Hill (1991)\n\n9. \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\" - Bruce Springsteen (1995)\n\n10. \"Down on the Street\" - The Stooges (1970)\n\n11. \"Street Fighting Man\" - The Rolling Stones (1968)\n\n12. \"Maggie's Farm\" - Bob Dylan (1965)\n\nListen to the album on: Spotify, Apple Music"
