        "text": "George Clinton\n\nJanuary 15, 2018\n\nI am George Clinton, Dr. Funkenstein, leader of Parliament & Funkadelic, Godfather of funk, and the DNA of hip-hop and rap. AMA.\n\nGeorge Clinton will be answering your questions here on January 15 from 2pm - 4:00pm EST.\n\nFRESH new single: I'm Gon Make You Sick O'Me feat. Scarface\n\nLINK to hear new single: https://distrokid.com/parliament\n\nMore about George: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clinton_(musician) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament-Funkadelic\n\n*George has a Redditor on his team. He'll be talking, and she'll be typing!\n\nPROOF:https://imgur.com/a/P2dsr\n\nPROOF: https://twitter.com/george_clinton/status/951138347723849729\n\nEDIT: Thanks so much everyone. George had a great time reading and answering your questions. Hope you enjoyed this as much as we did!\n\nEDIT: Added an improved link to the new single\n\nDid you ever figure out why you must chase the cat?\n\nPussy.\n\nDo you think that funk is making a sizable comeback?\n\nEDIT: THE FUNK NEVER LEFT\n\nI always thought I was the big dog\n\nGood Dr. Funkenstein, how do young performers bring back the funk to modern music? Also, are you a fan of Thundercat?\n\nDamn you answered your own question. Thundercat Flying Lotus and all that shit.\n\nHave you ever seen Flying Lotus at a grocery store??\n\nYes in the film Kuso\n\nThank you for Maggotbrain?\n\nThe questionmark is because this mod motherfucker is a motherfucker?\n\nI agree\n\nGeorge, are you aware of the show \"Mighty Boosh\" and the episode entitled 'Legend of Old Gregg'? This episode references an experience you may or may not have had. Care to comment?\n\nJuly 2nd, 1979 ring any bells?\n\nEdit: video reference https://youtu.be/38IFCiqc6LQ\n\nEdit 2.0: fixed spelling\n\nEdit 3.0:\n\nNoel Fielding's reaction https://twitter.com/noelfielding11/status/953027921228201984\n\nGeorge's reaction on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/p/Bd-zRHXAM5s/\n\nI'm mad because I didn't do this shit. I like it.\n\n(*I just showed him the video and he's laughing!)\n\n[removed]\n\nEverybody on the set was fucked up. Toronto had the best weed around. Fuck the beer.\n\nWhat was it like on the set of Kuso?\n\nIs it true that you told Eddie Hazel to play one half of Maggot Brain like his momma died, and the other half like he found out his momma was still alive? Some of my friends say this backstory is a myth, but i'm not so sure.\n\nBeautifully gross and nasty. Plus there was a hole in my ass bigger than the hole in my ass. And the story about Maggot Brian is half true. I told Eddit to play it like he found out his momma died. That's it.\n\nWhich song has your favorite bass line?\n\nI'm Gon Make You Sick O'Me (f. Scarface) has my favorite bass line. Junie Morrison (RIP) on bass and is co-producer of the new track. It's available today!\n\nThanks for doing this, George. It's great to have a chance to interact with such an iconic figure in music. I'm a huge fan of your work and had the privilege of seeing you and the gang in Melbourne, Australia last year.\n\nWhy did you decide to revive the Parliament name for this new album? (the single sounds great btw, very excited to hear the album)\n\nCan you tell us more about the conception of Funkadelic's second album? How much of it was conceived of and recorded under the influence of LSD?\n\nWhich artists have you enjoyed collaborating with the most and who would you like to work with in the future?\n\nWhen was the last time you took acid and how do you think it helped to shape and influence your music?\n\nLastly, which planet is the Mothership heading to next and how can I get a ticket?\n\nPeace and love, stay funky!\n\nWhat's the drug of choice for a king of funk?\n\nTell me about your experience with Ice Cube recording \"Bop Gun (One Nation)\". What were your initial thoughts when you were approached? And how great is his writing on that track, right?\n\nâGive me some insight on how the drug culture of P-Funk's time played a role in your creative process. Was the collective mythology the product of your minds on acid and coke? Y'all smoked weed, right?\n\nWhat are your underrated favorites from your decades with P-Funk? \"Wizard of Finance\" is a masterpiece. And I rarely see people acknowledge how fantastic Clones of Dr. Funkenstein was.\n\nYou're a hero, George. You have a young generation of fans.\n\nThis world has gone to shit. Can you take me to your home planet?\n\nI got that doo-doo, you know that\n\nMr. Clinton, today is also Martin Luther King Jr day. Do you have any special messages to share, for his remembrance?\n\nJust like we said in the 60s, peace and love, and remember what Martin Luther King is about.\n\nWhat music do you enjoy listening to currently?\n\nFlying Lotus, Cardi B, Kendrick Lamar, Jay Z's new album, Tra'Zae, and all that shit coming out of Atlanta. All that trap shit. I'm trapped in it. Medicaid Fraud Dog, that's on my mind right now.\n\nOh my god, man, what you and your band mates have done is some amazing music. Changed my idea of what was possible musically. Thank you so much for all those years of work. How the hell did you come up with such awesome, unique sounds? Who are your influences?\n\nI hope you don't mind the comparison, but learning about you blew my mind in the same way as first learning about Screamin' Jay.\n\nI also heard some chick wouldn't fuck you cuz you were wearing a diaper, is that true?\n\nI like Screamin' Jay Hawkins. I put a spell on you. Don't know how I'd fuck with a diaper on. Take it off. It's weird fucking with a diaper on!\n\nGeorge, what planet are you from?\n\nThe planet Sirius better known as the Dogstar. Sirius A and sometimes known as Sirius B.\n\nThank you Mr. Clinton. Is there anything you remember about producing for the Red Hot Chili Peppers?\n\nI remember the socks they were wearing were too big. I had to buy them some snuffleupagus jock straps.\n\nWhat inspired the long soliloquy on \"Good Thoughts, Bad Thoughts?\"\n\nI read it somewhere, I don't know where. I didn't go to school or nothing to know all that shit. I read it in a magazine. It was a good thought and I put it in pfunk terminology.\n\nYou recently said you won a legal victory giving you the rights back to the four Warner Bros. era Funkadelic records?\n\nAny further updates?\n\nWill you be doing your own reissues of these albums?\n\nYes\n\nThank you for your amazing contribution to music.\n\nHow did the George Clinton Family Series albums come about? Some of my favorite work you've done is on those records.\n\nThey were leftover tunes from the sessions from Flash Light, We Want the Funk, and all the other hits that were not used on the albums back then. And I got a lot more!\n\nDid Snoop Dog steal your songs, or did he have permission to sample them?\n\nHe had permission. Dr. Dre called me in. We got together. I did a lot of my parts live on both his and Tupac's record in the studio with them. I have no problem with any of the artists that sampled.\n\nWhat's is your current relationship with John Frusciante and how did you find working with the Chili Peppers?\n\nHe did Gangsters of Love with me. He went back and got Chili Peppers with Kim Manning. We did an old R&B Song \"Come on Baby Let the Good Times Roll\". Chili Peppers are my boys. I can't say enough about them Flea, Anthony, John, Chad\n\nDo you have anything to say about Sun Ra and his arkestra?\n\nHe was one of my neighbors in outer space. Him and Jimi Hendrix. They lived in some cosmic projects not far from me.\n\nWhat do you think about Rage Against The Machine's cover of \"Renegades of Funk\"?\n\nRage Against the Machine is definitely a rock band that can play hip hop on instruments live. So when they are funky they sound like Super Stupid, that era of Funkadelic. They bad.\n\nHUGE fan here - saw you three times already and looking forward to your show in San Luis Obispo later this spring.\n\nQUESTION: in the 90âs it seemed like you had toured with a musician alternate for each member of your group. You were known for performing for up to three straight hours. My question is: was this to be able to play lengthy sets or was it primarily so musicians could party - like if they got too high they could be swapped out for a more sober musician?\n\nTHANK YOU for keeping our society Funkadelic and inspiring so many of us musicians and funksters!!!!!!\n\nNah it wasn't that. It was so a lot of people could get a paycheck. It happened every once in a while when someone was high. It was mainly to get a check. The show was so long, sometimes you'd need two drummers to carry it on.\n\nI've had the pleasure of seeing you at my first show ever at the 1994 Lollapalooza and twice at Woodstock 1999. Thank you for the amazing memories!\n\nIn all of the decades you've rocked, do you have a favorite venue?\n\nMy favorite venue is any place with a stage. No particular place. No particular city. Any place I can plug in and get down. It kinda helps if marijuana is legal there, it makes a difference.\n\nWe love you Dr Funkenstein, your funk is the best!\n\nQuestion: other than keeping a strong emphasis on the 1 count of a beat, whatâs the best advice for someone trying to maximize their groove?\n\nStay in the pocket. Even if you know a lot of shit, dumb down a little bit. Funk will take care of itself. It will lead you to where you want to go. If I'm going to OD, that's what I want to OD on, The Funk. I don't think there's every been a situation with too much funk. It don't mean don't wash your hands now. We're talking about music.\n\nIâm sure youâve answere this before, but whatâs your stance on sampling? Does it still provide good mailbox money to this day? Do you think that reform is necessary to create a reasonable market for samples vs the arbitrary nature of licensing samples today? Finally do you consider a composition derived entirely of samples to be as creative as some of your best work?(or any of you original work for that matter)\n\nYou have to work your ass off to make that shit work. Public Enemy was a good arranger with samples. I've seen people do shit with our songs that's very intricate. The stuff Childish Gambino did with I'd Rather Be With You, he's killing it.\n\nWhat's the craziest thing you have seen at a performance? Please be as detailed as possible\n\nNorman, Oklahoma. 1978. A girl came up on the stage in overalls. Dropped her pants to her ankles. Turned around. Put a joint up her butt. And blew three smoke rings. We couldn't finish the show because we couldn't stop laugh. We tried 3 or 4 times to continue. Even took a break and we couldn't stop laughing.\n\nIn what ways has funk surprised you over the years?\n\nIt don't surprise me but I see the surprised look on people's face when the see the funk coming back 40 years 50 years 60 years. It doesn't go away. Funk is forever coming.\n\ndo you have a favorite producer you've been listening to recently?\n\nPharrell is a PHENOMENAL producer, one of the best around. And he's been around a while. He picked up with Terry Riley and kept going.\n\nHow many times now has Mother Earth been pregnant? Still 3?\n\nYep still 3\n\nYou're my hero man. How did you meet Bernie Worrell? Peace!\n\nAt a barber shop in Plainfield NJ. He was still in high school and played with us in our doo wop band. My favorite musician in all the world. Always has been.\n\nAny plans to repress One Nation Under A Groove?\n\nAlready in the works\n\nHuge fan. Thank you for your work.\n\nWho would you say are your largest musical influences? What artists should someone start with if they were trying to explore the genre of funk?\n\nSmokey Robinson is definitely the first. Sly Stone and The Beatles. Jimi Hendrix. I could say a lot more, but that would be a well rounded look at all the stuff I learned to do.\n\nBest albums to listen to with a woman?\n\nBootsy Collins, Michael Franks, Eddie Kendricks, Al Green\n\nDo you hate it when fans wear your shirts to your shows, thinking to yourself in Jeremy Pivens' voice, \"C'mon, don't be THAT guy\"?\n\nI used to feel like that, but now that branding is the concept I changed my mind on that. I wouldn't wear them before, but it's cool now.\n\nDo you eat breakfast? What do you eat?\n\nBacon & Grits when I'm home\n\nCan you explain the âdooloopâ part of âPsychoalphadiscobetabioaquadooloopâ?\n\nFollow up question: How does Sir Nose feel about water these days?\n\nDooloop is that looping of the concept around and around jumping in and out of water. You can't swim but you do it again over and over again. Sir Nose don't have no sense in his brain. Its snot logical. The membrains in your nose don't have any sense. So he keeps jumping in the water not realizing that he can't swim til he's in there.\n\nWhat is the thing you need most to find the funk?\n\nA good funk band\n\nDo you wipe with your left or right hand?\n\nLet me smell my finger\n\nAre you still living in Detroit? If so, what do you think of the recent turn around and where are your favorite spots?\n\nNo I don't live in Detroit, now I live in Florida. But I still visit all the time. They're really fixing it up now. When they do that to the hood I might move back.\n\nWhat is the best activity to do while listening to funk music?\n\nDance your ass off and smoke a joint\n\nDo you have a favourite Prince song?\n\nBrother Can You Paradigm\n\nCan I ride on the mothership?\n\nI don't know if that's allowed there are the Smithsonian Museum!\n\nBoxers, briefs, or fig leaf?\n\nDepends\n\nAre you still hung up on bones?\n\nNot at my age\n\nWhat's your favorite use of any of your songs on television or in a movie?\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy, Good Burger\n\nWhat are some entertaining Bootsy stories?\n\nWe were driving into Toronto together and were contacted by a UFO. We saw a flashing light hit the ground first in front of our car. Three of four minutes later we saw it again two times, hit the street. Then the light hit the car and the light turned to liquid like mercury from a thermometer, beaded up and rolled off the car. All the street lights went out slowly as we passed. We looked behind us it was dark. Bootsy wasn't scared, he thought I knew what was going on. We weren't high, because he just crossed the border. We eventually arrived home and walked in the house and my daughter said, you all acting like you just saw a ghost! I didn't even think about it until later, why were we seeing light in daylight. I had to call Bootsy to confirm what time of day it was. We lost a lot of time that day and didn't realize it until years later.\n\nWas there any counter movement or objection to funk music, or was it a type of music that was accepted by everyone at the time? What treatment did you receive once you guys became a more well-known act?\n\nWe were too black for white folk. And too white for black folks. But as time passed, more people got on board. By the time we released Mothership Connection we had a huge fan base. Weâve been one nation under a groove ever since.\n\nThanks for your art, I look forward to the next 10,000 years. Which leads me to my question: do you think you are more 5th, 6th, 7th or 8th dimensional?\n\nBetween 7 and 8\n\nWhy did Garry Shider wear a diaper on stage?\n\nHe was a baby at the time. I had got old and was a grand dad by then. It was time for the younger one to wear the diaper. Plus he liked wearing it.\n\nHow often do you listen to your own music?\n\nAll the time. I had to figure out what people were hearing when they wanted to sample it. I had to get re-acquainted with it.\n\nCan you tell us about being added as a secret character in the original NBA Jam arcade game? How did that all go down?\n\nI didn't know I was in there for a long time until someone finally told me that I was in the game. At the time I thought it was pretty cool because I was playing video games all the time, just not that one. I was playing Galaga, Galaxian, old old school.\n\nIf I were to hop in your car right now what would be playing through the speakers when I turned it on?\n\nProbably Cardi B\n\nSeen you live twice sir, spectacular shows, thank you! I'm in the cannabis industry, and I was wondering if we could get some love for legalization from you please? Just a shout-out of support is all I need :)\n\nPLEASE LEGALIZE THE SHIT. You got my support. In fact, I want to get in the cannabiz too! Brand that shit, give me a deal.\n\nHave you been to the National Museum of African American History? What did you think?\n\nYep. Love it. I was so busy looking at the Mothership first time. I had to go back a few more times.\n\nOut of all the venues you've done, which was the wildest in the 70s?\n\nI can't remember the name of it. It was in South Carolina, it was a religious college and was named after one of the Senators. They were wilder than anywhere we have ever been, and it was supposed to be a religious school. They partied harder than anywhere, even the police were partying. And they had in the newspaper that we shouldn't play there because of our reputation. After the show, we thought we shouldn't play there because of their reputation.\n\nWho is Sir Nose, and why can't he swim or dance?\n\nAlso, we need a Chocolate City now more than ever! When are you running for President??\n\nYou're the best, George Clinton. You're my favorite musician of all time.\n\nHe was too cool to swim because his hair would get messed up. And he was too cool to dance, because he might blow his image. Didn't want to jump around looking silly. He always wanted to look cool. He was too cool to make love. And I'm not running for president. I wouldn't want that job.\n\nYou are a legend, but did you ever end up getting that pet skunk that you wanted?\n\nNo I got a pig instead. His name was Officer Gibbles.\n\nOne of my favorite cuts from one of my favorite P-Funk songs:\n\nParliament Funkadelic \"Comin Round The Mountain\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTXsndtmz5M\n\nHow did it feel to be part of such a large band? Was it hard to split the money?\n\nAre you the leader of the band?\n\nWho writes the songs?\n\nDid you cry when you had to retire the mothership?\n\nYears and years ago, a family friend was telling me the story of meeting you. Rather a far ways into the conversation, she asked you if you wanted anything to drink, and she quoted you as saying \"Yeah. Your dirty bathwater.\" Did this happen? It's one of her favorite stories :)\n\nYou feel safe with a large band. You know they got your back. You can always find someone one stage ready to kick up. If the guitar playing isn't feeling it, the drummer will, five or six of the singers will. We perform like a broadway play. Different people perform on different nights. It's never the same show twice.\n\nYes, I am the leader of the band. I write the songs and lyrics. All the musicians arrange the songs or make the beats, as they say nowadays.\n\nTheres accusations that you didn't properly compensate your band members especially Bernie Worrel? Is there anything you have to say about that?\n\nThe accusation that i don't pay my musicians is not true. Especially Bernie. He was always paid before anybody else got paid. In fact, the reason Calvin, Grady, and Fuzzy left the band is because I had paid Bernie more than them. Bernie did arrangements and music, so he got paid more than the others - always.\n\nWhats the funkiest thing outside of music?\n\nAnchovy Pussy\n\nWhose idea was the mothership?\n\nAfter seeing all the huge productions, like Pink Floyd the Wall, I wanted to do a huge stage production too. You can thank Pink Floyd for the Mothership.\n\nHow does one measure funk? How do I know if I got the Funk?\n\nYou'll know if you got the funk. Your booty will tell you. Your butt will move involuntarily and will feel good\n\nMr. Clinton,\n\nThe song \"Can You Get To That\" off Maggot Brain is far and away my favorite song from any of your groups, so thank you for writing that masterpiece.\n\nMy question is: Did you personally approve the sample of that song for the song \"Rill Rill\" by Sleigh Bells? If not, were you aware that song existed?\n\nWe did not know until it appeared on the Super Bowl Commercial. And we still trying to get paid for that.\n\nWhat'd you do with the money?\n\nSpend it on recording, studios, band payments, rent\n\nI've always wondered why we don't hear more mainstream hip-hop artists collaborating with you. Are people not asking, or do you just prefer to stick to your own thing?\n\nI'm ready to work with anybody who wants to get down\n\nHi George! Will you ever stop your whoring ways?\n\nNo I'll fuck with you\n\nIs there funk after death?\n\nIs 7 still up?\n\nHave you ever actually been in an elevator with Kraftwerk?\n\nNo I have never been in the elevator with Kraftwerk but I'd like to get in there and record a song with Kraftwerk\n\nDr. Funkenstein, what do you think of Childish Gambino's new album?\n\nI think its the P\n\nThis interview was transcribed from an \"ask me anything\" question and answer session with George Clinton conducted on Reddit on 2018-01-15.
