        "text": "Rage Against The Machine, the band that launched rap-metal worldwide, realized one of the most important leitmotivs of the decade: a fundamental unity of purpose between the music of black urban rebels and the music of white urban rebels. Rage Against The Machine (1992), one of the most violent albums of the time, a worthy heir to MC5's homicidal fury, sustained seismic shocks after seismic shocks thanks to Tom Morello's guitar explosions (from Hendrix-ian glissandoes to Page-esque hard-rock riffs), Zack de la Rocha's visceral and frantic rapping and ultra-syncopated hail-like rhythms. The sinister and morbid atmosphere of Evil Empire (1996), virtually a philosophical essay on willpower, and the passionate call to arms of The Battle of Los Angeles (1999) reached new depths although they lost most of the bite. (Translation by/ Tradotto da Elder Yautija)\n\nRage Against The Machine represented one of the most important crossroads of the 90's: the one between the music of urban black rebels (funk, hip-hop) and that of their white counterpart (heavy metal, hard-rock, punk-rock). Socially speaking, they were their CNN. In a way, they forcefully took the words out of hip-hop, which had become in the meantime a genre for spoiled intellectuals and that portion of the black community that let itself get corrupted by the establishment.\n\nThe band was formed in L.A. by a seasoned musician, and one unbridled fan of his. That musician was Tom Morello, a sociology graduate of Kenyan descent, who arrived in L.A. in 1986, became the guitarist in Lock Up (with which he recorded Somethin' Bitchin This Way Come (Geffen, 1990), album which paved the way to funk rock. The fan was Zack De La Rocha, nephew of an immigrant farmer from Mexico, and son of a soldier. They were lucky to find along the way Tim Commefrord, a bass player, and drummer Brad Wilk, both capable to recreate hip-hop's syncopations as well as sparking off the violence of hard rock.\n\nRage Against The Machine (Epic,1992) is one of the most violent albums of the period, rightful heir of the homicidal rage of Detroit's MC5. It is not so much the incendiary lyrics as the earthshaking power of the music that raised a barrier between them and common hardcore. Where other bands try to express their angst while at the same time trying to stay melodic, R.A.T.M. can decimate their own songs in order to express their rage. Rage which becomes condensed in an crossover between heavy metal, hardcore, funk and hip-hop. Mirroring the melting pot of contemporary L.A., the quartet took its inspiration from Public Enemy, Clash, Bad Brains and Red Hot Chili Peppers to create wild and ferocious attacks, verbal and musical, sgsinst the institutions: Killing In The Name (their masterpiece, with a \"panzer\" rhythm and a explosive riff and solo), Bombtrack (the angriest rap), Know Your Enemy (riff a' la Deep Purple and \"organ\" solo achieved by distorting the guitar tone) and Freedom (example of their irregular rhythms). These songs drip with homages, burn from \"hendrixian\" fire, tremble with \"zeppelinian\" thrills and rhythms (particularly Bullet In The Head and Wake Up). Their musical hailstorms and syncopations turn into accusations against the hypocrisy of the \"American dream\". With R.A.T.M., the two worlds of white hard rock and black hip-hop meet, guitar riffs and syncopated beats become complementary, singing and rapping become one.\n\nEvil Empire (Epic,1996) adds a threatening and sinister tone to their ramming assaults, going off on a tangent (especially rhythmically), and thus expanding the range of the compositions. The product is even more deafening, and the vehemence is even wilder. At this point, Tom Morello's guitaristic prowess has reached an incredibly high level: he interchanges powerful heavy metal riffs with shock-inducing dissonances, often in a metallic fashion (his wildest virtuosities may be found in the track Wind Below). The feeling of power ala Nietzsche shows itself in the songs that combine \"panzer\" rhythms and \"hendrixian\" experimentalism: the hypertension of Bulls On Parade (which has a cyclopean riff and, above all, the way Morello's guitar chases the dj's scratching), and Revolver (the most elaborate and dramatic song). Among the angularities and all the vehemence of People Of The Sun (metallic guitar riff, violent rap), the epileptic impetus of Tire Me, rest the revolutionary personality of the singer: his lyrics are ever-so politically charged, and when he plays motivational speaker De La Rocha is quite without rivals (Vietnowm). What leaves much to be desired is the repetitiveness of the songs, which are rarely supported by engaging melodies or riffs."
