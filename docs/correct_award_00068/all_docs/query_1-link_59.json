        "text": "The two later separated in 1942, with Steinbeck marrying Gwyn Conger just a year later. This novel remains a favourite with readers, but some of its language is now deemed offensive.\n\nWatch a clip of the trailer for the 1992 film adaptation\n\nThis is a collection of short stories about ranch and farm life.\n\nWatch a short video about the Dust Bowl\n\nThe novel was a controversial publication, with many schools, libraries and the Soviet Union briefly banning and symbolically burning the text due to its ‘offensive’ language, sexual references and what many deemed Steinbeck’s communist agenda.\n\nWatch the trailer for the film\n\nThe two later separated in 1948 after a troubled marriage. In 2018, Conger’s memoir, My Life with John Steinbeck: The Story of John Steinbeck’s Forgotten Wife, was published in which she branded Steinbeck a ‘sadistic’ man and a ‘womaniser’. He remained with her until his death 18 years later. This was his final work of fiction. Travels with Charley, a non-fictional account of a road trip with his poodle, was published in 1962. It was awarded ‘for his realistic and imaginative writings, combining as they do sympathetic humour and keen social perception’.\n\nWatch the clip of Steinbeck’s acceptance speech\n\nAn autopsy ruled heart disease and congestive heart failure as the causes of Steinbeck’s death, attributed to Steinbeck’s status as a lifelong smoker.\n\nRead an article written to mark the 50th anniversary of his death\n\nIn the first few years of their marriage, Steinbeck and his wife, Elaine, had travelled through England and Wales researching the legends for his publication."
