        "text": "I’m a big fan of John Steinbeck, and not just because he’s from California, like I am. I admire the man because East of Eden, Tortilla Flat and Cannery Row are among my favorite reads.\n\nIt was The Winter of Our Discontent, one of John Steinbeck’s also-rans, a meh moment sort of book, that corresponded chronologically to him receiving that most esteemed of all literary awards, The Nobel Prize. Some critics claim the Nobel panel was just throwing Steinbeck a bone that year, there being nobody better. Others contend he was chosen in 1962 because the Nobel Prize for Literature is awarded for a lifetime body of work, not just one novel in the writer’s canon.\n\nWhatever the reasons, Steinbeck’s Nobel acceptance speech revealed why he is among the greats at the heights of the literary pantheon. I would like to share some key components of it, to demonstrate why writing is a noble art, not just for Nobel winners, but for all who undertake it. Like Steinbeck, I believe writers have a divinely-appointed duty to better mankind. I will italicize his words.\n\n“It is customary for the recipient of this award to offer personal or scholarly comment on the nature and the direction of literature. At this particular time, however, I think it would be well to consider the high duties and the responsibilities of the makers of literature.\n\nSuch is the prestige of the Nobel award and of this place where I stand that I am impelled, not to squeak like a grateful and apologetic mouse, but to roar like a lion out of pride in my profession and in the great and good men who have practiced it through the ages.”\n\nAnd so the lion begins to roar. Steinbeck makes it clear at the start that writers have high duties and responsibilities.\n\n“The ancient commission of the writer has not changed. He is charged with exposing our many grievous faults and failures, with dredging up to the light our dark and dangerous dreams for the purpose of improvement.”\n\nThe purpose of improvement, says he. Writing is not literary masturbation, aimed only at self-gratification. Steinbeck himself made a nice living out of his art, good for him, but he was also keenly aware of his audience, of the impression he could make upon their minds and souls.\n\nAnd here’s the real kicker — the most pertinent part.\n\n“I hold that a writer who does not passionately believe in the perfectibility of man, has no dedication nor any membership in literature.”\n\nI take this statement for my battle flag. Writers are here to polish mankind to perfection. Will Homo sapiens ever be perfect? Not in our lifetimes. But if we give up trying, we have abandoned the calling of our creator, whatever name you give to that creator. This creator is also the muse that powers our words, the still small voice who whispers into our souls.\n\nA couple weeks ago I started reading a post on Medium by an absolutely brilliant lady. She has the soul of a poet — witty and articulate, a true wordsmith. I found myself captivated and entertained.\n\nThen her wonderful story degenerated into base, ugly, slimy pornography, and I clicked the back button.\n\nI know my comments here are going to ruffle some feathers. You’re going to call me a prude, and perhaps I am. But I never hesitate to say that I am against pornography, and not for religious reasons. I like women, I love women, but I think pornography objectifies females, reducing them to sex objects. It appeals to the bowels of the male reptilian brain stem.\n\nI’m not being a hypocrite here. I am guilty of looking at pornography from time to time, and am not proud of it. It’s something I struggle with. I too have a reptilian brain stem, and there’s no way it can be surgically removed without rendering me a vegetable. I suppose I am stuck with it.\n\nI’m not saying I don’t like sex. Sex between two consenting adults is natural and lovely, if it is done with deep reverence for the dignity of the other, not with the idea that a sexual partner is just a rag being used to soak up our biological discharges, then discarded. Sexual union can be a legitimate theme of high art and poetry.\n\nWhat I was reading in that article did not reflect any of these higher qualities. It was just cheap, throwaway gutter rutting that did not appeal to any lofty aesthetic senses. It was nasty, low, and dirty.\n\nAnd that’s a shame, because the writer is extremely talented, and she should be using her talents for what literary luminary John Steinbeck said, to work for the perfectibility of man.\n\nI understand that writing porn is probably pretty lucrative. It brings in boatloads more cash than my pitiful scrawls bouncing around this empty echo chamber do. But if you have talent like this writer does, it’s a cop out. It’s a sell out. It’s a way to get cheap views and likes by scraping the bilges in the pit of human nature.\n\nI’ll leave you pondering other bits and pieces of Steinbeck’s very concise acceptance speech. He wasn’t on an anti-pornography rant, I may add. I don’t know what his views on the subject were, or if he had any at all. This was 1962, and who could predict the explosion of Internet porn to splatter the horizon? Who could even predict the Internet? But here you go — Steinbeck’s divine mission for writers, copied and pasted with true reverence:\n\nWe have usurped many of the powers we once ascribed to God.\n\n…Having taken Godlike power, we must seek in ourselves for the responsibility and the wisdom we once prayed some deity might have."
