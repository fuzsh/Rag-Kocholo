        "text": "That gentle Califorman giant John Steinbeck has spent a lifetime trying not to get tagged as a Literary Gent. From the time that \"Of Mice and Men\" made his name in the thirties he has been wary of any publicity that tried to lift him out of the crowd.\n\nBut now he has been cornered in perhaps the only way he would not want to avoid – by the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature. From now on he will be as much a Literary Gent as Mann and Eliot and Pasternak, those prize-winning gents with more literary backgrounds, and his attempts to remain an ordinary guy will be more than ever uphill work for the ex-labourer and ex-ranchhand.\n\nIt is as though Doc in \"Cannery Row\" had been canonised, for Mack and the Boys in Steinbeck's novel knew Doc was a saint but none of them dared tell him so. Similarly John Steinbeck has been a leading Literary Gent for nearly thirty years but he has never accepted any such status, in fact any status at all.\n\nThis is because he has always been afraid of losing touch with ordinary lives, for he once defined his aim as to make people understand one another. His latest book, \"Travel with Charley\", a best seller, describes a typically modest tour of the nation he undertook in his sixties simply \"to keep in touch\". In this sense the sixth American winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature is different from his late prize-winning contemporaries, Faulkner and Hemingway, for he has kept much closer to the social theme than those two failed poets, wrapped in their subjective concerns.\n\nBut he is a committed writer in a way they never were and his best work has come out of his indignation over social injustice, notably in \"The Grapes of Wrath\". If he had received the Nobel Prize when that first novel was first published there would have been general applause, but in his mellower middle age. with the depression behind him, his work has seldom been fired by creative indignation – what was there to fire him?\n\nIn this sense he has lost touch with post-depression life, as he feared he would, and the campus intellectuals who rushed to pick over Fitzgerald, Faulkner,and Hemingway, left him alone. But his brilliantly simple style has always remained whatever happened to his material. This in turn reflected the sturdy original character of John Steinbeck which was keystone enough for any literary career short of genius.\n\nHe has been respectful of his craft as few writers are, extending both the technique and the feel of the novel."
