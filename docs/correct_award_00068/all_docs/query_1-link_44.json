        "text": "It has taken us quite a while to catch up with John Steinbeck to congratulate him on winning the Nobel Prize, but the mission was at last accomplished one recent afternoon, when we encountered him in the lobby of the Palace Hotel, in Helsinki, as he was rounding out the third day of a projected nine-week tour of Finland, Russia, Poland, Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Germany, undertaken in the interests of the State Department’s Cultural Exchange Program.\n\n“Sending me on a cultural tour makes as much sense as a bank advertising that Willie Sutton is one of its cashiers,” Mr. Steinbeck said, in a deep, gravelly voice, and smiled broadly as two United States Information Service aides, who were accompanying him, smiled narrowly. “Jayne Mansfield is also in town,” he continued. “She’s helping judge the Miss Scandinavia contest. You see, we’re both spreading culture.”\n\nAt this point, one of the aides reminded Mr. Steinbeck that the American Ambassador, Carl Rowan, was waiting for him at the Embassy. The Ambassador and Mr. Steinbeck, we learned, were to pay a call together on F. E. Sillanpää, the only Finn who has won the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\n“I’m taking him a bottle of brandy,” Mr. Steinbeck said. “It’s the cultural thing to do.” Afterward, he continued, he was scheduled to meet a group of university students and then return to the hotel for a couple of hours before going out again, this time to dine with a group of local writers. “I’ll be back in my room about five,” he said. “My wife’s with me. Come on up, and we’ll have some Embassy whiskey.”\n\nWe thanked him and said we would.\n\nWhen we arrived at the Steinbecks’ suite, which was on the ninth floor and had a magnificent view of the harbor, we were greeted by Mrs. Steinbeck, an attractive, vivacious woman, who told us that her husband had called to say he would be a few minutes late. “The session at the university lasted longer than had been planned,” she explained, and invited us in. “Everything seems to take longer than planned,” she continued. “John has been busy almost every minute since he stepped off the plane, but I think he’s enjoying it, and the reception has been just wonderful.” She showed us a batch of newspaper clippings about the visit, one of which was illustrated with a photograph of Mr. Steinbeck wearing a black patch over his left eye. “He had an operation for a detached retina on that eye a few months ago, and he had to protect it from the television lights,” Mrs. Steinbeck said.\n\nPresently, there was a vigorous knock on the door, and Mr. Steinbeck walked in. He was dressed, as he had been earlier, in a brown suit with a prominent black stripe, a white shirt, and a bright-green tie, and in the lapel of his jacket we noticed what appeared to be a gold ribbon, which we took to signify a decoration. Confessing our ignorance, we asked if that was what Nobel Prize winners are entitled to wear.\n\n“Oh, no,” Mr. S. replied, raising his eyebrows in mock astonishment. “I asked about that in Stockholm, and they told me there’s no need for such a thing, because everybody knows.” He smiled. “May I tell you what this is in my buttonhole?” he continued. “It is a piece of wrapping string from Bonwit Teller. Nobody has ever asked me before what it represents. All it represents is my revolt against decorations.”\n\nMrs. Steinbeck asked her husband how the afternoon had gone.\n\n“Fine—tiring but fine,” he replied. “Mr. Sillanpää must be seventy-five, but he’s lively as all hell and full of stories. The students were great. Oh, brother, have they read! They asked me things about my books that I’d forgotten years ago. It keeps you on your toes, and it’s rewarding, but it’s also pretty rugged. I had a recording session at nine-thirty this morning, and I’ve been going ever since without stopping. For about five years, I refused to make a tour like this, but finally I gave in to the pressure. It came from a source that in our country I suppose we would consider an order. So I accepted, and said I’d do what I could, but I find I get very tired. The thing is I have no experience at this. I have never lectured. I have never talked to groups of people. The result is I have no ability to hold back any energy. We’ve been here three days, and it seems like three months.”\n\nAfter Mrs. Steinbeck had mixed a drink for her husband and us, and he had settled back in an easy chair, we asked if he would mind recalling for our benefit the circumstances in which he received the news of his winning the Nobel Prize.\n\n“Not at all,” he replied. “Only trouble is that I don’t remember too much. I really don’t. But my wife does.”\n\n“We were in Sag Harbor,” Mrs. Steinbeck said. “We have a tiny little cottage out there. I had started to make breakfast and was frying some bacon. It was shortly after eight o’clock. The Cuban crisis was at fever pitch, and John came in and said, ‘Let’s see if the world’s still turning.’ He switched on the television, which we normally never do in the morning, and the very first words we heard were ‘This morning it was announced in Stockholm that John Steinbeck has been awarded the Nobel Prize.’ ”\n\n“You know what she did?” Mr. Steinbeck said. “She was so excited she put the pan full of frying bacon into the refrigerator.”\n\n“I think it was the most exciting morning of our lives,” Mrs. S. continued. “The phone started ringing wildly—newspapers and friends. John won’t talk on the phone if he can avoid it, so I answered it, and I didn’t find out until later that all I kept saying was ‘Please hang up, so we can call our children.’ When I got a free line, I put in a call to one of our sons, who was in school in Maine, and when a woman there answered, I said, ‘May I speak to my son?’ and she said, ‘Why, of course not. He’s in class.’ I said, ‘Well, that’s all right. Would you please send somebody over and tell him his father has just won the Nobel Prize.’ She let out a whoop. Then John’s publisher called and said John had better have a press conference.”\n\n“By that time, we realized that it meant mounting machine guns on the border of the property or going in to town and getting it over with,” Mr. Steinbeck said. “So we drove in, and I promptly got into trouble, because I mumbled. My voice sounds like a cement mixer, and in addition I mumble. They asked how I felt, and I said, ‘Wrapped and shellacked.’ That caused great controversy. They didn’t understand. Somebody said, ‘What does it have to do with?’ I said, ‘Well, you know, when you’re repairing a fishing rod, you wrap it and shellac it, but I’m using the term in a different sense.’ ”\n\n“It was utterly meaningless, and only John enjoyed it,” Mrs. Steinbeck said.\n\n“I enjoyed it thoroughly,” he said, “because everybody interpreted it differently, and all I was doing was having little fun.”\n\n“That evening, we went to a very small private victory party given by John’s literary agent, Elizabeth Otis, of McIntosh & Otis,” Mrs. Steinbeck said. “She’s been his agent for more than thirty years, so she’s really family.”\n\n“They’re the only agents I’ve ever had,” Mr. Steinbeck said. “They represented me when I literally didn’t have the money for postage. They paid it for me.”\n\n“There was just one other guest—John’s editor at Viking Press, Pascal Covici, who was the first man ever to publish him,” Mrs. Steinbeck continued.\n\n“Not ever,” Mr. Steinbeck said. “A lot of people had published me before and gone broke. I once broke three in one year. After that, I began to feel that perhaps I should get out of the field.”\n\n“The next morning, we went back to Sag Harbor,” Mrs. Steinbeck said, “and in the next five days John and a local girl and I handled a thousand pieces of mail from readers and friends. Before long, the mail was being delivered to us in sacks, and we decided we’d have to go in to town and get more help. Besides, we had to get ready to go to Stockholm. John said, ‘I’m going to rent my tails. I’ll just be wearing them twice—once standing up and once lying down.’ Elizabeth Otis and I rose up in horror, and he finally went to Saks and bought them. I had to buy quite a trousseau for myself, and then we set out for Stockholm and what I think is the most fabulous ceremony in the world.”\n\n“I don’t remember it,” Mr. Steinbeck said. “It’s like childbirth, you know. I remember the fanfare with medieval trumpets—that lifts you right out of your seat—and some other things, but I really don’t remember very much. The whole thing has become dreamlike. It was so— almost anesthetizing. I liked the idea of the prize, but I didn’t really want it, because it’s like an epitaph. It has the effect of making people think you’re dead. Of course, a lot of critics have thought that about me for years, but I didn’t think I was ready to die. I did have some more work I wanted to do. Well, I’ve been a newspaperman long enough to know that things like this are over very quickly. Before long, people are saying, ‘Oh, yes, didn’t he win something once?’ ”\n\nMr. Steinbeck took a package of cigarillos from a pocket and lighted one. “Speaking of prizes and literary compliments and so forth,” he said, “I had a letter a few weeks ago from a bookseller in one of the outlying districts of Denmark who said, ‘I feel you ought to know about this. A woman rowed in an open boat over eight miles to bring two chickens to my store to exchange for one of your paperback books.’ Just think! Rowing eight miles there and eight miles back—sixteen miles—to make a trade for one of your books! That is what you write for. That is as good a prize as you can get.” ♦"
