        "text": "2. John Steinbeck (1902 – 1968)  American writer. Winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962  The most famous novels:  “Of Mice and Man”  “The Grapes of Wrath”  “In Dubious Battle”  “East of Eden”  “Winter of Our Discontent”\n\n3.  “I ovo verujem: da je slobodan, istraživački um pojedinca najvrednija stvar na svetu. A za ovo bih se borio: slobodu uma da krene u bilo kom pravcu, bez direktive. I protiv ovoga se moram boriti: bilo koje ideje, religije ili vlade koja ograničava ili uništava pojedinca. Ovo je ono što sam ja i za šta se zalažem”. CITAT “Istočno od raja”\n\n5. “Pokušajte da razumete ljude”  “U svakom iskrenom pisanju na svetu postoji osnovna tema.  Pokušajte da razumete ljude, ako se budete razumeli, bićete pažljivi jedni prema drugima.  Dobro poznavanje čoveka nikada ne vodi u mržnju i skoro uvek vodi ka ljubavi”.\n\n6. THE FIRST LITERARY SUCCESSES  “Tortilla Flat” (1935) – collection of stories about paisanos from Monterey (literally, countrymen – a small band of errant friends enjoying life and wine in the days after the end of WWI).  Popularity and money...  The movie “Tortilla Flat” with Hedy Lamarr and Spencer Tracy was a;lready filmed in 1942. .\n\n8. PULITZER PRIZE  “In Dubious Battle” (1936)  “Of Mice and Men” (1937)  “The Grapes of Wrath” (1939) – probably his famous novel  This novel won him the Pulitzer Prize for literature in 1940.\n\n12. CHRISTIAN IMAGES  Many have noted the use of Christian imagery and motifs in the novel “The Grapes of Wrath”.  The main characters in the novel, Tom and Jim Casy, are interpreted as figures similar to Christ in different periods of his life, i.e. resurrection.  There are also religious images in other characters and plot elements.  Steinbeck will deal with biblical themes and motifs later, especially in the novel “East of Eden”.\n\n13. SECOND WORLD WAR  He was a war reporter for one New York newspaper.  The works he wrote related to the Second World War are: “Bombs Away” (1942), “The Moon is Down”(1942), “A Russian Journal”(1948), “Once There Was a War”(1958).\n\n14. THE POST-WAR PERIOD  Social themes, i.e. injustices in society, poverty, hard life and the cruelty that exploitation imposes, were Steinbeck great preoccupation.  Steinbeck will return to social criticism even after the WWII in his works: “The Wayward Bus” , “The Pearl” ...  However, those works are somewhat more relaxed and sentimental than his other stories.\n\n15. LATE YEARS  “Burning Bright” (1950) – a dramatic piece “wrapped” in a novel, a moral drama revolving around spouses.  “East of Eden” – a monumental epic story, a saga of the Salinas Valley, a chronicle of the writer’s family and an allegorical novel about identity, suffering, grief and humanity.  It is a novel that he dedicated to his sons.  The themes of the novel are connected to the Bible (especially the story of Cain and Abel).  A part of this novel was used by director Elia Kazan for the film “East of Eden” (1955) starring James Dean and Julie Harris.\n\n18. Citat  “Verujem da jaka žena može biti jača od muškarca, posebno ako joj se desi da ima ljubavi u srcu. Mislim da je žena koja voli neuništiva”. “Istočno od raja”\n\n19. Citat  “Strašno je ne biti voljen. To je najgora stvar na svetu… To te čini zločestim, nasilnim i okrutnim”. “Istočno od raja”\n\n20. THE LAST NOVEL  The novel “The Winter of Our Discontent” is as much a psychological story about self-discovery as it is a moral portrait of America in the sixties of the 20th century.  That novel was not considered by many to be as good as his previous novels, but the fact is that after that novel Steinbeck received the Nobel prize in 1962.  The great book ”Travels with Charlie: In Search of America” , which was written after Steinbeck’s last novel, certainly contributed to this.\n\n22. “Biti živ znači imati ožiljke” – citat iz “Zime našeg nezadovoljstva”"
