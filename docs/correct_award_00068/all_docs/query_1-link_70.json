        "text": "John Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962. 50 years on, the Swedish academy have opened records of the judges’ decision which show British writers Robert Graves and Lawrence Durrell were shortlisted.\n\nThe records, which were first reported in Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet, show the names of the 66 authors nominated, the shortlist and the judges comments on them. The latter suggests 1962 was a tough year in literary recognition for all the wrong reasons.\n\nA Nobel committee member recorded, “There aren’t any obvious candidates for the Nobel prize and the prize committee is in an unenviable situation.”\n\nGraves was rejected for being a poet first and a novelist second. The committee were unwilling to award a poet before Ezra Pound’s death as they believed his skill was unbeatable, although his politics cost him the prize.\n\nDurrell had been nominated the previous year but had lost out because his work “gives a dubious aftertaste...because of [his] monomaniacal preoccupation with erotic complications.”\n\nSteinbeck was recognised for “his realistic and imaginative writings”. After eight years of nominations, it was his 1961 novel The Winter of Our Discontent which won him the prize. The Academy’s permanent secretary, Anders Osterling, said the publication proved Steinbeck had “regained his position as a social truth-teller and authentic realist fully equal to his predecessors Sinclair Lewis and Ernest Hemingway.”\n\nPopular opinion also swayed Osterling’s choice, although the decision proved a controversial one."
