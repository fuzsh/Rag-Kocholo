        "text": "Arts and Letters\n\nWhere Have All the Artist-Addicts Gone?\n\nFor much of the 20th century, before the dawn of our own wellness-focused era, madness and substance abuse were often considered prerequisites for great art.\n\nBy M. H. Miller and Duane Michals\n\nWriter’s Best Friend\n\nOn National Pet Day, we look at some of our most famous authors and the furry companions — dogs, cats and even goats — who offered them inspiration.\n\nBy Alexandra Alter and Erica Ackerberg\n\nexclusive\n\nJohn Steinbeck’s ‘Little Fishing Place’ in Sag Harbor Is on the Market\n\nThe novelist spent his summers at the waterfront property, which sits on 1.8 acres and includes his “writing house.” The asking price is $17.9 million.\n\nBy Vivian Marino\n\nNonfiction\n\nJohn Steinbeck, Bard of the American Worker\n\nIn a new biography, “Mad at the World,” William Souder claims the “Of Mice and Men” author was motivated by anger toward injustice.\n\nBy Brenda Wineapple\n\nFrank Sinatra Slept Here, and So Can You\n\nIn New York and across the country, the former homes of famous writers, musicians and film stars are available as short-term rentals.\n\nBy Caroline Biggs\n\nLive Like a Star\n\nShort-term rentals around the country offer connections to the rich and famous, including the likes of Frank Sinatra, Bob Dylan and Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald.\n\nUnearthed Steinbeck Short Story Isn’t at All Like ‘Grapes of Wrath’\n\nThe quintessentially American author wrote pieces for a Paris newspaper in the 1950s. Now, one of those — about a nervous chef and a magnificent cat — is being published in English for the first time.\n\nBy Jacey Fortin"
