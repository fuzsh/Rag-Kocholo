        "text": "Life\n\nJohn Steinbeck grew up in a small town in a family that a few generations back had emigrated to the United States from Germany, England and Ireland. While studying at Stanford University, he worked during breaks and summers in farm fields that cultivated sugar beets and other crops. He did not earn a college degree but discontinued his studies to move to New York. There he worked as a writer and critic and met his first wife, Carol Henning. He was married two more times and had two sons.\n\nWork\n\nConditions for migrants and seasonal workers became a recurring theme in Steinbeck’s writings and were particularly evident in Of Mice and Men and The Grapes of Wrath. The latter relates how unemployment and abuse of power forced farmers to migrate from Oklahoma to California. Sympathy with the downtrodden and the poor characterizes his writing. It is expressed with a compassionate sense of humor and a sharp eye for social and economic injustices. His other outstanding works include East of Eden (1952) and The Pearl (1947)."
