When he and his wife, Juana, have a baby, their joy is complete.... Until the infant is bitten by a scorpion. Kino finds a great pearl worth a fortune, far more than enough to pay the doctor needed to save the baby's life, but it brings only tragedy and evil to his family. A masterpiece of American literature. (From the publisher.)"
