        "text": "In a similar way, we want to share an interview with you that we had with Herb Beherens, a volunteer at the National Steinbeck Center in Salinas, California. Herb has devoted years to better understanding this remarkable writer, and he told his Steinbeck stories with great fondness, intimacy and knowledge. Herb shared Steinbeck's advice to a young writer with bad reviews, some wisdom for us all:\n\n\"Writing is the best revenge.\"\n\nÂ\n\nAnd that began my obsession with Americaâs most powerful writer. An author who writes so easily, so flawlessly, that you are easily lulled into believing it is your own mind spinning the words into golden threads of stories about people like you and me, only living on the edge, or struggling to survive, or giving their best to maintain their dignity and valor and direction.\n\nÂ\n\nItâs no wonder that this writer won the Nobel for Literature, a Pulitzer, and so many other awards. And, itâs no wonder he never expected any of these. He was a modest man who simply wanted to share his stories with people.\n\nItâs embarrassing, but I (George) must make a confession about this latest interview.\n\nÂ\n\nYou see, I hated John Steinbeck. I knew he was a hack writer, a poser, a simple-minded artichoke-eating phony. I knew this because I grew up in the same area as he, andÂ no one who grew up in my own area could amount to a hill of beans. So, despite a life of reading the classics and greats, I never read a word of his scribbles.\n\nÂ\n\nAnd then a few years ago I was driving through Portland on a sunny summer day when I heard the opening paragraph to Cannery Row read on NPR in recognition of the 50th Anniversary of Doc Ricketts' death. I was stunned. It was a paragraph as powerful as the opening of A Tale of Two Cities. I immediately drove to Powellâs Books and bought a copy.\n\nAwards & Honors\n\nCalifornia Commonwealth Club Gold Medal Awards for Best Novel - 1936, Tortilla Flat; - 1937, In Dubious Battle\n\nNew York Drama Critics' Circle Award - 1938, Of Mice and Men\n\nPulitzer Prize - 1940, The Grapes of Wrath\n\nAcademy Award nominations* - 1944, Lifeboat - story; - 1945 A Medal for Benny - story, with Jack Wagner; - 1952 Viva, Zapata! - story and screenplay\n\nKing Haakon Liberty Cross - Norway - 1946, The Moon is Down\n\nMember of the American Academy of Arts and Letters - 1948\n\nNobel Prize for Literature - 1962\n\nUnited States Medal of Freedom - 1964\n\nTrustee of John F.
