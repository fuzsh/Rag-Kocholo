        "text": "At the close of the ’70s, eminent auteur Jess Franco (SHE KILLED IN ECSTASY) revisited the works of Marquis de Sade to create what EuroSleaze historians have called one of the most sexually daring and boldly creative films of his entire career: When an unstable noblewoman (a fearless performance by Lina Romay) returns to her lavish estate, she will find herself – along with her libertine husband, his male lover, and a young nun with a craving for violation – trapped in a web of unholy hungers and decadent perversions. Susan Hemingway of TWO FEMALE SPIES WITH FLOWERED PANTIES co-stars in this sonata of artsy depravity – featuring a score by Franco & Franz Liszt – now transferred in 4k from an uncut 35mm print donated by The Instituto de la Sexualidad Humana in Madrid.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES:\n\nJess Franco on First Wife Nicole Guettard – Interview with Director Jess Franco.\n\nStephen Thrower on Sinfonia Erotica – Interview with the author of “Murderous Passions – The Delirious Cinema of Jesus Franco.”\n\nColor, 84 minutes in Spanish\n\nEnglish Subtitles\n\nAll regions. Wide Screen 1.66:1\n\nDolby Digital Mono\n\nProduction year: 1980\n\nDirector: Jess Franco\n\nCast: Lina Romay, Susan Hemingway, Armando Borges\n\nYOU MUST BE 18 OR OLDER AND AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THE WEBSITE TO ORDER THIS PRODUCT"
