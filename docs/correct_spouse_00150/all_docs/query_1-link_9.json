That same evening, Franco’s VENUS IN FURS was screened, and it was a trip sitting two rows behind Franco watching him watching one of his masterpieces. A great evening, for sure…and VENUS looked great on the big screen.\n\nThe lovely (and witty!) LINA ROMAY appeared alongside her longtime partner/director Jess Franco. When the host of the festival announced, “tomorrow night, Lina will be starring in THE BARE-BREASTED COUNTESS,” it was funny to see her do an exaggerated blush! What an honor it was to be in the same room with Jess & Lina!"
