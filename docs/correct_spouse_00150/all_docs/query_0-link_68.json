        "text": "Spanish director Jesus \"Jess\" Franco died Tuesday in Malaga, Spain due to complications from a stroke, Varietyreports. He was 82.\n\nBefore entering filmmaking, the Madrid native began composing music at age 6 and studied piano and harmony before penning a novel and later enrolling in film school.\n\nScariest TV and movie serial killers\n\nKnown for his low-budget cult films, Franco's first big hit was the 1962 film The Awful Dr. Orloff, which was also released in the U.S. He contributed greatly to the cinema fantastique genre, which employed supernatural phenomena in realistic stories, and he helped lead the 1960s Spanish horror boom.\n\nDespite fascist censorship, sex, blood and gore were prominently featured in his films. Franco's other notable works include 1969's Count Dracula, 1971's Dracula vs. Frankenstein and Oasis of the Zombies in 1983."
