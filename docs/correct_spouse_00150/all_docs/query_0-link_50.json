        "text": "There have been many great film auteurs in cinema history but, when you read the dictionary definition of what an auteur is, a strong case could be made for the husband and wife team of Jess Franco and Lina Romay. Together, over a 40 year period, they forged themselves on well over 100 films.\n\nTheir first film of note together was the one they are best known for, The Bare Breasted Countess. An R-rated version titled The Female Vampire was released on VHS and became the introduction to Franco’s films and Romay’s work as an actress. There were several versions shot of the with various degrees of hardcore inserts installed.\n\nUnlike most actress, even the ones in the Euro sex film genre, Lina Romay had no qualms about performing in hardcore scenes, nor, for that matter did Franco have any about shooting her doing the scenes, even after they became a live in couple. That aspect never seemed to matter to them. They were a normal couple.\n\nTogether, Franco and Romay would build an extensive filmography on very little money. They would divide their time shuttling between Germany, Spain and France, most of their films were the products co-productions between the various countries. As the 70s wore on, Franco and Romay turned more and more to hardcore porn to pay the bills.\n\nAs the 80s drug on, the last bit of quality would abandon Franco and his films and what was left was direct to video efforts with very little quality involved.\n\nRevenge of the Alligator Ladies (as Jess Franco)\n\n2012Al Pereira vs. the Alligator Ladies (as Jess Franco)\n\n2012La cripta de las condenadas: Parte II (as Jess Franco)\n\n2012La cripta de las condenadas (as Jess Franco)\n\n2010Paula-Paula (Video) (as Jess Franco)\n\n2008A Bad Day at the Cemetery (as Jess Franco)\n\n2008A Bad Day at the Cemetery II (as Jess Franco)\n\n2007Lascivia\n\n2006Montes de Venus\n\n2005Snakewoman (as Jess Franco)"
