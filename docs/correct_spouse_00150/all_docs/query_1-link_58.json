And Fraco was never better than when working with his wife, Lina Romay (1954-2012), a haunted waif who would go to any extreme to assure that the director’s wildest imaginings were brought to the screen without compromise.\n\nTheir most highly-regarded collaboration, FEMALE VAMPIRE stars Romay as the mysterious Countess Irina Karlstein, a beautiful vampiress who feeds on victims at their moments of sexual climax. Because she destroys those whose essence she consumes, Irina is doomed to a life of solitude, wondering through the Western Coast of Europe in a dreamlike state, shrouded in a lush musical score by Daniel White.\n\nThis Redemption edition includes the extended erotic version (FEMALE VAMPIRE), as well as the shorter horror version (EROTIKLL), in which Irina draws her liquid substance from more conventional parts of the human anatomy.\n\nSpecial features:\n\nMastered in HD from the original film elements\n\nFrench with optional English subtitles or English dubbed\n\nExtended erotic version: Female Vampire (100 minutes)\n\nStandard horror version: Erotikill (70 minutes, English only)\n\n“Destiny in Soft Focus: Jess Franco Remembers Female Vampire”, a new documentary by Elijah Drenner and David Gregory.\n\n“Words for Lina”, a tribute by co-star Jean-Pierre Bouyxou,produced by Daniel Gouyette.\n\nOriginal theatrical trailer\n\nFilm details:\n\nSpain 1973 Colour 88 min 2.35:1\n\n1920 x 1080p Not rated\n\nDirected by Jess Franco\n\nProduced by Marius Lesoeur\n\nScreenplay by Jess Franco and Gérard Grisseau\n\nDirector of Photography: Jess Franco\n\nMusic by Daniel White\n\nWith Lina Romay, Jack Taylor, Alice Arno,Jess Franco, Monica Swinn,Jean-Pierre Bouyxou\n\nProduced for video by Bret Wood"
