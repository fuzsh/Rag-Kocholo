        "text": "Born 100 years ago today, singer and actress Maria Elena “Lina” Romay (1919-2010).\n\nThe daughter of a Mexican diplomat, Romay grew up in Brooklyn and Los Angeles, where she first sang with Horace Heidt’s band, billed as a French singer named “Josette”. Staring in 1940 she fronted Xavier Cugat’s Latin orchestra, where her ability to sing in both Spanish and English proved an asset. (One of her signature numbers was “Babalu” — prior to Desi Arnaz’s popularization of the tune.) She sang with Cugat’s band on his NBC radio program, and also made guest appearances on the radio shows of Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, and Jack Benny.\n\nWith Cugat’s band, she was also seen in Hollywood movies like You Were Never Lovelier (1942), Stage Door Canteen (1943), The Heat’s On (1943), The Two Girls and a Sailor (1944), Bathing Beauty (1944), Weekend at the Waldorf (1944), and This Time It’s for Keeps (1947). During the World War II years she was a popular pin-up model and toured with the U.S.O.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1952 Romay became a regular on Paul Whiteman’s Goodyear Revue (a tv variety show). There were also appearances on The Milton Berle Show, The Saturday Night Revue with Jack Carter, The Steve Allen Show, The Alan Young Show, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, and The Red Skelton Hour, among other programs.\n\nAs an actress, Romay appeared in the films Adventure (1945), Love Laughs at Andy Hardy (1946), Honeymoon (1947), Embraceable You (1948), Joe Palooka in the Big Fight (1948), The Big Wheel (1949), The Lady Takes a Sailor (1949), Flamingo Road (1949), and The Man Behind the Gun (1953), as well as the 1949 short subjects Six Gun Music, Cheyenne Cowboy, and Senor Droopy.\n\nRomay’s last professional screen credits were in 1957. By then she had married the very well-heeled Jay Gould III. Although she made occasional public appearances from time to time.\n\nThen, oddly, someone stepped in to fill the vacuum…and add to the confusion, and in Romay’s case, probably consternation. Starting in 1972, a Spanish film actress named Rosa María Almirall Martínez began billing herself as Lina Romay, when she wasn’t billing herself as Lulu Laverne or Candy Coster. More concerning, most of these films were low-budget exploitation, horror, and sex excursions, the bulk of them directed by her lover and later husband Jesus Franco. It was more of an homage than an appropriation, really, more in the spirit of Mario Montez than of mendacity. The younger Romay was only to outlive the original one by a couple of years."
