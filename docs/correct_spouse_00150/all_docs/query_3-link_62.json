        "text": "In 1982 – a year in which he reportedly shot 13 films – writer/director Jess Franco created THE HOUSE OF LOST WOMEN, a blithely twisted drama that is equal parts Buñuelian black comedy, over-the-top soap opera, and furiously perverse sex shocker. Starring the director’s muse Lina Romay as a pensive young nymphomaniac whose life on a remote island with her father, stepmother, and mentally-challenged sister seethes with violence, incest and some of the most degenerate scenarios of the entire Franco canon. In what could pass as an early film from Pedro Almodóvar (an admitted fan of this film and its director), Jess Franco makes one of the most fiercely angry and shockingly hilarious films of his career, one that extends forth to the work of filmmakers like John Waters and Todd Solondz, while simultaneously being one of the most handsomely mounted productions in his canon.\n\nIn Spanish with English subtitles. Scanned uncut from the original negative. Part of Francomania, a never-ending tour celebrating writer/director Jess Franco, presented by Severin Films and Chicago’s Oscarbate Film Collective.\n\nGet there early! Severin Films will have a pop-up shop in the lobby before the screening, starting at 6:30pm.\n\nAt the close of the ‘70s, eminent auteur Jess Franco revisited the works of the Marquis de Sade to create what EuroSleaze historians have called one of the most sexually daring and boldly creative films of his entire career, SINFONÍA ERÓTICA (EROTIC SYMPHONY). When an unstable noblewoman (a fearless performance by Lina Romay) returns to her lavish estate, she will find herself – along with her libertine husband, his male lover, and a young nun with a craving for violation – trapped in a web of unholy hungers and decadent perversions. Susan Hemingway co-stars in this sonata of artsy depravity, featuring a darkly psychedelic score by Franco & Franz Liszt. Reality and fantasy will blur within the confines of this zany haunted house, one that will at times leave the viewer, along with the characters, unsure of what they are witnessing.\n\nIn Spanish with English subtitles. Transferred in 4k from an uncut 35mm print donated by The Instituto de la Sexualidad Humana in Madrid. Part of Francomania, a never-ending tour celebrating writer/director Jess Franco, presented by Severin Films and Chicago’s Oscarbate Film Collective.\n\nGet there early! Severin Films will have a pop-up shop in the lobby before the screening, starting at 6:30pm."
