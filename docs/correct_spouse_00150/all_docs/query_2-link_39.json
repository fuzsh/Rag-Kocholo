        "text": "Obviously opinions differ as to the merits of his body of work overall, but at his best Franco was a really terrific filmmaker. I'll happily defend titles like The Sadistic Baron von Klaus, Venus in Furs, Eugenie: The Story of Her Journey into Perversion, 99 Women, Eugenie de Sade, A Virgin Among the Living Dead, etc. against easy criticism. Terrific films, all.\n\nRIP, Mr. Franco.\n\nJess Franco films were largely unavailable in watchable versions until DVD. I had to check him out, was initially confused, and now own 60+ (or approx 1/3) of the man's output. If you are looking for production value, good taste or common sense of any kind keep looking. With all of their peaks and valleys, these films are really one long perverse fever-dream. I think his best stuff is sexy and funny. He was often inane and lazy. I think he was an artist but the small group of us who feel that way are obsessives. He was certainly an iconoclast who spent his life committing his demented fantasies to film because he had to, not for the $ or even the respect, which came late. RIP to one of a kind.\n\nHe was looking pretty bad in a recent interview I saw, so I wouldn't be surprised if the news is true. Still, living 82 years and directing nearly 200 films is a pretty good run. I have about 43 of his films on DVD at the moment, even though a lot of them are pretty awful. RIP\n\nHeck I would even list Count Dracula as among his better films\n\nLove his comments in the YouTube video--he stated he hadn't made good films just some more disgusting than others.\n\nI'm not surprised. I figured when Lina Romay died, it wouldn't be long before Jess passed away.\n\nI wasn't a fan of most of his stuff from the last couple of decades, but he did some really good horror/sex/exploitation films in the 60s and 70s. While the bulk of Franco's filmography is an acquired taste, I think \"The Awful Dr. Orloff\" is a fantastic film by any measure.\n\nRIP Jess.\n\nActually, I think Franco is fast becoming one of the best represented directors on Blu-Ray, and certainly was on DVD. Redemption Films announced in February that they will be releasing 14 more Franco titles on Blu-Ray, and there have been significant releases of rare Franco titles by Mondo Macabro in the past year - with more to come. Indeed, with all the attention by Blue Underground (and others) to Franco titles over the past 5-10 years, a solid chunk of his filmography is certainly out there.\n\nAlong with mute henchmen, crash zooms and Howard Vernon perpetually loitering in the background?\n\nCritics be damned. He was a unique filmmaker and a true renaissance man. He made some terrible films (and some I never want to see), but his best are unlike any other director: ORLOFF, VENUS IN FURS, 99 WOMEN, EUGENIE, AL OTRO LADO DEL ESPEJO and many more. Give his detractors an ulcer by reminding them he did 2nd unit work for Orson Welles.\n\nJust heard about his passing and coincidentally, this week I watched \"EUGENIE\", \"WOMEN BEHIND BARS\" and a couple of later ones \"TENDER FLESH\" & \"LUST FOR FRANKENSTEIN\" all for the first time.\n\nThose later shot on video titles were hard to get through but the earlier two were both pretty good for vintage Franco.\n\njust came across this.very depressing.maybe i can find a zoom lens to play with and that will cheer me up.will never forget the first time i saw barbed wire girls and i kept thinking who in the hell made this film its insane.at least he is with lina romay now and they are more than likely filming something.i wish i could see it.\n\nSeverin Films recently released a BR/DVD combo pack of The Hot Nights of Linda, and the first 2,500 copies contain a bonus disc featuring the hardcore French version of the film. It's a limited edition, so Franco fans should make sure to grab a copy before they disappear! (I just got one this weekend).\n\nA bit of Franco news that I'm *not* so pleased about, however, is Redemption's upcoming release of The Demons (1972), which is apparently Blu-Ray only.... no separate DVD edition or even a combo pack.\n\nThe only thing that really hindered the film was budget constraints. The cast is excellent, and Franco maintains the right mood, but some of the effects are pretty dire.\n\nTowers may have given Franco some of his biggest budgets, but they were still relatively small."
