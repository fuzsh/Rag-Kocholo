        "meta_description": "Long-time companion and muse of Spanish director Jess Franco, Lina Romay, has died at the young age of 57. Romay acted primarily in the films of Franco, and although her acting talents weren’t celestial, she had a certain animal magnetism on screen, had no qualms about bearing all, and had a strong cult following among fans of the erotic (or, to borrow a Japanese term that doesn’t quite work for her films, but gets the idea across, ero guro). Sadly, this is the second time director Franco has had to suffer the loss of his partner/collaborator, as his one-time lover and muse Solidad Miranda died at the tender age of 27 in 1970. Romay starred in dozens of porn film, both soft and hard, but will probably be best remembered for her horror and action films (see link for titles).",
