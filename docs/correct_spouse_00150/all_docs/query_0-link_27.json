        "text": "Directed by: Jess Franco\n\nCountry: Spain, 1983\n\nColor / 2.4:1 widescreen\n\nLanguage: Spanish with optional English subtitles\n\nRunning Time: 104 minutes + Extras\n\nOther titles: Mil sexos tiene la noche\n\nRegion: All\n\nIn this surreal and sensuous mystery/noir, Lina Romay (Female Vampire, Lorna the Exorcist) plays Irina, a partner in a male-female mind reading act. At night she experiences vivid and sexually charged dreams which end in murder. It seems that the people whose minds she reads are being killed off one by one.\n\nIn the 1980s after the death of the Spanish dictator, Jess Franco returned to his native country and made a series of films in which he was given almost total freedom, so long as they featured a number of erotic sequences. Night Has a Thousand Desires is one of the most artistically successful of these films. It's filled with familiar Franco touches – artful cinematography, atmospheric locations, naked women, an avant garde soundtrack – and it features one of Lina Romay's most committed performances.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\nBrand new HD transfer from film negative\n\nInterview with Stephen Thrower (33 minutes)\n\nThe Diabolical Mr. Franco - Eurotika! TV episode on Franco (25 minutes)\n\nBrand new cover art by Justin Coffee\n\nMondo Macabro previews\n\nCast:\n\nLina Romay, Daniel Katz, Carmen Carrion, Mamie Kaplan, Alicia Principe, José Llamas, Mauro Rivera, Albino Graziani."
