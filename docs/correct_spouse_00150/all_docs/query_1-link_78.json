The film's plot follows Ilsa, a warden at a psychiatric hospital for young women, and a girl who feigns illness so that she can investigate what happened to her sister who stayed at the hospital. Ilsa, the Wicked Warden contained scenes of graphic violence, which writer Ric Meyers commented was \"sicker\" than its predecessor in its depictions. Meyer also opined that the movie had been filmed at the same time as Franco's Barbed Wire Dolls due to the shared cast and setting of the two movies.\n\n3\n\nJesús Franco, Lina Romay, Paul Muller\n\nReleased : 1976\n\nDirected by : Jesús Franco\n\nFrauengefängnis is a 1975 Swiss horror film directed by Jesus Franco.
