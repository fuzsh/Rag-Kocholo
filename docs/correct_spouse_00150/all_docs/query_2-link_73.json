        "text": "In his study of Jess Franco's work, Stephen Thrower describes the sex in Cries of Pleasure as often playing the role of a \"purgatorial rite, obsessively repeated but forever failing to deliver an 'ultimate' experience.\" It's a prefect characterization of what we witness, and the reason that a film almost entirely devoted to sex in various combinations is ultimately more sad that erotic, and exhausting rather than titillating.\n\nDrawing from Franco's usual collection of tropes and sources — mute servant, submissive girl, Sadean ambitions and manipulations — the film brings them together in an isolated, cliffside villa, occupied by a cast of five. Four of them — all but the nonspeaking manservant, who characterizes himself in a voiceover as playing…\n\n“Debauchery, without limits.”\n\nThe insatiable urge to fuck, to torture, to kill, turns out to be a nightmare for the perpetrator too. Meanwhile pleasure shades into paroxysms indistinguishable from sickness.\n\n— Stephen Thrower, Flowers of Perversion\n\nAntonio in a messy quadruple with 1) Julia, the young Berber girl from North Africa he adopted into his home and raped at age twelve 2) Marta, his pretty live-in maid, and 3) Martina, his beautiful wife just released from her stay in an sanitorium where she was treated for nymphomania.\n\nI’m not sure the more enduring image from Cries of Pleasure, one of the twelve films Jess Franco shot in 1982: three tongues kissing, or Antonio Mayans getting his face sat upon by…\n\nThe Year/s of Franco #108\n\nWow. See this is why you really have to sift through the dregs of Franco's filmography. You never know what will drift to the surface. I was beginning to give up hope at this stage in the game then suddenly, Cries of Pleasure, easily the most effective of his Sadean forays, and one of his finest accomplishments from a technical perspective. A wonderful 80s Franco discovery.\n\nAntonio Mayans is the master of a seaside villa who imagines himself the heir of a 'chosen race' to whom all is permitted for the sake of pleasure. He brings his new lover Lina Romay home to meet his wife and maid, and very early in the piece he…\n\nFranco’s hypnotic, Sadean orgy of betrayal and limitless debauchery is arguably one the most disturbing films he’s made, which is a real compliment in my book as 70% of this film is a darkly-toned, softcore fuckfest yet Jess manages to perfectly pull off an uneasy and bleak atmosphere through the writing, cinematography and a beautiful score that is both relaxing but unsettling.\n\nWith the minimalism turned up, the film takes place in a beautiful seaside villa, with 5 characters and very little cuts. The camera gazes and drifts back and forth while a nightmarish orgy unfolds. The dialogue is kept to a minimum as well after the first half sets the story up, but there’s some inner pieces of dialogue…"
