        "text": "Jesus Franco, who has died aged 82, was named in the Guinness Book of Records as the most prolific film director in the world, with nearly 200 features to his name, principally in the horror and sexploitation genres and often resembling comic strips for adults.\n\nIn the 1970s, during which he made 67 films, he was condemned by the Vatican as the director whose films were most dangerous to Catholics, along with Luis Bunuel. One reference book alleged he was “both the most prolific and the worst horror director of all time”. When asked if he really had made 10 films in one year, he replied: “Not really, not 10 – seven or eight, perhaps.”\n\nThe reason for his work rate was that he eschewed conventional camera set-ups in favour of constantly zooming in and out of scenes, often while his actors remained stationary. As a result, shots were sometimes out of focus, and his work betrayed very little grasp of narrative structure, or pace. In El Sexo Esta Loco (1980), Franco included footage of himself giving the actors instructions; and in Juego Sucio En Casablanca (1984) he left in a scene where a member of the public walks into shot. “Dream-like” and “hypnotic” were adjectives often used by his defenders.\n\nFranco's cinematic universe featured scantily-clad girls dancing erotically in nightclubs while men in tinted glasses look on; female vampires wearing only capes, belts and thigh-high boots; close-ups of scorpions and snakes; and mute henchmen named Morpho, sometimes played by himself. He nearly always made cameo appearances, and was a diminutive, unmistakable figure, with the moustache of a Civil War general.\n\nPreferring to work from his own rough notes rather than from a camera script, Franco regularly served as his own cameraman and composed his own scores, having formerly been a jazz trumpeter. He would sometimes shoot several films at once – on the budget for one. Les Avaleuses (1975) exists in four different versions and under nine other titles.\n\nHe began his pan-European career due to the censorship imposed by General Francisco Franco, his namesake. The nearest he came to the mainstream was in nine nominally British co-productions, in the late 1960s and early '70s, for the producer Harry Alan Towers. The Blood of Fu Manchu (1968) and The Castle of Fu Manchu (1969) proved to be the last in Towers' series starring Christopher Lee as the fiendish Oriental villain. Towers recalled telling his director: “ 'Jess, you've done something there that nobody else has achieved.' 'What's that?' he asked. 'Killing Fu Manchu', I said.”\n\nAdapting a favourite author, Franco proved unable, or unwilling, to curb Jack Palance's overacting in Marquis De Sade: Justine (1968). Lee returned for The Bloody Judge (1969), as Judge Jeffreys, and in the title role of Count Dracula (1970), publicised as the most faithful adaptation from Stoker, but only in that the Count began as elderly and became younger. After filming two days of linking scenes, in a smoking jacket, for another Sadean excursion, Philosophy in the Boudoir (1969), the future Sir Christopher was displeased to see it advertised at an Old Compton Street sex cinema six months later.\n\nDennis Price, once the elegant protagonist of Kind Hearts and Coronets, demonstrated toe-sucking skills in Venus in Furs (1969), which Franco claimed was inspired by a conversation with fellow jazz musician Chet Baker. Part of the soundtrack from Vampyros Lesbos (1971), again with Price, was used by Quentin Tarantino in Jackie Brown (1997), and in a 2000 commercial for Strongbow cider.\n\nJesus Franco Manera was born on May 12, 1930 in Madrid, to a Cuban father and Mexican mother. He studied at L'Instituto de Investigaciones y Experiencias Cinematograficas, but was expelled in his second year “for unknown reasons”. His first film as director and screenwriter was an innocuous comedy, Tenemos 18 Anos (1959). More in character was his mad doctor tale, Gritos En La Noche (1962), given the English-language title The Awful Dr Orloff. His most important assignment was the second unit in Orson Welles' Chimes at Midnight (1966).\n\nNecronomicon (1967), shown in America and Britain as Succubus, sparked world interest. From 1973 he shared his life with Lina Romay, an avowed exhibitionist who would star in many of his films as their sexual content increased. She was a conspirator in his plunge into hardcore, following a return to Spain in 1978. They provided their unique take on the soap operas Dynasty and Falcon Crest, in Phollastia, with Lina Romay as “Jean Collins”, and Falo Crest (both 1987).\n\nAn attempt by Franco to edit together Welles' unfinished Don Quixote was judged unsuccessful when shown at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival. Al Pereira vs the Alligator Ladies, shot in HD, received its premiere two weeks before his death.\n\nA gourmet who did not stint on entertaining his cast and crew, Franco received an honorary Goya award in 2009. He and Lina Romay eventually married in 2008, but she died last year. A previous marriage ended in 1996.\n\nTelegraph, London"
