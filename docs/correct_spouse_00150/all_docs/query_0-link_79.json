        "text": "Easily one of the best-looking films to come out of Jess Franco’s creatively wealthy ‘Golden Films Internacional’ period, La Mansión de los Muertos Vivientes is an odd cocktail of adult comic book imagery, gorgeous seaside panoramas, mild horror and crude sex comedy, all wrapped in dense supernatural atmosphere.\n\nFour waitresses/strippers arrive in a seaside hotel on a mission to get laid. Ignoring the tell-tale signs of being unwelcome (such as someone throwing a meat cleaver at them from a balcony) they continue on their search for orgasms, which leads them straight into the clutches of zombie monks who inhabit a nearby monastery.\n\nWhen finally given an English-friendly DVD release (courtesy of Severin), La Mansión de los Muertos Vivientes was presumably easier to market than many other Golden Films titles due to some minor parallels it has with Amando de Ossorio’s celebrated “Blind Dead” films. Yet it would be too easy to label La Mansión de los Muertos Vivientes an unofficial sequel to or a ripoff of the Blind Dead saga. While indeed outwardly somewhat akin to de Ossorio’s dead horsemen, Jess Franco’s horny, satan-worshiping living dead seem fashioned after resurrected monks rather than knights. Still, this formal similarity to the Blind Dead films has prompted a good few genre fans who normally stir clear from Franco to watch and comment on La Mansión de los Muertos Vivientes, making it one of his more-celebrated ’80s titles. There are many reviews of La Mansión de los Muertos Vivientes online, comparing the film unfavourably to the Blind Dead films. What the critics may not realise is that by mid-1980s the Spanish Blind Dead films have long run their course, with the fourth and final installment dated 1975. It’s therefore somewhat unlikely that Jess Franco would see commercial potential exploiting De Ossorio´s zombie Templar mythos with then-trending cannibal and slasher films offering riper opportunities for cashing in.\n\nAntonio Mayans gives one of his very best performances for Jess Franco as Carlo(s) Savonarola, the hotel’s twisted psychopathic manager, who happens to be a reincarnation of a 18th century inquisitor. The final scene between Lina Romay and Antonio Mayans is at once confusing and touching in the best Franco tradition. Feature-length running time is achieved thanks to some extended softcore lesbian encounters. This fixation with filming simulated sex would become all-encompassing in Franco’s later digital works.\n\nApt at making his locations appear secluded, Jess Franco frames the hotel and the nearby monastery in such a fashion as to suggest complete isolation. Some tourists do wander into frame now and again, though. La Mansión de los Muertos Vivientes boasts some enjoyably atmospheric sequences, which clash with the deliberately cheesy and broadly exaggerated scenes of the semi-nude waitresses exploring the eerily deserted hotel corridors longing for a shag.\n\nThe waitresses are presented as decidedly two-dimensional over-sexed dolls who chatter on and on about how horny they are. Portrayal of men as rapists and oppressors and women as giggly sex machines seems to be the norm in Franco’s adult comic book universe. The hotel manager (Mayans) keeps his crazy wife chained up naked in one of the rooms, starving her half to death. Perversely, when discovered by Lina Romay, the wife doesn’t wish to be freed, wistfully reminiscing of being treated like a dog and occasionally as a sex doll by her psycho husband instead, citing violent sex as her only pleasure. With all characters as caricatures and a general ‘anything goes’ tone, La Mansión de los Muertos Vivientes has a lot in common with the chaotic Al Pereira VS the Alligator Ladies, down to some similar absurdist scenes at the hotel reception.\n\nScarce on zombie attacks but full of stunning imagery and moments of unexpected serene beauty, La Mansión de los Muertos Vivientes has a lot to offer to less bloodthirsty viewers.\n\nPointless mild erotica to some, a delicate, precious invocation of a dream state to others, Mil sexos tiene la noche is a thing in itself. Sharing the cast with Historia sexual de O and unfolding in the familiar environs of hotel rooms and balconies, Mil sexos tiene la noche is one of Jess Franco’s more inspired attempts at blending minimalism, sex and hysteria while catering to erotic cinema market. This broadly outlined tale of possession and murder begins with Daniel Katz and Lina Romay performing a magic number in what must be a hotel lounge. It is established that the two have a psychic link. Soon the passionate, vulnerable Lina falls victim to her own craving for affection before delving into the world of sexy hallucinations and ultimately becoming a living instrument of murder.\n\nLina Romay is the absolute, unquestionable star of Mil sexos tiene la noche, her hypnotic presence forever burned into the celluloid. Jess Franco spares no film capturing his muse in and out of colourful dresses. The Fulci-style extreme closeups of Lina’s eyes are some of the most gorgeous sights Franco’s insatiable lens has ever caught.\n\nLina’s partner, Daniel Katz is given the distinct voice of Antonio Mayans, which classifies Mil sexos tiene la noche as another one of the ‘Candy Coster y Robert Foster’ series of films. With his physical presence limited to just two brief (but very important) scenes, Jess Franco reigns supreme on the voice track – apart from dubbing some peripheral characters, the exploitation film prodigy has contributed to the ecstatic, distorted moans and chants which accompany the film’s lengthy dream sequences.\n\nMil sexos tiene la noche has got a surpisingly elaborate soundscape. With the extremely stylized, ritualistic mise en scene, the sound is your guide to the Kaleidoscope of colours. Daniel White’s Female Vampire score , re-used in numerous films, truly belongs in this context and helps bring out new shades of the typically Franco thematic obsessions.\n\nWhen judged against the early ’70s capers The Devil Come from Akasava or Der Todesrächer von Soho , Mil sexos tiene la noche is slow, but compared to Flores de Pasión or Paula-Paula it moves at positively breakneck speed (what good are these comparisons, anyway?).\n\nJess Franco doesn’t create a believable character you’re meant to identify with. He amuses himself with creating an elaborate environment, a certain atmosphere – and invites you to take a dip in it. Mil sexos tiene la noche is unmistakably Jess Franco territory, where characters can be found lounging in bed leafing through a paperback edition of Necronomicon while puffing on a cigarette as the azure waves lap the sun-drenched sandy shores beyond the panoramic windows. With Jess Franco you’re not following a story – you’re inside the film, exposed to patterns and shapes, at the mercy of morphing splotches of saturated colours and blurry lights. Shots of a helicopter flying through the sky seem to function here in the same way images of a billowing kite did in the more celebrated Vampyros Lesbos.\n\nThe above text is meant as a review of Mil sexos tiene la noche but it’s likewise a fairly valid description of a good number of Jess Franco’s more personal features. Best Jess Franco films are veritable fountains of creative inspiration. Describing a Franco film is like trying to describe smoke rising from a cigarette, a rolling wave, or a dream you’d had: an exercise in futility. It’s infinitely preferable to watch even just fifteen minutes of any Jess Franco film then to read a review, no matter how well-reserached. Seemingly made in a single breath, Mil sexos tiene la noche is there for anyone attuned enough to pick up its otherworldly frequency. Continue reading “Mil sexos tiene la noche / Night of 1,000 Sexes (Jess Franco, 1984)” →\n\nNot a good film for newcomers into Jess Franco territory, Lilian is low-budget drama and cheap porno flick stitched into one. The thin storyline centers around a German teenager (Katia Bienert) falling into the clutches of two sadistic fiends (Lina Romay and Emilio Linder) while vacationing in Spain and the film is made to run feature-length via inclusion of several lengthy hardcore sex scenes. The most interesting scenes involve actor/production manager Antonio Mayans (once again playing a Pereira) and Franco himself as they listen to the dying Lilian’s story and argue whether to go against a high-up government official to avenge the girl. Lina Romay as the fiendish Irina dons the red wig also seen in El Mirón y la Exhibicionista and gives it all in her acting scenes as well as in the sex scenes with José Llamas.\n\nLilian is an oddity, switching abruptly at even intervals between serene vistas such as the opening credits scene, dreamlike flashbacks depicting Lilian’s initiation into the world of vice and graphic XXX scenes, often shot in clinical close-up. The effect is confusing, offensive and intriguing in equal measure.\n\nKatia Bienert looks awfully young (much too young for the part!), and suitably innocent as Lilian. Her screen time is limited and she doesn’t get an awful lot to do, except get molested by the predatory duo of Lina Romay and Emilio Linder before relating her misfortunes to Mayans and Franco. The wraparound story of a dying girl telling of her suffering is reminiscent of Franco’s Soledad Miranda vehicle, the excellent Eugenie De Sade.\n\nDaniel White is present both on- and off-screen in Lilian with his cues from Sadomania, Female Vampire and other works laid over the sex scenes in an indiscriminate fashion. Jess Franco’s longtime collaborator takes on a role of a corrupt government official to who Antonio Mayans’ justice-seeking provincial cop turns for help before taking the law into his own hands. White is subdued and pensive in his part, unlike his googly-eyed turn in Diamonds of Kilimandjaro, again with Katia Bienert.\n\nMade presumably around the same time as El Hundimiento de la Casa Usher ( judging from the use of the same cast and Antonio Mayan’s look), Lilian gives Jess Franco another opportunity to play around with space. At times he flattens the image with his zoom lens, other times he achieves an almost 3D effect when a wide-angle, hand-held camera is exploring the villa’s premises. Unlike the majority of Golden Films productions, Lilian isn’t shot in Techniscope, but it’s a well-composed and stylish picture all the same. Skilled at using natural light and picturesque locations to maximum effect, Franco and cinematographer Juan Soler make the most of their resources, with many shots achieving an abstract quality. This personal style transcends the cheapness and shortcomings of the story, giving Lilian a unique look. Were it not for the porn scenes, Lilian could have been a minor classic.\n\nJess Franco’s decision to shoot additional sex inserts may have made business sense at the time of the film’s production, when there was a demand for hardcore features, but it ultimately hurts the film, which had a lot of potential as a low-key drama. If shorn of the revolting hardcore content, Lilian would have made a beautiful, lyrical short about corrupted innocence. Alas, Lilian (la virgen pervertida) remains another curious, tantalising patchwork film from the ever-erratic Jess Franco.\n\nLilian is available via a Spanish kiosk DVD in a decent-quality non-anamorphic presentation.\n\nWelcome to the sleepy, vague, lurid and confusing universe of Jess Franco’s 1980s Spanish productions.\n\nNot enough has been written about La Noche de Los Sexos Abiertos online.\n\nShot, like the rest Golden Films Productions, in Techniscope with the Canary Islands as a suitably lush backdrop, La Noche de Los Sexos Abiertos is very representative of Franco’s style at the time. Extreme closeups of unshaven genitals, seaside panoramas, misogynistic violence, amusing dialogues, hard-boiled cinema tropes and crude comedy co-exist more or less peacefully in this extremely low-budget softcore crime film produced for Spain’s then-burgeoning erotic film market.\n\nThe film’s strange title (Night of the Open Sexes) refers to a secret code which a mustachioed P.I. Al Crosby (played by the excellent Antonio Mayans) is trying to crack with the aid of a nymphomaniac stripper (Jess Franco muse and erotic cinema legend Lina Romay) in an attempt to uncover a stash of Nazi gold. The Third Reich treasures would also feature as a McGuffin in Jess Franco’s better-known and much-criticized Eurociné production, Oasis of the Zombies (1982). Antonio Mayans is great as the sleazy, unscrupulous private eye, a role he would reprise numerous times for Jess Franco, including his very last features, Al Pereira vs. The Alligator Ladies and Revenge of the Alligator Ladies. Bit part actor Albino Graziani of whom little is known and whose filmography is limited almost exclusively to Jess Franco films, plays the dying general who Lina Romay tricks into disclosing the whereabouts of the treasure. Jess Franco himself appears in an amusing cameo as a tied and gagged proprietor of a villa where the protagonists shack up while trying to crack the code.\n\nWith very little information available on La Noche de Los Sexos Abiertos online, it is helpful to view the film in the context of other ‘Golden Films Internacional s.a.’ productions made by Jess Franco around the time. Granted miniscule budgets and skeleton crews, Jess Franco would turn out around twenty feature films between 1982 and 1986 , known as his Golden Films period. Characterized by languid pacing, limited casts and competent, if somewhat subdued camerawork,Golden Films productions have not yet been embraced by Jess Franco fans at large for a number of reasons. Small-scale, and very slow-paced when compared to Franco’s celebrated early ’70s works, these low-budget gems had for a long time been unavailable in English friendly editions.\n\nThe situation has changed somewhat thanks to Severin Films’ excellent presentations of some of the key titles from the period, including La Mansión de los Muertos Vivientes and Macumba Sexual. These top-quality releases revealed the astonishingly beautiful imagery Jess was able to capture when allowed to do his thing unburdened from ‘name’ actors and without pressure from the backers. Hypnotic, minimalist imagery in Mil Sexos Tiene La Noche (in need of an English-subtitled release) or La Mansión de los Muertos Vivientes belongs to the finest achievements of the often misjudged filmmaker. Criticized for their lack of substance and reliance on protracted scenes of simulated sex, Golden Films productions may be too mild and dull for those craving gory, titillating Eurotrash. Often co-starring Lina Romay (as Candy Coster) and Antonio Mayans (Robert Foster), some of these marginal works function as remakes or follow-ups to Franco films of the previous decades: the excellent El Siniestro Doctor Orloff is one of the most original installments in the long-running Dr. Orlof series, Macumba Sexual follows the basic plot of the cult favourite Vampyros Lesbos, while Eugenié (Historia de una perversión) is yet another stab at De Sade´s Philosophy in the Boudoir. Erratic zooms, out-of-focus shots, and uncertain pans which are so characteristic of Franco’s smaller-scale productions are all but absent here, with very carefully executed compositions, expert use of natural light and predominantly static camerawork. Actors Albino Graziani and Tony Skios (Antonio Rebollo) show up almost invariably in the Golden Films productions. Mixing crude humour, rudimentary special effects, static camerawork and often steeped in profound melancholy, Golden Films represent perhaps the most challenging and least explored chapter in Jess Franco’s mammoth filmography."
