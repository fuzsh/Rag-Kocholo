        "text": "Spanish actress\n\nThis article is about the Spanish actress. For the Mexican-American singer of the same name, see Lina Romay (singer).\n\nRosa María Almirall Martínez (25 June 1954 – 15 February 2012), known by the stage name Lina Romay, was a Spanish actress and filmmaker. She often appeared in films directed by her long-time companion, and later husband, Jesús Franco. She appeared in approximately 109 Franco films made over a 30-year period, from 1973 to 2010. She sometimes used the pseudonyms Candy Coster and Lulu Laverne. Although Romay was listed in the credits of several of Franco's films as a co-director, actor Antonio Mayans stated in a recent interview that Franco used to credit her in that manner for business reasons, and that she never actually co-directed any of the films. However, she contributed occasional plot ideas and assisted in the editing room.[1]\n\nRomay was born Rosa María Almirall Martínez in Barcelona in 1954. After graduating high school, she studied the arts, married actor/photographer Ramon Ardid (aka Raymond Hardy), and began acting in stage productions.\n\nShe began appearing in Jesús Franco's films when they met in 1972, adopting the stage name Lina Romay after an actress and jazz artist from the 1940s (who only died in 2010).[2]\n\nHer husband Ramon Ardid was working for Franco as a still photographer at the time, and she met Franco through him. She acted in over a hundred feature films, most directed by Franco. The majority of their films together were in the erotic film genre (including many X titles featuring unsimulated sex scenes)[3][4], but she also appeared in many of his horror, comedy, and action/adventure films as well. Among the better known of her horror films are The Bare Breasted Countess (1973), Barbed Wire Dolls (1975) and Jack the Ripper (1976). Ardid co-starred with her in several of Franco's films until he realized she was having an affair with Franco in 1975. Romay and Ardid finalized their divorce in 1978, and Ardid stopped working with Franco after 1980.\n\nLina Romay and Jesús Franco lived as a couple for almost four decades but only officially married on 25 April 2008.[5] She died from cancer at the age of 57 on 15 February 2012 in Málaga, Spain. Franco died soon after in 2013.\n\nThe Erotic Rites of Frankenstein (1972), a.k.a.
