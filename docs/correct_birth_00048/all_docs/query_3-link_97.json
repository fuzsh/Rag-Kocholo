        "text": "I have seen some great content in my life, but an 87-year-old man recreating a music video and killing it just might be at the top of my epic things to watch list.\n\nAs I was scrolling social media, I came across a video of an elderly man doing what seemed to be dancing. I turned the sound on and was instantly intrigued. This was content I really wanted to watch. When I heard Usher’s “Yeah”, I had to not only watch this, but to go back to Usher’s original video, and the similarities were on point. They even went as far as to have his leading lady in the video and when I say she killed it, she KILLED it. From the dancing to the free flow of movement, she had it down-packed.\n\nAs a DJ, it’s very important that I stay up to date on new, yet trending music. I frequently check Shazam charts by not just cities, but also by genre. Shortly after Usher’s halftime performance, I’m going through my normal routine. I check Shazam charts starting by city. Not realizing the timing of it all, Usher’s “Yeah” was literally number one across the country on the Shazam charts. It made me wonder if it could really be that either people forgot about this song, or if there were indeed a lot of people that did not know the song.\n\nUsher: Artists He Should Bring Out At The 2024 Super Bowl\n\nEither way it goes this was pretty dope to watch. I’ll include Usher’s original video to watch first and the recreation second. I hope you all enjoy this as much as I did. They nailed this all the way down to the outfits! Way to go!\n\nWhether it's radio or TV, there is someone needed who can add the bang for the buck! Vonyetta is double that bang.
