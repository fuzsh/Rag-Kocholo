        "text": "Usher has been calling Jenn Goicoechea ‚ÄúMy Boo‚Äù for at least five years‚Äîand now he can officially call her his wife.\n\nThe eight-time Grammy winner officially wed his longtime girlfriend in a surprise Las Vegas wedding, which happened to fall on the same day as his Super Bowl LVIII halftime performance. The intimate 30-person ceremony took place at Vegas Weddings‚Äô Terrace Gazebo, with Usher‚Äôs mom, Jonnetta Patton, serving as the witness, People reported.\n\n‚ÄúWe can confirm that Usher and Jennifer Goicoechea took the next step in their relationship and did get married on Sunday night in Las Vegas, surrounded by close friends and family,‚Äù the singer‚Äôs rep told People. ‚ÄúThey both look forward to continuing to raise their children together, surrounded by love, and thank everyone for the well-wishes.‚Äù\n\nLike the ‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù hitmaker, Goicoechea is in the music industry and has been making her own waves on the R&B and hip-hop scene for years. The power couple‚Äôs romance is truly the product of love songs, from their very first photo together, in 2016, to the birth of their second child, in 2021.\n\nIn November 2023, Usher gushed about his relationship with Goicoechea to People, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very happy, very fortunate to have an incredible friend, not just a partner. She‚Äôs my best friend and I love her.‚Äù\n\nRead on for everything we know about Goicoechea.\n\nShe works in the music industry, too.\n\nGoicoechea is a Miami native born to an Italian mother and a Puerto Rican father. She studied recording arts at Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida, and got a taste of the entertainment industry when she shadowed her mom, who was director of operations at global production agency ACT Productions. That led to her landing a job as an assistant for Grammy-winning singer Ciara.\n\nFrom there, Goicoechea moved to California and opened Boogs‚ÄôN‚ÄôEffect Management. In 2014, she became the director of the Rhythm & Soul (Urban) division at ASCAP; she joined Sony Music Entertainment‚Äôs Epic Records, where she currently works, as senior vice president of A&R in 2016. In 2020 and 2021, she was recognized as one of Billboard‚Äôs R&B/Hip-Hop Power Players. Throughout her career, she has worked with big names including Stunna Girl, DJ Khaled, and 21 Savage.\n\nJenn and Usher have known each other a long time.\n\nWhile it remains a mystery just how the two became acquainted, they have known each other for quite some time. Goicoechea first shared a photo of herself and the singer in 2016; in it, she is seen whispering in his ear. ‚ÄúNot sure what I‚Äôm saying or who I‚Äôm speaking too üôÑüòÇ But my nails look good üíÖüèºüòú,‚Äù she wrote in the caption.\n\nShe shared another photo of herself with Usher in 2018, this one captioned, ‚ÄúBoys Club.‚Äù\n\nThe pair sparked rumors of romance when they were photographed together at record producer Keith Thomas‚Äôs birthday celebration in Atlanta in June 2019. They sealed the deal a few months later, when they were photographed kissing backstage at the Hollywood Bowl in October 2019. And they made their official debut in December 2019, when they attended Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs‚Äôs birthday in Los Angeles, where Usher was performing.\n\nThey have two kids.\n\nGoicoechea and Usher welcomed their first child, daughter Sovereign Bo, on September 24, 2020. The singer commemorated the news with an Instagram photo of her tiny baby hand wrapped around his fingers, captioned, ‚ÄúWe are feeling blessed and full of love with the arrival of our beautiful baby girl, Sovereign Bo Raymond. ‚ÄòIsn‚Äôt She Lovely‚Äô by Stevie Wonder on repeat.‚Äù\n\nAlmost exactly a year later, Goicoechea gave birth to their second child, a boy named Sire Castrello. Once again, Usher took to Instagram, posting a close-up of his son‚Äôs face with the caption ‚ÄúHi my name is Sire Castrello Raymond ‚Ä¶ I am the newest addition to the Raymond crew. I was born Sept 29 2021 at 6:42pm weighing 7lbs 13oz. Hear me roar ‚Ä¶ A.K.A Ra Ra .üë∂üèΩ ‚ôéÔ∏èGang #demraymondboys.‚Äù\n\nUsher also shares two sons with ex-wife Tameka Foster: Usher ‚ÄúCinco‚Äù V, 16, and Naviyd Ely, 15."
