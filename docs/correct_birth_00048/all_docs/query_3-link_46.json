        "text": "With eight GRAMMYs, over 65 million albums sold, and nine Billboard Hot 100 No. 1s, Usher is undoubtedly one of the biggest stars of his generation. And 20 years after his diamond-certified magnum opus, 2004's Confessions, the 45-year-old triple threat is reminding fans and critics alike that he's still got it.\n\nIn the midst of his highly successful (and twice-extended) Las Vegas residency, Usher was announced as the 2024 Super Bowl halftime show headliner, coinciding with the Feb. 9 release of Coming Home — his first solo studio album in eight years. On paper, Usher is the perfect halftime performer that checks all the boxes: the voice, the choreography, the stamina, the hits, the charm. If his electrifying appearance alongside the Black Eyed Peas' 2011 performance is any indication of how Feb. 11 will go, it's bound to be one for the books.\n\nSuper Bowl halftime shows usually last around 13 minutes, but for an artist of Usher's caliber, the high-stakes performance is over 30 years in the making. In 1991, a 13-year-old Usher appeared on Star Search, which led to an audition with LaFace Records. While singing Boyz II Men's \"End of the Road,\" he displayed his knack for captivating an audience even way back then, before appearing on the soundtrack for the 1993 film Poetic Justice starring Janet Jackson and Tupac.\n\nHis debut single, \"Call Me a Mack,\" mostly flew under the radar at the time, though his star power gleamed in the accompanying video. In the decades since, Usher's eight albums and 16 No. 1 hits on Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart have helped him earn the unofficial title of \"The King of R&B,\" paving the way for other household names like Chris Brown, Trey Songz, Ne-Yo, and protégé Justin Bieber.\n\nThough the aptly titled Coming Home marks his first solo album since 2016's Hard II Love, he's continued to whet fans' appetite with several one-off singles, including \"Bad Habits\" and \"Glu.\" For the lead single from Coming Home, \"Good Good,\" he recruited Summer Walker and 21 Savage, signaling a new chapter for the music veteran. Following his announcement, Usher described the forthcoming LP as a body of work that not only honors his legacy, but tells \"a story that is open to interpretation and that will connect with people in different ways.\"\n\nAs the world awaits Usher's Super Bowl halftime show and new music, GRAMMY.com is revisiting 15 songs that made him a force to be reckoned with in entertainment.\n\n\"You Make Me Wanna,\" My Way (1997)\n\nThree years after his 1994 self-titled debut album failed to garner much attention, Usher crashed the second half of the decade with his breakout hit \"You Make Me Wanna.\" Inspired by the then 19-year-old's real-life experiences of juggling multiple women, he sings frankly about being stuck in a love triangle: \"You make me wanna leave the one I'm with/ Start a new relationship wit' you.\"\n\nPeaking at No. 2 on the Hot 100, \"You Make Me Wanna\" set Usher's career ablaze as the lead single off 1997's seven-time-platinum My Way album — helping him stand out among a sea of fellow R&B newcomers, including Joe and Ginuwine.\n\nIn 1998, the success of \"You Make Me Wanna\" also earned Usher his first-ever GRAMMY nomination for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance. That same year, he was chosen as Janet Jackson's opening act for the U.S. leg of her Velvet Rope Tour, setting a precedent for the show-stopping performances he's since become known for.\n\n\"Nice & Slow,\" My Way (1997)\n\nSo many of Usher's best songs focus on the art of lovemaking, but \"Nice & Slow\" is notable as his first No. 1 on the Hot 100 — and for cementing his sex symbol status.\n\nOnly 20 years young at the time, Usher delivers suggestive lyrics (e.g., \"I got plans to put my hands in places/ I never seen, girl you know what I mean\") with such bravado that it's easy to mistake the then-budding entertainer for someone twice his age.\n\nMoments before laying down the sensual track, producer Jermaine Dupri set out to create a \"ballad that's gonna knock out the world,\" he said in 2003's The Billboard Book of Number One Hits. Over 25 years later, \"Nice & Slow\" is still quintessential Usher, as it gave way to a long string of slow jams like \"Do It To Me\" and \"Climax\" that make the ladies swoon.\n\n\"Bedtime,\" My Way (1997)\n\nAround the release of Confessions, Usher declared himself a \"sexaholic\" (which he later refuted). But the hearthrob's sexual appetite first appeared on his album My Way, as evidenced by one of the LP's closing tracks, \"Bedtime.\" In the opening line, he sings, \"Craving your body all through the night/ Feels like I'm going through withdrawals.\"\n\nPenned by R&B mastermind Babyface, the number is structured a little bit like a lullaby but isn't as captivating as \"Nice & Slow.\" Still, it earns a spot on this list for being one of the very first in his catalog to ooze grown and sexy vibes.\n\n\"U Remind Me,\" 8701 (2001)\n\nKicking off his now-iconic 8701 era, \"U Remind Me\" follows Usher as he falls for a girl who resembles his ex, but ultimately decides against dating her for that very reason.\n\nProduced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, \"U Remind Me\" shares similarities to \"You Make Me Wanna\" as both songs center around inner conflict, but the most noticeable difference is the vocal delivery. His runs and ad-libs carry more weight in \"U Remind Me,\" which also charted higher internationally. According to what Jimmy Jam told MTV at the time, the goal was for \"people to hear Usher sing and go, 'This boy can sing. He's a singer.'\"\n\nBecoming his second No. 1, \"U Remind Me\" paid off critically for him as well, earning the child prodigy his first GRAMMY for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 2002.\n\n\"U Got It Bad,\" 8701 (2001)\n\nAfter \"U Remind Me,\" Usher slowed things down with his third chart-topper, \"U Got It Bad,\" which is believed to be about then-girlfriend, Rozanda \"Chilli\" Thomas of best-selling female group TLC, who also stars in the accompanying video.\n\nInterpolating Prince's \"Adore\" and Maxwell's \"Fortunate\" from 1987 and 1999, respectively, \"U Got It Bad\" finds Usher struggling to accept that he's fallen deep for someone, a slow-burning feeling intensified by a guitar solo that soars midway through. The smoldering track showcased that he was a fully developed star capable of conveying emotion in addition to crafting tunes that fill the dance floor.\n\n\"Yeah!\" feat. Lil Jon and Ludacris, Confessions (2004)\n\nUsher was at his commercial peak when he tried his hand at crunk music à la \"Yeah!\" with Lil Jon at the helm. Somewhat of a catalyst for his foray into EDM (more on that later), \"Yeah!\" marked the first of four consecutive No. 1s off Confessions and Usher's longest-running chart-topper at 12 weeks. Naturally, it was crowned the most-played song of 2004 despite the label's hesitation to release it as a lead single.\n\nOf all of Usher's party anthems, \"Yeah!\" wins for holding its relevance 20 years later; to this day, it remains a staple at wedding receptions, sporting events, and countless other celebrations. Plus, Ludacris' scene-stealing guest verse, where he rhymes \"ridiculous\" and \"conspicuous,\" is forever etched in our memory.\n\nIn 2005, Usher added to his GRAMMY collection after \"Yeah!\" took home Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. It was such a smash that \"Ursher, Jon and Luda had to do it again\" in 2004's \"Lovers and Friends,\" which narrowly missed the No. 1 spot, and then again with \"SexBeat\" in 2020.\n\n\"Burn,\" Confessions (2004)\n\nTrue to the diaristic nature of Confessions, \"Burn\" sees Usher grappling with the aftermath of a failed relationship. \"Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to/ Got somebody here, but I want you/ 'Cause the feelin' ain't the same/ Find myself callin' her your name,\" he laments in the second verse.\n\n\"Yeah!\" took Usher's stardom to the next level, but \"Burn\" gave fans a deeper glimpse into his personal life. By then, his two-year relationship with TLC's Chilli had run its course. As Usher noted himself to MTV News, \"It's unfortunate when you have to let a situation go because it's not working. Although you may want to stay, you've got to let it burn.\"\n\nThat level of vulnerability resonated with broken hearts everywhere; \"Burn\" dethroned \"Yeah!\" when it skyrocketed to the No. 1 spot on the Hot 100. Subsequently, Usher held the No. 1 and 2 spots on the chart, becoming the first artist to achieve such a major feat since the Beatles 40 years earlier.\n\n\"Confessions Part II,\" Confessions (2004)\n\nWhile \"Burn\" saw Usher pulling back the curtain, he left it all on the table in one of the most talked about songs of his three-decade career: \"Confessions Part II.\"\n\nIn \"Part I,\" he sings about having a \"chick on the side,\" but \"Part II\" marks the point of no return as he confesses to impregnating his mistress. As expected, \"Confessions\" sparked rumors that Usher got another woman pregnant while dating Chilli. In reality, it was recorded before their breakup and based on Jermaine Dupri's situation. Still, Usher delivers the story as if it was his own.\n\nEven though \"Confessions Part II\" revolves around infidelity, it's difficult to not feel sympathetic toward him as the track winds down: \"This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do/ To tell you, the woman I love/ That I'm havin' a baby by a woman that I barely even know/ I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this,\" he says in the spoken interlude.\n\n\"My Boo\" feat. Alicia Keys, Confessions (2004)\n\nUsher and Alicia Keys were both at the top of their game when they joined forces for \"My Boo,\" an ode to young love that's guaranteed to make you cry nostalgic tears of joy. Even the most cynical hearts can't resist singing along: \"I don't know about y'all, but I know about us and, uh/ It's the only way we know how to rock,\" a twenty-something Usher croons in the outro.\n\nThe romantic duet is even sweeter when you realize that Usher and Keys have known each other since they were teenagers. Their undeniable musical chemistry won a GRAMMY for Best R&B Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocals.\n\nAt the time of its release, \"My Boo\" went straight to No. 1, which means he spent an astonishing 28 weeks atop the Hot 100 in 2004, proving that the year unequivocally belonged to none other than Usher.\n\n\"Bad Girl,\" Confessions (2004)\n\n\"Caught Up\" was the final single off of Confessions, but Usher's reign could have carried well into 2005 and possibly even '06 if deep cuts like \"Throwback,\" \"Superstar,\" \"Can U Handle It?\" and \"Bad Girl\" were released as singles. The latter appears as a snippet in the beginning of the music video for \"My Boo,\" leaving you wanting more.\n\nIn \"Bad Girl,\" Usher prefers women who look \"fresh out of Elle magazine\" and can buy their \"own bottles.\" Fueled by hypnotic electric guitar riffs, \"Bad Girl\" exemplifies his fondness for a late-night rendezvous: \"Look at them bad girls moving it/ Making faces while they doing it/ Ah, I want to take one to the restroom/ So close, I'm smelling like your perfume,\" he sings in the second verse.\n\nThe song also took on a life of its own when Usher performed it at a 2005 concert special with Beyoncé, who steals the show without ever touching the mic.\n\n\"Best Thing\" feat. Jay-Z, Here I Stand (2008)\n\nWhen \"Best Thing\" arrived, Usher and Jay-Z were both newlyweds. So, of course, Usher was feeling particularly inspired by then-wife Tameka Foster.\n\nRecorded during Hov's Heart of the City Tour, \"Best Thing\" celebrates commitment over \"trickin' and kissin' miscellaneous chicks.\" Of the song's background, Usher reportedly said, \"If you are a playa, you're a playa. If you're a real man, you're a real man, but you know you got to — in some point in life — you've got to grow up. Grow away from certain immaturities.\"\n\nHe and Foster divorced the next year, but \"Best Thing\" speaks to something bigger: the beginning of his transition into manhood.\n\n\"OMG\" feat. will.i.am, Raymond v. Raymond (2010)\n\nWith easygoing lyrics like \"I fell in love with shawty when I seen her on the dance floor/ She was dancing sexy, pop-pop-popping, dropping, dropping low,\" \"OMG\" sounds like a continuation of \"Yeah!\" but with hints of Eurodance.\n\nWritten and produced by Black Eyed Peas frontman will.i.am, \"OMG\" gave Usher's post-Confessions career a much-needed boost. Despite spawning the No. 1 single \"Love in This Club,\" his previous studio effort, 2008's Here I Stand, was deemed a commercial disappointment.\n\nAlthough \"OMG\" was criticized for Usher's use of auto-tune, the party classic thrusted him back to the top. What's more, he displayed a willingness to reinvent himself at a time when EDM started to infiltrate the charts. It not only became Usher's ninth No. 1 hit, but it produced his first of four entries on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart, while paving the way for his other dance-pop hits like Pitbull-featuring \"DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love\" and \"Without You\" with David Guetta.\n\n\"Numb,\" Looking 4 Myself (2012)\n\nAt first listen, \"Numb\" may sound like just another synth-heavy banger about leaving your troubles on the dance floor, but the song is actually a well-crafted culmination of what was going on behind the scenes for the R&B superstar.\n\nIn the years leading up to his seventh album, Looking 4 Myself, Usher experienced some turbulent times. Months before their divorce, Tameka Foster went into cardiac arrest prior to undergoing cosmetic surgery (depicted by scenes of Usher comforting a woman in the hospital in the accompanying video for \"Numb\"). A couple years later, fans booed him after he walked off stage mid-show in Berlin. Then, in the midst of a highly publicized custody battle with Foster, his 11-year-old stepson died after a tragic jet ski accident.\n\nIn true Usher fashion, he sang and danced through the pain: \"Keep on doing the same old thing/ And you expecting change/ Well, is that really insanity/ Or just a losers' game?\" he ponders in the second verse.\n\nStalling at No. 69 on the Hot 100, \"Numb\" is one of Usher's lowest-charting songs — but along with \"Sins of My Father,\" which deals with breaking generational curses, it spotlights his depth as an artist.\n\n\"Tell Me,\" Hard II Love (2016)\n\nUsher set out to make music he wanted to with 2016's Hard II Love. Though it marked his first album to miss the top spot in eight years, the 15-track LP is a welcome return to his R&B roots. He does just that in \"Tell Me,\" a nearly nine-minute carnal extravaganza that acts as the album's centerpiece and encompasses the physical, emotional, and spiritual connection between two lovers.\n\nAt face value, \"Tell Me\" boasts Usher's endurance in the bedroom, but on a deeper level, it's about intimacy — an element missing from a great deal of today's R&B, especially from the male perspective. His golden falsetto shines through, making eight and a half minutes sound like the sweetest serenade.\n\n\"Boyfriend\" (2023)\n\nLast summer, things got interesting when Keke Palmer stopped by Usher's acclaimed Vegas residency, where she was serenaded by the \"There's Goes My Baby\" singer. Seen by millions, the lighthearted moment turned negative when Darius Jackson, the father of Palmer's child, publicly shamed her for the sheer outfit she wore to the show.\n\nBut in the name of entertainment, Usher seized the moment, flipping the controversy into a new earworm. Adding fuel to the fire, Palmer stars in the video, which appears to be filmed in Vegas. And the lyrics are as cheeky as they come: \"Somebody said that your boyfriend's lookin' for me/ Oh, that's cool, that's cool/ Well, he should know I'm pretty easy to find/ Just look for me wherever he sees you.\"\n\nThe stunt jokingly earned Usher the nickname \"Domestic Terrorist,\" but more importantly, it illustrated his power to still generate buzz as a well-established artist amid the rise of R&B's new class comprising younger male singers like Steve Lacy, Jvck James, Brent Faiyaz, and Lucky Daye.\n\nThirty years after his debut, Usher proves he's the last of his kind with the voice, sales, and stage presence to back it up. In a recent interview with Vogue, he described his highly anticipated Super Bowl performance as a \"celebration for everybody, for all of us, from the beginning up until this point.\"\n\nIt'll be the single biggest showcase of his career, but judging by his showmanship, he'll meet the moment while reminding the world of his greatness as a new, exciting era begins — one that demonstrates he's still at the top of his game.\n\nJustin Timberlake's Biggest Songs, From His Best *NSYNC Moments To The Solo Smashes\n\nIf you were online during the summer of 2022, chances are you’ve heard Pheelz’s viral hit single \"Finesse.\" The swanky Afro-fusion track (featuring fellow Nigerian artist Bnxn) ushered in a world of crossover success for Pheelz, who began his career as a producer for the likes of Omah Lay, Davido, and Fireboy DML.\n\nBorn Phillip Kayode Moses, Pheelz’s religious upbringing in Lagos state contributed to his development as a musician. He manned the choir at his father’s church while actively working on his solo music. Those solo efforts garnered praise from his peers and music executives, culminating in Pheelz's debut EP in 2021. Hear Me Out saw Pheelz fully embrace his talent as a vocalist, songwriter, and producer.\n\n\"I feel important, like I’m just molding clay, and I have control over each decision,\" Pheelz tells GRAMMY.com about creating his own music.\n\n2022 saw the release of the first two tapes in his Pheelz Good trilogy: Pheelz Good I and Pheelz Good (Triibe Tape), which was almost entirely self-produced. The 29-year-old's consistency has paid off: he produced and sang on Usher’s \"Ruin,\" the lead single from his latest album Coming Home, and also produced the album's title track featuring Burna Boy. But Pheelz isn't only about racking up big-name collaborators; the self-proclaimed African rockstar's forthcoming projects will center on profound vulnerability and interpersonal honesty. First up: Pheelz Good II EP, out May 10, followed by a studio album in late summer.\n\nBoth releases will see the multi-hyphenate \"being unapologetically myself,\" Pheelz tells GRAMMY.com. \"It will also be me being as vulnerable as I can be. And it’s going to be me embracing my \"crayge\" [crazy rage]...being myself, and allowing my people to gravitate towards me.\"\n\nAhead of his new project, Pheelz spoke with GRAMMY.com about his transition from producer artist, designing all his own 3D cover art, his rockstar aesthetic, and what listeners can expect from Pheelz Good II.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity.\n\nWhat sparked your transition from singing in church to realizing your passion for creating music?\n\nFor me, it wasn’t really a transition. I just always loved making music so for me I felt like it was just wherever I go to make music, that’s where I wanna be. I would be in church and I was the choirmaster at some point in my life, so I would write songs for Sunday service as well. And then I would go to school as well and write in school, and people heard me and they would love it. And I would want to do more of that as well.\n\nA friend of my dad played some of my records for the biggest producers in Nigeria back then and took me on as an intern in his studio. I guess that’s the transition from church music into the industry. My brothers and sisters were in the choir, but that came with the job of being the children of the pastor, I guess. None of them really did music like me; I’m the only one who took music as a career and pursued it.\n\nYou made a name for yourself as a producer before ever releasing your music, earning Producer Of The Year at Nigeria’s Headies Awards numerous times. What finally pushed you to get into the booth?\n\nI’ve always wanted to get into the booth. The reason why I actually started producing was to produce beats for songs that I had written. I’ve always been in the booth, but always had something holding me back. Like a kind of subconscious feeling over what my childhood has been. I wasn’t really outspoken as a child growing up, so I wouldn’t want people to really hear me and would shy away from the camera in a sense. I think that stuck with me and held me back.\n\nBut then COVID happened and then I caught COVID and I’m like Oh my god and like that [snaps fingers] What I am doing? Why am I not going full steam? Like why do I have all this amazing awesomeness inside of me and no one gets to it because I’m scared of this or that?\n\nThere was this phrase that kept ringing in my head: You have to die empty. You can’t leave this earth with all of this gift that God has given you; you have to make sure you empty yourself. And since then, it’s just been back-to-back, which just gave me the courage.\n\nHow did you react to \" Finesse\" in former President Barack Obama’s annual summer playlist in 2022?\n\nBro, I reacted crazy but my dad went bananas. [Laughs.] I was really grateful for that moment, but just watching my dad react like that to that experience was the highlight of that moment for me. He's such a fan of Barack Obama and to see that his son’s music is on the playlist, it just made his whole month. Literally. He still talks about it to this day.\n\nExperiences like that just make me feel very grateful to be here. Life has really been a movie, just watching a movie and just watching God work and being grateful for everything.\n\nAt first he [my dad] [didn’t support my career] because every parent wants their child to be a doctor, a lawyer, or an engineer. But when he saw the hunger [I have], and I was stubborn with [wanting] to do music, he just had to let me do it. And now he’s my number one fan.\n\nYour latest single, \"Go Low\" arrived just in time for festival season. What was it like exploring the live elements of your art at SXSW and your headlining show in London at the end of April?\n\nI have always wanted to perform live. I’ve always loved performing; Pheelz on stage is the best Pheelz. Coming from church every Sunday, I would perform, lead prayers and worship, so I’ve always wanted to experience that again.\n\nHaving to perform live with my band around the world is incredible man. And I’ll forever raise the flag of amazing Afro live music because there’s a difference, you know? [Laughs.] There are so many elements and so many rhythms and so many grooves\n\nI’ve noticed that much of your recent cover art for your singles and EPs is animated or digitally crafted. What’s the significance, if any, of this stylistic choice?\n\nIt still goes back to my childhood because I wasn’t expressive as a child; I wouldn’t really talk or say how I felt. I’d rather write about it, write a song about it, write a poem about it, or draw about it. I’d draw this mask and then put how I’m feeling into that character, so if I was angry, the mask would be raging and just angry.\n\nThe angry ones were the best ones, so that stuck with me even after I started coming out of my shell and talking and being expressive; that act of drawing a mask still stuck with me. And then I got into 3D, and I made a 3D version of the mask and I made a 3D character of the mask. So I made that the main character, and then I just started making my lyric videos, again post-COVID, and making them [lyric videos] to the characters and making the actual video mine as well.\n\nIn the future, I’m gonna get into fashion with the characters, I’m gonna get into animation and cartoons and video games, but I just wanna take it one step at a time with the music first. So, in all of my lyric videos, you get to experience the characters. There’s a fight [scene] among them in one of the lyric videos called \"Ewele\"; there is the lover boy in the lyric video for \"Stand by You\"; there are the bad boys in the lyric video for \"Balling.\" They all have their own different characters so hopefully in the near future, I will get to make a feature film with them and just tell their story [and] build a world with them. I make sure I put extra energy into that, make most of them myself so the imprint of my energy is gonna be on it as well because it’s very important to me.\n\nYou and Usher have a lengthy working relationship. You first performed together in 2022 at the Global Citizen Festival, then produced/co-wrote \"Coming Home\" and \"Ruin.\" Take us through the journey of how you two began collaborating.\n\nIt started through a meeting with [Epic Records CEO] L.A. Reid; he was telling me about the album that they were working on for Usher and I’m like, \"Get me into the studio and lemme see what I can cook up.\" And they got me into the studio, [with Warner Records A&R] Marc Byers, and I wrote and produced \"Coming Home.\" I already had \"Ruin\" a year before that.\n\n[\"Ruin\"] was inspired by a breakup I just went through. Some of the greatest art comes from pain, I guess. That record was gonna be for my album but after I came home I saw how L.A. Reid and Usher reacted and how they loved it. I told them, \"I have this other song, and I think you guys would like it for this album.\" And I played \"Ruin,\" and the rest was history.\n\nBefore your upcoming EP, you’ve worked with Pharrell Williams, Kail Uchis, and the Chainsmokers in the studio. What do you consider when selecting potential collaborators?\n\nTo be honest, I did not look for these collabs. It was like life just brought them my way, because for me I’m open to any experience. I’m open to life; I do it the best I can at any moment, you understand?\n\nHaving worked with Pharrell now, Dr. Dre, Timbaland, and the Chainsmokers, I’m still shocked at the fact that this is happening. But ultimately, I am grateful for the fact that this is happening. I am proud of myself as well for how far I’ve come. Someone like Timbaland — they are literally the reason why I started producing music; I would literally copy their beats, and try to sound like them growing up.\n\n[Now] I have them in the same room talking, and we’re teaching and learning, making music and feeding off of each others’ energy. It’s a dream come true, literally.\n\nWhat's it like working with am electro-pop group like the Chainsmokers? How’d you keep your musical authenticity on \"PTSD\"?\n\nThat experiment [\"PTSD\"] was actually something I would play with back home. But the crazy thing is, it’s gonna be on the album now, not the EP. I would play it back home, like just trying to get the EDM and Afrohouse world to connect, cause I get in my Albert Einstein bag sometimes and just try and experiment. So when I met the Chainsmokers and like. \"Okay, this is an opportunity to actually do it now,\" and we had a very lengthy conversation.\n\nWe bonded first as friends before we went into the studio. We had an amazing conversation talking about music, [them] talking about pop and electronic music, and me talking about African music. So it was just a bunch of producers geeking out on what they love to do. And then we just talk through how we think the sound would be like really technical terms. Then we get into the studio and just bang it out. Hopefully, we get to make some more music because I think we can create something for the world together.\n\nI’ve noticed you dress a bit eccentrically. Have you always had this aesthetic?\n\nI’ve always dabbled in fashion. Even growing up, I would sketch for my sister and make this little clothing, so like I would kick up my uniform as well, make it baggy, make it flare pants, make it fly.\n\nI think that stuck with me until now, trying different things with fashion. And now I have like stylists I can talk to and throw ideas off of and create something together. So yeah, I want to get into the fashion space and see what the world has in store for me.\n\nWhat can fans expect as you’re putting the finishing touches on your upcoming EP Pheelz Good II and your album?\n\nPheelz Good II, [will be] a close to the Pheelz Good trilogy of Pheelz Good I, Pheelz Good Triibe Tape and Pheelz Good II. The album is going to be me being unapologetically myself still. But it will also be me being as vulnerable as I can be.\n\nIt’s going to be me embracing my crayge [crazy rage]. Like just embracing me unapologetically and being me, being myself, and allowing my people to gravitate towards me, you get me. But I’m working on some really amazing music that I am so proud of. I’m so proud of the EP and the album.\n\nMr. Eazi’s Gallery: How The Afrobeats Star Brought His Long-Awaited Album To Life With African Art\n\n\"All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets,\" Usher told MTV News while promoting his 2004 album, Confessions. \"I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of.\"\n\nHe sure wasn't kidding. The concept album, and loosely based around his relationship with TLC's Rozonda \"Chilli\" Thomas — essentially played out like a prime-time soap opera set to music. But its brutally honest narrative and earworm hooks connected like no other contemporary R&B record before or since, solidifying Usher as one of music's modern greats.\n\nIn fact, Confessions was the second-best selling album of the 2000s (only behind *NSYNC's 2000 juggernaut, No Strings Attached), thanks in part to four consecutive Billboard Hot 100 chart-toppers and a string of attention-grabbing videos that allowed Usher to showcase his skills as a singer, dancer, actor, and all-round loverman.\n\nJust after delivering a career-defining Super Bowl halftime show performance, Usher celebrates 20 years of Confessions on March 23. To commemorate the anniversary, here's a look at why Confessions remains the R&B scene's definitive blockbuster.\n\nIt Saved The Record Industry\n\nThanks to the rise in illegal downloads and decline of \"Total Request Live\"-friendly blockbusters, the music industry began 2004 staring down a fourth consecutive year of declining sales. Step forward their savior, Usher Raymond IV.\n\nConfessions shifted a colossal 1.1. million copies in its first week, the highest number since Eminem's The Eminem Show in 2002, and didn't stop selling. By the end of December, its total had ballooned to nearly eight million — double its closest competitor, Norah Jones' Feels Like Home, to become the year's biggest commercial smash.\n\nUsher's magnum opus was widely credited with getting the American public back into record stores again, resulting in a 1.6 percent increase in overall album sales. But Confessions' journey wasn't done there. In 2012, it was awarded diamond status, joining TLC's CrazySexyCool and Boyz II Men's II as the only R&B representatives in the exclusive club, with its current tally now reportedly standing at 18 million!\n\nIt Invented Crunk&B\n\nCrunk, an energetic form of southern hip-hop defined by its 808 basslines, kick drums, and general party-starting vibes, originated in the mid-1990s. But it took nearly a decade for the sound to crossover from the Miami underground to the top of the charts. And then the lead single from Confessions took the scene to another level.\n\nWith its high-pitched synth hook, emphatic beats, and hype man chants from the subgenre's self-proclaimed king Lil Jon, \"Yeah!\" had all the hallmarks of a crunk classic. But Usher's smooth, soulful tones and Ludacris' playful rhymes gave the dance floor anthem a much stronger melodic edge, prompting critics to coin a new term, Crunk&B.\n\nSeveral artists took note of the crunk and contemporary R&B crossover, with both Ciara's \"Goodies\" and Chris Brown's \"Run It\" also topping the Hot 100. But \"Yeah!\" remains the sound's crowning glory, as proven by the diamond status it achieved right before Usher's Super Bowl halftime show (Usher is also now only the third ever Black artist to have a diamond-certified single and album, alongside Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston).\n\nIt Further Bridged The Gap Between R&B And Hip-Hop\n\nWhile previous albums Usher, My Way, and 8701 had all been grounded in slick, soulful R&B, Confessions was a concerted attempt to bridge the gap between his signature sound and the grittier world of hip-hop. The man himself admits that he took just as much inspiration from Eminem and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony as his usual suspects, like Michael Jackson and James Brown, to create an album that was aimed equally at the bedroom and the clubs.\n\nAlongside the famous guest appearances from Lil Jon and Ludacris, the LP also drew upon the production talents of Roc-A-Fella regular Just Blaze. Meanwhile, on the special edition, Jadakiss laid down some bars on \"Throwback,\" while the remix of \"Confessions Part II\" boasted rhymes from Shyne, Twista, and Kanye West.\n\nThat's not to say thatNot that Usher forgot his roots, though., Has proven by his collab with Keys (\"My Boo\"), recruitment of legendary producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and contributions from long-time collaborators Jermaine Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox all helped remind of his R&B prowess. \"I feel like it is the base of everything,\" Usherhe said about his love of R&B at the time. \"I want to make it more prominent.\"\n\nIt Was A GRAMMY Favorite\n\nAlthough Ray Charles posthumously won the most awards of the night, the 2005 GRAMMYs undoubtedly still belonged to Usher. The R&B star not only took home three golden gramophones, but he also brought the house down thanks to a spellbinding duet with the Godfather of Soul.\n\nA sharp-suited Usher first took to the stage for an epically choreographed performance of Confessions' fifth single \"Caught Up,\" before James Brown — who even at the age of 71 still had several moves of his own — popped up for a joint rendition of his classic, \"Sex Machine.\"\n\nUsher was no doubt in a celebratory mood. By this point, he'd picked up three of the eight categories he'd been nominated in: Best Contemporary R&B Album, Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Yeah!,\" and Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal alongsideAlicia Keys for \"My Boo.\" (As of press time, Usher has won eight GRAMMYs and received 23 GRAMMY nominations.)\n\nIt Brought A Confessional Side Back To R&B\n\nFrom Marvin Gaye's Here, My Dear to D'Angelo's Brown Sugar, some of the greatest R&B records of the 20th century resulted from artists baring their souls as if their lives depended on it. This was an approach that had largely fallen by the wayside as time went on, with some suggesting that the genre gradually became more emotionally stunted.\n\nUsher, on the other hand, had no qualms whatsoever about laying it all on the line, namely the ups and downs of his relationship with Thomas. On the falsetto-voiced \"Burn,\" he willingly displays devastation over his breakup (\"I'm twisted 'cause one side of me's telling me that I need to move on/ On the other side I wanna break down and cry\"). And even by the penultimate track, \"Take Your Hand,\" he still seems to be in a state of torment (\"In your loving, every time I feel your touch/ Second thoughts, more doubts started building up\").\n\nUsher's confessional approach continued in 2008 with Here I Stand's love letter to then-wife Tameka Foster and then again in 2010 with the divorce-themed Raymond vs. Raymond. And many other R&B artists, including Janelle Monae and Beyoncé, have since made career bests by delving similarly deep into their personal lives.\n\nIt Inspired A Generation Of R&B Lotharios\n\nThink of any R&B lothario who's emerged in the last 20 years and chances are they've been heavily inspired by Confessions. Jason Derulo has said as much, describing it as a \"classic album\" and \"just start to finish awesome\"; Ne-Yo echoed that sentiment to BBC Radio 1, calling it \"flawless top to bottom.\" While Bryson Tiller explicitly told Fuse he wanted to make a record in the same vein. And you can hear its influence in everything from Drake's more romantic offerings to August Alsina's intimate revelations.\n\nAnd 10 years after Robin Thicke co-penned and co-produced Confessions' sensuous bedroom jam, \"Can U Handle It,\" he released his own breakup tale with 2014's Paula. Though he hasn't ever explicitly cited Confessions as an influence, Paula is a concept album about Thicke's real-life marriage breakdown, which essentially doubled up as a begging letter to his estranged wife.\n\nIt's A Storytelling Masterclass\n\nIn 2023, it was announced that an untitled drama series inspired by Usher's back catalog was in the works. No doubt that the project, said to be \"about Black love in Atlanta and individuals looking to find a place to call home,\" will draw heavily upon the storytelling masterclass that is Confessions.\n\nTake \"Truth Hurts,\" for example, the relationship tale in which Usher initially presents himself as the wounded party before revealing that he was, in fact, the one being adulterous (\"I've been blaming you when I'm the one that's doing wrong/ I'ma go on/ My guilty conscience is the real reason I wrote this song\").\n\nUsher also appeared to enjoy keeping audiences guessing about whether his confessions were truly autobiographical or borrowed from the album's male-centric production team. See the two title tracks, which suggested the lothario had himself become a father following a one-night stand, when in reality, the paternity drama was all Dupri's.\n\n\"We wanted the media to ask us questions,\" the latteradmitted to Vibe in 2014, citingMichael Jackson as a key attention-grabbing influence. \"Nobody knows who the f— Billie Jean is. We're still looking for her.\"\n\nIt Helped Breathe New Life Into Several Soul Classics\n\nWhile much of Confessions was interested in pushing R&B forward, it wasn't entirely averse to getting a little nostalgic. The record is filled with cleverly chosen samples from the soul of yesteryear, from Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes' \"Is There a Place for Me\" on \"Take Your Hand\" to Willie Hutch's Mack's Stroll on \"Superstar\" and Preston Love's \"Chili Mac\" on \"Whatever I Want.\"\n\nAnd nearly 20 years before Doja Cat repurposed a Dionne Warwick classic to chart-topping effect on 2023's \"Paint the Town Red,\" Usher brought the Motown legend into the contemporary R&B world by borrowing from \"You're Gonna Need Me\" on the aptly titled \"Throwback.\"\n\nIt Broke Multiple Chart Records\n\nYou know an artist has reached true greatness when they start being mentioned in the same breath as The Beatles. In 2004, Usher became the first act since the Fab Four to have both the biggest and second biggest-selling singles of Billboard's year-end chart with \"Yeah!\" and \"Burn,\" respectively. And this was far from the only major milestone Confessions achieved.\n\nUntil Taylor Swift's Fearless spent an additional fortnight in the top spot in 2009, the album's nine weeks atop the Billboard 200 was the longest run of the millennium. And with \"Confessions Part II\" also reaching No. 1 on the Hot 100 (ironically, replacing \"Burn\"), Usher not only became the first artist in history to achieve three consecutive chart toppers, but also the first act to spend more than half a calendar year atop the Hot 100 at 28 combined weeks.\n\nTwenty years on, Confessions is still the highest-selling record by a Black artist this century. And further exemplifying his staying power and impact across the globe, Usher will soon embark on a lengthy world tour that has sold out from Brooklyn to Berlin — a momentous way to honor the album that changed the R&B game.\n\n24 Songs Turning 20: Listen To 2004's Bangers, From \"Yeah!\" To \"Since U Been Gone\"\n\nIn the days leading up to Usher’s Super Bowl performance, the singer waxed poetically about the significance of this moment not only in popular culture but for Black music.\n\nSpeaking with Kelly Carter on \"Good Morning America,\" Usher reflected on the history of Black entertainers who performed for the masses under restrictive laws. Although a majority of those laws have been overturned, it would be remiss to not think about the recent series of court cases that have targeted Black musicians, such as Atlanta-based rapper Young Thug, whose music is currently being used against him in court.\n\nFor singers like Usher who have been privy to the ways in which Black music — and those who create it — have been mistreated, his halftime performance was as much as a statement as it was a tribute to those who came before him. \"I'm coming through the front door with this one,\" Usher told Carter.\n\nIt is only fitting that the performance opened with lines from \"My Way\" — the title of his Las Vegas residency, which has featured a who’s who of prominent figures in pop culture — before launching into \"Caught Up.\" Usher then descended from his anointed throne in a crisp, all white Dolce & Gabbana ensemble, he began a Michael Jackson-inspired dance routine with an array of backup dancers; the standout being renowned celebrity choreographer Sean Bankhead.\n\nUsher made it clear early on, however, that his performance was no mere spectacle. He paused to deliver a testimony, one that bears repeating despite his new album and $100 million-earning Vegas residency: \"They said I wouldn't make it, they said I wouldn't be here today, but I am.\"\n\nOnce the air cleared and Usher thanked his momma for her steadfast advocacy and faith in him, he led Allegiant Stadium in a sing along of \"Superstar.\" The track from 2004’s Confessions recently inspired a viral challenge on TikTok.\n\nA consummate performer and supporter of his peers, Usher wasn't content to simply highlight his own success. The singer transformed Allegiant Stadium to \"The Yard\" — the singular place at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, where students gather to talk, discuss, and have fun — and filled it with music.\n\nUsher’s Yard included a performance of \"Love In This Club\" with the assistance of two members of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc., the second oldest Black fraternity in the U.S. The trio was supported by the Jackson State University marching band, known as the \"Sonic Boom of The South,\" to finish the song.\n\nEven his brief moment of affection with singer Alicia Keys, who joined the singer for \"My Boo,\" can be described as a \"homecoming hug.\" Homecoming is another HBCU tradition, where alumni convene at their respective campuses and greet their former flame with a hug.\n\nWhen Jermaine Dupri entered the stage to announce the 20th anniversary of Confessions, the transportation was complete. The audience was no longer in Vegas, but in Atlanta, the Black Mecca of the world. And Usher is Atlanta’s nucleus.\n\nIt is here that the spirits of Michael Jackson, Marvin Gaye, and Prince accompanied Usher as he bewitched millions with a singular microphone and momentum stage presence. A haze of purple clouds and smoke led the way for singer H.E.R., the night’s self appointed \"Bad Girl\" and her crew of roller skating baddies.\n\nWhile Usher may have began the halftime show with the enthusiasm of a young boy who just got his chance to perform a solo in the church choir, by its end he was fully inhabiting his chart-topping sex icon persona.Will.i.am’s voice rippled through the stadium as Usher, donning a blue and black Off-White outfit reminiscent of football shoulder pads, glided onto the stage with an aura that is equal parts charismatic and sinful sweet.\n\nSkating, a main tenant of Atlanta’s culture, is embedded in Usher’s ethos and a part of his larger business. The singer loves skating and owns several skating rinks.\n\nUsher finished the extravagant performance with \"Yeah!\" — a song beloved in Atlanta and far, far beyond. That the song is turning 20 this year and still resonates with a global audience (not to mention a football-loving one) is further evidence that Usher truly is the \"King of R&B.\"\n\n\"Your moment is your moment. And this is a moment I’ve prepared for during the last 30 years,\" Usher told Billboard ahead of the Super Bowl.\n\nHe certainly owned his moment. Usher's Super Bowl halftime show was no singular performance or an audition, but a coronation. He was receiving the torch carried by all the Black entertainers who preceded him, and reminding the world that the South still has something to say.\n\nSurrounded by Ludacris and Lil Jon, strippers, and his own marching band, Usher closed the night out with the A-Town Stomp and one important phase: \"I took the world to the A!\"\n\nUsher's Biggest Hits, From Baby-Making Slow Jams To Dance Floor Classics"
