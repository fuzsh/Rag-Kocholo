Usher was born in Dallas, Texas and spent much of his childhood in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He began singing at a young age in his local church choir. His family later moved to Atlanta to provide more opportunities for his musical talent. At age 11, Usher joined a local R&B quintet and recorded his first album, which was only available regionally. After high school, Usher further developed his performing skills and worked on his second album while also appearing on other artists' songs and albums. He befriended producer Jermaine Dupri, who helped produce Usher's breakthrough second album My Way in 1997.",
