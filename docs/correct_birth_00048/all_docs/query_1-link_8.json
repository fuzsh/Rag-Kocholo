        "text": "Music has evolved a great deal within the last 30 years. There are lots of names to thank for that, and near the top of that list is Usher Terry Raymond IV. Over the last three decades, the American singer has recorded eight solo studio albums, had nine of his songs reach #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, and has scored eight Grammy Awards out of 23 nominations. Not to mention, his iconic music videos have garnered millions of views on YouTube!\n\nThe latest of his accolades: Usher aka the King of R&B made major headlines recently when it was announced he would be the halftime show performer at Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nIf your reaction to this news was at all similar to ours, you probably started humming to the tune of one of his many hits. We mean it when we say many, because you could have belted out the lyrics to \"My Boo,\" \"U Got It Bad,\" or even \"Yeah!\" After realizing how many songs of his you know, it becomes clear that he has been around for quite some time. This may have some of you wondering about the age of the music idol. Usher is 45 years old, born on October 14, 1978, in Dallas, Texas.\n\nTechnically speaking, this isn't the first time Usher has performed at the Super Bowl. (He made a guest appearance when the Black Eyed Peas headlined in 2011.) This will, however, be the first time Usher headlines his own halftime show! We can even expect a surprise or two. \"It will definitely be an event,\" Usher said in an interview with Billboard. \"There are special guests.\"\n\nThe good news doesn't stop there for fans. In fact, the superstar is helping redefine what it means to be a mainstream musician in their forties. For the first time since 2016, Usher is releasing an original solo album: Coming Home, which will be released on February 9, 2024.\n\nSpeaking about the new project, Usher claimed that he is now \"100%\" in his own skin. He also went on to say that \"after 30 years, it shouldn't even be a question about whether this is going to be greater than something in my past. [...] I just want to love what I do, make what I love, allow people to come to my space and see what I have to offer.\"\n\nHey, we're here for it. Here's to a new era of Usher's music, and an inspiring legacy in the making!"
