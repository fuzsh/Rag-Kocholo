        "text": "Canadian musician (born 1966)\n\nMusical artist\n\nDavid Usher (born April 24, 1966) is a British-born Canadian musician, best-selling author, keynote speaker, and activist best known as the front man for the band Moist. He has also released a number of solo albums.[1] He is the founder of Reimagine AI, an artificial intelligence creative studio.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nDavid Usher was born in Oxford, England to Thai Buddhist artist Samphan Usher and Queen's University economics professor Dan Usher.[2] He has lived in various places such as Malaysia, New York City, California and Thailand since early childhood, before his family settled in Kingston, Ontario. He attended high school at Kingston Collegiate and Vocational Institute at the same time that Gord Downie of The Tragically Hip and Hugh Dillon of the Headstones attended the school.[citation needed] Usher attended Queen's University for one semester before transferring to Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia, majoring in political science.[3]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile studying in Vancouver, Usher helped form the band Moist, composed of Usher on vocals, Mark Makoway on guitars, Jeff Pearce on bass, Kevin Young, who, like Usher, had moved to Vancouver from Kingston, on keyboards, and Paul Wilcox on drums. Usher became the principal songwriter for the band.\n\nMoist's debut album Silver was released in 1994 and went on to achieve quadruple-platinum status, selling 400,000 copies in Canada. Their sophomore album, titled Creature, was released in 1996 and reached triple-platinum status, selling over 300,000 copies.\n\nIn 1998, Usher took a year to work on his own recordings.[4][5] He released his first solo album, Little Songs. Most of the album was recorded in the kitchen of David's apartment. The album contains a track titled \"Baby Skin Tattoo\", which bears no relation to the song of the same name on the Moist album Creature.\n\nIn 1999, Moist released their third album, titled Mercedes 5 and Dime, once again achieving multi-platinum status. They followed this with a compilation album and DVD in 2001, titled Machine Punch Through: The Singles Collection, and thereafter entered a hiatus period that would last twelve years.\n\nUsher continued with his solo career, releasing his second solo album, Morning Orbit, which sold 90,000 copies. The song \"Alone in the Universe\" was released as the first single, and the album featured collaborations with some members of Moist and with several figures of the Canadian music scene including Jagori Tanna and Bruce Gordon of I Mother Earth, Gord Sinclair of The Tragically Hip, and the rapper Snow. The album also included a cover of the Tracy Chapman song \"Fast Car\". A Thai version of the record was released, and included Usher singing in Thai on two of the tracks.\n\nUsher's third solo album, Hallucinations, came out in 2003, and includes a cover of the Manic Street Preachers song \"If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next\".\n\nHallucinations was followed by If God Had Curves, which includes collaborations with Tegan Quin of Tegan and Sara, and Bruce Cockburn.\n\nUsher continued to release solo albums throughout the first decade of the 2000s, with Strange Birds (2007) and Wake Up and Say Goodbye (2008). Strange Birds contains themes inspired by New York City, where Usher had moved with his family. It also includes extensive collaborations with other members of Moist. Wake Up and Say Goodbye includes a bonus track featuring Quebec-based singer Marie-Mai, and the album was nominated for a Juno Award.\n\nIn the early 2010s, David Usher released two more solo albums before reforming the band Moist. The Mile End Sessions came out in 2010, and Songs from the Last Day on Earth in 2012. The Mile End Sessions is composed mostly of previously released songs re-recorded in acoustic arrangements, is produced by Moist member Jonathan Gallivan, contains Usher's first French-language recording, and features contributions from Marie-Mai and Cœur de pirate. Songs from the Last Day on Earth is also produced by Jonathan Gallivan.\n\nIn 2013, Moist returned from a twelve-year hiatus and recorded their fourth studio album, Glory Under Dangerous Skies, the following year.\n\nIn 2016, Usher released his ninth solo studio album, titled Let It Play. The album features English translations of French-Canadian songs,[6][7] re-recorded originals from Usher's repertoire, as well as high-profile collaborations with artists such as Marie-Mai, Alex Nevsky, Monogrenade, Karim Ouellet, Dumas, Ingrid St-Pierre, Caracol, Daniel Lavoie, Dominique A, and Baden Baden.\n\nThroughout his musical career, Usher has sold more than 1.4 million albums, won four Juno Awards and had several #1 singles singing in English, French, and Thai.\n\nUsher is also the founder of Reimagine AI, an artificial intelligence creative studio based out of Montreal. Reimagine AI integrates interactive and AI technology to build virtual beings.\n\nUsher is the co-creator (with Damon Matthews) of the Climate Clock. Climateclock.net [8]\n\nIn 2012 Usher made a presentation about the creative process at the Mesh Marketing conference in Toronto.[9] In 2015 he published a book on creativity and the creative process, titled Let the Elephants Run • Unlock Your Creativity and Change Everything.[10]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nHe is featured in the 2001 MuchMusic special Musicians in the WarZone, a humanitarian documentary directed by filmmaker Liz Marshall, in which he journeys to the northern border of Thailand to visit a large Burmese refugee community.\n\nAs of 2018, he lives in Montreal, Quebec, with his family.\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Details Peak chart\n\npositions CAN Little Songs\n\nRelease date: March 17, 1998\n\nLabel: EMI\n\n19 Morning Orbit\n\nRelease date: July 31, 2001\n\nLabel: EMI\n\n9 Hallucinations\n\nRelease date: September 9, 2003\n\nLabel: EMI\n\n6 If God Had Curves\n\nRelease date: April 26, 2005\n\nLabel: EMI\n\n12 Strange Birds\n\nRelease date: March 20, 2007\n\nLabel: Maple Music\n\n10 Wake Up and Say Goodbye\n\nRelease date: September 23, 2008\n\nLabel: Maple Music\n\n12 The Mile End Sessions\n\nRelease date: September 14, 2010\n\nLabel: Maple Music\n\n18 Songs from the Last Day on Earth\n\nRelease date: October 2, 2012\n\nLabel: Maple Music\n\nLet It Play\n\nRelease date: November 4, 2016\n\nLabel: Evil Empire Inc.\n\n\"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n\nEPs\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Details iTunes Live from Montreal\n\nRelease date: January 13, 2009\n\nLabel: Evil Empire Inc.\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Peak Chart Position Album CAN\n\n[11] GER\n\n[12] NED\n\n[13] SWI\n\n[14] 1998 \"Forestfire\" 27 — — — Little Songs \"Jesus Was My Girl\" — — — — \"St. Lawrence River\" — — — — 2001 \"Alone in the Universe\" — — — — Morning Orbit \"Black Black Heart\" — 82 87 45 \"A Day in the Life\" — — — — 2002 \"My Way Out\" — — — — 2003 \"Time of Our Lives\" 16 — — — Hallucinations \"Surfacing\" — — — — 2004 \"Galaxy\" — — — — Single only 2005 \"Love Will Save the Day\" — — — — If God Had Curves 2007 \"The Music\" 17 — — — Strange Birds \"Ugly is Beautiful\" — — — — 2008 \"Kill the Lights\" (featuring Marie-Mai) — — — — Wake Up and Say Goodbye 2010 \"Je repars\" (featuring Marie-Mai) — — — — The Mile End Sessions \"I'm Coming Down\" (Acoustic) — — — —\n\nwith Moist\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Moist discography\n\nTitle Year Silver\n\n1994\n\nCreature\n\n1996\n\nMercedes 5 and Dime\n\n1999\n\nMachine Punch Through: The Singles Collection\n\n2001\n\nGlory Under Dangerous Skies\n\n2014\n\nEnd of the Ocean\n\n2022\n\nOther appearances\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Watching the Wheels\" (John Lennon cover) (Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur, 2007)\n\nDVDs\n\n[edit]\n\nwalk.don't.run (2005)\n\nVideography\n\n[edit]\n\nAppears in Building a Mystery from Sarah McLachlan's Surfacing (1997)\n\nForestfire from Little Songs (1998)\n\nJesus Was My Girl from Little Songs (1998)\n\nSt. Lawrence River from Little Songs (1998)\n\nAlone in the Universe from Morning Orbit (2001)\n\nBlack Black Heart V 1.0-2.0 from Morning Orbit (2001)\n\nA Day in the Life from Morning Orbit (2002)\n\nMy Way Out from Morning Orbit (2002)\n\nTime of Our Lives from Hallucinations (2003)\n\nSurfacing from Hallucinations (2003)\n\nLove Will Save The Day from If God Had Curves (May 2005)\n\nThe Music from Strange Birds (2007)\n\nUgly is Beautiful from Strange Birds (July 2007)\n\nKill the Lights from Wake Up and Say Goodbye (November 2008)\n\nJe repars from \"The Mile End Sessions\" (August 2010)\n\nRice Paper from \"Songs from the Last Day on Earth\" (October 2012)\n\nPartir ailleurs from \"Songs from the Last Day on Earth\" (October 2012)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
