        "text": "Usher Raymond IV, better known as Usher, is an acclaimed American singer, songwriter, and dancer. With a career spanning over three decades, his contributions to the music industry are considerable. Usher made his debut in 1994 with a self-titled album at the age of 16. His second album, \"My Way,\" brought him to prominence in the late 1990s. His third album, \"8701,\" won him two Grammy Awards and sold eight million copies worldwide. However, it was his 2000s album \"Confessions\" that established him as one of the best-selling artists of the decade, boasting four consecutive Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles. To date, Usher has sold 33 million albums and 87.5 million digital songs in the United States alone and 150 million records worldwide, earning him a place among the best-selling music artists of all time.\n\nIn addition to his music career, Usher has made notable guest appearances on TV shows such as The Twilight Zone, 7th Heaven, and American Dreams. He has also acted in films, including playing a disc jockey named Darrell in \"In the Mix\" in 2005 and taking over the role of Billy Flynn in the Broadway revival of the musical \"Chicago\" in 2006. His performance at the We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial in 2009, his 12-show residency at the Colosseum at Caesars' Palace in Las Vegas in 2021, and his upcoming headline at the Super Bowl LVIII Halftime Show further exhibit his extensive experience performing on both small and large stages.\n\nUsher has also made significant contributions to humanitarian causes through his non-profit organization, Usher's New Look. He launched the initiative called Our Block, aimed at rebuilding and revitalizing city blocks in New Orleans, and Project Restart, which provided housing and utilities assistance to over 700 families affected by Hurricane Katrina. Usher's philanthropic endeavors have earned him recognition, including the Freedom Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the prestigious Candle Award from Morehouse College. These endeavors, combined with his prolific music career and involvement in other ventures such as health-science and nutrition wellness company Liquid I.V., display Usher's diverse range of interests and his capacity to speak passionately and knowledgeably on a variety of topics."
