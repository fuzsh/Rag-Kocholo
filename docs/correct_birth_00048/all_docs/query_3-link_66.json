At this point, everyone knows that Usher's got the voice that makes the booty go clap. Since 1994, the R&B singer has established himself as one of the most successful musicians and dancers of all time. He's topped Billboard charts on several occasions and has won several awards for his achievements in music, including over eight Grammy awards. With ongoing success like that, it's only natural that other artists would want to collaborate with him on songs.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nTo that end, Usher has been collaborating with other rappers and singers since 2004. Surprising no one, many of his collabs have also topped charts during their initial releases. He would go on to work with several established musicians in some of the most popular and recognizable songs that one can name. To this day, he continues to work with other artists and fans are hungry to see who he'll be performing with next.\n\nHere's a quick list of Usher's collaborations and what the future may have in store.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nUsher has made several collab tracks in the past.\n\nUsher's very first collab came in 2004 with the song \"Yeah!\" He worked with rappers Lil Jon and Ludacris on the track and the lyrics were written by Sean Garrett, Patrick \"J. Que\" Smith, Robert McDowell, and LRoc. The song would go on to top the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for 12 weeks in a row. It later won at the 47th Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.\n\nThat would mark the start of what would become a series of successful and popular collaborations involving Usher.\n\nHere is, in no particular order, a list of artists who Usher has collabed with:\n\nLil Jon\n\nLudacris\n\nDiddy\n\nYoung Thug\n\nFuture\n\nA$AP Rocky\n\nPitbull\n\nJay-Z\n\nJustin Bieber\n\nwill.i.am\n\nT.I.\n\nJeezy\n\nBeyoncé\n\nLil Wayne\n\nJadakiss\n\nMonica\n\nJuicy J\n\nNicki Minaj\n\nRico Love\n\nWiz Khalifa\n\nLuke Steele\n\nAfrojack\n\nJermaine Dupri\n\nDa Brat\n\nBun B\n\nLoon\n\nT-Pain\n\nThe East Side Boyz\n\nMariah Carey\n\nNas\n\nBibi Bourelli\n\nLil' Kim\n\nShyne\n\nTwista\n\nGucci Mane\n\nDirty Money\n\nAlicia Keys\n\nPharrell\n\nRomeo Santos\n\nDJ Khaled\n\nDavid Guetta\n\n21 Savage\n\nPitbull\n\nbenny blanco\n\nSummer Walker\n\nDrake\n\nRick Ross\n\nChris Brown\n\nR. Kelly\n\nKanye West\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nOn Feb. 9, 2024, Usher released a new album entitled \"Coming Home.\" The album features many new singles as well as a couple of new collabs.\n\nThey include songs performed with:\n\nLatto\n\nThe-Dream\n\nH.E.R.\n\nPheelz\n\nJungkook\n\nUsher's collabs definitely aren't slowing down any time soon. In fact, his reputation as a collab artist has led some folks to believe that his 2024 Super Bowl performance could feature some surprise guests.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nUsher's Super Bowl 2024 show has sparked speculation about secret guests.\n\nWith Usher headlining the halftime show for Super Bowl LVIII between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers, folks are curious as to whether or not he'll have anyone else join the stage with him. After all, the Super Bowl tends to be home to all sorts of surprises and collabs, including Beyoncé and Bruno Mars stealing the show from Coldplay at Super Bowl 50 in 2016 and Beyoncé's previous blackout-inducing reunion with Destiny's Child.\n\nAs for Usher at Super Bowl LVIII, rumors are circulating as to who could appear. CBS Sports suggests that Lil Jon and Ludacris could appear for a performance of \"Yeah!\" They also theorized that artists like Pitbull and Jungkook could make some appearances.\n\nHowever, he previously told Good Morning America that he wants his Super Bowl performance to honor Black artists. If he does have anyone join him on stage, it will likely boil down to his fellow Black performers.\n\nSuper Bowl LVIII airs at 6:30 p.m. EST on CBS."
