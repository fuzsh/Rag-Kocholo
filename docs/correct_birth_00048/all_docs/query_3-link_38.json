        "text": "Usher Raymond IV (born October 14, 1978), known professionally as Usher, is an American singer, songwriter, actor, businessman and dancer. He was born in Dallas, Texas, but raised in Chattanooga, Tennessee, until moving to Atlanta, Georgia. At the age of 12, his mother put him in local singing competitions before catching the attention of a music A&R from LaFace Records. He released his self-titled debut album Usher (1994), and rose to fame in the late 1990s with the release of his second album My Way (1997). It spawned his first U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, \"Nice & Slow\", and the top-two singles \"You Make Me Wanna...\" and \"My Way\". His third album, 8701 (2001), produced the number-one singles \"U Remind Me\" and \"U Got It Bad\", as well as the top-three single \"U Don't Have to Call\". It sold eight million copies worldwide and won his first two Grammy Awards as Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 2002 and 2003.\n\nWhy There's No Limit to How Much He and His Songs Rock\n\nHis beats are great.\n\nHe has a nice singing voice.\n\nHe has collaborated with great artists like Ludacris, Lil Wayne, Future and Beyonc√©.\n\nHe has great songs like \"DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love\", \"Yeah!\", 'Rivals\", \"My Boo\" with Alicia Keys, \"Love in This Club\", \"U Remind Me\", and \"No Limit\".\n\nAlong with David Guetta, he launched Project Restart, which would go on to help more than 700 families with housing and keeping their lights on, helped former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick complete his pledge to donate $1 million to oppressed communities.\n\nHe, Universal Music Group, Steve Stoute, Evolution Media, Jon Jashni, Charles King, and others invested $6 Million in Mass Appeal Magazine.\n\nOn April 2, 2019, Usher, with JAY-Z, Walter Robb, Seth Goldman, Ndamukong Suh, and others invested $8 Million in a catering startup called Hungry.[1] Hungry is a service that connects local chefs with companies looking for business and event catering.\n\nAlso on July 23, 2019, it was announced Usher, Kevin Hart, Justin Bieber, Demi Lovato, DJ Khaled, Scooter Braun, and Kendall Jenner among others collectively invested $5 million in Liquid I.V., a health-science and nutrition wellness company based out of El Segundo, California.\n\nUsher founded New Look, a non-profit charity organization which aims to \"provide young people with a new look on life through education and real-world experience\".\n\nIn 1999, Usher participated in \"Challenge for the Children\", a benefit basketball game hosted by American boy band NSYNC. The event, which was held on the campus of Georgia State University, had raised an estimated $50,000 for several local charities.\n\nIn 2005, Usher is one among the artists who signed on for a Hurricane Katrina relief concert.\n\nHe has also performed a public service announcement to promote Do Something's campaign for civic engagement.\n\nIn 2011, Usher was honored with the Freedom Award by the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis.\n\nIn 2016, he, alongside Tyrese, Future, Ludacris, and Jeezy donated $25,000 each to the UNCF during the 33rd annual Atlanta's Mayors Ball.[2]\n\nBad Qualities\n\nHe has some bad songs like \"OMG!\".\n\nHe said T-Pain ruined music with AutoTune on a plane with him, which drove T-Pain to a 4-year depression.[3] To make this worse, T-Pain considered him to be a close friend. This also makes Usher hypocritical because he said that in 2010, the year his song \"OMG\" (in which he and will.i.am both used autotune) was released. He also collaborated with Future in 2016 on their song \"Rivals\" in which Future is another artist to utilize the auto-tune effect.\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nUsher (1994)\n\nMy Way (1997)\n\n8701 (2001)\n\nConfessions (2004)\n\nHere I Stand (2008)\n\nRaymond v.
