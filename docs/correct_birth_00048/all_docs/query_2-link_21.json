        "text": "Ready for the Super Bowl halftime show? \"Yeah!\"? Well, so is Usher.\n\nA few months removed from finishing up his Las Vegas residency, the R&B singer/songwriter will take the stage again in the Sin City, this time headlining the 2024 Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nUsher is the latest performer selected by the NFL and Roc Nation, who have partnered for a multi-year collaboration to help put together the biggest halftime show in American football. Jennifer Lopez and Shakira were the first halftime show performers in Miami in 2020, followed by The Weeknd in 2021 and a massive collaboration among Dr. Dre, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar in 2022. Rihanna was the most recent performer, in 2023.\n\nREQUIRED READING: The Essentials: As Usher prepares for Super Bowl halftime show, here are his must-haves\n\nIt remains to be seen what songs Usher will include in his Super Bowl halftime setlist, but he doubtless will put on a performance that has NFL and music fans alike talking.\n\nHere's everything you need to know on King of R&B and the Super Bowl halftime show:\n\nWho is performing the Super Bowl halftime show?\n\nEight-time Grammy award-winning and R&B pop artist Usher will take the stage and perform during the Super Bowl halftime show.\n\n\"It's an honor of a lifetime to finally check a Super Bowl performance off my bucket list. I can't wait to bring the world a show unlike anything else they've seen from me before,\" Usher said in late September when it was announced he would play the Super Bowl.\n\nThis will mark Usher's second Super Bowl appearance, as he performed alongside the Black Eye Peas at Super Bowl 45 in 2011.\n\nWhat time is the Super Bowl halftime show?\n\nDate: Sunday, Feb. 11\n\nTime: 7-7:15 p.m. CT (approximately)\n\nIt's uncertain when exactly the Super Bowl halftime show will take place. But, considering the game is scheduled for a 5:30 p.m. CT kickoff, Usher should likely take centerstage at Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium between 7 p.m. and 7:15 p.m. CT.\n\nWho old is Usher?\n\nUsher, whose full name is Usher Raymond, is 45 years old.\n\nWho is Usher?\n\nBorn in Dallas but raised in Atlanta, Usher broke out onto the music stage in 1994 with the release of his debut album, eponymously named, \"Usher.\"\n\nHis second album, \"My Way,\" kickstarted his fame and gave him his first Billboard Hot 100 in the United States with \"Nice & Slow.\" Usher's third album, \"Confessions,\" came out in 2004: It went diamond and is considered one of his top albums still today. He has had nine No. 1 hits and 18 top-10 hits on the Billboard Top 100.\n\nHe also spent two seasons as a coach on NBC's \"The Voice,\" which he won on Season 6 with Josh Kaufman. He has won eight Grammy's and sold more than 75 million records throughout his career.\n\nWhat hits does Usher have?\n\nRanging from \"Yeah!\" to \"My Way\" to \"Confessions Part II\" to \"DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love ft. Pitbull\" to \"Love in This Club,\" Usher has put together some of the top hits in R&B and Pop across the last few three decades.\n\nWho has performed the Super Bowl halftime show?\n\nHere is the list of names that Usher will soon join in headlining the Super Bowl halftime show:"
