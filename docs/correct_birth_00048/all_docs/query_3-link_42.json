        "text": "Usher, one of the most famous R&B artists, has made a lasting impact on the music industry. He’s super talented and known for his catchy songs and great stage presence. Back in the early ’90s, he tried to make a name for himself on a TV show called “Star Search,” just like Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake did. His performance there got him a record deal, and from there, his career took off.\n\nUsher, whose real name is Usher Raymond IV, released three albums in the ’90s and early 2000s that people really liked. But it was his album “Confessions” in 2004 that made him super famous with his first No. 1 album. He’s had a fantastic career with nine No. 1 hits and 18 top-10 hits, and he even won a Billboard award for Artist of the Year. He finished 2023 with a successful show in Las Vegas and is getting ready to headline the 2024 Super Bowl — and he’s not slowing down anytime soon.\n\nHis songs are not just about fun stuff; they also talk about the tough things he’s been through in his own life. Usher once said, “In life, you have to go through something to get to something.” That’s where he gets the inspiration for his music. His album “Confessions” is all about admitting the mistakes and challenges he faced on his way to becoming a mega-success.\n\nTake a look at some of the tough details that make up Usher’s story.\n\nUsher Was Heartbroken When His Grandma Died\n\nUsher, the guy who brought us “Love In This Club,” is no stranger to heartbreak. In 2022, he took to Instagram to pour out his feelings about losing his beloved grandmother, Tina. It wasn’t easy for him, and he admitted feeling “a bit lost right now” as he grappled with the pain of her passing.\n\nIn his heartfelt post, Usher shared that it took him a few days to come to terms with the fact that his Grandma Tina was no longer with him. He asked for prayers for clarity and strength for everyone who relied on her. Usher didn’t shy away from expressing his admiration for his grandmother, calling her a “prayer warrior” who dedicated herself to helping others. Even though part of him tried to be strong for others, he confessed, “The other half of me continues to break silently.” Just days before, they were laughing together, and he never expected that their time would be cut short.\n\nTina, according to Usher, believed that her grandson was meant to be a pastor. He shared a piece of advice she had given him: “There’s a time for everything, son … there’s a time to laugh, a time to cry … there’s a time to live and a time to die.” Usher honored Tina with a touching Instagram post from her funeral, expressing, “We love you more, Grandma Tina. Rest in Paradise.”\n\nUsher’s Custody Battle\n\nUsher’s love story with Tameka Foster took a rowdy turn, leading to a bitter custody battle that reached its climax in 2013. The R&B artist and Foster began their relationship in 2005, walking down the aisle two years later. The couple welcomed two children together, and Usher took on the role of stepdad to Foster’s three other kids. However, their union came to an end in 2009 when they filed for divorce, marking the beginning of a challenging three-year custody dispute over their children.\n\nAmidst the legal struggle, Foster accused her ex-husband of infidelity and being an absent parent. Usher, in response, refuted these claims, stating, “Absentee from the aspect of having to go and work, that probably would be her version or idea of what absentee would be. But no, I’m not an absentee father at all.”\n\nThe custody case concluded in 2012, with Billboard reporting that Usher was granted primary custody while the parents shared legal custody of their two sons. Foster received visitation rights, although the details were not disclosed. The emotional courtroom showdown saw Usher embracing his ex-wife after the verdict, whispering “I’m sorry” to her multiple times, as recounted by People.\n\nThe toll of the custody battle weighed heavily on Usher, and he opened up to Oprah about the strained relationship shortly after the legal dust settled. “I really felt like we were friends. She made us enemies in a way that I could never understand,” Usher revealed in a candid conversation with Oprah via ABC News. The custody battle not only shaped Usher’s personal life but also left enduring emotional imprints on his journey.\n\nUsher’s Co-Parenting Journey\n\nDespite some past drama with his ex, Tameka Foster, these two are putting on a united front as parents. But here’s the kicker – their son, Usher Raymond V, is dealing with Type 1 diabetes, adding a whole new layer to the parenting adventure.\n\nUsher spilled the beans in an interview with People. Dealing with the news of his son’s diabetes was like hitting the reset button on life. “From the moment that Type 1 diabetes was a conversation, it was a re-acclimation to life. The life that we knew changed,” he shared. Wrangling this health challenge means a serious commitment to making sure their kiddo makes the right moves for a happy, healthy life.\n\n“It’s been a task,” Usher admitted, acknowledging the whole parent team needs to be on the same page, especially because kids have this magical ability to play parents against each other.\n\nBut Usher isn’t just talking the talk; he’s walking the walk. The “Yeah!” singer teamed up with Sanofi’s The 1 Pledge Movement, a crew spreading the word about screening for Type 1 diabetes. His mission? To share the knowledge he wished he had when his son got the diagnosis bomb dropped. “If I had honestly prepared myself better, I would’ve appreciated it,” he said, emphasizing the importance of being in the know when you’re navigating the twists and turns of parenting.\n\nUsher Suffered Tragic Loss in 2012\n\nIn 2012, Usher faced an unimaginable tragedy when his stepson, Kile Glover, lost his life in a boating accident. Kile, the son of Usher’s ex-wife Tameka Foster and Atlanta TV Executive Ryan Glover, was struck by a jet ski at Lake Lanier during a day of recreation.\n\nFollowing the accident, Kile was pronounced brain-dead despite his mother’s hopeful wishes for a full recovery. The young boy, alongside a 15-year-old girl, was flown to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston. Unfortunately, Kile succumbed to his injuries two weeks later, passing away from heart failure.\n\nThe driver of the jet ski, Jeffrey Hubbard, was later found g"
