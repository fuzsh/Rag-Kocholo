        "text": "Usher children-American R&B singer, Usher Raymond IV was born in October 14, 1978 in Dallas, Texas in the United States of America.\n\nUsher was born to Jonetta Patton OâNeal and Usher Raymond III. He shares the same mother with his stepbrother, Jack Lackey.\n\nUsher joined the neighborhood church youth chorus in Chattanooga at age nine under his motherâs guidance.\n\nThere, his grandmother first heard him sing, though she didnât think he was good enough to perform professionally until Usher joined a group.\n\nUsherâs family relocated to Atlanta, Georgia, thinking that a larger city would offer more opportunities for exposing his ability. There, the climate was more hospitable for aspiring vocalists. He went to North Springs High School in Atlanta.\n\nUsher career\n\nUsherâs mother entered him in local singing contests when he was 12 years old, and this is how a music A&R from LaFace Records came to notice him.\n\nUsher, his self-titled debut album, was published in 1994. With the release of My Way, his second album, in the late 1990s, he gained popularity.\n\nIt gave birth to his first number-one single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, âNice & Slow,â as well as the top two singles, âYou Make Me Wannaâ¦,â and âMy Way.â\n\nThe number-one singles âU Remind Meâ and âU Got It Badâ as well as the top-three single âU Donât Have to Callâ were off of his third album, 8701 (2001). Eight million copies were sold globally, and in 2002 and 2003, it was recognized with its first two Grammy Awards for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance.\n\nHis 2004 album Confessions, which featured the number-one singles âYeah!â (with Lil Jon and Ludacris), âBurn,â âConfessions Part II,â and âMy Booâ (featuring Alicia Keys), as well as the top-ten âCaught Up,â made him one of the best-selling musicians of the 2000s decade.\n\nThe RIAA awarded it a Diamond certification for its global sales of more than 20 million copies. He released the albums Here I Stand (2008) and Raymond v. Raymond (2010) after divorcing his manager and mother in 2007.\n\nBoth of these albums debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 chart and, in turn, gave rise to the number-one singles âLove in This Clubâ (featuring Young Jeezy) and âOMGâ (featuring will.i.am).\n\nBefore the top-fifteen song âMoreâ was released, the EP Versus produced the top-five single âDJ Got Us Fallinâ in Loveâ (with Pitbull).\n\nThe top-ten single âScreamâ from Looking 4 Myself (2012) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 list as well. Grammy Awards were given to the R&B ballads âThere Goes My Babyâ and âClimaxâ in 2011 and 2013, respectively.\n\nJuicy Jâs âI Donât Mindâ (2014) also made it to the top fifteen, while Hard II Love (2016) peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 chart. He collaborated on the album A with the music producer Zaytoven, and it was published in 2018.\n\nUsher has reportedly sold 23.8 million albums and 38.2 million digital songs in the US, earning the moniker âKing of R&Bâ from a number of media sources.\n\nHe is one of the best-selling musicians of all time, with 80 million recordings sold internationally.\n\nAt the close of 2009, Billboard placed him as the second-most lucrative artist of the decade, the decadeâs top Hot 100 artist, and the decadeâs best solo album with Confessions.\n\nThe same publication ranked him sixth among the âTop 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Yearsâ and fourteenth among the âGreatest of All Time Hot 100 Artistsâ on their respective lists.\n\nNine of Usherâs singles reached number one. He has received inductions into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Black Music and Entertainment Walk of Fame, and the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. He is regarded as a cultural icon and sex symbol.\n\nEight Grammy distinctions, 34 ASCAP Awards, nine Soul Train Music Awards, and eight American Music Awards are just a few of the numerous honors and distinctions that Usher has received.\n\nUsher is the fifth-most honored performer at the Billboard Music trophies with 18 trophies. He is the owner of the record company Raymond-Braun Media Group (RBMG), a partnership with talent scout Scooter Braun that features Justin Bieber from Canada.\n\nUsher is known for his humanitarian work in addition to his great music career. He founded the Usherâs New Look Foundation.\n\nDoes Usher have any children?\n\nUsher has four children from his relationships and his current relationship. The names of his children are; Usher Raymond V, Naviyd Ely Raymond, Sovereign Bo Raymond and Sire Castrello Raymond.\n\nSource: www.Ghgossip.com\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jq6qoZ2iYrCptcudqZ6mXw%3D%3D"
