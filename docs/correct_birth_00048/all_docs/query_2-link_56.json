By the time he turned 30, the New Zealand-born, Australia-raised artist already had a string of critically acclaimed albums to his name; everyone from GRAMMY winners and chart-toppers to Mercury Prize nominees was clamouring to work with him.\n\nThe musicians that made his childhood – namely, Stevie Wonder, Bill Withers and Curtis Mayfield – are the major source of influence for his fifth studio album, The Loop. Capturing the evolution of his signature blend of electronic elements with his soulful voice, The Loop embraces orchestral arrangements, haunting choirs and hypnotic beats.\n\nAn innate curiosity for exploring new sounds threads through Rakei’s discography. Don’t miss the opportunity to hear The Loop performed live in Rakei’s International Festival debut."
