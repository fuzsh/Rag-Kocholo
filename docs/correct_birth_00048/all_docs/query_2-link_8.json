        "text": "Today (April 10), the city of Chattanooga, TN announced a \"community celebration\" in honor of Usher, who was born and raised there before relocating to Atlanta, GA to pursue his music career. During the free event, the veteran singer will receive a key to the city and proclamations from the state and local governments.\n\n“The city of Chattanooga provided a spark that ignited the fire in me to pursue my dreams as a singer, and I’m thankful for the support I received from so many great family members, friends, and mentors so early in my journey,\" Usher stated in a press release. \"Thank you for the honor. I look forward to celebrating with you all.\"\n\nMayor Tim Kelly added, \"The pride in Chattanooga during Usher's iconic Super Bowl halftime show was palpable. We know as a smaller city, we punch way above our weight when it comes to the talent our city produces, and Usher is one of the finest examples of that talent. He’s going to feel the love when he comes home to McKenzie Arena on April 20. I look forward to seeing y’all there.\""
