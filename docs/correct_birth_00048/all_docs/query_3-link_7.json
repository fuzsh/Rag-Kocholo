        "text": "Usher has had a career filled with many sparkling moments, and yet this one feels like it outsizes them all. After dazzling Las Vegas with his ‚ÄúMy Way‚Äù residency for 100 shows, the singer didn‚Äôt stop to catch his breath‚Äîin fact, he braced for maximum impact, announcing the release of his ninth album ‚ÄúComing Home‚Äù (his first in eight years), an upcoming North American tour and a coveted booking as the performer during the Super Bowl Halftime show, taking place on Feb. 11.\n\nIt makes sense, then, that Usher would play the biggest stage in the world at this point in his career‚Äîhe‚Äôs done the work. Ever since debuting with his eponymous 1994 album at just 15 years old, he has repeatedly proven to be a chameleonic tour de force, whether it be traipsing genres across albums and stacking nine number-one Billboard Hot 100 hits to gracing the silver screen and building his portfolio as an entrepreneur.\n\nWith a discography that stretches across decades and timeless hits to his name, the 45-year-old has consistently proven that a legacy is only as strong as the talent and hard work behind it. And Usher has the track record to show for it. Before he takes the biggest stage in the world, Variety takes a look back at his best singles, spanning the ballads to the bops."
