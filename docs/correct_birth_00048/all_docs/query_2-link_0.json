        "text": "American R&B singer (born 1978)\n\nUsher Raymond IV (born October 14, 1978) is an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. He is recognized as an influential figure in contemporary R&B and pop music. Usher first released his self-titled debut album (1994) at the age of 15, and rose to fame in the late 1990s following the release of his second album, My Way (1997). It spawned his first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single \"Nice & Slow\", and the top-two singles \"You Make Me Wanna...\" and the title track. His third album, 8701 (2001) saw continued success and contained two number-one singles, \"U Remind Me\" and \"U Got It Bad\", as well as the top-three single \"U Don't Have to Call\". It sold eight million copies worldwide and won his first two Grammy Awards for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance consecutively in 2002 and 2003.\n\nConfessions (2004) established Usher as one of the best-selling musical artists of the 2000s decade, supported by four consecutive Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles—\"Yeah!\" (featuring Lil Jon and Ludacris), \"Burn\", \"Confessions Part II\", and \"My Boo\" (with Alicia Keys)—and the top-ten \"Caught Up\". The album sold over 20 million copies worldwide and received diamond certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). After splitting from his manager and mother in 2007, he released the albums Here I Stand (2008) and Raymond v. Raymond (2010), both of which debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart and spawned the respective number-one singles \"Love in This Club\" (featuring Young Jeezy) and \"OMG\" (featuring will.i.am). The latter also spawned the single \"There Goes My Baby\", which won his third Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance.\n\nHis debut extended play, Versus (2010) produced the top-five single \"DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love\" (featuring Pitbull). His seventh album, Looking 4 Myself (2012) likewise debuted atop the chart and saw further electronic production; it spawned the top-ten single \"Scream\" and top 20 single \"Climax\"—which received a Grammy Award. His 2014 standalone single, \"I Don't Mind\" (featuring Juicy J) reached the top-15 of the Billboard Hot 100, and his eighth album, Hard II Love (2016) peaked at number five on the Billboard 200. His ninth album, Coming Home (2024) was released as a first independent project, preceded by the single \"Good Good\" (with 21 Savage and Summer Walker).\n\nReferred to by some critics as the King of R&B, Usher has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[7][8] At the end of 2009, Billboard named him the second most successful artist of the decade, the number-one Hot 100 artist of the decade, and ranked Confessions as the top solo album of the decade. The same magazine placed him at number 6 on their list of \"Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years\". In 2023, Rolling Stone magazine named him the 97th greatest singer of all time. Usher has earned 9 number-one singles. He has been inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame, the Black Music and Entertainment Walk of Fame, SoundExchange Hall of Fame, and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Usher has won numerous awards and accolades including 8 Grammy Awards, 12 Soul Train Music Awards, 8 American Music Awards and 3 Guinness World Records. With 18 awards, Usher is the fifth-most awarded artist at the Billboard Music Awards. Usher co-founded the record label Raymond-Braun Media Group (RBMG) in a joint venture with talent manager Scooter Braun, which was the first label to sign Canadian singer Justin Bieber in 2008. Outside of music, Usher is acclaimed for involvement in humanitarian causes, having founded the charitable non-profit Usher's New Look in 1999.\n\nEarly life\n\nUsher was born as Usher Raymond IV on October 14, 1978, in Dallas, Texas.[9] His parents are Jonnetta Patton (née O'Neal; from Tennessee) and Usher Raymond III.[10][11] He spent the majority of his young life in Chattanooga, Tennessee. His father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother James Lackey (born 1984). Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga when he was nine years old. There, his grandmother discovered his ability to sing, although it was not until Usher joined a singing group that she considered he could sing professionally.[12] Believing that a bigger city would provide greater opportunities for showcasing his talent, Usher's family moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where there was a more conducive environment for beginning singers.[13] While in Atlanta, he attended North Springs High School.[14]\n\nCareer\n\nLate 1980s–1996: Musical beginnings and Usher\n\nAt age ten, Usher joined an R&B local quintet called the NuBeginnings, which was organized by local music promoter Darryl Wheeler. Usher recorded ten songs with the group in 1991, and the ensuing album, Nubeginning Featuring Usher Raymond IV, was only made available regionally and by mail order.[15] However, Patton took him out because, according to her, it was a \"bad experience\".[12] The album was re-released nationally in April 2002 by Hip-O Records.[15][16]\n\nAt age 13, Usher met A.J. Alexander at a local talent show in Atlanta.[17] Alexander, who at the time was Bobby Brown's bodyguard, would take Usher around and have him perform in parking lots and talent shows.[18] Alexander invited Bryant Reid, an A&R representative from LaFace Records to see Usher perform on the television talent show Star Search. Following the performance, he arranged an audition for Usher with L.A. Reid, the co-founder of LaFace; Reid signed Usher on the spot to a contract with the record company after Usher sang Boyz II Men hit record \"End of the Road\".[19][20] Usher's mother left her job as a medical technician to manage his career. Usher was introduced to the public on \"Call Me a Mack\", a song he recorded for the soundtrack album to the 1993 drama-romance film Poetic Justice.[15] During this time period, the young Usher first met Chilli of TLC, his label-mate whom he would later date.[citation needed]\n\nWhile preparing for his debut album, Usher lost his voice. He was going through puberty and had a difficult time adjusting his vocals. LA Reid became skeptical of Usher, put his album on hold and considered dropping him from the label.[21] Usher pleaded with the label to keep him and they did. From this point Reid didn't know what to do with Usher so he sent him to New York in the spring of 1994 to live with record executive Puff Daddy to \"attend\" what Reid called \"Flavor Camp\". Usher quickly adapted to the lavish lifestyle of Puff Daddy although in an interview with Rolling Stone, he described this period as the \"hardest days\" of his life. \"I had to knuckle up, figure shit out in New York\" he said.[22]\n\nOn August 30, 1994, LaFace released Usher's self-titled debut album behind the co-executive production of Sean \"P Diddy\" Combs.[19] Usher peaked at number twenty-five on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and was accompanied by three singles: \"Can U Get wit It\", \"Think of You\", and \"The Many Ways\".[23] The album has sold over 500,000 copies, to date.[24] The album received backlash because Usher was singing about sex, and him only being 15 years old, the public had a difficult time believing that this was so. Again LaFace had their reservations about signing Usher because the album wasn't as successful as they anticipated. At this time Usher's mother took control of his career and put him in more talent shows the summer of 1995 building Usher a larger fan base and ultimately giving L.A. Reid more confidence in Usher.[citation needed]\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Usher continued to develop his skills as a stage performer and laid the groundwork for his second album. He also appeared on LaFace's version of \"Let's Straighten It Out\", a 1995 duet with fellow Atlanta teen recording artist Monica;[25] and on \"Dreamin'\", from LaFace's 1996 Olympic Games benefit album Rhythm of the Games. He was also featured on \"I Swear I'm In Love\" off the soundtrack to the 1996 film Kazaam.[26]\n\n1997–2003: My Way and 8701\n\nUsher developed a friendship with American record producer Jermaine Dupri, with whom he co-wrote and produced several tracks for his second album, My Way, released on September 16, 1997. The album's lead single, \"You Make Me Wanna...\", reached number one in the United Kingdom, becoming Usher's first record to be top single; this resulted in him increasing in popularity.[27][28] It also became Usher's first gold- and platinum-certified single in the United States.[29] The album's second single, \"Nice & Slow\", peaked in January 1998 at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Usher his first US number-one single.[30] In February of the same year, the single was certified platinum by the RIAA. My Way has been certified seven-time platinum in the United States.[29][31]\n\n\"You Make Me Wanna...\" won the Best Male R&B/Soul Single at the 1999 Soul Train Music Awards.[32] In the closing months of 1997, Usher embarked on a series of tour engagements including a spot on Puffy's No Way Out tour, dates with Mary J. Blige, and the opening spot on Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope Tour. Usher's first concert album, Live, was released in 1999, which featured appearances by Lil' Kim, Jagged Edge, Trey Lorenz, Shanice, Twista and Manuel Seal; the album has been certified gold in the United States.[29]\n\nUsher made his acting debut on the UPN television series Moesha, which resulted in a recurring role on the series and subsequently his first film role in 1998's The Faculty.[13][24] Usher's extracurricular activities outside of the recording industry gathered momentum over the following year, as he was cast in the soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful.[13][24] He completed two more films, She's All That, and his first starring role in Light It Up.[13][24] He also appeared in the Disney TV movie Geppetto.[33]\n\nUsher's third studio album, originally titled All About U, was stated to be released in early 2001.[34] The first single, \"Pop Ya Collar\", was released in late 2000 and became a number two hit in the UK but underperformed in the United States.[35] The album was subsequently pushed back and retooled after select tracks were later leaked to the radio and Internet. At the same time, LaFace went dormant, moving most of its artists (including Usher) to its parent company, Arista Records.[citation needed] After having revised and renamed to 8701, the album was released on August 7, 2001 (8.7.01).[13] The first two singles \"U Remind Me\" and \"U Got It Bad\" each topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four and six weeks, respectively. 8701 has been certified five-time platinum in the United States.[29]\n\nUsher appeared in the 2001 film Texas Rangers.[36] In February 2002, Usher won a Grammy for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for \"U Remind Me\".[37] The next year, he won the same award for \"U Don't Have to Call\",[13] making Usher the only artist aside from Luther Vandross and Stevie Wonder to win this award consecutively. In the summer of 2002, Usher contributed vocals to P. Diddy's \"I Need a Girl, Part I\". The year closed out with a trio of TV series appearances, all in November, on The Twilight Zone, 7th Heaven, Moesha, and American Dreams, the latter in which Usher portrayed Marvin Gaye.[38][39]\n\n2004–2009: Confessions and Here I Stand\n\nUsher's fourth studio album, Confessions, was released on March 23, 2004—just as its first single, \"Yeah!\", was in its sixth week at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and fifth week on top of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles Chart.[40] The album's nearly 1.1 million unit debut sales was the highest first-week numbers ever scanned by a male R&B artist and the seventh best of the Nielsen SoundScan history.[41][42] The album has since sold over 20 million copies worldwide,[43] with over 14 million in the United States, earning the album a Diamond certification by the RIAA.[44][45][31]\n\nThe album's second and third singles, \"Burn\" and \"Confessions Part II\", also topped the Billboard Hot 100, the former for eight weeks. Usher became the first artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay with four consecutive number-one singles,[46] In September 2004, \"My Boo\", a duet with American singer-songwriter Alicia Keys, also peaked at number one at the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the album's fourth number-one single.[47] In December, the album's final single \"Caught Up\" peaked at number eight on the Hot 100.[35] By that time, Arista went inactive[48][49] and following its parent, BMG's merger with Sony Music,[50] his previous label, LaFace, was revived under the Jive/Zomba Group banner, bringing Usher back to the fold.[citation needed]\n\nConfessions earned Usher numerous awards, including four American Music Awards, two MTV Europe Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards, and three World Music Awards.[51][52][53][54] At the 47th annual Grammy Awards ceremony in 2005, Usher won three awards, including: R&B Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals for \"My Boo\", which he shared with Keys; Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Yeah!\"; and Contemporary R&B Album for Confessions. At the 2004 Billboard Music Awards, Usher was recognized Artist of the Year, in addition to receiving 10 other accolades.[55]\n\nUsher supported Confessions with \"The Truth Tour\". The tour set featured a small stage up on top of the main stage, where the band played with Usher and his supporting dancers left with enough room to perform. The smaller stage had a mini platform attached to it which lowered to the main stage and had two big staircases on both sides of it. To the left, a group of circular staircases climbed to the top, and to the right, there was a fire escape replete with steps and an elevator. Kanye West and Christina Milian were the opening acts for the tour.[56] Usher at select dates would bring out a special guest, during his Atlanta show taping he brought out his artist at the time Rico Love to rap a verse on the song \"Throwback\". During a more intimate part of the show, Usher's dancers selected singer Monica from the crowd to be serenaded by Usher while he sang album favorites \"Do it to Me\" and \"Superstar\". Usher also performed the Confessions Pt. II remix, where Kanye West would appear from back of the stage. Then lastly Usher would also bring out artist Lil Jon and Ludacris where they would finish the show performing the hit \"Yeah\". This concert date was filmed to make the official tour DVD of Truth Tour: Behind the Truth \"Live from Atlanta\". It has been certified by the RIAA selling more than 7 Million copies.[57]\n\nExternal image Usher on Rolling Stone magazine's cover in 2004\n\nIn the spring of 2005, Usher scored a number three Hot 100 hit as a featured vocalist on Lil Jon's \"Lovers & Friends\".[58] In 2007, Usher also collaborated with R. Kelly on the track \"Same Girl\", for Kelly's album Double Up.[59] He was also featured in a remix version of Omarion's \"Ice Box\".[60] Usher also appeared on the track \"Shake Down\" on American singer-songwriter Mary J. Blige's 2007 album Growing Pains.[61] According to Robert Hilburn of Los Angeles Times, Usher was voted number-one on the executive voting based \"Pop's Power List\" and described as a \"sure-fire property\".[62] In November 2005, Usher starred as a disc jockey named Darrell in the Lions Gate film In the Mix.[63]\n\nOn August 22, 2006, Usher took over the role of Billy Flynn in the long-running Broadway revival of the musical Chicago.[64] Usher's opening night brought out stars Penélope Cruz, Gabrielle Union, Clive Davis, and Rosie Perez among others.[65] Usher played the role of Flynn for two months but a case of strep throat brought an abrupt ending to Usher's run in Chicago, which saw a spike in ticket sales after he joined the cast. The New York Post reports that Usher's absence cost the production an estimated $400,000 in refunds to disappointed ticket buyers. The producer of Chicago, Barry Weissler, issued a statement sending his \"thoughts and best wishes to Usher for a quick and speedy recovery. Usher made a spectacular Broadway debut, bringing a great dedication, work ethic and his amazing talent to the show. We all hope that he might return at some point for the many fans that were unable to see his wonderful performance as Billy Flynn. Usher has found a new home on Broadway and is welcomed back anytime.\"[66]\n\nHere I Stand was released on May 26 in the United Kingdom and May 27, 2008, in the United States. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 Chart with first-week sales of over 433,000 copies.[67] To date Here I Stand has sold over 1.5 million copies in the United States,[68] been certified two-times platinum by the RIAA,[69] and has sold over 5 million copies worldwide.[70] While not approaching the success of his previous album, it received positive reviews from most music critics, who praised the maturity in the album's lyrics. To promote Usher's fifth studio album, the single \"Love In This Club\" was sent to radio in February 2008 and peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. It went on to spend three consecutive weeks at the top—becoming Usher's eighth number-one single and the fastest-rising song of his career.[67][71] It also reached No. 1 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The single was another huge international success for Usher. It reached No. 1 on the New Zealand Singles Chart, No. 3 on the Irish Singles Chart, No. 3 on the Eurochart Hot 100, No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart, No. 5 on the Japan Hot 100, No. 5 on the German Singles Chart, No. 5 on the Belgian Singles Chart (Flanders), No. 6 on the Canadian Hot 100, No. 8 on the Swedish Singles Chart, No. 8 on the Australian Singles Chart, No. 9 on the French Singles Chart, No. 9 on the Swiss Singles Chart, No. 10 on the Norwegian Singles Chart, No. 12 on the Austrian Singles Chart, No. 13 on the Belgian Singles Chart (Wallonia), and No. 18 on the Finnish Singles Chart. The follow-up single \"Love in This Club Part II\", which features American singer Beyoncé and rapper Lil Wayne, peaked at No. 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 7 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Its third single \"Moving Mountains\" peaked at No. 18 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and reached No. 6 on the New Zealand Singles Chart. The album's fifth single \"Trading Places\" peaked at No. 4 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[30] In September 2008, Usher announced he would embark on the 15-date tour One Night Stand, in which the audience is only females.[72] On January 18, 2009, Usher performed with Stevie Wonder and Shakira at the We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial. He also sang \"Gone Too Soon\" at the memorial of Michael Jackson on July 7, 2009.[73]\n\n2010–2011: Raymond v. Raymond and Versus\n\nRaymond v. Raymond was released on March 26, 2010, in Germany, March 30, 2010, in the US, and April 26, 2010, in the UK.[74] The album was expected to follow in Usher's Confessions album's footsteps. Raymond v. Raymond was released only months after Usher's divorce from Tameka Foster. \"Papers\", a song about divorce,[75] was released as the first single for the album in October 2009. It topped the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for two consecutive weeks, becoming his tenth number one single on that chart. It also peaked at number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. Critics praised the song for its emotion. \"Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home)\" was released as the second single on December 8, 2009. The single peaked at number 24[76] on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 2[77] on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The song was released as the second international single in July 2010. \"Lil Freak\" was announced as the album's official second single in the United States. Usher and Nicki Minaj shot the music video for the song on March 9, 2010, in Los Angeles with director TAJ Stansberry.[78] It reached number 8 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart[79] and number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100.[80] It became Usher's fourth Top 40 hit single from Raymond v. Raymond, when including the buzz single \"Papers\".[81]\n\n\"OMG\", which features will.i.am, is the third official US single and the first international single. The song received mixed reviews, complimenting the song's dance and club vibe but criticizing the Auto-Tune effect. It reached number-one in Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States.

He commented on how Usher wanted to do things differently on the album compared to his previous efforts, saying: \"What he wanted to do [on Looking 4 Myself] was explore himself musically. He stepped outside of what was safe and normal. He wanted to make an album that expressed where he was going sonically and not just where he's been for the past 12 to 15 years. He's growing, developing, moving, shaking, and being something that's new, cultural, and that's affecting people sonically. That's kind of forcing the people to grow and elevate\".[105] In an interview for MTV News, Usher stated that Looking 4 Myself is \"the most artistic of an album\" he has ever had in history.[106] When questioned by Reuters during an interview regarding the latter quote, and how this project was different, Usher explained that he felt he was near a 'rebirth' and that prior to Looking 4 Myself, he felt restricted and conformed to a specific standard. He said to himself \"I gotta go with what I feel and hopefully people will follow me\".[107]\n\nThe lead single from Usher's seventh studio album is titled \"Climax\".

[190]\n\nArtistry\n\nMusical style and influences\n\nUsher's music is generally R&B, but also incorporates pop among other genres.[5][191][192] Elias Leight of Rolling Stone wrote that \"catching pop's waves has always been one of Usher's greatest strengths, whether that means collaborating with Lil Jon when crunk was going mainstream or charging into EDM\".[193] Complex stated that Usher provided some of \"the best of pop music in R&B\".[194] His narratives have an autobiographical nature of emphasis on lifestyle, relationships and love,[195] resembling \"an R&B Casanova\".[196][197] Usher was new jack swing oriented,[198] while My Way contained influences of soul.[199] 8701 \"introduces touches of '80s rock guitar and the minimal rhythm of '80s hip hop\" displaying versatility, according to NME's Lucy O'Brien.[200] Confessions is viewed as a \"top-of-the-line pop-soul showcase\",[201] with established critic Robert Hilburn of Los Angeles Times seeing lead single \"Yeah!\" as something Michael Jackson would have created \"if he still had the old Thriller magic\".[202] Here I Stand was noted as more ballad-heavy by critics,[203] where the title track's usage of jazz notably drew comparisons to Stevie Wonder.[204] Raymond V Raymond was described as a \"skillful fusion of R&B/hip-hop/pop\" by Billboard.[205] Looking 4 Myself further explored progressive R&B, hip hop ballads, and synth pop, with its overall sound coined \"hybrid pop\" for its dynamic incorporation of EDM, dubstep, neo soul, and funk.[196][206][207] Hard II Love sees Rolling Stone's Maura Johnston view it to \"stretch the boundaries of R&B while winding toward the brooding atmospherics that have enveloped much of pop over the past 12 months\".[208]\n\nOn many occasions, Usher has named Michael Jackson as his biggest influence. Usher once told MTV, \"He influenced me in so many ways, more than just music ... as a humanitarian, as a philanthropist, as an artist, as an individual who transcended culture. I wouldn't be who I am today without Michael Jackson\".[209] During the television special 'Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special', Usher was able to dance with Jackson while performing \"You Rock My World\".[210] Prince being another main influence, Usher said \"every album I'd always do like one song that is very Prince-influenced, because he's a great influence on me musically, especially just kind of being expansive and creating music that represents many different genres.\"[211] In Time magazine's \"100 Most Influential People\" issue, he explained \"I was interested in music and trying to find a model. It was Michael, or it was Prince. He had an attitude, a rawness that Michael didn't have. He was not urban, but he was our version of what cool could be.\"[212] Other musical influences are Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Luther Vandross, Janet Jackson, Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, Al Green, and Boyz II Men.[213][214]\n\nThe boy band New Edition and its solo member Bobby Brown were childhood influences. Usher told ABC News, \"I can remember as a kid attending a New Edition Concert\", and called it \"one of the greatest moments in my performance history\" years later when he was invited on stage with the group to perform \"N.E. Heartbreak\" at a concert in Washington, D.C.[214] On Bobby Brown, Usher told CNN, \"the first record that I ever bought was Bobby Brown's Don't Be Cruel\", and that he admired him \"Just for being an edgy artist, being a true representative of R&B and rhythmic music\".[215] Usher's Live album would feature a medley performance of Brown's original singles - \"Don't Be Cruel\", \"Every Little Step\", \"Rock Wit'cha\", and \"Roni\". Usher was inspired by Frank Sinatra's My Way album released in 1969 so much that he decided to name his second album My Way.[216] Prince would inspire \"Nice & Slow\" while giving him his first number-one single on the Hot 100 chart.[212] Usher's third album 8701 would be inspired by love and heartache, containing influences from Donny Hathaway, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Michael Jackson.[217][218] His fourth album was inspired by the rap group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, and Eminem whom he credited for the album having a transparent reputation. Usher said in an interview with Sway Calloway, \"The honesty of hip-hop, and what Eminem was saying in his records, it motivated me. Like, yo if he could be that honest, you know through hip-hop - and there've been other stories, storytellers, but never quite as vivid as his...and I got that Cleveland, because, you know with the Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, you know what I'm saying, is to just understanding that the rhythm and the flip of it to make it be able to make it be at least, you know, hip-hop appropriate.\"[219]\n\nVocal style\n\nUsher possesses a leggiero tenor vocal range of 3 octaves and 4 notes,[220] and is considered to be \"one of the most soothing in R&B\".[5] At the age of 13, he set the record for the longest note ever held by a child on Star Search, with 12 seconds.[221] Usher's vocal coach since My Way, Jan Smith, cites him as \"the single most gifted singer I've ever worked with in 26 years\".[222] On the dynamic 8701, Rolling Stone's Kathryn McGuire describes his vocals as \"velvety\" and \"impressively adaptable\" as it won him his first two Grammys as Best Male R&B Vocal Performance.[223] With Confessions, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker generally noted him as \"long on control and short on texture\".[224] He received another Grammy Award nomination in 2006 through a cover of Luther Vandross's \"Superstar\" he performed on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2005.[225][226] Here I Stand displayed his vocals as \"agile\" and \"balletic\",[227] as well as his ability to \"easily drift from wavering tenor to fine-tuned falsetto\" that create emotions of urgency and burning according to Clover Hope of The Village Voice.[228] On his One Night Stand: Ladies Only Tour in 2008, Lee Hildebrand of San Francisco Chronicle assessed \"Usher's chest tones have a ringing, Gaye-like quality, and his high head tones suggest Prince's falsetto, but his frequent use of syllable-splitting curlicues owes much to Wonder. Usher is a stronger, more assured singer than he was a decade ago, though the melismas in his lower range sometimes meander off pitch. His falsetto tonality is more on target.\"[229]\n\nLooking For Myself exemplified his vocal craft earning him positive acclaim as Gawker's Rick Juzwiak states \"his vocal range is even more impressive than his emotional one\" with emphasis on his falsetto being \"something that sounds as natural as a speaking voice ... he's the picture of grace against shrieking synths ... His emotional range is vast enough to sell tenderness, lechery and wistfulness within minutes of each other\".[230] On \"Climax\", his performance lauded as \"blistering\" by Maura Johnston,[231] and \"hair-raising\" by Jody Rosen,[196] as he won Best R&B Performance in 2013.[232] \"There Goes My Baby\" and \"Dive\" are also commended as showcase standouts of his \"superior R&B vocal range\" by Consequence of Sound's Ryan Hadfield,[233] and MadameNoire's Brande Victorian.[234] For Hard II Love, Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented \"a genuinely expressive voice that encompasses an ardent croon, a melting falsetto and quick, singsong declamation\".[235] On the 2023 Rolling Stone's list of the 200 Greatest Singers of all time, Usher ranked at number 97.[236]\n\nPerformance\n\nUsher's stage performances have been complimented by critics as \"packed with high-octane choreography held together by sleek, masterful showmanship\",[237] and his presence \"engaging enough to pull off a one-man show\".[225][238] Vibe magazine notes him as being Bobby Brown-esque for his displays of \"brash sexuality and arrogance\",[239] leading to antics such as being \"prone to dropping his pants\",[240] and a \"tendency to shed his shirt on stage\",[241] while John Aizlewood of The Guardian observed that \"For all his pelvic thrusting and crotch-grabbing, Usher is a rather courtly presence.\"[242] On his 8701 Evolution Tour in 2002, Larry Nager of The Cincinnati Enquirer hailed his simultaneous ability, stating \"the 23-year-old Atlantan proved you can sing and dance at the same time. Of course, that's how James Brown, Jackie Wilson and Usher's most obvious role model Michael Jackson did it, but in today's high-tech, gimmicky concerts, it's a lost art\", claiming his show \"ended the reign of 'Nsync, Britney and the rest of the lip-synching, teen-pop acts\".[243] Usher told People magazine \"James Brown introduced me to soul.

Less than a month after the historic visit by President Barack Obama, a U.S. government cultural mission to Cuba took place from April 18–21, 2016.[445] The President described his trip as extending the hand of friendship to the Cuban people, and this delegation, including some of America's most distinguished writers, artists, musicians, as well as arts and cultural leaders, will continue this historic collaboration with the Cuban people.[446]\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 2001, Usher began dating TLC member Chilli Thomas, and their relationship lasted for three years. In 2003, Usher started working on the album that would become Confessions, which contained songs inspired by the personal lives of Usher and his collaborators. The songs about infidelity and pregnant mistresses were not inspired by Usher's private life, but by Jermaine Dupri's own personal challenges at the time.[447] Dupri deliberately intended to create an air of mystery about Usher, and arouse fans' curiosity about how much of the infidelity story was Usher's own confession.[447] The unintended result of this was to arouse Thomas's suspicions about Usher.[447] They broke up in December 2004.\n\nThis was followed by a media frenzy surrounding the personal nature of Confessions. Many fans believed that the infidelity portrayed in \"Confessions\" was real, and the real reason for the split.[12] In February 2004, in an interview on The Bert Show on the Atlanta radio channel Q100, Thomas was perceived as insinuating that Usher cheated on her: \"Usher did the ultimate no-no to me. ... I will never be with him again, and that is that\".[448] Usher defended: \"... it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain't what broke it up\".[12] This was backed up years later by Thomas, who said \"People assumed that album was about us, but it was not.\"[449]\n\nIn 2004, it was reported that Usher briefly dated British supermodel Naomi Campbell for a few months, together the pair attended the MTV Europe Music Awards and it was reported that Campbell jumped out of a pop out cake to surprise him for his birthday.[450] The following year, he was linked to model Eishia Brightwell for some time. They were seen together at different events including the Grammys, the Vanity Fair Oscar party and the NAACP Awards.[451]\n\nIn November 2005, Usher began dating stylist Tameka Foster, who worked as his personal stylist for several years.[452] Their engagement was announced in February 2007.[453] After the sudden cancellation of a planned July wedding in the Hamptons,[454][455] the two were wed on August 3, 2007, in a civil ceremony in Atlanta.[456] This was followed by a larger wedding ceremony on September 1, 2007, held at the Chateau Elan Winery & Resort outside Atlanta.[457]\n\nUsher's father, Usher Raymond III, died of a heart attack on January 21, 2008.[458] For a short period of time shortly after the death of his father, Usher adopted a vegan diet.[459][460] After several years, Usher dropped all egg and dairy products, embracing an entirely vegan diet for health reasons.[461] Usher years later told reporters that he stopped his vegan diet saying that maintaining the lifestyle was expensive.[462]\n\nUpon his marriage to Foster, Usher became a stepfather to Foster's three sons from previous relationships, one born when she was a teenager and two from her first marriage to Atlanta clothier Ryan Glover.[452][453] Usher and Foster also have two sons together: Usher \"Cinco\" Raymond V, born in November 2007,[463] and Naviyd Ely Raymond, born in December 2008.[464]\n\nIn February 2009, two months after the birth of their second son, Foster suffered a cardiac arrest in São Paulo, Brazil, when she was given general anesthesia prior to scheduled cosmetic surgery (reportedly liposuction), which was ultimately not performed.[465] She was induced into a coma to aid her recovery and was transferred to a larger facility, the Hospital Sírio-Libanês.[465] Usher canceled his performance at Clive Davis's pre-Grammy Gala in order to fly to Brazil to be with Foster.[465] After a week of recovery, Foster's surgeon issued a statement saying that she was \"doing very well\".[465]\n\nUsher filed for divorce from Foster in June 2009 in Atlanta.[466] The divorce was legally finalized in Fulton County Court on November 4, 2009.[467] This preceded a highly publicized child custody dispute spanning three years, which ultimately culminated on August 24, 2012, with a judge awarding Usher primary custody of his two sons with Foster.[468][469]\n\nIn 2011, Forbes magazine placed Usher at number 32 on its Celebrity 100,[470] and reported his earnings after the OMG Tour to stand at $46 million, ranking him at number 12 on \"The World's 25 Highest-Paid Musicians\" list.[471]\n\nFoster's 11-year-old son Kile Glover, Usher's former stepson, was declared brain dead on July 8, 2012, after being struck by a personal water craft on Lake Lanier the previous day.[472][473] Glover died on July 21, 2012, after being removed from life support.[474] Just over a year later, on August 5, 2013, Usher's eldest son, Usher V, was hospitalized in the ICU after he became stuck in a drain while swimming in a pool at Usher's home.[475] The next day, Foster filed a request for an emergency custody hearing in Fulton County Superior Court, seeking temporary primary custody and citing Usher V's \"near-death accident\" as evidence of a lack of supervision of the children.[476] At the hearing on August 9, 2013, the case was dismissed and Usher retained primary custody of their two sons.[477]\n\nIn September 2015, Usher quietly married his long-time girlfriend and manager Grace Miguel while vacationing in Cuba. There was speculation of the two being married when Miguel's Instagram post showed a picture of a gold wedding band on Usher's finger. He confirmed the marriage during an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.[478][479]\n\nOn July 19, 2017, documents leaked online allege that Usher has been a carrier of the herpes virus since 2009 or 2010 and that he infected a partner with it in 2012. It alleges that Usher paid the woman's doctor bills and settled a civil suit with her for $1.1 million.[480] Amid the allegations, TMZ reported that another woman filed a $10 million lawsuit against Usher claiming that he exposed her to the herpes virus without her knowledge or consent, which is a crime in certain states.[481] TMZ followed up this story with another alleging that she increased her lawsuit to $20 million after testing positive.\n\nThree more claimants sued him on allegations of fraud, sexual battery, infliction of emotional distress and more, alleging that he was positive for the herpes virus and did not tell them in advance. All three were represented by attorney Lisa Bloom, who said on August 8, 2017, that one of her three clients had contracted genital herpes allegedly from him. One of the accusers, Quantasia Sharpton, said she had unprotected sex with him after a concert she attended. The other two accusers, one male and one female, preferred to remain anonymous plaintiffs.[482] Sharpton admitted she tested negative and Bloom stated she did not know if the singer had the disease.[483]\n\nOn March 6, 2018, Usher and wife Grace Miguel informed Us Weekly of their separation in a statement that read, in part: \"After much thought and consideration we have mutually decided to separate as a couple ... We remain deeply connected, loving friends who will continue supporting each other through the next phases of our lives\".[484] On December 28, 2018, Usher filed for divorce from Miguel in Georgia.[485]\n\nIn September 2020, it was confirmed that Usher was expecting his third child, with music executive Jenn Goicoechea, whom he reportedly started dating in October 2019.[486][487] Their daughter was born on September 24, 2020.[488] Usher and Goicoecha welcomed their second child together on September 29, 2021.[489] Usher and Goiciechea married in Las Vegas, Nevada on February 11, 2024.[490]\n\nDiscography\n\nMain article: Usher discography\n\nStudio albums\n\nUsher (1994)\n\nMy Way (1997)\n\n8701 (2001)\n\nConfessions (2004)\n\nHere I Stand (2008)\n\nRaymond v.
