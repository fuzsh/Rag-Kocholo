        "text": "The Super Bowl halftime show is reserved for the biggest names in the music world, and there are fewer bigger than Usher.\n\nThe R&B singer and actor, full name Usher Raymond VI, has sold over 80 million albums throughout his career, which started when he was a teenager in the mid-1990s. Usher has nine number-one singles as a lead artist and several top-five hits as a featured artist.\n\nWith Usher's career hitting the 30-year mark last year, there are a lot of hits for the American star to draw from when putting together his Super Bowl halftime show set list.\n\nHere are some of his bigger and best-known songs.\n\nYeah! (feat. Lil Jon and Ludacris)\n\nArguably Usher's best-known song, \"Yeah!\" is a 2004 collaboration with fellow Atlanta artists Lil Jon and Ludacris.\n\nThe stripped down production by Lil Jon is highlighted by the trademark horns that helped make \"Yeah!\" the biggest song of 2004, according to Billboard.\n\nYou Make Me Wanna...\n\nThe song that put Usher on the map, \"You Make Me Wanna...\" was released in Aug. 1997 when he was still just 18 years old.\n\nMy Boo (with Alicia Keys)\n\nA duet between Usher and Alicia Keys, the two superstars shot straight to the top of the charts with this ballad about two ex-lovers reminiscing about better times.\n\nLove In This Club (feat. Young Jeezy)\n\nOne of Usher's racier tunes, the mid-tempo song is driven by the singer's delivery of the steamy lyrics and Young Jeezy's breathy interlude.\n\nOMG (feat. will.i.am)\n\nWritten and produced by Black Eyed Peas frontman will.i.am, \"OMG\" brought Usher into the 2010s with a more electronic sound.\n\nLike every other song on this list, it topped the Billboard Hot 100 as well as many international charts."
