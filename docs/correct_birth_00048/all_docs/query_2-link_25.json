We know as a smaller city, we punch way above our weight when it comes to the talent our city produces, and Usher is one of the finest examples of that talent. He’s going to feel the love when he comes home to McKenzie Arena on April 20. I look forward to seeing y’all there.\"\n\nBack in October 2023, Usher was gifted a key to the city of Las Vegas ahead of his critically acclaimed Super Bowl performance. \"Thank you so much for this momentous moment. I know the efforts that go into doing something like this, and I don’t take it for granted,” he told Councilman Cedric Crear and Mayor Carolyn Goodman during the ceremony. “I wanna thank you for your belief in the future and your ability to be able to recognize those things that actually do grow your city. I am someone who is now just contributing by way of entertainment, but also to the heartbeat of the city.” The Nevada metropolis also declared Oct. 17 Usher Raymond Day.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
