        "text": "Usher Raymond IV (born October 14, 1978) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actor. Born in Dallas, Texas but raised and lived in Chattanooga, Tennessee until moving to Atlanta, Georgia. At the age of 12, his mother put him in local singing competitions, before catching the attention of a music A&R from LaFace Records. In August 1994 he released his self-titled debut album, Usher. He rose to fame in the late 1990s with the release of his sophomore album My Way(1997), which spawned his first U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, “Nice & Slow”, with top-five singles “You Make Me Wanna…” and “My Way” earning him his first two Grammy Award nominations in 1998 and 1999. His third studio album 8701 (2001), produced the number-one singles “U Remind Me” and “U Got It Bad”. The former won him his first Grammy Award in 2002, along with “U Don’t Have to Call” in 2003 for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance.\n\nConfessions (2004) established him as one of the best-selling musical artists of the 2000s decade. It sold over 20 million copies worldwide, bolstered by its four consecutive Billboard Hot 100 number one singles —\"Yeah!“, \"Burn”, “Confessions Part II”, and “My Boo\"—and has been certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Confessions earned him three Grammy Awards in 2005, including Best Contemporary R&B Album. Here I Stand (2008) and Raymond v. Raymond (2010), debuted atop the Billboard 200, produced the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Love in This Club” and “OMG”. The EP, Versus, also produced the Hot 100 top-five single “DJ Got Us Fallin’ in Love”. Looking 4 Myself (2012), also debuted atop of the Billboard 200 chart and produced the Hot 100 top-ten single “Scream”. Raymond v. Raymond and Looking 4 Myself notably received Grammy Awards for R&B singles “There Goes My Baby” and “Climax”.\n\nThe RIAA ranks Usher as one of the best-selling artists in American music history, having sold over 23.8 million albums and 38.2 million digital songs in the United States alone. To date, his worldwide sales stand over 43 million albums and 75 million records overall, making him one of the best-selling music artists. Usher has won numerous awards including eighteen Billboard Music Awards and eight Grammy Awards. At the end of 2009, Billboard named him the number-one Hot 100 artist of the 2000s decade, the second most successful artist of the 2000s decade, and ranked Confessions as the top solo album of the 2000s decade. Billboard also placed him at number six on their list of “Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years”. Usher has attained nine Hot 100 number-one singles. He has been inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2008, he started his own record label Raymond-Braun Media Group (RBMG) a joint venture with talent manager Scooter Braun. The most prominent artist Raymond represents is Justin Bieber.\n\nEarly life\n\nUsher was born in Dallas, Texas, the son of Jonetta Patton (née O'Neal), from Tennessee, and Usher Raymond III. Usher spent the majority of his young life in Chattanooga: his father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother, James Lackey (born 1984). Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga, when he was nine years old; there, his grandmother discovered his ability to sing, although it was not until Usher joined a singing group that she considered he could sing professionally. In the belief that a bigger city would provide greater opportunities for showcasing his talent, Usher’s family moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where there was a more conducive environment for beginning singers. While in Atlanta, Usher attended North Springs High School.\n\nCareer\n\n1987–96: Musical beginnings and Usher\n\nAt age 10, Usher joined an R&B local quintet called the NuBeginnings, which was organized by local music svengali, Darryl Wheeler. Usher recorded 10 songs with the group in 1991, and the ensuing album, Nubeginning Featuring Usher Raymond IV, was only made available regionally and by mail order. However, Patton took him out because, according to her, it was a “bad experience”. The album was re-released nationally in April 2002 by Hip-O Records.\n\nAt age 13, Usher competed on Star Search, where he was spotted by an A&R representative from LaFace Records, who arranged an audition for Usher with L.A. Reid, the co-founder of LaFace; Reid signed Usher on the spot to a contract with the record company after singing Boyz II Men hit record “End of the Road” . Usher’s mother left her job as a medical technician to manage his career, but later broke up their relationship as manager-client in May 2007. Usher was introduced on “Call Me a Mack”, a song he recorded for the soundtrack album to the 1993 drama-romance film Poetic Justice. During this time period is where young Usher first met Chilli, his label mate who he would later date down the road.\n\nPreparing for his debut album the unthinkable thing happens to Usher and he loses his voice. Usher was going through puberty and having a difficult time adjusting his voice. LA Reid became skeptical of Usher and put his recording on hold thinking about dropping him from the label. Usher pleaded with the label to keep him and L.A. Reid did. From this point Reid didn’t know what to do with Usher so he sent him to New York in the spring of 1994 to live with Puff Daddy to attend what Reid called “Flavor Camp”. Usher quickly adapted to the lavish lifestyle of Puff Daddy although in an interview with Rolling Stone, he expressed it as the “Hardest days” of his life. “I had to knuckle up, figure shit out in New York” he said. As he lived at Puff’s house in Scarsdale, he noticed that “There was always girls around”.\n\nOn August 30, 1994, LaFace released Usher’s self-titled debut album behind the co-executive production of Sean “P Diddy” Combs.Usher peaked at number twenty-five on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and was accompanied by three singles: “Can U Get wit It”, “Think of You”, and “The Many Ways”. The album has sold over 500,000 copies, to date. The album received backlash because Usher was singing about sex which the public had a hard time believing coming out of a 14-year-old’s mouth. Again the LaFace had their reservations about signing Usher because the album wasn’t as successful as they anticipated. At this time Jonetta Patton, Usher’s mother took control of his career and put him in more talent shows the summer of 1995 building Usher a larger fan base and ultimately putting more confidence in L.A. Reid.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Usher continued to develop his skills as a stage performer and laid the groundwork for his second album. He also appeared on their version of “Let’s Straighten It Out”, a 1995 duet with fellow Atlanta teen recording artist Monica; and on “Dreamin’”, from LaFace’s 1996 Olympic Games benefit album Rhythm of the Games. He was also featured on “I Swear I’m In Love” off the 1996 Kazaam soundtrack.\n\n1997–2003: My Way and 8701\n\nUsher developed a friendship with American record producer, Jermaine Dupri, with whom he co-wrote and produced several tracks for his second album, My Way, released on September 16, 1997. The album’s lead single, “You Make Me Wanna…”, reached number one in the United Kingdom, becoming Usher’s first record to be top single; the record led to his popularity reaching in the country. It also became Usher’s first gold- and platinum-certified single in the United States. The album’s second single, “Nice & Slow”, peaked in January 1998 at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Usher his first US number-one single. Later in February of the same year, the single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America; My Way has been certified six-time platinum in the United States.\n\n“You Make Me Wanna…” won the Best Male R&B/Soul Single at the 1999 Soul Train Music Awards. In the closing months of 1997, Usher embarked on a series of tour engagements including a spot on Puffy's No Way Out tour, dates with Mary J. Blige, and the opening spot on Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope Tour. Usher’s first concert album, Live, was released in 1999, which featured appearances by Lil’ Kim, Jagged Edge, Trey Lorenz, Shanice, Twista and Manuel Seal; the album has been certified gold in the United States.\n\nUsher made his acting debut on the UPN television series Moesha, which resulted in a recurring role on the series and subsequently his first film role in 1998's The Faculty. Usher’s extracurricular activities outside of the recording industry gathered momentum over the following year as he was cast in the soap opera, The Bold and the Beautiful. He completed two more films, She’s All That, and his first starring role in Light It Up. He also appeared in the Disney TV movie Geppetto.\n\nUsher’s third studio album, originally titled All About U, was slated to be released in early 2001. The first single, “Pop Ya Collar”, was released in late 2000 and became a number two hit in the UK but underperformed in the United States. The album was subsequently pushed back and retooled after select tracks were later leaked to the radio and Internet. After having revised and renamed to 8701, the album was released August 7, 2001 (8.7.01). The first two singles “U Remind Me” and “U Got It Bad” each topped the BillboardHot 100 for four and six weeks, respectively. 8701 has been certified four-time platinum in the United States.\n\nUsher appeared in the 2001 film Texas Rangers. In February 2002, Usher won a Grammy for ‘Best Male R&B Vocal Performance’ for “U Remind Me”. The next year, he won the same award for “U Don’t Have to Call”, making Usher the only artist aside from Luther Vandross and Stevie Wonder to win this award consecutively. In summer 2002, Usher contributed vocals to P. Diddy’s “I Need a Girl, Part I”. The year closed out with a trio of TV series appearances, all in November, on The Twilight Zone, 7th Heaven, Moesha, andAmerican Dreams, the latter in which Usher portrayed Marvin Gaye.\n\n2004–09: Confessions and Here I Stand\n\nUsher’s fourth studio album, Confessions, was released on March 23, 2004—just as its first single, “Yeah!”, was in its sixth week at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and fifth week on top of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles Chart. The album’s nearly 1.1 million unit debut sales was the highest first-week numbers ever scanned by a male R&B artist and the seventh best of the Nielsen SoundScan history. To date, the album has accumulated sales of over 20 million copies worldwide, over 10 million of which were sold in the United States, earning the album a Diamond certification by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nThe album’s second and third singles, “Burn” and “Confessions Part II”, also topped the Billboard Hot 100, the former for eight weeks. Usher became the first artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay with four consecutive number-one singles, In September 2004, “My Boo”, a duet with American singer-songwriter Alicia Keys, also peaked at number one at the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the album’s fourth number-one single. In December, the album’s final single “Caught Up” peaked at number eight on the Hot 100.\n\nConfessions earned Usher numerous awards, including four American Music Awards, two MTV Europe Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards, and three World Music Awards. At the 47th annual Grammy Awards ceremony in 2005, Usher won three awards, including: R&B Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals for “My Boo”, which he shared with Keys; Rap/Sung Collaboration for “Yeah!”; and Contemporary R&B Album for Confessions. At the 2004 Billboard Music Awards, Usher was recognized Artist of the Year, in addition to receiving 10 other accolades.\n\nUsher supported Confessions with the “The Truth Tour”. The tour set featured a small stage up on top of the main stage, where the band played with Usher and his supporting dancers left with enough room to perform. The smaller stage had a mini platform attached to it which lowered to the main stage and had two big staircases on both sides of it. To the left, a group of circular staircases climbed to the top, and to the right, there was a fire escape replete with steps and an elevator. Kanye West and Christina Milian was the opening act for the tour. Usher at select dates would bring out special guest, during his Atlanta show taping he brought out his artist at the time Rico Love to rap a verse on the song “Throwback”. During a more intimate part of the showing Ushers dancers selected singer Monica from the crowd to be serenaded by Usher while he sang album favorites “Do it to Me” and “Superstar”. Usher also performed Confessions Pt. II remix where Kanye would appear from back of the stage. Then lastly Usher would also bring out artist Lil Jon and Ludacris where they would finish the show performing the hit “Yeah”. This concert date was filmed to make the official tour DVD of Truth Tour: Behind the Truth “Live from Atlanta”. It has been certified by the RIAA selling more than 7 Million copies.\n\nIn spring of 2005, Usher scored a number three Hot 100 hit as a featured vocalist on Lil’ Jon’s “Lovers & Friends”. In 2007, Usher also collaborated with R. Kelly on the track “Same Girl”, for Kelly’s album, Double Up. He was also featured in a remix version of Omarion’s “Ice Box”. Usher also appeared on the track “Shake Down” on American singer-songwriter Mary J. Blige’s 2007 album Growing Pains. In November 2005, Usher starred as a disc jockey named Darrell in the Lions Gate film, In the Mix.\n\nOn August 22, 2006, Usher took over the role of Billy Flynn in the long-running Broadway musical Chicago. Usher, whose opening night this week brought out stars Penélope Cruz, Gabrielle Union, Clive Davis, and Rosie Perez, and others. Usher played the role of Flynn for two months but a case of strep throat brought an abrupt ending to Usher’s run in the Broadway revival of the musicalChicago, which saw a spike in ticket sales after he joined the cast. The New York Post reports that Usher’s absence has cost the production an estimated $400,000 in refunds to disappointed ticket buyers. Producer of Chicago, Barry Weissler also issued a statement sending his thoughts and best wishes to Usher for a quick and speedy recovery. Usher made a spectacular Broadway debut, bringing a great dedication, work ethic and his amazing talent to the show. We all hope that he might return at some point for the many fans that were unable to see his wonderful performance as Billy Flynn. Usher has found a new home on Broadway and is welcomed back anytime.“\n\nHere I Stand was released on May 26 in the United Kingdom and May 27, 2008, in the United States. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 Chart with first-week sales of over 433,000 copies. To date Here I Stand has now sold over 1.5 million copies in the United States, been certified platinum by the RIAA, and has sold over 5 million copies worldwide. While not approaching the success of his previous album, it received positive reviews from most music critics, who praised the maturity in the album’s lyrics. To promote Usher’s fifth studio album, the single \"Love In This Club” was sent to radio in February 2008 and peaked at number one on theBillboard Hot 100.

His seventh studio album Looking 4 Myself was released on June 8, 2012, worldwide and received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. American singer-songwriter and record producer Rico Love was interviewed by Billboard magazine stuff, where he spoke about his relationships with artists and experiences. He commented on how Usher wanted to do things differently on the album compared to his previous efforts, saying: “What he wanted to do [on Looking 4 Myself] was explore himself musically. He stepped outside of what was safe and normal. He wanted to make an album that expressed where he was going sonically and not just where he’s been for the past 12 to 15 years. He’s growing, developing, moving, shaking, and being something that’s new, cultural, and that’s affecting people sonically. That’s kind of forcing the people to grow and elevate”. In an interview for MTV News, Usher stated that Looking 4 Myself is “the most artistic of an album” he has ever had in history. When questioned by Reuters during an interview regarding the latter quote, and how this project was different, Usher explained that he felt he was near a 'rebirth’ and that prior to Looking 4 Myself, he felt restricted and conformed to a specific standard. He said to himself “I gotta go with what I feel and hopefully people will follow me”.\n\nThe lead single from Usher’s seventh studio album is titled “Climax”. It impacted Urban radio on February 21, 2012, and was made available for purchase as a digital download on February 22, 2012. It impacted US mainstream radio on March 13, 2012.

Talking to The Fader, he described the album as “everything you can imagine”, saying that it’s “gonna be freaking out of here”. In an interview with singer-songwriter Eric Bellinger by Rap-Up, the former explained that he, along with Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, and Brian Alexander Morgan, was working on Usher’s next album. Bellinger compared the album’s music to Usher's Confessions (2004), saying that it is “more R&B, more urban” than Usher's Looking 4 Myself. The latter declared that his next album would show that he is “still Usher”. “Good Kisser”, a dance-heavy throwback R&B track, was released as the first single allowing Usher to achieve his 13th no.1 on the Airplay chart, tying Drake for most leaders in the list’s history.

Usher performed the song for the first time at the Tidal X:1020 concert on October 20, 2015 at Brooklyn’s Barclays Arena. On January 14, 2016, after continual delays of his eighth album, Usher announced via Daniel Arsham Instagram post that he changed the title of the album from UR to Flawed. It was scheduled to be released in April 2016, but has been pushed back with no release date. On June 9, 2016, Usher released a new single from his expected forthcoming albumFlawed on the music streaming platform Tidal titled “No Limit” featuring Young Thug, along with a second single titled “Crash” on June 10 for all digital platforms.\n\nOn June 12, 2016 it was reported that Raymond signed a management deal with business partner Scooter Braun, who represents Justin Bieber whom him and Raymond have a joint venture with. This report was confirmed by Usher while doing a sit down interview with Ryan Seacrest at the 73rd annual Cannes Lions Festival in Cannes, France during a panel on June 21, 2016. Usher furthered his acting career, starring as American former professional boxer Sugar Ray Leonard in the 2016 American-Panamanian biographical sports film Hands of Stone about the career of Panamanian former professional boxer Roberto Durán.

Contextually, Usher’s music has an autobiographical nature with emphasis of lifestyle, relationships and love. NME’s Lucy O'Brien marks that 8701“introduces touches of '80s rock guitar and the minimal rhythm of '80s hip hop”, noting that “Versatility is the key here: staccato beats with mellifluous melody, rich slow-jams and edgy harmonies”. On Raymond v. Raymond and Looking For Myself, he explores Synthpop, hence further expanding his appeal and range by collaborating with Latin and dance artists like Pitbull, Romeo Santos, and David Guetta. Complex editors view Usher’s artistry to bring out “the best of pop music in R&B”. They described his dynamism of working with a range of contemporary genres and producers as “Neptunes Usher” in reference to “U Don’t Have to Call”, “Crunk Usher” in reference to “Yeah!”, and “EDM Usher” in reference to “Climax”. Hard II Love sees Rolling Stone’s Maura Johnston further commend his ability, claiming the album “manages to stretch the boundaries of R&B while winding toward the brooding atmospherics that have enveloped much of pop”, whereas Stereogum’s Chris DeVille expands “The guy’s natural singing prowess and effortless ability to jump across genre make him a national treasure.”\n\nOn many occasions, Usher has named Michael Jackson as his biggest influence. Usher once told MTV, “He influenced me in so many ways, more than just music ….. as a humanitarian, as a philanthropist, as an artist, as an individual who transcended culture. I wouldn’t be who I am today without Michael Jackson.” During the television special 'Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special’, Usher was able to dance with Michael while performing “You Rock My World”. Prince being another main influence, Usher said “every album I’d always do like one song that is very Prince-influenced, because he’s a great influence on me musically, especially just kind of being expansive and creating music that represents many different genres.” In Time magazine’s “100 Most Influential People” issue, he explained “I was interested in music and trying to find a model. It was Michael, or it was Prince. He had an attitude, a rawness that Michael didn’t have. He was not urban, but he was our version of what cool could be.” In addition, he has spoken of Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder as great musicians and philanthropists stating that “they figured out what they were as they were going, by inspiration as well…allowing their music to speak to where they were and what they had to say”. Other musical influences include Luther Vandross, Janet Jackson, Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, Al Green, Boyz II Men, and Bobby Brown.\n\nUsher was inspired by Frank Sinatra's My Way album released in 1969 so much that he decided to name his sophomore album My Way. Prince would inspire “Nice & Slow” while giving him his first number-one single on Billboard 100. Usher’s third album 8701 would be inspired by love and heartache, containing influences from Donny Hathaway, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Michael Jackson. His fourth album was inspired by rapper Eminem, who he credited for being transparent. Usher said in an interview with Sway Calloway; “the honesty of hip-hop and what Eminem was saying on his records it motivated me, like, if he can be that honest through hip-hop – and there’d been other story tellers but never quite as vivid as his. So I was like, we need to keep it real like him. I wanna go all the way in.”\n\nVocal style\n\nRaymond possesses a Leggiero tenor vocal range of 3 octaves and 2 notes. At the age of 13, he set the record for the longest note ever held by a child on Star Search, with 12 seconds. Rick Juzwiak speaks “his vocal range is even more impressive than his emotional one” with emphasis on his falsetto being “something that sounds as natural as a speaking voice…he’s the picture of grace against shrieking synths”. Juzwiak emphasizes the singer’s expressiveness by commenting “his emotional range is vast enough to sell tenderness, lechery and wistfulness within minutes of each other”. Usher had been working with Atlanta Grammy nominated music and vocal producer as well as vocal coach, Jan Smith, since his teenage years on early albums such as My Way and 8701. Smith cites Usher as “the single most gifted singer I’ve ever worked with in 26 years”. On Looking For Myself Usher received positive acclaim for his vocal ability on singles such as \"Climax” and “Dive”. Consequence of Sound’s Ryan Hadfield praised Usher stating that he was showing his “superior R&B vocal range”. Matt Fibula from PopMatters added “Usher’s voice has never sounded better—and that’s saying a lot”. MadameNoire named him on their list of \"Male Singers With the Best Falsetto Game”, citing songs such as “Superstar” and “Can U Handle It?” from Confessions along with “There Goes My Baby” and “Climax” as his most exemplifying ones.\n\nPerformance and showmanship\n\nUsher has received praise for his stage presence and voice during live performances. His performances and dancing technique have often marked comparisons to his idols Michael Jackson and James Brown. He told People Magazine in 2008 that “James Brown introduced me to soul. Because of him I was given a clear view of what a real performance is and should be. I learned showmanship from him.” Jim Harrington from The Mercury News said “Usher is a man of many talents. - Yet, his biggest selling point on the live stage remains his fancy footwork. This guy can dance like nobody’s business.” Chad Batka for The New York Times said “He has established himself as one of R&B’s supreme performers and craftsmen, following through on what he learned from Michael Jackson in particular: songs that alternate between choppy and smooth, vocals punctuated by exultant high whoops, a dance vocabulary.”Rolling Stone describes him as the “Award Show King”. Maura Johnston explains that “His dedication to choreography dates back to the days when Janet Jackson made videos that looked like they were shot in one take. He’s an entertainer that would have been stunning at any point in the last 60 years of television.”\n\nArt and feminism\n\nUsher is a staunch fan of art and also supports feminism. In 2014 December, he attended Art Basel Miami and participated in an art installation at JJ Brine’s VECTOR Gallery at Select Fair by performance artist Lena Marquise “Body As Commodity” during which she offered collectors to purchase 10 minutes of energy for $100. The news of the participation became the #1 reported on event of Art Basel Though Usher refused to issue any official statements about his participation, many assume his participation has to do with support for art and feminism due to the topic and tone of Usher’s recent release at the time of song “I Don’t Mind” featuring Juicy J which talks about supporting the work of an exotic dancer, hinting at his support for the new wave of feminism.\n\nUsher is an art collector; in an interview with Vulture he said: “It’s significant to where you are in your life,” explaining his turn to art collecting. “As you get older and have children, your reflections on what matters begin to change.” Raymond says “I started slowing it down,” he went on, “enjoying the places I went, going to museums, understanding the nature of what artists were trying to say.” Raymond is good friend with graffiti and street-style-inspired artists RETNA, who did the cover art for Justin Biebers studio album “Purpose” as well is a contemporary American artist, Daniel Arsham who directed his music video “Chains” and did the cover art for his singles “No Limit” and “Crash”.\n\nOn Tuesday, June 2, 2015 Usher was honored alongside Robert Di Nero by the Gordon Park Foundation Dinner and Auction in downtown Manhattan for his contributions to the arts at a charity gala in New York. Receiving the Gordon Parks Patron of the Arts Award, named in honor of the late photographer-turned-filmmaker Gordon Parks.\n\nPublic image\n\nUsher is widely regarded as a sex symbol from a young age, predominantly for his stage persona. Fusion states “Usher—one of the greatest R&B sex symbols in the past 20 years, paving the way for Chris Brown, Trey Songz and Justin Bieber—used sex as a major part of his image”, while VH1 considers him to be “the sexiest male performer ever to walk a stage”. People magazine named Usher the “Sexiest R&B Star” in 1998, quoting singer Monica who said on stage, the sexiness was manifest in “his movements, his gestures, the way he expresses his lyrics.” Actress Adrienne Frantz who played with Usher in The Bold and the Beautiful also said “Usher definitely has a way with women. His smile is sweet and sexy at the same time”, adding “he’s a great kisser.” Usher made the cut forPeople magazine’s “Sexiest Men Alive” in 2004, as he did 4 years later again in 2008. In 2005, Madame Tussauds New York unveiled a wax figure of Usher during a competition to launch The Usher Interactive Experience. Another wax figure was unveiled alongside other singers for the opening of a “VIP room” in 2007. Rihanna told MTV in 2006 “I was in love with Usher when he first came out. I was just like he’s so fine![…]I thought he was the hottest thing. I think he was my first crush definitely.” After his marriage, the sexual nature of his music was expected to mature as The New Yorker writer Sasha Frere-Jones writes “The challenge here is to convince us that he is a married and responsible man—grown and sexy, without sacrificing the louche, frictionless sense of play that made him famous.” VH1 have listed Usher at number 9 of its 100 Sexiest Artists List. According to Glamour magazine, Usher was one of the “50 Sexiest Men of 2010”. In 2012, Billboard reviewed his fashion evolution stating “The singer came onto the scene in the '90s rocking baggy jeans and suits that made us question his celebrity status, but over the years this R&B star has developed his own signature look, rendering him a modern day fashion icon”. In 2013, Complex magazine placed Usher in its “Most Stylish R&B Singers of the 90’s\" list. InStyle magazine rate him both for sex appeal and style as he was included their “Hottest Celebrity Abs” collection before coming under “37 of the Most Stylish Dads”.\n\nLegacy\n\nBillboard named Usher the Hot 100 Artist of the 2000s decade.

He also scored eight No. 1s on the R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart more than any other artist. Confessions was ranked as the top solo album of the decade, selling over 20 million copies worldwide. Considered by Vibe to be “the Thriller of our generation”, Complex says the album “became pop culture catnip” because of its theme. Pop music critic, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker remarks that “For a while, Confessions was pop music” and says it “may turn out to have been the last true blockbuster in pop”. According to Angus Batey of The Guardian, Usher is “hailed as the best dancer in pop since Michael Jackson, and credited with inventing Justin Timberlake (the former 'N Sync star’s debut album was built from Usher’s blueprint).” Jody Rosen says “He’s the biggest male pop singer in the world; sometimes, it seems like he’s the only one, in a marketplace still dominated by divas”, and describes him as “the most reliable hit-maker of his generation”. Usher has attained 9 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles, tied with the Bee Gees, Elton John, and Paul McCartney.\n\nJames Brown, known as the Godfather of Soul, performed a duet with Usher in 2005 at the 47th Grammy Awards in which he honorably dubbed him the “Godson of Soul”. Brown reiterated “The new godson; Usher, the new godson” following the performance. Usher later responded saying “James Brown will always be the Godfather of Soul and to receive that compliment was great on national television.” Usher was inducted into the 29th Annual Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 2007, and the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2016 with a star located at 6201 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nBillboard ranked “Yeah!” at number 14 in their “Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Songs”, while VH1 ranked it at number 15 in their “Greatest Songs of the 2000s”.

If they don’t have the tools, young men and women from underserved communities can’t even begin to understand the idea of having a new or different perspective. So that’s where this collaboration came together giving young people the tools and supplying them with hope.”\n\nEndorsements\n\nUsher has worked with MasterCard since 2004, together they launched the Usher Debit MasterCard.

Just over a year later, on August 5, 2013, Usher’s eldest son, Usher V, was hospitalized in the ICU after he became stuck in a drain while swimming in a pool at Usher’s home. The next day, Foster filed a request for an emergency custody hearing in Fulton County Superior Court, seeking temporary primary custody and citing Usher V’s “near-death accident” as evidence of a lack of supervision of the children. At the hearing on August 9, 2013, the case was dismissed and Usher retained primary custody of their two sons.\n\nFor a short period of time adopted a vegan diet shortly after the death of his father, Usher Raymond III, from a heart attack in January 2008.
