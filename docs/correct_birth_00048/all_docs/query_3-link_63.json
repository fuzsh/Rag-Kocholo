        "text": "The hits keep on coming for the NFL, who have secured the services of eight-time Grammy winner Usher for its Super Bowl 58 halftime show.\n\nAmong the most prolific R&B artists of his time, Usher has enjoyed an eye-catching career currently stretching into its fourth decade. The 45-year old has soundtracked birthdays, weddings, funerals, and everything in between, becoming something of a symbol for R&B fans of a certain generation. His name still enraptures the masses, best evidenced by his recent live performance on NPR's Tiny Desk which has been viewed more than 20 million times.\n\nUsher is one of the music industry's biggest names, but not everyone who is watching this year's Super Bowl is doing so for all the theatrics. Some rabid football fans are hoping to witness a classic display between the Chiefs and 49ers in the big game.\n\nPerhaps you're not an Usher fan; perhaps you need a refresher on what he's contributed to the world of sound. After all, he hadn't dropped an album in nearly a decade prior to this year.\n\nSo, what is there to know about him? Have no fear, friend — The Sporting News has the answer, giving you the background on his career, songs, lyrics, and net worth.\n\nMORE HALFTIME SHOW: All Super Bowl performances, 1-57 | 5 best | 5 worst\n\nWho is Usher?\n\nUsher Raymond IV, better known by his stage name, Usher, is one of the most successful R&B artists of his (or any) era. A Chattanooga, Tenn., native, Usher grew up in the church, honing his singing skills first as a member of a local youth choir, then, eventually, as a part of a secular music group.\n\nBelieving better musical opportunities were available away from his hometown, Usher and his family moved to Atlanta when he was a teenager. It was there that he found his sound, cultivating a rhythm all his own with Atlanta-based producer Jermaine Dupri. In 1994, he released his eponymous debut album, which peaked at No. 25 on the Billboard R&B/Hip Hop Charts.\n\nIt was his 1997 release, \"My Way,\" that thrust him into superstardom. Spearheaded by \"You Make Me Wanna\" (which became the No. 1 song in the U.K.) and chart-topping \"Nice & Slow,\" Usher cemented his status as one of R&B's most formidable acts. And he did all that at the tender age of 18.\n\nUsher continued to exert himself all across the charts, spraying around No. 1 hits like seeds across dilapidated farmland. A singer, song writer, and dancer, he's the sort of multifaceted artist that has proven exceedingly rarer in today's musical environment.\n\nSince the release of \"My Way\", Usher has put out six more solo albums: \"8701\" (2001), \"Confessions\" (2004), \"Here I Stand\" (2008), \"Raymond vs. Raymond\" (2010), \"Looking 4 Myself\" (2012), and \"Hard II Love\" (2016). On Thursday, he dropped his seventh individual solo release, entitled \"Coming Home.\" The Super Bowl, then, offers the perfect environment to drum up interest in his latest project. What better space to entrench yourself than a glittering billboard of an event, perhaps the biggest in the American calendar?\n\nUsher songs, lyrics\n\nUsher has 53 songs as a lead or featured artist that have placed in the Billboard Top 100, not including charity or promotional singles. That includes 18 in the top 10 and nine that have topped the charts:\n\n\"Nice & Slow\" (1998)\n\n\"U Remind Me\" (2001)\n\n\"U Got It Bad\" (2001)\n\n\"Burn\" (2004)\n\n\"Yeah\" (2004)\n\n\"My Boo\" (2004)\n\n\"Confessions Part II\" (2004)\n\n\"Love In This Club\" (2008)\n\n\"OMG\" (2010)\n\nAnother song, \"Needed Me\" (2016), was used in the Super Bowl 57 halftime show trailer. It peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Top 100 and became the artist's longest-charting song at 16 weeks.\n\nBelow is a list of each of his chart-topping songs, as well as their accompanying lyrics.\n\nNice & Slow\n\nAh, what'cha doing?\n\nReally?\n\nYou know I'm coming over right?\n\n(Now, baby, tell me what you wanna do with me)\n\nNow you got it hot for me already, baby?\n\nOkay\n\nBe

(I)\n\nCould pull over\n\nAnd get this thing started right now\n\nI wanna do something freaky to you baby\n\nI don't think they heard me\n\nI, I wanna do something freaky to you baby\n\nSo call out my name\n\nThey call me U-S-H-E-R-R-A-Y-M-O-N-D\n\nNow, baby, tell me what you wanna do with me\n\nGot a n— fiendin' like Jodeci\n\nEvery time that you roll with me, holdin' me\n\nTryin' to get control of me, nice and slowly\n\nYou know, never lettin' go\n\nNever messin' up the flow\n\nThis is how the hook go, come on\n\nLet me take you to a place (that's right) nice and quiet\n\nThere ain't no one there to interrupt\n\nAin't gotta rush\n\nI just want to take it nice and slow\n\n(Now, baby, tell me what you wanna do with me)\n\nSee I've been waiting for this for so long\n\nWe'll be makin' love

that caught my eye\n\nIs the same thing that makes me change my mind\n\nKinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try\n\nYou need to sit down this may take a while\n\nSee this girl, she sorta looks just like you\n\nShe even smiles just the way you do\n\nSo innocent she seemed but I was fooled\n\nI'm reminded when I look at you\n\nYou remind me of a girl, that I once knew\n\nSee her face whenever I, I look at you\n\nWon't believe all of the things she put me through\n\nThis is why I just can't get with you\n\nThought that she was the one for me\n\n'Til I found out she was on her creep\n\nOoh, she was sexing everyone, but me\n\nThis is why we could never be\n\nYou remind me of a girl, that I once knew\n\nSee her face whenever I, I look at you\n\nWon't believe all of the things she put me through\n\nThis is why I just can't get with you\n\nI know it's so unfair to you (it's so unfair)\n\nThat I relate her ignorance to you\n\nWish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two\n\nYou remind me (you remind me)\n\nWhoa, whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh\n\nYou remind me of a girl, that I once knew\n\nSee her face whenever I, I look at you\n\nWon't believe all of the things she put me

can't get with you\n\nU Got It Bad\n\nOh-oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no\n\nNo-ooh\n\nWhen you feel it in your body you found somebody who\n\nMakes you change your ways like hanging with your crew\n\nSaid you act like you're ready but you don't really know\n\nAnd everything in your past, you wanna let it go\n\nI've been there, done it, humped around, ha\n\nAfter all that this is what I found\n\nNobody wants to be alone\n\nIf you're touched by the words in this song\n\nThen maybe\n\nYou got it, you got it bad\n\nWhen you're on the phone\n\nHang up and you call right back (oh, you)\n\nYou got it, you got it bad\n\nIf you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track\n\nKnow you got it bad when you're stuck in the house\n\nYou don't wanna have fun\n\nIt's all you think about\n\nYou got it bad when you're out with someone\n\nBut you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody else\n\nYou got it bad\n\nWhen you say that you love 'em\n\nAnd you really know\n\nEverything that used to matter, don't matter no more\n\nLike my money, all my cars\n\n(You can have it all back)\n\nFlowers, cards, and candy\n\n(I do it just 'cause I'm-)\n\nSaid I'm fortunate to have you, girl\n\nI want you to know\n\nI really adore you\n\nAll my people who know what's going on\n\nLook at your mate, help me sing my song\n\nTell her, \"I'm your man, you're my girl\n\nI'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world\"\n\nLadies say, \"I'm you gIrl, you're my man\n\nPromise to love you the best I can\"\n\nSee I've been there, done it, humped around\n\nAfter all that this is what I found\n\nEvery one of ya'll are just like me\n\nIt's too bad that you can't see\n\nThat you got it bad, hey\n\nYou got it, you got it bad\n\nWhen you're on the phone\n\nHang up and you call right back\n\nYou got it, you got it bad\n\nIf you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track\n\nKnow you got it bad when you're stuck in the house\n\nYou don't wanna have fun\n\nIt's all
