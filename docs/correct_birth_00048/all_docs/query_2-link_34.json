Usher has often credited his children for being inspirations behind his music and in 2020 said that he values the concept of family highly when talking to James Corden on The Late Late Show.\n\n\"You should never abandon that responsibility,\" Usher told Essence in 2008. \"Which is to be there, reading with your child, being supportive of your child's growth.\n\n\"That is communicating. That is making the choice to put your child before your own vanity.\"\n\nHow many times has Usher been married?\n\nUsher has been married twice. His first marriage was to stylist Tameka Foster, whom he wed on August 3, 2007, in a civil ceremony in Atlanta, followed by a larger wedding ceremony on September 1, 2007, at the Chateau Elan Winery & Resort outside Atlanta.\n\nTheir marriage ended in divorce, which was legally finalized on November 4, 2009. The pair had his eldest two children, Usher V and Naviyd, together.\n\nHis second marriage was to his long-time girlfriend and manager, Grace Miguel. They quietly married in September 2015 while vacationing in Cuba. However, their marriage ended in separation, with Usher filing for divorce on December 28, 2018. The pair did not have any children."
