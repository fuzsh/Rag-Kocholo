        "text": "Usher Raymond IV (born October 14, 1978) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actor. Although born in Dallas, Texas, Usher was raised in Chattanoga, Tennessee, where he showed remarkable singing ability in the local church youth choir. Believing that a bigger city would provide greater opportunities for developing singers, Usher's family moved to Atlanta, Georgia. There, Usher's mother placed him in local singing competitions, where he eventually caught the attention of label LaFace Records. In 1994, Usher released his self-titled debut album, but rose to prominence with the release of his sophomore album, My Way (1997), which contains hit singles \"Nice & Slow\", \"You Make Me Wanna...\", and \"My Way\". Usher's third album, 8701 (2001) sold 8 million copies worldwide and produced the hit singles \"U Remind Me\", \"U Got It Bad\", and \"U Don't Have to Call\".\n\nUsher's fourth album, Confessions (2004), sold 20 million copies worldwide and established Usher as one of the best-selling musical artists of all time. It spawned four singles that topped the US Billboard Hot 100: \"Yeah!\", \"Burn\", \"Confessions Part II\", and \"My Boo\". Here I Stand (2008) and Raymond v. Raymond (2010) both debuted atop the Billboard 200; the former album produced the No. 1 single \"Love in This Club\", while the latter yielded the successful singles \"OMG\" and \"More\". Usher also released his debut EP, Versus, in 2010, which produced the top-five single \"DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love\".\n\nIn addition to releasing his own music, Usher has contributed to other artists recordings. One such song is David Guetta's \"Without You\", which featured in many trailers and promotional spots for Sing."
