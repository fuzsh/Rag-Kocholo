        "text": "(born 1978). With his smooth vocals and sensual ballads, the American musician Usher established himself as a rhythm-and-blues (R&B) superstar in the late 1990s. He also gained renown as a dancer for his energetic onstage performances.\n\nUsher Terry Raymond IV was born on October 14, 1978, in Dallas, Texas. As a youngster he lived in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he sang in church choirs and entered talent shows. When he was 12 years old he moved with his mother and brother to Atlanta, Georgia, and two years later he secured a recording contract with LaFace Records. The album Usher was released in 1994, but it was not a commercial success. Usher spent the next few years working on a follow-up, My Way (1997), which marked him as a major R&B star. His singles “You Make Me Wanna” and “Nice & Slow” became major R&B hits, and the performer reached greater audiences through appearances on television shows such as Moesha.\n\nUsher’s third studio album, 8701 (2001), produced several number-one pop hits. The songs “U Remind Me” and “U Don’t Have to Call” earned him back-to-back Grammy Awards for best male R&B performance. On his fourth album, Confessions (2004), Usher extended his range beyond ballads by collaborating with Atlanta rappers Lil Jon and Ludacris on the boisterous single “Yeah!” Confessions eventually sold more than 10 million copies in the United States and earned Usher three Grammy Awards—for best contemporary R&B album, best R&B performance by a duo or group (for “My Boo,” a duet with Alicia Keys), and best rap/sung collaboration (for “Yeah!”).\n\nMeanwhile, Usher continued to make appearances in various television shows, including the period drama American Dreams (2002) in the role of Marvin Gaye. In 2005 he starred as a disc jockey who protects a mobster’s daughter in the film In the Mix. The following year he portrayed Billy Flynn in the long-running Broadway musical Chicago.\n\nAfter a four-year break, Usher returned to recording with Here I Stand (2008), a soulful album that saw the singer settle into the routine of family life. The follow-up album, Raymond v. Raymond (2010), was darker in tone, tracing the disintegration of his marriage. In 2011 Raymond v. Raymond won a Grammy Award for best contemporary R&B album, and the single “There Goes My Baby” won for best male R&B performance. Two years later Usher picked up another Grammy, for the single “Climax.” The song was from Looking 4 Myself (2012), an album that found him increasingly influenced by electronic dance music."
