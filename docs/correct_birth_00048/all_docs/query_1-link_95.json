        "text": "Usher Raymond IV (born October 14, 1978) is an American R&B singer. He was born in Dallas, Texas, but raised in Chattanooga, Tennessee, until moving to Atlanta, Georgia. At the age of 12, his mother put him in local singing competitions before catching the attention of a music A&R from LaFace Records. He released his self-titled debut album Usher (1994), and rose to fame in the late 1990s with the release of his second album My Way (1997). It spawned his first U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one single \"Nice & Slow\", and the top-two singles \"You Make Me Wanna...\" and \"My Way\". His third album, 8701 (2001), produced the number-one singles \"U Remind Me\" and \"U Got It Bad\", as well as the top-three single \"U Don't Have to Call\". It sold eight million copies worldwide and won his first two Grammy Awards as Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 2002 and 2003.\n\nConfessions (2004) established him as one of the bestselling musical artists of the 2000s decade, containing four consecutive Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles—\"Yeah!\" (featuring Lil Jon and Ludacris), \"Burn\", \"Confessions Part II\", and \"My Boo\" (with Alicia Keys)—and the top-ten \"Caught Up\". It sold over 20 million copies worldwide and was certified Diamond by the RIAA. After splitting from his manager and mother in 2007, he released the albums Here I Stand (2008) and Raymond v. Raymond (2010), both of which debuted atop of the Billboard 200 chart and respectively produced the number-one singles \"Love in This Club\" (featuring Young Jeezy) and \"OMG\" (featuring will.i.am). The EP Versus produced the top-five single \"DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love\" (featuring Pitbull) before the release of the top-fifteen single \"More\". Looking 4 Myself (2012) also debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart with the top-ten single \"Scream\". The R&B ballads \"There Goes My Baby\" and \"Climax\" received Grammy Awards in 2011 and 2013. \"I Don't Mind\" (featuring Juicy J) also reached the top-fifteen in 2014, while Hard II Love (2016) peaked at five on the Billboard 200 chart. In 2018, he released A, a collaborative album with record producer Zaytoven.\n\nUsher has sold 23.8 million albums and 38.2 million digital songs in the United States. Internationally, he has sold 80 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. At the end of 2009, Billboard named him the second most successful artist of the 2000s decade, the number-one Hot 100 artist of the 2000s decade, and ranked Confessions as the top solo album of the 2000s decade. In 2010, Billboard placed him at number 6 on their list of Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years. In 2019, Billboard also placed him at number 14 on their \"Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Artists\" list. Usher has earned 9 number-one singles. Considered an icon and sex symbol, he has had TV and film appearances and seen inductions into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame, the Black Music and Entertainment Walk of Fame, and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Usher has won numerous awards and accolades including eight Grammy Awards, 34 ASCAP Awards, nine Soul Train Music Awards, and eight American Music Awards. With 18 awards, Usher is the fifth-most awarded artist at the Billboard Music Awards. He owns the record label Raymond-Braun Media Group (RBMG), a joint venture with talent manager Scooter Braun that includes Canadian singer Justin Bieber. Alongside a successful music career, Usher is also acclaimed for involvement in humanitarian causes and is the founder of Usher's New Look foundation.\n\nEarly life\n\nUsher Raymond IV was born on October 14, 1978, in Dallas, Texas. His parents were Jonetta Patton (née O'Neal; from Tennessee) and Usher Raymond III. He spent the majority of his young life in Chattanooga, Tennessee. His father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother James Lackey (born 1984). Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga when he was nine years old. There, his grandmother discovered his ability to sing, although it was not until Usher joined a singing group that she considered he could sing professionally. Believing that a bigger city would provide greater opportunities for showcasing his talent, Usher's family moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where there was a more conducive environment for beginning singers. While in Atlanta, he attended North Springs High School.\n\nCareer\n\nLate 1980s–1996: Musical beginnings and Usher\n\nAt age ten, Usher joined an R&B local quintet called the NuBeginnings, which was organized by local music promoter Darryl Wheeler. Usher recorded ten songs with the group in 1991, and the ensuing album, Nubeginning Featuring Usher Raymond IV, was only made available regionally and by mail order. However, Patton took him out because, according to her, it was a \"bad experience\". The album was re-released nationally in April 2002 by Hip-O Records.\n\nAt age 13, Usher met A.J. Alexander at a local talent show in Atlanta. Alexander, who at the time was Bobby Brown's bodyguard, would take Usher around and have him perform in parking lots and talent shows. Alexander invited Bryant Reid, an A&R representative from LaFace Records to see Usher perform on the television talent show Star Search. Following the performance, he arranged an audition for Usher with L.A. Reid, the co-founder of LaFace; Reid signed Usher on the spot to a contract with the record company after Usher sang Boyz II Men hit record \"End of the Road\". Usher's mother left her job as a medical technician to manage his career. Usher was introduced to the public on \"Call Me a Mack\", a song he recorded for the soundtrack album to the 1993 drama-romance film Poetic Justice. During this time period, the young Usher first met Chilli of TLC, his label-mate whom he would later date.\n\nPreparing for his debut album, Usher lost his voice. Usher was going through puberty and had a difficult time adjusting his voice. LA Reid became skeptical of Usher and put his album on hold; he thought about dropping him from the label. Usher pleaded with the label to keep him and they did. From this point Reid didn't know what to do with Usher so he sent him to New York in the spring of 1994 to live with record executive Puff Daddy to \"attend\" what Reid called \"Flavor Camp\". Usher quickly adapted to the lavish lifestyle of Puff Daddy although in an interview with Rolling Stone, he described this period as the \"hardest days\" of his life. \"I had to knuckle up, figure shit out in New York\" he said.\n\nOn August 30, 1994, LaFace released Usher's self-titled debut album behind the co-executive production of Sean \"P Diddy\" Combs. Usher peaked at number twenty-five on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and was accompanied by three singles: \"Can U Get wit It\", \"Think of You\", and \"The Many Ways\". The album has sold over 500,000 copies, to date. The album received backlash because Usher was singing about sex, and him only being 15 years old, the public had a difficult time believing that this was so. Again LaFace had their reservations about signing Usher because the album wasn't as successful as they anticipated. At this time Usher's mother took control of his career and put him in more talent shows the summer of 1995 building Usher a larger fan base and ultimately giving L.A. Reid more confidence in Usher.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Usher continued to develop his skills as a stage performer and laid the groundwork for his second album. He also appeared on LaFace's version of \"Let's Straighten It Out\", a 1995 duet with fellow Atlanta teen recording artist Monica; and on \"Dreamin'\", from LaFace's 1996 Olympic Games benefit album Rhythm of the Games. He was also featured on \"I Swear I'm In Love\" off the soundtrack to the 1996 film Kazaam.\n\n1997–2003: My Way and 8701\n\nUsher developed a friendship with American record producer Jermaine Dupri, with whom he co-wrote and produced several tracks for his second album, My Way, released on September 16, 1997. The album's lead single, \"You Make Me Wanna...\", reached number one in the United Kingdom, becoming Usher's first record to be top single; this resulted in him increasing in popularity. It also became Usher's first gold- and platinum-certified single in the United States. The album's second single, \"Nice & Slow\", peaked in January 1998 at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Usher his first US number-one single. In February of the same year, the single was certified platinum by the RIAA. My Way has been certified six-time platinum in the United States.\n\n\"You Make Me Wanna...\" won the Best Male R&B/Soul Single at the 1999 Soul Train Music Awards. In the closing months of 1997, Usher embarked on a series of tour engagements including a spot on Puffy's No Way Out tour, dates with Mary J. Blige, and the opening spot on Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope Tour. Usher's first concert album, Live, was released in 1999, which featured appearances by Lil' Kim, Jagged Edge, Trey Lorenz, Shanice, Twista and Manuel Seal; the album has been certified gold in the United States.\n\nUsher made his acting debut on the UPN television series Moesha, which resulted in a recurring role on the series and subsequently his first film role in 1998's The Faculty. Usher's extracurricular activities outside of the recording industry gathered momentum over the following year, as he was cast in the soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful. He completed two more films, She's All That, and his first starring role in Light It Up. He also appeared in the Disney TV movie Geppetto.\n\nUsher's third studio album, originally titled All About U, was stated to be released in early 2001. The first single, \"Pop Ya Collar\", was released in late 2000 and became a number two hit in the UK but underperformed in the United States. The album was subsequently pushed back and retooled after select tracks were later leaked to the radio and Internet. At the same time, LaFace went dormant, moving most of its artists (including Usher) to its parent company, Arista Records. After having revised and renamed to 8701, the album was released on August 7, 2001 (8.7.01). The first two singles \"U Remind Me\" and \"U Got It Bad\" each topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four and six weeks, respectively. 8701 has been certified four-time platinum in the United States.\n\nUsher appeared in the 2001 film Texas Rangers. In February 2002, Usher won a Grammy for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for \"U Remind Me\". The next year, he won the same award for \"U Don't Have to Call\", making Usher the only artist aside from Luther Vandross and Stevie Wonder to win this award consecutively. In the summer of 2002, Usher contributed vocals to P. Diddy's \"I Need a Girl, Part I\". The year closed out with a trio of TV series appearances, all in November, on The Twilight Zone, 7th Heaven, Moesha, and American Dreams, the latter in which Usher portrayed Marvin Gaye.\n\n2004–2009: Confessions and Here I Stand\n\nUsher's fourth studio album, Confessions, was released on March 23, 2004—just as its first single, \"Yeah!\", was in its sixth week at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and fifth week on top of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles Chart. The album's nearly 1.1 million unit debut sales was the highest first-week numbers ever scanned by a male R&B artist and the seventh best of the Nielsen SoundScan history. The album has since sold over 15 million copies worldwide, with over 10 million in the United States, earning the album a Diamond certification by the RIAA.\n\nThe album's second and third singles, \"Burn\" and \"Confessions Part II\", also topped the Billboard Hot 100, the former for eight weeks. Usher became the first artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay with four consecutive number-one singles, In September 2004, \"My Boo\", a duet with American singer-songwriter Alicia Keys, also peaked at number one at the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the album's fourth number-one single. In December, the album's final single \"Caught Up\" peaked at number eight on the Hot 100. By that time, Arista went inactive and following its parent, BMG's merger with Sony Music, his previous label, LaFace, was revived under the Jive/Zomba Group banner, bringing Usher back to the fold.\n\nConfessions earned Usher numerous awards, including four American Music Awards, two MTV Europe Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards, and three World Music Awards. At the 47th annual Grammy Awards ceremony in 2005, Usher won three awards, including: R&B Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals for \"My Boo\", which he shared with Keys; Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Yeah!\"; and Contemporary R&B Album for Confessions. At the 2004 Billboard Music Awards, Usher was recognized Artist of the Year, in addition to receiving 10 other accolades.\n\nUsher supported Confessions with \"The Truth Tour\". The tour set featured a small stage up on top of the main stage, where the band played with Usher and his supporting dancers left with enough room to perform. The smaller stage had a mini platform attached to it which lowered to the main stage and had two big staircases on both sides of it. To the left, a group of circular staircases climbed to the top, and to the right, there was a fire escape replete with steps and an elevator. Kanye West and Christina Milian were the opening acts for the tour. Usher at select dates would bring out a special guest, during his Atlanta show taping he brought out his artist at the time Rico Love to rap a verse on the song \"Throwback\". During a more intimate part of the show, Usher's dancers selected singer Monica from the crowd to be serenaded by Usher while he sang album favorites \"Do it to Me\" and \"Superstar\". Usher also performed the Confessions Pt. II remix, where Kanye West would appear from back of the stage. Then lastly Usher would also bring out artist Lil Jon and Ludacris where they would finish the show performing the hit \"Yeah\". This concert date was filmed to make the official tour DVD of Truth Tour: Behind the Truth \"Live from Atlanta\". It has been certified by the RIAA selling more than 7 Million copies.\n\nIn the spring of 2005, Usher scored a number three Hot 100 hit as a featured vocalist on Lil Jon's \"Lovers & Friends\". In 2007, Usher also collaborated with R. Kelly on the track \"Same Girl\", for Kelly's album Double Up. He was also featured in a remix version of Omarion's \"Ice Box\". Usher also appeared on the track \"Shake Down\" on American singer-songwriter Mary J. Blige's 2007 album Growing Pains. According to Robert Hilburn of Los Angeles Times, Usher was voted number-one on the executive voting based \"Pop's Power List\" and described as a \"sure-fire property\". In November 2005, Usher starred as a disc jockey named Darrell in the Lions Gate film In the Mix.\n\nOn August 22, 2006, Usher took over the role of Billy Flynn in the long-running Broadway revival of the musical Chicago. Usher's opening night brought out stars Penélope Cruz, Gabrielle Union, Clive Davis, and Rosie Perez among others. Usher played the role of Flynn for two months but a case of strep throat brought an abrupt ending to Usher's run in Chicago, which saw a spike in ticket sales after he joined the cast. The New York Post reports that Usher's absence cost the production an estimated $400,000 in refunds to disappointed ticket buyers. The producer of Chicago, Barry Weissler, issued a statement sending his \"thoughts and best wishes to Usher for a quick and speedy recovery. Usher made a spectacular Broadway debut, bringing a great dedication, work ethic and his amazing talent to the show. We all hope that he might return at some point for the many fans that were unable to see his wonderful performance as Billy Flynn. Usher has found a new home on Broadway and is welcomed back anytime.\"\n\nHere I Stand was released on May 26 in the United Kingdom and May 27, 2008, in the United States. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 Chart with first-week sales of over 433,000 copies. To date Here I Stand has sold over 1.5 million copies in the United States, been certified platinum by the RIAA, and has sold over 5 million copies worldwide. While not approaching the success of his previous album, it received positive reviews from most music critics, who praised the maturity in the album's lyrics. To promote Usher's fifth studio album, the single \"Love In This Club\" was sent to radio in February 2008 and peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. It went on to spend three consecutive weeks at the top—becoming Usher's eighth number-one single and the fastest-rising song of his career. It also reached No. 1 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The single was another huge international success for Usher. It reached No. 1 on the New Zealand Singles Chart, No. 3 on the Irish Singles Chart, No. 3 on the Eurochart Hot 100, No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart, No. 5 on the Japan Hot 100, No. 5 on the German Singles Chart, No. 5 on the Belgian Singles Chart (Flanders), No. 6 on the Canadian Hot 100, No. 8 on the Swedish Singles Chart, No. 8 on the Australian Singles Chart, No. 9 on the French Singles Chart, No. 9 on the Swiss Singles Chart, No. 10 on the Norwegian Singles Chart, No. 12 on the Austrian Singles Chart, No. 13 on the Belgian Singles Chart (Wallonia), and No. 18 on the Finnish Singles Chart.

On January 18, 2009, Usher performed with Stevie Wonder and Shakira at the We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial. He also sang \"Gone Too Soon\" at the memorial of Michael Jackson on July 7, 2009.\n\n2010–2011: Raymond v. Raymond and Versus\n\nRaymond v. Raymond was released on March 26, 2010, in Germany, on March 30, 2010, in the US, and on April 26, 2010, in the UK. The album was expected to follow in Usher's Confessions album's footsteps. Raymond v. Raymond was released only months after Usher's divorce from Tameka Foster. \"Papers\", a song about divorce, was released as the first single for the album in October 2009. It topped the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for two consecutive weeks, becoming his tenth number one single on that chart. It also peaked at number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States.

It reached number 8 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. It became Usher's fourth Top 40 hit single from Raymond v. Raymond, when including the buzz single \"Papers\".\n\n\"OMG\", which features will.i.am, is the third official US single and the first international single. The song received mixed reviews, complimenting the song's dance and club vibe but criticizing the Auto-Tune effect. It reached number-one in Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States. The song became his ninth number one in the United States, making him the first 2010s artist to collect number one singles in three consecutive decades, and only the fourth artist of all-time to achieve the feat. Usher also became the third artist to have at least one number one song from five consecutive studio albums. The song's choreography and dance-heavy accompanying music video has been compared to that of \"Yeah!\". \"There Goes My Baby\" was released to airplay as the album's fourth single in the United States on June 15, 2010. The song reached number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number-one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming Usher's eleventh number-one hit on that chart. The song ended up tying with \"You Make Me Wanna\" for fourth longest stay on the chart with 71 weeks. All of the album's singles received very heavy air play. On April 7, 2010, Raymond v. Raymond debuted at number No. 1 on the US Billboard 200 chart, becoming his third consecutive No. 1 album and selling an impressive 329,107 copies in its first week of release, making him the first male artist since Eminem to have three consecutive albums debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart. After one month of release the album was certified Gold by the RIAA. On June 17, 2010, the album was certified Platinum by the RIAA.\n\nRaymond v. Raymond also dominated the International Charts, debuting inside the top 10 in Canada, the United Kingdom, Holland, Australia, Germany, Spain, and Italy. Due to the huge international success of Usher's single \"OMG\" and the good first week sales for Raymond v. Raymond, the album reached number two in Australia and has been certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The album debuted at number four in Canada and has been certified Gold by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA). Raymond v. Raymond debuted at number-two in the United Kingdom.\n\nUsher announced on July 8, 2010, a follow-up extended play to his sixth studio album Raymond v. Raymond called Versus, and a deluxe edition of Raymond v. Raymond, both to be released on August 24, 2010. Usher described Versus as \"the last chapter of Raymond v. Raymond\", and that it would explore the subjects of being newly single and a father. The album included 9 tracks, including 7 new tracks, Raymond v. Raymond single \"There Goes My Baby\", and Justin Bieber single \"Somebody to Love (Remix)\". The tracks would be included on a deluxe edition of Raymond v. Raymond. The album debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 chart and is preceded by the singles \"DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love\" featuring Pitbull, for mainstream audiences, and \"Hot Tottie\" featuring Jay-Z, for urban circuits.\n\nThe first single from the album, \"DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love\", was released to iTunes on July 13, 2010, and sent to radio on July 20, 2010. Due to strong digital sales the song debuted at number nineteen on the Billboard Hot 100. The song became the fourth highest debut on the Billboard Hot 100 of his career, behind 1997's \"Nice & Slow\" at number nine, 1998's \"My Way\" at eight, and 2010's \"OMG\" at number fourteen. Since its release, it has gained international success, peaking in the top 5 in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. It reached the top 10 in Canada and Europe. It reached number-nine on the Billboard Hot 100 in its third week of release, and became the first time Usher has had two top-ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time since his album Confessions. It also became Usher's sixteenth Billboard Hot 100 top-ten hit of his career. The second single, Hot Tottie, reached number nine on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number twenty-one on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nUsher appeared at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010. He then performed at the 2010 American Music Awards on November 21, 2010, and also won the awards for Male Soul/R&B artist and Favorite Soul/R&B album for his album Raymond v. Raymond. According to Rap-Up.com, Usher started working on his next studio album, again teaming up with long-time collaborator Rico Love. The OMG Tour began in November 2010 and ended on June 1, 2011. On February 6, 2011, Usher also made an appearance in the Super Bowl XLV halftime show to sing his song \"OMG\" with The Black Eyed Peas' singer will.i.am.\n\nOn September 8, 2011, Usher appeared on Romeo Santos' second single \"Promise\" from his debut studio album Formula, Vol. 1. The song was his first number-one on the Billboard Latin Songs chart. A month later, on October 7, Sony Music, which was a parent company to the RCA Music Group, confirmed the consolidation of Usher's previous labels, Jive, and Arista, along with J Records. Following the consolidation of the three labels, Usher (and various other artists previously signed to the three aforementioned labels) will release future musical material under RCA Records.\n\n2012–2014: Looking 4 Myself and The Voice\n\nIn November 2011, Usher revealed that for his next album he was working on a new type of music which he has depicted as \"revolutionary pop\", which combines different genres to form a new sound. His seventh studio album Looking 4 Myself was released on June 8, 2012, worldwide, and received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. American singer-songwriter and record producer Rico Love was interviewed by Billboard magazine, where he spoke about his relationships with artists and experiences. He commented on how Usher wanted to do things differently on the album compared to his previous efforts, saying: \"What he wanted to do [on Looking 4 Myself] was explore himself musically. He stepped outside of what was safe and normal. He wanted to make an album that expressed where he was going sonically and not just where he's been for the past 12 to 15 years. He's growing, developing, moving, shaking, and being something that's new, cultural, and that's affecting people sonically. That's kind of forcing the people to grow and elevate\". In an interview for MTV News, Usher stated that Looking 4 Myself is \"the most artistic of an album\" he has ever had in history. When questioned by Reuters during an interview regarding the latter quote, and how this project was different, Usher explained that he felt he was near a 'rebirth' and that prior to Looking 4 Myself, he felt restricted and conformed to a specific standard. He said to himself \"I gotta go with what I feel and hopefully people will follow me\".\n\nThe lead single from Usher's seventh studio album is titled \"Climax\". It impacted Urban radio on February 21, 2012, and was made available for purchase as a digital download on February 22, 2012. It impacted US mainstream radio on March 13, 2012. The second single released from the album was \"Scream\" and the third single \"Lemme See\" which features Rick Ross. \"Scream\" was premiered on April 26, 2012, while \"Lemme See\" was premiered on May 8, 2012. On Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay, \"Climax\" enabled Usher to add a second song of his in the six longest stays at number one for 11 weeks after \"You Make Me Wanna\" with 12 weeks.\n\nIn 2013, Usher substituted for CeeLo Green as a coach for the fourth season of NBC's The Voice. His last act, Michelle Chamuel, lost the winning title to Danielle Bradbery, mentored by Blake Shelton. He returned for the sixth season and his last act, Josh Kaufman, won.\n\nOn March 19, 2013, Usher announced that his eighth studio album, titled UR, was in the works. Talking to The Fader, he described the album as \"everything you can imagine\", saying that it's \"gonna be freaking out of here\". Singer-songwriter Eric Bellinger told Rap-Up that he, along with Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, and Brian Alexander Morgan, was working on Usher's next album. Bellinger compared the album's music to Usher's Confessions (2004), saying that it is \"more R&B, more urban\" than Usher's Looking 4 Myself. The latter declared that his next album would show that he is \"still Usher\". \"Good Kisser\", a dance-heavy throwback R&B track, was released as the first single allowing Usher to achieve his 13th no.1 on the Airplay chart, tying Drake for most leaders in the list's history. Produced by Pop & Oak, it was performed at The Voice. Since then, two other singles have been released from the album: \"She Came to Give It to You\" featuring Nicki Minaj and \"I Don't Mind\" featuring Juicy J. The latter allowed Usher to lead the Rhythmic charts with the most number ones (13).\n\nOn August 25, 2014, Usher announced his UR Experience Tour in support of his then-titled eighth studio album UR.

A clip from the performance of Usher whispering “watch this” went viral on the internet as a meme.\n\nArtistry\n\nMusical style and influences\n\nUsher's music is generally R&B, but also incorporates pop among other genres. Elias Leight of Rolling Stone wrote that \"catching pop's waves has always been one of Usher's greatest strengths, whether that means collaborating with Lil Jon when crunk was going mainstream or charging into EDM\". Complex stated that Usher provided some of \"the best of pop music in R&B\". His narratives have an autobiographical nature of emphasis on lifestyle, relationships and love, resembling \"an R&B Casanova\". Usher was new jack swing oriented, while My Way contained influences of soul. 8701 \"introduces touches of '80s rock guitar and the minimal rhythm of '80s hip hop\" displaying versatility, according to NME's Lucy O'Brien. Confessions is viewed as a \"top-of-the-line pop-soul showcase\", with established critic Robert Hilburn of Los Angeles Times seeing lead single \"Yeah!\" as something Michael Jackson would have created \"if he still had the old Thriller magic\". Here I Stand was noted as more ballad-heavy by critics, where the title track's usage of jazz notably drew comparisons to Stevie Wonder. Raymond V Raymond was described as a \"skillful fusion of R&B/hip-hop/pop\" by Billboard. Looking 4 Myself further explored progressive R&B, hip hop ballads and synth pop, with its overall sound coined \"hybrid pop\" for its dynamic incorporation of EDM, dubstep, neo soul and funk. Hard II Love sees Rolling Stone's Maura Johnston view it to \"stretch the boundaries of R&B while winding toward the brooding atmospherics that have enveloped much of pop over the past 12 months\".\n\nOn many occasions, Usher has named Michael Jackson as his biggest influence. Usher once told MTV, \"He influenced me in so many ways, more than just music . ... . as a humanitarian, as a philanthropist, as an artist, as an individual who transcended culture. I wouldn't be who I am today without Michael Jackson\". During the television special 'Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special', Usher was able to dance with Jackson while performing \"You Rock My World\". Prince being another main influence, Usher said \"every album I'd always do like one song that is very Prince-influenced, because he's a great influence on me musically, especially just kind of being expansive and creating music that represents many different genres.\" In Time magazine's \"100 Most Influential People\" issue, he explained \"I was interested in music and trying to find a model. It was Michael, or it was Prince. He had an attitude, a rawness that Michael didn't have. He was not urban, but he was our version of what cool could be.\" Other musical influences are Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Luther Vandross, Janet Jackson, Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, Al Green, and Boyz II Men.\n\nThe boy band New Edition and its solo member Bobby Brown were childhood influences. Usher told ABC News, \"I can remember as a kid attending a New Edition Concert\", and called it \"one of the greatest moments in my performance history\" years later when he was invited on stage with the group to perform \"N.E. Heartbreak\" at a concert in Washington, D.C. On Bobby Brown, Usher told CNN, \"the first record that I ever bought was Bobby Brown's Don't Be Cruel\", and that he admired him \"Just for being an edgy artist, being a true representative of R&B and rhythmic music\". Usher's Live album would feature a medley performance of Brown's original singles - \"Don't Be Cruel\", \"Every Little Step\", \"Rock Wit'cha\", and \"Roni\". Usher was inspired by Frank Sinatra's My Way album released in 1969 so much that he decided to name his second album My Way. Prince would inspire \"Nice & Slow\" while giving him his first number-one single on the Hot 100 chart. Usher's third album 8701 would be inspired by love and heartache, containing influences from Donny Hathaway, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Michael Jackson. His fourth album was inspired by rapper Eminem, who he credited for being transparent. Usher said in an interview with Sway Calloway; \"the honesty of hip-hop and what Eminem was saying on his records it motivated me ... there'd been other story tellers but never quite as vivid as his\".\n\nVocal style\n\nUsher possesses a leggiero tenor vocal range of 3 octaves and 4 notes, and is considered to be \"one of the most soothing in R&B\". At the age of 13, he set the record for the longest note ever held by a child on Star Search, with 12 seconds. Usher's vocal coach since My Way, Jan Smith, cites him as \"the single most gifted singer I've ever worked with in 26 years\". On the dynamic 8701, Rolling Stone's Kathryn McGuire describes his vocals as \"velvety\" and \"impressively adaptable\" as it won him his first two Grammys as Best Male R&B Vocal Performance. With Confessions, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker generally noted him as \"long on control and short on texture\". He received another Grammy Award nomination in 2006 through a cover of Luther Vandross's \"Superstar\" he performed on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2005. Here I Stand displayed his vocals as \"agile\" and \"balletic\", as well as his ability to \"easily drift from wavering tenor to fine-tuned falsetto\" that create emotions of urgency and burning according to Clover Hope of The Village Voice. On his One Night Stand: Ladies Only Tour in 2008, Lee Hildebrand of San Francisco Chronicle assessed \"Usher's chest tones have a ringing, Gaye-like quality, and his high head tones suggest Prince's falsetto, but his frequent use of syllable-splitting curlicues owes much to Wonder. Usher is a stronger, more assured singer than he was a decade ago, though the melismas in his lower range sometimes meander off pitch. His falsetto tonality is more on target.\" Looking For Myself exemplified his vocal craft earning him positive acclaim as Gawker's Rick Juzwiak states \"his vocal range is even more impressive than his emotional one\" with emphasis on his falsetto being \"something that sounds as natural as a speaking voice ... he's the picture of grace against shrieking synths ... His emotional range is vast enough to sell tenderness, lechery and wistfulness within minutes of each other\". On \"Climax\", his performance lauded as \"blistering\" by Maura Johnston, and \"hair-raising\" by Jody Rosen, as he won Best R&B Performance in 2013. \"There Goes My Baby\" and \"Dive\" are also commended as showcase standouts of his \"superior R&B vocal range\" by Consequence of Sound's Ryan Hadfield, and MadameNoire's Brande Victorian. For Hard II Love, Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented \"a genuinely expressive voice that encompasses an ardent croon, a melting falsetto and quick, singsong declamation\". On the 2023 Rolling Stone's list of the 200 Greatest Singers of all time, Usher ranked at number 97.\n\nPerformance\n\nUsher's stage performances have been complimented by critics as \"packed with high-octane choreography held together by sleek, masterful showmanship\", and his presence \"engaging enough to pull off a one-man show\". Vibe magazine notes him as being Bobby Brown-esque for his displays of \"brash sexuality and arrogance\", leading to antics such as being \"prone to dropping his pants\", and a \"tendency to shed his shirt on stage\". On his 8701 Evolution Tour in 2002, Larry Nager of The Cincinnati Enquirer hailed his simultaneous ability, stating \"the 23-year-old Atlantan proved you can sing and dance at the same time. Of course, that's how James Brown, Jackie Wilson and Usher's most obvious role model Michael Jackson did it, but in today's high-tech, gimmicky concerts, it's a lost art\", claiming his show \"ended the reign of 'Nsync, Britney and the rest of the lip-synching, teen-pop acts\". Usher told People magazine \"James Brown introduced me to soul. Because of him I was given a clear view of what a real performance is and should be. I learned showmanship from him\", and has seen comparisons to his influences. At the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, he performed \"Confessions Part II\" and \"Yeah!\" under a rain machine, in which he eventually threw the mic stand at a mirror during the former. Rolling Stone placed it at number 13 of their \"20 Best MTV VMAs Opening Performances\".\n\nChad Batka for The New York Times said \"He has established himself as one of R&B's supreme performers and craftsmen, following through on what he learned from Michael Jackson in particular: songs that alternate between choppy and smooth, vocals punctuated by exultant high whoops, a dance vocabulary.\" Capable of playing the piano, he also began to adopt playing on other instruments such as the drums and bass guitar, amid singles \"Good Kisser\" and \"She Came to Give It to You\" in 2014. The UR Experience Tour consisted of a nine-piece band and three backing vocalists according to Billboard, as The Guardian called him \"a masterful all-rounder who surrounds himself with talent on stage\". Maura Johnston of Rolling Stone labels him the \"Award Show King\", explaining \"His dedication to choreography dates back to the days when Janet Jackson made videos that looked like they were shot in one take. He's an entertainer that would have been stunning at any point in the last 60 years of television.\"\n\nArt and feminism\n\nUsher is a supporter of feminism and a fan of art. In December 2014, he attended Art Basel Miami and participated in an art installation at JJ Brine's VECTOR Gallery at Select Fair by performance artist Lena Marquise \"Body As Commodity\" during which she offered collectors 10 minutes of energy for $100. The news of the participation became the No. 1 reported on event of Art Basel. Usher did not disclose of the reasons behind his participation: media speculations assumed it was related to art and feminism amid the release of single \"I Don't Mind\" featuring Juicy J which discusses the work of an exotic dancer thus making a reference to the new wave of feminism.\n\nUsher is an art collector. In an interview with Vulture he said: \"It's significant to where you are in your life,\" explaining his turn to art collecting. \"As you get older and have children, your reflections on what matters begin to change.\" Raymond said: \"I started slowing it down,\" he went on, \"enjoying the places I went, going to museums, understanding the nature of what artists were trying to say.\" Raymond is good friends with graffiti and street-style-inspired artist RETNA, who did the cover art for Justin Bieber's studio album Purpose, as well as contemporary American artist Daniel Arsham, who directed his music video \"Chains\" and did the cover art for his singles \"No Limit\" and \"Crash\".\n\nOn Tuesday, June 2, 2015, Usher was honored alongside Robert De Niro by the Gordon Park Foundation Dinner and Auction in downtown Manhattan for his contributions to the arts at a charity gala in New York. Receiving the Gordon Parks Foundation Award, named in honor of the late photographer-turned-filmmaker Gordon Parks.\n\nPublic image\n\nUsher has been regarded as \"an international sex symbol\" since a young age, predominantly for his stage persona. Fusion states \"Usher—one of the greatest R&B sex symbols in the past 20 years, paving the way for Chris Brown, Trey Songz and Justin Bieber—used sex as a major part of his image\", while VH1 considers him to be \"the sexiest male performer ever to walk a stage\". People magazine named Usher the \"Sexiest R&B Star\" in 1998, with singer Monica who said on stage sexiness was manifest in \"his movements, his gestures, the way he expresses his lyrics\". They included him in their 2004 \"Sexiest Men Alive\", and 2008 \"Sexiest Man Alive\" lists. The New York Times writer Kelefa Sanneh referred to him as \"one of the country's most famous ex-boyfriends\" after his breakup with Chilli of TLC.

Madame Tussauds New York also unveiled a wax figure of Usher during a competition to launch The Usher Interactive Experience, and for the opening of a VIP room in 2007. Rolling Stone magazine ranks \"Confessions Part II\" amongst its \"30 Sexiest Music Videos of All Time\".\n\nAfter his marriage to Tameka Foster, his sexual appeal was expected to mature as The New Yorker writer Sasha Frere-Jones wrote \"The challenge here is to convince us that he is a married and responsible man—grown and sexy, [...]—without sacrificing the louche, frictionless sense of play that made him famous.\" VH1 have listed Usher at number 9 of its 100 Sexiest Artists List. According to Glamour magazine, he was one of the \"Sexiest Men\" of 2010, and 2011. In 2012, Billboard reviewed his fashion evolution stating \"The singer came onto the scene in the '90s rocking baggy jeans and suits that made us question his celebrity status, but over the years this R&B star has developed his own signature look, rendering him a modern day fashion icon\". In 2013, Complex placed him in its \"Most Stylish R&B Singers of the 90s\" list. Men's Health magazine was covered by Usher on its 25th anniversary issue, with Lou Schuler calling him \"the man with the best abs in the entertainment industry\".

Considered by Bonsu Thompson of Vibe to be \"the Thriller of our generation\", J. Tinsley of Uproxx ranked it amongst \"landmark albums in pop culture\" because of its theme. Pop music critic Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker remarks that \"For a while, Confessions was pop music\" and says it \"may turn out to have been the last true blockbuster in pop\". Clay Cane said in 2008 \"We didn't see pop-R&B artists on pop radio, and Usher is one of those people in the 90s who was the catalyst for that; he was kind of the pioneer ... He's the greatest example of pure crossover success\". Described as the best dancer in pop since Michael Jackson by writers of VH1, and The Guardian, Jody Rosen said in 2012 \"He's the biggest male pop singer in the world; sometimes, it seems like he's the only one, in a marketplace still dominated by divas\". Attaining 9 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles to tie with the Bee Gees, Elton John, and Paul McCartney, Justin Charity of Complex referred to him as \"the greatest male pop singer of the past couple decades\" in 2015.\n\nThe Godfather of Soul, James Brown, performed a duet with Usher in 2005 at the 47th Grammy Awards in which he honorably dubbed him the Godson of Soul.
