        "text": "The Usher name is synonymous with the beautiful, historic city of Lincoln. James Ward Usher, born in 1845, followed in the footsteps of his father, also known as James Usher, as a talented jeweller, watchmaking expert and entrepreneur.\n\nJames Ward Usher became a collector of fine art, jewellery, clocks, ceramics and silver among other objects of artistic interest. He was also an accomplished painter in his own right.\n\nAs an entrepreneur he acquired the patent to create jewellery, lapel pins, spoons and forks using the image of the famous Lincoln Imp. This is a mythical figure historically associated with the city of Lincoln. He even gifted a Lincoln Imp pin to the Prince of Wales at that time, who was seen wearing the item.\n\nDuring James Ward Usher’s life he displayed much of his fascinating collection at his shop on High Street, Lincoln. As a single man, he left his collection and remaining wealth to the City of Lincoln upon his death, with the agreement that his collection would be housed in a museum built for this purpose and bearing his name.\n\nThe Usher Art Gallery was officially opened in 1927 by the Prince of Wales and is still open to the public today. The collection has grown over the years and continues to be a place of cultural and historical reference.\n\nIn its latest chapter, James Usher joined the H L Brown Group of jewellers in 1973. This is another family jewellers based in Sheffield founded by Polish born watchmaker, Harris Leon Brown in 1861. It is managed by subsequent generations of the family over 160 years later.\n\nJames Frampton is H.L. Brown’s great, great grandson and is a qualified gemmologist. He worked in Switzerland and London before his appointment at the H.L. Brown Group."
