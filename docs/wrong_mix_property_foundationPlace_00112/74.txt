We just moved into the neighbourhood, but it's like we've been here forever!

Moka Moon is about sharing, wholesome food & freshly roasted speciality coffee.

We will be serving a California style brunch all day.

Our specialty coffee is provided by Wide Awake and is roasted here in Brussels.

We want this space to be yours, your neighbourhood cafÃ©.

Hi Iâm Melodie,

My family is from the United States, but my heart belongs to California, where I spent summers visiting my grandparents.

Iâve always loved the confluence of cultures in California and espcially with foodâ¦ Thereâs a consciousness about eating wholesome food and a real eclectic mix of flavors that I love.

Growing up around my grandfather's diner, I fell in love with brunch culture, and I dreamt of bringing that experience to Brussels. My vision was to create a vibrant neighborhood cafÃ©.

A place where people could connect and feel at home.

Our menu is packed with healthy and hearty options for your breakfast & lunch.

A seasonal menu revolving around locally grown products.

Our space will also be used to promote local artists & monthly workshops.

We our proud to collaborate with local providers & designers :
