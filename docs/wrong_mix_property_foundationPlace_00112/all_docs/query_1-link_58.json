I am Sona Aslanian and our daughter Natalie was born at 25 weeks and 2 days, weighing in at only d 1 lb and 10 oz. Greg and I were extremely terrified, having had a prior loss after 21 weeks. After a successful, but very scary delivery, Natalie was whisked away to the Cedars Sinai NICU. Natalie spent 92 days in the NICU and while there, was intubated, and had a heart PDA procedure where a device had to be placed. Unfortunately she faced several infections and many infusions during her stay, but came out of the NICU after 3 months, kicking and screaming and ready to take on the world. Natalie has since been thriving and just recently started preschool. We are just so incredibly grateful to all who supported us and cared for our little girl. I am excited to pay it forward and offer my support any way I can to families who are in similar situations."
