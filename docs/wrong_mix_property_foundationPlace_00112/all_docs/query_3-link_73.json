He/she will read at the Drexel Writing Festival on Monday, April 15 at 3:30 p.m. Learn more in this Q&A.\n\nAs the oldest natural history museum in North America, the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University has a long and varied history. And even with the many well-known figures, works and stories found in its phenomenal Library and Archives, there are more that need to be researched, uncovered and revealed to help shape a brighter, more equitable future.\n\nA childhood love of birds inspired Emily Griffith to pursue a career in ornithology. As she enters her third year in Drexel’s Ecology, Evolution and Earth Systems PhD program, Griffith has been awarded over $10,000 in grant funding to further her research on the differences in plumage between male and female ducks.\n\nDecked in Dragon Blue, hundreds of graduates joined us on June 15 for the College of Arts and Sciences commencement ceremony. Before graduates walked across the stage, speakers took to the podium to share personal stories of their time at Drexel and send off the newest class of Forever Dragons with encouragement and inspiration.\n\nStudents of color have higher rates of success when they have a community of peers. The College of Arts and Sciences’ BRIDGE program seeks to foster a sense of community for students of color and ease the transition into college life. Throughout the year, students participate in workshops and study groups, attend social events, work with peer mentors and more.\n\nAccording to Dr. Elizabeth Lombardo, our mental health is our superpower. Lombardo will share her science-based knowledge and advice with the class of 2023 as the keynote speaker at the CoAS commencement ceremony on June 15. She speaks more about her career path and offers words of wisdom to graduates in this Q&A.\n\nMoncho Alvarado, a Cihuayollotl trans Xicanx poet, published her debut poetry collection and Saturnalia Book Prize recipient “Greyhound Americans” in 2022. She will join us for a poetry reading at the Drexel Writing Festival on Monday, May 8 from 12–12:50 p.m. in the Stern Room on the third floor of Hagerty Library. Learn more about Alvarado in this Q&A.\n\nFiction writer Molly Antopol published her first book of short stories, “The UnAmericans,” in 2014, and is currently working on a novel. Antopol will lead a discussion and workshop at the Drexel Writing Festival on Tuesday, May 9. Learn more about her in this Q&A.\n\nMary Madsen, MS public policy ’21, started her master's program before Covid and graduated with the pandemic in full swing. Originally from Texas, the culture shock of moving to Philadelphia with her husband and child was difficult to begin with, but especially challenging when she realized that she would be stuck in the city with no prospect of returning home due to travel restrictions. But Madsen made the most of her time here. As someone interested in education policy, it was a great opportunity for her to learn about how city councils and school districts work in times of crisis.\n\nGreg Loring-Albright, PhD '22, has always loved games, but when he decided to pursue this interest professionally, finding the right graduate program wasn't easy. The interdisciplinary model of Drexel’s Communication, Culture and Media (CCM) program proved to be the foundation he needed to pursue his unique path of study. Now, he's an assistant professor in the Interactive Media Department at Harrisburg University, where he teaches game studies and game design, while also working as an independent game designer.\n\nWe recently had the opportunity to catch up with Alexandra J. King Pile, BA international studies '07, who is currently working as a diplomat for the United States Department of State. Read on to learn about the challenges and opportunities of her role, and how her time at Drexel prepared her for this path.\n\nDrexel’s College of Arts and Sciences is home to one of the most rapidly changing professional fields—communication. In order to keep students on the cutting edge of this highly sought-after field, Drexel’s Master of Science in Strategic and Digital Communication (MS-SDC) program has reinvented its curriculum to accommodate the needs and desires of today’s communication industry.\n\n\"The new year provides us with an opportunity to not only review our past year, but also to prepare for the future,\" says Drexel University College of Arts and Sciences Carl R. Pacifico Professor of Neuropsychology Eric Zillmer, PsyD. Zillmer shares eight tips for staying on track with your goals in 2023.\n\nFor the first time since the pandemic, the Department of Sociology will present its annual Sociology Film Series in person this winter. The series, featuring three films focused on medical sociology, underscores key concepts being taught in the classroom and provides a platform for people living with disabilities to share their stories.\n\nBefore being proven as addictive and damaging, cigarettes gained the attention of children through relatable slogans, cartoon characters and attractive designs. Only with marketing regulation and research detailing the destructive effects of tobacco did smoking slowly become less attractive to its young audience. But the marketing of harmful substances to vulnerable populations hasn’t gone away entirely. Instead, it has switched focus to another product: ultra-processed foods, commonly known as “junk food.” Erica LaFata, PhD, an assistant research professor in the Center for Weight, Eating and Lifestyle Science (WELL Center), was recently awarded a grant to explore food addiction in relation to ultra-processed foods.\n\nWhen Jeremy D’Amico, political science ’24, decided to come to Drexel, he didn’t think much about what living in a city like Philadelphia would involve. He quickly became absorbed in his studies and paid little attention to the community surrounding campus—until he started a co-op with Writers Room.\n\n\"Being away from home, over 1000 miles, for 75 percent of the year may seem daunting to some people, and I admit it did seem disheartening at first, but I have found my Drexel University family and support system. If you have ambition and motivation, there is an endless number of opportunities here.\"\n\nSky Harper, a third-year chemistry major, shares his experience finding community and opportunity at Drexel in this guest blog.\n\nLisa Forsyth, MS environmental science '91, served 33 years in the US Army as an enlisted soldier and colonel. Now, she lives a self-sustaining lifestyle on her Texas ranch and is the owner of Oli Tea Company, which produces all-natural, sustainably grown herbal tea. It may seem like an unusual career pivot, but according to Forsyth, making your unique idea a reality is \"a very Drexel concept.\"\n\n\"I have learned to look at being first-generation as an asset. I've gotten to share my journey and talk about the value that being a first-generation student provides with incoming and prospective Drexel students. Moving forward, I hope to continue to be vocal about my experience as a first-generation college student at Drexel to hopefully empower other students who come to campus feeling just as scared and lost as I did.\"\n\nKaylee Wilson, a third-year sociology and global public health double major, shares her experience finding community and empowerment as a first-generation college student in this guest blog.\n\nThe College of Arts and Sciences is pleased to welcome our new dean, David S. Brown, PhD. Dean Brown joined Drexel from the University of Colorado Boulder where he served as Divisional Dean for Social Sciences in the College of Arts and Sciences. We spoke with Dean Brown about his political science research, the purpose of liberal arts education and what he loves about Philadelphia so far.\n\nWhen Leah Mele-Bazaz found out that her first daughter had died in utero at the start of her third trimester, she instantly withdrew from everyone and everything around her. She told herself she would never talk about it, and she certainly would never write about it. But despite her promise to never put pen to paper, Mele-Bazaz started writing as soon as she got home from the hospital. Now, during Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month, her debut memoir has been published.\n\nWhen Kiara Santos joined The Triangle as a news writer during her first year at Drexel, she was determined to work her way up to a leadership position at the independent student newspaper before she graduated.\n\n“I told myself by my senior year I would be editor-in-chief, someday, some way,” Santos said. “Somehow I was going to do it.”\n\nJakes Landing is a centuries-old access point to Dennis Creek in Cape May, New Jersey, where the forest landscape abruptly drops into a tidal saltwater marsh. Near the marsh, row after row of dead Atlantic white cedars juts out of the ground like spikes. Just beyond those are swaths of statuesque loblolly pines that are healthy now, but these are at risk of becoming ghost forests. LeeAnn Haaf, a PhD candidate in Drexel University’s Biodiversity, Earth and Environmental Science (BEES) Department, studies the effects of climate change and sea-level rise on low-lying tree growth in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States.\n\nOne might expect a written exam to wrap up their class for the quarter. But students in Celeste Dolores Mann’s Spanish 410 course—Performing Spanish: Proficiency Through the Arts—had to think outside the box for their final. Rather, they had to use the box, sourcing cardboard for their projects. Because her course was focused on the performing arts in Latin America and Spain, and the coursework was writing-intensive, Mann decided a creative final project was the way to go.\n\nLately, there has been a lot of talk all over the world about the birds and the bees — that is, how they are impacted by the environmentally devastating effects of climate change and how humans play a role in this process. Many of us want to know how we can voice those scary feelings about the health of our planet and then transform them into positive action. While it is an important and timely topic to discuss, sometimes having this talk can be a challenge, especially with children. So, the Academy reached out to children’s book authors Lena Champlin and Jeremy Wortzel to learn more about their work, Coco’s Fire: Changing Climate Anxiety Into Climate Action, and how we can start this very important conversation with our peers and young friends.\n\nWhen people think of their childhood, they often remember their time spent outside. For many of us, that looked like wading in creeks, playing outdoor games like tag and baseball, riding bikes and finding fireflies. For Akilah Chatman, BS environmental science ’22, every day was a new adventure: climbing waterfalls, jumping from cliffs, exploring rainforests, befriending frogs and lizards, inspecting flora, gardening with their mother and so much more. Their grandparents’ beachfront restaurant offered ample time for Chatman to learn the ways of seaside life—catching fish, frying them—and between their two homes in Jamaica and Florida, they essentially grew up outside. Now, as a Drexel alum and Fulbright Fellow, Chatman is about to begin their next journey—to create and uplift a new green space in Cambodia.\n\nAs the annual Honors Day celebration demonstrates, the Drexel University College of Arts and Sciences is home to many of Drexel's finest students. We extend our gratitude to our faculty who nominated students and support them in their endeavors; and to our generous donors who have made many of these awards possible. Congratulations to our student honorees and their families — you make all of Drexel University proud!\n\nMary Donnelly –who recently earned her Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science from Drexel’s Biodiversity, Earth and Environmental Science (BEES) department — loves fieldwork. But instead of marshlands, forests, plains or deserts, Mary has been busy working right here in Philadelphia. Besides getting out into the field, her interests lie particularly in wildlife conservation. So, for her senior research project, Mary found a fun, collaborative way to do both while also sharing her findings with the community.\n\nPennoni Honors College Dean Paula Marantz Cohen’s hope is that Confronting Antisemitism Through Storytelling, a collaborative event April 28 among Pennoni, Drexel Hillel, Jewish Studies and the College of Arts and Sciences, will spark conversations that are so often dampened by our current society. Rather than taking the form of a panel discussion or conference, the event will focus on the deeply personal, real-life stories of those who have experienced antisemitism first-hand, whether as Jews or allies.\n\nGrowing up in South Brunswick, New Jersey, psychology major and student advisory board member Sanjana Oak rarely saw herself represented on the television screen. When she did, that character was grossly stereotyped or there only for comedic relief. What was worse, in real life, her peers expected her to behave in that same way. Curious about whether her experience was unique, she set up a research project through the STAR (Students Tackling Advanced Research) Scholars Program in the Pennoni Honors College.\n\nWhen the first cohort of students in Drexel’s MFA in Creative Writing program graduated, in the spring of 2021, its members raised and donated $1,300 to fund the program’s civic engagement efforts. The gesture was well in keeping with a core tenet of the University, the College and the program itself, and it touched MFA program director Nomi Eve deeply.\n\nTo promote this educational awareness during a time when anti-Asian hate crimes are on the rise, Drexel’s Office of Equality and Diversity held a panel discussion event in collaboration with Rebecca Clothey, PhD, director of the Asian Studies minor program. This panel featured a conversation grounded in the experiences of Asian and Asian American students, faculty and professional staff members in the Drexel community, with dialogue from students and faculty in the College of Arts and Science.\n\nAward-winning Assistant Professor of History Nic John Ramos, PhD, does not easily fit into any one category. Though he teaches in the Department of History, his doctorate is in American Studies and Ethnicity, which he describes as really being at the intersection of Gender Studies and Ethnic Studies. Meanwhile, his research exists at the intersection of race and medicine. And in his classes, students are just as likely to encounter graphic novels and poetry as they are historical documents and books.\n\nTo address the critical shortage of skilled workers in quantum technology and quantum information, Drexel University will offer a new post-baccalaureate certificate in this area. Beginning fall 2021, the Department of Physics will accept applicants who hold bachelor's degrees in physics, chemistry, materials science and engineering, or electrical and computer engineering, and offer them opportunities to learn the fundamentals of quantum technology and quantum information. The aim is to provide a strong foundation in this emerging area, with a focus on the foundations of quantum physics, technological advances on the quantum level, and real-world applications.\n\nClimate change is one of the most serious challenges facing humankind today, and in the coming decades it will impact every aspect of people’s lives and careers. Even though actions are being taken to reduce global emissions, today’s students will live through a period of rapid climate change that is without precedent in human history. To help prepare students to face these problems, the Department of Biodiversity, Earth and Environmental Science (BEES) will offer a new minor in Climate Change beginning in Fall 2021.\n\nFor 100 years, Drexel has equipped students for the real world through our renowned cooperative education program, also known as Co-op. Drexel’s Co-op program provides students with up to 18 months of real-world work experience with industry leaders. This allows students to test-drive careers and see firsthand how the knowledge they've gained in the classroom can be applied in the field, while building an impressive résumé before graduation.\n\nMaegan Poland, PhD, teaches creative writing through Drexel Storylab and composition in the First-Year Writing Program. Her writing has appeared in journals such as Mississippi Review, Pleiades and Beloit Fiction Journal, and has been awarded a Special Mention in the Pushcart Prize anthology, a Tin House scholarship and a grant from the Elizabeth George Foundation. She has served as Fiction Editor for Witness magazine, and as Managing Editor for Yalobusha Review.\n\nDrexel students now have access to a one-stop shop for academic support with Drexel’s new Writing and Tutoring Centers! In May, several of Drexel’s academic tutoring centers moved to the Korman Center, co-locating to support student academic success. Read on to learn more about these resources — and how you can take advantage of them!\n\nIn her second post, Professor Stefanie Kroll, Phd recounts her travels from the capital of Equatorial Guinea, Malabo, to the small town of Moka (population around 200) on Bioko Island. This unassuming place has been the home base for the Bioko Biodiversity Protection Program for over 20 years and where she and other Drexel faculty and students do research year round.\n\nThe continued discovery and documentation of new species shows life on Earth can still surprise us – and it’s clear that conservation and proper cohabitation of this world is increasingly important. Scientists at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University helped discover and recently published a few new slimy, shelled and fossilized species within the past 445 days, and each instance serves as a reminder of just how important biodiversity is.\n\n“Ant-Man and The Wasp,” sequel to Marvel Cinematic Universe’s 2015 “Ant-Man,” is in movie theaters this summer. Wondering how the superheroes compare to real insects, we checked in with the Academy’s Entomology Department, which houses 3.5 million insect specimens – a treasure for researchers around the world.\n\nThere we found Robert Conrow, an affable Drexel PhD student and teaching assistant who studies crane flies with Entomology Curator Jon Gelhaus, PhD, a world expert. Gelhaus also is a professor in Drexel’s Department of Biodiversity, Earth and Environmental Science. Conrow says crane flies would make terrible superheroes “because their long legs easily fall off in the slightest breeze.”\n\nFreshwater mussels and shad were once plentiful in the Delaware Estuary and its tributaries, providing a range of natural benefits to people and waterways. Today they face an uncertain future in local streams and rivers, creating a serious disadvantage when it comes to ecological health.\n\nNow, the Academy of Natural Sciences, the College of Arts and Sciences of Drexel University, the Partnership for the Delaware Estuary, Philadelphia Water Department and Department of Parks and Recreation, Bartram’s Garden, and the Independence Seaport Museum have come together to develop the Aquatic Research and Restoration Center to coordinate large-scale restoration efforts that do not currently exist in the Philadelphia region.\n\n“One time I was in rehab, and they were talking about how there is an original body of pain. And you create more pain on top of that trying to handle the original thing that hurt you.”\n\nSo recalls Ashley Ramey in the trailer for “Original Body of Pain,” a documentary about motherhood and opioid addiction co-directed by Stan Wright, BA Communication ’15, and Dominic Silva, both MFA students at Wake Forest University.\n\nWeather changes, such as the unseasonably high temperatures in Philadelphia this fall, can have serious impacts on health, says Drexel’s Ali Kenner, PhD, assistant professor of political science and of science, technology and society — especially for senior citizens, who are at higher risk for climate-related health complications.\n\nAs hurricane Irma barreled toward south Florida in early September, Kathleen Reardon gathered her staff to give them something akin to a pep talk. The situation in the Caribbean looked truly frightening that morning, with Irma devastating island chain after island chain with a ferocity that left meteorologists astounded. There was talk, too, that the just-developing Hurricane Jose might turn northward and put Bermuda — the headquarters for Reardon and her team at global reinsurance firm Hamilton Re — in harm’s way as well.\n\nFor most people, the thought of camping conjures images of leisurely hikes and starry nights cozied up to a campfire. For geoscience prof Ted Daeschler, PhD, it resembles something more like a two-day flight, followed by a noisy jaunt via military cargo plane, culminating in a 100-mile helicopter ride into the remote terrain and sub-freezing temperatures of Antarctica’s McMurdo Dry Valleys.\n\nFifteen Drexel students stood bright-eyed and eager to entertain in front of cameras rolling at a local hospital. Part of a Drexel community-based learning course dubbed Story Medicine, the students were there to engage sick and disabled children through live broadcast programming, using skits to infuse laughter with a little education.\n\nIf you live in a town or city like Philadelphia where industrial facilities are emitting chemicals into the air, there is plenty of reason to wonder: How is this affecting me? Few communities have access to ambient air-monitoring data, and those that do rarely use it because it is complicated and lacks context.\n\nA sixth-grade science fair project in 2014 led to the discovery that erythritol, the main component of Truvia, is a natural insecticide. Today, that discovery is the basis of a new Drexel-backed startup, BioLogic Insecticide. Simon D. Kaschock-Marenda, now a freshman at Drexel in the College of Engineering, was 11 when he noticed that Drosophila melanogaster, commonly known as fruit flies, died much quicker when they fed on Truvia than on other sweeteners. His father, Daniel Marenda, PhD, professor of biology in the College of Arts and Sciences, was unconvinced at first.\n\nThe typical images that “climate change” conjures include disappearing coastlines and melting polar ice. But what about animals’ brains — including our own? Can they be affected by the changing climate? Sean O’Donnell, PhD, professor in the College of Arts and Sciences, argues that they absolutely can.\n\nWater scarcity is one of the greatest challenges of our time, according to the United Nations. For the Dolan family of Philadelphia, water runs deep and personal. Almost 90 years ago, Philadelphia-area naturalist/adventurist, Brooke Dolan II, led expeditions to western China and Tibet and collected the Asian mammals on exhibit in the dioramas of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University. He and his colleagues also brought back thousands of other specimens to study at a time when the world looked to natural history museums for information on countless little-known species.\n\nThe fires now ravaging North California have been particularly bad this year because years of drought have left the area much like a tinderbox. One way to combat this build-up of “fuel load” is a controlled burn.\n\nAmanda Lough, PhD, assistant professor in the College of Arts and Sciences, is a geologist who focuses on seismology, the study of earthquakes. She explains that although there are some rare cases where one earthquake might lead to another, that is almost certainly not the case in Mexico.\n\nSince Friday, Houston and its surrounding area has been hammered by more than 40 inches of rain, with more set to come. Flooding related to Hurricane Harvey has water cresting dams and forcing people to their rooftops all across the area.\n\nUnder a clear Australian sky, Michael Majok Kuch stood patiently waiting to reunite with his mother. It was July 2008, and it had been two decades since he had last seen her — since he fled his burning village in southern Sudan in the middle of the night as flashes of light pierced the clouded air, his childhood suspended by a civil war he was too young to understand. Just 5 years old, he dodged death on a harrowing journey through refugee camps and across borders, on a path that brought him to the United States and to a new life.\n\nPatrick Rafferty's company works with health care firms, nonprofits and other organizations to create award-winning commercials, public service announcements, documentaries, marketing videos and more. Over the years, he’s interviewed numerous celebrities — everyone from Wyclef Jean to Ross Perot, Bill Gates to Hillary Clinton, Val Kilmer to Quincy Jones — and counts among his clients Discovery Communications, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Georgetown University, the National Institutes of Health and Walt Disney Pictures.\n\nFrom May 14 to May 27, 2017, Gwen Ottinger was a Distinguished Visiting Scholar at the Risk Society and Policy Research Center (RSPRC) at National Taiwan University in Taipei. Her visit included academic talks at National Kaohsiung Marine University, National Chengchi University and National Yang-Ming University, as well as a presentation at RSPRC's \"I Breathe, I Decide\" forum on air pollution.\n\nZee Hakimoglu’s first laboratory was a rock under a makeshift fort that she and her sisters built alongside a small creek at her family’s home in New Jersey. Hakimoglu, then 11 or 12 years old, spent her days and evenings at the water’s edge, studying the spiders and wondering about the constellations. After graduating with her bachelor’s degree in physics from California State College, Sonoma, and her master’s in physics from Drexel, Hakimoglu accepted an associate engineering position at aerospace and defense giant Lockheed Martin, in their Silicon Valley office.\n\n“My life was forever changed by a man whose leg had been amputated,” says Elizabeth Lombardo, PhD, a clinical psychologist and national media consultant, recalling a former patient at the Baltimore Veterans Association Medical Center. At the time of their meeting, Lombardo had just graduated from Duke University with her master’s in physical therapy. “I knew if I could get him up on the parallel bars, he’d be able to walk,” she says, “and I could teach him how to transfer in and out of his wheelchair.” She considers that day a sign of her true purpose in life. Soon after, she applied to doctoral programs in clinical psychology and chose Drexel’s program (formerly part of Hahnemann University) because of its location and because of Arthur Nezu, PhD, one of the program’s directors, with whom she interviewed.\n\nThe Eastern Sociological Society’s (ESS) Annual Meeting was held in Philadelphia, PA from February 23rd - 26th, 2017. ESS was founded in 1930 to support sociological research and networking in the northeast United States, and has about 1,200 members. There were approximately 1,450 registrants at this year’s annual meeting and approximately 200 undergraduates presented posters. Drexel was well represented at the annual meeting with both faculty and students presenting.\n\nHiding inside a hard shell that’s up to four feet long and resembles an elephant tusk, there’s a dark-colored earthworm-like creature. At one end, the creature’s body forms a slight bulb. At the other, claw-like appendages. It doesn’t really eat on its own, but ingests products made by bacteria that live within it.\n\nGraduate and undergraduate students in Drexel's Biodiversity, Earth and Environmental Science (BEES) received an impressive number of awards, scholarships, grants and fellowships for 2017-18. Their academic prowess also earned the department the record for the highest number of honorees for major scholarships/fellowships out of any department in the University!\n\nSeveral Drexel Physics alumni recently received Graduate Research Fellowships from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The purpose of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program is to help ensure the vitality and diversity of the scientific and engineering workforce of the United States. The program recognizes and supports outstanding graduate students who are pursuing research-based master's and doctoral degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) or in STEM education.\n\nShoval Dorani has looked justice in the eye before. Rather than diving into college after high school, Dorani left her hometown of Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, to fight in her father’s native country for the Israel Defense Forces. As a canine handler and commander in the IDF, Dorani — along with her trained military dog, a Belgian Malinois named Gula — came face-to-face with enemy soldiers in combat for three years. So, when she left the IDF to study in Drexel’s Criminology and Justice Studies program, Dorani had one goal in mind: she wanted to “lock up criminals.”\n\nSomewhere in the ridges of Pennsylvania on the Appalachian Trail, a young Christopher Nielson decided that science was no longer his true passion. As he wandered, he thought of the overcrowded chemistry labs he frequented that never quite felt like home. He didn’t miss them. Instead, throughout his whole trip, whenever he had free time, all he really wanted to do was read Shakespeare. When he got back to school, he changed his major to English and he hasn’t looked back since.\n\nFor the approximately 8 million Americans who suffer from binge eating disorder, help could be just a download away. Psychologists in Drexel’s Laboratory for Innovations in Health-Related Behavior Change are developing a new smartphone application that aims to tackle binge eating, and they are seeking study volunteers to test it out. The app, called iCAT+, is for patients who suffer from binge eating disorder or bulimia nervosa."
