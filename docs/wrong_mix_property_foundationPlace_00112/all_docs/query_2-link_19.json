        "text": "The original Moka coffee pot: Moka Express is the original stovetop espresso maker, it provides the experience of the real Italian way of preparing a tasteful coffee, its unique shape and the inimitable gentleman with mustache date back to 1933, when Alfonso Bialetti invented it.\n\nMade in Italy with an ergonomic handle and a patented safety valve which makes it easy to clean. Available in many sizes and suitable for gas, electric and induction (with the Bialetti induction adapter plate)\n\nHow to prepare the coffee: fill the boiler up to the safety valve, fill it up with ground coffee without pressing, close the Moka pot and place it on the stovetop, as soon as Moka Express starts to gurgle, turn the fire off and coffee will be ready\n\nOne size for each need: Moka Express sizes are measured in Espresso Cups, coffee can be enjoyed in Espresso Cups or in larger containers\n\nCleaning instructions: The Bialetti Moka Express must only be rinsed with clean water after use, with no detergents, the product is not to be washed with a dishwasher as it will be irremediably damaged and the taste of coffee altered"
