        "text": "Nickolai Zeldovich is a professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He received his PhD from Stanford University in 2008. His research interests are in building practical secure systems. Recent projects by Prof. Zeldovich and his students and colleagues include the CryptDB encrypted database, the STACK tool for finding undefined behavior bugs in C programs, the FSCQ formally verified file system, the Algorand cryptocurrency, and the Vuvuzela private messaging system. He has been involved with several start-up companies, including MokaFive (desktop virtualization), PreVeil (end-to-end encryption), and Algorand (cryptocurrency). Prof. Zeldovich's work has been recognized by best paper awards at the ACM SOSP conference, a Sloan fellowship (2010), an NSF CAREER award (2011), the MIT EECS Spira teaching award (2013), the MIT Edgerton faculty achievement award (2014), the ACM SIGOPS Mark Weiser award (2017), and an MIT EECS Faculty Research Innovation Fellowship (2018).\n\nMy research has been supported by Amazon AWS, Google, Quanta Computer, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, NSF, DARPA, and Northrop Grumman.\n\nThe MIT-NAD captioning settlement requires this page to contain a link to MIT's accessibility page."
