        "text": "Europe's most magnificent station?\n\nOpened in July 1931, the magnificent Milan Centrale station is a major attraction in its own right with vast steel trainsheds and awe-inspiring station building which Benito Mussolini intended to convey the power and bravado of the fascist regime. Even if you're only changing trains here, take a moment to look around, it's an experience in itself. For more about the history of Milan Centrale see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan_Central_railway_station.\n\nStation overview: Location map Station plan\n\nMilan Centrale is a terminus with 24 platforms. The platforms & concourse are above ground level, but there is level access between all platforms and concourse, with lifts & escalators down to ground level if you don't want to use the grand staircases down to the station's main entrance on the Piazza Duca d'Aosta. So it's no problem to negotiate the station with luggage or if you have mobility issues. There's a plan of the station at www.gsretail.it/en/network/milano-centrale.\n\nFacade: Milan Centrale's imposing facade on the Piazza Duca d'Aosta. You can judge the scale of the building by the people in front.\n\nColonnade, ground level: Immediately inside the front of the station is this vast colonnade, originally a roadway for taxis to pick up and drop off, now pedestrianised. You'll find the escalators down to the metro here. Look up to see the names of Edison and George Stephenson picked out on the ceiling.\n\nEntrance hall, ground level. You can either walk up one of the two grand flights of steps to the main concourse (galleria commerciale), or you can use the escalators visible in the centre instead, or you can take the modern illuminated passageway directly to the Trenitalia & Italo ticket offices, toilets & left luggage.\n\nConcourse (Galleria Commerciale), upper level: Up the steps from the entrance hall is the main concourse or galleria commerciale, adjacent to (and level with) the platforms, one level up from ground level. This is the best place to find a cafe, bar or restaurant or just have a sit down.\n\nIn the centre of the concourse (behind the camera in the photo above) is a gently-sloping travelator leading to the Trenitalia & Italo ticket offices, toilets & left luggage on the lower level beneath. On the right you can see one of the vast doorways leading down to the entrance hall. The platform area is on the left.\n\nTicket gates: There are ticket gates in the various archways between the concourse and the platform circulating area. Scan your ticket barcode to enter the platform area. When leaving the platform area, the exit gates simply open as you approach them.\n\nPlatform area, upper level: Trains arrive in one of these 3 huge arched trainsheds, one level up from street level. There's a large circulating area behind all the buffer stops, allowing easy level access between all platforms without passing through any ticket checks or other restrictions.\n\nLooking from platform towards buffer stops & circulating area.\n\nPlatform circulating area: This is part of the large platform area behind the buffer stops. Those vast archways separate this area from the concourse (Galleria Commerciale) via ticket gates.\n\nWhich platform for your train?\n\nFinding your train\n\nThe station has 24 platforms, numbered left to right as you look towards the trains. The station departure boards shows which platform each train leaves from and there are train departure indicators on every platform. You can easily walk between any two platforms in just 3 minutes (OK, maybe 4 minutes from platforms 1-3 to platforms 23-24), with level access between all platforms, luggage can be pulled on its wheels.\n\nPlatforms 1 to 3 are slightly set back, accessed by a short walk down platform 4.\n\nPlatforms 4 to 21 are the main platforms, lined up inside the main trainshed. High-speed trains to Florence, Rome & Naples typically use platforms 14-17 in the centre.\n\nPlatform 22, 23, 24 are also set back a bit, a short walk along platform 21.\n\nTicket check\n\nThere are ticket gates when entering the platform area from the Galleria Commerciale, mainly intended to control access for non-travelling undesirables. Scan the barcode on your ticket.\n\nCheck your departure platform on your phone\n\nStay one step ahead! If you go to www.viaggiatreno.it/infomobilita/index.jsp on your phone and select Milano Centrale you'll see a list of departures with the planned platform number (Binario previsto) for Trenitalia trains (but not Italo trains) even before the actual platform (Binario reale) is announced on the station departure boards. Just remember that they can sometimes switch platforms on the day.\n\nAlternatively, you can see actual departure platforms for all trains including Italo by selecting Milano Centrale at www.rfi.it/en/stations/station-page/quality-services/Public-information/Live-departures-Arrivals-Monitor.html\n\nChanging trains at Milan Centrale\n\nChanging trains at Milan Centrale is very straightforward. There is easy level access between all platforms, you can walk between platforms around the back of the buffer stops without having to pass through any ticket check. It only takes a few minutes to change trains, even if you were changing from platform 1 to platform 24. Just make sure you allow for any delay to your first train - if a booking website suggests a connection, it will be a reasonable one.\n\nWhen connecting between two Trenitalia trains (for example, a Regionale from Tirano or Como into an onward Frecciarossa high-speed train to Rome or Venice) as long as the scheduled connection is over 15 minutes, you are entitled to later onward travel at no charge if a delay means a missed connection. Online systems will only suggest valid connections. See Trenitalia staff at the help desk if you need reserved seats on a later train. However, that does not apply if you were connecting from a Regionale into a privately-run Italo high-speed train as you'd then be using two different companies.\n\nFree WiFi\n\nThe station has free WiFi. Select the WiFiStation, network and on https://portale.wifistation.it either sign in with a Facebook or Twitter account or enter your mobile number to have a verification text sent to you (this works with international numbers including UK +44 mobiles).\n\nTicket office & ticket machines\n\nThe main Trenitalia ticket office (Biglietteria) is directly below the galleria commercial (main hall) at ground level, open from early until late. You'll also find the Casa Italo (for Italo tickets) at this level. However, it's often quicker to use the Trenitalia self-service ticket machines dotted around the station which can sell high-speed & mainline tickets with reservations and regional tickets. They have a touch screen with English language facility.\n\nLeft luggage, ATMs, safety & security\n\nMilan Centrale has a left luggage office (deposito bagagli) operated by KiPoint, for prices & opening times see the left luggage page. It's located underneath the galleria commerciale on the same level as the Trenitalia ticket office (biglietteria) at the platform 21 end. Follow the signs to the deposito bagagli, see the photo below.\n\nThere are ATMs in various locations around the station.\n\nI've been to Milan Centrale many times over the years and not only do I feel perfectly safe there even late at night, it's one of my favourite European stations. It has so many good shops, bars & cafes it is a destination in its own right and I like spending time there - how do you think I got all the photos? But just to dot my 'i's and cross my 't's It should go without saying that you should be aware of pickpockets in any busy public place - although I've never had or even seen any problem at Milan Centrale myself. Politely but firmly decline if anyone offers to 'help' you use a self-service ticket machine. Just use normal common sense, and even if you're only changing trains you'll experience one of Milan's most celebrated landmarks and one of Europe's most impressive stations.\n\nLeft luggage office, lower level, run by KiPoint.\n\nExecutive & Club class lounges\n\nTrenitalia has a FRECCIALounge for Executive & Business Salottino passengers on its Frecciarossa trains and those with certain Trenitalia loyalty cards. It's located near platform 21. It offers power sockets, free WiFi and complimentary drinks and snacks.\n\nYou can add lounge access to your booking for 20 when you book any domestic Trenitalia Intercity or high-speed train in any class at Trenitalia.com. Look for the FrecciaClub/FrecciaLounge +Add button, or the link to add other services. You can use the lounge for up to 4h before departure.\n\nItalo has an Italo Club lounge for Club class passengers on its Italo trains, located near platform 16. You can use it for up to 3h before your train leaves. In Smart & Prima classes, you're often offered lounge access for an extra 12 or so when you buy your ticket at the Italo website.\n\nThe Italo lounge for club class passengers, on the 1st floor overlooking the circulating area behind the platforms near platform 16.\n\nInside the Italo lounge. Courtesy of Chris Ogilvie.\n\nRestaurants, cafes, bars\n\nMoka cafe: For a coffee, try the Moka cafe, on the first floor with a balcony overlooking the trains, accessed up steps up from the galleria commerciale level with platform 8. There's also a Segafredo cafe on the ground floor of the Galleria Commerciale and various other cafes.\n\nBistrot Milano Centrale: For a light meal, head for the Bistro Milan Centrale (www.autogrill.com/en/brands/bistrot-milano-centrale) on the Galleria Commerciale level with platform 17. It's open until 21:00 and gets good reports.\n\nNoblesse Oblige is my personal recommendation, an excellent, inexpensive & typically Italian restaurant with great reviews just 7 minutes walk from the station, see www.ristorantenoblesseoblige.com. Open until 23:00 every day except Sunday. See map showing walking route.\n\nThere's a McDonalds & Burger King in the Galleria Commerciale at the platform 21 end and a Roadhouse Grill at the other end.\n\nBistro Milan Centrale, in the galleria commerciale. It's a sort of food court for local produce, well worth a look.\n\nNoblesse Oblige restaurant, 7 minutes walk from Milan Centrale, see walking route, www.ristorantenoblesseoblige.com.\n\nSupermarket\n\nIf you need to stock up for your journey, there is a Sapori & Dintorni supermarket inside the station. It's below ground level, accessed down escalators from the entrance hall just inside the station's main entrance.\n\nHotels near Milan Centrale\n\nThere are lots of hotels near Milan Centrale station if you need to stay overnight between trains.\n\nAffordable hotels & guesthouses with good or great reviews just outside Milan Centrale include the Hotel Bristol, Hotel Bernina, 43 Station Hotel, B&B Hotel Milano Central Station, Guesthouse Teodora.\n\nPricier more upmarket hotels include HD8 Hotel, Glam Hotel, Made to Measure Business, Starhotel Echo or Starhotel Anderson.\n\nAt the top end, the 5-star Excelsior Hotel Gallia is just across the road.\n\nLocal transport: Walking, metro, taxis\n\nWalking: It's a 2.8 km 35-minute walk from Milan Centrale to Milan cathedral and the beautiful 19th century shopping mall, the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II.\n\nTaxis: There are two taxi ranks at Milano Centrale, one on the eastern (platform 21) side of the station, another on the western (platform 4) side of the station. There will be plenty of taxis waiting on either rank. For a taxi fare calculator see www.taxifarefinder.com/main.php?city=Milan-Italy.\n\nA taxi to Milan Porta Garibaldi takes around 8 minutes and costs around 8.50.\n\nTip: When heading for Milan Porta Garibaldi, take a taxi from the western taxi rank on the platform 4 side of Milan Centrale as this saves the taxi having to negotiate the main square in front of the station before heading west.\n\nMetro: The escalators down to the metro are in the colonnade, the metro entrance is marked with the usual M symbol. The metro is the easiest way to transfer to the city centre or to Milan Porta Garibaldi station. Some metro ticket gates take contactless bank cards, so you can simply touch in, take the metro and touch out at the other end.\n\nBuses, trams, Milan urban transport: See www.atm.it.\n\nTransfer to/from Porta Garibaldi station: See the advice here.\n\nEntrance to the metro, in the colonnade.\n\nMilan metro, the easiest way to transfer to Porta Garibaldi station.\n\nPlatform 21 & the Shoah Memorial\n\nOn the east side of the station on the via Ferrante Aporti is a holocaust memorial to all those deported from Milan Centrale's platform 21 during WW2, see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoriale_della_Shoah.\n\nYou can visit the memorial 10:00-16:00 on any day of the week except Fridays, check opening times at www.memorialeshoah.it.\n\nThe entrance to the Shoah Memorial, alongside platform 21 on the east side of the station. Courtesy of Noam auf Gleis 13.\n\nInside the Shoah memorial. Photos courtesy of Mark Allbritton.\n\nCan you spot Mussolini?\n\nThere are many murals around the station, and one famously features a young Mussolini himself, greeting the King of Italy on horseback in front of a statue representing Italy. Mussolini's eyes are defaced, possibly part of a general post-war removal of fascist imagery, but according to one story, Mussolini's image was shot at by a partisan in September 1943, and the bullet hole repaired with cement.\n\nThe mural is on platform 21 on the far eastern side of the station. Walk along platform 21 from the concourse towards platforms 22-24. The mural is above one of the doorways to the former royal waiting room, on your right before you reach the buffer stops for platforms 22-24.\n\nThe mural featuring Mussolini, Milan Centrale platform 21. Larger photo.\n\nMore information\n\nThere's more information at www.milanocentrale.it.\n\nSee Milan Centrale station plan\n\nCabina A, one of two distinctive disused signal cabins visible as your train enters or leaves Milan Centrale, in operation from 1931 to 1984.\n\nBack to top"
