        "text": "Study after study has shown that today's college students – Generation Z – are a socially-conscious generation, with their commitment to social good influencing everything from their purchasing decisions to their career paths. One study by Cone Communications found that 94% of the Gen Z individuals surveyed believe companies should help address critical social issues, while a survey by DoSomething Strategic found that 76% of Gen Z respondents said they have purchased or would consider purchasing from a brand to show support for the issues that the company supported.\n\nFor candidates who are looking for a company committed to making a difference alongside their business goals, here are 35 companies with effective corporate social responsibility initiatives.\n\nAdidas\n\nThe famous producer of the ‘three stripes’ athletic wear prides itself on a corporate responsibility structure built on 3 complementary pillars: community involvement, employee engagement, corporate giving. An example of community involvement is the BOKS by Reebok, an Adidas company, before school program, which is designed to bring access to fitness to children between the ages of 5 and 12. The impact of BOK has been measured by an independent evaluator called NOIST which found that the students in the program has not only improved their memory and executive function, but also shaved an average of 16 seconds off their 400-meter run times. Adidas has launched various programs and initiatives like these around the world; such as their Pakison Women Empowerment Program which helps improve the skills of female workers and helps them find strong opportunities in the workplace and their SOS Children’s Village which has grown into one of the largest non-governmental organizations dedicated to to supporting children without families in the world. These amazing programs are a few examples of how Adidas makes a large positive social impact beyond great activewear.\n\nA-LIGN\n\nSince 2013, A-LIGN has been working with their clients to support local charities all around the country. The firm recognizes that, in order to achieve their mission of providing clients with a better community, giving back has to be part of the equation. That is why, every holiday season, A-LIGN donates to charities like Junior Achievement and ASPCA on behalf of the people they’ve served over the last year. In 2020 alone, the team donated nearly $6,000! Outside of the holidays, giving back remains a year-long focus. A-LIGN encourages employees to partake in a community service event and provides a day off every month solely for that reason. Employees, then, do not just commit to a program for a day but are able to truly establish a relationship with local community service organizations and continue contributing monthly. Since the program launched in 2013, A-LIGN employees have clocked over 1,000 hours to organizations close to their heart. Being a part of A-LIGN, whether as an employee or client, means being supported and encouraged to give back-- during every time of year.\n\nBen & Jerry’s\n\nSince their inception Ben & Jerry’s has been connected to promoting grassroots efforts for social justice, protecting the environment, and supporting sustainable food systems. While often they connect their social initiatives to the process of making ice cream, like supporting Fairtrade, Ben & Jerry’s also partners with different social equality groups. One of their initiatives “Justice ReMix’d” focuses on criminal justice system reform and how people of color are disproportionately affected. Their employees are also involved in the Ben & Jerry’s foundation where they serve on committees that review grants for grassroots organizations.\n\nBurlington Stores\n\nBurlington Stores partners with the national non-profit organization Delivering Good in order to keep members of their communities warm through the Burlington Coat Drive. Every holiday season, “Burlington customers, associates, and vendors donate new and gently worn coats at their local Burlington store locations across the country. Through Delivering Good, coats are distributed locally to those most in need within each store community.” With over 2.3 million coats collected by the drive to date, it’s made a significant impact for neighbors in need of a warm coat.\n\nCBRE\n\nCBRE has made it very clear that they are ‘committed to developing healthy communities and actively address[ing] environmental/sustainable, economic, health & wellness, social, transportation and governance impacts’. They launched the Green Machine Campaign to plant 1 million trees and enhance the US canopy, the CBRE shelter program to pattern with US housing nonprofits and create rebuilding projects for homeless shelters, transitional housing and private residences, the Birthday Cakes and More for Homeless Children program to deliver birthday cakes to homeless children, and the CBRE Disaster relief program to support regions affected by disaster, such as Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and California.\n\nCox Enterprises\n\nOne of the ways this global communications company is making a social impact is by powering the potential of promising startups that are focused on addressing today's most pressing social and environmental challenges. The Cox Enterprises Social Impact Accelerator, powered by Techstars, supports mission-driven for-profit startups by guiding them in the early stages of the business, providing access to mentorship, and facilitating pitches to potential investors. Aside from their investment in social innovation, Cox Enterprises has had a national sustainability program since 2007, and has invested more than $100 million in sustainability and conservation projects.\n\nDisney\n\nThe Walt Disney Company believes that education is the key to opportunity and proudly supports its workforce by sponsoring the most comprehensive employer education program in the country. Launched in 2018, Disney’s Aspire initiative covers 100 percent of tuition costs and provides support services to employees as they complete their coursework, including onsite “study hall” spaces and private career coaching. Disney Aspire was launched to expand access to education for its cast members and The Walt Disney Company has pledged $150 million towards high school equivalency, English-language learning, vocational training, college and master’s degrees, and more. The resource allows access to eleven universities and technical schools- including online programs by the University of Arizona and the University of Central Florida and pays the tuition directly to the campus along with textbooks, materials, and other fees. More than half of Disney’s 90,000 full- and part-time hourly employees have taken the initial step to enroll. The Walt Disney Company views this effort as a commitment to build futures and uplift communities through workforce development and does not require that employees pursue an education which relates to the titles they hold with the company.\n\nEsri\n\nAs the world's leading mapping technology, Esri has a special focus on designing a smarter future. That means much of their technology is used by companies working to build a better, more sustainable future. Esri supports organizations working in conservation, education, environmental management, ocean science, green energy, sustainable development, and humanitarian affairs. The technology provided by Esri helps their customers find solutions to local and global problems, from delivering clean water and electricity, sustaining population growth, educating a community, fighting crime, slowing climate change, and stamping out disease.\n\nOrganizations have been using mapping for hundreds of years—and GIS in recent decades—to understand the spread and impacts of epidemics, and Esri’s technology has proved invaluable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Local, national and international organizations have used Esri’s technology to map and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including John Hopkins University’s widely referenced COVID-19 dashboard. Esri also made all its software, virtual training, and on-call technical assistance freely available not only to all its users but also to any organization anywhere in the world that was battling the pandemic. Read more about their efforts here.\n\nFlatiron Health\n\nThis innovative healthcare tech company is driven by its mission of improving lives by learning from the experience of every cancer patient. Flatiron Health believes that learning from the experience of every cancer patient is the key to accelerating research, but cancer data is heavily unstructured. By organizing and standardizing that data, Flatiron helps doctors provide the best care and researchers find more effective treatments faster. Launched in 2012, the company now has 2.2 million active patient records available for research, 280+ community oncology practices, and works with the FDA, the NCI and over 15 of the top therapeutic oncology companies.\n\nF5 Networks\n\nF5 Networks has their priorities clear when it comes to social impact and helping communities. They offer paid time off for volunteering; donation matching; opportunities for employees to participate in localized philanthropic campaigns, grant committees, and the Global Good Ambassador program; and Community Impact Grants. Aside from all of these benefits to ensure their employees have the chance to become involved in service opportunities, they do meaningful work with other organizations: they partnered with NASCOP, the National AIDS and STI Control Programme, to help in their efforts to bring HIV/AIDS under control.

In order to achieve this goal they offer paid time off for volunteer work, especially in roles where they can use their tech expertise to help a good cause. Google also has strong environmental and ethical initiatives, like how they’re committed to sourcing conflict-free minerals in 2012. They also impressively achieved 100% renewable energy in 2017 as the largest corporate buyer of renewable power.\n\nGroupon\n\nCommunity involvement has always been important at Groupon. With coronavirus making it increasingly difficult to volunteer through traditional means, the Groupon team wasn’t afraid to get creative in order to make contributions to their communities. This past summer, “hundreds of Grouponers around the world celebrated [their] value of Community by participating in the company’s first Virtual Volunteer Week. The projects in which employees volunteered “remotely” ranged from transcribing historical documents for Ancestry.com to helping Missing Maps — an international humanitarian organization — use aerial images to map the needs of vulnerable populations.”\n\nHerman Miller\n\nHerman Miller began a new tradition this year: giving employees Election Day off for a Day of Purpose. While the company has always supported having worker’s voices heard, Herman Miller recognized the barriers that work could unintentionally create during Election Day. Instead of just encouraging employees to vote early, Herman Miller gave everyone a paid day off. For employees that voted already, Herman Miller encouraged those individuals to spend the day giving back and even constructed a bingo-like game for employees to work towards. For every 5 activities completed by employees, Herman Miller donated to the non-profit Direct Relief. Herman Miller has a history of giving back. This last year alone, for instance, Herman Miller switched their manufacturing plans to mass-produce masks that could be distributed to their community. Mel Trotter, the largest emergency homeless shelter in West Michigan, and MOKA, a non profit helping individuals with disabilities, are just two of the organizations that have received mask donations from Herman Miller.\n\nIKEA\n\nIKEA focuses on bettering the lives of children through their social initiatives. In the 1990s, they began fighting child labor practices and have continued to support healthy living conditions for children since then.
