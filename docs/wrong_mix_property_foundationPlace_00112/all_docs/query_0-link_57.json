        "text": "All Together Now\n\nVirtualization used to be about servers and desktops, but the technology is working its way into other parts of IT infrastructure. As virtualization adoption has flourished, so too has the services business of IT solution providers.\n\nAll of the hype about virtualization beyond the server is starting to come to fruition. Virtual desktop infrastructure, which has always looked great on paper, is a prime example. VDI has stumbled in the marketplace due to the storage costs and bandwidth demands, but as IT budgets loosen up as part of the broader economic upturn, more organizations are looking at deploying VDI.\n\nMeanwhile, network virtualization is also looming on the horizon. According to solution providers, customers are interested in the technology but still have to get more out of their current infrastructure before they can seriously consider deploying it.\n\nHere, CRN presents its annual list of the virtualization vendors tackling these different facets of the technology.\n\n2X Software\n\nTop Executive: Nikolaos Makris, CEO\n\nLocation: Addison, Texas\n\nThis BYOD-focused vendor offers desktop virtualization, application delivery and thin clients in an integrated product. It also offers a Facebook Client App for secure access to Windows apps and desktops. 2X Software is privately held.\n\nAppSense\n\nTop Executive: Darron Antill, CEO\n\nLocation: New York\n\nAppSense is the largest player in the user/workspace virtualization space and is the most vocal in terms of conference appearances and marketing. It has expanded its scope to include BYOD and enterprise data security. It also offers MobileNow, a SaaS-based mobile device management service for enterprises and SMBs.\n\nAtlantis Computing\n\nTop Executive: Bernard Harguindeguy, Chairman, President, CEO\n\nLocation: Mountain View, Calif.\n\nThe flagship Atlantis ILIO product solves cloud storage challenges with a scale-out approach. The company works with virtualization software from Citrix, Microsoft and VMware to help virtual machines store data more efficiently and in an automated fashion.\n\nAvaya\n\nTop Executive: Kevin Kennedy, President, CEO\n\nLocation: Basking Ridge, N.J.\n\nThe Aura Virtualized Environment, a fully virtualized version of Avaya’s flagship Aura unified communications platform, allows for easy deployment of Aura apps in VMware environments. There are no products yet for Microsoft Hyper-V or Citrix XenServer, but it does offer the One-X communicator platform for Citrix VDI environments.\n\nBig Switch Networks\n\nTop Executive: Guido Appenzeller, Co-Founder, CEO\n\nLocation: Mountain View, Calif.\n\nBig Switch has become the top dog of SDN startups since VMware bought Nicira. It uses the OpenFlow switching and communications protocol, which handles packet routing on a software layer separate from the network’s physical infrastructure. The company recently launched Switch Light, an open-source thin switching platform.\n\nCA Technologies\n\nTop Executive: Michael Gregoire, CEO\n\nLocation: Islandia, N.Y.\n\nCA offers wide range of virtualization management and monitoring tools for cloud environments and plays in data protection, identity management and virtualization security. CA says its heterogeneous management and automation technology can help customers with application delivery and enable them to avoid stalled VDI projects.\n\nCatbird\n\nTop Executive: Edmundo Costa, CEO\n\nLocation: Scotts Valley, Calif.\n\nCatbird pitches ’software-defined security’ as a cheaper alternative to security appliances and says it has made technology easy enough for admins to learn in as little as four hours. Catbird automates asset detection, zone assignments and policy controls, compliance status and quarantine, and handles enforcement of PCI, HIPAA and more.\n\nCeedo\n\nTop Executive: Dror Wettenstein, Founder, CEO\n\nLocation: Rosh Haayin, Israel\n\nThe user/workspace virtualization player is increasingly focused on BYOD and positions its proprietary technology as the solution for mobile computing, remote office security, user-installed application and OS layering challenges.

It also sells management and mobile client software that speeds performance on smartphones and tablets. Certeon works with Amazon, Microsoft Azure and VMware vCloud Director.\n\nCisco Systems\n\nTop Executive: John Chambers, Chairman, CEO\n\nLocation: San Jose, Calif.\n\nCisco’s Virtualization Experience Infrastructure combines VDI and collaboration and was built in collaboration with VMware, Citrix and other ecosystem partners to meet rapidly changing workspace demands created by mobility and cloud computing. VXI enables projects as basic as virtual desktops to more complex initiatives.\n\nCitrix Systems\n\nTop Executive: Mark Templeton, President, CEO\n\nLocation: Fort Lauderdale, Fla.\n\nThe desktop virtualization leader is aggressively building its cloud business with its NetScaler product. Citrix is also the No. 3 player in server virtualization with XenServer.
