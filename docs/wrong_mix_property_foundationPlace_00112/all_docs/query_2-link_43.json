One aim shared by all of the programmes is the development of sustainable entrepreneurship, to bring about an improvement in the living conditions of the entire community. The Foundation supports the autonomy of local communities by emphasising the value of female workers involving the younger generations. It encourages good agricultural practices in order to improve crop yields and coffee quality, and promotes the introduction of technological tools as a means to counter the effects of climate change.\n\nThe Lavazza Training Center is an authentic coffee university: we organize training courses for baristas, restaurant staff, sales reps, our distributors, newly-hired staff, journalists and opinion leaders.

The coffee is still sourced by the same buying team in Italy to ensure the same coffee ends up in your bag at home. Our quality controls remain identical to those in Italy, with product testingevery hour by expert tasters.\n\nThe coffee is sourced, roasted, ground and packed just as it is in Italy; it’s even made on the same packaging line that was used in Italy! Expert blenders and quality control technicians are now based out of West Chester, PA, to ensure the same quality coffee you’ve come to know and love from Lavazza.\n\nLavazza sources its coffee on a global scale from coffee-growing countries, utilizing local teams to ensure the highest quality product is selected. The same buying team in Italy continues to source our coffee, and our West Chester facility has expert blenders and quality control technicians on site to guarantee the same quality and taste as the coffee we produce in Italy. Whether the coffee is roasted and packaged in Italy or the United States, the same coffee and sourcing methods are utilized to ensure a consistent taste profile year over year.\n\nThe only difference in the packaging will be a designation that the product is manufactured in the United States according to the US regulatory Framework.\n\nSome products will be produced in the US and others will continue to be manufactured in Europe. You are guaranteed the same in-cup result regardless of production location. You can find more product information at www.LavazzaUSA.com.\n\nNo changes or updates were made to any of the products aside from being manufactured in the United States.\n\nNo, our team worked closely with the team in Italy to keep the processes as close as possible in order to deliver the same great product. Machines that were in our Italian manufacturing facility were shipped to the new U.S. manufacturing site. The U.S. and Italian R&D teams worked together to ensure the coffee tastes just as it does when manufactured in Italy."
