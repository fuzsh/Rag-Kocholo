        "text": "Dear Corona\n\nBy Pariah/Robert\n\nIt was January 20, on a warm and windy day that Shelia sat on the living room floor watching the Presidential Inauguration along with her parents.\n\nShelia didn't want to be there, but her parents thought it would be educational, and a great memory for her to have by witnessing history being made; seeing the first Black lady inaugurated as Vice President of the United States of America.\n\nShelia understood her parent's desire, but part of her wanted to be in her room Face-timing with her friends, James, and Brittney, about attending social distancing school classes tomorrow, and sharing the excitement with them. And to Shelia, that excitement was history being made after being trapped inside the house for nine months due to a pandemic.\n\nAt one point during the speech, Shelia dozed off and was awakened by popcorn bouncing from her forehead while her mom smiled, and her dad stared seriously at the tv. and pretended as if he had nothing to do with it.\n\n\"Darling, You are going to miss history,\" her dad said with a smirk on his face.\n\nAs Shelia refocused her attention back to the television screen with a look of indifference, there appeared a young lady with a hairstyle similar to hers approaching the podium.\n\n\"Who is she?\" Shelia thought, as the young lady began to speak in a rhythmic and passionate tone that made her want to listen.\n\nShelia's parents noticed the curiosity in Shelia and it made them both proud and happy that there was something that might affect her in a positive way.\n\nOnce the inaugural speech was over, Shelia turned to her parents and said, \"Now, that's who i want to be like!\"\n\nHer dad turned to Shelia's mom with a wide smile on his face and said, \"Honey, i think we have found our next Vice President.\"\n\n\"So Shelia, do you want to be the Next Kamala ?\" her mom asked.\n\n\"No, I want to be the Next Amanda Gorman,\" Shelia replied.\n\n\"Amanda Gorman!\" Her dad blurted out with a confused expression on his face.\n\n\"Yes! I want to speak truth to power, and power to truth, and all that good stuff!\" Shelia said while heading off to her room.\n\nIt was a unifying joy for Shelia and her friends to see each other again inside a school house setting. There was a whole lot of catching up to do for as learning goes, but plenty to laugh and talk about, too.\n\nUnfortunately, being at school today presented a great opportunity to console one another and give face-to-face condolences to those whom had lost a family member or other loved ones to Covid-19 as well. These moments were the saddest for Shelia.\n\nFor the most part, every class felt like a happy family reunion. In English class, Miss Mary announced that there would be a pandemic talent show inside the school gym on Friday, and if anyone wanted to participate, they could sign up at the principal's office.\n\nShelia thought nothing of the talent show announcement, but her friends Brittney and James couldn't hide their excitement. They both thought this would be a perfect time for Shelia to show off one of her love poems, or the poem about the duck chasing the dog's tail.\n\nReluctantly, Shelia gave into their wishes and signed up.\n\nWhen Shelia finally made it home from school, she found her mom in the kitchen cooking her\n\nfavorite meal; fish, hushpuppies, and macaroni and cheese.\n\nHer mom greeted her with a big hug as usual, but today she had a stern look on her face.\n\n\"What's wrong, mom?\" Shelia asked.\n\n\"Well, darling,\" her mom replied. \"Your dad is at the hospital with our neighbor, Mr. Jackson, who has Covid-19 and might be going on a ventilator.\"\n\nShelia liked Mr. Jackson. It was he who gave Shelia her first turtle and dog, too. So, the news of him being sick was heart-breaking.\n\nAt dinner, Shelia and her parents said a prayer for Mr. Jackson, Shelia got chills hearing her dad's voice crack when mentioning his friend's name.\n\nBefore going to bed that night, Shelia told her parents about the talent show. She wanted them both to be there if they could. They agreed and were happy that she had entered.\n\n\"Daddy, don't you and mom worry. Our friend, Mr. Jackson, is going to be okay. God has his back, Shelia said in a reassuring tone.\n\n\"Yes, he does,\" they both replied in unison.\n\nShelia hugged and kissed them both.\n\nIn bed that night, Shelia tried but struggled to find sleep. She couldn't help but to think about her friends, their families, her own family, and poor Mr. Jackson's situation.\n\nThen she thought about the poem she needed to write for the talent show and that young lady at the Inauguration which she had imagined reciting it like. So, with inspiration, she threw back the covers and grabbed her pen and pad, then began to let her thoughts take form on paper.\n\nFriday had finally come and news of the talent show brought out many people masked up in masses. People Shelia had never seen before were there. Her parents were there gladly. Brittney and James were there in attendance probably hoping to hear the duck and dog poem. The only one person missing was Mr. Jackson, but fortunately he was off the ventilator and doing well.\n\nSurprisingly, Shelia managed to keep what she had prepared to perform a secret.\n\nShe didn't know herself in what order the contestants would be announced. She pretended to be calm when her name was called first, and nervously, so nervously she stood.\n\nAs Shelia was making her way toward the stage with butterflies in her stomach, she thought back to the presidential inauguration speech and how might Amanda may have felt looking into a crowd of people, and not being sure of how they would accept what she had to say, or if she could speak it passionately enough for them to appreciate it. Shelia thought again that surely this audience could relate to loss and the fear of things not ever being normal again.\n\nSurely they wanted their voices back to shout, sing, and laugh in the park.\n\nSurely they all shared the courage to fight through this pandemic together and speak truth to power like she was about to attempt to do as she inhaled, exhaled, then spoke ...\n\n\"Dear Corona\"\n\nYou mystic unpredicted stranger\n\nholding hostage my every move;\n\nYou were so far away,\n\nO' how you've crossed so many shores.\n\nYou were just a myth;\n\nA fragment of imagination,\n\nNot worthy of debate\n\nNor casual conversation.\n\nThen you became this perfect storm\n\ntoo strong to hold in place;\n\nFrom north, south, east, and west displacing\n\na whole nation.\n\nHow dare you show up unannounced\n\ntrying to dictate to free people!\n\nI want you gone tomorrow,\n\nthat's my definition of social distancing...\n\nAnd not being isolated from those I call my\n\nfriends;\n\nI have family to hug and kiss,\n\nand birthday parties to attend.\n\nNo! You're not a myth\n\ndancing in my peripheral vision;\n\nbut that pandemic I envisioned no longer a\n\n“threat to the living!\"\n\nThe auditorium exploded with applause, and Shelia was brought to joyful tears.\n\nBecause of Shelia taking the time out on that special historical day to listen, and seizing this opportunity to use her talent and voice to uplift others, she'll always be remembered as a joy and inspiration that has no ending.\n\nTHE END\n\nIt took me about three months of intellectual searching, to discover a title for this dominate writing, that will enable it to captivate the essential & intriguing diabolic-factual aspects of it. So on 8/15/2007 I was finally able to discover it.\n\nWhen I was a lad, due to a lack of knowledge & understanding a very well created false illusion was implanted into my subconscious mind by T.V., and as a result of this sinister agenda, I would vehemently defend my government whenever someone would accuse my said government of being corrupt.\n\nBut then circumstances would find me worthy and gave me a crash course in reality, and so, I want to extend and offer my utmost and truthful appreciation and thanks to all TDCJ-CID employees and specifically I want to thank all CO's and Supervisors, Wardens, Regional Directors, Directors & Executive Directors for shattering the false illusion & Vision that has been created in my mind, and shined a light to expose the dark & vile truths about my said state government here in the Lone Star State of Texas.\n\nFor y'all have taught me, that not only is my government corrupt and evil than the one that the Continental Congress declared war against in 1776!!!!\n\nInitially, I had wrongfully concluded that the said above state government employees had decided to abuse and mistreat prisoners as a means of making them pay for the crimes that they committed, but as I progressed on my intellectual journey, through the concealed land of state government corruption, I came to realize that I had made a very gross and incorrect assessment of y'alls characteristics and motives, so I beg that you forgive me for judging your diabolic intents incorrectly.\n\nBut now me as an individual, like for example, those who worship Satan, then most assuredly, I will not copycat any aspect of their diabolic behavior and conduct, because I detest them.\n\nSo now, if the said State Government Employees really detested criminals, and if they had a simple scintillating of moral values and integrity, then naturally you wouldn't commit any crime and you would be a 100% law abiding citizen, and under no circumstances whatsoever would you \"COPY CAT\" the convicted felons’ behavior and conduct, because the ends never justify the means.\n\nBut also, there is another relevant and interesting subject matter to consider, that is an important factor to this and that is pursuant to the TEXAS CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE whenever you commit a crime, whether it is a misdemeanor or felony, then you have committed a crime against the peace and dignity of the State of Texas.\n\nSo see, you don't dislike criminals at all whatsoever, because the galaxy of facts and evidence proves beyond a preponderance of the case that you are criminals, but that simply who are employee criminals of the corrupt criminal State Government of Texas.\n\nSo it was in my study of history that I discovered a tomb of factual truth that provided me with the clues that enabled me to comprehend and understand the nature of you ones, o'le sinister ones.\n\nNow initially, the training that you prison guards received by TDCJ-CID skill fully picked the rusty lock with masterly skill that had encased in your heart, but it also ignited a cold ember of diabolic desire in you that leaped so high that it touched the stars of heaven and it spread so fast throughout your body that it left you breathless and dazed and now you was able to unleash your diabolic hunger and greed, so as to gratify the evil longing and burning that resides in your heart that was unable to be set free at a much earlier time, due to the secured prison of circumstances that you found yourself in, but once you knew that it was A'OK to harass prisoners (spitting on them) and to lie on them (write a bogues case) and when you perceived that the prisoners were vulnerable and defenseless against your malicious evil, OH MY, the evil that inhabits your diabolic heart, it leaped for joy and let out screams and shouts that sounded like a chorus of demons that were screaming and shouting with sinister bliss as it was on the day that Yahshua was crucified on Calvary !!!!\n\nI just did a tour of duty in AD.SEG. for ten years, so I was kind of secluded from being able to experience and observe the psychological criminal actions committed by the above said scum bag criminals on a broader level, but now that I have been formerly on the Allan B. Polunsky Unit in Polk County, Texas from 8/2005 to 2010 in population that I was able to observe it and study it and analyze it under a magnifying glass of intellectual honesty, so as to learn about the parasite criminals at a more in-depth level.\n\nThough honestly, I have a confession to make to everyone, that is of significant and intriguing value to this story of vile truths. But I do find it immensely and very much amusing, because there are innocent men here in the TDCJ-CID system, and nationwide over 2,745 prisoners have been exonerated by DNA evidence who are innocent, and yet, you sinister prison guards every single day of the year are committing criminal offenses, as if it comes very natural to y'all just like breathing does, and in TDCJ the guards have been committing every crime there is, from child molesting, rape, petty theft, murder, dealing in narcotics, cell phones, tobacco, falsifying state government documents, etc..\n\nNow this next intellectual-gratifying and stimulating truth I will describe, I find it even more amusing, than my previous delightful one, before mentioned herein, and that is, that I have noticed how emotionally agitated y'all get when an innocent man, specifically (yours truly) has the courage to expose you for the crimes that you commit. I picture your gray sharks faces turning beet red, and you are clinching your hands into a fist and you stomp your foot on the ground, and you scream loudly, \"How dare that criminal expose us for the criminals that we are!\"\n\nHa, ha, ha. Oh that, is such a very foul and drastically bad deed that I have committed.\n\nIn studying the history of my Caucasian ancestors in Britain who were kings, lords. earls, barons, etc., I took specific notice that once they obtained power over the peasants and upon them perceiving that the peasants were vulnerable and defenseless it unlocked the evil that was imprisoned in their heart, and so once it was set free, the peasants were murdered, or tortured, had their property stolen, and had their rulers lying on them at court before the judge or king, and they did it so as to gratify their fiendish thirst and hunger, even if it meant disobeying their own laws, and their honor and integrity.\n\nThe state government employees are running an organized criminal operation that is under the guise of criminal justice, that is the Texas prison system, and right now TDCJ-CID is 16 BILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT, because they have been stealing tax payers money, and so basically what we have going on, is that tax payers are paying the TDCJ-CID employee criminals to keep locked up the innocent and guilty John P. Quick citizens on the false pretense of keeping society safe from criminals, while the government criminals are stealing the tax payers money, etc., so one group of criminals are being paid to watch over another group of criminals????\n\nCLARIFICATION\n\nI do realize of course that some of your state employees, judges, prosecutors, police officers, politicians & TDCJ-CID employees have not abused their official authority, and that they are decent people who are simply caught up in the sinister web that has been spun by the master criminals in the government. So my comments are not directed at you directly or indirectly.\n\n* I also want to extend my very deepest appreciation to all of you evil and sinister judges, prosecutors & police, and of course you corrupt politicians. And those in government agencies like the Texas Forensic Science Commission. I have learned a lot from Satan’s children. I hope Yahweh executes judgment on all of you very soon.\n\n** All potential TDCJ employees are given the following Catch 22 proposal:\n\n\"If you are walking down the run with your co-worker, and he walks up to an [someone’s] cell and starts cursing him out, and spits on him, and then writes a disciplinary case on him, will you lie for your co-worker?\n\nThis is a prerequisite that the employee must meet to be qualified to work for TDCJ-CID and anyone who doesn't agree to lie for their co-worker is automatically disqualified from working here. A fellow [incarcerated person’s] spouse applied for a job here, and was given that Catch 22 proposal by a sergeant, and because she is a Christian, she and four others told the sergeant that they wouldn't lie, so none of them work for TDCJ-CID. I have left out her name so as to protect her.\n\n© 2007 JOHN W. BANOS\n\nAugust 21, 2007 revised 6/12/2022 third time.\n\nVoice of Truth, Mr. John W. Banos #545431\n\n3060 FM 3514 Beaumont, Tx. 77705-7635\n\nSITTING DUCKS\n\nBy Bobby Delgado\n\nSitting Ducks, wading through water underneath the dorms leaking roofs, waiting to get hit with the Coronavirus, is exactly what prisoners housed in old, debilitating jails, state, and federal prisons are. There is no escaping the virus. The Marshall Project has counted as of October 27, 2020, 161,349 Covid-19 positive tests and 1,017 deaths among prisoners around the country. According to a report by the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, more Texas jail and prison inmates and staff have been infected and killed by Covid-19, than in any other state Criminal Justice System.\n\nTDCJ response to the alarming report was to remove the daily death count and infections from its website - deliberately setting on a course to keep the prisoner's families in the dark. The website is TDCJ's propaganda tool. In 2017, when Hurricane Harvey struck, and prisoners were evacuated, the website showed prisoners being housed in nice warehouses with double-bunks equipped with all necessities, that is, until a journalist exposed that the video had been taken years before Hurricane Harvey hit.\n\nTexas is a mess. The issue of overcrowding didn't just start with Covid, but Covid has made overcrowding more starker. Prison overcrowding set the stage for contagion. Before the pandemic, Texas health care system was understaffed and underfunded. If the state's health care system is understaffed and underfunded imagine how TDCJ prison health care system must be. There was no testing. No ventilators. No anti-malarial and anti-bacterial drugs to combat the virus. The only thing the medical staff had in abundance were aspirins, but the demand was so great that they even ran out of them! The nurse’s medical advice was, \"Buy them out of commissary.\" But even that was a problem for most prisoners when Texas doesn't pay prisoners for their labor. To compound the problem, families during quarantine periods couldn't make ecom purchases for their loved ones.\n\nTexas ranks number one in locking up, and in executing its own citizens more than California, New York, and any other state in the nation. So how did Texas get to this point? History shows us. It all started in 1849, when Texas built its first prison, the Walls Unit. 171 years later that old, broken-down prison is still open! In 1854; Texas had 69 convicts. The rate of incarceration crept up at a snail's pace: In 1949; there were 5,098 prisoners, in 1961; 11,463, and in 1987; The Texas inmate population was 38,821, while the U.S. prison population was 584,435.\n\nUnder Democratic Governor, Ann Richards, and her Republican successors, Governors George Bush and Rick Perry, 93 of Texas 112 prisons were built between 1990 and 2008, at a time when crime was decreasing. The prison building craze had nothing to do with increasing crime, but with profits. The state and federal Criminal Justice System had become industrial complexes. At the federal level in 1994, Congress passed former President Bill Clinton's crime bill and in 1995, Congress passed the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) that Clinton signed that made it nearly impossible for prisoners to sue prison officials over the violations of their Constitutional Rights. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) was signed by Clinton into law on April 24, 1996, limiting the time to file a habeas corpus to one-year.\n\nPrison growth requires victims: The taxpayers that are going to pay for it, and the prisoners that are going to maintain it. It was a national conspiracy at the federal and state level to incarcerate more of its nation's citizens. But to accomplish that end, legislators would have to get creative in creating new laws, and abolishing old ones, to fill-up the new prisons they were having built. In California, under the new three-strikes law, a third conviction, for even a non-violent crime, was life.\n\nIn Mississippi, under the new enhanced, or habitual sentencing laws, prisoners were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for simple possession of marijuana and shoplifting charges. And in Texas, under the new 1994, \"aggravated law\" excessive prison sentences were handed out for simply scaring someone during the commission of a crime.\n\nPrisons were initially built for violent, dangerous people, but under Texas enhancement laws, stealing a 65¢ snicker bar from a convenience store earned a man a 16 year prison sentence, stealing a roll of toilet paper from a courthouse restroom earned a woman an 8 year prison sentence, and stealing a $12 fajita meat pack from the supermarket earned a man a life sentence! The U.S. Supreme Court's opinion on the case ruled that the sentence was not \"cruel and unusual\" punishment.\n\nTo top it all off, lawmakers abolished the “good time\" law. The earned good time that appears on a prisoner's timesheet today is meaningless when good time no longer shortens a prisoner's sentence, not even by a day. Laws were also changed that made it easier to send back to prison parolees on minor technical parole violations. All these changes and more, contributed to the overcrowding problem.\n\nPrisons today are not for hardened criminals, but mainly for soft criminals that belong in a hospice facility, a drug rehab, or a psyche ward. But since it pays to fill up empty prison beds, the blind, the legless, the wrongfully convicted, the physically and mentally disabled, are all welcomed at the prison's back gate!\n\nEvery department in the Criminal Justice System that has something to gain from mass incarceration plays a role in this national conspiracy. For instance, the governor's appointed parole board members are playing the ratio numbers game. Even the most deserving prisoners eligible for parole won't be paroled if there are beds available. The concept was, you just built the prisons, and we will pass the laws to keep them filled. By 2008, the Texas inmate population had skyrocketed to 160,080 prisoners, while the U.S. Prison population ballooned to 2,319,258.\n\nking the laws, mainly politicians that profess Christianity as their religion. were in defiance to the laws God established for mankind to live by. \"If the thief be found, let him pay double, Exodus 22:7. God's punishment was not imprisonment, but restitution to the victim. In other words, the thief that stole a 65¢ snicker bar would have gone free once he settled his debt of $1.30 with the convenience store owner, or worked out his debt doing a chore for the store owner. God said nothing about imprisoning a thief.\n\nTexas \"aggravated law\" is also in defiance to God's laws. You rob someone by deceiving him that your toy gun is real, or by extending a finger underneath your shirt pretending you have a pistol and the simple robbery charge is upgraded to an aggravated offense - not all prisoners serving excessive, aggravated sentences are dangerous. Nowhere in God's laws does it permit a crime to be punished more severely because the victim was scared out of his money! Should Halloween be prohibited because people are scared into handing over their candy to children? Our nation's laws disregard God's law's.\n\nAnd when we disregard God's laws there are consequences. When state budget crunches hit, as they did during the 2007-09, Great Recession, prisons across the country closed. (In 2010, Texas prison officials, to make-up for a budget shortage of $2.8 million, cut the allotment for meals by replacing milk with powdered milk, and feeding only two meals on weekends at certain units). A 2016, RAND study found 31 states had closed prisons between 2007, and 2012, because of budget restraints. But the RAND study also found that some states after closing prisons, crammed more prisoners into the remaining ones - warehousing prisoners into already overcrowded prisons!\n\nTexas prisons sit on thousands of acres of land but their prisoners are packed into tiny plots of land no larger than a couple of acres. Prisons, like those around Houston built in flood zones are evacuated every time that a hurricane threatens Texas counties in its path - costing taxpayers millions.\n\nBut today evacuating prisoners in cramped buses, in the midst of a pandemic, as it happened several times in 2020, when a record-breaking number of hurricanes struck the Texas coast, posed yet another kind of threat - the spread of the Coronavirus even deeper into the prison system.\n\nOvercrowded prisons threaten everybody's health. Before the Covid-19 crisis hit, inmate janitors were provided with only two cleaning agents in, insufficient amounts. Overcrowding had also badly overloaded the water system, hot water that is necessary for cleaning, was unavailable at peak shower-times and in the housing areas. Though health experts during the pandemic emphasized washing, prison officials did the opposite. Prisoners on quarantine are only allowed to shower once every 3rd day, and often had to go without a clean change of outer clothing for a week. The pre-pandemic outbreaks of staph infections, noroviruses, scabies, rashes, and cysts, are directly connected to uncleanness and overcrowding.\n\nHealth experts even before the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic had warned that building cramped quarters and unhygienic living conditions could make prisons hot zones for contagion. But in overcrowding lawsuits, federal judges weren't listening to the health experts, but listening to the paid whores that prison officials would call to the witness stand to rubber stamp their shortcomings! The American Correctional Association (ACA) to accommodate already built and cramped American prisons, decreased its own 50 square footage recommendation per inmate in cells holding multiple prisoners to 25 square feet in 2012. The ACA reversal of its 1984, recommended 50 square footage, saved prison officials from having to close prisons already built with 25 square footage cells.\n\nTo house the elderly, the sick, and the handicap prison population, dormitory prisons were built. To save money, the dormitory prisons have no chapels, and the contact visitation rooms are small. Visitors that have traveled hundreds of miles, often have to wait outside until room becomes available. The nearly one-thousand men dormitory prisons offer the cheapest way to warehouse prisoners. Each unit has sixteen, 53-men dorms. Each dorm's bathroom has 9-sinks, 4-urinals, and 4-commodes built virtually shoulder-to-shoulder.\n\nDayroom space was converted to bed space. No partition separates the two dayrooms from the living area. The dayrooms combined have a total of seven, 4-men benches and two, 4-men tables. Do your math. The combined maximum dayroom capacity was built for 36 prisoners, which means that 21-men in the 53-men dorms don't fit in. And TDCJ policy forbids inmates from sitting on the floor or standing in the dayrooms.\n\nEach cubicle is separated by four waist-high thin metal walls. On two sides of the walls prisoners live six-inches apart, and prisoners going to and fro on the walkway are separated only by inches. The overcrowding problem is exacerbated by improperly housing disabled, wheelchair bound prisoners, in dorms not built to accommodate their special needs. The dorms resemble slave ships with their human cargo living scarcely inches between them, making social distancing impossible, and mask wearing useless and ineffective.\n\nThe early breakouts of viruses like the norovirus served as an early warning to prison heads that they were not equipped to handle a pandemic. They saw it coming and when it got here most of the prison heads largely ignored it. Texas has a population of 29 million and a relatively low Covid-19 infection rate! However it was due to having the lowest testing rate in the nation! As of April 30, 2020, Texas had tested only 1% of its population. Prison employees were not required to wear masks or social distance. There were no employee temperature checks done at the entrance gate, and no testing for the virus. On March 14, 2020, visitation was stopped. But profits took precedence over inmate safety. Work in the factories continued. Prisoners were threatened with disciplinary cases if they refused to work.\n\nThe biggest threat to those taking precautions not to catch the virus were the inmates and staff members who downplayed the seriousness of the virus. Prisoners who fashioned masks from their own personal clothing had them taken away by ranking officers. Texas prison guards weren't mandated to wear masks until April 6. On April 13, prisoners with underlying medical issues were given one layer, prison made, cloth masks to wear. A week later, everybody was given a prison made mask to wear. The guards weren't social distancing, and several of them were lowering their masks down to their chins to talk.\n\nAt the Powledge Unit, a dormitory prison, no safety measures were taken beyond closing the barber shop, bleaching the walls and floors, and suspending the practice of guards pat searching prisoners. The staff made a show of social distancing the prisoners when they stepped out of their cramped living quarters into the main hallway, but it made no sense when they lived together in cramped dorms! No inmate was tested until June 9. Guards without any medical training conducted the test. Amazingly all of the test results came back negative on June 13.\n\nBy early August more than 15,000 Texas prisoners and 3,200 staff employees throughout the system had tested positive for Covid-19. 181 prisoners, and 18 staff employees were listed as Coronavirus deaths. There was nothing to celebrate for many of those recovering, when 52% had lost an organ, or a body part, or suffering with bouts of extreme fatigue, memory loss, low sperm count, mental duress or suicidal thoughts. While incarceration alone is depressing, the cancellation of visits, library, and other activities added to the stress.\n\nThe lockdowns only increased stress. During quarantine periods TVs were left on but nobody was allowed into the dayrooms - watching the TVs from a distance was like watching a silent movie with no sound. TV channels like TNT, USA, and TBS show nothing but reruns - at the very least new TV channels could have been introduced to keep the prisoner's minds occupied. Phone use was limited to one fifteen-minute call daily. Cold bagged Johnnies with frozen sandwiches replaced hot meals. Even recreation was canceled. It was boredom extreme.\n\nDuring the pandemic lockdowns there was an increase in domestic violence cases among people living beyond the prison fence and an increase in suicide, though they had the luxury to move around the house, talk on the phone, watch TV, and more, that those on lockdown inside the prison didn't have. In Texas, Deputy Inspector General Buttitta's office investigates all prison deaths said, \"He'd seen a slight uptick in suicides amid the pandemic”. One inmate in an East Texas prison jumped off the walkway outside his 3rd tier floor cell to his death after learning he had tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nAt the Clements Unit in Amarillo, Comelius Harper, who had a history of severe mental problems, and of trying to kill himself, was hearing voices and refusing to take his psyche meds. Harper's cellmate had nothing to fear from the invisible enemy. It was Harper, serving life without the possibility of parole for killing three people, he was concerned about. Harper killed the 26 year old Silvino Nunez, his cellmate. The awful smell went unnoticed, presumably because the guards wore mask that masked the awful smell. It wasn't until Harper asked a guard to check on his cellmate, that they found he had been dead for 3 days. He had been choked and badly beaten.\n\nThe world has gotten a small taste of what prisoners who have been single-celled, have tasted for decades in isolation! Now imagine how solitary confinement, that's more restrictive, must have been: A completely dark, bare cell, a full meal only on every third day, and absolutely no luxuries. It's baffling to someone like myself that spent nearly a decade in Ad. Seg. and years in solitary confinement to see these tough talking politicians, that created Ad. Seg. and solitary confinement for \"others,\" complain about their constitutional rights being violated! They protest “their” lockdown that is for their own safety! My God, what wimps! They expect others to spend years in lockdown, but they themselves can't even do fifteen days in lockdown without throwing a temper tantrum and filing a lawsuit!\n\nPrisons are largely made of concrete and steel which absorb the summer heat. Because of this, temperatures inside prisons well after sundown can exceed outdoor temperatures. Due to Covid, respite areas where prisoners could go to escape the heat, were closed. Each dorm has four large fans blowing hot air around. The main hallway has another ten large fans. In late August at the Powledge Unit when temperatures reached 100 degrees, prison officials made two, big stupid mistakes. The first mistake was when pat-down searches resumed to train a dozen new recruits, and the second mistake was made when the dorm across from ours was turned into a quarantine dorm. Guards wearing blue plastic protective gowns would exit the quarantine dorm, and to cool off, stand right in front of a hallway fan! With the large fans blowing hot air everywhere and with feverish, coughing Covid-19 patients across from us, we knew we were sitting ducks!\n\nOn September 4, when the unit inmate population was tested a second time, the results were different. Hundreds of the Covid-19 test results came back positive. A quarantine unit lockdown followed. The young and the elderly, and the healthy and unhealthy, and those serving small, non-violent sentences were not sentenced to death, but some would die because of the prison officials’ stupid mistakes, and slow response, to the spread of Covid-19 in the Criminal Justice System.\n\nHowever, the lion's share of the blame for the Covid-related deaths in jails and prisons go back several decades, when governors and lawmakers appropriated money for the construction of overcrowded squalor communal prisons! They then added to the problem by not appropriating any money to adequately staff the prisons they had built! For a century the prisons have been understaffed! Prior to 1983, the prisons had been illegally staffed with inmate-guards, and prior to the pandemic there was a shortage of 4,500 guards. During the pandemic there were more than 5,000 Vacancies out of 26,000 positions. The agency is short of an additional 1,000 correctional officers due to quarantine. Practically, all of the guards are working 16 to 20 hours a day. There are no surveillance security cameras. And because of extreme guard shortages, incompetent guards that would have never been considered for a ranking position, now qualify. Security and safety have been compromised.\n\nGovernor Greg Abbott that's responsible for the \"safety and well-being” of the prisoners knows - like Silvino Nunez family found out, that he cannot guarantee the prisoner's safety when there is, and always has been, a guard shortage. And neither can the governor guarantee that the safety measures in place will protect the healthy prisoner from catching Covid-19, nor can he guarantee that prisoners infected with the virus will receive the proper medical care! The only sensible option was to release prisoners. But the brain-dead governor did the opposite. Even as the numbers of infections continued to steadily climb systemwide, the Governor, and the parole board he appointed, ignored the thousands of calls and protest to release over 15,000 healthy prisoners, who had been approved for release before the pandemic struck! Releasing them for their own safety, would have also eased overcrowding, lowering the risk of prisoner's contracting the virus.\n\nGovernor Abbott's reckless insanity to instead lock all the doors to the burning house, leaving behind grandfathers, grandmothers, fathers, mothers, sons and daughters to fend for themselves, was the governor's ultimate dereliction of duty to preserve life. Just as Jews were wood for Auschwitz ovens, so were prisoners the wood that would fuel the fires in the communal hot zones. All that the prisoners were waiting for was that one untested Covid-19 carrier to walk through the prison front gates that would ignite the wood and set the place ablaze!\n\nTexas Lieutenant Governor, Dan Patrick gives us insight into the elitist mentality. Patrick on Fox News outraged some people when he said, “Senior citizens should be willing to risk a painful death of intubation and fluid-filled lungs in order to get America back to work!\" The livelihood of businesses, like his, were of more value than the lives of senior citizens.\n\nAt the highest risk for contracting Covid-19 are the senior citizens. And those who are in the highest category for successfully completing their paroles without re-offending again, are the senior citizens. Parole data shows that 98% of the senior citizens released who served at least ten years in prison went on to live as law-abiding citizens. But for career politicians like Governor Abbott that don't want to appear soft on crime, he chose to keep the door to the burning house locked to even the senior citizens! The end result for some, was death.\n\nThe white privilege class of wealthy, famous, and powerful prisoners in federal VIP, five-star luxury prisons (that are not overcrowded) were being paroled before TV cameras for their safety - the expendables: the poor and powerless in overcrowded prisons were largely ignored. According to the University of California, Los Angeles law, Behind Bars Data Project, more than 16,000 inmates released, or diverted, from local jails and state and federal prisons amounted to less than 1% of the 2.2 million people behind bars in the United States.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is no innocent bystander in the Covid-19 related deaths, but a willing accomplice, who for decades systematically dismissed prisoner's lawsuits challenging prison overcrowding, understaffing, and unhygienic living conditions. Most recently, Texas prison officials, after being ordered by federal District Judge Keith P. Ellison, to provide testing, masks, soap, and sanitizer to prisoners at the Pack One Unit, where over 20 inmates had died, appealed. The prisoners weren't asking to be released, but only asking for the tools necessary to protect themselves. In November, the Republican majority of 5th Circuit Court Justices declined to order state officials to beef up safety measures. That the daily increase of infections and Covid related deaths would continue to rise, were as foreseeable as they were preventable.\n\nIn December, Texas surpassed the million mark for Covid-19 infections and surpassed 25,226 confirmed Covid-19 deaths - the 2nd highest death count overall in the U.S., trailing only New York, according to researchers from John Hopkins University.\n\nOn December 10, when temperatures dipped down to 30°, forty-one Covid-19 sick prisoners of all ages at the Powerledge Unit, were moved to the cold gym and placed under quarantine. The unit is dangerously overcrowded, so the men are sleeping on mattresses placed on the floor. The men suffering from symptoms, like diarrhea, share one commode and three urinals. Mistakes previously made keep repeating themselves, and with the head warden on quarantine, most of the unit went on lockdown again on December 31. As one guard put it, “There's only one guard for every 200 prisoners, because everybody is dropping off like flies!\" Isn't this evidence of \"cruel and unusual\" punishment? Proof that if the high court and newly elected politicians don't change the direction in which the wind is blowing, that the next pandemic will prove to be even more deadly?\n\nBecause of the recession and severe budget restraints prisons have closed nationally. TDCJ has now for the first time dropped below 100 prisons. TDCJ can still safely close another forty prisons and reduce the inmate population by another 55,000. As of this writing 220 Texas prisoners and 36 TDCJ employees have died and another 22,000 have been infected with Covid-19. Thousands that have recovered will never be the same. Due to pre-existing guard and nurse shortages, overcrowding, and unsanitary living conditions in Texas prisons, will the number of infections and Covid related deaths, daily continue to rise in the Criminal Justice System if the wind keeps blowing in the same direction.\n\nI WAS HER SON\n\nBY CARTER P.

He and I were both in our early thirties, both from up north, and both serving life without parole at the same maximum-security prison in South Carolina.\n\nOne night, while walking the prison's upper tier, I spotted Ben heading my way with a smile on his face. As we neared each other, he reached out and embraced me with both arms.\n\n\"I love you, Santiago,\" he said.\n\nThe hug was as unexpected as it was unusual, and I did not reciprocate. I stood like a statue with my arms rigid at my sides. People don't just hug each other like this in prison, I thought.\n\n\"I... uh... love you, too, bro,\" I managed, pulling away.\n\nIt felt awkward. At a loss for what to say, I turned around and fast-walked in the opposite direction. I had no idea Ben was about to commit suicide.\n\n* * *\n\nImagine spending the rest of your life locked inside a tiny prison cell the size of a parking space with no hope of ever being released. How long could you endure being trapped in a dungeon while simply waiting to die? That is what it means to serve a life-without-parole sentence, condemned to die on America's slow death row.\n\nThere are over 200,000 people serving life sentences in the United States, and despite declining crime rates, our number is growing. America locks up more people for life than any other country.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but, if I had a life sentence, I would just kill myself.\" Over the years, more people have said this to me than I can recall. I've heard it from prison guards and from my fellow inmates. I've even heard it from my own family. And every time I hear it, I think of Ben. I remember the decision he made. I lament the fact that I couldn't stop him from taking his own life. Couldn't even return his goodbye hug.\n\nIt's 5:45 a.m., and I'm lying on a thin piece of plastic-covered foam that I refuse to call a mattress. My back aches, and my right arm is stiff. Still in my orange prison uniform, I swing my legs over the side of my bunk and place my feet into a pair of tattered, white sneakers. Joints pop as I struggle to stand and stretch. What will \"life\" throw at me, today? I wonder.\n\nI study my reflection in a slab of polished steel bolted to the concrete wall of my cell. Dark circles ring my tired eyes. My hair is thin and graying. I clip my prison ID card to the left collar of my uniform. In the ID photo, my hair doesn't look so gray. I'm almost dead, I tell myself. My ID card might as well be a toe tag identifying a walking corpse. Killing myself would be redundant.\n\n* * *\n\nEvery day, I wake up and convince myself not to commit suicide. Not to give in to the same hopelessness and despair that crushed Ben's will to live. To find some meaning in the suffering. To live in a way that is sane. Every day, I wake up to attend my own funeral.\n\nI acknowledge that what I did--the horrible crime I committed 18 years ago--was wrong. If I could go back in time and change what happened, I would. I cannot possibly regret what I did more than I already do. Just thinking about it makes me wish I had never been born.\n\nBut no matter how sorry I am, no matter how much guilt or remorse I feel, I remain labeled an irredeemable person. While other inmates can reduce the amount of time they spend in prison by earning time-credits for good behavior, work, and education, there is nothing I can do that could possibly reduce my life sentence. What incentive do I have to obey the prison rules? Why should I continue to pursue my education? I'll never sit for a job interview or be evaluated by a parole board. My sentence places me beyond redemption.\n\nNot only is life without parole irreducible, it also cannot be extended. If I were to commit additional crimes, no more time could possibly be added to my sentence. Why should I live in accordance with the law? More importantly, why is our criminal justice system turning hundreds of thousands of Americans into an unpunishable class of hopeless convicts with nothing left to lose?\n\nIt's called a \"life\" sentence, but that's a misnomer. The truth is, life without parole is death by incarceration. It's death in slow motion. I am not \"doing life\"; I am simply going through the motions of being alive. Trying to piece something together from the wreckage of my life. I am lying in a casket, waiting for someone to close the lid.\n\nWhat is the purpose of a life-without-parole sentence? Does locking people like Ben in prison with no prospect of release accomplish anything besides cruelty at the taxpayers' expense? What about lifers who are no longer dangerous? Don't they deserve a second chance? What about lifers who have \"aged out\" of criminal behavior and are no longer the same people they were decades earlier? Don't they deserve even the possibility of parole? These are questions we need to ask ourselves as a society.\n\nLife-without-parole sentences are pointless and cruel. Nobody deserves to be punished to the end of their life. As a democratic society, we should recognize the inherent worth and dignity of all people. Human beings have the capacity for positive change and personal transformation, and if people can change, so, too, can their laws.\n\nIt's time for sentencing laws in America to change. Life-without-parole sentences serve no purpose except sadism and schadenfreude. There should be no place in a civilized society for this level of cruelty. Everyone deserves a second chance, and once an offender has served a reasonable sentence, our laws should afford him or her an opportunity to rejoin society. That's what Ben would have wanted. It's what he deserved.\n\nIt's time to end life imprisonment.
