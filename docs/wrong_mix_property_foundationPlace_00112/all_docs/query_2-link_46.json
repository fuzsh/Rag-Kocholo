        "text": "The 10 Best Portable Coffee Makers\n\nWhether you prefer an AeroPress or a French press, we’ve found the best ways to make a great cup of joe anywhere.\n\nI have a weird superstition. It feels like the quality of my morning coffee is a portent for the kind of day I'm going to have. It's not only the dose of caffeine that does the trick, although that does help. It's also the ritual that surrounds it—the smell, the sound, and even the wait are all a part of how coffee sets me up for the day ahead.\n\nIt's easy to feel lost without that morning ritual, especially when you're already uprooted and far from home. Whether you're out camping, on a business trip, or visiting friends and family, getting that little taste of home can help you feel grounded and ready to face the day. We've rounded up the best portable coffee makers to brew while traveling. Some of these options are also great for people who aren't working from home, since office kitchens are likely closed.\n\nCheck out our other buying guides, including the Best Latte and Cappuccino Machines, Best Cold-Brew Coffee Makers, Best Portable Espresso Makers, and Best Espresso Machines.\n\nUpdated September 2022: We've double-checked prices, and updated our advice.\n\nSpecial offer for Gear readers: Get a 1-year subscription to WIRED for $5 ($25 off).
