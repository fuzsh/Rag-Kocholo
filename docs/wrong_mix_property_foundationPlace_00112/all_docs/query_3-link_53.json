        "text": "Lizards and Snakes\n\nAround 3 AM on February 25, 2022, a man attempted to cross the US-Mexico border near at San Ysidro with nearly 60 reptiles hidden in and under his clothes. He was arrested by US Customs and Border Protection, who then contacted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Unfortunately, two reptiles did not survive the long journey, and many exhibited signs of dehydration. The large number of animals could represent an entire local population that was poached from the wild. The damage to the ecosystem could be irreparable. The San Diego Zoo provided the animals with habitats containing appropriate lighting and plant species native to Mexico to replicate their natural ecosystems. Some horned lizards were housed permanently at the Los Angeles Zoo, where there are professionals who have specialized knowledge in their care.\n\nIndochinese Green Magpie\n\nIn March of 2017, 93 Asian songbirds were smuggled from Vietnam to the United States and subsequently confiscated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the Los Angeles Airport. After being stuffed in suitcases for the long journey, only 8 individuals survived. One of those songbirds was a Yellow-breasted Magpie, also known as an Indochinese Green Magpie. Since these species’ populations are in decline, it is important to be proactive in conservation efforts than reactive. The Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens was asked by USFWS to provide a lifetime home to Jolie, which they provided to her in the zoo’s aviary. For 6 years she thrived under exceptional care. She became famous as the 14,000th animal photographed by Joel Sartore for his Photo Ark Project. Unfortunately, Jolie passed away in September of 2023 for reasons unknown. Victims of the illegal trade often have shortened lifespans due to the trauma and cruel circumstances of their capture and transport. Jolie was an ambassador for her species as well as for the tragedy of the illegal wildlife trade.\n\nCoral\n\nIn June of 2018, a package containing 19 fragments of live coral was intercepted at the airport in Honolulu, Hawaii. The fragments were of 4 different species. Two of which are protected under the Endangered Species Act. Arriving from San Diego, these corals were destined for Australia. The corals were confiscated at the airport and temporarily housed at the Waikiki Aquarium. They were then shipped back to San Diego where they found a permanent home at the Birch Aquarium at Scripps. Numerous specimens are currently housed in public viewing exhibits at the Birch Aquarium where they are thriving. They even help with coral conservation by helping to reduce the amount of coral removed from the wild! Propagation (asexual reproduction through fragmentation) creates a source of fragments that can grow into entire colonies. Birch Aquarium’s coral conservation efforts allow wild populations to thrive without human intervention and support other conservation initiatives around the globe.\n\nBengal Tiger\n\nOn August 23, 2017, two individuals attempted to cross the border from Mexico into Southern California. US Customs and Border Protection officials noticed a small tiger cub with them, and the individuals were subsequently arrested. The tiger cub was confiscated by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and transported to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park’s (SDZSP) veterinary hospital, where the 6 pound, five week old cub received critically needed medical care. The SDZSP staff named the cub 'Moka' (or 'chance' in Hindi). Moka continued to thrive until around 7 months old when he developed a limp. Wildlife care specialists determined that his left leg had not developed properly. Likely a result of malnutrition prior to confiscation. As Moka grew, and with supportive care, the limp subsided.\n\nAs Moka approached adulthood, he was recommended to move to a big cat sanctuary called Lions, Tigers & Bears. There he continues to thrive thanks to the swift action of the officer that rescued him as a cub at the border, the wildlife health and animal care experts who helped raise him at the Safari Park, and the wildlife care team at the sanctuary who ensure he has plenty of space to roam and all of the food and enrichment he needs to be a healthy tiger.\n\nBlack-Handed Spider Monkey\n\nMateo’s Rescue\n\nIn June 2020, baby “Mateo” (a 4-month-old spider monkey) was found inside a vehicle console at the Port of Hidalgo. He was confiscated at the border and placed under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After receiving initial care at Gladys Porter Zoo, Mateo was transported to Dallas Zoo for quarantine. In September 2020, Mateo was transported from Dallas Zoo to the Brevard Zoo in Melbourne, Florida. Mateo has been successfully integrated into the existing spider monkey troop at Brevard Zoo and can frequently be seen playing on habitat with the troop.\n\nMateo’s Journey\n\nMateo survived and will now live out his life in the comfort and care of an AZA-accredited facility. But many spider monkeys in the illegal trade are not as lucky. Mateo was likely captured from his wild home as an infant. This scenario typically involves the mother being killed first, to make it easier for poachers to steal. Once caught, Mateo would have likely made the traumatic journey to the border stuffed inside a bag or small cage, along with several other animals that had also been taken illegally and bound for the pet trade—all facing dehydration, starvation, injury, and disease. Many will not even survive this journey. It is no surprise that it is estimated that for every one live baby chimpanzee that makes it out of the trade alive, ten were killed in the process.\n\nBox Turtle\n\nRescue\n\nIn May of 2017, US Fish and Wildlife Services, discovered 25 box turtles, between two separate airline shipments through a wildlife detection dog. On a flight from Wichita to Chicago, these turtles were bound for an end destination in Beijing, China. Unfortunately, due to health issues in about half the turtles (mycobacterium infection as well as other complications) the original goal of repatriating the turtles back into the wild was no longer a viable solution. The turtles were held for 11 months in a permanent quarantine at Lincoln Park Zoo, under significant medical attention, until they were finally healthy enough to be permanently placed among other facilities.\n\nJourney\n\nNorth American turtles are under siege, and people who buy a pet turtle may not realize the far-reaching and inhumane impacts that choice can have on wild populations. Routinely removed illegally from the wild, box turtles are the number one native North American turtle in the illegal pet trade. Most of the thousands of turtles seized annually by law enforcement officers do not survive. These animals are often treated horrifically during collection and transport. For the turtles that survive the harrowing journey, many become sick and shortly thereafter die.\n\nBlack-Handed Spider Monkey\n\nJ’s Rescue\n\nIn July 2021, baby “J” (a 5-month-old spider monkey) was tossed out of the window of a vehicle after someone was caught attempting to smuggle him across the U.S./Mexico border. Baby J was found 18 hours later inside of a bag by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and was subsequently seized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Unable to be returned to the wild, and as soon as he was cleared by CDC quarantine, baby J was transported from the Dallas Zoo to his forever home at the Brevard Zoo. J has been successfully integrated into the primary troop, which includes Mateo. J continues to gain confidence and can often be observed initiating in play behavior with the other young monkeys.\n\nJ’s Journey\n\nJ survived and will now live out his life in the comfort and care of an AZA-accredited facility. But many spider monkeys in the illegal trade are not as lucky. Like Mateo, J was likely captured from his wild home as an infant. This scenario typically involves the mother being killed first, to make it easier for poachers to steal. Once caught, J would have likely made the traumatic journey to the border stuffed inside a bag or small cage, along with several other animals that had also been taken illegally and bound for the pet trade—all facing dehydration, starvation, injury, and disease.\n\nMany will not even survive this journey. It is no surprise that it is estimated that for every one live baby chimpanzee that makes it out of the trade alive, ten were killed in the process.\n\nCommon Chuckwalla\n\nRescue\n\nDiscovered in Coachella Valley, CA in September 2020, four common chuckwallas, and seven desert iguanas, were recovered by Bureau of Land Management agents. The reptiles were originally purchased online by undercover BLM field agents through a larger wildlife trafficking investigation. Shortly after confiscation, the reptiles arrived at the Living Desert Zoo. Once separated into appropriate enclosures for optimal interaction among individuals, BLM and UCR Deep Canyon aided in developing care protocols for the reptiles that TLD utilized until the individuals were released back into Coachella Valley in May 2021.\n\nJourney\n\nAs the third largest group of reptiles seized globally, lizards have become another unfortunate victim of the illegal pet trade. The smuggling of most live reptiles often results in death. Shoved into small bags, boxes, and even suitcases, going days without food or water, through inadequate and fluctuating temperatures, it really is no surprise that most individuals do not make it to their destination alive."
