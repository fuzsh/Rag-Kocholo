We use a coffee to water ratio around 1:10-1:13. For this recipe, we'll consider the classic Bialetti using 28g coffee to 300 g water to make 6 cups.",

        "text": "Step 1: Preheat the water\n\nThis is the first tweak from traditional brewing to take your moka pot coffee to the next level. Bring kettle water to a boil and remove from heat. We do this to keep the temperature of the moka pot from getting too hot and burning the coffee.\n\nStep 2: Grind your coffee on a drip coffee setting, about as fine as table salt.\n\nYou need enough coffee to fill the filter basket, which is about 28 grams for a 6-cup Bialetti moka pot.\n\nStep 3:\n\nAdd the heated water and fill to the line or valve in the bottom of the brewer.\n\nStep 5: Fill the basket with coffee\n\nLevel the surface off with your finger. Brush away loose grounds on the top edge of the filter basket.\n\nStep 7: Put the brewer on the stove\n\nUse moderate heat and make sure that the handle away from the heat. Leave the top lid open.\n\nStep 8:\n\nOnce you hear a puffing sound the coffee will begin to come out. It will start with a rich-brown stream that will get lighter in colour as it brews. Once the stream is the color of yellow honey, remove from heat source with hot pads and close the lid.\n\nStep 9: Stop extraction\n\nStop extraction by running the bottom of the pot under cold tap water. This will help produce a cup that is concentrated and rich.\n\nSingle-Serve Drip Bag\n\nEach drip bag coffee brews a 200ml-240ml cup (7oz-8oz). These are an excellent choice for outdoor days such as hiking, camping, or cycling. Easy to make and with no clean up!\n\nLearn How-to\n\nAuto Drip\n\nWe use 1:15 coffee to water ratio for Drip coffee. Read as in 1g of ground coffee for every 15 grams (ml) of water. Our recipe makes about 500ml of brewed coffee which is about 17 ounces.\n\nLearn How-to"
