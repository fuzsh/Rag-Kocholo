I had the croissant sandwich and it was delicious. Definitely recommend adding bacon. The fruit that came with it was very fresh and delicious. My husband had the sweet hawaiian portuguese linguica and he loved it. The eggs were cooked perfectly - crispy on the outside, cooked whites, and runny yokes. Highly highly recommend ordering something that comes with the rosemary bread. The service was also excellent and everyone was very friendly.\n\nreview by - YELP\n\nBeverly G:\n\nOur family was visiting San Diego and wanted to try this place out! Really fast service and great food! The line is first come first serve so be prepared to wait at least 20-40 minutes. Not pictured but i also had a chai latte with oat milk and it was one of the best lattes i've personally had. Would definitely recommend coming back when i'm back in town\n\nreview by - YELP\n\nAlly A:\n\nFirst come first serve so it was about a 15-20 minute wait, but 100% worth it!! I got papas con Chorizo and eggs, spicy and amazing. The French toast is incredible (and huge). The potatoes are nice and crispy, everything perfectly cooked. We shared a fruit bowl and all the fruit was perfectly fresh and delicious. 10/10 recommend we are so impressed! Omi our waiter was a great worker, worked quick and very kind, and great service all around from everyone! Worth every penny!\n\nreview by - YELP\n\nGuadalupe c:\n\nThis is our second time to Mission Cafe when we are in San Diego and it never disappoints. Excellent service and good food. Rosemary bread is fluffy and soft delicioso. I tried the sweet and savory tamales with over easy eggs. They were so good. Masa was on point. Green Chile sauce over your tamales. My husband had the breakfast burrito and he loved it as well. Service was great. Definitely one of our favorites in San Diego.\n\nreview by - YELP\n\nBrandie D:\n\nTwo weekends in a row we have began our days here! The food is superb!!! We have branched out and tried new dishes like the papas and chorizo! This place is popular so come early and try something new! Their mocha late is delish. If you order a michelada have them put some soy sauce in it - yummo! It would be rude not to mention that their service is fantastic even when they are slammed!"
