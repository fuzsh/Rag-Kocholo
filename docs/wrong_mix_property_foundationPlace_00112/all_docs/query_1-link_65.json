        "text": "From the Deputy Director\n\nWelcome to the November issue of FYI, our First 5 Alameda County newsletter.\n\nIts almost mid-year and we have begun to implement many of the changes identified in our 2005-09 Strategic Plan. Some of our new programs include the launching of a new web-based training registration, ECC Online. In addition, we are working to expand child development screening in several community clinics and physician offices. We have selected a consultant, Design, Community and Environment, to begin our comprehensive Early Care and Education for All planning process in preparation for the statewide Preschool for All initiative on the June 2006 ballot.\n\nWe are pleased to announce that the 2004-05 Every Child Counts Annual Report will be available in early December. This report illustrates the work we do at Every Child Counts through outcomes data and stories of families and providers.\n\nAs the holidays approach and the year comes to a close, we wish all of you a good year as we continue our work together to improve the lives of young children and their families.\n\nJanis Burger, Deputy Director\n\nLegislative Update from the CEO\n\nNew Legislation Increases First 5 Accountability\n\nThe governor recently signed AB 109, authored by Assemblywoman Wilma Chan and SB 35, authored by State Senator Dean Florez. Both pieces of legislation are intended to increase accountability and consistency for County First 5 Commissions.\n\nThe provisions of the legislation for County First 5 Commissions include: adopting conflict of interest policies, developing a cap on administrative expenses, establishing contracting and procurement policies and establishing a salary and benefit scale. Compliance with these provisions will become part of the annual independent audit that each First 5 must have done every year. Failure to comply will be grounds for the State Commission to withhold funds until compliance is achieved.\n\nFirst 5 Alameda County has most of the required policies in place and we welcome the opportunity to strengthen the program statewide. This will help policy makers and the public to have confidence that the best and most efficient use is being made of the resources we are stewards of on behalf of young children and their families.\n\nMark Friedman, Chief Executive Officer\n\nDid You Know?\n\nCorps Retention Rate on the Rise\n\nEach year Every Child Counts offers stipend incentives to child care providers to increase their education and to keep them working in the field of early care and education. The percentage of returning Corps members has consistently increased since 2001. In 2004, 1,652 stipends were awarded to Corps members. 89% of the stipends were to returning members, indicating these Corps members met educational requirements and kept working in the field.\n\nGrantee Profile\n\nMuseum of Children's Art\n\nThe Museum of Childrens Art (MOCHA) offers creative arts experiences to children in schools, in the community, and at its studios in Oakland. Of the 25,000 East Bay children who participate in MOCHAs programs annually, more than 70% are from low-income families and 85% participate in programs free of charge. Approximately 5,000 children are under age five.\n\nIn 2001, MOCHA opened the Little Studio, a space designed for children ages 18 months to 5 years, which encourages exploration of the creative arts in a hands-on environment with caregivers. Activities include painting, drawing, clay, collage, play acting, a reading corner and an outside space for water play.\n\nWith funding from their 2005-07 ECC grant, MOCHA is establishing the Little Studio Artist Residency Program which places MOCHA artists in childcare settings to engage children in creative art activities and to train, coach and advise caregivers/teachers and parents on creating appropriate experiences and environments for an arts-rich early childhood education.\n\nMOCHAs Little Studio just completed a major renovation. Hours are 10:00 am to 5:00 pm Tuesday through Friday and from 12:00 noon to 5:00 pm on Saturday and Sunday. No pre-registration is required. The cost is $5.00 per child, however, no child is turned away for lack of funds.\n\nMOCHA accommodates groups of 6 or more children in the Little Studio with advance notice. For more information, contact Danielle Freeburn, Registrar, at (510) 465-8770, Ext. 308 or danielle@mocha.org. Visit their website at www.mocha.org.\n\nThe Center for the Education of the Infant Deaf\n\nThe Center for the Education of the Infant Deaf (CEID) in Berkeley provides preventative screenings, diagnostic testing and early intervention services for newborns and children through five years of age with hearing loss and speech and language delays.\n\nTo address the communitys unmet need for greater access to hearing screening for all newborns as mandated by state law under the California Newborn Hearing Screening Program Initiative, CEID has received funding from ECC to help staff its new community-based Pediatric Audiology Suite.\n\nCertified by California Childrens Services (CCS) as an outpatient provider, CEIDs goal is to assist overburdened hospitals and clinics in meeting the demand for timely hearing screenings of newborns. Hospitals, community health agencies, clinics and pediatric caregivers now have the option to refer families on their waiting lists to CEID, where initial and/or secondary screenings are performed on sleeping babies up to four months of age in a soundproof room by a highly trained audiologist. The screening takes just 3-7 minutes and identifies children who are deaf or hard of hearing.\n\nIf a child does not pass the hearing screening, CEID coordinates follow-up testing and care with the Bay Area/Coastal Hearing Coordination Center (HCC). If needed, CEID is able to perform more formal diagnostic testing, which includes three to four tests that check every part of the childs hearing system.\n\nFamilies eligible under Medi-Cal and CCS may receive services at no cost. Any Alameda County family whose baby is under four months of age and did not receive an initial hearing screening at birth may receive a free screening. Insurance coverage is also expected to be accepted as the program grows.\n\nHours for the Audiology Suite are M-F, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. Evening and Saturday appointments are also available. For more information, please call (510) 848-4800, Ext. 310 or email jillellis@ceid.org. Visit their website at www.ceid.org."
