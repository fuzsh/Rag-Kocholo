        "text": "The GROSCHE Milano is the best-selling series of Stovetop Espresso coffee makers. These type of coffee percolators are also called Moka pots, and are an authentic Italian style of brewing espresso coffee. These Moka pot stovetop espresso makers make a strong, rich and smooth coffee that is more dense than regular drip coffee makers, French presses, or pour over. Their cup sizing is in espresso cup sizes - not regular coffee mugs. So, a 6-cup coffee Moka pot will brew 6 espresso cups. The Milano stovetop espresso maker moka pots use fine grind coffee beans and are compatible with a variety of stove tops. The Milano stovetop espresso makers are made of led-free, food grade safe aluminum and come with a Certified Italian safety valve made in Italy to prevent internal pressure build up. The aluminium Moka pots work on gas stoves, electric stoves and camping stoves but are not for induction stoves, while the stainless steel espresso makers, like the Milano Steel are induction compatible. We recommend hand washing for all Moka pots. They are easy to disassemble and clean, and their features include a heat resistant soft touch handle & knob. How to make moka coffee: 1. Add water to just below the safety valve. 2. Add fine ground coffee to the coffee funnel, filling it completely. Dont tamp or compress the coffee. 3. Screw on the top chamber until its snug, ensuring the safety silicone seal is present under the top chamber. 4. Place on stove top on low to medium heat. In around 4-6 minutes your water will bubble up through the coffee and your moka expresso coffee will be in the top chamber. 5. Remove from heat and pour into your cup. Precautions and care: Moka pots should always be hand washed - the Aluminium versions will get damaged in dishwashers - Aluminium moka pots are NOT DISHWASHER SAFE. Our Milano Steel black stainless steel and brushed stainless steel moka pots can be placed in a dishwasher. Every GROSCHE product sold funds 50+ days of safe drinking water to people in need via the GROSCHE Safe Water project. By choosing GROSCHE you are making a positive difference in someone's life. Hence the GROSCHE brand mission: Every Cup Fills Another."
