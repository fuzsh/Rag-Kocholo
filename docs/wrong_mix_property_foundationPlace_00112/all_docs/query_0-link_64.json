        "text": "Victor Bahl (ACM/IEEE/AAAS Fellow, ACM Distinguished Speaker, IEEE Distinguished Lecturer)\n\nPrincipal Researcher and Director, Microsoft, USA\n\nKeynote Talk Title: Cloud 2020: The Emergence of Micro Datacenter for Mobile Computing\n\nTime:8:30-9:30AM, Thursday, Feb. 19, 2015\n\nAbstract:\n\nResource poverty is a fundamental constraint that severely limits the types of applications that can be run on mobile devices. This constraint is not just a temporary limitation of current technology but is intrinsic to mobility. In this talk, I will put forth a vision that breaks free of this fundamental constraint. In this vision, mobile users seamlessly utilize nearby computers to obtain the resource benefits of cloud computing without incurring WAN delays and jitter. Rather than relying on a distant cloud the client connects and uses a nearby micro datacenter (mDC). Crisp interactive response for immersive applications that augment human cognition are then easier to achieve. While much engineering and research remains, the concepts and ideas introduced in this talk open the door to a new world of disaggregated computing in which seamless cognitive assistance for users can be delivered at any time and any place.\n\nBiography:\n\nVictor Bahl is a Principal Researcher and Director of the Mobility & Networking Research (MNR) Group in Microsoft Research. MNR's mission is \"to invent & research technologies that make Microsoft's networks, services and devices indispensable to the world\". In addition to pursuing untethered research and shepherding brilliant researchers, Victor helps shape Microsoft's long-term vision related to networking technologies by advising Microsofts senior executive team and through associated policy engagement with governments and industries around the world. He and his group have had far-reaching impact on the research community. Government policy, and Microsoft products through many significant technology transfers. His personal research spans a variety of topics in mobile computing, wireless systems, cloud services and datacenter networking & management. Over his career he has built many highly cited seminal systems, published prolifically in top conferences and journals, authored over 110 patents, given over 35 keynote talks, won numerous awards and honors including ACM SIGMOBILEs Lifetime Achievement (Outstanding Contributions) Award and IEEE Outstanding Leadership and Professional Service Award, and has engaged in significant professional and company-wide leadership activities. Victor received his PhD from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1997. He is a Fellow of the ACM, IEEE and AAAS.\n\nMichael I. Jordan (NAS member, NAE member, AAAS member, ACM/IEEE/AAAS/AAAI/ASA/CSS/IMS/ISBA/SIAM Fellow)\n\nPehong Chen Distinguished Professor, University of California, Berkeley, USA\n\nKeynote Talk Title: On the Computational and Statistical Interface and \"Big Data\" (PPT1, PPT2)\n\nTime:8:30-9:30AM, Tuesday, Feb. 17, 2015\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe rapid growth in the size and scope of datasets in science and technology has created a need for novel foundational perspectives on data analysis that blend the statistical and computational sciences. That classical perspectives from these fields are not adequate to address emerging problems in \"Big Data\" is apparent from their sharply divergent nature at an elementary level---in computer science, the growth of the number of data points is a source of \"complexity\" that must be tamed via algorithms or hardware, whereas in statistics, the growth of the number of data points is a source of \"simplicity\" in that inferences are generally stronger and asymptotic results can be invoked. I present several research vignettes on topics at the computation/statistics interface, including work on parallel/distributed machine learning and on the interface between learning and privacy. [Joint work with John Duchi, Xinghao Pan, Yuchen Zhang, Joseph Gonzalez, Stefanie Jegelka, Joseph Bradley and MartinWainwright.]\n\nBiography:\n\nMichael I. Jordan is the Pehong Chen Distinguished Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the Department of Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley. His research interests bridge the computational, statistical, cognitive and biological sciences, and have focused in recent years on Bayesian nonparametric analysis, probabilistic graphical models, spectral methods, kernel machines and applications to problems in distributed computing systems, natural language processing, signal processing and statistical genetics. Prof. Jordan is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science., He has been named a Neyman Lecturer and a Medallion Lecturer by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and has received the ACM/AAAI Allen Newell Award. He is a Fellow of the AAAI, ACM, ASA, CSS, IEEE, IMS, ISBA and SIAM.\n\nLarry Peterson (NAE member, ACM/IEEE Fellow)\n\nRobert E. Kahn Professor, Princeton University, USA\n\nKeynote Talk Title: OpenCloud: A Value-Added Cloud for Network Operators\n\nTime:8:30-9:30AM, Wednesday, Feb. 18, 2015\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Cloud is rapidly changing the face of the Internet, building on two disruptive technologies: multi-tenant virtualized clusters and Software Defined Networks (SDN). Multi-tenant virtualized clusters enable scale-out designs with flexible resource use and good cost/performance. SDN makes it possible to both manage complexity and customize the network. These technologies are being deployed throughout the Internet; they are not limited to the data center. Network operators are migrating away from purpose-built hardware appliances and moving towards infrastructure that exploits virtualized commodity servers and SDN at the very edge of the Internet, a practice being called Network Functions Virtualization (NFV). This talk puts forward a vision for a Value-Added Cloud that demonstrates how network operators can take advantage of cloud technology. It also describes a prototype, called OpenCloud, that we are building with Internet2.\n\nBiography:\n\nLarry Peterson is the Robert E. Kahn Professor of Computer Science, Emeritus and Director of the Princeton-hosted PlanetLab Consortium. He served as Chair of the CS Department from 2003-2009. In 2007 Peterson co-founded CoBlitz LLC to commercialize CDN technology developed on PlanetLab. CoBlitz was acquired by Veriue Inc. in 2010, and subsequently by Akamai in 2012. Peterson is co-author of the best selling networking textbook Computer Networks: A Systems Approach (5e), and chaired the initial planning efforts that led to NSF's GENI Initiative. His research focuses on the design and implementation of networked systems. Some of his recent projects and papers can be found here.\n\nProfessor Peterson is a former Editor-in-Chief of the ACM Transactions on Computer Systems, was on the Editorial Board for the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking and the IEEE Journal on Select Areas in Communication, and served as program chair for SOSP, NSDI, and HotNets. Peterson is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a Fellow of the ACM and the IEEE, the 2010 recipient of the IEEE Kobayashi Computer and Communication Award, and the 2013 recipient of the ACM SIGCOMM Award. He received his Ph.D. degree from Purdue University in 1985."
