Amersham Museum is a fantastic community resource which offers a professional and engaging learning programme. Its particular strength is a focus on local history using archive material and objects to explain the development of Amersham over time. The Museum staff have developed a fantastic relationship with local schools which is reflected in the number of repeat visits and strength of the programme.
