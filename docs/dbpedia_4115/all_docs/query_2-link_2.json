        "text": "Welcome to Amersham Museum\n\nOur collection is presented around five key dates, that reflect particular and important moments in the town’s history. For each of those dates we have considered what the town looked like, who lived in the town and related that to objects in our collection. Click on the images to find out more.\n\nOur Scrapbook\n\nHelpful tip: to find a particular house, person or street, try using the SEARCH box in the left hand column of every page (or below on mobile phones).\n\nAlthough we call it the Amersham History section of this website, it does not pretend to provide a full history of the town; for that we recommend Julian Hunt’s excellent book A History of Amersham. This section is more like a well-indexed, searchable and ever-expanding giant scrap-book, telling the stories of people who have lived in the town, often in their own words. Click here to find out how to carry out personal research into your house or family."
