        "text": "Entrances and Access\n\nOur main entrance is on Akeman Street. It has eight steps with a handrail in the middle and on either side. There are two heavy, glass doors into our foyer that are 87 centimetres wide and that open inwards and outwards.\n\nOur schools entrance is on Park Street and is step free. The road is quiet but the pavement is narrow and thereâs often cars parked half on it. Go into our quad through the pinned-back double gate, up the paved path then turn left at the end. Before entering our main building, youâll pass our cloakroom and accessible toilet. To enter our main building, go through the large, wooden door that is 1.19 metres wide and opens outwards, then go over a small, raised join. This door is pinned back during good weather and closed when itâs wet and cold.\n\nParking\n\nHastoe Lane\n\nThereâs free car parking on Hastoe Lane. It has 48 spaces, including three Blue Badge holder spaces and two parent-and-toddler spaces. The car park surface is small stones with a bound surface underneath. Itâs about 120 metres from our step-free schools entrance on Park Street.\n\nTo reach us from Hastoe Lane car park go through the woodland on the bound sand path. On the way youâll cross a five-metre-long wooden bridge thatâs slightly raised from the path and then go through a gate thatâs 1.1 metres wide and pinned open. The path through the woodland has some bends and there may be bumps and holes. During poor weather there may also be puddles and piles of leaves.\n\nAt the end of the path thereâs a slight decline down to another gate. This gate is pinned open and leads onto Park Street. From this gate to the road thereâs a further decline and the ground here can be uneven. Cross the road at the dropped curb, then go through the open gate into our quad then follow the paved path.\n\nOur Akeman Street Car Park will be closed from March-December while we work to restore the roof of our Grade II heritage listed building.\n\nOur Akeman Street car park has two Blue Badge holder spaces. Itâs tarmacked and is on an incline as you enter. From the Blue Badge holder spaces, our main entrance is 75 metres away and our step-free schools entrance is 120 metres away.\n\nTo get to our main entrance from our Akeman Street car park, exit the car park using the path that runs next to our building. If youâre parked on the far side of the car park or in the two Blue Badge holder spaces, cross the two zebra crossings to get to this path. Thereâs an island in the middle of the crossings with a dropped curve and tactile paving on both sides.\n\nOnce on the path next to our building, follow it to the entrance to the car park then turn left onto Akeman Street. The pavement on Akeman Street is about 1.7 metres wide and is on a slight incline. Continue along this pavement until you reach a gate on your left. Go through this gate that is one metre wide and pinned open, then go up the eight steps.\n\nTo get to our step-free schools entrance, donât go through this gate, instead continue along the pavement. When you reach the end of Akeman Street turn left around the corner onto Park Street. Continue along until you reach an open gate on your left that leads into our quad. Go through the gate and up the paved path. Our step-free schools entrance on Park Street is about 45 metres away from our main entrance on Akeman Street.\n\nAlternative car parks are available off the townâs high street. The car parks managed by Dacorum Borough Council are free for the first hour with a small charge after that.Â\n\nTransportation\n\nBy road\n\nTring is on the A41, 48 kilometres northwest of London. From the M25, exit using Junction 20.Â\n\nBy train\n\nThere are regular train services to Tring station, which is about three kilometres from us. From the train station you can reach us by bus or taxi.\n\nUse theÂ National Rail journey plannerÂ to check train times. Find local transport information on theÂ Tring Town Council website.\n\nBy bus\n\nBuses run from most of the towns in the area. Plan your bus journey onÂ the Hertfordshire Travel Information website or call Traveline on +44 (0)870 608 2608.\n\nNeed a cab?\n\nTring CarsÂ are available 24 hours a day and can be booked through the Cabs4U app.\n\nCoach parking\n\nThere are two coach parking spaces in the overflow car park off Hastoe Lane."
