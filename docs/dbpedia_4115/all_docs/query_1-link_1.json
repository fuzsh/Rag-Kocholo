        "text": "Independent local history museum in Buckinghamshire , England\n\nAmersham Museum at 49 and 51 High Street is a small local museum based in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, England.[1] It is located on the High Street in Old Amersham.\n\nThe museum is partly located in a 15th-century half-timbered house, listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England, with a herb garden to the rear, and covers local history.[2] It has collections of fossils and archaeological finds, including objects from Roman and mediaeval times, and displays on local crafts including chairmaking, lace making and straw plait.[3] It originally opened to the public in 1991. In 1993 the museum won a National Heritage Award. In 2001 it was extended at the front of the museum, and in 2005 it employed its first professional curator.\n\nIn 2017 the Museum re-opened following a major development that included expansion into the neighbouring property at 51 High Street, a former post office. This enabled the museum to create a new introductory exhibition gallery, combined activity and temporary exhibition space, two collections stores, indoor adapted WC and lift. The museum also gained a modern glass reception and shop.[4]\n\nIn March 2024 the Museum re-opened with a new temporary exhibition gallery, the Marie-Louise von Motesiczky Gallery, named for the emigree Austrian artist who lived in Amersham during the Second World War, and whose Charitable Trust funded the redevelopment.[5]\n\nAs of May 2023 , the museum is open from 12noon to 4.30pm from Wednesdays to Sundays plus Bank Holiday Mondays. Normal admission is £6 for adults (£7 including donation) children free. An annual pass, allowing access for a full year, is £10.[6]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of museums in Buckinghamshire\n\nSt Mary's Church, also in Old Amersham\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
