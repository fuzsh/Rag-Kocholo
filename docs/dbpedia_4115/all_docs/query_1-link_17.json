        "text": "Amersham Museum has scooped the national Sandford Award, which recognises local institutions who have gone the extra yard in offering formal education programmes for local children and residents alike.\n\nMuseum curator, Emily Toettcher, said: “We’re so pleased to have received a Sandford Award. We’ve worked really hard to build up our programme for schools and it’s brilliant to have this recognition.\n\n“Our amazing team of volunteers and freelancers have helped to make this possible and we’re really grateful for their support, particularly in such challenging times.”\n\nThe volunteer-led museum in the High Street has adapted brilliantly to the challenges of lockdown, having been closed since mid-March 2020, only opening for a couple of weekends in the lead-up to Christmas.\n\nThe Sandford Award has gone out to just 500 local resources in the 43 years since its founding, and judges commented that the museum represented a fantastic community resource which offers a professional, engaging learning programme.\n\nThey continued: “Its particular strength is a focus on local history using archive material and objects to explain the development of Amersham over time.”\n\nTo find out more about the museum’s school’s programme, visit amershammuseum.org/events/schools-education-groups\n\nPicture credit Hoss Photography"
