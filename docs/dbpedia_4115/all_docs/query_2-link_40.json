Sit at the Tudor dinner table, relax in the 1930s living room, or listen to stories in Ron Haddock’s 1960s record shop. Investigate our timeline display from fossils to doll houses, and medieval tiles to historical maps. Visit our changing exhibition programme, join a guided walk (walk leaflets are available to buy at the Museum’s shop or you can download your PDF copy at the link below), take part in an activity session, or wander through our medicinal herb garden.\n\nDownloadable Walk Maps\n\nAmersham Museum is open from Wednesday to Sunday, from 12 noon until 4:30pm.\n\nFull museum events calendar can be found here."
