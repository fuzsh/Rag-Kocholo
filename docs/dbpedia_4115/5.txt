“Amersham Museum brings local history to life to inspire, surprise and engage people, helping them to explore the significance of the area’s past, appreciate the present and imagine the future.”

Amersham Museum’s vision, adopted 2024

Amersham Museum has been open to visitors since 1991. In July 2017, it reopened after a substantial redevelopment and expansion into the neighbouring Victorian building. The project enabled the museum to better reveal their medieval building, previously hidden to the High Street. The work also created a new, stunning glass reception space, new exhibition space, a wonderful activity space and new dedicated stores for the museum’s collection.

Find out more about visiting the museum

The displays in our Tudor building focus on five key dates in the town’s history: 1580, 1775, 1892, 1939 and 1964. Visitors can find out about the people who lived in the town at the time, the buildings from that era and what daily life was like drawing on the collections, including maps and oral histories.

In 2024 we opened a new timeline display which features people, places and events, alongside objects from the museum’s collection. From fossils to a taxidermy dormouse, a 1930s dolls house to a 1980s award for black pudding, and medieval Penn tiles to a range of historical maps, there’s plenty of opportunity to explore intriguing objects and their stories from Amersham and the surrounding area.

Our new Marie-Louise von Motesiczky Gallery hosts temporary exhibitions showcasing themed displays which combine our own collections with items borrowed from other museums, alongside work created by local people – all investigating local lives and creativity.

The museum has a wonderful garden, full of plants with medicinal and domestic uses. Each is labelled to help you find out what they are and what they can be used for.
