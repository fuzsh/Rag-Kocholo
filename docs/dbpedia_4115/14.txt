Renovated in 2017, this local history museum housed partly in a medieval building tells the story of Amersham, an historic market town in the Chilterns. The displays focus on five key dates in its history, ranging from the 1580s to the 1960s, and there are multimedia quizzes, interactive elements and a gift shop.
