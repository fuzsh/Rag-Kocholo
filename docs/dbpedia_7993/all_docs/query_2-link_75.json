His book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (SSR) is also regarded as one of the most influential works in the philosophy of science. Kuhn famously introduced the concept of paradigm to analyse the history of science. He also developed the incommensurability thesis. Kuhn’s work contributed to the so-called historical turn in the 20th century philosophy of science. Its influence goes beyond philosophy of science and makes a profound impact on history of science, sociology of science, and the social sciences. In commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kuhn and the 60th anniversary of the publication of SSR, the conference aims to examine Kuhn’s contribution to contemporary philosophy of science, revisit his legacy for the history and philosophy of science, and reflect on the prospect of the Kuhnian philosophy of science.\n\n*For more information, please click here.\n\nSubmission Guidelines\n\nPlease submit a 500-word abstract via Easychair by 28 February 2022.
