At the same time, the University encourages persons participating in expressive activity to engage in respectful discourse, have concern for the safety of persons and property (as outlined in policy AD103, Visitors Rights and Responsibilities), and show consideration for University acSeptember 18, 2023 - Addition of time, place and manner language under section \"Locations for Expressive Activity.\"tivities, even when perspectives differ.\n\nThe purpose of this policy is to provide guidance to Penn State students, faculty, staff, and others who wish to engage in speaking, literature distribution, poster or sign displays, petitioning, and similar noncommercial activities (generally referred to as expressive activity) at outside locations on University grounds.\n\nPENN STATE GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS ON UNIVERSITY PARK CAMPUS\n\nPenn State students, faculty, staff, and registered University student organizations or a group of ten or more University students, faculty, or staff may reserve the University Park campus outdoor areas listed in this policy. Questions and requests for information should be directed to the Event Management Office (125 HUB-Robeson Center) via email at hubevents@psu.edu.\n\nNON-PENN STATE GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS ON UNIVERSITY PARK CAMPUS\n\nThose external to Penn State should direct questions and requests to Campus and Community Events in the Office of Strategic Communications via email at psuevents@psu.edu. Reservation is voluntary but encouraged to avoid conflicts and ensure availability.\n\nPENN STATE CAMPUSES OTHER THAN UNIVERSITY PARK\n\nAt Penn State campus locations outside University Park, groups and individuals not affiliated with Penn State; University-registered student organizations; and groups of University students, faculty, or staff should contact the respective campus chancellor’s office to reserve a location for expressive activity.\n\nPENN STATE HEALTH\n\nTo protect patient privacy and maintain a healing environment for patients and families facing challenging diagnoses or injury, additional restrictions for expressive outdoor activities might apply on grounds associated with Penn State Health. Those internal or external to Penn State should direct questions and requests to leinhornravitz@pennstatehealth.psu.edu.\n\nTIME, PLACE, AND MANNER RESTRICTIONS\n\nThe Pennsylvania State University is committed to the free exchange of ideas and the principles of academic freedom, in accordance with the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. However, the right to speak is not a right to speak at any time, at any place, and in any manner that a person wishes. Courts have long recognized that public colleges and universities have the right to set reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on the use of their campus facilities to maintain campus safety and prevent material and substantial disruption of the functioning of the universities or infringement on the rights of others. Simply put, this means that The Pennsylvania State University can delineate the “when, where, and how” of free-speech activities, if it is applied in a content neutral way (in other words, it must apply to all speech, no matter how favored or disfavored) and it leaves ample opportunity for speech in alternative areas or forums.\n\nThe University’s time, place, and manner restrictions take into account, among other considerations: environmental, health, and safety concerns; wear and tear on facilities; the direct and indirect costs to the institution; appropriateness of the event to the specific facility and the specific building policies; and the overall impact of the event on the campus community, surrounding neighborhoods, and the general public. Examples of such restrictions include:\n\nRegularly scheduled University activities take precedence over spontaneous activities.\n\nUniversity facilities may not be used in ways which obstruct or disrupt University operations, the freedom of movement, or any other lawful activities. No activity may obstruct entrances, exits, staircases, doorways, hallways, or the safe and efficient flow of people and vehicles.\n\nExpressive activity may not create unreasonable safety risks nor an imminent threat, health, or safety hazard.\n\nLOCATIONS FOR EXPRESSIVE ACTIVITY ON UNIVERSITY PARK CAMPUS\n\nBased on careful study, the following areas on University Park campus have been designated as outdoor areas suitable for expressive activity (note: some areas could incur costs):\n\nOld Main front patio\n\nAllen Street Gate Plaza\n\nWillard Building grounds (area between Willard and the obelisk)\n\nPlaza in front of the Forum Building, Northwest corner of Shortlidge Road and College Avenue\n\nFisher Plaza\n\nInformation Sciences and Technology (IST) Westgate Plaza\n\nPattee Library Mall (entrance plaza)\n\nHUB-Robeson Center rear sidewalk pad (not the patio)\n\nHUB-Robeson Center lawn\n\nOsmond Fountain area\n\nArea under the Willaman Gateway to the Life Sciences\n\nWhen selecting a location, groups should consider such factors as the number of people involved in the activity, how much space will be required, and the anticipated time and duration of the activity.\n\nRESERVING LOCATIONS ON UNIVERSITY PARK CAMPUS\n\nLocations identified in this policy may be reserved under the following conditions:\n\nReservations can only be made for one location per day and the same location cannot be reserved for more than one day in each calendar week.\n\nReservations must be requested at least fourteen business days in advance of the proposed activity.\n\nReservations will be accepted in the order of request, unless considerations of format, size, and equitable distribution of locations requires allocation of locations.\n\nReserved spaces have priority.\n\nReservations are non-transferrable.\n\nReservation is voluntary but encouraged to avoid conflicts. Any public outdoor area on University Park campus may be used in accordance with this policy.\n\nCosts may be incurred at some locations.\n\nREQUIREMENTS FOR EXPRESSIVE ACTIVITY AT ALL CAMPUS LOCATIONS\n\nIn addition to other University policies and rules that apply to students, faculty, staff, and visitors, the following requirements specifically apply to expressive activity by individuals and groups at outdoor locations:\n\nUse of sound amplification equipment is generally prohibited between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Amplification is permitted at the Old Main location at University Park between noon and 1:00 p.m.\n\nGroups and individuals are requested to voluntarily use the designated areas but may use any outdoor area open to the public that can safely be used so long as noise levels do not conflict with the conduct of University business and crowds do not impede egress and ingress to University facilities.\n\nPedestrian or vehicular traffic must not be impeded in any manner.\n\nDisturbance of or interference with classrooms, offices, study facilities, libraries, or other University facilities and activities is prohibited.\n\nSafety precautions and protection of Penn State’s buildings and grounds (as outlined in AD57, General Regulations on Use of University Property) must be followed.\n\nDamage or destruction of property is prohibited.
