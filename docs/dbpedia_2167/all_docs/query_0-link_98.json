        "text": "Commercial Drivers must self-certify to the type of driving they intend to do with their license or permit and provide DMV with a copy of their USDOT Medical Examiner's Certificate, if applicable.\n\nInterstate and Intrastate Driving\n\nThe first step to determining your driving type is to decide if you drive, or expect to drive, a Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV) in Interstate or Intrastate commerce. Interstate commerce is when you drive a CMV:\n\nfrom one state to another state or a foreign country, or\n\nbetween two places within a state, but during part of the trip, the CMV crosses into another state or a foreign country, or\n\nbetween two places within a state, but the cargo is part of a trip that began or will end in another state or foreign country.\n\nIntrastate commerce is when you drive a CMV within New York State only and your driving does not meet any of the descriptions above for interstate commerce. If you operate in both Interstate and Intrastate commerce, you must choose Interstate commerce.\n\nExcepted and Non-Excepted Driving\n\nExcepted Interstate (EI) or Excepted Intrastate (EA) Commerce\n\nWhen you drive a CMV only for the following activities:\n\nto transport school children and/or school staff between home and school, or\n\nas a federal, state, or local government employee, or\n\nto transport human corpses or sick or injured persons, or\n\ndriving a fire truck or rescue vehicle during emergencies and other related activities, or\n\nprimarily in the transportation of propane winter heating fuel in response to an emergency condition that requires an immediate response, such as damage to a propane gas system after a storm or flood, or\n\nin response to a pipeline emergency condition that requires an immediate response, such as a pipeline leak or rupture, or\n\nin custom harvesting on a farm, or\n\nto transport farm machinery and supplies used in a custom harvesting operation to and from a farm, or\n\nto transport custom-harvested crops to storage or market.\n\nas a beekeeper in the seasonal transportation of bees, or\n\ndriving a vehicle that is controlled and operated by a farmer, and\n\nthe vehicle is used to transport agricultural products, farm machinery, or farm supplies to and from a farm within 150 air miles of the farm, and\n\nthe vehicle is not a combination vehicle (power unit and towed unit), and\n\nthe vehicle does not carry any hazardous materials that are required to be placarded.\n\nas a private motor carrier of passengers for non-business purposes, or\n\nto transport migrant workers (CDL holder must be age 21 or older), or\n\nyou obtained your NYS CDL prior to September 9, 1999, and perform \"Non-Excepted\" commercial operation (except when transporting hazardous materials) in New York State only. If this applies to you, you must certify to Excepted Intrastate (EA).\n\nNon-Excepted Interstate (NI) or Non-Excepted Intrastate (NA) Commerce\n\nIf you operate a CMV for any other purposes besides these, you are engaged in Non-Excepted commerce (NI or NA). You are required to provide a current USDOT Medical Examiner's Certificate.\n\nIf you operate in both Excepted commerce and Non-Excepted commerce, you must choose Non-Excepted to be qualified to operate in both types of commerce.\n\nIf you use your CDL or CLP for Non-Excepted commerce (NI or NA), you must get a USDOT physical performed by a medical examiner listed on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s (FMCSA) National Registry. To find an approved medical examiner, you can either go to the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiner Search or call FMCSA at (202) 366-4001 and ask to speak to a representative. Once your physical is complete, the medical examiner will give you a Medical Examiner's Certificate (Form MCSA-5876).\n\nWhen you apply for your CDL or CLP you must bring a photocopy of your Medical Certification with you. You must also send a photocopy of your new USDOT Medical Examiner's Certificate to the Medical Certification Unit before the certificate expires. Photocopied USDOT Medical Examiner's Certificate must be legible, complete and on one side of a standard 8½\" x 11\" sheet of paper.\n\nIf you have a Medical Variance, you must keep it current with the FMCSA.\n\nEmail\n\nPut your first and last name in the subject line. In the event that you need to confirm receipt of your e-mailed medical certificate, DMV will track it using the information in the subject line.\n\nFax\n\nMake a note of the fax number you are faxing from. In the event that you need to confirm receipt of your faxed medical certificate, DMV will track it using the fax number you faxed from.\n\nOnce your Medical Examiner’s Certificate on file expires, you are no longer certified to drive commercial vehicles. A notice advising you of your “not certified” medical status and impending license downgrade (56 days from the date of notice) will be sent to you. When we receive your new updated medical certificate, you will be recertified. If your CDL was downgraded because of your \"not certified\" medical status, you will need to visit a DMV office to upgrade your license back to a CDL. You should allow at least two weeks to process your updated documents.\n\nYou can check if your Medical Certification has been accepted by using \"My License Status, Renewal, and Replacement\" on MyDMV. Look under \"License Status\" to determine your self-certification driving type, medical certification status, and medical certificate expiration date.\n\nIf you are self-certified to driving types NI & NA, you will have a medical certification status of either \"Certified\" or \"Not Certified.\" If you are self-certified to EI or EA, you will have a medical certification status of \"Not Required\".\n\nIf your Medical Certification is sent back to you with a rejection letter it will indicate why the Medical Examiner’s Certificate is being returned to you. If information was incorrect, missing, or illegible, you must contact your physician to have the form amended or another form completed.\n\nIf your Medical Examiners Certificate was rejected because it was not completed by a doctor listed on the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners, you must have a new exam completed by a doctor on the registry. To find a certified doctor in your area please visit the Federal website at National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners Search."
