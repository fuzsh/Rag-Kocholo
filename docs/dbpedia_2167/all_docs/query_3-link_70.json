        "text": "Is Green Death Iowa's next breakout metal act?\n\nOn Dec. 4, the horror-infused thrash band from Des Moines took a step toward that feat by announcing a record deal with Ellefson Music Productions, an independent label founded and owned by Megadeth’s David Ellefson.\n\nThe long-time metal bassist launched the label earlier this year, with Green Death being the third artist to join the roster.\n\n“They are so in tune with the elements of classic thrash … but pushing the boundaries of metal forward in a really progressive way,” Ellefson said. “On top of that, they are great guys with an amazing work ethic.”\n\nThe deal happened in a matter of days, said Thom Hazaert, director of A&R and marketing for EMP.\n\n“It was just a good fit,” Hazaert said. “We saw from the beginning that it was a good fit.”\n\nGreen Death met Hazaert after Corey Taylor, Iowa native and frontman of renowned acts Slipknot and Stone Sour, invited the band to play at Slipknot’s re-occurring metal festival, Knotfest. This edition of the festival, held October 2015 in San Bernando, Calif., featured performances from Slipknot, Judas Priest, Bring Me The Horizon and more.\n\nErich Tran, lead guitarist of Green Death, said Taylor introduced the band to Hazaert backstage at the festival, where Hazaert was handed copy of the band’s second LP, “Manufacturing Evil.”\n\n“It’s not just because we’re friends,” Ryan Berrier, Green Death’s drummer, said. “(Corey) had to like our stuff, too … because he’s friends with a lot of people. He legitimately vouched for our material.”\n\nA mixture of good music and do-it-yourself work ethic proved to be the right formula for Green Death.\n\n“(Corey) saw that we were working hard, building the band, and he was nice enough to ask us to play Knotfest,” Tran said. “I think he respected the fact that, ‘Hey, these guys are doing it on their own.’”\n\nFrom meeting at Knotfest, Hazaert passed the music to Ellefson, who was on tour in India with Megadeth at the time. The band signed to EMP a few days later.\n\nBerrier said he sees Ellefson as someone who wants to see the band grow with the new label.\n\n“Signing a deal with someone who actually stands behind our product is pretty crazy,” Berrier said. “For that person to be David Ellefson is even more insane.”\n\nTran, guitarist Mark Reinking and and vocalist Sol Bales formed the band in 2012, releasing its debut LP, “The Deathening,” in 2013. Rounding out the lineup with Berrier and bassist Parker Willis, the group released its head-turning sophomore LP in April 2015. The week 1 sales for \"Manufacturing Evil\" topped the Amazon music charts in both the thrash and death metal categories.\n\nThe group’s carved a name for itself in Des Moines by appearing at Lazer 103.3’s annual rock festival, Lazerfest, and opening for national metal acts like Sebastian Bach, Trivium, Sevendust and more. The group even had a burger sold in its name at Zombie Burger.\n\nAnd now, the Green Death's backed by a staple name in the metal world … which Bales said is a feeling that hasn’t completely resonated.\n\n“When I was younger I played Megadeth stuff all the time,” Bales said. “I would sit in my room, playing Megadeth riffs. Just getting in touch with David Ellefson, I don’t think it’s really soaked in.”\n\nWhat’s next for Green Death? “Manufacturing Evil” is planned to be re-released worldwide under EMP this spring. A Des Moines show celebrating the re-release is in the planning process."
