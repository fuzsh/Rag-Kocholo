        "text": "ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- The University of Michigan ice hockey program has signed two more student-athletes to National Letters of Intent for the 1999-2000 season.\n\nForwards Mark Mink (Livonia, Mich.) and Jeff \"J.J.\" Swistak (West Bloomfield, Mich.) have both committed to play for the Wolverines beginning in the fall of 1999. Both are currently teammates -- along with John Shouneyia (Bloomfield Hills, Mich.), who committed to Michigan last fall -- on the North American Hockey League's Compuware Ambassadors.\n\n\"We have had success in the past with players from Compuware -- Dale Rominski, Bobby Hayes and Dave Huntzicker,\" said assistant coach Mel Pearson. \"Based on that experience, we think these three will be a key to the future. \"They have enjoyed much success at Compuware and are very comfortable with each other because they have played together for several years.\n\n\"Both Mink and Swistak are solid students and are very excited about the academic and athletic combination at Michigan.\n\n\"It is also important to note they are excited to come here as a group. Sometimes it is a deterrent because each wants to go his own direction, but these guys really want to continue to play together and be a part of Michigan Hockey.\"\n\nMink, a 5-11, 175-pound forward, is currently second in scoring (behind Shouneyia) for the Compuware Ambassadors, with 30-32-62 in 53 games. Mink is a proven scorer as his 30 goals lead the team this season and his 62 points are tied for eighth in the North American Hockey League scoring race.\n\n\"Mark Mink will add scoring to our lineup,\" said Pearson. \"He has been a solid scorer at every level he has played. As he grows bigger and stronger, we are confident he will develop into a very good player. He is a good kid who wanted to play for Michigan and is very excited to play here.\"\n\nSwistak, a 5-8, 175-pound forward, will add depth as a defensive forward. He is currently Compuware's eighth-leading scorer, with 19-17-36 in 52 games.\n\n\"Swistak is a very good defensive player who can also score,\" said Pearson. \"He brings a solid work ethic to the program and is a very tough, hard-nosed player.\"\n\nMink and Swistak round out a solid recruiting class which includes defenseman Matt Bannon (Toronto, Ontario), forward Mike Cammalleri (Richmond Hill, Ontario), forward Andy Hilbert (Howell, Mich.), forward John Shouneyia (Bloomfield Hills, Mich.) and forward Jed Ortmeyer (Omaha, Neb.), who have all committed to play for the Wolverines beginning in the fall of 1999.\n\nMichigan finished the season with a 25-11-6 record (17-8-5 in the CCHA) and ranked ninth in the country. The Wolverines advanced to the NCAA Ice Hockey Tournament for the ninth consecutive year, the longest active streak in the nation.\n\nMichigan's 1999-2000 Ice Hockey Freshman Class\n\nName Pos. &nbsp;Ht.&nbsp; &nbsp; Wt. &nbsp; Birthdate Hometown Matt Bannon D 5-10 185 1-16-81 Toronto, Ontario Mike Cammalleri F 5-9 180 6-8-82 Richmond Hill, Ontario Andy Hilbert F 5-11 184 2-6-81 Howell, Mich.
