        "text": "Landsat 7 was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on April 15, 1999 on a Delta II rocket. The satellite carries the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor. This instrument was improved from previous instrumentation designs. The primary features on Landsat 7 include a panchromatic band with 15 meter spatial resolution, an onboard full aperture solar calibrator, five percent absolute radiometric calibration, and a thermal infrared channel with a four-fold improvement in spatial resolution over Thematic Mapper (TM). Since June 2003, the sensor has acquired and delivered data with data gaps caused by the Scan Line Corrector (SLC) failure.\n\nIn October 2008, USGS made all Landsat 7 data free to the global public; data downloads increased sixty-fold. About four months later, all Landsat data was made available at no cost.\n\nIn recognition of the 30th anniversary of the Landsat program in 2002, staff at USGS EROS selected some Landsat images to undergo creative enhancements. Forty of the most inspiring, beautiful satellite images were selected to be displayed in the online Earth as Art gallery. Several sets were framed and displayed in federal venues across the nation, including the underground hallways that connect the House and Senate office buildings in Washington, D.C. A part of the collection adorns the Mary W. Jackson NASA Headquarters’ walls, an honor usually reserved for manned spaceflight mission photos or Hubble Space Telescope images. There are now six Earth as Art Galleries available on the EROS website.\n\nLandsat 7 Scan Line Corrector (SLC) Failure\n\nOn May 31, 2003, the Scan Line Corrector (SLC), which compensates for the forward motion of the satellite, failed. Subsequent efforts to recover the SLC were not successful, and the failure is permanent. Without an operating SLC, the sensor’s line of sight traces a zig-zag pattern along the satellite ground track.\n\nAs a result, the imaged area is duplicated, with a width that increases toward the edge of the scene. When the Level-1 data are processed, the duplicated areas are removed, leaving data gaps. Even though there is some data lose, 78 percent of the pixels still remain after the duplicated areas are removed, these data are still some of the most geometrically and radiometrically accurate of all civilian satellite data in the world.\n\nBand-specific gap mask files are included with every Landsat 7 Scan Line Corrector (SLC)-off Level-1 data product. These ancillary data identify the location of all pixels affected by the original data gaps in the primary SLC-off scene. This webpage provides more details about these files: What are Landsat 7 SLC-off Gap Mask files.\n\nSources/Usage: Public Domain. View Media Details\n\nA number of papers were written about the Landsat 7 Scan Line Corrector:\n\nPreliminary Assessment of the Value of Landsat 7 ETM+ Data Following Scan-Line Correction Malfunction. ( A summary of analysis done by the 1996-2001 Landsat Science Team)\n\nLandsat 7 Scan Line Corrector Processing Algorithm Theoretical Basis\n\nLandsat 7 SLC Gap-Filled Products Phase One Methodology\n\nLandsat 7 SLC-off Gap-Filled Products Phase Two Methodology\n\nEvaluation of L7 Gap-filled SLC-OFF Imagery for Burn Severity Mapping\n\nLandsat 7 End of Mission Activities\n\nFinal Inclination Maneuver: February 7, 2017\n\nOn February 7, 2017, the twentieth and final inclination (Delta-I) maneuver of Landsat 7 took place. (Delta-I maneuvers keep the spacecraft in the correct orbital position to ensure it maintains its 10:00 am ± 15 minutes mean local time (MLT) equatorial crossing.) Landsat 7 reached its peak outermost inclination boundary of 10:14:58 MLT on August 11, 2017. The chart below illustrates the inclination trend from June 2014 to June 2026. By the end of 2021, the satellite had a MLT of 9:00 am. This 2021 publication describes the research conducted into the science capability of Landsat 7 ETM+ data, while the satellite is drifting in orbit.\n\nNominal Science Mission Ends: April 6, 2022\n\nOn April 6, 2022, the ETM+ sensor was placed into “stand-by” mode as a series of spacecraft burns were performed throughout the month of April to lower the satellite’s orbit by 8 kilometers (see illustration below). After entering the lower orbit, the Landsat 7 satellite will be available for servicing by NASA's On-Orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing-1 (OSAM-1) mission. OSAM-1 will provide Landsat 7 with the needed fuel for a successful decommissioning.\n\nLandsat 7 Extended Science Mission: May 5, 2022 - January 19, 2024\n\nLandsat 7 imaging resumed on May 5, 2022, at a lower orbit of 697 km after a series of maneuvers in early April lowered the satellite out of the standard 705km WRS-2 orbit. The USGS elected to continue science data acquisition from the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) to assess the utility of imagery collected at the new lower orbit and earlier equatorial crossing time.\n\nSince being lowered in orbit, the satellite has continued to drift within its orbit, exposing it to periods of full sunlight and earlier imaging times, impacting imaging opportunities and the ability to process valid science data. In January 2024, the satellite’s moved into full sunlight, which causes issues with the batteries. To retain the health and safety of the batteries, science imaging was suspended on January 19, 2024.\n\nThe Landsat 7 Extended Science Mission webpage describes the properties of the data, and activities done by Calibration/Validation and science teams to ensure the quality of the data remains nominal.\n\nNote: The Product Identifier for each scene contains the acquisition date, so Landsat 7 scenes collected at the lower orbit can be identified by searching for Landsat 7 data acquired May 4, 2022 - January 19, 2024.\n\nLandsat 7 Data User's Handbook"
