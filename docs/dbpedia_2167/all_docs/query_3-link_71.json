        "text": "Full-throated musical confrontation with human aberrations, broken friendships and volatilized ideals isn’t a privilege of youth.\n\nFarewell Signs, a five-piece hardcore outfit from Southern Germany, show exactly that. Their songs deal with loss, saying goodbye and the derived perception of arbitrary coexistence.\n\nA group of friends, previously active in bands like Driving The Salt, Red Tape Parade or Bridges Left Burning, whose musical paths have crossed again after many years. Driven by the urge to create an outlet for these negative emotions by forging a contemporary blend of hardcore and punk, mixed with a decent dose of rock and metal, that is still as relevant as in their youth.\n\nDefying the challenges of adult life and thereby refusing to let those supersede creativity, the anger of youth and the desire to speak out, they prove that growing up does not equal growing old.\n\nFarewell Signs are here to be the stronghold of what they grew up believing in and still do. Punk and Hardcore and the set of ideals that come along with it don’t have an expiration date. There is no time to resign.\n\nWhether it is family, friendships and companions or ideals: Life is loss but there is beauty in resilience."
