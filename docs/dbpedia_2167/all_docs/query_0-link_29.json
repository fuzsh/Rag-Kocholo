        "text": "Disease Overview\n\nTay-Sachs disease is a rare, neurodegenerative disorder in which deficiency of an enzyme (hexosaminidase A) results in excessive accumulation of certain fats (lipids) known as gangliosides in the brain and nerve cells. This abnormal accumulation of gangliosides leads to progressive dysfunction of the central nervous system. Tay-Sachs disease is categorized as a lysosomal storage disease. Lysosomes are the major digestive units in cells. Enzymes within lysosomes break down or “digest” nutrients, including certain complex carbohydrates and fats (like glycosphingolipids). When one of these lysosomal enzymes (such as hexosaminidase A) is missing or ineffective, glycosphingolipids start to build up in the lysosome. If there is too much accumulation of these materials in the lysosome, the cells in the nervous system degenerate and die, triggering an inflammatory response that amplifies damage in surrounding tissue.\n\nThe most common form of Tay-Sachs disease is the Infantile form, which can present around 6 months of age as reduced vision and an exaggerated startle response and eventually progress to a gradual loss of skills and seizures by age 2 and early death, usually by the age of 5. There is also a juvenile version of the disease beginning at about the age of 5 years of age and adult forms of Tay-Sachs disease also known as late-onset Tay Sachs disease (LOTS) beginning in the late teens and beyond. All three forms of Tay-Sachs disease are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and the age of onset is a function of the amount, if any, of residual enzyme activity.\n\nView Full Report Show Less\n\nPrint / Download as PDF\n\nNext section >\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\nSynonyms\n\nHEXA deficiency\n\nhexosaminidase A deficiency\n\nTSD\n\nGM2 gangliosidosis, type 1\n\nhexoaminidase alpha-subunit deficiency (variant B)\n\nB variant GM2 gangliosidosis\n\nsphingolipidosis, Tay-Sachs\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\nSubdivisions\n\ninfantile Tay-Sachs disease\n\njuvenile (subacute) Tay-Sachs disease\n\nlate-onset Tay-Sachs disease\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\nSigns & Symptoms\n\nInfantile Tay-Sachs Disease\n\nThe infantile form of Tay-Sachs disease is characterized by complete or almost complete lack of hexosaminidase A enzyme activity. The disorder often progresses rapidly, resulting in significant cognitive and physical deterioration.\n\nInfants may appear completely unaffected at birth. Initial symptoms, which usually develop between 3 and 6 months, can include mild muscle weakness, twitching or jerking of muscles (myoclonic jerks) and an exaggerated startle response, such as when there is a sudden or unexpected noise. The startle response may be partly due to an increased sensitivity to sound (acoustic hypersensitivity).\n\nBetween six and 10 months, affected infants may fail to gain new motor skills. They may no longer make eye contact and there may be unusual eye movements. They may be listlessness and irritable. As affected infants age, they may experience slow growth, progressive muscle weakness and diminished muscle tone (hypotonia). Affected infants may also exhibit gradual loss of vision, involuntary muscle spasms (myoclonus), slow, stiff movements (spasticity) and the loss of previously acquired skills (i.e., psychomotor regression) such as crawling or sitting up.\n\nA characteristic symptom of Tay-Sachs disease is the development of a macular “cherry red” spot. This ophthalmological finding emerges from abnormal accumulation of pale undigested material in the macula which contrasts to the thin foveal transparent background exposing the normal rich choroidal vasculature. This characteristic finding occurs is approximately 90% of individuals with infantile Tay-Sachs disease.\n\nAs affected infants age, more serious complications may develop including seizures, difficulty swallowing, loss of vision, paralysis and progressive hearing loss. Additional cognitive deficits may include confusion, disorientation and/or deterioration of intellectual abilities. Eventually, infants may become unresponsive to their environment and surroundings. By three to five years of age, life-threatening complications begin to occur such as aspiration pneumonia leading to respiratory failure.\n\nJuvenile (Subacute) Tay-Sachs Disease\n\nThe onset of juvenile Tay-Sachs disease can be anywhere between 2 and 10 years of age. One of the first signs is often clumsiness and incoordination. This occurs because affected children have issues controlling their body’s movements (ataxia). Children tend to experience a progressive loss of speech, life skills and intellectual abilities. Affected individuals may or may not develop a cherry-red spot in the eyes. Degeneration of the optic nerves (optic atrophy) may occur. Some children may have retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive loss and degeneration of the cells in the retina where shapes and colors are first encoded. Affected children become less responsive to their environment and surroundings. Life-threatening complications usually occur around 15 years of age.\n\nLate-Onset Tay-Sachs Disease\n\nThe presentation and symptoms associated with late-onset Tay-Sachs disease vary greatly. Onset of the disease may vary from the late teens to any time in adulthood. This variability may occur even within affected members of the same family. For example, in a given family one person may have symptoms in their 20s, while another reaches into their 60s or 70s with relatively milder minor symptoms. The disorder progresses much slower than the infantile or juvenile forms of the disease.\n\nInitial symptoms associated with late-onset Tay-Sachs disease may include progressive muscle weakness and wasting (neurogenic atrophy), incoordination and clumsiness from cerebellar dysfunction (ataxia) or acute psychiatric presentation. As affected individuals age, muscle twitching (fasciculation), cramps, weakness and muscle wasting progresses affecting preferentially the quadriceps and hip flexor muscles, and later, the triceps muscles. Patients need to lock their knees in hyperextension to be able to stand and support their weight. Failure to do so results in falls and eventually leads to the need for a device to assist with walking. Patients may exhibit tremors and progressive slurred speech (dysarthria). Difficulties swallowing (dysphagia) may emerge late in the disease. Some affected individuals experience acute psychiatric manifestations (mania, acute depression or psychosis) that may require emergency psychiatric care. Over time, cognitive difficulties including executive dysfunction and some memory difficulties might emerge.\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\nCauses\n\nTay-Sachs disease is caused by a change (mutation) in the hexosaminidase subunit alpha (HEXA) gene. Genes provide the instructions for the basic structure of proteins, all of which that play a critical role in many functions and structure of the body. When a mutation occurs in a gene, the protein product may be faulty, inefficient or absent. Depending upon the functions of the protein, this can affect many organ systems of the body, including the brain.\n\nThe HEXA gene encodes the structure of the protein HEXA which is a subunit of the enzyme hexosaminidase A. More than 80 different mutations of the HEXA gene have been identified in individuals with the disease. Inheriting two mutated copies of the HEXA gene (homozygotes) causes deficiency of the hexosaminidase A enzyme, which is necessary to breakdown GM2-ganglioside (a glycosphingolipids) within cells of the body. Failure to breakdown GM2-ganglioside results in its abnormal accumulation in brain and nerve cells eventually resulting in the progressive deterioration of the central nervous system.\n\nIn infantile Tay-Sachs disease, there is a complete lack of hexosaminidase A. In juvenile and late-onset Tay-Sachs disease, there minimal but still some residual hexosaminidase A enzyme activity which explains why these disorders might be less severe and progress at a slower pace than infantile Tay-Sachs disease.\n\nTay-Sachs disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive disease. Recessive genetic disorders occur when an individual inherits two copies of an abnormal gene, one from each parent. If an individual inherits one normal copy of the gene from one parent and an abnormal (mutated) copy of the gene from the other parent, that person will be a carrier for the disease but will not develop the disease. The risk for two carrier parents to both pass the altered gene and have an affected child is 25% with each pregnancy. The risk to have a child who is a carrier like the parents is 50% with each pregnancy. The chance for a child to receive the normal genes from each parent is 25%. The risk is the same for males and females.\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\nAffected populations\n\nTay-Sachs disease affects males and females in equal numbers. Tay-Sachs disease used to be considered a prototypical disease of Jewish people of Ashkenazi descent. Community counselling and carrier screening efforts in these communities have succeeded in reducing disease prevalence to figures roughly equivalent to those of non-Jewish populations. Increased prevalence of Tay Sachs disease is also reported in other ethnic groups including those living in the Cajun community of Louisiana and southeastern Quebec. In the general population, the carrier rate for Tay-Sacks disease is approximately 1 in 250-300 people.\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\nDisorders with Similar Symptoms\n\nSymptoms of the following disorders can share similarities to those of Tay-Sachs disease. Comparisons may be useful for a differential diagnosis:\n\nSandhoff disease is closely related and shares many clinical and biochemical features to Tay-Sachs. Like Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease affects the function of the enzyme Hexosaminidase A. It does so by disruption of the beta subunit (HEXB subunit) of hexosaminidase A encoded by the gene HEXB. Like Tay-Sachs, Sandhoff disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. (For more information on this disorder, choose “Sandhoff” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)\n\nLeigh syndrome is a rare genetic neurometabolic disorder. It is characterized by the degeneration of the central nervous system. The symptoms of Leigh syndrome usually begin between the ages of three months and two years, but some patients do not exhibit signs and symptoms until several years later. Symptoms are associated with progressive or stepwise neurological deterioration and may include loss of previously acquired motor skills, loss of appetite, vomiting, irritability and/or seizure activity. As Leigh syndrome progresses, symptoms may also include generalized weakness, lack of muscle tone (hypotonia) and episodes of lactic acidosis, which may lead to impairment of respiratory and kidney function. Several different genetically determined enzyme defects can cause the syndrome. Most individuals with Leigh syndrome have defects of mitochondrial energy production, such as deficiency of proteins of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex or the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. In most people, Leigh syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive disease. However, X-linked recessive inheritance and inheritance from the mother via a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation are also possible. (For more information on this disorder, choose “Leigh” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)\n\nThe neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of progressive degenerative neurometabolic diseases. These diseases share certain similar symptoms and are distinguished in part by the age at which such symptoms appear. Two forms occur during infancy: classic infantile CLN1 disease (Santavuori disease) and CLN2 disease (late infantile type). The NCLs are characterized by abnormal accumulation of certain fatty, granular substances such as ceroid and lipofuscin within nerve cells (neurons) of the brain as well as other tissues of the body that may result in progressive deterioration (atrophy) of certain areas of the brain, neurological impairment and other characteristic symptoms and physical findings. (For more information, choose the specific disorder name as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)\n\nThere are many other lysosomal storage diseases that can share symptoms like those seen in Tay-Sachs disease. Lysosomal storage diseases are inherited metabolic diseases that are characterized by an abnormal build-up of various materials inside lysosomes as a result of deficiencies in enzymes involved in the degradation of large molecules. These disorders may affect different parts of the body, including the skeleton, brain, skin, heart. liver, spleen and peripheral nervous system. (For more information on this disorder, choose “lysosomal” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)\n\nSymptoms of the following disorders can be similar to those of Late-onset Tay-Sachs disease. Comparisons may be useful for a differential diagnosis:\n\nMilder or late -onset forms of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) shares may similarities with the neuromuscular presentation of adult of late-onset Tay-Sachs disease. SMA results in progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in the spinal cord and leads to muscle weakness, fasciculations and muscle wasting. SMA is typically due to deletions or mutations of the gene SMN1 and its severity is modified by the number of copies of the related gene SMN2. (For more information on this disorder, choose “Spinal Muscular Atrophy” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by progressive muscle weakness, resulting degeneration of the upper (motor cortex) and lower (spinal cord) motor neurons. Muscle wasting and spasticity are common. Weakness in the arms and hands results in loss of dexterity and weakness in legs may lead to incapacity to ambulate and falling. ALS may also involve swallowing (dysphagia), weakness of the tongue, vocal cords, and diaphragm and can cause speech and respiratory difficulties. As weakness progresses patients are at increased risk for respiratory complications. There are familial and sporadic forms of ALS. (For more information on this disorder, choose “Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)\n\nProgressive hereditary spinal cerebellar degenerations represent a large group of inherited disorders characterized by cerebellar deficits including incoordination, ataxia tremor and dysarthria along with combination of dysfunction of various spinal tracts. Their presentation may not be unlike those of patients with cerebellar dysfunction in the context of adult or late-onset Tay Sachs disease.\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\nDiagnosis\n\nThe diagnosis of Tay-Sachs disease may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation and specialized tests such as blood tests that measure the enzyme activity levels of hexosaminidase A. Molecular genetic testing for mutations in the HEXA gene can confirm a diagnosis of Tay-Sachs disease. With the advent of more widely available gene panels and exome and whole genome sequencing, more patients are initially diagnosed by molecular testing followed by enzymatic confirmation.\n\nIt is possible that a diagnosis of Tay-Sachs disease may be suspected before birth (prenatally) based upon specialized tests, such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). During amniocentesis, a sample of fluid that surrounds the developing fetus is removed, while CVS involves the removal of tissue samples from a portion of the placenta. These samples are studied to determine hexosaminidase A activity. Absence or greatly reduced activity suggests a diagnosis. Prenatal diagnosis is also possible through molecular genetic testing of tissue samples obtained through CVS or amniocentesis, particularly if the disease-causing mutation(s) in the HEXA gene are known in the family.\n\nCarrier testing for Tay-Sachs disease can be accomplished from a blood sample and determines whether an individual carries one disease-causing copy of the HEXA gene. Relatives of individuals with Tay-Sachs disease can be tested to determine whether they are carriers. Couples who are planning to have a child and have any Jewish ancestry (not just Ashkenazi) are encouraged to undergo carrier screening before proceeding with a pregnancy.\n\nFor couples that find that they are carriers, there are several options available for starting a family. These options include assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and adoption. Couples are encouraged to consult with a genetic counselor to discuss these options.\n\nGenetic counseling is available to assist families in testing decisions, interpreting test results and understanding health insurance coverage. Families are strongly encouraged to seek out a genetic counselor, particularly before carrier screening, to be most informed when making genetics healthcare decisions.

Treatment is directed toward the individual symptom management. Treatment may require the coordinated efforts of a team of specialists. Pediatricians, neurologists, speech pathologists, specialists who assess and treat hearing problems (audiologists), eye specialists and other health care professionals may need to collaborate to develop a plan for an affected child’s treatment.\n\nBecause of the potential for feeding difficulties, infants should be monitored for nutritional status and proper hydration. Nutritional support and supplementation may be necessary. Occasionally, the insertion of a feeding tube may be required to help prevent food, liquid or other foreign material from accidently going into the lungs (aspiration).\n\nAnticonvulsants may be used to treat seizures in some people with Tay-Sachs disease, but may not be effective in all people. The types and frequency of seizures can change over time in some individuals which will require a change in medication type or dosage.\n\nGenetic counseling is recommended for affected individuals and their families. Psychosocial support is recommended for the entire family.\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\nClinical Trials and Studies\n\nEnzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been considered and developed for lysosomal storage disorders. In Tay-Sachs disease, enzyme replacement therapy involves replacing a missing or deficient hexosaminidate A. An inability to find a way for the deliver the replacement enzyme (a large molecule) to cross the blood-brain barrier limits this strategy.\n\nChaperone therapy is also being studied for the therapy of Tay-Sachs disease. This type of therapy involves very small molecules called chaperones that attach to newly synthetized hexosaminidase A enzymes. This approach seeks to protect degradation of the abnormal hexosaminidase A inside the cells before it is degraded, thus allowing the hexosaminidase A, albeit deficient, to exert its activity for a longer time-period. A chaperone called pyrimethamine has been studied as a treatment for Tay-Sachs disease. Affected individuals who took the medication showed increased activity of hexosaminidase A. However, increased activity did not lead to any noticeable improvement in symptoms and was accompanied by undesirable side effects.\n\nSubstrate reduction therapy for Tay-Sachs disease seeks to decrease the overall burden of substrate (ganglioside) that needs degradation by reducing its synthesis. In the case Tay-Sachs, substrate reduction requires some degree of penetration into the central nervous system across the blood-brain barrier as the burden of disease is in the brain and spinal cord. Such strategy is currently under clinical investigation. [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04221451]\n\nGene therapy is also being studied as another possible approach to therapy for some lysosomal storage disorders. In gene therapy, the defective gene present in a patient is replaced with a normal gene to enable the production of active enzyme and prevent the development and progression of the disease. Given the permanent transfer of the normal gene, which can produce active enzyme at all sites of disease, this form of therapy is theoretically most likely to lead to a “cure.” The Tay-Sachs Gene Therapy (TSGT) Consortium is a collaborative group of scientists seeking to translate information from animal model studies into clinical trials.\n\nInformation on current clinical trials is posted on the Internet at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
