        "text": "WADA was formed in 1999, following a major doping scandal that shook the world of cycling in 1998.\n\nIn February 1999, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) convened the First World Conference on Doping in Sport, in Lausanne, Switzerland, which brought together all parties involved in the fight against doping. The Conference resulted in the Lausanne Declaration on Doping in Sport â€“ a document that provided for the creation of an independent international anti-doping agency to be operational for the XXVII Olympiad that were to be held in Sydney, Australia in 2000.\n\nWADA was established on 10 November 1999 to protect athletes, promote the values of clean sport, and preserve the spirit of sport internationally. WADA was set up as a foundation under the initiative of the IOC with the support and participation of intergovernmental organizations, governments, public authorities, and other public and private bodies fighting doping in sport. To this day, the Agency is composed and funded by the sport movement and governments of the world."
