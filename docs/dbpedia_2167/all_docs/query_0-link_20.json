        "text": "Are you an older adult with depression?\n\nHave you lost interest in the activities you used to enjoy? Do you struggle with feelings of helplessness and hopelessness? Are you finding it harder and harder to get through the day? If so, you’re not alone. Depression can happen to any of us as we age, regardless of our background or achievements. And the symptoms of elderly depression can affect every aspect of your life, impacting your energy, appetite, sleep, and interest in work, hobbies, and relationships.\n\nUnfortunately, all too many depressed older adults fail to recognize the symptoms of depression, or don’t take the steps to get the help they need. There are many reasons why elderly depression is so often overlooked:\n\nYou may assume you have good reason to be down or that depression is just part of aging.\n\nYou may be isolated—which in itself can lead to depression—with few around to notice your distress.\n\nYou may not realize that your physical complaints are signs of depression.\n\nYou may be reluctant to talk about your feelings or ask for help.\n\nIt’s important to realize that depression isn’t an inevitable part of getting older—nor is it a sign of weakness or a character flaw. It can happen to anyone, at any age, no matter your background or your previous accomplishments in life. While life’s changes as you age—such as retirement, the death of loved ones, declining health—can sometimes trigger depression, they don’t have to keep you down. No matter what challenges you face as you age, there are steps you can take to feel happy and hopeful once again and enjoy your golden years.\n\nSigns and symptoms of depression in older adults\n\nRecognizing depression in the elderly starts with knowing the signs and symptoms. Depression red flags include:\n\nSadness or feelings of despair.\n\nUnexplained or aggravated aches and pains.\n\nLoss of interest in socializing or hobbies.\n\nWeight loss or loss of appetite.\n\nFeelings of hopelessness or helplessness.\n\nLack of motivation and energy.\n\nSleep disturbances (difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, oversleeping, or daytime sleepiness).\n\nLoss of self-worth (worries about being a burden, feelings of worthlessness or self-loathing).\n\nSlowed movement or speech.\n\nIncreased use of alcohol or other drugs.\n\nFixation on death; thoughts of suicide.\n\nMemory problems.\n\nNeglecting personal care (skipping meals, forgetting meds, neglecting personal hygiene).\n\nDepressed older adults may not feel “sad”\n\nWhile depression and sadness might seem to go hand and hand, many depressed seniors claim not to feel sad at all. They may complain, instead, of low motivation, a lack of energy, or physical problems. In fact, physical complaints, such as arthritis pain or worsening headaches, are often the predominant symptom of depression in the elderly.\n\nIs it grief or depression?\n\nAs we age, we experience many losses. Loss is painful—whether it’s a loss of independence, mobility, health, your long-time career, or someone you love. Grieving over these losses is normal and healthy, even if the feelings of sadness last for a long time.\n\nDistinguishing between grief and clinical depression isn’t always easy, since they share many symptoms. However, there are ways to tell the difference.\n\nGrief is a roller coaster involving a wide variety of emotions and a mix of good and bad days. Even when you’re grieving, you’ll still have moments of pleasure or happiness.\n\nWith depression, on the other hand, the feelings of emptiness and despair are constant.\n\nWhile there’s no set timetable for grieving, if it doesn’t let up over time or extinguishes all signs of joy—laughing at a good joke, brightening in response to a hug, appreciating a beautiful sunset—it may be depression.\n\nCauses of depression in older adults\n\nAs we grow older, we often face significant life changes that can increase the risk for depression. These can include:\n\nHealth problems. Illness and disability, chronic or severe pain, cognitive decline, damage to your body image due to surgery or sickness can all be contributors to depression.\n\nLoneliness and isolation. Factors such as living alone, a dwindling social circle due to deaths or relocation, decreased mobility due to illness or a loss of driving privileges can trigger depression.\n\nReduced sense of purpose. Retirement can bring with it a loss of identity, status, self-confidence, and financial security and increase the risk of depression. Physical limitations on activities you used to enjoy can also impact your sense of purpose.\n\n[Read: Adjusting to Retirement: Handling the Stress and Anxiety]\n\nFears. These include a fear of death or dying as well as anxiety over financial problems, health issues, or abuse or neglect.\n\nRecent bereavements. The death of friends, family members, and pets, or the loss of a spouse or partner are common causes of depression in older adults.\n\nMedical conditions that can cause elderly depression\n\nIt’s important to be aware that medical problems can cause depression in older adults and the elderly, either directly or as a psychological reaction to the illness. Any chronic medical condition, particularly if it is painful, disabling, or life-threatening, can lead to depression or make your depression symptoms worse.\n\nThese include:\n\nParkinson’s disease\n\nStroke\n\nHeart disease\n\nCancer\n\nDiabetes\n\nThyroid disorders\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency\n\nDementia and Alzheimer’s disease\n\nLupus\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS)\n\nElderly depression as a side effect of medication\n\nSymptoms of depression can also occur as a side effect of many commonly prescribed drugs. You’re particularly at risk if you’re taking multiple medications. While the mood-related side effects of prescription medication can affect anyone, older adults are more sensitive because, as we age, our bodies become less efficient at metabolizing and processing drugs.\n\nIf you feel depressed after starting a new medication, talk to your doctor. You may be able to lower your dose or switch to another medication that doesn’t impact your mood.\n\nMedications that can cause or worsen depression include:\n\nBlood pressure medication (e.g. clonidine).\n\nBeta-blockers (e.g. Lopressor, Inderal).\n\nHigh-cholesterol drugs (e.g. Lipitor, Mevacor, Zocor).\n\nTranquilizers (e.g. Valium, Xanax, Halcion).\n\nCalcium-channel blockers.\n\nMedication for Parkinson’s disease.\n\nSleeping pills.\n\nUlcer medication (e.g. Zantac, Tagamet).\n\nHeart drugs containing reserpine.\n\nSteroids (e.g. cortisone and prednisone).\n\nPainkillers and arthritis drugs.\n\nEstrogens (e.g. Premarin, Prempro).\n\nAnticholinergic drugs used to treat GI disorders.\n\nDementia vs. depression\n\nNever assume that a loss of mental sharpness is just a normal sign of old age. It could be a sign of either depression or dementia, both of which are common in older adults. Depression and dementia share many similar symptoms, including memory problems, sluggish speech and movements, and low motivation, so it can be difficult to tell the two apart.\n\nIs it Depression or Dementia?\n\nWhether cognitive decline is caused by dementia or depression, it’s important to see a doctor right away. If it’s depression, memory, concentration, and energy will bounce back with treatment. Treatment for dementia will also improve your quality of life. And in some types of dementia, symptoms can be reversed, halted, or slowed.\n\nSelf-help for elderly depression\n\nIt’s a myth to think that after a certain age older adults can’t learn new skills, try new activities, or make fresh lifestyle changes. The truth is that the human brain never stops changing, so as an older adult, you’re just as capable as a young person of learning new things and adapting to new ideas that can help you recover from depression.\n\nOvercoming depression involves finding new things you enjoy, learning to adapt to change, staying physically and socially active, and feeling connected to your community and loved ones.\n\nOf course, when you’re depressed, taking action and putting self-help steps into action can be hard. Sometimes, just thinking about the things you should do to feel better can seem overwhelming. But small steps can make a big difference to how you feel. Taking a short walk, for example, is something you can do right now—and it can boost your mood for the next two hours. By taking small steps day by day, your depression symptoms will ease and you’ll find yourself feeling more energetic and hopeful again.\n\nSelf-help tip 1: Reach out and stay connected\n\nIf you’re depressed, you may not want to do anything or see anybody. But isolation only makes depression worse. On your own, it can be difficult to maintain perspective and sustain the effort required to beat depression. That’s why support matters—so make an effort to connect to others and limit the time you’re alone. If you can’t get out to socialize, invite loved ones to visit you, or keep in touch over the phone or email.\n\nBut remember: digital communication isn’t a replacement for face-to-face contact. Do your best to see people in person on a daily basis. Your mood will thank you! And remember, it’s never too late to build new friendships.\n\nGet out in to the world. Try not to stay cooped up at home all day. Go to the park, take a trip to the hairdresser, have lunch with a friend, visit a museum, or go to a concert or a play.\n\nVolunteer your time. Helping others is one of the best ways to feel better about yourself and expand your social network.\n\nJoin a depression support group. Being with others facing the same problems can help reduce your sense of isolation. It can also be inspiring to hear how others cope with depression.\n\nTake care of a pet. A pet can keep you company, and walking a dog, for example, can be good exercise for you and a great way to meet people. Dog owners love to chat while their pets play together.\n\nTake a class or join a club to meet like-minded people. Try joining a senior center, a book club, or another group of people with similar interests.\n\nCreate opportunities to laugh. Laughter provides a mood boost, so swap humorous stories and jokes with your loved ones, watch a comedy, or read a funny book.\n\nTip 2: Find meaning and purpose in life\n\nTo overcome depression—and stop it coming back—it’s important to continue to feel engaged and enjoy a strong purpose in life. As we age, life changes and you can lose things that previously occupied your time and gave life its meaning. Retirement, the loss of close friends or loved ones, relocating away from your social network, and changes in your physical health, finances, or status can impact your mood, confidence, and sense of self-worth. But there are still plenty of ways you can find new meaning in life and continue to feel engaged in the world. Sometimes it’s just a matter of reframing how you think of yourself or the aging process.\n\nFocus on what you can still do, not what you used to be able to do. Maybe you feel frustrated that you’re not able to do everything you once could, or at least not to the same levels? Or perhaps negative ideas about growing older have dented your self-confidence? Instead of focusing on what you once did, try focusing on the things you can do. You’ll see just how much you still have to offer.\n\nLearn a new skill. Pick something that you’ve always wanted to learn, or that sparks your imagination and creativity—a musical instrument, a foreign language, or a new game or sport, for example. Learning new activities not only adds meaning and joy to life, but can also help to maintain your brain health and prevent mental decline.\n\nGet involved in your community. Try attending a local event, tutoring kids, or volunteering for a cause that’s important to you. Community work can be a great way of utilizing and passing on the skills you honed in your career—without the commitment or stress of regular employment.\n\nTake pride in your appearance. When you retire, it’s easy to let yourself go a little now you don’t have to be at work every day. But putting effort into how you look each morning can give your self-confidence a welcome boost and improve how you feel.\n\nTravel. Once you’re retired and your kids have left home, you likely have more time on your hands to visit the places you’ve always wanted to go. Book a vacation to somewhere new or take a weekend trip to a favorite place. Travel doesn’t have to be extravagant or expensive to boost your mood. Enjoy time in nature by taking a scenic walk or hike, going fishing or camping, or spending a day at the beach.\n\nWrite your memoirs, learn to paint, or take up a new craft.\n\nEveryone has different idea about what brings meaning and purpose to life. The important thing is to find activities that are both meaningful and enjoyable for you. The more you nourish your spirit, the better you’ll feel.\n\nTip 3: Adopt healthy habits\n\nWhen you’re depressed, it can be hard to find the motivation to do anything—let alone look after your health. But your health habits have an impact on depression symptoms. The better care you take of your body, the better you’ll feel.\n\nMove your body\n\nExercise is a powerful depression treatment. In fact, research suggests it can be just as effective as antidepressants. And you don’t have to suffer through a rigorous workout to reap the benefits. Take a short walk now and see how much better you feel. Anything that gets you up and moving helps. Look for small ways to add more movement to your day: park farther from the store, take the stairs, do light housework or gardening. It all adds up.\n\nEven if you’re ill, frail, or disabled, there are many safe exercises you can do to build your strength and boost your mood—even from a chair or wheelchair. Just listen to your body and back off if you’re in pain.\n\nEat to support your mood\n\nAdjusting your dietary habits as an older adult can help you deal with the symptoms of depression.\n\nStart by minimizing sugar and refined carbs. Sugary and starchy comfort foods can give you a quick boost, but you pay for it later when your blood sugar crashes.\n\nInstead, focus on quality protein, complex carbs, and healthy fats, which will leave you satisfied and emotionally balanced.\n\nGoing too long without eating can also worsen your mood, making you tired and irritable, so do your best to eat something at least every 3-4 hours.\n\nSupport quality sleep\n\nMany older adults struggle with sleep problems, particularly insomnia. But lack of sleep makes depression worse. Aim for somewhere between 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. You can help yourself get better quality sleep by avoiding alcohol and caffeine, keeping a regular sleep-wake schedule, and making sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.\n\nSpend time in sunlight\n\nSunlight can help boost serotonin levels, improve your mood, and cope with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Whenever possible, get outside during daylight hours and expose yourself to the sun for at least 15 minutes a day.\n\nHave your coffee outside or by a window, enjoy an al fresco meal, or spend time gardening.\n\nExercise outside by hiking, walking in a local park, or playing golf with a friend.\n\nIf you live somewhere with little winter sunshine, try using a light therapy box.\n\nAlcohol and depression in older adults\n\nIt can be tempting to use alcohol to deal with physical and emotional pain. It may help you take your mind off an illness, feel less lonely, or get to sleep. But alcohol makes symptoms of depression and anxiety worse over the long run. It also impairs brain function and interacts in negative ways with numerous medications, including antidepressants. And while drinking may help you nod off, it also keeps you from getting the refreshing deep sleep you need.\n\nTip 4: Know when to seek professional help\n\nDepression treatment is just as effective for older adults as it is for younger people. However, since depression in the elderly is often triggered or compounded by a difficult life situation or challenge, any treatment plan should address that issue, too. If loneliness is at the root of your depression, for example, medication alone is not going to cure the problem.\n\nAntidepressant risk factors\n\nOlder adults are more sensitive to drug side effects and vulnerable to interactions with other medicines they’re taking. Studies have also found that SSRIs such as Prozac can cause rapid bone loss and a higher risk for fractures and falls. Because of these safety concerns, elderly adults on antidepressants should be carefully monitored.\n\nIn many cases, therapy and/or healthy lifestyle changes, such as exercise, can be as effective as antidepressants in relieving depression, without the dangerous side effects.\n\nCounseling and therapy\n\nTherapy works well on depression because it addresses the underlying causes of the depression, rather than just the symptoms.\n\nSupportive counseling includes religious and peer counseling. It can ease loneliness and the hopelessness of depression, and help you find new meaning and purpose.\n\nTherapy helps you work through stressful life changes, heal from losses, and process difficult emotions. It can also help you change negative thinking patterns and develop better coping skills.\n\nSupport groups for depression, illness, or bereavement connect you with others who are going through the same challenges. They are a safe place to share experiences, advice, and encouragement.\n\nHow to help an older adult with depression\n\nThe very nature of depression interferes with a person’s ability to seek help, draining energy and self-esteem. For depressed seniors, raised in a time when mental illness was highly stigmatized and misunderstood, it can be even more difficult—especially if they don’t believe depression is a real illness, are too proud or ashamed to ask for assistance, or fear becoming a burden to their families.\n\nIf an elderly person you care about is depressed, you can make a difference by offering emotional support. Listen to your loved one with patience and compassion. You don’t need to try to “fix” someone’s depression; just being there to listen is enough. Don’t criticize feelings expressed, but point out realities and offer hope. You can also help by seeing that your loved one gets an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Help your loved one find a good doctor, accompany them to appointments, and offer moral support. See How to Help Someone with Depression.\n\nOther tips for helping a depressed elderly loved one\n\nInvite your loved one out. Depression is less likely when people’s bodies and minds remain active. Suggest activities to do together that your loved one used to enjoy: walks, an art class, a trip to the movies—anything that provides mental or physical stimulation.\n\nSchedule regular social activities. Group outings, visits from friends and family members, or trips to the local senior or community center can help combat isolation and loneliness. Be gently insistent if your plans are refused: depressed people often feel better when they’re around others.\n\nPlan and prepare healthy meals. A poor diet can make depression worse, so make sure your loved one is eating right, with plenty of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and some healthy protein at every meal.\n\nEncourage the person to follow through with treatment. Depression usually recurs when treatment is stopped too soon, so help your loved one keep up with their treatment plan. If it isn’t helping, look into other medications and therapies."
