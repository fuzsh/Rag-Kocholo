        "text": "Transcript\n\nI’m Major Jackson and this is The Slowdown.\n\nOnce, as I walked with a colleague past a group of street buskers, they said, very casually, “Music is overrated.” I couldn’t believe my ears. This was in New Orleans! It is from this city that some of the world’s greatest musicians gifted us an ability to hear our joyous moments and to withstand our saddest occasions — from Louis Armstrong to Irma Thomas to Big Freedia. For a few minutes longer, I lingered, and listened, awed by the banjo, washtub bass, and violin of a jug band playing with fervor and humor. What enlivened my afternoon registered merely as…faint amusement to my colleague. I knew we’d never grow to become real friends.\n\nI believe life, even the cosmos, is saturated with sound. I’m not alone. The ancient mathematician Pythagoras and his followers discovered that a harmony of sounds exists in our solar system, based on each planet’s orbit around the sun. I would have been friends with him, and those subsequent generations of mathematicians and astronomers who then sought to represent planetary tone and celestial scale.\n\nBack in the late 1970s, several professors at Yale recorded 17th‐century astronomer Johannes Kepler’s hypothetical music. The album The Harmony of the World: a Realization for the Ear of Johannes Kepler's Astronomical Data from Harmonices Mundi 1619 is full of whines, whirs, clicks, whistles, and tweets. Apparently, that’s the sound each planet makes, much like the old dial-up modems.\n\nSo much art emerges from the belief in celestial harmony. When asked about her current project on Polynesian voyages, one friend said “I haven’t begun. I cannot hear it.” Poets, in their quest for language that offers up clarity and meaning, listen closely to the heard and the not heard. One can sense a structure of telling, an architecture that must be perceived and imagined. Our poems are songs. We hope to add to the music of the spheres. We sing the body electric, as one famous poet phrased it.\n\nToday’s poem understands the necessity of passing on this belief of a cosmic rhythm, how it exists as an underlying mystery awaiting us.\n\nSigns, Music by Raymond Antrobus\n\nThe first word my son signed was music : both hands, fingers conducting music for everything – even hunger, open mouth for the chew chew spoon squealing mmm – music. We’d play a record while he ate music when he wanted milk so I pour and hum a lullaby or I Just Don’t Know by Bill Withers because it’s ok not to know what you want and I want him to know that. Music is wiping the table after the plates music is feel my forehead for fever is whatever occurs in the centre of the body, whatever makes arms raise up, up. The second word my son signed was bird – beaked finger to thumb, bird for everything outside – window, sky, tree roof, chimney, aerial, airplane – birds. I saw I had given him a sign name. Fingers to eyes raising from thumbs - wide eye meaning watchful of the earth in three different roots – Hebrew, Arabic, Latin – I love how he clings to my shoulders and turns his head to point at the soft body of a caterpillar sliding across the counter, and signs, music."
