        "text": "What is West Nile virus?\n\nWest Nile is a virus that spreads through mosquito bites. Most people who get infected don’t have symptoms. But about 1 in 5 people have a fever, headache, body aches and other flu-like symptoms (sometimes called West Nile fever). Rarely, West Nile virus infects your nervous system and causes serious brain or spinal cord inflammation (encephalitis or meningitis).\n\nWest Nile is named after the West Nile district of Uganda, where it was first identified.\n\nHow common is West Nile virus?\n\nWest Nile virus is found in many parts of the world, including North America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Australia and Asia. It’s the most common mosquito-transmitted virus in the U.S., with cases reported in 49 states. There have been over 51,000 symptomatic cases in the U.S. since the first cases in the country in 1999.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of West Nile virus?\n\nSymptoms of West Nile fever include:\n\nFever.\n\nHeadache.\n\nMuscles aches.\n\nNausea and vomiting.\n\nDiarrhea.\n\nRash (usually concentrated around your chest and back).\n\nSwollen lymph nodes.\n\nSore throat.\n\nPain behind your eyes.\n\nWest Nile encephalitis and meningitis\n\nSymptoms of more serious West Nile infections include:\n\nIntense, very painful headache.\n\nHigh fever (above 103 degrees Fahrenheit or 39.5 degrees Celsius).\n\nStiff neck. You might not be able to move your chin toward your chest.\n\nConfusion.\n\nMuscle weakness.\n\nMuscle movements you can’t control (tremors or convulsions).\n\nSeizures.\n\nParalysis.\n\nComa.\n\nWhat causes West Nile virus?\n\nWest Nile is an arbovirus, or a virus you get from an arthropod (arthropods are a large group that includes insects). It’s an RNA virus in the genus Flavivirus. Similar viruses cause dengue fever, yellow fever and Zika.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow do you get West Nile virus?\n\nInfected mosquitos transmit West Nile virus. They usually get the virus by biting an infected bird (there’s no evidence humans get it directly from birds). The virus multiplies inside the mosquito, and it’s transmitted to you (or another animal) when it bites you. The incubation period — how long before you have symptoms — is usually two to six days after getting bitten (but can be up to 14 days).\n\nIn a very few cases, West Nile virus has spread:\n\nFrom a pregnant person to their fetus.\n\nThrough human milk.\n\nThrough a blood transfusion.\n\nThrough an organ transplant.\n\nHow contagious is West Nile virus?\n\nWest Nile isn’t contagious. You can’t get it from another person who has it.\n\nWhat are the risk factors for West Nile fever?\n\nMosquitos can bite anyone. But certain people are at a higher risk of getting severely ill if they get West Nile. You might be at a higher risk if you:\n\nAre over the age of 60.\n\nAre an organ transplant recipient.\n\nHave cancer.\n\nHave diabetes.\n\nHave high blood pressure (hypertension).\n\nHave kidney disease.\n\nWhat are the complications of West Nile virus?\n\nLess than 1% (about 1 in 150) of people infected with West Nile will get severe symptoms. The most common complication is swelling in part of your nervous system (your brain and spinal cord), including encephalitis and meningitis.\n\nLong-term effects of a severe West Nile infection could include:\n\nMemory loss.\n\nHearing loss.\n\nDifficulty walking or gait disorders.\n\nMuscle weakness.\n\nAbnormal reflexes.\n\nDepression.\n\nCan you ever get rid of West Nile virus?\n\nYes, in most people, their immune systems eventually fight off West Nile virus. Flu-like symptoms usually go away on their own. But if you have a weakened immune system, it may be difficult to get rid of the viral infection. Nervous system damage from severe West Nile infections can be permanent, even after the virus goes away.\n\nHow long does West Nile virus last?\n\nMild symptoms of West Nile usually fully resolve in a few weeks. Sometimes, fatigue and muscle weakness can linger for months. After a nervous system infection, you may have long-lasting or permanent memory loss, hearing loss, balance or gait issues, and other neurological conditions.\n\nIs West Nile virus fatal?\n\nWest Nile is fatal in about 1 out of 10 people with nervous system infections (or about 1 in 1,500 people with West Nile).\n\nWhen should I see my healthcare provider?\n\nIf you think you could have West Nile virus, talk to a healthcare provider. They can let you know:\n\nWhether you need to be tested.\n\nWhat symptoms of serious illness to look out for.\n\nHow to take care of yourself at home.\n\nWhen to follow up with them.\n\nWhen should I go to the ER?\n\nGo to the emergency room if you have symptoms of severe illness, including:\n\nSevere headache.\n\nHigh fever.\n\nStiff neck.\n\nConfusion.\n\nMuscle weakness or tremors.\n\nSeizures.\n\nWhat questions should I ask my doctor?\n\nIt might be helpful to ask your healthcare provider:\n\nWhen can I expect to feel better?\n\nHow do I manage my symptoms at home?\n\nWhat serious symptoms should I look out for?\n\nWhen should I follow up with you?\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nMost of the time, mosquitos are just an obnoxious nuisance. But they sometimes carry viruses that can make you sick. Fortunately, 80% of people who have West Nile never develop symptoms. And most people’s risk of getting seriously ill is very low.\n\nIf you might be around mosquitos, you can take steps to protect yourself from their bites. If you do get bitten, see a healthcare provider if you develop symptoms of West Nile. They can help you understand what serious symptoms to look out for and answer any questions you have."
