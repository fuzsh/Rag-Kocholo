        "text": "Ace High Music has signed country-rock band Lakeview to a publishing deal.\n\nComprised of Jesse Denaro and Luke Healy, Lakeview hails from the northeast. Their fusion of pop-punk style rock and blue-collar country songwriting has attracted fans with songs like “Home Team,” “Son Of A” and “Loser.”\n\n“Being a published songwriter has been a dream of mine for longer than I can remember,” Healy shares. “Writing songs is what I’m hardwired to do and what I plan on doing for the rest of my life. Partnering with Ace High made the most sense for our goals as songwriters. The best part is that I get to do it with some of my best friends.”\n\n“Before Lakeview, Luke and I both wrote music across all genres. From metal to pop to CCM and alternative rock,” Denaro adds. “I can’t wait to tap back into those genres and dig even deeper into the country rooms. I’m pumped for Ace High and the writing culture that they’re building—it’s an honor to be part of it on the ground floor.”\n\nThe band joins Ace High following the company’s rebrand and the addition of Chris Poole as Partner and Vice President of Publishing & Artist Development. The team also includes President & Managing Partner Travis Ray Chaney and Creative Director Abigail Wate-Ayala.\n\n“When I heard Jesse and Luke’s songs for the first time, I was blown away by their craftsmanship as artists and songwriters,” Poole says. “Not only do their songs embody the sonic uniqueness and authentically country lyric that is Lakeview, but they also both have an uncanny ability to write songs for others across multiple genres. It’s our belief that their brand of country music represents a movement defined by their blue-collar work ethic and one-of-a-kind perspective. I’m so excited to work side by side with them every day and I have no doubt this is only the beginning!”"
