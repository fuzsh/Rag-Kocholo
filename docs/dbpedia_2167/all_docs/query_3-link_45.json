        "text": "by Williams Center Music\n\nSat, 27 Jan 2024 (EST)\n\n06:00PM - 11:00PM\n\nEvent past\n\nWilliams Center\n\n15 Sylvan St\n\nRutherford, New Jersey 07070\n\nOpen Map\n\nOrganizer DEATH LILY Collaborator Williams Center Artist Eric DiCarlo\n\nJoin us at the Black Box for a performance by Signs Of The Swarm, Face Yourself (first show ever), Enox, Euclid and Nights of Malice.\n\nDoors at 6pm | Show start at 7pm\n\n50 Meet & Greet Tickets available to meet Signs Of The Swarm & Face Yourself and receive a signed show poster. Signing takes place between 6pm - 7pm.\n\nFace Yourself Bio:\n\nFace Yourself is an american deathcore band from the ny/nj tristate. formed in 2023, the band quickly gained recognition for their intense and brutal sound, captivating audiences with their powerful music videos and introspective lyrics.\n\nWith a lineup consisting of 6 members, face yourself has been relentless in their pursuit of pushing the boundaries in deathcore. Their music combines bone-crushing breakdowns, blistering guitar solos, and guttural vocals from their female vocalist Yasmine. simply an atmosphere of sheer aggression and primal force.\n\nDrawing inspiration from myspace deathcore, face yourself brings a modern taste to a classic sound. Their songs delve into introspective and dark themes, exploring the complexities of human emotions, societal issues, and personal struggles, inviting listeners to confront their own demons.\n\nSince their formation, Face Yourself has released 2 ep’s and 7 music videos showcasing their evolution as musicians and songwriters. Their newfound discography is a testament to their growth and dedication to the craft, with each release receiving critical acclaim from both fans and critics alike.\n\nAs Face Yourself continues to push the boundaries of their music and captivate audiences with their ferocious sound, they remain a force to be reckoned with in the deathcore realm. with their unwavering passion, raw talent, and relentless drive, face yourself is set to conquer new heights and leave a definitive mark on the metal genre.\n\nSigns Of The Swarm Bio:\n\nDeathcore was once dismissed as a trend, so it’s ironic that it now has trends within itself. Downtempo, slamming and now blackened variants of the style have dominated its scene at various points, with many bands jumping ship.\n\nPittsburgh’s Signs of the Swarm aren’t just any band, though. They’re a once-a-generation beacon that radiates the sounds that surrounded them, preserving history by reframing it. On fourth LP Absolvere, they’re bleak without being blackened, smashing without being slam, and downtempo as a choice rather than a stylistic confine. And as many of their deathcore peers experiment with adding singing, often gruff in tone, they add a more ethereal style that soothes on “Dreaming Desecration” and “Death Whistle.”\n\nThe band contrasts that with some of the most brutal moments in their eight-year career, with riffs more punishing than pensive and a rhythm section that frames them in creatively cacophonic ways. Above it all, they’re utilizing vocalist David Simonich monstrous range in a much fuller capacity than on his debut, 2019’s Vital Deprivation.\n\nThat transitional album found the band experimenting to re-find their footing, which here lands on solid ground through the addition of guitarist Jeff Russo, a former bandmate of Simonich’s fin Improvidence. The proof is in the placing, with Absolvere landing at #15 on “Current Hard Music Albums,” #21 on “Top New Artist Albums” and #139 on “Heatseekers.”\n\nBehind the cohesive crusher is drummer-turned-bassist-turned-drummer Bobby Crow, who acted as de facto producer, arranging the riffs written across Skype to make the songs more than the sum of their parts.\n\nThis gave Simonich a lofty platform from which to roar about the real (loved ones struggling with addiction, submitting one’s self wholly to art despite negativity swirling about) and the surreal; he or his characters beg for the release of death only to be denied. “Nameless” centers around a character collecting souls marked by death to receive its blessing, while “Blood Seal” follows a ritual to summon it. “Dreaming Desecration” and “Hollow Prison” are two sides of the same coin. When one finds themselves trapped in a meaningless existence, they can either attempt to escape through murderous hallucinations or succumb to the grave, respectively.\n\n“Death Whistle” is the penultimate song, closing the album and the writing sessions for Absolvere with a tale concluding in sweet release. The piercing screech of the titular whistle contrasts with a subtle serenade.\n\nIndeed, sometimes contrast can be a perfect complement, but more often that effect is achieved when paired with something more in-line. So it is when Ben Duerr (Shadow of Intent) and Alex Erian (Despised Icon) join the band for growls and shouts, where Signs of the Swarm filter their guests’ bands through their own sound. Instead of taking away from their identity, it expands it."
