        "text": "Many different factors cause violent behavior. The more these factors are present in your life, the more likely you are to commit an act of violence.\n\nReasons for violence\n\nWhat causes someone to punch, kick, stab, or fire a gun at someone else or even him/herself?\n\nThere is never a simple answer to that question. But people often commit violence because of one or more of the following:\n\nExpression. Some people use violence to release feelings of anger or frustration. They think there are no answers to their problems and turn to violence to express their out-of-control emotions.\n\nManipulation. Violence is used as a way to control others or get something they want.\n\nRetaliation. Violence is used to retaliate against those who have hurt them or someone they care about.\n\nViolence is a learned behavior. Like all learned behaviors, it can be changed. This isn’t easy, though. Since there is no single cause of violence, there is no one simple solution. The best you can do is learn to recognize the warning signs of violence and to get help when you see them in your friends or yourself.\n\nRecognizing violence warning signs in others\n\nOften people who act violently have trouble controlling their feelings. They may have been hurt by others. Some think that making people fear them through violence or threats of violence will solve their problems or earn them respect. This isn’t true. Some violence occurs as a response to prolonged hurt, trauma, bullying, or victimization. People may use violence to get something, while others may act out of self-protection or desperation.\n\nPeople who behave violently lose respect. They eventually find themselves isolated or disliked, and they still feel angry and frustrated.\n\nAnger itself is not always a sign that violence is imminent. While anger may be a warning sign of violence, it must be put in context. In fact, by assuming that anger or increased substance abuse will always lead to violence means that many nonviolent people who are in need of help become unfairly characterized as violent. What is most important to look at is if there are “new” signs and significant changes in behavior.\n\nThe presence of some of the signs or factors listed below should alert us to the possibility that an individual may be at risk of violence. It should be noted, however, that the presence of one or more signs or factors does not necessarily mean that the person will be violent.\n\nSome signs of potential for violence may be historical or static (unchangeable) factors like:\n\nA history of violent or aggressive behavior\n\nYoung age at first violent incident\n\nHaving been a victim of bullying\n\nHistory of discipline problems or frequent conflicts with authority\n\nEarly childhood abuse or neglect\n\nHaving witnessed violence at home\n\nFamily or parent condones use of violence\n\nA history of cruelty to animals\n\nHaving a major mental illness\n\nBeing callous or lacking empathy for others\n\nHistory of vandalism or property damage\n\nOther signs of potential violence may be present over time and may escalate or contribute to the risk of violence given a certain event or activity. These might include:\n\nSerious drug or alcohol use\n\nGang membership or strong desire to be in a gang\n\nAccess to or fascination with weapons, especially guns\n\nTrouble controlling feelings like anger\n\nWithdrawal from friends and usual activities\n\nRegularly feeling rejected or alone\n\nFeeling constantly disrespected\n\nSome signs of potential violence may be new or active signs. They might look like:\n\nIncreased loss of temper\n\nFrequent physical fighting\n\nIncreased use of alcohol or drugs\n\nIncreased risk-taking behavior\n\nDeclining school performance\n\nAcute episode of major mental illness\n\nPlanning how to commit acts of violence\n\nAnnouncing threats or plans for hurting others\n\nObtaining or carrying a weapon\n\nThere is research that indicates that new or active signs are more predictive of short-term risk of violence than historical factors, which may be more predictive of longer term risk.\n\nWhat you can do if someone you know shows violence warning signs\n\nWhen you recognize violence warning signs in someone else, there are things you can do. Hoping that someone else will deal with the situation is the easy way out.\n\nAbove all, be safe. Don’t spend time alone with people who show warning signs. If possible without putting yourself in danger, remove the person from the situation that’s setting them off.\n\nTell someone you trust and respect about your concerns and ask for help. This could be a family member, guidance counselor, teacher, school psychologist, coach, clergy, school resource officer, or friend.\n\nIf you are worried about being a victim of violence, get someone in authority to protect you. Do not resort to violence or use a weapon to protect yourself.\n\nThe key to really preventing violent behavior is asking an experienced professional for help. The most important thing to remember is to not go it alone and to take any signs or threats seriously.\n\nDealing with anger\n\nIt’s normal to feel angry or frustrated when you’ve been let down or betrayed. But anger and frustration don’t justify violent action. Anger is a strong emotion that can be difficult to keep in check, but the right response is to always stay cool.\n\nHere are some ways to deal with anger without resorting to violence:\n\nLearn to talk about your feelings—if you’re afraid to talk or if you can’t find the right words to describe what you’re going through, find a trusted friend or adult to help you one-on-one.\n\nExpress yourself calmly—express criticism, disappointment, anger, or displeasure without losing your temper or fighting. Ask yourself if your response is safe and reasonable.\n\nListen to others—listen carefully and respond without getting upset when someone gives you negative feedback. Ask yourself if you can really see the other person’s point of view.\n\nNegotiate—work out your problems with someone else by looking at alternative solutions and compromises.\n\nTake a self time-out and calm yourself down before you respond to the situation or person who is triggering your anger.\n\nAnger is part of life, but you can free yourself from the cycle of violence by learning to talk about your feelings. Be strong. Be safe. Be cool.\n\nAre you at risk for violent behavior?\n\nIf you recognize any of these signs of violent behavior in yourself, talk with someone who can help, a friend, but especially an adult you trust.\n\nYou don’t have to live with the guilt, sadness, and frustration that comes from hurting others.\n\nAdmitting you have a concern about hurting others is the first step. The second is to talk to a trusted adult such as a school counselor or psychologist, teacher, family member, friend, or clergy. They can get you in touch with a licensed mental health professional who cares and can help.\n\nControlling your own risk for violent behavior\n\nEveryone feels anger in his or her own way. Start managing it by recognizing how anger feels to you.\n\nWhen you are angry, you probably feel:\n\nMuscle tension\n\nAccelerated heartbeat\n\nA “knot” or “butterflies” in your stomach\n\nChanges in your breathing\n\nTrembling\n\nGoose bumps\n\nFlushed in the face\n\nYou can reduce the rush of adrenaline that’s responsible for your heart beating faster, your voice sounding louder, and your fists clenching if you:\n\nTake a few slow, deep breaths and concentrate on your breathing.\n\nImagine yourself at the beach, by a lake, or anywhere that makes you feel calm and peaceful.\n\nTry other thoughts or actions that have helped you relax in the past.\n\nKeep telling yourself:\n\n“Calm down.”\n\n“I don’t need to prove myself.”\n\n“I’m not going to let him/her get to me.”\n\nStop. Consider the consequences. Think before you act. Try to find positive or neutral explanations for what that person did that provoked you. Don’t argue in front of other people. Make your goal to defeat the problem, not the other person.\n\nLearn to recognize what sets you off and how anger feels to you. Learn to think through the benefits of controlling your anger and the consequences of losing control.\n\nMost of all, stay cool and think. Only you have the power to control your own violent behavior. Don’t let anger control you.\n\nViolence against self\n\nSome people who have trouble dealing with their feelings don’t react by lashing out at others. Instead, they direct violence toward themselves.\n\nThe most final and devastating expression of this kind of violence is suicide. Like people who are violent toward others, potential suicide victims often behave in recognizable ways before they try to end their lives.\n\nSuicide, like other forms of violence, is preventable. The two most important steps in prevention are recognizing warning signs and getting help. Warning signs of potential self-violence may include:\n\nPrevious suicide attempts\n\nSignificant alcohol or drug use\n\nThreatening or communicating thoughts of suicide, death, dying, or the afterlife\n\nSudden increase in moodiness, withdrawal, or isolation\n\nMajor change in eating or sleeping habits\n\nFeelings of hopelessness, guilt, or worthlessness\n\nPoor control over behavior\n\nImpulsive, aggressive behavior\n\nDrop in quality of school performance or interest\n\nLack of interest in usual activity\n\nGetting into trouble with authority figures\n\nPerfectionism\n\nGiving away important possessions\n\nHinting at not being around in the future or saying good-bye\n\nFeeling like a burden to others\n\nThese warning signs are especially noteworthy in the context of:\n\nA recent death or suicide of a friend or family member\n\nA recent break-up with a boyfriend or girlfriend or conflict with parents\n\nNews reports of other suicides by young people in the same school or community\n\nOften, suicidal thinking comes from a wish to end deep psychological pain. But keep in mind that pain often diminishes and feelings change. There are almost always options to something as final as suicide. Sometimes we just need some help to see them.\n\nIf a friend mentions suicide, take it seriously. Listen carefully and then seek help immediately. Never keep their talk of suicide a secret, even if they ask you to. Remember, you risk losing that person forever.\n\nWhen you recognize the warning signs for suicidal behavior, do something about it. Tell a trusted adult what you have seen or heard. Get help from a licensed mental health professional as soon as possible. They can help work out the problems that seem so unsolvable but, in fact, are not.\n\nTake a stand against violence."
