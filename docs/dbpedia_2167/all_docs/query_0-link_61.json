        "text": "The scope of this page is central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) in children and adults. Content is relevant to both developmental and acquired CAPD; however, this page does not specifically address adult acquired CAPD from causes such as brain injury, disease, or factors of aging.\n\nSee the Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) Evidence Map for summaries of the available research on this topic.\n\nHearing-related terminology may vary depending upon context and a range of factors. See ASHA’s resource on hearing-related topics: terminology guidance for more information.\n\nThe ASHA Practice Portal aims to provide access to the best available evidence, expertise, and resources to support the individual clinical decision making of professionally educated clinicians. Long-standing variation in perspectives within the professions of audiology and speech-language pathology regarding the diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of CAPD makes the need for informed clinical decision making of paramount importance.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing\n\nCentral auditory processing—also seen in the literature as (central) auditory processing or auditory processing—is the perceptual processing of auditory information in the central auditory nervous system (CANS) and the neurobiological activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials.\n\nKnowledge of the neuroanatomy and physiology of the CANS is essential for understanding and interpreting underlying processes and deficits. Medwetsky (2011) provides in-depth information on this topic.\n\nCentral auditory processing consists of mechanisms that preserve, refine, analyze, modify, organize, and interpret information from the auditory peripheral system. These mechanisms underlie skills such as auditory discrimination, temporal aspects of audition, and binaural processing (ASHA, 1996; Bellis, 2011; Chermak & Musiek, 1997).\n\nCentral Auditory Processing and Language Processing\n\nThere is general agreement that auditory perceptual abilities and language development are interrelated—as are auditory processing skills and pre-literacy skills (Corriveau et al., 2010)—and that it can be difficult to separate the influence of auditory and language skills with regard to academic demands (Richard, 2012, 2013). The act of processing speech is complex and involves the engagement of auditory, cognitive, and language mechanisms, often simultaneously (Medwetsky, 2011).\n\nRichard’s (2013, 2017) continuum of processing includes both auditory processing and language processing. This continuum involves the following types of processing:\n\ncentral auditory processing, in which the neural representation of acoustic signals is processed after they leave the cochlea and travel through the auditory nervous system to the primary auditory cortices of the left and right hemispheres\n\nphonemic processing, in which phonemic skills such as sound discrimination, blending, and segmenting are utilized to discriminate acoustic features of the signal\n\nlinguistic processing, in which meaning is attached to the signal\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD)\n\nTerms used to describe a disorder in the processing of auditory information may vary based on the perspective of the professional describing the problem. Terms include, but are not limited to, “auditory processing disorder,” “(central) auditory processing disorder,” “language processing disorder,” and “auditory information processing disorder.”\n\nASHA (2005) uses the term central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) to refer to deficits in the neural processing of auditory information in the CANS (not due to higher order language or cognitive factors) demonstrated by poor performance in one or more of the following skills:\n\nsound localization and lateralization\n\nauditory discrimination\n\nauditory pattern recognition\n\ntemporal aspects of audition\n\nauditory performance in competing acoustic signals\n\nauditory performance with degraded acoustic signals\n\nThis terminology aligns with the National Center for Health Statistics classification of the diagnosis within the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM).\n\nAlthough sometimes difficult, careful differential diagnosis is important to the process of treatment planning:\n\nCAPD may lead to or be associated with difficulties in higher order language, learning, and communication functions.\n\nCAPD may co-occur with (and necessitate differentiation from) other disorders (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, language delay or disorder, and learning disability).\n\nCAPD is not due to peripheral hearing loss, whether conductive (i.e., involving the outer or middle ear) or sensorineural (i.e., involving the cochlea or auditory nerve).\n\nCAPD is not due to multilingualism.\n\nProfessionals have adopted varying perspectives on the interpretation of CAPD (Buehler, 2012; Cacace & McFarland, 2009; DeBonis, 2015; de Wit et al., 2016; Friberg & McNamara, 2010; Jerger, 1998; Jutras et al., 2007; McDermott et al., 2016; McFarland & Cacace, 2006; Moore et al., 2010; Rees, 1973, 1981; Richard, 2011; Sharma et al., 2019). These different perspectives reflect ongoing debate regarding how to define, assess, and treat CAPD.\n\nDifferent viewpoints on CAPD exist for several reasons, including the heterogeneity of symptoms, variations in the definition, the lack of a reference standard for diagnosis, the relationship between auditory perceptual deficits and language disorders, and the particular treatment approach(es) that follow from the diagnosis (Bellis & Ferre, 1999; Kamhi, 2011; Katz et al., 1992; Moore, 2018; Moore et al., 2013; Vermiglio, 2014). For example, some professionals propose that a CAPD diagnosis may indicate a broader language-based disorder necessitating language treatment targets (DeBonis, 2015; de Wit et al., 2016; Kamhi, 2011). Some suggest that CAPD be diagnosed by specific deficit (e.g., difficulty processing signals in noise; difficulties with auditory discrimination, temporal processing, or binaural processing) rather than broadly as CAPD because of the diverse skills involved in auditory processing (Vermiglio, 2016).\n\nOf note, not all diagnoses of CAPD represent a limitation for the individual (Dillon et al., 2012) or a condition that must be treated (Vermiglio, 2016).\n\nTeam Approach\n\nA person- and family-centered plan of care for CAPD ideally involves a team of professionals. The composition of an interprofessional team varies based on the needs of the individual, who (along with their support system) is integral to the process (e.g., planning, decision making, service delivery). See the ASHA resources on interprofessional education/interprofessional practice (IPE/IPP) and person-centered care in audiology as well as the ASHA Practice Portal pages on Multilingual Service Delivery in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology and Cultural Responsiveness.\n\nSee the Assessment section of the Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/caregiver perspective.\n\nFor guidance and considerations on infection control practices during the assessment process, see the ASHA’s page on infection control resources for audiologists and speech-language pathologists.\n\nScreening\n\nThe goal of screening for central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) is to identify individuals who are potential candidates for a comprehensive central auditory test battery. Abbreviated test protocols can be used for screening. Screening protocols may include CAPD screening test batteries, single screening tests, various combinations of tests of auditory processing skills, observational tools, or a combination of these options. Questionnaires and checklists are available to probe auditory behaviors related to academic achievement, listening skills, and communication and to allow for systematic observation of listening behavior. Communication checklists, language tests, and cognitive tests may identify younger children who have or may likely develop auditory difficulties.\n\nThere is no universally accepted method for screening for CAPD. There remains a need for valid and efficient screening tools.\n\nComprehensive Assessment\n\nCAPD is an auditory deficit diagnosed by an audiologist based on clinical presentation and assessment findings (ASHA, 2005). However, there is currently no reference standard for diagnosing CAPD (American Academy of Audiology, 2010; Vermiglio, 2016).\n\nSome difficulties associated with diagnosing CAPD are due to its heterogeneous presentation and the frequent overlap in symptoms with language and other disorders (de Wit et al., 2018). “Many disorders present behavioral characteristics similar to CAPD that can cause the listener to perform poorly on behavioral central auditory function tests and/or exhibit similar functional listening difficulties” (Ferre, 2014, p. 589).\n\nVarying perspectives among interdisciplinary team members involved in the evaluation process may result in different diagnoses (e.g., CAPD, phonological awareness disorder, language processing disorder; McNamara et al., 2008; Richard, 2012). Therefore, a collaborative team including both audiologists and speech-language pathologists (SLPs) is valuable in the evaluation of CAPD, the identification of any language disorders that may occur together with CAPD, the differentiation between language and phonological processing disorders and CAPD, and the development of appropriate intervention strategies (Sharma et al., 2009). Audiologists and SLPs may share responsibilities in the following ways:\n\nAudiologists are responsible for evaluating and diagnosing problems in the reception and/or transference of auditory signals in the peripheral auditory system and the central auditory nervous system.\n\nSLPs are responsible for evaluating and diagnosing problems in the linguistic processing of the auditory signal.\n\nAudiologists and SLPs share responsibility for diagnosing problems in the phonemic processing of the auditory signal (Richard, 2013).\n\nAssessment data may be gathered by the audiologist, the SLP, and other members of the interdisciplinary team (e.g., psychologist, special educator). Assessment data may identify the presence of disorders with symptoms similar to CAPD (e.g., peripheral hearing loss, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, speech-language disorder, cognitive deficits, auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder). For example, a comprehensive speech and language evaluation includes spoken and written language, phonemic awareness, phonological working memory and phonological retrieval, and social communication. Psychoeducational assessments often performed by an educational psychologist may include tests of memory, executive functioning, and attention.\n\nThe order in which interdisciplinary assessments are completed may vary depending on the referral source and the needs of the individual (e.g., particular symptoms, case history information). Identification of other global and/or related disorders (e.g., speech, language, attention, executive function) by the appropriate professional (e.g., SLP, psychologist) may preclude additional CAPD testing and may lead to an intervention plan specific to those diagnoses.\n\nAll assessments are conducted in the language(s) used by the individual, and materials are chosen with linguistic relevance in mind. Delays in auditory processing resulting from multilanguage learning are not considered disorders if the delay does not exist in all language(s) used.\n\nFor additional and complementary information, see the ASHA Practice Portal pages on Hearing Loss in Children, Spoken Language Disorders, Written Language Disorders, Speech Sound Disorders: Articulation and Phonology, Multilingual Service Delivery in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology, Cultural Responsiveness, and Social Communication Disorder.\n\nCase History\n\nAccurate diagnosis relies on the interpretation of a test battery within the context of an individual’s medical and/or developmental history. A thorough case history for CAPD may include the following items:\n\nage, including chronological and mental age\n\nprenatal and birth history\n\nmedical history, including medication history\n\notologic history (e.g., ear infections, surgeries)\n\nneurologic history (e.g., head trauma)\n\npsychological history\n\ngenetic testing results\n\nhearing health history and status, including previous hearing screening and testing results\n\nfamily health and hearing history\n\ncoexisting disabilities\n\ncognitive status\n\ncommunication status, including language(s) used as well as identified needs and goals\n\nstatus of speech, language, reading, and social skills\n\neducational and/or occupational status, including any accommodations, supports, and/or services being received\n\nauditory and/or behavioral complaints (e.g., difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments, difficulty following rapid speech, inability to detect humor or sarcasm, distractibility)\n\nSee the ASHA Practice Portal page on Cultural Responsiveness for information on gathering a case history and ethnographic interviewing.\n\nAudiologic Assessment Components\n\nAudiologic Evaluation of the Peripheral Auditory System\n\nIt is essential to conduct an audiologic evaluation to diagnose or rule out hearing loss and other hearing-related disorders. Peripheral hearing loss can present with similar listening difficulties to CAPD. The presence of peripheral hearing loss may affect CAPD testing (Baran & Musiek, 1999). In some cases, the severity and/or configuration of the hearing loss will prohibit the completion of a CAPD evaluation.\n\nPeripheral auditory disorders include conductive, sensorineural, and mixed hearing loss, as well as auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (Norrix & Velenovsky, 2014) and cochlear synaptopathy (i.e., hidden hearing loss; Liberman et al., 2016). These disorders can affect an individual’s ability to hear and understand speech in background noise to varying degrees. See the Assessment sections of the ASHA Practice Portal pages on Hearing Loss in Adults and Hearing Loss in Children for information on assessing the peripheral auditory system.\n\nAudiologic Evaluation of the Central Auditory System\n\nThe audiologist selects an individualized, person-centered central auditory processing test battery based on age, findings from the case history, interdisciplinary assessment results (e.g., language and cognitive evaluations), and results from the peripheral audiologic evaluation (Emanuel et al., 2011). Considerations include the strengths and weaknesses of the individual tests (e.g., sensitivity and specificity), the population on which they were normed, required response mode, and areas of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) to which each test is most sensitive (Chermak et al., 2017).\n\nThere are several behavioral audiologic measures that can be used to assess auditory processing skills:\n\nAuditory discrimination tests may be used to assess differentiation of similar acoustic stimuli that differ in frequency, intensity, and/or temporal parameters.\n\nAuditory temporal processing and patterning tests may be used to assess analyzation of acoustic events over time.\n\nDichotic speech tests may be used to assess separation (i.e., binaural separation) or integration (i.e., binaural integration) of different auditory stimuli presented to each ear simultaneously.\n\nMonaural low-redundancy speech tests may be used to assess the recognition of degraded speech stimuli presented to one ear at a time, including speech in noise, speech in competition, low-pass filtered speech, or compressed (rapid) speech.\n\nBinaural interaction tests may be used to assess the combination of complementary inputs distributed between both ears, synthesizing intensity, time, or spectral differences of otherwise identical stimuli presented simultaneously or sequentially.\n\nFor a discussion of behavioral tests, see McNamara and Hurley (2019).\n\nSeveral principles may influence the composition of a central auditory test battery:\n\nRefer to the appropriate professional(s) regarding suspected related disorders (e.g., speech, language, cognitive), preferably before central auditory processing testing is completed, as co-occurring diagnoses may preclude central auditory processing testing or interfere with accurate interpretation of results.\n\nCenter the test battery process around the referring complaint(s) and the relevant information available to the audiologist rather than using a test-driven approach.\n\nInclude measures that are sensitive to the integrity of the CANS.\n\nExamine different central processes, tasks, and the integrity of multiple levels and regions of the CANS.\n\nChoose testing materials and stimuli with linguistic and cultural relevance in mind.\n\nConsider an individual’s age and/or developmental status when choosing behavioral tests of central auditory function as well as potential variability in performance in young children due to factors such as response demands and task complexity (Smart et al., 2012).\n\nSelect tests that were developed for (and have normative data on) a specific age group.\n\nInclude both verbal and nonverbal stimuli to examine various aspects of auditory processing and various levels of the auditory nervous system.\n\nTest individuals who are successfully medicated for attention, anxiety, or other disorders while they are medicated to avoid confounding variables.\n\nMonitor an individual’s attention, motivation, and energy level for potential impact on optimum testing session length.\n\nCorroborate test results with an individual’s primary symptoms or concerns.\n\nNorm-based interpretation of test results involves comparing the individual’s performance to normative group data (e.g., based on age). Patient-based interpretation involves comparing the individual’s performance to their own baseline performance. Comparison of results observed across disciplines or between tests can also be helpful with interpretation. For example, administering and comparing results for several tests that measure the same auditory process can be used to look for patterns in auditory processing abilities. Inconsistencies across tests may signal the presence of a nonauditory confound, and pervasive deficits on all tests may signal a cognitive deficit or other nonauditory confound.\n\nExamples of current diagnostic criteria and interpretations of test results include the following:\n\nPerformance deficits are noted in one or both ears of at least 2 SDs below the mean on two or more tests in the battery (Chermak & Musiek, 1997).\n\nIf poor performance is observed on only one test,\n\ndiagnosis may be withheld unless performance falls at least 3 SDs below the mean or the finding is accompanied by significant functional difficulty in auditory behaviors that rely on the process being assessed, and\n\nthe failed test—and other tests that assess the same process—should be readministered to confirm initial findings.\n\nSee the Treatment section of the Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/caregiver perspective.\n\nSee the Service Delivery section of the Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/caregiver perspective.\n\nFor guidance and considerations on infection control practices during the treatment process, see ASHA’s page on infection control resources for audiologists and speech-language pathologists.\n\nCentral auditory processing disorder (CAPD) may affect listening, communication, academic success, and psychosocial wellness. Priorities and specific goals for intervention aim to be person-centered, culturally and linguistically relevant, and jointly agreed upon with the individual seeking services at the center of the decision-making process. Effective communication in everyday contexts important to the individual (e.g., home, classroom, work, community) is an overarching consideration. Efforts to improve acoustic access and communication abilities for individuals of any age require an analysis of specific auditory processing weaknesses, functional deficits, and specific recommendations for change across settings.\n\nA team approach to treatment is often used. The composition of the team may vary (e.g., audiologist, speech-language pathologist [SLP], teacher, interpreter, parents, counselor) depending on the needs and goals of the individual seeking treatment. See the ASHA resources on interprofessional education/interprofessional practice (IPE/IPP) and person-centered care in audiology as well as the ASHA Practice Portal pages on Cultural Responsiveness and Multilingual Service Delivery in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology.\n\nTreatment goals are based on the following considerations:\n\npatient and family input and goals\n\nauditory processing deficits\n\nneeds identified during the assessment process\n\ncase history information\n\nrelated assessment data (e.g., speech-language and psychoeducational)\n\nTreatment approaches\n\nare based on the best available evidence;\n\nfollow learning principles;\n\nstrive to reduce functional deficits;\n\nstrive to maximize generalization; and\n\noccur in multiple settings as appropriate (e.g., home, classroom, workplace, community).\n\nThree treatment approaches for individuals diagnosed with CAPD, often used concurrently, include the following (ASHA, 2005):\n\nEnvironmental modifications involve changing the learning or communication environment.\n\nDirect skills remediation includes various auditory training techniques.\n\nCompensatory strategies include strategies and/or adaptive techniques designed to minimize the impact of CAPD by strengthening higher order skills to compensate for and/or obtain missed auditory information.\n\nIt is essential to consider the co-occurrence of CAPD with other spoken and written language disorders (Sharma et al., 2009) and the heterogeneity of CAPD when providing treatment (Fey et al., 2011; Richard, 2012). Some treatment approaches and tasks may be the same as those used for spoken or written language disorders (Kamhi, 2011; Richard, 2013) given the overlap in functional symptoms of CAPD and language disorders. See the Treatment sections of the ASHA Practice Portal pages on Spoken Language Disorders and Written Language Disorders.\n\nA comprehensive and person-centered treatment plan for CAPD may include, but not be limited to, the following interventions.\n\nEnvironmental Modifications\n\nEnvironmental modifications improve access to auditorily presented information. They include enhancement of the auditory signal and modifications to the listening environment to improve clarity and/or audibility of the signal itself (Crandell & Smaldino, 1999, 2000; Friederichs & Friederichs, 2005; Johnston et al., 2009; Smart et al., 2018). Various associated strategies and accommodations may be used to improve an individual’s access to information in various settings (Bellis, 2002, 2011; Chermak & Musiek, 1997; Hétu et al., 1990).\n\nEnhancement of the auditory signal includes the use of hearing assistive technology. Examples include individual and group assistive listening devices such as frequency modulation/digital modulation (i.e., FM/DM), classroom audio distribution systems, and infrared technology. This type of auditory signal enhancement may be considered for school-age children who are having difficulties understanding auditory messages in the classroom to improve classroom listening behaviors and function (Reynolds et al., 2016; Rosenberg, 2002; Smart et al., 2018). Appropriate use of hearing assistive technology includes validation of benefits in typical listening conditions experienced by the individual using a variety of outcomes tools after fitting (American Academy of Audiology, 2008).\n\nModifications to the listening environment can be used to improve acoustics affecting speech intelligibility. The following changes may be helpful:\n\nCover reflective surfaces (e.g., black/white boards not in use, linoleum or wood floors, untreated ceilings) to decrease reverberation.\n\nUse properly placed acoustic dividers.\n\nUse various absorption materials throughout open or empty spaces.\n\nReduce competing signals by eliminating or moving external noise sources (e.g., aquariums, fluorescent lights that hum) from the learning space.\n\nFor more information, see the ASHA Practice Portal page on Classroom Acoustics and the Educational Audiology Association’s Classroom Acoustics and Hearing: Essentials to Learning [PDF].\n\nAn individual’s access to auditory information may also be improved with the use of the following strategies and/or accommodations:\n\nrequesting the presenter to speak more slowly, pause more often, emphasize key words, and “chunk” instructions\n\nasking the speaker to check that the listener has understood and to use repetition and rephrasing when communication breakdowns occur\n\nmaking strategic seating choices\n\npairing verbal presentations or instructions with visuals\n\nrecording verbal presentations\n\nusing written supports such as email\n\nproviding support for focused/attentive listening (e.g., use notetakers, preview information prior to instruction, use organizers)\n\nDirect Skills Remediation\n\nDirect skills remediation includes targeted auditory training techniques aimed at remediating auditory processing deficits (Bellis, 2002, 2011; British Society of Audiology, 2011; Chermak & Musiek, 2002). Although some clinicians support direct skills remediation in this population, others have provided scrutiny (Fey et al., 2011; Rees, 1973). See the Treatment section of the Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence and clinical expertise on the use of direct auditory skills interventions in the treatment of CAPD.\n\nDirect skills remediation may address the following skills (Bamiou et al., 2006; Bellis, 2011; Bellis & Anzalone, 2008):\n\nauditory discrimination—distinguishing the intensity, frequency, and duration of one sound from another\n\nphoneme discrimination—distinguishing between speech sounds that make a difference in meaning in a particular language (e.g., /p/ vs. /b/ in English) and phoneme–grapheme skills (i.e., written representation of phonemes)\n\ntemporal aspects of audition—perceiving acoustic signals over time, including\n\ntemporal integration—the ability to consolidate auditory information presented to both ears over time,\n\ntemporal masking—the ability to separate one sound from another sound that immediately precedes or follows it,\n\ntemporal resolution—the ability to detect a gap or small timing differences between two sounds, and\n\ntemporal ordering or sequencing—the ability to sequence chronological signal occurrences over time\n\nauditory pattern recognition—distinguishing similarities and differences in sound patterns\n\nsound localization and lateralization—identifying the location, origin, direction, and distance of a sound reaching each ear\n\nbinaural separation—recognizing auditory information presented within a background of noise or competition (e.g., dichotic listening, speech in noise)\n\nbinaural integration—recognizing disparate auditory stimuli presented to each ear simultaneously\n\nComputer-Based Training\n\nDirect skills remediation includes computer-based training programs that may address auditory and/or language targets. Because of the continuum from the cochlea to the language areas, it may be difficult to isolate the specific factors contributing to treatment outcomes (Gillam et al., 2008; Richard, 2012). Some programs “are designed to capitalize on the plasticity of the [auditory] system” (Tremblay & Kraus, 2002, p. 97). As with all other treatments, it is important that computer-based training be evidence-based, individualized, and carefully monitored by an audiologist or SLP. Although more research is warranted, early evidence is supportive of these direct skills computer-based treatment approaches (Barker & Bellis, 2018; Barker & Hicks, 2020; Loo et al., 2010; Musiek et al., 2002; Phillips, 2002).\n\nAvailable programs focus on the following skills:\n\ntemporal processing\n\nlinguistic and nonlinguistic auditory memory\n\nlinguistic and nonlinguistic dichotic ability\n\nbinaural integration and separation skills\n\nphonological awareness\n\nlanguage decoding and comprehension\n\nComputerized delivery may provide\n\nmultisensory stimulation,\n\nengaging formats,\n\nfeedback and reinforcement, and\n\nfacilitation of intensive training.\n\nInterhemispheric Transfer Training\n\nDirect skills remediation also includes exercises to train interhemispheric transfer (Bellis, 2002; Musiek et al., 1999). Interhemispheric transfer of information underlies binaural hearing and binaural processing.\n\nExercises to train interhemispheric transfer include the following tasks:\n\ntasks that address interaural timing and intensity differences\n\nunimodal tasks (e.g., linking prosodic and linguistic acoustic features)\n\nmultimodal tasks (e.g., writing to dictation, verbally describing a picture while drawing)\n\nCompensatory Strategies\n\nCompensatory strategies (e.g., metalinguistic and metacognitive) are designed to minimize the impact of CAPD on language, cognition, and academics. They focus on strengthening higher order central resources (e.g., language, memory, attention) to enhance listening skills, communication, social skills, and learning outcomes.\n\nMetalinguistic strategies include the following examples:\n\nschema induction (i.e., predicting elements in a message) and discourse cohesion devices (i.e., grammatical means to link and establish relationships between sentences and paragraphs)\n\nuse of graphic organizers (e.g., problem–solution map, story map, semantic network tree)\n\nuse of context to understand and build vocabulary\n\nphonological awareness (see British Society of Audiology, 2011, Appendix K)\n\nsemantic network expansion\n\nactive listening (see British Society of Audiology, 2011, Appendix N)\n\nMetacognitive strategies include the following examples:\n\nself-instruction\n\norganization skills\n\nmetamemory techniques (e.g., mnemonics, mind mapping)\n\nproblem solving\n\nassertiveness training\n\nLanguage/Curricular-Based Treatment Approaches\n\nSome school-age students may benefit from carefully targeted and individualized language interventions.\n\nThis applied curricular approach falls within the area of metacognitive or compensatory strategies. It “places CAPD symptoms within a broader framework and takes into account the complex interaction among the language knowledge, skills, and strategies needed for academic success” (Wallach, 2011, p. 273).\n\nThis broader-based information and linguistic processing framework (Cowan et al., 2009; Gillam et al., 2002; Kamhi, 2004; Nittrouer, 1999, 2002) focuses on the linguistic aspects of auditory processing deficits and includes linguistic goals.\n\nConsiderations for a strategic-based language/curriculum-relevant approach (based on Wallach, 2011) include the following:\n\nFocus on enhancing language comprehension and production skills to help students with auditory weaknesses access curricular content (Kaderavek, 2011). For example, help students learn concepts and skills such as paraphrasing, explaining differences, knowing word meanings, and using complex syntax.\n\nAddress language knowledge, skills, and strategies that underlie academic tasks (Ehren, 2000; Ehren et al., 2004).\n\nSelect goals for contextualized (e.g., language accompanied by gesture, facial, and other supports) and decontextualized (e.g., language within testing contexts, many written materials) aspects of language (Wallach, 2008).\n\nRecognize that metalinguistic aspects are involved in auditory tasks. For example, sentence memory tasks involve metalinguistic knowledge of sentence structure, and auditory discrimination tasks involve phonemic judgments and the metalinguistic ability to analyze the sound structure of language (Schuele & Boudreau, 2008; van Kleeck, 1994).\n\nIdentify curricular and instructional demands across grades and determine the impact on language use. Recognize the need for disciplinary literacy, the concept that each academic subject has its own language (Ehren et al., 2004; Heller & Greenleaf, 2007; VanSledright, 2002, 2004).\n\nDevelop language interventions that focus on content-area subjects. Connect with school-based colleagues and consider curriculum demands placed on students (Brozo, 2009; Wallach et al., 2009).\n\nTeach strategies to help students derive meaning from spoken and written language and organize incoming information (Blachowicz & Fisher, 2004; Ehren, 2009; McKeown et al., 2009; Nippold, 2010). For example, create expectations for what they are likely to hear in the classroom as they will influence what is attended to, perceived, and remembered.\n\nUnderstand the reciprocal nature of spoken and written language. Written language skills can facilitate auditory processing by improving metalinguistic awareness and by introducing various language forms and new vocabulary (Schuele & Boudreau, 2008; Scott, 2009; van Kleeck, 2004; Zucker et al., 2009).\n\nAssessing Treatment Progress\n\nThe provision of standardized measures as well as academic/learning measures prior to treatment as well as posttreatment may be used to assess treatment progress. Measures may include indices of auditory performance (e.g., pattern tests, dichotic digits, speech recognition for time-compressed speech); functional indices of metalanguage (e.g., phonemic analysis, phonemic synthesis); and/or global measures of listening, communication, and academic performance (e.g., self-assessment or informant communication, questionnaires, and/or education scales).\n\nAs listening and learning demands change over time, alterations to the treatment plan may be indicated. It is important that the relative efficacy of each treatment approach implemented be monitored on an ongoing basis and that changes be made as needed.\n\nSpecial Considerations: Adolescents and Adults\n\nChildren with auditory processing deficits may have more difficulty as they enter noisy auditory-based learning environments with high demands on their listening skills. Adolescents and adults may experience more difficulties with understanding and listening as educational and vocational communication demands change or increase.\n\nThe following suggestions may be applicable for adolescents and adults with CAPD:\n\nMake adjustments based on different contextual demands at home, at school, at work, and in the community (e.g., moving from an open cubicle to a closed office, using strategic seating or hearing assistive technology in large conference rooms or lecture halls).\n\nUse multiple treatment options and approaches, as well as academic and vocational training, career counseling, and transition planning.\n\nFocus on self-advocacy.\n\nRegulations\n\nA court decision by the United States Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (2012) determined that an auditory processing disorder constitutes an “other health impairment” under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA, 2004). See E. M. . . . v. Pajaro Valley Unified School District [PDF]. This court case helped define CAPD under the IDEA for school administrators and educators, parents, the judiciary, and administrative bodies and legal representatives in the western states.\n\nCourt filings related to the case described CAPD (also referred to as “auditory processing disorder”) as a deficiency in neurological processing that adversely affects an individual’s ability to identify and distinguish similar sounds and understand oral communication. In addition, evidence introduced in court established that CAPD requires a diagnosis by an audiologist.\n\nIn addition to helping define CAPD, this court case could also improve access to services under the IDEA in public school settings. Court documents revealed that, given the similarity of symptoms caused by CAPD and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, CAPD clearly falls within the scope of identified illnesses that could be covered by “other health impairment.” CAPD can satisfy the three elements of an “other health impairment” in that it is (a) a chronic medical condition (b) that impacts a child’s alertness in a classroom and (c) adversely affects the child’s ability to learn.\n\nSome state education departments may review eligibility for CAPD under the IDEA disability categories of “speech or language impairment” or “specific learning disability.” However, establishing CAPD in the category of “other health impairment” provides a specific and recognized category with which to argue for service eligibility.\n\nCoding and Payment\n\nPayment and coverage of audiology and speech-language pathology services related to the evaluation and treatment of CAPD varies based on factors such as the patient’s diagnosis(es), the payer (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, or commercial insurance), and the patient’s specific health insurance plan. It is important for audiologists and SLPs to understand coverage policies for the payers they commonly bill, to verify coverage for each patient prior to initiating services, and to be familiar with correct diagnosis and procedure coding for accurate claims submission.\n\nAudiologists and SLPs use the National Center for Health Statistics International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes to describe the patient’s diagnosis and Current Procedural Terminology codes to describe CAPD-related evaluation and treatment. The term “central auditory processing disorder” is specifically used to classify this diagnosis within the ICD-10-CM. Payer policies often outline specific coverage guidelines and list relevant ICD-10-CM and Current Procedural Terminology codes.\n\nCoding options are different for each discipline. For more information about coding, see the following ASHA resources:\n\nCoding for Reimbursement Frequently Asked Questions: Audiology—What code/s should I use for auditory processing (AP) evaluation and treatment?\n\nCoding for Reimbursement Frequently Asked Questions: Speech-Language Pathology—What code/s should I use for auditory processing (AP) evaluation and treatment?\n\nICD-10-CM Coding FAQs for Audiologists and SLPs: What code should an audiologist use for CAPD?\n\nICD-10-CM Coding FAQs for Audiologists and SLPs: What ICD-10-CM code should I use for auditory processing (AP)?\n\nAmerican Academy of Audiology.
