        "text": "9th August 2024: We added new Reverse 1999 codes.\n\nReverse 1999 is a free-to-play strategic RPG for Android, iOS and PC. Made by Chinese developers Bluepoch, the RPG boasts a fascinating card-based combat system, and stylish visuals that wouldn't seem out of place in a Vanillaware game. Not to mention an in-depth, time-travel story that will transport players to anime versions of different periods in history - including London in the swinging 60s.\n\nTo get new characters to join you on your adventures, you'll have to use the game's gacha-style Summon system, and that's where Reverse 1999 codes can help. Exchange codes offer a range of freebies, including the crucial Clear Drop currency which is needed to pull for new characters. Besides Clear Drops, codes offer other useful resources like Dust and Sharpodonty, which you'll need to level up your characters.\n\nWorking Reverse 1999 codes\n\nExpired Reverse 1999 codes\n\nHow to redeem Reverse 1999 codes\n\nWorking Reverse 1999 codes\n\nExpectedSouvenirs: Jar of Picrasma Candy, 3 Moment of Dissonance, 30 Wilderness Shell (NEW!)\n\nExpeditionSupplies: 30 Clear Drop\n\nCurtainCall: Jar of Picrasma Candy, 20K Dust, 15K Sharpodonty, 3 Bottle of Pages\n\nReadingTime: 30 Clear Drop, 10k Dust, 10k Sharpodonty, 2 Fine Insight Package\n\nBetweenActs: 10 Enlighten III, 1 Delicate Insight Casket, 10k Sharpodonty\n\nDressRehearsal: 30 Clear Drop\n\nMournfulLament: 30 Clear Drop, 10k Sharpodonty, 10k Dust, 2 Fine Insight Package\n\nAThousandHamlets: 30 Clear Drop, 10k Sharpodonty, 10k Dust, 2 Fine Insight Package\n\nPraiseofCourage: 30 Clear Drop, 30 Wilderness Shell, 3 Moment of Dissonance, 5 Enlighten II\n\nAnInterlude: 10k Sharpodonty, 5 Enlighten II, 3 Moment of Dissonance, 1 Jar of Picrasma Candy\n\nCurtainRises: 10k Sharpodonty, 5 Enlighten II, 3 Bottle of Pages\n\nMainStoryUpdate: 12k Dust, 10k Sharpodonty and 3 Moment of Dissonance\n\n5YRBRF9: 19,999 Dust, 19,999 Sharpodonty and 3 Fine Insight Package\n\n1999GIFT: 50 Clear Drop and 19,999 Dust\n\nExpired Reverse 1999 codes\n\nBouquetandBeauty\n\nEchoesOf1999\n\nBoldandFortune\n\nMysteryAdventure\n\nFestivePresent\n\nWorldinTheSuitcase\n\nADORABLEJIUNIANGZI\n\nOTHERWORLDLYGETIAN\n\nRELIABLEYENISEI\n\nRE1999GlobalMusicAwards\n\n1999OST\n\nAprilFish\n\n6\n\nTY4URREVIEW\n\nIRREGULARPRIME\n\nStarBright\n\n6THEPERFECTNUMBER\n\nREVERSELIVE\n\nMAINSTORUPDATE\n\nTHEPRISONERINTHECAVE\n\n37APRIMENUMBER\n\nDipaFestival\n\nShamane\n\n6000000\n\nStarLight\n\n9LRC9ZN\n\nVERSIONUPDATE\n\nGREENLAKE\n\nJESSICA\n\nGACHAGAMING\n\nENTERTHESHOW\n\nHow to redeem Reverse 1999 codes\n\nIf you want to redeem a code in Reverse 1999, you'll need to complete the opening tutorial of the game, which introduces you to the combat system and story. Once you complete the opening stage in the story mode, which is called '1st 01 Wretched Brats', you'll be able to redeem an exchange code.\n\nOnce the code function unlocks, there's a few steps you need to follow to access the code menu. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\nLaunch Reverse 1999 on your device.\n\nOn the main menu, select the button at the bottom of the left bar menu.\n\nA new menu will then pop up with a few different options. Choose 'Settings'.\n\nThis will take you to another menu screen. Press the 'Go' button next to 'Exchange Code Reward' in the 'Account' tab.\n\nA menu with a textbox will then appear. Type in a code and then press the 'Confirm' button'.\n\nIf the code you entered is active, an animation will appear on screen and you'll see all of the in-game goodies you've just claimed for Reverse 1999."
