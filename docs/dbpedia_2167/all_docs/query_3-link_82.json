        "text": "When Cassie Posey met fellow Greenville residents Jared Burger and Johnny Puleo at a pool party in 2009, she never imagined it would lead to a longstanding musical association.\n\n“I was playing guitar at the time, just randomly jamming out, and the guys came up and wanted to tag along and play some stuff with me,” Posey said. “And we decided, after the first couple of times that we jammed together, that we probably wanted to start writing some stuff. There was just all this chemistry between us.”\n\nThe collaboration eventually led to the creation of Signs of Iris, which has blossomed into one of the Upstate's most popular indie rock bands.\n\nPosey, the group's lead vocalist, switched from guitar to synthesizers soon after she began playing with Burger and Puleo. Then, after going through several bass players, Signs of Iris was solidified with the addition of James Litzie.\n\n“James is actually our eighth bass player,” Posey said. “He was a fan basically from the beginning, back when we just had (lousy) little demos and stuff.\n\n“He was always the one who knew every single line of all of our songs. And he just got sick and tired of seeing us with a different bass player at every show. So, he went on Craigslist, found a bass and learned to play it.”\n\nDid Litzie at least have some previous musical background?\n\n“Not at all, nothing; he played video games,” Posey said with a light chuckle.\n\nUnsure that Litzie would work out, Signs of Iris chose to name its 2011 debut album, “Here's to Nueve.”\n\n“The joke was that if James didn't work out, 'Here's to the ninth bass player,' ” Posey said.\n\nLitzie, however, is still in the band, which will celebrate the release of its newest album, “Cyclops,” with a performance Friday at The Radio Room in Greenville.\n\n“What's really awesome about our band is that we've all grown basically at the same rate,” Posey said. “There's not one person who's way better than everyone else. And we all helped each other throughout (the making of) this entire album.”\n\nSigns of Iris, whose members are all in their mid-20s, recorded “Cyclops,” at Three Big Guys Records, a Greenville-based studio run by Burger.\n\n“This time we went into the studio with a clean slate and wrote all the songs there,” Posey said. “We were really relaxed. There was no worrying about time limit or anything.\n\n“And we just put all of our emotion into the record, and we're very, very pleased with it.”\n\nThe band's distinctive sound is a mesh of 1980s-flavored synth-pop and '90s grunge-era guitar riffs.\n\nPosey said that the male members of the group draw inspiration from such artists as Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Modest Mouse and Cake, while she tends to gravitate more toward such female-led bands as No Doubt and Paramore.\n\n“All of us have such different influences, which I think is the reason our music is all over the place,” Posey said.\n\nIn the past, Signs of Iris has performed as far away as New York and Texas, and the band has plans to tour again next year in support of “Cyclops.”\n\n“We would like to wake up in a different city every day, but if that doesn't happen, it doesn't happen,” Posey said. “We're happy with what we're doing now, which is playing music for anybody and everybody who will listen to it.”\n\nWho: Signs of Iris with Andy D and R. Garcia When: 9 p.m. Friday Where: The Radio Room, 2845 N. Pleasantburg Drive, Greenville Info: 864-263-7868 or www.wpbrradioroom.com\n\nWant to go?"
