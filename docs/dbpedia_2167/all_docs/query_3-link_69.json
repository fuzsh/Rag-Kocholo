        "text": "Chattanooga-based band Signs Following is set to release their debut self-titled album later this year. They have already shared the single “The Last Great Mystery,” which came out in early March.\n\nToday, they drop their latest single, “Cicada,” which offers a more ambient folk sound compared to their previous release. The track is rich in textured instrumentation, featuring guitar, synths, and an organ.\n\nThe production quality of this song is impressive, particularly given the challenges of layering ambient instrumentation.\n\nAfter just a few listens, we’re reminded of early Akron/Family. These singles are generating a lot of excitement for the band’s debut album.\n\nFollow the band on Instagram here.\n\nSee our post about the first single, “The Last Great Mystery.”\n\nHear “Cicada” below."
