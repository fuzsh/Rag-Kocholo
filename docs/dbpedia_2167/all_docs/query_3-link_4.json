Prunus\n\nThis Swedish instrumental band is on to something truly special on their new album &quot;Signs&quot;. \r\nIt is their fourth album (the previous one came out 7 yrs ago) and they have also slightly changed their bandname from Trio Gordon to Gårdon.\r\n\r\nSometimes you don&#39;t need to rush. \r\nThe music will take you there, in the end. \r\n\r\nThe many styles and inspiration are with ease flowing through this free,soulful and non-compromising album. \r\n\r\nYou might find parts on &quot;Signs&quot; where the album is transformed right into postrock-land as well as stoner rock, shiny pop, cinematic moods and improvised jams. There&#39;s no boundaries on &quot;Signs&quot; \r\n\r\nAll is going on and it fits beautifully as it&#39;s performed by an open minded band that deliver the goods, no matter what. \r\n\r\nSing a song fighter is very proud to be a part of releasing this amazing album. \r\n\r\n&quot;Before recording this album we spent a lot of time just jamming and rehearsing. We did simple sketches and threw ideas around with a lot of space for improvisation and variations. \r\n\r\nSo, when we finally got to the studio we felt curious ourselves about what was going to happen and put to tape. And we continued to experiment and trying out ideas throughout the recording sessions which differs a lot from our previous albums where we often had fully written songs when we entered the studio.\r\n\r\nAnd during the recording sessions these compositions all grew into some thematic world of light and darkness, major and minor, two sides of a coin.\r\n&quot;Signs&quot; is about humans eternal longing to find deeper meanings in symbols and signs in hope to better understand ourselves and our environment.&quot;",
