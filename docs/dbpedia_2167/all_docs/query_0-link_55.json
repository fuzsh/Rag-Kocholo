        "text": "Every time we turn on the news these days, there’s a subtle message being pumped at us from our screens - that this virus is taking over the world and we should be scared of everything we touch or go near. Plus, we’re never too far away from pointing the finger at where it all began - China! Not to mention the other political and racial unrest the world is currently facing. This week, in solidarity, as we’re all about to be freed from our social isolation, and we leave the comfort of our homes with our stashes of doomsday food (and if you’re lucky a pyramid of toilet paper) I wanted to write something light-hearted and fun about cultural astrology because hey, we all need a little fun escape sometimes - believers and skeptics alike! So now you can socialise again, with whom should you do so? Once you have refreshed your memory on which star signs you’re most compatible with here, you might want to know which year group is best for you too!\n\nYear of the Rat (1924, 1936, 1948, 1960, 1972, 1984, 1996, 2008, 2020)\n\nPeople born in the year of the Rabbit, are generally quiet individuals, with a responsible disposition. They are kind souls however because they are quite elegant, can sometimes come off as snobbish. This is because they are smart and self assured, not to mention capable and social chameleons of sorts, but can struggle to prioritise things in their life including friendships. They are open strategists always looking to move upwards and onwards and tend to be more professionally than personally motivated.\n\nBEST FRIENDS: the Rat, the Goat, the Monkey, The Dog and the Pig.\n\nFRENEMIES: the Rooster.\n\nYear of the Dragon (1928, 1940, 1952, 1964, 1976, 1988, 2000, 2012, 2024)\n\nPeople born in the year of the Snake, are the some of the wisest people. They possess emotional intelligence and draw people in with their enigmatic nature. These friends are tactful and self-possessed, yet persistent when they need to be. They don’t give up easily.\n\nBEST FRIENDS: the Dragon and the Rooster.\n\nFRENEMIES: the Pig\n\nYear of the Horse (1930, 1942, 1954, 1966, 1978, 1990, 2002, 2014, 2026)\n\nPeople born in the year of the Horse, are animated and energetic. They are active mentally and physically and easily restless and impatient. They are sometimes considered wanderers as they don’t stick at anything for too long, but this is because they like to have goals to work towards and are naturally forward thinkers and planners.\n\nBEST FRIENDS: the Goat and the Tiger.\n\nFRENEMIES: the Rat\n\nYear of the Goat (1931, 1943, 1955, 1967, 1979, 1991, 2003, 2015, 2027)\n\nPeople born in the year of the Goat, are gentle modest souls. Real nurturers they are calm and deeply sympathetic, also known to be sensitive. On the downside the goat can be gullible, a follower and temperamental at best. The most modest of the signs, they help friends in a supportive role, but friends need to equally support and encourage them to remember themselves as self-worth and esteem can be prominent issues.\n\nBEST FRIENDS: the Rabbit, the Horse and the Pig.\n\nFRENEMIES: the Ox\n\nYear of the Monkey (1932, 1944, 1956, 1968, 1980, 1992, 2004, 2016, 2028)\n\nPeople born in the year of the Monkey, are cheeky, sharp and curious. Don’t underestimate them by their playful nature though, as they are smarter than you think and consider themselves problem solvers. They can also be quite cunning and they know this as they are also very self-aware.\n\nBEST FRIENDS: the Ox and the Rabbit.\n\nFRENEMIES: the Tiger\n\nYear of the Rooster (1933, 1945, 1957, 1969, 1981, 1993, 2005, 2017, 2029)\n\nPeople born in the year of the Dog, are the most emotional and prudently loyal friends. They will always be honest, and can at times be brutal with that honesty. Don’t worry though, their bark is worse than their bite! They are determined yet serene. They are sociable, friendly and well liked, however prefer to have one or 2 close friends than a group.\n\nBEST FRIENDS: the Rabbit.\n\nFRENEMIES: The Dragon\n\nYear of the Pig (1935, 1947, 1959, 1971, 1983, 1995, 2007, 2019, 2031)\n\nPeople born in the year of the Pig, are generous and compassionate. They possess a diligence lacking in many other signs which makes them persistent friends. They are powerful, and supportive friends when they find the time to be, however thrive in more practical or professional fields than personal relationships as they charge their way forward in life.\n\nBEST FRIENDS: the Goat, the Tiger and the Rabbit.\n\nFRENEMIES: the Snake\n\nHow does this weigh up for you? Is your best friend compatible, or did you marry a frenemy like I did? Lol\n\nThis gives you some insight into who you’re compatible with based on what year you were both born.
