        "text": "Our band plays good, fun rock & roll to make you shake your booty, bang your head and sing until your voice is gone! We have 6 well polished instrumentalists consisting of drums, percussion, bass, guitars (electric and acoustic), and keyboards. Our vocal leads are split between 3 of us up front and our 3-4 part harmonies are very rich. We came together in piece-meal fashion....3 of us played in one band together for years, 2 of us play together in a contemporary church ensemble, 2 of us know each other from other music projects, one group introduced another group to each other, and then brought in 2 others, and then they met the other 2 and then, well, you get the picture.\n\nEveryone comes from diverse backgrounds, but music is a definite common love amongst us all. In our day jobs, we have a surgeon, traveling sales, marketing folks, free-lance photographer, a teacher, and a chef. We like to think that all of this has mixed together well and helped us grow both artistically and as a managed group. It definitely keeps things interesting. We have a ton of music in our set list and it truly covers everything from hard rock, dance, alternative, a little bit of country, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, well into 2013, and we just want to constantly grow. We have even played some private events where we learn songs on the fly, or just bring an acoustic set in with a few of us performing. Some of the music that influences us and which we also cover consists of music from the Rolling Stones, REO Speedwagon, Journey, Styx, U2, Pink, Elton John, B52s, Blondie, Sugarland, Bon Jovi, Counting Crows, Snow Patrol, to name a few, all played very genuinely, or with our own edgier manner. Based in DuPage County, the original core of the band has performed throughout the Chicagoland club circuit, including Penny Road Pub (South Barrington Hills), Cabaret Grill & Bar (Naperville), Two Rivers Sports Bar (Bolingbrook), John's Buffet (Wheaton), U.S. Beer Company (Chicago), River Bend (Cary), Ye Olde Town Inn (Mt. Prospect), Rivers (Chicago), Waukegan Yacht Club (Waukegan), Brother Jimmy's (Chicago), Streets Of Chicago (Elgin), Ballydoyles (Downers Grove), Wrightwood Tap (Chicago), The Cubby Bear (Lincolnshire), Synergy II (Winfield), Walter Payton’s Roundhouse (Aurora) Frankies Blue Room (Naperville), McNally’s (St. Charles), Arrowhead Golf Club (Wheaton), Real Time Sports Bar (St. Charles) and more. Vital Signs has also left its mark at area festivals, including the DuPage County Fair (Wheaton), Taste of Glen Ellyn, Ribfest (Naperville), SchaumburgFest (Schaumburg), Chocolate Festival (Long Grove), Good 'Ol Days (Winfield), CornFest (Bloomingdale), PrairieFest (Oswego), and AutumnFest (Wheaton), Strawberryfest (Long Grove), Taste Of Wheaton and Applefest (Long Grove). Plus, Vital Signs has provided the entertainment at many special events and parties. Sponsors have included Lucent Technologies, Central DuPage Hospital, Skytel, Schaumburg Park District, Naperville Chamber of Commerce, Elgin Police Department, American Cancer Society, ABC Valuline Buying Group (Food Service industry) and others."
