        "text": "It had been a good minute — 12 years, in fact — since Creed hit a stage in the metro area.\n\nBut it felt like no time had passed at all on Wednesday night, Aug. 31, at the Pine Knob Music Theatre.\n\nThe quartet’s comeback tour is titled Summer of ’99, referencing the 25th anniversary of its multi-platinum sophomore album “Human Clay” (which actually came out during September of that year). But even though it was a hallmark of a particular period in music — the post-grunge and post-thrash heavy rock that dominated during the early 2000s — it’s aged better than perhaps many expected, and that its haters would have liked.\n\nSongs such as “Higher,” “With Arms Wide Open,” “Are You Ready?” and “What If” sounded as current on Wednesday night as they did back in 1999. And, to the band’s credit, they would have sounded perfectly in place in 1979, and probably will in 2039.\n\nThe timelessness in Creed’s brawny, often melodic brand of rock — and of opening acts 3 Doors Down and Finger Eleven — and in the lyrics’ philosophical expressions of existential angst was well-displayed throughout the group’s 100-minute show. Frontman Scott Stapp even remarked that the unity anthem “One,” from 1998, was inspired by “living in a world that was so divided and polarized” and drew parallels to the present day situation. “Don’t you know that’s what they want — divide/control….We are stronger together.”\n\nStrength was certainly no issue as the quartet, abetted by second guitarist Eric Friedman from Mark Tremonti’s solo band, Creed delivered a muscular trip through the 12-year, four-album recording career that made it rock’s top act at the start of the century. Amidst columns of fire and smoke and a series of evocative videos on the five rear-stage panels, the black-clad Creed (bassist Brian Marshall’s camouflage pants were the most colorful garb any musician wore on Wednesday) came out firing “Bullets” and tore through another 15 songs with a confident force that was both polished and pulverizing.\n\n“Human Clay” was, of course, the “star” of the night with seven songs from the Diamond-certified set, but Creed touched on all bases — though just one, “Overcome,” from 2009’s “Full Circle” — including an epic rendition of “Faceless Man” and a main set-ending coupling of the anthems “With Arms Wide Open” and “Higher,” cell phone flashlights subbing for the Bic lighters of the summer of ’99.\n\nTremonti, who was raised in Grosse Pointe through his adolescence — and had a large cadre of family and friends at Pine Knob on Wednesday — told the crowd he was “so proud of being born about 40 minutes from here” before giving away the guitar he played during “Overcome” to a young fan named Ellie. Stapp, whose tank top revealed a lot of dedication to pumping iron, offered lengthy introductions for several of the songs and shared several warm moments with Tremonti, rapping his arm around the guitarist’s shoulders during the encore version of “One Last Breath.”\n\nThe metro are was, of course, was an early adaptor to Creed when the band’s first album, “My Own Prison” came out during 1997, but there was still a sizable response when Stapp asked how many fans were seeing the band for the first time. And he quickly got them to pledge to coming to another one — specifically November 20, when Creed returns to perform at Little Caesars Arena.\n\nCreed wasn’t the only band with a Detroit story on Wednesday’s bill, however. 3 Doors Down’s Brad Arnold warmly recalled a guest appearance by Bob Seger during the group’s 2005 show at the venue to sing “Landing in London,” which he’d recorded with band the previous year. Seger was of course not there on Wednesday, but the song got a well-received airing before 3 Doors Down wrapped things up with its hits “Kryptonite” and “When I’m Gone.”\n\nCreed, 3 Doors Down and Mammoth WVH perform at 7 p.m. Nov. 20 at Little Caesars Arena, 2645 Woodward Ave., Detroit. 313-471-7000 or 313Presents.com."
