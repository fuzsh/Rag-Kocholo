        "text": "Every concert venue must display band banners around the concert hall to promote their future bookings of performing artists. From Live military band concerts to annual university concert often held in the Spring time branding your name and the musicians in your band is crucial to your success.\n\nBands are not the only ones who can take advantage of promoting live gigs, venue owners, agents, road managers, Disc Jockeys, and show promoters can also utilize our tools to create a few awesome concert banners to communicate performance dates, attending venues, and current ticket information.\n\nLocal bands need a fan base and advertising is the key to getting the visibility and exposure they need. By branding your gigs and name properly using band signs, growing your fans with custom banners is easier than you might think.\n\nAs you are playing to existing fans, using banners to let fans know where your next session will be is a great way to get concert goers to follow you as you tour to the clubs and concert halls you play at.\n\nPlacing large format band banners behind the stage, is also an effective way of educating the listeners about your band name. Branding is important, and some of the crowd attending your gig may not be aware of your band name. If they like your sound, they will want to attend your next concert, so by branding your name with our signs ensures they will remember you.\n\nIn the front of your stage entice the first row by placing some smaller stage banners with special offers of CD's and MP3s they can buy or download. Usually the people who fought to the front to see you up close are your biggest fans, so this crowd is more likely to visit your site to get your next album, buy a CD of your music, or download your latest hits.\n\nUsing band yard signs for scheduled events, that you strategically place along intersections as you arrive in the city where your concert will take place is a good marketing strategy to inform your fans and music lovers about your up and coming concert.\n\nMaking your rock band signs to include your name, and any designs that inspire you is a breeze using our online designing tools. Customize any of the designs we have created to include slogans, the style of music you play, and upload graphics and photos to make your signs reflect your band's personality.\n\nAfter you are finished customizing your designs to reflect your band properly, choose any of the sign products we offer for print."
