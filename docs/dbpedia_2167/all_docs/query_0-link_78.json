        "text": "The Florida Board of Bar Examiners now requires all applicants to be fingerprinted electronically by IdentoGO by MorphoTrust USA. IdentoGO by MorphoTrust USA has 69 locations across the State of Florida.\n\nApplicants must arrange to be fingerprinted prior to submitting the Bar Application, Student Registration, or CLI Registration. Processing of the application or registration cannot begin until the board has received confirmation (either a receipt provided by an applicant or notification directly from IdentoGO by MorphoTrust USA) that the fingerprints have been taken or scanned. The fee to have fingerprints processed by IdentoGO by MorphoTrust USA is $53.25 plus tax.\n\nApplicants who live in Florida should go to IdentoGO by MorphoTrust USA. Follow the instructions found there (under \"Digital Fingerprinting\" select \"Schedule a New Appointment\") in order to schedule an appointment to be fingerprinted and to pay the required fee. In order to take a bar examination, applicants must be fingerprinted by IdentoGO by MorphoTrust USA on or before that examination's filing deadline.\n\nApplicants who live outside of Florida:\n\nHave a standard fingerprint card completed by an authorized law enforcement agency.\n\nMake one copy of the fingerprint card to be sent to the Board of Bar Examiners with your application materials.\n\nGo to IdentoGO by MorphoTrust USA;\n\nSelect \"Florida\" under \"Search for services by state\";\n\nClick on \"Digital Fingerprinting\";\n\nClick \"Register for Fingerprint Card Processing Service\";\n\nSelect \"Florida Board of Bar Examiners\" from the drop down menu;\n\nRead the three steps required to continue the registration process and click \"yes\" if you wish to continue;\n\nComplete the Personal Information;\n\nProceed to arrange payment to IdentoGO by clicking on the \"Continue to US Bank E-Pay\" button;\n\nIn order to take a bar examination, the original, completed fingerprint card must be postmarked by that examination's filing deadline. Mail the original fingerprint card to the address displayed subsequent to arranging payment:\n\nMorphoTrust USA Florida Card Scan Operations\n\nc/o Prints, Inc.\n\n100 Salem Ct.\n\nTallahassee, FL 32301\n\nIn either case, upload a copy of the receipt to the board via your portal. All questions regarding fingerprint submissions should be directed to IdentoGO by MorphoTrust USA at (844)-321-2124.\n\nIMPORTANT: Applicants must submit the Bar Application, Student Registration, or CLI Registration within six months of being fingerprinted. Failure to do so will result in having to be re-fingerprinted at the applicant's expense.\n\nThe Florida Board of Bar Examiners has a long history of providing reasonable accommodations to applicants with documented disabilities, well before the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990.\n\nBar Application Process - If you need an accommodation because of a disability to participate in the Bar Application process, please notify the Executive Director of the Florida Board of Bar Examiners. The board does not assess a surcharge on a particular bar applicant with a disability or any group of bar applicants with disabilities to cover the costs of providing reasonable accommodations.\n\nGeneral Bar Examination Accommodations - Testing accommodations forms are available in PDF format for printing. Refer to rule 4-17 for additional information. The applicable items specified in the Petition Checklist must be completed and postmarked or received by the board on or before the filing deadline of the examination you plan to take.\n\nApplicants with disabilities are entitled to, and have the responsibility to meet, the same deadline to apply as individuals without disabilities. As some of the forms require input from third parties, it is suggested that you request the appropriate individuals to complete the forms well in advance of the deadline for filing the petition for test accommodations, so that late filing fees are not incurred.\n\nA timely petition requesting an accommodation for the February administration of the General Bar Examination must be postmarked or received not later than November 15 prior to the examination.\n\nA timely petition requesting an accommodation for the July administration of the General Bar Examination must be postmarked or received not later than May 1 prior to the examination.\n\nApplicants seeking to file an untimely petition will be permitted to do so on payment of a late fee as specified under rule 4-43. Petitions received after January 15 for the February examination and after June 15 for the July examination will not be accepted due to the time required to process a petition and accompanying documentation for review by the board, to reach a determination on the petition and to make necessary arrangements at the examination site."
