        "text": "What causes addiction to opioids?\n\nIt is not yet known why some people become addicted to opioids and others do not. Typically, opioids produce pain relief and, for some people, euphoria ― a sense of heightened well-being. Experiencing euphoria after taking opioids may be a warning sign of vulnerability to opioid addiction. This euphoria can even occur in people using opioids as prescribed by their doctor.\n\nEarly in the process of opioid use disorder, people may take an opioid drug because of the pleasurable effect. Over time, the pleasant sensations diminish. A person may take opioids more frequently or at higher doses to restore the euphoria or, as the condition progresses, to avoid withdrawal symptoms.\n\nTaking an opioid regularly increases the risk of becoming addicted. The time it takes to become physically dependent varies from person to person, but it is usually a couple of weeks. Taking an opioid for a day or two is not a problem for most people, but some studies show that even the first dose can have physiological effects that can make someone vulnerable to opioid use disorder.\n\nSymptoms of Opioid Use Disorder\n\nOUD is characterized by symptoms such as the following.\n\nPhysical dependence: This is a physiological change that occurs when using a substance. When the person stops taking the drug, they experience withdrawal symptoms such as cravings and sweating.\n\nIt is important to understand that a person can be physically dependent on opioids without unhealthy use. For example, a patient with cancer who has chronic pain may be physically dependent on opioids but not addicted to them.\n\nIncreasingly heavy, frequent, unhealthy or risky use: The person continues to use an opioid even though it causes problems with health, safety, financial security or personal relationships. A person with an opioid use disorder is unable to control the use of opioids, and behaviors associated with getting and using opioids increasingly interfere with daily life.\n\nCravings: These are overwhelming physical and emotional urges to take the drug, despite an understanding of potential consequences to well-being.\n\nOther signs of an opioid use disorder: Someone struggling with an opioid use disorder may not show signs right away. Over time, there may be some signals that the person needs help, such as:\n\nDrowsiness\n\nChanges in sleep habits\n\nWeight loss\n\nFrequent flu-like symptoms\n\nDecreased libido\n\nLack of hygiene\n\nChanges in exercise habits\n\nIsolation from family members or friends\n\nStealing from family members, friends or businesses\n\nNew financial difficulties\n\nEven when suffering from a substance use disorder, a person may deny that the problem is serious and resist efforts to help for a long time. When ready and willing to start a recovery process, it is important for the person to have access to resources and to start treatment as quickly as possible.\n\nOpioid Use Disorder Treatment\n\nOpioid use disorder is a complex disease, and treatment works best when tailored to the individual. There is not a single approach that works well for everyone, and a person may try several therapies before finding the ones that support lasting recovery.\n\nTreatment for opioid use disorder is available from health care professionals and may be provided on an outpatient basis or through a residential program such as a rehabilitation center (rehab). Treatment in any of these settings may include use of medications such as methadone, buprenorphine or naltrexone, paired with support programs that can help people recover.\n\nHospital treatment is rare for opioid use disorder alone. People with substance use disorders may go to hospital emergency rooms because they are in crisis due to physical or emotional distress. Most hospitals provide an evaluation and assess the patient’s primary need, and then connect the patient to treatment. The hospital may admit someone who also has a significant medical problem in addition to the opioid use disorder.\n\nOpioid overdose treatment with naloxone can be used in an emergency situation when a person has taken an overdose of opioid drugs and has stopped breathing or is in danger of stopping breathing. Naloxone flushes the narcotic out of the brain’s receptors and can reverse the overdose, but it does not address the underlying opioid use disorder as addiction treatment would.\n\nOpioid Withdrawal Treatment (Detoxification)\n\nThe first part of treatment is addressing withdrawal ― helping the person rid the body of the opioid. When a person with a physical dependence on opioids stops taking them, they experience withdrawal symptoms within six to 24 hours. The amount of time depends on the drug the person has been taking. Withdrawal from opioids can cause:\n\nSweating\n\nChills\n\nAnxiety\n\nAgitation\n\nMuscle aches\n\nInsomnia\n\nAbdominal cramping\n\nNausea\n\nVomiting\n\nWithdrawal symptoms may increase in severity over 72 hours before beginning to ease. Unlike withdrawal from other drugs such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, withdrawal from opioids is uncomfortable but rarely life-threatening. Treatment can include supportive measures to ease symptoms and help ensure the person is safe, including administering methadone or buprenorphine.\n\nOnce the drugs are out of the person’s system, continuing treatment is recommended to avoid relapse ― resuming opioid use after quitting.\n\nOutpatient and Residential Substance Use Disorder Treatment\n\nThe person with the opioid use disorder may decide on outpatient treatment or enter a rehabilitation facility for more concentrated therapy. Treatment costs and insurance coverage vary. Consult with your insurance provider for specifics.\n\nCounseling for Opioid Use Disorder\n\nOpioid use disorder interferes with many aspects of a person’s life. Counseling and behavior therapy can help a person address underlying thoughts and behaviors associated with unhealthy opioid use and learn ways to counteract them.\n\nDepending on the treatment center, group therapy, relapse prevention training, vocational and educational services, community-based or family-based support, mental health assessment and other resources may be available to help support continued recovery.\n\nDrugs for Addiction\n\nSeveral drugs are available that can help people discontinue opioid use by reducing cravings or blocking the pleasant feelings that opioids cause.\n\nThese drugs can be part of a person’s therapy for opioid use disorder. They are therapeutic treatments, not substitutes for the drugs causing the person’s problem. Patients who are highly motivated and have good social support tend to do better with the support of these medications.\n\nMethadone is a medicine provided in a clinic or inpatient setting to treat opioid use disorder. Methadone helps with withdrawal symptoms and cravings. It can be taken as a pill, liquid or wafer. It can also be prescribed by doctors to treat pain.\n\nAnother medicine, buprenorphine, also relieves opioid cravings but without producing euphoria. Prescribed by many physicians from office settings, this is typically taken in a daily dose placed under the tongue. It also can be delivered as a once-per-month injection or through thin tubes inserted under the skin that last six months.\n\nBoth methadone and buprenorphine activate tiny parts of nerve cells (opioid receptors) to control cravings, and they are effective and similar in safety and side effects. They may be used as maintenance treatments and, in some cases, to taper off opioid use.\n\nNaltrexone is very different from methadone and buprenorphine. It does not turn the opioid receptor on, but instead blocks the euphoric and sedative effects of opioids. A patient’s system must be completely free of all opioids before beginning to take naltrexone. It can be taken orally or as a once-per-month injection. Training in administration of naloxone for a loved one with substance use disorder is offered in most communities."
