        "text": "roman around releases their new single “Star Signs,” available January 26th on Digital Formats via Trailing Twelve Records.\n\nFresno, California-based roman around share their haunting and muscular “Star Signs,” set for digital release on January 26th through Trailing Twelve Records. The band acts as a vehicle for the songs of Roman Rivera, an accomplished drummer and multi-instrumentalist. Rivera identifies as non-binary and pansexual, an identity they are proud to represent within the LGBTQ community. With both Mexican and Native American heritage, Rivera grew up in a community of spirituality and was quick to note the wide acceptance of astrology within their friends and family.\n\nThe brooding and expansive soundscape of “Star Signs” sets the sonic groundwork for an incisive critique of popular astrology and a culture of commodified spirituality. Rivera’s songwriting strikes a balance between insightful criticism and personal reflection, offering flippant astrological inquiry [“but you never touch the sunlight / who does it tell you to love?”] along with angst-fueled resolutions [“to hell with my fake friends / they don’t ever like my presence”].\n\nRivera shares the personal experiences that spurred “Star Signs” below.\n\nI started noticing trends in the way people around me were using astrology. It seemed to become less of a spiritual experience for people to find themselves and more of a rubric to judge others and avoid responsibility. Like I'm not a bad person because I'm a Sagittarius, and you're not a bad person cause you're a Pisces. Each sign is beautiful and the possibilities for your potential are endless!\n\n“Star Signs” blends dazzling percussion, cosmic synths, and burly bass tones to build a seismic production that beautifully contrasts Rivera’s airy and emotionally raspy vocal. Recorded entirely in their home studio in Fresno, Rivera shares some additional detail on the production process below.\n\nI spent a good amount of time just dialing in the drum sounds. I set out synths, bass tone, and exotic elements from there. I found a sample pack of different animals and found interesting ways of working them into the song. Before the first chorus, I used a sample of wind chimes that my dog ran into. There’s an elephant sample midway through the song too.\n\nThe magic of “Star Signs” is in the driving rhythm, haunting atmosphere, and Rivera’s vocal - a tone that is both angelic and ominous. While their cynical take on popular astrology may be up for debate, the raw talent and promise of roman around shines on “Star Sign.”\n\n“Star Signs” is out January 26th, 2022 on Digital Formats via Trailing Twelve.\n\nWatch the lyric video for “Star Signs” below.\n\nBIO\n\nroman around is an American rock band from Fresno, California, formed in 2020. The band is a vehicle for the songs of Roman Rivera and consists of Roman Rivera (vocals, guitar), Justin Vogel (bass, keys, vocals), Chevas Vandel (keys, vocals), and Luke Schafer (drums).\n\nWith both Mexican and Native American heritage, Rivera grew up in a community of spirituality and music. Rivera first honed their skills as a drummer before becoming a fully-fledged multi-instrumentalist. In their late teenage years, after touring the country as a drummer for various bands, Rivera began experimenting with writing their own music. Years of communal exposure to beat making, singing, guitar, and drumming allowed them to quickly craft their own vision.\n\nroman around's sound blends hypnotic rhythms, hazy atmospheres, and shadowy textures that will please fans of From Indian Lakes, Cocteau Twins, DIIV, and Toro Y Moi.\n\nRivera is currently attending CSU Fresno and working as a music teacher while they continue to write, release, and perform music via roman around. Rivera identifies as non-binary and pansexual, an identity they are proud to represent within the LGBTQ community.\n\nTheir debut single “Star Signs” premiered on the award-winning radio station KCRW."
