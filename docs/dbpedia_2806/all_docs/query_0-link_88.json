        "text": "HYDERABAD: Acting Sindh Governor Agha Siraj Durrani on Saturday inaugurated the 274th Urs of great Sufi saint Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai here.\n\nThe acting governor was accompanied by Ghulam Shah Jeelani, Special Assistant to CM for Auqaf.\n\nThe devotees listened traditional raag of Shah Latif on the shrineâ€™s premises.\n\nTalking to media, Durrani said that he had visited the shrine to pay tribute to the great sufi saint.\n\nHe said that all possible efforts would be made for strengthening democracy in the country.\n\nHe added that present political scenario does not reflect any favour for ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif.\n\nReplying to a question, the acting governor said that the Pakistan People's Party had always honored the judiciary, therefore, it expects the same conduct from Nawaz Sharif to face cases.\n\nThe development of Bhit Shah has always been on the top priority of PPP government. District Council Matiari Chairman Makhdoom Fakhar Zaman has been putting efforts for the development of the area. PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is also taking keen interest as he is likely to visit the shrine in the next couple of days, Durrani added.\n\nReplying to a question regarding recent harassment cases of girl students at the universities, he said that once investigation is completed, the culprits will be brought to the justice.\n\nAgha Siraj Durrani also inaugurated the Cultural Village and Agricultural Exhibition during annual Urs celebrations."
