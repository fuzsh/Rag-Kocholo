        "text": "One of the most popular qawwalis of the sub-continent, Dam Dam Mast Kalandar, Ali Da Pehla Number….. Sindhri Da, Sehwan Da, Sakhi Shahbaz Kalandar, invokes the name of the Sindhi Sufi Lal Shahbaz. The verse demonstrates the mystic’s deep love for Imam Ali, which is inscribed on his grave : “I am a slave of Ali Murtaza.”\n\nLal Shahbaz’s name was Syed Usman Shah. He later acquired the title of Lal (red) due to his habit of wearing red garments, and Shahbaz, Royal Falcon, for his soaring divinity. Born to the mystic Syed Ibrahim Kabiruddin, Lal Shahbaz’s family drew their lineage from Imam Jafar Sadiq, a descendant of Imam Ali. The family came from Sistan, an Iranian province that borders Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nOverwhelmingly adored alike by Hindus and Muslims of Sind, Lal Shahbaz arrived in Multan in 1263, eventually settling in Sehwan, a famous centre of learning. The earlier name for Sehwan was Sivistan, the city of Lord Shiva. Lal Shahbaz settled on the outskirts of the town for six years during which he provided spiritual guidance to thousands of people.\n\nLal Shahbaz resided at the site of an old Shiv temple on the west bank of the Indus. He made his home in a hollow tree trunk where he performed his ascetic exercises. The area now a walled-garden, is known as Lal Bagh, whose sweet water springs that irrigate it are attributed to the miracles of Lal Shahbaz. He encouraged his followers to use dance as a way of achieving spiritual ecstasy, a tradition still followed at is dragah, accompanied with dhamaal and drums.\n\nLal Shahbaz live during the age of the famous Sufis including Baba Farid of Ajodhan, Shaykh Bahauddin Zakariya of Multan, and Jalaluddin Bukhari of Uch. They remained close friends and came to be called “chaar yaar” —— the four companions.\n\nLal Shahbaz claimed to be the spiritual disciple of Mansur Hallaj, the 10th century martyred mystic pot of Baghdad. An erudite scholar, Lal Shahbaz was fluent in Arabic, Persian, Sanskrit and Sindhi. Several books in Persian and Arabic poetry and on philology are attributed to him. Later, Sindhi mystics, including Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, Makhdoom Bilawal, Sachal Sarmast and Qadir Bakhsh Bedil, were devout followers of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar. He died in 1274 AD and a stunning mausoleum with Sindhi tiles, mirror work and gold-plated doors stands over his grave.\n\nThe Hindus lovingly address Lal Shahbaz as “Jhule Lal”, Lord of the Indus River. Even now, at the annual Urs, one of the old caretakers, a Hindu, performs the inaugural ritual for the annual festivities. Despite the Partition of India, the environment of Sehwan Sharif is an extraordinary demonstration of Hindu-Muslim syncretism of the sub-continent.\n\n———— Sadia Dehlvi\n\nSHIRDI SAI BABA (1838 — 1918) was a spiritual master who was and is regarded, by his devotees as an avatar of God, saint, fakir and sadguru. He was revered by both his Muslim and Hindu devotees and during, as well as after his life on earth, it remained uncertain if he was a Muslim or Hindu himself.\n\nSai Baba stressed the importance of surrender to the guidance of the true Sadguru or Murshad, who, having gone the path to Divine consciousness himself, will lead the disciple through the jungle of spiritual training. The name “SAI” was given to him, upon his arrival at Shirdi, a town in the west Indian state of Maharashtra. SAI or SAYI is a Persian title given to Sufi saints, meaning ‘poor one’ and in Banjara language SAYI means ‘good one.’ BABA means ‘Father’ in many Indian and Middle Eastern Languages. Thus, SAI BABA denotes “Holy Father” or “Saintly Father.” Sai Baba remains a very popular Master, especially in India. He had no love for perishable things and his sole concern was self-realization. He taught a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace and devotion to God.\n\nHis teachings combined elements of Hinduism and Islam. He gave the Hindu name DWARAKAMAYI to the mosque he lived in, practised Muslim rituals, taught, using words and figures from both traditions. One of the well-known epigrams “MALIK EK” (ONE GOD) is associated with Islam and Sufism. He always uttered ALLAH MALIK (GOD IS KING). Sai Baba came to Shirdi when he was about 16yrs old. He led an ascetic life, sitting motionless under a neem tree and meditating while sitting in an asana. He stayed in Shirdi for 3yrs, disappeared for a year, and returned permanently around 1858.\n\nAround this time, he adopted his style of dress of a knee-length one-piece ——— KAFNI ROBE and a CLOTH CAP ——– articles of typical Sufi clothing. This attire contributed to Baba’s identification as a Muslim Fakir. His manner was said to be withdrawn and uncommunicative a s he undertook long periods of meditation. He was, eventually, persuaded to take up residence in an old and dilapidated mosque, and lived a solitary life there, surviving by begging for alms and receiving itinerant Hindu or Muslim visitors. —— In the mosque he maintained a sacred fire (DHUNI). He performed the function of a local HAKIM and treated the sick with the sacred ashes of the DHUNI. He also delivered spiritual teachings, recommending the reading of Sacred Hindu Texts along with the Qur’an. He insisted on the indispensability of the unbroken remembrance of God’s name (DHIKR, JAPA).\n\nAfter 1910, Sai Baba’s fame began to spread in Mumbai. People regarded him as a saint and they built his 1st temple at Bhivpuri, Karjat. He also emphasised the importance of performing one’s duties without attachment to earthly matters and of being content —— regardless of situations.\n\nThe Sai Baba Mandir, in Shirdi, is visited by around 20,000 pilgrims a day. The Shirdi Sai Movement has spread to the Caribbean and to countries such as the US, Australia, UAE, Malaysia and Singapore."
