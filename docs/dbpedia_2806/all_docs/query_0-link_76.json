        "text": "Etymology\n\nThe Persian word darvīsh (درویش) is of ancient origin and descends from a Proto-Iranian word that appears in Avestan as drigu-, “needy, mendicant”. The Iranian word is probably further cognate with theVedic Sanskrit word adhrigu-, an epithet of uncertain meaning applied to several deities. The Vedic word is probably to be analysed as a-dhrigu-, that is “not dhrigu-,” perhaps “not poor”, i.e. “rich.” The existence of this Vedic cognate suggests that the institution of the holy mendicant was as prominent among the ancient Indo-Iranian people as it has been historically in later Iran in the form of dervish brotherhoods and also in India in the form of the various schools ofsannyasis. However, because the etymology of the word is not apparent from the point of view of the modern Persian language, there have been attempts to make the parts of the word interpretable in terms of contemporary words and with reference to Sufic mystical concepts. Dar in Persian means “a door”, so Dervish is said to literally mean “one who opens the doors”. The Persian word also gives terms for “ascetic” in some languages, as in the Urdu phrase darveshaneh tabi’at, “an unflappable or ascetic temperament”.\n\nReligious practice\n\nMany Dervishes are mendicant ascetics who have taken a vow of poverty, unlikemullahs. The main reason they beg is to learn humility, but Dervishes are prohibited to beg for their own good. They have to give the collected money to other poor people. Others work in common professions; Egyptian Qadiriyya – known in Turkey as Kadiri – are fishermen, for example.\n\nSome classical writers indicate that the poverty of the Dervish is not merely economic.Saadi, for instance, who himself travelled widely as a dervish, and wrote extensively about them, says in his Gulistan,\n\nOf what avail is frock, or rosary,\n\nOr clouted garment? Keep thyself but free\n\nFrom evil deeds, it will not need for thee\n\nTo wear the cap of felt: a darwesh be\n\nIn heart, and wear the cap of Tartary.\n\nRumi writes in Book 1 of his Masnavi,\n\nWater that’s poured inside will sink the boat\n\nWhile water underneath keeps it afloat.\n\nDriving wealth from his heart to keep it pure\n\nKing Solomon preferred the title ‘Poor’:\n\nThat sealed jar in the stormy sea out there\n\nFloats on the waves because it’s full of air,\n\nWhen you’ve the air of dervishood inside\n\nYou’ll float above the world and there abide…\n\nOrders\n\nThere are various orders of Dervishes, almost all of which trace their origins from various Muslim saints and teachers, especially Ali andAbu Bakr. Various orders and suborders have appeared and disappeared over the centuries. Rifa’iyyah Dervishes spread into North Africa, Turkey, the Balkans, Iran, Pakistan, India, Afghanistanand Tajikistan.[clarification needed]\n\nOther groups include the Bektashis, connected to the janissaries, andSenussi, who are rather orthodox in their beliefs. Other fraternities and subgroups chant verses of the Qur’an, play drums or dance vigorously in groups, all according to their specific traditions. Some practice quiet meditation, as is the case with most of the Sufi orders in South Asia, many of whom owe allegiance to, or were influenced by, the Chishti order. Each fraternity uses its own garb and methods of acceptance and initiation, some of which may be rather severe.\n\nWhirling\n\nMain article: Sufi whirling\n\nThe whirling dance or Sufi whirling that is proverbially associated with Dervishes is best known in the West by the practices (performances) of the Mevlevi order in Turkey, and is part of a formal ceremony known as the Sama. It is, however, also practiced by other orders. The Sama is only one of the many Sufi ceremonies performed to try to reach religious ecstasy (majdhb, fana). The name Mevlevi comes from the Persian poet, Rumiwho was a Dervish himself. This practice, though not intended as entertainment, has become a tourist attraction in Turkey.\n\nHistorical and political use of the term\n\nVarious western historical writers have sometimes used the term dervish rather loosely, linking it to, among other things, the Mahdist uprising in Sudan, Mohammed Abdullah Hassan‘s 1920 conflict with British forces inSomalia, and other rebellions against colonialpowers.\n\nIn such cases, the term “Dervishes” may have been used as a generic (and often pejorative) term for the opposing Islamic entity and all members of its military, political and religious institutions, including persons who would not be considered “Dervishes” in the strict sense. (For example, a contemporary British drawing of the fighting in Sudan was entitled “The defeat of the Dervishes at Toski”, see History of Sudan (1884–1898)#British response.)\n\nBegging\n\nWhile commonly the term dervish is used to describe beggars, a differentiation between mendicant Dervishes and common beggars can be made:\n\n“While they walk around praising the Lord, anyone according to his own desire may voluntarily drop some coins in it (a kashkul)… a real dervish who wears the proper robe and carries the kashkul does not beg, nor does he make any demands.”\n\n,,,\n\n,,,"
