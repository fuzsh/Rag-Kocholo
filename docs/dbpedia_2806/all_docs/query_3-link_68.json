        "text": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s ruling alliance major ally, Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), has invited Sher Afzal Marwat, who was expelled today from Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) for violating party discipline, to join the PPP.\n\nThe invitation was extended by PPP National Assembly member Makhdoom Jameeluz Zaman. In a statement released by his spokesperson, Jameeluz Zaman expressed a desire for Marwat to join the PPP under the leadership of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, stating, “They can serve the nation together.”\n\nJameeluz Zaman will to meet Sher Afzal Marwat in Islamabad soon, the statement said.\n\nThis invitation follows PTI’s notification, signed by Additional Secretary General Firdous Shamim Naqvi, announcing Marwat’s suspension from the party which surprised PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan.\n\n“I don’t know who is issuing instructions and who is making decisions. It has not been brought to my knowledge that Imran Khan has issued any such instructions,” Barrister Gohar said while reacting on terminating the basic membership of Sher Afzal Marwat, who is the PTI MNA from Bannu, the northwestern district of Pakistan.\n\nThe PTI notification cited Marwat’s disregard for party rules and his negative impact on the party’s image as reasons for his suspension. It also suggested that Marwat should resign from his National Assembly seat, which he won as a PTI candidate, and seek re-election.\n\nEarlier, Marwat received a show-cause notice from PTI Secretary General Omar Ayub Khan on May 11 for violating the party’s code of conduct, which he was asked to address within three days."
