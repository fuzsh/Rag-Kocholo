        "text": "This update is meant to identify key developments during the month on Performance of Democratic Institutions in Pakistan with selected high-profile international developments included occasionally.\n\nSC declares the PTI eligible to receive reserved seats\n\nFirst Woman CJ of the LHC\n\nSC detailed opinion on Presidential Reference\n\nMr. Imran Khan’s detention termed as illegal, politically motivated\n\nMr. Imran Khan and spouse acquitted in Iddat case\n\nGovernment formally authorises the ISI to trace, intercept calls and messages in interest of ‘national security’\n\nIHC dismisses Intra-Court Appeals (ICAs) of the federal government against imposition of fine on senior officials for failing to recover ‘missing persons’\n\nIHC detailed verdict of contempt proceedings against social media campaign about Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri\n\nGovernment defends ban on X labelling it a “threat to peace and national security”\n\nGovernment pursues placing a ban on the PTI\n\nISPR alleges ‘mafia’ with vested interests was looking to sabotage the proposed campaign of ‘Azm-e-Istehkam’\n\nReady to talk with Pakistan Army: Imran Khan\n\n265th Corps Commanders Conference\n\nSpeaker National Assembly meets Foreign Dignitaries\n\nChairman Senate meets Foreign Dignitaries\n\nPrime Minister’s Interactions with COAS\n\nSC declares the PTI eligible to receive reserved seats\n\nOn July 12, the Supreme Court declared that the PTI was eligible to receive reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the National and Provincial Assemblies.\n\nThe majority verdict was affirmed by Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and supported by seven other judges including Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Ayesha A Malik, Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Shahid Waheed, and Justice Irfan Saadat Khan.\n\nThe majority judgement declared the PTI a parliamentary party, as it had 39 out of 80 MNAs listed by the ECP as PTI candidates. The remaining 41 independent candidates must submit notarized statements within 15 days, indicating their affiliation with the PTI. The judgement set aside the March 25, 2024 judgment of the PHC and the March 1, 2024 ECP decision which denied the PTI reserved seats terming these decisions as deemed unconstitutional and of no legal effect. The Court noted that the lack of an election symbol did not affect the PTI’s right to participate in elections.\n\nDisagreeing with the majority judgement, CJP Qazi Faez Isa and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail were of the view that the PTI be declared a parliamentary party. It noted that those who joined the SIC did so voluntarily and without undue influence. The minority view argued against reading artificial meanings into the Constitution and emphasized adherence to valid laws. The judgment affirmed that reserved seats for women and non-Muslims must be filled according to Article 224(6) of the Constitution. None of them claimed to have joined the party because of any misunderstanding of any judgement, the law, compulsion, coercion or undue influence and it was not for the Supreme Court to presume otherwise.\n\nIn his dissenting note, Justice Yahya Afridi wrote that the ECP should allocate reserved seats after providing parties with an opportunity to be heard. The ECP may revisit its earlier decision within seven days. Justice Aminuddin Khan and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, in yet another dissenting note, rejected the SIC's appeals and upheld the PHC judgment denying the SIC reserved seats.\n\nOn July 29, the ECP notified 93 returned members of three Provincial Assemblies as the lawmakers belonging to the PTI in pursuance of the SC order but did not de-notify those who had been allocated additional reserved seats in the National as well as Provincial Assemblies. According to a notification issued by the ECP, 29 members of the Punjab Assembly, 58 members of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, and six members of the Sindh Assembly were recognised as the PTI members. The ECP, however, apparently delayed the emergence of the PTI as the single largest party in the National Assembly by its last-minute decision to approach the Supreme Court to seek guidance on the case of another 41 PTI MNAs who had not mentioned their party affiliation in their nomination papers. It asked the Supreme Court to clarify who should be contacted for verification of these lawmakers’ affidavits since the party had no organisational structure on the ground.\n\nOn July 22, the PPP approached the Supreme Court to challenge the verdict that awarded reserved seats to the PTI and recognized it as a parliamentary party. The review petition was filed through senior counsel Senator Farooq H. Naek, challenging the SC’s interpretation of Articles 51(d)(e) and 106, which recognized the PTI as a political party that secured or won general seats in the February 8 general election. This was the third such petition, following similar moves by the PML-N on July 15, 2024 and three women members elected on reserved seats from the PML-N.\n\nFirst Woman CJ of the LHC\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_26146\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"498\"] Justice Aalia Neelum Chief Justice of the Lahore High Court (LHC)[/caption]\n\nOn July 02, Justice Aalia Neelum was appointed as Chief Justice of the Lahore High Court (LHC) by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP). This made her the first woman Chief Justice of the LHC.\n\nJustice Neelum’s elevation was approved by the JCP as the position became vacant after the elevation of Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan to the Supreme Court on June 7. The Pakistan Bar Council (PBC), however, opposed Justice Neelum’s elevation, advocating for the principle of seniority.\n\nOn July 4, the Supreme Court suspended the LHC notification of June 12 which had constituted eight (8) election tribunals in Punjab. The suspension was to enable meaningful consultation between the newly elevated LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja. The decision was made by a five-judge Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Qazi Faez Isa.\n\nSC detailed opinion on Presidential Reference\n\nOn July 8, the Supreme Court issued a detailed opinion on the presidential reference concerning the murder trial of former Prime Minister Mr. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The opinion revisited the 1979 trial and appellate court judgments that had sentenced Mr. Bhutto to death. This Supreme Court decision, made on March 6, 2024, sought to correct what it deemed a historic wrong after over 44 years.\n\nJustice Qazi Faez Isa, in his 48-page opinion, noted that during Mr. Bhutto's trial, the country was under martial law, impacting the independence of the judiciary. Judges had taken oaths of allegiance to a military dictator, which compromised the courts' integrity. The SC opinion highlighted that Mr. Bhutto’s trial and appeal had lacked due process and constitutional protection of fundamental rights. The opinion emphasized that these transgressions undermined any semblance of a fair trial.\n\nCJP Justice Isa also lamented the courts’ adulation of Gen Zia, stating that such admiration undermined the credibility of the judiciary. The opinion pointed out the inherent bias in the trial, noting that General Zia would directly benefit from a guilty verdict against Mr. Bhutto. It suggested that Mr. Bhutto's acquittal could have led to General Zia being prosecuted for high treason, indicating a personal survival motive behind Mr. Bhutto's conviction.\n\nMr. Imran Khan’s detention termed as illegal, politically motivated\n\nOn July 1, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention observed that the cases against Mr. Imran Khan, former Prime Minister of Pakistan, in both the cipher and one of the Toshakhana cases, were “without legal basis” and politically motivated to exclude him from the political arena.\n\nThe working group listed numerous legal inconsistencies and irregularities in the court proceedings against Mr. Imran Khan. The UN group also recommended Mr. Imran Khan’s immediate release.\n\nMr. Imran Khan and spouse acquitted in Iddat case\n\nOn July 13, former Prime Minister Mr. Imran Khan and his wife, Ms. Bushra Bibi, were acquitted in the Iddat case by a Sessions Court. However, the relief was short-lived as the NAB arrested Mr. Khan and spouse on another charge.\n\nAdditional District and Sessions Judge Mr. Mohammad Afzal Majoka acquitted Mr. Khan and spouse overturning their previous conviction by rejecting allegations by Ms. Bushra Bibi’s ex-husband, Mr. Khawar Fareed Maneka, that her nikah with Mr. Imran Khan was fraudulently performed and that Mr. Maneka was deprived of ruju (reconciliation rights) according to religious law. The court dismissed the fornication charge under Section 496-B of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) due to insufficient evidence and found no fraudulent or dishonest intentions in the marriage ceremony.\n\nGovernment formally authorises the ISI to trace, intercept calls and messages in interest of ‘national security’\n\nOn July 8, the Federal government formally authorised the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), to intercept and record telephone calls and messages in the interest of national security.\n\nIn a notification issued by the Federal Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication, the ISI was authorised to do so under Section 54 of the Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-organisation) Act, 1996.\n\nThe notification allowed “in the interest of national security and in the apprehension of any offence,” the “officers not below the rank of grade 18 to be nominated from time to time by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)” to intercept calls and messages or to trace calls through any telecommunication system.\n\nEarlier, the government had maintained that it had not permitted any intelligence agency to tap audio conversations as it informed the IHC during the hearing of a case related to Mr. Imran Khan’s spouse Bushra Bibi, who was seeking action against a leaked conversation allegedly featuring her and Mr. Latif Khosa. In May, Justice Babar Sattar of the IHC had said that no state official was authorised to surveil citizens and anyone doing so or aiding such an endeavour would be “liable for offences, as he prohibited cellular companies from sharing citizens’ data with agencies.\n\nIn informing the National Assembly, Federal Minister for Law, Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar said that the government had authorised the ISI to intercept calls and messages or trace a call in the interest of national security or in the apprehension of a crime under Section 54 of the Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-organization) Act, 1996. He maintained that it was not a new law and in fact had come into force in 1996 and was further reshaped Section 54 of Pakistan Telecommunication re-organisation Act 1996. No previous successive governments had changed this provision and it remained intact as each government, from time to time, issued notifications in this regard.\n\nIHC dismisses Intra-Court Appeals (ICAs) of the federal government against imposition of fine on senior officials for failing to recover ‘missing persons’\n\nOn July 3, the IHC dismissed intra-court appeals (ICAs) by the federal government against fines imposed on senior officials for failing to recover missing persons. The division bench comprised Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb. The single bench had previously fined the defence and interior secretaries, Islamabad chief commissioner, and police officers. It had also directed the government to regularly compensate the families of the missing persons.\n\nIHC detailed verdict of contempt proceedings against social media campaign about Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_26152\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"580\"] Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, IHC judge[/caption]\n\nOn July 09, the IHC issued a detailed verdict on contempt proceedings concerning a social media campaign against Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri. A full bench of the IHC issued notices to two journalists and a social media activist for their alleged involvement in the campaign. The court’s detailed order labelled the campaign as ‘scurrilous’ and noted it aimed to malign the judge. Notices were issued to journalists Ms. Gharidah Farooqi and Mr. Hassan Ayub Khan, instructing them to file responses within four weeks with content of their posts on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) and other related materials. The IHC also directed the FIA to serve notices to several X accounts, including one belonging to Mr. Ammar Solangi, claiming to be a freelance journalist. The court also issued notices to the PEMRA, the PTA, and the FIA director general to submit reports within four weeks.\n\nGovernment defends ban on X labelling it a “threat to peace and national security”\n\nOn July 8, the Federal Ministry of Interior defended the months-long ban on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) asserting that it poses a \"threat to peace and national security” by spreading “misinformation and inciting violence.” The ministry asserted that the ban, which began on February 17, 2024, was based on intelligence agency reports. Hostile elements on the platform aim to create chaos and instability to destabilize the country and plunge it into anarchy, claimed the government adding that these elements were exploiting X to spread misinformation and incite violence, posing a grave threat to national peace and security.\n\nGovernment pursues placing a ban on the PTI\n\nOn July 23, Federal Information Minister, Mr. Attallah Tarar, while speaking to a private tv channel, said that the government had decided in principle to place a ban on the PTI and was waiting for a broader consensus (among ruling allies) to impose the ban. .Earlier on July 14, he had made similar comments about the decision to ban the PTI and to initiate Article 6 proceedings against Mr. Imran Khan, Dr. Arif Alvi, and former Deputy Speaker Mr. Qasim Suri.\n\nOn July 22, raids were conducted on the PTI offices in Islamabad by the Police and FIA leading to the arrest of PTI’s information secretary, Mr. Raoof Hasan, in a case under the Prevention of Electronics Crimes Act 2016 (PECA). It was claimed that the PTI was suspected of being involved in alleged “anti-state digital campaigns.” A PTI activist Mr. Ahmad Waqas Janjua was also arrested on charges of possessing weapons and explosives. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, MNA condemned the raid, claiming the police seized CCTV footage, documents, and records of the PTI’s intra-party elections.\n\nISPR alleges ‘mafia’ with vested interests was looking to sabotage the proposed campaign of ‘Azm-e-Istehkam’\n\nAddressing a press conference on July 22, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, Director General Inter-Services Public Relations, alleged that a ‘mafia’ with vested interests aimed to sabotage the military's counter-terrorism campaign ‘Azm-e-Istehkam’. He clarified that Azm-e-Istehkam was not a military operation but a cohesive counter-terrorism campaign targeting anti-state individuals and mafias. He accused this mafia of propagating false narratives to disrupt the campaign, falsely claiming it would cause mass displacements. He linked the propaganda against State institution to the judicial leniency shown towards the perpetrators of the May 9, 2023 incident, following Mr. Imran Khan’s arrest. He argued that these digital terrorists were being treated as heroes in the name of freedom of expression, despite their activities against state leadership.\n\nDuring the press conference, a question was posed to the DG ISPR about criticism by some political parties on social media who blamed the Army for firing on protestors in Bannu. Responding to the question, DG ISPR said that eight (8) military personnel were martyred in the terrorist attack on Bannu Cantonment while innocent civilians also lost their lives due to indiscriminate firing of the terrorists. He added that local traders asked the next day for carrying out a peace march after the attack and it was agreed that no anti-State slogans would be chanted. However some specific negative elements joined the peace march and slogans against the Army and State could be heard in the rally as it marched throughout the point of the terrorist attack. A temporary wall erected was also torn down and the supply depot was looted. Some armed men from the rally also opened fire on troops. Moreover, firing was also witnessed at another point of the rally which was 1 kilometre away. The response from the security forces was as per the SOPs, said the DG ISPR adding that the security forces conducted aerial firing as per the orders. He also added that this happened because of the country’s legal and judicial system when it gave leeway to the perpetrators and facilitators of May 9 violence which has given rise to mob mentality and fascism.\n\nIn response to another question on whether the TLP was protesting again based on the support of the military establishment, DG ISPR ruled out the military establishment’s role in the sit-in, blaming propaganda and fake news for such talks.\n\nOn July 24, Mr. Imran Khan, in a statement, regretted how certain individuals with no understanding of social media were dishing out “digital terrorism” labels. A post on Mr. Imran Khan’s official X account, which he cannot personally access while in prison, said nation is being hated by calling the entire Pakistani nation as terrorists. A few people living in the 1970s who are completely ignorant of how social media works are distributing the title of digital terrorism. The tweet cautioned that if everyone who supported his party was regarded as a “digital terrorist”, a gap would be created between the military and people adding ninety (90) per cent of the population stands with the PTI, 90 per cent of the people voted in favour of the PTI, adding that people inciting hatred should be mindful of their actions.\n\nReady to talk with Pakistan Army: Imran Khan\n\nOn July 30, former PM Mr. Imran Khan categorically said that his party was ready for talks with the military establishment. Speaking to reporters at Adiala jail, the PTI founder laid down three preconditions: the return of his party’s ‘stolen mandate’, the release of all detained party workers and the holding of transparent elections. He said the party had already nominated Mr. Mehmood Khan Achakzai to negotiate on their behalf, and urged the military to nominate their representatives for talks. Mr. Khan claimed that his party had never levelled allegations against the Army.\n\nOn July 25, Mr. Imran Khan cautioned the COAS through a message that Mr. Shehbaz Sharif-led government was trying to pit the military, the PTI and the masses against each other. The former prime minister also accused the interior and foreign ministers of deliberately staying out of the spotlight, and using the armed forces as their spokespersons. Mr. Imran Khan’s message was conveyed by Mr. Omar Ayub Khan, after he met Mr. Khan in Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi.\n\nOn July 26, a day after Mr. Omar Ayub, opposition leader in NA surprised many by conveying a ‘friendly’ message from his party’s founder to the COAS, Mr. Imran Khan’s sister also came out with a similar narrative, while speaking to reporters after meeting Mr. Khan in Adiala jail and requested Chief of Army Staff to “become neutral.” Quoting Mr. Imran Khan, she said that CCTV footage should be used to identify those who were really responsible for mayhem on May 9, 2023, while the innocent people who were languishing in jails should be freed. She said that Mr Khan had always called for peaceful protests, adding they have never given a malicious call. Relaying Mr. Khan’s message, she said that the PML-N and PPP had lost the moral high ground and wanted to pit the PTI and the Army against each other. The Army, she said, is the backbone of Pakistan and the PTI does not want the Army and the people to be brought face to face. If there is no rule of law, how will the country move forward, she asked, quoting her brother.\n\nOn July 29, Mr. Imran Khan endorsed his earlier statement that he directed his party, the PTI, to stage a peaceful protest outside the Army's General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi before his arrest on May 09, 2023. The PTI had denied these comments refuting the media reports about Mr. Khan's admission, claiming that the party founder did not say what was being reported in the media. Speaking to reporters at Adiala jail, he said that he had told the party to stage a peaceful protest outside the GHQ if he got arrested. He said that he had issued directives for staging protests in the cantonment areas of the garrison city, adding that he had mentioned these things a dozen times during investigations. When asked about the May 9 violent protests that saw attacks on State properties including military installations in many parts of the country, Mr. Khan said that the protest was not peaceful because the riots were ‘pre-planned.’ He said that criticism must be placed no matter what the institution it is. He also came up with a new stance on his earlier narrative of ‘only animals are neutral’ statement and said that neutral does not mean animal but it means apolitical, saying the Army is non-partisan.\n\n265th Corps Commanders Conference\n\nOn July 5, the 265th Corps Commanders conference chaired by the COAS condemned criticism directed at the newly launched Operation Azm-e-Istehkam accusing critics of advancing self-serving agendas and engaging in malicious propaganda aimed at undermining the counterterrorism efforts.\n\nAccording to the ISPR, Chief of the Army Staff reaffirmed the Army’s readiness to confront internal and external challenges and contribute to Pakistan’s stability and prosperity. He criticized what he described as “politically motivated digital terrorism” aimed at undermining State institutions.\n\nSpeaker National Assembly meets Foreign Dignitaries\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_26158\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"489\"] Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, MNA Speaker, National Assembly of Pakistan[/caption]\n\nOn July 12, Hungarian Envoy to Pakistan, H.E.
