        "text": "This article examines the poetry of Shah Abdul Latif for its casteist and patriarchal drift. In particular, it focuses on the 'Dalit question' and the interpretation of Latif's poetry by both progressive and conservative sections of Sindhi society. Latif's poetry is highly lyrical, and several of his works inspire love for a transcendental being immanent in nature and in people. Yet much of Latiff's poetry and his biography suggest that Latif was not as progressive and egalitarian as he is often represented to be. Metaphors of caste, gender and religion have materiality. They do not simply invoke esoteric mystical feelings but also furnish justifications in everyday life for persisting with entrenched casteist and patriarchal values. Observing the easy appropriation of Latif's poetry by different sections of Sindhi society, I conclude that it provides a social and political idiom that depolitici ¶ zes casteism and lacks the capacity to inspire Dalit consciousness.\n\nThis paper is an attempt to analyze from the Ambedkarian perspective the interpretations of Latif’s poetry by the Progressives to assess its emancipatory potential for the Dalits. Building my critique primarily on the scholarly work of H.T.Sorley, I argue that in an attempt to construct the Sufi image of ‘Sindhi nation’, the Progressives undermine the casteist, fatalist and sectarian import of Latif’s poetry and life-history. Latif’s heterodox and multivocal nature of poetry and ambiguity regarding the originality of his verses gives expression to multiple and contradictory signifiers, including the casteist ones. This heterodoxy of Latif allows the Progressives, like any other social and political group, to legitimize and popularize the selective verses that may have, at least on surface, the egalitarian and patriotic import, to exonerate Latif from any possible hegemonic impact of the casteist values and the Ashrafia privileges that he enjoyed in his times, or the Progressives themselves continue to enjoy.\n\nThis paper is an attempt to explicate the emancipatory limits of a historical figure in a caste society. As a case study, it offers a critical analysis of a metaphor of Shah Abdul Latif, the eighteenth-century poet who inherited enormous caste capital as a Sayed and custodian of a Sufi shrine. The poetry and life history of Shah Latif are often invoked by Sindhi nationalists to pose an ontological challenge to the narrative of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Situating Latif in the South Asian political context, this paper offers a historiographical analysis of the vernacular literature on the projection of Latif as the prime symbol of emancipation for the Sindhi nation. It contends that Latif, as we know him today, is an anachronistic construct that was initially inspired by the Orientalist motive, and later used by privileged caste Hindus and Ashrafiya morality to feed the performative Sindhi nationalist agenda."
