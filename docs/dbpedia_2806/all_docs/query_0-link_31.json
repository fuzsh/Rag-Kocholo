        "text": "تلخیص\n\nThis article discusses in detail the universal message reflected in the poetry of Hazrat Sachal Sarmast in the context of Holy Quran and Hadiths of Hazrat Muhammad (S.A.W.) as his very sources of poetical thought are these two essentials of Islamic way of life. In the light of these two source, poetry of Sachal Sarmast is based on mysticism. Therefore, a number of his verses are made a part of this article to justify his view point in connection with the Holy Quran and Hadiths. His verses are in Sindhi, Urdu, Persian and Seraiki which are relevant to this subject. Besides quoting many Holy verses of Quran Pak, Sachal has given numerous Hadiths in his poetry so as to clear his poetic philosophy and ideology. Sachal Sarmast was a saint at par and believed faithfully in complete code of life- Islam. He also advocated the four destinations or phases, prevailing amongst Sufis regarding a status called “Wasil- Billah”. These destinations include: Sharait, Tareeqat Maarfat and Haqeeqat. Having successfully reached every destination or phases, then it is practically possible to achieve the high status of “Fana Fillah” and afterwards the last destination of Ghous and Qutub. Many Sufis like Mansoor Halaj, Shah Inayat Shaheed, Makhdoom Bilawal, Shams Tabraiz, Shah Karim, Shah Latif etc. are a galaxy of those who achieved high status. And Sachal Sarmast was, indeed, a part rather a shining star of this galaxy of Sufi Saints."
