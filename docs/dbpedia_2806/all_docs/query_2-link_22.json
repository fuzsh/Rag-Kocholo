I also benefited from the advice of Ali Bhutto, who is doing impressive research on the family’s early history in Sindh. Ashiq Bhutto was very helpful on Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s early days, with his memories of nights out in London back in the 1940s. Ghinwa Bhutto welcomed me to 70 Clifton, although sadly I was unable to see or use the library there. Thanks too to Muslim Bhutto for his help. Before writing this book, I presented a podcast series on the assassination of Benazir Bhutto. Both Asif Zardari and Bilawal Bhutto granted interviews for those podcasts. Film-maker and journalist Ziad Zafar could not have been more generous with his remarkable knowledge and subtle understanding of the Bhutto family: we all look forward to his film on Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.

Heather McCallum at Yale University Press was an enthusiastic supporter of the project from the outset. I also owe thanks to staff at The National Archives of the UK in Kew and the British Library in central London. It never ceases to amaze me that one can have original documents, however obscure, on one’s desk within ninety minutes of asking for them. I also benefited from material kept at Pakistan’s National Archive – technically known as the National Documentation Centre. Partly because of its location in the cabinet secretariat, access is not easy and a lot of sensitive subjects are clearly still considered off limits, but, once one has got in, there is more declassified material available there than many appreciate. In Karachi, Shahzeb Jillani helped me work out what the Sindh Archives have on the colonial period. Pakistan’s leading newspaper, Dawn, has a beautifully preserved collection of not only its own back copies since 1947 but also cuttings from all of Pakistan’s English media arranged by topic. The paper also has a very impressive collection of historical images. Pakistan is lucky to have a media house so committed to preserving the country’s history, one that does so with greater passion and transparency than many of the state bodies charged with the task. I am very grateful to Hameed Haroon and Zaffar Abbas for making it so easy to use the newspaper’s rich resources. The Bhuttos are still active in politics and many interlocutors requested anonymity, especially when it came to describing recent times and presidencies. Thanks, too, to these contributors.\n\nix\n\nx\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAt around 1 a.m. on 27 December 2007 Benazir Bhutto was told someone would try to kill her that day. The warning came from no lesser a source than the director general of Pakistan’s main intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Despite the late hour, Lieutenant General Nadeem Taj, the second most powerful man in the country after the army chief, was so sure of his information that he travelled to her home in Islamabad to deliver the message in person. General Taj told her that suicide bombers would target her before, during or after an election rally she would be addressing in Rawalpindi. Suspicious that he was trying to trick her into cancelling the event, Benazir1 told Taj that, if he knew about some suicide bombers, he should arrest them. That was impossible, Taj replied, because it would expose his sources. ‘Giving me security is the responsibility of the state,’ Benazir insisted. ‘You beef up security and make sure that I’m fully protected. Not only I’m protected, but my people who are there, they’re fully protected.’ Taj said he would do his best.2 As General Taj and Benazir were speaking, her assassins were making their final preparations. A Taliban handler, Nasrullah, had arrived in Rawalpindi shortly after midnight, bringing with him two fifteen-year-old boys, Bilal and Ikramullah. According to the rituals they had learnt in the suicide bomb facility where they had been trained, the boys had to bathe to ensure they were clean for when they entered paradise. As they prepared for martyrdom, two more handlers, named in the eventual trial as Husnain Gul and Rafaqat Hussain, went to Rawalpindi’s Liaquat Park, where the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) rally was due to be held, to check nothing would upset their plans. The police were already setting up metal detectors at each of the three gates to the park, but since the plan was to attack her as she left the rally, that didn’t matter. Satisfied that they could do it, the two young men returned and gave a pistol 1\n\nTHE BHUTTO DYNASTY with live rounds to Bilal and a hand grenade to Ikramullah. As Bilal put his suicide jacket on, he took off a shawl and cap, which he left at Husnain Gul’s house. Although the state would later ignore the evidence, the clothes and the DNA left on them would provide what could be considered irrefutable proof about the identities of the conspirators. Husnain then advised Bilal to wear something other than training shoes, as the security forces had the idea that jihadis wore trainers and might pick him up. He put on some sandals and left his trainers behind as well. After some prayers, Husnain took Bilal to the exit gate they thought Benazir would use, while Rafaqat took Ikramullah to another gate in case she used a different route. Shortly after she got up, Benazir phoned her family in Dubai. ‘Your voice is going hoarse,’ her son Bilawal told her. ‘You have to make sure you drink your lemon and honey.’ She then spoke to her husband Asif Zardari. ‘I told her not to go out . . . She said, you know, some things I have to do,’3 he later recalled. It was the last time she would speak to either of them. Her attitude was in part a reflection of her fatalism. ‘I believe that the time is written and when it comes it will come,’ she once said. ‘I used to be scared of death but after my father’s death I was no longer scared . . . The body is just the clothing and it is the soul that is important and the soul is free and with God and not under 6 feet of earth.’4 Next, she went to a meeting with the Afghan leader Hamid Karzai in an Islamabad hotel. It has often been reported that he warned her that she was about to be attacked, but in fact, he says, they just discussed the threat she faced in general terms. Benazir’s convoy set off for Rawalpindi at around midday. She reached the park and was rushed up onto the stage. In front of her were 10,000 people, and she spoke for around half an hour, proclaiming her attachment to dynastic politics. Referring to herself twice as ‘the daughter of Zulfikar’, she invoked her father’s name no fewer than seventeen times. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, she told the crowd, found his greatness struggling against military dictators. By founding the PPP, he had placed his trust in the Pakistani people and had thereby been empowered to build the nuclear bomb and make Pakistan a great nation. And despite all these achievements he had been hanged. ‘Long live Benazir!’ the crowd roared back. ‘Benazir, Prime Minister!’ The speeches over, she got into her bulletproof Toyota. As normal, her supporters surrounded it, and by the time the vehicle moved onto the road just outside the park it was almost at a standstill. Two of Benazir’s guards climbed 2\n\nINTRODUC TION onto the rear bumper, while others went to the front and the sides. ‘I should stand up,’ Benazir said. As normal, she stood on the back seat, her head and shoulders sticking out of the emergency hatch above the roof. It was ten past five in the afternoon. Having waited all day, Bilal saw that his moment had come. He moved first to the front of the car and then to the side where there were fewer people, took out his pistol and pointed it at Benazir’s head. One of the guards clawed at the young man but, although he touched his arm, he was slightly too far away to get a firm grip. Bilal fired three shots in less than a second. As the second shot rang out, Benazir’s headscarf, or dupatta, moved away from her face. After the third, she fell like a stone, through the escape hatch, into the vehicle. As she did so, Bilal set off his suicide bomb. ‘I turned my face and she was on my lap,’ recalled Naheed Khan, who had been sitting on the car’s back seat, beside Benazir. ‘And her blood was oozing like I can’t explain to you. I have no words to say. Her blood was oozing. My hands, my – she was soaked in blood. My whole clothes were soaked in blood.’ Naheed Khan’s medically trained husband, Dr Safdar Abbasi, was also in the vehicle. ‘You know, I was trying to see her pulse and I was finding it very difficult, you know, to get to her pulse. But naturally, we had to take her to hospital. By that time, you know, the Jeep was all alone. There was no police car. There was no backup car.’5 There was no backup car because, inexplicably, Benazir’s security chief, Rehman Malik, had driven away. He later gave a bewildering number of different accounts of his actions in those moments. In a TV interview shortly after the blast he said his car had been just 4 feet away from Benazir’s vehicle when Bilal had blown himself up. He claimed he then led Benazir’s car to the hospital and remained there. In a different interview shortly afterwards, he said that his car was moving in front of Benazir’s and that immediately after the bomb went off they accelerated, fearing another attack. Initially Benazir followed, but, after some time, they saw that Benazir’s car was no longer behind them; so they did a U-turn and returned. Both accounts – and other versions he gave – were completely untrue. In fact, Rehman Malik, together with others who were sharing his car, simply left the scene and headed for Islamabad. A decade later, when asked why he had done this, Malik said he had been following police instructions. Another occupant of the car, Benazir’s longstanding and famously loyal spokesman, Farhatullah Babar, gave a similar account, although he added that allowing himself to be driven away that day was the greatest regret of his life.6 3\n\nTHE BHUTTO DYNASTY Having been abandoned by some of her closest advisers, Benazir’s driver had to deal with the situation himself. The bomb had blown out the Toyota’s tyres, so, as he tried to speed away on the metal rims, he soon became stuck. Naheed Khan and Safdar Abbasi found themselves in the extraordinary situation of trying to hail a taxi to get Benazir to the hospital. The police had vanished. ‘When we were waiting for a taxi,’ Naheed recalled, ‘then another Jeep came within two, three minutes. And we took her to the hospital in that car.’ The vehicle belonged to Benazir’s spokeswoman, Sherry Rehman. Records show they reached the hospital about twenty-five minutes after the attack. Benazir was put on a stretcher in the parking lot, then carried inside. She had no pulse and was not breathing. Her pupils were fixed, dilated and didn’t react to light. Blood dribbled from a wound to her head, and doctors saw whitish material, which, they said, looked like brain matter. Despite the evidence that she was already dead, the doctors tried to revive her. Within a minute, they had cleared her throat and put tubes in her. They pumped her with fluids and adrenaline. There was no response. Blood began to trickle from her ears and nose. They moved her to the operating theatre and just before six o’clock, almost fifty minutes after the attack, opened her chest and began to massage her heart by hand. Again, there was no response. They tried drugs and a defibrillator. Nothing. At 6:16 p.m., a little over an hour after the attack, Benazir was declared dead, and all men were asked to leave the operating room. Women began to clean her body and dress the wound on her head. They removed her blood-soaked dress and replaced it with surgical clothes. Then they filled in her death certificate, number 202877. Under cause of death, it was written: ‘To be ascertained by autopsy.’ When the announcement of her death was made outside the hospital, a deep, guttural groan came from a crowd appalled, but perhaps not that surprised, that yet another Bhutto had met a violent death. They all knew the history: the family’s story was part of Pakistan’s national fabric. Benazir’s charismatic father had filled the hearts of Pakistan’s toiling masses with hope before the army hanged him; her brothers, sworn to avenge their father’s death, had been poisoned and shot. The Bhuttos may have enjoyed power, but they paid a heavy price. And as with her siblings, the question as to who killed Benazir, and why, has never been resolved. Many assumed that the army had asked the jihadis to murder her, but others rushed to blame Benazir’s own family. And as soon as the speculation began in homes all over Pakistan and on the 4\n\nINTRODUC TION satellite TV channels, the cover-up was well underway. Before Benazir was even declared dead, the local police had asked the fire department to hose down the crime scene, washing away all the evidence scattered on the road. As officials tried pre-emptively to frustrate any investigation, all over the country young men took to the streets setting up checkpoints, destroying cars and trains and looting banks. Realising that they would be seen as representatives of a state many blamed for her murder, the police stayed at home, leaving it to the army to restore order. The Bhuttos, then and now, divide opinion. Indeed, the family is so controversial that writing about them carries obvious hazards: supporters and detractors alike judge anything said about the family not against a yardstick of truth but rather on the basis of whether or not the account they are reacting to is favourable to the family or not. Some dismiss well-grounded criticism as hearsay while others consider well-deserved praise as suggestive of a hidden Western or anti-military agenda. The various views on the Bhuttos and the many issues surrounding the family are, more often than not, irreconcilable. Take the killing of Benazir Bhutto’s brother, Murtaza Bhutto, on the streets of Karachi on 20 September 1996. Some people jumped to the belief that Benazir, possibly with some collusion by her husband, ordered Murtaza’s death. Zardari has always denied that, and, indeed, at the end of a long-running trial relating to the death he was acquitted. Others believe the killing was nothing more than a bungled attempt to arrest, or maybe just disarm, some of Murtaza’s bodyguards. It is impossible to settle the matter. While some have suggested that there was growing hostility between Murtaza and Zardari in the period before Murtaza’s death, they cannot produce any document or contemporaneous eyewitness to indicate that any order or encouragement to kill him was made. Nor can the other side provide convincing evidence of orders having been given for an arrest that went wrong. Yet each camp doggedly hangs on to its view and shows no sign of ever being willing to change its opinion. Even if irrefutable evidence emerged, many would probably still hold on to the version in which they believe. It’s much the same when it comes to Murtaza’s father, Zulfikar. ‘Murdered by the army he challenged’, say his supporters. ‘Undone by his lust for power’, counter the critics. The family itself says that it has repeatedly made sacrifices for the good of Pakistan and that the Bhuttos’ commitment to democracy and the country’s 5\n\nTHE BHUTTO DYNASTY poor is so deep that they are willing to soak the nation’s soil with their blood to challenge the status quo. There is truth to this version – both Zulfikar and his daughter Benazir walked willingly and bravely towards their deaths. If Zulfikar had accepted the coup that threw him out of power and gone into exile, he could have escaped the gallows. Had Benazir remained abroad in 2007 rather than returning to fight an election, she could have looked forward to a long and comfortable retirement. Both said no to the easy life. And yet this only tells part of the story. By the time he was ousted from power, Zulfikar had become so convinced of his own greatness and indispensability that he did not believe the generals would dare hang him. As I shall describe, there is good reason to believe that he only came to realise that he would actually be hanged a few hours before it happened. As for Benazir, her continued engagement in politics was not just a case of giving up the comforts of Dubai and New York so that she could fight for her ideals. Her political comeback in 2007 also enabled her to get all the legal cases against her overturned. The amnesty she secured from General Musharraf scuppered a Swiss trial in which there was a very high chance she would have been convicted of, among other things, using money from bribes to buy a necklace worth $175,000. The Bhuttos’ story is so full of passion, talent, suffering, courage, violence and money that it never lacks a strong narrative thrust. And the family story provides a good vehicle for telling the history of Pakistan as a whole – from before the time the country was created up to the present day. The first major figure in the dynasty, Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto, like many Indian aristocrats, readily accepted the authority of his colonial masters, working closely with them and even aping their habits. His son Zulfikar articulated Pakistan’s aspiration to be a successful country independent of the West, leading the Islamic world and matching Indian power, both conventional and nuclear. And then his daughter Benazir framed the national debate as one between the military usurpers and the forces of democracy. Many of the political and national questions asked by successive generations of Pakistanis were asked first and most loudly by a Bhutto. And many of the ideas and trends the family has grappled with, such as colonialism, democracy, religion, military power, inequality and nuclear technology, are the issues that have been at the heart of Pakistan’s political and social development. The phenomenon of dynastic power raises a question which political scientists seem to have largely ignored: do dynasts perform better or worse than less 6\n\nINTRODUC TION privileged politicians? Hopefully this book gives some of the raw data needed to answer that question. And with Bhuttos and Gandhis still seeking power, it is a question of some importance: there is, after all, at least a possibility that following his great-grandfather, grandfather, mother and father, Bilawal Bhutto will become the fifth in his family to run a state. But that raises another question: to what extent is each generation influenced by what came before? Do dynasties hold true to certain values and political positions? From colonial days onwards, the question of how the Bhutto family positioned itself in relation to the West has been a defining issue for successive generations. Sir Shahnawaz was as pro-British as it was possible for a Sindhi landlord to be – hence his knighthood. It was a stance that worked in the corridors of power in Bombay but was also a factor in his surprise election defeat in Larkana in 1937. Zulfikar was not as consistently pro-Chinese and anti-Western as many say, and the claim that his nuclear policies led the US to conspire to kill him is, as I shall argue, not supported by evidence, although he was probably right to believe that his perceived anti-Americanism contributed to his losing his job as foreign minister. For her part, Benazir’s pro-Americanism was cited by those in the Taliban who ordered her assassination as one of the reasons she deserved to die, although whether that was the real reason is discussed in Chapter 8. As well as defining themselves in relation to the West, the postPakistan Bhuttos have had to face the question of military power. Both Zulfikar and his daughter tried to find a way of living with the army. The story of the Bhutto dynasty since Pakistan was created has been, to a significant extent, the story of the conflict between it and the army and of the Bhuttos’ failed attempts to reach a compromise with the generals. The family story, then, illustrates key themes of Pakistani political history. The dilemmas faced by Bhuttos – how to think about the West and how to manage the military – are the issues that preoccupy Pakistan as a whole.\n\n7\n\n1\n\nTHE BHUTTOS AND THE COLONIALISTS\n\nAmong the many documents hidden away in the Bhutto family library in 70 Clifton, Karachi, is a family tree commissioned over fifty years ago by the dynasty’s most famous son, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.1 It traces twelve generations of Bhuttos, but the dynastic story really goes back twelve centuries to a time when the Bhuttos’ ancestors were Rajputs, a warrior caste that became the most important Hindu ally of successive Moghul emperors, providing them with military forces. The Rajputs were composed of tight-knit, disputatious clans, and it is from Rajput culture that the Bhuttos inherited some enduring traits, such as a willingness to embrace confrontation in defence of personal honour, placing a high degree of value on owning land and, until the advent of Benazir Bhutto, the practice of keeping the family women covered and secluded. Occasional references to the Bhuttos’ ancestors in various seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Rajasthani chronicles confirm their Rajput heritage. But details are scarce, and the story is complicated by confusions between Bootas, Bhuttas, Bhuttos and Bhattis, and some inter-marriages between them. The latest research suggests that the Bhattis (and many Punjabis still bear that name) are a distinct genealogical line, while the Bhuttas and Bootas are the ancestors of the Bhuttos of Pakistan:2 in many cases an ‘a’ at the end of family names changed to ‘o’ as part of the process of colonial anglicisation. Over the centuries, however, many Rajasthani and Western historians, and even family members, have conflated these different groups, making it hard to disentangle who was doing what, where and when. Lieutenant Colonel James Tod in his 1920 Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan described a ninth-century Bhatti prince who ruled an area around Tanot, now an Indian town near the Pakistan border. The prince arranged for his son to marry the daughter of the chief of 8\n\nTHE BHUTTOS AND THE COLONIALISTS the Bootas. In the first of many colourful tales about the family’s internecine competitiveness, bold strokes and ambition, Deoraj, the son of the Bhatti/ Boota union, asked the Boota chief for a village in which to settle down. The chief offered some remote desert land, the size of which was described by the area that could be encompassed by thongs cut from a single buffalo’s hide. When Deoraj built not just a home but a castle on the site, the Boota chief sent a force of 120 men to destroy it. However, Deoraj tricked the assailants, inviting them in groups of ten into his castle before murdering them.3 Deoraj’s action is the first recorded episode of the Bhuttos’ unceasingly dramatic dynastic story, although that’s not to say that a direct line can be traced between him and the Bhuttos of Pakistan. But from time to time Bhutto ancestors appear in various Rajasthani histories, and often in prominent roles. According to the Gazetteer of the Bahawalpur State 1904, for example,4 the Bahawalpur town of Bhuttavahana was named after the Bhuttos when they won control of it around 900 AD. The earliest known artefacts relating to the family are two stone pillars engraved in Sanskrit which to this day can been seen standing in the open near the Indian city of Jaisalmer in Rajasthan.5 The oldest, over 2 metres high, was erected in 1148 under the instruction of a queen, Naikadevi, who is described in the carving as having been born a Bhutta and married to a Bhatti. A second pillar dated 1173 also mentions ‘the renowned Naikadevi’, whom it describes as a pious devotee of a Sarva, a belligerent god who killed with arrows. Naikadevi, the inscription says, worshipped the arrow, and, although there is no evidence that he was aware of the precedent, nearly 800 years later Zulfikar Ali Bhutto chose that symbol for his Pakistan People’s Party. That Naikadevi married a Bhatti indicates that at that time – the twelfth century – the Bhuttos were still Hindu. It’s not clear when they converted, but family folklore suggests it was during the seventeenth century – much the same time as the branch that went on to govern Pakistan moved from Rajasthan to Sindh. According to one of the present-day elders of the Bhutto family, Ashiq Bhutto, some of the Bhutto homes still contain remnants of the family’s Hindu heritage, such as traditional Hindu wedding clothes, although they are now in tatters. ‘Even when I got married some aspects of the ceremony were what the Hindus do, Hindu tradition,’ he said.6 Why the Bhuttos moved is unclear. One family story talks about a feud between different branches of the family. Another has the Bhuttos’ forebears 9\n\nTHE BHUTTO DYNASTY aligned to Dara Shikoh, the Sufi-minded brother and rival of the Moghul emperor Aurungzeb. According to this version, passed down orally through the Bhutto generations, a branch of the family had picked the wrong side, and when Aurungzeb had Dara Shikoh executed in 1659 they were forced into exile and moved to Sindh. Despite being Hindus, the Bhuttos had started taking an interest in Sufi Islam – which is suggestive of a link to Shikoh – and began visiting shrines, thereby starting a process that led eventually to their conversion.7 The man who appears to have led these geographic and spiritual shifts was Sehto Bhutto, who settled near the village of Ratodero, close to Larkana in what is now the Pakistani province of Sindh. It was an area in which vast hunting grounds afforded space for newcomers to settle and prosper, and it may be that political disruption in the area meant that the existing occupants had been forced to move.8 However they got hold of the land, Bhuttos have been there ever since. As he settled in Sindh, Sehto Bhutto would quickly have become aware that there were three groups who mattered in his new home area: the tribes, the religious leaders and the landowners. His most pressing priority was to build good relationships with Sindh’s tribal rulers. At the time, as Moghul power declined, Sindh was undergoing a period of some turbulence, and various groups tried to fill the vacuum. Eventually the Kalhoras, described by an early British colonial historian as ‘a tribe of fighting fanatics’,9 became dominant but in 1783 they were toppled by another tribe, the Talpurs, who held sway until 1843 when they were defeated by the British. Sehto and his descendants had to pick their way through these significant political changes. While staying on the right side of the most powerful tribal leaders was crucial, the Bhuttos also needed to be mindful of the power of Sindh’s religious leadership. Although the eighth-century Arab conquest of Sindh had established Muslim rule, the conversion of Sindhis was a slow process: over a millennium later, at the time of Pakistan’s independence in 1947, around a third of Sindhis were still Hindu. But most Sindhis did convert, and by the time the Bhuttos arrived, Muslims were not only in the majority but the practice of their faith was a prominent part of daily life. As one British visitor observed, ‘no land in Asia can boast of a like number of ecclesiastical establishments’.10 And those establishments – mainly shrines to saints – nurtured a distinctive branch of Islam. Most Sindhi Muslims, and some Hindus too, followed a 10\n\nTHE BHUTTOS AND THE COLONIALISTS chosen spiritual leader, or pir, who was normally the descendant of the saint buried at the shrine he controlled. These men gave the impression of being unworldly ascetics, but since their followers were passed down from one generation to the next, the leading religious families gradually became politically important. Anyone in power in Sindh needed the support of the pirs, and the deal was simple enough: pirs who kept their followers in line, loyal to whoever was in power, became jaghirdars, which is to say they were rewarded by the state with land rights.11 Alongside the tribes and the pirs, farmers were becoming an emerging force as increasing numbers of people gave up a nomadic lifestyle, albeit retaining a strong clan identity. The Bhuttos themselves became a good example of this strand of Sindhi society, and they might well have felt that securing ownership of a large estate put them on the right side of history. While James McMurdo, an English army officer who roamed around Sindh in the 1830s, described the tribes as ‘jealous, proud, knavish and mean’, he thought those who followed trade or agriculture were ‘as industrious as the former are indolent’.12 It wasn’t just a matter of their work ethic: improved irrigation systems enabled many settled Sindhis to cultivate their land and get rich. The best single source for the early history of the Bhutto family in Sindh is a personal memoir written in the twentieth century by Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto, who lived from 1888 to 1957 and whose son Zulfikar and granddaughter Benazir went on to great heights. According to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s biographer, Stanley Wolpert, at the time when he was writing his book there was a copy of the memoir, perhaps the only one in existence, in the 70 Clifton library.13 Wolpert recorded that the memoir began with the phrase: ‘This is not an autobiography’. The current occupant of 70 Clifton, Ghinwa Bhutto – of whom more later – says she has never heard of the book,14 and it seems Wolpert is one of the few historians ever to have seen it. On the basis of the memoir, Wolpert described how the Bhuttos did not advance into the first rank of Sindhi landowners until the nineteenth century, when Sehto’s grandson Pir Bakhsh Khan Bhutto fought many battles in Larkana but swore allegiance to the ruling Talpurs, who, in return, recognised the Bhuttos’ land holdings. It was a mutually advantageous relationship, but one that was not free of anxiety and suspicion. Wolpert reports the Shahnawaz memoir as saying that in 1821 the Talpurs ‘invited’ Pir Bakhsh Khan Bhutto to send a son to their base in 11\n\nTHE BHUTTO DYNASTY Khairpur, where he was kept for five years as ‘an honourable hostage’.15 It was an early case of ‘trust and verify’. The Bhuttos’ story has been affected to a significant degree by their relationship with the West, first Britain and later the US. By the time the Bhuttos reached Sindh, the British already had some experience of the area. The first Englishman known to have set foot in Sindh, Anthony Starkey, arrived in 1612, many decades before Sehto Bhutto. Starkey, the steward of the ship The Dragon, landed in the Sindhi city of Thatta, east of Karachi, having been asked by his captain to return overland to England carrying some letters. Like many of the early English arrivals, he was not welcome: he died in Thatta, possibly poisoned by two Portuguese traders who were already there and did not want any competition.16 There followed a series of failed attempts by Englishmen to establish a trading relationship. In 1640 the East India Company dispatched a chief factor to set up a trading post, but a combination of natural disaster, disease and the suspicions of Sindh’s elite meant that business was disappointing, and by 1662 Sindh had been declared too poor and hostile to justify the expense of an East India Company official living there.17 A century later, the East India Company tried again and encountered similar problems, with successive English traders being expelled. The hostility they experienced flowed from the concerns of many Sindhis about British intentions. And, as events subsequently proved, those concerns were well founded. In 1830, a British officer, Colonel Henry Pottinger, navigated the Indus as far as the Sindhi capital, Hyderabad. British power and technology were making it impossible for the Sindhis to hold back the British, and in 1838 the Talpurs, seeing no alternative, signed a treaty with Pottinger allowing a permanent British presence in Hyderabad. Four years later their worst fears were realised when Sir Charles Napier dispensed with the diplomatic and legal niceties and launched a military attack. After a bloody battle in 1843 in which thousands of Sindhis were killed, the Talpurs were defeated and Sindh belonged to the British. From the Bhuttos’ point of view, the removal of the Talpurs opened up new opportunities. The family was by this time in the hands of a man, Doda Khan Bhutto, who proved more than equal to the task of managing the transition to British rule. As his great-great-great-great-granddaughter, the writer Fatima Bhutto, has pointed out, this involved not just diplomatic skill but also a capacity, if necessary, to use force. She has written that Doda rounded up 12\n\nTHE BHUTTOS AND THE COLONIALISTS Bhuttos from around Sindh and told them to settle land and cultivate it. Conflict between Bhuttos and Baloch tribesmen led to many casualties, and, often enough, the Bhuttos prevailed.18 But Doda Khan Bhutto did not rely on force alone: he had brains as well as brawn. General Napier had offered Sindhi landowners much the same deal as his tribal predecessors: if members of the local rural elite remained loyal and kept good order, Britain would reward them with land rights, titles and access to power. Certainly, there was no way of avoiding the British presence, even in remote rural areas. Just months after Napier’s conquest, for example, the British set up the Scinde Camel Corps near the Bhuttos in Larkana.19 Next came surveyors. As the Evening Mail recorded in March 1847: ‘A survey of a canal extending miles from the Sutlej into the Bhutto’s country is now in progress and active operations will in all likelihood follow the survey.’20 And when they reached the land occupied by members of what was described as the Bhutto tribe, the British were impressed by what had become of the village by which they had settled, observing in a parliamentary report: ‘Ruttah Deera about 20 miles from Larkhanah is the only other town of importance: it has a good bazaar and fort.’21 A few landowners resisted cooperating with the colonialists. But Doda Khan Bhutto was among the majority who tried to work with the new administration and see what he could get in return. It is a remarkable fact that when India’s First War of Independence, or Mutiny, came in 1857, just fourteen years after Napier’s conquest, it took only a couple of hundred British soldiers to maintain peace in the whole of Sindh. The area was so biddable in part because the main concern for Doda Khan Bhutto and others with similar amounts of wealth was to keep their property intact. The British top priority was to ensure the landowners remained loyal. Just how important this was to the British became clear with the Sind Encumbered Estates Act of 1876. Under the Talpurs, Sindhi Hindus had been forbidden from owning land. That’s not to say they were not commercially active. In fact, Sindh’s Hindus had a long tradition of business success. The British imperialist Richard Burton wrote that ‘throughout Sindh the Hindu element preponderates in the cities and towns, the Moslem in the country: the former everywhere represents capital, the latter labour’.22 It was the Hindus who collected taxes, lent money and managed trade. Nevertheless, a British decision to allow Sindh’s Hindus to own land tilted things in their favour, and with many Muslims heavily indebted to Hindu 13\n\nTHE BHUTTO DYNASTY financiers, some ended up losing their land to Hindu moneylenders. In 1896, a survey of villages in Sindh found that Hindus held 28 per cent of the land; fifty years earlier they had owned virtually none. The British were concerned. The Sindh commissioner Evan James complained that when Hindus obtained other people’s land through usury, the former owners were reduced to a state of abject dependence. ‘The feeling of injustice engendered by this tyranny strikes at the foundations of our rule,’ he said.23 The British worried that if the big estates were broken up, a crucial pillar of support in Sindh would be lost. Under the Sind Encumbered Estates Act a British manager could take over a bankrupt estate and declare many of its debts null and void. For the landowner there was a downside – the manager would take over ownership of the land until such time as the estate was solvent again – but once the books were balanced and the estate returned to profitability, it was given back to the landowner. Doda Khan Bhutto, sharp as well as forceful, was quick to exploit the Act. While some landowners held back, either to preserve their dignity or because they did not trust the British, Doda knew a good thing when he saw it and ensured that his estate was one of the first to be taken over. A manager, appointed in 1876, went through the books and confirmed Doda Khan was heavily in debt. Then, declaring that much of what Doda Khan owed was the result of exorbitant interest rates charged by Hindu moneylenders, the manager wrote off over half of his liabilities. At a stroke, Doda Khan’s situation was transformed. The remaining debts were dealt with by a government loan that the manager repaid from estate income over a five-year period. By 1884, Doda Khan’s finances were back in order and the land was restored to him. Throughout this process, Doda Khan had pushed his luck. British officials complained about the ‘persistently dishonest behaviour’ of Doda Khan and his sons, who somehow managed to ramp up the estate debts even when it was meant to be under the manager’s control. And at the start of the process, the Bhuttos had also significantly underestimated their income, giving the manager a false impression of how much help they needed. Doda Khan Bhutto told the British that he and his two sons had an income of 20,000 rupees and debts of 134,644 rupees. When the manager took over and did the sums, he reckoned that Doda’s income, without that of his two sons, was in fact 52,798 rupees.24 But these tactics worked well for Doda Khan. The year after he regained control of his estate, he was busy investing in the construction of a canal across some 14\n\nTHE BHUTTOS AND THE COLONIALISTS of his land.25 Doda Khan may have cooked the books, but he was loyal, and, for the British, that was all that mattered. A document that is kept in one of the Bhutto homes in Karachi and dated 1 January 1877 reveals the British thinking: ‘By command of his Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General, this certificate is presented in the name of her Most Gracious Majesty Victoria, Empress of India, to Doda Khan Bhoota in recognition of his loyalty and good service as a landholder’ (Plate 1). The British may have prided themselves on bringing the rule of law to Sindh, but they also taught the big families how to bend the law to their purpose and how to get away with infractions. Having said that, to think of all of the Bhuttos in the colonial period as nothing more than cynical operators subserviently expressing pro-British sentiment for private gain would be unfair. A few, as we shall see, clashed with the colonialists, albeit on personal rather than ideological grounds. Uncertainty within the family about what attitude to take towards the West remains a live issue to this day. The 1877 document praising Doda has been kept for posterity, but the Bhutto family member who currently possesses it, Ashiq Bhutto, once said he was so embarrassed by the British praise of Doda’s loyalty that he kept the document hidden away,26 although now it is on public display in his house. Then and now, the Bhuttos had conflicting impulses. The maintenance of personal honour was, no doubt, highly prized, and yet most managed to swallow their pride and live under British rule. Few Bhuttos saw much point in futile gestures of defiance. Some in later generations, such as Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto, could even be accused of having fawned to the British, gladly accepting their compliments and titles while keeping any resentments well hidden. In more recent times there have been similarly confused attitudes regarding the Americans. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was simultaneously impressed by and hostile to American power. When he went to California as a student, his social superiority in Sindh counted for nothing and he faced racial discrimination. Some of his antipathy to the West was firmly rooted in the history of colonial exploitation. In one article, he cited a series of Western studies which had tried to quantify just how much Britain had extracted from the subcontinent, concluding: ‘The effects of the wholesale destruction of the Indian manufacturing industries on the economy of the country can be imagined. In England the ruin of the old handloom weavers was accompanied by the growth 15\n\nTHE BHUTTO DYNASTY of the new machine industry. But in India the ruin of the millions of artisans and craftsmen was not accompanied by any alternative growth of new forms of industry.’27 His book The Myth of Independence 28 highlighted Western hypocrisy in its pursuit of economic domination, but, at the same time, he respected power and he wanted all his children educated in British and American universities. While Zulfikar had conflicted attitudes his daughter Benazir Bhutto was so pro-American that those in the Taliban who ordered her assassination cited that as one of the reasons to kill her. Admiration and respect for the West, mixed with cynicism about its double standards, has been a running theme of the Bhutto dynasty for many generations. In turn, Western attitudes to the Bhuttos determined the fortunes of the family. Whether the family flourished or floundered has been to a significant degree a function of Western policy, as developed first by the British colonialists and later by the Americans. By the end of the nineteenth century the Bhuttos were major landowners, but just how much they owned is disputed. When it suited him, Zulfikar could describe his holdings in modest terms. In December 1971, he told President Nixon that if he failed to win power he would ‘go back to his small ranch in Sindh’.29 But for all his socialist ideals, Zulfikar also used to insist with pride that his forebears were in the first rank of the Sindhi aristocracy. In his prison cell before he was hanged, he wrote: ‘My family has owned not thousands of acres but hundreds of thousands, for generations’.30 And he delighted in telling this story: Sir Charles Napier toured many parts of Sindh after its annexation by the British in 1843. It is said that every day after covering a considerable distance, Napier would ask his Sindhi guide, ‘Who owns this land?’ and every time the answer would be ‘The Bhuttos’. At one stage he told the man, ‘I’m tired and want to sleep. When we come to the place where the Bhutto lands finish, wake me up.’ The guide didn’t have to do so, and as Napier got up from a long spell of sleep he was amazed to learn that they were still in ‘Bhutto territory’.31\n\nZulfikar Ali Bhutto’s claims were, in fact, somewhat exaggerated. In the first place, like many other estates, the family’s tracts of land were not contiguous – 16\n\nTHE BHUTTOS AND THE COLONIALISTS Napier would have been moving in and out of Bhutto land as he travelled through northern Sindh. Secondly, even taken together, the Bhutto lands could in fact be measured in the tens, not hundreds, of thousands of acres. In the 1880s, Doda Khan had 30,000 acres in Upper Sindh, 6,709 acres in Ratodero, 21,026 acres in Jacobabad, 2,749 acres in Naushahro Abro and 919 acres in Larkana.32 That said, Zulfikar’s claim about hundreds of thousands of acres might have referred to the pre-British period. In his memoir about Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Chakar Ali Junejo wrote – without explanation – that ‘the legend goes that the 250,000 acres of Bhutto land had shrunk 50,000 acres after the British rule began in Sindh’.33 Nonetheless, having 30,000 acres in Upper Sindh put Doda Khan Bhutto in the first rank of farmers. In 1888 the British recorded that there were forty-four large landowners in the Upper Sindh town of Jacobabad, with an average holding of just 2,384 acres. And there was something else. The Bhuttos owned their land. As we shall see, that didn’t mean they could afford to alienate the British, but it did put them at something of an advantage compared to some of their peers who were more dependent on the colonialists’ largesse. From the 1850s, the British continued the practice they inherited from the previous tribal leadership whereby the central government granted land rights to important, loyal citizens who thereby became jaghirdars. In fact, the British not only continued the system, they refined it, creating four distinct classes of jaghirdar. The first-class jaghirdars – just fourteen individuals in total – mainly consisted of the heads of the old tribes of Sindh, many of them Baloch. The biggest of them, Ghaibi Khan Chandio, received a land grant of 148,024 acres or 230 square miles – more of a small state than an estate, and all of it on old tribal land.34 As the head of the Chandio tribe on the border with Balochistan, the British considered it vital he remain loyal. Jaghirdars – particularly the fourteen first-class ones – enjoyed great prestige, but they also had a problem: should they display disloyalty or should the family become less influential, they could have their land taken back by the British authorities. This most often happened when the existing jaghirdar died and the British judged the next generation insufficiently politically important to merit continued support. In general terms, the British wanted to reduce the number of jaghirdars so that they had to give out less land. Because they owned their land, the Bhuttos never had to worry about these issues. 17\n\nTHE BHUTTO DYNASTY At some point, most dynasties must survive a generation that loses interest in the creation and retention of wealth. In the Bhuttos’ case, that generation came in the late 1800s. Doda Khan Bhutto’s son, Khuda Bakhsh Khan Bhutto, was, like his father, determined to hold on to the family fortunes. But his son, Ghulam Murtaza Bhutto, had other priorities. The few shreds of evidence we have about Ghulam Murtaza suggest he was arrogant, contemptuous of the law and driven above all else by the values of honour and reputation. Ghulam Murtaza, whose portrait shows a man with a somewhat cocky smile (Plate 2), did as he pleased, not endearing himself to local opinion – for instance, turning up to the death anniversary of a local Sufi saint adorned with gold, even though it was an occasion that demanded modest clothes of mourning.35 The British records show that Ghulam Murtaza clashed with a British official, Colonel Alfred Hercules Mayhew, whose hostility to the Bhuttos became intense. As the Collector in Shikarpur between 1885 and 1898, Mayhew was the most senior British official in the Bhuttos’ area. Mayhew came under the authority of the Sindh commissioner in Karachi but, in an era of poor communications, he enjoyed a large degree of discretion and broad powers as he went about running the northern third of Sindh. Mayhew was a diehard colonialist who had headed out east in 1861 and stayed nearly four decades. The Bhuttos have recounted various different versions of the clashes between Mayhew and Ghulam Murtaza. The most detailed is in Sir Shahnawaz’s memoir, which claimed that Ghulam Murtaza fell for Colonel Mayhew’s Sindhi mistress. The suspicious colonel laid a trap, ostentatiously pretending to leave his Sukkur residence but in fact concealing himself to await developments. When Ghulam Murtaza rushed to his Sindhi lover, the colonel burst in and, finding them naked, lashed Ghulam Murtaza with a horsewhip. Ghulam Murtaza, unable to tolerate the insult, knocked Mayhew to the ground, grabbed the whip and lashed him back. As Mayhew nursed his wounds, Ghulam Murtaza left the scene, deposited his lover with her parents, and returned home. Ghulam Murtaza’s father, Khuda Bakhsh Khan Bhutto, advised his son to flee. He went first to the princely state of Bahawalpur, but when Mayhew established that he was there, he moved to Kabul, beyond British reach. According to the Shahnawaz memoir, Mayhew then induced some men to ambush Ghulam Murtaza’s father as he returned from inspecting some land in Jacobabad. The seventy-five-year-old man was thrown from his 18\n\nTHE BHUTTOS AND THE COLONIALISTS horse and died of his injuries. The death enabled Mayhew to declare that, since Ghulam Murtaza was an absconder, he had no right to inherit. In 1896, having auctioned off all the valuables he could find, he ordered that the Bhutto family house be burnt to the ground. No doubt Mayhew felt that British prestige had to be restored, but it was an extraordinary thing to do. Shahnawaz, who was just eight years old at the time, recorded the experience. ‘We saw the fire ablaze at night,’ he wrote. ‘In the morning we saw the ashes.’36 Shahnawaz’s account of how his father recovered from these setbacks is implausibly romantic. Having travelled in disguise from Kabul, Ghulam Murtaza pretended to be a labourer and, using the influence of an old feudal friend, got himself employed on a British building project of H.E.M. James, the most senior British official in Sindh. When James toured the construction site, Ghulam Murtaza stepped forward and said: ‘I have a story to tell and I want you to do justice by hearing me.’ Ghulam Murtaza was taken into custody and gave his version of his dispute with Mayhew. Subsequent members of the Bhutto family have come up with their own versions of these events. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto added a layer of political meaning by telling his children that the mistress was not Sindhi but English. And as he fled, Ghulam Murtaza worried that, should the British recapture the woman, he would suffer a loss of face, and so, with his honour at stake, ordered his men to kill her.37 On Fatima Bhutto’s account the woman was not just English (or maybe Anglo-Indian, she writes) but, in fact, the wife of the British official.38 Clearly these contradictory accounts cannot all be true: if there was a mistress, she could not simultaneously have been Sindhi, English and AngloIndian. The British archives are unsurprisingly silent on such a scandal, but it is safe to say that had she indeed been English, or even Anglo-Indian, the story would have attracted a lot more press attention. And it is likely that in the retelling of these various versions, politically helpful details have been added. Was Khuda Bakhsh Khan really thrown from his horse because of a British plot? Or did the old man just have an accident? The latter seems more likely. While Bhutto family lore leaves many open questions, the British archives do at least confirm the tension between Mayhew and Ghulam Murtaza and detail various legal cases which Mayhew brought against the young Bhutto. In one, eyewitnesses claimed to have seen Ghulam Murtaza murder Rao Jeramdas, a revenue officer in Ratodero. According to the eyewitness testimony preserved 19\n\nTHE BHUTTO DYNASTY in the Sindh archives, Ghulam Murtaza had been to see Jeramdas the day before the murder to discuss a report about the Bhuttos’ affairs that Jeramdas was writing for Mayhew. But rather than see him immediately, Jeramdas kept Ghulam Murtaza waiting for an hour and then only met with him briefly. Ghulam Murtaza, feeling his honour had been impugned, left complaining that Jeramdas had disrespected him and would ‘see’ him.39 That evening, Jeramdas set off for a nearby village where he was due to survey some crops. The next morning, he was found dead in his bed covered in blood. At much the same time as the body was found, Ghulam Murtaza, possibly attempting to give himself an alibi, walked into the chief constable’s office in Larkana to declare that he had lost a horse. The case against Ghulam Murtaza was considered weighty enough to justify two bail applications being turned down. The murder of a revenue official was a grave crime, and Mayhew was determined to bring the Bhuttos to heel, accusing them of having carried out thirteen murders without ever being caught, writing: ‘the legendary Doda Khan Bhutto and the family one and all have for years been notorious for their influence for Evil’.40 But he directed most of his anger at Ghulam Murtaza who, he believed, had murdered an honest and praiseworthy official whose intention had been ‘to bring this man Ghulam Murtaza Khuda Bux Bhutto to his senses and to make him end his wicked ways and to give up evil practices which are dishonest and criminal’.41 As these events faded into history, Mayhew’s dislike of the Bhuttos lost none of its intensity. In 1901, retired and back in London, he wrote to the secretary of state at the India Office, Lord George Hamilton, complaining that the governor of Bombay had prostituted himself by awarding one of the Bhuttos – Doda’s grandson Rasool Bakhsh Bhutto – a sword of honour in public durbar (a meeting or assembly). The letter, sent from Mayhew’s club, is so difficult to read that it is possible he was drunk when he wrote it, but it is clear that he thought the Bhutto awarded the sword of honour a ‘notorious bad character . . . and harbourer of thieves’.42 Sir Shahnawaz’s account assumes that all the legal cases brought against Ghulam Murtaza were blatantly false. In fact, the court records suggest that Ghulam Murtaza had a strong case to answer, but that the Bhuttos hired top lawyers and achieved repeated acquittals on various charges. Unable to accept defeat, Mayhew secured a retrial in Bombay, where Ghulam Murtaza was again acquitted and his property restored to him. But it was a Pyrrhic victory. Within 20\n\nTHE BHUTTOS AND THE COLONIALISTS a month of getting back home to Larkana, he had been poisoned to death: Sir Shahnawaz suspected local landowners who had earlier given evidence against his father and feared his taking revenge.43 Ghulam Murtaza’s experience entrenched the Bhuttos’ view that there was always a way around legal cases. It is a view that has recurred across the generations. By working within the legal system to secure acquittals, the Bhuttos were taking advantage of what many colonial administrators saw as a weakness in their judicial arrangements. If a British official such as Mayhew made accusations against someone such as Ghulam Murtaza and the court found him innocent, then Mayhew’s authority was undermined. From the point of view of the Bhuttos, however, the system meant they could behave in their locality much as they always had and then work on securing exoneration in the courts. Some landowners tried to reject the British system altogether. The Bhuttos played a subtler game of securing their objectives by working within it. For over a century now, many Bhuttos, from Ghulam Murtaza through to Bilawal, seem to have believed that making legal accusations against them is a political tool wielded by opponents. Sir Shahnawaz thought that of the cases against his father, and Bilawal Bhutto believes it of the cases against his father, Asif Zardari, today. As for Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, it is widely accepted that, whatever the merits of the case against him, he went on trial only because General Zia wanted to neutralise an opponent whom he feared. The family routinely describes his death as judicial murder and the courtroom where he was tried as a crime scene. Zulfikar’s conviction was unusual for a Bhutto: the family normally secures acquittals, and cases faced by Bhuttos not only in Pakistan but also in European jurisdictions have been subject to attempts at political pressure. But, of course, it’s a big step to believe, as the family seems to, that no Bhutto can ever be justly accused. The case of Shahnawaz’s cousin, Wahid Bakhsh Bhutto, an elected member of the Central Legislative Assembly of India, illustrates the point. In January 1929 he was arrested at his home in Larkana on the charge of abetting the kidnapping and murder of Khanzadi, a Hindu woman described by the Sunday Times as ‘unusually pretty’.44 Eighteen others, including his servant and a chauffeur, were also charged. The allegation was that Khanzadi’s husband had given information to the authorities which resulted in some of Wahid Bakhsh’s staff being jailed. Bhutto’s men then raped Khanzadi, and, after she became 21\n\nTHE BHUTTO DYNASTY pregnant, tried to force an abortion, which resulted in her death. As ever, the Bhuttos argued that the case was politically motivated, this time by Hindus who were determined to bring down an upstanding member of the Muslim community. Understanding that one of the ways to defeat a case is to control the process, Wahid Bakhsh Bhutto moved petitions to get the proceedings held outside Sindh; he offered to pay for all the witnesses to be transported to Bombay; and he suggested setting up a committee of inquiry to look into the case. When all those efforts were rebuffed, the family resorted to political pressure, eventually managing to persuade the British authorities to instruct the public prosecutor to withdraw the case.45 The scandal that ensued resulted in the first mention of a Bhutto in the British Parliament: when a backbencher asked the secretary of state for India why the case had been withdrawn, he was fobbed off with the reply that, since the process of withdrawing the case was not finalised, the matter was sub judice and could not be discussed.46 The Bhuttos’ long-standing ability to remain influential has depended not only on their management of legal cases but also on keeping their land holdings. This was achieved in large part by the practice of Bhutto men marrying female relatives, who were prohibited from marrying non-Bhuttos so as to avoid anyone who did not bear the family name inheriting Bhutto land. But there was another factor that often affected inheritance issues: the tendency of Bhutto men to die young. As a boy, Ghulam Murtaza’s son, Shahnawaz, looked set to become a relatively obscure member of the Bhutto family. Doda Khan Bhutto died in the early 1890s and his estate was divided between his sons; for reasons unknown, Shahnawaz’s branch of the family did not do very well, inheriting a relatively small acreage.47 Worse still, from Shahnawaz’s point of view, there was a good chance that even that land would not pass down to him because his father, Ghulam Murtaza, had at that point lost his right to own property. There were many other Bhuttos who looked set to inherit far more than Shahnawaz. Despite this unpromising start, Shahnawaz ended up with enough property to support his political career, although it took some surprising dynastic plot twists to get him there. As we have seen, his grandfather Khuda Bakhsh Khan died after falling off his horse. With Ghulam Murtaza in Afghan exile, Shahnawaz’s great-uncle Elahi Bakhsh took over his land. When Ghulam Murtaza won his court case in Karachi, he re-established his right to own and 22\n\nTHE BHUTTOS AND THE COLONIALISTS bequeath property, but when he was poisoned weeks later, the schoolboy Shahnawaz lost his father but inherited the land; his half-brother Ali Gohar Khan missed out because he was a single day younger than Shahnawaz. Elahi Bakhsh remained the far wealthier man, however. Having finished his schooling in 1908, Shahnawaz went to stay with Elahi Bakhsh in Upper Sindh. They had an evening meal together but never shared breakfast: the next morning the twenty-eight-year-old Elahi Bakhsh was found dead in his bathroom. The death was never explained. But even to this day, some members of the family whisper their dark suspicions about the possible involvement of Shahnawaz, citing as a motive his desire to increase his estates. Such grim accusations were not unusual within the family. Sayid Ghulam Mustafa Shah, a family friend from Upper Sindh, remarked that the Bhutto habit of nursing hereditary animosities meant ‘there was something ominous in the whole lot of them as they were constantly engaged in internecine intrigues, troubles and fights. Every Bhutto was enemy of every other Bhutto.’48 The Bhutto tendency to harbour grudges is well illustrated by another, probably apocryphal, family story. Benazir recalled how, having had four sons, Doda Khan married for the second time and produced a fifth, to whom he became very attached. He had already handed over his land in equal shares to his first four children, and now asked for the land to be given back so that he could redistribute it to include his youngest, and now favourite, son. Three agreed, but the eldest insisted that his share of the land was now his, that his youngest brother had no right to it and that he didn’t have to give it back. When Doda Khan refused to withdraw his request for the return of the land, the eldest son sold it overnight at a cheap price, saying he could do whatever he wanted with it. For Doda Khan, this breached the cardinal principle of feudal culture: that you never sell land. He disowned his son and said that if he died he would not weep but would drink a glass of milk – a sign of joy. Some years later the son did predecease Doda Khan, who duly ordered a glass of milk and was about to drink it when his second wife rushed over and threw it away. Only then did Doda Khan break down in tears to mourn his son.49 While there is no way to verify this tale, it nonetheless helps illustrate the kind of issues that Bhuttos discuss and worry about. To this day, fathers cut off sons who irritate them and one branch of the family will refuse to attend the marriage of Bhuttos in another branch. The most high-profile row of recent 23\n\nTHE BHUTTO DYNASTY years was between Benazir Bhutto and her brother Murtaza, but there are other examples, such as Mumtaz Bhutto, who has bad relations with some of his family. Shahnawaz was in a better position than other Bhuttos to take advantage of his wealth. His upbringing had given him more schooling than any previous member of the family. He started out in the Larkana Madrasah Middle School, an institution created for the children of wealthy local landlords and devoted to regular prayers, daily sport and the learning of English.50 He was thus prepared for his second school, the Sindh Madrassatul Islam in Karachi, which, a few years before Shahnawaz arrived, had educated the boy who went on to found Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Shahnawaz was given two rooms in the bungalow of the British principal, Mr Vines. The word madrasah today is associated with extreme religiosity and even Taliban-style militancy. But the British-funded Sindh Madrassatul Islam was part of a very different tradition: it was established in 1895 by followers of the educationalist Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, who had pioneered modern education for Indian Muslims in the more famous Aligargh Muslim University. The English-medium Karachi madrasah was designed to equip pupils to operate in the colonial administration. Shahnawaz was also influenced by a British official, H.C. Mules, who had taken over from Colonel Mayhew as the Collector for Sindh. A less tempestuous man than his predecessor, Mules took care of Shahnawaz. Like Vines, he was probably motivated in part by a desire to inculcate pro-British attitudes in a member of one of the elite families. If so, it worked. One of Shahnawaz’s friends, Hussain Shah Rashdi, later described how from a young age Shahnawaz ‘changed his lifestyle and was one of the first persons to switch over to the Western way of life’. As an adult he wore archetypically British clothing: suits, bow ties and, when occasion demanded, full ceremonial dress replete with medals and a sword. And he also developed a British attitude to punctuality: the Sindhi nationalist G.M. Syed, who worked with Shahnawaz in the 1920s and 1930s, recalled him embracing, as he put it, a modern way of life: ‘he followed strict timings for everything that he did’.51 Photographs of Shahnawaz show a man whose ample moustache and straight back gave him natural presence and bearing. He has been described as staid,52 but that does not quite capture someone who enjoyed the occasional vice. There is a tape recording in the British Library in which a retired Inspector 24\n\nTHE BHUTTOS AND THE COLONIALISTS General of Police in Sindh, Walter Pryde, described a chance encounter with Shahnawaz at Sukkur railway station: Shahnawaz was a man who used to drink far too much. He was a clever man but a very honest man . . . He loved the women and he loved drink. He had the money and he spent it. I remember early one morning I was at Sukkur and I was going off to Karachi. I was going to catch the Quetta Mail, which was passing through Sukkur. I was waiting at the station and Shahnawaz, drunken fellow, was there. And he was tight then and it was 6 o’clock in the morning.53\n\nA soft-spoken man who insisted on his dignity, Shahnawaz would not have enjoyed that description, although his ingrained aristocratic nature might have led him to dismiss Pryde as having an overly bourgeois sensibility. When he described himself, Shahnawaz portrayed a patrician fulfilling his duty to dispense beneficence to those less fortunate than himself. ‘I was courteous to the common man and rarely did I lose my temper,’ he wrote in the personal memoir seen by Wolpert, adding, as only a grandee could, ‘I spared no efforts to cultivate and befriend the masses.’ Shahnawaz was a stickler for codes of rank, dress and decorum. A friend, Syed Mir Mohammad Shah, recalled a horse and cattle show in Jacobabad in which the members of the Bombay Legislative Council were placed in the second row, behind the British officials. Shahnawaz was so outraged that he led a boycott of the event and fired off a letter of complaint to the governor of Bombay.54 Many a man in Shahnawaz’s position might have devoted himself to the two traditional activities of Sindhi aristocrats: maintaining family honour and hunting. But it was a time of change in India, and Shahnawaz had greater ambitions. As the century progressed, the British introduced reforms that enabled Indians to seek election to advisory bodies. Their powers were limited, but it opened up the possibility of political careers, and Shahnawaz took his chance. He began in 1910 with membership of the District Local Board in Larkana and in 1920 became its president, a post that would give him considerable authority in northern Sindh for over a decade. Shahnawaz’s tactics for maintaining control involved an unabashed use of patronage politics. He also introduced a process whereby he would make a decision and then send it to the 25\n\nTHE BHUTTO DYNASTY Board for subsequent ratification. Tiring of this, another local landowner, Ayub Khuhro, publicly objected, saying that if all the Board was going to do was support decisions that had already been taken, there was little point in its meeting. Ayub Khuhro’s daughter recalled how Shahnawaz reacted to this challenge: Bhutto was very alarmed at this sign of rebellion and realised that if allowed to go further this could mean more trouble from the members and an end to his dominance. He asked Khuhro to come and see him and explained in a fatherly way that it was dangerous to air his views or protest publicly in this hot headed youthful way and that he should understand that if there was open debate he would not be able to keep control over the Board and all kinds of elements would raise their voices. So, if Khuhro wanted anything in the way of scholarships or employment for his protégés or any other benefits Khuhro should come and see him and all would be settled in a gentlemanly manner with no fuss.55\n\nBy 1921 Sir Shahnawaz was sitting on the Bombay Legislative Council, and in 1925 he became president of the Sind Mohammedan Association – one of his obituarists claimed that he had become ‘the acknowledged leader of the Muslims’.56 But Sindh’s Muslims were by no means unified around one leader or one political stance. The Sindh Mohammedan Association had been founded in 1884 to ensure that Muslims got a greater share of the benefits on offer from the British colonialists and, in particular, representation on elected bodies at local and district level. But it was an organisation that espoused gradualism, and some of Sindh’s Muslims, particularly younger, urban ones, found it rather tame: they were more interested in political campaigns to protect Muslims from a resurgent Hindu nationalism. In the 1920s an issue emerged on which most of Sindh’s Muslims could agree: the separation of Sindh from the Bombay Presidency. It was a question with a long history. For a four-year period after Napier’s 1843 conquest, Sindh had been run as a separate entity before being brought under the control of British officials in Bombay. Many Sindhis – initially both Hindu and Muslim – came to resent this arrangement and demanded that Sindh should have more say in its own affairs, free of Bombay’s influence. They presented their arguments in terms of 26\n\nTHE BHUTTOS AND THE COLONIALISTS the distinct nature of Sindhi culture, but as time passed the issue took on a sectarian dimension, with Hindus coming to fear that separation could enable the Muslims to get the upper hand over Sindh’s minority Hindu community. Separation was eventually achieved in 1936, and Shahnawaz was among its most enthusiastic champions: ‘Sindh is free,’ he declared. ‘The first of April 1936 is the biggest day in modern times for Sindh, a fateful day. On this memorable day of the formal constitution of Sindh as a separate province we get a distinct and definite individuality, a sense of nationhood’.57 And it was fateful: the fact that Sindh was its own unit meant that, in 1943, Muslims in the Sindh Assembly easily passed a resolution backing the creation of Pakistan. In that way, separation made a crucial contribution to the establishment of Pakistan. To this day, many credit Shahnawaz with having spearheaded the campaign to achieve separation, and Wolpert described it as the ‘crowning political achievement of Shahnawaz’s life’.58 In fact, Sir Shahnawaz was one of the last major Muslim politicians in Sindh to back separation. In 1928 he served as chair of a Bombay Legislative Council subcommittee known as the Bombay Provincial Committee, which was charged with preparing recommendations on the working of the Indian constitution. Advocates of separation submitted evidence to press their case: The Province of Sindh has absolutely nothing in common with the Bombay Presidency. The union is based neither on ethnographic, geographic, linguistic, agricultural nor any other sound considerations. A mere accident that it was the army of the Bombay presidency that conquered Sindh is responsible for this un-natural arrangement. Our Province has suffered very much on this account. Educationally, economically, politically and socially we are far behind the Presidency . . . this Association strongly urges that the Province of Sindh should be separated from Bombay Presidency and given its own executive and legislative machinery.59\n\nWhen it came to the vote, separation was rejected, with Shahnawaz declaring it impractical.60 Another Muslim on the six-member committee dissented, issuing a minority report backing separation.61 Given his pro-British history it was reasonable to draw the conclusion that Shahnawaz was simply backing colonial officials who worried that Sindh was too economically weak 27\n\nTHE BHUTTO DYNASTY to support itself, although others have wondered if his view was partly based on personal factors: separation would bring an end to his living in Bombay – something he enjoyed.62 As political sentiment in India changed, Shahnawaz started to shift his position on a number of issues, including separation, which, by the time of the 1931 Round Table Conference in London, he came to support partly because he considered it the best way of confronting growing Hindu power in Sindh. His politics were often driven by sectarianism. As early as 1913, when he was just twenty-five, Shahnawaz had been a vocal defender of Muslim interests in the face of what he saw as Hindu encroachment. Muslim landowners, he said, ‘had to be saved from the Hindu money lender’ and the ‘creeping conquest of the Hindus into the rural heartland of Sind’.63 That same year his first public political act was to attend a meeting in Hyderabad in which landowners discussed the threat posed by Hindus buying land. Although Shahnawaz often spoke about intercommunal harmony, and, as we shall see, married a Hindu convert, his suspicion of the Hindu community remained with him throughout his life. His attitude was a reaction to the Hindus’ growing self-confidence under British rule. When Shahnawaz had been a boy, for example, Hindus in Sindh were second-class citizens to such an extent that there were areas they dared not even ride a horse for fear that it would cause offence to a Muslim grandee.64 By the time Shahnawaz was becoming an active politician, they had a far greater sense of their rights and demanded more equal treatment. He and many others resented it. As part of his work for the Bombay Provincial Committee, Sir Shahnawaz questioned a delegation from the All-Sind Hindu Association and took the opportunity to complain that Hindus were becoming more prosperous than Muslims and over-represented in the bureaucracy. When his Hindu interlocutor responded that that was because Hindus were more enterprising and better educated, Shahnawaz complained: ‘Since the British raj came I think about 22 lakhs [i.e., 2.2 million] of acres of land have passed to the Hindus, that is in the last 80 years, while they only had a few thousand acres before.’65 There are other examples of Sir Shahnawaz’s support for the status quo. The London Times reported in 1930 that as opposition to the British Raj grew, he had ‘been taking active part in opposing the civil disobedience movement’.66 And the Daily Mail approvingly cited his warning that ‘the next phase in the 28\n\nTHE BHUTTOS AND THE COLONIALISTS present agitation will be Bolshevism in its naked form’.67 In a letter to The Times in December 1930, Shahnawaz laid out his position on the big issues of the day. ‘Like every sober minded Indian,’ he wrote, ‘I stand for the British connexion’.68 His loyalty was amply rewarded. In time he became Sir Shahnawaz Khan CIE, OBE, OBI, that is to say he was made not only a knight – that came in 1930 – but also a Companion of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire, and an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, and an Officer of the Order of British India. Because Sir Shahnawaz had eventually put himself on the winning side of the separation issue, he was well placed to be the premier or chief minister of the new Sindh administration. Ahead of the first elections to the Sindh Legislative Assembly in 1937, he had been involved in the foundation of the Sindh United Party. According to its rhetoric, the party was meant to promote inter-communal harmony. In reality, however, while it did have a few Hindu members, it became a vehicle to advance the interests of elite Muslim politicians.69 And it did well, winning twenty-one of the twenty-eight seats it contested. But, on one of the rare occasions when the Larkana electorate rejected a Bhutto candidate, Shahnawaz failed to get elected to the Assembly. It was a shock, and there are various explanations for his defeat. Sir Shahnawaz’s opponent, Shaikh Abdul Majeed, was not even from Larkana, but he campaigned well, portraying Sir Shahnawaz as British and even Christian, suggesting he might be planning to impose a beard tax on Muslims.70 Sir Shahnawaz never took such claims seriously and was accused of overconfidence – he only turned up in his constituency a week before the vote and assumed that the normal tactic of paying voters for their support would work. Instead, as one of Sir Shahnawaz’s political associates put it: ‘Voters got the money from Sir Shahnawaz but voted for Shaikh Abdul Majeed.’71 The British Observer newspaper reported that the result was due to devious campaign tactics by his opponent: ‘Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto, who was everywhere regarded as the future Premier, was defeated by a converted Hindu owing to the circulation of leaflets containing an alleged message from Ambedkar, one of the leaders of the “Untouchables”, saying that if the convert were successful, 30,000 “Untouchables” would embrace Islam. This roused the greatest excitement amongst the Muslim public and produced a heavy poll in the hope of securing the mass conversion.’72 29\n\nTHE BHUTTO DYNASTY Zulfikar Ali Bhutto offered another explanation for Sir Shahnawaz’s election defeat: he is quoted as having told another Larkana landowner, ‘You know why my father lost the elections? It was because he was very pleasure loving and he was having an affair with Mrs. Parpia at the time which is why he delayed coming to Sind to organize his elections.’73 If that account is true – or even if it isn’t – then, just as in the Ghulam Murtaza saga, a Bhutto was taking pride in the male prowess involved in conducting an affair. The Parpia family was mentioned by Zulfikar’s sister Munawar ul-Islam when she recounted a story about how, as a boy, Zulfikar got lost in the grounds of the Parpias’ Bombay house.74 Whatever the cause of his defeat, Shahnawaz reacted to it by, at the age of forty-nine, giving up on elected politics, despite offers from some of his party colleagues to vacate their seats in the Sindh Assembly so that he could take their place. Instead he moved back to Bombay, where, as chairman of the Sindh Public Service Commission for a decade, he continued to mix with the elite in an official rather than political capacity. One admirer explained how Shahnawaz now ‘devoted himself to the task of getting as many Muslims employed in the then province of Sind as could not get a chance before his appointment’.75 As partition approached, Shahnawaz had one more public duty to perform. It concerned the question of what would become of one of the princely states. Because of the way the British had governed India, significant amounts of territory had remained, in theory, independent states, albeit under de facto British control. With the British leaving, the rulers of these states could supposedly make their own decisions about their future. While a few, such as the ruler of the fantastically wealthy Hyderabad, made unsuccessful bids for independence, the majority accepted the prevailing geopolitical reality and joined either Pakistan or India. In some places, however, there were difficulties. Kashmir, for example, had a Hindu ruler of a Muslim-majority population. The decision of that ruler, Raja Hari Singh, to opt for India led to violent conflict that continues to this day. The state of Junagadh on India’s west coast was in a diametrically opposed situation: there was a Muslim ruler of a Hindu-majority population. The Indian leadership believed that the nawab, or ruler, of Junagadh would opt for India, not Pakistan. The dewan, or prime minister, of the princely state had indicated that that would be the case, but in May 1947, just three months before independence, he had to go abroad for medical treatment and Sir 30\n\nTHE BHUTTOS AND THE COLONIALISTS Shahnawaz filled his place. Still confident that it had Junagadh in the bag, the Indian government sent an Instrument of Accession to the nawab for signature. But to India’s dismay, on 15 August, the very day the British withdrawal from the subcontinent was formally completed, the government of Junagadh announced it was acceding to Pakistan. The new Indian government, which accused Shahnawaz of having deliberately deceived it, only found out what had happened by reading press reports published on 17 August. Sir Shahnawaz received much praise in Pakistan for persuading the nawab of Junagadh to switch from a pro-India position to a pro-Pakistan one. Less has been said about what happened next. On 13 September Pakistan announced that it had accepted Junagadh’s accession. The new government in Delhi, however, ordered Indian troops to surround the princely state. On 19 September, V.P. Menon, the Indian minister charged with corralling recalcitrant princely states to join India, travelled to meet Sir Shahnawaz. In fact, he wanted to see the nawab, but Sir Shahnawaz insisted that that would be impossible: the nawab was ill and his son was also indisposed as he was playing cricket. Instead, the two men spoke with each other and, according to Menon, it was a conversation in which Sir Shahnawaz gave a lot of ground: he agreed he had made a mistake in not making more approaches to the government of India before finally announcing the accession of Junagadh to Pakistan; he admitted that there was no doubt that most people in the Hindu-majority state wanted to join India, and said he was in favour of the issue being decided by means of a referendum. But, he added, if his private opinion became known, his position in Junagadh would become untenable. With the troops around Junagadh enforcing a blockade, the state was effectively under siege. Food became scarce and, while Pakistan tried to help, it was unable to do so on a scale that made a material difference. Realising that his days were numbered, the nawab fled for Karachi, taking with him as much portable wealth and as many of his pet dogs as he could, leaving Sir Shahnawaz to write a letter to Mohammad Ali Jinnah in which he said that Junagadh’s principal sources of revenue had dried up and that food was in short supply. He urged Jinnah to discuss the state’s future with India. Meanwhile, the nawab sent Sir Shahnawaz a telegram from Karachi asking him to use his ‘judicious discrimination as the situation demanded’. On 5 November the Junagadh State Council decided that ‘the position arising out of the economic blockade, 31\n\nTHE BHUTTO DYNASTY inter-stately complications, external agitation and internal administrative difficulties make it necessary to have a complete reorientation of the State policy and a readjustment of relations with the two Dominions even if it involves a reversal of the earlier decision to accede to Pakistan’. Thus authorised, Sir Shahnawaz wrote a letter capitulating to the Indian government: ‘The Junagadh Government have requested that in order to avoid bloodshed, hardship, loss of life and property and to preserve the dynasty, you should be approached to give your assistance to the administration.’ Two days later the Indian troops marched in.76 With Pakistan unable to defend Junagadh, Sir Shahnawaz accepted an Indian takeover. Far more powerful princely states such as Hyderabad had also been unable to resist Indian might, and Sir Shahnawaz’s suggestion of a referendum was not as disadvantageous to Pakistan as it might have first appeared. True, the Hindus of Junagadh were bound to opt for India. But by holding a plebiscite – it eventually occurred in April 1948 – the Indian government had created a precedent for the same thing to happen in Kashmir. There are fringe voices on the internet who, to this day, describe Sir Shahnawaz as a traitor for his conduct in Junagadh, but they fail to take into account his limited options and discount too easily how he created a basis for a central element of Pakistan’s longstanding Kashmir policy: the demand for a popular vote there. Always keen to burnish the Bhutto dynasty’s image, in 1998 Benazir Bhutto organised a ‘national seminar’ on Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto, in which successive speakers heaped praise on her grandfather. But there was one aspect of his life that no one mentioned: his marriages. His first marriage was an entirely conventional union with a cousin, Amir Bano, entered into in order to preserve land holdings in the family. Nusrat Bhutto recalled that Shahnawaz’s first wife ‘was a conservative lady and a religious person. I accompanied her to Ziaraat to Najaf e Ashraf, Karbala, Baghdad. She used to wear a burka and asked me to wear it whenever I visited Larkana.’77 Shahnawaz had three sons and four daughters from the first marriage. In the normal course of events the sons would have inherited Shahnawaz’s vast estate, but, once again, the limited life expectancy of Bhutto males affected events. The oldest son, Mir Sikander Ali, died of pneumonia at the age of seven. The next in line, Imdad, succumbed to cirrhosis of the liver in 1950 when he was thirty-six. The third son, also called 32\n\nTHE BHUTTOS AND THE COLONIALISTS Mir Sikander Ali, who defied Shahnawaz by wearing his hair long and insisting he was an artist,78 also died before he reached fifty. It was said he died of pneumonia, but many suggested that, like Imdad, he succumbed to a high-living, playboy lifestyle. If Shahnawaz’s first marriage was conventional, the same cannot be said of his second. According to Nusrat Bhutto, ‘Sir Shah Nawaz’s first wife was very old and he wanted to marry again,’79 and he selected a younger woman: the generally accepted story is that, at the age of thirty-seven, he wed Lakhi Bai, an eighteen-year-old Hindu ‘dancing girl’, a phrase often used in South Asia as a euphemism for a courtesan – and while family members are loath to confirm her history, they don’t deny it either. When she converted, Lakhi Bai took the name Khurshid, and she lived with Sir Shahnawaz until his death. But that could not protect Zulfikar from the insults hurled at him as a result of his parentage. A political rival, the nawab of Kalabagh, for example, called his mother’s status into question.80 And the fact that she was a Hindu, poor and not related meant many Bhuttos considered the marriage scandalous. For all three reasons, she was ostracised within the family. Salman Taseer, whose biography of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto relied on briefings from the man himself, recorded: In 1924 Shahnawaz had fallen in love with, and married, an attractive Hindu girl who, before marriage, converted to Islam, changing her name to Khurshid. The ‘nikah’ was held in Quetta at the residence of the Nawab Bahadur Aazam Jan of Kalat. Khurshid’s humble origins were anathema to the feudal Bhuttos, and for a considerable period they remained adamantly opposed to the union. Even as a young boy, Zulfikar was aware of this clan hostility towards his mother and her anguish made a deep impression upon him. He never forgot his mother’s mortification at her treatment by the clan. ‘Poverty was her only crime’ he once said and even attributed his own equalitarian attitudes to his mother’s talk of the inequities of the feudal system.81\n\nThe remark about his mother’s poverty was something Zulfikar returned to in his death cell, writing to his daughter Benazir: ‘Your grand-father taught me the politics of pride, your grand-mother taught me the politics of poverty.’82 But there was in fact another aspect of Khurshid’s story. One of Zulfikar’s 33\n\nTHE BHUTTO DYNASTY fellow feudals in Sindh described helping Shahnawaz secretly book a train in Karachi that took him and his fiancée to their wedding in Quetta. According to Khuhro, she was in a burka and carrying a baby daughter in her arms.83 And there was another issue regarding the family tree that was a deep source of anxiety to Zulfikar throughout his life. Zulfikar believed that his mother was the offspring of, at best, a ‘temporary marriage’ between her mother and a wellknown Sindhi landowner, Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah. Throughout his life, Zulfikar would refer to Sir Ghulam’s descendants as his cousins.84 When she recalled her grandmother, Benazir said: ‘my grandmother was the offspring of the first marriage of her father. We don’t know much about her family except that when he remarried she was not well treated and was shipped off to look after aunts rather than being looked after.’85 One relative recalled that as a student in Oxford Zulfikar lay on his bed bemoaning the fact that ‘people say I am not a real Bhutto’,86 by which he meant that, unlike his relatives, he was not the product of successive generations of marriages within the family. The issue was so important to Zulfikar that one night when he was a student in London he raised it with his cousin Mumtaz. ‘You people in the family look down on my mother,’ Zulfikar said. When Mumtaz argued back, the two came to blows and had to be separated. But Zulfikar was right to believe that some of his relatives rejected his mother: when she died, some members of the Bhutto family said she should not be buried in the family graveyard.87 ‘His mother’s background had a damaging effect on him,’ Mumtaz later recalled. ‘He had a deep complex about that which made him more aggressive and intolerant. It affected his character quite adversely.’88 Another close relative and admirer of Zulfikar agrees. ‘His arrogance came out against his own class. I know from Sindhi landlords that when he was prime minister and these feudals would visit him, even if only to present an invitation to a child’s wedding, he would keep them waiting in the sun for hours to humiliate them completely. This was his way of fighting back for the way they treated his mother.’89 Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was very close to his mother, so much so that she accompanied him on his honeymoon with Nusrat – and more than that, on the first night of his honeymoon in a hotel in Turkey, Zulfikar, anxious about his mother’s unfamiliarity with travelling, shared a room with her rather than his new wife.90 But his concern that he had shakier genetic antecedents than all his cousins left him with a sense of inferiority that he was always fighting. His 34\n\nTHE BHUTTOS AND THE COLONIALISTS energy and personal drive arose partly out of his need to prove himself. And his mother affected him in another way. Traditionally, the Bhuttos had quite sectarian attitudes. Two of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s forebears had been accused of murdering Hindus, and his father Shahnawaz had railed against Hindu financiers. But even if, as we shall see, Zulfikar later failed the Ahmadi minority, in general terms he led the family to become much less sectarian, and Pakistan’s non-Muslim communities looked to it for protection. When they were in power, Benazir Bhutto and, perhaps more surprisingly, her husband, Asif Zardari, adopted pro-minority positions, at least to the extent that the political context in which they operated allowed them to. Dynasties are about attitudes passed down the generations, but successful ones are also able to change with the times and adopt new political values.\n\n35\n\n2\n\nZULFIKAR’S ASCENT\n\nZulfikar Ali Bhutto’s courage as he awaited death and his refusal to beg for mercy have been so thoroughly documented and widely admired that it is difficult to imagine him ever having been scared. But at the age of four, when Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto was away in London for the Round Table Conference, Zulfikar and his five-year-old elder sister Munawar were left behind in Larkana. By day, the servants thrilled the children with tales of a daring bandit who roamed the locality. At night, fearing the outlaw might break into their home, the two siblings retreated to beds on a rooftop courtyard and from time to time called out servants’ names to make sure they were still in earshot.1 Like many boys, Zulfikar enjoyed riding bikes, roaming the countryside and chasing rabbits. But he was also exposed, while being raised in Bombay, to the great and the good of colonial India, absorbing their political conversations and broad horizons. He was growing up in a time of political change in which traditionalists, reformists, democrats, revolutionaries, colonialists and Islamists jostled for control of the future. He was also taught – as were the offspring of all the big Sindhi landowners – that for all the internecine struggles between rival relatives, the family was always the reference point around which the rest of the world revolved. Nothing else mattered quite as much. Throughout his career Sir Shahnawaz had to deal with better-educated Indian and British counterparts, and he was determined that his son would not face the same handicap. In 1934, when Zulfikar was six, he was sent to a convent kindergarten in Karachi. There was then a period of some disruption as Sir Shahnawaz’s political responsibilities obliged him to move to Bombay, and then, with the separation of Sindh, back to Karachi, followed by the 1937 election defeat and a return to Bombay. After that, things settled down and Zulfikar was sent to the Bombay Cathedral School, which, having boys from 36\n\nZULFIKAR’S ASCENT British, Hindu, Parsi and Anglo-Indian families, added depth to his cultural influences. While it did not try to convert its pupils to Christianity, the school nonetheless inculcated British attitudes, and the teachers – many of them British nationals – inevitably became role models for their young Indian charges. Indeed, the Cathedral School and others like it existed largely because, as imperialist theorist and mid-nineteenth-century politician Lord Macaulay put it, Britain wanted to produce ‘a class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and in intellect’.2 In the case of Sir Shahnawaz, the British had achieved exactly that. But by the time the next generation was put through the system, some of the more independent-minded pupils, such as Zulfikar, railed against the attempt to inculcate pro-British sentiments. Zulfikar may have turned up each day dressed as an English boy scout, with shorts, a blazer and garters to hold up his socks, but he had ideas of his own. ‘There are many conflicts in me,’ he later reflected, ‘I’m aware of that. I try to reconcile them, overcome them, but I don’t succeed and I remain this strange mixture of Asia and Europe. I have a layman’s education and a Muslim’s upbringing. My mind is Western and my soul Eastern.’3 One schoolboy experience in particular brought home those contradictions. At the age of twelve Zulfikar became engaged to Shirin, a twenty-two-year-old first cousin and the daughter of Zulfikar’s uncle, Khan Bahadur Ahmed Khan Bhutto. Zulfikar later remembered objecting to the idea: ‘I didn’t even know what it meant to have a wife and when they tried to explain it to me I went out of my mind with rage. With fury. I didn’t want a wife, I wanted to play cricket.’4 Sir Shahnawaz only managed to make his son go through with it with the promise of a cricket kit from England. Like his father before him, Zulfikar’s first marriage was not for love, but for land: because of the alliance, Zulfikar later inherited a third of Khan Bahadur Ahmed Khan Bhutto’s estate. Shahnawaz may have had something else in mind when he arranged the marriage. Since Zulfikar’s mother was still not accepted by some Bhuttos as worthy of the family name, tying Zulfikar to another branch of the family removed any doubts about his status as a Bhutto. Shirin’s marriage with Zulfikar was an entirely pragmatic arrangement, but it was still a marriage and as such required the twelve-year-old Zulfikar to manage a marital relationship. It’s difficult to avoid the thought that his sometimes shallow relationships with women later in life had their origins in the schoolboy Zulfikar trying to prove himself to a "
