        "text": "IDEALS ARE JUST LIKE ORDINORY MEN AND HEROS ARE ALSO HUMAN-BEINGS. FOLLOWTHEM, BUT NOT WORSHIP AND ACCEPT THEM AS SOPPER NATURAL.LET US REMEMBERSHAHEED ALLAH BUX.\n\nBy. DUR MUHAMMAD PATHAN.\n\nWe are moving fast toward ideological slavery and are loudly crying for all kinds of sovereignty. What a contrast we are facing and believing! When our Role-Model is alive, we are not ready to spare him/her. We honors him/her with all kind of sorrows and longings. We refuse to accept and respect him/her. When he/she is dead, he/she becomes our Hero/Heroine. We still avoid to follow their teaching and own their philosophy, but start worshiping them. It is also our hypocrisy. We use their historical status so as earn our own name and fame. We try to prove our attachment with them. Where as every Hero/Heroine is an everlasting Ideal. Though, they are not but they are an ordinary like we people. Only their dedication, sincerity and devotion make the difference between them and we people. They must be treated as human-beings, but not supper-natural. Because such a type of approach will give the impression that we can not play our role like them and we can not get status in history as they got. Therefore, let us not block ways and as piration.Let us give the message to young generation that our Hero/Heroine left the task unfinished and fathers of our future have to complete it. We have made our Ideals worship-worthy. Therefore, Makhdoom Bilawal and Shah Inayat Shaheed, Zulfqar Ali Bhutto and Benazir, Allah Bux Soomro and G.M.Syed all have been made Pirs and Saints, but not philosophers of their own ideology. We have as rejected their philosphy and accepted their religious/spiritual position. Now, they are to help us not in ideological matters, but they are dead so as to help us and recommend our cases before Allah. Whereas, they all were human-beings like we people, but they played vital and ideal role in their respective field. They were not Supper-Natural. They also did good and some times bad. They also commited mistakes as they were human-beings. It is irony of fate that we are not told truth and so many thing are being hidden from us. Therefore we have no option, but to believe and accept them as supper-natural. For example, Shaheed Allah Bux Soomro was anIdeal. He was great freedom fighter, he believed in Hindu-Muslim unity. But,they are some aspects of his political performance, those left negative impacton our future politics. It is said, and I also believe that Sindh Muslim League wanted to get rid of him and it launched terrible movement for the restorationof Masjid Manzilgah of Sukkur. Not only more than 150 people were killed withmajorty of Hindus, but it made upper Sindh, specially Sukkur District(Including area now known as Rohri, Ghotki, Jarwar & Pano Aqil) astense-full area for ever. Sindh Muslim League took the case of Masjid Manzilgah in thelast quarter of 1938, when Sindh Provincial Conference was held at Karachi withQuaid-i-Azam in chair. But, what happened in the first quarter of 1938? It isbig event and it was the beginning of the bad event. No other, but ShaheedAllah Bux was responsible to reincarnate the dead issue of Masjid Manzilgah. Itis on record that much before the separation of Sindh, when K.B.Shaheed AllahBux Soomro was a member of the Bombay Legislative Council, he contributed fromhis pocket for renovation of Masjid Manzilgah. On the 3rd March1938, eleven days after assuming office of the Premier of Sindh, K.B. Allah BuxSoomro recorded a minutes on the MasjidManzigah which is as follow: â€œ In these days of democracy, it is necessary that both Hindus and Muslimans should be the studied endeavour of every democratic Government to aimat this achievement. From a perusal of record, it was apparent that Muslmans can not claim as ofright to have these domed buildings as Mosques. But there is sufficientmaterial in these papers to show that buildings are of antiquarian interest andthey were built by the Musliman rulers of India, and contain inscriptions inArabic to which the Muslimans no doubt attach some sort of sancity This proves beyond doubt that the buildings were intended to be treated as Wakf properties and therefore the Muslmans have right to their use. This facthas also been recognised by Government Officers before in allowing the Muslmansin erecting a Wall round the building. The only question that now arises, therefore, is whether these building scan be used for any purpose other than as Mosques. For this I want to invite an authoritative opinion from responsible Muhammadan theologists, who are well versed in law of Shariat, and also from the Legal Adviser of the Government. In Minutes of dated 12th of April, Shaheed AllahBux writes that â€œthe building is a Mosque. On the same date he orders M.Ishaqan officer for inspection of the site and buildings and furnish report onArabic inscription. On 14th of April, orders are issued andExecutive Engineer, Mathrani is asked to inspect and determine the date of construction of Mehrab. Both reports were not sufficient to satisfy him, hence an other joint inspection committee is constituted. On 14th of April 1938,K.B.Soomro sent Moulana Muhammad Sadiq of Khada and Hakim Fatih MuhammadSehwani to visit the site. They are given Demi Official letter for the DistricyAdminstration to assist/help them in finding facts. Both Religious Scholars andleaders of Jamiat-ul-Ulema Sindh declared in public meeting at Sukkur thatBuilding is Mosque and they will request Premier to restore it to Muslims. All this prove that K.B.Allah Bux was dealingwith the issue with Subjectivty and personal interest. He was advised by the Maantof Sadh Bello and his friend D.B.Issarsing that do not reopen the matterbecause it will give rise to bitterness between two communities. Inspite ofthat, Shaheed Allah Bux remained determined to resolve the issue. In real, hewas the opener of the issue. Either it was his political mistake, or he wascommunalist Muslim in his heart and mind. He re-introduced the Burning Issueand Sindh Muslim League converted it into fire later on. All most all leaders of Sindh Muslim League and Shaheed Allah Bux including some Hindu politicians are responsible for division of Sindh into Hindu and Muslim camps and their mistakes gave birth to very ugly event in the history of Sindh."
