It was constructed under the overall direction of Sir Charlton Harrison, CIE. On its completion it was opened by the Viceroy of India, Lord Willingdon. The scheme had been launched by the Governor of Bombay, Sir George Ambrose Lloyd (later known as Lord Lloyd) and it was named in his honour.[2]\n\nFunctioning\n\nSukkur Barrage is used to control water flow in the River Indus for the purposes of irrigation and flood control.\n\nThe barrage enables water to flow through what was originally a network of canals 6,166 miles (9,923 km) long, feeding the largest irrigation system in the world, with more than 5 million acres (20,000 km²) of irrigated land.\n\nThe retaining wall has 66 spans each 60 feet (18 m) wide. Each span has a gate weighing 50 tons.\n\nRanikot Fort\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nRanikot Fort رني ڪوٽ (Sindhi)\n\nur (Urdu) Ranikot Fort is the largest fort in the world.

Some archaeologists attribute it to Arabs, or possibly built by a Persian noble under the Abbasids by Imran Bin Musa Barmaki who was the Governor of Sindh in 836. Others have suggested a much earlier period of construction attributing to at times the Sassanians Persians and at times to the Greeks. Despite the fact that a prehistoric site of Amri is nearby, there is no trace of any old city inside the fort and the present structure has little evidence of prehistoric origins.It is located 30 km southwest of small town Sann,Sindh\n\nArchaeologists point to 17th century as its time of first construction but now Sindh archaeologists agree that some of the present structure was reconstructed by Mir Karam Ali Khan Talpur and his brother Mir Murad Ali in 1812 at a cost of 1.2 million rupees (Sindh Gazetteer, 677).[4]\n\nGallery\n\nMohenjo-daroFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nThis article is about the archaeological site Mohenjo-daro.

Mound of the Dead; English pronunciation: /moʊˌhɛn.dʒoʊ ˈdɑː.roʊ/) is an archeological site in the province of Sindh, Pakistan. Built around 2600 BCE, it was one of the largest settlements of the ancient Indus Valley Civilization, and one of the world’s earliest major urban settlements, contemporaneous with the civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Crete, and Norte Chico . Mohenjo-daro was abandoned in the 19th century BCE, and was not rediscovered until 1922. Significant excavation has since been conducted at the site of the city, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980.[2] The site is currently threatened by erosion and improper restoration.[3]\n\nMakli Hill\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nMakli Hill Tomb of Prince Sultan Ibrahim bin Mirza Muhammad Isa Tarkhan, Makli Hill Location of Makli Hill, Pakistan Details Location Thatta Country Pakistan Coordinates 24.753589°N 67.899783°E Type Sufi Number of graves 125,000 UNESCO World Heritage Site Official name Historical Monuments at Makli, Thatta Type Cultural Criteria iii Designated 1981 (5th session) Reference no. 143 State Party Pakistan Region Asia-Pacific\n\nMakli Hill is one of the largest necropolises in the world, with a diameter of approximately 8 km. It lies approx. 98 km east of Karachi and is the burial place of some 125,000 local rulers, Sufi saints and others. Makli is located on the outskirts of Thatta, the capital of lower Sindh until the seventeenth century, in what is the southeastern province of present-day Pakistan.[1] It was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1981[2] under the name of Historical Monuments of Thatta.\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n2 See also\n\n3 References\n\n4 External links\n\nHistory\n\nLegends abound about its inception, but it is often believed that the cemetery grew around the shrine of a fourteenth-century Sarwa, Muhammad Hussain Abro. According to other sources however, the credit for establishing Makli as a holy place for worship and burial goes to the immigrant saint, poet and scholar Shaikh Hammad Jamali and the then local ruler, Jam Tamachi.[3] Another legendary person buried at Makli is the saint Pir Murad (1428-1488).\n\nThe tombs and gravestones spread over the cemetery are material documents marking the social and political history of Sindh. Many have been build using a local sandstone, others are plastered brick buildings (which have suffered the most, generally). The impressive royal mausoleums are divided into two major groups, those from the Samma (1352–1520) and from the Tarkhan (1556–1592) period. In total four historical periods are represented architecturally, namely the Samma, the Arghun, the Tarkhan and the Mughals periods. The tomb (or maqbara) of the King Jam Nizamuddin II (reigned 1461–1508), is an impressive square structure built of sandstone and decorated with floral and geometric medallions. Similar to this is the mausoleum of Isa Khan Hussain II (d. 1651), a two-story stone building with majestic cupolas and balconies. In contrast to the synthetic architecture of these two monuments, which integrate Hindu and Islamic motifs, are mausoleums that clearly show the Central Asian roots of the Tarkhan and Moghul dynasties. An example is the tomb of Jan Beg Tarkhan (d. 1600), a typical octagonal brick structure whose dome is covered in blue and turquoise glazed tiles. Pavilion or canopy tombs (chattri maqbara or umbrella tomb) are another typical Indo-Islamic architectural feature, as well as enclosure tombs. the Moghul period is represented by many tombs on the southern side of the necropolis, including the mausoleum of Mirza Jani & Mirza Ghazi Baig, that of Nawab Shurfa Khan, the enclosure of Mirza Baqi Baig Uzbek and of Mirza Jan Baba as well as the impressive restored tomb of Nawab Isa Khan Tarkhan the Younger.\n\nToday, Makli Hill is a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site that is visited by both pilgrims and tourists, but in strong need of conservation and maintenance. The 2010 flooding unfortunately added to the deterioration of the site.[4]\n\nSketch plan of the necropolis as stated by information point\n\nTombs at Makli hill\n\nThe Quranic artwork at a decorated grave of one of the Sufi Saints in the necropolis\n\nPortico of tomb of Nawab Isa Khan the Younger\n\nCanopy tomb of Daya Khan R\n\nlal Shahbaz Qalandar\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nLal Shahbaz Qalandar Religion Islam, specifically the Suhrawardiyya Sufi order Other names Lal Shahbaz Qalandar Personal Born 1177\n\nMarwand, Afghanistan Died 1274\n\nSehwan, Sindh Senior posting Based in Sehwan, Najaf Title Shahbaz Period in office 12th/13th century Predecessor Baha-ud-din Zakariya Successor Syed Mehdi Raza Shah Subzwari\n\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.

(December 2012)\n\nSayed Muhammad Usman Marwandi[1] (1177–1274), known as Lal Shahbaz Qalandar (Sindhi: لال شھباز قلندر‎), was a Sufi philosopher-poet of present-day Pakistan. He belonged to the Suhrawardi order of Sufis. Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai, Makhdoom Bilawal and Sachal Sarmast were noted disciples of his.\n\nCalled Lal (red) after his usual red attire, Shahbaz to denote a noble and divine spirit and Qalandar for his Sufi affiliation, his mysticism attracted people from all religions and he preached brotherhood among Muslims and Hindus. Thousands of pilgrims visit his shrine in Sehwan every year on the anniversary of his death.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life\n\n2 Shrine\n\n3 Mela / Urs\n\n4 In poetry and prose\n\n5 See also\n\n6 References\n\n7 External links\n\nKotri Barrage\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nKotri Barrage\n\nکوٹری بیراج Waterway Indus River Country Pakistan State Sindh Maintained by Sindh Irrigation & Power Department[1] Operation Hydraulic First built 1955 Length 1,600 meters[2]\n\nKotri Barrage is a barrage on the Indus River near Hyderabad in the Sindh province of Pakistan. The barrage was completed in 1955. Kotri Barrage is used to control water flow in the River Indus for irrigation and flood control purposes.\n\nIt has a discharge capacity of 875,000 cusecs. It is a gate-controlled weir type barrage with a navigation lock. The barrage has 44 bays, each 60 feet (18 m) wide. The maximum flood level height of Kotri Barrage is 43.1 feet. It feeds Fulleli, Pinyari and Kolari Canals.\n\nSee also\n\nList of barrages and headworks in Pakistan\n\nList of dams and reservoirs in Pakistan\n\nShahjahan masjid\n\nTHistory\n\nThe mosque was built in 1647, during the reign of Mughal King Shah Jahan, as a gift to the people of Sindh for their hospitality.
