        "text": "Assalamuallaikum To All Of U PTI Supporters :) I would like to ask u some questions and i'd be glad if an inteligent and good supporter would like to answer this\n\n1- As In U Know I Support PPP. Most Of Ur brothers and collegues call me illiterate just on basis that i support PPP is it worth ? i am more educated than most of them. So is it fair to call one illiterate just because he has difference of opinion with you?\n\n2- Abusing is everything for u people ? i see in almost each thread u abuse my leader. :) can u quote a single example where i abused ur leader ? Arent u commiting a crime by abusing President Of Pakistan Who's Elected One Not Military One ?\n\n3- You people used to quote Hamid Meer when he said once in his show that me gawahi deta hun IK Saaf banda he. Nd Now u just abuse him because he told all media at their face that they were being spoon feeded by ISI ?\n\nSo u still stand up their ? if he said IK is clean ok i do agree. but i do agree with him that Cases on zardari were politicaly motivated. So u have to accept or decline both things u cant go along with both of things\n\n4- In our media their are some people who just speak in favour of IK and dont do anything else ? so if i was u i wud start abusing haroon rasheed and co? Is it really fair\n\n5- This country is here to remain its goin nowhere. let this government complete its term and go in elections comeback winning and u have the chance to rule thats it. Instead of abusing one isnt this better option ?\n\n6- You people atleast should encourage some good work done by this government. like the cabinet passed a bill estating that every individual who is paid from National Treasure he would have to declare his Assets. that means Now every major every judge would have to accept it\n\n7- Why dont u people critisize Army And Judiciary. Arent They Corrupt ? if major portion of ur budget is goin to Army shouldnt they be accountable ? would IK and others support This government and think something about it\n\n8- These so-called fair media, free judiciary and our respectable army are just pulling legs of government and want them to be sent home because This is lead By Sindhi . is it fair ? this is not my view this is Sindh's view.\n\n9- Is there any minority wing in PTI ?\n\n10- Would IK prefer giving ticket to youth in favour of Kusuri ?\n\n11- Can laws regarding feudal system be changed having biggest feudals in ur party ?\n\n12- Speaking against america and yet having one biggest pro america and pro israel diplomat in his party ?\n\n13- IK talked about Dr Aafia Sidiqi ? Mr kusuri handed himself her to Americans. so isnt their contradiction ?\n\n14- He said we would call out forces out of Baluchistan. Zardari being himself a baloch wouldnt want that murdering of his balouch brothers should stop ? would army ever do this ?\n\nDo Not Abuse Brothers Waiting for ur responses\n\nI Am Youth And Educated But Not Supporter Of Imran Khan\n\n1- As In U Know I Support PPP. Most Of Ur brothers and collegues call me illiterate just on basis that i support PPP is it worth ? i am more educated than most of them. So is it fair to call one illiterate just because he has difference of opinion with you?\n\nA- Its unfair to call ALL PPP supporters as illiterate. We know that PPP has produced very good politicians. Aitezaz Ahsan is one of the prominent figures. But as you call yourself educated, please refer back to PPP manifesto and tell us how much compliance has been done so far. PPP is causing death of the intellect and mainly run by the goons now. 68% of Pakistani population is illiterate and if we go by book definition of democracy then 2/3rd majority in the parliment should be of the illiterates so that we may easily ruin the country....PPP is mainly called class of illiterate coz of people like Jamshed Dasti, Abdul Qayum Jatoi, Raja Pervaiz Ashraf and the list goes on. When the people praise themselves on the basis of BEING JAILED FOR ???Corruption charges???\n\n2- Abusing is everything for u people ? i see in almost each thread u abuse my leader. :) can u quote a single example where i abused ur leader ? Arent u commiting a crime by abusing President Of Pakistan Who's Elected One Not Military One ?\n\nA- This is not a correct perception. But yes people do abuse. Just search Youtube and you would find ZA Butto abusing badly specially to Bengalis http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51I1WWXH0Gc. IK has asked his supporter not to abuse anyone. Now why people abuse? They do so when they see that IK is being blamed for no good reason. You ask one question from yourself and that is WHAT WRONG HAS BEEN DONE BY IK? What is the meaning of criticizing IK when he always has done good for the country. As far as abusing AAZ, tell us what good has he done?\n\n3- You people used to quote Hamid Meer when he said once in his show that me gawahi deta hun IK Saaf banda he. Nd Now u just abuse him because he told all media at their face that they were being spoon feeded by ISI ?\n\nSo u still stand up their ? if he said IK is clean ok i do agree. but i do agree with him that Cases on zardari were politicaly motivated. So u have to accept or decline both things u cant go along with both of things\n\nA- I agree that all cases against AAZ were politically motivated. Now understand the thin line. All the cases were based on weak assumptions. kyon k barian lagai howe hain. Both AAZ & NS are one and the same. How can one hit other so hard that he is eliminated out of scene? Now what IK is saying that we would put up an Independent NAB and then the entire nation would see the results. By the way, why AAZ is so reluctant to write to Swiss govenment? Ask yourself. 60 Million USD is in itself a weak cases i.e USD 60 million x 90 (RS/USD Parity) = Rs 5.4 Billion Rs which is nothing for a man like AAZ. Ye tou mandi main bethey chotay se aarti k liye bhi kuch nahi hai mere dost. That is why we are calling it cases based on mutual understanding between NS & AAZ.\n\n4- In our media their are some people who just speak in favour of IK and dont do anything else ? so if i was u i wud start abusing haroon rasheed and co? Is it really fair\n\nA- Haroon Rashid is in favour of IK. Thats true and you have all the right to criticize him for any wrong statements which are known to you. Abusing once again no good thing. One more thing, how would you know that people abusing belong to PTI and not other parties. Its a cyber world and please know its limitations.\n\n5- This country is here to remain its goin nowhere. let this government complete its term and go in elections comeback winning and u have the chance to rule thats it. Instead of abusing one isnt this better option ?\n\nA- Yes government must complete its term and thats what IK has said too. But PPP really now wants early elections + they want themselves to be booted out so that they could be called SIASI SHAHEED once again. See statements by Baber Awan, Rehman Malik etc to the Supreme court. Even Nawaz Sharif has tried to help them by going to the court. Analyse with independent mind. Moreover, exam se aik raat pehle tou nalaik student bhi kitab khol leta hai. Pakistan is ours and if the nalaik parties do some thing good, its good for Pakistan. But for future nation has made up its mind.\n\n6- You people atleast should encourage some good work done by this government. like the cabinet passed a bill estating that every individual who is paid from National Treasure he would have to declare his Assets. that means Now every major every judge would have to accept it\n\nA- All the rules and laws made are good. IMPLEMENTATION IS LACKED MAINLY. You know you give a budget annually and then escalate the prices every now and then... what is the meaning of annual budget then?\n\n7- Why dont u people critisize Army And Judiciary. Arent They Corrupt ? if major portion of ur budget is goin to Army shouldnt they be accountable ? would IK and others support This government and think something about it\n\nA- Please go back to Musharraf's regime and see what IK has been doing? Was he not criticizing army operations on its own people, Is he not talking to make Balochis our brothers and not a colony. IK EVEN BOYCOTTED THE ELECTION UNDER THE ARMY (please recall 1985 when BB did same and called it her biggest political mistake ever!) IK is firm on his stand of boycotting the election.\n\nAs far as Judiciary is concerced, Please read the Party name.\n\n8- These so-called fair media, free judiciary and our respectable army are just pulling legs of government and want them to be sent home because This is lead By Sindhi . is it fair ? this is not my view this is Sindh's view.\n\nA- Sindhis are very much annoyed by the performance of AAZ lead PPP government as in floods, IK, NS & many others were there but AAZ was in Paris. YRG was trying to collect fundings from international donors by hosting dinners in expensive hotels and none of the ambassadors donated. What a shame he brought to Pakistan? His wife doing shopping at Harolds amounting 800.000 EUR at one time... We all have seen fake camps visited by YRG. Please brother for Pakistan's sake, open your eyes and look into the future. ROTI KAPRA MAKAN is nothing but a lie.\n\n9- Is there any minority wing in PTI ?\n\nYes there is. the word minority is unfair in itself (I perceive) All nonmuslims have the standing in the Pakistani flag. Minorities are in PTI in large numbers.\n\n10- Would IK prefer giving ticket to youth in favour of Kusuri ?\n\nThe tickets decision is to be done by the ticketing committee lead by Justice (R) Wajeeh ud din. Further, how can I expect a ticket if I have not applied for one.\n\nYou are from PPP and you know quite well about Rural politics. Do u need to learn more?\n\n11- Can laws regarding feudal system be changed having biggest feudals in ur party ?\n\nA- Biggest feudal in Pakistan is Makdoom Ahmed Mahmood who is in PML-F, Biggest Makhdoom is Amin Fahim who is in PPP. Calling Javed Hashmi a big Makhdoom is accepted in a sense that he is amongst the top notch politicians praised all over Pakistan. If Javed Hashmi is a fued, we accept it.\n\n12- Speaking against america and yet having one biggest pro america and pro israel diplomat in his party ?\n\nA- Joe Biden said: We are negotiating with Talibans? IK used to say it since 9/11. Joe Biden has come to IK's stance not IK has gone to his. Like others, who say something else in public and sign some other documents. You know them well if you know PPP.\n\n13- IK talked about Dr Aafia Sidiqi ? Mr kusuri handed himself her to Americans. so isnt their contradiction ?\n\nA- It was Musharraf not Kasuri. Be clear. Secondly, PTI workers have been all the way there is Islamabad for the support of Missing people when no other parties were there. Once Khawaja Asif came and scolded Amina Masood Janjua and said: \" Do you expect me to address this small number of people?\" and wen away. I remember Ch Nisar saying that I would bring a resolution in NA in 2 days regarding missing persons. Those 2 days never came. Firdous Ashiq always told lies. Rehman Malik is the BIGGEST LIER ever known to Pakistanis. He always gave wrong dates and said we have all the missing persons, you will get them before Eid. AAZ never spoked about it. PTI workers have been there who used to face the police brutality intead of family members of missing people. Its a long list of PTI;s sacrifices in this regard that I know personally. PLEASE DONT MAKE ME TO WRITE ALL IN THIS PUBLIC FORUM.\n\n14- He said we would call out forces out of Baluchistan. Zardari being himself a baloch wouldnt want that murdering of his balouch brothers should stop ? would army ever do this ?\n\nA- What do u say? Should it be done or not? IK says yes and I say Yes. This has to be done sooner otherwise Balochistan will be a free country. AAZ saying so but has not done anything. Sorry to say, AAZ has been deceiving the nation. You can read it in the eyes of public. Same is the message for NS. You make your own decisions\n\nHope my responses could help you understand a little bit about PTI and IK. You can counter question too. You may support anyone as you like, BUT ask yourself why are you hating IK. He has joined the entire nation. All the right & left wingers, All Pakistanis (no punjabi, sindhi, baloch, pathan).\n\nRegards\n\nA PTI voter"
