        "text": "Preface\n\nThe Second century of the Hijra (AD 719-816) saw the emergence of a class of persons wearing garments of coarse undyed wool or Suf and came to be known as \"Sufis\" or the purified. The sifis sought not to be involved in wrong- doing, to nurturer a righteous spirit, and prayed for a clean heart and the renewal of the right spirit within.\n\nThe origin of Sufism was humble, its rise phenomenal, its development rapid, its influence widespread and its impact profound.\n\nSufism, born in Arabia, was in course of time reborn in other countries of the world. It conquered nations inturn and nations conquered it.\n\nThe Sufi saints, belonging to various Orders, in particular the Qadiri, the Chishti, the Suhrawardi, and the Naqshbandi, came to the Indian subcontinent by way of Multan and Sind to preach and to propagate the Gospel of Truth.\n\nBy their personal example as well as their precepts and preaching, they transformed and transfigured society, endowing it with new concepts, new values, renewed vigour, and a new lease of life.\n\nA new type of society came into being which had no invidious distinctions of caste, class, creed, or colour, and had, as its foundation, a deep routed humanism, a belief in social equality, universal brotherhood, equality of opportunity, an insistence on women's rights, protection of orphans and the handicapped, the right use of money, a sense of contentment, trust in God, emphasis on inner purification, hope belief, and faith, tolerance, a reliance on meditation, self-introspection, self-realisation, self-effacement, a belief in an ascetic life, self-help, mutual-help, selfless service, the dignity of individual and, above all, on love, which alone can transform and individual in a way nothing else can.\n\nIn the following pages an attempt has been made to describe and discuss in some detail the lives of the Sufi saints who have worked, preached, practiced, and died on the Indian subcontinent. Attention has been given to their antecedents, rituals, ascetic practices, initiation in the sufi Order, teachings sayings, and supernatural powers.\n\nI wish in conclusion to acknowledge with love and joy the interest evinced by Khurshid Hasan and Mohammad Siraj in the life and teachings of the Sufi saints. I am only too well aware of the labour that Mohammad Siraj put into typing the manuscript at personal inconvenience.\n\nMay the saints reward them suitably and provide them amply for their labour and for their sustained interest in the life and teachings on the Sufi saints. Amen!\n\nFrom the Jacket\n\nSufi - a man of the people called Sufiyah who profess the mystic principles of tasawwuf (mysticism). There are many silsilas (concatenations) in Sufis, but they are all agreed in their principal tenet- submission to a murshid (inspired guide). The great object of the mystic is to lose his own identity. The sole object of Sufism is to lead the wandering soul onward, stage by stage, until it reaches the desired goal- perfect union with the Divine Being.\n\nThis book The Sufi Saints of the Indian Subcontinent is a short biographical sketch of Sufiya-e-kiram (the generous mystics) of Indian subcontinent. If we want falaah wa behbood (Success and well-being) here faani (perishable) world and in aakhirat (the next world, life after death) which is baqa'e- davam (everlastingness), the teachings of Sufis (described in this book) will be very useful because Sufis have left a lasting legacy that will guide the people today and in future.\n\nHazrat Dr. Zahurul Hassan Sharib [(1914-96), Gudri Shah Baba IV, affectionately known as Zahur Miyan] was born in Moradabad, U. P. He received a doctorate in political Science and thereafter pursued a legal career.\n\nHowever, a deep interest in spiritual life steered him towards Sufism (Islamic mysticism). He moved to Ajmer, the city of the renowned Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Hasan Chishti, where he spent many years in the love and service of his pir-o-murshid (spiritual guide) Hazrat Nawab Khadim Hasan Shah Sahib, Gudri Shah Baba III. In 1971, upon the demise of his spiritual guide, Dr. Sharib succeeded as the Head of the Gudri Shahi Order of Sufis. Under his inspiring guidance, the Order gained momentum both in the East and the West.\n\nDr. Sharib was fluent in many languages, including some modern European languages. He has, to his credit, a vast number of publications in Urdu, English, Dutch, and Italian. Apart from writing books on mysticism, he has translated classical Persian poetry into other languages. He has also authored several books on rural sociology.\n\nDr. Sharib Passed away into the Mercy of the Almighty on April 8, 1996. His tomb at the Usmani Chilla at Ajmer, Rajasthan, attracts scores of people throughout the year. His'urs (death ceremony) is celebrated according to the lunar calendar on Ziq'ada 19 and 20 at his tomb.\n\nForeword\n\nThe subcontinent of India has been chosen by the Almighty as the home for the mystics and dervishes of various faiths and religious beliefs. Not only has the subcontinent seen the birth of saints, sufis and sannyasis, but even the fakirs and the dervishes from other countries have accepted it as their final abode. It is therefore not surprising to find a long list of accomplished sufi saints who made this subcontinent their final resting place.\n\nDr. Zahurul Hassan Sharib, or Zahur Miyan, as he was called affectionately, made it the purpose of his life to devote himself to the study of the life and teachings of saints and sufis. And later, he made the purpose larger by actually practising these teachings.\n\nAs the Head of the Gudri Shahi Order of sufis for over twenty-five years, Zahur Miyan affected the lives of thousands of people, who came to him from all over the world. Regardless of their caste, creed, country, religion, age or social stats, Zahur Miyan helped each person in the way that was appropriate for them.\n\nThis book constitutes an important milestone as it attempts to put in one place, the lives and teachings of major sufis saints of the subcontinent. However, the real magic of the book is that it is an account of the lives of saints by one amongst them.\n\nMay you be the recipient of the blessings of saints!\n\nContents\n\nForeword ix Preface xi 1 Hazrat Khawaja Moin-ud-din Hasan Chishti 1 2 Hazrat Khawaja Qutb-ud-din Bakhtyar Kaki 19 3 Hazrat Khawaja Fakhr-ud-din Abul-khair 30 4 Hazrat Qazi Hamid-ud-din of Nagore 31 5 Hazrat Sufi Hamid-ud-din of Nagore 35 6 Hazrat Shaikh Badr-ud-din Ghaznavi 36 7 Hazrat Shaikh Najib-ud-din Mutawakkil 41 8 Hazrat Khwaja Nizam-ud-din Ailiya 45 9 Hazrat Syed Ala-ud-din Ahmad Sabir 58 10 Hazrat Shaikh Sharf-ud-din Ahmad of Munir 67 11 Hazrat Shaikh Sharf-ud-din Bu Ali Qalandar 69 12 Hazrat Khwaja Husan-ud-din Soqta 71 13 Hazrat Nasir-ud-din Mahmud Chiragh of Delhi 72 14 Hazrat Shams-ud-din Turk of Panipat 77 15 Hazrat Amir Khusrau 80 16 Hazrat Maulana Fakhr-ud-din Marozi 85 17 Hazrat Maulana Ala-ud-din Nili 87 18 Hazrat Shaikh Burhan-ud-din Gharib 90 19 Hazrat Maulana Shams-ud-din Mohammad Yahya 92 20 Hazrat Qazi Mohi-ud-din of Kashan 95 21 Hazrat Khwaja Amir Hasan 99 22 Hazrat Shaikh Sadr-ud-din Tabib-e-Dilha 101 23 Hazrat Khwaja Zia-ud-din Nakhshabi 103 24 Hazrat Shaikh Kamal-ud-din 105 25 Hazrat Shaikh Jalal-ud-din of Panipat 108 26 Hazrat Shaikh Nur-ul-Haq Wad-din 112 27 Hazrat Shaikh Fath-ul-lah 114 28 Hazrat Khwaja Syed Mohammad Gesoo Daraz 115 29 Hazrat Shaikh Ahmad Abd-ul-Haq 122 30 Hazrat Syed Badi-ud-din Qutb-e-Madar 127 31 Hazrat Qutb-e- Alam 130 32 Hazrat Shaikh Abul-Fatah of Jaunpur 131 33 Hazrat Shaikh Mohammad Arif 132 34 Hazrat Shaikh Mohammad 134 35 Hazrat Syed Abd-ul-Malik 135 36 Hazrat Shaikh Sarang 136 37 Hazrat Shah Meena 138 38 Hazrat Shaikh Ahmad Khatto 142 39 Hazrat Mir Syed Ashraf Jahangir Simnani 144 40 Hazrat Syed Shah Buddhan 146 41 Hazrat Shaikh Abdullah Shattari 147 42 Hazrat Shaikh Darvesh Mohammad 148 43 Hazrat Shaikh Husain-ud-din of Manakpur 149 44 Hazrat Khwaja Husain of Nagore 151 45 Hazrat Shaikh Sa'd-ud-din of Khairabad 153 46 Hazrat Sama-ud-din Suhrawardi 154 47 Hazrat Shaikh Ahmad Mujad Shebani 159 48 Hazrat Khwaja Khanu 161 49 Hazrat Maulana Shah Jamali 162 50 Hazrat Shaikh Abd-ul-Quddus 165 51 Hazrat Shah Abd-ur Razzaq Jhungana 168 52 Hazrat Shaikh Hamza 169 53 Hazrat Shaikh Aman 170 54 Hazrat Shah Abd-ur-Rahman Janbaz Qalandar 172 55 Hazrat Shaikh Salim Chishti 175 56 Hazrat Shaikh Jalal-ud-din Mahmud 177 57 Hazrat Khwaja Baqi Billah 180 58 Hazrat Ahmad Mujaddid Alif Sani 184 59 Hazrat Shaikh Abu Sa'id 191 60 Hazrat Shah Abd-ul-Haq 194 61 Shaikh Mohammad Sadiq 199 62 Hazrat Syed Shah Amir Abul-Ila 201 63 Hazrat Sarmad 209 64 Hazrat Mir Syed Mohammad 214 65 Hazrat Syed Dost Mohammad 216 66 Hazrat Shaikh Dawood 219 67 Hazrat Shah Abul-Ma'ale 221 68 Hazrat Mohammad Sa'id Miran Shah Bhika 223 69 Hazrat Shah Mohammad Farhad 229 70 Hazrat Syed Nur Mohammad 231 71 Hazrat Shaikh Kalim-ul-lah of Shahjahanabad 233 72 Hazrat Shah Nizam-ud-din of Aurangabad 238 73 Hazrat Mohammed Sallim 241 74 Hazrat Shah Wali-ul-lah 242 75 Hazrat Mirza Jane-Janan Mazhar Shaheed 245 76 Hazrat Maulana Mohammad Fakhr-ud-din 250 77 Hazrat Shah Abul-Barkat 255 78 Hazrat Syed Mohammad Azam 257 79 Hazrat Shah Abd-ul-Aziz 259 80 Hazrat Hafiz Musa 264 81 Hazrat Shah Niyaz Ahmad 266 82 Hazrat Shah Mohammad Husain 270 83 Hazrat Shah Abu Sa'id 272 84 Hazrat Hafiz Syed Mohammad Husain 277 85 Hazrat Shah Nasir-ud-din 280 86 Hazrat Syed Mohammad Ghous Ali Shah 282 87 Hazrat Maulana Shah Fazle Rahman 285 88 Hazrat Maulana Syed Waris Ali Shah 289 89 Hazrat Syed Malik Mohammad Alam 292 90 Hazrat Qazi Abd-ur-Rahim Shah 293 91 Hazrat Nawab Gudri Shah Baba 294 92 Hazrat Data Ganj Bakhsh 297 93 Hazrat Shah Mohammad Yusuf Gurdezi 301 94 Hazrat Shaikh Jalal-ud-din 302 95 Hazrat Baba Farid-ud-din Mas'ud Ganj-e-Shakar 304 96 Hazrat Baha-ud-din Zakariya 313 97 Hazrat Shaikh Badr-ud-din Sulaiman 324 98 Hazrat Shaikh Sadr-ud-din Arif 326 99 Hazrat Shaikh Rukn-un-din Abul Fath 329 100 Hazrat Syed Jalal-ud-din Surq Bukhara 336 101 Hazrat Makhdoom Jahanian-e- Jahan Gasht 337 102 Hazrat Maulana Badr-ud-din Ishaq 349 103 Hazrat Shaikh Jamal-ud-din Ahmad 351 104 Hazrat Lal Shehbaz Qalandar 353 105 Hazrat Qutb-ud-din Manawwar 355 106 Hazrat Syed Sadr-ud-din Raja Qattal 356 107 Hazrat Kabir-ud-din Hasan 358 108 Hazrat Makhdoom Shaikh Mohammad 359 109 Hazrat Makhdoom Shaikh Abd-ul-Qadir 360 110 Hazrat Shaikh Dawood 362 111 Hazrat Miyan Mir 363 112 Hazrat Madhu Lal Husain 370 113 Hazrat Shah Abul-Ma'ali 376 114 Hazrat Sultan Bahu 379 115 Hazrat Bulleh Shah 383 116 Hazrat Shah Abd-ul-Latif 386 117 Hazrat Shaikh Dawood Jhani Wal 390 118 Hazrat Shah Bilawal 391 119 Hazrat Shah Kamal 392 120 Hazrat Shah Jamal 293 121 Hazrat Shah Chiragh 395 122 Hazrat Shah Abu Ishaq 396 123 Hazrat Dargahi Shah 397 124 Hazrat Khwaja Nur Mohammad 398 125 Hazrat Abdullah Shah Qadiri 401 126 Hazrat Khwaja Shah Mohammad Sulaiman 402 Glossary 405 Bibliography 407\n\nSample Pages"
