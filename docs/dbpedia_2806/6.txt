Sindh has a unique tradition of converting heroes into saints and place them at high pedestal for ever. Be it a poet, or a figher, or a commander of armies. Whoever took honour in safeguarding Sindh and struggled tooth and nail with his/her pen or sword or words or whatever against any onslaughts on motherland has been immortalized in Sindh's poetry, history and folklore. Makhddom Bilawal is one such character who is celebrated across all sections, sects, castes and colours of Sindh.

Makhdoom Bilawal was a sufi saint, philosopher and poet from Sindh, Pakistan. He was born in 1451 AD (856 AH) and died in 1522 AD (929 AH). He is also known as Makhdum Bilal or Bilali Makhdum. He is celebrated as a hero in Sindh for his resistance against the Argun invaders who tried to conquer his homeland. He was martyred in a very cruel way by being crushed alive in a seed grinder.

Makhdoom Bilawal belonged to the Samo tribe, which was one of the four major tribes of Sindh at that time. His father, Jam Hassan, was a respected leader and scholar of the tribe. Makhdoom Bilawal received his early education from his father and then from other eminent teachers of Sindh. He learned Arabic, Persian and Sindhi languages and became well-versed in Islamic sciences, philosophy and poetry. He also travelled to different regions of India and Central Asia to seek more knowledge and spiritual guidance.

Makhdoom Bilawal was not only a scholar but also a mystic and a poet. He followed the sufi path of love, devotion and service to God and humanity. He composed poems in Persian and Sindhi languages, expressing his mystical insights and experiences. Some of his poems are still preserved and recited by his followers and admirers. He also influenced other poets and saints of Sindh, such as Sayed Haider of Sann, who was his disciple.

Makhdoom Bilawal was also a brave warrior and a leader of his people. He witnessed the invasion of Sindh by the Arguns, who were descendants of the Mongols and ruled over parts of Afghanistan and Iran. The Arguns were ruthless and oppressive rulers who wanted to impose their religion and culture on the Sindhis. They also plundered the wealth and resources of Sindh and destroyed its temples, shrines and libraries. Makhdoom Bilawal resisted their aggression and mobilized his tribe and other Sindhis to fight against them. He formed an alliance with other local rulers, such as Rana Bhagwandas of Umerkot, Jam Nizamuddin II of Thatta and Mirza Isa Khan Tarkhan II of Tatta.

Makhdoom Bilawal fought several battles with the Arguns, most notably the Battle of Talti in 1521 AD (928 AH), where he inflicted a heavy defeat on them. However, he was betrayed by some of his allies who switched sides to the Arguns. He was captured by the enemy forces and taken to their camp at Baghban near Dadu. There he was tortured and asked to renounce his faith and accept the Argun rule. He refused to do so and remained steadfast in his beliefs. He was then executed by being crushed alive in a seed grinder on January 17, 1522 AD (30 Safar 929 AH). His martyrdom is considered as one of the most tragic events in Sindhi history.

Makhdoom Bilawal is revered as a saint, a hero and a national symbol by the Sindhis. His shrine is located at Baghban near Dadu, where thousands of people visit every year to pay their respects and seek his blessings. His poetry is also cherished as a source of inspiration and guidance for the Sindhis. He is regarded as one of the greatest figures of Sindhi culture and literature and history of Sindh.

Makhdoom Bilawal has become an undisputed symbol of resistance against injustice and invasions on mother land. Due to his contribution to the Sindhi history, culture and literature for his defence his homeland against foreign invaders with valour and dignity 'Bilwal' is a household name and people name their children as such out of utter respect for this national hero. Since Makhdoom Bilwal gave his life for his convictions and his people, he is an example of how one can achieve greatness. His memory is commemorated by naming various places after him. Many roads, libraries, neighbourhoods etc are named after Makhdoom Bilawal. Word 'Shaheed' (Martyr) is without fail precedes his name.
