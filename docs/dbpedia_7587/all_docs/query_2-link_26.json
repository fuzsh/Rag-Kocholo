        "text": "Abstract: In 1933 Godel Introduced an axiomatic system, currently known as S4, for a logic of an absolute provability. The problem of finding a fair probability model for S4 was left open. In the current paper we demonstrate how the Intuitionistic propositional logic Int can be directly realized by proof polynomials. It is shown that Int is complete with respect to this proof realizability.\n\nLet T be any of the three canonical truth theories CT− (Compositional truth without extra induction), FS− (Friedman–Sheard truth without extra induction), and KF− (Kripke–Feferman truth without extra induction), where the base theory of T is PA (Peano arithmetic). We show that T is feasibly reducible to PA, i.e., there is a polynomial time computable function f such that for any proof π of an arithmetical sentence φ in T , f(π) is a proof of φ in PA. In particular, T has at most polynomial speed-up over PA, in sharp contrast to the situation for T [B] for finitely axiomatizable base theories B."
