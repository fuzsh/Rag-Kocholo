This is AP's 11th published book of science.\n\nPreface:\n\nActually my title is too modest, for the proof that lies within this book makes it the World's First Valid Proof of Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, for in my modesty, I just wanted to emphasis that calculus was geometry and needed a geometry proof. Not being modest, there has never been a valid proof of FTC until AP's 2015 proof. This also implies that only a geometry proof of FTC constitutes a valid proof of FTC.\n\nCalculus needs a geometry proof of Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. But none could ever be obtained in Old Math so long as they had a huge mass of mistakes, errors, fakes and con-artist trickery such as the \"limit analysis\". To give a Geometry Proof of Fundamental Theorem of Calculus requires math be cleaned-up and cleaned-out of most of math's mistakes and errors. So in a sense, a Geometry FTC proof is a exercise in Consistency of all of Mathematics. In order to prove a FTC geometry proof, requires throwing out the error filled mess of Old Math. Can the Reals be the true numbers of mathematics if the Reals cannot deliver a Geometry proof of FTC? Can the functions that are not polynomial functions allow us to give a Geometry proof of FTC? Can a Coordinate System in 2D have 4 quadrants and still give a Geometry proof of FTC? Can a equation of mathematics with a number that is _not a positive decimal Grid Number_ all alone on the right side of the equation, at all times, allow us to give a Geometry proof of the FTC?\n\nCover Picture: Is my hand written, one page geometry proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the world's first geometry proof of FTC, 2013-2015, by AP.\n\nLength: 137 pages\n\nProduct details\n\nASIN : B07PQTNHMY\n\nPublication date : March 14, 2019\n\nLanguage : English\n\nFile size : 1307 KB\n\nText-to-Speech : Enabled\n\nScreen Reader : Supported\n\nEnhanced typesetting : Enabled\n\nX-Ray : Not Enabled\n\nWord Wise : Not Enabled\n\nPrint length : 137 pages\n\nLending : Enabled\n\nAmazon Best Sellers Rank: #128,729 Paid in Kindle Store (See Top 100 Paid in Kindle Store)\n\n#2 in 45-Minute Science & Math Short Reads\n\n\n\n#134 in Calculus (Books)\n\n#20 in Calculus (Kindle Store)\n\nOn Saturday, July 17, 2021 at 11:20:58 AM UTC-5, Archimedes Plutonium wrote:\n\n> Dr. Panchanathan's NSF govt spammer Kibo Parry M on why Weinberg, Glashow, Higgs fail physics with their never asking the question which is the atom's true real electron?

I want to keep it for its history value. AP advises all readers wanting to know the Plutonium Atom Totality theory to go to the 9th edition that is the latest up to date account of this theory. The reason AP wants to keep the 8th edition is because of Historical Value, for in this book, while writing it, caused the discovery of the real electron is the muon of atoms. The real proton of atoms is 840MeV and not the 938MeV that most books claim. The particle discovered by JJ Thomson in 1897 thinking he discovered the electron of atoms was actually the Dirac magnetic monopole at 0.5MeV. This discovery changes every, every science that uses atoms and electricity and magnetism, in other words, every science.\n\n>\n\n> Foreward:\n\n> I wrote the 8th edition of Atom Totality and near the end of writing it in 2017, I had my second greatest physics discovery.

So I desperately tried to include that discovery in my 8th edition and it is quite plain to see for I tried to write paragraphs after each chapter saying as much. I knew in 2017, that it was a great discovery, changing all the hard sciences, and reframing and restructuring all the hard sciences.\n\n> Length: 632 pages\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> Product details\n\n> File Size: 1132 KB\n\n> Print Length: 632 pages\n\n> Publication Date: March 11, 2019\n\n> Sold by: Amazon Digital Services LLC\n\n> Language: English\n\n> ASIN: B07PLP9NDR\n\n> Text-to-Speech: Enabled\n\n> X-Ray: Not Enabled\n\n> Word Wise: Enabled\n\n> Lending: Enabled\n\n> Screen Reader: Supported\n\n> Enhanced Typesetting: Enabled\n\n> Amazon Best Sellers Rank: #578,229 Paid in Kindle Store (See Top 100 Paid in Kindle Store)\n\n> #1610 in Physics (Kindle Store)\n\n> #8526 in Physics (Books)\n\n> #18851 in Biological Sciences (Books)\n\n>\n\n> #2-1, 137th published book\n\n>\n\n> Introduction to AP's TEACHING TRUE PHYSICS// Physics textbook series, book 1 Kindle Edition\n\n> by Archimedes Plutonium (Author)\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> #1 New Release in Electromagnetic Theory\n\n>\n\n> This will be AP's 137th published book on science.

It will be started in 2020 which is 60 years after Feynman. In the future, I request the physics community updates the premier physics textbook series at least every 30 years. For we can see that pattern of 30 years approximately from Faraday in 1830 to Maxwell in 1860 to Planck and Rutherford in about 1900, to Dirac in 1930 to Feynman in 1960 and finally to AP in 1990 and 2020. So much happens in physics after 30 years, that we need the revisions to take place in a timely manner.

So for senior year High School, I believe physics history is the best way of teaching physics. And in later years of physics courses, we can always pick up on details. So I devote this senior year High School physics to a history of physics, but only true physics.

Fleming Crim, Dorothy E Aronson, Brian Stone, James S Ulvestad, Rebecca Lynn Keiser, Vernon D. Ross, Lloyd Whitman, John J. Veysey, Scott Stanley, Sethuraman Panchanathan are you paying Kibo to stalk sci.math,\n\nIn the 1990s Univ Waterloo (correct me if wrong) hosted the archives of Usenet sci.math, sci.physics. And almost daily they posted a FAQ. In the FAQ was a broad warning to students that all manner of posts are in sci.math and sci.physics and that you should examine each post with a \"grain of salt\" or be highly speculative of what you read. Then around 1993, started this Stalking program of jerks being paid by governments to perpetually stalk posters. Then by end of 1990s, you never saw the FAQ, never saw the warnings. But all that remained was hyperactive goon clod paid stalkers.\n\nIt was a bad choice to make, to stop the FAQ and replace it with paid goon-squad stalkers like Kibo Parry Moroney or Dan Christensen and their allies. Bad choice because everyone can recognize cranks and crackpots, but hardly anyone can recognize people who think outside of the box.\n\nHow much is Dr. Panchanathan responsible for the 28 year long nonstop goon stalker Kibo Parry Moroney? Perhaps 0%, perhaps 50% perhaps 100%. And this is probably the reason the Wikipedia quote says-- > Many government and university installations blocked, threatened to block, or attempted to shut-down The World's Internet connection until Software Tool & Die was eventually granted permission by the National Science Foundation to provide public Internet access on \"an experimental basis.\"\n\n> --- end quote ---\n\nI remember the 1990s and many a professor and educator bulking at this idea of paying stalkers like Kibo Parry or like Dan Christensen, some saying that if students cannot recognize cranks and crackpots they never belonged in science in the first place.\n\nSo, what worked well was the idea of a Daily FAQ doing the warning, a daily FAQ warning newcomers and students that much of what they read here is full of error. But not the crazy idea of paid for stalkers, because, as I said, a stalker cannot identify a real scientist who is thinking outside the box.\n\nAnd one of the great reasons Usenet is mostly dead-- is because it is crisscrossed by mindless stalkers being paid handsomely for their banal stalking posts.\n\nSo, well, if you want to constantly stalk AP, then you can anticipate a constant reply of below.\n\nJan Burse complaining no-one at ETH asks the question, which is atom's real electron, is it the muon stuck inside a 840MeV proton torus doing the Faraday, or, is it the 0.5MeV particle that AP calls the Dirac magnetic monopole.

And I would not have discovered the true meaning of the Fine Structure Constant, for it was Feynman who showed us that FSC is really 0.0854, not that of 0.0072. All because 0.0854 is Psi, and Psi^2 is 0.0072.\n\nLength: 20 pages\n\nProduct details\n\n• ASIN : B0875SVDC7\n\n• Publication date : April 15, 2020\n\n• Language: : English\n\n• File size : 1134 KB\n\n• Text-to-Speech : Enabled\n\n• Screen Reader : Supported\n\n• Enhanced typesetting : Enabled\n\n• X-Ray : Not Enabled\n\n• Word Wise : Enabled\n\n• Print length : 20 pages\n\n• Lending : Enabled\n\n• Best Sellers Rank: #240,066 in Kindle Store (See Top 100 in Kindle Store)\n\n◦ #5 in 30-Minute Science & Math Short Reads\n\n◦ #65 in General Chemistry & Reference\n\n◦ #481 in Physics (Kindle Store)\n\n#1-6, 135th published book\n\nQED in Atom Totality theory where proton is a 8 ring torus and electron = muon inside proton doing Faraday Law// Atom Totality series, book 6 Kindle Edition\n\nby Archimedes Plutonium (Author)\n\nSince the real true electron of atoms is the muon and is a one ring bar magnet thrusting through the 8 ring torus of a proton, we need a whole entire new model of the hydrogen atom. Because the Bohr model with the 0.5MeV particle jumping orbitals as the explanation of Spectral Lines is all wrong. In this vacuum of explaining spectral line physics, comes the AP Model which simply states that the hydrogen atom creates Spectral lines because at any one instant of time 4 of the 8 proton rings is \"in view\" and the electricity coming from those 4 view rings creates spectral line physics.\n\nCover Picture: Is a imitation of the 8 ring proton torus, with my fingers holding on the proton ring that has the muon ring perpendicular and in the equatorial plane of the proton rings, thrusting through. This muon ring is the same size as the 8 proton rings making 9 x 105MeV = 945MeV of energy. The muon ring has to be perpendicular and lie on the equator of the proton torus. Surrounding the proton-torus would be neutrons as skin or coating cover and act as capacitors in storing the electricity produced by the proton+muon.\n\nProduct details\n\n• ASIN : B08K47K5BB\n\n• Publication date : September 25, 2020\n\n• Language : English\n\n• File size : 587 KB\n\n• Text-to-Speech : Enabled\n\n• Screen Reader : Supported\n\n• Enhanced typesetting : Enabled\n\n• X-Ray : Not Enabled\n\n• Word Wise : Not Enabled\n\n• Print length : 25 pages\n\n• Lending : Enabled\n\n• Best Sellers Rank: #291,001 in Kindle Store (See Top 100 in Kindle Store)\n\n◦ #13 in 45-Minute Science & Math Short Reads\n\n◦ #52 in General Chemistry & Reference\n\n◦ #334 in General Chemistry\n\n#1-7, 138th published book\n\nThe true NUCLEUS of Atoms are inner toruses moving around in circles of a larger outer torus// Rutherford, Geiger, Marsden Experiment revisited // Atom Totality Series, book 7 Kindle Edition\n\nby Archimedes Plutonium (Author)\n\nThe geometry of Atoms of the Table of Chemical Elements is torus geometry. We know this to be true for the torus geometry forms the maximum electricity production when using the Faraday Law. We see this in Old Physics with their tokamak toruses attempting to make fusion, by accelerating particles of the highest possible acceleration for the torus is that geometry. But the torus is the geometry not only of maximum acceleration but of maximum electrical generation by having a speeding bar magnet go around and around inside a torus== the Faraday law, where the torus rings are the copper closed wire loop. The protons of atoms are 8 loops of rings in a torus geometry, and the electron of atoms is the muon as bar magnet, almost the same size as the proton loops but small enough to fit inside proton loops. It is torus geometry that we investigate the geometry of all atoms.\n\nLength: 41 pages\n\nProduct details\n\n• Publication Date : October 9, 2020\n\n• File Size : 828 KB\n\n• Word Wise : Not Enabled\n\n• Print Length : 41 pages\n\n• ASIN : B08KZT5TCD\n\n• Language: : English\n\n• Text-to-Speech : Not enabled\n\n• Enhanced Typesetting : Enabled\n\n• Screen Reader : Supported\n\n• X-Ray : Not Enabled\n\n• Lending : Enabled\n\n#1-8, 1st published book\n\nAtom Totality Universe, 8th edition, 2017// A history log book: Atom Totality Series book 8 Kindle Edition\n\nby Archimedes Plutonium (Author)\n\nLast revision 7Apr2021. This was AP's first published science book.\n\nAdvisory: This is a difficult book to read and is AP's research log book of the Atom Totality in 2016-2017. I want to keep it for its history value. AP advises all readers wanting to know the Plutonium Atom Totality theory to go to the 9th edition that is the latest up to date account of this theory. The reason AP wants to keep the 8th edition is because of Historical Value, for in this book, while writing it, caused the discovery of the real electron is the muon of atoms. The real proton of atoms is 840MeV and not the 938MeV that most books claim. The particle discovered by JJ Thomson in 1897 thinking he discovered the electron of atoms was actually the Dirac magnetic monopole at 0.5MeV. This discovery changes every, every science that uses atoms and electricity and magnetism, in other words, every science.\n\nForeward:\n\nI wrote the 8th edition of Atom Totality and near the end of writing it in 2017, I had my second greatest physics discovery. I learned the real electron of atoms was the muon at 105MeV and not the tiny 0.5MeV particle that J.J.Thomson found in 1897. So I desperately tried to include that discovery in my 8th edition and it is quite plain to see for I tried to write paragraphs after each chapter saying as much. I knew in 2017, that it was a great discovery, changing all the hard sciences, and reframing and restructuring all the hard sciences.\n\nLength: 632 pages\n\nProduct details\n\nFile Size: 1132 KB\n\nPrint Length: 632 pages\n\nPublication Date: March 11, 2019\n\nSold by: Amazon Digital Services LLC\n\nLanguage: English\n\nASIN: B07PLP9NDR\n\nText-to-Speech: Enabled ￼\n\nX-Ray: Not Enabled ￼\n\nWord Wise: Enabled\n\nLending: Enabled\n\nScreen Reader: Supported ￼\n\nEnhanced Typesetting: Enabled ￼\n\nAmazon Best Sellers Rank: #578,229 Paid in Kindle Store (See Top 100 Paid in Kindle Store)\n\n#1610 in Physics (Kindle Store)\n\n#8526 in Physics (Books)\n\n#18851 in Biological Sciences (Books)\n\n#2-1, 137th published book\n\nIntroduction to AP's TEACHING TRUE PHYSICS// Physics textbook series, book 1 Kindle Edition\n\nby Archimedes Plutonium (Author)\n\n#1 New Release in Electromagnetic Theory\n\nThis will be AP's 137th published book on science. And the number 137 is special to me for it is the number of QED, Quantum Electrodynamics as the inverse fine structure constant. I can always remember 137 as that special constant of physics and so I can remember where Teaching True Physics was started by me.\n\nTime has come for the world to have the authoritative textbooks for all of High School and College education. Written by the leading physics expert of the time. The last such was Feynman in the 1960s with Feynman Lectures on Physics. The time before was Maxwell in 1860s with his books and Encyclopedia Britannica editorship. The time is ripe in 2020 for the new authoritative texts on physics. It will be started in 2020 which is 60 years after Feynman. In the future, I request the physics community updates the premier physics textbook series at least every 30 years. For we can see that pattern of 30 years approximately from Faraday in 1830 to Maxwell in 1860 to Planck and Rutherford in about 1900, to Dirac in 1930 to Feynman in 1960 and finally to AP in 1990 and 2020. So much happens in physics after 30 years, that we need the revisions to take place in a timely manner. But also, as we move to Internet publishing such as Amazon's Kindle, we can see that updates can take place very fast, as editing can be a ongoing monthly or yearly activity. I for one keep constantly updating all my published books, at least I try to.\n\nFeynman was the best to make the last authoritative textbook series for his concentration was QED, Quantum Electrodynamics, the pinnacle peak of physics during the 20th century. Of course the Atom Totality theory took over after 1990 and all of physics; for all sciences are under the Atom Totality theory.\n\nAnd as QED was the pinnacle peak before 1990, the new pinnacle peak is the Atom Totality theory. The Atom Totality theory is the advancement of QED, for the Atom Totality theory primal axiom says -- All is Atom, and atoms are nothing but Electricity and Magnetism.\n\nLength: 64 pages\n\nProduct details\n\n• File Size : 790 KB\n\n• Publication Date : October 5, 2020\n\n• Word Wise : Enabled\n\n• Print Length : 64 pages\n\n• Text-to-Speech : Not enabled\n\n• Screen Reader : Supported\n\n• Enhanced Typesetting : Enabled\n\n• X-Ray : Not Enabled\n\n• Language: : English\n\n• ASIN : B08KS4YGWY\n\n• Lending : Enabled\n\n• Best Sellers Rank: #430,602 in Kindle Store (See Top 100 in Kindle Store)\n\n◦ #39 in Electromagnetic Theory\n\n◦ #73 in Electromagnetism (Kindle Store)\n\n◦ #74 in 90-Minute Science & Math Short Reads\n\n#2-2, 145th published book\n\nTEACHING TRUE PHYSICS//Junior High School// Physics textbook series, book 2\n\nKindle Edition\n\nby Archimedes Plutonium (Author)\n\nWhat I am doing is clearing the field of physics, clearing it of all the silly mistakes and errors and beliefs that clutter up physics. Clearing it of its fraud and fakeries and con-artistry. I thought of doing these textbooks starting with Senior year High School, wherein I myself started learning physics. But because of so much fraud and fakery in physics education, I believe we have to drop down to Junior year High School to make a drastic and dramatic emphasis on fakery and con-artistry that so much pervades science and physics in particular. So that we have two years in High School to learn physics. And discard the nonsense of physics brainwash that Old Physics filled the halls and corridors of education.\n\nProduct details\n\n• ASIN : B08PC99JJB\n\n• Publication date : November 29, 2020\n\n• Language: : English\n\n• File size : 682 KB\n\n• Text-to-Speech : Enabled\n\n• Screen Reader : Supported\n\n• Enhanced typesetting : Enabled\n\n• X-Ray : Not Enabled\n\n• Word Wise : Enabled\n\n• Print length : 78 pages\n\n• Lending : Enabled\n\n• Best Sellers Rank: #185,995 in Kindle Store (See Top 100 in Kindle Store)\n\n◦ #42 in Two-Hour Science & Math Short Reads\n\n◦ #344 in Physics (Kindle Store)\n\n◦ #2,160 in Physics (Books)\n\n#2-3, 146th published book\n\nTEACHING TRUE PHYSICS// Senior High School// Physics textbook series, book 3\n\nKindle Edition\n\nby Archimedes Plutonium (Author)\n\nBooks in this series are.\n\nIntroduction to AP's TEACHING TRUE PHYSICS// Physics textbook series, book 1\n\nTEACHING TRUE PHYSICS High School junior year, book 2\n\nTEACHING TRUE PHYSICS High School senior year, book 3\n\nTEACHING TRUE PHYSICS 1st year college, book 4\n\nTEACHING TRUE PHYSICS Sophomore college, book 5\n\nTEACHING TRUE PHYSICS Junior college, book 6\n\nTEACHING TRUE PHYSICS Senior college, book 7\n\nPreface: I believe that in knowing the history of a science is knowing half of that science. And that if you are amiss of knowing the history behind a science, you have only a partial understanding of the concepts and ideas behind the science. I further believe it is easier to teach a science by teaching its history than any other means of teaching. So for senior year High School, I believe physics history is the best way of teaching physics. And in later years of physics courses, we can always pick up on details. So I devote this senior year High School physics to a history of physics, but only true physics. And there are few books written on the history of physics, so I chose Asimov's The History of Physics, 1966 as the template book for this textbook.\n\nProduct details\n\n• ASIN : B08RK33T8V\n\n• Publication date : December 28, 2020\n\n• Language: : English\n\n• File size : 917 KB\n\n• Text-to-Speech : Enabled\n\n• Screen Reader : Supported\n\n• Enhanced typesetting : Enabled\n\n• X-Ray : Not Enabled\n\n• Word Wise : Enabled\n\n• Print length : 114 pages\n\n• Lending : Enabled\n\n#3-1, 2nd published book\n\nTrue Chemistry: Chemistry Series, book 1 Kindle Edition\n\nby Archimedes Plutonium (Author)\n\nPhysics and chemistry made a mistake in 1897 for they thought that J.J.

Meaning that the real proton is 840MeV, real electron is 105 MeV= muon, and that little particle Thomson discovered was in fact the Dirac magnetic monopole. Dirac circa 1930s was looking for a magnetic monopole, and sadly, Dirac passed away before 2017, because if he had lived to 2017, he would have seen his long sought for magnetic monopole which is everywhere.\n\nCover picture: shows 3 isomers of CO2 and the O2 molecule.\n\nLength: 1150 pages\n\nProduct details\n\n• File Size : 2167 KB\n\n• ASIN : B07PLVMMSZ\n\n• Publication Date : March 11, 2019\n\n• Word Wise : Enabled\n\n• Print Length : 1150 pages\n\n• Language: : English\n\n• Text-to-Speech : Not enabled\n\n• Enhanced Typesetting : Enabled\n\n• X-Ray : Not Enabled\n\n• Lending : Enabled\n\nAmazon Best Sellers Rank: #590,212 Paid in Kindle Store (See Top 100 Paid in Kindle Store)\n\n#181 in General Chemistry & Reference\n\n#1324 in General Chemistry\n\n#1656 in Physics (Kindle Store)\n\nDan Christensen says he is a super rectum looking for victims James Leech, Arthur B.

But none could ever be obtained in Old Math so long as they had a huge mass of mistakes, errors, fakes and con-artist trickery such as the \"limit analysis\". To give a Geometry Proof of Fundamental Theorem of Calculus requires math be cleaned-up and cleaned-out of most of math's mistakes and errors. So in a sense, a Geometry FTC proof is a exercise in Consistency of all of Mathematics. In order to prove a FTC geometry proof, requires throwing out the error filled mess of Old Math. Can the Reals be the true numbers of mathematics if the Reals cannot deliver a Geometry proof of FTC? Can the functions that are not polynomial functions allow us to give a Geometry proof of FTC? Can a Coordinate System in 2D have 4 quadrants and still give a Geometry proof of FTC? Can a equation of mathematics with a number that is _not a positive decimal Grid Number_ all alone on the right side of the equation, at all times, allow us to give a Geometry proof of the FTC?\n\nCover Picture: Is my hand written, one page geometry proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the world's first geometry proof of FTC, 2013-2015, by AP.\n\nLength: 137 pages\n\nProduct details\n\nASIN : B07PQTNHMY\n\nPublication date : March 14, 2019\n\nLanguage : English\n\nFile size : 1307 KB\n\nText-to-Speech : Enabled\n\nScreen Reader : Supported\n\nEnhanced typesetting : Enabled\n\nX-Ray : Not Enabled\n\nWord Wise : Not Enabled\n\nPrint length : 137 pages\n\nLending : Enabled\n\nAmazon Best Sellers Rank: #128,729 Paid in Kindle Store (See Top 100 Paid in Kindle Store)\n\n#2 in 45-Minute Science & Math Short Reads\n\n\n\n#134 in Calculus (Books)\n\n#20 in Calculus (Kindle Store)\n\nOn Saturday, July 17, 2021 at 11:20:58 AM UTC-5, Archimedes Plutonium wrote:\n\n> Dr. Panchanathan's NSF govt spammer Kibo Parry M on why Weinberg, Glashow, Higgs fail physics with their never asking the question which is the atom's true real electron?

So AP has decided to put all NEW WORK, to his newsgroup. And there is little wonder because in AP's newsgroups, there is only solid pure science going on, not a gang of hate spewing misfits blighting the skies.\n\nIn sci.math, sci.physics there is only stalking hate spew along with Police Drag Net Spam of no value and other than hate spew there is Police drag net spam day and night.\n\nI re-opened the old newsgroup PAU of 1990s and there one can read my recent posts without the hassle of stalkers and spammers, Police Drag Net Spam that floods each and every day, book and solution manual spammers, off-topic-misfits, front-page-hogs, churning imbeciles, stalking mockers, suppression-bullies, and demonizers. And the taxpayer funded hate spew stalkers who ad hominem you day and night on every one of your posts.\n\nThere is no discussion of science in sci.math or sci.physics, just one long line of hate spewing stalkers followed up with Police Drag Net Spam (easy to spot-- very offtopic-- with hate charged content). And countries using sci.physics & sci.math as propaganda platforms, such as tampering in elections with their mind-rot.\n\nRead my recent posts in peace and quiet.\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/plutonium-atom-universe\n\nArchimedes Plutonium\n\nIn the 1990s Univ Waterloo (correct me if wrong) hosted the archives of Usenet sci.math, sci.physics. And almost daily they posted a FAQ. In the FAQ was a broad warning to students that all manner of posts are in sci.math and sci.physics and that you should examine each post with a \"grain of salt\" or be highly speculative of what you read. Then around 1993, started this Stalking program of jerks being paid by governments to perpetually stalk posters. Then by end of 1990s, you never saw the FAQ, never saw the warnings. But all that remained was hyperactive goon clod paid stalkers.\n\nIt was a bad choice to make, to stop the FAQ and replace it with paid goon-squad stalkers like Kibo Parry Moroney or Dan Christensen and their allies. Bad choice because everyone can recognize cranks and crackpots, but hardly anyone can recognize people who think outside of the box.\n\nHow much is Dr. Panchanathan responsible for the 28 year long nonstop goon stalker Kibo Parry Moroney? Perhaps 0%, perhaps 50% perhaps 100%. And this is probably the reason the Wikipedia quote says-- > Many government and university installations blocked, threatened to block, or attempted to shut-down The World's Internet connection until Software Tool & Die was eventually granted permission by the National Science Foundation to provide public Internet access on \"an experimental basis.\"\n\n> --- end quote ---\n\n"
