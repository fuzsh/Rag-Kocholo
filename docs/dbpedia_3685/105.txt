WASHINGTON, DC - The Washington Nationals have named former George Washington University baseball player Michael O'Connor its organization's Minor League Pitcher of the Year, announced during a ceremony prior to Thursday's game against the San Francisco Giants at RFK Stadium.

O'Connor, who played for the Colonials from 1999-2002, pitched this season for the Potomac Nationals of the Carolina League (Class A Advanced).

The Ellicott City, MD native went 10-11 with a 3.54 ERA (66 ER/167.2 IP) in 26 starts. O'Connor limited opposing Carolina League batters to a .229 batting average, and ranked among C.L. leaders in wins (tied for sixth), strikeouts (second with 158), complete games (tied for first with two) and innings pitched (tied for first with 167.2).

O'Connor, 25, led the Nationals minor league system in strikeouts and tied for first with 10 wins. His 3.54 ERA ranked fourth among Nationals farmhands.
