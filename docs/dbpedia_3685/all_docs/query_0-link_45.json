On June 11, 2020, FCCLA celebrated its 75th anniversary and legacy of making a difference in families, careers, and communities across America.\n\nSince 1945, FCCLA has been addressing important personal, work, and societal issues through Family and Consumer Sciences (FCS) education—previously known as Home Economics. At its height, the organization’s membership peaked at 607,175 with members from 53 state associations, including Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Dolly Parton, Reba McEntire, and Bo Jackson are a few of FCCLA’s most nationally recognized alumni.\n\nToday, more than ten million students have been involved in FCCLA and have changed countless lives around the country by participating in National Programs, competing in Competitive Events, exploring Career Pathways, and attending national conferences. FCCLA continues to be the only Career and Technical Student Organization focused on preparing youth for careers that support families and strengthens members employability skills by preparing students to be college-and career-ready."
