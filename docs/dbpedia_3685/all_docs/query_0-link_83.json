It will be updated regularly.\n\n©Society for History in the Federal Government (www.shfg.org)\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n1636 Pilgrim Code of Law\n\nThe Pilgrim Code of Law was the first covenant with many basic elements of a constitution. It built upon earlier covenants, including charters and the Mayflower Compact, and was based on popular sovereignty with annual elections. It created an institutional framework with a General Court (legislature) that elected a governor and seven assistants as a council. It specified the powers of officials, required oaths, and provided trial by jury.\n\nLink: http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/pilgrim-code-of-law/\n\nReading: Donald S. Lutz, The Origins of American Constitutionalism (1988)\n\n1775–1791 First U.S. Currency issued\n\nThe Continental Congress issued paper money, known as “continentals.”\n\n1776 Declaration of Independence\n\nOn June 10, 1776, the Continental Congress appointed a committee of John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Robert Livingston, and Roger Sherman to draft a document expressing the intent of the 13 colonies to declare independence as states. Jefferson penned the original draft, the committee presented a revised version to the Continental Congress on July 2, and the Congress redrafted it before adopting the final version on July 4, 1776. In the months that followed, the Declaration garnered key signatures from representatives of each colony.\n\nLink: https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript\n\nReading: Allen Jayne, Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence: Origins, Philosophy, & Theology (1998)\n\n1777–1781 Articles of Confederation\n\nOn June 11, 1776, the Second Continental Congress established a committee of representatives from each colony to establish a confederated government for the United States. The Articles of Confederation established a weak government (lacking a military and unable to levy taxes) tasked with facilitating a firm league of friendship between the states rather than a centralized federal government. The Articles of Confederation were adopted on November 15, 1777, but it took until March 1, 1781, to secure the unanimous ratification of the states.\n\nLink: http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/artconf.asp\n\nReading: Gordon S. Wood Creation of the American Republic 1776–1787 (1969)\n\n1778 The Treasury System was reorganized\n\nOn September 26, the Continental Congress created an Auditor, Office of Comptroller, Office of Treasurer and two Chambers of Accounts. A committee was also selected to design the Seal of the Treasury.\n\n1786 Virginia Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom\n\nFirst introduced in the Virginia state legislature in 1777, the Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom barred the establishment of religious tests for public office as well as any compelled participation in, or subsidization of, religious enterprises. Thomas Jefferson was the primary author of the bill, which states that “to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical” since citizens must be free to support whichever churches they prefer. Section III of the bill warns that if it were ever repealed by a future statute, that such a statute was procedurally allowable but that it would violate natural rights of religious freedom.\n\nLink: https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-02-02-0132-0004-0082\n\nReading: Merrill Peterson and Robert Vaughan, eds., The Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom: Its Evolution and Consequences in American History (1988)\n\n1787 Constitution of the United States\n\nThe Constitutional Convention, which met in Philadelphia on May 14, 1787, was originally tasked with amending the Articles of Confederation to make them workable, since the existing confederation was too weak to protect members from foreign invaders and too ineffectual to preserve the union. With George Washington presiding, the delegates determined that a new constitutional order was needed for the union to survive. The product of many minds, the United States Constitution is a monument of visionary statesmanship and practical compromise. In designing a new constitutional order, the learned framers relied on historical examples from ancient civilizations like Athens, their own experiences with the British and colonial models of government, and the recommendations of contemporary theorists like Montesquieu. Central issues discussed at the convention included the division and separation of powers within the federal government, the allocation of congressional representation between the states, and the extent to which members of the federal government could be elected by (and held accountable to) American citizens. The Constitution was produced in secret and signed into law on September 17, 1787.\n\nLink: https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution\n\nReading: Akhil Reed Amar, America’s Constitution (2005)\n\nThe Constitution mandates a congressional journal\n\nArticle I, Section 5, requires Congress to keep a “Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same”\n\n1787–1788 Federalist Papers\n\nPublished under the penname “Publius,” the Federalist Papers comprise 85 essays authored by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, to persuade New York citizens to support the Constitution’s ratification. The Federalist Papers are still consulted by historians and lawyers to uncover the original intentions of the Constitution’s drafters, and to understand theoretical justifications for key constitutional provisions. Papers 10 and 51 are particularly famous for explaining the problem of factions in large republics and the importance of a system of checks and balances, respectively.\n\nLink: http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/fed.asp\n\nNorthwest Ordinance\n\nOriginally titled “An Ordinance for the Government of the Territory of the United States North-West of the River Ohio,” the Northwest Ordinance established several key policies for the unsettled northwestern frontier. Among other things, the Northwest Ordinance required that the Northwest Territory be divided into three to five states, it established procedures for admitting new states into the Union, and it provided a bill of rights. Other provisions even forbade slavery and promoted public education. The Northwest Ordinance became law on July 13, 1787.\n\nLink: http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/nworder.asp\n\n1789–1791 Bill of Rights\n\nPursuant to Article V of the United States Constitution, Congress proposed and the states ratified the first 10 amendments now known as the Bill of Rights. The passage of the Bill of Rights placated opponents of the Constitution who feared that the unamended version gave too much leeway to the federal government to encroach on the rights of states and individual citizens. This fear was expressed through several state conventions that ratified the Constitution while requesting swift approval of the amendments. On September 25, 1789, the first Congress offered 12 amendments, and all but the first 2 were ratified by the states on December 15, 1791. Among other things, the Bill of Rights protects the freedoms of speech and religion; the right to bear arms; the right to due process, including a trial by jury; and liberty from warrantless searches and seizures, and from cruel and unusual punishment. The Bill of Rights also recognizes the need to protect unenumerated rights and the rights reserved to the states and to individual citizens.\n\nLink: https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights\n\nReading: Akhil Reed Amar, The Bill of Rights: Creation and Reconstruction (1998)\n\n1789 Federal Judiciary Act\n\nSigned into law on September 24, 1789, the Federal Judiciary Act established the structure and jurisdiction of federal courts, matters that Article III of the United States Constitution left unaddressed. The Federal Judiciary Act recognized the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court found in Article III and gave it appellate jurisdiction in cases arising from federal circuit courts and from state court rulings that rejected federal claims. The Federal Judiciary Act established a structural model that, with slight modifications, still thrives today.\n\nLink: https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/judiciary.html\n\nReading: Maeva Marcus, ed., Origins of the Federal Judiciary: Essays on the Judiciary Act of 1789 (1992)\n\nFirst U.S. veterans pension law\n\nThe first United States veterans pension law was approved during the first session of the U.S. Congress for invalid Revolutionary War soldiers on September 29, 1789.\n\nThe Fifth Act of Congress\n\nOn July 31, Congress established the United States Customs Service.\n\nDepartment of the Treasury established\n\nOn September 2, President Washington approved of Congress’s proposal to create the Department of the Treasury.

It imposed an excise tax on distilled liquors and was called the “whiskey tax.”\n\nReadings: Carol Berkin, The Crises of the 1790s and the Birth of American Nationalism (2017)\n\n1794 11th Amendment\n\nPassed by Congress on March 4, 1794, the 11th Amendment changed part of Article III, Section 2, of the United States Constitution to protect states against certain lawsuits in federal courts. The amendment was a legislative reaction against Chisholm v. Georgia (1793), a Supreme Court case recognizing a lawsuit brought by a South Carolina citizen against the state of Georgia for unpaid debts incurred in the War for Independence. The Supreme Court determined that, based on the text of Article III, a state could, in fact, be sued in federal court by citizens of other states. The 11th Amendment prohibited such suits, and it was ratified on February 7, 1795.\n\nLink: https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxi\n\n1796 President Washington’s Farewell Address\n\nAfter refusing to consider the presidency for a third term, George Washington prepared and delivered a handwritten farewell speech to the American people. The speech originally spanned 32 pages, and it was distributed in newspapers on September 19, 1796. In it, President Washington encouraged United States citizens to recognize that liberty is based on private virtue, and that both depend for their vitality on religious faith. The speech also warns against the corrosive effects of political factions and cautions against entanglements in the affairs of foreign nations.\n\nLink: https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washing.asp\n\nSeat of Government established\n\nAn Act of Congress on May 6 authorized a loan for the establishment of the seat government in Washington, DC.

It was the first federal agency to be responsible for direct public assistance, helping nearly four million newly freed blacks transition from slavery. Commissioner Gen. Oliver O. Howard headed the bureau, helped by assistant commissioners in 11 former Confederate states and the border states of Maryland, Kentucky, and West Virginia and Washington, DC. The bureau helped freedpeople with education, food, housing, medical care, and employment; helped them secure labor contracts, legalize marriages, and locate lost relatives; and worked with African American soldiers and sailors and their heirs to secure back pay, bounty payments, and pensions. Bureau officers manned special courts to adjudicate disputes where local courts were discriminatory. The bureau was to be temporary and was undermanned and underfunded. Faced with a resurgence of white violence and oppressive racial laws, and pressure from white southerners, Congress disbanded the bureau in summer 1872. The bureau was transformative in providing blacks with a direct, protective relationship with the federal government— thus establishing the premise of citizenship for freedmen.\n\nLink: https://www.archives.gov/research/african-americans/freedmens-bureau\n\nReadings: Paul Cimbala and Randall Miller, Freedmen’s Bureau and Reconstruction (New York: Fordham University Press, 1999); Chandra Manning, Troubled Refuge: Struggling for Freedom in the Civil War (New York: Vintage Books, 2017)\n\n13th Amendment\n\nAdopted on December 18, it abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime.\n\nNational Asylum Act\n\nOrigins of today’s VA hospitals were authorized by Congress on March 3, 1865. as the first National Soldiers & Sailors Asylum for disabled veterans of the Union Army’s volunteer forces.

All nationally chartered banks were required to join one of the 8–12 districts in the Federal Reserve System. The central bank issued Federal Reserve Notes and provided check clearing and collection for all members of the Federal Reserve, which purchased stock in their regional Reserve Bank and had to maintain non-interest bearing reserves to promote solvency. The Reserve’s Board of Governors was to foster long-term growth of the monetary system in conjunction with the nation’s ability to increase production, thus advancing employment, stable prices, and “moderate long-term interest rates.” The central bank was to retain independence from Congress and the executive branch, but its actions to contain inflation and regulate growth, especially in times of economic panic or recession, have been controversial.\n\nLinks: https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/fract.htm; https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/federal_reserve_act_signed\n\nReadings: West, Robert Craig.

The Department’s Historian’s Office (HO), responsible for publication of the Foreign Relations series, faced strong criticism from the historical community for incomplete coverage in FRUS volumes, particularly on Latin America and Iran (little information on covert operations), and for a lag in publication of volumes. State historians lacked access to many classified documents and could not provide copies of “excised” items to reviewers in its Historical Advisory committee (HAC). Senator Claiborne Pell and others responded to the crisis seeking legislation that would promote “a full and honest account of American foreign policy.” The new law allowed HO historians access to all documents over 26 years old from national security and foreign policymaking agencies. The HAC gained authority to inspect documents “not cleared for publication in FRUS.” The law enabled progress in production of volumes that were more “thorough, accurate, and reliable” on a 30-year schedule, but it could not resolve all issues related to declassification.\n\nLink: https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus-history\n\nReading: William B.
