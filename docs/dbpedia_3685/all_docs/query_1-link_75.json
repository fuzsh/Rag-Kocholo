        "text": "2024 Annual Tax Sale\n\nNotice is hereby given that all real properties described on the list below, for which real property taxes or vault rents (including penalties and interest, if applicable) were levied and in arrears on October 1, 2023, for which Business Improvement District (BID) taxes (including penalties and interest, if applicable) were levied and in arrears before September 1, 2023, or for which any other tax certified to the Office of Tax and Revenue (OTR) for collection hereunder remains unpaid, shall be sold at public auction to the highest bidder at the 2024 Real Property Tax Sale (Sale). The Sale shall be held pursuant to D.C. Official Code § 47-1330, et. seq.\n\nThe Sale shall begin on Wednesday, July 17, 2024, and continue, except Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, until all the real properties available for sale are sold. During each day, the Sale shall be conducted from 8:30 am until 12 noon and from 1 pm until 4 pm or until all the real properties scheduled for sale for that day are sold. The Sale shall occur at OTR, located at 1101 4th Street, SW, Suites W244 and W250, Washington, DC 20024.\n\nAll real properties are listed below in square, suffix and lot, or parcel and lot, number order. The name of the owner of record and premise address of each real property are also stated. The list also states condominium unit and parking space numbers, if available. Certain real properties on the list do not have street numbers or premise addresses; therefore, none can be provided. A real property without a street number is generally stated on the list as having “0” as a street address number. Real properties are sold as described by their square, suffix and lot, or parcel and lot, numbers; such property descriptions may be viewed on a property map (e.g., DC Atlas Plus). Real properties may be removed from the list at the discretion of OTR.\n\nThe list states the amount for which each real property may be sold at the Sale; an additional $200.00 Tax Sale Fee shall be added at the time of the sale. The stated amount for which a real property may be offered for sale can be lower than what an owner would have to pay in order to prevent the real property from being sold. Owners must contact OTR to determine the amount that must be paid in order to avoid the sale of their real properties. Purchasers must be aware that additional liabilities, which are not reflected in the total amount for which the real properties are offered at the Sale, may be due and owing on real properties and such additional liabilities may include liens previously sold to a third party. A purchaser at the Sale acts at his or her own risk and must exercise due diligence in selecting real properties upon which to bid in good faith.\n\nAt the Sale, the purchaser acquires a certificate of sale to the real property that may ripen into title if the owner (or other party with an interest) fails to redeem. The owner (or other party with an interest) has a statutory right to redeem the real property until his or her equity of redemption has been foreclosed by the purchaser’s lawsuit. If the owner (or other party with an interest) fails to redeem the real property, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia may order that a deed be issued to the purchaser after the purchaser pays all taxes, costs, and expenses. The purchaser shall monitor their portfolio for the status of tax payments being made by accessing the purchaser’s log-in view on OTR’s website at MyTax.DC.gov.\n\nA certificate of sale shall be canceled if, inter alia, it is later determined that the delinquent taxes, including accrued interest and penalties, were satisfied before the end of the last day of the Sale. The date of sale of any real property shall be deemed to be the last day of the Sale, regardless of the actual day of the Sale during which the real property was offered and sold. The certificates of sale shall indicate the date of sale as being the last day of the Sale.\n\nPurchasers shall have filed Form FR-500, Combined Business Tax Registration Application, prior to registering. This form should be filed online by visiting OTR’s website, MyTax.DC.gov. A potential purchaser, including a natural person or business entity delinquent in the payment of in rem taxes (e.g. real property taxes) to the District, or one who has been convicted of a felony involving fraud, deceit, moral turpitude, or anti-competitive behavior, may not bid at the Sale or otherwise acquire an interest in real property sold at the Sale. A potential purchaser, including a natural person or business entity, must certify that such purchaser: 1) is not more than one year in arrears in any jurisdiction in the payment of in rem taxes not being contested in good faith; and, 2) has not been convicted in any jurisdiction of a felony involving fraud, deceit, moral turpitude, or anti-competitive behavior.\n\nRegistration for the Sale is mandatory and begins Monday, July 1, 2024, online via MyTax.DC.gov. Registration continues until the final day of the Sale. Prior to bidding at the Sale, a purchaser of real property must have made a deposit of at least 20% of the total purchase price. ALL PAYMENTS MUST BE MADE TO THE D.C. TREASURER BY CASH, CERTIFIED CHECK, CASHIER’S CHECK, POSTAL MONEY ORDER, OR BANK WIRE.\n\nOTR is conducting four public seminars to explain tax sale procedures. Potential purchasers are highly encouraged to attend a seminar and review the District of Columbia 2024 Real Property Tax Sale Informational Guide (FAQ) available on the OTR Tax Sale webpage. To enroll in a seminar, please register online via MyTax.DC.gov. The seminars will be held online via Webex platform, on Wednesday, June 26, 2024, and Thursday, June 27, 2024. The Webex invitation link will be sent to the email you have provided at the time of registration. On each day, the first seminar will take place from 9:30 am until 12 pm, and the second from 1:30 pm until 4 pm. During each of the four seminars, OTR will generally explain the tax sale process and follow up with a question and answer period. The seminars are free and all are welcome. To enroll in a seminar, please register online via MyTax.DC.gov. Enrollment is mandatory for anyone planning to attend one of the seminars. Enrollment will be granted on a first-come/first-served basis and will continue until all available slots are taken.\n\nA person with a communication impairment requiring an interpreter for the Sale shall notify OTR of the need for an interpreter no later than July 10, 2024, if they will be attending the Sale on July 17, 2024, and by July 11, 2024, if they will be attending the Sale on July 18, 2024. If an interpreter is required for the public seminars, OTR shall be notified no later than June 19, 2024 (if appearing at the seminar on June 26, 2024) and by June 20, 2024 (if appearing at the seminar on June 27, 2024).
