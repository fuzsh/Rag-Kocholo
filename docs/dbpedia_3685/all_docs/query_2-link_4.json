        "text": "Statute\n\nThe Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (PSQIA) establishes a voluntary reporting system designed to enhance the data available to assess and resolve patient safety and health care quality issues. To encourage the reporting and analysis of medical errors, PSQIA provides Federal privilege and confidentiality protections for patient safety information, called patient safety work product. PSQIA authorizes HHS to impose civil money penalties for violations of patient safety confidentiality. PSQIA also authorizes the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to list patient safety organizations (PSOs). PSOs are the external experts that collect and review patient safety information.\n\nLearn more about PSQIA and read the statute.\n\nImplementing Regulations\n\nThe Patient Safety Rule implements select provisions of PSQIA.\n\nSubpart C of the Patient Safety Rule establishes the confidentiality provisions and disclosure permissions for patient safety work product and the enforcement procedures for violations of confidentiality pursuant to section 922 of the statute. OCR enforces these confidentiality protections.\n\nAHRQ lists patient safety organizations pursuant to section 924 of PSQIA and has responsibility for common formats and network of patient safety databases pursuant to section 923.\n\nLearn more about the Patient Safety Rule and read the regulations."
