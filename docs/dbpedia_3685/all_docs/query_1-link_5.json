        "text": "Jim Abdo\n\nPurchase price: $2.55 million\n\nEstimated current value: $5.78 million\n\nNeighborhood: Embassy Row\n\nYear purchased: 2002\n\nThe developer of 14th Street, Logan Circle, and H Street bought his three-story mansion—a fixer-upper—from the Ghanian ambassador. There’s a pool with a 52-foot lap lane out back.\n\nRobert Allbritton\n\nPurchase price: $23.96 million\n\nEstimated current value: $20.99 million\n\nNeighborhood: Georgetown\n\nYear purchased: 2007\n\nThat an activist was killed during a mugging in the driveway shortly after the Bowie-Sevier mansion was listed didn’t stop Politico’s founder from buying it days before he launched his company. Befitting the heir to a billion-dollar fortune, the 1810 estate has 15,000 square feet and 12 bedrooms.\n\nJosé Andrés\n\nPurchase price: $2.675 million\n\nEstimated current value: $1.85 million\n\nNeighborhood: Bethesda\n\nYear purchased: 2006\n\nNaturally, a master of modern cuisine would inhabit a modernist stucco masterpiece. Architect David Jameson built this home on a cul-de-sac in Burning Tree in 2005 and sold it to Andrés when the chef’s restaurant empire was less than half the size it is today.\n\nback to top\n\nAshok Bajaj\n\nPurchase price: $710,000\n\nEstimated current value: $1.63 million\n\nNeighborhood: Foxhall Crescent\n\nYear purchased: 1997\n\nIt’s appropriate that the owner of nine DC power restaurants—Rasika, Rasika West End, the Oval Room, Bibiana, the Bombay Club, 701, Nopa, Bindaas, and Ardeo & Bardeo—doesn’t retire in Maryland or Virginia at night. Bajaj’s three-bedroom, three-bath home is now worth nearly three times what he got it for almost 20 years ago.\n\nback to top\n\nMarty Baron\n\nPurchase price: $1.35 million\n\nEstimated current value: $1.70 million\n\nNeighborhood: Logan Circle\n\nYear purchased: 2012\n\nThe Post’s workaholic executive editor has to walk barely seven blocks from his 1,900-square-foot condo to the paper’s new Franklin Square headquarters. The townhouse’s other half is owned by journalist Matt Yglesias—for now. The Vox writer just bought a $1.5-million rowhouse three blocks away.\n\nback to top\n\nMarla Malcolm Beck\n\nPurchase price: $3.7 million\n\nEstimated current value: $4.12 million\n\nNeighborhood: Bethesda\n\nYear purchased: 2011\n\nAfter selling their Bluemercury cosmetics chain to Macy’s last year for $210 million, Beck and her husband, Barry, stayed put in this two-story in Edgemoor. Yes, the primary color decorating the eight-bathroom house is a vivid blue (except for the 12-seat theater in the basement).\n\nback to top\n\nWolf Blitzer\n\nPurchase price: $710,000\n\nEstimated current value: $1.34 million\n\nNeighborhood: Bethesda\n\nYear purchased: 1989\n\nBlitzer has lived in this house for his entire 26-year career at CNN. He bought the newly built two-story—one block from Congressional Country Club—during his last year as the Jerusalem Post’s Washington correspondent.\n\nback to top\n\nMuriel Bowser\n\nPurchase price: $832,000\n\nEstimated current value: $870,400\n\nNeighborhood: Colonial Village\n\nYear purchased: 2015\n\nDC’s mayor recently upsized from a $125,000 duplex in Riggs Park to this four-bedroom, three-bath, 2,120-square-footer with sun porch. Down the street are superlawyer Billy Martin and his wife, NPR journalist Michel Martin.\n\nback to top\n\nSharon Bulova\n\nPurchase price: $502,000\n\nEstimated current value: $708,400\n\nNeighborhood: Fairfax County\n\nYear purchased: 2002\n\nThe Fairfax County Board of Supervisors chairwoman found her home in the Cloisters of Fairfax after its developer asked as a courtesy if it could use her name for a new street there. Bulova’s five-bedroom sits next to a pond.\n\nback to top\n\nLonnie Bunch\n\nPurchase price: $815,000\n\nEstimated current value: $922,400\n\nNeighborhood: Shepherd Park\n\nYear purchased: 2006\n\nBunch, founding director of the just-opened National Museum of African-American History & Culture, lives in this Colonial—a few blocks from Mayor Bowser—with his wife, Maria Marable-Bunch, director of education at the National Archives.\n\nback to top\n\nEric Cantor\n\nPurchase price: $1.7 million\n\nEstimated current value: $1.77 million\n\nNeighborhood: Arlington\n\nYear purchased: 2015\n\nAfter his upset, the former House majority leader joined the investment bank Moelis & Company. The commute to the DC office Cantor opened for the bank is much shorter from this 5,600-square-foot house in Arlington’s Aurora Hills than from his old district around Richmond. Plus it has a wet bar.\n\nback to top\n\nHillary Clinton\n\nPurchase price: $2.85 million\n\nEstimated current value: $5.57 million\n\nNeighborhood: Massachusetts Avenue Heights/Embassy Row\n\nYear purchased: 2000\n\nBuilt in 1951, the 5,500-square-foot five-bedroom/eight-bath owned by the would-be commander in chief sits on a tree-lined property at the end of the street, a Secret Service detail’s dream. Wonder if Clinton ever uses the pool.\n\nback to top\n\nS.E. Cupp\n\nPurchase price: $790,000\n\nEstimated current value: $816,000\n\nNeighborhood: Old Town Alexandria\n\nYear purchased: 2014\n\nThe conservative pundit bought this four-story, 2,000-square-foot townhouse shortly after moving from MSNBC to CNN and marrying public-relations exec John Goodwin. They had a baby boy the same year.\n\nback to top\n\nMerrick Garland\n\nPurchase price: $990,000\n\nEstimated current value: $2.41 million\n\nNeighborhood: Bethesda\n\nYear purchased: 1999\n\nThe Supreme Court justice-in-waiting is known for hosting annual potluck breakfasts for his former clerks—as well as an Easter-egg hunt for their children—at his home in Edgemoor near Sidwell Friends Lower School.\n\nback to top\n\nRobin Givhan\n\nPurchase price: $800,000\n\nEstimated current value: $924,300\n\nNeighborhood: H Street, Northeast\n\nYear purchased: 2009\n\nThe Washington Post’s fashion critic lives in the H Street neighborhood’s most fashionable condo building, a convent turned museum turned loft complex. Former DC mayor Anthony Williams, a neighbor, bought his slightly bigger unit in the building the year before for $1.2 million.\n\nback to top\n\nJay Gruden\n\nPurchase price: $2.5 million\n\nEstimated current value: $2.16 million\n\nNeighborhood: Leesburg\n\nYear purchased: 2014\n\nShortly after becoming the Redskins’ coach, Gruden picked up this new-construction French Provincial on three acres in the Creighton Farms development, a gated community with a Jack Nicklaus golf course. The split-level four-bedroom has a wine cellar and occupies 5,300 square feet.\n\nback to top\n\nCarla Hall\n\nPurchase price: $244,000\n\nEstimated current value: $727,800\n\nNeighborhood: Takoma DC\n\nYear purchased: 1998\n\nA cohost of ABC’s The Chew, Washington’s favorite Southern chef turned TV star and cookbook author bought her out-of-the-way, 2½-story house long before her big break on Top Chef in 2008.\n\nback to top\n\nEric Holder\n\nPurchase price: $1.47 million\n\nEstimated current value: $1.46 million\n\nNeighborhood: Penn Quarter\n\nYear purchased: 2014\n\nFloor-to-ceiling windows and a CityCenterDC location that—for a workaholic lawyer—can’t be beat: Covington & Burling, where the former attorney general is a partner, is also in CityCenter. Holder’s high-wattage neighbors include US senator Claire McCaskill and NBC4 anchor Wendy Rieger.\n\nback to top\n\nGwen Ifill\n\nPurchase price: $1.2 million\n\nEstimated current value: $1.58 million\n\nNeighborhood: Chevy Chase\n\nYear purchased: 2005\n\nThis 1935 Tudor makes a peace-ful retreat from election-year craziness for Ifill, PBS NewsHour cohost and a past moderator of VP debates. The five-bedroom, six-bath home has a master suite with cathedral ceilings and French doors opening onto a balcony.\n\nback to top\n\nSheila Johnson\n\nPurchase price: $4.3 million\n\nAssessed value: $6.25 million\n\nNeighborhood: Fauquier County\n\nYear purchased: 1996\n\nSalamander Farm, Johnson’s estate near Middleburg, sprawls over 100 acres. Guests of the media/sports/hospitality magnate have plenty to swoon over: a formal dining room for 50, a billiards room, a home theater, riding stables, and a pond.\n\nback to top\n\nTed Leonsis\n\nPurchase price: $20 million\n\nEstimated current value: $13.19 million\n\nNeighborhood: Potomac\n\nYear purchased: 2011\n\nKnown as Marwood, this 20,000-square-foot chateau on the Potomac was once a summer rental for FDR. The Caps and Wizards owner has a tennis court, a pool, and a ten-car garage. He acquired the property through a de facto swap of his old McLean digs with telecom executive Chris Rogers.\n\nback to top.\n\nTed Lerner\n\nPurchase price: $10\n\nEstimated current value: $1.46 million\n\nNeighborhood: Chevy Chase\n\nYear purchased: 1963\n\nHow refreshing that the billionaire Nats owner—one of Washington’s top developers—still lives in the house he built five decades ago, after opening Wheaton Plaza mall.
