        "text": "The United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) is the only legally binding universal anti-corruption instrument. It was drafted and negotiated in Vienna, Austria in 2002-2003 and subsequently adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 31 October 2003.\n\nThe adoption of the Convention represents a historic milestone as it reflects a shared commitment by countries to fight corruption. What makes the Convention unique is its comprehensive approach to tackling corruption, emphasizing the importance of preventive measures, criminalization and law enforcement, international cooperation and asset recovery.\n\nThe Convention plays a pivotal role in uniting countries against corruption and fostering effective international cooperation. Today, this landmark anti-corruption instrument enjoys near universal adherence. At the national level, the Convention has been instrumental in fostering numerous impactful anti-corruption reforms, prompting important changes to legislative and institutional frameworks while strengthening international cooperation in cross-border cases and asset recovery. The Convention also serves as a crucial tool driving the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals forward, addressing the pervasive effects of corruption on all core values and principles of the United Nations.\n\nThe Convention's far-reaching approach and the mandatory character of many of its provisions make it a unique instrument for developing comprehensive responses to corruption at the national, regional and global levels."
