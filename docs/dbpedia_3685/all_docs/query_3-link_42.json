Bush threw out the ceremonial first pitch after receiving the ball from Joe Grzenda, the former Washington Senators reliever who threw the final pitch in Senators’ history. Livan Hernandez earned the win, allowing three earned runs on three hits in 8.1 innings of work. Vinny Castilla hit his first home run of the season, a two-run shot in the sixth inning."
