        "text": "Jamie Squire/Getty Images\n\nAs the Nationals prepare to begin their sixth season in Washington, management and ownership is doing all they can to get better. This team, after all, has been the worst in all of baseball over the last two seasons, losing 205 games and looking very bad while doing it.\n\nIt’s not as though they don’t try to get better. Clearly, the team continues to turn over their roster in an attempt to find 25 players capable of playing sound, fundamental baseball.\n\nWhen they arrived in 2005, the Nationals surprised the baseball world by winning 81 games and were in first place in the National League East as late as July 24, and didn’t fall out of second place until the middle of August.\n\nSince then, the team has been torn apart, ripped up and blown to pieces. The result? One of the worst two-year periods in the history of baseball.\n\nLet’s go back and take a look at that 81-81 2005 team and see how they compare—position by position—to 2009’s version:\n\nFirst Base:\n\n2005: Nick Johnson .289-15-74\n\n2009: Adam Dunn .268-38-105\n\nClearly, Adam Dunn is the far superior offensive player while Johnson was one of the best defensive first baseman in the league.\n\nHowever, with all due respect to Johnson’s glove, National League teams don’t win championships with defensive-minded first baseman. The last Senior-Circuit team to win the World Series with a non-slugging first baseman was the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks with Mark Grace (.298-15-78).\n\nNo question, the Nationals were much better at first in 2009\n\nSecond Base:\n\n2005: Jose Vidro .275-7-32\n\n2009: Alberto Gonzalez .265-1-33\n\nVidro’s multiple knee surgeries, and subsequent loss of range, coupled with questionable defense, makes this comparison much closer than you would think. Vidro had a .985 fielding percent compared to Gonazalez’ .995, and his range factor was 4.4, far worse than Gonzalez’ 5.13.\n\nI just don’t think those 10 extra points on his batting average and six more homers makes up for his slow-motion defense.\n\nI see this one as a draw\n\nShortstop\n\n2005: Cristian Guzman .219-4-31\n\n2009: Cristian Guzman .284-6-52\n\nIn 2005, Guzman suffered through one of the worst hitting slumps I have ever seen. His batting average didn’t stay above .200 for good until September 8, and he had to hit .338 for the remainder of the season to get the average “up” to .219. The 2010 Guzman didn’t see his average go below .300 until September 1.\n\nGuzman’s fielding percent dropped a bit in 2009, but all other factors remained constant.\n\nThe 2009 Guzman wins by a wide margin.\n\nThird Base\n\n2005: Vinny Castilla .253-12-66\n\n2009: Ryan Zimmerman .292-33-106\n\nCastilla hit just enough and fielded well enough to keep his job until Ryan Zimmerman began to play every day towards the end of September. The Vinny Castilla of old was now old, and it showed late in the season. Zimmerman, on the other hand, won both the Silver slugger and the Gold Glove in 2009.\n\nZimmerman over Castilla, and it’s not even close to being close.\n\nLeft Field\n\n2005: Ryan Church .287-9-42\n\nPreston Wilson .261-10-43\n\n2009: Josh Willingham .260-24-61\n\nChurch played regularly until he cracked his back and neck on the PNC Park fence in a dramatic win against the Pirates. Wilson, acquired in a mid-season trade with the Rockies, did was he was expected to do.\n\nChurch was capable but not great, and Wilson was terrible in the outfield, thanks in part to a very bad set of wheels. Josh Willingham’s numbers are skewed because he didn’t play every day until late May.\n\nWillingham doesn’t play outstanding defense but he’s certainly good enough. Willingham wins.\n\nCenter Field\n\n2005: Brad Wilkerson .248-11-57\n\n2009: Nyjer Morgan .351-1-12, 24 steals\n\nWilkerson was presumed to be the team’s slugger after hitting 32 homers the year before. But he struck out too much, didn’t hit nearly enough homers and played good defense. Morgan was the team’s catalyst, playing superb defense and raced around the bases, begging the opposition to stop him. They never did.\n\nNo contest: It’s Morgan\n\nRight Field\n\n2005: Jose Guillen .283-24-76\n\n2009: Elijah Dukes .250-8-58\n\nClearly, Guillen had the better year. Both players were outstanding defenders, and though Dukes is the more talented player, Guillen flat outplayed him.\n\nFunny how both of them were clubhouse problems.\n\nGuillen wins this one.\n\nCatcher:\n\n2005: Brian Schneider .268-10-44\n\n2009: Jesus Flores .301-4-15\n\nGranted, Flores didn’t play the entire season, but we’ve seen enough of him to make a fair comparison with Schneider. Flores has now played 198 games and has a career batting record of .260-16-99. Though he’s not quite as good a defender as Schneider was then, he will in the end be far better.\n\nFlores wins.\n\nStarting Pitchers\n\n2005: Livan Hernandez 15-10, 3,98\n\n2009: John Lannan 9-13, 3.88\n\nI’m taking Lannan in this comparison, which may make you scratch your head just a bit. But remember, Livan pitched at RFK Stadium, a park so large that it shaved three-quarters of a run off of a pitcher’s ERA. Lannan pitched at Nationals Park and had the better ERA.\n\nThis was a tough choice, but Lannan wins by a tad.\n\n2005: Esteban Loiaza 12-10, 3.77\n\n2009: Craig Stammen 4-7, 5.11\n\nNo contest here. Loiaza had a comeback that most players only dream of, and Stammen struggled in his first major league season.\n\nLoiaza takes it.\n\n2005: John Patterson 9-7, 3.13\n\n2009: Jordan Zimmermann 3-5, 4.63\n\n2005 was Patterson’s one great year before injuries eventually forced him out of baseball. Sadly, Zimmermann was just beginning to show what he could do at the major league level when he was lost to rotator cuff surgery.\n\nZimmermann is the better talent but Patterson had the better year. Patterson wins\n\n2005: Tony Armas 7-7, 4.97\n\n2009: J.D. Martin 5-4, 4.44\n\nArmas was one of those pitchers with a great deal of talent but nothing to show for it. Martin was one of former GM Jim Bowden’s reclamation projects that actually worked.\n\nMartin, selected in the first round of the draft by the Cleveland Indians as the compensation pick for the loss of Manny Ramirez, blew out his arm in the minors and was signed by Washington.\n\nHe got better as the year progressed and should be in the rotation in 2010.\n\nMartin over Armas.\n\n2005: Ryan Drese 3-6, 4.98\n\n2009: Ross Detwiler 1-6, 5.00\n\nDrese was claimed off of waivers from the Angels and had one good start before things went south. Detwiler was horrid early in the season but responded well to his demotion. He returned in September and pitched brilliantly, going 1-1 with a 1.90 ERA and a .220 batting-average against.\n\nDetwiler beats Drese because of that great September.\n\nCloser:\n\n2005: Chad Cordero 2-4, 1.82, 47 saves\n\n2009: Mike MacDougal 1-1, 3.60, 20 saves\n\n“The Chief” wins walking away. Though he always “almost” blew every save, he never did. He was the one sure thing on that 2005 team. MacDougal was certainly good enough, but will serve the Nationals better as the setup man when Drew Storen takes his place sometime next year.\n\nIn the final tally, the 2009 team won eight positions while the 2005 team won just five. There was one draw. That seems strange, I know, because that 2005 team was 22 games better.\n\nFrom an individual point of view, the 2009 Nationals are more talented, but as a team, when you take into account the depth of both teams, the 2005 Nationals were far better.\n\nChad Cordero: 1.82\n\nHector Carrasco: 2.04\n\nLuis Ayala: 2.66\n\nJason Bergman: 2.75\n\nGary Majewski: 2.93\n\nJoey Eischen: 3.22\n\nMike Stanton: 3.58\n\nJon Rauch: 3.60\n\nTeam General Manager Mike Rizzo will be heading into next week’s Winter Meetings trying to find some more “big names” to bring to Washington. And that’s fine; he should be doing that.\n\nBut he should also be trying to duplicate Jim Bowden’s magic and find a bunch of hard working, small-paycheck kind-of-guys who can almost will the team to win, doing whatever it takes, and whenever it’s needed, to make it happen."
