        "text": "Washington Nationals\n\nSearching for affordable family fun? Look no further than a day at the ballpark. The Nationals make sure everyone can enjoy the excitement of baseball without breaking the bank.\n\nKids eat free at every game, so you can focus on cheering without worrying about your budget. Fans of this deal include radio host Grant Paulsen, who shared: \"There is no better deal in DC sports. When you take your kid to Nats Park, they get a free hot dog, chips and bottled water. Not an ad. Just a parent telling you this is an awesome thing.\"\n\nBefore the game, gather around for Story Time as one of the players reads a select book to young fans and their families. For the active youngsters, the Kids Zone and playground provide great entertainment with fun activities to keep them smiling all day long.\n\nOn Sundays, after the final inning, don't miss a beloved tradition: kids run the bases. Children between the ages of four and twelve can run the bases for free. Experience the joy of baseball together with your family by getting tickets today.\n\nFor the first time in a decade, the Nats are bringing back their postgame Summer Concert Series with some fantastic artists on the docket. Flo Rida set the bar high with an amazing concert back in June, but if you missed him, have no fear. The rest of the roster includes Carly Rae Jepsen (July 19), Teddy Swims (Aug. 9) and Lady A (Sept. 27). With the purchase of a ticket, fans will be able to enjoy the full concert after the game. On-field passes will be available as an upgrade a few weeks before each concert, so get your tickets now so you can stay in the loop."
