They have a new stadium hosting \"new\" franchise, with lots of young players such as Ryan Zimmerman and Stephen Strasburg.\n\nTeam History[]\n\nO Canada[]\n\nIn 1968, Major League Baseball announced that it would enter Canada starting in the 1969 season. With the league already expanding into other cities, a voyage north seemed both reasonable and timely. Charles Bronfman, who made his money owning Seagrams, owned the team—the Montreal Expos. The team was named after \"Expositions 1967\", a huge event in Montreal which celebrated Canada's 100th birthday.\n\nThe Expos got off to a fast start, beating the eventual world champion New York Mets 11-10 in their first ever game, a road contest at Shea Stadium. They also won their home opener, at Parc Jarry, against the St. Louis Cardinals, behind the strength of a Mack Jones three-run blast. Before April was out, the Expos were again making headlines, as pitcher Bill Stoeman no-hit the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nUnfortunately, the Expos only won 49 other games in their inaugural year, ending up with a last place, 52-110 record. And that losing feeling would continue on through 1978.\n\nAlong the way, the Expos had some positive luck. In 1970, Carl Morton won 18 games and the NL Rookie of the Year. With the 1976 Summer Olympics over, the team inherited Stade Olympique, a/k/a/ \"The Big O\", the centerpiece of Montreal's Games, in 1977. That same year, outfielder Andre Dawson won the team's second Cy Young in the decade.\n\nIn 1979, things started looking up. With stars like Dawson and Gary Carter on the squad, the Expos were primed to compete. With a week left to play, the Expos were still in striking distance of the eventual World Champion Pittsburgh Pirates, and, in fact, finished the season one game shy in the loss column. And in 1980, the team went 90-72, but again just missed winning the division.\n\nIn 1981, however, the players strike hit—to the Expos benefit. When the strike went into effect, the Expos were 30-25, four games out of first. When the game returned, it did so with an edict that the second half be considered its own season. The Expos went 30-23 in the second half, beating the St. Louis Cardinals by half a game. The team beat the first-half champion Philadelphia Phillies in five games, and earned the right to face the Los Angeles Dodgers. After four hard-fought games, the Expos season came to a crashing end as Rick Monday homered off Steve Rogers.\n\nRetired Numbers[]\n\n42 Jackie Robinson - Retired by Baseball\n\nNote: The Washington Nationals, formerly known as the Montreal Expos, have yet to retire any numbers. The Expos had numbers in which they retired, but when the franchise was relocated, the numbers became available for use for active players. The Expos retired three numbers for four players:\n\n8 Gary Carter\n\n10 Andre Dawson\n\n10 Rusty Staub\n\n30 Tim Raines\n\nThe Expos also retired the number 81 for former team owner, Charles Bronfman.\n\nFranchise Owners[]\n\nCharles Bronfman 1969-1991\n\nClaude Brochu 1991-1998\n\nJeffrey Loria 1998-2002\n\nExpos Baseball, LP a subsidiary of Major League Baseball 2002-2006\n\nTed Lerner 2006-\n\nFranchise General Managers[]\n\nJim Fanning 1969-76\n\nCharlie Fox 1976-78\n\nJohn McHale 1978-84\n\nMurray Cook 1984-87\n\nBill Stoneman 1987-88\n\nDave Dombrowski 1988-91\n\nDan Duquette 1991-94\n\nKevin Malone 1994-95\n\nJim Beattie 1995-2001\n\nLarry Beinfest 2001\n\nOmar Minaya 2001-04\n\nJim Bowden 2005-\n\nFranchise Managers[]\n\nGene Mauch 1969-75\n\nKarl Kuehl 1976\n\nCharlie Fox 1976\n\nDick Williams 1977-81\n\nJim Fanning 1981-82, 1984\n\nBill Virdon 1983-84\n\nBuck Rodgers 1985-91\n\nTom Runnells 1991-92\n\nFelipe Alou 1992-2001\n\nJeff Torborg 2001\n\nFrank Robinson 2002-2006\n\nManny Acta 2007-2009\n\nJim Riggleman 2009-\n\nAwards[]\n\nCy Young[]\n\nPedro Martinez 1997\n\nRookie of the Year[]\n\nCarl Morton 1970\n\nAndre Dawson 1977\n\nRecord Per Season[]\n\nWashington Nationals Year Record Winning % 2005 81-81 .500 2006 71-91 .438 2007 73-89 .451 2008 59-102 .366 2009 58-103 .360 2010\n\n*Previously known as Montreal Expos\n\nTeam Records[]\n\nCareer Records[]\n\nHome Runs: Vladimir Guerrero 234\n\nRuns Batted In: Tim Wallach 838\n\nBatting Average (minimum 1,000 plate appearances): Vladimir Guerrero .323\n\nBatting Average (minimum 2,000 plate appearances): Vladimir Guerrero .323\n\nBatting Average (minimum 3,000 plate appearances): Vladimir Guerrero .323\n\nBatting Average (minimum 4,000 plate appearances): Vladimir Guerrero .323\n\nHits: Tim Wallach 1694\n\nRuns: Tim Raines 947\n\nDoubles: Tim Wallach 360\n\nTriples: Tim Raines 82\n\nStolen Bases: Tim Raines 635\n\nWalks: Tim Raines 793\n\nWins: Steve Rogers 158\n\nSaves: Jeff Reardon 152\n\nStrikeouts: Steve Rogers 1621\n\nEarned Run Average: Tim Burke 2.61\n\nSingle Season Records[]\n\nHome Runs: Vladimir Guerrero 44, 2000\n\nRuns Batted In: Vladimir Guerrero 131, 1999\n\nBatting Average: Vladimir Guerrero .345, 2000\n\nHits: Vladimir Guerrero 206, 2002\n\nRuns: Tim Raines 133, 1983\n\nDoubles: Mark Grudzielanek 54, 1997\n\nTriples: Tim Raines 13, 1985\n\nStolen Bases: Ron LeFlore 97, 1980\n\nHitting Streak:\n\nWalks: Ken Singleton 123, 1973\n\nWins: Ross Grimsley 20, 1978\n\nSaves: Chad Cordero 47, 2005\n\nStrikeouts: Pedro Martinez 305, 1997\n\nEarned Run Average: Pedro Martinez 1.90, 1997\n\nThey are the best Bold text\n\nMinor League Teams[]\n\nAAA: Syracuse Chiefs - International League\n\nAA: Harrisburg Senators - Eastern League\n\nAdvanced A: Potomac Nationals - Carolina League\n\nA: Hagerstown Suns - South Atlantic League\n\nShort A: Vermont Lake Monsters - New York-Penn League\n\nRookie: Gulf Coast Nationals - Gulf Coast League\n\nRookie: DSL Nationals - Dominican Summer League"
