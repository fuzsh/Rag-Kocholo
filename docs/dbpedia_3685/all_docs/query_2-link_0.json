        "text": "Chairman Mark Green’s commitment to defending the homeland began long before his swearing-in to Congress, as he served our nation as a decorated U.S. Army combat veteran. Under Chairman Green’s leadership, the committee will proactively and aggressively combat authoritarian nation states that seek to strategically undermine our way of life, rightfully recognize cybersecurity as the pre-eminent national security threat of our time, and protect the sovereignty and integrity of our territorial borders.\n\nThe Committee on Homeland Security will stand strong against all forms of terrorism – both abroad and here at home. Breakdowns in the sharing of intelligence will not be tolerated. This work will require a thoughtful, not knee-jerk, debate to addressing domestic misinformation to prevent radicalization while still respecting civil liberties."
