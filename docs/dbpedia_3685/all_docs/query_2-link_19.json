With approximately one out of every ten dollars of Federal government spending going to contractors, it is imperative that contract actions result in the best value for the taxpayer.\n\nThe Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) in the Office of Management and Budget plays a central role in shaping the policies and practices federal agencies use to acquire the goods and services they need to carry out their responsibilities. OFPP was established by Congress in 1974 to provide overall direction for government-wide procurement policies, regulations and procedures and to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in acquisition processes. OFPP is headed by an Administrator who is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nPolicy Information\n\nCirculars\n\nGuides\n\nMemoranda\n\nPolicy

designed to achieve uniformity and consistency in the cost accounting practices governing the measurement, assignment, and allocation of costs to contracts with the United States Government. The CAS Board is an independent statutorily-established Board (41 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) consisting of five members: the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, who serves as the chairman, and four members with experience in Government contract cost accounting, two from the Federal government (DOD and GSA), one from industry, and one from the accounting profession.\n\nThe Board’s regulations are codified at 48 CFR, Chapter 99. The standards are mandatory for use by all executive agencies and by contractors and subcontractors in estimating, accumulating, and reporting costs in connection with pricing and administration of, and settlement of disputes concerning, all covered negotiated prime contract and subcontract procurements with the United States Government. Covered contracts and subcontracts are those in excess of $750,000, provided that, at the time of award, the contractor or subcontractor is performing any CAS-covered contracts or subcontracts valued at $7.5 million or greater. As a result of changes made by section 811 the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2018, the $750,000 threshold will be raised to $2 million for contracts awarded after June 30, 2018.\n\nCAS Board Members\n\nCAS Board Meetings\n\nFebruary 13, 2018 Meeting Agenda and Minutes\n\nMarch 14, 2018 Meeting Agenda and Minutes\n\nApril 12, 2018 Meeting Agenda and Minutes\n\nMay 18, 2018 Meeting Agenda and Minutes\n\nCAS Disclosure Forms\n\nCost Accounting Standards Board Disclosure Statement-1 (42 pages, 2 MB)\n\nCost Accounting Standards Board Disclosure Statement-2 for Educational Institutions (24 pages, 1 MB)\n\nRulemaking: Federal Register Notices & Supplementary Materials\n\nConformance of the Cost Accounting Standards to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for Compensated Personal Absence and Depreciation of Tangible Capital Assets (CASB 2021-02)\n\nAdvanced Notice of Proposed Rule Making\n\nConformance of the Cost Accounting Standards to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for Operating Revenue and Lease Accounting (CASB 2020-02)\n\n85 FR 70572 Notice re: Availability of Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: Conformance of the Cost Accounting Standards to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for Operating Revenue and Lease Accounting\n\nAdvanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: Conformance of the Cost Accounting Standards to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for Operating Revenue and Lease Accounting\n\nNotice of Proposed Rule Making\n\nConformance of the Cost Accounting Standards to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for Capitalization of Tangible Assets and Accounting for Acquisition Costs of Material (CASB 2020-01)\n\n85 FR 58399 Notice re Availability of Staff Discussion Paper: Conformance of the Cost Accounting Standards to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for Capitalization of Tangible Assets and Accounting for Acquisition Costs of Material\n\nStaff Discussion Paper (SDP): Conformance of CAS to GAAP for Capitalization of Tangible Assets and Accounting for Acquisition Costs of Material\n\nAdjustment and Allocation of Pension Costs for Segment Closings, Curtailments, and Terminations (CASB 2019-02)\n\n78 FR 40665, Public Meetings for Fact-Finding (July 8, 2013)\n\nFact-Finding Public Comments\n\nConformance of the Cost Accounting Standards to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (CASB 2019-01)\n\n85 FR 15817 CAS-GAAP Guiding Principles (March 19, 2020)\n\nSupplement to FRN CAS-GAAP Guiding Principles\n\n84 FR 9143 Notice re Availability of Staff Discussion Paper: Conformance of CAS to GAAP (March 13, 2019)\n\nStaff Discussion Paper (SDP): Conformance of CAS to GAAP (CASB 2019-01)\n\nPublic Comments on SDP: Conformance of CAS to GAAP\n\n-00c commenter list 190513\n\n-01 bowee, ben indiv 190417 0810\n\n-02 asset ldrship ntwk 190512 2232 CASB Comments CAS 408 and 409 ALN RCC 20190512\n\n-03 FEI 190513 0924 FEI CGB Responce to CAS-GAP SDP 051019 final\n\n-04 aia 190513 1123 AIA Comments on CAS -GAAP Final 5-13-19\n\n-05 ndia 190531 1341 CAS Board 2019-01 Detailed Comment\n\n-06 J&J 190605 1406 JJ Comment Letter RE CASB 2019 01\n\n-07 aba 190607 1901 ABA PCLS Comments re CASB Conformance CAS and GAAP\n\nExemption from Cost Accounting Standards for Contracts and Subcontracts for the Acquisition of Commercial Items (i.e., (b)(6) exemption)\n\n83 FR 33146, Final Rule (July 17, 2018)\n\nExemption from Cost Accounting Standards for Firm Fixed-Price Contracts and Subcontracts Awarded Without Submission of Certified Cost or Pricing Data (i.e., (b)(15) exemption)\n\n83 FR 8634, Final Rule (February 28, 2018)\n\nApplication of Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) to indefinite delivery vehicles (IDVs)(CASB 2021-01)\n\nCASB 2021-01 IDVS Notice (June 18, 2024)\n\nTop of Page\n\nContractor Employee Compensation Cap\n\nContractor Employee Compensation Cap Overview\n\nContractor Compensation Cap for Contracts Awarded Before June 24, 2014\n\nContractor Employee Compensation Cap for Contracts Awarded on or after June 24, 2014\n\nTop of Page\n\nFederal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act\n\nThe FAIR Act (31 U.S.C. 501 note) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 require executive agencies, with certain exceptions, to prepare inventories of the commercial and inherently governmental activities performed by their federal employees.
