        "text": "An independent, not-for-profit organization, The Joint Commission is the nation's oldest and largest standards-setting and accrediting body in health care. To earn and maintain The Gold Seal of ApprovalÂ® from The Joint Commission, an organization undergoes an on-site survey by a Joint Commission survey team at least every three years (Laboratories are surveyed every two years).\n\nThe Joint Commission is governed by a 21-member Board of Commissioners that includes physicians, administrators, nurses, employers, quality experts, a consumer advocate and educators. The Joint Commission employs approximately 1,000 people in its surveyor force, at its central office in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois, and at an office in Washington, D.C."
