        "text": "On March 1, 2003, U.S. Customs and Border Protection was established as the nation’s first comprehensive border, travel and trade agency. The agency’s formation was a direct result of the recommendations of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, known as the 9/11 Commission, and was established within the newly formed Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe agency integrated four legacy agencies. The Customs Service, which was transferred from the Treasury Department, originates from the Fifth Act of the First Congress on July 31, 1789. Immigration inspection, from the Immigration and Nationalization Service, traces its roles to the establishment of the Office of the Superintendent of Immigration on March 3, 1891. INS also housed our enforcement functions, including Border Patrol, which was first authorized by Congress on May 28, 1924. The plant protection and quarantine inspection programs, from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in the Department of Agriculture, traces its agriculture inspection roles to the passage of the Plant Quarantine Act on Aug. 20, 1912.\n\nThe agency’s mission is to protect the American people, safeguard our borders, and enhance the nation’s economic prosperity. With more than 60,000 employees, CBP is one of the world’s largest law enforcement organizations and is charged with keeping terrorists and their weapons out of the U.S. while facilitating lawful international travel and trade.\n\nAs the nation’s first unified border entity, the agency takes a comprehensive approach to border management and control, combining customs, immigration, border security, and agricultural protection into one coordinated and supportive activity.\n\nContainer Security Initiative Launched to Protect Global Trade, Enhance Border Security\n\nCBP launched the Container Security Initiative (CSI), one of the most critical parts of the agency’s layered cargo security strategy, in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States.\n\nRead the Container Security Initiative Story\n\nAir and Marine Operations’ Unmanned Aircraft System\n\nIn 2005, CBP began using the MQ-9 Predator B Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) – marking a leap forward in the use of unmanned systems for CBP.\n\nRead the Unmanned Aircraft System Story\n\nCelebrating U.S. Customs 234th Anniversary\n\nJuly 31, 2023, marks the 234th anniversary of the birth of the U.S. Customs Service and the important role it played in the history of the United States.\n\nRead the 234th Anniversary Story\n\nThe Unveiling of U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Valor Memorial\n\nIn March 2004, CBP’s Valor Memorial was unveiled at its headquarters in Washington’s Ronald Reagan Building. The Memorial is a tangible sign of CBP’s continued commitment to honor the agents, officers and employees who lost their lives in the line of duty.\n\nRead the Valor Memorial Story\n\nBorder Patrol Academy Unified in Artesia\n\nWhen class session 583 reported to the Border Patrol Basic Academy in Artesia, New Mexico on October 20, 2004, it marked the beginning of a new era in U.S. Border Patrol training history.\n\nRead the Border Patrol Academy Story\n\nTrade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act Brings Sweeping Change\n\nThe Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (TFTEA) was the first law since the Department of Homeland Security's inception in 2003 to grant U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) comprehensive authority to ensure a fair and competitive trade environment.\n\nRead the TFTEA Story"
