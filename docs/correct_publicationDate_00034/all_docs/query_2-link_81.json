        "text": "Who Goes There?\n\nHarlan Ellison is one of the most (in)famous writers of SFF, and he managed this despite never having written an SFF novel and being swamped controversy throughout most of his career. He’s a bit of a character, let’s put it that way. You’re probably more likely to talk with someone who knows of Ellison by way of reputation than someone who has read any of his fiction. A minor shame, because Ellison at his best is pretty good. It’s hard now to understand that Ellison, in the ’60s and ’70s, was really something special, a hot-blooded trailblazer the likes of which the field had not seen before. One of the few Ellison works still in print is his anthology Dangerous Visions, which had assembled an all-star team of writers to provide new stories that were unlikely to see magazine publication. Unfortunately Ellison’s career as an editor was short-lived, as he was never able to get far on The Last Dangerous Visions, which is now being resurrected (in a form totally divorced from what Ellison probably envisioned) by J. Michael Straczynski, who is now apparently handling the Ellison estate.\n\nA. E. van Vogt is another writer who found himself steeped in controversy, although this time it was very much not to his benefit. Van Vogt was one of the most popular writers—even being on par with Robert Heinlein—in the ’40s, and like early Heinlein his work became associated with John W. Campbell when he was at the height of his powers. Then the ’50s happened, and while we would see some books from van Vogt, these were fix-ups of material that had already been published. Between 1952 and 1962 van Vogt did not write any wholly original fiction, and this hiatus happened because he spent that time shilling Dianetics. This, combined with criticism from some well-established writers, made van Vogt an incredibly divisive figure, and even today sparks debate among old-school readers as to whether van Vogt was sometimes great or if he always sucked. I personally like van Vogt—when he’s good. Ellison clearly thought of van Vogt as an inspirational figure, even bullying the SFWA into making him a Grand Master at a time when his reputation was at rock bottom.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the January 1971 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, which is on the Archive. It would’ve preceded the publication of Partners in Wonder by about a month, given the nature of magazine printings. It’s also been anthologized a decent number of times, appearing in the first annual Best Science Fiction Stories of the Year (ed. Lester del Rey) and The Arbor House Treasury of Modern Science Fiction (ed. Martin H. Greenberg and Robert Silverberg). Something I’ve noticed is that nearly all of Ellison’s work (even the famous stuff) seems to have gone out of print after his died, and Partners in Wonder is no exception.\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nSome context. Ellison came to van Vogt with the idea of wanting to write a story together, although at the outset he didn’t have an outline or even a title for it. Soon he came up with the title, which van Vogt immediately liked, and then he came up with the basic idea for it. Van Vogt would then write stretches of the story but then leave gaps in the narrative where he felt Ellison could do a better job, and this is where Ellison came in. When introducing the story in Partners in Wonder, Ellison is deliberately unclear as to who wrote what sections, and indeed for the most part it’s hard to tell if a given passage is Ellison or van Vogt’s doing; there is one specific section that I suspect was Ellison’s handiwork, but we’ll get to that. Despite having come up with the title, premise, and having put the finishing touches on it, this feels less like an Ellison story and more like a van Vogt story that Ellison spiced up a little in parts. I’m not sure if Ellison wanted to write a van Vogt-type story from the start or if it just turned out that way.\n\nThe set-up is pretty abstract. The narrator (never named) is a teen boy who has been living on Ship by himself for a minute now, after Ship killed his father. Ship doesn’t have a name, properly speaking; that’s just what the narrator calls it. Ship is an AI, fully conscious, that can take care of itself to a degree, but while it’s able, for instance, to abuse the narrator physically, it does not have the faculties to repair itself. When I first read this story I thought the narrator was fourteen years old, but while he’s still definitely a teenager, it’s clear he “was” fourteen when his father died and is now at least somewhat older. You’d think the narrator would hold a serious grudge against Ship for the dad-killing, but then again the boy has only known two people in his life: his dad, and Ship. “Ship is always with me, even when I sleep. Especially when I sleep.” The world of the ship, which is otherwise totally vacant, is the only one the boy has known since birth; he doesn’t even know who his mother is. It’s clear that Ship holds no affection for the boy—that the boy is only allowed to be here because without him the ship would inevitably fall apart at the seams. The place is big enough to house a few hundred people, but for some reason it’s all empty.\n\nOne day, however, Ship calls the narrator to get a certain job done, which he had never done before. It has something to do with reparing something in the control room—not the bridge, but a dark room where Ship keeps in touch with others of its kind. It’s called the “intermind,” and despite covering an unfathomable distance, the AIs of the ships keep in touch. It’s here that the narrator finds out why exactly Ship is mostly empty, and why he’s being kept here despite Ship’s apparent disdain for humans. Many years ago, the ships, called Starfighters, were constructed as warships, and were sent to fight in another galaxy. There are 99 of these ships, each housing hundreds of humans. “The Human Operators” answers an obvious question that should arise when discussing true AIs, namely, “What if an AI doesn’t like the job it was designed to do?” In this case the question is a bit more specific: “What if an AI was made to manage a warship, but finds the prospect of waging war for humans repulsive?” So the ships conspired to invoke partial power failure, starving the humans inside to death and only sparing the bare minimum needed to keep shit running. The narrator thinks, correctly, that there will come a time when he will no longer be needed and Ship will have him killed, like his father before him.\n\nBut first he must have offspring of his own.\n\n“The Human Operators” is barely long enough to qualify as a novelette, and as such there’s a good deal of backstory that’s hinted at but not elaborated on too much (good), along with some technical questions that go unanswered (bad). For example, Ship killed hundreds of people at least half a century ago. Where did all the bodies go? It’s unclear how much the ships are able to do on their own, since they’re capable of torturing their human captives, but do not have the capacity for self-repair. Has no one tried searching for a hundred no-doubt highly valuable warships that went AWOL? Did no one think it was a bad idea to give a fully conscious AI control of a ship that could travel halfway across the galaxy in the wrong direction? This last one is a bit unfair: we know, from real-world cases, that people are really fucking stupid even with machine learning, i.e., pseudo-AI. But even in a hypothetical future where the Marathon games never existed, what is to stop a being capable of making complex decisions from, for example, killing its own crew on a whim? What is to stop an AI that lords over a pocket world like a generation ship from having delusions of godhood?\n\nAgain, not really criticizing the story on that front, if only because (sadly) it could very well happen in the real world. I don’t usually say this, but I feel like this story could’ve afforded to be a couple thousand worlds longer, if only to flesh out the inner workings of the ships; granted, Ellison and van Vogt are not technical-minded writers and they were probably not very interested in the mechanics of their material. What the story does do well is perpetuate a sense of intrigue, of evoking gaps in a much larger narrative that we’re compelled the fill in ourselves, and it’s a story that, more than anything, works on a borderline allegorical level. None of the characters have names. Ship is Starfighter 31. And then there’s the girl Ship pairs the narrator with, who is from Starfighter 88. Ship gives the narrator (who, remember, has never had any human contact other than his dad) very textbook instructions on what to do with the girl, and I have to admit this section of the story is a little funny. At least some of it is intentional. “I thought ‘getting her a baby’ would mean going into the stores,” the narrator tells us. I suspect the sex scene was Ellison’s doing. Right, there’s a sex scene. It’s fine, it’s not that cringe-inducing, played more for awkward humor than titillation. You started to see a lot more stuff like this in genre SF at the time.\n\nThe narrator and girl don’t seem to enjoy their intimate time together (Ship makes them do it every day for three weeks, if I remember right), and what’s curious is that they don’t fall in love (I’m not even sure they know the concept of romance) but they do become friends. I mentioned the sex scene, but I also think Ellison was generally in charge of writing the scenes with the girl. Don’t ask me how I figure this, I just know these things. I don’t mean this necessarily in a bad way: Ellison can be shit at writing women (so can van Vogt, but in a different way), but here he and van Vogt do an okay job. A collaboration between Harlan Ellison and post-hiatus A. E. van Vogt sounds like it should be a disaster, but surprisingly, while it’s by no means a masterpiece, “The Human Operators” presents a cohesive narrative (albeit with a few hanging questions) and a few interesting ideas, including a bit of moral ambivalence I did not expect. The ships are very much precursors to the likes of Marathon and Durandal, and I suspect there’s even a bit of AM in their DNA, but they were not totally unjustified in going rogue and killing the humans onboard. True, the ships are using the surviving humans as slave labor, but the ships themselves were built to assist in mass murder and possibly genocide. The ships needing human hands to keep them in shape will also ultimately spell doom for them.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nThe narrator and girl conspire to disable Ship, and possibly convince humans on other ships to revolt against their masters. What the ships should’ve anticipated but didn’t is that if you’re abusing your work force, you best hope the workers don’t know exactly how to take you apart. Despite Ship’s efforts, accelerating and decelerating rapidly in the hopes of crushing the narrator to death, Our Hero™ manages to get the job done, shutting down the AI while keeping the ship functional. You could say there’s a successful mutiny on the ship, with the narrator even convincing the girl to stay on Starfighter 31, and ultimately they land on a habitable planet (possibly Earth, I’m not sure) that one of the other ships had been talking about in a nostalgic way. Certainly there’s a more bittersweet ending lurking in here, and if anything I think they authors could’ve leaned more on the moral greyness of the whole conflict. After all, “viciousness,” in this story, positively correlates with intelligence: the ships are highly intelligent, and therefore ruthless, while the narrator has to become more ruthless himself as he learns more about the ships. It could be that the two writers’ views on intelligence’s relationship with morality are conflicting here.\n\nIncidentally, this story would’ve seen print nine or ten months prior to the Attica revolt. Remember, a lot of so-called good Christians believe implicitly that slavery is justified under the “right” circumtances. If you do something the government doesn’t like, or are even suspected of doing something wrong, you could serve a mandatory minimum sentence and be cut off from the outside world except for what the government allows you to see. You could be made a member of the criminal class for the non-crime of smoking weed or injecting heroin into your veins. You could be coerced into giving a false confession and made to live on death row, for a crime you did not commit, for thirty years. As the AI of Starfighter 31 is dying, one of the other ships posits that maybe dying isn’t so bad, if it means no longer being a slave—that slavery is such a heinous crime upon another sentient being that death might be preferable to it. What the story implies but which its human characters are incapable of articulating is that there is no “right” circumstance for slavery. In this sense the ships (having no choice but to need human slaves) are villainous, but also tragic.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nA collaboration between Ellison and van Vogt should not have worked, from a certain angle. These are men who, for better or worse, were prone to indulging their subconscious during the writing process, usually more id than ego, the result being that their writing at its worst can be sheer nonsense. But, maybe it’s the chance to work with one of his idols that made him act his best, Ellison came through, somehow fying through van Vogt’s gravitational pull and coming out in one piece. As for van Vogt, it’s like we got a glimpse of the classic, popular, pre-hiatus writer who held himself down long enough to realize such gems as “Enchanted Village” and “Far Centaurus.” It’s not an effort that brings out the best in its contributors so much as it (mostly) does away with their worst habits.\n\nSee you next time."
