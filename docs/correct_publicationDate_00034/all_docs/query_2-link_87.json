        "text": "There are few science fiction writers with a more illustrious career than Harlan Ellison. From short stories and novellas to teleplays and film scripts, Ellison mastered nearly every form and genre. The decorated fantasist, who passed away nearly a year ago on June 27th, 2018, was the winner of eight and a half Hugos (one was shared), three Nebulas, five Bram Stokers, and two Edgars.\n\nEven outside of his writing, Ellison’s resume is impressive. After running away from his Ohio hometown, he flitted from one odd job to another, working as a tuna fisherman, then a crop-picker, then a hired gun. He is also, in his own words, the “most contentious person on Earth”—a self-proclaimed title that his college professor, whom he once punched for insulting his writing, would likely agree with.\n\nRELATED: 8 Brutally Honest Harlan Ellison Quotes\n\nIn the 1960s, Ellison found success as a writer for shows like Star Trek and The Man From U.N.C.L.E. The latter half of the decade and the early 70s saw him publishing acclaimed short stories such as “I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream” (one of Vulture’s \"100 Great Works of Dystopian Fiction\") and “A Boy and His Dog.” It wasn’t long before he became known as one of the greatest voices in science fiction.\n\nBelow are some of the short stories, novellas, and teleplays that have captivated readers for over 50 years. Whether you’re new to the Grand Master’s work or are a proud Ellison veteran, these thought-provoking collections are essential reading for more than just SF/F fans—but for anyone who appreciates a good story."
