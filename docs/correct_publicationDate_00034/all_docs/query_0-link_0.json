        "text": "Science fiction short story anthology edited by Harlan Ellison\n\nAgain, Dangerous Visions (1972) is a science fiction short story anthology, edited by American author Harlan Ellison. It is the follow-up to Dangerous Visions (1967), also edited by Ellison.

A sequel was planned, The Last Dangerous Visions, but was never published in Elison's lifetime. It is now announced for release in 2024.\n\nThe first printing was a hardback edition of 6,500 copies.[4]\n\nThree writers are each represented by two or three stories with a group title.
