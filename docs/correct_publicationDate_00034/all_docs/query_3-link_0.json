Again, Dangerous Visions—the middle installment in a planned three anthology series—includes award-winning stories from incomparable writers such as Ursula K. Le Guin, Gene Wolfe, Ray Bradbury, Kurt Vonnegut, Piers Anthony, Dean Koontz, and James Tiptree, among many others.\n\nUnprecedented and electrifying, Again, Dangerous Visions cemented Harlan Ellison’s legacy as the ultimate sci-fi anthologist."
