        "text": "It is the great white whale of science fiction: an anthology of stories by some of the genre’s greatest names, collected in the early 1970s by Harlan Ellison yet mysteriously never published. But almost 50 years after it was first announced, The Last Dangerous Visions is finally set to see the light of day.\n\nThe late Ellison changed the face of sci-fi with the publication of anthologies Dangerous Visions and Again, Dangerous Visions, in 1968 and 1972, which featured writing by the likes of Philip K Dick, JG Ballard, Kurt Vonnegut and Ursula K Le Guin. Ellison, who was known for his combative nature – JG Ballard called him “an aggressive and restless extrovert who conducts life at a shout and his fiction at a scream” – announced a third volume, The Last Dangerous Visions, would be published in 1974. Contributors were said to include major names such as Frank Herbert, Anne McCaffrey, Octavia Butler and Daniel Keyes.\n\nBut the work never appeared, and in the words of the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, it “became legendary for its many postponements”. The encyclopedia notes that “a series of illnesses certainly impaired Ellison’s fitness for the huge task of annotating what had soon become an enormous project”; in their study of Ellison, The Edge of Forever, Ellen Weil and Gary K Wolfe say the anthology ran to over a million words.\n\nThe encyclopedia also points to “the moral dilemmas [Ellison] incurred by retaining purchased but unpublished stories – eventually in some cases … for close on 50 years” – a delay that so riled author Christopher Priest that he wrote and self-published a lengthy, scathing analysis titled The Last Deadloss Visions.\n\nNow, television screenwriter J Michael Straczynski, who was appointed executor of Ellison’s estate after his death and that of his wife Susan earlier this year, has launched a Patreon account, where fans can pay to take part in the book’s publication process.\n\nStraczynski is planning to include dozens of the stories originally commissioned by Ellison, as well as work by “some of the most well-known and respected writers working today”, who are yet to be revealed. It will also feature “one last, significant work by Harlan that has never been published, that has been seen by only a handful of people”, and will reveal why the book was delayed for so long, “a story known only to a very few people”.\n\n“Rather than seeking a publisher first, and potentially compromise a book designed to be challenging and daring, or asking writers to wait until the book is sold to be paid, I will cover the cost of paying for all of the stories up front,” he wrote.\n\nStraczynski plans to sell the book to a publisher next year, saying that several “major” presses have already expressed “significant” interest, “given the unique place in science fiction history occupied by Dangerous Visions in general, and this book in particular”. All royalties are set to go to the creation of the Harlan and Susan Ellison Memorial Library, in their home in California.\n\n“It starts right here, right now, today,” Straczynski wrote. “After 46 years of anticipation, we are finally bringing this beast in for a landing.”\n\nContacted by the Guardian on Monday, Priest was unimpressed, saying that Straczynski was “in the same sort of unenviable position as Trump’s caddie”.\n\n“I kind of lost interest in all that years ago. Ellison clearly did too, along with everyone else. (Although I gather he went on with his magical thinking if anyone asked when he was going to deliver),” he wrote. “Many of the stories were withdrawn, because Ellison acted like a dick. Of the ones that remain, most of them are by writers who are now deceased, so the rights have expired and the estates would have to be traced. A lot of the writers have disowned their stories as juvenilia, or outdated, or simply because Ellison was acting like a dick.”\n\nBut, Priest added: “Mr Straczynski is an experienced professional, so maybe he’ll work something out.”"
