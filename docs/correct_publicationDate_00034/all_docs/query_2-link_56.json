        "text": "(1934–2018). The U.S. writer Harlan Ellison is best known for his science-fiction writing. Some of his more than 1,000 short stories are considered classics of the genre. Nevertheless, Ellison wrote in a number of styles and rejected the label of science-fiction writer as too limiting. In addition to short stories, he wrote novels, essays, and television and film scripts. His works are characterized by their humanistic themes and social commentary.\n\nHarlan Jay Ellison was born on May 27, 1934, in Cleveland, Ohio. He briefly attended Ohio State University and later became a prolific contributor of science fiction, crime fiction, and true confessions to genre magazines. After serving in the United States Army (1957–59), he edited Rogue magazine from 1959 to 1960 and founded the publishing house Regency Books in 1960. Soon he became a successful television scriptwriter.\n\nEllison made his reputation as a science-fiction writer with such short stories as “‘Repent, Harlequin!’ Said the Ticktockman” (1965), “A Boy and His Dog” (1969), and those in the collections I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream (1967) and The Beast That Shouted Love at the Heart of the World (1969). As an editor he published several important anthologies, including Dangerous Visions (1967) and Again, Dangerous Visions (1972). Among Ellison’s own collections are Deathbird Stories: A Pantheon of Modern Gods (1975), All the Lies That Are My Life (1980), The Harlan Ellison Hornbook (1990), Mefisto in Onyx (1993), and Slippage: Precariously Poised, Previously Uncollected Stories (1997). He won several Hugo and Nebula awards for his work. Ellison also wrote several books of television and movie criticism and numerous screenplays, television series, and teleplays for series such as Star Trek, Twilight Zone, and Babylon 5. He died on June 28, 2018, in Los Angeles, California."
