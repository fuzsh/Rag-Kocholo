        "text": "FIRST EDITIONS OF THE LANDMARK DANGEROUS VISIONS ANTHOLOGIES, INSCRIBED AND SIGNED BY HARLAN ELLISON AND 20 SCIENCE FICTION LUMINARIES INCLUDING BRADBURY, LE GUIN, NIVEN, LIEBER, POHL, ZELAZNY, SILVERBERG, STURGEON, FARMER AND MORE\n\nELLISON, Harlan, ed. Dangerous Visions. WITH: Again, Dangerous Visions. Garden City: Doubleday, 1967, 1972. Two volumes. Octavo, original full black cloth, original dust jackets.\n\nFirst editions of these two groundbreaking anthologies of original science fiction, each volume inscribed by the editor, renowned author Harlan Ellison, and additionally signed or inscribed by 20 significant contributors at their stories: Robert Silverberg, Frederik Pohl, Philip José Farmer, Larry Niven, Fritz Lieber, Poul Anderson, Damon Knight, Theodore Sturgeon, John Brunner and Roger Zelazny (in the first volume); Ursula K. Le Guin, Gene Wolfe, Ray Bradbury, Edward Bryant, Kate Wilhelm, Joanna Russ, Gregory Benford, Thomas Disch, Richard Lupoff and Terry Carr (in the second).\n\nImpatient with what they saw as the \"middle class\" constraints of the day's science fiction (\"sf\") magazines and fueled by the decade's \"larger social revolution\" (Priest, 164), young sf writers of the 1960s started exploring previously ignored or forbidden subjects and themes in strikingly new ways. \"Imagistic, highly metaphoric, inclined more towards psychology and the soft sciences… [and born of] the belief that sf could and should be taken seriously as literature\" (Clute & Nicholls, 866), the \"New Wave,\" spearheaded by such author-editors as Michael Moorcock in Britain and Frederik Pohl in the U.S., is arguably \"the single most important development of the science fiction genre\" (Priest, 164) until the emergence of cyberpunk (for which it helped sow the seeds).\n\nOne of sf's most accomplished, controversial and passionate writers, Harlan Ellison edited Dangerous Visions (1967) and Again, Dangerous Visions (1972) \"to shake things up,\" as he says in his introduction to the first book—to provide \"a canvas for new writing styles, bold departures, unpopular thoughts\" (page xxviii). \"[N]o one has ever told the speculative writer, 'Pull out all the stops, no holds barred, get it said!' Until this book came along. Don't look now, you're on the firing line in the big revolution\" (page xxiv). Dangerous Visions was the first major hardcover anthology of original science fiction, and marks the New Wave's high tide in the U.S. \"Among its stories, 'Aye, and Gomorrah…' by Samuel R. Delaney, 'Gonna Roll the Bones' by Fritz Lieber and 'Riders of the Purple Wage' by Philip José Farmer won major awards… [Again, Dangerous Visions] contained two more major-award winners, 'When It Changed' by Joanna Russ and The Word for World is Forest by Ursula K. Le Guin\" (Clute & Nicholls, 298). Whether or not they won awards, all 79 stories in these two volumes helped push sf toward greater stylistic innovation and cultural relevance. In the early 1970s, Ellison announced a third volume, for which he had bought over 100 stories. It has never seen print and is likely sf's most famous unpublished book. The two anthologies that exist, however, remain milestones in the genre's maturation, and played major roles in the larger New Wave's achievement of \"break[ing] down the barriers between sf and mainstream fiction\" (Clute & Nicholls, 866). Dangerous Visions: stated first edition. Again, Dangerous Visions: first edition (not stated, contrary to publisher's usual practice), first printing, with code \"N7\" at page 760 (Currey, 146). Anatomy of Wonder II-1335. Clute & Nicholls, 298. Christopher Priest, \"New Wave,\" Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, 163-73. Dangerous Visions inscribed by Ellison on the title page (\"To Ross ——, Harlan Ellison, 13 Oct 79\"); signed by Robert Silverberg (page 11), Frederik Pohl (page 22), Philip José Farmer (page 31), Larry Niven (page 208), Fritz Lieber (page 221), Poul Anderson (page 262), Theodore Sturgeon (page 331), John Brunner (page 451) and Roger Zelazny (page 500). Again, Dangerous Visions also inscribed by Ellison on the title page (\"To Russ, Harlan Ellison\"); signed by Ursula Le Guin (page 30), inscribed by Gene Wolfe (\"To Gil ——! Gene Wolfe\", page 126), signed (and with a quick, original sketch of a pair of eyes) by Ray Bradbury (page 164), inscribed by Edward Bryant (\"For Gil, from one of the remaining live writers in the book *gasp ghack* Edward Bryant, 8/31/78 A.D.,\" page 190), signed by Kate Wilhelm (page 201), Joanna Russ (also dated \"3/29/80,\" page 233), inscribed by Gregory Benford (\"To Gil—Gregory Benford,\" page 410), signed by Thomas M. Disch (page 592), inscribed by Richard Lupoff (\"Dick Lupoff\" in large letters across the illustration, then in smaller letters below, \"(that sez 'Dick Lupoff'), certified by: Dick Lupoff,\" page 618) and inscribed by Terry Carr (\"For Gil—Oct 19, 1974, Terry Carr,\" page 729).\n\nDangerous Visions with minor crease to cloth at spine foot, dust jacket with light edge-wear. Again, Dangerous Visions book and jacket fine. A beautiful pair of significant first editions, particularly desirable signed and inscribed by multiple major science fiction authors and in such outstanding, about-fine condition overall."
