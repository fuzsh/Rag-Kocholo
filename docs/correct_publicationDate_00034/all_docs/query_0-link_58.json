        "text": "Again, Dangerous Visions edited by Harlan Ellison - Audiobook Excerpt by Blackstone Publishing\n\npublished on 2024-05-20T21:50:10Z\n\nA follow-up to the original groundbreaking collection, Again, Dangerous Visions features forty-six short stories from giants of the science fiction genre. Grand Master of the Science Fiction Writers of America and winner of countless awardsâincluding the Hugo, Nebula, Edgar Allan Poe, and Bram StokerâHarlan Ellison proved once more that he was both unpredictable and irrepressible in this second collection of innovative science fiction. Again, Dangerous Visionsâthe middle installment in a planned three anthology seriesâincludes award-winning stories from incomparable writers such as Ursula K. Le Guin, Gene Wolfe, Ray Bradbury, Kurt Vonnegut, Piers Anthony, Dean Koontz, and James Tiptree, among many others. Unprecedented and electrifying, Again, Dangerous Visions cemented Harlan Ellisonâs legacy as the ultimate sci-fi anthologist.\n\nGenre\n\nAudiobooks"
