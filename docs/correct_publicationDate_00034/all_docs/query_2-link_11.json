Le Guin, Kurt Vonnegut, Dean Koontz, Thomas Disch, Ben Bova, and many more. Over the course of his legendary career, Harlan Ellison has defied--and sometimes defined--modern fantasy literature, all while refusing to allow any genre to claim him. A Grand Master of the Science Fiction Writers of America, winner of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Horror Writers Association as well as winner of countless awards, including the Hugo, Nebula, Edgar Allan Poe, and Bram Stoker, Ellison is as unpredictable as he is unique, irrepressible as he is infuriating. Again, Dangerous Visions is the classic companion to the most essential science fiction anthology ever published, and includes forty‑six original stories edited and with introductions by Harlan Ellison, featuring John Heidenry, Ross Rocklynne, Ursula K.
