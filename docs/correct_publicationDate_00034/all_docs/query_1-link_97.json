        "text": "In 1967 Harlan Ellison’s DANGEROUS VISIONS was published, and it rocked my then-fourteen-year-old sensibility. It was an anthology of original stories Ellison solicited from more than thirty authors, telling them Anything Goes, and asking for stories that pushed the envelope of free thought, even–or perhaps especially?–if the themes or prose were considered unpublishable.\n\nMany of the stories were wildly imaginative. Philip K. Dick’s “Faith of Our Fathers” brilliantly played with the nature of reality, and later he would become more famous for that in movies such as TOTAL RECALL and BLADE RUNNER. Fritz Lieber’s “Gonna Roll the Bones” celebrated the Tall Tale genre with a parable about divinity in a gambler’s hardscrabble existence. Many of the stories were dystopian, including Poul Anderson’s “Eutopia”–maybe. But in his Afterword, Anderson says maybe not. And there was Theodore Sturgeon, who also wrote the “Shore Leave” episode of the original Star Trek series, with his brilliantly-titled “If All Men Were Brothers, Would You Want One To Marry Your Sister?”\n\nThe reason I’m going on and on about this is because of Ellison’s dedication of the book, to the husband-and-wife team of illustrators whose wonderful woodcuts gave a breathtaking, movie-trailer-like preview to each story. Here is Ellison’s dedication in its entirety:\n\n“This book is dedicated with love, respect and admiration to\n\nLEO & DIANE DILLON\n\nwho painstakingly, out of friendship, showed the Editor\n\nthat black is black, white is white, and that goodness\n\ncan come from either; but never from gray.\n\nAnd to their son, LIONEL III, now known as Lee, with a\n\nsilent prayer that his world will not resemble our world.”\n\nI was thinking of the Dillons, and of Ellison’s dedication, when I did this page.\n\nI am no Leo&Diane Dillon. I envy their exquisite draughtsmanship, and their finely-tuned craftsmanship, and I urge you to seek out their work, as fresh today as fifty years ago.\n\nThis post is dedicated to Jack Kirby, comic-book artist extraordinaire, who had an astonishingly prolific career. He was the John Henry, Steel Drivin’ Man of comics. And sometimes, and sometimes disparagingly, he was referred to by his colleagues as “Jack the Hack.”\n\nThe thing about Hackwork, though, is that it is deadline-driven. Comic books as published in America during most of Kirby’s career HAD to come out once a month, every month, without fail. And the better you were, the more demand for your work there was, and the more deadlines you had. Sometimes the deadlines were so many and so crushing that the quality of work suffered.\n\nWriter Harlan Ellison, whose prolificity was legend, wrote “‘Repent, Harlequin!’ Said the Ticktockman,” a story about the insidiousness of deadlines. Introducing the story in one of his antholgies, he quoted a mogul saying, “I don’t care if it’s GOOD, as long as it’s Tuesday!”\n\nAnd in the intro to Phoenix Without Ashes, the novel of the Starlost he co-wrote with Edward Bryant, Jr., he told us about something Charles Beaumont told him when he moved to Hollywood, which was that attaining success in Hollywood was like climbing an enormous mountain of cow flop, in order to pluck one perfect rose from the summit–but, alas, after you have made that hideous climb, you have lost the sense of smell.\n\nSo this post is also dedicated to all hard-working people who dive in and get it done, day after week after month after year after decade. I want to specifically mention two Facebook friends of mine. One is Tom Orzechowski, who as letterer/calligrapher for the Uncanny X-Men and other mutant-related titles, and whatever else they threw at him, maintained a consistently high level of quality, of artistry, in his work. The other is my work colleague LaShawna Douglas-Muhammad, who worked her way up from line cook to manager for SSP America with class, determination, and sheer hard work. Tom and Shawna are two of my heroes and role models.\n\nHACK Work\n\nHave a Deadline!!! Don’t be sloW\n\nAh–your Hand flies to & frO\n\nCrank & fizz like PerrieR\n\nKIRBYESQUE IS A-OK\n\nEdit/Add, 6:48 PM: After a text conversation with the hyperkinetic creator of AMAZING ARIZONA COMICS, Russ Kazmierczak, who’s done mountains of quality deadline-driven work of his own, including multiple stints of producing an ENTIRE ISSUE of his fine publication in a mere 24 HOURS, I want to emphasize that the concepts of “hackwork” and “s/he’s a hack” have been often unfairly applied to dedicated, hard-working creatives. Prolificity often results in quality of work much higher than may be attained by waiting for inspiration to strike. Olympic hopefuls realize that being the best means punching that workout timeclock with consistency and high frequency, rain or shine, feel great or feel awful, “in a relationship” or “just got dumped.” It is a quality of Champions.\n\nHow this blog post came to be may be summed up, though it is one LONG summation, by this Facebook post I wrote on the 28th of June, between the sets of asterisks:\n\n****\n\nSpooky coincidences…I just found out via a post by my friend Anthony Ortega, son of my fellow GHS grad and good friend Joy Riner Taylor, that Harlan Ellison has died. Tony said that it was ironic because he’s just been going over Ellison’s work.\n\nOddly enough, I’d been thinking about Harlan Ellison too. About a week or two ago I looked him up on Wikipedia to see if he were still alive (he was born in 1934).\n\nSpookier still is the last 24 hours. I was thinking with sadness about the suicides of two good friends of mine, one in 1986 and one just this year. And there had been something in the news about suicide being a trending thing. And then the thought popped into my head: “We have got to watch ourselves.” Then the acrostic poet in me realized that the words WATCHING and YOURSELF both have eight letters in it, and I could do a double-acrostic poem about self-preservation using those words. And probably should: it could be much more meaningful than the hooey I usually crank out. (Just kidding, Folks.) (With a little grain of truth.)\n\nWhy is this SUCH a spooky coincidence? Well, Harlan Ellison was for the most part the opposite of a suicide–he once demanded open-heart surgery pronto, feeling time was of the essence. The phrase “DO ME” was in his demand to the doc, according to his own account. And they Did Him, and he lasted another 20 years. And in his career he wrote dozens of books. Two, during the Nixon era, were about television. They were THE GLASS TEAT and THE OTHER GLASS TEAT. And there were sequelae of those, of sorts, with a column in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, later put into book form, and later yet extended with a series of YouTube videos. And here the spookiness hits home. My acrostic poem, conceived before I learned of Harlan’s death, will be WATCHING YOURSELF. Harlan’s series was called HARLAN ELLISON’S WATCHING.\n\n****\n\nSince the post I’ve attempted the acrostic three times. Here’s the first try:\n\nWe do not tend to put our dirty laundry on display\n\nAnd when our feelings darken, they may travel incognito\n\nThe hope is that the mood will lift if it is left in situ\n\nConcealment is unwise but it so hurts to peel a layer\n\nHow desperately vulnerable modern times have made us\n\nIn fact the woe and pain make ending it almost attractive\n\nNew hope arises when we offer gentle love for all\n\nGained wisdom comes when mindfulness puts guardrail by the cliff\n\nThat was a brainbuster. I almost went with it but felt it missed the mark. On to Try #2:\n\nWhen purpose yields duality\n\nAnd makes for an imbroglio\n\nThen Life sneers, Yeah? The Same To You\n\nCanasta, craps, chemin de fer\n\nHold Doom just like a blunderbuss\n\nIf action is evocative\n\nNow we may wax Neandertal\n\nGlyphs mark our bets, no call, no bluff\n\nThat try suffered from loss of comprehensibility, straitjacketed as it was by the acrostic. Good try though it was, it was necessary to try, try again.\n\nThat led to this final version:\n\nHere are those final-draft words:\n\nWell, I fear we’re going Ka-Blooey\n\nAnd if you can argue, please do\n\nThis school is called Letspreserve U\n\nCommitment & Shame make a pair\n\nHow fell is Depression, whose heirs\n\nInflict themselves Harm, unaware\n\nNow, please–one more round for us all\n\nGood mindfulness works–let’s be off\n\nOne last little spookiness. I went to Goodreads to look at the book jacket for HARLAN ELLISON’S WATCHING. The intro paragraph is Ellison’s style. If he didn’t write it, some damn good pasticher did. Whichever, the last two sentences address friendlessness (first sentence) and self-preservation, which is the theme of this page. Word for word, here they are: “As an essayist, he has no equal; as a film critic he has no friends. Take care.”\n\nHere are some more self-rejected pages of mine. Ironically, there are yet more pages that I am yet again self-rejecting. The ones that don’t make the cut either are not visually engaging enough or are repetitive of themes or motifs previously presented.\n\nOnce upon a time the Phoenix Art Museum had a show of some of the stuff Claude Monet did at Giverny that was still unfinished at the time he died. Of the dozen-and-a-half canvases presented, there was only one that was worth looking at as a painting and not as a clue of Monet’s creative process; and “sketch and then fill in” about summed up his creative process on individual canvases. It was thin soup indeed, and if it hadn’t been Monet doing it the museum would never have shown it. Consequently, in the (I hope) far future when I start to get a glimmer of that Tunnel with the Bright Light, I hope I will have tagged those sketch-musings of mine that are not worthy of a viewer’s attention, that they may be consigned to the flames. (See Harlan Ellison’s ALL THE LIES THAT ARE MY LIFE for a more extensive discussion of this philosophy.)\n\nOnward:\n\nPopefullness\n\nMust’ve done this around the time the latest Francis tried on his funny hat.\n\nStruggle/Pinnacle/Afterwar\n\nComic book writer Steve Gerber, whose Howard the Duck made a great comic book but a horribly Uncanny Valley movie that misused Lea Thompson and Jeffrey Jones, once said something like “You know what there is at the top of the ladder? Another ladder.” And that’s where you Kick It Up A Notch or more aptly Take It To The Next Level. More irony: I wasn’t able to do that with this one; I realized it would take about five times the effort a ‘normal’ page requires.\n\nInvolvements\n\nHere’s one that would be easy to finish. I vote it Most Likely To See Completion amongst these Salon entries.\n\nSkeleton/Key\n\nGee, I just love bone configurations, especially if they hang together…\n\nLogarithm\n\nLogarithm, I got music. I got Readers; who could ask for anything more? (See also Algorithm…)\n\nCollide O Hadrons\n\nI’m sure this was done around the time scientists confirmed the existence of the Higgs boson, the misnamed “God Particle.” I guess “Make-the-Universe-Possible Particle” is too much of a mouthful.\n\nThere you have them, for now. There may be a Part Three, but I’ll do a few posts prior even if there is one.\n\nThe Epigram\n\n“Gadfly is what they call you when you are no longer dangerous. I much prefer troublemaker, malcontent, desperado.” Harlan Ellison (Gadfly)\n\nThe Sonnet\n\nEnchantment may produce ye Hippogriff\n\nEntanglements may render souls aloof\n\nEmollients may please–here, have a whiff\n\nEndangerment’s not reckless in a spoof\n\nGreek myths & Grimmish færy tales compel\n\nGore-mandatory ghast will guts unspool\n\nGrim readers have used entrails to foretell\n\nGood luck & otherwise for moneyed fool\n\nAnd such a fool lives fates here bliss’d there snarly\n\nAugmented: maidens fair & b u l l i e s burly\n\nAssuaged with frothy brews of hops & barley\n\nAnd ending in a t u n n e l bright & swirly\n\nDo let’s not let affright the stake or spike\n\nD e l i v e r a n c e is kind, & unalike\n\nThe Annotation\n\nFirst I thought of a Gadfly. Then it occurred that there are two words, Egad and Flye, that acrosticized would be Gadfly bookended by the letter E. The result promised to be a startling (Egad!) exercise (Flye!) in nonsensical-but-not hybridization. Myths from early history have done rudimentary gene-splicing: see Pegasus and Hippogriff. When we make up stories, if anything’s possible and it’s entertainingly told, the more outrageous the Nonesuches the better. And story-danger is not reality-danger.\n\n“Gore-mandatory ghast” is a weird tip of the hat to Mervyn Peake and his Castle Gormenghast. I have not read more than a handful of Peake’s words, and I found his illustrations unpalatably crude, but I got enough of a taste to see he was a unique visionary and a singular storyteller.\n\nI use the word Deliverance ambiguously. “Deliverance is kind” is a skewed tribute to Stephen Crane, who wrote “War is kind” while giving only the barest hint of explanation. Like Crane, I think the reader is rewarded if she or he must supply important details without regard to what the “right” answer is. Dear reader, whatever you think Deliverance means in this poem, you’ll be right–if you are sincere.\n\nOne last note about Harlan Ellison. He has won innumerable awards for his writing, and is admired by such as Tom Smothers, Robin Williams, and Neil Gaiman. He was Dangerous once. I do not think he is Dangerous any more, not the way he wants to be Dangerous, so I harmlessly rib him with the “Gadfly” tag, but I’d love to be wrong.\n\nAnyone else want to play?\n\nBelow I supply the beginning of a page. I may complete the page as soon as later today, or it may lay fallow for a while. The triple acrostic is HARMONIC SYMPHONIC SYMBIOSIS. A hint to writing these is to start with the words at the end of the lines. If the letter I gives you trouble, try doing an Internet search on “words ending in i.” Note also that HARMONIC has eight letters while SYMPHONIC and SYMBIOSIS both have nine; so I’ve supplied line guides that include two lines coming from the C in HARMONIC. Hope you try it for ten minutes, dear reader; you may become hooked, and it’d be an ego boo for me to midwife another acrostic poet into the virtual world. Good Fun and Have Luck!\n\nThe 16th-Century apothecary and prognosticator Michel de Nostredame, popularly known as Nostradamus, is most likely better-known than the 20th-century biochemist, raconteur, limericist, Futurian, essayist, humorist, correspondent, toastmaster, and, yes, prognosticator, Isaac Asimov. Dr. Asimov is perhaps best known for his Foundation series, which covered more than a thousand years of Galactic history. But he also wrote Asimov’s Guide to Science, Asimov’s Guide to Shakespeare, Asimov’s Guide to the Bible, and about four hundred other books that made him the only author to have original writing in every single major Dewey Decimal System classification in the library. His daily writing streak extended from his teens till close to the end of his death at 72. In addition to his books, he corresponded with EVERYONE who wrote him–over one hundred THOUSAND letters.\n\nIndeed, one of the biggest regrets of my life is that I never wrote him. I wanted to–I had found what was perhaps a fatal flaw in the logic of his science-fiction short story “Billiard Ball.” But I had not the wherewithal to do so. Alas! His letter to me would have been one of my most prized possessions.\n\nMy late, great father was fond of saying “Less prediction, more production.” This is the latest of my several salutes to him. And I’d also acknowledge Thomas Carlyle for his immortal quotation: “Produce! Produce! Were it but the pitifullest infinitesimal fraction of a Product, produce it, in God’s name! ‘Tis the utmost thou hast in thee: out with it, then. Up, up! Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy whole might. Work while it is called Today; for the Night cometh, wherein no man can work.” And–what the hell, grateful acknowledgment also to Harlan Ellison, writer of more than one thousand short stories, without whom I might never have read Carlyle’s quotation."
