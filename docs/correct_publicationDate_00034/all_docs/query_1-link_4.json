        "text": "I'm flipping these paragraphs around for a reason in my reply.\n\nSecond, with this thing's endless history of not happening, why the hell would JMS announce it before even presenting it to publishers? Why not wait until every t is crossed and every i dotted?\n\nMy cynical thought, when JMS said that he was soliciting new stories, was: \"Why tempt fate like that?\" Priest's essay is full of examples of Ellison announcing that the TOC is locked... and then he solicits more stories.\n\nFirst, back when the first Dangerous Visions was published, how many people would have been excited by the news of the long-awaited third volume of an anthology of tales from the crazed, cutting-edge age of the flappers and Prohibition?\n\nI honestly wonder how many publishers would be excited by this -- \"The manuscript's a million and a half words long, a third of the authors are dead, two-thirds of the stories you're offering were written fifty years ago, the potential audience for this book is old, even with the new stories you've commissioned the line-up isn't particularly diverse. What kind of market do you think exists for this book?\" I'm not trying to sound like a cynic, but the economics of the book aren't in its favor and really haven't been for thirty-five years. Commissioning new stories from writers who, in many cases, probably weren't even born when Ellison had the first TLDV story in hand, is a way to make the book more relevant to today's readers, I suppose, but that also makes the book less Ellison's TLDV and more JMS's TLDV.\n\nIf JMS ends up going the crowdfunding route just to get it out there, I will not be surprised.\n\nJMS has posted that The Last Dangerous Visions has been finished and is now being shopped to publishers (he mentions on his Patreon that he's got his fingers crossed for an auction). If you're curious, the final word count is about a tenth of Christopher Priest's estimate mentioned above, 112,000 words.\n\nJ. Michael Straczynski said:\n\nTHE LAST DANGEROUS VISIONS has at last been completed. The final draft went off to the agency that will be handling the sale about fifteen minutes ago. This has been a massive effort...112,000 words...tracking down the estates of the original writers to be included in the book, and nailing down some newer A List writers; fans of Harlan's who wanted to be a part of TLDV. (And for the record, Harlan continued to buy stories for the anthology right through the 90s, and stopped only due to illness. He saw TLDV as a living document, and fought to keep it relevant when some stories became less timely or were supplanted by real world events.)\n\nI will have more to say about the contents at a later date, but suffice to say that they include some of the most visionary writers in the science fiction genre over the last 48 years."
