        "text": "from sfgate's daily dish...\n\ni thought she was married to/dating norman reedus...\n\nAustralian actor Heather Ledger reportedly is having no problem getting over his split from actress Michelle Williams -- he's been spotted romancing supermodel Helena Christensen.\n\nThe actor -- who ended his engagement to Williams earlier this month -- has allegedly been stepping out with the Danish beauty after they were seen \"making out throughout dinner\" at Chinese restaurant Wakiya on Tuesday, reports Page Six.\n\nFurther sightings of the pair attending the recent after-party for director David Cronenberg's new film, \"Eastern Promises,\" has fueled reports of a romance, with Ledger said to have \"held her bag for her as she did interviews.\"\n\nThis can only tell me his relationship with Michelle Williams must have ended many, many, moons ago to be dating so soon again.\n\nor not and he's just a typical male pig.\n\ni thought she was married to/dating norman reedus...\n\nThey broke up in 2005 (maybe 2004) but have remained close because of their son.\n\nAnyway last I heard Helena was making out with Josh \"modelizer\" Hartnett."
