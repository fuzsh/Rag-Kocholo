        "text": "In a new interview for Elle magazine, the fiercely private Michelle Williams opened up about her signature cropped hairdo and why she refuses to grow her hair long, despite her daughter Matilda’s wish.\n\n“What Matilda would love is for her mom to grow out the cropped hair, though that’s unlikely to happen any time soon,” she said about her six-year-old daughter with former partner Heath Ledger.\n\n“I’ve really grown into it — I feel like myself with short hair. And it’s been a really long time since I had long hair, five years,” she explained.\n\n“Of course, the only people who like it are gay men and my girlfriends. Straight men across the board are not into this hair!” she added.\n\nBut one man did, she revealed.\n\n“I cut it for the one straight man who has ever liked short hair and I wear it in memorial of somebody who really loved it,” she said of Ledger who died suddenly in 2008 at age 28."
