        "text": "FROM the moment they met - working together on the set of Brokeback Mountain - Heath Ledger and Michele Williams knew they were right for each other.\n\nEven Heath's co-star, Jake Gyllenhaal, noticed it straight away. \"I remember being in rehearsal, and the two of them had googly eyes with each other,\" he said.\n\nIt was the start of a fizzling three-year relationship, during which the famous couple had a daughter together before splitting in 2007 after an argument about Dark Knight star Heath's drug use.\n\nBut they had only been apart for five months when Michelle's phone rang with the terrible news that the man she thought was her soulmate had died aged 28 from an accidental overdose of prescription painkillers.\n\nMichelle was utterly heartbroken and became obsessed with finding love again after his death - with three engagements and a wedding in just 10 years.\n\nHaving been made a single mum to their daughter Matilda, now 12, Michelle was driven to an obsession with finding The One.\n\nShe has already been engaged twice this year, to financier Andrew Youmans and musician Phil Elverum, who she married in July - and freely admits that she's struggled to find love since Heath.\n\nAnd with her tragic ex even mentioned in the statement of her recent marriage to musician Phil Elverum, it's clear that Heath continues to shape Michelle's life a decade after his death.\n\nLove at first sight\n\nMichelle, 38, was born into a Christian family, and attended a private Christian school in San Diego which held strong and strict beliefs about relationships.\n\nBut it was on set of her 2005 breakthrough film Brokeback Mountain – which the church slammed for its storyline involving two gay cowboys - that she met Heath and fell in love for the first time.\n\nWhile handsome Heath had already cemented himself as Hollywood’s latest pin-up with lead roles in 10 Things I Hate About You (1999) and A Knight’s Tale (2001) under his belt, this was Michelle’s first major film since hitting the small screen in Dawson’s Creek as an 18-year-old.\n\n\"I remember him looking at her, and her looking up at him with these wide eyes,\" recalls Brokeback Mountain screenwriter Diana Ossana.\n\n\"She was almost startled by the attention. For him, it was truly love at first sight. He was so taken with her.\"\n\nThey dated for three years, became engaged and had a little girl, Matilda, born in 2005 when Michelle was 25.\n\nBut when Matilda was two, things took an unexpected turn and the couple suddenly separated.\n\nCracks in the relationship and a phone call from hell\n\nCracks began to appear in the couple's relationship when a video emerged of Heath admitting he \"smoked five joints a day for 20 years\" while a woman in the video appeared to snort cocaine.\n\nFollowing a public backlash, Heath immediately cleaned up and stopped drinking, but the damage in their relationship was done.\n\nHe moved out of their apartment in Brooklyn, New York, and it was while Michelle was on set of her next movie, Mammoth, in Sweden that she got the call about his death.\n\nWhilst midway through shooting for his final movie, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, Heath was found dead in bed in his Manhattan flat by his housekeeper.\n\nHe'd taken a cocktail of six types of prescription drugs and gone into cardiac arrest - paramedics administered CPR but failed to revive him.\n\n'How will he find us - he won't know where we are'\n\nThat night, Michelle didn’t sleep.\n\nShe took the decision to continue working on her film, although she’s since admitted: \"It was horrible. I don’t remember most of it.\"\n\nDesperately trying to hide her heartbreak, she began dating American filmmaker Spike Jonze, 48, six months later.\n\nShe was criticised for moving on so quickly, and now admits it was a rebound relationship to heal the heartbreak of losing Heath.\n\n\"The timing was impossible,\" she said. \"I thought falling in love again was the only thing that was going to save me from the pain. This erroneous idea: It just makes things more complicated.\"\n\nThe relationship didn’t survive more than a year.\n\nAfter that, Michelle decided to take a 12-month break from acting, and she moved out of the flat she, Heath and Matilda had once shared, in a bid to move on.\n\nBut she later revealed: \"I was inconsolable [about moving out] because I felt, how will he find us? This is where we lived and he won’t know where we are now.\"\n\nChild heartbreak\n\nMichelle stepped away from relationships for the next three years.\n\nBut in a new interview with Vanity Fair, she says: \"I never gave up on love. I always say to Matilda: 'Your dad loved me before anybody thought I was talented, or pretty, or had nice clothes.'\"\n\nShe also desperately wanted Matilda to grow up with brothers and sisters, and dreamed of having six children in total.\n\n\"I really wanted – and I really expected, or imagined – that Matilda would have siblings close to her age,\" she said. \"I couldn’t make that happen.\"\n\nSoon after, Michelle turned to her best friend, fellow Dawson’s Creek alumni Busby Phillips, to play matchmaker.\n\nShe introduced Michelle to Muppets actor Jason Segel in 2012. They hit it off and began dating, with him being the first man introduced to Matilda since her dad.\n\nFive months after they went public, it was reported that Jason had been in touch with Heath’s family in Melbourne – and had been given their blessing to marry Michelle and become a stepfather to Matilda.\n\nBut by 2013, despite much talk of marriage, the pair called off their engagement.\n\nIt’s believed he was unwilling to leave LA, while she refused to uproot Matilda from New York.\n\nThe single mums' club\n\nWith that romance ending, and Matilda getting older, Michelle found life as a single parent lonely.\n\nShe admitted last year: \"Matilda is in a good place but it’s not been easy raising her alone. Sometimes it can feel alienating.\n\n\"At Matilda’s school, there's only two of us single mothers. Everyone else has a partner, so we buddy up.\"\n\nIt was also tough for her juggling a career with being a mum, and finding love.\n\n\"[Being a mum] is at the centre of everything I do,\" she has said.\n\nTwo engagements in one year\n\nMichelle began dating New York financier Andrew Yourmans in 2017 and less than 12 months later she was spotted with a huge ring on her engagement finger.\n\nAfter showing off the sparkler at the 2018 Golden Globes, an insider revealed: \"She wants a good guy and a stable family life. Michelle was totally focused on giving Matilda the best upbringing possible.\"\n\nAnother confidante added: \"It took her a long time to get over Heath.\"\n\nThen at the beginning of this year, Andrew and Michelle quietly split.\n\nMichelle had almost giving up on finding The One, saying she didn’t believe in her happy-ever-after.\n\n\"It's hard to romanticise romance when you're 36,\" she explained after the break-up.\n\n\"When you've been a parent for 11 years and you've done it alone, you don't have romantic ideals because you have a practical understanding that you can do it by yourself.\n\n\"The romantic idea of meeting your person and having a storybook family life that looks like the model you grew up with… well, that doesn't really exist for me.\"\n\nBut Michelle didn’t have to wait long.\n\nIn July, after a brief and secret engagement – her third – to Phil Elverum, 40, they tied the knot with few family and friends in New York.\n\nIt seems Michelle believes it’s third time lucky, and last week hinted her new husband was the one she’d been looking for all along.\n\nFinally happy, she said: \"Ultimately the way he loves me is the way I want to live my life on the whole. I work to be free inside of the moment.\n\n\"I parent to let Matilda feel free to be herself, and I am finally loved by someone who makes me feel free.\""
