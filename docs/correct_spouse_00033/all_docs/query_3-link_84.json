        "text": "When Heath Ledger won the best supporting actor Oscar for his Joker in The Dark Knight, three members of the actor's Australian family accepted the statuette for him, and on behalf of his infant daughter, Matilda. It was a touching moment, far more tactful for the absence of Matilda and of the little girl's mother, the considerable actor Michelle Williams, who is surely in danger now of being written off or eternally labelled as Heath Ledger's girl.\n\nIn fact, Williams had won a supporting actress nomination playing the wife in Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain. Her relationship with Ledger was apparently over before his death, but that didn't prevent her name becoming inseparably associated with his. To which the practical filmgoer might as well argue: it's bad enough to have one promising career erased before our eyes. So let's give room for Michelle Williams to make her own way emotionally and professionally. Let's start by treating her as herself, as one of the most versatile actors around still under the age of 30.\n\nShe is from Kalispell, Montana, which is near enough Brokeback country. But in her early teens, she got a legal separation from her parents, took off for Los Angeles, and began to make her way as an actor. She started in television, but got a small role in Species (1995) and then another in A Thousand Acres (1997). The next year she won the role of Jen Lindley and played more than 100 episodes in the series Dawson's Creek. By her early 20s, therefore, she had a veteran's experience. Though a famous beauty, she quickly mastered the art of varying her appearance on screen and managing to look dowdy or ordinary. As such, she quickly became an actor beloved in the American independent movement. She can play anyone, without undue glamour or starriness, and she has plainly identified herself with a range of small, low-budget pictures by new directors.\n\nIndeed, she has become a fixture and seemingly a lifelong member at the Independent Spirit awards, the prize-giving dedicated to independent film, where the stars are expected to look as if they'd just stepped out of a trash trailer.\n\nShe was in Halloween H2O, she was a visitor to the White House with Kirsten Dunst in Andrew Fleming's Nixon-era comedy Dick, and she stuck by the young actor-director, Christina Ricci, as she sought to make Prozac Nation, an embattled film about prescription drug addiction that lingered for years on the shelf.\n\nThe films that followed were The United States of Leland; Thomas McCarthy's The Station Agent; and A Hole in One. Her reputation and recognition factor soared with Imaginary Heroes, Wim Wenders' Land of Plenty and Michael Showalter's The Baxter. That's when she made Brokeback Mountain. Since then, she has been in The Hawk Is Dying, in The Hottest State (directed by Ethan Hawke) and showing a comic touch in the Bob Dylan pastiche picture, I'm Not There, directed by Todd Haynes.\n\nShe played the central role of the young mother in the film made from Chris Cleave's novel, Incendiary (though it got only limited release). And then last year she was also in Deception, Wendy and Lucy, and the cult hit, Synecdoche, New York, directed by Charlie Kaufman. Later this year, she will be seen in Lukas Moodyson's Mammoth and with Leonardo DiCaprio in Shutter Island, directed by Martin Scorsese.\n\nNo one in the business doubts Michelle Williams's quality, yet it's noted that she's been dogged by bad luck - the failure of Prozac Nation and the disappointment of Incendiary, plus her evident feeling of not wanting to exploit the link with Ledger. At the same time, next year she will be 30 in a world where another dozen actresses wanting to be her appear every year. In truth, like any \"promising\" 29-year-old actress not quite recognised by the general public, Michelle Williams needs a breakthrough role quickly."
