Ledger seems like such a 'rat' I hope it does work out but I can see him cheating on her later on.\n\nNaomi had a lucky escape if you ask me, she can do better than him.\n\nI'm not jealous BTW\n\n0\n\nWhy all the fuss? He got to snog Jake Gyllenhaal in Broke Back Mountain. If his partner's are finding his philandering a problem, I would have been glad to deputise in this instance.\n\n0\n\nI have to say that I agree with the poster who said they saw heartbreak for Michelle in this one. I can't see Heath staying faithful to her.\n\n0\n\nGrannyMatrix wrote:\n\nHmmm...wonder what the f*ck his/her problem is...\n\nwhoops, stopped wondering. Nay mind.\n\nWell possibly the only time in my life I've seen this expression 'Straw man argument' used with any degree of solemnity is on this forum. It has become a meme throughout the forum and now basically lots of people use it to discredit an argument.\n\n0\n\nmrfreeze wrote:\n\nI can't believe Michelle would get pregnant without being in a long term relationship, I thought she was stronger than that.\n\nShe seems to be searching for a father figure, but that could be just my interpretation.

I mean ffs, it's hardly the sort of discussion that merits any philosophical thought processes is it? It's just a bit of bloody fun!\n\n0\n\nsticki-vicki wrote:\n\nNot admirable but it happens, just beacuse she fell pregnant doesn't make her stupid/weak/and less of a woman.\n\nThings happen and they all happen for a reason!\n\nYeah like not using contraception when you have sex.\n\nAnd just because I said 'I thought she was stronger' doesn't mean I think she is weak, again with the 'straw men'.\n\n0"
