        "text": "The 'Blue Valentine' star appeared in an interview on Nightline Tuesday night to promote her film, but also talked about how she reacted immediately after the death, and in the years following. Turns out, in some ways, it was easier then.\n\n\"In a strange way, I miss that year, because all those possibilities that existed then are gone,\" she said. \"It didn't seem unlikely to me that he could walk through a door or could appear behind a bush. It was a year of very magical thinking, and in some ways I'm sad to be moving further and further away from it.\"\n\nWilliams met Ledger on the set of their film, 'Brokeback Mountain,' and had a daughter together. Now, in 'Blue Valentine,' she plays a woman suffering from heartbreak again, this time with Ryan Gosling. The film will be released on December 29th."
