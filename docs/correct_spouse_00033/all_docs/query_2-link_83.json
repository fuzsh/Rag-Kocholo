        "text": "Michelle Williams Regrets Talking About Heath Ledger's Death\n\nMichelle Williams has a bone to pick with the folks at Nightline. The ABC News program recently aired an interview with the Blue Valentine actress in which she opened up about the January 2008 death of Heath Ledger, her ex-boyfriend and father to her daughter Matilda, 5.\n\n\"It all becomes rather tricky [talking about Ledger] because I don't want to say something without resonance but then I don't want to go too far,\" Williams, 30, tells writer Kevin Sessums in an interview on The Daily Beast.\n\n\"I just had an experience with Nightline that got edited in such a way that seemed as if I did go too far,\" the Golden Globe nominee says. \"It was a three-hour interview that was edited in such a way that was devastating to me.\"\n\nShe continues: \"They used those few quotes and the way they edited the piece to sell the interview, and it appeared as if I were breaking some kind of silence and sitting down with the express purpose to discuss something that is very private to me.\"\n\nThe actress says it's still a \"struggle\" because she yearns to discuss the memories with close pals off the record.\n\n\"I experienced a lot of loss after his death,\" she offers. \"I lost my city because of all the paparazzi descending upon us. I actually lost my journal during that time, oddly enough. I literally couldn't hold on to anything. It felt as if things were literally slipping through my fingers. Things were just streaming away from me. I lost my sense of humor. I'm still sort of looking for that.\"\n\nOverall, Williams is feeling cheerier these days, however. Christmas with Matilda was \"a really good one,\" she says. \"[Matilda] wrote two letters to Santa the night before. The first one was 'Dear Santa, How is your wife, Mrs. Claus?' The second was 'Dear Santa, I hope you have a good summer next year.'\"\n\nsource\n\nMichelle Williams: There's a hole in mine and Matilda's Life. It is impossible to fill it\n\nMichelle Williams posed with a gorgeous and classic look for the cover of Marie Claire's latest issue in a Valentino dress and a Tom Binns necklace. Along with this fabulous photo spread, Michelle Williams opened up about her personal life with the only daughter “Matilda” in an interview with Marie Claire.\n\n\"Very obviously, for me and her, there's a hole in our life,\" the actress revealed in the interview, \"Of course the natural inclination is to want to fill it and make it disappear, but what I've come to recently is that it's impossible.\" She continues, \"Nothing will fit in that hole because what we want back there we can't get, which is this one person. I'm not going to rush anything and scamper around like a mad person and make myself crazy. I'm trying to be respectful of the absence. I'm not trying to fill it up. It is what it is.\"\n\nsource\n\nOscar snubs: Acting\n\nHere are just a few of the notable recent snubs in the acting categories.\n\nSupporting actor\n\nLet's begin by breaking the 2000-and-beyond rule established in the best-picture story: It was so criminally awful that Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday in \"Tombstone\" (1993) and Alec Baldwin in \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" (1992) weren't honored that it would be like compounding the fault to leave them out here. Those are among the most-quoted performances by guys of a certain age. Kilmer, despite \"The Doors\" and \"Spartan,\" also from the early '90s, has yet to get a nod. OK, back to the rules.\n\nThis is probably the category in which \"slow and steady\" most often does not win the race. Flashy turns are what get noticed here, not the solid-as-rock work of Sam Shepard as the stoic father in \"Brothers\" (2009), Bill Irwin as the quietly coping dad in \"Rachel Getting Married\" (2008) or Paul Schneider in \"Lars and the Real Girl\" (2007). But one of the most glaring omissions of the past 10 years - perhaps more widely recognized today, given the career he went on to have - was Heath Ledger's brief but deeply affecting turn in \"Monster's Ball\" (2001).\n\nSupporting actress\n\nElaine May in one of the funniest Woody Allen roles in years, in the otherwise unremarkable \"Small Time Crooks\" (2000); Taraji P. Henson's hooker with a voice of gold in \"Hustle and Flow\" (2005); Natalie Portman in \"Garden State\" (2004). 2009 was a tough year for deserving supporting actresses - including Julianne Moore, \"A Single Man\"; Samantha Morton, \"The Messenger\"; and Melanie Laurent, \"Inglourious Basterds.\" This year's list of omissions figures to be similarly painful.\n\nActor\n\nChristian Bale is a likely first-time nominee this year, having been passed over before for \"The Machinist\" (for which he lost 60 pounds), \"Rescue Dawn\" and \"3:10 to Yuma.\" But among the highly respected actors yet to receive a call from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences: The Bay Area's Sam Rockwell, whose worthy work includes \"Moon,\" \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\" and \"Snow Angels\"; Colin Farrell - \"Tigerland\" and \"In Bruges\"; John Cusack - \"High Fidelity\" and \"Grace Is Gone\"; Chiwetel Ejiofor - \"Dirty Pretty Things\" and \"Kinky Boots.\"\n\nActress\n\nTo make a point, let's focus on actresses from foreign-language films. It's to be expected their movies will receive their share of snubs, as they're simply not seen by nearly as many academy voters as, say, \"Chicago.\" But in the past few years, despite nods for Marion Cotillard, Penélope Cruz and Catalina Sandalina Moreno, two of the grittiest and most daring performances by actresses in the past few decades were completely missed by the Oscars:\n\nCharlotte Gainsbourg, \"Antichrist\" (2009), and Anamaria Marinca, \"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\" (2007), delivered utterly fearless, totally committed work that matched intelligence and emotional depth. Both films scared the hell out of people because of their content - \"Antichrist\" was graphic to the extreme and \"4 Months\" concerned a woman in Ceausescu's Romania determined to secure an abortion for her helpless best friend - but won major international honors, particularly for the actresses. Also in this category: Björk's head-turning appearance in \"Dancer in the Dark\" (2000), like \"Antichrist\" directed by Lars von Trier; and Audrey Tautou - iconic as \"Amelie\" (2001) and demonstrating impressive range from innocence to sophistication in \"Coco Before Chanel\" (2009).\n\nThis year, a third seems fated to join this group - Noomi Rapace in \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\"\n\nsource\n\nHeath Ledger's Lonesome Trail: Rolling Stone's 2006 Cover Story\n\nWhen actors become movie stars, it puts a strain on everybody. Family members get phone-called with no adjustment for the time difference; paparazzi stake out a fresh address; the rest of us lift our eyes to another personality we're obliged to have an opinion about. This is a drag for Heath Ledger, who is twenty-six and has learned to keep his personality locked in the house — where it whines at doors, tears up furniture, gets into the yard at just the worst moments. \"In the past,\" he says, \"I've tried so hard to withhold myself — even down to giving a smile.\" The actor, who is Australian, speaks with a commonwealth accent that's both arch and street. \"I didn't want to be people's opinions of who I am or what I said,\" he says.\n\nOne day, his girlfriend, Michelle Williams, wrote a song title — \"Old Man River\" — on his forearm. Ledger got a tattoo artist to run the needles over her words, the way a shopkeeper will frame his first dollar. The song comes from a sad musical, and contains this key advice: \"He must know somethin', he don't say nothin'.\" So last summer, when the couple, first saw Brokeback Mountain — sitting in one of the poker-faced office towers of Manhattan — it should have been perfect: no people, no opinions. The room went dark. Ledger rides a horse, falls in love with another man, breaks his heart, misses out on the chance of his life. The lights came up, Ledger and Williams moved through the lobby. And Ledger had no idea what he'd just seen. \"I understood that it flowed, it was presented well. But whether it was good, whether it was bad — we walked out not knowing what we'd just watched.\"\n\nAnd sometimes the dog gets loose. When we meet, Ledger discusses a rough moment: Williams, playing his unlucky wife, slips to a doorway in find Ledger in an embrace with co-star Jake Gyllenhaal. In a tight shot, you see her see her face cloud over: Williams understands she'll never make the man she loves happy. Ledger wants to hear about audience response. I say they gasped. Ledger takes this in. \"Yeah,\" he says. \"Her poor character. Michelle played it so well — just that look on her lace.\" He shrugs. \"Every time I see it, I can't help but laugh.\"\n\nIt's months later, and everything has changed. David Letterman is doing the top ten signs of being a gay cowboy. Brokeback has become a cultural moment, a film to take sides about, the toll charge for entering the national conversation. Ledger arrived in Hollywood as a flyaway figure. Now he's receiving the media attention that usually goes to kids in wells. Oscar bowed deepest this year to Brokeback Mountain, crowning Ledger with his first nomination as Best Actor. Ledger retains his physical size and shape: in every other aspect, he's becoming larger.\n\nEnnis Del Mar is Ledger's starmaker role, and if you strip off the coating, he's done it the old-fashioned way. It's the part Robert Redford made a career out of in The Way We Were: the love, object who doesn't want to be loved, who flickers out of reach.\n\nHis approach to being interviewed is not dissimilar. For Ledger, reporters are the sadistic border guards of a country he must pass through. Last August, when he disliked an Australian interviewer's questions, he clammed up, peeled an orange on live TV. So when he wants to meet for lunch in New York, my canny move is to dress like him, When I arrive at a tidy New York espresso bar in shorts, T-shirt, crapped-up jacket. Ledger's eyes drift right past me. \"Wouldn't have picked you for a journalist,\" he says. \"Which is good.\"\n\nsource\n\nThis post was bought to you by: Heath Ledger & Britney Spears <3\n\n“I want that girl [Britney Spears], I can’t deny it.
