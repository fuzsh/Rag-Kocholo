        "text": "LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA: Michelle Williams, Heath Ledger's ex-girlfriend, has reportedly sought to gain control of the late star's biopic. The 42-year-old actress was reportedly adamant to have Busy Phillipps, 43, portray her if an autobiographical movie was made on the 'Brokeback Mountain' star. She also reportedly wants any film about the actor to center on their love story and the joyful childhood of their daughter Matilda, who is now 17.\n\nAccording to Woman's Day, when it came to trying to develop a movie about Ledger's life, a source close to Williams warned, \"Movie execs better be careful what they wish for,\" as she was reportedly quite protective of his legacy. “(Michelle) is very protective and would want full control over Heath's story and she won't budge on things they probably won’t like – for example, casting Busy,” sources said. As per PEOPLE, Williams was strongly in favor of Philipps playing her in a film as the 42-year-old actress claimed, \"She (Busy) knows me better than anyone.\"\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\nMichelle Williams reveals she quit film 'Blood' because story reminded her of Heath Ledger\n\nMichelle Williams engaged to 'Fosse/Verdon' director Thomas Kail and expecting their first child together"
