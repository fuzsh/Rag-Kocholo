        "text": "It’s interesting that in a documentary about the late Heath Ledger, the one moment that really, genuinely moved me was when Ledger’s childhood friend tells us about his first meeting with Michelle Williams. The friend said the actress hugged him by ‘climbing into his soul and squeezing him with affection’. It speaks volumes not only about her open heart, but also the man she madly fell in love with during the shoot of Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain. Ledger was her kindred spirit who knew how to *give* all the way. Williams and Ledger brought a child into the world during their courtship, who they named Matilda.\n\nOne of the primary reasons why the actor has been a subject of immense curiosity is because of his penultimate performance as the Joker in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, and his sudden demise following that. The Joker has gone on to become the stuff of pop-culture legends for the 21st century, and Ledger quite deservedly, won a posthumous Academy Award for his performance. There has been so much talk about his ‘method’ of locking himself up in a motel room for six weeks to the point of nausea. And that’s one of this documentary’s biggest wins as his friends and family don’t shroud it with any more mystery. In fact, his dialect coach demystifies the process as not nearly as strenuous as popular belief. He mentions how Ledger was having ‘fun’ on the sets pushing the limits of what was ‘respectable for a hardworking actor’.\n\nAll the talk about Ledger shooting the hostage videos himself, or doing his own makeup for the role barely comes up. That’s because the Joker was only one of Ledger’s achievements as an actor, and the objective of this documentary was to give more of an insight into the man. And it does that with a great degree of success. Made out of Ledger’s own footage (he was obsessed with cameras) and a series of interviews of family, friends and colleagues, we hear concurrent portraits of a man in great haste.\n\nHis life was a rolling ball structure, where there was no stopping. He was either travelling, reading film scripts, shooting, using the turn-tables to mix tracks, singing with people, or showing up at his agent’s place for breakfast uninvited to discuss this ‘brilliant idea’ he had late at night. This boy was exploding with energy. There’s a scene where we see him use his handycam to shoot himself spinning round and round, like Cobb’s totem in a dream. His fascination with the mundane. A former partner even mentions how he was obsessed with documenting his life, and capturing people in their element.\n\nWhich doesn’t mean he was always up and bright on all days. His best friend Justin Veron recounts days when he felt absolutely out of place sharing the frame with Mel Gibson on the sets of The Patriot. Overawed with the publicity material of A Knight’s Tale, Ledger excused himself from a marketing meeting and sat down in the loo breathing heavily. He so badly wanted to be known as an actor, and when a film tried to leverage his 10 Things I Hate About You fame he wasn’t sure if the fame was worth it, his friend and agent both recount.\n\nLedger gave with abandon. His musician friend Ben Harper has just come back home after spending an all-nighter at his place, jamming on the piano. And he wakes up to find delivery folk waiting outside his house with a grand piano for Mr Harper, signed Heath Ledger. Overwhelmed by the gesture, he calls up the ‘Hollywood star’ who makes the most humble request of him. He asks Harper to write a lullaby for his daughter. Many accounts suggest he was rooted even after he found fame – like the one time where he took his childhood friend to a ‘party’ where the host turned out to be Naomi Campbell. Ledger just smiled cheekily as his friend fumbled in front of his super-famous host.\n\nHe spent nearly every second of his life creating, or thinking about creating. Which we see in the way when he *volunteers* to direct a video for Ben Harper’s song Morning Yearning. Harper is hardly surprised how Ledger drove the shoot like a one-man army, shouting out the aperture for the next shot to capture those perfect silhouettes. Harper says ‘it was all in his head and it was much bigger than a music video’ as he cut between close-ups of a cello, Harper mouthing the words and a contemporary dancer spinning against a bright light source. The flair is for everyone to see, suggesting the actor was testing waters for his next stage to create.\n\nThe only grouse I had with the documentary was probably its length. At a running time of only an hour, one does get the sense that the documentary could have explored its subject with more depth. His troubles with his sleep medication and how that affected his relationship with Michelle is mentioned in passing.\n\nBut maybe no one really knows what was going through his head, as he fought his inner demons and channelled them into his most unforgettable character. Maybe he was equally unprepared to write the epilogue of a life, lived with such ferocity and uninhibitedness. We can hardly miss his burning passion for the Arts, and maybe that’s our lesson from this short but significant life."
