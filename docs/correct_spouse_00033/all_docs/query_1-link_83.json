        "text": "Publish date: 2024-06-07\n\nSince the beginning of her career, all eyes have been on Michelle Williamsâ love life.\n\nThe Oscar nomineeâs first known celebrity relationship began in 1993, the same year she made her TV debut in an episode of Baywatch. She embarked on a relationship with her costar Jeremy Jackson after meeting on set, but they managed to keep the news under wraps for nearly two decades. Jackson finally spilled the beans in a 2011 interview with Howard Stern, calling Williams his âfirst crush.â\n\nWilliams went on to find true love in 2004 with Heath Ledger, who played her husband in the critically acclaimed romantic drama Brokeback Mountain. They welcomed a daughter, Matilda, in 2005 and broke up two years later. Ledger died from an accidental drug overdose in 2008.\n\nâI never gave up on love,â the actress told Vanity Fair in 2018 while reflecting on life after the Dark Knight starâs death. âI always say to Matilda, âYour dad loved me before anybody thought I was talented, or pretty, or had nice clothes.ââ\n\nWilliams decided to give love another try six months after losing Ledger. She started dating Spike Jonze in 2008, but their relationship ended up being short-lived.\n\nâThe timing was impossible,â she admitted to Vogue in 2009. âI thought falling in love again was the only thing that was going to save me from the pain. This erroneous idea: It just makes things more complicated.â\n\nThank You!\n\nYou have successfully subscribed.\n\nAfter being single for a few years, the Dawsonâs Creek alum had high-profile relationships with Cary Joji Fukunaga, Jason Segel, Dustin Yellin, Jonathan Safran Foer and Andrew Youmans. Then, in 2018, she secretly married Phil Elverum. Their union ended less than a year later, and Williams was engaged to Thomas Kail within a matter of months. She and the director are now married and expecting their first child together.\n\nScroll down to see a complete timeline of Williamsâ dating history.\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuqqvx56jpZ1drLatuMiapKxllJbBqrrGZp%2Biq6Skv7p5x56YraBdobKls8SrZK2gn6KutHnKmqClZZ2kv6Z7"
