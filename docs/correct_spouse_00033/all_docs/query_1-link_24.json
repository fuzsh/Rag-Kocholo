        "text": "“When you’re a single parent, and that element of provider and protection is missing, it’s scary.”\n\nBy Brandon Charles\n\nApr. 3 2024, Updated 1:52 p.m. ET\n\nBelieve it or not, Matilda Rose Ledger, the daughter of award winning actors Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams, is now a legal adult. When her father Heath passed away in 2008, she was only two-years-old.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nYou may not know the co-stars of Brokeback Mountain even had a kid. Though their relationship was tabloid fodder for the duration of their union, both performers did their best to keep their daughter out of the spotlight. That heightened after Heath’s death.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nMatilda Ledger is not a nepo baby.\n\nMother Michelle has kept daughter Matilda out of the spotlight. In a July 2017 cover story with Vanity Fair, the actress said, “When you’re a single parent, and that element of provider and protection is missing, it’s scary.”\n\nMichelle also spoke about the importance of keeping Matilda’s day-to-day life consistent, something most every parent can understand. When Michlle and Matilda moved back to Brooklyn for the school years after spending the six years following Heath’s death in upstate New York, the actress said, “She hasn’t had her routine disrupted and hasn’t missed class.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nMatilda had a father figure in 'Succession’s' Jeremy Strong.\n\nIn a May 10, 2022 cover story in Variety, Michelle spoke about how important actor Jeremy Strong was in Matilda’s life. The two actors became friends in 2004 and Jeremy moved in, along with Michelle’s sister and another friend, after Heath’s passing.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nMichelle told the magazine, “Jeremy was serious enough to hold the weight of a child’s broken heart and sensitive enough to understand how to approach her through play and games and silliness. [Matilda] didn’t grow up with her father, but she grew up with her Jeremy and we were changed by his ability to play as though his life depended upon it, because hers did.”\n\nWhile support is good, it doesn't make up for missing a father. In the Winter 2016 cover story for Porter, Michelle said, \"In all honesty, for pretty much everything else, I feel like I’m a believer in not fighting circumstances, accepting where you are and where you’ve been. In pretty much all senses but one, I would be able to go totally down that line of thinking were it not for Matilda not having her dad. You know, that’s just something that doesn’t… I mean, it just won’t ever be right.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nMatilda recently turned 18-years-old.\n\nAccording to New Idea, Matilda spent her 18th birthday in a familiar place, in rural upstate New York with mom and friends. Michelle moved them there soon after Heath’s passing.\n\nThe Australian weekly magazine also points out that now that Matilda is 18, she’s the legal owner of the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award Heath won posthumously his performance in The Dark Knight. The statuette has been on display at the Western Australian Museum in Perth.\n\nMatilda is now an older sister.\n\nMatilda's mom married theater and television director and television executive producer Thomas Kail in 2020. They met in 2018 while working on Fosse/Verdon, her acting and him directing and producing. They've also produced two children, Hart in 2020 and a sibling in 2022."
