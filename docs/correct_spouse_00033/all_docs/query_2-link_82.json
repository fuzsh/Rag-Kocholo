        "text": "Young Hollywood couple (and \"Brokeback Mountain\" co-stars) Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams have welcomed their first bundle of joy: a baby daughter named Matilda, according to reports. The pair began dating on the set of \"Mountain\" while working as on-screen husband and wife in the Ang Lee-directed cowboy romance due out next month. While mommy Williams enjoys some post-natal bonding time with the little one, Ledger will be busy premiering his period rom-com \"Casanova\" (November 30) one week before the highly anticipated \"Mountain\" debuts December 9."
