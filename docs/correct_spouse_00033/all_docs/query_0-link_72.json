        "text": "Michelle Williams' 17-year-old daughter, Matilda, is growing up fast and her life away from the spotlight has helped keep her grounded.\n\nThe star - who had her firstborn with the late star, Heath Ledger - moved to a farmhouse after the Australian star's tragic death when Matilda was only two. For six years, they called the retreat in upstate New York, their home.\n\nIn 2016, the Dawson's Creek actress told the New York Post: \"We moved - we left Brooklyn and lived in the country for six years because it was an intolerable state of existence.\"\n\nWATCH: Michelle Williams reveals what her daughter thinks of her movies\n\nAt the time of Heath's death from an accidental overdose, the couple weren't romantically involved but were co-parenting Matilda in Brooklyn.\n\nMichelle has also praised her good friend, Succussion star, Jeremy Strong, for helping them through the difficult time as he moved in with them.\n\nMORE: NCIS star Wilmer Valderrama say he can't leave home without special message from daughter\n\nTRENDING NOW: NCIS confirms return of well-loved character - and fans are excited\n\n\"Jeremy was serious enough to hold the weight of a child’s broken heart and sensitive enough to understand how to approach her through play and games and silliness,\" she told Fosse/Verdon.\n\nMichelle and Heath were co-parenting Matilda before his untimely death\n\n\"[Matilda] didn’t grow up with her father, but she grew up with her Jeremy and we were changed by his ability to play as though his life depended upon it, because hers did.\"\n\nMichelle is now married to theatre director Thomas Kail and they have two other children.\n\nPOPULAR: Chrissy Teigen shares candid photo of motherhood struggle days after giving birth\n\nThe family live in New York City and Matilda bares a striking resemblance to her father.\n\nHeath's father says Matilda is a lot like him\n\nShe's adopted many of his personality traits too, and Heath's father, Kim, opened up about this in an interview with Channel Ten's The Project.\n\n\"She's got an enormous number of his mannerisms,\" he said. \"She's very inquisitive, she's got his energy, cause Heath never slept from when he was two and Matilda's like that.\n\n\"I mean, she's just got this ball of energy and she radiates this little aura, Heath was kind of like that. So it's fabulous really.\"\n\nHe also praised Michelle's parenting and added: \"Michelle's been brilliant. She's kept Heath very much alive in her daughter's eyes. She's always full of questions, always wanting to know this or that about her dad.\n\n\"And I guess that will just get more intense as she gets older and obviously we would welcome that.\"\n\nRead more HELLO!
