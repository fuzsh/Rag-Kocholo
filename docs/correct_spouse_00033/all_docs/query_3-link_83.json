        "text": "\"The romantic idea of meeting your person and having a storybook family life that looks like the model you grew up with - that doesn't really exist for me.\"\n\nThis month marks nine years since the tragic passing of actor Heath Ledger, who lived with partner of three years Michelle Williams and their daughter Matilda in Brooklyn.\n\nAnd now Michelle has spoken candidly about life as a single parent after losing Heath.\n\nShe told WSJ, \"It's hard to romanticise romance when you're 36. When you've been a parent for 11 years and you've done it alone, you don't have romantic ideals, because you have a practical understanding that you can do it by yourself.”\n\nShe continued: \"The romantic idea of meeting your person and having a storybook family life that looks like the model you grew up with - that doesn't really exist for me.\"\n\nThe actress also opened up about her heartbreak after leaving the Brooklyn home the family once shared.\n\n\"At that time, I was inconsolable, because I felt, 'How will he be able to find us?’ This is where we lived, and he won't know where we are. And now I can't believe I thought that,\" she admitted.\n\nMichelle has received Oscar, Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations for her latest role in critically acclaimed film, Manchester by the Sea.\n\nREAD MORE: Michelle Williams Speaks Candidly About Life Without Heath"
