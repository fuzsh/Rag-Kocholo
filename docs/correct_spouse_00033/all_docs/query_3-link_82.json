        "text": "Actress Michelle Williams has revealed that Succession star Jeremy Strong helped her and her daughter Matilda get over the loss of former partner Heath Ledger, who tragically died in 2008.\n\nMichelle and Heath started dating in 2004 and a year later they had Matilda – but The Dark Knight actor passed away three years later at the age of 28 and after his and Michelle's relationship cooled in 2007.\n\nMichelle's friend Jeremy, along with her sister, moved in and helped care for her and Matilda, with the 41-year-old Oscar nominee paying tribute to his compassionate approach to her daughter.\n\nMichelle told Variety: “Jeremy was serious enough to hold the weight of a child’s broken heart and sensitive enough to understand how to approach her through play and games and silliness.\n\n“Matilda didn’t grow up with her father, but she grew up with her Jeremy. We were changed by his ability to play as though his life depended upon it, because hers did.”\n\nMichelle met Ledger on the set of Brokeback Mountain, with co-star Jake Gyllenhaal becoming Matilda’s godfather, and Dawson’ Creek actress Busy Philipps serving as her godmother.\n\nMichelle and Heath were also in the Bob Dylan biopic I’m Not There, although they never shared any scenes together.\n\nHeath died shortly before the release of The Dark Knight, in which he played The Joker, that earned him many plaudits as well as a posthumous Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nJeremy, who earned the Screen Actors Guild Award for his role in 2020 film The Trial of the Chicago 7, was also praised by Michelle for his acting skills, following the release of a controversial New Yorker profile.\n\nIn it, it detailed his rise to stardom, looking at how he has developed his extreme ‘Method acting’.\n\nMichelle argued: “We’ve all been in awe of his talent.\n\n“We’ve watched him work harder than anyone and wait a long time for other people to recognise it, so when he became so celebrated, we all celebrated.”\n\nMichelle is now married to theatre director Thomas Kail – they secretly wed in March 2020 and she recently revealed they are expecting their second child together, following the arrival of son Hart in the summer of that year.\n\n“It’s totally joyous,” she explained: “As the years go on, you sort of wonder what they might hold for you, or not hold for you.\n\n“It’s exciting to discover that something you want again and again, is available one more time. That good fortune is not lost on me or my family.”\n\nDo you have a story to sell? Get in touch with us atwebcelebs@mirror.co.ukor call us direct 0207 29 33033."
