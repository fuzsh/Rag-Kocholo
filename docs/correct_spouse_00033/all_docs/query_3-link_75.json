        "text": "Be it people in general or well-renowned celebrities — everyone has some secrets that they keep to themselves until the very end, with some even taking those secrets down to their graves. Being no exception to this fact, the late legendary method actor Heath Ledger had some secrets of himself as well. However, one of his secrets was in the latter category where he took the secret to his grave.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis one secret was the fact that a little time before his untimely death due to a drug overdose, Ledger was involved in a relationship with none other than one of Avengers: Age of Ultron actress Elizabeth Olsen’s sisters. And while the reason why this was kept secret remains unknown to this day, it did cause some consequences for the one Heath Ledger was dating after his sudden demise.\n\nHeath Ledger Was Reportedly Dating Elizabeth Olsen’s Sister Before His Death\n\nThroughout his lifetime, Heath Ledger was linked to multiple women, in reports that cited him to be in a relationship with them. This list notably included Michelle Williams, Lisa Zane, Christina Cauchi, Heather Graham, and Naomi Watts, all of whose relationships with the late star were made public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, there was still one person that The Dark Knight actor was allegedly involved in an intimate relationship with, though this person didn’t quite make it to the news headlines while linked with Ledger during the time he was alive.\n\nThis person was none other than Marvel’s renowned WandaVison actress Elizabeth Olsen‘s elder sister, Mary-Kate Olsen. According to reports, the pair were together for more than just some time, and were reportedly linked by their love for “partying.” As per what an insider reported to People:\n\n“Mary-Kate and Heath were casually dating for three months before Heath’s death. They were hooking up, but neither were particularly interested in making it exclusive. They had a bond that was based on partying, and they had the same tastes in partying … like, in terms of where they liked to hang out in New York, what time they would want to go out. They just had the same sensibility.”\n\nThe pair was notably first seen over the summer of 2006 getting lunch together with a couple of friends during the time that Ledger was staying at the Chateau Marmont in Hollywood. An eyewitness of this incident even claimed: “Mary-Kate made him laugh a lot.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese reports of the late actor and the former actress seeing each other were further solidified after Heath Ledger‘s sudden devastating demise in 2008; a circumstance that led to the prying into his personal life, resulting in this secret making its way to the public to not remain a secret anymore.\n\nHowever, a lot more was put at risk because of the investigation into Ledger’s life, a major part of which involved Mary-Kate Olsen being a suspect of aiding in the late legend‘s death.\n\nMary-Kate Olsen Denied Supplying Drugs to Heath Ledger\n\nThe secret about Olsen and Ledger allegedly being in a relationship before his death was only further fueled by reports surfacing that Olsen had received 2 phone calls from masseuse Diana Wolozin on the same day that Wolozin discovered Ledger unconscious in his home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to reports (via People), this happened because Wolozin used the speed dial on Ledger’s number to call for an emergency, which led to the calling of the former actress. Answering, Olsen was alleged to have told Wolozin that she would call her security people in New York to help.\n\nMoreover, all these events also led to Mary-Kate Olsen getting suspected of having provided drugs to Heath Ledger which led to him getting an accidental drug overdose because both the pair reportedly smoked Marlboro Reds, as per the eyewitness.\n\nFurther adding fuel to this already raging fire of inspection was Olsen allegedly seeking immunity from prosecution before cooperating with the investigation for Ledger’s death case, as per what the police confirmed to the Associated Press (via The Guardian).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Olsen refuted all these claims through a statement issued by her lawyers which stated: “[Mary-Kate Olsen] had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in Heath Ledger’s home or his body, and she does not know where he obtained them.”\n\nBut Heath Ledger was long gone by then and had taken all these untold secrets with him to the grave, resulting in the case eventually getting dropped."
