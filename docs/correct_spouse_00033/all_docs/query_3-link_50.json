        "text": "Michelle Williams will not allow for any Jeremy Strong slander—personally or professionally. In a recent Variety cover, the Oscar nominee praised her longtime friend and defended his method-acting technique after a divisive New Yorker profile in which Strong said he takes the role of Succession’s Kendall Roy “as seriously” as his own life.\n\nWilliams, who met Strong while performing at the 2004 Williamstown Theatre Festival, said it was challenging to read Michael Schulman’s piece, which became an immediate lightning rod. She’s one of multiple celebrities to come out in defense of Strong after the article was published last December, including Jessica Chastain, Aaron Sorkin, and Anne Hathaway. “We’ve all been in awe of his talent,” Williams told Variety. “We’ve watched him work harder than anyone and wait a long time for other people to recognize it. So when he became so celebrated, we all celebrated.”\n\nBut the bond between Strong and Williams goes beyond professional admiration. Strong lived in Williams’s Boerum Hill townhouse rent-free for a time after the death of Heath Ledger, Williams’s ex and the father of her daughter Matilda. “There was an emptiness in the house,” Williams previously told The New Yorker. “So people moved in.” She also told the outlet that Strong lived in the basement near her great-grandmother’s piano. “He had this little bed and stacks and stacks of books about Lincoln,” Williams said.\n\nWhile there, Strong would spend hours playing with Matilda and giving her pony rides. “Jeremy was serious enough to hold the weight of a child’s broken heart and sensitive enough to understand how to approach her through play and games and silliness,” Williams said to Variety. She even suggested that Strong was a parental-like figure for her daughter, adding, “[Matilda] didn’t grow up with her father, but she grew up with her Jeremy and we were changed by his ability to play as though his life depended upon it, because hers did.”\n\nIn the article, Williams revealed that she is now expecting her second child with director Thomas Kail, with whom she shares a two-year-old son, Hart.\n\nMovies\n\nThe 25 Best Movies on Netflix to Stream Right Now\n\nFrom comedy classics to recent Oscar winners, these are the titles you don’t want to miss.\n\nMovies\n\nWhen You’re 23 and Spielberg Calls: The Wild Origin Story of Jon M.
