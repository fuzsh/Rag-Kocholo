I’ve had to get down on my hands and knees and sift through the muck and mud, and try to find little pearls, little nuggets of things that make sense.”\n\nThe 30-year-old actress – who dated 41-year-old director Spike Jonze for over a year until September 2009 – feels love is always with her, and though she would like to be dating, she insists she is comfortable being single.\n\nShe said in an interview with The Times newspaper: “When you’ve had love, you always, in a way, have it.\n\n“I am single but either is fine with me. I’m used to being single. Would I like to be with someone? Yes I would.”\n\nMichelle sought solace in her work following the death of Heath, who passed away from an accidental prescription drugs overdose aged 28 in January 2008.\n\nShe explained: “I feel like I’ve always had work, that’s been the place I can go, sometimes physically just to get out of the house and also emotionally.”"
