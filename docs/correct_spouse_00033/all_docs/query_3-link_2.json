        "text": "The late Heath Ledger met his fiancée Michelle Williams on the set of Brokeback Mountain in 2004 and the short-lived pair soon became inseparable.\n\n\"Our initial meeting, the circumstances of how we first met, were cosmic or something,\" Michelle would later recall in a GQ interview.\n\nHowever, the chemistry between the two was undeniable, even to those around. Co-star Jake Gyllenhaal confessed: \"I remember being in rehearsal, and the two of them had googly eyes with each other.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Rod Stewart's brief split from wife inspired sad song\n\nWhilst the couple seemingly liked one another from afar, it was a minor accident on set that brought them closer together.\n\nBrokeback Mountain screenwriter Diana Ossana told Out that during the toboggan scene in the movie, Williams had injured herself and was crying at the bottom of the hill in pain.\n\n\"She'd twisted her knee, and we had to call someone to take her to the hospital. Heath was not about to let her go alone, and as he was getting into the vehicle with her he was smoothing her hair back,\" Ossana recalled.\n\n\"I remember him looking at her, and she looking up at him with these wide eyes. She was almost startled by the attention he was giving her, but you could see it every day from thereon. For him it was truly love at first sight. He was so taken with her.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Inside U2's Bono and Ali Hewson's 40-year marriage\n\nLess than just a year after meeting one another, the couple announced they were expecting a baby girl. At the time, Williams said in an interview with People that Brokeback Mountain had a whole new, sentimental meaning to her.\n\n\"I met my husband there, the seed of my daughter was born there. It's just really, really powerful… Heath and I were just talking about this the other night that if it hadn't been there we would have met some other way, some other way. It was going to happen.\"\n\nREAD MORE: How Jimmy Stewart, Hollywood's 'most recognisable face', met his true love Gloria McLean\n\nThe couple welcomed their daughter Matilda Rose in October 2005. Her godparents are Gyllenhaal and Michelle's best friend and former Dawson's Creek co-star Busy Phillips.\n\nREAD MORE: Love Stories: Christy Turlington has 'no memory' of her first encounter with husband Ed Burns\n\nShortly after the birth of his daughter, Ledger proudly declared himself as the \"manny\" when Williams was busy working. He also added that his family was \"everything\" to him and \"the most important thing\" he does.\n\nHowever, by 2007, the pair's relationship had deteriorated as Ledger had begun to struggle with drug abuse. They ultimately split just four months before the iconic actor passed away from an overdose.\n\nYears later, Busy Phillips would reflect on the demise of Ledger and her friend's relationship in her memoir.\n\n\"I felt sad for both of them, but weirdly, like something would be figured out and it wasn't the end of the story for them,\" she wrote. \"They were so young and that baby was the light of both of their lives. They were just working all the time and it was complicated.\"\n\nIn the weeks following Ledger's death, Williams sought refuge in upstate New York with her daughter Matilda Rose away from the prying eyes of the paparazzi.\n\nREAD MORE: Love Stories: Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld's decades-long romance had a controversial beginning\n\nYears later, Williams mostly remains quiet on her short-lived romance with Ledger, but from time to time the actress will speak on her bitter-sweet memories with the 10 Things I Hate About You star.\n\nSpeaking to The Daily Beast in 2011, she said:\n\n\"I experienced a lot of loss after his death. I lost my city because of all the paparazzi descending upon us. I actually lost my journal during that time, oddly enough. I literally couldn't hold onto anything. It felt as if things were literally slipping through my fingers. Things were just streaming away from me. I lost my sense of humour. I'm still looking for that.\"\n\nIn March 2020, Williams married director Thomas Kail. She gave birth to their son, Hart, later that year and recently just gave birth to her second child with the director.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here"
