        "text": "Australian actor Heath Ledger tragically died in New York in 2008, at the age of 28, from an accidental overdose.\n\nAt the time of his death, which sent shockwaves all over the world, Ledger had just finished filming his critically-acclaimed portrayal of the Joker in the 2008 film The Dark Knight.\n\nHe would later earn a Best Supporting Actor Oscar posthumously for the role.\n\nIn his short lifetime, Ledger forged a successful Hollywood career, winning the hearts of millions fans all over the world thanks to films including 10 Things I Hate About You and A Knights Tale.\n\nREAD MORE: Director recalls 'really sad' moment he heard Ledger had died\n\nThe late Perth-born star also captured the hearts of some high-profile love interests during his time, dating Aussie model Gemma Ward shortly before his death and having daughter Matilda with ex Michelle Williams.\n\nIn an interview before his death, Ledger sweetly said Williams and his daughter were ''the greatest gift\" he had ever received in life.\n\n9Honey Celebrity takes a look back at the great loves of Heath Ledger's life in the week in honour of what would have been his 45th birthday on April 4.\n\nHeather Graham\n\nLedger dated American actress Heather Graham from October 2000 to June 2001.\n\nAlthough their romance was short-lived, it seemingly meant a lot to Graham, who shared a sweet tribute to her former lover in 2021.\n\nREAD MORE: What happened to Heather Graham?\n\nUnderneath some throwback photographs of the pair together, she said that Ledger was \"such a special person\".\n\n\"Going through my photos I found these.

You could look into them, and they would tell a thousand stories in one glance,\" she said.\n\n\"There was a wonderful mixture of power and fragility at work in everything he did, which just pulls you in.\n\n\"His strength didn't scare you. It intrigued you. And his fragility touched you.\"\n\nThe cast of 10 Things I Hate About You: Then and now\n\nMichelle Williams\n\nThe Dark Knight actor's struggle with depression and inability to cope with the pressures of fame cast a shadow over his successful career. But after he welcomed his baby girl, Ledger had a new light in his life.\n\nIt was his casting in the 2005 Oscar-winning film Brokeback Mountain as Ennis Del Mar that saw Ledger meet and fall in love with his co-star, Williams.\n\nThe couple met on-set in 2004 and immediately began a whirlwind romance.\n\nREAD MORE: How Isla Fisher went from Home and Away to Hollywood\n\n\"Our initial meeting, the circumstances of how we first met, were cosmic or something,\" Williams would later recall in a GQ interview.\n\n\"It will be forever special because of meeting Heath and having Matilda,\" she told The Sydney Morning Herald in 2008.\n\n\"It is probably not often in your lifetime that you are part of a film that means so much to so many people.\"\n\nIn October 2005, Matilda Ledger was born.\n\n\"I'm so proud. I just fall deeper and deeper in love with both my girls,\" People reports him as saying soon after her birth.\n\nREAD MORE: Julia Roberts' dating history\n\nSpeaking to The Sydney Morning Herald in 2006, Ledger also acknowledged how much his role in Brokeback Mountain changed the trajectory of his personal life.\n\n\"It's a trip. It's incredible to what level the film has changed my life,\" he said.\n\n\"I mean, it's given me an incredible amount of synchronicity. I have these two girls that I fall deeper and deeper in love with daily and that is, hands down, the greatest gift that I've been given from this. I'll forever be grateful.\"\n\nThough it wasn't to last, as in 2007 the couple split after three years together.\n\nREAD MORE: Why Michelle Williams' and Heath Ledger's romance ended\n\nGemma Ward\n\nLedger's last love was Aussie supermodel Gemma Ward.\n\nThe pair started dating in late 2007 and spent Christmas together in their hometown of Perth with their families.\n\n\"[Heath and I] first met in New York and we were both struggling with things that I won't get into, and we bonded over that,\" she previously told The Sunday Herald Sun.\n\n\"I kind of met him at first and said, 'Listen, my mum's living with me right now and I'm kind of going through a hard time and I'm not interested in having a serious relationship with somebody right now' and he was like, 'You know, um, let's just be there for each other through these hard times we're both going through'.\n\n\"And we developed a relationship and we started seeing each other. There was no one like him - and no one will ever be like him.\"\n\nShe also previously told WHO in 2015: ''I try to reflect and send him some prayers.''\n\nWard retreated from the spotlight shortly after his death, but recently returned to her career and the public eye."
