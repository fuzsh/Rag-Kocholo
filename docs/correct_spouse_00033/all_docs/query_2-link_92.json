        "text": "The father of the late Heath Ledger is delighted to find out that Michelle Williams quietly tied the knot with musician partner Phil Elverum.\n\nThe 37-year-old actress revealed the news to Vanity Fair in an interview. She said that she ‘never gave up on love’ after the death of Heath Ledger.\n\nHer former father-in-law Kim, told The Sun-Herald that he – and the whole family – are happy for her.\n\nHe said: ‘We’re terribly happy. It is great.\n\n‘She’s very private and I don’t really like to make too many comments about her, but we are very happy [for her].’\n\nHe added that, though he didn’t attend the ceremony, he would love to meet the actress’ husband.\n\nThe Blue Valentine actress and Elverum decided on a small, secret ceremony in the Adirondacks Mountains in New York.\n\nOnly a ‘handful of friends’ were witness to the intimate event.\n\nBoth their daughters were also in attendance: 12-year-old Matilda, who Michelle had with Heath, and Elverum’s three-year-old daughter from his first marriage.\n\nWilliams, who is normally incredibly private and doesn’t tend to talk about her relationships, said the bond between them is ‘very sacred and very special.’\n\n‘I never gave up on love,’ she added. ‘I always say to Matilda, “Your dad loved me before anybody thought I was talented, or pretty, or had nice clothes”.\n\n‘Obviously I’ve never once in my life talked about a relationship. But Phil isn’t anyone else. And that’s worth something.\n\n‘Ultimately the way he loves me is the way I want to live my life as a whole. I work to be free inside of the moment. I parent to let Matilda feel free to be herself, and I am finally loved by someone who makes me feel free.’\n\nThe musician, who was once a member of The Microphones and Mount Eerie, was married to Canadian musician Geneviève Castrée for 13 years before she died from pancreatic cancer in 2016.\n\nMORE : Michelle Williams tells daughter Matilda ‘your dad loved me before anyone thought I was pretty’"
