        "text": "The fiercely private Michelle Williams opened up about Hollywood’sÂ ongoing pay disparity, how her life and career changed in the aftermath of her former partner Heath Ledger ’s death and her secret marriage toÂ Phil Elverum .\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair magazine , the Oscar-nominated star of Brokeback Mountain discussed Hollywood’s gender pay gap. Williams and her All the Money in the World co-starÂ Wahlberg made news earlier this year when it was revealed that he was paid $1.5 million for reshoots on movieÂ whileÂ she got $1,000.Â Wahlberg later donated his salary Â to Timeâs Up, the campaign against workplace sexual misconduct. She says she felt “totally devalued” after the incident but she learnt to swallow it.Â âA private humiliation became a public turning point,â she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n( Also read â Michelle Williams, Sam Rockwell to get equal pay for FX series after All The Money In The World controversy )\n\nThe 37-year-old actressÂ married the American indie musician Elverum at a private ceremony earlier this month in the rural Adirondacks region of upstate New York.Â She described her relationship with Elverum, whose first wife died of pancreatic cancer, as âvery sacred, very special.â\n\nWilliams had a daughter, Matilda, with Ledger but the couple ended their three-year romance a few months before his 2008 death at age 28 of an accidental prescription drugs overdose.Â She says she never gave up on love after Ledger’s death 10 years ago. âI always say to Matilda, âYour dad loved me before anybody thought I was talented, or pretty, or had nice clothes.â Obviously Iâve never once in my life talked about a relationship but Phil isnât anyone else,â she told Vanity Fair .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams also spoke of how she and Matilda were hounded by media in the months after Ledgerâs death.Â âIâll never forget going to the post office and seeing a sign hung on the wall for anyone with information about myself and my daughter, to please call this number. Um, so I took that down,â sheÂ said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead the full interview here.\n\n(With inputs from Reuters)"
