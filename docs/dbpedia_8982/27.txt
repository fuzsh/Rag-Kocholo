The UEFA European Women’s Championship, also known as the UEFA Women’s Euro, is a quadrennial football tournament contested by the women’s national teams of the member nations of the UEFA confederation.

Founded in 1982, it is the equivalent of the UEFA European Championship.

Sweden pipped England on penalties following a two-legged tie to claim the inaugural edition of UEFA Women’s Euro in 1984.

The UEFA Women’s Euro started as a four-team event before it was increased to eight teams in 1997. Twelve teams participated in the 2009 edition and it was later expanded to 16 teams in 2017.

Since the inception of the tournament, Germany are the most successful team in the UEFA European Women’s Championship history. The German women’s national football team won the coveted trophy eight times in 1989, 1991, 1995, 1997, 2001, 2005, 2009 and 2013. Interestingly, Germany won six successive titles between 1995 and 2013.

Apart from Germany, Norway are the only side to win the title multiple times (1987 and 1993).

The Netherlands became the fourth different nation to claim the Women's Euro, as they beat Denmark 4-2 at De Grolsch Veste in Enschede, Netherlands in 2017.

Meanwhile, England are the defending champions of the UEFA European Women's Championship, having defeated Germany 2-1 in the 2022 final at the Wembley Stadium.

The victory made England coach Sarina Wiegman the first coach to win consecutive European Championship titles with two different countries, having led her country Netherlands to victory in the previous edition (2017).

Former German footballers Inka Grings and Birgit Prinz are the all-time top-scorers in the history of the tournament, having netted 10 goals each.

Italy’s Carolina Morace, Heidi Mohr of Germany and Sweden’s Lotta Schelin have scored eight goals each in UEFA Women’s Euros.
