        "text": "ESPN broadcast the Champions League from 1995-2009, usually putting the games on ESPN2. The first final I remember seeing was the Ajax-Juventus final in '96, which I guess would be the first one if their coverage began with the 95-96 season.\n\nAs for Serie A, I recall seeing a Serie A highlight show on the local cable sports network in Chicago (at the time SportsChannel Chicago -- which begat Fox Sports Net Chicago which begat ComCast SportsNet Chicago) back in '95-96 - seemingly produced in England. But I also recall watching the RAI broadcasts of Serie A games and the \"90 Minuto\" highlights program in Italian on an independent over-the-air channel in New York (Channel 25), as well as on cable in Chicago (can't remember which channel) on Sunday mornings at least as far back as 97-98. And I'm pretty sure they are still being shown in New York.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nPBS had the late great \"Soccer made in Germany\" for a bit over a decade (mid-70's-1987, IIRC) with Toby Charles (some excerpts can be found on YouTube).\n\nToby also provided the coverage under the same brand name of the Euro'80 and '84 and WC'82.\n\nAlso on PBS, Mario Machado announced the English First Division matches back in the late 70's-early 80's.\n\nWhen that was canceled, he tried to do the old Argentine (then, the reigning World Champions) league but to no avail.\n\nAll of those matches were edited down to about 52 minutes worth to fill in the 1hr time slot.\n\nUnivision, then with Tony Tirado on the mic, covered the Mexican league mostly but also did an occasional Champions Cup final (I remember coming home in the spring of 1985 and waiting for the Liverpool-Juventus match without being to understand what was going on in the stands in Heysel since I spoke no Spanish at the time whatsoever).\n\nUnivisio/Tirado also did the entire 1986 WC (and, from what I understand, the 1982 WC as well) live in Spanish. Tony did drop a few English words now and again. I believe he was either in Miami then or in San Antonio, observing matches in the studio.\n\nThen Univision hired Norberto Longo/Andres Cantor combo and they did Euro'88 (though, I am not sure if they did all matches but I do recall the USSR-Netherlands final) and WC'90. They were usually in a Miami studio, again working off a TV.\n\nTBS/TNT had the WC'90 and they did it live with Bob Neal and Mick Luckhurst, I believe, and with commercial interruptions during matches.\n\nIn the 80s to mid 90s RAI on Channel 31 in NYC would have one Serie A match on sunday mornings followed by 90 minuto highlights. Then on weekdays they would show The Old UEFA Champions cup,UEFA Cup and Cup-Winners-Cup matches involving Italian clubs. I remember seeing Maradonna and Napoli winning the UEFA Cup in 89. Also seeing Atalanta's historic run in the Cup-Winners-Cup vs Sporting Clube de Portugal in 87-88 while in Serie B. I used to love coming home from school and seeing Italian football on TV. It was a great time the era of Maradonna at Napoli.\n\nI used to get up early on Sunday mornings and watch a Serie A match in Italian from around 1990-1993. There was a public TV channel in Philly that picked up the RAI feed a similar channel in NYC was showing. They also showed a preview/highlights show late on Friday nights.\n\nESPN started to pick up champions league games around 1992-93 and they also showed a Bundesliga highlights show sporadically. After the World Cup in 1994, they started to show the CL more regularly and picked up the Dutch League. I also recall them showing the Monday night PL match on a delay Monday evenings on ESPN2 in 1997-98 or so.\n\nThat's what I wacthed, it was great!\n\nWow! That's was how I got hooked on Serie A action too in the late 80's. Living in the DC area, we would get those RAI broadcasts from that NYC channel via local over air channel here (56). As you mention, there were games on Sunday mornings, followed by 90' Minuto, then La Domenica Sportiva, and a bunch of other variety shows mixed with soccer personalities and hot chicks as presenters.\n\nAfter Dish got into the DBS business in 92, they carried RAI Int'l 24/7, and I was able to get my fix\n\nof Italian calcio there.\n\nI wonder if RAI knew all this time there were a bunch of non-Italians watching their programs.\n\ni remember watching both these on PBS in the 70's, and it seems to me there was also a Seria A highlight show on PBS around the same time.\n\nthe matches were obviously not live but in those pre-internet days you didn't need to worry about knowing the result already. even if you went to a specialized newstand to buy european newspapers they would also be days old...\n\nthe old ways were good ways."
