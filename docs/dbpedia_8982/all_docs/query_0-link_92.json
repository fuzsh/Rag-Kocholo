        "text": "Prop bet #1: Nikola Jokic Over 20.5 points\n\n-113\n\nWith all due respect to Bogdan Bogdanovic, Serbia doesn't have enough firepower to win if Nikola Jokic isn’t scoring.\n\nHe's averaging 19.3 points per game in the tournament and has cracked the 20-point plateau three times, including the tourney opener vs. USA, scoring 20 on 8-for-15 shooting. Jokic is coming off a 21-point, 14-rebound, 9-assist gem, bringing Serbia back from 24 down to beat the Aussies in overtime.\n\nThat’s the full Joker experience: a stat sheet filled like a bucket of water, with damage done everywhere.\n\nThe Americans will try to take one of those elements away, as they did in the previous matchup, holding him to just five rebounds.\n\nThey’re also likely more than happy to let him get his offensively while preventing his teammates from catching fire from his trademark table-setting. Jokic had a tourney-high 17 field-goal attempts against Australia and 15 against the Americans. He should easily move past that 20.5-point line if he's around that figure again.\n\nProp bet #2: Devin Booker Over 10.5 points\n\n-122\n\nDevin Booker has quietly been one of Team USA's constants. On a roster that seems to have an abundance of everything, Book has been the beneficiary of running the lanes and spotting up on the perimeter.\n\nHe led the USA in scoring with 18 in the quarterfinal demolition of Brazil and has gone for double digits in all but one game so far in Paris. Booker is shooting an impressive 17-for-30 from the field, including a dynamic 10-for-16 from 3-point range. He had 12 points in 26 minutes against Serbia in Group play, punctuated by a 4-for-5 night from downtown.\n\nWhile I don’t think he’s replicating that total, he should be able to squeeze 11 points out to hand you a win.\n\nProp bet #3: Stephen Curry Over 2.5 threes\n\n+108\n\nIn the regular season, how much money would you plop down on Steph freaking Curry to make three triples in a game at plus money?\n\nAlas, this Olympic experience has been a frustrating one for basketball’s best shooter. Curry has yet to find the range in Europe, shooting a disappointing 35.7% from the field, and a ghastly 5-for-20 from beyond the arc through four games.\n\nHowever, I refuse to believe that he doesn’t have one shining moment at the Olympics in store, and Serbia might be the best chance to uncork something special. Curry easily had his best scoring game against them in the tournament, scoring 11 points while going 3-for-7 from 3-point land.\n\nHe’s such a gravitational force that defenses still key in on him, even when he’s clearly off his game, making the playing surface quite spacious for the rest of the team to do damage.\n\nAnd while the Americans will still win if Steph stays cold, it’s more fun to bet him throwing daggers than bricks."
