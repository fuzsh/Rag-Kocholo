        "text": "CHICAGO (June 14, 2024) – Coming off an exhilarating 1-1 draw against fifth-ranked Brazil, U.S. Men’s National Team head coach Gregg Berhalter has selected the 26 players that will represent the USMNT at the 2024 Copa América being held June 20-July 14 in 14 venues across 13 cities in the United States.\n\nThe USMNT opens group play against Bolivia on Sunday, June 23 at AT&T Stadium in Dallas, then faces Panama on Thursday, June 27 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta and concludes on Monday, July 1 against Uruguay at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City. The tournament opens at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on Thursday, June 20, when defending World Cup and Copa América champion Argentina meets Canada.\n\nPer tournament rules, rosters must include a minimum of 23 players with a maximum of 26 total. Teams are required to submit their final rosters no later than June 15.\n\nAll 26 players that were named to the Copa América squad were included on the June training camp roster for the Summer Showdown, presented by Marriott Bonvoy, between the USA and Colombia, and the 2024 Allstate Continental Clásico pitting the United States against five-time World Cup champion Brazil. LAFC midfielder Timmy Tillman was the 27th player on the roster and has returned to his club.\n\nThis will be the second-youngest squad the USA has sent to five editions of the Copa América, behind only the 2007 team. Eighteen of the 26 players were on the 2022 FIFA World Cup roster, with nine players age 23 and younger.\n\nThe oldest tournament in international soccer, Copa América will feature some of the world's best teams and players. Concacaf and CONMEBOL have partnered to host the competition outside of South America for only the second time in tournament history, having previously held the hugely successful 2016 Copa América Centenario in the United States. The tournament will feature six teams from Concacaf and all 10 teams from CONMEBOL.\n\nGroup A: Argentina, Peru, Chile, Canada\n\nGroup B: Mexico, Ecuador, Venezuela, Jamaica\n\nGroup C: USA, Uruguay, Panama, Bolivia\n\nGroup D: Brazil, Colombia, Paraguay, Costa Rica\n\nDETAILED ROSTER BY POSITION (Club/Country; Caps/Goals)\n\nGOALKEEPERS (3): 18-Ethan Horvath (Cardiff City/WAL; 9), 25-Sean Johnson (Toronto FC/CAN; 13), 1-Matt Turner (Nottingham Forest/ENG; 41)\n\nDEFENDERS (9): 2-Cameron Carter-Vickers (Celtic/SCO; 17/0), 23-Kristoffer Lund (Palermo/ITA; 3/0), 24-Mark McKenzie (Genk/BEL; 13/0), 16-Shaq Moore (Nashville SC; 19/1), 13-Tim Ream (Fulham/ENG; 58/1), 3-Chris Richards (Crystal Palace/ENG; 18/1), 5-Antonee Robinson (Fulham/ENG; 43/4), 12-Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati; 29/3), 22-Joe Scally (Borussia Mönchengladbach/GER; 11/0)\n\nMIDFIELDERS (7): 4-Tyler Adams (Bournemouth/ENG; 39/2), 15-Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis/ESP; 13/0), 14-Luca de la Torre (Celta Vigo/ESP; 21/0), 8-Weston McKennie (Juventus/ITA; 53/11), 6-Yunus Musah (AC Milan; ITA; 37/0), 7-Gio Reyna (Nottingham Forest/ENG; 28/8), 17-Malik Tillman (PSV Eindhoven/NED; 11/0)\n\nFORWARDS (7): 11-Brenden Aaronson (Union Berlin/GER; 41/8), 20-Folarin Balogun (Monaco/FRA; 12/3), 9-Ricardo Pepi (PSV Eindhoven/NED; 25/10), 10-Christian Pulisic (AC Milan/ITA; 68/29), 26-Josh Sargent (Norwich City/ENG; 23/5), 21-Tim Weah (Juventus/ITA; 39/6), 19-Haji Wright (Coventry City/ENG; 10/4)\n\nUSA HISTORY IN COPA AMÉRICA\n\nThe U.S. has participated in Copa América four times since the tournament’s inception in 1916. After its inaugural appearance in 1993, the USA surprised the world with a 3-0 win against Argentina in the group stage in 1995 en route to a fourth-place finish, losing to Brazil in the semifinal. After not advancing from the group stage in 2007, the U.S. shone in the 2016 Copa América Centenario, again finishing fourth after falling to a No. 1-ranked Argentina team led by Lionel Messi in the semifinal.\n\nThe United States is one of six guest teams in the CONMEBOL confederation championship. No invitee from outside South America has ever won the tournament. Since 2011, only two of 12 have even reached the knockout rounds, with the USA and Mexico both advancing at the 2016 Copa America Centenario.\n\nCLUB ACHIEVEMENTS\n\nMany of the players are bringing the ‘Big Mo(mentum)” into camp following achievements at their clubs this season. Cameron Carter-Vickers (Celtic) and the duo of Ricardo Pepi and Malik Tillman (PSV) enter with league championship titles to their credit, while Weston McKennie and Tim Weah hoisted the Coppa Italia trophy with Juventus.\n\nMeantime, a total of nine players are currently on clubs who will participate in the 2024-25 UEFA Champions League: Folarin Balogun (Monaco), Cameron Carter-Vickers (Celtic), Weston McKennie and Tim Weah (Juventus), Yunus Musah and Christian Pulisic (AC Milan), Ricardo Pepi and Malik Tillman (PSV), and Gio Reyna who is set to return to Borussia Dortmund after a half-season loan spell with Nottingham Forest.\n\nTHE BUDDY SYSTEM\n\nThe roster features five sets of club teammates, all of which come from European sides: AC Milan (Musah, Pulisic), Fulham (Ream, A. Robinson), Juventus (McKennie, Weah), Nottingham Forest (Reyna, Turner) and PSV Eindhoven (Pepi, Tillman).\n\nThe PSV duo joined former U.S. Soccer Sporting Director Earnie Stewart in Eindhoven this summer, winning the Dutch Eredivisie title for the first time in six years and the 25th overall in team history.\n\nYunus Musah and Christian Pulisic have helped lift Milan to second in the league table as well as the Round of 16 of the Europa League. In Serie A, they are neck and neck with Weston McKennie and Tim Weah as Juventus sit just one point behind them in the standings.\n\nTim Ream and Antonee Robinson completed their fourth season as teammates at Craven Cottage. Matt Turner moved from Arsenal to Nottingham Forest and was joined in January by Gio Reyna, who came on loan from Borussia Dortmund.\n\nBACK IN THE MIX\n\nForward Josh Sargent is in the midst of his first camp appearance since the 2022 FIFA World Cup after injury forced him to withdraw from the Nations League Final camp in March. Sargent finished the season with 16 goals in 28 appearances for Norwich City.\n\nAdditionally, 2022 FIFA World Cup veterans Cameron Carter-Vickers, Luca de la Torre and Sean Johnson each made their first camp appearances of 2024 this month.\n\nVENUE HOPPING\n\nThe USMNT is no stranger to AT&T Stadium, bringing an unblemished 5-0-0 record back to Arlington. The first three games took place during the knockout rounds of the Gold Cup – two semifinals (2013, 2017) and a quarterfinal (2021) – and each time the U.S. went on to win the tournament. The USMNT has already played two matches there this year, using extra time to defeat Jamaica 3-1 in the Concacaf Nations League Semifinal, before another 2-0 victory against Mexico to claim its third-straight CNL crown. Overall, the United States is 13-1-4 in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area.\n\nHaving been chosen as the future home of U.S Soccer’s National Training Center, Atlanta will host the USMNT at Mercedes-Benz Stadium for the first time. This is only the second visit for the U.S. to the Peach State since 1977, having fallen 2-1 to Jamaica on July 22, 2015, at the Georgia Dome in the semifinal of the Gold Cup.\n\nThis will be just the second visit for the USMNT to GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo. The first was a big one, as the team faced Costa Rica in a final round World Cup Qualifier on April 25, 2001. A goal by two-time World Cup veteran and former USMNT assistant coach Josh Wolff led the U.S. to a 1-0 shutout in front of 37,319 fans. The only other appearance on the Missouri side of the city came in a World Cup qualifier in 1968, a 6-2 win against Bermuda at Municipal Stadium.\n\nROSTER NOTES"
