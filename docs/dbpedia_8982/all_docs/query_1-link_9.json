        "text": "Breakout candidate: Nicola Zalewski. There is no obvious candidate in the Poland squad but the young AS Roma wing-back is one to watch. Zalewski, born in Italy to Polish parents, will be tasked with being the team's creative outlet on the left flank.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: For starters, they are the lowest-ranked team in one of the hardest groups. No one will expect them to beat France or the Netherlands, although a win against Austria could be enough to reach the round of 16. However, this is a Poland side that finished third to Albania and Czechia in qualifying and needed penalties to beat Wales to book their spot in Germany. On top of that, it's not clear how long Lewandowski will be out or how fit he will be when he returns.\n\nRealistic chances at Euro 2024: A strong presence of Polish supporters is anticipated in Germany given the proximity of the two countries, but none of them will expect to stay for the duration. Their defence needs protecting -- as a 3-2 loss to Moldova showed in qualifying -- and even if Lewandowski was at his Bayern Munich best, and 100% fit, he would still need a better supply line. A last-16 appearance is likely to be as good as it could get for Poland. A group stage exit might be more realistic. -- Sam Marsden\n\nPortugal\n\nNickname: A Seleção (The Team)\n\nFIFA rank: 6\n\nEuro 2024 group: Group F\n\nManager: Roberto Martínez\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 11W-0D-2L\n\nGroup-stage fixtures: Czechia (Tuesday, 3 p.m. ET); Turkey (June 22, noon ET); Georgia (June 26, 3 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Euro 2024: +650\n\nCan't-miss star: Cristiano Ronaldo. Heard of him? The Euro 2016 winner, now 39, is preparing for his sixth European Championship. Nobody has played more Euro games (25), or scored more goals (14). And -- surrounded and supplied by Portugal's latest generation of attacking talent -- Ronaldo hasn't lost his eye for goal, scoring 10 times in nine qualifying games. It's always all about Ronaldo, whether you like it or not.\n\nBreakout candidate: Vitinha. The 24-year-old midfielder was Paris Saint-Germain's outstanding player this season, Mbappé aside, starring in their run to the Champions League semifinals, but still isn't a household name. Vitinha played a limited role for Portugal in qualifying, such is the competition in midfield, but started both friendlies this month alongside João Palhinha.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: This is Martínez's first major tournament with Portugal and his previous job with Belgium ended in disappointment, eliminated in the group stage at the 2022 World Cup. Martínez has so many good players to choose from -- Ronaldo, Bernardo Silva, Rafael Leão, João Félix, Diogo Jota, Pedro Neto and Gonçalo Ramos could all make a case for inclusion in attack -- but fitting them together won't be easy. And handling Ronaldo presents its own problems.\n\nRealistic chances at Euro 2024: Portugal boasted the best record of any nation in qualifying, winning all 10 of their games, scoring the most goals (36) and conceding the fewest (two). Beyond the goals, their attacking stats impressed across the board, with the most shots, shots on target, big chances created and touches in the opposition box. Their squad is one of the tournament's strongest, and if Martínez can find the right blend in his starting XI, and in particular, how to get the best out of Ronaldo, they could go all the way. Turkey, Czechia and Georgia present few problems in Group F. Anything less than the semifinals -- where they could face hosts Germany -- would be a failure. -- Kirkland\n\nRomania\n\nNickname: Tricolorii (The Tricolours)\n\nFIFA rank: 46\n\nEuro 2024 group: Group E\n\nManager: Edward Iordănescu\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 4W-7D-1L\n\nGroup-stage fixtures: Ukraine (Monday, 9 a.m. ET); Belgium (June 22, 3 p.m. ET); Slovakia (June 26, noon ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Euro 2024: +22500\n\nCan't-miss star: Nicolae Stanciu. The attacking midfielder is Romania's creative force and likely to occupy the No. 10 role for Iordănescu's team in Germany. He ended the club season having scored six goals and registered seven assists in 29 appearances for Saudi Pro League side Damac. The 31-year-old goes into the Euros with 14 goals in 70 appearances for Romania and will be crucial for their prospects.\n\nBreakout candidate: Ianis Hagi. You'll know the name, but can the 25-year-old come anywhere close to matching the feats of his father, Gheorghe, in a Romania shirt? Hagi senior was one of Europe's great players in the 1990s and the talisman of the country's memorable 1994 World Cup team. Ianis has had a less glamourous career, but he has enjoyed success with Rangers and had a productive season on loan at Alaves in LaLiga, so he will see Euro 2024 as his chance to break out of his father's huge shadow on the international stage.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: This will be Romania's first major tournament since Euro 2016, when they were eliminated at the group stage without winning a game. They also recorded no victories on their previous appearance at Euro 2008. Despite a proud history of producing top players in the 1980s and 1990s, Romania have struggled to re-create their golden era this century. Their success this time around is simply in having qualified for the tournament.\n\nRealistic chances at Euro 2024: Romania are unlikely to reach the latter stages, but they are in the weakest group, having landed in Group E alongside Belgium, Ukraine and Slovakia, so they will expect to challenge to qualify for the second round. The Romanians haven't won a game at a major tournament since beating England 3-2 at Euro 2000, so ending that winless streak and progressing to the round of 16 would be regarded as a success. And due to the quirk of the draw for the knockout stages, Romania would not face a group winner in the second round if they qualify as runners-up, with a pairing against the Group D runners-up. So they could yet take advantage of the draw and become a surprise team in Germany. -- Ogden\n\nScotland\n\nNickname: The Tartan Army\n\nFIFA rank: 39\n\nEuro 2024 group: Group A\n\nManager: Steve Clarke\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 4W-3D-5L\n\nGroup-stage fixtures: Germany (Friday, 3 p.m. ET); Switzerland (June 19, 3 p.m. ET); Hungary (June 23, 3 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Euro 2024: +10000\n\nCan't-miss star: Scott McTominay. The midfielder splits opinion among Manchester United fans but not with Scotland. McTominay got seven goals in qualifying, and any team coming up against Scotland in Germany will be wary of his threat in the penalty area. He had a mixed season at Old Trafford but still ended the campaign with 10 goals in all competitions.\n\nBreakout candidate: Billy Gilmour. The midfielder is already well known in the UK after spells at Chelsea and Brighton & Hove Albion, but Euro 2024 could catapult him to a different level. Still only 22 years old, he played 30 times in the Premier League for the Seagulls last season. He's technically excellent and comfortable on the ball under pressure, and a good tournament in Germany will have big clubs circling.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: Goals might be a problem, particularly after Queens Park Rangers striker Lyndon Dykes was ruled out of the tournament because of an injury picked up in training. Scotland beat Gibraltar 2-0 without him in a warm-up game but missed several chances. It led Clarke to hand a call-up to uncapped youngster Tommy Conway, the 21-year-old who scored eight goals for Championship side Bristol City last season and has three goals in seven games for Scotland's under-21s.\n\nRealistic chances at Euro 2024: Scotland have never qualified for the knockout rounds at a major tournament, and that will be the main aim this summer. Hosts Germany first up is a tough way to start, but their chances of getting out of Group A will be decided by their record against Hungary and Switzerland in the other two games. Both are tough but winnable fixtures. Finishing second in Group A would set up a potential last-16 clash against Italy or Spain, but there's also a chance that finishing third will be enough to earn a place in the knockouts. Anything beyond the group stage would be considered a success. -- Dawson\n\nSerbia\n\nNickname: Оrlovi (The Eagles)\n\nFIFA rank: 33\n\nEuro 2024 group: Group C\n\nManager: Dragan Stojković\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 5W-2D-5L\n\nGroup-stage fixtures: England (Sunday, 3 p.m. ET); Slovenia (June 20, 9 a.m. ET); Denmark (June 25, 3 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Euro 2024: +8000\n\nCan't-miss star: Aleksandar Mitrović. Whether he is on his own up front or partnered with Dusan Vlahović, the 29-year-old former Fulham striker now playing in Saudi Arabia at Al Hilal will be a nightmare for defenders: tall, strong, great in the air and a top finisher. If Mitrović gets the right service from his team, he will be a constant threat.\n\nBreakout candidate: Lazar Samardžić. The 22-year-old is the future of Serbian football. He enjoyed a great season with Udinese in Serie A, and a big move to a top club is on the cards this summer. Samardžić is a left-footed central midfielder with great technique, vision and creativity, but is also quite robust and good in the duels.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: Serbia seem to always be the underdogs who end up disappointing, typically boasting a talented squad full of top players from top clubs who often underachieve, like at the past two World Cups, where they were knocked out in the group stage. This is their first Euros as an independent country, so the expectations back home will be high, and history suggests this team might struggle to meet them.\n\nRealistic chances at Euro 2024: It is an interesting group for Stojković and his players. Their first game against England will be tough, but Denmark and Slovenia are next up and are two teams they could beat. Mitrović, Vlahović, Dusan Tadic and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic have had great seasons at club level and will be the four leaders of this team. They will reach the last 16, where they could face Germany if they finish second in their group, and that could be the end for them. If they find something a bit special, they could become one of the surprises of the tournament. But even then, the quarterfinals are likely as far as they'll go. -- Laurens\n\nSlovakia\n\nNickname: Sokoli (The Falcons)\n\nFIFA rank: 48\n\nEuro 2024 group: Group E\n\nManager: Francesco Calzona\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 8W-1D-3L\n\nGroup-stage fixtures: Belgium (Monday, noon ET); Ukraine (June 21, 9 a.m. ET); Romania (June 26, noon ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Euro 2024: +35000\n\nCan't-miss star: Milan Skriniar. The 29-year-old is the best player in this Slovakia team, which is all about the collective. The PSG centre-back is a rock in the back, making the most of his physique. He lacks pace, but Slovakia usually play quite deep anyway, and playing behind Napoli defensive midfielder Stanislav Lobotka, he is the leader of a team that is hard to play against and very solid.\n\nBreakout candidate: Tomás Suslov. The 22-year-old will start on the left wing in Calzona's 4-3-3 formation and be one of his team's primary threats. He had a good season with Hellas Verona in Serie A with three goals and five assists after arriving from Groningen last summer.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: Apart from Skriniar and Lobotka, this team lacks top talent. They have good players like Juraj Kucka, Dávid Hancko and Martin Dúbravka, but overall, there is not enough quality in the squad. Calzona is an unexperienced head coach with a defensive mindset, and while they will make it hard for the opposition and put up a fight in each of their games, it won't be enough.\n\nRealistic chances at Euro 2024: At least Slovakia got a bit lucky in the draw. Their group is formed of Belgium, who should top it, and Romania and Ukraine, who are of a similar level to Slovakia. As such, they have a chance to qualify for the last 16, but after that, it will be too hard for them. They will be a solid collective unit but don't have any X factors in their team to produce something special. -- Laurens\n\nSlovenia\n\nNickname: None\n\nFIFA rank: 57\n\nEuro 2024 group: Group C\n\nManager: Matjaž Kek\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 8W-3D-2L\n\nGroup-stage fixtures: Denmark (Sunday, noon ET); Serbia (June 20, 9 a.m. ET); England (June 25, 3 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Euro 2024: +30000\n\nCan't-miss star: Jan Oblak. The Atlético Madrid No. 1 has been one of the standout goalkeepers in Europe for a decade. A move away from the Spanish capital has never materialised because of doubts about his ability with his feet, but there are few better shot stoppers in the game, which could be useful in a tricky group.\n\nBreakout candidate: Benjamin Šeško. The RB Leipzig striker is in form and in demand. The 21-year-old has enjoyed a stellar first season in Germany, scoring in each of his side's final seven games of the Bundesliga campaign. Bigger clubs are already circling, and big performances at the Euros will only increase the interest.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: Beyond Oblak and Šeško, only two other players in the Slovenia squad play in one of Europe's Big Five leagues. Kek has done well to guide them to their second-ever appearance at the European Championship, and their first since 2000, but a first win at the event is a more realistic target than winning it all.\n\nRealistic chances at Euro 2024: Slovenia drew with Denmark at home in qualifying and lost away only narrowly, so will believe they can get a result against the Danes in their opening game. Likewise against Serbia in their second match. England might prove tougher, but with Oblak in goal and Šeško up front, they could find the results needed to reach the knockout rounds. They will look to play on their underdog tag. \"There were a lot of people who seemed to smile when they got Slovenia in the group,\" Kek said. \"They may come to regret that.\" -- Marsden\n\nSpain\n\nNickname: La Roja (The Reds)\n\nFIFA rank: 8\n\nEuro 2024 group: Group B\n\nManager: Luis de la Fuente\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 10W-1D-1L\n\nGroup-stage fixtures: Croatia (Saturday, noon ET); Italy (June 20, 3 p.m. ET); Albania (June 24, 3 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Euro 2024: +700\n\nCan't-miss star: Rodri -- The Manchester City midfielder is genuinely world class. Club coach Pep Guardiola has described him as the best in the world in his position, and he will anchor La Roja's engine room. He has become much more than just a defensive midfielder, though; he's adept at keeping possession ticking in the final third, too, firing off quick passes in different directions.\n\nBreakout candidate: Lamine Yamal -- The 16-year-old has already made his mark for Barcelona and is now hoping to do the same with Spain. The winger -- who is set to become the youngest player to ever play at the tournament -- is lightning quick, has a noteworthy bag of tricks and is expected to start on the right of Spain's attack.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: Since winning the competition in 2012, Spain have often struggled to break down teams when it has mattered in big tournaments. That was the case at the World Cup 18 months ago when they lost to Morocco. That could change this summer. Yamal and Nico Williams offer a new dimension on the wings, while midfielder Pedri appears to be rediscovering his fitness and best form, but the overriding feeling is that they lack the experience and depth of other nations.\n\nRealistic chances at Euro 2024: Spain have a tough group, but given that three teams could progress, they should reach the knockout rounds. A quarterfinal appearance will be the minimum expected from De la Fuente's team. However, they won the UEFA Nations League last year and are capable of beating anyone on their day. Rodri can be a difference-maker; Yamal and Williams offer excitement; Pedri is back; and Álvaro Morata and Joselu have both scored big goals in their careers. If everything comes together in Germany, they are among the candidates to lift the trophy. -- Marsden\n\nSwitzerland\n\nNickname: Nati (National Team)\n\nFIFA rank: 19\n\nEuro 2024 group: Group A\n\nManager: Murat Yakin\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 4W-7D-1L\n\nGroup-stage fixtures: Hungary (Saturday, 9 a.m. ET); Scotland (June 19, 3 p.m. ET); Germany (June 23, 3 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Euro 2024: +6000\n\nCan't-miss star: Granit Xhaka -- Last summer's €15m move from Arsenal to Bayer Leverkusen raised suggestions that Xhaka was moving into the twilight of his career. How wrong they were. Leverkusen won their maiden Bundesliga title with the first unbeaten campaign in the competition's history. Xhaka was integral: 3,648 touches, 3,259 passes and 3,003 successful passes are all Bundesliga records. The 31-year-old is Switzerland's all-time appearance record holder, captain and midfield general.\n\nBreakout candidate: Dan Ndoye -- Anyone with knowledge of Bologna's improbable Serie A campaign -- a surprise fifth-place finish securing Champions League qualification -- will already be aware of Ndoye. The 23-year-old winger is lightning quick and can play on either flank or as a wing-back, as was the case for Switzerland in March.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: Switzerland have never won a major international tournament -- their best showing came at the last Euros when reaching the quarterfinals -- and qualification this time around was overshadowed by a series of indifferent performances that led to questions about Yakin's position. A trend of conceding late goals -- as they did against Romania, Kosovo (twice) and Israel -- is concerning, and the 6-1 round-of-16 thrashing by Portugal at the 2022 World Cup exposed a fragility they have yet to eradicate. Yakin has used different systems -- switching from a 4-3-3 to a back three -- but is seemingly still searching for the answer.\n\nRealistic chances at Euro 2024: Their squad boasts some good individual talent in Xhaka, Manchester City's Manuel Akanji and Internazionale's Yann Sommer, but they look vulnerable in attack. Burnley's Zeki Amdouni could lead the line, although AS Monaco's Breel Embolo is attempting to overcome a serious injury and the Chicago Fire's Xherdan Shaqiri is still an option. A tricky group that includes hosts Germany, resilient Hungary and spirited Scotland poses challenges. Second place in Group B would likely see them face Spain, Italy or Croatia, and it is hard to see them progressing further. -- Olley\n\nTurkey\n\nNickname: Ay-Yıldızlıların (The Crescent Stars)\n\nFIFA rank: 40\n\nEuro 2024 group: Group F\n\nManager: Vincenzo Montella\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 5W-3D-4L\n\nGroup-stage fixtures: Georgia (Tuesday, noon ET); Portugal (June 22, noon ET); Czechia (June 26, 3 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Euro 2024: +6000\n\nCan't-miss star: Hakan Çalhanoğlu -- Montella has described Çalhanoğlu as the \"No. 1 midfielder in the world.\" A creative force who is consistently effective from set pieces, the 30-year-old won his first Serie A title with Inter and operates these days in a more deep-lying role.\n\nBreakout candidate: Kenan Yildiz -- The 19-year-old burst onto the scene at Juventus after leaving Bayern Munich, netting four goals in 10 starts (and 22 substitute appearances) across all competitions. Scored against Germany on his full debut in November and is able to play as a striker or off the left flank. Like Çalhanoğlu, Yildiz was born in Germany but opted for Turkey by virtue of his parents.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: Turkey's best tournament showings came in securing third place at the 2002 World Cup and reaching the semifinals of Euro 2008. They are something of an unknown quantity with Montella only taking up his role in September and a number of young players boasting potential but little pedigree at this level. Çalhanoğlu has been criticised in his homeland at times for failing to influence matches in the way some fans expect. Losing defender Ozan Kabak to a knee ligament injury in last week's warm-up game against Italy is a heavy setback.\n\nRealistic chances at Euro 2024: Impressive wins against Germany and Croatia sit alongside a humiliating 6-1 defeat to Austria in Vienna. Can they find consistency? There is hope that a new generation of talent is emerging with Real Madrid's Arda Güler, Yildiz and Nurnberg's Can Uzun among their more exciting prospects. Optimists will believe they can challenge Portugal for top spot in Group F, and succeeding would be a big boost to their aim of a deep run -- second place would probably result in a round-of-16 clash with France. Ultimately, they lack the quality of the major European sides, but they could be a surprise package if Montella can make them click. -- Olley\n\nUkraine\n\nNickname: Синьо-жовті (The Blue and Yellow)\n\nFIFA rank: 22\n\nEuro 2024 group: Group E\n\nManager: Serhiy Rebrov\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 7W-4D-2L\n\nGroup-stage fixtures: Romania (Monday, 9 a.m. ET); Slovakia (June 21, 9 a.m. ET); Belgium (June 26, noon ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Euro 2024: +50,000\n\nCan't-miss star: Oleksandr Zinchenko -- Supporters of Chelsea might roll their eyes at this, but Mykhailo Mudryk warrants a mention here as their box-office star. In terms of their most important player, though? That's Zinchenko. The Arsenal left-back is likely to be deployed in the centre of midfield for Ukraine and is the man who keeps the tempo going. They'll lean heavily on their young stars breaking through and in-form Girona striker Artem Dovbyk up front, but it's Zinchenko who is the team's conductor.\n\nBreakout candidate: Georgiy Sudakov -- Viktor Tsygankov, 26, has had a brilliant season with Girona and could attract attention this summer from the Premier League, but the player who's expected to command a huge figure this summer is Sudakov. The 21-year-old Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder has been linked with Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, as well as suitors in the Bundesliga. He could command a transfer fee of £50m and will be at the centre of one of the summer's great transfer sagas.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: They only just came through qualification, needing playoff victories against Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as Iceland, and they left it late on both occasions. So that offers a decent barometer for where they are in relation to the rest of the teams in the tournament. They have had several of their best players injured this season, so Rebrov will have to weigh up form, fitness and reputation. But this is a young team, perhaps the youngest at the Euros, so this might be a competition too soon for them."
