        "text": "Portugal legend Pepe has retired from football, the 41-year-old former Real Madrid defender said on Thursday.\n\nPepe’s last game came at Euro 2024, where Portugal were defeated by France on penalties in the quarterfinals, and he became the oldest player to appear at a European Championship finals tournament.\n\n“I want to thank God for giving me the wisdom to be able to continue my journey,” an emotional Pepe said in a video on social media that looked back on his career.\n\n“I can’t help but also thank all the presidents who bet and believed in me to be able to perform my work. To all the employees of all the clubs I’ve been to, who are the soul and essence of the clubs and the national team.\n\n“And I want to thank everyone in the background. I want to leave a thank you and a hug of gratitude for all of you. And thank you all very much.”\n\nPepe made 141 appearances for his country, winning the Euros in 2016, and spent 10 seasons at Real Madrid, where he won three LaLiga titles and three Champions League trophies, as well as two FIFA Club World Cups.\n\nPepe joined the Spanish side in 2007 from Porto, and returned to the Portuguese club in 2019, remaining until the end of his career and winning four Primeira Liga titles across his two spells at the club."
