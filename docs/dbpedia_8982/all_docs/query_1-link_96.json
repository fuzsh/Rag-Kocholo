        "text": "NYON, Switzerland (AP) — Rodri and Alvaro Morata were banned Wednesday for Spain’s first match as the new European champion after singing about a sovereignty claim on Gibraltar at the title celebration last month.\n\nMorata and Rodri led thousands of fans singing “Gibraltar is Spanish” in Madrid, a day after the 2-1 win over England in the European Championship final.\n\nUEFA’s disciplinary panel punished the two players with a one-match ban — to be served in the game against Serbia in the Nations League on Sept. 5 — for, among other charges, “using sporting events for manifestations of a non-sporting nature and for bringing the sport of football, and UEFA in particular, into disrepute.”\n\nGibraltar, which is on the southern tip of Spain, has been a British overseas territory for more than 300 years.\n\nThe Gibraltar soccer federation filed a formal complaint to UEFA after the chants by Rodri and Morata.\n\nRodri is a center midfielder for Manchester City and was named as the player of the tournament at Euro 2024. Morata was Spain’s captain for the tournament and recently completed a move from Atletico Madrid to AC Milan.\n\n___\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer\n\nThe Associated Press"
