        "text": "The UEFA Women's EURO 2022 kicked off on July 6, with matches hosted around England.\n\nSome of the biggest stars in women's football are in action — and, this time around, UEFA has committed to an increased prize fund.\n\nThe distribution of the money, though, works very differently in the women's game. Here is a breakdown.\n\nWhat is the prize money at Women's EURO 2022?\n\nThe prize fund at the Women's Euros is €16 million (around £13.7m / $16.7m). That's double the amount that was on offer last time, at Euro 2017 in the Netherlands.\n\nAccording to UEFA, two decisions taken by European's football's governing body have made this increase possible: \"Separating the commercial arrangements for its men's and women's competitions, and increased overall UEFA investment in the competition.\"\n\nMORE: Miedema fires Netherlands to glory\n\nHow much do the winners of Women's EURO 2022 earn?\n\nThe prize money for UEFA Women's EURO 2022 is cumulative. All countries in the tournament are guaranteed a minimum payout of €600,000 (£517,000 / $627,000).\n\nAfter that, they pick up more money depending on results:\n\nA win in the group stage: €100,000\n\nA draw in the group stage: €50,000\n\nReaching the quarterfinals: €205,000\n\nReaching the semifinals: €320,000\n\nThe runners-up: €420,000\n\nThe champions: €660,000\n\nSo if the nation that wins the tournament also wins all their group games, they will receive a total of €2,085,000m (around £1.8m / $2.17m).\n\nWhat else do the winners of Women's EURO 2022 get?\n\nThe winners of the Women's Euros do, of course, get a trophy. This one was designed by GDE Bertoni of Milan, and was first seen in Manchester back in 2005 ahead of the draw for that summer's tournament.\n\nThe champions will take away a full-size replica, with each of the squad getting a gold medal (with the runners-up getting silver).\n\nWhat happened to the Women's EURO trophy that was used before?\n\nGermany kept the previous Women's Euros trophy after they won the tournament in 2001.\n\nAs West Germany, they won as hosts in 1989; as Germany, they claimed the title in 1991, then embarked on a remarkable run of six consecutive tournament victories from 1995 to 2013.\n\nWomen's Euros past winners"
