        "text": "HELLO NOVEMBER. You know the drill. We point out ten random titles that are brand new or new (again) to streaming and just for fun, freeze frame them at a totally random place in the scroll bar (no cheating - what comes up is what comes up). If there's a link in the long list after the selected titles it goes to previous articles on that film.\n\nNow I aint gonna kill you, Wiley. You and I were friends once.\n\nTHE HARDER THEY FALL (2021) on Netflix\n\nIdris Elba (speaking, hovering over the fallen man) is the antagonist in this movie with Jonathan Majors as our outlaw hero (a rare hero named \"Nat\", yay!!!) in this all-star Black western. Love those long shadows. The cinematography here is by the super talented Romanian DP Mihai Malamaire, Jr (The Master, Jojo Rabbit, Youth Without Youth).\n\nHellooo?\n\nDREAM HORSE (2021) on Hulu\n\nWe will always pick up if Toni Collette is on the line. Or, in this case, we'll call her back. Oops. We've been meaning to catch up with this and since it's streaming now we shall. Abe reviewed this at Sundance 2020 (one of hundreds of movies delayed a year due to the pandemic) and, curiously enough, I reviewed the documentary it's based on during Sundance 2015.\n\n[Crowd cheering and \"whoa!\"-ing]\n\nIN THE HEIGHTS (2021) on HBOMax\n\nMy favourite scene (\"96,000\") within the movie. 2021 has been a year of many wonderful movie-related things but the worst movie related thing of 2021 is how people view this vibrant funny warm and super-cinematic movie musical as a \"failure\". It's like the opposite of that word outside of the misfortune of opening before people who like musicals were really ready to go back to the theaters.\n\nWhat?\n\nMONEYBALL (2011) on Netflix\n\nBrad Pitt is Awesome, Episode ∞. We gave him the Gold Medal in the annual Film Bitch Awards that year right here, writing \"He uses all of his gifts here, the golden boy sheen, the physical creativity, the ease and confidence to underplay big moments. Just wonderful.\" He would later win an Oscar (fraudulently in supporting - though we bronze medalled him again in lead) for doing another impeccable old school star turn in Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood which used all of these exact same gifts.\n\nI have another question here. Are you ready?\n\nNIGHTMARE ALLEY (1947) on Criterion Channel\n\nThis is such a juicy jam-packed noir on multiple levels. In this scene, 48 minutes into the picture, Stanton Carlisle (Tyrone Power) has moved up to the next level of his career, scamming rich folk in clubs with the help of his assistant Molly (Coleen Gray) with his blindfolded psychic act. Bradley Cooper and Rooney Mara take over these roles in the Guillermo Del Toro remake opening in December. We discussed the original last summer. The remake is reportedly a full 30 minutes longer so we'll see what they add... Oscar buzz is all over the place depending on who you believe from \"not gonna happen at all\" to \"big contender\".\n\nDon't look at me like that. Going back to teaching girls track is not exactly the same as quitting.\n\nWILDCATS (1986) on HBOMax\n\nRemember this Goldie Hawn in a man's world comedy? That trick made for a blockbuster with Private Benjamin but it was diminishing returns when they tried it again as she becomes a football couch. Lots of stars in this one: 30s star Gloria Stuart pre Titanic comeback! Jan Hooks just before she became a Saturday Night Live regular! 90s headliners/co-stars Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes in their first credited movie roles! And beloved character actors, too, like Swoosie Kurtz and M Emmet Welsh.\n\nGore Vidal was a handsome kid and I was quite taken by his wit as well as his appearance. We found that we had interests in common and we spent a lot of time together.\n\nTRUMAN AND TENNESSEE: AN INTIMATE CONVERSATION (2020) on Criterion Channel\n\nGore Vidal, Truman Capote, and Tennessee Williams all pictured, left-to-right, in the image above in a sequence about New York City's \"game of importance\" and self-hype. Jim Parsons and Zachary Quinto provide the voices of Truman and Tennessee in this collage drawn from archival interviews. Glenn reviewed the doc earlier this year while it was making the festival rounds.\n\n[no dialogue]\n\nPASSION FISH (1992) on Criterion Channel\n\nIt's Alfre Woodard in one of her greatest performances. This superbly acted drama is part of a wonderful grouping they're calling \"Between Us Girls: Bonds Between Women\" so, in short, an actressexual's feast. The films are Daisies (Czechoslovakia, 1966), Celine and Julie Go Boating (France, 1974), the impeccably titled Agnes Varda film One Sings the Other Doesn't (France, 1977), forgotten Sundance hit Old Enough (US, 1984), Laura Dern breakout Smooth Talk (1985), Jane Campion's debut Two Friends (Australia, 1986), Working Girls (US, 1986), Privilege (US, 1990), Just Another Girl on the IRT (US, 1992), Sofia Coppola's debut The Virgin Suicides (US, 2000), Ghost World (US, 2001), Margot at the Wedding (US, 2007), Frances Ha (US, 2014), Butter on the Latch (US, 2013), Girlhood (France, 2014), Happy Hour (Japan, 2015), Mustang (France, 2015), Fourteen (US, 2019), and The Perfect Candidate (Saudi Arabia, 2019). We only wish they had an included the Oscar nominated Isabelle Huppert picture Entre Nous since its title and subject matter are a perfect match for this collection.\n\nBack the beats, it dont reflect\n\nOn how many records get sold\n\nOn sex, drugs, and rock and roll\n\nWhether your project gets put on hold ♫\n\nDAVE CHAPPELLE'S BLOCK PARTY (2006) on Netflix\n\nOkay so... is Netflix trying to distract us from the controversies surrounding Chappelle's new comedy special and its attacks on trans people? 2006 was a less combative and more joyful time in Chappelle's career. That was due to this Michel Gondry directed film, less a stand up special, than a concert film, which debuted at festivals in 2005 to critical acclaim before collecting respectable coin at box offices in 2006. The film documents an all-star party Chappelle threw in Brooklyn in 2004. As a concert doc it's a first rate affair with performances by Erykah Badu, The Fugees, Common, Mos Def, Jill Scott and more. The whole thing is shot by the great cinematographer Ellen Kuras (Eternal Sunshine, Summer of Sam) and edited in part by Sarah Flack who cuts all of Sofia Coppola's films.\n\nMrs Roat is dead. She was murdered last night near here...and the police think Sam did it.\n\nWAIT UNTIL DARK (1967) on Shudder\n\nHaven't seen this since I was a kid. If you have seen it recently, does it hold up?\n\nalso streaming on Netflix\n\n★ 21 Jump Street (2012) – Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum comedy reboot\n\n★ A River Runs Through It (1992) – Young Brad Pitt in the Robert Redford period drama\n\n★ Addams Family Values (1993) – Invaluable Thanksgiving comedy!\n\nAn Elf’s Story (2011) – animated Christmas special\n\nAngry Birds (Season 4) – animated series\n\n★ Begin Again (2014) - Well loved musical drama with Keira Knightley\n\nBella and the Bulldogs (Season 2) – Family sports series\n\nThe Big Wedding (2013) – Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton rom-com\n\n★ Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) - Francis Ford Coppola's awesome insane spectacle\n\nCamp Confidential: America's Secret Nazis (2021) - Israel animated doc\n\nThe Claus Family (2021) Dutch holiday movie\n\nElf Pets: Santa’s St. Bernards Save Christmas (2018) – Animated fantasy\n\nFirst Knight (1995) – Sean Connery and Richard Gere\n\nThe Forgiven (2017) – Forest Whitaker and Eric Bana in a Post Apartheid drama\n\nGather (2020) – Documentary on Indigenous Americans identity\n\nThe General’s Daughter (1999) – John Travolta crime drama\n\nIt Follows (2014) – Terrifically unnerving and inventive horror film\n\nJohnny Mnemonic (1995) – Keanu Reeves sci-fi actioner\n\nJoJo’s Bizarre Adventure (Season 4) – anime series.\n\nLast Action Hero (1993) – Arnold Schwarzenegger action comedy with cameos.\n\nLocke & Key -Season 2 of the supernatural family drama\n\nMy Dad’s Christmas Date (2020) – British holiday comedy\n\nThe Nightingale (2018) – Disturbing Australian critical favourite set in 1825\n\nRidley Jones (Season 2) - animated kids show\n\nRita Moreno Just a Girl Who Decided To Go For It (2021) -showbiz doc\n\nSnakes on a Plane (2006) – the titular characters (!) plus Samuel L Jackson\n\nStripes (1981) – Bill Murray comedy\n\nTe Ata (2016) – Drama about a young girl trying to make it on Broadway\n\nTexas Rangers (2001) – Actioner\n\nThir13en Ghosts (2001) – Fantasy horror\n\nTotal Recall (2012) – Remake of the 1990 sci-fi classic\n\nWhen a Stranger Calls (2006) – Horror flick about a babysitter\\\n\nNovember 3rd-9th\n\nArcane (season 1) animated series based on the video game League of Legends\n\n★ Big Mouth (Season 5) the hormone monsters return\n\nA Cop Movie (2021) Mexican action drama about actors learning to be cops\n\nThe Club (Part 1) -Turkish period drama about a mother and daughter\n\nFather Christmas is Back (2021) -four feuding sisters in a holiday movie\n\nThe Fortress (2017) Korean history drama\n\nGloria (season 1) Portuguese series about the cold war\n\nOlga Bolaji (2018) Nollywood drama about a retired musician\n\nLove Hard (2021) Romantic comedy about catfishing\n\nMeenakshi Sundareshwar (2021) - Indian romance\n\nNarcos: Mexico (Season 3) - final season\n\nThe Unlikely Murderer (Season 1) - Swedish political drama\n\nWe Couldn't Become Adults (2021) - Japanese romantic drama\n\nYara (2021) -crime thriller about a missing 13 year old\n\n★ Zero to Hero (2021) -Hong Kong's Oscar submission this year.
