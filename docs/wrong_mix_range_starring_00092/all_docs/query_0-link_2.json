From 2018 to 2019 Arkin starred in the Netflix comedy series The Kominsky Method, earning two consecutive nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.[2]\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nAlan Wolf Arkin was born in Brooklyn, a borough of New York City, on March 26, 1934, the son of teacher, painter, writer and lyricist David I. Arkin (1906–1980) (co-writer of the hit Three Dog Night song \"Black and White\"), and his wife, Beatrice (née Wortis) (1909–1991), a teacher.[citation needed] The family lived in Crown Heights.[3] He was raised in a Jewish family with \"no emphasis on religion\".[4] His grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Ukraine, Russia, and Germany.[5][6][7][8] His parents moved to Los Angeles when Alan was 11,[5] but an 8-month Hollywood strike cost his father his job as a set designer. During the 1950s Red Scare, Arkin's parents were accused of being Communists, and his father was fired when he refused to answer questions about his political ideology. David Arkin challenged the dismissal, but he was vindicated only after his death.[9]\n\nArkin, who had been taking acting lessons since age 10, became a scholarship student at various drama academies, including one run by the Stanislavsky student Benjamin Zemach, who taught Arkin a psychological approach to acting.[10] Arkin attended Los Angeles State College from 1951 to 1953. He also attended Bennington College.[11]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\n1956–1969\n\n[edit]\n\nHe started his career in the 1950s as a singer and guitarist in the folk group, The Tarriers.[12] They had two hits in 1956–7: \"Cindy, Oh Cindy\" and \"Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)\".[12] They performed the latter in the 1957 musical movie, Calypso Heat Wave, and sang \"Choucoune\" in this too.[13] Arkin went on to sing with another folk group, The Baby Sitters.[14] Arkin was an early member of the Second City comedy troupe in the 1960s.[15] In 1957, he made his feature film acting debut in a small role in the musical Calypso Heat Wave.[13] In the early sixties, he appeared in episodes of East Side/West Side (1964)[16] and ABC Stage 67 (1966).[17] He also made his Broadway debut as a performer in From the Second City at the Royale Theatre in 1961.[18][19]\n\nArkin starred in 1963 on Broadway as David Kolowitz in Joseph Stein's comedic play Enter Laughing. Critic Howard Taubman of The New York Times gave the play a mixed review but praised Arkin's performance, describing it as \"a choice specimen of a shrewd actor ribbing his profession.\"[20] For his performance, he received the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play, and a Theatre World Award.[21] The following year, he returned to Broadway starring as Harry Berlin in Luv directed by Mike Nichols. Arkin starred opposite Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson.[22]\n\nIn 1966, he starred in Norman Jewison's comedy film The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming opposite Carl Reiner and Eva Marie Saint. Robert Alden of The New York Times praised Arkin's performance describing it as his \"first full-length film appearance and a particularly wonderful performance.\"[23] For his performance Arkin received a Academy Award for Best Actor nomination[24] and a BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer nomination.[25] He also received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.[26] The following year he appeared in the Vittorio De Sica sex comedy Woman Times Seven starring Shirley MacLaine, and in Terence Young's psychological thriller film Wait Until Dark starring Audrey Hepburn.[27]\n\nIn 1968, he starred as Inspector Jacques Clouseau in the third installment of The Pink Panther franchise, titled Inspector Clouseau, after Peter Sellers dissociated himself from the role. The film was not well-received by Sellers' fans and critics, but Penelope Gilliatt of The New Yorker called it \"an incredibly bad film, but Alan Arkin is sometimes very funny in it, especially when he doesn't try to be.\"[28] That same year, he co-starred with Sondra Locke in The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, playing a suicidal deaf mute.[29][30] For his performance, he received nominations for an Academy Award for Best Actor[31] and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama,[26] and won a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor.[32] In 1969, he starred in Arthur Hiller's comedy Popi opposite Rita Moreno. The film focuses on a Puerto Rican widower struggling to raise his two young sons in the New York City neighborhood of Spanish Harlem. Arkin received another nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama.[26]\n\nIn 1969, Arkin's directorial debut was the Oscar-nominated[33][34] 12-minute children's film titled People Soup, starring his sons Adam Arkin and Matthew Arkin.[35] Based on a story of the same name he published in Galaxy Science Fiction in 1958,[36] People Soup is a fantasy about two boys who experiment with various kitchen ingredients until they concoct a magical soup which transforms them into different animals and objects.[35]\n\n1970–1985\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1970, Arkin starred as Capt.

The film opened to a lukewarm review by Roger Greenspun,[42] and a more positive one by Vincent Canby[43] in The New York Times. Roger Ebert's review in the Chicago Sun-Times was enthusiastic, stating \"One of the reasons it works and is indeed a definitive reflection of America's darker moods is that it breaks audiences down into isolated individuals, vulnerable and uncertain.\"[44] Arkin also directed Fire Sale (1977).[27]\n\nDuring the 1970s, Arkin starred in films of various genres including the Vernon Zimmerman road comedy Deadhead Miles (1972), the Gene Saks adaptation of the Neil Simon play of the same name Last of the Red Hot Lovers (1972) with Sally Kellerman and Paula Prentiss, the black comedy action film Freebie and the Bean (1974), the dramedy Rafferty and the Gold Dust Twins (1975) with Kellerman and Mackenzie Phillips, the 1978 TV prison film The Other Side of Hell (1978), the western comedy Hearts of the West (1975),[45] and the British mystery The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (1976).[46][17] In 1973, Arkin directed the Broadway production of Neil Simon's The Sunshine Boys.
