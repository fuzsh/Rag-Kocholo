        "text": "US actor Alan Arkin, who won an Oscar and a Bafta for his role as the outrageous grandad in the film Little Miss Sunshine, has died aged 89.\n\nDuring a screen and stage career that spanned seven decades, Arkin appeared in Ben Affleck's Oscar-winning Argo.\n\nHis death was confirmed by his three sons in a family statement on Friday.\n\nMichael Douglas, his co-star in the Netflix show The Kominsky Method led the tributes, calling him a \"wonderful actor\" who \"left an indelible mark\".\n\nAllow Instagram content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Instagram . We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to read and before accepting. To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’.\n\nHis sons Adam, Matthew and Anthony said: \"Our father was a uniquely talented force of nature, both as an artist and a man.\n\n\"A loving husband, father, grand and great-grandfather, he was adored and will be deeply missed.\"\n\nArkin also voiced JD Salinger in the animated series BoJack Horseman from 2015 to 2016.\n\nFellow actor Paul Reiser reacted to the news of his death by tweeting that \"a world without Alan Arkin is… not so great.\"\n\n\"I've loved this man from the moment he came on screen in The Russians Are Coming (Whitaker Walt!),\" he wrote. \"I was 8.\n\n\"Getting to know him - and getting a laugh out of him - is a highlight of my life. RIP dear friend.\"\n\nSpinal Tap star Michael McKean also paid homage, saying: \"When I was a young actor people wanted to know if I wanted to be a serious actor or a funny one.\n\n\"I'd answer, 'Which kind is Alan Arkin?' and that shut them up.\"\n\nHe described Arkin as \"charming, hilarious, and armed with a flawless [nonsense] detector, he was pure pleasure to be with.\"\n\nThe New York-born and Los Angeles-raised actor, director and screenwriter, known for his deadpan comic timing, had acting lessons from childhood; but actually started out in music, singing and playing guitar in a folk band called The Tarriers.\n\nThey scored a top five hit in 1956 with The Banana Boat Song, later made famous by Harry Belafonte.\n\nA college dropout, he moved to Chicago in 1960 and became an early member of the Second City improvisational comedy troupe, which he once noted had \"literally saved my life\".\n\nHis acting career began auspiciously on Broadway, appearing in the play Enter Laughing in 1963, which won him a Tony Award for best actor.\n\nHe became famous by appearing in films like 1966's The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming and then The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, both of which saw him nominated for the best actor Oscar. He won a Golden Globe award for the former, a Cold War comedy.\n\nMoving into directing early on, he was nominated for another Tony in 1973 for his off stage work on the play The Sunshine Boys.\n\n'He's a maniac'\n\nAfter appearing on the big screen in Tim Burton's 1990 fantasy romance Edward Scissorhands, opposite Johnny Depp, and alongside a stellar cast including Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris and Alec Baldwin in the 1992 drama film Glengarry Glen Ross; his performance in 2006's Little Miss Sunshine saw him win both an Oscar and Bafta for best supporting actor.\n\nThe tragicomedy centred around members of a dysfunctional family taking their youngest to compete in a child beauty pageant.\n\nIn it, Arkin played the foul-mouthed grandfather Edwin Hoover, who goes to live with his family after being evicted from a retirement home for snorting heroin.\n\nHe goes on to coach his granddaughter Olive, an aspiring beauty queen, in preparation for the pageant, teaching her how to striptease.\n\n\"He's a maniac, but to me he was absolutely believable,\" Arkin once said of the character.\n\nWhile the critics loved his work, the actor was never interested in the talk that surrounded him and his films. \"I've never met Oscar Buzz,\" he joked. \"I've heard a lot about him, but I've never met the man.\"\n\nIn his 2018 memoir Out of My Mind, he revealed that despite his success as a younger man, he had been utterly miserable most of the time.\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian around the book's release, he said he had been an anxious child and that acting - which he once said felt like \"torture\" at times - had given him strength.\n\n\"I had this sense that I didn't exist,\" he said. \"My parents were wonderful people in many ways, but they weren't affectionate. I don't remember ever being touched by either one.\n\n\"I felt ignored to the point where I didn't even exist - so acting was my lifeline to not feeling like I was being obliterated. For many years, the only place I felt alive was on stage.\"\n\nHe explained how he had managed to turn his personal life around through meditation and Eastern philosophy.\n\nThe film is set during the Iran hostage crisis where employees of the US embassy are held captive and a plan is launched to rescue them involving a fake film being made there.\n\nThe veteran was honoured with own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2019."
