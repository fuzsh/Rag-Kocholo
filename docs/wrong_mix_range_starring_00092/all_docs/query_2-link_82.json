        "text": "A Century of Film\n\nSupporting Actor\n\nFilm has always relied on supporting performances but awards groups haven’t always recognized them right away. It wasn’t until the 9th Academy Awards that the first supporting awards were given out. Likewise, the BAFTAs would go through their first 20 awards without the category and no critics group would give such an award until 1957. But eventually, of course, all the awards groups followed through and today it’s one way of celebrating great character actors although it has also been a chance for big stars to win their Oscar at last. Supporting performances can be a role that runs through the whole film (like the way the Academy nominated Gene Hackman for I Never Sang for My Father or Al Pacino for The Godfather) or for a performance that dominates the film in spite of only being in a few scenes (like Orson Welles in The Third Man).\n\nnote: A note on the years. Because I use the Academy calendar for all of my awards but often have people asking about the actual release year of a film, any film with two dates listed, the first is its original release date and the second is the year it was Oscar eligible and thus Nighthawk eligible. Down below, I only use one date when referencing awards and that’s the year the film was eligible for that award, which might not be its original release year or its Oscar year, depending on the award in question.\n\nnote: Critical Acclaim. That’s a phrase I will use below several times. So that I don’t have to keep repeating what it means, it’s based on the Consensus Awards that I do. My feelings don’t play into those awards except by the percentages I assign. 60 points for a win, 30 for a nomination. 100% for the Oscars, SAG, BAFTA, NYFC, LAFC, 90% for the BSFC, CFC, NSFC, 80% for the BFCA, NBR, 70% for the Globes. Then, I calculate percentage of the total points. That’s because in 1943 (the first year of the Globes) there were 228 total points and in 2017 there were 1176 total points, so the percentage of the total points is the best way to account for historical changes in scores. So, the performance with the highest percentage of the year’s total points has the most critical acclaim under the definition I am using (it’s Gene Hackman, 1992, Unforgiven).\n\nMy Top 5 Supporting Actor Performances in Film History:\n\nAl Pacino, The Godfather, 1972\n\nRalph Fiennes, Schindler’s List, 1993\n\nClaude Rains, Casablanca, 1942/1943\n\nGene Hackman, Unforgiven, 1992\n\nIan McKellen, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, 2001\n\nThe other 9 Point Performances (chronological by Nighthawk eligibility):\n\nClaude Rains, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, 1939\n\nSydney Greenstreet, The Maltese Falcon, 1941\n\nWalter Huston, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 1948\n\nOrson Welles, The Third Man, 1949/1950\n\nErich von Stroheim, Sunset Blvd., 1950\n\nGeorge Sanders, All About Eve, 1950\n\nToshiro Mifune, Rashomon, 1950/1952\n\nKarl Malden, A Streetcar Named Desire, 1951\n\nKarl Malden, On the Waterfront, 1954\n\nToshiro Mifune, The Seven Samurai, 1954/1956\n\nJack Lemmon, Mr. Roberts, 1955\n\nGeorge C.

They also correspond to the 100 point scale for Best Picture. Films above *** (76-99) all land on the scale. 1 point is for 76-79, just worth mentioning. 2 points is for 80-83, a weak mention, 3 points is for 84-87, near great, 4 points is for 88-89 (which is ****), a solid nominee, 5 points is for 90-91, a very solid nominee, 6 points is for 92-93, a weak winner, a 7 points is for 94-95, a worthwhile winner, 8 points is 96-97, the kind of winner you can’t complain about even if it’s not your #1 choice and 9 points is for 98-99, the very best of all-time. The above list are my 9 point films for Supporting Actor through 2011, listed chronologically.\n\nBest Performances All-Time by Decade:\n\n1920’s: Max Schreck, Nosferatu, 1922/1929\n\n1930’s: Claude Rains, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, 1939\n\n1940’s: Claude Rains, Casablanca, 1942/1943\n\n1950’s: Karl Malden, A Streetcar Named Desire, 1951\n\n1960’s: George C. Scott, The Hustler, 1961\n\n1970’s: Al Pacino, The Godfather, 1972\n\n1980’s: Denzel Washington, Glory, 1989\n\n1990’s: Ralph Fiennes, Schindler’s List, 1993\n\n2000’s: Ian McKellen, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, 2001\n\n2010’s: Christian Bale, The Fighter, 2010\n\nBest Performance All-Time by Age:\n\nnote: Age is based on subtracting the year they were born from the year the film was originally released. I’m not going to try to figure out when the birthday is or when the film was made.\n\npre-teen: Haley Joel Osment, The Sixth Sense, 1999, 11\n\nteenager: River Phoenix, Running on Empty, 1988, 17\n\n20’s: Heath Ledger, The Dark Knight, 2008, 29\n\n30’s: Al Pacino, The Godfather, 1972, 32\n\n40’s: Joe Pesci, GoodFellas, 1990, 47\n\n50’s: Claude Rains, Casablanca, 1942, 53\n\n60’s: Gene Hackman, Unforgiven, 1992, 62\n\n70’s: Christopher Plummer, The Insider, 1999, 70\n\n80’s: Christopher Plummer, Beginners, 2011, 82\n\nAction: Heath Ledger, The Dark Knight, 2008\n\nAdventure: Alan Rickman, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, 1991\n\nComedy: Martin Landau, Ed Wood, 1994\n\nCrime: Al Pacino, The Godfather, 1972\n\nDrama: Ralph Fiennes, Schindler’s List, 1993\n\nFantasy: Ian McKellen, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, 2001\n\nHorror: Haley Joel Osment, The Sixth Sense, 1999\n\nKids: Ray Bolger, The Wizard of Oz, 1939\n\nMusical: George Chakiris, West Side Story, 1961\n\nMystery: Sydney Greenstreet, The Maltese Falcon, 1941\n\nSci-Fi: Alec Guinness, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, 1977\n\nSuspense: Claude Rains, Notorious, 1946\n\nWar: Denzel Washington, Glory, 1989\n\nWestern: Gene Hackman, Unforgiven, 1992\n\nThe Actors:\n\nClaude Rains\n\nThere is no better character actor in the history of film. He only appears on my Best Actor list twice, both times hard to see (The Invisible Man, Phantom of the Opera) but he’s on my Supporting Actor list a whopping 11 times earning 10 nominations and winning the Nighthawk three times. As you can see from the list above, he is one of only five actors to earn multiple perfect 9 scores. He would also earn 4 Oscar nominations though, sadly, would never win. To give an idea of how great I think he was, by 1946, he had over 400 absolute points (see below) while it would take until 1960 before any other actor would even have 200.\n\nKey Films: Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Casablanca, Notorious\n\nWalter Brennan\n\nNot one of my personal favorites and I think two of his three Oscars are two of the three worst ever awarded in the category. Nonetheless, you can’t ignore the fact that he won three of the first five Oscars awarded in this category and that he was a key character actor in films throughout the 30’s and 40’s.\n\nKey Films: Come and Get It, Kentucky, Red River\n\nArthur Kennedy\n\nArthur Kennedy received one Oscar nomination for Best Actor (Bright Victory) but was mainly known through the 50’s as the male equivalent of Thelma Ritter, the guy who kept getting nominated but never winning. He was nominated for five Oscars in total, all in the space of a decade, including three supporting nominations in four years in 1955, 1957 and 1958. He never makes it higher than third at the Nighthawks but he also has six finishes in the Top 7 and he’s always worth watching, even in dreck like Peyton Place.\n\nKey Films: Champion, Trial, Some Came Running\n\nAlec Guinness\n\nAlec Guinness, of course, is the ultimate chameleon, sliding into character roles but also was a lead as well. He received two Oscar nominations in Supporting Actor (Star Wars, Little Dorrit). But he receives five Nighthawk nominations, winning for Star Wars and two other performances that land in the Top 7 and a lot of those performances in films like Kind Hearts and Coronets, Oliver Twist and The Comedians were overlooked by all awards groups.\n\nKey Films: Oliver Twist, Kind Hearts and Coronets, Star Wars\n\nGene Hackman\n\nThe winner of three Nighthawk Awards, one of which he won the Oscar for (Unforgiven) and the other two of which earned him nominations (Bonnie and Clyde, I Never Sang for My Father). That doesn’t even include work like Superman, Under Fire or No Way Out. Also a great lead actor.\n\nKey Films: Bonnie and Clyde, I Never Sang for My Father, Unforgiven\n\nRobert Duvall\n\nThe supporting star of the 70’s. The only Oscar nominations he received that decade were for The Godfather and Apocalypse Now (the latter of which he should have won the Oscar for) but he was also great in supporting in M*A*S*H, The Godfather Part II and Network. And that doesn’t even bring up his later Oscar nomination for A Civil Action.\n\nKey Films: The Godfather, Network, Apocalypse Now\n\nDenholm Elliott\n\nOnly Oscar nominated once, for A Room with a View, but he has by far the most points in BAFTA history. Indeed, in the mid 80’s, Elliott won three straight BAFTAs in this category (Trading Places, A Private Function, Defence of the Realm). He is also one of my favorite actors and always a joy to behold who gets off my favorite line in Raiders of the Lost Ark (“That’s just what the Hebrews thought.”).\n\nKey Films: A Private Function, Defence of the Realm, A Room with a View\n\nIan Holm\n\nAnother BAFTA favorite, winning for The Bofors Gun and Chariots of Fire and second all-time in BAFTA points. Like Elliott, only has one Oscar nom (Chariots) but all of the awards groups ignored his performances in films like Alien and Fellowship of the Ring. Winner of the 1985 Boston Society of Film Critics for four really good performances that year in Brazil, Dreamchild, Wetherby and Dance with a Stranger. And none of that even includes his great television work (Les Miserables, Holocaust, All Quiet on the Western Front) or his voice performance in Ratatouille.\n\nKey Films: Alien, Chariots of Fire, Fellowship of the Ring\n\nJack Nicholson\n\nAnother lead actor who also earned a lot of plaudits in supporting. His first Oscar nomination was in supporting (Easy Rider) and was nominated again in 1981 (Reds) and won in 1983 (Terms of Endearment) before earning another nom in 1992 (A Few Good Men). Between those four performances he won 11 critics awards, far more than any other actor in the category. He also earned Globe nominations for all four and for The Departed, giving him the most Globe points.\n\nKey Films: Reds, Terms of Endearment, A Few Good Men.\n\nMichael Caine\n\nI originally didn’t have Caine listed here, thinking of him more in lead. But he has now nearly caught Claude Rains for total absolute Nighthawk points and he did win two Oscars in the category (Hannah and Her Sisters, The Cider House Rules) and he was criminally overlooked for California Suite. He really started cranking out strong supporting performances in the 2000’s with The Weather Man, Batman Begins, The Prestige, Children of Men and The Dark Knight.\n\nKey Films: California Suite, Hannah and Her Sisters, Mona Lisa\n\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman\n\nWinner of the 1999 NBR for Magnolia and The Talented Mr. Ripley, Oscar (and other awards groups) nominated for Charlie Wilson’s War and Doubt and none of that even includes his best supporting performance which is Almost Famous. In the 00’s, earned more points than any actor in any decade except Claude Rains in the 40’s and Robert Duvall in the 70’s.\n\nKey Films: Almost Famous, Charlie Wilson’s War, Doubt\n\nThe Academy Awards\n\nSummary:\n\nThis category began at the Oscars in 1936 with Walter Brennan winning the Oscar as he would also do two other times (1938, 1940) which meant that by the fifth year of this category’s existence Brennan already had more points than any other actor would earn in it even through to today. A number of trivia items can be found in the posts linked below as well as the items listed in the next few paragraphs.\n\nI am not going to list the entire field of Oscar nominees over the years because you can find it here and I already listed it here and here. Plus it would take too long to type and make the post way too long. The second list also includes my lists of nominees through 2009 though my annual Nighthawk Awards supersede that list as my lists are always fluid.\n\nMultiple Nominations:\n\nUnlike Makeup, the first category I covered in this series, a film can earn multiple nominations in this category, like all the acting categories (and Song). The first film to do that was Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (which lost both in 1939) and though it wouldn’t happen again until the 50’s, five films in the 50’s would earn multiple nominations with On the Waterfront becoming the first film to earn three nominations. Overall, three films have earned three nominations (with only The Godfather Part II winning the Oscar) and fourteen films have earned two nominations (with four of them winning the Oscar, all between 1971 and 1983 – The Last Picture Show, Julia, Ordinary People, Terms of Endearment).\n\nDirectors:\n\nAs is the case with most of the acting categories, William Wyler rules the roost here. He directed 10 nominated performances and an astounding five of them won the Oscar (including twice for Walter Brennan). Only six other directors have directed even more than one winning performance (three each for John Ford, Elia Kazan and Clint Eastwood, two each for Fred Zinnemann, Joseph L. Mankiewicz and Mervyn LeRoy). Likewise, only two other directors have even directed five nominated performances, with Francis Ford Coppola directing nine (seven just from Godfather films but only one winner), Elia Kazan with six (three winners and then three non-winners all from one film) and five each from Ford, Zinnemann and Sidney Lumet (the only director with at least five nominations but no wins). For a long time, it wasn’t very common for directors to earn back-to-back nominations in this category. In fact, before any director did that, William Wyler had two films nominated in the same year (1940 – The Westerner, The Letter). Eventually, nine directors would have back-to-back years with nominations with two directors having three successive nominations (Joshua Logan in 55-57 and Sidney Lumet in 75-77). Elia Kazan (51-52), William Wyler (58-59) and Clint Eastwood (03-04) would all direct back-to-back winners. In 1975 and 76 both Sidney Lumet and John Schlesinger would have nominees in each year. Of course, one of the amazing things about Wyler is that his total, while much higher than anyone else, still only accounts for less than 9% of his films’ Oscar points, less than most of the other directors mentioned here. There are 13 directors whose only Oscar nomination for a film is for Supporting Actor but Mike Mills is the only one to have his film actually win that single nomination (Beginners).\n\nSequels:\n\nThe Godfather sequels would earn four nominations and an Oscar in this category which is especially surprising when you consider that until 2008 no other sequel had ever even earned a nomination. But in 2008, Heath Ledger won the Oscar for The Dark Knight. However, all of those nominations were for performers who weren’t in the earlier films.\n\nGenres:\n\nDrama dominates Supporting Actor even more than it dominates the total awards, accounting for 51.84% of all the nominees as opposed to 42.83% of all nominations. Ironically the only year it had all five nominees it only had four films (1951, with Quo Vadis nominated twice) but it’s had four nominees on numerous occasions, most recently in 2011 and 2009. The only years with no Drama nominees were 1947, 1972 and 1974 (the last two years dominated by Crime with three Godfather nominees each time). It’s followed by Comedy, Crime and War. Musicals, which do well overall at the Oscars (11.60%) do poorly in Supporting Actor (3.42%) and have only earned three nominations since 1982. The categories with the fewest nominations are Kids (Miracle on 34th Street, Black Stallion, Babe), Sci-Fi (Star Wars, Cocoon, 12 Monkeys) and Fantasy (Fellowship of the Ring). Drama has won almost half the time (37 out of 76), followed by Comedy (14), Crime (7), War (5) and Western (5). Only Adventure, Horror and Fantasy have never won.\n\nBest Picture:\n\nFifteen films have won the Oscar for Best Picture and Supporting Actor, starting with The Life of Emile Zola and including at least one every decade with the longest gap being 1961 to 1974. Another 31 Picture winners have earned Supporting Actor nominations with On the Waterfront and The Godfather earning three each and Rocky and Platoon earning two each. The longest streak of Picture winners with at least a nomination is six (1959-64). Only once has there been three straight years where no Picture winner earned at least a nomination (1995-97). Another 25 films won Supporting Actor while being nominated for Picture. In total, 164 films have been at least nominated for both Picture and Supporting Actor. There has never been a year when all five nominees were from Picture nominees though there have been several years where four of the five nominees did including the oddity of 1954 when the three nominees from the Picture winner (On the Waterfront) all lost to the only nominee not from a Picture winner (The Barefoot Contessa). The only year with no nominees from Picture nominees is 1988.\n\nForeign Films:\n\nThis is the only acting category and the only other category aside from Visual Effects where no Foreign language film has ever been nominated. There have been three nominations in which the character spoke primarily a language other than English (Graham Greene in Dances with Wolves, Benicio del Toro in Traffic, who won and Ken Watanabe in The Last Samurai).\n\nSingle Nominations:\n\nOnly 46 films have received a nomination for Supporting Actor but no other nominations. That’s only 12.11%, the lowest of the acting categories and one of the lowest of all categories. Only five of those films won the Oscar, tied with Actor for least among acting (the five films are Kentucky, Johnny Eager, Topkapi, City Slickers, Beginners).\n\nOther Categories:\n\nUnless you want to count both Screenplay categories together (201), the category most often nominated with Supporting Actor is actually Picture (164) which makes sense since there have been so many years with more than 5 nominees in the Picture category. I often think of Actress and Supporting Actor being nominated together but it’s not true. Actress and Supporting Actor have only been nominated together 78 times, far fewer than Supporting Actress (92) and especially Actor (108). Ironically, though, both Actor and Actress have five overlapping films that won the Oscar for both that category and Supporting Actor (there are 8 that won both supporting awards). Aside from Picture and Actor, the categories that overlap more than 100 times are the expected ones with the most nominations: Adapted Screenplay, Editing, Cinematography, Score and Art Direction. Though, it surprising that Score, with by far the most total nominations (well over 700) only overlaps with Supporting Actor 102 times. Overall, 51 of the 81 films nominated for 10 or more Oscars were nominated for Supporting Actor.\n\nThe Academy Awards Top 10:\n\nWalter Brennan – 210\n\nPeter Ustinov – 150\n\nJason Robards – 150\n\nJack Nicholson – 150\n\nCharles Coburn – 120\n\nClaude Rains – 120\n\nAnthony Quinn – 120\n\nArthur Kennedy – 120\n\nGig Young – 120\n\nMelvyn Douglas – 120\n\nJack Palance – 120\n\nGene Hackman – 120\n\nMartin Landau – 120\n\nMichael Caine – 120\n\nnote: Wins are worth 60 points and nominations are worth 30.\n\nnote: Rains and Kennedy are the only ones on the list without an Oscar and are the only ones aside from Nicholson with four nominations. Brennan had three wins. Ustinov, Robards, Quinn, Douglas and Caine all had two wins. The rest had two wins and a nomination except Nicholson who had a win and three nominations.\n\nTop 5 Oscar Winners:\n\nGene Hackman (Unforgiven)\n\nKarl Malden (A Streetcar Named Desire)\n\nMartin Landau (Ed Wood)\n\nKevin Kline (A Fish Called Wanda)\n\nJoe Pesci (GoodFellas)\n\nWorst 5 Oscar Winners:\n\nWalter Brennan (Come and Get It)\n\nBurl Ives (The Big Country)\n\nWalter Brennan (Kentucky)\n\nPeter Ustinov (Topkapi)\n\nJack Albertson (The Subject Was Roses)\n\nWorst 5 Oscar Nominees:\n\nBrandon de Wilde (Shane)\n\nEthan Hawke (Training Day)\n\nChill Wills (The Alamo)\n\nWalter Bendix (Wake Island)\n\nJoaquin Phoenix (Gladiator)\n\n10 Best Performances Not Nominated for an Oscar:\n\nToshiro Mifune (Rashomon)\n\nMandy Patinken (The Princess Bride)\n\nMichael Sheen (The Queen)\n\nToshiro Mifune (The Seven Samurai)\n\nAnthony Hopkins (The Lion in Winter)\n\nKevin Spacey (L.A.

Groucho Marx replies in an ad that’s he glad to be Wills’ brother but he voted for Sal Mineo (Exodus). In spite of that and Mineo winning the Globe, Peter Ustinov wins the Oscar. Ustinov, like Ives, wins for one film while a different film of his is nominated for Best Picture (in this case, Spartacus rather than Sundowners).\n\nMartin Balsam, A Thousand Clowns, 1965\n\nBalsam tells Shelley Winters after the ceremony that he won because he didn’t win for Breakfast at Tiffany’s which is incredibly bizarre since not only wasn’t he nominated for Breakfast at the Oscars or even the Globes but he was barely in the film.\n\nGene Hackman, I Never Sang for My Father, 1970\n\nA good example of why I place things in Oscar categories so that I can compare apples to apples. But this was the lead role in the film and it was utterly absurd that he was nominated in supporting. This will come up again in 1972 (Pacino, but at least the NBR also gave Pacino a supporting award).\n\nRobert De Niro, The Godfather Part II, 1974\n\nA pleasant surprise. A year after De Niro won two critics awards and failed to earn a nomination, his Oscar win is his only nomination. But I think the Oscars got this one right.\n\nDon Ameche, Cocoon, 1985\n\nThe last Oscar winner with no other nominations and it’s a bizarre choice. Klaus Maria Brandauer won the NYFC, NBR and Globe and Out of Africa won Best Picture but he didn’t win the Oscar.\n\nDennis Hopper, Hoosiers, 1986\n\nEven Hopper was stunned when they nominated him for Hoosiers instead of Blue Velvet.\n\nKevin Kline, A Fish Called Wanda, 1988\n\nA big surprise as the other four nominees all had at least one critics win each and Kline only had a BAFTA nomination (in lead). But I think the Academy got this one right with one of the funniest performances in film history.\n\nBill Murray, Rushmore, 1998\n\nHe wins three critics awards and can’t even earn a nomination. And the Oscar goes to James Coburn for Affliction whose only other awards attention was a SAG nom.\n\nAlan Arkin, Little Miss Sunshine, 2006\n\nThe weakest of the five nominees wins over the Globe / BFCA / SAG winner (Eddie Murphy), the NYFC / CFC winner (Jackie Earle Haley), the NSFC / BSFC winner (Mark Wahlberg) and the NBR winner (Djimon Honsou).\n\nKudos to the Oscars – the best post-1967 performances nominated by the Oscars but no one else\n\nRobert De Niro, The Godfather Part II, 1974\n\nGene Wilder, The Producers, 1968\n\nAlbert Brooks, Broadcast News, 1987\n\nMartin Landau, Crimes and Misdemeanors, 1989\n\nRobert Forster, Jackie Brown, 1997\n\nThe BAFTAs\n\nSummary:\n\nIt would take until 1968, when the BAFTAs dropped their British categories that they finally established supporting acting awards. While it was an all-encompassing award, it was, right from the start, heavily favored towards British actors. The first four winners were all British from British films and they trended that way for quite a while (in the 80’s the only winners not from the British isles were Jack Nicholson and Daniel Auteuil). And even by 2011, of the top seven actors on the BAFTA points list, five are British (and one is Australian). For years, the BAFTA Awards were after the Oscars and they clearly weren’t influenced because until the 21st Century only four actors won both awards. That has changed in recent years as Bill Nighy (2003, Love Actually) was the last BAFTA winner without an Oscar nom and most actors now win both. Denholm Elliott is the king of the award, having won three consecutive years (1983-85) and earning four other nominations. BAFTA Awards can be hard to line up with other awards because of different eligibility years (both the 1984 and 1985 Elliott awards, for example, were Oscar eligible in 1985 and thus appear in the Consensus Awards that year). In 1980, the BAFTAs didn’t give out either supporting award. The next year, they called it Best Supporting Artist but all four of the nominees were male.\n\nSequels:\n\nThe BAFTAs have given the award to a sequel once (Ledger) and nominated two other performances (Sean Connery, 1989, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Ian McKellen, 2003, Return of the King).\n\nGenres:\n\nLike the Oscars, Drama is the big one here because it simply has the most films. Just over 50% of the nominees and almost 45% of the winners come from Dramas. Next up for both is Comedy, with 15% of the nominees and 14% of the winners. The only genre without a nomination is Horror while Fantasy, Sci-Fi and Kids all have nominations but no winners.\n\nBest Picture:\n\nThe King’s Speech is the big film here, the only film to win Picture, British Film and Supporting Actor. Six other films have won Picture and Supporting Actor while Elizabeth won British Film and Supporting Actor. Fourteen other films have won Picture and been nominated for Supporting Actor (five of them earning two nominations). A whopping 18 films have won Supporting Actor while being nominated for Picture. Overall, 74 films have earned at least a nomination in both categories while 8 more earned British Film nominations and Supporting Actor nominations (with Love Actually winning the latter). Only 16 films have won Supporting Actor without a Picture or British Film nomination.\n\nSingle Nominees:\n\nOf the 172 films nominated for Supporting Actor (185 nominations), 28 of them earned no other nominations with only three of those (Defence of the Realm, Rob Roy, Beginners) winning the award.\n\nForeign Films:\n\nThe BAFTAs are better than the Oscars. There have only been three nominees from Foreign language films but two of them won the BAFTA (Daniel Auteuil, Jean de Florette, 1987 and Salvatore Cascio, Cinema Paradiso, 1990) with the third nominee being Rodrigo de la Serna (The Motorcycle Diaries, 2004).\n\nOther Categories:\n\nSupporting Actor nominated films tend to pile it on. Of the 173 films nominated for Supporting Actor, over 70 each have earned Picture or Director nominations (usually both) and almost 70 have been nominated for Editing. In fact, more films with Supporting Actor nominations have earned 10 or more nominations (33) than just the one nomination (28). The acting is pretty evenly distributed, with 48 nominated for Actor, 47 for Supporting Actress and 38 for Actress. Of the five films nominated for all four, two of them won Supporting Actor (Reds, A Fish Called Wanda). The only category with no overlap with Supporting Actor is Animated Film and the short-lived Song category.\n\nThe BAFTA Top 10:\n\nDenholm Elliott – 300\n\nIan Holm – 180\n\nEdward Fox – 150\n\nJohn Hurt – 150\n\nJohn Gielgud – 150\n\nJack Nicholson – 150\n\nGeoffrey Rush – 120\n\nRobert Duvall – 120\n\nRay McAnally – 120\n\nAlan Rickman / Tom Wilkinson – 120\n\nTop 5 BAFTA Winners:\n\nRalph Fiennes, Schindler’s List, 1993\n\nGene Hackman, Unforgiven, 1992\n\nRobert Duvall, Apocalypse Now, 1979\n\nHeath Ledger, The Dark Knight, 2008\n\nChristoph Waltz, Inglourious Basterds, 2009\n\nTop 5 BAFTA Years (4 Nominees, 1968-1998):\n\n1993 (Ralph Fiennes (Schindler’s List), Tommy Lee Jones (Fugitive), Ben Kingsley (Schindler’s List), John Malkovich (In the Line of Fire))\n\n1995 (Tim Roth (Rob Roy), Martin Landau (Ed Wood), Alan Rickman (Sense and Sensibility), Ian Holm (Madness of King George))\n\n1986 (Ray McAnally (The Mission), Klaus Maria Brandeur (Out of Africa), Denholm Elliott, Simon Callow (Room with a View))\n\n1989 (Ray McAnally (My Left Foot), Jack Nicholson (Batman), Sean Connery (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade), Marlon Brando (A Dry White Season))\n\n1992 (Gene Hackman (Unforgiven), Jaye Davidson (Crying Game), Tommy Lee Jones (JFK), Samuel West (Howards End))\n\nTop 5 BAFTA Years (5 Nominees, 1999-2011):\n\n2005 (Jake Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain), George Clooney (Syriana, Good Night and Good Luck), Matt Dillon, Don Cheadle (Crash))\n\n2002 (Christopher Walken (Catch Me if You Can), Chris Cooper (Adaptation), Paul Newman (Road to Perdition), Ed Harris (Hours), Alfred Molina (Frida))\n\n2008 (Heath Ledger (Dark Knight), Philip Seymour Hoffman (Doubt), Brad Pitt (Burn After Reading), Brendan Gleason (In Bruges), Robert Downey (Tropic Thunder))\n\n2010 (Geoffrey Rush (King’s Speech), Christian Bale (Fighter), Mark Ruffalo (The Kids Are All Right), Andrew Garfield (Social Network), Pete Postlethwaite (Town))\n\n2007 (Javier Bardem (No Country), Tom Wilkinson (Michael Clayton), Tommy Lee Jones (No Country), Philip Seymour Hoffman (Charlie Wilson’s War), Paul Dano (There Will Be Blood))\n\nYears in Which the Worst of the Nominees Won the BAFTA:\n\n1975: Fred Astaire (The Towering Inferno) over Jack Warden, Burgess Meredith, Martin Balsam\n\n1977: Edward Fox (A Bridge Too Far) over Robert Duvall, Zero Mostel, Colin Blakely\n\n1986: Ray McAnally (The Mission) over Denholm Elliott, Klaus Maria Bandeur, Simon Callow\n\n1989: Ray McAnally (My Left Foot) over Jack Nicholson, Sean Connery, Marlon Brando\n\n1995: Tim Roth (Rob Roy) over Martin Landau, Alan Rickman, Ian Holm\n\n1998: Geoffrey Rush (Elizabeth) over Ed Harris, Geoffrey Rush, Tom Wilkinson\n\nnote: Of these, the two McAnally performances are by far the best but are stuck in stronger years.\n\nKudos to the BAFTAs – the best performances nominated by the BAFTAs but no one else:\n\nAnthony Hopkins, The Lion in Winter, 1968\n\nAlan Rickman, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, 1991\n\nHugh Bonneville, Iris, 2001\n\nJerry Lewis, King of Comedy, 1983\n\nBrad Pitt, Burn After Reading, 2008\n\nThe BAFTAs Being Different\n\nMelvyn Douglas, Being There, 1979 – Wins the Oscar, Globe, NYFC, LAFC.

Fails to even get nominated at BAFTA.\n\nSean Connery, The Untouchables, 1987 – Wins Oscar, Globe and NBR. Loses BAFTA in spite of being Scottish.\n\nMartin Landau, Ed Wood, 1994 – Wins five critics awards, Oscar, Globe and the initial SAG award. Loses BAFTA.\n\nTim Robbins, Mystic River, 2003 – Wins Oscar, SAG, Globe, BFCA, CFC. Loses BAFTA, losing chance to become first actor to sweep all five awards groups.\n\nThomas Haden Church, Sideways, 2004 – Earns 396 points, fourth highest Consensus total to-date. No BAFTA nom.\n\nChristian Bale, The Fighter, 2010 – Breaks what would have been a five year streak of actors sweeping the awards groups when Bale loses BAFTA to Geoffrey Rush.\n\nThe Golden Globes\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Golden Globes, unlike the Oscars or BAFTAs started giving supporting awards from their first year. The Globes felt free to go their own way with only one of the first four Globe winners and three of the first ten also winning the Oscar. It wouldn’t be until 1949 that the Globes would start having nominees and not just winners and there wouldn’t be regular nominations in the category (as with most categories) until 1956. Since then, in most years, there have been five nominees, with the exceptions of 1962 and 1963 when the limits in all categories seemed to be off and the occasional year when there would be six nominees (eight times from 1968 to 2003, including three straight years of 1988 to 1990).\n\nStarting in the mid 50’s, agreements with the Oscars became more common (four times in six years) but then they went their separate ways for a while with four straight Globe winners in the mid 60’s who didn’t even earn Oscar noms. But, since 1968 only once has a Globe winner failed to earn an Oscar nom (Richard Benjamin, The Sunshine Boys, 1975) and many actors win both. It’s worth noting that three Oscar winners (Peter Ustinov, Topkapi, 1964; Walter Matthau, The Sunshine Boys, 1966; George Burns, The Sunshine Boys, 1975) earned nominations for Actor – Comedy and four other Oscar nominees have been nominated as leads at the Globes (two in each). I won’t provide a list of all the nominees, but you can find one here.\n\nMultiple Nominations:\n\nThirteen films have earned two nominations for Supporting Actor. The first two to do so both lost both nominations (Spartacus, The Hustler) but the next three all won the award (The Sand Pebbles, They Shoot Horses Don’t They, Ryan’s Daughter). Then there would be three more which would lose both (The Great Gatsby, Dog Day Afternoon, Julia) and two more that would win (Ordinary People, An Officer and a Gentleman). Since then, three more films have lost both (Bugsy, The Departed, Tropic Thunder). Of those 13, only four would also earn Oscar noms for both actors (The Hustler, Julia, Ordinary People, Bugsy).\n\nGenres:\n\nDrama dominates the award (over half of all the nominations and wins). But every genre has had at least a touch. Every genre has had at least one nomination (Fantasy has just one, Adventure, Kids and Sci-Fi have two each). Fantasy, Adventure and Horror (five noms) are the only genres that have never won (Sci-Fi won in 1995 with Brad Pitt, 12 Monkeys). Kids actually won both times it was nominated (Edmund Gwenn, The Miracle on 34th Street, 1947 and Richard Attenborough, 1967, Doctor Dolittle). War has done the best, winning seven of its 13 nominations.\n\nBest Picture:\n\nFifteen films have won the Globe for Picture and Supporting Actor (five in Comedy / Musical, ten in Drama) but Dreamgirls is the only film since Platoon in 1986 to do so. Before that the longest gap was 1948 to 1959 but that was countered by four out of five years with winners matching. In total, 46 films have won Picture and earned a Supporting Actor nom. The longest streak of Picture winners without a Supporting Actor nom was 1987-90. Another 100 films have been nominated for both Picture and Supporting Actor. Almost half of Supporting Actor nominated films earned a Picture nom. Given the number of Best Picture nominees at the Globes, it might be surprising that there are more years where none of the Supporting Actor nominees came from Picture nominees than at the Oscars (twice – 2001, 2008) and only once have all five nominees come from Picture nominees and that was in 1980 when two of the nominees were from Ordinary People. There have also twice been sets of consecutive years with only one overlapping film each year (1987-88, 1995-96).\n\nForeign Films:\n\nLike with the Oscars, there have been nominations in which the character spoke primarily a language other than English (Benicio del Toro in Traffic, who won and Ken Watanabe in The Last Samurai) but there have been no nominations from a Foreign language film. Three films were Foreign Film nominated but they were all English language Foreign films (War and Peace, Tom Jones, Othello).\n\nSingle Nominations:\n\nA whopping 81 films have earned one nomination for Supporting Actor and no other Globe nominations (plus Tropic Thunder which earned two). Of those, 15 films actually won the Globe, a very high amount. The only film to do this at the Globes and Oscars is Beginners. It happened five times in the 50’s and at least once every decade since.\n\nOther Categories:\n\nNot surprisingly, by far Picture is the category most often nominated with Supporting Actor (146 times). Supporting Actress is by far the fewest among the major categories (just 67 films have been nominated for both). But among overlapping winners, it’s Actress that doesn’t go with Supporting Actor. Only three films have won both awards (Cabaret, Ordinary People, Terms of Endearment), the same number of films that won both Supporting Actor and Song (Cabaret, Arthur, An Officer and a Gentleman).\n\nThe Golden Globes Top 8:\n\nJack Nicholson – 180\n\nEd Harris – 150\n\nEdmund Gwenn – 120\n\nEdmond O’Brien – 120\n\nRichard Attenborough – 120\n\nRed Buttons – 120\n\nMartin Landau – 120\n\nsixteen actors – 90\n\nnote: Wins are worth 60 points and nominations are worth 30.\n\nnote: Nicholson and Harris have one win each. Of the other five, only Buttons doesn’t have two wins (he has a win and two other noms).\n\nTop 5 Globe Winners:\n\nGene Hackman (Unforgiven)\n\nMartin Landau (Ed Wood)\n\nDenzel Washington (Glory)\n\nWalter Huston (Treasure of the Sierra Madre)\n\nHeath Ledger (The Dark Knight)\n\nWorst 5 Globe Winners:\n\nRichard Attenborough (Doctor Dolittle)\n\nStephen Boyd (Ben Hur)\n\nEarl Holliman (The Rainmaker)\n\nEdmond O’Brien (Seven Days in May)\n\nOskar Werner (The Spy Who Came in from the Cold)\n\nWorst 5 Globe Nominees:\n\nScott Wilson (The Ninth Configuration)\n\nSteven Bauer (Scarface)\n\nNeil Patrick Harris (Clara’s Heart)\n\nRichard Attenborough (Doctor Dolittle)\n\nBruce Dern (The Great Gatsby)\n\n10 Best Performances Not Nominated for the Globe:\n\nKevin Kline (A Fish Called Wanda)\n\nMandy Patinken (The Princess Bride)\n\nMichael Sheen (The Queen)\n\nRobert De Niro (The Godfather Part II)\n\nAnthony Hopkins (The Lion in Winter)\n\nKevin Spacey (L.A.

That award was split in a major way with the award going to both Ed Harris (Apollo 13 / Nixon) and Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects / Seven / Swimming with Sharks). They clearly were taking the approach that critics awards did and that continued in 1998 when Billy Bob Thornton won for both Primary Colors and A Simple Plan and 2000 when Joaquin Phoenix won for Gladiator, Quills and The Yards. While Harris won SAG and Spacey won the Oscar and the second winner, Cuba Gooding (Jerry Maguire) won both, the next five winners failed to win either award (or the Globe) though several of them won critics awards. But, since 2002 the only winner not to win either the SAG or Oscar was the Consensus winner (Thomas Haden Church, Sideways, 2004).\n\nFor the first six years there were no nominees, simply a winner (often for multiple films). But, starting in 2001, they expanded to three nominees. That was followed by moving to five nominees in 2003 and, with a couple of exceptions, six nominees starting in 2005. It took until 2004 before the BFCA nominated someone with no other nominations (in 2004, Peter Sarsgaard for Kinsey) and since then, with starts and gaps, it has remained at about an average of one per year.\n\nThere is no point in doing a BFCA points list because through 2011, no one has more than 60 points. There have been 18 winners and two actors who have earned two nominations without a win (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Alfred Molina).\n\nLowest Critical Acclaim for a BFCA Winner: Anthony Hopkins, Amistad, 1997\n\nHighest Critical Acclaim for a BFCA nominee: Jim Broadbent, Iris, 2001\n\nLowest Critical Acclaim for a BFCA nominee: Peter Sarsgaard, Kinsey, 2004\n\nHighest Critical Acclaim for a BFCA snub: Benicio del Toro, Traffic, 2000\n\nHighest Critical Acclaim for a BFCA snub (post-2000, when nominations began): Christopher Walken, Catch Me if You Can, 2002\n\nBest Performance by a BFCA snub: Michael Sheen, The Queen, 2006\n\nBest BFCA Nominee Not Nominated by Any Other Group: Peter Sarsgaard, Kinsey, 2004\n\nWorst BFCA Winner: Joaquin Phoenix, Gladiator / Quills / The Yards, 2000\n\nThe Screen Actors Guild\n\nSummary:\n\nThe SAG Awards began in 1994, rather late in the game for guild awards. That first year, they were very similar to the Oscars, with the same winner and four of the same nominees (the fifth nominee for each was from the same film). But the next year they disagreed on the winner and in 1995 and 1996 only two SAG nominees each earned Oscar noms. It would be the last of the acting categories to have a year match 5 for 5 and that was really 5 for 6 because it was 2000 when the SAG winner for Actor won the Oscar for Supporting Actor. It would take until 2006, the year that SAG and Oscars matched perfectly in all four categories for them to agree again. SAG also goes less for the same actors as only Chris Cooper has managed more than two nominations (two of those didn’t earn him Oscar noms and the third won him the Oscar but not SAG). In the early years, SAG often went its own route. Through 2004, nine times an actor earned a SAG nomination and nothing else. Since then, that has only happened once (Armie Hammer, J. Edgar, 2011).\n\nLowest Critical Acclaim for a SAG Winner: Robert Duvall, A Civil Action, 1998\n\nHighest Critical Acclaim for a SAG nominee: Kevin Spacey, The Usual Suspects, 1995\n\nLowest Critical Acclaim for a SAG nominee: Chris Cooper, Seabiscuit, 2003\n\nHighest Critical Acclaim for a SAG snub: Edward Norton, Primal Fear, 1996\n\nBest Performance by a SAG snub: Michael Sheen, The Queen, 2006\n\nBest SAG Nominee Not Nominated by Any Other Group: Kenneth Branagh, Othello, 1995\n\nWorst SAG Winner: Robert Duvall, A Civil Action, 1998\n\nThe SAG Top 4:\n\nBenicio del Toro – 100\n\nEd Harris – 90\n\nChris Cooper – 90\n\nChristopher Plummer – 90\n\nnote: Del Toro has 100 because he won Actor for Traffic. Cooper has three nominations but the other three have one win and one nomination each.\n\nThe Critics Awards\n\nSummary:\n\nThough the National Board of Review and New York Film Critics had both begun in the 30’s, neither would establish a Supporting award for quite a while. The NBR would be first, starting in 1954 and they would continue the tradition that both groups had used in other awards of rewarding a year’s worth of work rather an individual film. The first award went to John Williams for Sabrina and Dial M for Murder. It would take until 1957 for an Oscar nominee to win the award and until 1959 for an Oscar winner to win. But most of the early NBR winners weren’t nominated for either the Globe or the Oscar. The National Society of Film Critics were established in 1966 and began giving supporting awards the next year, awarding Gene Hackman for Bonnie and Clyde. Two years later, Jack Nicholson (Easy Rider) won the initial NYFC Award and also won the NSFC making him the first to win two awards.\n\n1971 seemed to be a turning point for the NBR. Before that, only five of the first seventeen winners earned Oscar noms and only two won both awards (Melvn Douglas, Hud, 1963 was the other). But, starting in 1971, when Ben Johnson became the first person to win both the NBR and NYFC (and the first to win five total awards) that changed. In the 40 years since, only seven NBR winners have failed to earn an Oscar nom and only one since 1989 (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Magnolia / Talented Mr. Ripley, 1999). Jason Robards (All the President’s Men, 1976) became the first to win all three critics awards a year before the LA Film Critics started giving their own awards. The Boston Society of Film Critics began their own awards in 1980. In 1983, Jack Nicholson (Terms of Endearment) became the first to win all five critics awards. The Chicago Film Critics would make it six critics groups starting in 1988 but through 2011, no actor has swept all six awards. Three actors have won five of the awards with the NBR being the lone hold out for Martin Landau (Ed Wood, 1994) and Christoph Waltz (Inglourious Basterds, 2009) and the NYFC the hold out against Thomas Haden Church (Sideways, 2004).\n\nMultiple Wins:\n\nOnly two actors have won the award from every group. The first is Jack Nicholson who was won three NBR, two NYFC, NSFC and BSFC and one each of the LAFC and CFC. The other is Joe Pesci who won the NYFC and NSFC for Raging Bull, the same two groups that didn’t give him the award for GoodFellas (he won the NBR for both as well).\n\nMultiple Films:\n\nThis has been a consistent mark of all the critics groups except the Chicago Film Critics for this award but the groups don’t always agree. It also can lead to some confusion and hesitation among film studios as to what to promote. For instance, in 1986, Dennis Hopper won the LAFC for both Blue Velvet and Hoosiers but won the NSFC and BSFC just for Blue Velvet (he was Globe nominated for both) but it was Hoosiers that earned the Oscar nom. In 2001, in spite of the Best Picture nomination for Moulin Rouge, Jim Broadbent earned his Oscar for Iris (he won the NBR and LAFC for both). And the groups don’t always agree. In 1995, Kevin Spacey won the NYFC for The Usual Suspects, Seven, Swimming with Sharks and Outbreak, he won the NBR for just The Usual Suspects and Seven and the BSFC and CFC just for Usual Suspects.\n\nForeign Films:\n\nFour Foreign language performances have won awards. Holger Löwenadler won both the NSFC and the NBR for Lacombe Lucien (1974). Charles Boyer won the NYFC, also in 1974, for Stavisky. More recently, the LAFC have twice given the award to Foreign performances (Vlad Ivanov, 4 Months 3 Weeks and Two Days, 2007; Niels Arestrup, A Prophet, 2010).\n\nOther Awards:\n\nThe NBR, which has the longest history, also has the highest likelihood of giving the award without giving the film any other awards. In almost 60 years, 20 films have won the award while winning no other awards, either from the NBR or any other group. This also speaks to the Consensus Awards. Seven of the NBR winners in the 60’s earned no other awards at the Consensus Awards. On average, one NYFC winner per decade earns no other Consensus points and the NSFC has about the same rate. From 1980 to 1997, only one BSFC winner failed to earn any other points (Ian Holm in 1985) but then it happened three times from 1998 to 2002. However, in the whole history of the CFC, only Mickey Rourke (Sin City, 2005) failed to earn any other Consensus points and in the even longer history of the LAFC, only Vlad Ivanov failed to earn any other Consensus points.\n\nThe Critics Top 10:\n\nJack Nicholson – 588\n\nMartin Landau – 384\n\nJoe Pesci – 372\n\nGene Hackman – 282\n\nChristoph Waltz – 276\n\nChristopher Plummer – 276\n\nKevin Spacey – 264\n\nThomas Haden Church – 264\n\nJohn Gielgud – 234\n\nBurt Reynolds – 222\n\nBest by Group\n\nNYFC: Ralph Fiennes (Schindler’s List, 1993)\n\nLAFC: Gene Hackman (Unforgiven, 1992)\n\nNSFC: Al Pacino (The Godfather, 1972) *\n\nBSFC: Ralph Fiennes (Schindler’s List, 1993)\n\nCFC: Ralph Fiennes (Schindler’s List, 1993)\n\nNBR: Al Pacino (The Godfather, 1972)\n\nnote: Pacino actually won for Actor. If you don’t want to count it, it’s Fiennes again.\n\nWorst by Group\n\nNYFC: Charles Boyer (Stavisky, 1974)\n\nLAFC: John Lithgow (The World According to Garp, 1982) *\n\nNSFC: Edward Fox (A Bridge Too Far, 1977)\n\nBSFC: Mickey Rourke (Diner, 1982)\n\nCFC: Mickey Rourke (Sin City, 2005)\n\nNBR: Charles Bickford (Not as a Stranger, 1955)\n\nnote: I don’t count performances when there are multiple performances cited. For instance, I rank Bill Murray’s performance in Wild Things lower than Lithgow’s, but since Murray was also cited for Rushmore, I won’t knock the extra film I feel the critics threw in there.\n\n10 Best Performances that Didn’t Win any Critics Award (post-1967):\n\nIan McKellen (The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, 2001)\n\nAlec Guinness (Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, 1977)\n\nDenzel Washington (Glory, 1989)\n\nRobert Duvall (Apocalypse Now, 1979)\n\nKevin Kline (A Fish Called Wanda, 1988)\n\nWilliam H. Macy (Fargo, 1996)\n\nMandy Patinkin (The Princess Bride, 1987)\n\nRobert De Niro (The Godfather Part II, 1974)\n\nAnthony Hopkins (The Lion in Winter, 1968)\n\nHenry Fonda (Once Upon a Time in the West, 1969)\n\n5 Most Acclaimed Post-1967 Performances to not Win a Critics Award (based on Consensus Awards percentage):\n\nJohn Mills, 1970, Ryan’s Daughter\n\nHaing S. Ngor, 1984, The Killing Fields\n\nRobert Duvall, 1979, Apocalypse Now\n\nFred Astaire, 1974, The Towering Inferno\n\nGeorge Kennedy, 1967, Cool Hand Luke\n\nnote: Originally, the list was all from the stretch from 1954 to 1966 when only the NBR gave out awards so I made it only after the NSFC added a second award (and added more total Consensus points).\n\nLeast Acclaimed Performances to Win the Critics by Group\n\nNYFC: Eugene Levy (A Mighty Wind, 2003)\n\nLAFC: Vlad Ivanov (4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days, 2007)\n\nNSFC: Eddie Marsan (Happy-Go-Lucky, 2008)\n\nBSFC: Fred Willard (Best in Show, 2000)\n\nCFC: Mickey Rourke (Sin City, 2005)\n\nNBR: Philip Seymour Hoffman (Magnolia / The Talented Mr. Ripley, 1999)\n\nnote: Basically, because of the larger total amount of Consensus points the more recent you get, these are all the most recent examples of a winner with no other Consensus points.\n\nMost Critically Acclaimed Performance Snubbed by a Critics Group:\n\nNYFC: Heath Ledger (The Dark Knight, 2008)\n\nLAFC: Ralph Fiennes (Schindler’s List, 1993)\n\nNSFC: Heath Ledger (The Dark Knight, 2008)\n\nBSFC: Joe Pesci (Raging Bull, 1980)\n\nCFC: Gene Hackman (Unforgiven, 1992)\n\nNBR: Gene Hackman (Unforgiven, 1992)\n\nCritical Oddities:\n\nnote: These are the performances that won multiple Critics Awards but failed to earn nominations from any of the awards groups. Except for Daniel Day-Lewis (who came in 3rd), they all came in 2nd at the Consensus.\n\nChristopher Plummer (The Insider, 1999)\n\nLAFC, NSFC, BSFC\n\nRobert De Niro (Mean Streets / Bang the Drum Slowly, 1973)\n\nNYFC, NSFC\n\nHolger Lowenadler (Lacombe Lucien, 1974)\n\nNSFC, NBR\n\nMickey Rourke (Diner, 1982)\n\nNSFC, BSFC\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis (My Beautiful Laundrette, A Room with a View, 1986)\n\nNYFC, NBR\n\nGoing First Has Disadvantages – The NBR Being Different:\n\n1991 – The NBR gives Supporting Actor to Anthony Hopkins for Silence of the Lambs before the other groups decide he’s a lead.\n\n1992 – Jack Nicholson wins for A Few Good Men before Gene Hackman sweeps almost all other awards (except CFC) for Unforgiven.\n\n1994 – Gary Sinise wins for Forrest Gump while the other five critics groups (and the Oscar, Globe and SAG) go to Martin Landau for Ed Wood.\n\n2007 / 2008 – Javier Bardem and Heath Ledger both fail to win the NBR, one of only two critics groups that each fail to win.\n\n2009 – Becomes the only group not to give an award to Christoph Waltz, instead awarding Woody Harrelson for The Messenger.\n\nThe Nighthawk Awards\n\nnote: Because my awards go, retroactively, all the way back through 1912, there are a lot more nominees and winners than in the other awards. But I don’t always have a full slate of nominees and some years I don’t have any nominees.\n\nMultiple Nominations:\n\nThe Godfather is the king, with four nominees (and the win). Three films earn three nominations and all also win: Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, On the Waterfront, The Godfather Part II. There are 16 more that win the Nighthawk and earn a second nomination, all of which at least earn a Best Picture nomination except Thirteen Days.\n\nDirectors:\n\nDavid Lean is on top here. His films have earned 450 points with 12 nominated performances from 8 different films with three of them winning (Sesue Hayakawa, Omar Sharif, Tom Courteney). He’s followed by Francis Ford Coppola (390 points, 10 nominees from 5 films, 3 wins – Pacino, De Niro, Duvall) and Martin Scorsese (360 points, 9 nominees from 8 films, wins for De Niro and Pesci (twice)). After that, there are 270 points each for William Wyler, Sidney Lumet and Akira Kurosawa as well as 240 each for Billy Wilder, Alan J. Pakula and Elia Kazan. Amazingly enough, the only directors to direct consecutive winners are Archie Mayo (1936, 1937) and Michael Curtiz (1942, 1943).\n\nSequels:\n\nA number of sequels earn nominations so what makes the performances of Sean Astin and Andy Serkis in Return of the King different? That’s because they are the only two performers reprising roles to earn nominations. For all other sequel performances that earn nominations (like, say, Robert De Niro in The Godfather Part II or Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight), they weren’t in the previous films.\n\nGenres:\n\nDrama accounts for almost exactly half of all the nominations (194 films out of 390). Kids is the only genre without at least three nominations (it has two) and is also the only genre without a win. Drama has the most wins with the only drought of more than 6 years coming from 1985 to 1993. Crime (1972-74) is the only other genre to have more than a two year win streak.\n\nBest Picture:\n\nOf the 390 films nominated for Supporting Actor, 56 of them win Best Picture (out of 85 total) and 119 more are Picture nominees. The longest streak of Picture winners with a Supporting Actor nomination is 1950-57 and the longest drought is 1933-37. From 1950 to 1954, there are five straight films that win both Picture and Supporting Actor. The only year where no Supporting Actor nominees come from Picture nominees is 1933. In 1972 all the Supporting Actor nominees come from Picture nominees but four of them are from The Godfather.\n\nForeign Film:\n\nThere are 26 Foreign films that at least earn a Nighthawk nomination for Supporting Actor. Seven of those films win the Nighthawk including three Toshiro Mifune performances (Rashomon, The Seven Samurai, High and Low). Erich von Stroheim wins the Nighthawk for a Foreign performance (The Grand Illusion) and then later wins one in English (Sunset Blvd).\n\nSingle Nominations:\n\nThere are 48 films that earn a Supporting Actor nomination and no other nominations. Of those 48, only one of them wins the Nighthawk: Alan Rickman for Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991).\n\nOther Categories:\n\nAside from Animated Film (no overlap), the categories least likely to overlap with Supporting Actor are Foreign Film (25), Song (32) and Visual Effects (33). It’s most likely to overlap with Picture (176), Director (167), Supporting Actress (142) and Actor (137).\n\nMy Top 10\n\nClaude Rains – 390\n\nGene Hackman – 210\n\nToshiro Mifune – 180\n\nAlec Guinness – 180\n\nJack Nicholson – 180\n\nCharles Laughton – 150\n\nErich von Stroheim – 150\n\nRobert Ryan – 150\n\nRobert De Niro – 150\n\nJason Robards / Michael Caine – 150\n\nMy Top 10 Drama\n\nClaude Rains – 390\n\nToshiro Mifune – 210\n\nGene Hackman – 180\n\nJack Nicholson – 180\n\nCharles Laughton – 150\n\nThomas Mitchell – 150\n\nErich von Stroheim – 150\n\nRobert De Niro – 150\n\nRobert Duvall – 150\n\nAlec Guinness / Ian Holm – 150\n\nMy Top 10 Comedy\n\nEdward Everett Horton – 180\n\nWilliam Demarest – 150\n\nMichael Caine – 150\n\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman – 150\n\nBill Murray – 150\n\nJohn Mills – 120\n\nGene Wilder – 120\n\nJack Warden – 120\n\n16 actors – 90\n\nMy Top 10 Weighted Points\n\nClaude Rains – 469\n\nAlec Guinness – 292\n\nIan Holm – 236\n\nJack Nicholson – 236\n\nToshiro Mifune – 232\n\nMichael Caine – 232\n\nGene Hackman – 228\n\nThomas Mitchell – 210\n\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman – 209\n\nRobert Ryan / Robert Duvall – 208\n\nnote: This based on a scale from 20-1 based on Top 20 placement at the Nighthawks. A win is worth 60 points in Supporting Actor, a 20th place finish is worth 1 point (if the list goes a full 20).\n\nMy Top 10 Absolute Points List:\n\nClaude Rains – 470\n\nMichael Caine – 470\n\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman – 408\n\nAlec Guinness – 350\n\nIan Holm – 343\n\nRobert Duvall – 321\n\nAlan Rickman – 319\n\nIan McKellen – 305\n\nMorgan Freeman – 298\n\nJack Nicholson – 290\n\nnote: This is a point scale based on their performance points, not where they finished in the year. It benefits someone like Alan Rickman who had ten Top 10 finishes over the years (all in strong years) but only earned three Nighthawk nominations.
