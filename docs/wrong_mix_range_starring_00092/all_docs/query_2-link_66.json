        "text": "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — Steven Spielberg has matched his personal best at the Academy Awards: 12 nominations for his Civil War saga “Lincoln,” including best picture, director and acting honors for Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones.\n\nThat ties the 12 nominations for his 1993 drama “Schindler’s List,” which won seven Oscars, including best picture and director.\n\nAlso among the nine nominees for best picture Thursday: the old-age love story “Amour” ; the Iran hostage thriller “Argo” ; the independent hit “Beasts of the Southern Wild” ; the slave-revenge narrative “Django Unchained” ; the musical “Les Miserables” ; the shipwreck story “Life of Pi” ; the lost-souls romance “Silver Linings Playbook” ; and the Osama bin Laden manhunt chronicle “Zero Dark Thirty.”\n\n“Life of Pi” surprisingly ran second with 11 nominations, ahead of “Zero Dark Thirty” and “Les Miserables,” which had been considered potential front-runners.\n\n“I thought we’d get a few, so this is really great for us,” said “Life of Pi” director Ang Lee. “Eleven really surprised me. But it’s a good surprise. I’m very happily surprised.”\n\nMore surprising were snubs in the directing category, where three favorites missed out: Ben Affleck for “Argo” and past Oscar winners Kathryn Bigelow for “Zero Dark Thirty” and Tom Hooper for “Les Miserables.” Bigelow was the first woman ever the win the directing Oscar for 2009’s “The Hurt Locker,” while Hooper won a year later for “The King’s Speech.”\n\nThe best-picture category also had surprising omissions. The acclaimed first-love tale “Moonrise Kingdom” was left out and only got one nomination, for original screenplay. Also snubbed for best-picture was “The Master,” a critical favorite that did manage three acting nominations, for Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams and Philip Seymour Hoffman.\n\nTwo-time winner Spielberg earned his seventh directing nomination, and also in the mix are past winner Lee for “Life of Pi” and past nominee David O. Russell for “Silver Linings Playbook.” The other slots went to surprise picks who are first-time nominees: Michael Haneke for his French-language “Amour” and Benh Zeitlin for “Beasts of the Southern Wild.”\n\nOscar directing contenders often are identical or at least usually line up closely with those for the Directors Guild of America Awards. But only Spielberg and Lee made both lists this time. The Directors Guild also nominated Affleck, Bigelow and Hooper, but not Haneke, Russell or Zeitlin.\n\nHaneke’s “Amour” also was a best-picture surprise. The film, which won the top prize at last May’s Cannes Film Festival, mainly had been considered a favorite in the foreign-language category, where it also was nominated. “Amour” had five nominations, including original screenplay and best-actress for Emmanuelle Riva.\n\n“It is fulfilling to discover that a film has found the audience and critical acclaim that ‘Amour’ has garnered,” Haneke said. “I have been very fortunate on both those fronts, but it is especially rewarding to discover that a film has found favor among one’s industry peers who know, in particular, the effort that goes into getting a film — any film — made.”\n\nThe year’s second-biggest box-office hit, “The Dark Knight Rises,” was shut out entirely, even for visual effects. The omission of its predecessor, “The Dark Knight,” from best-picture consideration for 2008 was largely responsible for the expansion of the Oscar category from five nominees to 10 the following year. “The Dark Knight” had earned eight nominations and won two Oscars.\n\nChronicling Abraham Lincoln’s final months as he engineers passage of the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery, “Lincoln” stars best-actor contender Day-Lewis in a monumental performance as the 16th president, supporting-actress nominee Field as the notoriously headstrong Mary Todd Lincoln and supporting-actor prospect Jones as abolitionist firebrand Thaddeus Stevens.\n\nJoining Day-Lewis in the best-actor field are Bradley Cooper as a psychiatric patient trying to get his life back together in “Silver Linings Playbook” ; Hugh Jackman as Victor Hugo’s tragic hero Jean Valjean in “Les Miserables” ; Phoenix as a Navy vet who falls in with a cult in “The Master” ; and Denzel Washington as a boozy airline pilot in “Flight.”\n\nCooper had been a bit of a longshot. John Hawkes, a potential best-actor favorite, missed out for his role as a man in an iron lung aiming to lose his virginity in “The Sessions.”\n\nNominated for best actress are Jessica Chastain as a CIA operative hunting bin Laden in “Zero Dark Thirty” ; Jennifer Lawrence as a troubled young widow struggling to heal in “Silver Linings Playbook” ; Riva as an ailing woman tended by her husband in “Amour” ; Quvenzhane Wallis as a spirited girl on the Louisiana delta in “Beasts of the Southern Wild” ; and Naomi Watts as a mother caught up in a devastating tsunami in “The Impossible.”\n\nBest actress had a wild age range: Riva is the oldest nominee ever in the category at 85, while Wallis is the youngest ever at 9.\n\nAlong with Field, supporting-actress nominees are Adams as a cult leader’s devoted wife in “The Master” ; Anne Hathaway as an outcast mother reduced to prostitution in “Les Miserables” ; Helen Hunt as a sex surrogate in “The Sessions” ; and Jacki Weaver as an unstable man’s doting mom in “Silver Linings Playbook.”\n\nBesides Jones, the supporting-actor contenders are Alan Arkin as a wily Hollywood producer in “Argo” ; Robert De Niro as a football-obsessed patriarch in “Silver Linings Playbook” ; Hoffman as a dynamic cult leader in “The Master” ; and Christoph Waltz as a genteel bounty hunter in “Django Unchained.”\n\n“Family Guy” creator Seth MacFarlane, who will host the Feb. 24 Oscars, joined Emma Stone to announce the Oscar lineup, and he scored a nomination himself. He’s up for original song for “Everybody Needs a Best Friend,” the tune he co-wrote for his big-screen directing debut “Ted.”\n\n“That’s kind of cool I got nominated,” MacFarlane deadpanned at the announcement. “I get to go to the Oscars.”\n\nWalt Disney predictably dominated the animated-feature category with three of the five nominees: “Brave,” “Frankenweenie” and “Wreck-It Ralph.” Also nominated were “ParaNorman” and “The Pirates! Band of Misfits.”\n\n“I’m absolutely blown away,” “Wreck-It Ralph” director Rich Moore said. “It is weird at 5:30 in the morning to hear Emma Stone say your name. It’s surreal.”\n\n“Lincoln” is Spielberg’s best awards prospect since his critical peak in the 1990s, when he won best-picture and directing Oscars for “Schindler’s List” and a second directing Oscar for “Saving Private Ryan.”\n\nSpielberg’s latest film could vault him, Day-Lewis and Field to new heights among Hollywood’s super-elite of multiple Oscar winners.\n\nA best-picture win for “Lincoln” would be Spielberg’s second, while another directing win would be his third, a feat achieved only by Frank Capra and William Wyler, who each earned three directing Oscars, and John Ford, who received four.\n\n“Lincoln” also was the ninth best-picture nominee Spielberg has directed, moving him into a tie for second-place with Ford. Only Wyler directed more best-picture nominees, with 13.\n\nDay-Lewis and Field both have two lead-acting Oscars already, he for “My Left Foot” and “There Will Be Blood” and she for “Norma Rae” and “Places in the Heart.” A third Oscar for either would put them in rare company with previous triple winners Ingrid Bergman, Walter Brennan, Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep. Katharine Hepburn is the record-holder with four acting Oscars.\n\nAn Oscar for Jones would be his second supporting-actor prize; he previously won for “The Fugitive.”\n\n“Lincoln” composer John Williams — whose five Oscars include three for the music of three earlier Spielberg films, “Jaws,” “E.T. the Extra-terrestrial” and “Schindler’s List” — earned his 43rd nomination for best score, extending his all-time record in the category.\n\nThe Oscars feature a best-picture field that ranges from five to 10 films depending on a complex formula of ballots from the 5,856 voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nNominations in most categories are decided by ballots from members of specific academy branches — such as directors, writers or actors. All members are eligible to vote for best-picture nominees, and the entire academy can vote in every category for the actual Oscars, whose balloting begins Feb. 8.\n\nWinners for the 85th Oscars will be announced Feb. 24 at a ceremony aired live on ABC from Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre.\n\nComplete list of 85th Annual Academy Award nominations announced Thursday: 1.
