        "text": "Rating: 4 out of 5 stars\n\nGenre: Documentary\n\nRun Time: 1 hour, 24 minutes, Rated PG\n\nFeaturing: Jeff Bridges, Tom Colicchio, James McGovern, Raj Patel\n\nDirected by Kristi Jacobson (Toots, American Standoff) and Lori Silverbush (On the Outs)\n\n​Motion pictures, or video, can be used as powerful tools when yielded as such. When effectively done, there is no greater instrument of change than the documentary. Usually documentaries - especially politically-themed ones - are measured by how impactful they are, how accurate they are and how inclusive the message is. In other words, the film has got to have meaning, be told using facts and - in my humble opinion - told in a way that seems to include opposing points of view, so that when shown all together, the viewer can make the best judgment possible and then hopefully take action. In \"A Place at the Table,\" a new film opening today about the hunger epidemic in America, all - or at least most - of these vital components are there.\n\n20th Century Fox, 2013.\n\nRating: 1 out of 5 stars\n\nGenre: Action, Thriller\n\nRun Time: 1 hour, 37 minutes, Rated R\n\nStarring: Bruce Willis, Jai Courtney, Sebastian Koch, Cole Hauser\n\nWritten by Skip Woods (The A-Team, X-Men Origins: Wolverine)\n\nDirected by John Moore (Max Payne, The Omen, Behind Enemy Lines)\n\n​On the heels of recent action movies featuring old-timers Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone, we get another action hero from years' past with Bruce Willis, reprising his role as John McClain in yet another installment in the Die Hard franchise. A Good Day to Die Hard is the fifth Die Hard film and hopefully the last.\n\nRating: 2 out of 5 stars\n\nGenre: Action, Crime, Thriller\n\nRun Time: 1 hour, 31 minutes, Rated R\n\nStarring: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Momoa, Sung Kang, Sarah Shahi, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Christian Slater\n\nBased on the graphic novel by Matz (Alexis Nolent)\n\nWritten by Alessandro Camon\n\nDirected by Walter Hill (Undisputed, Last Man Standing, Trespass, 48 Hours, Brewster's Millions)\n\n​Just weeks after Arnold Schwarzenegger headlined a blockbuster action flick (The Last Stand, a film that has since flopped), another throw-back leading man from years' past returns this weekend. In Bullet to the Head, Sylvester Stallone is the muscular old dude at the center of this one and once again, nostalgia for adrenaline-injected 1980's action heroes is not enough to save the movie from itself.\n\nRating: 2 out of 5 stars\n\nGenre: Comedy, Horror, Romance\n\nRun Time: 1 hour, 37 minutes, Rated PG-13\n\nStarring: Nicholas Hoult, Teresa Palmer, Analeigh Tipton, Rob Corddry, John Malkovich\n\nBased on the novel by Isaac Marion\n\nWritten & Directed by Jonathan Levine (50/50, The Wackness)\n\n​Zombies, for all intents and purposes, are a predictable bunch. They slowly drag their lifeless bodies around their post-apocalyptic environment, feasting on brains or any bit of human flesh they can find. They can be outsmarted, that's for sure, since they have pretty basic, animalistic instincts to feed, but not much going on upstairs. Ironically, the only way to kill most zombies is to destroy their brain, you know, the one part of their corpse that doesn't seem to be functioning in the first place."
