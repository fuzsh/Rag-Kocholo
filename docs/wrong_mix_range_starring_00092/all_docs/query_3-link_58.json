        "text": "Highest Rated: 97% Pig (2021)\n\nLowest Rated: 0% Under the Rainbow (1981)\n\nBirthday: Aug 19, 1956\n\nBirthplace: Brooklyn, New York, USA\n\nThe handsome son of acting legend Alan Arkin, Adam Arkin began his career as a child actor in small TV and film roles, culminating in his starring role in the werewolf comedy \"Full Moon High\" (1981). He earned an Emmy nomination for his recurring role as the barefoot, possibly feral chef Adam on \"Northern Exposure\" (CBS, 1990-95) and a 1991 Tony nod in Paul Rudnick's \"I Hate Hamlet.\" He starred on many short-lived series and earned a slew of recurring credits on projects like \"China Beach\" (ABC, 1988-1991) and \"Picket Fences\" (CBS, 1992-96), but landed a star-making role as the kind neurosurgeon Dr. Aaron Shutt on David E. Kelley's \"Chicago Hope\" (CBS, 1994-2000). On the big screen, he played Jamie Lee Curtis' boyfriend in \"Halloween H20: 20 Year Later\" (1998), Meg Ryan's husband in \"Hanging Up\" (2000), and a bystander to crocodile attacks at \"Lake Placid\" (1999). A Daytime Emmy-winning director, Arkin earned acclaim for a guest spot on \"Frasier\" (NBC, 1993-2004) and recurred on \"The West Wing\" (NBC, 1999-2006), \"8 Simple Rules\" (ABC, 2002-05), \"Boston Legal\" (ABC, 2004-08) and \"Sons of Anarchy\" (FX, 2008-14). The very employable actor made his pop proud, playing Eva Mendes' editor in \"Hitch\" (2005) and a divorce lawyer in the Ethan and Joel Coen drama \"A Serious Man\" (2009). A talented, constant presence across TV and film, Adam Arkin built a lengthy, impressive career outside of his father's considerable professional shadow.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n97% Pig\n\n91% The Sessions\n\n89% A Serious Man\n\n83% The Doctor\n\n69% Hitch 56% Halloween H20: 20 Years Later\n\n50% With Friends Like These...\n\n43% 10 Cent Pistol\n\nPhotos\n\nAdam Arkin Masters of Sex, Adam Arkin, 'Below the Belt', Season 2, Ep. #10, 09/14/2014, ©SHO Masters of Sex, Adam Arkin (L), Michael Sheen (R), 'Below the Belt', Season 2, Ep. #10, 09/14/2014, ©SHO Masters of Sex, Adam Arkin, 'Below the Belt', Season 2, Ep. #10, 09/14/2014, ©SHO Masters of Sex, Christian Borle (L), Adam Arkin (R), 'Below the Belt', Season 2, Ep. #10, 09/14/2014, ©SHO WITH FRIENDS LIKE THESE, bottom row from left: David Strathairn, Robert Costanzo, Adam Arkin, Jon Tenney, 1998, © Miramax FULL MOON HIGH, from left: Joanne Nail, Adam Arkin, 1981. ©Filmways Pictures CHU CHU AND THE PHILLY FLASH, from left: Adam Arkin, Carol Burnett, Alan Arkin, 1981. ©20th Century-Fox Film Corporation, TM & Copyright Life, Adam Arkin, 'Canyon Flowers', Season 2, Ep. #11, 12/10/2008, ©NBC Life, Adam Arkin, 'Canyon Flowers', Season 2, Ep. #11, 12/10/2008, ©NBC Life, Adam Arkin, 'Not For Nothing', Season 2, Ep. #4, 10/10/2008, ©NBC THE DOCTOR, William Hurt, Adam Arkin, 1991, (c)Buena Vista Pictures Modern Family, Adam Arkin (L), Ed O'Neill (R), 'Man Shouldn't Lie', Season 7, Ep. #19, 04/13/2016, ©ABC Modern Family, Ed O'Neill (L), Adam Arkin (R), 'Man Shouldn't Lie', Season 7, Ep. #19, 04/13/2016, ©ABC Modern Family, Adam Arkin (L), Ed O'Neill (R), 'Man Shouldn't Lie', Season 7, Ep. #19, 04/13/2016, ©ABC Modern Family, Adam Arkin (L), Ed O'Neill (R), 'Man Shouldn't Lie', Season 7, Ep. #19, 04/13/2016, ©ABC How To Get Away With Murder, Roxanne Hart (L), Adam Arkin (C), Wilson Bethel (R), 'It's a Trap', Season 2, Ep. #12, 02/25/2016, ©ABC How To Get Away With Murder, Roxanne Hart (L), Adam Arkin (C), Wilson Bethel (R), 'It's a Trap', Season 2, Ep. #12, 02/25/2016, ©ABC How To Get Away With Murder, from left: Roxanne Hart, Adam Arkin, Wilson Bethel, Viola Davis, 'It's a Trap', Season 2, Ep. #12, 02/25/2016, ©ABC How To Get Away With Murder, Roxanne Hart (L), Adam Arkin (C), Wilson Bethel (R), 'It's a Trap', Season 2, Ep. #12, 02/25/2016, ©ABC\n\nFilmography\n\nMovies\n\nCredit 97% 84% Pig Darius (Character) $3.1M 2021 43% 30% 10 Cent Pistol Nir Zir (Character) - 2014 No Score Yet 28% Armed Response Broomhall (Character) - 2013 91% 80% The Sessions Josh (Character) $6.0M 2012 No Score Yet 25% Tell-Tale Husband (Character) - 2010 No Score Yet 62% Summer Eleven Ron (Character) - 2010 No Score Yet 44% Just Peck Michael Peck (Character) - 2009 89% 68% A Serious Man Divorce Lawyer (Character) $9.2M 2009 0% 63% Graduation Dean Deeley (Character) - 2007 No Score Yet 60% Murder on Pleasant Drive John David Smith (Character) - 2006 17% 65% Kids in America Ed Mumsford (Character) $440.2K 2005 22% 62% Marilyn Hotchkiss' Ballroom Dancing and Charm School Gabe DiFranco (Character) $247.1K 2005 69% 62% Hitch Max (Character) $177.6M 2005 No Score Yet 97% Horatio's Drive: America's First Road Trip Unknown (Character) - 2003 No Score Yet 57% Damaged Care Paul Sheinberg (Character) - 2002 20% 55% Stark Raving Mad Don Partridge (Character) - 2002 No Score Yet No Score Yet Off Season Richard Frangello (Character) - 2001 No Score Yet 59% My Louisiana Sky Director - 2001 No Score Yet No Score Yet Mission Vissarion Belinsky (Character) - 2001 12% 34% Hanging Up Joe (Character) $36.0M 2000 No Score Yet No Score Yet East of A Sylvester (Character) - 2000 No Score Yet No Score Yet Dropping Out Scott Kayle (Character) - 2000 No Score Yet 67% A Slight Case of Murder Det.
