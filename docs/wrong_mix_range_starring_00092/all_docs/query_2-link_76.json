        "text": "Join us as we pay homage to some of the most notable figures in the realms of art and entertainment who bid us farewell over the past twelve months.\n\nIt's impossible to do justice to all the people who left an indelible mark on our lives either through their achievements, performances or strength of character but we wanted to celebrate the joy they spread and, the fun, fear, sadness or excitement they made us feel.\n\nFor more on the stars from the world of music who passed this year, from Shane MacGowan to Tina Turner, check out our tribute page.\n\nThe following names are listed chronologically by the dates of their deaths.\n\nLisa Loring (1958 - 2023)\n\nLisa Loring, who was the first actress to play Wednesday, the youngest member of the creepy, kooky, mysterious, spooky and ooky Addams Family, died aged 64.\n\nLoring played the princess of all things morbid from 1964 to 1966 in The Addams Family, the first adaptation of Charles Addams’ New Yorker cartoons.\n\nShe was just five years old when she was cast.\n\nPaco Rabanne (1934 - 2023)\n\nRenowned designer Paco Rabanne, one of the most seminal fashion figures of the 20th century, died aged 88.\n\nOver decades the Franco-Spanish couturier created memorable designs and developed several enticing scents that brought him success both on the catwalk and on the high streets, making him a household name.\n\nRaquel Welch (1940 -
