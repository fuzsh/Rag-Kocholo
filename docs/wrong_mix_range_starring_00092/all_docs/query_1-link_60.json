The film follows three generations of the Meyerowitz family, a creative bunch who all have […]\n\nMovies\n\n‘Going in Style’ is Innocuous Fun\n\nBy: Alex Perez On the surface of Going in Style, you have a comedy staring three top-notch actors. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Alan Arkin can be considered legends at this point. On the flip side though, this project really came out of nowhere. Considering I haven’t seen the original (and I doubt that many […]\n\nMovies\n\n‘CHiPs’ is an Unnecessary Remake\n\nBy: Ali Habous Earlier this year I reviewed the mean-spirited Ice Cube and Charlie Day comedy Fist Fight and I mentioned that decent comedies are a rarity these days and most of them try to squeeze as many jokes as possible, while hoping that most of them land well with the audience. However, 90% of […]\n\nMovies\n\nGet Out – A Tense Satirical Thriller\n\nBy: Matt Prazak Jordan Peele sits in the directors chair for the first time in his new thriller Get Out, starring Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford. Known for his comedic roles on TV before making the transition to the big screen with Keanu, Jordan Peele writes and directs a film that […]\n\nMovies\n\n‘Fist Fight’ has Lot of Fists but No Punches\n\nBy: Ali Habous I have always found it challenging to review crude comedies like Fist Fight because it hard to judge a bunch of filmmakers who are not concerned about the film-making aspect of the movie while all they care about is making the audience laugh. We can talk about the acting and the jokes […]\n\nMovies\n\nWar Dogs – Satirical Comedy Never Reaches its Full Potential\n\nBy: Ali Habous Todd Phillips is no stranger to popular buddy comedies; he directed The Hangover trilogy, Old School, and Due Date. Here we have Phillips taking a shot at satirical comedies while bringing his own touch to the table. War Dogs is to him what The Wolf of Wall Street was to Martin Scorsese and American Hustle […]\n\nMovies\n\nContest: Enter to Win Passes to the Advance Screening of “Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates”\n\n20th Century Fox Films Canada and Get Reel Movies want to take readers and listeners to an advance screening of Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates! Screenings will be taking place in Toronto and Ottawa on Wednesday, June 29, 2016. Synopsis: Hard-partying brothers Mike (Adam Devine) and Dave (Zac Efron) place an online ad to find the perfect dates […]\n\nMovies\n\nThe Nice Guys – Supreme Comedy Noir\n\nBy: Daniel Chadwick-Shubat Shane Black is a fantastic writer. For me that is a fact that is undeniable. With the likes of Lethal Weapon, The Last Action Hero and The Long Kiss Goodnight all being penned by Black. But it wasn’t until Kiss Kiss Bang Bang that Black showed his directorial prowess as well. With The Nice Guys he has once again captured […]"
