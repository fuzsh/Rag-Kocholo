        "text": "Michael Douglas has paid tribute to his \"wonderful\" co-star Alan Arkin, who sadly died earlier this week.\n\nAlan, who was 89 when he died, was best-known for his role in Little Miss Sunshine, as well as the many other films and stage productions in which he starred.\n\nWith tributes flocking in for the actor, Michael Douglas is among the famous friends of Alan to have paid tribute.\n\nMichael, 78, acted with Alan in the Netflix sitcom The Kominsky Method, with him now remembering his former co-star in a touching way.\n\nSharing a snap of himself with Alan, Michael penned: \"Today we lost a wonderful actor whose intelligence, sense of comedy and consummate professionalism over the past 70 years has left an indelible mark on our industry.\n\n\"My experience of working with Alan were some of my most memorable. He will be deeply missed. Sincere condolences to his wife, Suzanne, and his family.\"\n\nThe Kominsky Method saw Michael take on the role of a Hollywood acting coach, with Alan playing his agent between 2018 and 2019.\n\nFans of the two stars were quick to comment on the post, with one writing: \"He was a fantastic incredible actor. I loved you both in the Kominsky Method. His gift to us will live on forever.\"\n\nAnother then penned: \"Iâ€™ve always loved Alan Arkin. There was always something so uniquely special about him. I hope he has eternal peace.\"\n\nAlan's death was announced on Friday by his three beloved sons Adam, Matthew and Anthony.\n\nThe three brothers confirmed their dad's death in a joint statement to People magazine, where they penned the touching statement which read: \"Our father was a uniquely talented force of nature, both as an artist and a man.\n\n\"A loving husband, father, grand and great grandfather, he was adored and will be deeply missed.\"\n\nWhen starring in Little Miss Sunshine, Alan played the role of a grumpy grandad with a taste for drugs.\n\nThe role is what won him various accolades including his BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.\n\nThe New York-born actor and director had graced both stage and screen throughout his glowing career, with his first Broadway role being in 1961.\n\nAs well as his role in the fan-favourite comedy-drama in which he starred, his career was full to the brim with him having starred in a number of other films such as Bad Medicine, Indian Summer and Picture Window.\n\nThroughout his life he was married three times and divorced twice, with him welcoming two sons with his first wife and one son with his second.\n\nUp until his death he was married to Suzanne Newlander, whom he wed in 1996.\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook."
