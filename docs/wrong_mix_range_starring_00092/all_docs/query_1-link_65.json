        "text": "Superhero movies are box-office gold for movie studios. Not adjusting for inflation, 22 of the 100 top-grossing movies of all time are superhero movies. With films such as “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Black Panther” grossing hundreds of millions of dollars in the U.S. alone, the genre seems like a sure bet for Hollywood producers.\n\nHowever, not all superheroes have the draw of Iron Man or Black Panther. Many characters either fail to grab the public’s attention or slowly lose it after a strong debut. For every Batman — a superhero who has inspired numerous sequels and reboots — there’s a misfire that audiences, and studios, would rather forget.\n\n24/7 Wall Street has identified the most forgettable superheroes by reviewing the success of their films, both commercially and critically.\n\nMore: Every Marvel superhero movie, definitively ranked (including 'Ant-Man 2')\n\nAlso: 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' star Evangeline Lilly has finally figured out fame\n\nRelated: Everything you need to know about 'Ant-Man and the Wasp'\n\nThe majority of superheroes featured on this list spawned just a single film before disappearing from the silver screen. Many of these characters originated, as so many superheroes do, in comic books, and would likely have generated numerous sequels had audiences been more receptive.\n\nTo be considered for the list of most forgettable superheroes, each character needed to appear in a live-action feature film listed on IMDb. Domestic box-office data comes from Box Office Mojo and is not adjusted for inflation. The most recent movie appearance is the last film released in which the hero plays a major role.\n\n1. Barb Wire\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"Barb Wire\" (1996)\n\n> Starring: Pamela Anderson, Amir Aboulela, Adriana Alexander\n\n> Domestic box office gross: $3.79M\n\nStarring Pamela Anderson in the title role, the 1996 action-science fiction movie earned its R-rating for its excessive female nudity. The plot involves Anderson as a nightclub owner and bounty hunter who tries to help a former lover escape to Canada during a second American civil war in 2017. Despite Anderson's star power, the film grossed about $3.8 million.\n\n2. Blankman\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"Blankman\" (1994)\n\n> Starring: Damon Wayans, David Alan Grier, Robin Givens\n\n> Domestic box office gross: $7.89M\n\n\"Blankman\" is among the most unlikeliest of superheroes: an inventor who becomes a superhero without any superpowers. Blankman creates a bulletproof costume and builds robots to fight organized crime. The movie is a send-up of the superhero genre. There is plenty of comedic star power in this film with Damon Wayans (who co-wrote the screenplay) and David Alan Grier. Robin Givens is the female lead as a reporter. The film and superhero drew a blank with moviegoers and critics, scoring just 13% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n3. Condorman\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"Condorman\" (1981)\n\n> Starring: Michael Crawford, Oliver Reed, Barbara Carrera\n\n> Domestic box office gross: N/A\n\nDisney waded into the superhero realm with this 1981 light comedy-action entry. An eccentric cartoonist (Michael Crawford) becomes the winged superhero he draws. The hero, an American secret agent named Condorman, is tasked with helping a Soviet spy (Barbara Carrera) defect to the West. The film wasn't panned by critics, but they didn't embrace it, either. TV Guide wrote, \"The film is pleasant but too hackneyed and heavy-handed to work well.\"\n\n4. Crimson Bolt\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"Super\" (2010)\n\n> Starring: Rainn Wilson, Ellen Page, Liv Tyler\n\n> Domestic box office gross: $0.32M\n\nRainn Wilson, who gained fame from his stint on TV's long-running series \"The Office,\" did a turn as comedic action hero Crimson Bolt in the movie \"Super.\" Wilson plays Frank Darbo, a cook whose wife (Liv Tyler) succumbs to the influence of a drug dealer (Kevin Bacon). After watching Christian television, Darbo has a vision and becomes a superhero to fight evil. Despite its star power (Ellen Page plays the superhero's sidekick), the movie grossed less than $330,000.\n\n5. Darkman\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"Darkman III: Die Darkman Die\" (1996)\n\n> Starring: Jeff Fahey, Arnold Vosloo, Darlanne Fluegel\n\n> Domestic box office gross: N/A\n\nLiam Neeson originated the role of Darkman in a 1990 film directed by fright-movie master Sam Raimi. Neeson was replaced by Arnold Vosloo in the two direct-to-video sequels. Darkman is Peyton Westlake, a scientist attacked by gangsters who torch his laboratory and leave him for dead. Westlake disguises himself with synthetic skin and tries to exact revenge on those who attacked him.\n\n6. Defendor\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"Defendor\" (2009)\n\n> Starring: Woody Harrelson, Kat Dennings, Sandra Oh\n\n> Domestic box office gross: $0.04M\n\nFed up with the crime overrunning his city, everyman Arthur Poppington (Woody Harrelson) becomes a vigilante superhero named Defendor. Brandishing a billy club and slingshot, Defendor tries to protect citizens from crime and thwart his arch-enemy, Captain Industry. Critics chided the movie for its inconsistent tone, and it grossed less than $45,000.\n\n7. Elektra\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"Elektra\" (2005)\n\n> Starring: Jennifer Garner, Goran Visnjic, Will Yun Lee\n\n> Domestic box office gross: $24.41M\n\nJennifer Garner plays Marvel Comics hero Elektra, a warrior who recovers from nearly mortal wounds to become an assassin for a powerful group called The Hand. When the assassin syndicate calls on her to execute a father and daughter who are targets of The Hand, Elektra chooses to protect them instead. The film, a spinoff of 2003's \"Daredevil,\" wasn't received well by critics or audiences, receiving an audience score of just 29% on Rotten Tomatoes. But Garner and the martial arts scenes were praised.\n\n8. Ghost Rider\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" (2011)\n\n> Starring: Nicolas Cage, Ciarán Hinds, Idris Elba\n\n> Domestic box office gross: $51.77M\n\nIn the first movie of the franchise in 2007, Nicolas Cage plays stunt biker Johnny Blaze. He becomes Ghost Rider, a bounty hunter sent by the devil to find the souls of the damned, after he sells his soul to the devil Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) in exchange for curing Blaze's ailing father. Ghost Rider has to stop Mephistopheles' son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) from creating hell on Earth. Expressing frustration with the creative result of the two \"Ghost Rider\" films, Cage has stated the he will no longer appear in the series.\n\n9. Green Hornet\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"The Green Hornet\" (2011)\n\n> Starring: Seth Rogen, Jay Chou, Christoph Waltz\n\n> Domestic box office gross: $98.78M\n\nProduction of \"The Green Hornet\" was stuck in limbo for many years as it changed studio hands. As the project developed, actors such as Mark Wahlberg and Jake Gyllenhaal were considered to play the lead. Surprisingly, the role was eventually given to Seth Rogen, who is largely known for his comedic work. The effects-heavy 3-D film failed to impress most critics, and while it didn't completely bomb at the box office, its high production cost ensured that no follow-up film would be made.\n\n10. Green Lantern\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"Green Lantern\" (2011)\n\n> Starring: Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively, Peter Sarsgaard\n\n> Domestic box office gross: $116.60M\n\nRyan Reynolds brought the DC Comics character to the big screen in 2011. Reynolds plays test pilot Hal Jordan, who is given superhuman powers and joins the Green Lantern Corps, an intergalactic force for peace and justice. With the Green Lantern Corps, he has to defend humanity against Parallax, an evil entity that thrives on fear. The Warner Bros. movie grossed more than $116 million but failed to impress critics, who chided the film as \"noisy, overproduced, and thinly written,\" according to Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n11. Howard the Duck\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"Howard the Duck\" (1986)\n\n> Starring: Lea Thompson, Jeffrey Jones, Tim Robbins\n\n> Domestic box office gross: $16.30M\n\nThe title character of the 1986 science-fiction comedy is a cigar-chomping humanoid duck (voiced by Chip Zien) from another world, who is accidentally brought to Earth via laser beam during an experiment performed by a scientist (Jeffrey Jones). An alien invader also arrives on Earth by laser beam, and Howard, the scientist, and Howard's love interest (Lea Thompson) are tasked with defeating the alien. Critics wished they ducked this film. A typical assessment came from Carrie Rickey of the Philadelphia Inquirer: \"What can you say about a comedy in which the biggest laugh is in the end credits?\"\n\n12. Jonah Hex\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"Jonah Hex\" (2010)\n\n> Starring: Josh Brolin, Megan Fox, John Malkovich\n\n> Domestic box office gross: $10.54M\n\nDespite originating in the world of DC Comics — home to beloved superheroes like Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman — the 19th century-based hero Jonah Hex failed to leave a similar cinematic impression, with the character's one feature film bombing at the box office. On a production budget of $47 million, the movie grossed $10.5 million in the U.S. As a result, its international release was severely limited and the movie grossed less than $500,000 abroad.\n\n13. Priest\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"Priest\" (2011)\n\n> Starring: Paul Bettany, Cam Gigandet, Maggie Q\n\n> Domestic box office gross: $29.14M\n\n\"Priest\" is a loose adaptation of a Korean comic of the same name, starring Paul Bettany as the titular Priest. The film takes place in a world where humans are at eternal war with vampires. After the vampires kidnap Priest's niece, he goes on a crusade to find her. While the story may sound original, critics found the film to be full of cliches. With little to make it stand out, there was little hope of a follow-up.\n\n14. Star Kid\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"Star Kid\" (1997)\n\n> Starring: Joseph Mazzello, Joey Simmrin, Alex Daniels\n\n> Domestic box office gross: $7.02M\n\nAfter a rocket lands in a junkyard, shy 12-year-old Spencer Griffith (Joseph Mazzello) finds a cybersuit inside the rocket that he puts on. Spencer becomes extremely strong and faces down the bully who has been tormenting him. His troubles aren't over, though, because he'll have to battle an invader from another world. Critics were won over by Mazzello's performance, but the film didn't win favor with moviegoers, posting an audience score of 35% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n15. Steel\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"Steel\" (1997)\n\n> Starring: Shaquille O'Neal, Annabeth Gish, Judd Nelson\n\n> Domestic box office gross: $1.71M\n\n\"Steel\" sought to capitalize on the popularity of superstar NBA center Shaquille O'Neal. Shaq portrays John Henry Irons, a weapons designer whose laser weaponry fall into the hands of an unscrupulous soldier (Judd Nelson) who intends to sell it to criminal gangs. Irons and his uncle (Richard Roundtree) develop armor and weaponry to fight crime. The movie bombed; it cost $16 million to make and grossed $1.7 million.\n\n16. Swamp Thing\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"The Return of Swamp Thing\" (1989)\n\n> Starring: Dick Durock, Heather Locklear, Louis Jourdan\n\n> Domestic box office gross: $0.19M\n\nThe plot revolves around a scientist looking to create a new species that can survive in harsh conditions by combining plant and animal. Of course, the scientist is turned into the swamp creature, who has to keep the formula out of the hands of suave villain Arcane (Louis Jourdan). The movie, by veteran horror flick director Wes Craven, is known as much for Adrienne Barbeau as the damsel in distress as for its plot. Heather Locklear would appear in the sequel in 1989.\n\n17. Tank Girl\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"Tank Girl\" (1995)\n\n> Starring: Lori Petty, Ice-T, Naomi Watts\n\n> Domestic box office gross: $4.06M\n\n\"Tank Girl\" is a dystopian tale set in the Australian Outback in the year 2033. Although the film and the comic that it's based on have cult followings, the character has failed to thrill the public at large. \"Tank Girl\" grossed slightly more than $4 million at the domestic box office on a $25 million production budget.\n\n18. The Crow\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"The Crow: Wicked Prayer\" (2005)\n\n> Starring: Yuji Okumoto, Marcus Chong, Tito Ortiz\n\n> Domestic box office gross: N/A\n\nThe character of The Crow showed much promise upon the release of the first Crow film in 1994. However, following the death of star Brandon Lee after an accident on the set, the series seemed to have had trouble maintaining widespread interest. With the final two sequels — out of four films total — going straight to video, studios have had little desire to continue with the franchise.\n\n19. The Guyver\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"Guyver: Dark Hero\" (1994)\n\n> Starring: David Hayter, Kathy Christopherson, Bruno Patrick\n\n> Domestic box office gross: N/A\n\nBased on a Japanese manga, 1991's \"The Guyver\" tells the story of Sean Baker, a young man turned alien-hybrid super soldier as he battles evil corporation Chronos. While the film didn't create a huge splash among fans, it did spawn a sequel that went directly to video, \"Guyver: Dark Hero.\" The futuristic films had little impact, and the lead hero has since been left in the 20th century.\n\n20. The Meteor Man\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"The Meteor Man\" (1993)\n\n> Starring: Robert Townsend, Marla Gibbs, Eddie Griffin\n\n> Domestic box office gross: $8.02M\n\n\"The Meteor Man\" stars Robert Townsend as an easygoing teacher who develops superpowers after he's hit by a meteor. While it's unlikely that the film's creators envisioned a giant franchise around the character, the movie's lukewarm critical reception doomed it to the dustbin of history. Only 29% of critics and 36% of audiences gave \"The Meteor Man\" positive reviews, according to Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n21. The Phantom\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"The Phantom\" (1996)\n\n> Starring: Billy Zane, Kristy Swanson, Treat Williams\n\n> Domestic box office gross: $17.30M\n\nLike \"Barb Wire\" and \"Tank Girl,\" \"The Phantom\" is yet another failed comic-book adaption from the mid-1990s. Based on a comic by Lee Falk, the movie stars Billy Zane as a masked hero who must battle wealthy criminal Xander Drax (Treat Williams). Zane was signed on to do two more \"Phantom\" movies, but the initial film did so poorly that the sequels were scrapped.\n\n22. The Rocketeer\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"The Rocketeer\" (1991)\n\n> Starring: Billy Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Alan Arkin\n\n> Domestic box office gross: $46.70M\n\nBased in 1938 Los Angeles, \"The Rocketeer\" is about a stunt pilot who obtains a jetpack, enabling him to fly through the air. The film was a box-office disappointment, grossing $46.7 million on a production budget of $35 million. Although the movie was originally envisioned as the first installment of a trilogy, plans for subsequent films were abandoned.\n\n23. The Spirit\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"The Spirit\" (2008)\n\n> Starring: Gabriel Macht, Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson\n\n> Domestic box office gross: $19.78M\n\nThe Spirit is a masked crimefighter, played by Gabriel Macht, who must battle his arch nemesis The Octopus, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Despite director Frank Miller's successes in bringing comic-book properties to the big screen, \"The Spirit\" flopped, grossing less than $20 million in the U.S. on a reported budget of $60 million. According to Rotten Tomatoes, the film's \"characters are unmemorable,\" including the main hero.\n\n24. Toxic Avenger\n\n> Most recent movie appearance: \"Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV\" (2000)\n\n> Starring: David Mattey, Clyde Lewis, Heidi Sjursen\n\n> Domestic box office gross: N/A\n\nThe movie poster says it all: \"He was 98 lbs. of solid nerd until he became ... The Toxic Avenger.\" Mitch Cohen plays a milquetoast mop boy at a health club who is turned into a superhero after he falls into a vat of toxic waste. Toxic Avenger is unleashed to battle evildoers and corruption. The horror-comedy genre became a popular film segment in the 1980s, but three sequels to \"Toxic Avenger\" proved to be toxic at the box office."
