        "text": "A number of Hollywood stars are paying tribute to Alan Arkin, who died at 89.\n\n“Our father was a uniquely talented force of nature, both as an artist and a man,” his sons Adam, Matthew and Anthony shared in a joint statement announcing his death. “A loving husband, father, grand and great-grandfather, he was adored and will be deeply missed.”\n\nArkin was perhaps best known for his Oscar-winning work in Little Miss Sunshine, opposite Abigail Breslin, Steve Carell, Paul Dano and Toni Collette. He also starred in Argo, which garnered him another Oscar nomination. The actor most recently was nominated for back-to-back Emmys for best supporting actor in a comedy series for his work in The Kominsky Method.\n\n“Alan Arkin’s talent knew no bounds,” Journey Gunderson, executive director of the National Comedy Center, said in a statement. “From his early days performing improv at The Second City to his stage and film work, Arkin was an extraordinary comedic actor who brought to life eccentric, unforgettable and extremely funny characters – with brilliant comedy just one portion of his remarkable body of work. He will be greatly missed.” – Journey Gunderson, National Comedy Center Executive Director\n\nMichael Douglas wrote on Instagram, “Today we lost a wonderful actor whose intelligence, sense of comedy and consummate professionalism over the past 70 years has left an indelible mark on our industry. My experience of working with Alan were some of my most memorable. He will be deeply missed.”\n\nArkin’s Little Miss Sunshine co-star Abigail Breslin shared a statement and called him one of the “kindest, gentlest and hilarious actors” she’s ever worked with. “We may not have been related in real life, but he will always be Grandpa in my heart I send my deepest sympathies this his wife Suzanne and his family,” she said.\n\nJason Alexander was the first star to react to the news, tweeting in part, “Such a wonderful, original voice for comedy. And on the few occasions I was in his presence, a kind and generous soul. I learned so much from watching him. And the laughs I got from his glorious work seem endless.”\n\n“The one and only ALAN ARKIN has left us,” Michael Imperioli wrote on Instagram. “Arkin was a rare breed who had an infallible sense of truth that allowed him to shift with ease from the tragic to the hilarious in the blink of an eye. Such a great actor and such a great loss to cinema.”\n\nRalph Macchio tweeted, “Alan Arkin – legendary in every aspect and any genre. His range was and is… beyond! Truly one of a kind.”\n\nRead more tributes to Arkin below."
