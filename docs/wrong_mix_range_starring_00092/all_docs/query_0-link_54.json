        "text": "Old School\n\nJake's dream comes true when he gets to spend the day with his hero, Jimmy Brogan (guest star Stacy Keach), a former crime reporter. But the dream becomes a nightmare when Jake's comments about Holt and the precinct are considered \"on the record.\" Meanwhile, Terry and Charles try to teach Rosa how to be less terrifying on the witness stand.\n\nAmerican Disgrace\n\nBasketball superstar Shakir âThe Sharkâ Wilkins (guest star Henry Simmons) announces his partnership with the Orion Bay clothing line, owned by billionaire Orion Bauer (guest star Stacy Keach) and his daughter Cordelia (guest star Teri Polo). But the SVU intervenes when Orion press rep Carla Cannon (guest star Kelley Missal) tells reporters she was raped by Wilkins. When more women come forward, Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Detective Carisi (guest star Peter Scanavino) disagree on the authenticity of each womanâs story, and Barba (Raul Esparza) takes a shaky case to court. Meanwhile, the case takes Rollins (Kelli Giddish) to her former precinct in Atlanta, where ex-colleagues bring up old memories.\n\nSomething Blue\n\nAs Jamie and Eddie's wedding day approaches, Frank worries about the toast he'll deliver at their rehearsal dinner. Also, Erin interviews a witness whose story leads her to doubt Eddie's honesty, since she took his initial statement, and Danny and Baez unravel the complicated love life of a young homicide victim.\n\nMurphy Brown Lied to Us\n\nJack (Alec Baldwin) sets Liz (Tina Fey) up on a blind date to show her what sheâs missing in her relationship with Criss. Meanwhile at KableTown, Jack has to scramble when his plan to manufacture couches hits a speed bump. With Tracyâs (Tracy Morgan) help, Jenna (Jane Krakowski) orchestrates a public meltdown to get Paulâs (guest star Will Forte) attention.\n\nBrushed Off\n\nWhen a famous basketball player is found dead of an apparent drug overdose, Danny looks into his possible ties to a local drug gang. Also, Erin revisits the case of a man she may have wrongfully convicted years ago, and Frank is approached by Archbishop Kearns (Stacy Keach) regarding an eviction matter Jamie and Eddie are working on."
