Herschell Gordon Lewis' next-to-last gore film, THE WIZARD OF GORE, is one of his most disgusting efforts. Shot in and around Chicago and its suburbs, the film begins at a Grand Guignol stage show performed by Montag the Magnificent (Ray Sager). Witnessing the spectacular performance are local TV hostess Sherry Carson (Judy Cler), who is reviewing the act for her "Housewife's Coffee Break" show, and her sportswriter boy friend, Jack (Wayne Ratay). While Jack is repulsed, Sherry is impressed as Montag seems to saw a woman from the audience in half with a chainsaw. After the trick, the woman--who has been disemboweled before the audience's eyes--seems fine, but an hour later she collapses at a nearby restaurant, her guts spilling out on the floor. Unaware of this development, Sherry calls on the clever magician, inviting him to make a guest appearance on her talk show in a few days. The next night, Sherry and Jack attend another performance during which Montag drives a spike through a woman's head. She too initially appears to be fine, but an hour later she dies of her wound. Jack gets suspicious and goes to the police with his theory, and soon the police department, Jack, and Sherry are all trying to figure out what the illusionist is up to. Although it's an amusingly ambitious attempt to blur the distinction between illusion and reality, this film is one of Lewis' most incompetent productions. Poorly shot and edited--flash frames and jump cuts are in abundance--THE WIZARD OF GORE exists merely for its gore effects, which are really not as good as those in BLOOD FEAST or TWO THOUSAND MANIACS. While quality acting has never been a requirement in a Lewis film, Sager is unbelievably bad as Montag, playing a character much older than he is and bellowing every one of his lines. Despite these fatal flaws, Lewis fans will no doubt love it.
