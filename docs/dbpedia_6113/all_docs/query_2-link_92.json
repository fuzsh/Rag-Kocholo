        "text": "Herschell Gordon Lewis, a director who set new standards for gore and violence in the early 1960s with the low-budget films “Blood Feast” and “Two Thousand Maniacs!,” died on Monday at his home in Pompano, Fla. He was 90.\n\nHis death was confirmed by his son Robert.\n\nOften credited as the creator of the splatter film, and an inspiration to John Carpenter, Wes Craven, John Waters, Quentin Tarantino and other filmmakers, Mr. Lewis graduated from the soft-core sex films known as nudie cuties to explore the lurid world of mayhem, torture and mass murder in a spate of films that traditional theaters would not touch with a 10-foot pole.\n\nIgnoring such traditional ingredients of the horror genre as plot, suspense and character, and focusing on gross-out special effects of astonishing cheapness, Mr. Lewis ushered in a new era of hyperviolent films that found eager audiences at drive-ins across the United States. His legacy can be seen in the trail of blood that leads from “The Last House on the Left” and “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” and onward to slasher franchises like “Halloween,” “Friday the 13th” and “A Nightmare on Elm Street.”"
