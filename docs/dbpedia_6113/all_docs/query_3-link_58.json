        "text": "Artist Adam finds that his paintings are so much better when he starts to use human blood on his canvases as well as paint. Ironically the gallery owner who sells his work and the art buyers now love his new artworks not knowing that he’s using blood and bumping people off to make sure he has plenty of his new chosen art material.\n\nI first learnt of Herschell Gordon Lewis’ films through the amazing book Incredibly Strange Films that also introduced me to the films of other geniuses such as Ted V Mikels and Russ Meyers. It would be a few years after reading about Lewis’ work that I would actually get to see his films when they were finally released on VHS. And, thankfully, it was worth the wait.\n\nColor Me Blood Red is part of Lewis’ ‘Blood Trilogy’ which includes his better-known films Blood Feast and Two Thousand Maniacs. And, in my humble opinion, it’s just as good. All of the ingredients are here- interesting characters, a deranged plot, a colour palate to die for (pun not intended) and a groovy soundtrack.\n\nThe film also reminded me of Abel Ferrera’s Drilled Killer which told the story of another artist and his descent into madness.\n\nLewis was light years ahead of his time and a huge influence on John Waters (Beverley Sutphin is seen watching Blood Feast in Serial Mom). Color Me Blood Red reminded me so much of Waters’ early masterpieces- the natural acting style, the jagged cinematography, the sense that this was a triumph of imagination over budget, the general feeling that ANYTHING could happen (and it does). In other words, damn fine cult cinema.\n\nColor Me Blood Red is underrated Lewis but just as vital as his better-known films. It reminds me that I need to buy the Arrow Blu-Ray box set of his films.\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nI became a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis after reading about his work in the RE:Search book Incredibly Strange Films book (if you don’t own this tome then buy it NOW!!! Its been a major influence and point of reference in my cult film adoration).\n\nAround this time there was an episode of Jonathan Ross’ excellent Incredibly Strange Film Show devoted to Lewis and his work that I lapped up.\n\nI then bought a copy of Two Thousand Maniacs on VHS in Forbidden Planet on first moving to London in the mid-90s. And boy, did it rock my world. Quirky, innovative, funny, full of character and gory as hell.\n\nFrom that moment on I became dedicated to buying as much of Lewis’ work as possible. Next came Blood Feast and then She-Devils on Wheels. Both masterpieces, both seminal films.\n\nWhat’s more, my other cinematic heroes seemed to hold Lewis up for canonisation just as I did.\n\nI was gobsmacked when I heard that Arrow Video were to release a new boxset of his work. And from what I’ve seen it’s quite some boxset! Arrow Video go from strength to strength. I’m so glad they treat the films that I hold close to my heart with the respect and love that I know they deserve.\n\nThe good people at Dread Central have just released this boxset unboxing video for us to salivate over-\n\nHere’s what is in the boxset via the press release-\n\nThe Herschell Gordon Lewis Feast\n\n[Blu-ray + DVD – 17 discs] (October 25th)\n\nLimited to 2500 copies!\n\nDirector: Herschell Gordon Lewis\n\nIn 1963, director Herschell Gordon Lewis pulled a cow’s tongue out of an actress’ mouth on camera, and in doing so, changed the landscape of horror cinema forever. That sequence was just one of numerous gruesome gags featured in Blood Feast, the film credited as being the world’s first gore movie. It’s no exaggeration to say that the modern gross-out movies of today owe their very existence to the pioneering efforts of H.G. Lewis. But whilst Lewis is most widely celebrated for his blood-and-guts epics (Two Thousand Maniacs!, The Wizard of Gore et al.), there’s more to the prolific director than splatter.\n\nFrom tales of sordid photographers (Scum of the Earth) to sex robots (How to Make a Doll), from biker girl-gangs (She-Devils on Wheels) to youths-run-amok (Just for the Hell of It), and from psychic witches (Something Weird) to hard liquor-loving hillbillies (Moonshine Mountain), the filmography of H.G. Lewis reads like a veritable wish-list of exploitation movie madness.\n\nNow, for the first time ever, Arrow Video is proud to present fourteen of the Godfather of Gore’s most essential films (including nine Blu-ray world debuts), collected together at last and packed full of eye-popping bonus content. So put your feet up, pour yourself a glass of good ol’ moonshine, and prepare yourself for a feast – H.G.
