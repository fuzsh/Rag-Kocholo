        "text": "We’re off to see the wizard!\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe contests keep coming: Win a copy of Arrow Video’s The Wizard of Gore.\n\nIt’s new release Tuesday, which means we’re continuing our streak of giving away great Blu-rays from our friends at MVD Entertainment. This week we’ve got Arrow Video’s release of the classic schlocky horror film The Wizard of Gore!\n\nNow, who wants to step up and be my assistant?\n\nDo the heavy lifting for me, MVD:\n\nYou’ve all seen the trick in which the magician saws his glamorous assistant in half — but what about the spike through the brain gag? Or the good old smashing punch-press? Montag the Magnificent’s blood-curdling onstage performances shock and dazzle his audiences in equal measure. But when his participants start winding up dead, local TV talk show hostess Sherry Carson suspects his gruesome “act” may be more sinister than it first seems… Featuring some of the most notorious gory setpieces in all of director H.G. Lewis’ blood-soaked career, The Wizard of Gore is a stomach-churning, Grand Guignol production that’s less sleight of hand and more slice of hand!\n\nDon’t you just love 70s schlock?\n\nTo enter to win, tell us your magic trick that gets your audience volunteers killed in gruesome ways! I do the ol’ “pull a rabbit out of the hat” trick, instead it’s not a rabbit but a Rabbi. My volunteer usually goes into shock as a result of the whole thing and dies. I’ve lost so many audience members!\n\nWe have two Blu-ray copies to give out. This is a physical prize, and as such, you must have a United States mailing address in order to win. Winners will be drawn on Monday, November 19. Please comment using a Dtoid account with your current email address on file. If I can’t email you, I can’t dazzle you with my very dumb tricks."
