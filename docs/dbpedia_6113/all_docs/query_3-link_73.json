        "text": "\"I see filmmaking as a business and pity anyone who regards it as an art form.\" HGL\n\nThere are many great exploitation directors, a large number of them already featured on Cultpix, but few as influential as Herschell Gordon Lewis. Without him there might never have been films like “Basket Case” (1982), “Re-Animator” (1985), “Serial Mom” (1994), “Saw” (2004) or “Terrifier 2” (2022), because Lewis single-handedly invented the gore and splatter horror genre and then milked it for all it was worth. He was not so much a great director as he was a marketing genius, in that he was able to come up with ideas for films and marketing campaigns to go with them that guaranteed that they would make money.\n\nLewis started out in journalism before moving to radio and TV advertising. His future in gore can be traced back to a public service announcement (PSA) short film he did in 1959 called “Carving Magic”, an instructional film for housewives about “How to Cut and Serve Various Slabs of Meat” made for for the Dearborn Department of Libraries. Lewis’ career and film history changed when he met David F. Friedman, by then an ex-publicist at Paramount Pictures (and subject of his own Cultpix theme week), hitting ot off immediately:\n\n\"What kind of films do you want to make?\" Friedman asked, semi-seriously.\n\n\"The kind that make money,\" said Lewis.\n\n\"The Wizard of Gore\" (1970) - by the Godfather of Gore.\n\nCultpix has almost all of Herschell Gordon Lewis’ films, starting with the early nudist-camp nudie cuties such as \"The Adventures of Lucky Pierre\" (1961), made for a show-string budget of $7,500 and grossing three times that, \"Nature's Playmates\" (1962), \"Daughter of the Sun\" (1962), \"Goldilocks and the Three Bares\" (1963), which was promoted as the “first (and to date the only) nudist musical, \"Boin-n-g!\" (1963) where Lewis sends up both himself and the entire sexploitation movie business, and \"Bell, Bare and Beautiful\" (1964), with burlesque legend Virginia Bell. (For rights reasons we’ve often had to upload the same film twice - once for Scandinavia and once for the Rest of the World, except UK.)\n\nThis is how the ‘Blood Trilogy’ was born. “Blood Feast” (1963) was made for an estimated $20,000 and ended up taking over $4 million, mainly at drive-ins where audiences had never seen anything like it. Lewis would later say that the origins of his “Blood Feast is like a poem by Walt Whitman. It’s no good, but it was the first of its kind!” A genre was born and Herschell Gordon Lewis exploited it for all it was worth and even changed US censorship in the process.\n\nYet Lewis only made films for another nine years, before going back to the work of advertising, where he lectured, wrote books and got rich. He pioneered the use of direct marketing, so we have Lewis to thank/hate for junk mail. It is thanks to Jimmy Maslon, who started buying the rights to HGL’s films before VHS was even a thing, purely because of their popularity on US college campuses, that Lewis’ legacy survived. We also have Maslon to thank for the right to show the films on Cultpix.\n\nAs Tony Mostrom wrote in ‘Blood Feast: The Stomach-turning Cinema Of Herschell Gordon Lewis’: “Lewis was an intelligent, educated guy smart enough to know the real worth of his own productions. After his rediscovery by film fanatics in the ‘80s, when even French critics tried to puff him up as an “auteur” genius, he would have none of it: when the famous film magazine Cahiers du Cinema called Blood Feast and 2000 Maniacs among the “best” horror films of all time (!) and declared Lewis “a subject for further study,” his reaction was “that’s what they say about cancer.”.”\n\nServing up the gore in generous portions.\n\nLewis then switched tack completely and single-handedly invented the gore genre with the Blood Trilogy films: \"Blood Feast\" (1963) where the caterer/cultist Fuad Ramses asks the classic question: “Have you ever had… an Egyptian feast?”, \"Two Thousand Maniacs\" (1964) with its epic theme song \"The South's Gonna Rise Again\", and \"Color Me Blood Red\" (1965), (his last film with Friedman and often referred to as the ‘Gone With the Wind of Gore’ due to its relatively lengthy running time of two hours). His other gore greats included \"A Taste of Blood\" (1967), \"The Gruesome Twosome\" (1967) (dig the electric carving knife), \"The Wizard of Gore\" (1970) and his last 70s film \"The Gore Gore Girls\" (1972), \"a fascinatingly sick swan song.\"\n\nLewis then switched tack completely and single-handedly invented the gore genre with the Blood Trilogy films: \"Blood Feast\" (1963) where the caterer/cultist Fuad Ramses asks the classic question: “Have you ever had… an Egyptian feast?”, \"Two Thousand Maniacs\" (1964) with its epic theme song \"The South's Gonna Rise Again\", and \"Color Me Blood Red\" (1965).

We also have the documentary \"Herschell Gordon Lewis: the Godfather of Gore\" (2010) where the great man speaks for himself and gives you the gore-y details of his career.\n\nOn Lewis'; career, AllMovie wrote, \"With his better-known gore films, Herschell Gordon Lewis was a pioneer, going further than anyone else dared, probing the depths of disgust and discomfort onscreen with more bad taste and imagination than anyone of his era.\" He truly deserves the title of Godfather of Gore.\n\n\"Gather around, children; let uncle Lewis tell you a fun bed-time story.\""
