        "text": "Roger Ebert once proposed that, rather than remake perfectly good films like The Birds or A Nightmare on Elm Street, movies that withstand the test of time and need no re-imagining, writers and directors should instead focus on movies that weren’t very good to begin with. I understand that many see Herschell Gordon Lewis as some sort of bastion of horror. I would even allow that he brought the ‘gore’ film into popular culture. But H.G. Lewis was not a great storyteller. His films are rough, unpolished, meandering splatter films that have more heart than brains and more kitsch value than quality. All that serves to explain why a remake of his 1970 horror film does not fall into the usual “Why are they doing this to me?” category.\n\nDirected by Jeremy Kasten (The Attic Expeditions, The Thirst) and written by Zach Chassler, this new interpretation of The Wizard of Gore is set in the alternative culture of Los Angeles, a place where everyone is captivated by shock and the aesthetics of darkness. There is a loose sexuality that haunts the corners of these alleys, accompanied by a superficial desire to appear strange among the bizarre. Many hunger to catch the eye of Edmund Bigelow (Kip Pardue), the writer and distributor of an underground rag that defines the artistic sensibilities of this subculture. When Bigelow and his main squeeze, Maggie (Bijou Phillips), stumble upon a new artist, Montag the Magnificent (Crispin Glover), they are shocked by the performance. A girl is brought on stage, stripped, murdered before the audience’s eyes, only to be miraculously resurrected. Trouble is, these girls keep popping up dead in short order, victims, apparently, of the wounds they suffered onstage.\n\nAs Bigelow returns again and again to Montag’s shows, he finds himself a satellite of the women’s murders, Montag’s insane onstage rants and a victim of a neurotoxin which leaves the subject open to suggestion and prone to hallucinations. Reality begins to blur as Bigelow begins to wonder what effect Montag had had on him, and whether he, in fact, may be murdering Montag’s illusory victims.\n\nIt’s an intriguing concept, and one executed far better than poor old H.G. ever put on screen. It is, unfortunately, not perfect. What would ostensibly be a blood and boobs sort of film (the movie touts the inclusion of the Suicide Girls on the cover) becomes a psychological thriller, only with lots of blood and boobs thrown in. There is a schizophrenic nature to the movie, treading the line between B-movie fluff and some unsettling themes of identity and control. It’s two great tastes that don’t always taste great together.\n\nThe acting and music are both uniformly good, and I have to give Kasten credit for creating a real world here. This feels like a sordid community, one which I have to admit I would love to explore, a place where the darkness holds sway. Pardue is just okay in the role of Bigelow, overshadowed by Bijou Phillip as Maggie and the stalwart of horror, Brad Dourif, playing a seedy herbalist. Jeffrey Combs also pops up as Montag’s assistant, doing some sort of accent that is more mountain man than circus geek, which makes him almost adorable as he stuffs his mouth with maggots. Sadly, the last act is both labyrinthine and ultimately unsatisfying, which casts a pall over the film as a whole.\n\nThere is plenty for gore fans to get excited about, but the real star here is Crispin Glover as Montag. He’s a strange actor in a strange role with decidedly strange results. Is he playing camp, or simply imbuing the role with his Glover-esque deliveries? It’s hard to say, but he is fascinating to watch as he does it."
