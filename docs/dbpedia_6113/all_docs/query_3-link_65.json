        "text": "A stylized, fresh take on the horror genre, WIZARD OF GORE tells the story of young journalist Edmund Bigelow (Kip Pardue), who stumbles upon the spectacularly terrifying show of underground magician Montag the Magnificent (Crispin Glover), who gruesomely dismembers female volunteers from his audience, only to reveal it to be an illusion. However, as real women begin to turn up dead, with wounds reflecting the tricks on stage, Edmund finds himself inextricably linked to the murders — and he begins to fear the darkness might lie in his own heart.\n\nWIZARD OF GORE stars Kip Pardue (Thirteen, The Rules of Attraction, Remember the Titans), Bijou Phillips (Hostel II, Havoc, Door in the Floor, Almost Famous), Crispin Glover (Willard, Charlie’s Angels) and Brad Dourif (Lord of The Rings: The Return of the King/ The Two Towers) and is directed by Jeremy Kasten from a script by Zach Chassler. Also featuring The Suicide Girls!\n\nNTSC Region 1\n\nDirector’s Commentary\n\nDeleted Scenes\n\nOuttakes\n\nFeaturettes\n\nStoryboard comparison\n\nTHIS IS A PREORDER DVD THAT IS DUE TO BE RELEASED ON OR ABOUT 8/19/2008\n\nORDER NOW AND YOU WILL NOT BE CHARGED UNTIL THE ITEM SHIPS\n\nYOU CAN ORDER OTHER ITEMS AS WELL AND CHOOSE TO SHIP THEM NOW\n\nSORRY, BUT WE CANNOT ACCEPT CANCELLATIONS OF PREORDERS"
