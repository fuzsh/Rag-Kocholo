        "text": "Hershell Gordon Lewis or the \"Godfather of Gore\" brings us a very early splatter film from 1970. Montag the Magnificent (Ray Sager) wows an audience with magical gore. One of the people in the audience Sherry Carson (Judy Cler) has her own talk show and wants Montag to be a guest on her show where he can show off his magical skills. Of course corpses are showing up after each show. They also just happen to be the people pulled out of the audience that Montag excites his audience in showing their violent deaths.\n\nWhere the film is somewhat thin in the plot department it is high in the gore department, especially for 1970. Old school gore hounds may enjoy this flick, even though in today's terms you can tell what are props and what are dummies. But, I give Lewis credit for trying something different and really splashing the gore onto the screen. The film really is just a set up for the kills during Montag's show and without them this movie probably would be the pits. Remember though this film is not for all tastes. Some real spotty acting from everybody, although I did seem to enjoy Sager as Montag. He played the role somewhat hammy and it seemed to work well. Also has some dramatically intense music from Larry Wellington (who worked on 7 other Lewis films). This is the only Lewis film I have seen to date, but will likely see more in the future as I see he cranked out it looks like 29 films back in the 60s.\n\nThis might have been an excellent short. And it works wonderfully as a fetish movie if seeing young women getting tied up and mutilated is your cup of tea. As a feature movie it's just dire.\n\nUnusually for a horror movie, it features a young professional woman in one of the leading roles -- and she doesn't even get raped and mutilated in the first five minutes for being a harlot! She investigates a magician who performs gory tricks in his show, with the same girls he performed his tricks on later dieing accordingly. This repeats itself no less than four times (if I counted correctly), each scene lasting maybe ten minutes and being as linear as train tracks in a desert, until her boyfriend muses: \"All those girls who went on stage in the show died in the same manner later in the evening. Maybe there's a connection?\". His girlfriend is so impressed by his cleverness that she proceeds to fornicate him out of gratitude -- and rightly so. It was the most intelligent moment of the entire movie.\n\nI'm not asking for too much, am I, here? I just want to be entertained. For that, I'm willing to forfeit good taste, intelligent plot, competent acting at the door. In the Wizard Of Gore, though, Herschell Gordon Lewis reveals himself as a gore fetishist. The premise of blurring reality and imagination may be interesting, but it's never developed into a story. Fail!"
