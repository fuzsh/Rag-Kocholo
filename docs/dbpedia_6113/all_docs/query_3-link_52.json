        "text": "The Wizard of Gore: A Conversation with Tom Savini (2016)\n\n*** 1/2 (out of 4)\n\nThis eighteen-minute featurette is an interview with Tom Savini, which can be found on the Italian Blu-ray release of DAWN OF THE DEAD. The first portion of the conversation has Savini talking about his Vietnam days and how this helped influence his make-up style. From here he tells a few nice stories about DAWN OF THE DEAD but then he jumps around throughout his career, which includes stories about directing NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and then working on FRIDAY THE 13TH and Dario Argento's TRAUMA. He even talks about his thoughts on Romero's DIARY OF THE DEAD but he admits that he hasn't seen SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD. If you're a fan of Savini then you'll obviously want to check this out. If you are a fan then you already know that Tom is always great to listen to and that's the case here as he tells some very good stories and shares his thoughts on his career as well as a few other things that he wished he had done."
