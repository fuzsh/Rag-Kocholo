        "text": "My undergraduate degree is in human development ‚Äì basically, a comprehensive and practical approach to developmental psychology. I am still interested in the social sciences and how I can apply classic as well as cutting-edge thought leadership to my work. I was reading some comments the other day about having a growth mindset, and I started thinking about the concepts of self-efficacy and locus of control that I studied way back when. SELF-EFFICACY üí° The belief in your ability to succeed üí° Having confidence in your ability to control your behavior, influence your environment and stay motivated üí° Remember the book The Little Engine That Could‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI think I can!‚Äù LOCUS OF CONTROL üí° How strongly people believe they have control over the situations and experiences that affect their lives üí° Psychologists consider it a personality trait üí° People with an INTERNAL locus of control believe what happens to them is greatly influenced by their own abilities, choices, actions and mistakes üí° People with an EXTERNAL locus of control tend to feel that other forces ‚Äì random chance, environmental factors, actions of others ‚Äì are more responsible for the events that occur in their lives GROWTH MINDSET üí° People with a growth mindset believe their talents can be developed through hard work, input from others, feedback, reflection and focus üí° They view challenges, failures and mistakes as opportunities for learning and growth üí° They have determination and a willingness to try new things EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING üí° Means learning by doing and then reflecting on the experience to draw conclusions and insights üí° Is emphasized in development planning and the 70-20-10 model üí° In the HBR article ‚ÄúCrucibles of Leadership‚Äù (2002) the authors contend that experiencing and learning from extreme challenges is an indicator of true leadership I think there are some common threads here. Do you agree?\n\nCompanies today need staff who can think independently and possess vital soft skills like work ethic, effective communication, teamwork, creativity, empathy, and leadership. These skills pave the way for career and life achievements, and they are irreplaceable by AI. In a time when artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming classrooms and shaping future workplaces, educators must emphasize the value of being human. This unique human aspect is precisely what future employers are seeking. Despite the surge in automated technologies, there's a growing demand for individuals who excel in soft skills‚Äîattributes that machines cannot replicate. For example, consider a scenario where a team must navigate through a complex project requiring negotiation, empathy, and creative problem-solving. While AI can manage tasks and analyze data, the human touch understands emotions, leads with compassion, and fosters collaboration that leads to success. The imperative to nurture these skills begins now, ensuring our students are not just prepared for the future workforce but are indispensable to it.\n\nI was recently unlucky to miss out on an exciting job. No hard feelings: I've enough experience splitting hairs between excellent candidates from the other side not to take it personally, plus it's really a bit too early for me to be looking. I left with a good impression of the organisation, having been treated with respect throughout, including being offered feedback. I'm not well-practiced in competency-based interviews so I was particularly keen to hear back. One comment in particular stuck out: that I had not been specific enough about my individual contribution, and too often referred to things that 'we' had done, rather than what I had done. Oof. That was an interesting one. Most of my writing and thinking at the moment is academic, where first person writing is tolerated, but definitely not encouraged, so partly it's just a quirk of speech. But also, what I least enjoy about PhD work is how solitary it is. As is the nature of modern work, pretty much everything I am proud of has been a team effort. Chatting with the lovely Lenny, he wondered whether gender affects responses: are women less likely than men to claim their individual achievements? Particularly when, as is common with women, I'd say one of my biggest strengths at work is being the glue. And then there's the whole idea that what you're best at is what you do effortlessly, and therefore struggle to break down: you just do it, you don't really think about how. Anyway, in response to the feedback I have been given, I'll be booking some time with the careers service and my lovely Women in Transport mentor to think about how I can identify my special contribution so that I can be more successful when I apply to similar roles in the future. See - progress already!\n\nHave you ever considered that skills development and personal growth are distinct journeys? It's a common assumption that they go hand in hand, but with a Doctorate in Psychology, I argue that personal growth transcends the realm of skills. Let's break it down with an example. Meet Sam and Dave, both successful corporate executives. Sam learns to use AI tech in his practice to handle client tasks. Impressed with the efficiency, he finds more time for client work. A classic example of skills development, that falls within the 'standard' business definition of personal development. Dave learns to use AI tech in his practice to handle client tasks. Every time Dave engages with AI, he experiences a subtle resistance building within himself. He senses a tightness in his chest. ü§î Rather than dismissing it, Dave digs deeper. He uses a process of self-inquiry. He discovers an underlying struggle with control. Armed with this insight, Dave adopts daily practices to manage emotions and learns to let go. The result? A transformed Dave, who not only embraces AI but his team has started to notice he‚Äôs more relaxed and isn‚Äôt micro-managing them as much. That‚Äôs Personal Growth. Same skill, two different journeys. Skills development may boost your expertise, but personal growth is the catalyst that truly changes the game. Now, with all this in mind, I‚Äôd love to hear your take! Do you agree or disagree? #personaldevelopment #skillsdevelopment #growthmindset #professionaldevelopment #professionalgrowth #emotionalintelligence #leadershipgrowth #leadershipevolution #corporatecoaching\n\nHave you ever wondered what it really takes to change behavior, whether it's in yourself, your team, or your clients? When you're looking for personal and professional growth, understanding the mechanics of behavior change is crucial. B.J. Fogg's Behavior Model offers a fascinating lens through which we can examine how behaviors are initiated and sustained. At its core, the model presupposes that three elements must converge for a behavior to occur: *Motivation *Ability, and a *Prompt (or Trigger) But how can we apply this knowledge in real-world scenarios? Whether you're a leader aiming to inspire your team, a professional looking to instill new habits, or a marketer trying to influence consumer behavior, Fogg's model provides actionable insights into the complexities of human behavior. Motivation: Understand what drives people to take action. Is it the desire to gain pleasure or avoid pain? Perhaps social acceptance or the fear of rejection? Ability: Simplify the action. If a behavior is too hard, no amount of motivation will make it habitual. How can we make desired behaviors easier to adopt? Prompt: Identify the right triggers. Without a prompt, the desired behavior is unlikely to occur. What timely cues can lead to the behavior we want to see? By dissecting the elements of the Behavior Model, we gain a deeper understanding of how to effect meaningful change. This insight is invaluable not just in personal development, but also in designing products, services, and environments that encourage positive behaviors. I invite you to dive deeper into B.J. Fogg's Behavior Model and explore how it can be applied to foster growth and change in your personal and professional life.\n\n‚ÄúWe struggle to get things done, even within our own company.‚Äù Darrell Velegol, PhD 2023nov02 Another in this series of ‚ÄúInnovation Opportunities‚Äù. SITUATION: One client was working to get a certain recommendation about a chemical analysis from another unit in the company, but week after week it seemed like something was getting in the way, some emergency. PROBLEM: How can we get things done, when we depend on others? ROOT CAUSE: Others probably don‚Äôt share our goals, even within the same company. They might have no ‚Äúskin in the game‚Äù for our project. IMPACT: If a product is anticipated to have $50 MM/y revenue, two weeks delay is $2 MM loss! COACHING TIP: People respond to INCENTIVES, like time off, more fun assignments, higher pay, or gain in reputation. So as much as you want to raise hell, avoid it. Find a path to incentivize the person, and make sure to follow through. STRUGGLES BEFORE: Before we started, nobody on the team really knew the person in analytical chemistry, and she had no direct connection to our project. So she wasn‚Äôt responsive to our requests. VICTORY AFTER: We found a higher ranked person in analytical, who was not only able to talk the same language, but also to give thanks publicly (and to leadership) for ‚Äúthe great work this person did for us‚Äù. Now the harder she worked, the more visibly her reputation grew. The work got done. Even in the same company, incentivize and appreciate others as much as you can.\n\nThe relationship between a Supervisor and supervisee is must during a PhD. A successful relationship between a PhD student and their supervisor is built on trust, communication, mutual respect, and a shared commitment to the student's academic growth. Here are some tips for building a good relationship with your PhD supervisor: Get to know your supervisor: Before you begin your PhD, get to know your supervisor's working style. Communicate regularly: Keep your supervisor updated on the progress of your work. Be comfortable speaking about your research aspirations, worries, and difficulties with them. Demonstrate your interests: Clearly state your research interests and how they align with the supervisor's expertise. Be honest: Be honest with your supervisor. Discuss your goals: Have a detailed discussion about your goals and aspirations. Be willing to learn: Show active interest in their research and be willing to learn from them. Respect their point of view: Make sure that you are following their guidance and advice. Keep them aware of your other responsibilities: Keep them aware of what else you are doing mathematically, outside of our projects. Don't back down from challenges: Adopt a growth mindset. Be available: Supervisors should make themselves accessible for frequent meetings and be willing to offer support and criticism"
