        "text": "rosenberg.JPG\n\nSenate President Stan Rosenberg (D-Amherst) and Sen. Michael Rodrigues (D-Westport) talk about their upcoming Commonwealth Conversations tour at the Statehouse on Feb. 3, 2015.\n\n(SHIRA SCHOENBERG / THE REPUBLICAN)\n\nBOSTON - Senate President Stan Rosenberg, D-Amherst, and Senate Minority Leader Bruce Tarr, R-Gloucester, are kicking off an eight-stop listening tour of the state on Wednesday in Western Massachusetts.\n\nSen. Michael Rodrigues, D-Westport, who is coordinating the effort, said the goal of the Commonwealth Conversations tour is to listen to the people of Massachusetts, without any particular bill or policy in mind. \"We shouldn't be directing the conversation. We should be creating an opportunity for people to talk and for us to listen,\" Rodrigues said.\n\nAs MassLive.com previously reported, the tour will kick off with a town hall forum at the Berkshire South Regional Community Center, a tour of the Western Massachusetts Correctional Alcohol Center, a tour of Hoppe Technologies in Chicopee and a town hall forum at Holyoke Community College.\n\nIt will continue with visits to eight regions of the state, between now and March 11. The day-long visits are being coordinated by the senators representing each region. Rosenberg and Tarr have committed to attending each one, and senators from around the state are invited to attend to learn about the concerns of residents of each region. There will be a public forum in each community, which will be live-streamed or recorded.\n\n\"The success of this will be measured two years from now at the end of the legislative session when we look back and see if we created, drafted and passed public policy as a result of the listening tour,\" Rodrigues said.\n\nTarr said the tour will allow residents to get \"a sense of the bipartisanship we have in the Senate chamber.\"\n\nLawmakers have toured the state before to get residents' opinions on specific policies - for example, gun legislation. But this will be the first tour done without a specific topic in mind. \"We're directly involving the public in a way I think is unprecedented,\" Tarr said.\n\nRosenberg, who was just elected Senate president in January, has pledged to increase transparency in the Senate. Rosenberg said the listening tour is meant to send a message about government transparency. \"The government belongs to the people,\" Rosenberg said. \"If the people engage, the legislature and the governor will hear. It's our responsibility to provide opportunities for the people to engage.\""
