        "text": "Humanities & Social Sciences\n\n#PROFspective: Combined Advanced Degree Program (CADP) in Subject Matter Education: English Major Dominique DiGiacomo\n\nToday we feature Dominique DiGiacomo, a rising senior in the Combined Advanced Degree Program (CADP) in Subject Matter Education: English program, minors in International Studies and Asian Studies, and a Certificate of Undergraduate Studies in Japanese. Dominique is a commuter student this coming year from Atco, NJ (Camden County).\n\nOn your busiest day, what academic, non-academic, and social responsibilities are you juggling?\n\nOn my busiest day, I am juggling two to three classes along with an opening shift (6:30-11 a.m.) for work as a building manager at the student center, an hour workout at the gym/kickboxing, an hour meeting for my second job, and a club meeting in which I am the vice president.\n\nDid you ever have a moment of uncertainty within your major? How did you get through the challenge?\n\nYes, I have experienced a moment of uncertainty within my major. There was a time in which I was not enjoying my education classes as much as my classes that were going towards my international studies minor. In order to get through this challenge, I talked to my teachers as well as those who I trusted to confide in them and ask for their opinions. This moment helped me to rediscover my passion for education and it also helped me to combine both my passion for education and international studies into one.\n\nTell us about one moment that made you feel like Rowan was the right fit for you.\n\nAfter my freshman year, I had the opportunity to work as a PROS (Peer Referral and Orientation Staff) member for Rowan orientations, as well as an SCCA staff member in the game room. The moment I started these two jobs was the moment I felt I really belonged at Rowan University. Through these jobs, I not only met new friends, but I also formed new families within the Rowan community. Working for Rowan really helped me to feel at home within the university.\n\nTell us about your transition into college and how you pushed through any challenges.\n\nTransitioning into college was definitely a nerve-racking situation. It was my first time living away from home, as well as the first time I had so much freedom in my life. These nerves, however, only lasted for the first week of school. Overcoming these nerves proved to be a lot easier than I had expected. I made sure to be social, interact with my roommate and my classmates and joined a few clubs. I also realized that every freshman in college was in the same boat; they were all nervous and looking to make friends. After realizing this, my transition to college became a whole lot easier.\n\nWhat advice would you give your high school self about choosing a college?\n\nDon’t feel pressured by your friends to choose a certain school. Go on tours, interact with students, and get excited about going to college. Choose the place you feel most at home because college truly does become your second home.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, rising sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\nPhotos contributed by:\n\nDominique DiGiacomo\n\nJunior Major Moments: Law and Justice Studies Major Matthew McGrath Talks Internships and Research Opportunities\n\nToday we feature rising senior Law and Justice Studies major Matthew McGrath. Matthew is a Resident Assistant in the Whitney Center from Middletown, NJ (Monmouth County).\n\nCould you share your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nOver the course of three years I have completed at Rowan, my favorite experience is a more recent one. During the fall semester of my junior year, I took a class called “Critical Issues in American Law Enforcement.” Dr. Evan Sorg was the instructor for this course; I had taken an introductory Law & Justice course with him during my freshman year.\n\nDr. Sorg’s class relies heavily on research conducted within the criminal justice field, and I was often interested in the articles we were required to read for class. This course got me engaged in research and provided me with a more academic approach to law & justice. This past spring, Dr. Sorg reached out to me and subsequently offered me a research assistant position.\n\nDr. Sorg and I are currently working together in order to create a systematic review of immigration enforcement and the impact it has on crime in America. Not only is the work fulfilling, but Dr. Sorg is an awesome advisor and has definitely become one of my role models in the field of criminal justice research.\n\nWhat is the most amazing or interesting ​thing you’ve learned in your major this year?\n\nPrior to enrolling in some of the higher-level courses Rowan has to offer, I held the notion that Law & Justice relies primarily on the information presented in textbooks. This, however, is incorrect, as I have learned in Dr. Sorg’s classes as well as in other criminal justice research-oriented courses. Research is a constantly-evolving field that requires dedicated attention to detail. While others may find it to be a bit dry, I am intrigued by criminal justice research and the opportunities it may lend me moving forward.\n\nWhat pre-professional experiences are helping to support your growth?\n\nOne pre-professional experience that has definitely supported my growth is an internship I completed with the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender this past spring. As a Drug Court System Navigator with the NJOPD, I had the opportunity to collaborate with over 150 Gloucester County Drug Court participants to ensure they act in accordance with probation guidelines. I was also responsible for reaching out to local businesses with the goal of providing Drug Court participants with employment as well as assisting them with essential matters including healthcare and housing.\n\nNot only did this internship provide me with a quality professional experience that will greatly benefit me moving forward, but it was also a fulfilling position that I looked forward to every single day. I learned a significant amount during my time with the NJOPD and this experience also introduced me to the field of social work, which is something I am now considering for my future.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\n#PROFspective: Meet Japanese Culture-Enthusiast, History and International Studies Major Sean French\n\nToday, we speak to Sean French, a senior History and International Studies dual major from Haddon Township (Camden County). Sean, a commuter and first-generation student, holds a leadership position in Rowan’s Japanese Culture Club. He tells us more about the club, his majors and why he chose Rowan!\n\nWhy did you choose your majors?\n\nI’ve loved history since elementary school, so it made sense to study what I loved. I was originally enrolled as a History and Education major to teach history at the high school level. During my sophomore year, however, I decided to change to History and International Studies (Asia studies concentration) after falling in love with Japanese culture and decided to study abroad in Japan.\n\nWhy did you choose Rowan?\n\nI chose Rowan because it was known for having a robust Education department, in state and nearby, so I could commute to school!\n\nTake us through a typical Rowan day for you!\n\nThe typical Rowan day for me (pre-Covid) was waking up at 6 a.m., going to the gym near my house, making breakfast, then going down to campus to study at the library or go to class. Then, later in the day, I would go to an e-board meeting for the Japanese Culture Club (I was previously VP and will be President beginning Fall 2020).\n\nAt our meetings we would talk about Japanese culture, have activities and games such as karaoke, a bento box competition and arts nights including calligraphy and making origami.\n\nThe Japanese Culture Club is a place we’ve worked to make welcoming and open to folks of all backgrounds, where you could hang out with friends and enjoy learning and talking about all things Japan. We’re hoping to continue club meetings this coming semester, be that online or safely in person.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, rising senior music industry major\n\nPhotos by:\n\nSean French\n\nHeader photo courtesy of:\n\nUnsplash\n\nHow I Chose My Major: Exploratory Studies To Psychology Major Sydney Basis\n\nToday, we speak to rising sophomore Sydney Basis. She is from Marlboro, NJ (Monmouth County) and is an on-campus resident. Sydney is a former Exploratory Studies major who then made the decision to become a Psychology major. She’s going to tell us a little more about her experience as an Exploratory Studies major and how she eventually chose the right fit for her!\n\nHow and why did you find Rowan?\n\nWhen the time came to start applying for colleges, I had not heard of Rowan yet. Some of my friends were talking about applying to Rowan because they had heard great things about it, so I decided to look into it. After looking around Rowan’s website, I decided to book a campus tour and immediately loved the campus environment. Before my freshman year started, I was still concerned that I could have made the wrong choice but after going to Rowan, I knew that it was the perfect choice for me and I couldn’t have picked a better school.\n\nWhy did you originally choose Exploratory Studies?\n\nI chose Exploratory Studies because going into my freshman year, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I was really excited to try out all different areas of study because I knew I would eventually find the perfect major for me, which I did. This program was so amazing because it really gave me the freedom to try out everything I was interested in and I was not stuck to just one subject matter.\n\nWhat has been your favorite experience as an Exploratory Studies major?\n\nMy favorite experience as an Exploratory Studies major has definitely been meeting people throughout all of the different classes I have taken. Since you are taking so many different classes to find your interests, you meet people from all different majors and all different career paths. I also enjoyed the Exploratory Studies seminars that Rowan held to give students an idea of what each major at Rowan was like and it gave us the opportunity to speak with the advisors in charge of the majors. This was very helpful to me.\n\nWhat major are you going into?\n\nI decided to become a Psychology major because I realized that I would like to become an occupational therapist in the future. Although Rowan does not have an OT program, their Psychology program and other classes outside of this program will prepare me for graduate school, which is something I am very excited about.\n\nHow did you figure out what major was “the one”?\n\nI was always very interested in psychology, but never really knew what could be done with this degree. I looked at the program guide on Rowan’s website and I loved the classes that it offered. I then looked further and researched the different career opportunities in the field. I found occupational therapy through my research and knew that’s what I wanted to do in the future. Searching around Rowan’s website helped a lot through this whole process.\n\nAny advice to Exploratory Studies majors? Or general advice to Rowan students?\n\nFor any Exploratory Studies students, I would definitely tell you that this program is not just about finding what programs you do like, it is also about finding ones that you do not like. It may be disappointing when you do not enjoy a class that you thought you would be interested in, but it is ultimately bringing you closer to a decision because you were able to rule out that field. This will break down your choices and find the perfect major and career for you which is the main goal.\n\nAlso, if there are any fields of study that you do enjoy already, I would look into what careers you can do with that kind of degree. This is what helped me find my major and dream job. The Rowan website is very helpful, so you should check it out!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\nPhoto provided by:\n\nSydney Basis, sophomore psychology major\n\nHeader photo courtesy of:\n\nUnsplash\n\nSenior Reflects: Sociology Major Peterson Dossous Strives to “Never Stop Thinking and Learning” in His Field\n\nToday we feature Peterson Dossous, a recent Rowan graduate who studied Sociology from Jersey City, NJ (Hudson County). Peterson reflects on his experience as a Prof and how he made the most out of his college experience.\n\nDid you have an on-campus job?\n\nI worked for the Office of Career Advancement, which consisted of filing documents, answering phones, managing meetings, preparing career fairs, engaging and interacting with students. It was a great opportunity to acquire well-rounded skills to apply in an office setting post-grad. It enhanced my customer service, Excel sheet and interpersonal communication skills.\n\nDo you have any mentors at Rowan?\n\nMr. Richard Jones, [Vice President of Student Engagement], has been a mentor of mine. I was part of a new program he was starting up to best interact with students and increase student participation on campus, which helped to broaden my horizon.\n\nWhat is your favorite academic or professional accomplishment?\n\nThat I graduated and am in the position I’m in. Not everyone gets the opportunity or finds the motivation to go to college where I’m from.\n\nWhat got you interested in your intended field?\n\nI was always interested in finding the reasons why people do the things they do. Originally, I was a psych major but changed due to the amount of school you need to go through and knowing how much money people pay psychologists to receive help. I want to figure out the common problem a group of people have and create a space for them to relate and resolve the problem.\n\nSociology keeps the mind running and I love it. I will never stop thinking and learning in my field. I get to live and learn through everybody else. I will use their testimonies for future experiences.\n\nEventually, I’d love to help traumatized soldiers transition into society. Every group of people is institutionalized in their own way. Students in school, inmates in prison, soldiers in combat. Soldiers don’t have an accessible outlet. Most people can call a friend, parent, or mentor to mellow you out; but as a soldier, not many people can relate to the suffering or they have difficulty opening up. Talking to a counselor engages everyone in the discussion. It teaches them the tools to reclaim a “normal” lifestyle and how to handle and cope with certain environments.\n\nWhat knowledge or skills have you developed through your time at Rowan that you will take into you for future endeavors?\n\nThe most important lesson I’ve learned at Rowan is exercising social skills — articulating a conversation, guiding important discussions, interacting in the corporate world … being punctual, organized and accountable.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nAlyssa Bauer, public relations graduate\n\nPhotos courtesy of:\n\nPeterson Dossous\n\n#PROFspective: Feeling Like a Member of the Student Body Through the Online Learning Experience\n\nMeet Liberal Studies major Krystal Mannering from Atlantic County, NJ. Krystal, a first-generation college student, works full-time while running a business, providing for her household and taking care of a toddler. Read her perspective on how Rowan has made her feel “accepted and welcomed” as an online student.\n\nBeing an online student for most of my educational career, the need for a connection with a physical campus might seem like a translucent goal. Common speculation is online students aren’t receiving “the college experience” that an in-person student receives.\n\nFor many online colleges and educational facilities, this statement is true. I’ve attended two other online colleges throughout my career, and Rowan University is the first online program where I’ve felt like an actual member of the student body.\n\nFrom the moment I called Rowan, I felt accepted and welcomed. My heart had just been broken by my current school at the time, and as I was sobbing uncontrollably, I began calling multiple schools and explained my situation. The first Rowan advisor I spoke to was faced with the challenge of my vulnerability but ensured me that even as an online student, my role had a place.\n\nI work a full-time job, have a home to provide for, a business, and a toddler to take care of, so online schooling is my only option. Two other schools stated they couldn’t help me, and another didn’t answer the phone. The advisors at Rowan greeted me with a cheerful attitude and helped me every step of the way. Even though I live an hour away, the Rowan staff took the necessary time I needed to feel comfortable with my decision.\n\nAs I entered my first semester, I was armed with eagerness and fear. I wasn’t sure what to expect. I wasn’t sure that I was going to feel the acceptance that I craved. I joined Rowan’s social media platforms and I was quickly comforted by fellow Rowan students. One student suggested that I attend the campus orientation and I signed up for the next available event (highly recommended!).\n\nWalking through the Rowan campus reassured my decision to attend Rowan as an online student. It felt right to walk through the halls, dorms and college grounds. Each orientation leader was extremely informative to the incoming freshman students, and each demonstration I attended that day began to further confirm my choice.\n\nThe orientation leaders expressed that online students are offered the same accommodations as in-person students. My friend (and now fellow classmate) and I walked through the streets of the campus, and we were presented with cheerful little shops, wonderful eateries, statues and artifacts plastered throughout the campus.\n\nAs the event concluded, my friend and I decided to make our way out to Richard Wacker Stadium, the stadium that I will graduate in. Being eligible to attend a physical graduation as an online student is very important to me and is one of the many perks of studying online with Rowan University. As we stepped foot onto the track that surrounds the beautiful stadium, the reality of my choice to attend Rowan began to set in.\n\nOverwhelmed with emotion, I was so thankful to have found Rowan University. The online classes are more organized than other schools that I’ve attended. The professors are extremely involved, and helpful if you maintain a consistent work ethic. The alumni at Rowan reassured me that my needs weren’t burdensome. Class sizes are manageable, and classmates are a welcoming wealth of knowledge. Each day, I continue to be thankful for my choice to attend Rowan University as an online student. My future is clear now that I’m a PROF!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nKrystal Mannering, liberal studies major\n\nJunior Major Moments: Law and Justice Major, Track and Field Captain Francis Terry\n\nToday we feature Francis Terry, a Law and Justice Studies major from Laurel Springs, NJ (Camden County) who recently completed his junior year at Rowan. Francis, a first-generation college student, is a transfer student from Neumann University and lives off-campus.\n\nCould you share your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nMy favorite moment with a faculty member was with my coaches on March 15, 2018 in Birmingham, Alabama at the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships. I finished 5th in the nation and earned my first All-American accolade. When they called my name I stepped on the podium and looked at the cameras, the crowd and my teammates cheering for me. My assistant coach, Coach Tate, handed me the medal. I remember hugging Coach Tate thanking him for everything he’s done for me.\n\nWe took our picture and I had to get my pants and jacket back on and cool down because I had another race in about 2 hours. The 4×400 was the last event of the day and we finished 3rd in the 4×400. That placement would place us 3rd in the nation as a team. So after I hugged my teammates and congratulated the other teams I got back on the podium. When I got off the podium I saw my Head Coach, Coach Dimit, crying tears of joy so we hugged. We were all so excited to be ranked 3rd in the nation as a team. No, we didn’t win the National Championship, but we were all still proud of every single one of our teammates.\n\nIs there anyone who is a visionary in your field who inspires you and goes above and beyond for you? I wouldn’t say he’s a visionary in my field, but someone who has impacted me tremendously at Rowan University is Eddy. He’s one of the janitors at Rowan University in Esby Gym [editor’s note: this staff member was identified as Edward Garrison, senior maintenance worker for both Esby Gym and The John Green Team House]. Eddy is one of the loudest, but also down-to-earth men I have ever met. Every time I walk into Esby Gym I can just feel his presence. He always screams “Yo Francis,” then shakes my hand and asks how my day is going. Some days we just stand in the hall and talk about sports, life, or anything on our minds that day.\n\nNo matter what, Eddy always makes time to say “Hi” to someone. He’s one of the hardest-working guys I know, and his attitude is always upbeat no matter what. I may not want to be a janitor in my lifetime, but I want to mimic the way he looks at life — his demeanor, work ethic, attitude and just his everyday life of bringing happiness to others. Eddy is one most influential people I’ve encountered throughout my life. Every day I’m blessed to have met a man like Eddy and have him to help shape me for the future.\n\nWhat is the most amazing or interesting ​thing you’ve learned in your major this year? The most amazing thing I’ve learned in my major this year was in my Law Seminar Class with Professor Stone. Even though the majority of the class was taught online due to COVID, this class really opened my eyes. During the course of the semester, we had to use an Excel spreadsheet and take our 40 questions and ask every student who was enrolled in that class questions about their family life. We then had to compare all of our work and compare it to our thesis. We wrote about a 10-page paper on our thesis and results that we calculated throughout the semester. It was an awesome experience working with classmates and developing our own short theory.\n\nWhat pre-professional experiences are helping to support your growth? Due to COVID, I had one internship canceled, but two pre-professional experiences I have had would be being a Team Captain for the Men’s Track and Field team and working on the Board for S.A.A.C (Student-Athlete Advisory Committee). Being one of the Captains in the team I’ve definitely had to look at myself differently. Over the past 4 years at Neumann and Rowan, I’ve had many people to look up to and follow. Jeffery Tucker was one of the Captains in 2018, and he’s played a huge role in my life on and off the track.\n\nBeing a captain you’re held to a higher standard. As a captain, I’ve been in difficult situations with my own teammates but we’ve worked past them together. I always try and make myself available for my teammates or even other student-athletes. We all have stuff going on in our lives and every day I’ve learned something new from being around other student-athletes. When you’re around 70+ teammates and being one of the leaders of the team it gets very stressful. Being a captain doesn’t make me higher than anyone else, we are all still on the same team representing the same school and athletic department. I strive to represent myself in the best way possible in the classroom, on the track and even within the community. I hope that I can impact someone’s life for the better the way Jeff did for me.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, rising sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\nJunior Major Moments: Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management Major Connor Crafton-Tempel\n\nToday we feature Disaster Preparedness and Management major Connor Crafton-Tempel from Freehold, NJ (Monmouth County). Connor is a transfer student and commutes to campus.\n\nCould you share your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nProfessor Carty, who taught my Disaster Planning, Mitigation, and Recovery course at our Camden campus, was a really big influence on me. When I first came into the program, I knew I wanted to work for the Philadelphia Office of Emergency Management (OEM), but I didn’t know exactly what I wanted to do with the OEM.\n\nThen, Professor Carty was teaching us about threat and risk assessments, just before the COVID-19 outbreak turned into a pandemic. It was during her class that I realized I wanted to go into disaster planning and specially work on disease-related disasters (mainly epidemics and pandemics).\n\nWhat is the most amazing or interesting ​thing you’ve learned in your major this year?\n\nI think that the most interesting thing I learned this year was how to perform a threat assessment. This is becoming really helpful, since my parish has asked me to help with the reopening.\n\nWhat pre-professional experiences are helping to support your growth?\n\nI’d have to say my honor society (Epsilon Pi Phi, the DPEM honor society) and Rowan University EMS. Rowan EMS is helping me gain new skills as an EMT, and the honor society is beneficial for getting connections within the industry.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nJunior Major Moments: Modern Languages and Linguistics Major Charisse N.

I interned for the Office of Assemblyman Daniel R. Benson (14th Legislative District, Hamilton), The New Jersey State League of Municipalities and the Camden County Democratic Committee.\n\nEver since joining Mu Sigma Upsilon Sorority, Incorporated I was able to connect with sisters and mentors who continue to help learn more about different backgrounds and cultures, which I believe is essential to know before entering the workforce.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nMelanie Sbaraglio, public relations and advertising graduate\n\n20 Classes at Rowan to Further Education on Race & Social Justice\n\nAs the Division of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion stated earlier this month, “Universities are not exempt from facing issues that plague our society and threaten our democracy.” It is extremely important to recognize these issues and take the necessary steps to educate ourselves and those around us on the dangers of racism, to start making the changes the world needs to see.\n\nThese courses* are available to Rowan students, focusing on the history of race, the dangers that racism instills in society, and ways that we can prevent racism as a community.\n\nBlack Lives Matter: An Ethnographic Perspective of The Movement (AFST 11350)\n\nOppression, injustice, and violence has plagued black and brown lives through a history of colonization in the United States.

This teacher would set up activities for us in class to enable networking with each other so we would feel comfortable interacting in real-world situations.\n\nIs there anyone who is a visionary in your field who inspires you? I am truly inspired by Professor Stanley Yeldell; he was one of the first professors to join the Law & Justice Studies department when Rowan was known as Glassboro State College.

Not because I was not hardworking, but because my memory was almost nonexistent. It did not imply if I went to class because I couldn’t concentrate. Not like, “Oh! I am just distracted,” but like, “Did I even go to class today? What did we talk about?” “How are my siblings back home?” “Who’s helping my mom?” It was scary and frustrating.

I’m the type of person who has many questions and I was able to get the answers thanks to Rachel.\n\nDo you want to give a thank you shout out to your family, friends, advisors or mentors? Most importantly I would like to thank my parents and family for always supporting me throughout my college career. As a first-generation student I faced many battles, but I was able to overcome them thanks to my loved ones. I would like to thank my advisor once again for always helping me and make me understand that sometimes plans can change and that’s okay.

This class sparked the moment when I knew that Political Science was the right major for me.”\n\nWhat was your favorite or most meaningful personal moment at Rowan?\n\n“My favorite moment at Rowan was at transfer orientation when I made an abundance of new friendships with those of similar majors and goals as myself.”\n\nWhat are your career aspirations and how did the people or programs at Rowan help to support you with those aspirations?\n\n“With the encouraging words from many professors, I took my LSATS my junior year and am planning on attending law school in the fall of 2021.

She is from Egg Harbor Township, NJ (Atlantic County). In her time at Rowan she spent half of her time living on campus and the other half in a house off-campus. She reflects on her time at Rowan and tells us some of her favorite experiences and where she’s headed to next!\n\nWhat are your career aspirations and how did the people or programs at Rowan help to support you with those aspirations?\n\n“I had some trouble when I first came to Rowan figuring out what I wanted to be. I started off as a Civil Engineering major, then I went into Music Education, and eventually Elementary Education and Liberal Studies. It took me a while, but through taking all of these different classes, I was able to realize my passion for education. I want to be an elementary school teacher and, one day, an administrator in a public school district.\n\nThe first professor who helped me realize this passion of mine was Dr. Adrian Barnes in my Music Education classes. He showed me a passion for education that I learned from and took with me in my future education classes and I will forever be grateful for his teachings. My other professors in my Education classes, such as Nancy Pagliughi, Arlene Stampa, and Gary Dentino, are who took that passion I had for teaching and shaped me into a real teacher. I will always remember their teachings when I have a classroom of my own. I would be remiss if I did not also mention my Writing Arts and English professors who helped me realize my talent for writing and showed me how to use that to make me into a better teacher. My professors Keri Mikulski, Dr. Jennifer Courtney, Amanda Haruch, and Dr. Yvonne Hammond, all saw my potential and shaped me into the writer and educator I am today. I have had so many amazing professors at Rowan that have given me knowledge and skills that I will be forever grateful for!”\n\nWhat was your favorite or most meaningful personal moment at Rowan?\n\n“My most meaningful moments at Rowan were when I was President of my sorority, Alpha Sigma Alpha. I met so many of my greatest friends there and almost every one of my good memories comes from them. Going to Greek Week, volunteering at the Special Olympics, and recruitment are just a few things that I will always remember and treasure from my time with ASA. My roommates, Rachael, Sara, and Nicole, were with me through three years of being at Rowan and they were the reason I called Rowan my home. Looking back at my time in college in the future, I know I will fondly remember the times I spent with them the most.”\n\nTell us about your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes:\n\n“One memory I have of my experience in the College of Education that I think I will always remember was being in Professor Gary Dentino’s class. Almost every single day, he would email us a whole letter telling us how proud he was of us and how we will change the world. He took the time out of his day to handwrite personal letters to us as a class almost daily. Even when my classes were getting tough and I felt like I was falling behind, I would read his daily email and feel like I truly had someone in my corner. His dedication to forming a positive and uplifting relationship with his students is something I hope to carry with me when I become a teacher someday.”\n\nShout outs:\n\n“I’d like to give a special shoutout to my best friends in the entire world: Sara Riegel, Nicole Traeger, and Rachael Kolmins. Thank you for always being there for me through it all. Another special shoutout to all of my ladies at Alpha Sigma Alpha, especially my big Rosie Nanfara and my little Emily Fishman. Keep on joyously living each day to its ultimate good! Shoutouts to other amazing people I met at Rowan like Hersh and Fraidy Loschak from Chabad at Rowan, Celeste DelRusso and Donna Mehalchick-Opal from the Rowan Writing Center, and all of my fellow Edgewood RAs. Thank you for making a difference in my life! One more shoutout goes to my boyfriend, Mark Kozak, for being my rock throughout my years at Rowan. My biggest thanks will go to my parents, who are the reason that I am where I am. Thank you Mom and Dad for everything, I love you!”\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nSenior Reflects: New Grad Molly Worek Seeks to Teach Across the Globe\n\nToday we feature senior Molly Worek, an English major from Mullica Hill, NJ (Gloucester County). Molly, who commuted to campus, transferred to Rowan from Bloomsburg University & RCGC.\n\nPlease tell us about your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes? My favorite moment can’t be defined because there are simply too many to speak of. I think my favorite thing that happens in class is when I make references to something from outside of class that I am passionate about, and find out that my professors are either just as passionate, or super interested and want to learn more from me.\n\nWhat are your career aspirations and how did the people or programs at Rowan help to support you with those aspirations? I aspire to be a TEFL/TESL high school or corporate level teacher abroad in Japan. I have been on the CADP BA-MS program to become certified as a teacher in NJ, and I have also pursued the international studies minor to become more culturally aware of the world, my future students and myself. I also will have a certificate in Japanese, as well as TEFL. I hope to acquire the NJ substitute teacher endorsement as well as an exceptional education endorsement.\n\nWhat was your favorite or most meaningful personal moment at Rowan? My favorite personal moments are showing on the Rowan Equestrian Team at away shows competing against several other schools at the same time as a team and as an individual.\n\nDo you want to give a thank you shout out to your family, friends, advisors or mentors? I want to thank all of my friends, near and far, for making this journey not only possible, but enjoyable. I consider my professors, advisors and mentors to be my friends, not just Rowan employees.\n\nThis spring break I had the incredible opportunity to travel to South Africa while riding horses and learning about international culture.

She is a first generation college graduate.\n\nPlease tell us about your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nI truly enjoyed Prof. McCann’s lectures, she always had us thinking outside of the box. One night during class she had us work as a group drawing the steps to make toast, who knew there were so many steps involved. She had the class laughing and engaged and even with this simple task, she had us thinking on a whole different level. She always pushed us to be our best.\n\nWhat was your favorite or most meaningful personal moment at Rowan?\n\nWorking with the Human Services Club, brainstorming ideas and ways to give back to the community. I will miss this amazing group!!\n\nWhat are your career aspirations and how did the people or programs at Rowan help to support you with those aspirations?\n\nWorking my three field placements during my time at Rowan University has assisted me in my professional development. I was able to move up to a managerial position within my agency and entered a program that I never thought I would if it wasn’t for my field placement. Working as a vocational specialist with adults with mental health has been an amazing experience. Watching my clients grow and become integrated into the community is so rewarding, I am thankfully to have been given this opportunity.\n\nDo you want to give a thank you shout out to your family, friends, advisors or mentors?\n\nYES… Professor McCann – you have been my rock!!!

He transferred to Rowan from Rowan College at Burlington County.\n\nTell us about your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nMy favorite moment in a class at Rowan might just be the Model UN trip to New York City last April. Spending time with the whole class, experiencing the city, and feeling the important weight of being in the United Nations — interacting with student leaders from around the world. It was enlightening and a blast.\n\nWhat was your favorite or most meaningful personal moment at Rowan?\n\nGetting close to everyone in the Rowan Democrats was an amazing experience for me. I built lasting friendships in that club that I hope to carry with me throughout my life. The work we did and the experiences we had (such as inter club debates, volunteering) will remain in my memory for years.\n\nWhat are your career aspirations and how did the people or programs at Rowan help to support you with those aspirations?\n\nI am not sure of exactly what I want to do with my whole life yet. I’m sure that isn’t unique among college graduates. I plan to start my professional career this month working for International SOS. I will work for them in government services for at least a year and then attend law school. I would like to specifically and emphatically thank Dr. Dworkin and the Rowan Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship (RIPPAC) for all of the incredibly enriching events and activities they hosted on campus. RIPPAC stressed to all students the importance of internships and they provided the skills and resources to students in order to get their career aspirations off the ground: to get that internship, find that job, to write a professional resume.\n\nDo you want to give a thank you shout out to your family, friends, advisors or mentors?\n\nI want to thank my whole family for supporting me throughout my academic career. I want to thank my friends and my instructors for standing by me when I needed them most and pushing me to achieve what they knew I was able to.

We had so many great discussions in those classes. She really made me want to go to class each week.\n\nWhat was your favorite or most meaningful personal moment at Rowan?\n\nI was a founding member of the Rowan Democrats since freshman year and the President the past two years. Joining the Rowan Dems and helping build this club to where it is now was the best thing I experienced at Rowan University. Not only did it give me friends for a lifetime, I loved being at Rowan because of it. I was always told to join activities at college and it was the best decision ever. I learned so much from the events and the networks the club provided. I am sad that I am graduating and not being able to be a part of the Rowan Dems anymore but I am so happy that I created great memories throughout my four years and wish the club the best luck in the future.\n\nWhat are your career aspirations and how did the people or programs at Rowan help to support you with those aspirations?\n\nI am not sure where I want to end up in the long run, but I know I want to stay in politics if I can. During my junior year, Rowan brought in its Institute of Public Policy and Citizenship (RIPPAC). Dr. Ben Dworkin really made being a poli sci student at Rowan so much better with his events and internship guides. He really cares about his students and it shows every time he checks in with you about future aspirations. Thank you, Dr. Dworkin, for all the help these past two years and for helping me find a better passion in a field I love.\n\nDo you want to give a thank you shout out to your family, friends, advisors or mentors?\n\nI want to sincerely thank my family for supporting my dreams since I was a child. To all my friends thank you, college was tough for all of us but you all made my life at college enjoyable and I will never forget all the great times we had and hope to have in the future. To all the professors and faculty I’ve met over the years, thank you for all the support and pushing me to the best I could be. Thank you Rowan for being my home for the past four years.

Sylvia commuted to campus from home, in Pine Hill, NJ (Camden County.)\n\nCould you please tell us about your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nI’d have to say my favorite moment experience at Rowan was my second visit to the South Jersey Tech Park to work on the Warsaw VR Project. That day I got to experience the VR project inside of the CAVE and I knew then that the Warsaw Project was going to be very special and would be worth all other time and effort our multidisciplinary team puts into it.\n\nWhat was your favorite or most meaningful personal moment at Rowan?\n\nLast semester, I went to the New York Jewish Heritage Museum with the Rowan Center for the Holocaust, Genocide, and Human Rights (RCHGHR) to see the first traveling exhibit about Auschwitz outside of Europe. Being there and seeing the remnants of the atrocities of the Holocaust solidified my desire to pursue a career in Holocaust education.\n\nWhat are your career aspirations and how did the people or programs at Rowan help to support you with those aspirations?\n\nIt is my goal to work in public history, helping to educate others on the horrors of genocide so that hopefully, one day, such tragedies no longer occur. I also wish to help design a federal Holocaust curriculum and develop teaching resources for public schools. The entire history department is endlessly supportive of its students. However, I personally own much to Jennifer Rich, Stephen Hague, and Jody Russell Manning.\n\nDr. Rich brought me onto the Warsaw Project with open arms and never misses an opportunity to lift up her students and makes them feel like they can do anything. Dr. Hague always pushes back, challenging me to do better and to look at things from a different perspective. Professor Manning, apart from always adding into my personal reading list, always makes me ask the bigger questions and never accept the easy answers as true. Such skills not only serve to make me a better historian in general but also give me a wider lens to see the world.\n\nDo you want to give a thank you shout out to your family, friends, advisors or mentors?\n\nI never would have made it this far without the endless support from my parents (Pat and Ken), my fiance (Phillip), and my best friend (Steve) who have spent the last 4 years being the most patient and understanding people on the planet. I would also like to give a shout out to my friend Gina Torres who’s been stuck proofreading my papers since we met in Historical Methods.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nHumanities & Social Sciences\n\nSenior Reflects: Law & Justice Major Emilyann Colbert\n\nMeet Emilyann Colbert, a graduating senior from Sickerville, NJ (Camden County) who majored in Law & Justice and minored in Psychology.

She is an amazing professor. During my sophomore year of college I lost my uncle and it was a very difficult time in my life. Dr. Houser truly went above and beyond for me.\n\nFavorite Rowan memory: Rowan University has been full of great memories, one of my favorites would be taking a tour of the Borgata Casino in Atlantic City for my Casino Crime class during my junior year.\n\nCareer Aspirations: In the future I hope to pursue a career within probation or parole. During the summer of 2019 I had the opportunity to intern with the New Jersey State Parole Board, where I was assigned to the Sex Offender Management Unit. My internship allowed me to observe parole board hearings and tour the New Jersey State Prison. It was a great experience.\n\nShout outs! I want to thank all of my family and friends for always being so supportive. Throughout my life my mother, brother and grandparents have always been there for me. They have taught me how to be strong, determined and hard-working.

Chinasa, from Cinnaminson, NJ (Burlington County) attended 3+1 through Rowan College at Burlington County.\n\nCould you share your favorite memory?\n\nI joined the Philosophy Club of Rowan University, for me it’s very exciting. I was very honored when I got an invite to join. Unfortunately the season we are witnessing has limited our club activities. I look forward to keeping in touch with the club since Phi Kappa Tau stands for everything I believe.\n\nCould you share your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nMy experience with the academic advisors for the 3+1 program was impressive. I encountered my advisor Allie when I was looking to transfer to a four-year college from RCBC. She is an amazing individual whose professionalism is second to none. She followed up with me, and her attitude convinced me to complete my degree program through the 3+1 initiative.\n\nMy personal go-to adviser, Holly Ann Ashton, is a wonderful woman who is hands-on with any issues that I brought to her attention. This spring semester, Holly Ann went above and beyond to assist me with providing a space within the office to take my online exams for a class that required Proctotrack, which I couldn’t do in my home. It wasn’t her job, but she was interested and invested in me as a student of Rowan University that she made it possible for me to finish without issues. That’s what I call dedication and service. I appreciate Holly Ann Ashton.\n\nDo you want to give a thank you shout out to your family, friends, advisors or mentors?\n\nI want to thank my husband, who assisted me all the way without complaining. He stood by me and encouraged me that I could do this and be proud of myself. My son Zee, who believed that “Mommy is smart,” I want to say thank you.

We exchanged stories about our respective times in Washington D.C. where he went to college and where I transferred from. I also had great conversations with Professor James Jones. You can just tell he’s very passionate and knowledgeable about his job. I always loved hearing him speak.\n\nClub Involvement: I had high hopes of getting involved in more clubs/organizations this upcoming semester but COVID-19 messed up those plans. Making friends as a busy transfer student is harder, but I can say that every person that I came in contact with was very nice.\n\nCareer Aspirations: I aspire to go to law school and practice law before ultimately becoming a judge or getting involved somehow with the FBI orCIA. I haven’t decided yet, but I plan on taking the LSAT regardless. One professor that supported me with my aspirations was Professor Hoerner. She was very informative on certain aspects about entering that field and was always very encouraging.\n\nShout outs!

This collaboration aims to educate students about personal well-being options. For further updates, follow @RowanUWellness on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook.\n\nMeet Allegra Giannini, junior English major, from South Brunswick, NJ (Middlesex County.) Allegra wrote this article to connect the Rowan community. She shares, “I wrote this piece on music because I feel that music is a universal thing that connects humans together. From the meme in Bee Movie where he asks, “Ya like jazz?” music never fails to be a talking point. I’ve met countless people who have said music has saved their lives or impacted them in an equally large way. Ask practically anyone who their favorite musical artist is, and you see their eyes light up. It’s one of my favorite things because it makes me happy to see people talk so passionately about something. My article talks about how normal it is to let music have an impact on you. How it’s been clinically proven that the right music can decrease anxiety and simultaneously elevate your mood. It’s an important, yet overlooked part of our lives. But it’s a discussion worth having.”\n\nMusic has been around since the dawn of time. It began most likely with a rhythmic beating of rocks against a hard surface, and humming, to downloading a music program and mixing sounds with a keyboard. One easy way to study societal evolution is by exploring the wide range of music. Most people on this planet have a type in music. The answers often heard range from rock, indie, rap, R&B, the list is endless. One interesting question though, is what makes people have a taste? Do people tend to enjoy music they’ve grown up on? Or is it scientifically speaking people’s neurological reactions to the aesthetic sounds created. Perhaps both answers are true, but maybe there is one more. The other answer would be where one is developmentally influences the kind of music they listen to. Not just because of rhythm or melody, but perhaps because of the lyrics.\n\nWhat do people most remember about songs? Everyone has done that thing where they try to look up a song in Google, but can’t remember the title so they either type in the rhythm which looks something like, “that song that goes dum da dee dum.” Or they Google a snippet of the lyrics, they may Google, “Same as it ever was” and learn the song they were looking for is “Once in a Lifetime” by Talking Heads. Whatever the case may be, they Google the lyrics that stuck out to them the most, the ones they resonate with. Maybe the lyric “same as it ever was” perfectly describes how they feel on the inside. Those lyrics hit home, they mean something to them.\n\nIf people correlate how their lives are going with songs, they may find that they gravitate towards artists, albums or songs they feel perfectly encapsulates how they are mentally feeling, or brings up a memory. An article written by Nancy Shute for NPR from September 2013 said, “Music is a powerful cue for retrieving strong personal memories — when you kissed that girl at summer camp; the blue polka-dot dress you wore to prom; how lonely you were freshman year.” (Shute, npr.org)\n\nThat article may be from 7 years ago, but the message still stands. Music is a lot more powerful than some give it credit. Hearing a song can change someone’s mood instantaneously. It is important that it’s power is embraced. So, when the going gets tough, it’s a good idea to put on a song. Make a “Happy Times” playlist, or even a “Rad and Sad” playlist. Sometimes listening to the songs that bring on the tears is just as healthy. What’s most important is embracing the effect music has on one’s personality.\n\nLike what you see?

The history major from Nutley, NJ (Essex County) also minors in political science and international studies.\n\nJulianne has always liked history, more specifically presidential history. “Their personal lives is the better part, because you learn so much about what they did in class but then you get to know more about them as people and that kind of makes a bigger picture.”\n\nAfter a tour at Rowan University Julianne really liked the university, as did her mom. “My mom really pushed me to come here and I am really thankful she did that.”\n\nJulianne started off as a history education major, but then decided to drop education and focus on history. “It was really the faculty from the history department that showed me that there was so much more I could do with history aside from teaching, which I never knew before. The faculty opened my eyes, there is so much I can do.”\n\nDr. Jennifer Janofsky, a professor who teaches public history courses has become one of Julianne’s mentors. Dr. Janofsky was the one who told Julianne about the Historical Society of Pennsylvania internship. “She kind of knew what I wanted to do and what my experiences were already with different internships and she was like ‘you should try the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.’”\n\nWhen Julianne applied, she did not think she would get the internship because she though that other students from other colleges in Pennsylvania had a better chance due to them being closer. To Julianne’s surprise, after her interview within an hour she was already signing papers to start interning there. “I wouldn’t have heard about it if it wasn’t for Dr. Janofsky, I am very thankful.”\n\nJulianne is currently working on the Philadelphia Orphan Society collection, where she transcribes lots of documents into Excel sheets, to then use that information for the genealogy research that the Historical Society of Pennsylvania performs. Through this internship she has learned to read other people’s cursive writing much better. “It was really hard at first and now I’m starting to get the hang of it.”\n\nThanks to this internship Julianne said she learned that she really likes archiving and hopes to one day work at one of the presidential library museums.“There are 13 of them in the country, different presidents and just based around them. So, I definitely want to work in museums, preferably ones that relate to presidents.”\n\nJulianne’s advice for future history majors and current history majors is to read all assigned readings. It may seem tedious reading about World War II over and over again, but it is worth it.\n\n“And don’t just study one area of history, try to take it all in because we have a really diverse history staff so take as many classes as you can.”\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nIridian Gonzalez, senior journalism major\n\nFrom ‘Sister of Justice’ to Court Service Supervisor\n\nThe daughter of a welder/steamfitter father and a mother who did a little bit of everything, Kristen Cunningham knew she wanted to continue her education after high school, but wasn’t sure what she wanted to do. She also wanted to make her parents proud and be the first person in her family to go to college. Initially drawn to education and journalism, she shied away from those options when her hearing began to deteriorate as a young adult and she felt her hearing loss may hinder her in those areas.\n\nShe completed her associate degree at Mercer County College, while working full-time as a cook in a restaurant. Her colleague there, Cheryl Buono, a waitress, told her about then-Glassboro State College and said, “You’ve got to come to this awesome school with me.” Kristen checked out a few options, including other state schools and an art school, but ultimately decided, “If Cheryl’s there, sure. That will make the transition to campus life much easier. I didn’t want to risk not getting a degree.”\n\nOnce at Rowan, something just clicked with Kristen with criminology. “It blew my mind. I could still do the writing and the research that I enjoyed, but also focus on justice.” The law and justice studies alumna graduated in 1998, saying that the advice of her professors “saved” her. “I had one professor, Salerno, who asked me, ‘What do you want to do?’ We talked about it for a bit and he said, ‘I can see with your personality you’d be better at this, you’d be better at that.’ And he was right. He definitely geared me toward something that was a fit for me. He cared.”\n\nAnother professor taught her the importance of observation. “People never look up and that’s what criminals take advantage of. There’s a lot happening outside of your eyesight. To this day, when I’m walking down the street I always have eyes up. Those little nuggets, those were real-life experiences in that department. It was amazing and I loved it. We had people with years of experience in the field, being investigators, police officers and they were teaching these classes.”\n\nKristen also considers her involvement in Greek life to be paramount to her success at Rowan. “You went to classes and learned, but after class it was like family. Greek life made me feel like a part of the school.” Kristen affectionately earned the nickname “Sister of Justice” (something she is still sometimes called to this day) and led her sorority, Alpha Delta Epsilon, as president.\n\nToday, Kristen is a 20-year employee of the judiciary within Mercer County. She started as an investigator, moving up to a probation officer after a year. She was voted Probation Worker of the Year in 2003. Two years later she was promoted to supervisor, a position she still holds today. As a court service supervisor in Probation/Child Support, she manages a team of six probation officers. “You get a lot of complaints. But as a civil servant you take the good with the bad. It’s rewarding because once in awhile I’ll get a letter that says that their lives changed for the better. That’s better than a bonus, when you hear that someone’s life has been bettered by an action you did – you go to bed that night feeling pretty good about yourself.”\n\nAs for her friend and waitress Cheryl? Successful in her own right as a leader in the marketing industry, she and Kristen are still dear friends 20+ years later.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nHumanities & Social Sciences\n\nFaculty PROFile: World Language Department’s Kipp Matalucci\n\nMeet Kipp Matalucci, German adjunct instructor within the College of Humanities & Social Sciences.\n\nWhat is your area of expertise? I think the biggest strength I bring to the classroom is a knowledge of culture and civilization, particularly of Germany and Austria. I’ve acquired this not only through formal study but also through a lifetime of experience in those countries.\n\nThe fundamental underlying human value language teachers impart is respect for other people’s differences. We impart it not by preaching but by introducing students to the rich cultural achievements of the peoples whose language we teach.\n\nShare an “aha!” moment that you’ve had within your discipline that made you feel passionate about your field. There are so many “aha” moments in my many years of study that it is hard to single out just one. I must go back to high school, the summer of 1967, when I traveled to Germany and Austria for the first time with my teacher, Frau Cote, and several classmates. It was the overwhelming, life-changing experience one might imagine for a 16-year-old who had never left the country before. We spent three weeks in Germany and three weeks in Austria. I wasn’t back home much longer than a few days before I started thinking of ways I could return! A new world was opened for me. I returned from that trip knowing that I would do something with language and travel. It turned out to be teaching.\n\nShare with us one aspect of student engagement that you enjoy most, and why? I enjoy interacting with students on so many levels. The youthful enthusiasm and intellectual curiosity they bring to classroom inspire me and help me to stay young at heart. Their questions keep me on my toes! They often have a keen interest in aspects of contemporary German culture that I know little about, the current music scene, for example. I think of Anna in “The King and I.”\n\n“It’s a very ancient saying,\n\nBut a true and honest thought,\n\nThat if you become a teacher,\n\nBy your pupils you’ll be taught.”\n\nWhat is one thing you wish people knew about your academic discipline or your research focus? Again, I return to culture in terms of my academic discipline. When many think of Germany, it is Bavaria that comes to mind, the Octoberfest and brass bands, the Alps, and Mad King Ludwig’s fairytale castles. This is an irritant for my German friends. Although Bavaria is Germany’s biggest state, there are 15 other states in the country with diverse cultures.\n\nHow long have you taught at Rowan? What has inspired you to continue teaching? I am in my 17th year of teaching at Rowan. I love standing in front of a classroom of young people. Every class is different. Each offers its own rewards and challenges. One’s day is never the same. From my pupils I am taught.\n\nLike what you see?

I am primarily a philosopher of science, and my principal work to date is concerned with epistemological issues in science. Philosophers traffic in questions, and here are the ones I am most concerned with: how do theory and observation relate? How are new scientific theories discovered? How do we distinguish good science from phony science?\n\nMy most significant publication is N.R Hanson: Observation, Discovery, and Scientific Change (2010), which is a study of the thought of N.R. Hanson, an important philosopher, who was both a renaissance man and a wild man, and who passed away in his early forties. I also teach Epistemology, Symbolic Logic, Philosophy of Physics and Nietzsche. My first publication was a translation of an article by the German Expressionist poet, Gottfried Benn, on Nietzsche.\n\nOne of my favorite courses I teach at Rowan is American Philosophy. For some reason, Americans are either unaware or ashamed of their philosophers. Folks like Thomas Paine, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, C.S. Peirce, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, William James, Alain Locke and John Dewey are deep and interesting thinkers who can be read both for serious study and pleasure. I echo Tolstoy’s complaint that Americans celebrate politicians and industrialists to the exclusion of their fine writers and scholars.\n\nShare an “aha!” moment that you’ve had within your discipline that made you feel passionate about your field. My moment really came before I had ever studied philosophy in any serious capacity. I have always loved math and science, and it came as a surprise to me when I worked as an electrical engineer that those marvelously elegant theories and methods I had learned only applied to the real world in the most partial and approximate ways.\n\nI think that a philosophical analysis of background assumptions and expectations is part of any sophisticated process of inquiry, whether it be in science, ethics, politics or personal decision making. I find the feeling of doubt and disillusion stimulating since this is often the first step on the way from error to the truth.\n\nDescribe for us an experience you’ve had with a student that made you feel excited about educating the next generation in your field. Most of us drift through the world as sleepers or sleep walkers. We are told what to believe, what is valuable, what we should do with ourselves. I am always inspired when students are roused from these “dogmatic slumbers” and realize they have voices; they have their own lives and their own destinies that they must make real. I think of philosophy as the most potent source of empowerment. Emerson said in “The American Scholar” that each generation has to think through the problems of life for itself and write its own books. I love it when I see that process at work.\n\nWhat’s your favorite thing about being on campus on a typical Tuesday? I greatly enjoy walking to class with my head abuzz with all of the interesting ideas and arguments of the day’s lesson. How things will be framed, how students will respond and where the discussion will lead is always an adventure. There’s a reason that so many people forsake lives of mindless comfort for philosophy. When one is in the grips of a legitimate philosophical problem, one is most truly and vigorously alive. When I was in college, I had many 3 a.m. discussions of the big questions. I am lucky enough to have these kinds of discussions every day when I teach.\n\nWhat is one thing you wish people knew about your academic discipline or your research focus? There’s an odd perceived belief that getting a philosophy degree is an invitation to the life of a useless ne’er-do-well. I could cite data that show the opposite to be true, that philosophy majors score the highest, on average, on post-graduate exams and that their lifetime incomes are among the highest of any major.\n\nHowever, I think that is not the right approach, since philosophy is rarely chosen for these ulterior reasons — students choose it for intrinsic reasons: the study of philosophy enriches one’s life and can make even the most mundane experiences redeemable via philosophical reflection. Many students have told me that they didn’t really comprehend what other disciplines were for until they had studied philosophy. After that, they knew what kinds of questions to ask and where the other disciplines were coming from. The university evolved out of philosophical schools, so it is not a mystery that philosophy still provides the conceptual glue to bind everything together.\n\nFinally, and I hate to wax apocalyptic, but I believe that humanity only has about a century left to walk the earth if it continues on its current path. How are we going to deal with the destruction of the environment, intolerance, terrorism, increased surveillance, the erosion of human rights, ceaseless war, incompetent and violent political leadership? I agree with Dewey that technology cannot save us since our capacity to develop new things always outstrips our capacity to understand and deal with their social consequences. I honestly don’t think philosophy will save us from final destruction. However, just as I think sober reflection on one’s own personal mortality is necessary, if fundamentally unpleasant and terrifying, so too is sober reflection on the mortality of our planet and species. All we can hope for is that the life of humanity be as good and meaningful as possible, and philosophy contributes essentially to that goal.\n\nLike what you see, come visit us!\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory and photography by:\n\nChad Wittmann, senior journalism major\n\nFirst Disaster Preparedness & Emergency Management Graduate Reflects on His Rowan Experience\n\nJeff Dever, a 2017 alum from Moorestown, NJ (Burlington County), has many reasons to be #RowanPROUD.
