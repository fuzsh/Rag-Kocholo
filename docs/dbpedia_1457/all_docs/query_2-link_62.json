        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump in an interview on Tuesday claimed Vice President Kamala Harris, who is married to a Jewish man, “doesn’t like Jewish people” and seemed to agree with a radio host who called second gentleman Doug Emhoff “a crappy Jew.”\n\nTrump, in an interview on WABC radio on Tuesday, claimed Harris looked uncomfortable while meeting last week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n“You can see the disdain,” he said, adding, “No. 1, she doesn’t like Israel. No. 2, she doesn’t like Jewish people. You know it, I know it and everybody knows it and nobody wants to say it.”\n\nREAD MORE: A Harris win would make Doug Emhoff the country’s first first gentleman\n\nTrump has tried to capitalize on divisions in the Democratic Party over the Israel-Hamas war and sought to paint his political opponents as antisemitic while overlooking some of his own past comments and behavior, such as dining at his Florida club with a Holocaust-denying white nationalist. With Harris replacing President Joe Biden as the likely Democratic presidential nominee, Trump has escalated his attacks on her.\n\n“America is better than the fear, hate, and despicable insults of Donald Trump,” said James Singer, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign. “Vice President Harris believes Americans want a president who unites our country instead of divides it, uses the power of the presidency to help families instead of hurt them, and has a vision for our future, instead of taking us backwards.”\n\nIn the interview, the Republican former president repeated comments he has made before lashing out at Jewish voters who back Democrats, saying anyone who does “should have their head examined” and “if you’re Jewish, if you vote for a Democrat, you’re a fool, an absolute fool. They have let Jewish people down since Obama at a level that nobody could believe.”\n\nAs Trump continued on, he again said of Harris, “She dislikes Jewish people and Israel even more than Biden did.”\n\nThe interview host, Sid Rosenberg, then mentioned Harris’ husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and said, “He’s Jewish like Bernie Sanders is Jewish. Are you kidding me?”\n\n“Yeah,” Trump said.\n\n“He’s a crappy Jew,” Rosenberg said, continuing.\n\n“Yeah,” Trump said again.\n\nRosenberg went on, saying of Emhoff, “He’s a horrible Jew.”\n\nWATCH: Harris holds campaign event in Georgia with rapper Megan Thee Stallion\n\nThey then moved on to criticizing Harris on other issues.\n\nTrump made a similar claim about Harris disliking Jewish people on Friday while speaking to a Christian group at a Turning Point USA gathering in Florida. He has also ignited blowback in the past for making similar remarks about Jewish people, like when he said in March that Jews who vote for Democrats “hate Israel” and hate “their religion.”\n\nEmhoff, the first Jewish person to serve as the spouse of a nationally elected U.S. leader, has been one of the most visible members of the Biden administration speaking about combating antisemitism. He hung mezuzahs on the doorposts of the vice president’s residence and led Passover celebrations at the White House.\n\nEmhoff’s office declined to comment Tuesday.\n\nREAD MORE: Kamala Harris and faith: a Baptist with a Jewish spouse and ties to the Black Church and Gandhi\n\nTrump’s campaign has also criticized Emhoff’s adult daughter Ella for posting on her social media account a fundraising link for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees. Israel has sought to ban the group and suggests it supports terrorists. European leaders have said that is a baseless accusation.\n\nRosenberg, who is Jewish, is a longtime conservative New York City radio personality who hosts “Sid and Friends in the Morning,” on 77 WABC. Guests on his show have included Trump-world figures like Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump Jr.\n\nRosenberg came to prominence as a sidekick and sports anchor on Don Imus’ long-running morning radio show. He drew backlash in 2001 for making racist comments calling tennis star Venus Williams an “animal” and saying that she and her sister Serena should pose for National Geographic magazine. He was fired from Imus’ show over those remarks but re-appeared on the show later and was involved in the incident that got Imus fired in 2007, in which Imus made a racist and misogynist remark about the mostly black Rutgers University women’s basketball team.\n\nAP White House Correspondent Zeke Miller in Washington and AP writer Michael R. Sisak in New York contributed to this report."
