        "text": "Notes\n\nList of Organizations Cited in the Text, with Abbreviations\n\nAgudath Israel. Hebrew for “Union of Israel,” it is the World Organization of Orthodox Jews. It was founded in 1912 and numbered perhaps 500,000 members, chiefly from Chisidic elements in many countries by World War II.\n\nAmerican Council for Judaism. Splinter organization of assimilationist American Jews established in opposition to Zionist Biltmore Program in 1943. Insisting that Judaism is merely a religion and not a nationality, the council has no more than 25,000 adherents today.\n\nAmerican Friends Service Committee. Long-standing humanitarian organization of American Quakers based in Philadelphia. It was chaired by Clarence Pickett during the Holocaust period.\n\nAmerican Jewish Committee. Founded in 1906 in response to Russian pogroms, its leaders included Louis Marshall, Oscar Straus, Jacob Schiff, Julius Rosenwald, and Mayer Sulzberger. Prestigious, with important political connections in both major parties, it numbers 43,000 members.\n\nAmerican Jewish Conference. Umbrella organization championed by Stephen Wise and including members of the American Jewish Committee, American Jewish Congress, Synagogue Council of America, B’nai B’rith, and the Jewish Labor Committee. From 1943 through 1949 it attempted to rescue Jews from Europe and aid Jewish migration to Palestine.\n\nAmerican Jewish Congress. Organized in 1915 in response to pogroms on Eastern Front during World War I, it continued to function at Versailles. It was reorganized in 1922 under Stephen Wise as a more activist body than the conservative American Jewish Committee. It was affiliated with the World Jewish Congress in 1936, and its strength can be measured by the 698,993 ballots cast in the June 1938, Congress election.\n\nB’nai B’rith. The oldest (founded 1843) and largest (130,000) of American Jewish organizations, it has operated hospitals, orphanages, libraries, vocational training programs, and Hillel facilities across the nation. It founded the Anti-Defamation League, which serves as America’s principal watchdog against anti-Semitism, in 1913.\n\nCommittee for an Army of Stateless and Palestinian Jews. Activist front organized by Irgun Zvai Leumi in the United States after 1939, nominally headed by Colorado Senator Edwin Johnson but actually directed by Peter Bergson (Kook) and Ben Hecht. It was opposed by Rabbi Wise as a troublemaker.\n\nEmergency Committee to Save the Children of Europe. Founded at FDR’s urging in the spring of 1940, its purpose was to use $5,000,000 to underwrite expenses for admission of 70,000 children (Jewish and non-Jewish) to the U.S. Headed by Frank Kingdom and supported by Eleanor Roosevelt, Marshall Field III, Raymond Clapper, and Joseph Alsop, it never reached its goals.\n\nEmergency Conference to Save the Jewish People of Europe. Distinct from the Commission of Rescue of the American Jewish Conference, this conference, like the Committee for a Jewish Army, was organized by Peter Bergson and included among its leaders Ben Hecht, Max Lerner, Emil Lengyel, Louis Bromfield, Pierre Van Paassen, and Will Rogers.\n\nGeneral Jewish Conference. Abortive proposal of Pittsburgh philanthropist Edgar Kaufmann which sought to unite the American Jewish Committee, American Jewish Congress, B’nai B’rith, and Jewish Labor Committee between 1938 and 1941. It foundered amidst disputes over leadership and funds.\n\nGerman-Jewish Children’s Aid Committee. Proposed by Max Kohler to Labor Secretary Frances Perkins in 1934, it succeeded in relocating several hundred such children through the Department of Naturalization and Immigration before 1939. It was created primarily by Jewish social workers in the U.S.\n\nHIAS. Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society. Established in New York City in 1909, its purpose was to assist immigrants enroute to the U.S. After the war it merged with the United Service for New Americans and the Overseas Migration Services of the Joint Distribution Committee.\n\nHICEM. Established in 1927 as a combination of the services of HIAS, ICA, and Emig-Direct for the purpose of securing emigration permits and refuge for Jewish refugees, it was dissolved after 1945.\n\nHilfsverein der Deutschen Juden. This German Jewish Aid Society, founded in 1901 to aid the persecuted Jews of Eastern Europe, functioned until 1941. In its last ten years it concentrated on the problems of German Jewry and the securing of exit visas for 90,000 persons.\n\nICA. A Jewish colonization association established in 1891 by Baron Maurice de Hirsch. Its purpose was to secure land where Jews could, after centuries of legal barriers, once more become agriculturists. Initially it focused on South America.\n\nIRO. International Refugee Organization which existed from 1947, when it supplanted UNRRA, to 1951.\n\nIGCR. The Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees. This was established at Evian in 1938 and revived from a near-dormant state at Bermuda in 1943. It was allegedly chartered to assist all refugees who were forced to leave Germany and Austria because of political opinions, religious beliefs, or racial origin. It proved hapless, inconsequential, and frustrating for its directors, who included George Rublee and Herbert Emerson.\n\nIrgun. This was the “National Military Organization,” which was a dissident faction headed by Vladimir Jabotinsky in Palestine in 1937. It rejected the concept of self-restraint championed by regular Zionists in Palestine for a much more activist approach to self-determination. It had no more than 3,000 to 5,000 members by 1946, but its strength lay with the many nonmember Jews who sympathized with its programs.\n\nJewish Agency. This was created in 1919 in response to Article IV of the British Mandate over Palestine, which called for “an appropriate Jewish agency” to advise and cooperate with the British administration in reviving a Jewish National Home in Palestine. After 1929 the World Zionist Organization was recognized as the Jewish Agency. It continues to function in Israel, sponsoring youth aliyah and underwriting the United Jewish Appeal.\n\nJewish Labor Committee. Established in 1934, it claims to represent 756 labor groups and 500,000 workers. It was originally headed by Baruch Vladeck, but since 1938, Adolph Held has served as chairman.\n\nJoint Distribution Committee or Joint. Autonomous creation of the American Jewish Committee and several Orthodox groups, the Joint was founded in 1914 for the purpose of giving aid to Jews around the world. By 1967 its relief and rescue operations had amounted to more than $872,000,000.\n\nJNF. Jewish National Fund or “Keren Kayemet le-Yisrael.” A perpetual fund for the Jewish state of Israel founded by the World Zionist Organization to redeem land for Jewish colonization in Galilee, Samaria, and the Negev. By 1948 the JNF had purchased 235,523 acres of land in Palestine at bloated prices.\n\nMERRA. Middle East Relief and Refugee Administration. Between July 1942 and April 1944, when it merged with UNRRA, this British operation permitted 45,000 non-Jewish Yugoslavs, Greeks, and Poles to gain refuge in the Egyptian Delta, Sinai, and Cyprus.\n\nNansen Office. This was known as the Nansen Organization for Help to Refugees when it was chartered by the League of Nations in 1921. From 1930 to December 1938 it was called after its chairman, a well-known Norwegian explorer. It was empowered to issue “international passports” to the stateless which were supposed to be good in fifty-two nations.\n\nNCC. National Coordinating Committee. Headed by Joseph P. Chamberlain, it was founded in October 1934 to aid refugees of all faiths coming to the U.S. from Germany. Among its adherents were the American Committee for Christian-German Refugees, American Friends Service Committee, American Jewish Committee, American Jewish Congress, B’nai B’rith, Committee for Catholic Refugees from Germany, Council of Jewish Federation and Welfare Funds, Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Physicians, Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars, Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America, German-Jewish Children’s Aid, HIAS, HICEM, Intercollegiate Council for Refugee Students, International Migration Service, International Student Service, Jewish Agricultural Society of America, Joint Distribution Committee, Musicians’ Emergency Fund, National Board of the YWCA, National Council of Jewish Women, and Zionist Organization of America.\n\nNRS. This was organized in 1939 to facilitate the adjustment of refugees from Nazism in the U.S. It assisted more than 26,000 persons before it became the United Service for New Americans in 1946 and eventually merged with HIAS in 1954.\n\nNZO. New Zionist Organization known as “Ha-Tzohar.” Founded in 1925 by Vladimir Jabotinsky, it existed as a separate Zionist international from 1935 to 1946 when it again rejoined the WZO. It was activist, revisionist, and eventually became the gestation of Herut or the Freedom party in Israel today.\n\nNSC. Special Non-Sectarian Committee for German Refugee Children, an adjunct of the NCC. Headed by Clarence Pickett, its purpose was to lobby for passage of the Wagner Bill, which would have admitted 20,000 German-Jewish refugee children to the U.S. in 1938.\n\nOffice of High Commissioner for Refugees from Germany. This office complemented the work of the Nansen Office after its creation in 1933. Until the Evian conference this hapless office was charged with the principal task of assisting refugees from Nazism. Ultimately in the summer of 1939, Herbert Emerson, League commissioner since September 1938, took on responsibility for IGCR functions as well.\n\nOFFRO. Office of Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation Operations. Founded by FDR in November 1942, it was to develop relief policies in territories under U.S. control. In September 1943, OFFRO, which was headed by Herbert Lehman, became the Foreign Economic Administration. Two months later it became UNRRA.\n\nORT. Society for Propagation of Artisanal and Agricultural Work among Jews. Founded in Russia in 1880 by Baron Horace de Gunzburg, ORT has had its central offices in Geneva since 1943 and continues to promote retraining in agriculture and workshops in twenty-three countries.\n\nOSE. Russian “Oshtchestvo Zdravookhranyenie Evreyev” for Jewish Health Society. Founded at St. Petersburg in 1912, it grew into an international federation by 1923.\n\nPresident’s Advisory Committee on Political Refugees. Called into being after the Anschluss in March 1938, it was chaired by former League Commissioner for Refugees James McDonald. Others who assisted the State Department in matters pertaining to refugees included Samuel McCrea Cavert of the Federal Council of Churches in America, Paul Baerwald of the American Jewish Committee, Bernard Baruch, Hamilton Fish Armstrong, Joseph Chamberlain, the most Reverend Joseph F. Rummel, Basil Harris, James Spears, and Louis Kennedy. It was reorganized in 1940 with the title of National Coordinating Committee for Aid to Refugees.\n\nREC. Refugee Economic Corporation organized in 1939 by Felix Warburg and other latecomers to appreciate the threat of Hitler. It labored to seek admission of Jews to Australia and Argentina during the war. All twenty of its directors were Jews.\n\nSynagogue Council of America. This was established in 1926 for the purpose of serving as the umbrella religious organ of orthodox, conservative, and reform Jews in the U.S.\n\nUNRRA. Chartered in November 1943 to deal with twenty-one million “displaced persons in liberated areas,” UNRRA existed until 1947 under the frustrated leadership of Lehman and Fiorello La Guardia. Jews were especially victimized by UNRRA’s preference shown to nationals of states which were members of the U.N. or “enemy nationals” who might face persecution upon return to their homes. Jews fell into neither classification.\n\nWRB. This group created by executive order and at the urging of Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau in January 1944, when it was evident that UNRRA could not or would not assist Jews outside the liberated areas. Composed of the secretaries of Treasury, War, and State, its Director was John Pehle, who did not hesitate to spend $20 million wherever possible to rescue Jews and other victims of Nazism.\n\nWorld Jewish Congress. This was organized in 1936 among Jewish bodies in sixty-five countries to replace outmoded Comité des Delegations Juives. Stephen Wise served as president until his death in 1949, when he was succeeded by Nahum Goldmann.\n\nWZO. World Zionist Organization, chartered by Theodor Herzl and representatives from two dozen states at Basle in 1897. Since then the WZO has functioned through its adjuncts in individual countries and as the Jewish Agency in Israel.\n\nYIVO. Yiddish Institute for Scientific Research established in Vilna in 1925 but transferred to New York City with the outbreak of World War II. It operates branches in thirty countries.\n\nZOA. Zionist Organization of America, which was formally chartered in 1917 after a diffused start among “Lovers of Zion” in the U.S. since the 1880s. Among its chairmen have been Louis Brandeis, Stephen Wise and Abba Hillel Silver. During the war the ZOA’s membership peaked at about 50,000. In recent years it has become the haven of the elderly.\n\nIntroduction\n\n1. Chomski, “Children in Exile,” Contemporary Jewish Record, 4 (Oct. 1941): 522–28.\n\n2.

There have been several general surveys of American immigration policies published in recent years, including William S. Bernard, American Immigration Policy (New York: Harper and Bros., 1950); Marion T. Bennett, American Immigration Policies: A History (Washington: Public Affairs Press, 1967); John Higham, Strangers in the Land: Patterns of American Nativism, 1860–1925 (New York: Atheneum, 1966); and Robert A. Divine, American Immigration Policy, 1924–1952 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1957). The only one which gives more than passing attention to the Jewish refugee question under Hitler is Divine’s work, and there the discussion covers a mere twenty pages.\n\n8. Studies of the individual refugee include Donald P. Kent, The Refugee Intellectual: The Americanization of Immigrants, 1933–1941 (New York: Columbia University Press, 1953); Harold Fields, The Refugee in the United States (New York: Oxford University Press, 1938); Laura Fermi, Illustrious Immigrants: The Intellectual Migration from Europe, 1930–1941 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1968); Sophia Robinson, Refugees at Work (New York: Columbia University Press, 1942); and Maurice Davie and Samuel Koenig, Refugees in America (New York: Harper and Bros., 1947). The best studies of Jewish refugee problems are Oscar and Mary Handlin, A Century of Jewish Immigration to the United States (New York: American Jewish Committee, 1949); Allen Lesser, Jewish Immigration 1654–1880, 1881–1924 (New York: Bureau for Intercultural Education, 1939); and Arieh Tartakower and Kurt Grossmann, The Jewish Refugee (New York: Institute of Jewish Affairs of the World Jewish Congress and the American Jewish Congress, 1944).\n\n9. “America’s Moment of Failure,” Midstream, 14 (May 1968): 66–72. Adler also criticized Morse’s improper techniques of citation, his failure to explore congressional reports, his absolute reliance on the editorial columns of the New York Times as demonstrative of the will of the American people during this period, and his failure to explore additional library holdings. Letter from Adler to Saul S. Friedman, Feb. 15, 1967.\n\n10. Personal interview with Szajkowski, Dec. 30, 1968.\n\n11. Henry Feingold, rev. of While Six Million Died: A Chronicle of American Apathy by Arthur D. Morse, American Jewish Historical Quarterly, 58 (Sept. 1968): 150–55. Feingold later published his own comprehensive study, The Politics of Rescue: The Roosevelt Administration and the Holocaust (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1970). Like Morse’s work, Fein-gold’s book fails to analyze the anomie of the Jewish community and leadership during the crisis. Feingold also makes omissions relative to congressional, “patriotic,” and labor pressures on Roosevelt before 1939. He also does not consult Harold Willis Dodds, chief delegate to the Bermuda conference, who emerges in Feingold’s book as a one dimensional functionary, and he does not probe the feasibility of North Africa as a haven for refugees beyond the statements of minor army intelligence officials. Even less satisfactory because of its circumscribed nature is David S. Wyman’s Paper Walls: America and the Refugee Crisis, 1938–1941 (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1968).\n\nChapter 1\n\n1. George Washington established this precedent when he said in New York on Dec. 2, 1783: “The bosom of America is open to receive not only the Opulent and respectable Stranger, but the oppressed and persecuted of all Nations and Religions; whom we shall wellcome (sic) to a participation of our rights and previleges (sic), if by decency and propriety of conduct they appear to merit the enjoyment.” The Writings of George Washington: from the Original Manuscript Sources, 1745–1799, ed. John C. Fitzpatrick (Washington, 1938), pp. 27, 254. For virtually identical statements from Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, James Polk, Zachary Taylor, Franklin Pierce, and U. S. Grant, see Robert Ernst, “Asylum of the Oppressed,” South Atlantic Quarterly, 40 (Jan. 1941): 1–10. See also National Party Platforms, 1840–1956, comp. Kirk H. Porter and Donald Bruce Johnson (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1956).\n\n2. Quoted in Earl G. Harrison, “Immigration Policy of the United States,” Foreign Policy Reports, 23 (Apr. 1947): 14.\n\n3. U.S., Statutes at Law, 22, 216 (Aug. 3, 1882).\n\n4. In the winter of 1896–1897, Lodge made the error calling for such a test in the language of the immigrant’s native or resident country. Because this would have prejudiced the entrance possibilities of Russian Jews, whose native language was Yiddish, and because American sympathies at the time were still in favor of succoring the victims of Tsarist persecution, the measure failed. For the heated debate on this subject, see U.S., Congress, House, Congressional Record, 54th Cong., 2d Sess., 1897, 29, pt. 2:1219–22.\n\n5. A lonely, embittered person, Grant contended in The Passing of the Great Race (New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1916) that the Civil War had destroyed the best “unalloyed” stock of Americans and that, since 1865, their place in the population had been taken by diseased and mentally deficient aliens and Negroes. The work, which predicted doom to Western civilization at the hands of atavist races, went through four editions, including one edited during wartime in which Grant hastily attempted a distinction between Alpine Teutons, who were corrupt barbarians, and pure Nordics, the backbone of Western civilization. Stoddard railed against what he termed the “underman” in The Rising Tide of Color (New York: Scribner’s, 1920); The Revolt Against Civilization (New York: Scribner’s, 1922); and Racial Realities in Europe (New York: Scribner’s, 1924). As late as 1940, he was warning that civilization was being suffocated by masses of inferior, colored, and Asiatic peoples, among whom he included the Jews. For works by the other eugenicists, see Charles Conant Josey, Race and National Solidarity (New York: Scribner’s, 1923); Harry Laughlin, Eugenical Sterilization in the United States (Chicago: Municipal Court Reference Library, 1922); Historical, Legal and Statistical Review of Eugenic Sterilization in the United States (Chicago: Municipal Court Reference Library, 1922); Report of the First Twenty-Seven Months Work of the Eugenics Record Office (Washington: Eugenics Record Office, 1913); and William Z. Ripley, Races of Europe: A Sociological Study (New York: Appleton, 1899). The damage done by Hendrick and Jordan stemmed not so much from their monographs (generally innocuous pieces dealing with important American figures like Walter Hines Page) as it did from the prestige they lent to the entire restrictionist movement in speeches or testimony before congressional hearings.\n\n6.

The law continued nonquota exemptions for Western Hemisphere Caucasians. At the same time, however, it excluded all Orientals, thereby abrogating the Gentlemen’s Agreements of 1907–1908 and touching the sensitivities of the Japanese, who proclaimed a day of national mourning when the law went into effect.\n\n16.

Only 41 percent of the small Polish quota, 40 percent of the Czech quota, and 37.7 percent of the German quota were ever used in this period. These statistics can only be accounted for by difficulties faced by refugees in leaving Europe and in breaking through the consular barriers to the United States. See Bernard, American Immigration Policy, p. 304.

Nazi calculations of what constituted a “private fortune” were interesting. If a man, aged seventy-five, received a monthly pension of 60 DM, his annual income (720 DM) was multiplied by a special numerical unit which varied with age and life expectancy tables (in this case the multiple was seven). The result was that such a person was reckoned to possess a “private fortune” of 5,040 DM and hence owed the state 40 DM. “Nazi Property Registration Law, Apr. 26, 1938,” Contemporary Jewish Record, 1 (Sept. 1938): 45.\n\n32.

Such was the estimate of Louis Bean, statistical analyst of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in a special report on the influence of nationality groups upon election returns done for Roosevelt in 1941. See Louis L. Gerson, The Hyphenate in Recent American Politics and Diplomacy (Lawrence: University of Kansas Press, 1964), pp. 120–21.\n\n44. Long before Samuel Lubell made his analysis of the constituency of American isolationists in the pre-World War II period (see Lubell’s Future of American Politics [New York: Harper and Row, Colophon Edition, 1965] pp. 132–51), Bean had attributed the growth of this sentiment to propaganda among German-Americans and Russian-Americans in the Midwest. The result was a much more intensified effort on the part of the Nationalities Division of the Democratic party to placate these groups even between election campaigns. Gerson, pp. 30–32.\n\n45. Once a highly successful Hollywood movie script writer, Pelley underwent an eerie transformation in 1928. At that time, he “died and went to heaven.” Reborn, he was guided by an unseen oracle, which gave him instructions. The most important was to found the Silver Shirts on Jan. 31, 1933, the day after Hitler took power in Germany. Pelley promised salvation of the United States by 1962, when he again would be transfigured. Harold Lavine, Fifth Column in America (New York: Doubleday, Doran and Co., 1940), pp. 171–80.\n\n46.

Alfred M. and Elizabeth B. Lee (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1939); and Charles Tull, Father Coughlin and the New Deal (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 1965).\n\n49. Coughlin continued to denounce Jews, aliens, and reds and to praise Nazi Germany in the pages of Social Justice until Pearl Harbor, when his paper ceased publication and he went into semi-retirement. On Feb. 23, 1959, his secretary, H. Thomas, responding to an inquiry from this author regarding Coughlin’s views of Jews, Roosevelt, and the depression era, wrote the following cryptic reply: “At this time, Father Coughlin finds it not proper to inscribe any remarks relative to his activities or to his career. This seems a very curt answer to a serious young man. However, I know that he understands that there are hidden activities in personnel who oftentimes interfere with the course and determination of events.”\n\n50. Gary T.

There were infrequent “marriages” between organizations. In Aug. 1939, 7,000 persons (many of them Bundists) crowded Innisfail Park in the Bronx to cheer Joe McWilliams. The Bund and Christian Mobilizers subsequently pledged themselves to a united front in a closed session at Ebling’s Casion (Carlson, pp. 77–80). Edward James Smythe of the Ku Klux Klan also promised that organization’s cooperation with the Bund at Camp Nordland, N.J., in Aug. 1940 (Myers, p. 339). For evidence of connections between the Bund and Silver Shirts, see August Raymond Ogden, The Dies Committee: A Study of the Special House Committee for the Investigation of Un-American Activities, 1938–1944 (Washington: Catholic University Press, 1945). Efforts of George Deatherage to consolidate seventy-two fascist groups ended in failure at Los Angeles in Aug. 1938 (Myers, p. 362).\n\n55.

McCormick presents a particularly fascinating image. A vigilant anti-communist, anti-alien (they meant the same for McCormick), he filled the columns of his journal with spurious assaults on Bolshevism, claiming, among other things, that the comintern was actively seeking Roosevelt’s reelection in 1936 and that the proposed polar air route from the U.S.S.R. to the U.S. was a communist plot. He also supplied Mrs. Dilling with a front-cover endorsement for The Red Network (Chicago: publ. by the author, 1935 and 1936). He was actively associated with the Sentinels and supplied Harry Jung, whom he considered an authority on communism, with offices in the Tribune Towers Building. See Carlson, pp. 196–97, 396; Seldes, You Can’t Do That, pp. 148–58; Roy, pp. 40–42; and George Seldes, Lords of the Press (New York: Julian Messner, 1939), pp. 54–57.\n\n59. Seldes, You Can’t Do That, pp. 138–43.\n\n60. Blasted by Sen. Lewis Schwellenbach (D.-Wash.) as a bunch of “leeches, rascals, crooks and bloodsucking lawyers,” the Liberty League was also linked to the Black Legion, according to Gov. Earle of Pennsylvania, and charged by Robert Harris of Common Sense with a desire to maintain the liberty of starvation, unemployment, and death. Seldes, You Can’t Do That, pp. 102–107. For a less empassioned treatment of the league, see Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., The Coming of the New Deal, The Age of Roosevelt (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1958), 2:486–88.\n\n61. Included in this collective noun were the major chains across the country, including Scripps-Howard, the Chandler and Hearst newspapers on the West Coast, and the New York Herald Tribune, which editorialized on May 22, 1932: “The hour has struck for a fascist party to be born in the United States.” Holland, however, intended to direct his remark against McCormick and the Chicago Tribune and the colonel’s relatives, Joseph Medill Patterson of the New York Daily News and Eleanor “Sissy” Patterson of the Washington Times-Herald, journals accounting for 5 percent of the country’s daily readership (Seldes, Lords of the Press, pp. 20–86). Of these papers, which published exposés of “Jewish power” in Washington, which turned over their columns to defenses of Pelley when he was charged with sedition, and which editorialized as late as Aug. 30, 1942 (Daily News) that “Hitler was not wholly to blame” for the war and that “a big bloodletting might help matters,” William L. Shirer commented, “Hardly a day goes by that they are not cited by Goebbels to prove one of his points” (Quoted in Carlson, p. 399).\n\n62. On the resurgence of the right in this period, see Schlesinger, pp. 423–511, in which the author attributes this phenomenon to an abiding fear among conservatives that communism genuinely menaced the American form of government.\n\n63. Leading Wall Street bankers were implicated in several plots to “save the republic” in the 1930s. The first, exposed by the McCormack Committee in 1935, involved the cooperation of ex-Marine Gen. Smedley Butler, who testified he had been approached with money ($3,000,000) and manpower (500,000 men) to lead a Mussolini-type march on Washington in Aug. 1934 (Seldes, You Can’t Do That, pp. 173–84). A less cooperative witness, ex-Maj. Gen. George Van Horn Moseley, told the Dies Committee in May 1939 that he was to prevent the takeover by 150,000 Spanish Republican mercenaries in the employ of Jewish Bolsheviks by directing a spontaneous uprising in the summer of 1939. Walter Goodman, The Committee: The Extraordinary Career of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 1968), pp. 60–61. In the same year other leading bankers were implicated in an unsuccessful coup to be directed by German Consul Manfred von Killinger in San Francisco (Carlson, pp. 137–39).\n\n64. The American Legion’s 1937 convention in New York City endorsed vigilantism (“but not in uniforms”) and opposed any attempt to alter existing immigration laws. A year later in Los Angeles, National Commander Stephen Chadwick and the executive committee forced the passage of a resolution calling for a ten-year suspension of immigration. About the same time the legion was linked with the Black Legion, the northern group which specialized in flogging, arson, and murder. See Carlson, pp. 285–86; Seldes, You Can’t Do That, pp. 114–25; and Leuchtenberg, pp. 276–77.\n\n65. Trevor’s connections with Walter S. Steele, William Pelley, and John Snow were well documented, and he would later be cited in connection with the wartime sedition trial of American Nazis. Still, he was considered an authority on immigration problems after the publication of An Analysis of the Immigration Act of 1924 (New York: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 1924).\n\n66. Olin West, secretary of the AMA, and Medical Economics Magazine attacked government policy in permitting a “flood” of inferior alien doctors into this country before the war. For a refutation of their charges that aliens were practicing cutrate medicine, see Lucille Milner and David Dempsey, “The Alien Myth,” Harper’s, 181 (Sept. 1940): 376.

Carlson gives a complete record of the connections of congressmen and Nazi agents.\n\n73. Efforts were made to link Dies, no friend of foreigners, with fascism through forged letters from Pelley in 1940. Nothing more substantial could be uncovered. Although he was a friend of Winrod and a recipient of neo-Nazi praise for his Red hunts, Dies did assist the government in uncovering underground fascist activities in 1940–1941. See U.S., Congress, House, A Preliminary Digest and Report on Un-American Activities of Various Nazi Organizations and Individuals in the United States, Including Diplomatic and Consular Agents of the German Government, 1940.\n\n74. Only the Smith Act was ever voted into law. Effective June 28, 1940, this bill required the fingerprinting of aliens over age fourteen and detailed penalties for aliens who engaged in subversive activities. Approximately 4,000,000 aliens registered in the first year. See Kansas, pp. 141–43, 147–48.\n\n75. “Feather in Hat,” Time Magazine, 33 (Feb. 13, 1939): 16.\n\n76. Reynolds opposed the administration on only 14 percent of the roll call votes to 1939, a record in direct contrast with that compiled by his fellow North Carolinian, Josiah Bailey. In fact, thirty-one Democratic senators opposed the administration more often than Reynolds, who was not an intimate of the leading conservative insurgents like Glass, Tydings, or George.

In the same discussion Reynolds took a Washington Herald report of the passage of a handful of illegal immigrants across the Canadian border into the U.S. and transmuted it into a gigantic smuggling operation involving “thousands” of persons. Two months later, quoting from Coughlin’s Social Justice, he set the figure of illegals at 25,000. U.S., Congress, Senate, Congressional Record, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 1939, 84, pt. 4:3627, 3629.\n\n81. Again, Reynolds apparently took a New York Times report of Apr. 9, 1939, that stated that 10,975 men on WPA projects in the city had been dismissed during the previous week and inflated it to a figure of 30,000 men being laid off weekly. Congressional Record, 84, pt. 4:4546. His remarks on sharecroppers are from pt. 2:1011. Lurid examples came readily to Reynolds, who bewailed the abnormally high arrest rate among Americans under twenty-one. He was especially perturbed by the number of young white and Negro girls who stood on the street corners of major Eastern cities and offered themselves as prostitutes for fifteen or twenty cents. Reynolds also told of an eighteen-year-old girl in Washington who wanted to sell her eyes for $1,500 to help her family, which included six siblings.\n\n82. Higham, pp. ix-x.\n\nChapter 2\n\n1.

Germany was not a signatory to such treaties, but on May 29, 1919, the Weimar government pledged: “Germany is resolved on her part to treat the national minorities living on her territory according to the same rules, that is to say, according to the principles laid down in the minorities treaties.” Joseph Roucek, “Minorities—Basis of the Refugee Problem,” Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 203 (May 1939): 6.\n\n13.

At Brussels in 1936 the Institute of International Law agreed that the term “refugee” would apply to persons who were forced to leave their homeland for political reasons, who were deprived of diplomatic protection, or who had acquired no diplomatic protection in another state. John Hope Simpson later suggested that the term more properly should apply to those who were “deprived of legal protection, mutual support, access to employment, and the measure of freedom of movement which happier mortals take as a matter of course.” The Refugee Problem: Report of a Survey (London: Oxford University Press, 1939), p. 3. This meant that anyone stripped of de jure national status, and even those who had not yet managed to flee a country, should be considered a refugee.

One way by which the Polish government attempted to outdo Germany was the issuance of a decree in Oct. 1938 which required Polish citizens living abroad to renew their passports by Oct. 29. The time factor prevented many in Germany from meeting the requirement, thereby depriving them of Polish citizenship and making them the responsibility of Germany. This precipitated Germany’s hasty roundup and dumping of nearly 18,000 persons on Oct. 29. See Belth, p. 378.\n\n19.

For Roosevelt’s concern that the country should remain a haven for the oppressed, witness his comment three years later: “For centuries this country has always been the traditional haven of refuge for countless victims of religious and political persecution in other lands. These immigrants have made outstanding contributions to American music, art, literature, business, finance, philanthropy, and many other phases of our cultural, political, industrial, and commercial life. It was quite fitting, therefore, that the United States Government should follow its traditional role and take the lead in calling and conducting the Evian meeting.” Public Papers and Addresses of Franklin D.

Roosevelt’s efforts to remove the obstreperous Carter Glass (Va.), “Cotton Ed” Smith (S.C.), Millard Tydings (Md.), Pat McCarran (Nev.), and Walter George (Ga.), among others, was a total failure. In addition, the Republicans gained eight seats in the Senate, eighty-one in the House, and even captured eleven governorships. See William L. Langer and S.

In Fortune’s July 1938 survey, nearly one-third of those interviewed indicated they were most disturbed by Japan’s invasion of China. Austria, Spain, and Russia’s purge trials elicited the next most interest, in that order. “The Fortune Quarterly Survey,” p. 80.\n\n32. Polls conducted by the AIPO and ORC in Mar., Apr., and May 1938 consistently showed that 10 to 12 percent of those surveyed blamed such persecutions entirely on the Jews, while another 48 to 50 percent indicated that it was “partly” the Jews’ own fault. See “Jewish Question,” in Cantril, p. 381, and Charles Stember et al., Jews in the Mind of America (New York: Basic Books, 1966), pp. 138–39.\n\n33. There were four distinct clusters of criticism: (1) Jews were overly concerned about money, unscrupulous in getting it, and dishonest in business; (2) Jews were pushy, domineering, aggressive, obstinate, and lacking in respect for the rights of others; (3) Jews were clannish, discriminated against non-Jews, and covered up for one another; (4) Jews were unrefined, ill-mannered, unclean, and generally repellent. Stember et al., pp. 54–69. The editors of Fortune published a good analysis of the Jews, The Jews in America (New York: Random House, 1936), and there were other studies which probed the origins of anti-Semitism in totalitarian thought or analyzed Christian responsibility for hatred of Jews with a purpose of demonstrating the absurdity of pinning specific traits upon certain peoples. See Johann Smertenko, “Hitlerism Comes to America,” Harper’s, 187 (Nov. 1935): 66–70; Frank Eakin, “What Christians Teach About Jews: Church Lesson Materials,” Christian Century, 52 (Sept. 18, 1935): 1173–76; Lyford Edwards, “Religious Sectarianism and Race Prejudice,” American Journal of Sociology, 41 (Sept. 1935): 167–79; Marjorie van de Walter, “Racial Psychology,” Science, 88 (Dec. 30, 1938): 7–8; May Sukov and E.

As late as 1946 only a handful of Americans could even approximate the number of Jews in this country. One in four estimated that there were more than 20,000,000 Jews in America. And 10 percent of those polled put the figure at more than 40,000,000. Stember et al., p. 77.\n\n35. Quoted in “Editorial Comment,” Contemporary Jewish Record, 1 (July 1938): 54–55.\n\n36. The AIPO figure in polls conducted in Apr. 1938, Mar. 1939, and May 1939 was 12 percent every time. “American Institute of Public Opinion Surveys,” p. 595.\n\n37. Only in 1942 did another group displace the Jews in this category. In that year, with the disastrous news from the Pacific fresh in Americans’ minds, the Japanese were regarded with greater dread than were the Jews. Invariably, however, the Jews placed ahead of the Germans. See Stember et al., p. 128. All kinds of explanations have been advanced for this, ranging from Talcott Parsons’s suggestion that the Jews have been blamed for the anomie resulting from the rapid development of an impersonalized, industrial society (“Some Sociological Aspects of the Fascist Movement,” Social Forces, 31 [Nov. 1942]: 138–47) to Richard Hofstadter’s claim that “there has been a curiously persistent linkage between anti-Semitism and money and credit obsessions.” The Age of Reform (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1955), p. 81. Whatever the cause, there is no doubt that these anti-Jewish sentiments were shared by large segments of the population in every area of the country.

Memorandum of Wise to Louis Lipsky, June 7, 1938, American Jewish Congress File, Stephen Wise Papers, Brandeis University Library, Waltham, Mass. Exactly such an attitude of disbelief in “atrocities” on the part of American Jewish Committee President Louis Marshall had led to a schism within the committee in World War I and the eventual founding of the Congress. See To the Jews of America: The Jewish Congress versus the American Jewish Committee (New York: Jewish Congress Organizing Committee, 1915), pp. 5–8.\n\n45. According to the Committee and B’nai B’rith, such actions would oversimplify the danger of Nazism to democratic institutions by merely identifying the movement with anti-Semitism. It was also argued that such boycott could only lead to reprisals against the Jews in Germany. By the fall of 1933, however, both organizations had come around to the position of the Congress. “American Jewish Congress,” Universal Jewish Encyclopedia, 1940, 1:250.\n\n46.

The Joint was to handle matters in Greater Germany, and the HIAS-HICEM in all matters in other countries. HIAS would receive all unattached men or men with families when they arrived in the U.S. and handle all appeals before the Department of Naturalization and Immigration. The National Council of Jewish Women would greet all unattached women. All of these agencies would act as referrals to the NRS, whose duty was to assist the refugee in resettling in the U.S., and to give him vocational and educational training. See Albert Phiebig and Frederick Grubel, HIAS Survey 1940–1941, special report prepared for HIAS, New York, 1942, YIVO, pp. 11, 99.\n\n50. This was a common fear which was also expressed by Henry Pratt Fairchild in “Should the Jews Come In?” New Republic, 94 (Jan. 25, 1939): 344.\n\n51. The upshot of this was the creation by Rosenwald and other leading assimilated American Jews of the American Council for Judaism. Founded in 1943, it was responsible for forcing the Department of Immigration and Naturalization to drop the category “Hebrew” from its annual statistics on immigration by “race.” Since that time, the council (numbering 20,000 members, including Stanley Marcus of Neiman-Marcus, Donald Klopfer of Random House, Walter Rothschild of Abraham and Strauss, and John Mosler, president of the Urban League of Greater New York) has consistently spoken out against Zionism. James Yaffe, The American Jews: Portrait of a Split Personality (New York: Random House, 1968), pp. 185–86, and New York Times, July 16, 1967, p. 48.\n\n52. The historical fact that people simply did not come to the U.S. during such economic crises was thoroughly examined in Bernard Ostrolenk, “The Economics of an Imprisoned World—A Brief for the Removal of Immigration Restrictions,” Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 203 (May 1939): 194–201. Such findings were later borne out by John Thomas, “The Economic Aspect,” in The Positive Contribution by Immigrants: A Symposium Prepared by UNESCO, The International Sociolog-Association and the International Economic Association, General Rapporteur Oscar Handlin (Paris: UNESCO, 1955), pp. 165–85, and S. Kuznets, National Production Since 1869 (New York: National Board of Economic Research, 1946), p. 118.\n\nBetween 1935 and 1939 only 28.6 percent of those persons entering the U.S. listed unskilled occupations, and most of these were servants, an occupation ever in great demand (Bernard, p. 46). Among the new arrivals were some 1,500 physicians, far less than the tidal wave feared by the AMA. See Memorandum for Joseph Chamberlain, undated, Chamberlain Collection. At the time the U.S. was graduating only 5,000 physicians a year, had even fallen behind the doctor-patient ratio in the country in 1886, and the deans of Bellevue, Harvard, Tufts, Johns Hopkins, and Yale medical schools all were calling for assistance to emigrant physicians who were badly needed here. See Henry Smith Leiper, “Those German Refugees,” Current History, SO (May 1939): 20–21.\n\nFinally, in 1942, a team of social workers headed by Sophia Robinson reported that some 800 “refugee” enterprises had been located in the U.S. More than half of these had introduced something to the American market which had never previously been produced in this country, including harmonicas and Lebkuchen. More significant, it was estimated that each refugee entrepreneur had created jobs for approximately seven American workers. See Sophia Robinson, Refugees at Work. See also Oscar and Mary Handlin, “The United States,” in Positive Contributions by Immigrants, p. 33; Abe Revusky, “Refugees in America, “National Jewish Monthly, 53 (Apr. 1939): 260–61; Memorandum of Joseph Chamberlain, undated, 1938, and letter from Joseph Hyman of the Joint Distribution Committee to Chamberlain, Chamberlain Collection.\n\n53.

When the war broke out these same refugees would win high praise from the British for their assistance in the manufacture of searchlights, prismatic reflectors, hardened glass ball bearings (substitutes for steel bearings), special torches, and other engineering work hitherto unknown in Britain.

Throughout the prewar period, restrictionists circulated rumors that an influx of refugees, particularly Jewish refugees, would result in wealthy Jews who were already in this country laying off as much as 2 percent of their work force, particularly Negroes, to accommodate their kinsmen. This charge was leveled against the New York department stores, where it was said one eventually would need a German dictionary to transact any business. The charge was vehemently denied by Delos Walker of Macy’s, Walter Hoving of Lord and Taylor, Kenneth Collins of Gimbel’s, and executives of Stern Bros., Bloomingdale’s, and Abraham and Strauss. See Leiper, p. 20, and also a report issued to the New York Times by the National Coordinating Committee, Nov. 25, 1938, Chamberlain Collection.\n\nAs for radicalism and criminality among immigrants, the Department of Immigration and Naturalization deported an average of forty persons a year for radicalism between 1907 and 1939. During that same period more than 14,000,000 persons came to the United States (Milner and Dempsey, “The Alien Myth,” p. 378). The Wickersham Committee testified in 1931 that “in proportion to their respective numbers, the foreign-born commit considerably fewer crimes than the native-born of the same age and sex” (Bernard, p. 122). A decade later the U.S. Census Bureau noted that the foreign-born constituted 4.1 percent of the institutionalized population of the U.S., while simultaneously accounting for 8.6 percent of the total civilian population. These figures are confirmed by a special survey done by the National Coordinating Committee in the summer of 1937. See report of New York City Commissioner A. H. McCormick, Department of Corrections, to NCC Secretary Cecilia Razovsky, June 25, 1937, Chamberlain Collection.\n\nAs for the threat of welfare dependency, no aliens were permitted on federal relief rolls in 1939. Only 4 percent of the total number of families on WPA rolls in 1936 were headed by men who were not citizens (Bernard, pp. 89–90). The states recording the highest per capita income were those with the greatest alien populations. A greater percentage of the foreign-born owned their homes (51.8 percent) than native-born (48.9 percent) (Milner and Dempsey, p. 377). And those foreign-born who did rent paid a higher average monthly rent than the native-born (Bernard, p. 73). Such indices reveal that the foreign-born were boosts to the economy.\n\n60. Chamberlain of the NCC issued a memorandum in July which spoke glowingly of “more food, shoes, hospitals, churches, beauty parlors” if this country welcomed the refugees.

Termed “Jüdische Selbsthäss” by Lessing in 1930, it explains the reluctance of powerful Jewish figures to champion the cause of their brethren in times of stress. See Kurt Lewin, “Self-Hatred Among Jews,” Contemporary Jewish Record, 4 (June 1941): 228–29. The idea that “semitophobia can lead to induced social neuroses in Jews, namely social-climbing or egomania” is also put forward in Read Bain, “Sociopathy of Anti-Semitism,” Sociometry, 6 (Nov. 1943): 460–64.\n\n67. A good example of this reluctance to identify oneself as a Jew, even to help a relative, can be seen in a letter from Frankfurter to Roosevelt, dated Oct. 24, 1941. Frankfurter informed the president of the death of an aged uncle, Solomon Frank, onetime director of the library of the University of Vienna, in a Nazi concentration camp where he had been detained since the Anschluss. “Precisely because I wanted to avoid the criticism even of the evil-minded and hardhearted against any charge of favoritism by your administration, I did not invoke the good offices of the State Department,” Frankfurter wrote.

Such letters and telegrams came from persons calling themselves “patriotic Democratic Americans” and a spurious Democratic Hollywood Movie Association. They were more than matched, perhaps as much as ten to one, by congratulatory messages from private citizens in this country and abroad. Especially pathetic were the pleas of a young Jewish girl in Czechoslovakia praising the president for his efforts and asking admission to the United States. In another an American Jew asked help for his relatives abroad. In a third an aged woman in this country spelled out in block letters her gratitude for all that the president had done for her people (Roosevelt Library).\n\n87. Virtually every American newspaper played up the positive contributions of refugees to American culture and argued that admission of Jewish refugees would be a signal act of Christian charity. The Fort Worth Star-Telegraph went so far as to suggest swapping Nazi-minded Americans for German Jews.

Two petitions, bearing the signatures of more than 300,000 persons, were presented to the White House.

Australia, with a population of 6,000,000, had more than 500,000 square miles of land which was readily available. It was estimated that the continent could sustain a population of perhaps 25,000,000. However, the government was committed to a narrowly construed, all-white restrictionist immigration policy which did not exclude Jews but worked against them. See Dorothy Thompson, Refugees: Anarchy or Organization (New York: Random House, 1938): p. 84; Marie Clements, “Australia: A Haven?” National Jewish Monthly, 53 (Jan. 1939): 163; and Ludwig Lore, “Watchman: What of the Refugees?” National Jewish Monthly, 52 (Aug.–Sept. 1938): 4–5.\n\n16.

Isaac, in Positive Contributions by Refugees, p. 54.\n\n18. Proceedings, Evian Committee, pp. 21–25. These statements can be challenged. While arguments may be made on either side as to whether the British actually pledged themselves to create a Jewish state, there is no question that British colonial officers did little to promote the flow of Jews into Palestine. What emigration did take place was conducted by Jewish agencies and against the will of the mandatory. Proof of Britain’s uncooperative action can be seen in the censure measure taken by the Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of Nations against His Majesty’s Government in June 1939. For a copy of this statement, see Oscar I. Janowsky, Foundations of Israel (Princeton, N.J.: Anvil Press, 1959), p. 142.\n\n19.

Representatives of these countries spoke with pride of the 40,000 refugees welcomed to Latin America since 1933. More impressive were the 171,000 immigrants accepted by Brazil between 1900 and 1939 and the six million accepted by Argentina since 1864. Delegates also could hardly be faulted for misinterpreting Mexico’s pledge to remain “an asylum to foreigners who were afraid for their lives.” “Evian Conference on Political Refugees,” Social Service Review, 12 (Sept. 1938): 516.\n\n21.

Long before the issuance of the White Paper, Rabbi Abba Silver of the ZOA and Solomon Goldman of the WZO exchanged telegrams warning that any closing of Palestine to Jewish immigration would mark the total failure of the IGCR. See Goldman to Silver, Oct. 11, 1938, Zionist Organization of America File, 1938–1939, Abba Silver Papers, the Temple Library, Cleveland.\n\n85. Foreign Relations of the U.S., General, British Commonwealth and Europe, 2:39. A good example of this was Wise’s rejection of any settlement plan for the Jews in Africa in lieu of Palestine. Apart from the indignity of asking refined Europeans to settle in the backward former German colonies of East Africa, Wise objected that “there will be an element of reprisal if Jews were to occupy the once German territories. The destruction of these Jewishly-occupied territories would become one of the supreme objectives of the German Reich.” Wise to Taylor, Nov. 23, 1938, FDR File, Wise Papers.\n\n86. “The German police will not dictate what the Committee can or cannot do,” Winterton commented.

Hans Thompson, German charge d’affaires in Washington, issued a protest to Welles several days later. The undersecretary rejected it, saying that Ickes was entitled to his own opinion and adding that it was ironic that Germany should protest in view of Nazi vituperations against Roosevelt.

Morgenthau to Roosevelt, Nov. 21, 1938, Refugee Folder, Roosevelt Library. This and similar settlement schemes had been fully debated by the President’s Advisory Committee as early as Oct. 13. They had been rejected then by most experts as unrealistic and idealistic. See Minutes of Oct. 13, 1938, President’s Advisory Committee on Political Refugees File, Wise Papers.\n\n18. Foreign Relations of the U.S., 1:837–55.\n\n19. Among the more bizarre plans that crossed Hull’s desk was one from Mexico which indicated that government’s willingness to accept immigrants who established “mestizo” families in Mexico. Whether this meant a desire to become a naturalized citizen or to intermarry with a renunciation of the Jewish faith, no one at the State Department was able to say. In any case, prospects for mass settlement in Mexico appeared slim. For Hull’s memorandum to Roosevelt, Nov. 28, 1938, see Refugee Folder, Roosevelt Library.\n\n20. In Jan. 1939 a group of Austrian Jews bound for the Dominican Republic was stranded in the U.S. because of new laws passed after they had sailed from Europe. At the same time, thirty-seven passengers aboard the S.S. Imperial were denied admission to Peru because their documents were said to be invalid. Several days later Paraguay revoked the immigration permits of 300 Jewish refugees, leaving them stranded in Uruguay. Twenty-three refugees aboard the S.S. Orinoco were repulsed by Mexico after they had succeeded in bribing the Mexican consul in Germany for their papers. At the end of the month another eighty-three Jewish refugees aboard the S.S. Caribia were denied passage into Trinidad.\n\nAt first these unfortunates could find eventual havens in other Latin American nations, but these countries also tightened up their restrictions as Jews continued to pour across the Atlantic. In March, Uruguay refused to admit another group of Jews. In May, Chile suspended all immigration for a year. Twelve days later Colombia followed suit. A week later Jewish agencies in Bolivia exposed a plot to sell Jews permission to settle in that country.\n\nThe worst incident, however, took place in June, when the Cuban government of Laredo Bru revoked the landing permits of 907 passengers aboard the S.S. St. Louis. After considering the idea of extorting $1,000,000 from Jewish organizations in the U.S. for the passengers’ safety, the Cuban government forced the St. Louis out to sea. For the near-happy ending of this tale see Morse, pp. 270–88. For details on the other incidents see Cecilia Razovsky, “Disorganized Panic Emigration,” speech prepared for the National Coordinating Committee, Feb. 1939, Chamberlain Papers; and New York Times, Mar. 10, 1939, p. 5; May 5, 1939, p. 13; May 17, 1939, p. 13; May 25, 1939, p. 13.\n\n21. Jews were no longer welcome in South Africa, Ceylon, the Philippines, or Shanghai, China, which included about 20,000 Jewish immigrants in its foreign colony by 1939. For this distressing side of the refugee problem, see David Popper, “A Homeland for Refugees,” Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 203 (May 1939): 168–76; and Simpson, Refugees: A Review Since September, 1938, pp. 107–10.

Foreign Relations of the U.S., 1:858–60.\n\n23. Several months later Goering and Hitler delighted in accusing Roosevelt of “creeping paralysis of the brain” when the president naively sought guarantees from Germany that it had no territorial designs on thirty-one states, including the Arabias and Liechtenstein. Despite newsreels showing Nazi deputies laughing hysterically at Hitler’s reading of his note, Roosevelt followed it up with another dated Aug. 24, 1939, which began: “To the message which I sent you last April, I have received no reply.” Roosevelt to Hitler, Germany 1933–1945 File, Roosevelt Library.\n\n24.

Mussolini charged that if the United States opened its doors to a population comparable in density with that of Italy, this nation could accommodate at least one billion more immigrants. N. Levin, The Holocaust, p. 127.\n\n26. At the same time, Rabbi M. L. Perlzweig of the British section of the World Jewish Congress rejected any proposed settlement in Djibouti.

In Jan. 1939, Elmo Roper reported that 67 percent of the American people opposed any major legislative or administrative changes in government. This conservatism was also directed against Roosevelt, as only 33 percent of those polled indicated a willingness to vote for the president if he ran again in 1940, while 55 percent said no to a third term. You and Your Leaders: Their Actions and Your Reactions, 1936–1956 (New York: William Morrow and Co., 1957), pp. 30–38.\n\n29. Rosenman warned that any legislative debate over the problem would merely delay comprehensive international action. In view of the threatened magnitude of the Jewish refugee problem in Poland and Rumania, Rosenman argued for immediate settlement in new and undeveloped regions of Africa or South America. That leaders of Jewish organizations, especially Zionist groups, had always opposed such proposals made little impact upon Rosenman, who worried about the threat of a tidal wave of Jews, and only Jews, coming to the U.S. in this emergency.

The first group did not arrive until Feb. 15, 1935, over the opposition of John Trevor’s American Coalition, which exhorted Americans “to be on guard” against this subversion of their immigration laws. See German-Jewish Children’s Aid File, Chamberlain Collection.\n\n32. According to a lengthy study done by the German-Jewish Children’s Aid, none of the children admitted in the previous four years had encountered significant difficulties in social, educational, or vocational adjustment. Thirty-two thus admitted had already achieved self-support. Memorandum of German-Jewish Children’s Aid, Jan. 1, 1939, ibid. Spewack wanted to bring in all refugee children from Germany and Austria who were under age ten. Memorandum of Rosenwald to Chamberlain, Dec. 2, 1938, ibid.\n\n33.

According to Rosenwald, Isidor Lubin had said that Perkins was trying to instigate legislation in Congress to enable German Jewish children to come over as immigrants, but not under the quota system. Precisely the same idea was embodied in the Wagner-Rogers Bill. Memorandum of Rosenwald to Chamberlain, Dec. 2, 1938, Chamberlain Collection.\n\n35. Hearings on German Refugee Children, p. 9.\n\n36.

Pickett vividly described the terror and insecurity felt by non-Aryan children who were spat upon, insulted, and physically degraded merely because of their Jewish lineage. Hearings on German Refugee Children, p. 57. Sidney Hollander, a Jewish member of the Non-Sectarian Committee, told of children who had seen their parents taken to concentration camps because they were Jewish and who subsequently had received urns containing their fathers’ ashes. Hollander also told of a Jewish orphanage in Vienna which was closed down without warning in the middle of the night. The children, the eldest aged three, were carried from door to door in search of shelter (p. 91). Robert Balderston of Chicago, just back from two months’ volunteer work in the soup kitchens operated by the Friends amid no-man’s lands, described the plight of Jews in these purgatories (pp. 72–78). And Robert Yarnall, a Philadelphia engineer and a Quaker who had worked in Germany under the Hoover Child Welfare Administration after World War I, reported, “I am convinced there is no future for Jewish or non-Aryan children in Greater Germany now or in the near future” (p. 134).\n\n38.

The Wagner file includes several hundred negative letters, including some which accused the senator of being a tool of Wall Street and one which threatened, “You are getting in too deep with some people, BEWARE.

The most striking testimony along these lines was given by Agnes Waters, a resident of Washington, speaking as an individual, not for some organization. She charged that 7,000,000 such alien saboteurs already were roaming the land. When the committee finally dismissed her with disgust, she continued, calling Rep. John Lesinski (D.-Mich.), who had risen to leave, “a Third Internationale.” Hearings on H. J. Res. 165 and H. J. Res. 168, p. 256.
