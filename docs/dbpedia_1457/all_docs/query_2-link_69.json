And most importantly what did you learn from your experience?\n\n\nRegardless of destination or purpose, travel changes you. It forces you to step out of your comfort zone, meet new people, and learn about yourself in unexpected ways. At Trip of a Lifetime, we believe that all students, regardless of income or social background, should have the opportunity to travel and have made it our mission to provide travel experiences to as many underserved students as possible.\n\n\nTo date, Trip of a Lifetime has raised over $800,000 and has provided travel experiences for over 500 students. Our main program is our summer travel scholarships, which provide 20-30 students every year with full scholarships to participate in teen tours and community service programs. We're also recognized by the New York City Department of Education and have been mentioned in the Wall Street Journal and Westchester Magazine.",
