        "text": "Senate Democrats today agreed to keep acting Senate President Harriette Chandler in the top post through the end of the year, ensuring embattled ex-president Stan Rosenberg will not return to power for at least this session.\n\nThe decision, made during a closed-door caucus, came as the Senate has been rocked by fresh allegations involving Rosenberg and his estranged husband, which had led Rosenberg to step down and Chandler to be named acting president late last year.\n\n\"We have work to do for the people that elected us and 'acting' doesn't quite do it anymore,\" Chandler told reporters today, as Democrats gathered behind her in a State House hallway. \"We are now at that point where we need a president that has the full responsibilities and the full authority of a president of the Senate.\"\n\nAsked if the decision will close the door to Rosenberg resuming the presidency, Chandler said, \"Yes, for this term, because I am the president.\"\n\nRosenberg, who has continued to serve in the Senate after stepping down from his leadership role, did not attend the meeting, which lasted for nearly three hours.\n\n“I am confident that Senate President Chandler will serve the Senate and the Commonwealth with distinction,\" Rosenberg said in a statement this afternoon that referenced his husband Bryon Hefner. \"I support what’s best for the Senate and the Commonwealth, and I deeply regret the disruption that has been caused by the necessity of the investigation. I reiterate that Bryon had no influence over my actions or decisions as Senate President, and I look forward to the completion of the investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee.”\n\nRosenberg stepped down from the presidency in December amid allegations that Hefner had sexually assaulted or harassed four men while bragging about the sway he held over Senate business.\n\nA weekend Boston Globe report threw fresh fuel on the firestorm with allegations that Hefner had access to Rosenberg's email, an apparent breach to the \"firewall\" Rosenberg had years ago promised to put up between his spouse and Senate business.\n\nRosenberg has denied that Hefner had influence over him and the chamber. The Senate hired a law firm to lead an investigation into the Amherst Democrat, which is still ongoing. The attorney general's office and Suffolk district attorney's office also are investigating.\n\nThe allegations have cracked Rosenberg's once-strong support in the Senate, with some of his fellow Democrats publicly stating the latest allegations disqualify him from ever recapturing the presidency.\n\n\"I think first things first is to make sure … we decide that Sen. Rosenberg will not be returning as Senate president,\" state Sen. James Welch said this morning before the caucus. \"I think at this point it's become clear that the firewall (between Rosenberg and Hefner) was either never set up or at the very least, very ineffective.\"\n\nOther senators have begun jockeying for the prime leadership position. Senators Karen Spilka and Sal DiDomencio have been speaking with their colleagues in recent days, and Sen. Eileen Donoghue has also said she'd be interested in the post, if it opens. Sen. Eric Lesser has also surfaced as a potential candidate.\n\n\"I think we need to look truly to the future of the Senate,\" state Sen. Ann Gobi said of Lesser, who she's backing. \"I'm 55. I'm not going to be here forever. So I think it's important to look to people that have a fresh approach to things. And I understand the experience that comes with being in the State House, but there are a lot of other experiences that count just as much.\n\n\"I think once they start thinking of him in that role and he has the opportunity to speak with every member and share his vision for the Senate, I think the support that he has will continue to grow,\" Gobi said.\n\nChandler said she will not seek the presidency next year, but plans to run for re-election to her seat. She also said she will name a new majority leader to fill out her leadership team through the session, which formally wraps in August."
