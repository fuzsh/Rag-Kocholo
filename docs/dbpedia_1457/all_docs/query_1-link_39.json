        "text": "By Matt Murphy\n\nSTATE HOUSE NEWS SERVICE\n\nBOSTON — Facing questions about his domestic partner’s role in business on Beacon Hill, Senate Majority Leader Stanley Rosenberg on Wednesday moved to quiet any discontent among members by assuring them of a \"firewall\" between his personal life and work.\n\nRosenberg, who is expecting to be elected by his colleagues to lead the Senate as president in January, wrote a letter to Democratic senators on Wednesday following a report in the Boston Globe about his partner Bryon Hefner allegedly using Twitter to anonymously mock outgoing Senate President Therese Murray and meddling in deliberations over leadership posts and committee positions.\n\n\"As you saw from my response, I was open and transparent as I have been in the past. I intend to lead the Senate in the same way. As I have also told the Globe, I have enforced a firewall between my private life and the business of the Senate, and will continue to do so,\" Rosenberg wrote.\n\nHefner, 27, interned in Rosenberg’s office before they became romantically involved, and now works at Regan Communications.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2013, Hefner was chair of The Rosenberg Committee, managing the fundraising and political strategy for his partner. In August, when the News Service reported on Hefner’s promotion at Regan, he identified himself as \"no stranger to Beacon Hill\" and said his client portfolio was \"growing\" and included Bank of America, Heritage Museums & Gardens and the Mashpee Wampanoags, who have plans to build a casino in Taunton. Rosenberg, who led Senate efforts to pass the 2011 casino law, is poised next year to become the Senate’s first openly gay president.\n\nAccording to the Globe, Rosenberg ordered Hefner to shut down his social media accounts that had allegedly been used to mock Murray.\n\nThe letter also sought to dispel the idea that Hefner wields influence over Rosenberg’s office and the incoming Senate president’s decision-making process. Rosenberg was not at the State House on Wednesday and unavailable for comment.\n\nRosenberg in the letter thanked Senate Democrats for attending a \"retreat\" at the UMass Club two weeks ago, and asked them to plan on their first caucus on Jan. 8 the day of Baker’s swearing in and the day after lawmakers are sworn in and new Senate president is elected.\n\nSen. Stephen Brewer, a Barre Democrat who did not run for re-election after losing the internal power struggle with Rosenberg to lock up the necessary votes to become president, called it a \"personal issue,\" and declined to speculate whether the Hefner situation would impact Rosenberg’s election to succeed Murray.\n\n\"I’ve known Stan Rosenberg for 35 years. We both came to work in this building in February 1980. He’s a very, very good legislator and a very, very good man and I’m proud to call him my friend,\" Brewer said.\n\nAsked about Hefner inserting himself in Senate business, Brewer said, \"There is no building in the world that has more rumors in it than this building. Stan is good man, He’ll make a fine Senate president and he has my support.\"\n\nBrewer spoke after meeting with some of the incoming Senate class, which includes three new Democrats and two new Republicans.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Bruce Tarr, who also met with the pre-freshmen, said he found some of the claims to be \"unsubstatiated,\" but still concerning and worthy of being addressed.\n\n\"Certainly it would be a concern if someone was, A, acting in a disrespecting manner of the presiding officer of the Senate and, B, indicating that they had some disproportionate influence in the way that things were going to be operated in the Senate,\" Tarr said.\n\nThough Tarr said he had not spoken to other senators about the story, he said he hoped Rosenberg would be able to deal with the matter and address members’ concerns before the start of the new session.\n\n\"The incoming Senate President needs to address the issue. I believe he’s made some statements relative to that today and I hope he’ll continue to reinforce the message that the Senate will be run in an objective and transparent and fair way and not through innuendo or improper influence by outside individuals,\" Tarr said.\n\nOthers, including Sen. Sonia Chang-Diaz and House Speaker Robert DeLeo, declined to comment when approached in the hall.\n\nWhile few senators were in the building on Wednesday, most are expected to be on hand Thursday when five departing senators plan to deliver farewell remarks during a session that begins at 2 p.m. Murray is also hosting her annual holiday reception at the State House in the evening Thursday when many senators bring their spouses and significant others."
