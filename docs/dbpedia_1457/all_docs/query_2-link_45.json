        "text": "As a former legal professional turned academician, I've learned that growth and development are often a result of embracing challenges and stepping out of our comfort zones. In my legal career, I was comfortable navigating the courtroom and advising clients, but I felt a sense of stagnation. I yearned for a new challenge, one that would allow me to grow both personally and professionally. That's when I decided to pursue a career in academia. The transition wasn't easy. I had to adapt to a new environment, develop new skills, and navigate unfamiliar terrain. But with each challenge, I grew. I learned to think critically, write effectively, and communicate complex ideas simply. Now, as an academician, I encourage my students to embrace challenges and take risks. Whether it's tackling a complex legal issue, arguing a case before a mock court, or simply speaking up in class, I remind them that growth happens outside of their comfort zones. So, if you're feeling stagnant or complacent, remember that without challenge, there is no growth. Take that leap, pursue that new opportunity, and embrace the uncertainty. Your growth and success depends on it! #GrowthMindset #ChallengeAccepted #LegalProfessional #Academician #PersonalGrowth #ProfessionalDevelopment\n\n𝐖𝐇𝐀𝐓 𝐃𝐑𝐎𝐏𝐏𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐎𝐔𝐓 𝐎𝐅 𝟏𝐒𝐓 𝐘𝐄𝐀𝐑 𝐋𝐀𝐖 𝐓𝐀𝐔𝐆𝐇𝐓 𝐌𝐄 𝐀𝐁𝐎𝐔𝐓 𝐄𝐗𝐄𝐂𝐔𝐓𝐈𝐕𝐄 𝐃𝐄𝐂𝐈𝐒𝐈𝐎𝐍 𝐌𝐀𝐊𝐈𝐍𝐆 Once upon a time, I thought I wanted to be a lawyer.. I was so committed to studying law that I voluntarily repeated year 12, just to get into uni.. Against the wishes of family & other ppl advising me on career option pathways (including the high school psychologist/careers counsellor), I listened to myself & was judged, by many.. 2 profound lessons came from this 1 decision, at age 17.. 1. I committed to my goal to get into uni 2. I committed to not caring about what other ppl thought Notice the theme? \"I committed to xyz...\" These days, people can't even commit to showing up at a decided location without 99x text messages & 66 voice notes 5mins prior to the set app time.. It's just bananas how haphazard & distracted ppl are these days! Quitting law school was a huge blessing in disguise.. The reason WHY I wanted to become a lawyer is now being fulfilled fully, in how I serve in my holistic therapy business.. Instead of ignoring my intuition & continuing on a path I knew deep down wouldn't fulfill my highest values, I pivoted fast.. In everything you are & do, YOU get to choose.. What do you need to drop (or drop out of) right now, to feel fulfilled? A toxic habit? A toxic relationship? A toxic mindset? All of the things you're ignoring lead you far away from being a functional decision maker.. When you learn to TRUST YOURSELF, it's game on.. Let's play that game. If you default to listening to other ppl all the time, you're doomed.. Me, inclusive. Why? Whose going to think for you on your last breath? Let that land..\n\n☎️ Before you embark on your journey in the corporate world, internalize the first and, in my view, the most practical principle I've encountered in the lecture I'm recommending to you today: 👮♀️Law 1: Never Outshine the Master - always make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to please or impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opposite – inspire fear or insecurity. Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the highest heights of power. You may be fortunate, like myself, to have bosses wiser than you. Wise enough to, in rare (let’s face it) moments when they're wrong, admit it with humor and humility. And in other cases, guide me with the tact and skill of a mentor. You might, however, have the misfortune of experiencing the opposite attitude, when someone in a managerial position confuses their position with the throne of a past ruler and demanding unwavering homage. Before determining which category your boss falls into, you must adeptly apply Law 1 and, as a precaution, lower your IQ by 15 points below your boss's level. 📕Today, I would like to suggest reading the book „48 Laws of Power” by Robert Greene. As one reviewer eloquently described it: “Three thousand years of power history condensed into the raw essence of 48 laws.” Amoral, cunning, ruthless, and instructive – delving into this book can be discomforting. Not because what's written is untrue, but because what we read in it has been done to us, or potentially could be done to us, and it's better to consciously choose whether we want to submit to it or use it ourselves. 🌀And now, a few bittersweet examples of the described laws. You don't have to agree with them, but it's worth familiarizing yourself with them, each of the presented laws of Machiavelli or Sun-Tzu finds application in life: ✅ Be Wary of Friends - Use Enemies: Keep a close eye on your friends — they get envious and will undermine you. If you co-opt an enemy, he’ll be more loyal than a friend because he’ll try harder to prove himself worthy of your trust. ✅ Say As Little As Possible - The less you say, the more intimidating and powerful you are. When you do speak, make it vague and ambiguous, leaving the meaning to others to interpret. They’ll be frustrated and obsessed with trying to figure you out. ✅ Don’t take sides - Don’t commit to any side or cause except yourself. By maintaining your independence, you remain in control — others will vie for your attention, and you can play one side against another. It was tough selecting just 3 out of 48. However quoting 10 would spoil the joy of discovery for you. 💡I highly recommend Robert Greene's book. As you read, observe your body's reactions. Muscle tension, dilating pupils. Humans wish to believe in their and others' nobility. Sometimes we are noble. Sometimes. 🗽Read, and enlightenment shall follow! #leadership\n\n“Sometimes I feel, I’m really not sure if I’m cut out for this!” A mentee of mine, recently said this during a conversation we were having about her two-year business program. She asked me if it is okay to feel unsure about the choices made in terms of the course she is pursuing. Her mind was clouded with doubts and she wasn’t sure if she wanted to pursue a career in business or walk down the corporate path. I smiled as she expressed her concerns and reassured her that it is perfectly normal to have such spurts of self doubt over the course of our careers. Even while we are in school or college we invariably are swarmed with questions like ‘Will this course help my career’? or ‘is this what I want to do for the rest of my life?’ I recommend that when we are pursuing a certain course or are enrolled in an educational program, we should look at it as a way of picking up specific skills that will ultimately help us in whatever career we eventually pursue. For instance, when I was studying to be a lawyer or beginning to work as a junior lawyer, there are many skills that I picked up which served me well later in life in my role as a CEO. While my law degree did not teach me the ropes of running a business, the skills I learnt during my years in law school proved invaluable later in my role as a business leader. Over the last 15 years whenever I’ve been tasked with an operational or a business role, I have found myself reaching back and picking up on skills that I had imbibed as a law student. The ability to be detail oriented, to be able to distil the most important information from troves of data, the capacity to listen to a plethora of divergent opinions and arrive at a considered decision are all essential skills that a good lawyer must possess. As it happens to be, these skills are also vital to running a business. Therefore, whether you are pursuing a particular educational program or working at a company and feeling restless or not quite sure if this is what you want to do for the rest of your life, it’s perfectly okay. Instead of thinking of it as a waste of time, why look at it as a way of picking up important life skills that will help you in the future in whatever be your final pursuit! Homage\n\nCal Newport's Deep Work has breathed fresh air into my search for meaning and satisfaction as a law student and legal professional, especially when one takes into strong consideration the culture most legal firms in Singapore reflect. The argument for depth in work and life draws from psychological and philosophical perspectives. Csizskentmihalyi's concept of flow suggests that meaningful experiences occur when individuals are fully engaged in challenging tasks, leading to higher life satisfaction. Newport proposes redesigning jobs to enhance well-being. Additionally, the notion of craftsmanship provides a sense of sacredness and meaning outside the self, as craftsman cultivate inherent virtues in their work. This perspective challenges the post-Enlightenment emphasis on individual autonomy and encourages a deeper engagement with one's profession. Whether in traditional craftsmanship or modern knowledge work, the pursuit of excellence and skill fosters a sense of meaning and fulfillment. Embracing deep work is essential to extracting meaning from professional endeavours, transforming them from mundane obligations into portals to a richer, more satisfying life. By embracing deep work and cultivating a sense of sacredness and appreciation for the nuances of legal work, lawyers can derive satisfaction from the innate merits of their profession. This perspective challenges the notion that meaning must be solely derived from external sources, advocating instead for a deeper engagement with the complexities and responsibilities of legal practice. Regardless of industry, whether you’re a writer, marketer, consultant, or lawyer: Your work is craft, and if you hone your ability and apply it with respect and care, then like the skilled wheelwright you can generate meaning in the daily efforts of your professional life. However, one can't take off for the skies of deep work flying blind. Mentorship nevertheless plays a vital role in nurturing the practice among professionals, providing guidance, role modelling, accountability, and encouragement as individuals strive to cultivate meaningful and fulfilling careers. I quote Winifried Gallagher, the converted disciple of depth who said, “I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is.” Cal concluded perfectly that a deep life is a good life, any way you look at it. A happy advanced Chinese New Year to all, may prosperity be blessed in the material and intangible. I hope we all return from the festive period with recharged and refocused minds to perform with deeper meanings, not just for clients or grades, but for ourselves most importantly. 😌\n\nI just spent 2 weeks with my parents in Italy. Although part of our mission was to visit family members whose health was not the strongest, we still had some downtime together. Drank homemade wine. Ate pasta. Enjoyed desserts. My parents are Italian, so it was a nice way to reconnect with my roots. But the best part was, I wasn’t obsessing over clients and cases. My team was trained. All the systems were in place. Nothing broke. I was actually able to sleep without worrying and waking up in the middle of the night. That wasn't always the case, though. If you know my story, it's been anything but linear. Went through the stress. Suffered from anxiety. The whole spectrum of ups and downs. But today, I couldn't be more grateful that I built a law career I love, and that gives me freedom and flexibility. I know many attorneys are struggling. I've been there. The good news, though, is you can find freedom and fulfillment in your law career. You don't have to tolerate the cocktail of stress, depression, overthinking, and anxiety. I don't mean to oversimplify the process, but the key is simple: It starts with knowing your values and building your career around them. Too many attorneys don't know their career values, so no matter how successful they become, they still feel miserable. They don't teach us this in law school, unfortunately. That's why it took me coaching to figure this out. That’s also why I went through two coaching certifications myself—to help people experiencing the same. If your law career isn't giving you what you want… If you’re feeling stuck, confused, or out of place… If you feel like something has to change but don’t know why… Reach out. I'll be happy to tell you about what my process looks like to help you. I coach attorneys to build careers they genuinely love and that give them freedom and flexibility. Every attorney deserves to enjoy and find fulfillment in their career. My DMs are open. ----------------------------------------------------- Pic of my parents and me at Tropea, Italy.\n\nLaw students and recent graduates: many attorneys enjoy speaking with you and lending a helping hand. I am one of them. When I was that law student or recent graduate, I thought that it would be a burden to reach out to busy lawyers to ask about their practice. So I did so infrequently. And when some of my early reach-outs reacted poorly to my attempts, my attempts grew rarer still. It is something that I regret and that I want to help make sure does not happen to lawyers in my shoes 10-12 years ago. This is an open invitation to new lawyers and lawyers-to-be to reach out. I can’t promise I can help, but I can promise an encouraging conversation and some direction, at a minimum. Colleagues, I invite you to make yourselves more approachable and foster a more open environment for #mentoring. Speaking to newer lawyers is fun, rewarding, and provides perspective on how they are thinking about important issues facing the profession."
