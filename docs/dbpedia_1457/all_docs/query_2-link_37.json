        "text": "A “devastated” Senate President Stanley Rosenberg dodged questions on whether he should keep his post even as a fellow Democrat called for him to step aside, further fueling the firestorm ignited by allegations his husband sexually assaulted or harassed four men while boasting about his political clout.\n\nAn emotional Rosenberg yesterday denied his husband, Bryon Hefner, had any influence on Senate business as he read from a prepared statement outside his third-floor office. But the beleaguered Amherst Democrat did not address whether he intends to resign amid a Senate investigation and ended the press conference without taking questions, citing the expected probe.\n\nHe was later trailed by reporters to a fourth-floor elevator, but ignored a series of queries before stepping in. Asked if he’ll ever answer questions, he said, “Have a good night,” and the doors closed.\n\nIt did little to quell the swirling controversy. State Sen. Barbara L’Italien, an Andover Democrat who is running for an open 3rd District U.S. Congressional seat, became the first elected official from the body to publicly call for him to step down, saying it’s “warranted” for the sake of transparency.\n\n“I believe that for the sake of the institution, the Senate president should also step aside from the duties of the Senate presidency for the duration of any investigation,” L’Italien said in a statement last night, adding she intends to voice her stance at a closed-door caucus on Monday. “The business of the people of Massachusetts is more important than any one senator.”\n\nThe firestorm surrounding Rosenberg is expected to continue at that session, when state senators plan to a huddle in a rare, bipartisan caucus and then vote to authorize an independent investigator to dig into the bombshell allegations.\n\nA press release ahead of that caucus adds leadership “will not be coordinating or discussing anything pertaining to this matter” with Rosenberg or his staff.\n\nThree men told The Boston Globe that Hefner, 30, indecently groped them, and a fourth said he forcibly kissed him, all while he bragged about being involved in Senate work as a teammate with his politically powerful, 68-year-old husband.\n\nState Sen. Harriette Chandler, the Senate’s majority leader, had called the move to bring in a special investigator an “unprecedented step,” and Rosenberg has said he would recuse himself. But he otherwise will remain in his post and, Chandler stressed, “retain his responsibilities for all other matters.”\n\nIt could create a potentially awkward position, and even raise questions of impartiality. If approved as expected, the independent investigator is currently slated to hand over any findings to the Senate’s Committee on Ethics, whose chairman — Michael J. Rodrigues (D-Plymouth) — was appointed by Rosenberg. The committee would then vote on possible actions and whether to make the investigation’s results public.\n\nThe probe, at least for now, creates an open question of whether Rosenberg should step aside, according to state Sen. Bruce Tarr, the chamber’s minority leader who, with Chandler, is leading the selection of an investigator.\n\n“That does concern me,” the Gloucester Republican said. “We need to make a determination whether … he has an inability to operate effectively. From my perspective, it’s too soon to tell.”\n\nRosenberg said he was “shocked and devastated” by the allegations, and said Hefner planned to enter a treatment program for “alcohol dependence.” He called the past day the most difficult in his political career “and in personal life,” but he stressed that he’s kept a so-called firewall between his work and his spouse.\n\n“He has no influence over policy, the internal operations of the Senate, or any Senate related business,” Rosenberg said. “If Bryon claimed to have influence over my decisions or over the Senate, he should not have said that. It is simply not true.”"
