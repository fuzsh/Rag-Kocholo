BLOCK, NOMINEE TO BE JUDGE FOR THE UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS ---------- THURSDAY, AUGUST 1, 2002 United States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, D.C. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:00 p.m., in room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Richard J. Durbin presiding. Present: Senators Durbin, Schumer, Hatch, Specter, and Sessions. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD J. DURBIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Senator Durbin. I want to welcome you all and thank you for coming. There is a force more powerful than a locomotive, and it is an adjourning Congress, and we are now in the closing hours of the session and many members are anxious to get back to their States and their families and other plans. We are going to have a series of roll calls that begin at about three o'clock, maybe a few minutes before, that may take up our time until four o'clock, or even later. It is my intention to try to move with dispatch through this portion of the hearing so that we can get everybody considered today. Many of you have made great sacrifices to be here and I do not want to put this off any period of time or delay you in your efforts. Our colleagues are going to join us in the beginning here to say kind words of praise, and I would ask my friend, Senator Gramm, and all who are here to suppress the urge to cover the nominees with great praise so that we might be able to actually have a hearing and consider them today before we are forced to go vote and adjourn. Today marks the 23rd judicial nomination hearing since the Senate reorganization took place less than 13 months ago. The Senate, under Democratic leadership, has now confirmed 64 Federal judges, including 13 to the U.S. Courts of Appeals. Fourteen more nominees have been reported out of committee and will likely be confirmed in the days and weeks ahead. I will put the rest of this statement in the record. I am proud of the record of Chairman Leahy on this committee and am happy to work with him. I am hoping that we can move through these nominees today with dispatch, and to start that ball rolling I will now defer to my colleague, Senator Hatch, for his opening remarks. [The prepared statement of Senator Durbin appears as a submission for the record.] STATEMENT OF HON. ORRIN G. HATCH, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF UTAH Senator Hatch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I think what I will do is defer my comments. We are just very pleased to have all of you. We welcome you here. We are proud of each and every one of you who has been nominated for a judgeship. In particular, we are very proud of Larry Block, who has served this committee well and who has been nominated for the Court of Claims, and we are very pleased that he is having his hearing today and we expect all to go well. So with that, we will just save the time and get right on with it. Senator Durbin. Thank you very much, Senator Hatch. Senator Hatch. And we will put our statements in the record. Senator Durbin. Both of our statements will be entered into the record in their entirety. [The prepared statement of Senator Hatch appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Hatch. And also a statement by Patrick J. Toomey, submitted to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on behalf of Judge James Knoll Gardner. Senator Durbin. Without objection. [The prepared statement of Mr. Toomey appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Durbin. Senator Gramm? PRESENTATION OF RONALD H. CLARK, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS BY HON. PHIL GRAMM, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS Senator Gramm. Well, Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I appreciate your holding the hearing. I am very happy to be here to recommend Ron Clark to you. He graduated with high honors from the University of Connecticut, Phi Beta Kappa. He was an outstanding law student at the University of Texas. He is board-certified in both civil trial law and civil appellate law. He is simply one of the most outstanding lawyers in the Sherman-Denison area. He has been a leader of the Boy Scouts. He has been honored by the NAACP. If anybody has ever said anything bad about Ron Clark, I haven't heard it. I would have to say that I thought Ron was doing an excellent job in the legislature. It never makes me happy to see a great office-holder become a Federal judge. Other than killing somebody or sending them into exile, when you put them on the Federal bench, that is as close as you can come to eliminating them from the political process, and it should be. But in any case, he is qualified. He is a top hand, as we would say in our State, and while I would have preferred that he follow a political career, he is a brilliant lawyer and deserves to be on the Federal bench and I commend him to you. Senator Hatch. Thank you. Senator Durbin. Thank you very much, Senator Gramm. We appreciate your testimony. Although there are other Senators who may come and join us, I am going to proceed, if it is all right with Senator Hatch, to call on the first panel, Judge Raggi, to come forward to the witness table, and if you would remain standing while I administer the oath. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Judge Raggi. I do. Senator Durbin. Thank you. Let the record reflect that the nominee has answered in the affirmative. Thank you for being with us today. Senator Durbin. If you would at this time be kind enough to introduce family and friends who have joined you here today and then proceed with your opening statement. STATEMENT OF REENA RAGGI, OF NEW YORK, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT Judge Raggi. I would be happy to. I would like to introduce my mother, Mrs. Edward Raggi, who was also here when I was considered for the district court; my husband, David Denton, and my son, David Denton, Jr. I also have a number of friends here. I am not going to introduce all of them, but I do have some really outstanding lawyers, my former law clerks. All of them are here. Senator Durbin. Thank you. If you would be kind enough to suspend for a moment, I notice that our colleague, Senator Santorum, has joined us. You may stay seated. Please do. In the interest of time, we are expediting opening statements, and if the Senator would like to make reference to the record-- PRESENTATION OF JAMES K. GARDNER, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA BY HON. RICK SANTORUM, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA Senator Santorum. Let me ask consent that my full statement be made a part of the record. Senator Durbin. Without objection. Senator Santorum. I just want to thank the chairman for holding this hearing. As I am sure you have heard, Judge Gardner has an incredible record of educational accomplishment, has served with great distinction both as a Common Pleas Court judge in the Lehigh Valley, as well as a distinguished career in the Judge Advocate Corps in the U.S. Navy. He is someone who I think will just do an incredible job as an Eastern District Court judge in Pennsylvania and I am here to heartily recommend his nomination to this committee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Senator Santorum appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Durbin. I am sure Senator Hatch joins me in thanking you, Senator Santorum. I notice that Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison has arrived. We are expediting opening remarks because of a pending roll call, so if you would like to give us the condensed version, with leave, we will enter your entire statement in the record. PRESENTATION OF RONALD H. CLARK, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS BY HON. KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS Senator Hutchison. You don't want my 30-minute, major address? Well, I could talk 30 minutes about Ron Clark, but I won't. Ron is one of our outstanding public servants in Texas. As I am sure you know, he is a member of the State legislature, but he also has a distinguished legal career. He has practiced law with a law firm in Sherman, Texas, and he is the author of a book The Texas Municipal Law and Procedure Manual, which is used by cities throughout Texas. Ron has been actively involved in his community, participating as committee chairman for the Boy Scouts of America and as president of the Sherman Kiwanis Club. He received the 2000 Political Involvement Award from the Sherman Chapter of the NAACP. He served in the Army as an Airborne Ranger. I will just say, Mr. Chairman, from my experience I have known Ron Clark for a long, long time, from before he was a member of the State legislature. He was an outstanding lawyer, recognized as such and board-certified in his field, in Texas, and I know he will be one of our outstanding Federal judges. Senator Durbin. Thank you, Senator Hutchison. I have no questions. Senator Hatch, do you? Senator Hatch. No. Senator Durbin. Your entire statement will be made part of the record, and thank you for your cooperation. Senator Hutchison. Thank you. Senator Durbin. Judge Raggi, as a mother, you are used to being interrupted and so I hope that you will understand that we are trying to move this along expeditiously. Judge Raggi. Of course. Senator Durbin. Now, we would certainly welcome your opening statement at this point. Judge Raggi. I don't have an opening statement, except to thank the committee for considering my nomination today. I would be happy to answer any questions that you might have for me. Senator Durbin. Let me start, then, and just go directly to questions of interest. Of course, you are seeking an appointment to one of the highest levels of the judiciary in the Federal court system, a lifetime appointment which involves more authority in reviewing decisions, as well as legislation, than many Federal judges-- Senator Clinton, please come forward. I will interrupt myself at this point. Stay right where you are, Judge Raggi, and please remain. Senator Clinton, we are doing expedited opening remarks. So we are happy to have you and we will put your entire statement in the record. PRESENTATION OF REENA RAGGI, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE SECOND DISTRICT BY HON. HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK Senator Clinton. Thank you so much, Senator Durbin and Senator Hatch. I am absolutely delighted to be here to support the nomination of a very distinguished judge who also has private practice experience. Among her many accomplishments, she is a graduate of Wellesley College, which I think above all else qualifies her for this very important position. Judge Raggi is, as you, I am sure, have determined from the record, someone who has acquitted herself admirably on the bench, has handled some very tough trials in New York, and has done so with a demeanor and a competence that is well-known to everyone who follows the courts in New York. I am just delighted to be here to introduce her to you. Senator Durbin. Thank you very much for that, and your entire statement will be made part of the record. We will watch the door to see who else is going to show up. Senator Hatch tells me he will keep an eye on the door. Judge Raggi, thank you for understanding. I hope you do understand-- Judge Raggi. Of course. Senator Durbin. --that this is the orderly method in the United States Senate. The point I was getting to and one I would like to ask your opinion on is this whole question of judicial activism and the responsibility of the court when it comes to legislation-- whether or not you serve as the so-called bulwark against legislative excess or feel that you play a different role. I would like to just leave that as an open-ended question to hear about your philosophy. Judge Raggi. Well, at both the district and circuit court level, what a judge has to do is decide cases, and so we don't, I don't think, get into broad policy questions the way you do in enacting legislation. We have to decide the dispute between the parties and if a statute comes into play in that, then we have to try to decide what Congress intended when it passed that statute. Senator Durbin. And that is it? Judge Raggi. Well, unless there is some concern that I am not appreciating, Senator. I mean, I have had cases where I have had to apply statutes sometimes that have not been on the books for a long time, and I do think some of my opinions show how I have tried to approach that by showing respect for Congress' legislation and what you all were trying to enact. I don't see my role as trying to put anything into the statute or taking anything away. Senator Durbin. Let me give an illustration. As we review your record, you have repeatedly turned away attempts to use the Constitution to strike down legislation, rejecting constitutional challenges to the Federal death penalty in U.S. v. Pitera, the Mail Order Drug Paraphernalia Act in U.S. v. Main Street Distributing, a Federal statute requiring the Secretary of State to extradite U.S. citizens even absent a treaty obligation in Hilario v. United States, and a New York City ordinance that criminalizes the possession or transfer of assault weapons and ammunition in the Richmond Boro Gun Club case. I guess what I am really coming to is under what circumstances would you rule that a Federal statute is unconstitutional? What kinds of standards and guidance are you looking for in making that decision? Judge Raggi. Well, it would very much depend what the challenge was. In many of the cases that you have just cited, I had rationality challenges, which is, of course, the lowest standard of review. If there was any rational basis between what Congress was trying to remedy or address and the statute passed, then it survives constitutional challenge. But, of course, there could be other kinds of challenges to statutes that would trigger stricter scrutiny. I don't think any of the cases that you cited involved stricter standards of scrutiny. Even the death penalty case was very much an ``as applied'' challenge. It was an attack on the particular criteria that Congress had enunciated for that statute. It wasn't a broad challenge on the death penalty, for instance. Senator Durbin. Let me stick with the Richmond Boro Gun Club case from another angle. You considered a challenge brought by gun owners and several gun groups to an assault weapons ban passed by the New York City Council. As a judge on the Second Circuit, directly below the Supreme Court, you will be called upon to decide a lot of hot-button issues, like the gun control case, with some frequency. In these high-profile cases, how can a judge insulate himself or herself from popular sentiment and try to reach the decision on the merits? Judge Raggi. Well, I think again by starting with the principle that you are deciding a discrete case. You are not legislating or writing a policy, law review article or anything like that. You are deciding a discrete case. And particularly where, as in a case like that, there are good briefs on both sides, you should be in a position to have the principled arguments of both sides and then try to apply the law. To use that case as the example for our discussion, I had to deal with statutes both at the Federal and local level. So I had to consider what those statutes said, what principles the legislatures, national and local, were trying to apply, and then try to reconcile them. Senator Durbin. Can you cite any examples from your career on the bench when you have faced similar public scrutiny over controversial decisions? Judge Raggi. Well, certainly, in dealing with the death penalty, because I did have one of the first five death penalty cases tried, brought by the Justice Department after new legislation. And I have recently been in a high-profile case. It doesn't involve a statutory question or a constitutional question, but it certainly attracts a lot of press in New York because it involved a question of police brutality. Senator Durbin. I thank you for that. I am going to at this point defer to Senator Hatch. But if you wouldn't mind, I believe our colleague, Senator Schumer, would like to make a statement on behalf of this nominee. PRESENTATION OF REENA RAGGI, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE SECOND DISTRICT BY HON. CHARLES SCHUMER, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK Senator Schumer. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I would like my entire statement to be read into the record. Senator Durbin. Without objection. Senator Schumer. I appreciate the courtesy, and I am happy to be here today to join Senator Clinton in introducing Judge Raggi, who has been nominated to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. I have long said I, at least for myself, have three standards when it comes to judicial nominees--legal excellence, moderation--I don't think judges should be too far left or too far right--and diversity. I am happy to say Judge Raggi meets all three of these qualifications. She was born in New Jersey--we won't hold that against her--went to college and law school in Massachusetts--we also can't hold that against you--and clerked on the Seventh Circuit. But she has been proud to call herself a New Yorker for the past 25 years. As you know, she has excellent private practice experience, being an associate and a partner at major New York law firms; significant public sector experience; was known as a top-notch prosecutor in the Eastern District, one of the premier districts in the country. She ran the narcotics section-- because the airports are in that district, narcotics is extremely important--and the special prosecutions section, before serving as interim U.S. Attorney. She has an extensive record before us, having served with distinction as a judge in the Eastern District. Mr. Chairman, in all frankness, we have seen a lot of nominees, in my judgment, who are ideologically way over come from this administration, but I can say with some confidence that Judge Raggi isn't one of them. So I am looking forward to the rest of her testimony and to supporting her confirmation in the weeks ahead. Senator Durbin. Thank you, Senator Schumer. Senator Hatch? Senator Hatch. Well, let me just say this, Judge Raggi. You have performed remarkably as a judge, admirably, dealing with some of the most difficult cases to face the Federal courts in New York, including the second trial of the former New York City police officer in the Abner Louema case, the first Federal death penalty case in New York in three decades, and the Golden Venture trials which rose out of the illegal smuggling of Chinese aliens, ten of whom died when their freighter ran aground off Rockaway, New York. In each case, you have met and surpassed the highest standard for judicial excellence and I think we are going to be very lucky to have you as a circuit court of appeals judge. Judge Raggi. Thank you. Senator Hatch. So I very strongly support you, and hopefully that is expedited enough. Senator Durbin. It certainly is. Senator Schumer has departed. May I ask one last question? Judge Raggi. Please. Senator Durbin. You have had a background on the bench, as Senator Hatch has noted, and prior to that a background as a Federal prosecutor. How would you respond to concerns about whether those who come before you representing criminal defendants will have fair treatment when you consider reviewing the decisions at the trial court level? Judge Raggi. I would hope that the 15 years of service I have had on the district court have answered that question for everyone. It was, of course, a question when I was first considered for the district court when my prosecutorial experience was pretty recent. But I think there is no doubt that I am prepared to see that justice is done for every party that appears before me, defense as well as prosecution. Now, because we have an excellent United States Attorney's office in the Eastern District, their cases are often very well presented and juries often do vote for convictions. But that is not my job anymore. My job is making sure every defendant gets a fair trial. If I were lucky enough to be confirmed to the court of appeals, my job would be to make sure that every litigant who raised a question before the court got a fair hearing on that. Senator Durbin. Well, I thank you very much. I have no further questions. I don't know if Senator Hatch does. Senator Hatch. I don't either. I am just happy to have you being willing to do this. Judge Raggi. Thank you so much, Senator. Senator Durbin. Judge Raggi, thank you for joining us. With the end of questioning, you are now free to go. We will leave the record open to allow committee members to submit written statements and any follow-up questions. Thank you for joining us today. Judge Raggi. Thank you. [The biographical information of Judge Raggi follows.] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.001 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.002 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.003 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.004 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.005 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.006 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.007 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.008 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.009 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.010 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.011 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.012 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.013 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.014 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.015 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.016 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.017 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.018 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.019 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.020 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.021 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.022 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.023 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.024 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.025 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.026 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.027 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.028 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.029 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.030 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.031 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.032 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.033 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.034 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.035 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 81116.036 Senator Durbin. At this time, I would ask the remaining three nominees to come forward to the table. That would be Lawrence Block, James Knoll Gardner, and Ronald Clark. If all three of you wouldn't mind standing for the oath and if you would raise your right hand, do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Judge Gardner. I do. Mr. Clark. I do. Mr. Block. I do. Senator Durbin. Thank you very much. The record will reflect that all three nominees answered in the affirmative. Before introducing them, I would like to defer to my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, if he has any opening statement. PRESENTATION OF JAMES K. GARDNER, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA BY HON. ARLEN SPECTER, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA Senator Specter. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am delighted to see this distinguished group of nominees here today. I would like to comment especially about a distinguished Pennsylvanian, Judge James Gardner, who comes to the nomination process with a very, very distinguished record. Judge Gardner is a graduate of Yale University, magna cum laude. He has his law degree from Harvard Law School. So he would take the comment of President Kennedy, who received an honorary degree from Yale and said he had the best of both worlds--a Yale degree and a Harvard education. Judge Gardner has the best of both worlds both ways, has a Yale degree and a Harvard degree and an education from both of the schools. He served in the Judge Advocate General Corps of the United States Navy Reserve. He served on active duty for three years. He has been an assistant district attorney and First Assistant District Attorney of Lehigh County from 1972 to 1981, and he has been a judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County, a very populace county in Pennsylvania--it has Allentown in it--and is President Judge at the present time. I have gotten to know Judge Gardner over the years and have seen his excellent work on the bench and his high character. He was recommended to Senator Santorum and myself by our bipartisan nominating committee, and he has been, of course, nominated by the President and gone through very rigorous examination and I think will make an outstanding jurist on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. So while I welcome all of the nominees here today, I give a special word of welcome to Judge James Knoll Gardner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Durbin. Thank you very much, Senator Specter. Let me begin with you, Judge Gardner, if I might. Would you like to introduce any of your family members or friends who have joined you today? STATEMENT OF JAMES KNOLL GARDNER, OF PENNSYLVANIA, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA Judge Gardner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to introduce my wife, Linda Gardner, and one of my daughters, Stephanie Gardner, who is junior in high school; my secretary of 25 years in law practice and on the bench, Cheryl Sinclair; my law clerk, Mike Daigle, a member of the Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York bars. My daughter, Victoria Gardner, can't be with us. She is in Spoleto, Italy, singing at an opera festival as we speak. She is a Senior at Yale University. My daughter, Andrea Merrill, is in Rochester, where she just bought a home with her husband, Paul, and is about to enter a doctorate degree program in piano at Eastman Music School. My daughter, Christine, and her husband, Christopher, and my granddaughter, 2-year-old Alexis, are at home in Allentown, where Christine is a social worker. I am very proud of my family and I am very proud of being here. Senator Durbin. Well, we are happy to have you here. It sounds like you have had a life with great musical accompaniment. At this point, would you like to make an opening statement? Judge Gardner. I don't have a formal opening statement, Mr. Chairman, other than to thank you all for affording me and my colleagues today the opportunity for this hearing. And I am willing, of course, to answer any questions you may have. Senator Durbin. Thank you very much. Let me at this point make the same offer to Ron Clark, from Texas, if you would be kind enough to introduce family and friends who have joined you today, and then you have an opportunity for your own opening statement. STATEMENT OF RONALD H. CLARK, OF TEXAS, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS Mr. Clark. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to introduce my mother, Catherine Clark, from Green Valley, Arizona, where she serves on the elected board there, and my aunt, Julia Plotnick, from New Jersey, recently retired as an admiral from the Public Health Service; also, my brother-in- law, Colonel John Long, stationed at the Pentagon right now, and his son, my nephew, William Long, who attends school in Annandale. I would like to thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Senator Hatch and, of course, the staff members, for affording us this opportunity to be here, as you say, just before you adjourn. I understand the pressure to adjourn. Senator Durbin. Thank you very much. Do you have an opening statement that you would like to make? Mr. Clark. I think I just made it, Mr. Chairman. Senator Durbin. Perhaps I would allow Senator Hatch to introduce the next nominee. PRESENTATION OF LAWRENCE J. BLOCK, NOMINEE TO BE JUDGE FOR THE UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS BY HON. ORRIN G. HATCH, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF UTAH Senator Hatch. Well, I am not going to take a lot time, but Larry Block has served this committee very well. I am very proud to have had him for all these years working so hard. He has been a major counsel on this committee for a long time and has worked with all of us. We all know him. He has an excellent academic record, an excellent record in working in Government and, of course, has an excellent record around here. So we are just pleased to have you nominated and finally have this hearing, Larry. I will put the rest of my remarks in the record. Senator Durbin. Thank you, Senator Hatch. Mr. Block, you couldn't have a stronger friend than Senator Hatch. I can say that because my arm is still hurting from being twisted to move quickly; let's get this moving. We are today, and we are happy to, and at this point invite you to introduce family and friends and make an opening statement. STATEMENT OF LAWRENCE J. BLOCK, OF VIRGINIA, NOMINEE TO BE JUDGE FOR THE UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS Mr. Block. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It was my great hope to have my mother, Eve Silver, here. My mother is a refugee from Nazi Germany and she came here to this great country in 1938. Unfortunately, she was just too ill to come down here. My brother, Lee Syrkin, is a cardiologist in North Carolina, and unfortunately his patients demand his attention today. My sister, Lynn Zymet, Jersey, in the New York area, could not be here today. But I am not without family because I have my Senate family here, and friends I would like to introduce. I asked Trish Knight to sit behind me. She was behind me. She still is. Good. She represents the Hatch family and she represents all my friends here. I had the opportunity to work a little bit in the Reagan, Bush 1 and Clinton administrations. I have friends these administration and Bush 2 here, and I want to thank all the staffers, Democrat and Republican, whom I have worked with over the last nine years. So that is my surrogate family. Senator Durbin. Thank you, and would you like to make any statement beyond that? Mr. Block. I would love to thank the committee and the chairman for scheduling this hearing and for you chairing it. Above all, I would like to thank Senator Hatch, who over the past about nine years has been a mentor and a friend, and has shown me that integrity and honesty and love is very important in public life. Senator Durbin. Thank you very much. Since we are considering nominees for the Federal district court as well as the Court of Federal Claims, perhaps the questioning will be a little different for the nominees, but I would like to start, if I could, with Judge Gardner and Representative Clark and a question relative to an issue which is in the headlines constantly. It is the issue of equal justice in this country, particularly the issue of racial profiling, and concerns that have been expressed both in this committee as well as in the media about whether our system of justice is indeed fair and color-blind in terms of the administration of justice. The statistics are sobering concerning the incarceration of people of color in our Nation. For example, it is, I think, well known and established that when it comes to the African American population, it represents about 12 percent of our population and according to Federal statistics about 11 percent of current drug users, and yet 35 percent of those arrested for drug violations are African American. Fifty-three percent of those convicted for drug felonies are African American, and 58 percent of those currently incarcerated in State prisons for drug felons are African American--by most measures, a disproportionate share of those who are being punished from those who are actually thought to have violated the law. In administering justice in this country, we have to maintain the belief, the honest, sincere and real belief, that this system is fair. Tell me, as judges considering this situation, what you believe is your responsibility in the administration of justice to make certain that it is fair for all groups in this country, regardless of color, creed, or ethnic origin. Judge Gardner? Judge Gardner. Well, I think you have said it, Mr. Chairman. My responsibility as a judge is to treat everyone who comes into my courtroom, regardless of station in life, regardless of race, color, creed, national origin, gender, sexual preference, equally, on a level playing field. I pride myself that in 21 years as a trial judge, and in some 8 or 9 years as a military court martial judge and a military appeals judge, that I have done that. And that hasn't been difficult for me to do; that comes naturally for me. And in terms of the concerns that you mention, if the statistics are not in conformity to the population percentages of a particular group, then, of course, we have to look at it to make sure that this is not representing some inappropriate arresting, selective prosecuting, or some kind of bias in sentencing, and that it isn't explained by other factors such as more people being arrested legitimately for those crimes. But either way, the job of the judge is to deal fairly and even-handedly with everyone. Senator Durbin. My State statistics are even worse than those of your state of Pennsylvania, but there was a recent report that the rate of incarceration of African Americans in Pennsylvania is 14 times that of white Americans. What do you think we should do affirmatively to convince African Americans and other people of color that this system is not profiling, that this system is, in fact, color-blind? Judge Gardner. Lead by example, state openly that we abhor any kind of discrimination in any level of society, including the judicial and legal profession, and walk the walk and talk the talk. Senator Durbin. Mr. Clark, would you comment on the same questions? Mr. Clark. I think it is very important that we not only have a system that is just and fair, but it has to be perceived to be just and fair. And you are exactly right. There is a large portion of our population that right now does not perceive it that way. I know that in my district and I know that in my area that there is a perception among many African Americans that the system is not fair to them, and I think a judge has a responsibility to work to do that. At a political level, you can try to single out any prosecutor, elected prosecutors, who are not being fair and try to eliminate them through the electoral process. As a judge, you have the opportunity to, if you will, make sure that the person you perceive as being disadvantaged has the scales tilted to level that playing field for them. Senator Durbin. One of the areas that comes up frequently is the question of competent counsel when it comes to the defense of those charged with crimes. It has been dramatized in this committee particularly in our debate over the death penalty. Certainly, we can understand that in capital cases competent counsel should be sitting at both tables in the courtroom. But clearly there are many people who may not be sentenced to life imprisonment or face a death penalty who may still spend a huge number of years in jail because of the incompetency of counsel. What obligation do you feel that we have as a Nation when it comes to holding our system to the standard of establishing that competent counsel will be present in the courtroom? Mr. Clark. Well, I think both legislatively and judicially you ought to be sure that the people being appointed especially on major cases, but even on some of the minor ones, are competent. We recently passed a statute in Texas to try to ensure that only people with death penalty experience got appointed to death penalty cases, and then they could have an assistant who perhaps had not previously tried a death penalty case. That would be a way for that person to get experience and it would give the older attorney someone to help. Many of our local judges have had that procedure for years before that statute was in. At least in my area they did, and I think that is an important thing. I have prosecuted criminal cases and I have defended criminal cases and I am aware of the imbalance of power between the prosecution and defense, and I have always felt it needs to be leveled out. Senator Durbin. Let me ask you this, Judge Gardner, on a related issue about mandatory minimum sentencing. I can tell you as a person who served in the House and the Senate on Capitol Hill, and I am sure those in State legislatures can affirm it is a popular vote to establish mandatory minimum sentences for certain crimes, to basically say that the judge won't have discretion, will not have flexibility when it comes to sentencing. I think we are learning that we have gone too far in some areas. I have visited Federal prisons in my own State, particularly penitentiaries for women, where you see people spending an inordinate amount of the rest of their lives in these prison situations. And as you hear about the cases, it appears that their devotion to a boyfriend, who was not a particularly good individual, ended up being repaid by the boyfriend ratting them out and subjecting them to mandatory minimum sentences on drug crimes. That is happening more and more frequently. What is your theory or philosophy when it comes to mandatory minimum sentencing? Judge Gardner. Well, as a trial judge, of course, it is necessary and appropriate for me to follow the sentence guidelines and to apply the mandatory sentences. I have no choice. It is the legislature's duty to set those policies and it is my duty to carry them out, whether I agree with them or not. Most trial judges will tell you, and I am no exception, that anything that takes away sentencing discretion from the judges in that scenario is not necessarily a good thing. But it is also appropriate that we don't have sentencing all over the lot, and so to have certain standards and guidelines is helpful to even out appropriate punishments for appropriate crimes so that there aren't inconsistent results, on the one hand, and on the other hand to avoid sentences that are either too harsh or too lenient for the circumstances. Having said that, we can disagree with individual minimums or individual guidelines, but it is a tradeoff. If you are going to ask for tougher sentences, then you are going to need more prisons to put these people in, and they may or may not be appropriate for long terms in prison. Senator Durbin. Thank you. Mr. Clark, would you respond to that same question? Mr. Clark. Mr. Chairman, I think you are exactly right. It is always an easy vote going in for law and order in a legislature. But, of course, I think we need to look at the original purpose, and it was to avoid that appearance of the rich white kid getting off easy and the poor black kid getting a heavy sentence. And if you have mandatory sentencing, you get away from that. I have been told that in some of the--I don't do a lot of criminal work now, but I have been told in some of the counties where we have elected judges that that kind of thing can happen. So the minimum mandatory sentencing of the Federal system has much to be said for it, and since it is legislatively decided, I understand that as a judge I will apply it. Senator Durbin. Thank you. Senator Hatch? Senator Hatch. I am satisfied. I have the read the history of all three of these gentlemen. I just want to congratulate each of you for the excellent lives that you have lived, the law that you have practiced, in your case the work that you have done on the court, and, of course, in Larry's case the work he has done on this committee. We are just very proud of you and pleased to be able to support you. Senator Durbin. Thank you, Senator Hatch. Senator Sessions, do you have some questions of the panel? PRESENTATION OF LAWRENCE J. BLOCK, NOMINEE TO BE JUDGE FOR UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS BY HON. JEFF SESSIONS, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE ALABAMA Senator Sessions. Well, Mr. Chairman, I would just say likewise this is a distinguished panel, each with a fine record, and I am delighted to support each of them. I must say that I do know Lawrence Block. He has been a tremendous asset to Senator Hatch and this committee for quite a number of years. He has had a distinguished career as a lawyer. He is respected by all of us here. In fact, I can't think of anyone more respected who has worked around here during the time he has been here. I think he has the temperament and judgment and integrity to be a really terrific judge. I am delighted to see him be nominated. We wish you the best of luck, Larry, and each of you, also. Mr. Block. Thank you, Senator. Senator Durbin. Thank you, Senator Sessions. If I might, then, I would like to ask Mr. Block a few questions because there is an area of concern here expressed by many groups relative to the responsibility of the Court of Claims, and it particularly relates to the issue of takings and some of the statements you have made and perhaps some of the things that you have written on this issue. I was surprised to learn that a variety of different environmental groups have written concerning your nomination, expressing concern about your reading of the so-called Takings Clause. As you know, the Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over claims of $10,000 or more against the United States under the Takings Clause, and I would like to explore for a moment for the record your opinion about this particular issue. Let me ask you, in the 1993 Concrete Pipe case the Supreme Court unanimously stated, and I quote, ``Our cases have long established that mere diminution in the value of property, however serious, is insufficient to demonstrate a taking.'' They were dealing with a case that had significant diminution. They refer to two particular cases. One was a 75-percent diminution in value, another a 92.5-percent diminution. Do you interpret that language, which cited zoning and land use cases, as the holding that would guide you in terms of your work on the Court of Claims? Mr. Block. Yes, I do, Senator. The Supreme Court has adopted a balancing test to determine--we are talking about regulatory takings here, not eminent domain cases--in terms of regulatory cases, and that is the Penn Central case of 1978. The Penn Central case has adopted a three-part test to determine what is a taking. The other exception to that is the Lucas case, which says basically if virtually all value of property is taken by government, that is considered a taking. Other than that, the Court has used the balancing test to determine what is a taking, and it is a balancing test balancing three factors. The problem with regulatory takings really started with a Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes case back in 1922, and he wrote that a mere diminution of value is not a taking. If it was, then government could hardly regulate. But somewhere along this continuum, he wrote, if the government goes too far, then it is considered a taking, and primarily the Supreme Court has adopted that balancing test to determine how far is too far. So, yes, the answer is I would follow that. Senator Durbin. Can you cite any Supreme Court opinion that has held that a mere diminution in value of an affected portion of property, however serious, is sufficient to demonstrate a taking, without consideration of investment-backed expectation and other factors? Mr. Block. No, I cannot. Senator Durbin. Do you agree that takings legislation that would have entitled property owners to compensation merely by showing that an agency action diminished the value of an affected portion of property by a certain percentage, without consideration of investment-backed expectations and other factors--do you agree that that would be violative, then, of court precedent? Mr. Block. I understand you are referring to both the House and the Senate takings legislation which I had the honor of working on. Let me say two things. The Senate and House bills were not law then and they are not law now. My role as a staffer is to zealously advocate the position of Senator Hatch and the Senators who worked on that bill. It is much akin to being an attorney when you zealously advocate the position of your client, but that is not the law and it is far different than being a judge. Those bills were designed to change the law and didn't represent the law then, and they were not enacted into law and they do not represent the law now. Senator Durbin. Well, as my staff would not like to be held accountable for my peculiar legislative views, I am sure that Senator Hatch understands that you may not want to be held accountable for his insights into the law as we know it today. Senator Hatch. I feel confident in that statement. Mr. Block. That was a good-faith attempt to change the law. Senator Durbin. But the point I want to make clear for the record is that was a controversial bill that really would have expanded the concept of takings by the Government. You are asking for appointment to a court that will be considering issues relative to takings by regulation, and there is a concern by groups that you will use the standards espoused in that bill as your standard in applying the law. Mr. Block. Let me assure the committee of this: Those bills tried to put in concrete terms what a so-called partial taking was. And there were two Senate bills. One defined it by 33 percent and the other by 50 percent, so there was a concrete, bright line test of what a partial taking was. That does not exist in the law then and it does not exist in the law now. Senator Durbin. And for the record, your passionate advocacy for that law and that change in the law does not reflect--or let me not put words in your mouth. Does it reflect your view on the standard that you would apply as a judge on the Court of Claims? Mr. Block. It does not reflect the standard that I would apply because the Supreme Court has basically adopted a balancing test and has eschewed bright line tests. Senator Durbin. Let me ask you about your courtroom experience. Can you for the record tell the committee the experience that you have had to prepare yourself for this appointment? Mr. Block. Oh, yes, thank you. I had the opportunity to work in basically all three branches of Government, so I know the difference between being an advocate and working in the judicial branch. I was a law clerk in the Federal court for Judge Miner. I served as an associate in Skadden Arps, in New York City, where I had primarily a motion practice. I joined the Department of Justice in 1986. I worked in the commercial litigation branch and appeared in front of the Court of Federal Claims, then worked in OLP. I joined the Department of Energy and worked on environmental and energy law, and I worked on this committee and we handled all sorts of legal issues. So I am familiar with the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims. Of course, as a committee staffer, I helped prepare hearings, some of which the Senator knows involved very complex issues of law. Senator Durbin. The last area I would like to ask you about is relative to an article that you wrote, I guess, 12 years ago in a Heritage Foundation publication and it related to the 14th Amendment. You coauthored an article which said, and I quote, ``It is distressing that many Americans, including most members of the bench and bar, look to the Bill of Rights and the 14th Amendment as the principal protection of individual rights, while overlooking the all-important safeguards contained in the structure of the Constitution itself,'' end of quote. Given our Nation's historical legacy, I find your expression of distress about the prominent role of the 14th Amendment to be worrisome. Until the passage of the 14th Amendment, most African Americans were denied the right to vote and were counted as three-fifths of a person for apportionment purposes. The 14th Amendment reversed the Supreme Court's infamous Dred Scott decision and the 14th Amendment guaranteed equal protection of the laws. I would like you now for the record to tell this committee your impression or your views about the role of the 14th Amendment and whether that quote from the article fairly characterizes your point of view. Mr. Block. Chairman Durbin, I agree with you a hundred percent about the importance of the 14th Amendment. We had a great Civil War, a bloody Civil War in this country. The 14th Amendment was promulgated in response to the Civil War to give people of African American descent equal rights in this country. I firmly believe in equal justice under the law and the jurisprudence under the 14th Amendment. The article was written in the bicentennial celebration of the Bill of Rights, which was promulgated in 1791, I believe, finally passed by the States. And that article is really an article about political philosophy and it said sometimes Americans forget that the Framers intended that the primary-- and maybe not even the most important, but one of the great protections that we have of our liberties is the structure of the Constitution. The Constitution protects liberty in various ways and one of the most important ways is the role that this body has elected representatives. They represent people in this country and they represent laws and they pass civil rights bills, like the great civil rights acts of 1871 and the civil rights acts of the 20th century. So the role that the structure of the Constitution has-- separation of powers, checks and balances, limited government, enumerated powers that Congress has, a strong executive, the power of the veto--the Constitution works as a machine and the result of that machine is to protect individual liberties from intrusive government. I in no way denigrate in that article the role of courts. All I meant was in that article is that there are other protections that Americans have and we sometimes forget the role the Constitution and the political process plays in protecting our liberties. Senator Durbin. Thank you. I have one last question, if it is all right, of Mr. Block and it goes back to an earlier issue. I understand that in your answers to the questionnaire that you submitted to this Committee, you characterized this takings legislation that we were discussing earlier as codifying and enforcing the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. As I understood your response, it was somewhat different. Earlier, you stated that this would have been a new standard, a new approach, other than currently existing in law. By your response to that questionnaire, I would ask you to explain that response and your earlier response to my question. Mr. Block. I really appreciate the opportunity to clarify what I wrote there, and I really apologize to the committee for any confusion that might be created. When I use the term ``codify''--first, I was responsible for legislative projects. I want to reveal everything to be forthcoming to the committee on what I worked on. Or course, takings legislation, which is certainly a hot-button issue, is something I revealed. When I wrote that it codified standards, we are actually talking about two separate types of bills. One is the bill that you referred to before, and that is the compensation bill which established partial takings. Another bill that I also worked on was a ripeness bill which tried to grant access from State litigation to Federal courts on the ripeness issues, and that is when can you go to Federal court, especially if you arise from State cases. And there were many Senators who felt that it was very difficult to get into Federal court. The bill contained standards of defining what ripeness is, and when I wrote in my questionnaire, I wrote that what I worked--that bill I characterized as containing standards, codifying standards. I think that was the term I used, ``codifying standards.'' I didn't say whether they codified former Supreme Court standards or present standards. I didn't write whether they were good or bad standards. All I said was they literally codified standards, and I thought I was being very accurate. Senator Durbin. If you would be kind enough--and in fairness to you, I would like to give you a chance to send us an amendment, then, to your questionnaire and express what you have just said to the committee-- Mr. Block. Certainly. Senator Durbin. --and give you a little time to put this in words so that we can appreciate exactly the distinction you were trying to make. There may be other questions that could be submitted. Obviously, having worked here, you know how that works. Mr. Block. Oh, I sure do. Senator Durbin. Thank you very much. Senator Hatch? Senator Hatch. I just want to thank all three of you for being willing to serve, and Judge Raggi as well, and I believe you will be very excellent judges, without question. Larry, we are very proud of you. We are looking forward to seeing you serve with great distinction down there and we expect you, all of us on this committee, to do a very good job. Mr. Block. Thank you, Senator. Senator Durbin. Senator Specter? Senator Specter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Block, the analysis that you have made of the Constitution and the balance and the inner workings--and you mentioned separation of powers--it is a marvelous document, beyond any question, especially with the doctrine of separation of powers, even though separation of powers was never mentioned. I think that when Senator Durbin has gone into the issues of the 14th Amendment, that has been really a critical part of the Constitution for many, many years. This committee is now considering DNA legislation which would make it a constitutional right to have access to DNA information. But when you consider treatment of defendants by the States, especially the Southern States, Mississippi, in Brown v. Mississippi, it took a long time to bring some Federal limitation on State court abuses. And it wasn't only Mississippi, in Brown v. Mississippi. It was Pennsylvania in the Treetop Turner case and many other cases. So it has been an interesting comment. They have just started a vote, so it may be too late to be brief at this point, but I am going to be brief from this point on. Thank you for being willing to serve. The Federal judiciary is the backbone of the American democratic system, and with the life tenure which you have you are in a position to undertake decisions which may be unpopular which the Congress doesn't have the courage to do, nor does the executive branch so frequently. I want to repeat a colloquy that Senator Thurmond had as chairman of this committee shortly after I joined the committee after the 1980 election. There was a nominee seated where you men are and Senator Thurmond said, if confirmed, do you promise to be courteous? And I thought to myself, what kind of a question is that? What does he expect the nominee to say? And not unexpectedly the nominee said, yes, I promise to be courteous. And then Senator Thurmond said the more power a person has, the more courteous the person should be. He said it in a much more charming dialect, but the more power a person has, the more courteous the person should be. I have spent a lot of time behind this dais in the last 22 years and a long time in the Senate, and I have not heard anything nearly as erudite as that. There is a temptation, once you put on that black robe with a lifetime appointment, to sometimes forget that when--and I know this will never happen in any of your courtrooms--a lawyer is not prepared or his not coherent, or witnesses or not responsive, or you have had a bad day and it is a bad process. Whenever Senator Thurmond is not here, I give his little speech, and I have talked to many judges years after confirmation who repeat that speech to me. But I am sorry to say that I have also heard many cases where judges whom I have recommended have not followed that process. So I just wanted to be as emphatic as I could. Be courteous. You have a lot of power as a Federal judge, and a lifetime appointment really insulates you from everything. But just remember what Senator Thurmond said: the more power a person has, the more courteous the person should be. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Durbin. Thank you, Senator Specter. Senator Sessions, do you have any further questions? Senator Sessions. No. Senator Durbin. We are in a roll call and my colleagues may have to leave. I understand if they do, and I understand Senator Schumer may be on the way. Well, we will see if he can make it. Let me ask, if I can, to Mr. Clark, as a member of the Texas Legislature you supported in 1999 the establishment of the Texas Parental Notification Act, which generally requires parental notification before minors can receive an abortion. The legislation includes a procedure for so-called judicial bypass, where a minor can avoid parental notification by petitioning a court. One of the factors the court should consider, according to the language of the statute, is whether the notification would not be in the minor's best interest. In March of 2000, you were in a group of Texas legislators who signed an amicus brief in support of an interpretation of that Act. In part, the brief argued that a court must determine not just that notification is not in the minor's best interest, but that the abortion procedure itself is in the minor's best interest. As you know, a majority of the Texas Supreme Court rejected the position on this amicus brief. The court concluded the legislature did not impose this additional requirement that an abortion itself, the procedure, be in the minor's best interest. Can you explain to me how, having voted for the bill with the language in it the Texas Supreme Court said was clear, you would return to that court in a very short period of time and argue that it really wasn't about notification being in the minor's best interest, but the abortion procedure itself? Mr. Clark. Well, Mr. Chairman, at the time that brief was submitted--and I was not the attorney on it, but I was one of the legislators who agreed to be an amicus. I think 5 opinions had come out shortly after the law was passed, or 5 decisions, with something like 19 different opinions. And unfortunately, while I think we thought we had written something pretty clearly, it was pretty evident from the dispute going on in the supreme court that maybe we had not passed a bill that was quite as clear as it might have been. I have had appellate judges raise that to me before in oral argument. When you have 19 different opinions coming out, obviously something is not as clear as it could be. The supreme court did finally in 2000 come down with its final opinion, a majority decision, and since that time we have had very few appeals. We had another session of the legislature and no one brought another bill to amend the statute to somehow overturn or modify the supreme court's decision. I don't even remember any serious discussion about that happening. So I think it was pretty well agreed that the supreme court has finally made a decision. The trial courts know what they are supposed to be doing and the trial courts can now move forward and the issue is basically settled. There was a lot of dissent going on at the time, and that is one of the reasons that a number of the legislators thought, well, maybe we need to--and legislators probably shouldn't be trying to help the court out, but that, I think, was what was happening there. Senator Durbin. I think that is what leads to the question. It is not uncommon for a citizen or his or her attorney to go into court and question what a provision in the statute really means. It is an odd situation when the very legislator who wrote the statute, or voted for the statute, would come to the court and say that isn't what we meant at all; we didn't mean that the notification was in the best interest, we meant that the procedure was in the best interest. Well, the court rejected that, so you were in an unusual position trying to amend your statute in court, which raises a question whether you, as a judge, will be amending statutes in court. Mr. Clark. Actually, having been a legislator, I take it very personally when judges try to amend statutes. I, probably more than most candidates, really understand what goes on in committee, Mr. Chairman, and I know that no judge can have the kind of input that comes through the committee process, all of the stakeholders, all of the interest groups, all of the lobbyists coming in, everybody who puts in. And you have a group, a committee from 9 to 21, depending on the body you are in. You then have the process that it has gone through both houses of the legislature. There is no way a judge can have that kind of information. So I believe very strongly that unless a statute is clearly unconstitutional, clearly is working some kind of unfairness, that you basically apply it as written. That is the legislative decision. This was an odd case, and at the time we thought we had written something fairly clear. These are very intelligent people on the supreme court. I have the greatest respect for all of them. It obviously wasn't as clear as we thought. I have seen that happen before in other statutes, but they did finally come up with a decision. I respect the debate they had, but once they made that decision, we have had very few appeals. And like I say, in the following session I don't recall anybody bringing a bill or even seriously talking about a bill to overturn them or change what their decision was. Senator Durbin. Thank you very much. I am going to now turn to Senator Schumer and ask him, first, have you voted? Senator Schumer. Not yet. Senator Durbin. Well, we have about six or seven minutes, so that is good news for the panel. So if you would like to proceed with your questions. Senator Schumer. Thank you. I have a number of questions in writing, but I just wanted to ask Mr. Block a couple of questions on the issue of judicial activism, which I know is an important issue here. In your Judiciary Committee questionnaire you wrote that, quote, ``Judicial activism--that is, policymaking by judges--is an unfortunate product of the 20th century.'' That is your quote. Elsewhere, you have written that such cases as Brown v. Board of Education and Reynolds v. Sims, the historic Supreme Court case clarifying the one man, one vote principle, are examples of social engineering by the courts. The last one is sort of impossible to understand because if the courts didn't do it, who would, since you would have a self-perpetuating legislature that didn't have one man, one vote? But aside from that, Dred Scott was decided in 1857. As you know, the Court in that case reached out and overturned the Missouri Compromise regarding slavery on the grounds that the law deprived a slave owner of his property without due process of law, notwithstanding Congress' express power to determine matters of citizenship. Plessy v. Ferguson is another 19th century case. The Court there reached out and made up the notion of ``separate but equal.'' They said that that is constitutional, notwithstanding the express provisions of the 14th Amendment. So it strikes me as sort of odd that you have pointed to progressive landmark civil rights cases as examples of judicial activism and ignored regressive, some would say backward--I think most would say backward anti-civil rights cases. Those are not mentioned as activism. So the first question I have--and I will let you do both at once, since we are under time pressure, and then I would ask for elaboration in writing. Can you explain your thinking here? I want to know whether you consider Plessy and Dred Scott to also be examples of judicial activism the way you consider Brown v. Board. The next question is this: I am sort of struggling to reconcile your contention that judicial activism is a creation of the 20th century, when we have all those 19th century cases that seem to me to be every bit as ``activist'' as your examples. Brown v. Board, in my mind, is one of the three or four most important cases the Court has ever rendered. Yet, you cite it as an example of social engineering and judicial activism. Are you saying that the Court in Plessy was right when it held that separate but equal is justified by the Constitution? Are you saying that Brown v. Board was wrong when the whole Court held that separate but equal was not equal at all? There are several cases from this century that one can look at and say they constitute judicial activism that might not go along with your ideological views, but seem to me to be activist, breaking new ground. One is Brancala, the VAWA case. I would put that one high up on the list. Since the mid-1990s, we have seen a whole bunch of cases that seem to me to look like conservative judicial activism. This body knows very well that I don't like so-called activism from the right or the left, although we might have different definitions of that term. Can you tell me, for instance, what cases, if any--the first question I have is the Brown v. Board case. The second is what cases, if any, from the Rehnquist you would characterize as examples of judicial activism. Mr. Block. Okay, thank you. Senator Schumer, the references to Brown and the Warren Court precedents came from a blue booklet called ``Plurality Decisions,'' which is sort of a tongue-twister sometimes to say it fast. I believe that was written in 1988. It was prepared, not exactly written by me. It was prepared for the Office of Legal Policy, Department of Justice, at the end of the Reagan administration. It was a work that was a collaborative effort. I was the main researcher; I was the main writer of that. And my main contribution, for which I won an award, was an analysis of plurality decisions. On that footnote-- Senator Schumer. The Brown footnote? Mr. Block. The Brown footnote. I will say this: At that time and now, I disagree with that footnote, my personal opinion. Senator Schumer. But you put your name as one of the-- Mr. Block. Well, my name is not on there. It is not on there. I was a preparer. I had to write in my judicial--what did you write on? What did you author? What did you prepare? I prepared that for the Department of Justice. It was a collaborative effort. But I will say this: I disagree with that footnote completely. I believe in equal protection under the law. I believe that people of race, national origin, and different creeds ought to have equal protection of the law and I just disagree with that footnote. Senator Schumer. Okay. Mr. Block. Number one. Number two-- Senator Schumer. How about Reynolds v. Sims, same thing? Mr. Block. Same thing. Number two-- Senator Schumer. Was that in the same footnote? Mr. Block. That was in the same footnote. All those were in the same footnote. The term ``social engineering'' now, if I can explain further, is a most unfortunate use. Senator Schumer. It sure was. Mr. Block. It was written in a different context, if I can go back to plurality decisions and explain that. The main criticism of plurality decisions of the Court--and as you know, that is decisions where there is no majority opinion of the Supreme Court--is that it doesn't stand for a proposition of law. There is no clear-cut decision, and therefore the Court is reneging on its social guidance function. And that article criticized that and said actually plurality decisions may be a good thing because it helps develop the law. And my conclusion doing the research, by the way--it was not because a lot of conservatives criticized the Court for use of substantive due process, which is I think what you are getting at--judicial activism. But my conclusion was not that it was a result of substant"
