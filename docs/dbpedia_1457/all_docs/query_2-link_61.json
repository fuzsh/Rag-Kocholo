        "text": "Among the four Greater Fall River House members — all Democrats — three that were reached for comment shortly after the news broke varied in assessing the situation.\n\n\"This is a Senate issue and not a House issue, but it does erode the public trust,\" said Rep. Carole Fiole of Fall River, offering the most candid comments.\n\n\"It's extremely disturbing. It's a sad day day,\" Fiola said.\n\nFive months after Se. Stan Rosenberg stepped down from the presidency over allegations made against his husband, the Senate Ethics Committee released a detailed, 77-page report concluding that while Rosenberg may not have violated any formal rules, his failure to intervene with his husband Bryon Hefner had “destructive consequences” for the Senate.\n\nFiola said Rosenberg's constituents would likely show how they want him to proceed in the coming months when asked if Rosenberg should resign.\n\nFiola said she commended Rodrigues as chair of the Senate Ethics Committee for \"leading the work the committee did.\" She called that investigation \"transparent.\"\n\nWestport Rep. Paul Schmid said, \"At this point I don't know all the facts and I think it would be a disservice to express an opinion.\"\n\nSchmid expressed confidence in the Senate to \"do the right thing\" with the recommendations from the committee.\n\nHe gave a positive stance that \"I just feel very good about the process because I know Sen. Rodrigues, as chair of the Ethics Committee, is as straight a shooter as you would find,\" Schmid said of his fellow Westport legislator.\n\nSomerset Rep. Patricia Haddad basically deferred from commenting. \"I think that's best left to the senators. It's their issue,\" Haddad said.\n\nStating that she had seen Baker and Healey had called for Rosenberg's resignation, Haddad said, \"I don't want to pile on.\"\n\nState Rep. Alan Silvia of Fall River did not immediately return a call for comment."
