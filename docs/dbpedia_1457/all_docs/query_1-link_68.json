        "text": "Former Senate President Stanley C. Rosenberg, who a month ago worked out of an ornate, third-floor State House suite, has resettled in a basement office amid an ongoing ethics probe.\n\nRosenberg and four staffers now inhabit his new, nondescript digs in Room 70 of the State House’s east wing, which lacked a formal nameplate when a Herald reporter visited yesterday.\n\nRosenberg’s modest suite — tucked next to the balcony of the Gardner Auditorium, the Senate’s own temporary chamber — has served in the past as a temporary space for new senators awaiting an official office assignment.\n\n“This is a standard temporary office for a senator,” said Mara Dolan, a Rosenberg spokeswoman. “There’s nothing unusual about this.”\n\nThe Amherst Democrat stepped down from the Senate presidency Dec. 4 after The Boston Globe published allegations that his husband, Bryon Hefner, sexually assaulted or harassed four men while bragging about his influence over Senate business.\n\nRosenberg is now the focus of a Senate ethics probe into whether he violated any rules after earlier promising a “firewall” between his office and Hefner. It’s unclear how long the investigation, led by the firm Hogan Lovells, will take.\n\nActing Senate President Harriette Chandler was elected to lead the body, and staffers are still working in both the Senate President’s third-floor office and space reserved on the fourth floor for other president aides.\n\nBut it was an open question about where Rosenberg would land in the State House. Initially, Dolan declined yesterday to tell the Herald where his office would be, citing a Senate policy that only Chandler’s office could reveal that detail.\n\nThe Herald ultimately found the office shortly before Chandler’s office confirmed its location, discovering it through a door simply marked “Senate” that houses other offices, including the “Legislative Education Office,” according to a sign.\n\nMeanwhile, as Rosenberg relocated with his staff, Chandler has moved to fortify hers. Scott Zoback, a former communications director at the Department of Public Health, has joined the Senate President’s office as a deputy chief of staff, handling communications and strategy.\n\nZoback, who said he’ll make $85,000 a year in the role, will handle duties that once fell to Dolan, who remained on Rosenberg’s personal staff, and Pete Wilson, Rosenberg’s former press secretary who has since left the Senate."
