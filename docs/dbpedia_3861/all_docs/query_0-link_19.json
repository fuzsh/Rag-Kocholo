        "text": "A recent shift in the Government of Indonesia’s foreign policy outlook has witnessed emerging interests towards the untapped potential of Indonesians abroad. However, academic research on the Indonesian Diaspora remains scant, and at its current stage, the literature suffers from a lack of synergy across the many disciplinary fields. The Indonesia Diaspora Network–Research and Development Discussion Paper Series aim to provide a collection of empirical insights pertinent for any scholarly discussion and future data-driven policy initiatives on the Indonesian Diaspora. We\n\nThis paper argues that the term of the diaspora in Indonesia has been transformed and simplified from the general diaspora concept and its conceptual meaning is not enough to define the Indonesian diaspora. The Indonesian government have already made a clear characteristic of Indonesian diaspora through the Presidential Regulation No. 76 of 2017, it is stated implicitly that Indonesian diaspora is whoever living abroad, despite they only live there for a short period. Regardless of what the Indonesian government has done to define the meaning of the diaspora, thedefinition is not enough to explain about Indonesian diaspora. By any conditions, the Indonesian government could not neglect the history of some Indonesian political refugees in 1965 or 1998 since there was a painful history left behind and it is unsure whether they want to recognize themselves again as Indonesia. On the other hand, the second generation or more of Indonesian who already got another country citizenship, can...\n\nThis article aims to explain the movement of Indonesian diaspora and their initiative to create multifarious new activities in today�s globalized era. Focusing on Indonesian diaspora organizations in Europe, namely Indonesian Diaspora Networks (IDN) in the Netherlands and France who are eager to come together, build organizations based on a common identity, and contribute to Indonesia. The newly-emerged concept of hometown transnationalism is used to explain the phenomenon in which collective remittances through development projects are the main output of diasporas� contribution. Qualitative method is applied to this study through a set of in-depth interviews, a study of life history, and literature review completed by site visits to observe diasporas� works. The results of this study show that the emergence of various diaspora organizations is the impact of the increasingly rapid movement of people and technological developments, thus encouraging the diaspora to be more connected t...\n\nThis Working Paper is actually a wide research plan of its effort to review Indonesianess spirit which is lately facing a hard test and challenge. The odd thing is the threat to Indonesianess continue to occur when the age of NKRI (Negara Kesatuan Republik Indonesia) becomes older and older (currently, the age is 66 years old) and the macro economy is developed more (included in G20 Countries), the world respects formal existence of any country, human rights, the information technology development becomes more sophisticated.There are sufficient reasons to prepare indications that the glue for Indonesianess becomes more fragile and experiences deterotiation process. The question may arise: awhat is the glue and adhesive material for Indonesian people and what is the function of the flue and adhesive material in formation and development process of Indonesian nation? This glue and adhesive material are very important because Indonesian nation is formed by various and different ethnic,...\n\nThere are significant Indonesian/Malay diasporic communities in South Africa, Sri Lanka, Suriname and New Caledonia, the former two formed out of early Dutch colonialism from about the 1650s, the latter two from late colonialism around the 1890s. This is a worthy topic for an inter-disciplinary research approach from the Indonesian social sciences community. At present the research tends to be country-specific, with a great neglect of comparative study. These are small communities struggling to maintain their interests and identities within large populations where they have difficulty in being heard. They have lived through tumultuous political events but still insist on their Indonesian, Malay and Javanese roots. But the next generation seems less interested in their historical ties with the Malay world. These identities are under threat. Keywords—Indonesian, history, diaspora\n\nThe existence and movement of diaspora across the world, challenge the existing legal norms on citizenship and migration. The responses from the law-makers from origin countries vary. Most of European, Latin America and African countries adopt dual citizenship law to their diaspora for the different reasons: immigrant integration, maintenance of loyalty to ex-citizen or because the closeness ethnic relation. However, most of countries in Asia-Pacific region-which gain the independence through decolonization process-do not favor dual citizenship towards their diaspora, including Indonesia, mostly because of the ideological perception of citizenship. In this sense, many countries grant the special status or scheme to their diaspora (neither citizens nor residents of the country) as an external quasi-citizenship based on ethnic descent as coined by Bauböck as \" ethnizenship. \" In Indonesia case, while the rejection of dual citizenship proposal is unavoidable, it leads idea to adopt a kind of ethnizenship status as an alternative regulatory model for Indonesia diaspora. In order to search the suitable and realistic regulatory scheme for Indonesian diaspora, this paper compare experiences from India and South-Korea which adopt a quasi-citizenship for their descendants overseas. The result from this comparison will be considered as a benchmark to develop regulatory model for Indonesian diaspora.\n\nObjectives: This paper is aimed to study the transnational activity committed by Indonesian diaspora through the process of global framing as a way to influence the Indonesian political policies, namely, the rights of dual citizenship. Methodology: This study uses a qualitative research method and the technique of interview, literature studies, and documentation data gathering. The use of multi-level strategy in transnational advocacy networks is utilised to find the patterns of network segmentation, where the multi-level strategy itself consists of the grassroots level, national to international level. Main Findings: The process of global framing by IDN Global have also showcased the input and the ongoing process, however, the output and the outcome are yet to come in the phases of initiation which then resulted in the formulation of initiatives on transnationalism long term goals and sustainability. The discourse of diaspora constitutes a new culture of Indonesia, thus several ...\n\nFollowing the lead of Chinese Diaspora, Indonesia has now started looking at the strength of Indonesian descent is spread throughout the world. When India and China began to rise economically on the global stage, one of the first things both nations did was to tap into their global diaspora. The millions of Chinese and Indians living on foreign soil and had achieved success responded by channeling billions of dollars back to their homeland as well as providing expertise. With the first Indonesian Diaspora Congress scheduled to open in Los Angeles on July 7, 2012, Indonesia, too, is beginning to recognize the power of those who have moved abroad.\n\nThis paper will start from the shifting of brain drain as phenomena and terminology, from traditional (nasionalist) to comprehensive (globalist) thought. The nationalist tends to envisage brain drain as negative impact to source countries while the globalist assumes the ‘brain’ is not drained but circulated and their roots will be embeded as part of their identities. By choosing Indonesia as the case study, this paper will try to analyse about how the brain drain issue related to Indonesia Diaspora Network (IDN) and how the network of IDN works to influence the homeland government with the globalist thought. The Indonesian President Decree No. 76 on 2017 regarding Facilities for Indonesian Citizens in Overseas (Masyarakat Indonesia di Luar Negeri – MILN) designated, on this paper, as new milestone of attainment to Indonesian Diaspora official recogniztion, which enclosed to mission of Indonesia Diaspora Network Global (IDN Global) since its established on 2012. Using the theory of T...\n\nThe existence and movement of diasporas across the world significantly challenge the existing legal norms on citizenship and migration. The responses from law-makers from the origin countries vary. Most European, Latin America and African countries adopt dual citizenship laws. However, most countries in Asia-Pacific region, including Indonesia, do not favour dual citizenship. This is mostly because of the ideological perception of citizenship. In this sense, many countries grant special status or schemes to their diaspora (neither citizens nor residents of the country) in the form of an external quasi-citizenship based on ethnic descent, called “ethnizenship” by Bauböck. This article, drawing on on-going research, compares the Indonesian experience with that of two other countries that have adopted quasi-citizenship schemes. India and South Korea have been chosen for comparison since both countries have particular statutes that recognise and regulate diaspora status. India created the Person of Indian Origin (PIO) card scheme in 1998 and Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) card scheme in 2003. These two schemes merged in 2015 into the Overseas Citizens of India Card Holder (OCC) scheme through the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2015. While India adopts a regulatory model of diaspora through a citizenship law regime, the South Korean experience shows a different attitude towards their diaspora. The Korean Government has refused the Korean diaspora’s proposal for dual citizenship and created a semi citizenship called “Overseas Korean” status through immigration law. This article discusses the Indian and South Korean experiences dealing with their diaspora in order to propose a regulatory model for Indonesia’s diaspora"
