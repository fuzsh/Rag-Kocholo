Based on the Census Report for the Punjab, 1883, by the late Sir DENZIL IBBETSON, K.CSI, and the Census Report for the Punjab, 1892, by the Hon. Sir E. D.

WESTON. 1914 , Glossary OF Punjab Tribes and Castes, Xi Labana. — Although generally associated with- the Mahfcams, the LaMnas are totally distinct from that caste. They are almost wholly confined to the sub-montane districts and K&ngfa, but are numerous in Lahore and also found in Gujr&nwAla and Ferozepur. Muzaffargarh and BahAwal- pur also contain Lab&na colonies. Tiiey are the carriers and hawkers of the bills, and are merely the Panjabi representatives of that class of Banj&ras who inhabit the sub*fnontane tracts east of the Ganges. The LaMnas of Gujrat were thus described by Captain Mackenize: — “ The LaMnas axe also a peculiar people. Their status amongst Sikhs is much the same as that of the Mahtamfc. They correspond to the BanjAraa of Hindustan, carrying on an extensive trade by means of large herds of laden bullocks. Latterly they have taken to agriculture^ but as an additional means of livelihood, not as a substitute for trade. As a section of the community they deserve every consideration and encouragement. They are generally fine substantially built people. They alsp possess much spirit. In anarchical times when the freaks or feuds of petty governors would drive the Jats or Gujars to seek a temporary abiding place away from their ancestral village, the Labanas would stand their ground, and perhaps improve the opportunity by extending their grasp over the best lands in tho village, in which their shorter- sightod and less provident lords of the Manor had, in some former period, permitted them to take up their Abode for purposes of com- merce. Several cases of this nature came to light during settlement, and in most of them the strength and spirit of progress were as apparent in the Labanas as were tho opposite qualities conspicuous in their Gujar opponents. Their principal village is Tanda (which means a large caravan of laden bullocks) and is an instance of what I have above alluded to. Allowed to reside by the Gujar proprietors of Mota, they got possession of the soil, built a kasha, and in every point of importance swamped the original proprietors. They have been recognized as proprietors, but feudatory to their former landlords, the Gujars of Mota, paying to them annually in recognition thereof a sum equal to one-tenth of the Government demand .’ 1 There is a curious colony of LaMnas 0 n the lower Indus who were settled there under Sikh rule by DiwAn S&wan Mai, and who are almost all Munna Sikhs or followers of B&ba N&nak, though many of them are Hindus in BahAwalpur. These men have almost entirely given up traffic and trade, and settled on the banks of the river where they lead a sort of semi-savage life,- hunting and making ropes and, grass, mats for sale. They hardly cultivate at all, and HincFus # do not associate with .them from fear of the Muhammadans who object to their eating wild tpig* The Lab&nas of Jhang are said to have come from Jaipur and Jodhpur and to be the same as the Mahtama of Montgomery. Chi the whole the LaMnas appear to be by origin closely allied with, if not actually belonging to, the. vagrant and possibly aboriginal tribes which will be djacussed in the Introduction (Vol. I) ; and it may be that at least some sections of the LaMnas are of the same stock as they. (See § Labdna origins. farther under Mahtam). About 30 per cent, of the Labfcuts argfe- turned as Sikhs and almost all the rest as Hindus, there being only somd 1,500 Musalm6us among them. . ° * lhe term Labdna appears to be derived from lun (salt) and 6d»a (trade), and the Lubtaa, Lobaaa, Labdna or Libdna was doubtless the great salt-carrying and salt-trading caste, as the Banidra was the general carrier, m former times. Indeed the Labdna is occasionally called a Banjdre. In Ambala he is also said to be called Bahrupia ^ on account of his versatility in adopting different avocations. Headmen among the Labdnas are called IN aik, and under them work is carried on. A Ndik gets a rupee at a betrothal and at a wedding a similar fee plus a leg of he-goat. Wherever a Labdna settlement exists, a village named Tdnda is almost Certain ^to be found. In l£dng^a the Labdnas hold four hamlets, each called Tdnda. Tand in Labdnki is said to mean a trav elling bodv or gang- , The origins claimed by the Labdnas vary. In Ludhidna they claim descent from Chauhan Kdjputs of Jaipur and Jodhpur. In Guirab they say they are Bagliubansi Biijputs and of the Sdndlas gotra. But in Kapurthala they say they are really Gaur Brahmans of Pili* bhit m the United Provinces and tell how a Kdjd, being afflicted with a mortal disease, was advised by Naru, a Brahman, to invite ten Brah- mans to a feast of flesh and wine and give them a gift ( dachchhna ) of a gold mohar each. The ten Brahmans bidden refused to take part in such a feast aud so Ndru inveigled eleven Brahman boys to it and gave them each a mohar. Their parents learnt of their degradation and drove them forth, but the Baja took them in. Prom them are de- scended the Labanas. Later on, adds the Hoshidrpur account, the sage Nifrada got the boys married to the daughters of rdkshasas, demons who live on flesh aud spirits, and himself became their priest. But a variant from Kdngra says that the Brahmans successfully re- sisted the efforts of the Baja to induce them to aocept his offerings. He was, it is related, a, Pilia B/ijput and, being afflicted with leprosy and the loss of many of his kinsmen, he was advised by the jotshis or astrologers to feast Brahmans as described above. In vain he sent for them and their girls and boys. The BrahmanB holding it degra- dation to accept gifts from a leper, placed all their goods on pack ani- mals and took to- the carrying trade. Many settled on the Wnb- M 0 f the Gauges and were called Pandit-Jotshis. The' others who took to carrying were called Labdnas from ladd, ‘ loading/ With them some ltajputs of the Pilia family, who were free of all taint of leprosy, were also exiled and the Pilia Labanas claim descent from them and sav they are of the Kiishab gotra, * But in other accounts it is implied that the Bahrupia is a sub-division of the IMmb , and the only one in the caste which does not wear the janeo. Waterfield, however, distinguished the Labata from tho Bahrfipia. The former ho described as a large’ well-built, shrewd, though rather heavy-looking man, while the Bahrupia is generally spare lively and good-tempered. Both however are of similar status,— Guirat Settlement Report 1861, p. 38. ’ Labana groups. 3 In Si&lkot, however, the gotra of the Pilia LabSnas is said to be Puslat. And that of the D&fcla is said to be Kundlag, while the Ajr&wat is Saundlas. Ajrdwat is said to bo descended from Aj, father of Jasrat and grandson of Rdmchandra, through the latter’s son Lao, In lyapurthala the following curious pedigree is given Bohra. B4b£ Haspa. Nanda. Khart. Salfm I3h4h. Mihr Sh&h. Amfn SMh. One Khart Manik appears in the Gujrdt tradition which makes the Lab&naB immigrants from Rai Bareilly. The status of the Labdnas varies somewhat in different parts of the Punjab and it does not appear to be homogeneous. Three groups must be distinguished : — i. The Musla Labdnas. ii. The Labdnas of Ludhidna. in. The Labdnas of Bahdwalpur. i. The Musla LaMnas are so-called by group ii. Most accounts represent these Labdnas as having I I sections or gats but the names of these are variously stated.* In Gujrdt the got names specified are as follows i. Ajrawat (called Ghotya in JECangra). v. Kh&sarya. ii. Datla (? laugher), also called vi. Gojalia. Makhan-Sh&hi. vii. Gujar. iii. Pilia (painted* With saffron). viii. Tatra or T^dra. iv. Pa?w&l, Padwal, Badwalia, Porwal ix. Wami&l or Mathaun (not Mahtam), (said to be so called from padwd , — x. Wdmowal. the janeo ceremony). xi, KdyowAl. The first five of these sections appear in nearly every account of the caste. The remaining six are probably als or sub-septs, locally exogam- ous, resembling those found in Central India, or possibly they are merely family or nicknames. Of the eleven sections specified the first > six are also found in Central India, apparently as endogamous groups split up into numerous exogamous divisions. So far no traces of this system have been found in the Punjab. In the sub-montane tracts of Sidlkot; and Gujrat the Ajrdwat look down upon the Khdsary as, and the story goes that once tliolafcter said that even the bullocks of the Ajrdwat would get married, they had so many daughters. The Ajrdwat also look on the Gujar section as inferior. . ii. The second group is confined to the Bet tract of Ludhidna, where it holds seven small villages, and shares in three others. It dis- * Sections in Kangra:— i, iii and vii as above, and Daina, Ralw&na, Gh&ra, Dholthal, Dahgra, Belia, Khefa, Moohia, Bhunia, Pudoygaya. Sections in Hoshi&rpur : — i, ii, iii, iv, v and vii as above, and Kakanya, Lulia, • Ghara, Kaluwaua, Bbagtaun. Sections in Ludhi&na Pilia, Garba, Laldia, Jatre or Khanna-Kupya, Gnrha, D£tla or Gnjre, Parwal and Negri. Of these the Garhaa rank highest. 4 Labana customs. avows all connection with the Musla Lab&nas and has the following gots ; — Dagndwat. Majr&wat. Ddiana. Bartia. Suki&na. , Balthia, Barn&wafc. This group is distinguished by having a fixed bride-price, Rs. 120 being paid if the bridegroom is a child, Rs. 140 if ho is an adult, to the girl's father. They practise karewa . A curious custom on the Holi is accounted for in a variant of the Prahl&d legend. All are Sikhs. iii. Jn Bahdwalpur the caste is thus grouped Ram&na Hypergamous group | j* do not intermarry. ii. Ud4na iii. Gharn&wat or Gharnot j^tennarry. iv. Chihot In this State the Lab&nas claim to be Rafchor. The Ramana and Ud&na are closely allied and hang together in all matters* They have a strong jr anchdyat system and rarely have recourse to the courts. Guilty persons are fined and the penalty ( (land ) spent on a ritual feast (karah parshdd) to the brotherhood. The legend about their origin is that a Rathor had a son born with long moustaches and so ho was called lab'ma or “ cricket/' In Si&lkot and Gujr&t the tribe stands much higher, and appears to be intermarrying with other agricultural tribes. This however does not necessarily imply a great rise in the social scale, for in Ferozepur the Baurias are intermarrying with J&ts. Widow remarriage is tolerat- ed, but, in Gujrat, the children of such marriages liav« a lower status. They are all Sikhs, claiming to have been converted by Guru Govind, and abstain from the flesh of animals slaughtered in the Muhammadan manner as they consider it hardm, and at the mere mention of halal’d meat exclaim wdh guru , wah guru , deprecating any allusion to such a subject.* The social ceremonies of the Labdnas vary greatly, not only from district to district but within each district. These divergencies in custom are ascribed, by the Labfinas themselves, to the composite origins of the caste. Birth observances . In Si61kot the three ceremonies observed on the birth of a child are : — 1. The oldest woman of the family does not eat or even touch anything with her mouth at the time of a birth in the houso, she makes ♦ But in K&ngfft both jhatka and haluVd flesh may be lawfully eaten, it is said, ttyvugh it is also added that Labinas who are sewak* of Lakhd&ta never eat jhatka. Offerings are made to that Pfr for the safety of cattle at the spring and autumn harvests. His priest is the Bharai but ho gets no ch&rma until he has prayed to fcho Pir to protect his set oak s and it is also his duty to sacriflce animals in the haldl form. The lab&na it said to bo an earth cricket with formidable jaws that bites severely. — Panjabi Diet y, , p, 645. Labana custom $. 5 tli© mother wash her hands and face, and then, mixing sugar and flour in equal quantities, makes small circular-shaped loaves called paparis, which are distributed to those present and to members of the caste. In Gujrafc no peculiar ceremony is observed on the birth of a child. The first thing to be done is to boil ajwain in a brass vessel, and throw it away outside the house. This is considered to be good for the health of the child, and it is believed that it removes the effects of the evil ©ye. 2. Two or three days after the birth, a widow of the family boils a quantity of sewidn (vermicelli) and cooks some rice. Then in consulta- tion with other women of the family, especially the old hags who by that time have assembled, she designates one from among them to plaster the floor of the mother's room with cowdung, and on this plas- tered spot sit seven or at most fourteen girls of the family or of the same tribe, while the widow draws lines of flour thereon, cutting the whole into several squares. Then she brings in the prepared food and all, assuming a prostrate position, offer prayers to the deity for the mother and all the members of the family. The women bow their heads before the girls and rub their feet,** treating them as devis or goddesses. This is called worshipping the Devi. They afterwards eat the food. 3. The third ceremony is performed on the first Sunday of H£r (June) of the same year. The mother is carried to a pipal tree by the women of the family, there a chosen place is plastored and prayers are offered in the manner already described. The words of the prayer aro : — “O pipal tree, guard us against evil.” Cooked rice is carried there by a female barber who sings a strange and mysterious song, both going and coming. This ceremony is generally observed on the birth of a son. There are some other ceremonies connected with the birth of a child, for example one which goes by the name of sawi. This is only performed when the child is a boy. Once a year the oldest wo- man of the family gets up early in the morning and makes some kardh (sugar, ghi and flour mixed and cooked together). Each article never weighs less than five quarters of a seer whence the name sawi (1 £), all the males of the family are then invited to feast on the kardh . After- wards a he-goat is killed, some broad loaves of bread are cooked, jhol is prepared and all these three things are eaten by the members (both male and female) of the family.*\" The Labanas of Gujr&t wear the janco or sacred thread, and are very particular about it. Even those who are Sikhs and do not cut their hair wear it. But in Kangra the use of it is dying out, though even those who are unable to afford the cost of the rite, will donit.afc their wedding. In Ludhi&na the janeo is assumed at marriage, but taken off after the | yfhera and hung on a pipal tree. . * On the birth of a boy, in Kangra, the panjdb ceremony is observed within llf'day* of the birth, the kindred being feasted, while the women goto worship a piped. Binging on the way there and back. A pot of water is emptied beneath the tree and red sandal ( Jcongu ), rice and flowers are offered to it. White ootfcon thread ie jalso wrapped thrice round.it in the manner of a janeo. Sweetmeat, as means allow, is also fplaoed there and the women bow to the tree. At weddings the pair observe a similar rite* Labdna marriage. Marriage customs. • The prohibited degrees appear to vary in every district. Sometimes the four-grot rule is observed, sometimes it is sufficient to avoid the got from which a wife has been taken for seven generations, or until the memory of any marriage with that got has faded away. In Gujrift early marriage is preferred, and widow remarriage (karewa) has now commenced, though it is considered degrading.* When on occasions of marriage, janeo, etc., a feast for the got people is eaten, the sons of a widow’s remarriage are not. allowed to sit with the liradari. Only men of the same got can sit with it, and learewa children are excluded. The Lab&nas in Ludhi&na celebrate a girl’s wedding by phera, like Hindus, but that of a widow by nikdh according to Muhammadan ritual. The Arya Sam&j has, however, set its face against such a confusion of rites. Monogamy is preferred and a Lab&nA will not take a second wife unless he is obliged. The wife first married enjoys certain privileges at religious ceremonies, but socially all the wives are on an equality. In KAngfa marriage is avoided in Chet, Bh&don, Asauj and Poh, and the date for the wedding should be fixed in the shultla pakhsh or light half of a lunar month so that the 11th ( ikddshi ) may fall on one of the days. Wedding ceremonies. In SiSlkot the boy’s father or guardian goes to the house of the bride’s father or guardian and asks him to give his daughter in marriage to his son. After a good deal of disoussion they come to some such agreement as that the boy’s father shall pay seven or eight score of rupees and give two or three ornaments to the girl’s father. There is no disgrace in making such a bargain, on the contrary the girl’s father insists on a good price and argues \" my daughter is very young and good looking, therefore ten score rupees are not much for her.” The utmost that a young girl is sold for is ten score rupees.t When the betrothal is complete the girl’s father gets half the price in advance. This payment is called bhdn. The whole price goes by tho name of hoi. The money is paid in the house of the girl’s father together with 101 oocoa-nuts and some mauli thread. The wedding day is fixed, not as among Hindus according to the solar months but as among Muhammadans' in the lunar month, n date of the moon being set apart for the purpose, and on that date the marriage party proceods to the girl’s house. Twenty men usually make up a wedding party. On tho first night the girl’s hands and feet are stained with mehndi (myrtle). This is absolutely necessary and if it iB not done the party has to turn back without being given a meal. This is the case too if there is any default in payment oj the •In K&ngra itiiasaerted that a widow can sod cannot espouse her husband's elder brother. Probably there is no absolute role, but a feeling that a widow BhoAld only marry his younger brother, or a cousin in a corresponding position J t In Ludhiina the prices are immutably died at Ss.

The boy’s father performs all the ceremonies in the house of the girl’s father. Four days later the ceremony of panch pafopi is performed. * The girl’s father puts sugar and ghi iu some dishes and selects a number of men of a peculiarly churlish nature to swallow their contents. The women, who are already occupying the roofs of the various rooms, begin to throw bricks, small pieces of stoue, maize, etc., from all directions, but the meu choseu continue eating in large mouthfuls even while they are being so assailed as they must not leave the food unfinished but must go on eating amid the shower of stones, etc. If they succeed in finishing the food they are praised by all present for their courage. Five days later, the couple go to a pipal tree accompanied by some of the brotherhood. The barber’s wife gives the hand of the girl into that of the boy and they walk around the tree hand in hand thrice. Then sweetmeats are served to the assemblage. Next the girl runs ahead and the sooner the boy catches her the more is he praised for his strength. On the morning of the sixth day after the wedding the ceremony of gora is effected. The father of the boy has a he-goat killed with a sword and then cooked. All feast on the flesh and return home. A few days later the boy goes uninvited to his father-in-law’s house and stays there for a month or more. The couple bids farewell to modesty iu a very short time. The muhldwa ceremony is performed five years after the wedding, and it is not unusual to see two or three children born during this period. The sati ceremony is also generally observed. Milk given by cows and buffaloes dedicated to the sati is held sacred. They do not allow men of other castes even to touch it. This milk is coagulated and made into whey in a separate vessel, tfo member of the family who is not deemed a true believer in the sati is allowed to drink the milk Of animals dedicated to a sati. After a week or at most a fortnight, the milk and whey of such animals or Jchir (rice and milk cooked together) and loaves of bread cooked in ghi are carried to the sthan (temple) of the sati and there a number of young girls of the same house- hold or of the caste are collected together and made to eat it. True believers in the sati are also invited to partake of it. Before eating a portion is given to the imaginary sati . Afterwards ail present prostrate themselves, rub their foreheads on the sacred spot, and offer up hearty prayers. If fortune thereafter smiles favourably on any family, they ascribe it to the sati y s kindness. But if anyone suffers from bodily infirmity, moral degradation, agricultural or pecuniary disaster he attributes it to her anger. The sati’s sthan is a spot of ground, generally outside the village, over which a real building is sometimes raised, but in most cases the bare earth serves the purpose* Death rites. A curious admixture of Hindu and Mu salmon rites is sometitnos observed at death. Thus in Ludhiana a dying person is laid on the ground, as among Hiudus, but after death the body is again put on a bed, a fire kindled at its right hand and the hand branded* But' after this the body is buried. LaMnabdiefe. Religious ideas . Properly speaking, the Lab&nas have no caste religion. Some wdrahip a devi or' a deity, others- a sati , while a good many observe the Sikh teaching. Isolated as they were from the Hindus in the beginning, they exhibit a total ignorance of their religious principles, and though they have adopted several Hindu customs, they have as yet imbibed nothing of their religion. Generally they believe in the S iii of the wood, the pixies of the water, the saH and Holi and M&tA vis. They fully believe in magic and charms such as the efficacy of mysterious characters; written on a scrap of paper, In each village a raised platform serves aa the sthan or temple of the Devi. Here a disciple or hermit lives permanently and women constantly resort to this sacred spot with whey in their hands which they present to him and ask about the future. The serpent is worshipped on the Gugga Naumi in Gujr&t. Women* take a churl and four chapdtie and go to tho hole of a serpent, where the Bh^t i s present. The churl and chapdtis aro given to the Bh&t, and cow's milk is poured into the hole. This hole is called gugga or v biimbia and is a fixed place outside tho village. The D&tlas must first worship the gugga before other castes can do it, and this is because it is believe*! that the serpent is their offspring. Tho pipal is the sacred tree. On the third day after marriage the bride and bridegroom are taken to a pipal tree, whose stem is decorated with red colour and mauli thread. The married couple turn round the tree and, after bowing their heads, come away. The Holi festival. A leading man of the village is usually employed to perform this ceremony which is generally held in tho month of Baisakh. This man summons a drummer who standing on some high place shouts the following words to all quarters of the village : — Imam mun dal bhanejo , wara ghadejo ware ho ae lo lijo , Holi ho hoho rae , hoho rae , hoho re. if W et the pulse and make small round balls of it. Come ! take away these balls and so call out the Holi, call out the Holi and call out the Holi.” This is known as the hoka (calling out) ceremony. When the drummer's call has reached all the inhabitants each one according to his means buys the necessaries for the approaching festival, which lasts for three days. Then both men and women assemble together in some open place and shout tho following words Hoho rae , hoho rae , hoho rae. Holi ho hoho rae. This lasts for full two days. On tho third morning all don fine clothes, and the women adorn their faces with gold and silver brim- tnents which are in shape and make quite different to those generally used in the Punjab. The leader then takes a drum and walks slowly ahead of all the villagers. With him they continue singing a mysteri- * jg u t in K4ngfa men only worship the Nig on tho Gugga Naumi, women being exolnd- ed. The ritual is much the same, bat kongu, rice, dhnp (incense) and dowers are offered. No thaptoi* are given away. Labar~Lahmiria* oas song while he occasionally says moro hoko r<w> holi ho hoko rae . At last, they reach the sacred spot and here they pile up old cotton plants, dry grass, etc., and set the heap on .6 re. The spectators standing round the scene make a great din while the women with dished full of pulse halls in their hands await the leader’s orders to throw them into the blazing fire. Several he-goats are now killed, the heads going to the leader while the remainder of the flesh is taken by each head of a family to his own house. Afterwards a wrestling match is held, at which famous wrestlers from different parts display their strength. This ceremony is known as the dudu. Finally they assume a pro>trate attitude before the spot sacred to the Devi Holi and then return home taking with them a small quantity of ashes which they keep as a pledge of the protection for the whole year. This is the festival in Gujr&t. In Ludhiana also the Holi is observed but with somewhat different rites. A particular spot iR set apart for its celebration and there a pice and a betel nut are buried Over them a heap of cow-dung cakes is piled and set alight, being watched with as much solicitude *as a woman in her confinement/ Next evening when the fire has burnt out the people of the village and its neighbourhood collect and search in the ashes for the pice and nut, and whoever finds them will be ex- tremely f ortunate. It is believed that whoever finds one will who find the other as they cannot be found separately. This rite is explained by the following legend- : — Bhagat Prahl&d’s father hated him for his devotion to God, arid after several devices to kill him had failed he bade him sit in a burning fire on his sister’s lap. She believed herself to be fire-proof, but when put to the test she was burnt to death while Prahlad escaped. After this observance, disputes are laid before the kindred for settlement. Fines are imposed on offenders or they are out-casted, and those who have complied with the orders of the kindred are re-admitted into caste. Next day they re-assemble and hold a feast at which men and women dance together and throw the usual coloured water on one another. Dancing and singing they go from house to house, and if any house is not visited its owner takes offence. LAbar, a J&t clan (agricultural) found in Mult&n.

The Ddgis, Lohdrs, Bardras, liensis, etc., seem to have no gots and all intermarry, though they refuse to marry with the lowest caste of all, the Bhipis. There are also a few Lamas, chiefly in Gdrd, where a certain number of nuns (chornoj are also found. The Kanets of Ldhul offer a few points of interest. Many of them in Pafcran are no doubt descendants of settlers from Kullu o« Bat gdhal, hut the rest, and all the Kwn^ts ot Gara and Rangloi, are pure Tibetans or nearly so The Lahula, however, now looks up* n the term Botia (Tibetan) as a term of reproach.

Such sons are called gurus , biit call themselves Brahmans, but they in turn marry Kanet wives or women of mixed caste if they can find any. r ]'h&kurs, Brahmans, and Kanefcs will all smoke together in L&hul, and Brahmans will drink water, tea or lugri (rice-beer) from a Kanet's hand, but will n»>t eat even sachi roti , which appears to be equivalent to pakki rotf. Xbakurs will eat pakki or sachi ro\\i from a Kanet’s hands, but not kachi , but those Th&kurs who wear no janeo will do so. The Kanets do not wear the janeo* The main class distinction, as in other Tibetan countries, appears to be that between the agriculturists, who form the great mass of the population, and the wage-earning classes; but this line of demarcation, though it prevents intermarriage, does not separate the classes in the rigid way that the institution of caste would do. The artisan classes nevertheless have their distinctions — see under Lohar. But the most interesting thing about the L&hula population is its economic system. This merits full description as it is a good example of a small, self-contained, ancient polity. The allotments of fieids,* supposed to have been made authoritatively at a remote period, and to have been originally all equal, subject to the same rent or tax and each liable to furnish one man for service or forced labour to the lord, appear to have b^en indivisible and in G&r& and Rangloi, the Tibetan valleys, are in fact still almost all undivided. Land reclaimed from the waste was formed into separate allotments, or added to an existing allotment with a corresponding increase in its burdens. The great bulk of the allotments are held by the yulfa or villagers, each of them being on an average about five acres in area. Some small miscellaneous holdings are held rent-free in lieu, of service to the com- munity. Such are : — The gar-zing ii. „ be-zing Hi. „ onpo-zing iv. „ man-zing ^held by the«^ blacksmiths, musicians (Hensis), jndhsis or astrologers, imbeds or physicians. Probably the h6h&rs,jodhsis and beds could have been evicted in times past by the community or the Tb&kur, but the general idea now seems to be that they could not be dispossessed, however inefficient. The Hensis’ tenure is however more precarious, as they appear to hold solely at the Tk&kur’s pleasure. The Th&kurs hold certain kothis or groups of hamlets in fief or jdgir anil are owners of the waste within the limits of their kothis . The arable land is cither held rqnt-free by his dotoen t*or cadet branches of ♦ Zing hom is a local word used to describe such an allotment. A zing kom chovgpu or full allotment, varies from three to seven acres in extent according to quality of the soil. Some few families only held a half allotment or zing komfitka t The dotoen is clearly the dothain or cadet (Skr, Dwiataniya), a term Applied to cadet ^ranches of Rijput septs in Gurd&spur, Lahula inherita/nce. Ms family, or rent-free, but in lieu of continuous service, by hie chaksis or.family retainers ; while his garhpdn or demesne land is cultivated - by a class called hang chumpa or farm servants (literally cottagers). A dotoen family sinks after a time, when the sense of relationship to tbeThdkur has become faint, to the status of chaksis and is then liable for Service. A dotoen 3 8 holding is about one or two allotments (5 to 10 acres) on an average, a chaksi’s from 2£ to 5 acres, and a cottager’s about 1£ acres. The nature and extent of the aeivice^ rendered varies, but the general principle is that the burden on each allotment is fixed. Mortgages are not uncommon and even a chaksi or a cottager may mortgage his holding, provided that the mortgagee paid a full rent if he or the mortgagor failed to render the customary service. Among the subordinate landholders all sons are considered entitled to equal shares of their father’s holding, but in practice they seldom divide, and live on with wife, land, house and chattels in common. When asked to defend this repulsive custom of polyandry, they say that their holdings are too small to divide, and that experience shows them that it is impossible for two sisters-in-law, with separate husbands and families, to live together, whereas two or more brothers with a common wife can agree. In such families the custom which has hitherto prevailed, with regard to inheritance of the shares of brothers who die without issue, is quite clear : such share has always gone to the brothers with whom the deceased lived in unison, or to his issue, to the exclusion of all claim on the part of the separated branch of the family. The moBt exceptional point in the custom of inheritance prevailing in L&hul is the fact that, in default of sons, a daughter succeeds to her father’s whole estate in preference to nephews or other male kinsmen, provided that, before her father’s death she has not married and settled down to live on her husband’s holding away from home. If she is married and living with her husband in her father’s house, she succeeds, and if she is unmarried, she can hold for life as a maid, or can at any time marry and take her husband to live with her. Supposing such a husband and wife to die without issue, it appears to be doubtful who would have the best claim to succeed them, whether the next of kin to the wife or to the husband. But it is agreed that the survivor of the two might lawfully give the estate to any member of either of the two families. At first sight of the people of L&hul or Spiti you perceive thajb you have left India, and are among a Tartar or Mongol race. The figure iboth of men and women are short and stout, their complexions are a ruddy brown instead of a black-brown or dusky yellow, their faces are broad and flat, with high cheek bones and oblique eyes, they have broad mouths and flat noses with wide nostrils. In fact, none of them can be said to be handsome, and the old women are quite hideous, the , only redeeming point is the look of honesty and smiling good humour to be recognised in almost every countenance. In thbse parts of LAhul in which there is most admixture of Hindu blood, the blending of the two types is very clearly distinguishable. ' LAhula customs. 1 « Customs connected with birth, marriage and death. The best general account of the social customs of the Botids will be found in Cunningham's Ladakh , but even in Spiti and L&hul, especially in the latter, the practices of the present day will be found to differ in some details. At almost every observance the religious ceremony consists in the simple reading of prayers or passages from the holy books by a lama, while the whole company of men and women sit round with clasped hands and downcast eyes, and repeat the verses after him. The social celebration of all these events consist mainly of feasts in which much chang is drunk. The decisive point in the negotiation for a betrothal is the acceptance or refusal of a pot of chang sent to the bride's father; if he drinks, the affair is settled without more words. Polyandry, or the taking to wife one woman by several brothers, is a recognised institution, and is very general, the object is to prevent the division of estates. Sir James Lyall describes a case which came before him in which one of two brothers living in polyandry much wished to separately marry a girl by whom he had had an illegitimate child, but the wife of his family objected strongly, claiming both brother as husbands, and refusing to admit another woman into the household, and she eventually prevailed. Among the Kanets the age of betrothal is any time between 10 and 20 years of age for both parties. It defends apparently on their means. The wedding is solemnised one or two months after the betrothal. Among the Kanets the man sends a relative to the girl's house and he conducts the negotiations. At his second visit he takes a rupee and some such as a present. The day for the betrothal is fixed by the jotshi or astrologer. Then on the day fixed the man's family go in a body to fetch the girl. The ceremony is attended by Brahmans or lamas and sometimes by both and the Shdstras are read. The bride receives as dower (i) the zori ( istridhan ) which is given her by her parents, {ii) the gotan, which is given her by her husband and is recoverable by him, and (Hi) the Th&kurs and sometimes even Kanets give some land to be held independently for life by the bride ; this corresponds to the Kuliu chhethi . Further, as in Kullu, the wpman often takes an agreement stipulating for the chhethi etc., and provid- ing for her separate maintenance in the event of her husband marrying a second wife, which is usually done when the first is barreu. Divorce seems free. In L&hul cattle are not slaughtered nowadays (except perhaps in some villages at the head of the Bh&ga Valley, and there it is done •with the greatest secrecy), but five or six sheep are killed in each house at the beginning of the winter ; the flesh dries, and will then keep good for any number of years ; the older tho meat, the greater the delicacy to the taste of a L&huli. The principal £ood of the \\ L&huli is buck-wheat, boiled whole and eatefi as gruel, or roasted and made into flour, which is then baked into cakes or mixed with chang beer, and formed into dumplings. The Buddhists, half-Buddhists, Loh&rs, and Shipis always eat any sheep or goats which have died from fatigue or disease, tod some of them eat also calves, oxen or yaks which have been killed by a fall 14 Ldhula houses, etc • from rocks orjotherwise, bat this is done secretly ; Wien at Keylang a calf happens to die in the morning, it remains where it fell the whole day, nobody touching it, but the dead body certainly disappears during the night, and many bones, especially during winter, of such animals may be seen lying about near the villages, but dead asses and ponies are only left to the eagles and foxes. Slaughtering yaks during winter is still practised at some villages above Keylang, but it is done very secretly, and nobody will acknowledge the fact. There is a small temple with the image of a Ihd near Yanample. Every third year a yak is sacrificed there, the victim being supplied in turn by all the kothts of L&hul. This custom dates from the time of the Kullu R&j&s who (as the god is said to be the same as that of the Dungri temple near Manili in Kullu) ordered that one buffalo was to be offered (as at Dungri) every third year. Since L&hul has become British territory, yaks have taken the place of buffaloes. The Shipis eat the flesh of the sacrificed yak, Wheaten flour is generally eaten in L&hul. Butter and butter milk are regular articles of diet in both countries. Chang , a kind of beer brewed from^rice and barley, is drunk generally, and tea and a kind of whisky by those who can afford it. In L&hnl the houses are smaller than they are in Spiti, and less care and taste are expended in building and adorning them. Ordinarily the upper storey consists of an interior or winter room, an outer or summer room, and a verandah room open on the fourth side. In this verandah stands the loom, inside will be found largo corn chests made of slate set in wooden frames, large stone bowls from Iskardu, iron cauldrons, and cooking pots, an iron tripod or pot stand, some wooden dishes, and a few earthen pots from Kullu. Many pack-saddles for sheep and goats are strewed about, and a few blankets and thick sheep-skin coats hang on the wails. Small holes in the wall serve the purpose both of windows and chimneys : bedsteads are unknown. Grass is stacked on the roof, and wood for fuel inside. This is a fair description of a house in the upper valleys of L&hul ; in the lower villages the rooms are larger and better ventilated. In G&r& many of the houses are built together in one block with connecting passages by which com* munication is kept up in the winter without going out, which, when the snow is very deep, may be scarcely possible. Making thread is the chief occupation in winter ; on fine days the loom is brought out, and some weaving is done. Both men and women work the loom in L&hul. In L&hul the dress of the men is much the same as that worn, in Kullu, the only difference being that the coat is longer and of thicker and darker cloth, and that trousers are always worn, the women, on the other hand, dress like those of Spiti (see under Tibetan), except that straw sandals replace the long boots. It is not easy at first fi to distinguish a L&huli nun, if young, from a lad, as they shave their heads and dress like men. Ancient belief in Ldhul . Without doubt there existed a very low kind of religion in L&hUl before Budhism got hold of the people, and the latter has not beetf 16 Ldhula beliefs . able to suppress it entirely . The early religion of Lghul is still known under the name of ‘ Lung-pachhoi/ that is, ( the religion of the valley.* When it was flourishing many bloody, and even human, sacrifices seem to have been regularly offered up to certain Ihd, gods or evil spirits residing in or near old pencil-cedar trees, caves, etc. This cruel custom disappeared gradually afVr the doctrine of the Buddhists had influ- enced for a time the minds cf tlie people. There is a story which I shall relate, as it seems to show that this was the case. Near the vil- lage of Kyelang a large dry pencil-cedar was standing till last year, when we felled it for fire-wood : the story goes that before this tree, in ancient times, a child of 8 years old was annually sacrificed to make the spirit who resided in it well-disposed towards the inhabitants of Kyelang. The children seem to have been supplied in turn by the different families of the village. It happened one year to be a widow who had to give up an old child of the required age of eight years. The day before her only one was to bo taken from her she was crying loudly, when a travelling Idma from Tibet met her, and asked the cause of her distress. Having heard her story the lama said : ‘ Well, I will go instead of your child/ He did so but did not allow himself to be killed : ‘the spirit must kill me himself if he wants human flesh/ said he, so saying he sat himself down before the tree and waited for a long time ; but as the demon made no attack on him, he became angry, took down from the tree the signs and effigies, and threw them into the Bh&ga river, tolling the people not to sacrifice any more human beings, which advice was followed from that time forward. The demon fled and settled on the top of the Koko pass, where it still dwells under the name of the Kyelang Ihd or god of Kyelang, getting now only the annual sacrifice of a sheep supplied by the shepherds. In the time when the Lung- pachhoi was the only religion that existed in the valley, there were doubtless more places in L&hul where human beings were immolated to supposed arods and evil spirits. At present, near not a few villages sheep aud goats are yearly killed and offered up (contrary to- the pre- cepts of Buddhism) to evil-disposed Ihds , and it may be that animals have now taken the place of men. The people however still continue to believe in a great -many spirits or demons known as Ihds , who are supposed to dwell in trees, rocks, or on the hill tops, and before whom the Buddhists (contrary to their religion) sacrifice sheep and goats. In addition, they believe greatly in witches, sorcerers, and the evil eye, and have a host of other superstitious in common with ^11 the other L&hulis. The religion of tho people is nominally Buddhism, but it is becoming » nominally Hinduism. Thus the god of the Pass is la-tse 9 zhing-lha is the field god and In and tsan are the river and mountain gods. The In is said to be a nag or snake deity and is worshipped with milk and water. His shrine is usually a spring and it is kept clean. Women do not worship him. The pile of horns (ibox) # *oftotf seen bn top of a ' house in Ldliul is the Iha-tho or gods* boundary. A demon commonly believed in is Kaugreta (lit. one-ear) who is in man's shape with one arm, one leg, etc. Ho is saiqi not to bo worshipped now at all. Expiatory ceremonies of various kinds are common, tjie tangjar or priest (corr. to the gur of Kullu) being employed, just as in * Kullu the Ldhula beliefs, f ur {guru) or chela has much more to do with popular religion than the fcrahman, with whom tho Buddhist lama closely corresponds. Thus the jhingsha ceremony (called in Kullu hawan) of building a miniature house of sticks, filling it with flour, etc., and burning it, is performed to avert evil from a new house, and sometimes on other occasions. The Shi pis seem to receive the ministrations of Bhot priests only, while the other castes have various divinities, e . g., Mahddeo in Patan : Hirmadevi at Sissu (said to be \"the Kullu Jamlu) : Gantal Devi called Chahja-mon equivalent to Kdli Dovi, and also T , su , dag-mo=/a7&-maKftfc or the lady of life : Devi Yamso at Kyelang : Buddha G«ya : Shakya Tub-ba: Padrna Sambha, said to have come from Ujjain : and Guru Rinboohe. Religious ceremonies connected with agriculture . The Ldhulis observe certain ceremonies. of a religious nature in con- nection with the cultivation of their fields. A lama, who understands the astrological books, names the auspicious day on which ploughing should be commenced (this day falls always between the 8th and 22nd of May). After the fields have been ploughed and sown, a procession goes round all the fields, preceded by one or two lamds and two drums, some oi the company carrying at the same time several large religious books on their backs, this done, the whole company sits down in the fields near the villages and feasts on cakes and chang supplied jointly by all the land-holders. All this is done to secure the sprouting up of the seeds sown, after that the water-course for irrigating the fields is repaired, on which occasion a sheep is offered up to the Ihd which is supposed to have special care of the water-course. Again, as soon as the seeds have sprouted, another ceremony is performed ; this consists in sticking small branches of the pencil-cedar here and there in the field, and burning incense, while some members of the family sit down, eat, and drink a little, and murmur some prayers. This is to ensure that each grain which has sprung up may prosper and produce many ears. When the fields are nearly ripe, a goat or sheep is killed in honor of the Ihd , in several villages horse-races are held at the same time. Till the festival of the ripening grain has been celebrated, no- body is allowed to cut grass or any green thing with a sickle made of iron, as in such case the field-god would become angry and send frost to destroy or injure the harvest. If, therefore, a Ldhuli wants grass before the harvest sacrifice, he must cut it with the sickle made of the horn of an ox or sheep, or tear it off with the hand. Infractions of this rule were formerly severely punished, at present a fine of one or two rupees suffices, which goes into the pocket of the jdgirddr or the village headman. The iron sickle is used as soon as the harvest has been declared to be commenced by the performance of the sacrifice. The Ldhulis of Chamba . The Ldhulis of Chamba-Ldhul, which forms part of the Pdngi* wizdrat include’ Brahmans, Hdjputs, Thdkurs and Rdthis, with the follow- ing low castes : — Hdlis, Lohdrs and Ddkis. These castes are all en- dogamous. There are Bhots in the Miydr Ndld, but the Ldhulis proper have no communion with them. -The only families in Chamba-Ldhul claiming Rdjput descent are those of the Rdnds of Trilok Ndth and Margraon. The Rdnd of Trilok Ndfy *the Ldhulis oj Chamba, 1 7 intermarries with R4n4 families in the BAvi and Be4s valleys : the B4n& of Margraon intermarries with Th&kurs and BA this in Ij&hul. Both of these families are probably of Tibetan origin. Among the high castes marriage is prohibited within three degrees of relationship ou either side. The marriage customs of the L&hulis are similar to those of Pdngi. The boy's father goes to the girl's house accompanied by a friend and if an alliance is arranged he returns and pays a rupee* to the girl's father; this is called tangrandi or suthri . There are two forms of marriage ; the superior form being called bydh . Sunday and Monday are regarded as good days for a marriage. On the appointed day the bridegroom goes with his friends to* the bride's house, where all are seated, the bridal pair being placed side by side with the bride on the left. A totu of sattu is prepared and the bride's maternal uncle presents a portion to them with arms crossed, as in, P&ngi, and then to the rest of the assembled company. This observe ance is called marpi. A feast follows with drinking, dancing and singing. In the morning the bride's parents and friends present the sudj or marriage gifts, and the bridegroom gives the bandha or ornaments to the bride, one rupee each to his lather and mother-in-law. The bridal party then returns to the bridegroom's house, and at the door the bridegroom’s mother meets them with a totu of sattu , a lota of water, incense aud a sheep. The warna ceremony is performed as in Pangi and the sheep killed and given to EL&lis. They then enter the house when the totu ot sattu is distributed to all, beginning with the bridal pair, by the boy's maternal uncle. A feast follows with singing and dancing. The girl's parents do not accompany the procession, only her brother and other relatives — and no money payment is made to them on their departure. The phirauni ceremony is observed as in P4ngi. A modified form of polyandry exists in Chamba- L&hul. At the time of the phirauni the younger brother of the bridegroom accompanies the party and presents Re/1 to the girl's mother which establishes his right as a second husband. More than two are not allowed. The custom of carrying away the bride privately is also common in Ldhu). Widow remarriage, called topi lani , is practically the same as in Pdngi. A widow cannot now be compelled to marry her deceased hus- band's brother, and may appeal to the court for protection, both in Pangi and L&hul, if compulsion is attempted. Divorce is recognized and usuafly two or three respectable persons are present on the occasion. The husband and wife hold a piece of thread between them and break it by pulling in opposite directipns. If both are consenting parties no money payment is made, otherwise the payment is made by the jflirty wishing the divorce, and is called man . Death’obser vances are much the same as in Pdngi ; children under one year and lepers being buried and all others burnt and* thp ashes thrown into* the Chandra Bhaga. For eight days after tlm deafcji^ only. one meal a»day is eaten, called apas> and on the ninth day a feast is given to the near relatives, which practically ends the period of mourning. Those who can afford it raise monolith slabs ( dhaj and other memorials to the dead. The period of impurity is 8 days for all purposes. * ♦ For some notes on these commemoration stones, nee App. II of Freneke’s Htitory of 16 Festivals in Chamba tdhtit. \\ * ^?he only tenure in L&hal ia called ghai or ghdri, i.a, an equal divi- sion of the orop between landlord and tenant. The chief festivals in Chamba-l4hul are the following 1. The Brishu on 1st Baisdkh, which is observed as in P&ngi. % The Pori mela is observed only in Trilok Nfith, and is accom- panied by dancing and drinking* Held in Bh&don. 3. The Rhaul mela observed as in P&ngi. 4. The Run mela is the same as the Sib mela in Pdngi. It is also called Chfir and is held on the new moon of Ph&gan. The evening is spent in eating and drinking, and on the follow- ing day. 6. The Or mela is held on the full moon of Ph4gan, in Trilok N4th and Margraon, and like the other melas the chief ac- companiment is drinking and dancing. Ldhul is the meeting place of the Aryan and Mongolian races and the people exhibit the characteristics of both, though the Aryan element predominates. Their religion is an impure Buddhism grafted on the ancient and probably aboriginal N&g and Devi worship which is similar to that of Pdngi and is found as far up as the junction of the Ghaudra and Bh&gi rivers — Chorteus, prayer flagB, mani walls and other symbols ofc Buddhism are common. The Buddhist temple is at Trilok N4th aud the chief Devi shrine is that of Mirkula Devi at Udaipur. Mr. A. H. Francke thinks that the original worship of Trilok N&th and Mirkula was an aboriginal form of Shiva and K&li worship. When Buddhism entered the country Shiva was identified with Ava- lokita, and the Kdli of Mirkula with Yajravar&hi who is still worshipped there by the Tibetans. The results of Sir Thomas Holland's measurements of the L&hul Kanets* went to show the population of the Lahul villages now contains very little unaltered Tibetan blood, whilst there are apparently some individuals who uniformly tend towards the Indian type. The evidence of the cephalic, naso-malar and nasal indices, stature and facial angle, uniformly points to the presence of a large proportion of Tibetan blood in the L&hul Kanets, but no precise idea of the quantitative relatious of the Indian to the Tibetan strain can be formed on our present data. The Kanets of U&hul include a certain number of immigrant families from the Kullu side and they have not been long enough in the country to have their blood tainted by intermarriage with those who have Tibetan blood. Valuable as these measurements were it is perhaps to be regretted that those made in the different valleys, Fattan, G6r& and Raneloi, were not distinguished, as the elements in each valley are believed** to vary. Moreover the possible aboriginal element in the valleys, especially in the remoter hamlets, cannot be disregarded. It is now established that there is a Mundari element in the language of Kanaur * The Kanets of Kulu and L&hul, Punjab, A Study in Contact-Metamorphtim, in JoigfttfA I the Anthropological Inst, 1902. tak^Lahhwayya* 19 and thore may well he, in the population of the Punjab Himalayas, a Mu$4* element which is represented by the Mons or Monpa.

To this clan belonged SaAdatyAr KhAn, son of MahAbat KhAn, a chief who held some post at the Delhi court under Alamgfr. His jagir is said to have been worth Rs. 1,09,000 a year, but a proposal to betroth the daughter of GhAzi KhAn, the eighth Sial chief, to him was regarded as an insult, and he was unable to protect his country against the SiAls of Jhang and eventually the chiefs of KamAlia were reduced to tdluhdars under the NikkAi Sikhs ; (2) one who gathers gum-lac.

LamuoIj a worshipper of Ldlbeg who appears to be also called BdM Shdh, the mythical high priest of the Chuhrds and other castes of aimilny status. Further it irf at least highly probable, as Sir Denzil Ibbetson pointed ont,* that Bdld Shdh is Bdlmik, the traditional author of the Ramayana, and if so, Ldlbeg or Bdld Shdh is merely a Muham- madanised name and title for that Hindu saint. According to Sir Riohard Temple the legend goes that Shiva once rubbed his hand on a red stone, Idl baft, a, and Ldlbeg came out. Possibly he suggests, Ldl- beg is a corruption of Ldl Bhfkshu, “ the red monk ” (i.e., Shiva him- self). Templet also records a legend which certainly points to the earth- god Shiva as the prototype of Ldlbeg. Once the Prophet with Mihtar Bids and other saints was sitting in God’s court. Ilids spat and his spittle fell on the prophets, so the Almighty bade Bids serve as a sweeper, but he begged that an intercessor for him might be born. Ilids was then himself born into the world as a sweeper, but lived in the hope of forgiveness and one day the Great Saint or Pfr gave him his coat to wear. Ilids placed it in a pitcher of earth and when asked by the Great Saint why he did not wear it replied that he feared to soil it. But the Saint bade him don it and come to him. Ilids was, however, unable to open* the pitcher and brought it to the Saint who said : “ Come out, Ldlbeg, quickly.\" (Ldl means “ my son ”), From the pitcher emerged a fair man wearing lal beg “ red clothes,\" i.e., bhekh. Him the Saint designated as the prophet of the sweepers and Ilids took him home, filled his huqa for him and worshipped hiin. To this day the sweepers fill the pipe for a religious teacher. Ldlbeg at once became invisible, because he disapproved of Bids’ beliefs and the Saint bade him do penance promising that Ldlbeg should intercede for him, and saying that in the first age the ghatmat or vessel worship- ped to represent Ldlbeg would be golden, in the next of silver, in tie third of copper and in the fourth of earth, and so the Mihtars or sweepers now worship vessels of earth. J But another legend makes Ldlbeg the son of a Mughal woman who was barren until at Bdlmfk’s prayer she bore a son.§ And yet a third makes him the son of Shaikh Sarnd of Multdn. His mother dedicated him to Bdlmfk and he even- • Punjab Census Report, 1889, § 295, note 3. *> t Indian Antiquary, XI, p. 290. A fuller variant, given in P. N. Q. II, 122, discloses a close, if obscure, connection between L61beg and Gorakh N4th, who is so prominent in* the Jogis’ mythology. Shiva’s madan was one day rnbbed by Parmeahar on a stone and produced Ulbeg; some on a reed ( sarkanda ) whence sprang Sarkande Nath: some on eowdung (gobar), whence Gobar Kith, and some was oast into a river and swallowed hv a fish who brought forth Maohhendar N*th, Gorakh Nbth’s preceptor.

Then at Delhi, whither L&lbeg went with all his followers, he founded the religion named after himself and divided his disciples into five sects, the L&lbcgi, Shaikhri, Dumri, Hill and Wiiwat. The L&lbegi Mihtarsof Th&nesar and Karnal affect Bibi Dlii&ni, as well as Ldlbeg himself, offering her cMm (bracelets), henna and a dori Jed pardnda , or hair ribbon, but all that we know of Dhi&ni is that she was a relative of L&Lbeg.* Pundri, mentioned as a daughter of B&lmik, does not appear to be worshipped, nor does Satti Chuhri, his wife. Ld.1 Guru is another name of Ldlbeg and he is also called Bbangi, which was a title of the rdkshaso Aronahirit , Aruna Karata, “ the red crow,” an ancient tribal deity, ♦ Thus, popular mythology persists not only in distinguishing B&lmik from L6lbeg, but also in attributing to each, of them a family and . disciples. But one form of the myth denies to L&lbeg any human or natural origin and makes him but an emanation of B&Inuk. The latter used to sweep Bhag wan’s court-room, and the Almighty gave him a dress which B&lunk buried in a pit. When asked by the Almighty why he did not wear it he went to the pit and found a boy in tlm robe. According to one story B&lmxk protested that he had no milk for the babe, and was directed to go home and give it to the first animal which crossed his path. On his road to Earth B&lmik saw a hare suckling her young and to her he gave the child. So to this day no sweeper will eat a hare.t But this version does not appear to be currant in the Punjab, wheie it is said, at least in N&bha, that some Chuhr£s do not eat hare’s flesh because a Chuhf*& once killed a cow's calf by accident and hid iG under a basket. When the owner tracked his calf to the Ohuhr&’s house the latter said that a hare was hidden beneath the basket and when it was overturned a hare was found instead of the dead calf. But in Gurgaon the Sus Gohar got of the Chuhr£s is the only one which observes his tabu and that only because the hare once bore the name cf that got . In Mont- gomery the Muhammadan Chubr&s do not eat the hare's flesh if they are followers of the Makhdum Jah&nl&n of Uch as that Pir forbade its use. Other Ohuhrds can eat it. As already noted B&lmik is probably to be identified with the author of the Itaui&yaca, bin one story is that there is another B&lndk “of low degree ”, and concerning him various legends are curi’ent. The most popular version represents B&lmik as a gimfc robber, who was a Bhil. Once ho attacked tho seven rishis , but in compliance with their Remonstrances he naked his parents to join him. Their refusal cut him to the quick and he turned faqir. A less common version runs :~ When Yudisthira had performed an aswamedh jag and all present had feasted, the bell did not sound of its own accord, As it should 'ha ve.done # ,Ro announce the completion of the rites. So it was thought that they had been irregularly done or that some bhagat had not attended the * P. N.Q.,L,663. t.ifcMaj. feast. Accordingly B61mlk was invited and when served by Draupadi with 86 various dishes lie mixed them altogether, which in Draupadi’s eyes stamped him as indeed one of low caste. Nevertheless the bell now rang and the rites were thus duly completed, the only defect being Draupadi’s contempt for B&lmik, which she was exhorted to forget.* According to Mr. H. L. Williams L&lbeg is represented by a red pennon on a red pole, while B&lmik's insignia is a broom of peacock’c feathers at the end of a bamboo. Both are carried in procession attend* , ed by dholaks or drums, Pfr Chhata is also said to be an ancestor of the Chuhrfis who gained sanctity by removing a cow's carcase when no one else would do so, but he is doubtless identical with Bfilmik of whom a similar legend is told.* Once a man bade his youngest son remove a dead cow, but he refused. Each son in turn refused also, until he came to the eldest of his four sons, B&lmik, who obeyed his father in spite of hiB knowledge that it was the duty of the low-caste Hat&ras to remove dead cattle. His father's promise to re-admit him into the family was not fulfilled and his descendants too became known as Hatifiras. With the cult of B&lmlk is associated, round, about Amritsar, that of Mi&n Siura, himself a Chuhf&, who became a devotee. Once Q&z! DdnA tested his powers by making him sit on a sheet spread over the mouth of a well and say his prayers. The Qdzf expected to see him fall into the well, but he did not, and whenever he cooked the flesh of a cat or a dog for his food and began to eat it the animal came to life and fell at his feet. The Chuhras perform a jag in his honour and that of Bdlmik and give alms in the names of both those saints. * In Sirmfir Bdlmik has a mak&n , pakka or kachha , in front of which is lighted a fire and on this ghi is poured. The offerings made to it are given to Bhangi faqtrs, who are recruited - from the Chuhrds. The Bdlmikis hold themselves aloof from other Chuhrd groups such as the Bhalla or Dhankta, Rdwat, Halad, Daung, Dhdnak, Megh and Heri, and do not marry with them. In marriage four gots are avoided and the wedding is solemnised by a guru of their own called a Meopa, but a Chhdman or Jh&man is also said to fulfil the functions of a Brahman and conduct the seven pheras. The L&lbegi thus appears to be identical with the Bdlmifef, though many accounts treat them as distinct.f In what they may differ does not however appear. The Ldlbegi certainly seems ffo be * Other versions amplify the one in the text. According to one, B&lmik was carried to the feast in a chariot of air by one of the Pindavas ^though he was covered with leprosy : P. N. Q. II, § 236. In another B&lmlk protests to Arjan that he is a Hati&ra and unworthy. In one It is stated that every grain of food eaten should have brought from Heaven a mnkh hi ahdsh bdni or Banhh dhuni t the sound of a conch, but when Balmfk devoured his portion in 2J mouthfuls only 2} sounds were heard. In another Arjan is perturbed because m sounds are heard instead of 8. , f 9.p, in Sirmtr the Bilmlkfs are said to worship Bilmfk* but not Iilbeg. In this Stats the fifimfUs am said to marry on equal teams with the Jttaabis, * the Ldtbegi $ and Ghuhras • superior to and distinct from the Dh6nak,* and followers of Bdlmik do not eat food touched by a Dlidnak. The L&lbegis of the S&rsud got are said to be the original inhabitants of Rew&ri, and besides Lalbeg they affect the Devi . Early marriage is the role and the wedding rites are performed by a* Brahman* Never* theless the Sdrsud, though they observe Hindu customs, bury their dead, because, they say, their ancestors once worshipped the goddess Bai. The Hindu Ghuhyis in Sirmdr appear to be mainly Balmfkfs, They are divided into the following septs Bhatla or Dhaukta, Rawat, Haled, Daung, Dhanak, Megh, Hari, Alazbi, Balmiki, of which the latter are found in N&han tahsil. Four got* are avoided in mariiage. Weddings are solemnised by their own gurds, who form a distinct, i.e., Phirha called Meora, resemb ling the pddhaa of the Hindus, but are said to take food ( kachchi roti and pokTci) and water from all Chuhras. The Balmlki's and Mazbxs intermarry on equal terms. Balmfk and Gurd Rdm Bdi are worshipped, but not L41beg. Balmik has a malc&n (pakka or Mehcha ) in front of which a fire is lighted, and on this ghi is poured. Offerings made to i,t are given to Bhangi fakirs who are taken from the ranks of the Chuhras. The Balmlkfs do not marry, eat or drink with the other groups, as they regard them as inferior. At weddings the ckhaman fulfills the functions of a Brahman, and conducts the 7 pkeras. Girls, or sddhua of their own, are fed in lieu of Brahmans. If a Bhangi marry a woman of another caste he is fined, but his children are regarded as legitimate. The dead are both burnt or buried, ac- cording to the means of the family, burial being cheaper. Daughters may inherit in default of sons, if their father bequeaths or gives his property to them. A wife can be divorced but a panchdyat can award her maintenance. In Nahan town each mohdlla (and there are seven) has its panch. A chaudhri is appointed by the State and he nominates the panch. In Paonta tahsil the Chuhras do not intermarry with the Chan gars. They have their own Brahmans who solemnise marriages. The latter do not drink water from the hands of, or accept food from, the Chuhras, but they may take dtta and dal and cook it for them- selves. Any man can enter the Chuhra caste. He is struck five times on the waist with a broom in the name of Balmlk and made to pay a fine. Then the Cbuh^s eat with him and he is free of the caste. Funeral ceremonies. They carry their dead on a bier. On a place midway between their house and the burial ground they place the bier and offer pinda (e) or funeral cakes to the manes of the dead. The bier is then carried to the burial ground where a grave is dug and the dead body is laid in it with its face turned towards the Ganges. The grave is then filled up and in the way everybody breaks a straw. Some say that this means that all connections with the deceased are now broken up. On the third day all persons who carried >h^ bier are feasted. If the party be a rich man, the whole barddri is fed. The L&lbegi may be regarded as a Hinduised Chuhra, just as the Mazbi or Rangreta is a Sikh convert, and the Musaili, Hal&lkhor or Kut&na a ChuhiA convert to Islam. The Chuhras have Bmbmans of their own, who do not, however, work as Cbuhyas, but live on the gifts and fees paid to them by their patrons. These Brahmans do not eat food cooked by Clruh?as, or smoke with them (except in Kangfa where, it is said, they do smoke with Chuhf&B) ; though they do not avoid contact (chhdt) with them like other Brahmans. These Brahmn ns merry among themselves and burn* their dead. Their yotra is said to be Batn Bhardwaji and they wear rosaries of rudrdhsh beads aud the tile a oti their foreheads like regular Brahmans. Once a year the Brahman gurd celebrates a bfmnddra or feast at which all the sweepers assemble and offer him gifts in cash or kind. # An account from Karnal ascribes the origin of the Dh^naks to fi, woman’s incestuous passion for her son.

These Mir&sis received rations but not cooked food for their services. L In Disi.— A sect of Musalm&ns who approach to Hinduism. It was founded by L61 D&a, a Meo of Alwar, who though like all Meos a Musalradn by faith, followed, again like all Meos, Hindu observances. He was born about 1540 A.I)., and the account of his iife and teachings which* follows is taken from Powlett’s Gazetteer of Alwar, pp. 53 et seq. The devotees of the sect are called S&dhs. The worship consists largely of repeating the name of R&m, and Sunday is their high-day. Yet Ldl D&g was a Musalm&u, is considered to be a Pir, and the greater number of his followers, in the Mew&t proper at least, are Musalm&n Meos, though on the Punjab border, where the spread of education has made the Meos better Muhammadans, the L&1 D&sis are usually Hindu Baui&s and carpenters. L41 D&s lived many years at Dhaoli Dhab, and used to wander over tho hills behind Alwar, aiul into the fort in search of sticks, by selling which he got his living. At length he began to work miracles. An excited elephant stopped in full career and saluted him, and a Musalman saint, one Chishti Gadan, of Tijara, found him standing in the air in meditation. The Musalman conversed with Lai Pas. and discovering his piety and unworld- liness, enjoined him to teach both Hindus and Musahnans. After this Lai Das went and lived at Bandoli, 1(5 miles north-east of Alwar, in the Kdiugarh pargami. There ‘belaboured for his own support and the good of others.’ IIo lived on the top of a hill, and wont through great austerities in the hottest weathor, was safe from snake and from tiger , and cured the sick. Disciples of all castes collected round him, and one, an oilman, received from him miraculous power, which h« used to expose an adulteress before an assembly. For this L&l Dae reproved him, and eventually resumed his gift. Lai Das prayed that ho might be relieved of all his false disciples, so persecution from a Mughal official began, and they all fell away. It arose from Lai Das 1 having caused the death of a Mughal who had laid hands on another man’s wife, and with his true followers he was carried to Bahidarpur, a few miles off. The Muhammadan fa ujddr of Bahadarpur expressed surprise at his being followed by both Hindus and Musalmans, and asked him what he was. Lai D&s replied that tho question was a foolish one —what he was in truth he knew not, but he got his garment, the flesh, in a Meo’s house. The fa ujddr demanded Rs. 5 apiece from tho party as the price of releasing them, but they would pay nothing, and then the faujddt gave them water from a poisonous well, the only result of which was that the well became sweet, and was known afterwards as ‘ the sugar well/ On another occasion Lai Das was assaulted by Mughals, and called to his protection angels, who slew 14 of them, but his followers, thinking that anger was derogatory to Lai Das, spread a report that they had killed the .Mughals, and that Lai Dis had shown no anger. L&l Das left Bandoli, and resided at the neighbouring village of Toili, now in Gurgaon, on tho Alwar border, where, being persecuted, he went away. At Naroli the people refused him water, whereupon their wells dried up. At Rasgan, in Rdmgarh, he was well received, and there he remained a while. “ repeating God’s name, and teaching disciples the way.” Lai Dis, though at times he is said to have practised the severest asceticism, had not led a life of celibacy. He had a daughter, named Sarupa, who could work miracles. One day he told that greatness and wonder-working even were vanity, they, too, pass away like tho wind, purity and gentleness alone were availing. Those who possessed would attain to peace in heaven (Bar he lok ), and no more be subject to birth and death. L61 Das's son, Pahara, too, was a miracle worker— blessings onHbum and on L41 Dis’s brothers, Sher Khan and Ghaus Khan. These all had hope in God (Harjj) alone, and in no other Deo. A voice in a mosque (? Harmandir), where Lil Dis had gone, foretold the birth to him of a son, who was to be a polar star (Qutb), and would succeed in the works of many births. Lai Das received the announcement with onfe word “ Bhala l ” A few months after, to try his faith, a daughter was born to him, who died directly. , L«1 Das felt no grief, for God- worshippers (Harbhagtan'i are always joyful Boon after God spoke to him again of the Qutb. Lai Das manifested no hurry or anxiety! A second daughter was born. Lai Das said, “ I have faith in God ” (Sain ko mart bistvde) At length a boy, after 18 months’ pregnancy, was born. The child lived but 18 days, but he spoke and reproached his mother for not showing him his father. Lai Dis was sent for and spoke to him, whereupon the child died satisfied. A faithful eddh washed and dressed the corpse, and his sister Sarupa besought her father to commemorate him by a miracle The r Child’s body was taken towards Bandon (where, apparently, the infant daughters had been* Latera — Latli. 25 interred). A deep stream was in the way, but, as Sarupa walked* forward, a dry path appeared, and the little corpse was carried to Bandolj, where a darydh was established, which has still a great reputation. It was reported to Sahib Hukra, Mughal govornor of Tij&ra, that Li\\ Das did not pray as a Musalinan, nor perform ablutions, nor call on the prophet, but that ho taught Hindus and Musalmdns the same doctrine. The hakim sent for Ldl DAs, who recoived the messengers kindly, and accompanied them with 12 disciples who rofusod to leave him. A vicious horso which he had to ride became quiet in hi . hands, and a fawn which one of the Musalmans killed, and compelled Lai Das to carry, came to life. The Tijdra hakim treated Ldl Das kindly. But ho offered him meat, saying that it was MusalmAn food, and that he who was a Muaalman and ate as such was in tlio path of God. Ldl Das replied, “ Love God. God is one and separate from all. There i • one path for Hindu and Turk, by which they como and go. Whoever kills another cuts his own throat, for the murdered is avenged by God’s casting the murderer into hell. Let me be shown l ow to escape before the judgment-seat, where God himself will do justice. The good keep in rnind the fear of that day. M Lai Das then took the food into his hand, and the meat turned to fine rice. Lai Das and his 12 followers were then confinod under a guard for the night, but without severity. They all vanished, and the guard was imprisoned for letting them go, on which they all appeared again in the jail. Sahib Hukm. the hakim , had a beloved daughter who was tormented by a witch, and the nacromancors IjMuyir*) could do noibing to relieve her, and Q&zfs and Maulavis could not exercise the evil spirit. Her mother appealed to Lai Das, and he wont to the girl who in*mediately began to kiss his feet, and the demon (jin) having left the girl, appeared before LAI Das and declared his submission. In Maujpur (Lachmangarh pargana) was a holy man, Mansukha by name, and a Malli by caste, who loved God with a true love (s achhi prit ), and gave much in alms. Ho believed in Lai D&s, but his wife disparaged him because ho woHked\" no miracles and because ho could not avoid being carried off to Tijara. Mansukha said that Lai Das knew the thoughts of men. On his going shortly after to pay his respects, LhI Das received him badly on account of his unbelieving wife. Mansukha was going sorrowfully away. LAI Das, however, forgave him, and called him back and comforted him, just as a mother takes into her arms and consoles a child whom she has corrected. An Agra merchant was shipwrecked. He asked for advice. So mo said one thing, some another, but he remembered LAI Das and called on him, promising him a tithe if Ins goods were saved. LAI Das hoard the prayer of the distant merchant, and showed emotion. The goods wore saved. However, Lai Das refused his thank-offering, as he had no need of wealth, but told him to give it to Vishnu sddhs. A Kayath of Agra, of great wealth and of high position, was afflicted by leprosy or some foul skin disease, which made life a burden to him. Hearing of Lai Das’s goodness to the shipwrecked merchant, lie went to him at the full moon, Lai Das’s chief day of reception. The saint told the Kayath to give all his goods in charity and abandon the world. Jn token of his having forsaken all pride and woraliness, ho was to blacken his face, mount a donkey, and hang a gourd on his back. Ho obeyed, and on his subsequently bathing at the junction of the rivers at Allahabad, his body became as pure as gold. Various other miracles of tho same type are related in the account of Lai l)as, who prevents an eclipse of the sun, predicts the famine of S. 1884, feeds Nriga CHran Das of Mathura, who comes to him with 700 followers. The Meos having carried off his buffaloes, Lai Das prophesied that the Mewat should belong to the Kuchwahas and their chief Jai Singh. Before his death, LAI Das having met with one Tliakuria of Chapra, who main- tained himself and fed others out of the proceeds of his own labour, and was blessed by God with tho necessary virtues, wished to appoint him his successor, but Tliakuria declined tho honour as being unworthy of it, and Lai Das gave him the choice of burial alive or acceptance of authority.

The. word is apparently a corruption of Brahman, the Tibetan form being hlama. Ono of the most peculiar features of the lamaic system is the hierarchy from which it takes its name. The teaching of Buddha included an elaborate monastic system, but no priests, for there was no j god to worship or ceremonies to perform, and no hierarchy, for all men were equal. And till about A» D, 1400 the lamas or monks of Tibet recognised ho supreme head of the faith. But about that time the abbot of the G&hld&n monastery near Lhdsa proclaimed himself the P atriarch of tlje whole lamaic priesthood, and his successor, of the aBhi monastery, declared the graud Idmds to be the perpetual re- incarnations of one of the Bodhisatvas or semi-Buddbas, who, as each lama died, was born again in the person of an infant that might be known by the possession of certain divine marks. The fifth in suc- cession founded the hierarchy of Dalai lamas at Lh&sa in 1640, and made himself master of the whole of Tibet. He assumed, the title of Dalai L&mA, while the Idmd of Tashi still continued to enjoy his former privileges, and thus we now have two great chairs filled by a double series of incarnations. There is also a third great lama in Bhutan, known .among the Bhutanis as the Dharma Rajd, but among the Tibetans as Lord of the World. Below these three great lamas come the ordinary monks, who live for the most part in monasteries ruled by abbots whose only claim to precedence one over another is derived from the importance of the institution over which they preside, or from the influence of personal sanctity. They are, with the exception of the Drukhpa sect, bound to celibacy, at least while leading a monastic life, and are collectively called gedun, or cjergy. They consist of lamas or full monks (for tho word means nothing more), and novices or neophytes. There are also convents for nuns, which are very numerous. The lamas are distinguished by rosaries of 1C8 beads, which they wear as necklaces. Primogeniture obtains among the landholders of Spiti, the eldest son succeeding to the land as soon as he is of full age, and the father being pensioned off. The younger sons, as they grow up, retire to the ancestral cell in the monastery, where they suppoit themselves by such industries as cun be pursued within the walls of the building, and by alms and fees, often supplemented by an allowance from the eldest son. If the latter die without leaving a son, the eldest of surviving brothers who cares to do so abandons the monastic life, resumes the property, and becomes the husband of the widow without further ceremony. The Tibetan lamas are divided into three chief sects of which the most ancient are the Ninghapa or Nyimapa, whose followers wear red clothe?* and to which most of the lamas of Laddkh belong. The Dbagfa LamaUm in Spiti. 2? or Drukhpa sect also wear red garments, and are rfiled over by the Dharma xb&j& or great lama of Bhutan, in which country they are most numerous. It would appear that the Spiti lamas belong partly and the L&hul lamas almost entirely to this sect, which permits its' monks to marry. The Gelukpa sect was founded about A. D. 1400 by the first great lama of G&hld&n, and its followers are distinguished by yellow garments, the sect prevails chiefly in Tibet, and both the Dalai and the TasHi lamas belong to it. * In Spiti the younger sons of a landowner, the younger brothers of a Khano-chhen-pa, are sent in childhood to Buddhist monasteries in which they spend their lives, unless, in the event of the Khang-ohhen-pa failing to beget issue, one of them elects to abandon the monastic life and take his eldest brother’s place in the family. It is only rarely that the son of a dutal-pa, or cottager, becomes a monk. It is also open to the eldest son to enter a monastery, in which , case his next brother will marry and inherit the fathers' land. Some- times however, the son of a dutal-pa does become a monk. The { >rofession is thus confined as a rule to the younger sons of the regular andholders, who take to it of necessity, but get as maintenance the produce of a field set aside as tdo or da-zhing (from i/awa, a synonym for lama ), It is, however, only the second son who is entitled to claim da-zhing, and many do not take it from their elder brothers, but have all in common with him, including their income from begging, funeral fees, etc.* This is to the advantage of the elder brother, as a celibate monk’s expenses are of course very small. When there are more than two brothers, tlieyounger ones, though they cannot get da-zhing , are consider- ed entitled to some subsistence allowance from the head of the family, but in return they do certain kinds of work for him in the summer, during which season only the elder monks remain in the monasteries. For the instance, as long as they are tsun-pa or ge-tsul, that is, neophytes or deacons, and not gelong , or fully ordained monks or priests, they will carry loads and do all field work except ploughing : when gelong they will cook, feed cattle and sheep, and do other domestic services, but not carry loads or cut grass or wood. But 1 once a monk always a monk ’ is not the law in Spiti. Supposing the head of a family to die and leave a young widow, with no son or a son of tender age only, then the younger brother, if there is one, almost always elects to leave the monastery, and thereupon he is at once considered his brother's widow’s husband. She cannot object, nor is any. marriage ceremony necessary .+ If there was a son by the elder brother, he of course suc- ceeds when of full age, and his mother and uncle retire to the small > house, and the other sons, if any, go into the monasteries in the usual way. So, again, if the head of the family has only daughters, and, having given up hope of getting a son, wishes to Inarry one of his daughters and take her husband into the house as his son.and heir, • * Nevertheless ifl most holdings a plot of from one to half a \\hal will be found in the occupation of the lama brother or uncle of the head of the family. It is ploughed and sown by the latter, but the l&ma provides the seed and gets the whole produce. The da-zhing reverts of course to the head of the family on the death of the lama. The eldest son, or if he has a call to become a monk, the next son, who has not turned * Zdmo, alone goes through the marriage ceremony with the bride. The cfcief rite at the wedding appears to consist in making a cake or ntizar, (lit. * picture ’) of satu or flour which is worshipped and then thrown away, outside the hamlet' to avert evils. Lama orders in Spiti . it generally happens that the younger brother in the monastery objects, and says he will leave the priesthood and beget a son. In such cases his right to do so is generally allowed : sometimes he will marry a wife jfco himself, and put his elder brother in the small house, sometimes, by Agreement, he will cohabit with his sister-in-law in hope of getting a son by her. A monk who throws off the frock in this way has to pay a fine to his monastery. Many decline to become laymen : Sir James Lyall believed* that this was a rule in the case of thoBe who have attain-* ed to the grade of gelong . Where the lama brother declines, then it is agreed that, in the lower part of the valley (i.e. Kothis Pin and Sham), the father or widow-mother can take a son-in-law to live in the house and succeed as son and heir, and no kinsmen (if there are any) can object. In Spiti the monks of Pin are of the Drnkhpa, and nob of theGelukpa or celibate class to which those of the other four monasteries, Ki, Dankhar or L6wopi, Tabo and Tang-gyut, belong. They marry in imitation of their patron saint Guru Rimbochi, though in their books marriage is not approved of : this saint founded several orders, of which that to which the monks of Pin belong is the most ancient, and is called Ngyangma. The wives and families of the monks live not in the monasteries, but in small houses in the villages. Every son of a lama or monk becomes a buzhan , which is the name given to a low order of strolling monks or friars. There are nineteen familios of these buzhans in Pin Kotbi, Sometimes the younger son of a land- holder becomes a buzhan in preference to going into the monastery. Those buzhans are a very curious set of people, they get a living by wandering in small parties through all * the neighbouring countries, stopping at every village, and acting plays, chanting legends, and dancing like whirling dervishes, many also trade in a small way by bartering grain for salt with the Tibetans, and then exchanging the salt with the Kanaur people for iron, buck-wheat, or honey, they also often undertake to carry loads for travellers across the passes, as substitutes for the landholders. They dress much like other monks, but, instead of shaving their heads, wear their hair iu long straight twists, which gives them a very wild appearance. According to the story told to Sir James Lyall in Spiti the buzhan order was found by one Thang-thong Gi&lpo (lit. ‘king of the desert) under the following circumstances: — A certain king of Lhdsa perverted the people of Tibet from Buddhism to a new religion of his own. He succeeded so well that in the course of fifty years the old faith was quite forgotten, and the Om mdni padme hun , or sacred ejaculation, quite disused. To win back the people, Tsan-rezig, the divinity worshipped at Trilofaftth, caused an incarnation of himself to be born in a king’s house in the person of Thaug-thong Qi&lpo • the child grew up a saint and a reformer, he saw that it was impossible to reclaim the people by books, and he therefore adopted the dress since worn by the buzhans, $,nd spent his life in wandering from village to village, offering to amuse the people by acting miracle-plays on condition of their repeating after him the chorus Om mdni padme hom whenever it occurred in the chants or recitation. In this way the people became again accustomed to repeat the sacred sentence, “ their mouths became purified,” and Lima death customs, 22 the religion of Buddha revived. There is something rather impres- sive about the performances of these luzhans . The lamas of the various sects in Spiti have next to nothing to do with the burial or burning of the dead, since those functions are in the hands of a certain class of people called joba (pronounced joa). This class is however unknown in Upper Kanaur, L&hul and Lad&kb, As Spiti is a woodless country burning is seldom resorted to, except in the case of a prominent lama who has departed this life and as such must be burnt. The dead are also buried, sometimes in fields or near them, in places which belong to the family, and sometimes under rocks : while strangers, poor people and more especially children, even those of the well-to-do, are thrown into the streams. A fourth custom, very common in Spiti, but unknown in Phu and its neighbourhood, is the rending of the corpse in pieces, which afford a welcome meal to fish and to the Lammergeiers which aro called jajin or jazas, A Idma especially a Grent L&rna, must always be careful when on his death-bed to depart from this world in the posture of a sitting Buddha. If he quits it without assuming that vseafced attitude his learn- ing counts for nothing and his fame is lost for ever. Threw such atti- tudes are distinguished, (1) the usual ono in which the cjying man cannot see his feet, (2) that in which the soles of the feet appear to be * turned upwards, and (3) the peculiarly artificial dzogspe skyiltrung. The more artistic the posture of a Great L&ma at his demise and the longer his corpse preserves it, the higher rises his reputation and the respect in which he is held by all the people. As soon as his body begins to lean to on« side it can be carried out and burnt at the spot where the chhodrten or grave-stone lias already been set up. All corpses are said to be tightly bound before burial in the tracts under Buddhist influence. The rigid tying up of the body is due to a fear of the rolangs or re- surrection of the body in which a spirit or kobbold enters into the corpse. The vetdlas or corpses temporarily animated by kobbolds, ac- cording to the popular belief, share the tendency of dead bodies to be- come stiff and so cannot stoop. Owing to this belief at Lhdsa low doors are preferred for houses in the neighbourhood of burial places. Moreover manifestations of rolangs now occur generally all the more that the universal degeneracy ot mankind has so increased in compari- son with former times, that the demons find ample opportunities to enter into living bodies and men’s virtues are rarely great enough to •enable them to withstand their entry. The lamas in L&hul nre generally of the Kanefc caste, though there are, of course, cases where even Thdkurs have become lamas . The Kanet cuts his choti as does a Gosain, and becomes .the disciple of •some ldma } and this may be even after marwage. The lamas of L£hul who all belong lo the Drugpa order may marry. Their sons belong to their father’s original caste. Lamas sometimes cease to belong to the priesthood, allow- their chotis to .grow, and are again . received as Kanets. Women also become nuns and lite in the monasteries, where the morality is far from pure. It is common for 88 Ldng^JjangAh. cases of sanction to occur, and then the abbot imposes a fine ( dharmdand chostim) in the shape of a feast to the fraternity. It is still common for both Brahmans and lamas to be present at "
