        "text": "The purpose of this research is to explore the effects of code-switching and code-mixing in Bulilima district of Matabeleland, South province in Zimbabwe where Kalanga and IsiNdebele co-exist as mother tongue and second languages respectively. Basically, the objective of the study is to establish the effects of code-switching and code-mixing in the learning of the target language in either code-switching or code-mixing in bilingual areas. The study is conducted in Bulilima District of Matabeleland South. The mother tongue interference in the learning of the second language results in code-switching and code-mixing. This inquiry employed a qualitative research paradigm and focused on two purposively sampled schools comprising one primary school and one secondary school. The sample consisted of six primary teachers, two IsiNdebele secondary school teachers, one primary school Teacher-in-Charge (TIC) and one secondary school Head of Department (HOD). The interview and observation instruments are used for collection of research data. Collected data is presented and analysed through use of tables and descriptive statistics. Revealed in the study is that code-switching and code-mixing are indispensable phenomena in bilingual and multilingual communities. Precisely, both phenomena are inevitable as people happen to code-switch and code-mix when they are acquainted with two or more languages spoken in a particular area. While code-switching and code-mixing have a negative effect on the development of the dominated language, they may be considered as useful strategy in the classroom since they clarify, reiterate and influence continuity in a language discourse.\n\nThe present study is a longitudinal study of approximately 26 months on an Indonesian child, who has been through second language acquisition in Japan. A Longitudinal study is a research design that involves repeated observations of the same variables over long periods. The acquisition process took place for about four years. After returning to Indonesia, the family wants to keep the child’s second language and do some second language maintenance. While in her process to be bilingual, she experienced a process of code switching and code-mixing in her daily life using the mother tongue, Indonesian, and her second language, Japanese. This research focuses on how the child maintains her second language and how the bilingual process's phenomena occur through interactions in the family environment. Several language transfers from the second language to the first language occur in their daily life using Indonesian. This study uses an ethnographic research approach. Conducting ethnographic research requires a long-term process by making detailed notes about the group's behavior and beliefs from time to time. Observation and interviews are the procedures used in data collection in the field. The transfer language process is used through the code-mixing, code-switching, and preservation process of the second language after returning home. The results show that the child both uses language systems in each language and sometimes mixes between languages, as she has her languages.\n\nIn the context of EFL teaching and learning processes, the study sought to: (1) characterize the form of code switching; (2) characterize the causative factors of code switching; (3) characterize the form of code mixing; and (4) characterize the causative factors of code mixing (a sociolinguistic analysis). Year two semester two for students pursuing Bachelor of Arts with Education in Kibogora Polytechnic took part in this study. Data cards and recording devices were employed as research instruments. Recording and transcription techniques are used in the data collection process. The study's findings showed that codeswitching occurs in EFL teaching and learning processes when students convert from Kinyarwanda to English (external form) and from English to Kinyarwanda (internal form). On the other hand, word, phrase, and sentence-level code mixing occurs. The speaker's objectives and purpose, the speech environment, the presence of a third party, changing the subject, and the speaker's personality are the elements that cause codeswitching. In the meantime, limited code usage, habits, function and purpose, and elements about speakers' multilingualism are what lead to code-mixing.\n\nMultilanguage speakers have noticed a common pattern with multiple utterances being used, this phenomenon is code-switching or (CS). The key goal of this review is to explore the behaviors of learners and educators regards the CS utilize in educational classes. For both, the teachers and students in classrooms, it reflects on the causes and roles of CS. It also illustrates numerous influences impacting code-switching and a range of forms of CS. Furthermore, it mentions the motivations of CS. It is hypothesized that, for bilingual students, alternating in foreign language systems, between two languages is considered a beneficial communication technique and facilitates educators in communicating concepts to their students and clarifying them. This review covers six studies related to the attitudes of teachers and learners to the CS implementation in the field of Educational Curriculum. The study concludes that CS might be one of the instructional methods that is motivating and efficient to be used in the field of education.\n\nIn this study we examine aspects of the overall organization of bilingual conversation during talk-in-interaction among members of a close-knit family network. Code Alternation, prototypically seen as the contiguous juxtaposition of semiotic systems in such a way that the participants interpret the juxtaposition as such (Auer 1995: 116), is a common conversational practice in bilingual communities. Taking a Conversation Analytic approach as our point of departure, we analyze code alternation and code-mixing practices in naturally occurring conversations among family members of the bilingual in Greek and Turkish Muslim community of Rhodes. Firstly, we examine Greek/Turkish alternation as a conversational strategy with clear discourse functions (Auer 1995; 1998). Secondly, we see the non-prototypical uses of both languages in the same conversation, i.e. instances of the alternating use of the Bilingual Medium, Greek and Turkish that is neither negotiable nor repairable, as cases that exceed the limits of same medium or “a base language” preference as an interpretation scheme within bilingual conversation (Auer 2000; Gafaranga 2007). These practices lead to an extensive discussion of both code alternation patterns and identity construction practices. Last, we examine issues of identity as these can be approached based on the choices speakers of different age groups make during interaction. Excerpts participated by younger members of the community show a clear shift between we/they codes, as Greek and the Bilingual Medium are used to construct youth identities, in contrast to the ones constructed by the adult members of the close-knit community network through consistent use of Turkish. Based on the analysis, it will be shown that, a) code alternation practices reflect not only aspects of the politics and management of the identity of the speakers as members of the same ethnic category, but also broader issues concerning the construction of youth identities as opposed to those of older generations that well exceed ethnicity etic- categorizations, and b) data coming from diverse bilingual communities point to the need to deal with less prototypical code alternation in which participants do not orient to preference for one base medium-of-interaction, be it monolingual or bilingual. The fact that all four proposed patterns often co-occur in longer conversational episodes involving speakers of different orientations as to the politics of language and variable competence in the languages/ mediums of the interaction leads towards an integrated model of bilingual conversation analysis (Georgalidou et.al. 2010)."
