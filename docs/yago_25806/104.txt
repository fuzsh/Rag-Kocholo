Whether he’s marrying with Dorian Lord on the ABC soap One Life to Live or having fertility issues with his husband on Desperate Housewives, Tuc Watkins is always turning in a first-rate performance.

That’s why I’ve been such a fan of this actor who I just fell in love with as gay television executive Malcolm Laffley on the late, great Showtime series Beggars and Choosers.

His role as David Vickers on OLTL is so delicious that producers have kept it open for Tuc to come and go for more than decade and he and Dorian (Robin Strasser) are one of daytime’s all-time great pairings.

Tuc, who turns 44 today, has been upgraded from recurring character to series regular on Desperate Housewives on which he has played attorney Bob Hunter – one-half of the gay couple on Wisteria Lane – since 2007.
