After graduating from the High School of Performing Arts, on full scholarship, she attended the Yale University School of Drama.[1] She began acting in the early 1960s. Strasser sharpened her acting abilities in theatre, acting on Broadway, where she appeared in The Shadow Box and Chapter Two.[1] Early in her stage career she met her first husband, Laurence Luckinbill; they were married in 1965 and divorced in 1976. They have two sons, Nicholas and Ben.[1] Strasser was also married to Richard Hogan from August 27, 1983, until 1985.\n\nShe is a founding member of the American Conservatory Theater, and began her extensive daytime career in 1964.
