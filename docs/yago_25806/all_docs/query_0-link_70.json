        "text": "JOHN TOTHILL: THANK GOD THIS LASTS FOREVER ‚Äì REVIEW ‚Äì EDINBURGH FRINGE\n\nJohn Tothill‚Äôs debut stand-up hour was one of the highlights of last year‚Äôs fringe for me, which meant he was one of the first shows I planned to see this year.\n\nWith a brand new hour of comedy, Tothill employs his trademark casual, conventional feel of stand-up, we seemingly go on multiple tangents throughout the set, yet this is all carefully premeditated and intricately constructed.\n\nThe subject choices of this show include orgasming rats, mice infestations, the glee at being free of PE as an adult, drunk texting, and how Tothill funded his Edinburgh fringe run by taking part in a medical trial for malaria.\n\nTothill focuses on a handful of people in the audience and talks to them throughout, bouncing off them with ease. The entire set truly feels like a hilarious conversation with a friend, yet still, Tothill, who is a teacher, also employs wisdom, teaching us about philosophy and religion whenever the topics permit.\n\nI think the set doesn‚Äôt feel quite as random and tangential as last year, but that could be because I‚Äôve already seen a previous show of his and know his format. He seems to have gained confidence since last year‚Äôs festival and is effortlessly charismatic throughout.\n\nIt‚Äôs a show I could watch again and again, it‚Äôs relatable in parts, and hilarious throughout. As Tothill joked that they should cancel the next show at the venue and we should all settle in, it was clear that for the audience one hour with Tothill is far too short.\n\nA true comedy rising star that you don‚Äôt want to miss.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nRating: 5 out of 5.\n\n{üéü AD: PR Invite ‚Äì Tickets gifted in exchange for an honest review}\n\n2 Star Review 3 Star Review 4 Star Review 5 Star Review 2022 2023 2024 Adaptation Almeida Cabaret Camden Fringe Cast Announcement Christmas Comedy Dance Drag Edinburgh Fringe Edinburgh Fringe Interviews Fringe Hampstead Theatre Immersive Interview Interviews Jukebox Musical LGBTQIA+ Lyric Hammersmith Manchester Musical News New Wimbledon Theatre North West Off West End Park Theatre Play Review Revival Richmond Theatre Shakespeare Show Announcement Show Recommendations Soho Theatre Southwark Playhouse Touring Production VAULT Festival West End\n\nTOWER (OF LONDON) ‚Äì REVIEW ‚Äì CAMDEN FRINGE\n\nby Tom Carrao\n\nThis boisterous, outgoing piece by writer John Dinneen strikes a very careful balance between social commentary and narrative entertainment (the material could so easily slip into mere public service address if mishandled). It is a love letter to the imperilled youth centre and its inherent benefits to the ecosystem of a community, so often a sad casualty of funding black holes and lack of interest or understanding from local councils (Dinneen offers the sobering statistic that a staggering two-thirds of community centres have shuttered in the last decade). Often a refuge for otherwise disenfranchised kids who may be absent of ‚Ä¶ More TOWER (OF LONDON) ‚Äì REVIEW ‚Äì CAMDEN FRINGE\n\nTWO COME HOME ‚Äì REVIEW ‚Äì CAMDEN FRINGE\n\nby Tom Carrao\n\nThe audience is going to have to accept writer/actor Joe Eason‚Äôs hothouse, Southern Gothic production on its own terms. No time elapses before a viewer is thick in the coarsely emotional mess of a rural Kentuckian home in a town long past collapse. Ex-convict Evan (Eason) paces like a caged animal, chewing at the sides of his mouth as if tasting bile, wary and agitated. His body seems heavy and clogged, weighed down by concern, barely contained. This is a man tense with unspoken business. Into this troublesome orbit crashes his alcoholic mother, kicked out of her latest boyfriend‚Äôs house, ‚Ä¶ More TWO COME HOME ‚Äì REVIEW ‚Äì CAMDEN FRINGE\n\nTOOTHPASTE AND CIGARS ‚Äì REVIEW ‚Äì CAMDEN FRINGE\n\nby Tom Carrao\n\nGiven the plethora of 80‚Äôs rom-com film references in this script from Canadian playwrights T.J. Dawe and Michael Rinaldi, it is only proper that protagonists Wallace (Thomas George) and Chantry (Tarini Tiwari) get their own meet-cute in this winning two-hander from new company Tee Off. The vastly appealing George and Tiwari have a beautifully natural chemistry, settling into, with supple grace, the verbally accelerated, brisk comic energy the piece demands. The roles require an exacting vocal dexterity which the two actors confidently meet. The few stumbles are easily accommodated into the dialogue as two people slightly awkward in the presence ‚Ä¶ More TOOTHPASTE AND CIGARS ‚Äì REVIEW ‚Äì CAMDEN FRINGE\n\nTHE FABULIST ‚Äì REVIEW ‚Äì CHARING CROSS THEATRE\n\nby Anne Reimers\n\nCharing Cross Theatre continues its display of exciting new musicals with a production of The Fabulist; although in all honesty, The Fabulist is far from your bog-standard musical. Based on Giovanni Paisiello‚Äôs 18th-century opera The Imaginary Astrologer, James P. Farwell has created a lively operetta set in the politically charged atmosphere of 1920s Fascist Italy. The story intertwines themes of science versus magic, love versus logic, and the pursuit of identity against a backdrop of Mussolini‚Äôs Italy, where the Catholic Church wields increasing control. The production, under the direction of John Walton, blends Farwell‚Äôs modern humour with Paisiello‚Äôs classical score, ‚Ä¶ More THE FABULIST ‚Äì REVIEW ‚Äì CHARING CROSS THEATRE\n\nI LOVE TO FLY ‚Äì REVIEW ‚Äì CAMDEN FRINGE\n\nby Tom Carrao\n\nA newly christened pilot, still in graduating attire, giddily awaits his inaugural flight. He bounces about the stage in anticipatory cheer, chatting to the audience, marvelling at the grandeur of aerodynamics, breathless at the ahead-of-the-times aeronautical scribblings of Leonardo da Vinci. On the screen behind the sleek figure of a jet plane throbs with almost sexual allure. He assumes commanding position in the cabin, checking that controls and levels are set for lift-off. Satisfaction is achieved, and away we go! This general buoyant, frolicsome atmosphere carries consistently through the hour-long length of writer Anton Chesnokov‚Äôs (also co-director with Alexandra Simonet) ‚Ä¶ More I LOVE TO FLY ‚Äì REVIEW ‚Äì CAMDEN FRINGE\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
