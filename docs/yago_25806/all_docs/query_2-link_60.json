        "text": "Dianne Marie Vickers (“Nana”), 72, passed away peacefully surrounded by her family and friends at St. Luke’s Hospital in Boise, Idaho, on July 20th 2023.\n\nDianne was born April 30th 1951, in Idaho Falls, Idaho, to Ralph and Beulah Kelsch. She was the only daughter to her parents, growing up with three brothers who continuously caused mischief and enjoyed teasing her with playful humor and good cheer. Dianne graduated from Skyline High School in 1969, continuing on to join a radiology technologist program where she received her Associate’s Degree.\n\nOn August 4th 1973, Dianne married David Ray Vickers in Idaho Falls, Idaho. Shortly after, Dianne and David moved to Boise, Idaho, where Dianne began her career as an official radiology tech at St. Luke’s Hospital. They welcomed two daughters, Amber and Summer Vickers, who became their entire world. In 1982, Dianne and David separated and divorced. They continued to love and support their two daughters, as well as each other.\n\nDianne retired in 2016. She gave 42 years of excellent service and dedication to St. Luke’s. Her life began anew when her daughter, Summer, and her son-in-law, Brian Walsh, brought three grandchildren into the world — Makena, Tiernan, and Cian. She encouraged, supported, and loved them with her whole heart. At this time, Dianne became an honorary “Mom” and “Nana” to many others. She had a bright, beautiful spirit that touched everyone she met. She was the perfect combination of sass, silliness, and pure love.\n\nDianne’s greatest passions were gardening, photography, traveling, adventuring, and gathering with family and friends. Her favorite place to retreat was always in nature, whether it be tending to the garden in her yard, camping in the mountains, or relaxing by the ocean on vacation. She was an avid shopper for home goods and had a special eye for decorating. Above all, she adored spending time with her grandchildren, no matter what they did together. Every moment was a precious one to her.\n\nDianne is survived by her daughter Amber Vickers; her daughter Summer Walsh and husband Brian Walsh; her three grandchildren Makena Walsh, Tiernan Walsh, and Cian Walsh; her brother Mike (Lupe) Kelsch; her brother Brad (Marlene) Kelsch; her brother Alan (Cathy) Kelsch; and many nieces, nephews, cousins, and several very dear friends.\n\nDianne is preceded in death by her former spouse David Vickers; her parents Ralph and Beulah Kelsch; her niece Kelli Kelsch; and her close family friend Katrina Castillo.\n\nThe family would like to thank the providers, nurses, and cardiac rehab team at St. Luke’s for playing such an integral part in her care over the past year. The family would also like to thank close friends and loved ones for continuing to watch over and support her throughout her journey.\n\nA celebration of life is scheduled for Friday, August 4th, 2023 at Still Water Hollow in Nampa, Idaho at 3PM. We hope anyone and everyone who knew Dianne can come celebrate with us and remember the life of a wonderful soul and human being.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family humbly requests donations for a memorial (to be determined) via Venmo to Amber-Vickers-2."
