        "text": "Over the years on the Digger Man Blog, we have featured couples using backhoe loaders, wheeled loaders and tractors as their chosen wedding transport, but one Staffordshire couple have recently used a Takeuchi excavator as their trusty steed.\n\nSara Jayne Robertson and Dave Vickers tied the knot on Saturday 18th August 2018 at St Luke’s Church in Onecote followed by a reception just a stones throwaway at Sara’s family farm in the village, which was attended by 180 guests. Dave Vickers, ably assisted by Sara Jayne, has been running his plant hire company Vickers Plant for the past 10 years now and is a big fan of the Takeuchi brand, so for the wedding day there was always going to be plant involved, but the couple were keen to do something a bit different in terms of transport from the church to the reception. They came up with an idea to have a bench seat made up to fit on the front of one of their Takeuchi TB175’s. The job of fabricating the bench went to William Summerfield who was Dave’s best man for the wedding and who coincidently runs a mobile welding and fabrication business WSS Welding. Talking about the day Dave’s wife Sara Jayne Vickers said, “I absolutely loved the digger theme to our wedding. Being able to bring an essence of ourselves into our big day was something we both wanted to do. I am a professional pet carer so the theme was actually Dogs & Diggers, with Dave’s business being the sole highlight of the day”. Sara continued, “I am very much a part of Vickers Plant, but mainly in the background dealing with paperwork and looking after the lads. For me the best part was the digger bench that took us from the church to our wedding. With a girly touch of flowers and ribbons, the machines looked fabulous. The digger bench was a complete hit with our guests, with them all taking turns to have a seat and get a photo taken”. The operator at the controls of the TB175 with its precious cargo on the day was Tony Kelsall aka T-Dog, who was Dave Vickers first ever operator, now aged 73, Tony has been operating plant for over 50 years and is a plant operating legend locally, Dave said, “Having Tony driving the machine really meant a lot to me and my wife and we knew he would give us a smooth ride!” Dave said that his local Takeuchi dealer Parkway Plant Sales had been brilliant in supporting them on their big day and even donated 100 pairs of Takeuchi sunglasses for visitors to wear and take home as a memento of a very special day. I’m sure you will all join me in wishing the happy couple Mr & Mrs Vickers, all the very best for the future and I thank you personally for sharing your photos and thoughts with us on the Digger Man Blog.\n\nLoads more"
