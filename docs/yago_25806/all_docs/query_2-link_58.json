        "text": "It is with a heavy heart that we share the news that David Wayne Vickers of Mt. Pleasant, Texas passed away on Nov. 20, 2023 at the age of 66 after complications from stroke.\n\nDavid completed his life's journey surrounded by his loving family in Sugar Land, Texas.\n\nDavid, son of Vernon Vickers and Bobsy Hunt Vickers, was born Dec. 31, 1956 in Morenci, Arizona and grew up in Greenville, Texas where he learned skills that he would use in his construction career which turned into lifelong hobbies.\n\nDavid honed his carpentry skills and tooled around as an auto mechanic maintaining his own vehicles and lending a hand to others when called. He was an accomplished boilermaker; a proud millwright and even tested his limits as a race car driver and bull rider, proud to show off his buckles.\n\nAlways an adventurous spirit, David loved to travel and almost completed his 50-state visit around the USA, and a few countries outside including Poland and Canada. David was noble in his own right and had an entertaining dry wit. Of all his roles, the one he valued most was that of husband and father.\n\nDavid is survived by the love of his life, Laura Allen and their children Michael Allen, Amanda Gardoni, and Kristopher Vickers; sister Tonye and brother Billy; grandchildren Alex, Braylon, Hayden, Faith and Noah; and great-grandchildren Kacey and Tinley, and his cousin Dale and Lifelong Friend Paul.\n\nDavid's Family invites you to join a memorial service and celebration of life at Lone Star Cemetery in Cookville, Texas on Dec. 30 at 1 p.m. with reception to immediately follow at The Rodeo Rose Caf√©."
