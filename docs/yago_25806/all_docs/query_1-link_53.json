        "text": "The Picture of Dorian Gray Chapter 3\n\nHenry goes to see his uncle, Lord Fermor, a rich old gentleman whose father was an ambassador to Madrid, with the intention of finding out information about Dorian, since Lord Fermor knows everyone. Dorian is the grandson of Lord Kelso and the son of Lady Margaret Devereux; Lord Fermor tells Henry that although Margaret was extraordinarily beautiful and had money, she married a poor man. Lord Kelso then paid a man to get into a fight with her new husband, who lost the duel and died. Margaret never spoke to her father again, and died shortly thereafter.\n\nLord Fermor then asks about Dartmoor marrying an American girl; Lord Henry says that this is fashionable right now, but his uncle thinks that men should stick to English girls. Henry tells Lord Fermor that he must go to Aunt Agatha's for lunch with Dorian, and says goodbye.\n\nLeaving his uncle's house, Lord Henry thinks about how Dorian is even more beautiful because of the tragedy surrounding his life. He articulates his plan in his mind: \"Yes; he would try to be to Dorian Gray what, without knowing it, the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful portrait. He would seek to dominate him--had already, indeed, half done so. He would make that wonderful spirit his own. There was something fascinating in this son of Love and Death.\" Chapter 3, pg. 41\n\nTopic Tracking: Influence 4"
