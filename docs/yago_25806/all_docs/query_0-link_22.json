        "text": "I’m going to be honest…I would have voted for Slezak as the winner. I recently watched the reel (on YT) and it blew me away. There were the elements of sadness and anger and a confrontation. There’s no way she was losing that Emmy no disrespect to Lucci, Charleston, Kinkead, or Dusay. She even had a better tape the next year with the DID storyline when Tori comes out during a session and tells her Viki’s psychiatrist that Tori killed Victor and her second tape was even more heartbreaking when Viki explained to her loved ones that she killed her father due to the years of rape she endured at his hands and the alter Victor tries to come out but Viki overpowered him.\n\nYes, she was unmatached. The writers gave her top notch material, and she delivered, literally 5 days a week. While I always thought Robin Strasser was a brilliant actress in her own right as well, the writers, as she got older, failed her. Where you could say the exact opposite about Erika’s Victoria. They always gave her the meatier material. Anything a female could go through, they put Victoria Lord through that, and then some! LOL\n\nYes, she was unmatached.

LOL\n\nI have to disagree – they gave Dorian great storylines, especially Claire Labine, when she was headwriter – when they delved into her family history in the late 1990’s (Helen Gallagher was on the show briefly during that period as a character named Maude I think). And later on when she returned after her 3 year absence they paired her with DAVID VICKERS!!!! Just great material for her!!! I always preferred Robin Strasser way more than Erika Slezak, who I thought was excellent but I never loved Vicky as much as I loved Robin’s Dorian.\n\nI have to disagree – they gave Dorian great storylines, especially Claire Labine, when she was headwriter – when they delved into her family history in the late 1990’s (Helen Gallagher was on the show briefly during that period as a character named Maude I think).

I always preferred Robin Strasser way more than Erika Slezak, who I thought was excellent but I never loved Vicky as much as I loved Robin’s Dorian.\n\nI equally loved both Strasser and Slezak, but I have to agree that the powers that be seemed to fail to see how important a character Dorian was to OLTL and how the relationship between these two characters was built into the DNA of the show. Dorian always wanted to have the respect and status that Viki always had, and in some ways Viki admired Dorian’s tenacity and boldness. They saw in each other the qualities they lacked.\n\nStrasser should have been every much the lead as Slezak was, but the writers often forgot to write storylines for her, especially past the year 2000.\n\nI also probably would have voted for Erika Slezak in both 1995 and 1996.\n\n\"and to the fans, I was only supposed be on every other Tuesday. But thanks to you I'm here to stay. I'm going back to that studio on Monday and I'm going to play Erica Kane for all she's worth.\"- Susan Lucci, 1999 Daytime Emmy Speech.\n\nI have to disagree – they gave Dorian great storylines, especially Claire Labine, when she was headwriter – when they delved into her family history in the late 1990’s (Helen Gallagher was on the show briefly during that period as a character named Maude I think).

I always preferred Robin Strasser way more than Erika Slezak, who I thought was excellent but I never loved Vicky as much as I loved Robin’s Dorian.\n\nI totally get the preference between the two. I loved them both, but again, I was more enthralled with Erika’s Victoria, than Robin’s Dorian. While I do think Dorian Lord along with her numerous other last names, is one of the greatest characters in daytime television history, I think her skills as an actress soared over the material. I’m definitely not saying she had to play crazy like Viki, heart attack or stroke victim. But, even listing those things Viki went through, to me it’s apparent, they invested what would be considered the meatier material in Erika Slezak.\n\nI equally loved both Strasser and Slezak, but I have to agree that the powers that be seemed to fail to see how important a character Dorian was to OLTL and how the relationship between these two characters was built into the DNA of the show.

They’re chemistry in scenes used to give me literal chills.\n\nI wished I could find the episode. But does anyone remember an episode where Dorian & Viki were, I believe, snowed in at Llanfair, and Viki was quoting the author James Joyce? “Snow was general, all over Ireland”? It was such a small scene, but based off of the amazing skills of each actress, it just elevated it! Sheer brilliance!!\n\nI was surprised to see Robin Strasser’s last nomination was in 1985\n\nShe had more than enough meaty material to be a consistent nominee through out the years\n\nAny theories why she was shut out ? Especially through out the nineties\n\nI wonder if Erika Slezak’s reel was OLTL’s submission for directing that year. It is a very flashy episode\n\nThe only theory I have ever heard is that she made too many waves. When she was upset with an EP over their poor decisions she was vocal about it. I am not sure why this cost her Emmy nominations. The reason I disliked the automatic Emmy nominations for Susan Lucci every single year (except for 1994 and 1999, she received 20 of her 21 nominations over that 22 year period of 1981 through 2001 – there were two 1997 awards) was because it ROBBED actresses who really deserved to be nominated more than she did. Under the newer systems of nominations she wouldn’t have been nominated quite so often and in fact she stopped getting nominated once they put into place a new system (there have been several over the years since then).\n\nI believe that Robin Strasser deserved at least 15 nominations and ought to have won at least 4 Emmys. So how did she only get four nominations and one award? I think she was punished for leaving the show in 1987 and speaking up about her reasons. One Life to Live was always at its best when she was on the show and it was always less than all it could be during her absences (1987-93, 2000-03, 2011-12).\n\nGL offered the part of Alexandra to Robin. She then called up OLTL and made it known she was available. OLTL fired Elaine Princi and rehired Robin. In hindsight, Robin should’ve taken the part of Alexandra. Elaine had already made the part of Dorian her own. IMO, the show messed up the Cramer women and their dark brunette thing they had going on when they brought back Robin (who was now a redhead) and then recast Blair with a white woman. That racist decision would not have gone over so well today.\n\nI think Robin was very good in the first part of her run as Dorian in the ‘80s but not so much when she came back. Other than the story with Mel, she was a bit too over the top. Plus the show went from Dynasty-esque to a bit more serious."
