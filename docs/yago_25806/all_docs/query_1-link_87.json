        "text": "A checklist of the similarities between The Picture of Dorian Gray and Black Swan\n\n(by Nils Jonsson)\n\nJust by looking at the two covers, the first similarities are visible. Both covers show a beautiful, young face cracking. There are little colour, clear shadows and no strong emotion in the faces. Here is a list of other very significant similarities!\n\nHomosexuality\n\nThe attraction of Lord Henry and Basil toward Dorian is hard to ignore. Unfortunately, homosexuality was very inappropriate at their time, so no one of them is able to act it out.\n\nThe main character of Black Swan thinks that she and Lily (Mila Kunis, her best friend and nemesis) has passionate sex; the lesbian sex scene is one of the most famous in the movie. Lily tells her the day after that it never happened.\n\nDarkness and fear\n\nAbsolutely! Both the stories are gothic, dark and meant to frighten the viewer/reader.\n\nThe twisted paintings\n\nThe picture of Dorian Grey is evil and horrifying.\n\nNina’s mother is obsessed with painting pictures of her daughter, at the end of the film, the paintings change. They become terrifying, ugly and begin screaming at Nina.\n\nShe who tried to kill herself\n\nSibyl, the actress who was planning to marry Dorian, commits suicide after Dorian leaves her. She was a great actress until she and Dorian agreed to marry, it ruined her career.\n\nBeth (played by Winona Ryder), is the woman who was replaced by Nina in the ballet. Her career is over; she is devastated and walks out in front of a car. When Nina visits her in the hospital, she sees Beth stab herself with a knife, but it is unclear if it was Beth or Nina who stabbed her.\n\nThe bloody knife\n\nDorian uses a knife to murder his friend Basil. Later he uses the same knife to try to destroy the painting that is driving him mad; when he stabs the painting, the knife ends up in his own heart.\n\nRight after Nina sees Beth stab herself, she finds the bloody knife in her own hand. She later uses a shard of glass to murder her evil self, who then turns into Lily (the girl who has been driving her insane). When she finds out that Lily wasn’t with her at the time, she notices a gaping wound in her stomach, causing her death shortly after.\n\nBeauty and disgust\n\nAll main characters in DG are obsessed with beauty. Although Dorian is beautiful, he is disgusted and horrified by his real self, which is shown in the portrait.\n\nNina is very pretty, just like a ballet dancer is supposed to be, but she is many times terrified of her own body. In many scenes, both she and the viewers are disgusted by her fingers, nails, toes, scratch marks and sometimes even her sexuality.\n\nThe dark side (of their personality)\n\nDorian is innocent in the beginning of the novel but starts developing a dark side when the painting is enchanted. In the end, the dark side has taken him completely and when he tries to get rid of it, it costs him his life.\n\nNina has a personified dark side throughout the whole movie. Eventually it takes over and in an attempt to kill it, she kills herself.\n\nAre there any “real” dangers?\n\nUnless you count James Vane, no! In both stories, there is never any real threat towards the main character except for themselves. Instead of being haunted by zombies, murderers and ghosts, like in most other modern horror movies, they both drive themselves to insanity in their pursuit of beauty and perfection, and eventually cause their own death.\n\nImportant main character\n\nOne of the main ingredients when William Shakespeare wrote tragedies was that the protagonist was someone very important, preferably a royalty. Dorian Gray qualified well to that description since most people saw him as a very important and popular person. Nina Sayers was a very important ballet dancer; her role was extremely sought-after and her tragic death most likely caused a scandal.\n\nBetrayal\n\nDorian preforms the greatest form of betrayal when he murders his old friend Basil, who has never wished him anything but well.\n\nNina betrays her mother when she tries to stop her from preforming by slamming the door on her mother’s hand.\n\nPerfection\n\nThere is probably no better word to summarize the theme of DG. Dorian sacrifices his soul to stay young and perfect, and both Basil and Lord Henry realize that they have been obsessed by perfection (and beauty and youth).\n\nA repeating word and theme throughout the whole movie is perfection. Nina’s teacher keeps telling her that “perfection is not just about control, it’s also about letting go”. After the show, Nina’s last words before she dies are: “I felt it, perfect. I was perfect.”\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nLondon, 27th of December 1889\n\nDear mother,\n\nAs you may know, I have been working on a literary work called The Portrait of Dorian Gray for a while now. The reason I’m contacting you is to warn you about the criticism my work might encounter, especially from the upper-class society. I do not want you to care about it as I am totally aware of what I have been writing and what I want to convey with the book. Though I think you have the right to know what there is in my work that might upset people. In short words; I write things that may insult the upper class and contradict much of the morality of our time.\n\nI have spent long days portraying the stereotypes of the upper class as quite disgusting. The greatest example is the main character, called Dorian Gray. At first glance he seems like an extraordinary, young man who behaves quite properly in the upper-class society. Although he is monstrously evil, and everything he does is for his own good. His obsession with his beautiful appearance is his tragic flaw and leads him to his own downfall, just like Narcissus in Greek mythology. The same is for the other characters involved in the upper-class society. They are narrow and superficial, and are never able to see anything else in a person except for his or her appearance. This is the reason why none of them ever realizes what person Dorian Gray really is; his beautiful face is the only thing they are capable of seeing. This element of the book may therefore upset the upper class, as they might recognize themselves in this superficial society. If they do, they will feel classified as people with the least possible ability to see through the barriers of a person.\n\nI have also provided several indications of homoeroticism in my novel. Dorian Gray is seeing several young lads regularly. What is remarkable about it is that I have chosen to leave these relationships quite unexplained, letting the reader himself decide what kind of relationship Dorian has with his young fellows. There is a great difference between Dorian’s relationships with those and the friendly relationships he has with the other important characters such as Lord Henry Wotton and Basil Hallward. His relationships with the lads are quieter, and I think and hope that people will interpret this as if these relationships consist of something deeper than only friendship. These relationships are also quite mysterious, because I tell the reader that the young boys are mentally broken down and rejected by Dorian, but never really why. The way in which the lads react is also outmost typical for the more intimate sort of relationships. An example is that one of them moves far away and expresses the wish to never see or hear from Dorian again. This might lead to a great discussion between the readers as I involve this very controversial homoerotic element in my novel.\n\nLord Henry Wotton is of great importance in my novel. I created him to be a rhetorical mastermind in upper society, whom Dorian Gray admires excessively. Lord Henry might first seem like a well-educated, charismatic man with interesting and logical explanations to what life really is about, but as for Dorian, Lord Henry is not what he seems to be. If one would analyze the things Lord Henry says, his dark sides would appear. He has actually a rather destructive worldview and he exploits Dorian’s dedication to him. He is nothing but a puppet master who’s dark but beautiful words turn Dorian into a madman. I am aware of the possibility that this may offend the upper-class society, due to the fact that I portray the man with perhaps most class as someone with empty words and destructive influence over people.\n\nArt has the power to be more than just art; it has the power to change society and emphasize problems. This is exactly what I want to accomplish, and therefore it would please me if you do not care about people criticizing me for my controversial novel. I would rather be glad if people in fact do criticize it, because that would mean that they have realized what I have tried to convey.\n\nI hope to see you soon mother, perhaps in some weeks if I plan a trip back to Dublin.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nOscar Wilde\n\nBy: Oskar Wilhelmsson\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOnce upon a time there was a boy, born into London’s elite. He was born into the middle of the nineteenth century, a century where Britain was ruled by Queen Victoria, a century in a country where women behaved as ladies and men as gentlemen. As the boy smiled towards his parents, the parents decided to do everything in their power to protect their son from all evil in the world. The years went by and one beautiful day in early June during a tea party the word “tea” was uttered from the boy’s lips and all guests cheered. Loving the approval of his action the boy suddenly saw the world with new eyes. Soon the boy became famous for his talkativeness and he was always the center of attention.\n\nMany times when the boy’s mother was at the theatre or at the hair saloon the boy used to sit in the library and dream about the books he often saw his father read, for the boy himself wanted to discover their secrets. One day, his father came home from work with a package for his son, the boy almost cried out of joy when he realized the package contained a book. The next evening the boy had not only learned to read but he had also finished three books. Thus the reading continued and the boy started to discuss books with his father, but never with his mother since she never read.\n\nUsually when his parents had dinner parties the boy used to sit outside the dining room and listen to their discussions and he envied them since he too wanted to be a part of all that. Therefore he became more than excited the first time he was allowed to sit beside his mother at a dinner, trying to remember all he had learn the previous day about etiquette and social manner. Almost instantly the boy became involved in the latest news and politics and quite naturally he became the best student in his class. The boy went to a nice school, the best in London. In school he was pretty popular, everyone loved the way his sharp tongue challenged the teacher. No, the boy was not afraid of speaking his mind.\n\nRarely did he manage to understand and see things from other people’s views which sometimes brought a lot of trouble with it. At the age of twelve the boy tried to kiss a girl for the first time, unfortunately she ran off. His friend said that he should be okay; his father had always told him that women are mostly useless. The troubled boy went home and thought a lot about this, he looked at his own mother. She was always beautiful and laughed a lot but there it stopped; he could never discuss books or politics with her, nor did she listen to him. So, the boy realized that women are dull, beautiful indeed but otherwise hollow.\n\nSoon the time came for the boy to attend social parties. Caught up in his own self the boy, now a young man, loudly shared his dry humor, strong visions and philosophies. People listened, as enchanted by this intellectual speaker, and he loved every minute of it. When the young man attended university he learned incredibly much. He met beautiful people, which he thought all tended to be a lot like his mother. He also met intellectual people; however none of them were beautiful. Many artists passed the young man’s way, he was given a yellow French book which opened a whole new world to him and soon he embraced the hedonism. The man took the classes assigned for him and even though he sometimes wished to run off and see the world he did not and soon he returned to London to stay at his parent’s cottage.\n\nWith no understanding for the world outside London’s elite, for it had been read about but never experienced, the now highly imperious man one day strolled along the streets of London in his own witty way. He was bored, tired of his friends which all stopped amuse him the moment he learned to know them. Nevertheless the tediousness was about to change as he met the most beautiful young man he had ever laid eyes upon, his innocence and insecurity was a perfect target for a new occupation! The man wanted to use the beautiful young man as an experiment and the fondness which they found in one another in many ways helped the man to achieve his goal. With the intention to create the best version of himself the man started to preach his ideas and views about the world and foremost the Victorian era. He also remembered the yellow French book he had accidentally stumbled upon at university and gladly gave it to the young man.\n\nThe young man was the most interesting experiment the now older man had ever experienced; he was an excellent product, an improvement of the old man himself. Unfortunately the self-centered older man failed to understand the possible consequences of advocating ideologies verbally to some people. The beautiful young man in fact made the ideologies his lifestyle, ending in tragedy, but that is another story.\n\nAs the old man grew even older he soon stopped attend to social parties, he took less visits to the theatre and he suddenly found himself being very lonely. The hedonistic thoughts never became the man’s lifestyle; it was only a way for him to see the world. After all he did feel more comfortable staying in the safe environment in which he was born into. And the Victorian era was over, instead World War was advancing. Happily unaware of this the old man sat in the garden with a cup of tea and thought about what he once said to the beautiful young man he had once met; “There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.” …\n\nSo came the day when the old man took his last breath, his deviant and sometimes chocking views on the world had enthralled numerous people. He truly enjoyed minding his own business and his constant strive was to pleasure himself. He spoke great words indeed, and many listened, but never did he practice his preachers. He did not dare fall into temptation and passion; instead he overlooked possibilities to live life fully and was what he did not advocate. A great speaker which loved himself had done nothing to be talked about.\n\nWar came and no one ever visited Lord Henry Wotton’s gravestone.\n\nBy: Louise Wibom\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nDorian Gray. The main character in Oscar Wilde’s celebrated novel The picture of Dorian Gray is a character who has fascinated generations of readers. Still today, the 19th century novel moves, intrigues and inspires a lot of people around the world. Furthermore, one can see a lot of similarities between Dorian and the way our society and the Western modern world looks today. The constant obsession with beauty and maintaining young looks is something that is more prevalent today than ever before. Also, one can draw similarities between the facade that Dorian tries to uphold that so many people try to do today. There are a lot of parallels between Dorian Gray and the people of the 21st century.\n\nDorian starts out as quite an innocent and naïve young man and is in many ways very likeable. However, being so young and easily influenced, he soon lets himself be transformed by Lord Henry Wotton. Instead of concerning himself with healthy interests and sound relationships with his friends he becomes involved in a obsessive way with Lord Henry and the morals, or lack of morals, that the older man exhibits. Dorian quickly looses his charming innocence and becomes extremely fixated with his own looks. He starts to believe that the key to success and getting what one wants in life is a beautiful and youthful surface. One can really see connections between these kinds of ideas that Dorian had and modern-day society. Today, perhaps more than ever before, many people think that good looks are the one key to getting ahead in life. Success, it is commonly believed, can best be achieved by maintaining a youthful and attractive appearance and many people are willing to go to great lengths in order to achieve that, just like Dorian Grey.\n\nExamples of this phenomenon are rampant. Just by opening a regular magazine, or even logging into Facebook, one becomes overwhelmed by all of the different pictures of “picture -perfect” people. In fact, Facebook and Dorian’s portrait share a great deal in common. Many people use Facebook in order to construct an image of themselves that they want other people to believe to be the true one, exactly the way Dorian views his portrait. Anything undesirable, such as unflattering photos, can be removed or improved. What seems to matter the most is not how one is, but how other people conceive one to be. As a consequence, maintaining a pretty surface becomes everything and working on obtaining physical perfection becomes more important than working with the inside. Dorian does everything to keep looking young because he thinks, just like people today, that an appealing surface is more important than an appealing personality.\n\nIt is easy to condemn the moral values of Dorian Grey and those of his modern counterparts and say that they are flawed. However, one must remember that both Dorian and modern people are constantly bombarded with the message that looks are all-important and that beauty is inseparable from a youthful appearance. It is easy to succumb to the pressure of these widely spread ideals and it takes a strong character to stand up against them. Dorian, under the influence of Lord Henry, does not possess this strength of character. Neither do many people of today, as they are constantly peppered with images of young, beautiful and successful people.\n\nIn conclusion, the character of Dorian Grey is very similar to those of countless modern people, caught up with the beauty ideals that society imposes on them. Oscar Wilde is almost uncanny in the way his depiction of Dorian predicts the obsession with youth and looks that are so prevalent in our culture today. Both Dorian and modern-day people are easily influenced by beauty ideals that society and other people dictate. As a consequence they do everything in their power to deliver an image of themselves that fits those ideals, regardless of whether it is true or not. When one starts to think and reflect over this, it is not difficult to understand how this old 19th century novel still is so popular today.\n\nBy Vendela Leifland Berntsson\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nChecklist of the similarities between The Picture of Dorian Gray and Black Swan\n\nJust by looking at the two covers, the first similarities are visible.
