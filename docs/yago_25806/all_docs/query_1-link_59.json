        "text": "Previously on The Picture of Dorian Gray…\n\nLord Henry learned about Dorian’s tragic backstory.\n\nLunch was had.\n\n…and now, the thrilling continuation!\n\n—\n\n[All emphasis is mine, unless otherwise noted.]\n\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray\n\nChapter Four\n\nA month after the events of the previous chapter, Dorian Gray awaits Lord Henry in the latter’s library.\n\nLord Henry had not yet come in. He was always late on principle, his principle being that punctuality is the thief of time.\n\nSure why not.\n\nAt last Dorian hears someone approach. He assumes it’s Lord Henry and greets him accordingly. But it’s not Lord Henry. It’s Lord Henry’s wife.\n\nAwwwkward.\n\nShe, to her credit, is completely unfazed by his presence in her house.\n\nI know you quite well by your photographs. I think my husband has got seventeen of them.”\n\n“Not seventeen, Lady Henry?”\n\n“Well, eighteen, then.\n\nTo recap: Lord Henry has known Dorian for precisely one month and one day, and he has already collected seventeen or eighteen (17/18) photographs of Dorian.\n\nYeah this seems normal and heterosexual.\n\nBut back to Lady Henry.\n\nHer name was Victoria, and she had a perfect mania for going to church.\n\nA mania, you say?\n\nThe same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, and her fingers began to play with a long tortoise-shell paper-knife.\n\n…Dorian you should maybe start thinking about where the exits are.\n\nDorian does not heed my advice. Instead he stays and chats with her about the opera until Lord Henry arrives.\n\nBut here is Harry! Harry, I came in to look for you, to ask you something—I forget what it was—and I found Mr. Gray here. We have had such a pleasant chat about music. We have quite the same ideas. No; I think our ideas are quite different. But he has been most pleasant. I am so glad I’ve seen him.\n\nStill want a book all about Lady Henry btw. Somebody get on that.\n\nLady Henry goes on her way. Lord Henry immediately turns to Dorian and is like, “Son. Never marry.” Dorian’s like “lolwut” and Lord Henry’s like “I’m serious,” which frankly I don’t get because his wife seems awesome so far but whatevs.\n\nDorian announces that he is in love with somebody, which gives Lord Henry pause. Who is Dorian in love with? An actress! Well this is a surprise. Lord Henry is like “aww my bby is so cute, he thinks he’s straight.”\n\nLord Henry quizzes Dorian on his crush. How long has he known her? Three weeks. What is her name? Sibyl Vane. How did Dorian meet her? After a long, wandering, and needlessly anti-Semitic ramble, we learn that Dorian met her in a cheap theater in London’s East End. She was playing Juliet. He has since seen her play Rosalind, Imogen, Ophelia, Desdemona, etc., and loved her more and more with each role. He’s determined to buy out a more legitimate theatre and make her a star. Then he drops this non-sequitor in the midst of his love story.\n\n“Yes, Harry, I believe that is true. I cannot help telling you things. You have a curious influence over me. If I ever did a crime, I would come and confess it to you. You would understand me.”\n\nForeshadowing?\n\nLord Henry has more important things on his mind than Dorian’s theoretical future crime spree. Namely, has he fucked Sibyl Vane yet? Dorian is aghast at the question. Sibyl is too fine, too pure, too innocent! Though Dorian has visited her backstage. Lord Henry thinks this is hilarious.\n\n“That is the reason, I suppose, that you never dine with me now. I thought you must have some curious romance on hand. You have; but it is not quite what I expected.”\n\n“For one thing, I never expected heterosexuality from you.”\n\nDorian doesn’t care. He loves Sibyl and he’s determined to make Lord Henry see how wonderful she is. He demands Lord Henry accompany him to the theatre tomorrow night; Basil, too. Which would be the first of Basil that Dorian has seen in some time. He’s been most neglectful of his painter friend, which is unfair, especially since Basil was so kind as to have his portrait framed and delivered to Dorian’s house for him. This revelation prompts some bon mots re: artists from Lord Henry.\n\n“Basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him into his work. The consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his prejudices, his principles, and his common sense. The only artists I have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists. Good artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are. A great poet, a really great poet, is the most unpoetical of all creatures. But inferior poets are absolutely fascinating. The worse their rhymes are, the more picturesque they look. The mere fact of having published a book of second-rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible. He lives the poetry that he cannot write. The others write the poetry that they dare not realize.”\n\nI have been to art school and I can 100% confirm. Regardless, Dorian swallows this hook, line, and sinker. And with that, he’s off to the theatre to go stare at Sibyl some more.\n\nLord Henry spends the next thousand words or so musing about the fascinating psychological profiles of himself, Basil Hallward, and Dorian Gray. Also youth, beauty, etc. Nothing we haven’t read before. Then he goes out to dinner.\n\nWhen he arrived home, about half-past twelve o’clock, he saw a telegram lying on the hall table. He opened it and found it was from Dorian Gray. It was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to Sibyl Vane.\n\nWhoops."
