        "text": "Sally Ann Vickers David\n\nFebruary 8, 1935 ~ June 26, 2017\n\nSally was born February 8, 1935, in Montrose, CO at the St. Luke’s Hospital. She passed away following a brief illness at Montrose Memorial Hospital on June 26, 2017. Her parents were Jean M. McCloughan Vickers and John “Jack” Henry Vickers of Lake City, CO.\n\nLake City, Colorado is where she spent all of her childhood until she graduated from 8th grade. Lake City is a place that she dearly loved and always considered home! Her greatest love was helping her Grandpa and Grandma Vickers at the Vickers Dude Ranch in Lake City. She was practically born on a horse and loved riding all her life. Her horse, Pet as well as all of the dude string horses at the ranch were a passion she had until her death.\n\nThe family moved from Lake City when Jack took a job working in the oil fields in and around Pampa, Texas. This is where she met and married her first husband, James Edward Blue. To this union she had her first two children, Billy Joe Blue born in Pampa, TX, and Debra Lynn Blue Brown born in Gunnison, CO. In 1954 she met and married the love of her life, Harold Leonard David. This marriage would bring four more children: Raymond Lee David, Norman Dean David, Nina Jean David, and John Laurence David. This union lasted until Harold’s passing at the age 64 in 1983. She never dated or married again.\n\nShe was a very special person; a wonderful loving Mother, Grandmother, Great-Grandmother. Sally had friends from all walks of life. She and Harold loved to go to the Elks, Cow Creek, and Pea Green with their many friends and dance the night away to their favorite country music or meet at each other’s houses and play cards. They loved Pinochle, Cribbage, and Canasta. Sally was a very talented artist who loved to do pen and ink drawings, oil paintings, and cake decorating. She loved crossword puzzles and did them in the Montrose Daily Press every day.\n\nIn the early 1970’s Sally purchased the Larson Ladies Catering Service, thus continuing her second favorite love, cooking, which started at a very young age. She would continue to work in catering; she catered for the Montrose Lions Club for 40 years. She worked as a cake decorator at City Market Bakery. In 1986, she opened Sally’s Café, which remained open until her retirement in 2003.\n\nSally is survived by her brothers, Lester Howard (Babe) Vickers of Lake City, CO; Jon Theodore Vickers of Durango, CO; and Joseph Duncan (Joan) Vickers of Montrose, CO; her children, Billy Joe (Jan) Blue of Federal Heights, CO; Debra Lynn Brown of Spring, TX; Raymond Lee (Beth) David of Montrose, CO; Norman Dean (Cindy) David of Montrose, CO; Nina Jean (Billy Ayers) David of Montrose, CO; and John Laurence (Sondra) David of Delta, CO.\n\nSally is also survived by grandchildren, Brian Fritz (Emily) David of Bulverde, TX; Bradley David (Tara) Blue of Denver, CO; Lindsey Jean Brown of Spring, TX; Candis Lynn David (Lucas) Cosby of Grand Junction, CO; Nichole Rae David (Chad) Taylor of Montrose, CO; BriAnne Dawn Blue (Mike) Bredenberg of Westminster, CO; Ashley Lynn Brown (John) Escareno of Austin, TX; Jerad Dean (Alana) David of Montrose, CO; Kylee Sage David and Kaleb Lawrence David of Delta, CO; Heather Michelle David of Fruita, CO; Brandy (Jim) Spencer of Montrose, CO; and Dawn Marie Schipper of Denver, CO; and numerous great grandchildren, as well as many nieces and nephews, great nieces and nephews, great-great nephews, and cousins scattered all over the United States and Canada.\n\nA Graveside Service will be held Saturday, July 1st at 10:00 a.m. at the IOOF Cemetery in Lake City, CO, with a reception to follow at the Lake City Presbyterian Church Fellowship Hall. Yes, Sally, by damn you WILL be home again for the July Celebrations!\n\nIn Lieu of flowers the family requests that any contributions be made to the Lake City Historical Society, P.O. Box 353, Lake City, CO 81235, or the Lake City Cemetery Beautification Board, Attn: Grant Houston, P.O. Box 100, Lake City, CO 81235. Crippin Funeral Home is assisting the family with arrangements."
