        "text": "\"My dear Dorian,\" answered Lord Henry, taking a cigarette from his case and producing a gold-latten matchbox, \"the only way a woman can ever reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible interest in life. If you had married this girl, you would have been wretched. Of course, you would have treated her kindly. One can always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing. But she would have soon found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her. And when a woman finds that out about her husband, she either becomes dreadfully dowdy, or wears very smart bonnets that some other woman's husband has to pay for. I say nothing about the social mistake, which would have been abject -- which, of course, I would not have allowed -- but I assure you that in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure.\" (8.16)\n\n\"I make a great difference between people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I have not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some intellectual power, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of me? I think it is rather vain.\" (1.18)\n\n\"You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray,\" said Lord Henry, looking at him.\n\n\"Yes, I am glad now. I wonder shall I always be glad?\"\n\n\"Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last for ever. It is a meaningless word, too. The only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.\"\n\nAs they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord Henry's arm. \"In that case, let our friendship be a caprice,\" he murmured, flushing at his own boldness, then stepped up on the platform and resumed his pose. (2.19-20)"
