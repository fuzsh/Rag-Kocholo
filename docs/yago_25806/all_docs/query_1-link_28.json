This paper was her final paper which considered gender and art for her Victorian Literature class. Professor Alisa Clapp-Itnyre would like to celebrate this piece and said, “Derian wrote an excellent paper on Oscar Wilde using queer theory and some of our secondary articles on it. I was so impressed!”"
