        "text": "The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde, is one of the most amusing and entertaining books to read and just because of the amount of wit and intelligence that can be found in it. Every conversation is a contest on who can make the wittiest comment, though usually won by Lord Henry Wotton. Lord Henry is a master in the art of conversation and uses epigrams to convey his intelligence. Though wit and intelligence play a large role in The Picture of Dorian Gray. Wit and intelligence is shown in The Picture of Dorian Gray by Lord Henry’s interest in psychology, the use of epigrams, and Oscar Wilde’s interest in sciences. One of the most influential characters in The Picture of Dorian Gray is Lord Henry because of the way he talks and his ability …show more content…\n\nLord Henry attempts to comfort Dorian by making the comment, “If you had married this girl, who would have been wretched.” (Wilde 112). This is another example of Lord Henry using his marriage experience to make a witty and intelligent comment.

One of the main ways that wit and intelligence are shown in The Picture of Dorian Gray are by a literary device called an epigram. An epigram is witty comment or statement made or a witty response.

This quote is an epigram because it was a witty response to a comment that someone made at the dinner …show more content…\n\nA possible reason for all of the intellect in The Picture of Dorian Gray could have been Oscar Wilde’s interest in the sciences. The Victorian era was a time when the sciences were becoming very important. Because of this, Oscar Wilde became very interested in the sciences, specifically evolution and psychology. That is the reason why there are a lot of psychological ideas in The Picture of Dorian Gray. Wit and intelligence is plays a large part in The Picture of Dorian Gray. In The Picture of Dorian Gray, wit and intelligence are shown by Lord Henry, Lord Henry’s use of epigrams and Oscar Wilde’s interest in psychology.
