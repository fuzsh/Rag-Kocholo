        "text": "In The Picture of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wildes only novel published in 1890, Basil Hallward, a painter, introduces Dorian, a beautiful young man, to his friend Lord Henry Wotton. As Hallward had imagined - and feared, Lord Henry is very impressed by the boys striking looks and innocent personality and sets out to make friends with him. To begin with, Lord Henry asks his uncle about Dorian's background.\n\nIn this extract, taken from chapter 3 of the novel, Lord Henry ponders over his uncles information. The passage is in free indirect speech, so it should be viewed as an interior monologue thought by Lord Henry. He meditates upon Dorian and his plans about him. Such are the two points I will deal with: first Lord Henry's image of Dorian, then influence and relationships between Lord Henry, Dorian and also Basil Hallward.\n\nLord Henry clearly sees Dorian as an artwork: his life story is a romance (l. 3). It is a background (l. 9) not just with the meaning of a past but also in the pictorial sense of a pictures background: it posed the lad, made him more perfect (l. 9-10). Indeed, Dorian is the central figure in the foreground of a picture painted by Basil Hallward and his familys history is the background.\n\nDorian is the son of Lord Kelsos daughter, a young woman who married below her rank and ran away with her husband. The mismatch and the elopement of course created a scandal, but both Dorians parents died soon and the boy was left in his grandfathers resentful care. This story has typically romantic features, which Lord Henry sums up: a beautiful woman risking everything for a mad passion, that challenges social conventions, crime and violence(the death of Dorians father), the pain undergone by a person (Dorians mother) alienated from society because she has chosen to live according to her passion. Dorians sad childhood in his grandfathers home is also laden with storybook suggestions.\n\nIndeed, a characteristic that Dorian shares with a work of art is that he links the specific, the local to the universal, the cosmic (l. 10-12), so that Lord Henry can see him as a son of Love and Death (last sentence). To conclude, Dorian is definitely marked out as a powerfully evocative image.\n\nHowever, there is a correction in the conclusion of Lord Henrys interior monologue: Dorian is a marvellous type (...) or could be fashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate (l. 30-1). His beauty is that of old Greek marbles (l. 33) and Lord Henry compares Dorian to a violin (l. 17). Just as marble is not in itself an artwork but the material out of which a statue can be sculpted, a violin is not a piece of music but the instrument on which a player can play one. Dorian is not so much an artwork as an existing entity as a raw material that can be worked into one. The reason why Dorian is so appealing to Lord Henry is not just his glamorous image as an ephebe and romantic hero, but also a certain emptiness of his image. The young mans purity is an absence of determinations. This takes me to the second point, that of the influence Lord Henry intends to exert on Dorian.\n\nThis topic is prepared and led to by the violin metaphor. Lord Henry unambiguously states his intention to influence Dorian lines 19 and 20. The theme of influence can be seen through a range of metaphors: playing upon an exquisite violin (l. 17), sculpting a Titan out of marble (l. 32-4), definitions: to project ones soul into some gracious form (l. 20-1) and synonyms: do with (l. 33-4), dominate (l. 56) and circumlocutions: be to Dorian Gray what (...) the lad was to [Basil] (l. 53-4), make that wonderful spirit his own (l. 57-8).\n\nThis last way of phrasing Lord Henrys intended influence on Dorian highlights the hidden dimensions of this topic: there is no Lord Henry-Dorian relationship without a Dorian-Basil relationship. Lord Henry wants to be to Dorian what Dorian is to Basil. Lord Henry describes Dorians influence on Basil through an allegory: Dorian is a silent spirit or Dryad Basil met in woodland and who wakened that wonderful vision which enabled him to take his art to a higher level.\n\nThis sentence is however relatively obscure, to the extent that it can be read both ways: the reader can indeed wonder in whose soul a wonderful vision is wakened: Dorians or Basils. Indeed, just as Dorian has awakened Basils artistry, Basil has transformed Dorian into a beautiful picture, and because the lad saw his picture, his soul was transformed (chapter 2). We can already detect an indisputable ambiguity.\n\nMoreover, Lord Henry wants to project [his] soul into [Dorians] gracious form so that he can look at it: he wants to hear his ideas echoed back to him with the added value of Dorians beauty and youth. His motive is ultimately narcissistic: he wants to see himself in Dorian just as Dorian sees himself in the mirror Lord Henry has given him and in the picture Basil has painted of him. As Lord Henry notices (l. 56-7), his aim is already partly achieved. What a pity it was that such beauty was destined to fade! (l. 34-5) is an idea that Dorian, under Lord Henrys influence, has already expressed in chapter 2. Similarly, the coldly detached intellectual objectivity of how interesting [Basil] was (l. 36) will eventually become Dorians attitude to his friend the painter. It is indeed a part of himself that Lord Henry can already contemplate in Dorian.\n\nRelationships definitely work both ways here. Lord Henry wants to influence and dominate Dorian because he finds Dorian fascinating (l. 58), which means that Dorian dominates his mind. We are of course reminded of Hegels famous Master-Slave Dialectic (in Phenomenology of Mind): the slave wants to become (and does become) the master, so that every relationship becomes its own contrary.\n\nTo conclude, I wish to have a look at Lord Henrys philosophy and personality.\n\nIn the first two chapters, Lord Henry appeared as a the cynical advocate of beauty, youth and pleasure for lack of moral values. Here, he is disgusted by the grossly carnal pleasures of the age (l. 27). Moreover, he sees Dorian as symbolizing an abstract idea of beauty in a sentence that paraphrases Platos ascending rhetoric (l. 45-8): the mere shapes and patterns of things becoming, as it were, refined and gaining a kind of symbolical value, as though they were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whose shadow they made real. Lord Henrys philosophy may be nihilistic and cynical, but it is also idealistic.\n\nHis personality is equally two-sided.\n\nOn the one hand, he appears as cold, detached, unfeeling. Instead of asking Dorian about his background, he goes to another source of information, the way a private investigator would. This is enough to show that the relationship he wants to establish with the young man hardly qualifies as friendship: there is no question of trust or intimacy. As I pointed out earlier, he sees Dorian as a work of art, not as a real-life person, which means he is an object of contemplation Lord Henry looks at from outside. His decision to influence or dominate the young man similarly points out to a relationship defined by exteriority, even opposition, not to mention the obviously cynical, calculating attitude it expresses. Wasnt it Lord Henry who in chapter 2 pronounced influence immoral? Either he wants to influence Dorian although it is immoral to do so... or precisely because it is immoral. We can trust Lord Henry not to stop at moral scruples and even to enjoy immorality.\n\nOn the other hand, Lord Henry is full of a passionate admiration for Dorian. As I argued in the second part, he is at least as dominated and influenced by Dorian as he wants to dominate and influence him. The references to Plato and Michelangelo (Buonarroti)s sonnets in the extract point out to a homoerotic subtext (elsewhere in the novel, Oscar Wilde uses such half-hidden references to Shakespeare or Montaigne). Why indeed would he be so interested in Dorian if he didnt care about or for him?"
