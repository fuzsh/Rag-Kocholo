        "text": "By\n\nOne Life to Live’s Tuc Watkins (David Vickers) shocked some when on Monday’s episode of MARIE, he revealed he is a gay father of newborn twins! Since the week played out, the already popular actor has become even more popular, if that’s even possible! And in this new interview with Entertainment Tonight, Tuc discusses why it was important to at this point go public with his story!\n\nTuc on going public now because of his children: “Here’s the deal, some actors are genuinely private people. When straight actors are private, it’s perceived as having integrity. When gay actors are private, it’s perceived as shame. It’s a double standard, but I’m just so excited to be a dad, I really couldn’t help but want to talk about that.”\n\nTuc on having twins via surrogacy and the process of it: “I had such a great experience, it’s all I want to talk about. An amazing woman who lives in Texas was my surrogate, and with her husband and three kids, it’s like we were all a team. I had such a great experience that it really is all I want to talk about to anyone who will listen.”\n\nLater in the interview, Tuc revealed their may be someone interloping in his relationship with Dorian (Robin Strasser) when he related, “The live of David’s life is Dorian Lord, hands down, but David often gets distracted. And he’s about to run into a big distraction.”\n\nSo what do you think of Tuc coming forward about his children via surrogacy? Who do you think will be the big distraction for David? Could it be new “swinger” Rama (Shenaz Treasury)?
