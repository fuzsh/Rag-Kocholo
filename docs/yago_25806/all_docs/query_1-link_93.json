        "text": "Oscar Wilde: The Picture of Dorian Gray\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\"I suppose you have heard the news, Basil?\" said Lord Henry that evening as Hallward was shown into a little private room at the Bristol where dinner had been laid for three.\n\n\"No, Harry,\" answered the artist, giving his hat and coat to the bowing waiter. \"What is it? Nothing about politics, I hope! They don't interest me. There is hardly a single person in the House of Commons worth painting, though many of them would be the better for a little whitewashing.\"\n\n\"Dorian Gray is engaged to be married,\" said Lord Henry, watching him as he spoke.\n\nHallward started and then frowned. \"Dorian engaged to be married!\" he cried. \"Impossible!\"\n\n\"It is perfectly true.\"\n\n\"To whom?\"\n\n\"To some little actress or other.\"\n\n\"I can't believe it. Dorian is far too sensible.\"\n\n\"Dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then, my dear Basil.\"\n\n\"Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then, Harry.\"\n\n\"Except in America,\" rejoined Lord Henry languidly. \"But I didn't say he was married. I said he was engaged to be married. There is a great difference. I have a distinct remembrance of being married, but I have no recollection at all of being engaged. I am inclined to think that I never was engaged.\"\n\n\"But think of Dorian's birth, and position, and wealth. It would be absurd for him to marry so much beneath him.\"\n\n\"If you want to make him marry this girl, tell him that, Basil. He is sure to do it, then. Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it is always from the noblest motives.\"\n\nCustomize text appearance:"
