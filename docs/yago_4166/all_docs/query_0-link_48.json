        "text": "This article finds in the found-footage horror cycle an alternative way of understanding the relationship between horror films and reality, which is usually discussed in terms of allegory. I propose the investigation of framing, considered both figuratively (framing the film as documentary) and stylistically (the framing in handheld cameras and in static long takes), as a device that playfully destabilizes the separation between the film and the surrounding world. The article’s main case study is the Paranormal Activity franchise, but examples are drawn from a variety of films.\n\nThe aim of this article is twofold. On the one hand, it offers a survey of found footage horror since the turn of the millennium that begins with 'The Blair Witch Project' (1999) and ends with 'Devil’s Due' (2014). It identifies notable thematic strands and common formal characteristics in order to show that there is some sense of coherence in the finished look and feel of these films. One the other hand, the article seeks to reassess the popular misunderstanding that found footage horror films conform a distinctive subgenre by positing found footage as a framing technique with specific narrative and stylistic effects.\n\nThis chapter begins by tracing the rise of found footage horror in the new millennium. Understanding found footage not as a genre, but as a framing device encouraging a very specific type of filmic stylistics, I argue that horror has naturally gravitated towards techniques that promise a sense of immediacy. I focus on the [REC] franchise, especially the first instalment, and its use of the startle effect, intradiegetic sound and point of view (POV) shots. My argument is that, generally speaking, the found footage premise allowed for a type of physical fear experience that helped the Spanish series achieve international success and recognition. Turning to the less critically and financially successful [REC]3: Genesis / [REC]3: Génesis (Paco Plaza, 2012), I conclude that the film’s abandonment of what had become a well-honed aesthetic trademark is one of the possible reasons for its lukewarm critical and fan reception. This case study allows me to point out some of the limitations – related, for example, to space and time – of found footage.\n\nThis article offers a brief historical and theoretical overview of found footage films and their contribution to the horror genre, and focuses in more detail on four Southeast Asian productions of the kind made between 2009-2012: Keramat/Sacred (Servia & Tiwa, 2009), Seru/Resurrection (Asraff, Pillai, Andre & Jin 2011), Haunted Changi (Kern, Woo & Lau, 2010), and Darkest Night (Tan, 2012), all of which can be viewed as an alternative to the mainstream local horror cinema. The paper argues that the two most common strategies used by found footage horror films (including the four films in question) are the techniques that effectively authenticate the horror experience: inducing a heightened perception of realism in the audience and a contradictory to it feeling of perceptive subjectivity."
