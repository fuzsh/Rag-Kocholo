In “Horror,” an experimental serum turns an overzealous scientist into a plague-carrier; this storyline is filmed in the style of trashy “psychotronic” B-movies such as Glen or Glenda and Carnival of Souls with a touch also of Samuel Fuller…\n\nThree Endings\n\nPublished by Film Quarterly\n\nWhen he saw the clouds moving around the mountain like a wheel and had the cameraman take several shots of them, Abel Gance must have been ecstatic.\n\nDovzhenko: Folk Tale and Revolution\n\nPublished by Film Quarterly\n\nLike Sergei Eisenstein’s Strike (1925), Alexander Dovzhenko’s Zvenigora (1928) is an amazing early work that dropped out of sight for many years.\n\nUncategorized\n\nVertov’s World\n\nPublished by Film Quarterly\n\n“Soviet cinema is currently experiencing an unforgettable turning point,” wrote Dziga Vertov in 1926, in an April 12 letter . . . Judging by the two short films, A Sixth Part of the World (1926) and The Eleventh Year (1928), Vertov was doing little more than stating the truth.\n\nThe H-Man vs Liquid Human\n\nPublished by Film Quarterly\n\nI remember seeing The H-ManThe H-Man on television one late evening in early adolescence; it was a silly specimen of an already cheesy 1950s genre, the “made in Japan” sci-fi/horror film . . . But a DVD explosion has caused The H-Man to mutate into a beautiful and genuinely harrowing new form:"
