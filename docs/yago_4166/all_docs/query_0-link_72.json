        "text": ".\n\nDirector: Ridley Scott\n\nScreenwriter: David Scarpa\n\nBy Roderick Heath\n\nIt feels obvious, even inevitable, that at some point Ridley Scott would make a film about Napoleon Bonaparte. As subject matter it sees him circling back to where his feature film career began with 1977’s The Duellists, an adaptation of a Joseph Conrad story which explored the particular zeitgeist of the Napoleonic era through a microcosmic example of human absurdity. Now Scott returns to the era with all the muscle of experience and budget he’s accrued in the intervening forty-six years. It’s also odds-on that any filmmaker tackling Napoleon as a subject will find themselves compared to him at some point. The director of a film shoot and a military commander have their similarities in marshalling and focusing massed human and technical resources as well as perceived requirements of vigorous personality and authority, and the kind of artistic personality drawn to studying a personality like the Emperor’s may, onlookers suspect, already be inclined to feel glimmers of self-recognition. The Duellists saw Scott offering the first of many genuflections to Stanley Kubrick with a movie made under the immediate spell of Barry Lyndon (1975), but which, subtly and simultaneously, carved out his own niche with very different storytelling rhythms, setting the scene for Scott’s long, violently uneven, yet eternally fascinating and restless career. And of course Kubrick himself wanted to make a film about Napoleon.\n\nNapoleon has, of course, already attracted many and varied movie portraits over the years. Standing above all is Abel Gance’s mammoth 1927 film, a pinnacle of cinematic vision attached to a romanticised portrait of a boding Homeric hero, dusted with the gilt of destiny, even as human pettiness and the illusive power of his own vast dreams, and those others pin upon him, reach out to promise eventual ruin. Clarence Brown’s Conquest (1937), which sported Charles Boyer as Napoleon and Greta Garbo as his lover Maria Walewska, saw the man as a smouldering crusader eaten up by the temptations of megalomania. Sacha Guitry’s Napoleon (1955) presented a sardonic swashbuckler out of place and in revolt against a world of politicking that eventually brings him down. King Vidor’s version of him, inhabited by Herbert Lom in War and Peace (1956), was a swaggering imp for whom martial glory is a religion, and the realities of warfare enacted on the level of blood feud he encounters in invading Russia prove at first humiliating and then relentlessly, ruthlessly tragic. Rod Steiger’s characterisation in Sergei Bondarchuk’s Waterloo (1970) saw the genius of war and politics inseparable from a cast iron-hard chunk of ego and the nurtured volatility of a cantankerous brat, the need for constant, provoking movement in his mind sometimes meshing properly with gears of effect and sometimes grinding awfully, even as his body begins to let him down. Ian Holm’s edition in Terry Gilliam’s Time Bandits (1981) was the ultimate takedown based on certain psychological theories, presenting him as a literal and figurative small man expressing his frustration and inferiority complex through a passion for the theatre of violence: “Little things hurting each-other – that’s what I like!”\n\nThat Scott would not make a film about old Bony at all like Gance’s should be no surprise, but what’s most initially unexpected about his Napoleon is that it’s not really like any of the others, either. Scott’s Napoleon stands in defiance of expectations of what a modern, big-budget prestige film or TV series recounting popular history should act like, when the pseudo-analytic self-seriousness and instant tabloid news-to-profound testament approach of the Peter Morgan school of writing has inflected an entire era of such fare. Rather than revisiting the straightforward martial tragic-heroic pitch of Gladiator (2000), the film that brought Scott back to Oscar-garlanded glory after one of his periodic adventures in distractible genre-hopping, or the ambitious and rarefied mix of old-fashioned epic and new-fashioned flux found in Kingdom of Heaven (2005), Napoleon is an extension of what Scott’s been up to in his late phase, which I trace to starting with American Gangster (2007), to which his Napoleon has no small number of similarities. Like that film, it follows the rise and fall of a cunning but amoral man who, seeing a vacuum of authority, decides to fill it. Like The Last Duel (2021), it mercilessly dissects and mocks the historical action man mythos Scott did so much to exalt in Gladiator. Like House of Gucci (2021), it’s an oddball blend of true crime detail deployment and distorting dark comedy, a portrait of egos and appetites and fractious love-hate expressed through the nominally serious business of business. It even nods back to his revisionist recounting of the legends of Robin Hood (2010) and Moses in Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014), seeking new facets left unexplored by earlier versions and an equally new sense of what such figures mean in terms of the cultures that produced them versus our culture today.\n\nScott casts Joaquin Phoenix as Napoleon, a clear move to reunite a winning team: Scott helped boost Phoenix to stardom with Gladiator, and whilst Phoenix is nearly as old now as Bonaparte was when he died, as an actor he always seems to retain some perpetual aspect of the childlike, playing as he so often does insular weirdoes and volatile antiheroes. It’s a quality Scott puts to work with calculation in Napoleon, to sap the eponymous man of the mystique imbued not simply by his achievements but the layers of mythologising and propagandising that started to work even before he became France’s political as well as military commander with a conscious effort to make him a larger-than-life personage. That Scott has this in mind is made very clear when he notes Jacques-Louis David (Sam Crane) sketching out the scene of Napoleon’s crowning as Emperor whilst it’s occurring, leaving out the mischievous, tall-poppy-felling details Scott invests, like Napoleon discovering that the crown he tries to put on his own head won’t fit over the wrought-gold laurel wreath he’s already wearing, and tries to smoothly pass it off as a choreographed move. This is entirely in keeping with some of the more sarcastic observations of the time, like one of Napoleon’s acquaintances who saw David’s painting of Napoleon crossing the Alps and commented “It looks as much like him as I do.”\n\nLater in the film, when Napoleon meets Tsar Alexander (Édouard Philipponnat), the young and seemingly malleable leader of Russia in a peace overture, Napoleon rattles off an anecdote about a witty remark he’s supposed to have made, only for Alexander to recognise it as a fairly common piece of military folklore, one that’s found in Napoleon a suitable figure to drape itself on, and someone entirely willing to claim it as his own brilliance. The basic proposition of Napoleon is that the man himself wasn’t that much better, nobler, pithier, or more efficacious than contemporary politicians, but he had better taste in self-propagandising. A tension lies in this, of course: recounting the life of a man at once celebrated and reviled as conqueror and liberator, thief and fount, tyrant and hero, murderer and champion, demands contending with those conflicting visions. Scott has plumbed this territory before. His 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992) approached the sharply, almost surreally contrasting viewpoints on Christopher Columbus as visionary world-expander and brutal emissary of nascent colonial exploitation. Scott illustrated the schism through one of his familiar duellist figurations – dubious history, perhaps, but it captured something dramatically meaningful as idealist explorer and cynical profiteer battled on the cusp of a new epoch and continent.\n\nScott touches on something similar with Napoleon, positing the Duke of Wellington (Rupert Everett) as the Emperor’s ultimate nemesis. But Scott resists exalting him as Achilles to Napoleon’s Hector, instead offering Wellington as the revenge of the specifically English kind of snob on a no-class scrub who’s been getting up in everyone’s business for far too long. Indeed, one could say this is precisely Scott’s take on Napoleon: what Wellington did to the Emperor at Waterloo, Scott does with his deflating English scepticism. And yet Bonaparte fits squarely into a mode of hero Scott’s been exploring since Gabriel Feraud and Roy Batty and extending to the likes of Thelma and Louise and Maximus and Frank Lucas – the angry, revanchist antihero clawing a path towards what they imagine is rightful apotheosis and deliverance from degradation, charged with an innate sense of being the rebel angel in a Miltonian universe, but often doomed through failure to think sufficiently and seriously about other, opposing powers and their representatives. Except that Scott and screenwriter David Scarpa do their level best to strip this latest example of any hint of romanticism, whilst still keeping an eye on what he did well.\n\nTackling a subject as large as Napoleon’s career is, it goes virtually without saying, close to being the very definition of biting off more than a feature filmmaker can chew, just as Alexander the Great’s has proved more than once. Such careers encompass not just dizzying shifts of personal fortune and dramatic attitude for their focal figures, but entire epochs and sensibilities within their thematic gizzards. Tales of ruined and curtailed grandeur understandably resound with Scott: one distinctive aspect of his career has the degree to which so many of his movies have been misshapen by studio interference and editing. Scott’s career has arguably been as much helped by this as hindered: the first reedit of Blade Runner (1982) released in the mid-1990s did much to give him new attention and standing and saw the film promoted from failed blockbuster and cult object to major classic, and the vastly extended version of Kingdom of Heaven similarly enlarged its reputation. Scott, working this time around with the bottomless money pit of Apple’s new filmmaking branch, has finally weaponised this phenomenon, as a much longer version of Napoleon is in the offing for streaming release. The unfortunate side-effect of this sees the theatrical release version is immediately identified as a compromise offering, an incomplete artefact. But this is the one Scott has offered to those who go see it in a movie theatre so damn it, that’s the one I’ll take him up on.\n\nScott’s opening sequence quickly strikes an off-kilter, aesthetically provocative note, as he depicts the guillotining of Marie Antoinette (Catherine Walker) set to Edith Piaf, a vignette treading the finest of lines between earnest historical theatre and puckish lampoon, the choice of song evoking a sense of linked eras in French folklore and art through creative anachronism. The Queen’s white-painted face and gore-dripping neck are proffered to the crowd: are you not entertained? Some overlap here too with Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette (2006), a film that resisted showing the Queen’s execution, and also took strong stylistic licence from Scott’s son Jake’s Plunkett and Macleane (1999). Scott and Scarpa, who also wrote the script for Scott’s highly undervalued All The Money In The World (2017), immediately stake the drama in terms of the French Revolution’s punitive mythos, a pageant of chopped heads and felled, effete aristocrats long since transmuted by retelling from the frightening counter-myth wielded by reactionaries for the following century or so into modern pop culture shtick, in our era of online “Eat the Rich” sloganeering from people who’d get suicidal at the thought of going a week without their smart phone. Maximilian Robespierre (Sam Troughton) is identified as a pompous showboat, who will when the Thermidorian reaction comes around try to shoot himself to avoid indignity only to leave himself with a hole in his face for his enemy to prod with pleasure.\n\nNapoleon is first glimpsed, as he was in Gance’s film, as a man in the crowd, but without the special dint of aloof charisma and potency in reserve. For Scott, Bonaparte is less transcendent warrior-poet than an on-the-make man of a specific moment, a sort of historical entrepreneur who sees a gap in the market and fills it with a needed product, that product being military success. Scott’s fascination for detail in process is perfectly attuned to communicating Napoleon’s cunning as a fighter, illustrated in the first of the film’s major battle set-pieces with a depiction of him leading the assault on the British garrison in Toulon, which he first scouts out personally under the guise of a shepherd. During the assault, in which he takes advantage of the general British disdain for the current state of the French as well as displaying all the technical nuance and effectiveness a well-trained soldierly mind and body can bring to bear, Napoleon survives having his horse shot out from under him by a cannon ball – a jarring, effectively gruesome moment – and after victory digs out the ball from the horse’s corpse as a memento for his mother. Napoleon earns admiring, even awestruck looks from his men, signalling the institution of a reputation that completely inverts the same image of Marie Antoinette being dragged through the cleaved, disdaining crowd: here is popular leadership sourced in success and esteem, the most solid possible basis for political fortune, and the most dangerous.\n\nExpanding on this idea, Scott portrays events usually skimmed or elided in other such portraits, in the way Napoleon first became a political operator as well as military hero, or rather, turned politics into a military arena, in vignettes sketched out with a dark and unexpected comic sensibility. Napoleon’s role in putting down the Royalist Vendémiaire insurrection of 1795 is portrayed with Scott’s unblinking eye for his subject’s unblinking eye: Napoleon’s ripe willingness to use direct, merciless force to suppress the uprising with the infamous “whiff of grapeshot.” For Scott this episode is as important as it is often skimmed over – Gance, for instance, depicted Napoleon’s call to arms and the aftermath but avoided actually depicting it, but it accords with Scott’s greater scepticism and now-familiar interest in systemic acts. Here, drawn from history, is a precisely identifiable moment when one man established himself as a judicious wielder of power, and with a coherent corollary: if his predecessors in the course of the Revolution, in any faction, had shown the same gift, they would have become Napoleon Bonaparte, or some version of him that now fills history books. But that sense of force writes in red ink, sprayed on the Parisian cobblestones.\n\nLater, Napoleon departs for his epic-absurd excursion to Egypt, where the grand spectacle of civilisations in immediate confrontation is described with an ideogram of satiric precision as Napoleon’s artillery resounds in the face of an advancing Egyptian army and a cannon ball clips the peak of a pyramid. Scott depicts the machinations of the Brumaire coup, in which Napoleon, in league with Roger Ducos (Benedict Martin) and Joseph Fouché (John Hodgkinson) and with the help of Paul Barras (Tahar Rahim), deposed the ruling Directory and established himself as First Consul, the first major step towards becoming national dictator. The coup is again delivered as a comic spectacle, drawing humour from the way it paints Napoleon as in his element in bringing his tactical mind to bear and manipulating a situation, making it look like he’s been roughed up by the Directory members with a show of breathless escape, so as to more easily deploy and reassure the soldiers he has waiting to storm the building that they’re in the right. Thus he creates the impression that he is the truest representative and saviour of the Revolution even as he’s actually betraying it and suborning it to dictatorship.\n\nScott’s admiration for David Lean, most particularly Lawrence of Arabia (1962), is as constant a motif for him as Kubrick. And yet, despite the superficial epicism Napoleon is not a reach for Leanian grandeur, not in theme nor in style. Rather than seeing Napoleon as a would-be titan in the Lawrence mode, doomed by his inability to convert ideals into facts in a corrosive world, Scott characterises him far more like the title character of Barry Lyndon, one of Kubrick’s many fools of fortune cut off from the pleasures of power that can only be wielded by authentic brutes. Feels very likely, too, that Scott has more recent likenesses in political theatre and fury in mind. This is a Napoleon for our era of social media-inflated populists and authoritarians who, partly through design and partly through vagaries of fortune, become lodestones for other people’s passions and prejudices, battle lines drawn between the “us” such figures court and capture, and the perfidy of whichever “them” arouses special ire. The great archaeological enterprise that Napoleon sponsored during the expedition, forming the roots of Egyptology, is noted but also viewed askance, as Napoleon finds himself compelled by a mummy propped up after being dug up. The sight of the ancient, wizened body, a tilt by one society at achieving immortality, taunts a man starting to hear the same siren song, only for the mummy to listlessly lean over under his hard and searching scrutiny; in that end all that’s left is a well-dressed corpse. Scott contrasts this tug of grandiosity with the messy reality of a would-be overlord who has neither house nor nation in order.\n\nWhen it comes to making this sort of movie, filmmakers have in essence three choices: one is the general explanatory portrayal pitched to those who don’t know much about the epoch and personalities under scrutiny, and hitting each vital beat succinctly. Another is the more impressionistic approach, usually counting some level of familiarity of the general run of events in the viewer and toggling associatively through vivid fragments. Many biopics of recent vintage tend to limit their scope to refine some essence of a famous person’s life, through capturing a pivotal moment or a portrait from a specific viewpoint. Napoleon hews closest to the first approach, but flirts with all three. Anyone going into the film expecting a sober, steady expostulation of history will find it a patchy, frustrating, tonally bewildering affair as it stands. The narrative leapfrogs over the period between Napoleon becoming First Consul and Emperor, and from there to his invasion of Russia in a few scenes, encompassing as that period does all the apparently trifling business of his grand battles for Italy and Germany and Spain, as well as Trafalgar. It’s all enough to make me particularly frustrated that filmmakers don’t do old-school explanatory montages anymore, the kind of technique that can compress great swathes of information and action into brief and dynamic representations.\n\nA lot of political to-ing and fro-ing is noted, with Talleyrand (Paul Rhys) engaging in deft diplomatic manoeuvrings where his master tends to stamp heavily, but without any cumulative sense of contrapuntal meaning. The other personalities of the era, including Napoleon’s brace of legendary marshals and even Talleyrand himself, one of those figures cloaked in delight by generations of political and historical observers, or Fouché, whom Scott ingeniously employed Albert Finney to impersonate in The Duellists, are only vaguely identified, the equivalents, in Scott’s eye, of the kinds of second-tier hoods who comprise the foot soldiers going out to the whacking in a Scorsese or Coppola gangster movie. Later on, Louis XVIII (Ian McNeice) is seen installed in Napoleon’s place after his first abdication, and I felt actively sorry for all the who’s-that-guy? audience members wondering who he is and where he came from. Rahim makes an impression as Barras, the cunning operator who orchestrates Robespierre’s downfall and becomes Napoleon’s mentor in politics before being brushed aside, and the film notes the intriguing sight of General Dumas (Abubakar Salim) as one of Napoleon’s confederates, a Black Haitian (and later father of the writer Alexandre) evincing the first glimmers of new social horizons. The trouble is that after pursuing the political theme early on in the film, Scott seems to feel it exhausts itself once Napoleon becomes First Consul. Or, rather, he transmutes one way of exploring the theme into another.\n\nThe focus then falls on one of the most famous yet opaque marriages in history, that between Napoleon and Joséphine de Beauharnais (Vanessa Kirby), whose course is seen as intimately woven with the general rise and fall of Napoleon’s fortunes and continues to define them even after it’s technically ended, and it’s this marriage Scott and Scarpa identify as exemplifying something about the age as well as the characters locked in it. Joséphine is first glimpsed being released from prison at the end of the Reign of Terror, a pathetic figure with crudely shorn hair and soiled clothes, as if she’s stumbled out of the rehearsal-turned-orgy in Marat / Sade (1966). Soon she’s invited to one of the Survivors’ Balls held for raucous celebrations by those who escaped the national razor, a vignette of lewd and raucous entertainment in a moment of supremely licentious release for those who have survived political terror and still enjoying a moment before the old morality kicks back in. There she encounters Napoleon, whose lovestruck gaze lingers on her until she confronts him for it: all he can do is bleat about his capture of Toulon, something she only gets amusement from at first, but quickly seizes upon her connection with the odd young officer in realisation he could be a star worth hitching her wagon to, and vice versa, given her connections in high society.\n\nScott trots out the vignette of Joséphine’s son Eugene (Benjamin Chivers) approaching Napoleon to beg for his executed father’s sword, but with a twist that invests this tale with a new meaning. Napoleon moves to oblige the lad, only to be confronted with rack after racks of similarly impounded swords, none of them marked according to owner. Again, in one efficient gesture Scott conveys the nature of the Reign of Terror as leaving holes in the shape of so many dead men persisting only as myths of martial glory and lost legacy, and delivers a punchline wherein Napoleon selects a random sabre to give to the De Beauharnais. It’s both his ticket into Joséphine’s household, and also an ironic self-description, as one sword is as good as another, and he’s the sword currently being offered: Napoleon explicitly characterises himself elsewhere as merely a handy sword. Joséphine sits and talks with Napoleon, and, making her play, calmly opens her legs invitingly to him, in a gesture that’s as much a challenge as an act of seduction. Later, Joséphine weighs up her feelings in with her chambermaid, and quickly concludes that whilst her affection for him is much less than his for her, she cares enough for him to go ahead with a union that becomes for both a perverse thicket. Like Gance, Scott sees Napoleon’s swooning ardour for Joséphine as part and parcel with his most fervent conquering zest in the opening phase of his career, but in a completely different way. Their union delivers wealth and splendour, as Joséphine swans through swank abodes that become the trappings of high office and joins her husband in the forbidden delights of fucking in once-royal beds. Napoleon enjoys the servicing of his raw lust, which manifests on a virtually infantile level, as he inveigles her to congress with childish noises and prostrate her for jackhammering sex sessions.\n\nSuch episodes ram home (sorry) Scott’s scornful take on the macho warrior ethos he offers Napoleon as exemplifying (which might be rather unfair in this case, as being bad at sex never seemed to be one of Napoleon’s problems, given the historical record of Napoleon’s relations with his second wife Mary-Louise) in a manner that clearly extends The Last Duel’s concern with such things. At the same time it twists away from that film’s straightforward and blistering sense of historical righteousness towards something more ambivalent, if still with an eye for the egregious. Joséphine is every bit as wayward and lusty a personality as her husband, and the tug of war between their mutually complicit egos and anxieties defines their marriage, to the point where Napoleon storms home to France, leaving his army in Egypt in the lurch, after hearing about Joséphine’s affair with hunky young officer Hippolyte Charles (Jannis Niewöhner), and her dalliances become the stuff of proto-tabloid news feasting. Napoleon returns to his home with Joséphine only to find her out for the day, further stoking his rage and leading him to dump all of her belongings out on the front lawn. Joséphine becomes panicky upon seeing this on her return, and the night and following day become an extended playlet of ritualised domination and submission amidst a stew of fierce and contradictory feelings, first with Napoleon fiercely extracting expressions of undying fidelity and respect, and then her from him: “You are nothing without me” is a catechism each makes the other repeat in turn.\n\nThis part of the film, which continues the playful, satirically skewed aspect of the film’s take on the historical record, is nonetheless very much central to what Scott’s take on Napoleon is aiming for, a quest that traces the outlines of the old canard that “behind every great man is a good woman,” tested and smelted and recast as a similar but distinct idea, one that traces out the way ambitious, spiky personalities seek same with all the potential and pain that can result. Napoleon’s subsequent confrontation with the grandees of the Directory, who try to criticise him for abandoning his army in Egypt, sees him fiercely turn the tables in noting their incompetence and mismanagement, rattling off a series of denunciations concluding with, “And I’ve just learned that my wife is a slut!,” one of the most unexpectedly hilarious lines in recent cinema. Moreover, it nudges the connection of the course of the marriage to the course of Napoleon’s career, suggesting Napoleon’s conviction that both Joséphine and France are inconstant lovers easily distracted by louche poseurs and needing his firm rod to keep both in line, but to which he remains fatefully tethered. Or, from the opposite perspective, that Napoleon is at once a gallant deliverer and petty thug for both. Joséphine plays her part right down the line, up to and including falling on her metaphorical, matrimonial sword for the good of the nation, and she retains a quality that refuses reduction, unlike the other players in the drama, to organs of Napoleon’s will and ego, and that’s precisely because he does actually feel something for her. But those feelings are not simple or reassuring.\n\nThe fascination for the political apparent in the personal is one of Scott’s recurring points of obsession and inquiry, and he nails the fascination for such dynamics in these portions of Napoleon. Napoleon readily confesses his affairs after reacting with specially aggrieved passion when he finds Joséphine has been doing the same: the old double standard, of course, except that the couple talk about it all during their long session of dirty laundry-airing that becomes a vital ritual in their evolving relationship. The idea of a Napoleon who’s a total cuck is a neat provocation to the current cult obsessed with masculine esteem, but the film gropes through that to another, more substantial perspective: the reason these two people are locked together by fate and emotion is precisely because they’re not normal, or “relatable” as the awful current phraseology has it, even if they are still nonetheless very human. As Joséphine’s incapacity to conceive a child threatens the Bonapartes’ proto-dynastic ambitions, however, her position becomes increasingly endangered, and finally Napoleon feels obliged to divorce her. The divorce comes in a ceremony that becomes a second, rather more gruelling act of public theatre after the coronation they shared in together, this time a stew of sardonic disbelief and squirming frustration, with Napoleon dealing a quick slap to Joséphine’s face in trying to get her back on message, the film’s most grimly amusing contemplation of personal life and statecraft fused in a sickly dance.\n\nThe lead actors are at their finest in these scenes, Phoenix’s smouldering, frustrated Napoleon matching Kirby’s mesmeric evocation of an intelligence that doesn’t quite mesh as much as Joséphine would like to think with her emotional identity: both are undone by their needy and compulsive streaks and the way neither quite has a substantial identity without the other. Late in the film, during Napoleon’s first deposing and exile, Alexander visits the ailing Joséphine out of nominal gentlemanly courtesy and furtive intrigue, but with the subtext that Joséphine’s bed, or heart, or more nebulous domain of kingmaking talent, or all at once, are further battlegrounds these conquering overlords need to compete upon and test themselves against. Earlier, and in stark contrast, Napoleon’s mother Letizia (Sinéad Cusack) sets about attending to the dynastic problem by arranging for her son to sleep with a selected and willing partner, to find out whether her lad is shooting blanks in the boudoir if not on the battlefield: he quickly gets the appointed concubine knocked up, opening the door to the divorce. This hints heavily at where Napoleon gets his tactical zest and hearty absence of any kind of sentimentality, but also signals Letizia operates with a clearer head than her son, at least in terms of what she’s aiming for and how to get to it. It’s a pity Cusack’s mommy dearest doesn’t appear more in the film. Once the divorce is done, Napoleon promptly weds the young and eager Mary-Louise (Anna Mawn), with Napoleon greeting her and swiftly leading her on to the bedroom: sex is what they’re both here for, in several senses.\n\nThe side of Scott that retains skills honed in making British television and the tradition of the docudrama – a facet of the director that has long sat in tension with his florid, decorative, world-conjuring side – has come to the fore repeatedly in his career, underpinning the woozy blend of reportage and you-are-there sturm-und-drang of Black Hawk Down (2001) and more completely on American Gangster. Napoleon seems like a perfect fit for this, and yet again Scott demurs. Instead, Napoleon proves to actually be an entry in a style of historical film that doesn’t get made much – generally because it’s proven highly unpopular with audiences and a zone of confusion for critics – and also peculiarly British. A style exemplified by the likes of Tony Richardson’s The Charge of the Light Brigade (1968), Richard Attenborough’s Oh! What a Lovely War (1969), Derek Jarman’s Sebastiane (1976), Hugh Hudson’s Revolution (1985), Plunkett and Macleane, Julien Temple’s Pandemonium (2000), and much of Ken Russell’s oeuvre – one could also nod to the likes of Richard Lester and Monty Python for more outright comedic variations. Unstable films where the familiar impulses of such movies, springing from the moment of the 1960s counterculture and later promising and blending with the impulses of punk, with their fascination for famous historical personalities and realism in recreating milieu, sit cheek by jowl was a sense of the ridiculous, located in awareness of disparity in viewpoint, and skit-like, semi-satiric attitude, with attempts to connect the modern sensibility with the period with aspects of ironic juxtaposition and poetic licence that tries to dig to something truer than what mere fact can convey.\n\nIt makes sense that Scott would have some sympathy with that style, coming as he did out of the same era and sensibility that shaped the likes of Russell and Richardson, at once finding themselves heirs to a cultural and artistic tradition and also rebels against it, looking for the down and dirty amidst all the gilt and froufrou, the proof of continuity in human nature even as history moved from veiling its primal impulses to letting it all hang out. And whilst he’s long seemed more of a straight arrow than the likes of Russell, in fact it can be said that Scott’s oeuvre has long been defined by the peculiar, personal spin he put on that kind of artistic sensibility – that he might even have always been the most sophisticated exponent of it. That’s most overt in the arch blend of genres and styles in Blade Runner in particular, veering as it does between sci-fi and noir, classical and futuristic, the exalted and the fetid, all putting the punk in cyberpunk, and elsewhere in his career he’s been fond of such juxtapositions, if usually in more subtle or purely stylistic ways. Napoleon is a long way from being as bold in its juxtapositions of technique and tone as The Charge of the Light Brigade or Savage Messiah (1972), but a sense of common roots nonetheless keeps bobbing to the surface. Scott boils down Napoleon’s march on Moscow to a spectacle of self-defeat, with the Emperor inheriting the hollow trappings of Alexander’s authority, and a deserted city he can’t even claim credit for burning down.\n\nThat Scott is also thinking back to his debut is palpable in places throughout Napoleon, recreating the method apparent in The Duellists for recreating historical milieu, particularly the hollowed-out environs of the revolution-pilfered great houses and institutions, and even recreates some shots here and there. Scott dismissed Waterloo before making this film, and as a great admirer of Bondarchuk’s movie the temptation to a little cackle of contumely is hard to resist, in noting how Scott fails to match that film’s pungency as both war spectacle and character sketch, even if he is aiming at something quite different. Nonetheless the two grand battle sequences, the first depicting Austerlitz, the second Waterloo, that subdivide the drama, are two of Scott’s greatest feats of filmmaking, as he tries to encapsulate the complex ebb and flow of action in those battles as units of expressive and coherent diagramming, particularly in the contrast of Napoleon expertly suckering in his foes in the first battle and flailing surrendering to his own macho mythos as well as Wellington’s traps in the second. Austerlitz is illustrated with particular verve, Scott wielding watchmaker precision in the outlay of cause and effect, capturing Napoleon’s capacity to see through the superficial chaos of the battlefield to both see and wield designs amidst it all. The battle climaxes with the infamous shelling of the iced-over lake the luckless Austrian and Russian soldiers try to flee across, the climax of Alexander Nevsky (1938) recast from heroic consummation as nature conspires with great leader to swallow the alien host, to a supervillain’s wickedest flourish of contempt for a defeated foe.\n\nSimultaneously registering as both problematic and fruitful, Scott’s Napoleon emerges as feeling like two or three different movies, each competing for primacy – the post-punk satire, the intimate portrait of a weird power couple, and the epic war movie delivered with all of Scott’s most earnest and technically dynamic impact. Episodes of ribald humour graze against straight-faced depictions of brutal combat and fastidious politics. In this regard Napoleon recalls his Robin Hood, which had a similarly, internally divided and clashing structure, albeit an interesting one that disassembled the Robin Hood legend to then resituate it at a junction of real history and folklore rooted in specific cultural soil, recasting the famous hero as the epitome of plebeian English liberty fighting bullies foreign and domestic. Napoleon by contrast never quite finds a way of negotiating its disparities of portrait: if it applied a formal device, like what Christopher Nolan tried (if badly) in Oppenheimer (2023), or indeed as Scott did in The Last Duel, to establish the notion that Napoleon looks like a completely different person from different angles, that might be fine.\n\nNapoleon’s career contains multitudes enough for any biographer – the man who brought French Revolutionary ideals and political liberalism to European politics also stole and conscripted mercilessly, the champion of liberty also tried to toss the Haitians back in chains, and the urges that pushed him to such irreconcilable ends, again usually elided or oversimplified in film takes, cry out for a substantively engaged portrait. In a lot of ways this Napoleon settles for the least interesting version of the man that can be offered. But, again, that might be partly mistaking what this Napoleon wants to be, which can be summarised most concisely as a portrait of power as inherently absurd, especially when completely invested in a person, even if the results of it being wielded are anything but funny. Napoleon Bonaparte is just the historical vessel the thesis is poured into. The film ends with Napoleon, sitting out his exile on St Helena with his two daughters, dying whilst writing his memoirs – Scott films the silhouette of the man wearing his signature hat slowly keeling over, mimicking the dried-out mummy he gazed on earlier.\n\nHere lies both ultimate absurdity, the great conqueror just another uniform without a body to hold it up anymore, at once a sight of pathos, but also one from which the contrived mystique is allowed to escape and haunt history evermore. Scott might well feel some empathy there, as that’s also the kind of immortality the artist plays for, to leave behind traces of themselves in the works they have wrought. The final tally of the dead from Napoleon’s battles and campaigns that rolls afterwards plays as a miniature self-critique of the list of terrorist actions at the end of Black Hawk Down: from cautionary tale about inaction to cautionary tale about too much action. Napoleon is a big, woozy, unusual film that’s never less than extremely entertaining and absorbing even when it’s also being extraordinarily frustrating. As a biopic of Napoleon Bonaparte, it’s a haphazard affair; as an extension of Scott’s late career obsessions, an ironic study in being human even when affecting to transcend that state, it’s something like a triumph. Whatever else one might say about Scott as he keeps pushing back the horizon of his career in defiance of his age, Napoleon is a film that refuses to conform to clichés about a filmmaker’s autumnal phase – compared to the way that, say, Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon (2023) exemplifies that concept, for all its excellence. The messiness of Napoleon is a by-product of its wayward ambition, and in that regard, yes, Scott earns comparison with his subject.\n\n.\n\nDirector / Screenwriter / Actor: Abel Gance\n\nBy Roderick Heath\n\nThere is no other film like Abel Gance’s Napoleon. Though nearly a century has intervened since its release, scarcely any work of feature filmmaking has so completely revised and expanded what the form is capable of in terms of artistic invention and range of technique. With Napoleon cinema finally gained the complete expressive freedom open to other art forms, even if it was cursed to emerge at a moment when a new and dominant orthodoxy was taking a firm grip over what audiences would expect for the new thirty or more years – and, indeed, still persists for the most part. Gance’s innovations, including split-screen effects, handheld camerawork, associative montage and passages of non-linear technique, and the legendary eruption of widescreen, actually a kind of prototypical Cinerama, used in its climax, and doing so throughout with an entirely sovereign purpose in expressing a personal vision, make Napoleon an eternally modern and challenging as well as intoxicating in its cinematic impact. Few filmmakers have dared anything like what Gance attempted in even a vaguely similar context, in freely and furiously blending classical narrative and experimental film technique. And, like many of the major pioneering works from the age of cinema’s fitful adolescence, Napoleon has never been an uncontroversial film.\n\nGance had made himself the toast of French cinema with his international hit J’accuse in 1919, an earnest and blistering broadside against the recently ended First World War and the sullen attitude of the peacetime atmosphere, transmuted into a bizarre stew of message movie, melodrama, war film, domestic tragedy, and postmodern horror flick. Whilst not his first epic, J’accuse saw Gance embracing the better example of D.W. Griffith and applying to the screen every expressive and technical trick at his disposal, roving through aesthetic textures from harsh realism and high melodrama to the surreal and poetic. Sergei Eisenstein took inspiration from Gance’s electrifying editing. Gance stood resolute in his belief film as a maturing art form would become something much like opera, something an audience could devote a whole day to and become lost within its expressive universe. He pushed that belief to the utmost with his 1921 epic La Roue: Gance’s longest cut ran for nearly nine hours. He followed that colossus with the relatively small-scale but still ingeniously directed comedy-horror film Au Secours! (1924), starring the popular silent comic Max Linder, a film that nonetheless didn’t see release for many year. After dashing it off, Gance began gearing up for what he intended to be the project of his lifetime, a projected six-part biopic about Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nAfter laboriously piecing together financing for this project, not so much a white elephant as an actual, proper, trampling woolly mammoth of cinematic ambition, Gance produced his film in a whirlwind of enthusiasm and energy, and the result was nearly six hours long. The shortened version Gance screened at the film’s official premiere to a distinguished audience was met with great approval, but the film’s ultimate box office never quite justified the enormous expense, in part because it came out just as talkies were talking over, an innovation exhibitors would rather pay to accommodate than wider screens to fit Gance’s technical coup. So the planned follow-ups never eventuated. Gance instead ploughed all his energy into his talkie debut, the apocalyptic epic La Fin du monde (1931), another of his fugue-like sagas, but one that this time proved a huge disaster. Gance set about trying to play nice with the more conservative style setting in through the 1930s, if still producing major works like Un Grand Amour de Beethoven (1937) and a remake of J’accuse! (1938) that proved fateful in the countdown to another war’s outbreak. During World War II Gance earned some lasting enmity when he briefly supported Philippe Petain’s Vichy government as a potential saviour for the beaten and occupied nation, but eventually fled to Spain as the Nazi yoke became severe.\n\nAfter the war Gance had a lot of trouble gaining backing for movies, but a revival of the much-edited and tattered Napoleon in the mid-1950s helped spark the imaginations of the young soon-to-be French New Wave film movement. Francois Truffaut worked to revive his critical reputation, Gance eventually made a sputtering comeback, with late films including Austerlitz (1960), a belated pseudo-extension of Napoleonic saga, and Cyrano and d’Artagnan (1963). But it’s chiefly thanks to the work of the English film historian (and sometime director) Kevin Brownlow that Napoleon is today in anything like the shape Gance originally intended. Brownlow, after purchasing some 9.5 mm prints of portions of the film he bought as an already movie-mad kid, was startled by the energy of the material he viewed, and began a grand quest to restore the movie. His first restored edition was unveiled for public screening in 1979. Francis Ford Coppola exhibited an edited version of Browlow’s restoration in 1981, equipped with a score by Coppola’s father Carmine, with the old and sick Gance able to listen in to the audience’s rapturous reception of that cut’s premiere by telephone. Brownlow released an expanded edition with newly rediscovered footage was screened in 2000. Like many others, I expect, Coppola’s version is the first I saw, but Brownlow’s second edit, with a score by Carl Davis, is the gold standard. Most importantly, this version does justice to Gance’s intensely concerted storytelling rhythms as well as the spectacle of his style and story, even if today, with our well-honed notions of how long a movie should be, it’s hard to absorb in a single viewing.\n\nJust how one feels about the men at the eye of this maelstrom inevitably colours response to Napoleon. The General turned Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte undoubtedly did much to put the ailing French Republic on its feet, granting it political stability, a radically modern governing code, and vast wealth. His swathe of conquest brought liberation and liberalisation to populaces still living under medieval regimes and worldviews, whereas the radical gravity of the French Revolution only devolved into spasmodic factional slaughter. Bonaparte’s campaigns also caused the deaths of millions, involved the plunder of wealth from around Europe, saw the crucial betrayal of core tenets of the revolutionary cause he affected to spread, and brought eventual disaster to so many who placed faith in him, even if that faith continued to burn through the stolid, repressive epoch that followed. These are the essential contradictions historians, artists, politicians, and philosophers have argued about for the last two centuries and will do so for at least two more. Ludwig van Beethoven famously offered Napoleon initial admiration and eventual, furious repudiation. Friedrich Nietzsche succinctly described him as a chimeric blend of his ideas of the übermensch, the super-man, and its opposite, the üntermensch, the monster.\n\nThe most sublime and perturbing aspect of Napoleon then is the degree to which it is a study in its own vehement, rapturous creative energy, a portrait of a grand visionary accomplished by a man determined to prove himself a grand visionary. Gance worked in merry ignorance of Berthold Brecht’s dismissal and revision of the idea of the epic, instead attaching the engine of his imagination and talent to a suitably enormous subject. Gance’s concept-cum-assimilation of Napoleon is also a successor to J’accuse’s main character, the wounded warrior-poet Jean Diaz, swapping the tattered, morally exhausted, if still yearning, beauty-seeking spirit expressed through that character for Gance’s idealised Napoleon, the emblem and sharp leading edge of a great, potentially transformational moment in history. More concretely, there seems to be a jarring gap between J’accuse’s antimilitarist statement, and Gance’s lifelong expressions of pacifist and apolitical feeling, with his celebration of a man who was the quintessence of military leadership, one who, at the film’s climax, begins the great rampage of his career. Much of this can be simply explained as a refuge in historical dreaming, a ready attachment of positive feeling onto something safely gone and swathed in legend, but some have felt Gance’s idea and images strayed too close to a quasi-fascist celebration and apologia for dictatorship at a time when those forces were gathering strength across Europe.\n\nOne key to all this is the degree to which Gance essentially refashions the erstwhile Emperor in his own image, as a pure incarnation of poetic faith in an idea of France in particular and human possibility in general, but also more specifically as an artist working in his own special medium. So, Gance’s Napoleon becomes a man often glimpsed wandering and meditating, steadily gathering his powers for dramatic gestures. His gaze cuts through illusions of strength and distracting clamour to get constantly at the essence of matters, and applying a world-sweeping vision with decisive strokes. But his vision is often misunderstood or ignored by lesser people lacking such conceptual zest. The film’s famous opening scene depicts the boy Napoleon (Vladimir Roudenko) residing as a student of Brienne College, a religiously-run military school for the sons of prominent families. Napoleon trails his Corsican roots prominently with his surname styled as Buonaparte and given name he pronounces as “Nap-eye-ony,” mocked by the instructor Pichegru (René Jeanne) as “Paille-au-nez” or straw-in-the-nose. The school has a regular winter ritual, a huge snowball fight blended with a game of capture-the-flag, where the students are encouraged to bring their nascent combat wit and tactical guile to bear.\n\nNapoleon, leading a small and assailed band against a force that includes the bullies Phélippeaux (Petit Vidal) and Peccaduc (Roblin), two future battlefield opponents, proves his emerging, unflappable grit even as he foes pelt him with snowballs with rocks hidden within. Warned of this dirty trick by the cry of the school’s sympathetic everyman cook Tristan Fleuri (Nicolas Koline), the enraged Napoleon leads a successful charge and captures his opponents’ flag, bringing it back to his redoubt in the snow. Despite his mockery of his name, Pichegru pronounces the proud and fiery lad will go far. For revenge, Phélippeaux and Peccaduc release the pet eagle Napoleon keeps, sent to him by a relative back in Corsica. Napoleon is so upset by this he starts fighting the entire dormitory of fellow students in a frantic melee. He’s locked away in a classroom by the staff to quell his furore, and the eagle flies back in through the window, becoming his symbolic familiar for the rest of the film. Gance immediately defines Napoleon through his practically preternatural gifts for leadership and combat coupled with a disconcerting otherness that tends to irritate and provoke rivals and authority, character traits that will earn either ruthless condemnation oblivion or a chance to revel in greatness: the historical moment will provide plenty of chances for the former but also a singular opening for the latter.\n\nDuring the snowball fight sequence, Gance wields the intensifying cinematic technique that flows throughout the film, including split-screen effects displaying multiple actions simultaneously, shots taken with a handheld camera for lunging, immersive physical immediacy, and double-exposures that place the young Napoleon’s face and reactions to the battle at the centre of a dizzying, more than faintly ironic sprawl of images that evoke his later successes: within the first fifteen minutes of the film, Gance has already executed one of his signature sequences building from deadpan to ecstatic flux of style and story. The boyish purity of this victory is immediately contrasted with the overtones of ethnic condescension for the Corsican boy and the disdain for his pride and ability. Tristan’s fondness for young Napoleon is signalled when he warns him during the snowball fight and later brings him his cap and coat during his exile to a cold attic of the military school, as Napoleon lounges despondently on a cannon. This moment, an almost paternal gesture from the cook to the gutsy lad, is also touched with symbolic inference: Napoleon’s future metier and speciality as an artilleryman is described, the essential common man Tristan vesting him with his warrior garb as the select hero for the people. One of the lines of tension within Napoleon as a film then is the way the film views its hero as, simultaneously, an outsider and patriotic paradigm, artist and authority. Rather than trying to reconcile these tensions or set them in argument, Gance accepts them as part of the florid, dizzying, contradictory energy of the epoch he portrays, one where the line between heroism and monstrosity are easy to trammel.\n\nThis wild, protean quality is manifest not just in Napoleon but also in the mighty figures of the Revolution, including Georges-Jacques Danton (Alexandre Koubitzky), Maximilien Robespierre (Edmond Van Daële), and Jean-Paul Marat (Antonin Artaud), who are collectively described with a parched level of irony as “The Three Gods” in the revolutionary climes, as well as attendant figures like Louis de Saint-Just (Gance himself).The opening depiction of the boy Napoleon segues immediately into the headiest moments of world-changing excitement during the Revolution, with the Three Gods ensconced in a private chamber adjoining the great hall of the Club de Cordeliers, a centre of the revolution’s ferment, where the ardent free-thinkers and rebels gather, whilst the real power is gathered in the hands of the three machinating minds within. A young officer, Claude de Lisle (Harry Krimer), arrives on a peculiar mission, assigned to perform the new song he’s written as a patriotic anthem, “La Marseillaise,” and Camille Desmoulins (Robert Vidalin), calls Danton out to hear it. The song goes over a treat, to the point where Napoleon (Albert Dieudonné), now grown and a Lieutenant of artillery in the army who’s been perched in boding solitude amidst the audience, approaches De Lisle and thanks him: “Your hymn will save many a cannon.” In this scene Gance introduces one of his flightiest flights of fancy, one that recurs throughout the film, as he slowly dissolves from the sight of Danton belting the song out lustily to a vision of the song itself personified as a figure akin to Delacroix’s conception of liberty, a sword-waving, flame-wreathed shield-maiden (Damia).\n\nAs with much of the film that follows, Gance alternates such imagery of high patriotic pomp and poetic licence with a mischievous sense of humour and oddball detail that evokes the texture of Charles Dickens and Gance’s favourite writer Victor Hugo, and artwork of the period, if closer to the grotesque and madcap human sprawls of Hogarth than the noble classicism of Jacques-Louis David, although he later recreates David’s painting of the dead Marat in his bath. Gance’s conceits range from the shirtless strongman standing guard to the Three Gods’ chamber with “Mort au Tirans” scrawled on his chest, the earthier, plebeian counterpart as the fist of liberty to the mystical shield-maiden, to a slovenly sans-culotte asleep with face nuzzled against a classical sculpture, and with vignettes of historical curiosity that evince the strange new possibilities of the revolution, like Desmoulins working alongside his wife Lucile (Francine Mussey), and a woman in the crowd wiping her thrilled tears on the tricoleur. The Three Gods meanwhile are identified one by one in sharply composed portraits, Danton all wild-haired, brusquely muscular energy, Marat with eyes alight in obsessive fervour, and Robespierre with round, dark glasses on, a black-eyed raptor with smooth white face awaiting the purification of the faith.\n\nGance notes Robespierre and Marat conversing with evidently foreboding meaning whilst Danton is outside leading the song, Marat musing on the decapitated head of a statue of Jesus lying on the floor, whilst Robespierre lounges on a chair which has been carved into the film’s recurring eagle symbol, a false and wooden edition, the light of communal excitement falling in slanting rays behind him that slowly fade out. Meanwhile without Gance cuts between close-ups of the singers with increasing speed and a sense of virtually orgasmic climax. It’s likely impossible to know if Michael Curtiz ever saw this scene, but it certainly anticipates the famous “La Marseillaise” scene in Casablanca (1942). Gance views Napoleon as one of the crowd and yet also peculiar and singular with his slouching posture, turned initially from the performance but revealed to have been paying keen attention. It’s signalled here that Napoleon, as well as appreciating the song for itself, is also a key to something important and power, the patriotic idealism that can be harnessed but which be wasted in the course of the Revolution’s darkest turns. Napoleon weathers one of those when, in his cheap and grotty little room, he tries to write whilst the deposing of the monarchy is celebrated by a jubilant crowd, who entertain themselves by hanging a few luckless royalists from lampposts and even from the bars on Napoleon’s balcony.\n\n“Fragments of a great event, seen from a tiny room,” reads a title card, as the tumult of banners and raised, severed heads on pikes against the light out in the street casts a strange, eerily flickering glow on Napoleon’s face, before the surreal mixture of gaiety and violence come close. Napoleon considers grabbing a pistol as the revolutionaries tie a hanging rope to the balcony, tempted to intervene with fruitless heroism or perhaps kill himself in the face of such cruelty, but snatches his hand back before doing either. Following Napoleon’s sad and knowing gaze, Gance cuts with an ironic power Eisenstein would surely have appreciated from a shot of a revolutionary’s hand, covered in blood, to the copy of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen he has pinned to his wall, and then shifting into a slight camera pan off the Declaration to view the howling mob and bloody hangmen without. Glimpses are also offered of King Louis (Louis Sance) and Queen Marie (Suzanne Bianchetti) on trial, and Danton whipping up an audience by a blacksmith’s workshop, tearing a horseshoe in half: “This is what you have done to the monarchy!” Gance punctuates the scene with another startling spasm of near-subliminal cuts between the images of the wild night and Danton’s exultant audience, punctuated by the pounding of the blacksmith’s hammer driving sparks and fire.\n\nThe monarchy’s downfall is the cue for kindling Napoleon’s sense of mission, “a light growing within him” that turns him into the vessel for Gance’s poetic meditation on the wild, awful scene. Napoleon has already encountered one important element of his future. Walking to his pension with holes in his shoes stuffed with paper, he is recompensed by a mesmerising glimpse of Joséphine de Beauharnais (Gina Manès), in the company of her gentleman friend Paul Barras (Max Maxudian), described by a title card as “the idle rich,” as they call on the fortune teller Mademoiselle Lenormand (Carrie Carvalho), the fortune teller. Likewise Josephine’s eye is briefly caught by the bedraggled but piercing-eyed young lieutenant. Soon the fortune teller informs Josephine she will become a queen. Meanwhile Napoleon’s journey is counterpointed, and sometimes influenced, by odd acquaintances. Tristan is his Everyman familiar, the French average Joe, often changing jobs with the shifting tides of national fortune, becomes first a tavern owner in Toulon and then a clerk charged with processing death warrants during the Reign of Terror. If Tristan is spiritual father and emblematic common man attached to Napoleon, his daughter Violine (Annabella), who first catches sight of Napoleon when he comes to their inn at Toulon, thereafter dogs Napoleon’s trail with an ever-growing and obsessive ardour, becoming his priestess, his idolater, his wretched admirer and spiritually communing lover.\n\nNapoleon’s life in Paris as an anonymous and poverty-stricken young officer is described chiefly in a comic vignette, as Napoleon is infuriated when a street cleaning cart rolls by, the spurting water soaking his legs and dissolving the paper stuffed in his holed shoes, earning a glare of pathetic wrath from the future emperor. This throwaway moment shows that Gance’s encounter with Linder and the silent slapstick tradition with its fine feel for everyday frustration and the human comedy wasn’t entirely lost. In a scene still missing from the reconstructed film, Gance also introduced Napoleon’s fellow Corsicans, Saliceti (Philippe Hériat) and Pozzo di Borgo (Acho Chakatouny), who lived in the same boarding house as him in Paris but didn’t like him, and the two become perpetual antagonists. When Napoleon is sent to Corsica as an official emissary of the National Convention, where he soon finds himself and his family in danger when he learns that the island’s president, Pasquale Paoli (Maurice Schutz), with Di Borgo in league, is plotting to let the English invade and occupy Corsica, and Napoleon is marked for arrest or assassination because of his direct connection to the Convention. Saliceti whips up a crowd in condemnation of Napoleon, who’s been warned of the plotting by aged shepherd Santo-Ricci (Henri Baudin). Napoleon’s brothers Joseph (Georges Lampin) and Lucien Sylvio Cavicchia) sail to Calvi to fetch French intervention, whilst Napoleon elects to confront his foes and make an escape whilst the rest of the family, including mother Letizia (Eugénie Buffet) and sisters Élisa (Yvette Dieudonné) and Pauline (Simone Genevois) flee to the forest.\n\n“From this moment until his return to France, the life of this young officer becomes the most incredible of adventure stories,” Gance’s title card promises. The Corsican vignette, whilst a tiny, barely-known episode in terms of Napoleon’s whole life, in many ways becomes the scene of Gance’s most lucidly composed and executed vision, again structured as a slowly but remorselessly building cinematic crescendo. It’s also Gance’s most idealised in dealing with his hero as a figure of almost mystical power and vision to a point bordering on the absurd, viewing it as the first true challenge to his survival talent and personal courage, one that provokes his innermost potential to finally hatch out. Early shots in the chapter depict Napoleon as a solitary figure communing with the Corsican landscape and the sweep of the ocean, a warrior-poet in touch with the elements and awaiting his moment away from the pettiness of the world already gathering forces to destroy him. In the course of his flight he becomes a figure to no small degree like Jesus in Cecil B. DeMille’s King of Kings (1926), inspiring awe and flinching caution from people who nominally want to kill or imprison him, as he boldly appears in a tavern filled with men from rival political factions, each demanding a different foreign political alliance and whose one point of agreement is “Death to Napoleon Bonaparte!”, until Napoleon reveals himself and declares, with mystic light in his eyes, that only France can be their future.\n\nNapoleon extends his daring spectacle of defiance by riding into Ajaccio, stealing the tricoleur hanging on Paoli’s house, and raising it as a sail on a skiff he commandeers to try and sail to France, bellowing defiantly at his pursuers left back on the shore, “I shall bring it back to you!” Like so much of Napoleon, this bisects the zone between inspired artistry and gilding the lily, redeemed by cunning, thrilling flourishes like Napoleon spotting a rope strung up to topple him from his horse and casually hacking it through with his sabre with the poise of a great movie swashbuckler. Back in Paris, Robespierre, in counterpoint to Di Borgo’s rabble-rousing, denounces the Girondin faction along with Danton. Taking as his cue descriptions from the heady days of the National Convention that it was like riding out a storm at sea, Gance intercuts between Napoleon weathering a furious gale on the ocean with the tumult unleashed by the denunciation in the Convention, the lash of waves on the boat intercut with a camera mounted on a swing to evoke the sensation of furious, rolling energy. Other, less spectacular shots still wield astonishing art, like a silhouetted Napoleon on his horse, riding for freedom along the Corsican coast, a threatened but still glowing sun piercing through stormy clouds above. The first of the film’s three parts ends as Napoleon is picked up by a ship bringing his brothers back, they fetch the rest of the family from the shore, and head for France, which Napoleon now declares will be their only home.\n\nGance’s overarching aesthetic desire, to communicate the thrill of his concept of the history he portrays as if he can manifest a sense of physical force through raw filmmaking, also depends on Dieudonné’s capacity to work against his project, insofar as Napoleon is so often envisioned as the stoic pillar at the centre of it all. And yet despite Gance’s idealisation, the character emerges as anything but a waxwork impersonation. In his late thirties when he making the film, Dieudonné was older than the man he was portraying, apparently a sticking point for his friend Gance when he was casting the film, but he reportedly convinced the director to cast him by donning a long black wig. Dieudonné proves readily able to shift between the various stances in the role Gance demands of him – zealous patriotic oracle, terse and tough warrior, musing witness of ugly history, playful would-be father, and a fiery but uncertain lover in a manner reminiscent of Shakespeare’s conception of Henry V – he hires an actor to coach him when he sets out to woo Josephine in the film’s last part. So strong is Dieudonné in inhabiting the character’s body language that when a title card reports him demanding of Tristan, “Bread, olives, and silence!”, you can virtually hear how Dieudonné delivered the line. Dieudonné apparently, eventually took the role and its singular status in his long career so much to hear he had himself buried in his costume, when he died at the age of 87.\n\nHis performance is particularly impressive in its vivacity and cohesion given that Gance hesitates to psychologise the future Emperor. Gance views him rather as one of those people who simply is what they are, born with a certain character and capacity, and whilst buffeted by events eventually proves able to master them. His Napoleon is in fact blissfully free of the traits of the modern world whose ugliest birth pangs Gance had already dealt with, a last gasp of the reflexive human before the age of the analytical human. It’s worth comparing the film’s portrait of Napoleon to the one in Sergei Bondarchuk’s Waterloo (1970), where Rod Steiger captured aspects of mercurial genius and applied energy balanced by monstrous ego and almost childish entitlement, and riddled with flashes of pathos as he knows his time is running out. Gance, by contrast, prints the legend, but in his own, personalised way. He zeroes in on moments that certainly temper something in the man, from weathering school bullying and ethnic resentment, to holding back from grabbing up his gun to shoot the lynchers, in vignettes that demand and receive his circumspect restraint. These imbue him with a good sense of when exactly he should act, as he declares immediately before going on the offensive in Corsica. Gance communicates the speed of Napoleon’s mind with touches like an illustration of the map of Toulon with equations and manoeuvres speeding across it, cut in with the furious churn of montage.\n\nThe traits that make Napoleon interesting and singular are nonetheless those that constantly provoke different, mostly lesser personalities and minds, like his first commander at Toulon, General Carteaux (Léon Courtois), and his rivals Di Borgo and Saliceti, contrasting worldly leisure and pleasure with his brand of discipline and focus, as well as a genius for perceiving military matters incomprehensible to them. Carteaux dismisses his clear and essential insight when it comes to driving the British out of Toulon, whilst the commander of the French Army in Army, currently stuck hovering in the Alps General Schérer (Alexandre Mathillon), sends back his suggested plan for invasion with a note stating they were drafted by a madman who should try implementing them himself. Gance’s obvious pride at working in many a line and note taken directly from historical sources sees every authentic quote marked as “historical,” even the slightly dubious moment when a young Horatio Nelson (Olaf Fjord) sailing as a Lieutenant on a British warship, spies and wants to sink the ship carrying the Bonapartes away from Corsica, only to be told by his captain not to bother.\n\nThe battle for Toulon takes up the first half of the middle third but also cap the “First Epoch” as Gance’s title cards have it. The general replacing the incompetent Carteaux, Dugommier (Alexandre Bernard), makes Napoleon commander of the artillery and gives him the go-ahead to implement his plan to drive out the British, who control the city and the bottled-up French fleet, which involves capturing a specific bastion. Napoleon, putting together a force of soldiers he dubs the “Battery of Men Without Fear.” Launching his attack and night during a pummelling rain shower that soon becomes a hail storm, Napoleon battles both the English and opponents in the French ranks including Saliceti, who berate him for taking such an enormous risk, but Napoleon’s brusque confidence reinforces Dugommier’s trust, and the commander lets him continue. In a brutal, hand-to-fight fight, the French capture the bastion. In retaliation, Admiral Hood (W. Percy Day), commander of the British naval squadron, orders the French fleet burned.\n\nThe battle for Toulon is another amazing bit of filmmaking as Gance successfully recreates the chaos of such a struggle, an onrush of manpower and frantic, almost crazed violence, men grappling in the muck and duelling with sabres. Mixed in are flourishes again touching the surreal, as men are swallowed by torrents of mud, their hands reaching out of the squirming muck like zombies in a horror film, and a bizarre tattoo beat out on the regimental drums by the falling hail. Again, Gance weaves in relieving vignettes of humour and piquant detail, including Tristan cheering Napoleon on from the window of his tavern just as he did back at the military college. His young son Marcellin (Serge Freddy-Karl), now the Battery’s young drummer boy, sneaks into the fray hidden under his drum, which seems to undulate self-willed across the muddy battlefield, so he can strike at Redcoats, only to be swept up and spirited away by Violine. Gance presages the concluding shift into widescreen triptych images as the more traditional ratio splits into three to evoke the tricoleur whilst offering vantages on Napoleon standing resolute amidst the carnage. Despite the exaltation of Napoleon’s military prowess, Gance returns to the ambivalent mode of J’accuse when, the battle finished, his camera pans across the field littered with dead and wounded men, with Napoleon standing a vigil in the rain in appreciating the cost of victory. Finally, after falling asleep on the battlefield, his men plant standards around his sleeping form, whilst the eagle perches atop a post, now fully fledged as the emblem of martial glory.\n\nNapoleon of course deals with historical events that are the stuff drilled into the heads of French schoolchildren, but otherwise the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras are phenomenon is largely known through the viewpoints of other nations, particularly Great Britain with its resolute resistance and counter-mythology as expressed through the likes of A Tale of Two Cities and the imagery of Wellington and Nelson, or for the Russian slant, War and Peace. In this regard Gance’s decision to focus on the early part of Napoleon’s career allows him to highlight less-known moments, and to encompass what he sees as the necessary backdrop for the man’s rise in the slide from exultant energy to petty tyranny that was the Revolution’s course. Whilst not particularly interested in the issues of the moment and emphasising the pointlessness of internecine strife, Gance’s demarcations of the leading personas like Danton and Marat lead of course to their deaths come on with a zest blending a newspaper caricaturist’s electric sense character essence and flashes of poetic extrapolation. Danton’s fate under the guillotine is prefigured when Gance superimposes a shot of a plunging guillotine during the downfall of the Girondins.\n\nArtaud’s Marat, with eyes that almost seem to burn a hole in the movie screen (just as he did in a different if no less fanatical role in the following year’s The Passion of Joan of Arc), gets his comeuppance from Charlotte Corday (Gance’s then-wife Marguerite) in the bath. The denunciation of Robespierre, Saint-Just, and the other bigwigs of the hated Jacobin faction sees Gance give himself a flashy moment that also dares make room for sympathy for the devil, his face offered in close-up as Saint-Just defends their labours with his own visionary tilt of the head and flash of the eyes – “Have you forgotten that we have forged for you a new France, fit to be lived in?…We have achieved all this with that vulture La Vendee at our flanks, and on our back that pack of tigers – the Kings!” That Napoleon’s own life was briefly in danger from the Terror is something that’s been debated by historians, but Gance readily offers it as another unit of drama in the tale. When Napoleon refuses to do the regime’s dirty work by fighting the bloody insurrection in the Vendee region, which he considers a disgraceful case of French killing each-other, Salaceti is able to easily convince Robespierre to condemn him.\n\nTristan, taking a job as a clerk in an office charged with the Reign of Terror’s bureaucratic niceties, finds himself charged with processing the death sentences of both Napoleon and Josephine, the latter tossed into prison by Saint-Just. In one of Gance’s inspired Dickensian touches, the office also includes an aged clerk mounted on a hoist constantly ascending and descending a towering filing cabinet upon which court verdicts, mostly sentences to be decapitated, pile up, described as “the Thermometer of the Guillotine.” Tristan gets clerks Bonnet (Boris Fastovich-Kovanko) and La Bussière (Jean d’Yd), two real historical personages renowned for disposing of some death sentences by literally eating them surreptitiously, to consume Napoleon’s warrant. Josephine meanwhile is saved from the tumbril first by her ex-husband, Alexandre de Beauharnais (Georges Cahuzac), who elects to be the one person of that name called to the guillotine – “For once, madame, let me take precedence,” he suggests to Josephine. Later, in a fit of sobbing despair, Josephine encounters Lazare Hoche (Pierre Batcheff), a young and romantic aristocratic general also imprisoned and expecting to die, and they help each-other weather the storm until the Jacobin downfall. Soldiers barge into the “Thermometer” office, the old clerk bobbing on his hoist with amusing pathos, and soon all the prisoners are released.\n\nIn the eruption of gaiety that follows the end of the Reign of Terror, where the survivors of the Terror or the dead’s relatives gather to celebrate survival and indulge the orgiastic pleasures of living with some accomplished debauchery in an event they call the Victims’ Ball, Napoleon once more encounters Josephine as one of three beauties chosen to be exalted at the party. Deeply smitten, he sets out to woo her, with Hoche removing himself from the equation when he realises the fierceness of their attraction. Dejected and without a role following his plan to invade Italy is rejected, Napoleon nonetheless finds himself positioned to play the hero again when he’s fetched by the National Convention to defend them when a mob of resurgent royalists gathers to attack them: Napoleon, arming all the members of the Convention and having his first, fateful encounter with Joachim Murat (Genica Missirio), displays his casual expertise in dispersing the horde. Josephine in turn brings to bear her influence on Barras, now one of the main inheritors of power in France, to get Napoleon appointed commander of the army in Italy. Napoleon, upon hearing this news, takes down the rejected plan he had used to cover a hole in his garret window, determined now to implement it, and elects to quickly marry Josephine. Napoleon has already, incidentally charmed Josephine’s son Eugène (Georges Hénin) by letting him keep his executed father’s sword, and he resolves to play father to him and sister Hortense (Jeanne Pen). Meanwhile Josephine takes in Violine, after finding her collapsed and unconscious outside the house after spending so long lurking around in a lovestruck daze for Napoleon: after being restored to health, Violine helps get her father a job in the household.\n\nNapoleon is of course a portrayal of a historical epoch and also a product of one. Gance’s delirious visions of the debaucheries of the Victims’ Ball, including female guests swanning around in increasingly provocative gowns and ending the night with bared breasts, is as much a portrait of the excess of the Jazz Age following hard upon the Great War as it is a depiction of the liberated mood of after weathering the Reign of Terror, and also an interlude of naughty hype. Gance delivers a good joke Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton would’ve been proud of, in presenting, after a menacing title card reading “The Reaction,” the sight of a man dressed as a jailer passing through a throng of people dressed in prison clothes and barred gates, and beginning to read from a list as if announcing the condemned, only for this to prove to be the start of the Victims’ Ball, the list a menu of the delicacies on hand. Gance even indulges a little gender-bending as Tristan starts flirting with a laughing woman only to realise it’s a man in drag. Something of the imminent grimness of the Depression is also presaged too as Napoleon notes he poor around his neighbourhood, desperately cold and cueing for charity, and seeing it in terms of a larger project: “If the Revolution hasn’t found its leader by the end of the week, it’s finished.”\n\nNapoleon also intervenes to save Saliceti and Di Borgo from being hung by a republican mob, after they try to assassinate Napoleon as he fends off the Royalists: he’s saved by accident thanks to Tristan, serving as a volunteer, discharging his gun and distracting Saliceti’s own aim. Napoleon, whilst noting that he cannot forget the compatriot duo’s wrongdoings, he does forgive them. It’s odd that Gance singled Saliceti out to be the central antagonist to Napoleon in his account, given that the real Saliceti helped Napoleon’s career and, whilst opposed to his eventual coup to become dictator, served under his brother Joseph’s regime in Italy. I feel like Gance wanted an opponent who was close to a doppelganger for the character, springing from the same background, same soil, but doomed to play in constant, stumbling lockstep with his omnicompetent foe. Meanwhile the man himself remains locked within his own genius, one that imbues tunnel-visioned focus. That focus is capable of landing anything he sets his mind to from an enemy redoubt to Josephine’s heart to trying to cure national and international ills, but too oblivious to rival wills and projects.\n\nPerhaps the greatest hesitation Napoleon inspires as a film is that it’s too much – too much dazzling technique, too much genius, too much enthusiasm, too much movie in all. It’s a film that feels like the product of a choice on Gance’s part, after indulging his deepest tragic sensibility in J’accuse, to refuse tragedy and instead embrace a winner, to chase an image of achievement that transcends the barriers of mere strife and warmongering, and rather borders on crusade – a choice, perhaps, too many were willing to make around the same time. Gance nonetheless mediates on his choice in odd ways. He gives sympathy to the devil, as with Saint-Just’s self-defence, and contends with the way the idea of Napoleon as much or more than his actuality becomes a cult for the French. He wields Violine as the emblem of a France enraptured by the emerging Napoleon, buying a figurine of him from a street vendor when he’s hailed as a saviour after helping the Convention, and later installing a shrine to him including such memorabilia and keepsakes, turning him into a living god, in a way that intuits something important about the way the Revolution’s secular and atheistic tendencies nonetheless gave birth to a kind of demigod ideal that needed Napoleon to embody it.\n\nIn the film’s last quarter Gance takes this fascination with personal interpretations of faith, ardour, and destiny to some odd but revealing places, analysing his own compulsive project even whilst indulging its highest flights of fancy. Napoleon himself, when being taught by his actor friend how to make overtures to Josephine, imagines her face projected onto a globe and nuzzles against it as if to make love to beloved. This flourish of delightful, rather fetishistic illusory passion also includes Gance’s cumulating irony, as he notes the promise and threat of Napoleon’s desire to conquer his lady as conflating already with a desire to conquer the world at large. Violine, practising her secret faith, mirrors Napoleon’s indulgence of illusion, as she goes through her own mock wedding ceremony in the privacy of the room Josephine has given her, having adopted Josephine’s curled hairstyle in an effort to remake herself in the image of her idol’s lucky lady. Violine positions the Napoleon figurine she bought with shadow projected on the wall so can have the illusion of embracing her beloved for the nuptials-sealing kiss. Late in the film, Josephine comes into Violine’s room and finds her praying at her shrine, but rather than getting angry, understands the impulse well and succumbs to the same urge, kneeling by her friend-sister-rival-comrade to join in her vigil.\n\nThe dreamy texture of these scenes are arresting as a stylistic antistrophe from the history-written-with-lightning verve of the rest of the film. In a lot of ways the vigil of Josephine and Violine is its proper ending and punchline, certainly its interest in the zeitgeist of France in the time and metaphorical engagement with the Napoleonic idyll, having cycled through a portrait of the various, failed saviours of the nation giving way to the last, best hope, a virtual religion sparked. Here Gance’s depiction of obsessive ardour is twinned in a swooningly evoked but actually irony-flecked manner, watching as these people begin to get lost in the mists of their personal dream-visions and obsessive objects, even whilst affecting to deal with reality, their fantasias of longing bound to collide with less comforting results. This is taken a step further in a vital scene, which sees Napoleon, before heading off to take command of the Italian campaign, stops to visit the National Convention, deserted in the middle of the night. Taking to the rostrum, Napoleon now conjures up an audience and the shades, real or imagined, of the various, dead Revolutionary leaders, particularly the Three Gods but also many others. The shades feed him a succession of oaths, including to take over as the Revolution’s leader and to take it into Europe to forge the Universal Republic, all of which Napoleon swears to. The spectres are satisfied, but Danton’s warns him that if he ever betrays the Revolution they will turn against him.\n\nThis vignette is exceedingly important, in terms of the film’s overall meaning, and in indicating where Gance might have headed if he had made further instalments in his epic cycle. Perhaps he intended a rise-and-fall arc that would have seen Napoleon increasingly drifting within a bubble bound to pop and realise his mistakes too late. Gance uses this sequence regardless to place an important precondition on the very end’s depiction of Napoleon marching into Italy: so long as it’s being done in the name of a vital, humanistic cause, and with an ultimate eye towards dispensing with warfare as a necessary end, rather than making it a self-sustaining paradigm and Moloch-like dark god demanding victims, Napoleon’s purpose is righteous. The sight of the ghostly Convention singing “La Marseillaise” before fading from Napoleon’s vision meanwhile revisits the army of the dead at the end of J’accuse, and containing not merely patriotic triumphalism but fear too, an anxiety of a cause terribly wrung and battered by events, but subsisting still. Gance might well ultimately have been glad he never had to make the other films, that said. How could he have sustained the same creative pitch, and how deeply might he have wrestled with the hero-worship he indulges here when forced to? It seems as if the subplots involving Saliceti and Di Borgo, Violine and Tristan, were meant to extend into future movies, but all of them find a satisfying conclusion within this narrative, playing out their contrapuntal roles whilst finally all feeding into the core legend.\n\nIn any event, Gance shifts from the sight of Josephine and Violine praying to their man-god together to the man himself riding in a coach to join his new army, handing out messages to riders alongside in a first display of whirlwind command and decisiveness when freed to it, before finally abandoning the coach itself for horseback to speed more quickly to his goal. Finally he reaches the army, encamped in the Alpine foothills at Albenga, where he’s confronted by a rag-wearing, slovenly, entirely demoralised force led by a collective of grumpy and resentful officers who have resolved to cold-shoulder the popinjay being foisted on them. But Napoleon looks over officers and men alike with his formidable gaze – cueing another memorable historical quote from one onlooker, “With his piercing looks, this little stump of a man frightens me.” Napoleon breathes fire into the ragged force that will “awaken with the spirit of the Grand Army” and announces he’s going to lead them down to “the most fertile plains in the world.” Here Gance executes his ultimate moment of cinematic largesse, as the film erupts into what was called Polyvision by its developers – a widescreen vista captured by three cameras mounted together. This technique allows Gance to swap between panoramic shots, beholding the mass of men and the expensive scale of his staging in a way many a later Hollywood director would gleefully reproduce, and also split-screen imagery in returning to the tricoleur motif. The best aspect of this is that Gance is still trying here to use his innovation with definite artistic purpose rather than merely showing off – although he’s certainly doing that too.\n\nHere, much like his protagonist finally gaining the keys to the kingdom, Gance revels in being able to step between grandiose surveys of massed human potential and closer, simultaneous views of individuals reacting in fascination and wonder, and both at once. The sight of the men on the march with Napoleon racing forth on his steed on either side of them like an unleashed world spirit gives way to the army storming a town as their first outpost of conquest, whilst their general stands on a hilltop and “plays with the clouds at building and destroying worlds.” Gance finally leaves off with the image of the resurgent eagle, swooping over the heads of the advancing force as they escape on a spree across the world. It’s impossible to deny the power and aesthetic brilliance of all this, even if it is possible to argue with Gance’s romantic vision, his unadorned appeal to French nationalistic propaganda and embrace of his titanic conqueror, despite the interesting and considered codicils he offers before it. A few years later the worst people on earth were on the march under eagle banners, but then again the best were doing much the same thing, and the spirit Napoleon as a film is far more like the latter than the former. In the end the most certain truth is that Napoleon is a relic, a diary, a manifesto, a monument, all depicting a creator acting just like his hero – playing with clouds at building and destroying worlds.\n\nDirector: Sergei Bondarchuk\n\nScreenwriters: Sergei Bondarchuk, Vittorio Bonicelli, H.A.L. Craig\n\nBy Roderick Heath\n\nIn Memoriam: Christopher Plummer 1929-2021\n\nShrugged off by critics and moviegoers when it was released in 1970, Sergei Bondarchuk’s Waterloo is nonetheless one of those white elephants of cinema history that today demands a certain awe. A movie where the making of it was damn near as epic an event as the history it depicts, it’s also one of those rare instances where a mega-budget production and genuine directorial vision coincide. Waterloo began life with the ever-ambitious Italian producer Dino de Laurentiis wanting to make a film about the legendary clash that drew a curtain on Napoleon Bonaparte’s military career and an age of European history, originally hiring John Huston to direct it. But De Laurentiis had difficulty raising the necessary budget for such a monumental undertaking, even at a time when large-scale international co-productions were becoming fairly common. When he did eventually find production partners it came from an unusual direction. The Soviet Union’s state film production company Mosfilm agreed to join forces with De Laurentiis, helping stage the battle scenes in Uzhhorod, Ukraine, and supplying the largest number of extras ever assembled for a film. 17,000 Red Army soldiers played the clashing forces, whilst army engineers laboured to alter a stretch of Ukrainian farmland into a better approximation of the Belgian farmland that served as the battlefield. The film finished up rivalling in costs what was then the most expensive film ever made, 1963’s Cleopatra.\n\nWaterloo’s eventual director Bondarchuk was a Ukrainian actor who had been a popular and lauded leading man in Soviet cinema from the 1940s, and established himself as a talented filmmaker with his feature directing debut, Fate of a Man (1959). Bondarchuk was and remains best known outside Russia for both directing and starring in a colossal seven-hour adaptation of Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace, released in instalments through 1965-7. That work was realised through vast amounts of money and resources poured into it by the Soviet government in its determination to outdo the 1956 King Vidor version and make waves on the international cinema scene. The immense vision of that film saw Bondarchuk prove himself a master of handling colossal surveys of manpower and infrastructure, as well sufficiently intelligent and fine in touch to put across the human drama as well, although given the running time Tolstoy’s drama was surprisingly often muted in favour of sheer spectacle. Waterloo allowed Bondarchuk to at least provide a kind of historical sequel. Waterloo’s script was chiefly credited to the Irish former journalist and critic H.A.L. Craig, who had worked for De Laurentiis before including for the odd, interesting war film Anzio (1968), although others including Bondarchuk made contributions at different points in development.\n\nMaking a film about one of the most legendary and pivotal moments in history and two of its most powerful personalities in Napoleon Bonaparte and Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington, is one of those challenges cinema’s maximalist creative talents can hardly resist but rarely get to tackle. Indeed, at the time of its release Stanley Kubrick was deeply involved in developing his own film about Napoleon, only for Waterloo’s box office failure to help foil it. To play the leads De Laurentiis hired two actors it’s hard to imagine being more different in performing style and screen presence whilst still being major stars and regarded talents. The Method-trained Rod Steiger, just passing the zenith of his movie career after winning an Oscar for In The Heat of The Night (1967) and gravitating increasingly to appearing in European films, was hired to play Napoleon, and the Shakespearean-schooled Christopher Plummer as Wellington. Steiger’s Napoleon dominates the film initially, offered as a tragic antihero pushed again and again to try and recapture lost glory. The opening scene finds Napoleon’s Marshals, including Ney (Dan O’Herlihy), Soult (Ivo Garrani), and Grouchy (Charles Millot), stalking their way purposefully through the corridors of a palace where Napoleon is trying to conduct his final, desperate resistance against the invading allied armies, their boots rapping on the tiles like a drumbeat of portent.\n\nBondarchuk’s genuine creative touch as a director is plain from this moment, deftly diagramming the game of tense confrontation that unfolds between the Emperor and his Marshals, matched to Steiger’s performance with its fast alternations of affect. Napoleon moves with speed through brief flare-ups of his old fighting pith, world-weary exasperation, tight-wound contempt, and eruptions of violent declamation. “You know what the throne is, Ney?” he laughingly asks the Marshal when the cavalry leader tells him he has to give it up, “The throne is an over-decorated piece of furniture. It’s what’s behind the throne that counts.” Claiming it’s his genius and will that has put them all where they are, he starts mocking the Marshals: “You all stand before me waving a piece of paper, crying ‘abdicate, abdicate’,” before bellowing with window-rattling vehemence, “I will not!” over and over, exposing all at once his genuine, force-of-nature strength of will and streak of childish tantrum-throwing. As he settles in a chair by a fireplace an officer enters and whispers to him, and Bondarchuk moves in for an intimate, shadowy close-up of Napoleon’s eyes as his voice questions in a whisper, “All his men?” Clearly he’s just been delivered awful news that finally deflates the will he so loudly espouses, and he silently stands, signs his abdication and walks out. The officer explains that another Marshal has just surrendered with the last of his armies, “his last hope.” The Marshals all suddenly turn as if stung and see Napoleon looking back through the doors at them with glowering resentment mixed with bone-deep pain and defeat.\n\nNapoleon heads out into the courtyard where the members of his old Imperial Guard are at attention, and he gives a final, grand bit of theatre to them as he calls them “My children…my sons!” and wipes away his tears on the regimental flag. Finally he climbs into his carriage and rolls away to exile on Elba, seen as a hazy blotch of land in the distance under the opening credits. Soon titles inform us Napoleon escapes the island and lands on the mainland with a thousand men. The restored Bourbon king, Louis XVIII, played in a brief but effective cameo by Orson Welles, is presented as a languid, balloon-bodied humpty-dumpty in fancy clothes, barely stirred by the news his arch-enemy has escaped. After Ney, who like most of the other Marshals has kept his rank in the restoration, promises to bring his former master back “in an iron cage,” Louis mutters in quiet disdain: “How they exaggerate, all these – these soldiers…Nobody asked for that.” Ney sets out with an army division to intercept Napoleon but when the two forces square off, Napoleon, with a calculated but also genuine show of bravery, waves down his own men and marches up to Ney and his, offering himself as target. After a silent, jittery stand-off, one soldier feints, breaking the spell, and Napoleon is joyously swept up by his former soldiers. Ney throws down his sword to Napoleon, who gives it back to him and, after a few needling comments, accepts him again as his penitent disciple.\n\nSoon enough Napoleon, vowing to displace “that fat King,” is swept into the Tuileries Palace after Louis flees it by a mob of Parisians, and he sets to work with what seems to be all his old energy and brilliance. And yet the Napoleon Steiger provides is not the romantic young culture hero of Jacques-Louis David’s paintings, if he ever existed, or even Abel Gance’s, but a middle-aged, portly, sickening man whose one great weapon is his multivalent brain, which might not be coupled to true instincts anymore. Bondarchuk includes a lengthy scene of Napoleon dictating several letters at once to various secretaries, segueing from subject to subject with breakneck speed but with a certain commonality of argument accruing, as he angrily ripostes to one letter from a prince accusing him of usurping the crown that he found it in a gutter and the people put it on his head, whilst also consoling the mother of a soldier accidentally killed and his begging his wife, now returned to her native Austria, to return his young son to him.\n\nNapoleon’s last spur to regaining his former grandeur and fighting battles, the film suggests as it unfolds, it his desire to leave something more to his son than simply an onerous last name. As he asks one of his men late in the film what they’ll say about him in the future, the officer replies, “They will say you extended the limits of glory.” “Is that what I’m going to leave my son?” Napoleon queries, “The limits of glory?” This quest keeps driving him on even as he perceives, “My body is dying…but my brain is still good.” Soon Napoleon learns that the heads of his allied enemies have declared personal war on him despite his overtures for peace. He knows by this point who his first two adversaries are likely to be: Wellington, the English general whose name has a totemic import for his Marshals because he steadily skinned them in Spain and Portugal, a measure of inspired dread Napoleon registers but dismisses, and the Prussian Field Marshal Blücher (Sergo Zakariadze), whose armies are poised in Belgium. Receiving news that the two armies have separated whilst in the bath, Napoleon moves swiftly to take advantage.\n\nPlummer’s Wellington is finally, first glimpsed entering the famous ball thrown by the Duchess of Richmond (Virginia McKenna) in Brussels that finished up becoming the scene for the General and his senior officers learning of Napoleon’s hard and fast drive in their direction. Contrasting the fleshy, brilliant, but going-to-seed Napoleon, Wellington seems a man exactly in his prime, every inch the aristocratic warrior and an accomplished social animal, charming the Duchess and amusing her daughter Sarah (Susan Wood) with the most hyperbolic stories of Bony as a monster who drinks blood. He soon however reveals one trait in common with Napoleon, in possessing a pithy, unsentimental wit in regards to the business of being powerful. He describes to the Duchess his men as “Scum. Nothing but beggars and scoundrels, all of them. Gin is the spirit of their patriotism,” and only murmuring “Umm-hmm,” when the Duchess asks whether he still expects them to die for him. Wellington’s crew of stalwart warriors, most of them veterans of his long Peninsula War campaigns, are present, including the Duchess’s uncle the Duke of Gordon (Rupert Davies), commander of the famous Highland regiment, Wellington’s second-in-command the Earl of Uxbridge (Terence Alexander), quartermaster Colonel De Lancey (Ian Ogilvy), archetypal young cavalier Lord Hay (Peter Davies), and Sir William Ponsonby (Michael Wilding), commander of the Scots Greys cavalry division.\n\nAnd there’s the eccentric, hard-bitten infantry commander Thomas Picton (Jack Hawkins), who presents a figure well out of place amongst all the dashing young officers and their ladies. Picton gruffly schools Lord Hay, who tries to impress Sarah by promising to bring her back a cuirassier’s breastplate, with the promise he’ll learn how to fight from the French, only to earn some sharp teasing right back from Sarah. Her mother confesses to being “a little bit of a Bonapartist” in her admiration for Napoleon’s vigour. Meanwhile, in a clever bit of directing, Bondarchuk depicts Wellington’s thoughts turning out into the stormy night beyond the gilt-framed windows in his attempts to mentally anticipate Napoleon’s moves, only for images of Napoleon’s army on the movie to resolve out of the murk. Bondarchuk turns the ball sequence into a dreamy moment of high romantic"
