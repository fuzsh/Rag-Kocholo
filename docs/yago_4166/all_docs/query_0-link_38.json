Displaying his usual knack for locating cultural treasure, he secured two tickets for a screening of Napoléon at the Royal Festival Hall in London. This experience was a revelation, and I can never adequately thank Nick for introducing me to a work of art that has enriched my life like no other. That modern audiences have been able to see Napoléon at all is due to Kevin Brownlow. His work on Gance is of incalculable importance, just as his decades of investigation and restoration have given so many silent films new life. I first met him in October 2005, having written an enthusiastic letter in the hope of an interview. Not only did he accept and answer a barrage of questions, he also showed me the latest fragment of 35mm footage from Napoléon that he had unearthed in Denmark – a great privilege, whose memory I still cherish. My dedication of this book to him can only be a small token of gratitude for all his support and encouragement. It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge my debt to Carl Davis, whose extraordinary score for Napoléon continues to deepen my understanding of Gance’s film. Its first performance in 1980 launched the restoration of silent cinema as a performative art, and Davis’s subsequent work has resurrected dozens of other films from this era. I count the many hours I have spent in theatres under the spell of his music among the happiest of my life. I was very flattered to hear from the composer that he was an admirer of my writing on Gance, and hope that this book does justice to the live experience of Napoléon that inspired it. Much of my work on Gance took place in the Department of Film and Television Studies at the University of Warwick (uk). Between my final year as an undergraduate and my last year as a postgraduate, I submitted three theses on Napoléon. At each stage of this study, Jon Burrows acted as my supervisor – exercising great patience and providing much sage advice. As well as Jon, I should thank all those in and around Warwick – colleagues, friends, peers, and students – for their willingness to accept and share my enthusiasm. Equally, my parents provided me with the moral and financial aid necessary to survive during my years of scholarly endeavour. In Paris, my research could not have taken place without the aid of Nelly Kaplan, the staff of the Bibliothèque du Film at the Cinémathèque Française (in particular, those in ‘L’espace chercheurs’), the Arts du Spectacle department of the Bibliothèque Nationale, and Laure Marchaut of the\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\n18\n\nA Revolution for the Screen\n\nCopyright © 2015. Amsterdam University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nCinémathèque’s Fort de Saint-Cyr film archive. As well as being an invaluable source of hard-to-find dvds, Christine Leteux was able to decipher and translate some of Gance’s most impenetrable handwriting and unearth documentation that I would otherwise have missed. My special thanks go to Sarah Ohana, who acted as both host and cultural guide during much of my time in France. For offering extremely helpful advice on early drafts of this book, I must thank Kevin Brownlow and Erik Schelander. The assembly of illustrative material could not have taken place without the help of Kevin Brownlow and Photoplay Productions, Eduard Engel, James Mockoski, and Dick Moeske. At Amsterdam University Press, I am grateful for the editorial support of Jeroen Sondervan and Thomas Elsaesser – and for the efficient work of their copyediting team. Not only has Natalie Stone sat by my side through multiple screenings of Napoléon, but she has tolerated every manifestation of my monomania. For this, and for so much else, I am deeply thankful and immensely proud. A small amount of material in this study derives from articles originally published in the journal Studies in French Cinema and on the Alternate Takes website – any such work appears here with the permission of the publishers.\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015.

So often, descriptions of films are written in such an impenetrable language that you need a dictionary – and sometimes the word is so obscure you won’t find it. I was impressed by Paul Cuff because he is not only a critic, not only a historian. He is an enthusiast who believes in action. When a new four-and-a-half-hour version of La Roue (1922) was released on dvd, he realized vital elements were missing. So he rounded up all available elements of this monumental film and produced a six-hour alternative (see Cuff 2011). It proved once again that the more you put back into a Gance silent, the better it gets. ‘Come with me to Paris and I will show you a Gance film no one thought existed’, said Cuff one day. I could hardly turn down such an offer, which brought back memories of my early forays as a film collector. We reported to one of the forts built after the Franco-Prussian war to protect Paris, which already had an atmosphere of buried treasure, and were taken to a bunker in which a viewing machine awaited with a pile of cans. To my amazement, the film was one that Gance shot during the First World War but never assembled. It wasn’t exactly an ideal subject for wartime audiences; a holy man from India comes to Europe with a message of peace and endures brutality from both sides. Ecce Homo (1918) was photographed by the great cameraman LéonceHenri Burel, and watching it in rushes form made one long to see it on the big screen. The print had been made direct from the camera negative and was as sharp as any original. It had been filmed in the South of France, where the climate is similar to Hollywood’s. But the production had been closed down by Pathé when the leading actor was called. Gance then moved on to his first masterpiece, J’accuse! (1919). Enthusiasm is not a quality one often encounters in academic writing. One feels they regard film history as dangerously close to trainspotting. But it was this quality that first drew me to Gance. In 1954, I had acquired two reels for my 9.5mm projector, a machine which had so far run little more than Mickey Mouse. The reels formed a chapter in a silent version of Napoléon. When I first screened them, I was astonished at the fluid use of the camera, the bravura editing – and the brilliantly atmospheric lighting. I was so impressed that I did something I had never done before: I wrote a fan letter to the director. I’m sure it was very naïve, but it brought a reply. Gance said he was working on a new process called Polyvision\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\n20\n\nA Revolution for the Screen\n\nCopyright © 2015. Amsterdam University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nwhich would cause an upheaval in the cinema world. That upheaval had already been triggered by Cinerama, a development of Gance’s three-screen sequences which climaxed Napoléon. In March 1955, a journalist lent me a photograph of Gance, and I showed it to Liam O’Leary, a friend who worked at the British Film Institute. A day or so later, Gance came to London to see Cinerama and afterwards he walked down Shaftesbury Avenue and found himself outside the British Film Institute. As he walked in, Liam happened to be looking through his glass door. Thank heaven he did. For he greeted the great director, who was startled to be recognized (he had not made a film for twelve years). He organized a reception at the National Film Theatre and invited me. I arrived just before Gance stepped out of his taxi – he was 65, a strikingly handsome man with great charisma. I was 50 years younger, still in my school blazer, and dismayed only that he didn’t speak English. Despite all the years spent studying, my French was hopeless. However, enthusiasm knows no barriers. Gance must have been startled to find a schoolboy so passionate about his work. There were more celebrated film people there that afternoon – Basil Wright, the documentary director, Sir Michael Balcon, producer of the Ealing films – but I was only interested in one man. A friendship began that lasted until his death 27 years later. Whenever I visited Gance, I felt I was meeting Victor Hugo. I wanted to write down for posterity everything he said. (I did record most of it.) And when, in 1967, he allowed me to move into his apartment with a film crew, he gave me the most perfect concluding remarks: While I’m on television I want to tell you that without enthusiasm, there is no cinema, there are no films, there is nothing. Enthusiasm is essential. It must be communicated to people like a flame. Cinema is a flame in the shadows. To vanquish the darkness, you must be able to generate enthusiasm. If you don’t feel it, you cannot transmit it. This is why I believe anyone who doesn’t have this enthusiasm won’t understand me and cannot produce what I consider to be a great film.\n\nNapoléon seems to provoke enthusiasm in a way few (if any) other films can achieve, as Cuff himself says. When my restoration was first shown in London, at the Empire, Leicester Square in 1980, I emerged from the underground station in a state of terror. How would the orchestra stay in sync for five hours? How would an audience unaccustomed to silent films sit still for five hours? It could only be a disaster. I was not aware that the film had caught the crowd until Bonaparte as a cadet is thrown into the snow by the monks at Brienne College, and the orchestra played Carl Davis’s\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nForeword\n\n21\n\nirresistible ‘eagle of destiny’ theme. I felt a wave of emotion that was to be repeated throughout the film. Part of what Cuff hopes this book will do is to counter those writers who seem to remain suspicious (if not outright hostile) to the idea that enjoying the film is morally suspect and that enthusiasm is an enemy of critical evaluation. I have no doubt he will succeed.\n\nCopyright © 2015. Amsterdam University Press.

Having inherited the marvels of human imagination, I refuse to act like an auditor classifying assets […] A masterpiece offers me its hospitality: I approach it, hat in hand, and admire the countenance of my host. (Hugo 1864: 372)\n\nCopyright © 2015. Amsterdam University Press. All rights reserved.\n\n*** The scale of Abel Gance’s work presents a monumental challenge for film scholars. Paper documentation relating to his career currently occupies over 400 boxes in the Paris archives of the Bibliothèque Nationale and the Cinémathèque Française. The celluloid legacy of his major silent films is equally vast: J’accuse! (1919) had an original length of 5250 metres, occupying over four hours of screen time; La Roue (1922) premiered at 10,730m and lasted over eight hours in the theatre. Napoléon, vu par Abel Gance (1927) consumed 400,000m of film stock during its production (equal to 290 hours of footage), and the longest version of the completed film ran to 12,800m – 666,000 frames of celluloid that took over nine hours to project. The amount of lost evidence is also daunting: up to a third of the material from each of the above films no longer exists, whilst a large proportion of paperwork has yet to be recorded. Gance’s reputation has thus been defined as much by obscurity and incompletion as by grandeur and excess. In order to outline my own approach to Napoléon, this preface must first provide an overview of the film’s physical and critical chronology – two histories that are inseparably linked. In 1923, Gance wrote the synopses of six films that would cover Napoléon Bonaparte’s life from childhood to death. Over the next year, he worked on the full screenplay for the first part of his series, completing the final of three drafts just before production began in January 1925. After eighteen months of filming, spanning the liquidation of his first production company and the formation of another, Gance realized he was running out of time and space. He had already exceeded the budget for all six films making just the first, and hadn’t reached the end of his 1924 screenplay – despite having used a record amount of celluloid. The logistical problems of Napoléon’s temporal breadth were compounded by the technical challenges that the film generated. The scale of the last scenes he filmed in August 1926, depicting Bonaparte leading his\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015.

Several sequences were shot by three cameras mounted on the same platform, their combined perspectives forming a panoramic view. Gance filmed additional footage in both 3D and colour, but he rejected this material in favour of his widescreen format. The final scenes of the ‘Entry into Italy’ sequence alternate between the formation of a continuous frame and three separate ones. Gance called this style of lateral montage ‘Polyvision’ – an extraordinarily brilliant innovation that enabled his unfinished film to end in spectacular fashion. This formal experimentation had a direct impact on Napoléon’s exhibition. To mount Polvysion in the theatre, three projectors must run side-by-side in perfect synchronization – an extremely problematic feat, even for dedicated screenings in the present day. Despite these practical difficulties, Gance was so enthused by his invention that he edited existing footage of the ‘Double Tempest’ scenes into a second triptych sequence. The first public screening of Napoléon was in April 1927, at the Théâtre de l’Opéra in Paris. As Gance hadn’t had time to complete sorting and editing all his material, this ‘Opéra version’ was an abbreviated edition of the film – running to 5600m and including both triptych sequences. A longer copy of 12,800m was premiered at the Apollo in May. This ‘Apollo version’ was the fullest the public ever saw, but it was screened without the triptychs. Gance wanted to divide this version into episodes and release it as a multi-part film, as he had with J’accuse and La Roue. Though various prints were released in this form in some provincial regions, their integrity was undermined by the inevitable excisions imposed by individual exhibitors who cut the film down according to their own needs and taste. Despite never achieving a general release, Napoléon created a sensation in its numerous trade screenings and special shows. This populist epic was filled with avant-garde experimentation: spectators experienced splitscreen and widescreen effects as well as every conceivable variety of mobile camerawork. There was a huge critical response, but Gance’s disorienting array of dramatic technique caused both rapture and nausea. Scarcely has a film inspired so much contradiction from its critics – even Gance’s friends were often jarringly ambivalent. Marxist writer Léon Moussinac claimed the content of Napoléon was ‘indefensible’ and ‘pernicious’: Gance’s Revolution is a ‘complete distortion of history’ and his Bonaparte the conglomeration of ‘pure fantasy’ that could appeal only to ‘burgeoning fascists’ (1927a: 4). Yet the second half of his review lauds the film’s ‘remarkable […] technical qualities’ and formal daring (Moussinac 1927b: 4). Emile Vuillermoz wrote that Gance was a ‘perfect’ filmmaker, held back from true greatness by retrograde Romanticism – his was an imagination cluttered with literary\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015.

Both these writers contrast Napoléon’s praiseworthy style against its ‘reprehensible’ content, which marks ‘a grievous regression in the history of the silent art’ (Vuillermoz 1927a: 4). Those who favoured Gance’s formal experimentation wanted a shorter version of the film which concentrated on stylistic innovation, heightening its ‘artistic’ qualities. Though the condensed format of the Opéra version at least partially fulfilled this desire, many found its narrative incoherent: a plethora of images and a ‘paucity of logic’ (Saint-Cyr 1927: 81). Most reviewers actually preferred the far longer Apollo version: ‘its proportions are more harmonious, its rhythm more sustained, its narrative clearer and more coherent’ (Gordeaux 1927: 4). However, expanding the narrative elements led others to accuse Gance of burdening his film with unnecessary melodrama. Neither the Opéra nor the Apollo version satisfied everyone: abridged, Napoléon was accused of being overwhelmed by its own artistry; extended, it was criticized for falling victim to narrative excess. Gance’s producers had equally strong reactions. The film was distributed by Gaumont-Metro-Goldwyn, the French subsidiary of Metro-GoldwynMayer. The company’s executives were horrified by the sheer length of Napoléon and the exorbitant demands its widescreen format made on cinemas. In 1928, gmg altered Gance’s film into a more manageable form. Reducing its length by half and re-cutting it entirely, they transformed Napoléon into ‘a masterpiece of ineptitude’ (Brownlow [1983] 2004: 151). So appalling was the result, and so insulting its mutilations, that Gance took his own distributors to court – and won. Mgm reconfigured the film yet again for its us release in 1928, reducing Gance’s 12,800m to 2400m. Removing both formal experimentation and extraneous plot, they finally ‘improved’ Gance’s film into an acceptable form; the result was a financial and artistic disaster. Though Gance believed Polyvision would ‘play a leading role in the future [of film]’ (1928c), the only cinema he persuaded to install permanent triptych equipment was Studio 28, a small avant-garde venue in Paris. For this theatre, he re-edited sections of Napoléon into the triptych format to create three short ‘studies’: Danses, Galops, and Marine (1928). Within months of its explosive premiere in 1927, Napoléon vanished from theatrical screens – and his Polyvision ‘studies’ never entered distribution. Only one other screenplay from the proposed series was finished during the silent era – the final of the six parts, Sainte-Hélène (1927-8). Having tried and failed to produce other episodes in subsequent years, Gance returned to his first film in 1934. He shot new footage to reframe his narrative, as well as adding synchronized dialogue and music to existing silent material. This\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2015. Amsterdam University Press.

The reappearance of Gance’s most famous work made little impact on the new generation of film historians and couldn’t prevent the steady erosion of his reputation. Armed only with secondhand knowledge of his silent work, André Bazin tried to tidy Gance away into a subcategory of montage-based cinema without considering his diversity of stylistic expression (1952: 364). His perfunctory remarks did Gance a deep disservice – virtually writing him out of modern film criticism at an early stage in its development. Despite this neglect, Gance received recognition from future members of the French Nouvelle Vague. Extracts from the silent Napoléon were screened at the Cinémathèque Française in 1954, and the following year a new version of Napoléon Bonaparte was shown – complete with the original final triptych, synchronized with sound and music. Deeply impressed by the film, François Truffaut later wrote: ‘each shot is a bolt of lightning that illuminates everything around it’ (1975: 52). Though even such fragmentary material resulted in some enthusiastic appraisals of Gance in Cahiers du cinéma, no real critical resurrection could take place whilst his silent films languished (and perished) in vaults. The textual status of the silent Napoléon was rendered even more illegible by Gance’s final attempt to reanimate his old project in 1970. In Bonaparte et la Révolution (1971), he added yet more new material to this palimpsestic creation, leaving his original film almost invisible beneath the cacophonous clutter of incompatible material. No sound version followed the structure of Gance’s 1927 film, and they should be considered entirely distinct from the silent original. Equally, his Austerlitz (1960) was a film co-written in the 1950s which again diverged from his original 1923 series outline. This perpetual contraction, expansion, and reconfiguration of Gance’s Napoleonic project in subsequent decades fermented critical confusion. Due to the lack of coherent celluloid evidence to examine, one of the most important studies of Gance proved unable to produce a detailed evaluation of Napoléon (Kramer/Welsh 1978). Kevin Brownlow’s painstaking restoration of the silent version led to further variant copies of Gance’s f ilm appearing between 1979 and 2000 – the latest edition (which includes the final triptych) has a length of 7500m. The ongoing project by the Cinémathèque Française has identified and catalogued 22 different versions of Napoléon, spanning 80 years, in an effort to understand and restore the two primary versions (Opéra and Apollo) of 1927 (Mourier 2012).\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015.

All rights reserved.\n\nPreface: Critical perspec tive\n\n27\n\nThe reaction to the re-release of Napoléon in the 1980s followed a similar pattern to that of 1927: popular acclaim, followed by critical division. Modern reviewers claimed that Gance’s ‘romantic’ (‘reactionary’) content was irreconcilable with his ‘modernist’ (‘progressive’) style. The same writers could deem Napoléon a ‘dramatically conventional, psychologically simplistic and politically suspect’ hagiography, yet praise it as ‘a triumph of audacious technique’ (Andrew 1999: 44). Gance’s intellectual value was often derided as ‘trite’ or ‘insincere’, usually with the claim that his ‘technical developments […] are seldom related to the meaning of his films’ (Thomson 1994: 273). No such review actually defines what Gance’s ideas are before dismissing them – writers seem unable or unwilling to negotiate Napoléon’s inherent characteristics. The painful reality that ‘film history is based on what’s available’ meant that Gance’s film was often treated as a kind of titanic aberrance – perhaps ‘historians can only take in so much’ (Brownlow 2005). Napoléon re-emerged at a time when film theory was least likely to accept it on its own terms. In his political study of Gance from 1984, Norman King argues that we cannot – and should not – trust any criticism that stems from the filmmaker’s own beliefs on the cinema. Such a position explains why he gives lengthy excerpts of Gance’s written texts but doesn’t evaluate the films in their light. Instead, King theorizes that Napoléon exemplifies ‘reactionary innovation’ – its viewers are ‘politicized’ through cinematic spectacle into ‘uncritical subjects’ (1984a: 213-15). Through lack of definition and any substantiating textual analysis, the central assertion that Gance’s sophisticated manipulation of imagery is inherently ‘reactionary’ remains an unqualified assumption. Even before stating his reasoning, King’s introduction contends it would be an ‘unexpected’ result for other studies to define Gance as ‘progressive’ (ibid.: 7). This self-censure had much to do with the psychological, political, and semiotic film theory of the 1970s that sought to denounce cinephilia as fetishism, scopophilia, and voyeurism. Many films were seen as ideologically manipulative delusions, detrimental to the health of the general public. (Only theorists, conveniently, could see through this illusionism.) The immersive experience of Napoléon was destined to confound a generation of critics who prided themselves on denigrating cinema’s emotional engagement. Brownlow’s restoration features an orchestral score by Carl Davis, recreating the performative element which is so essential to early cinema – but the novelty of this theatrical exhibition itself aroused suspicion. Richard Philpott argued that a pre-recorded score accompanying screenings would be ideologically preferential to the ‘elitism’ of a live orchestra (1983: 8-14).\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015.

All rights reserved.\n\n28\n\nA Revolution for the Screen\n\nSimilarly, Peter Pappas hailed Napoléon as a ‘great’ and ‘profound’ work, but the very enthusiasm the performances evoked was deemed to be a ‘fascist’ effect. Unable to endorse his own joyful reaction in the cinema, Pappas retrospectively chastises such emotion as morally dangerous (1981: 7-8). Though this puritanical attitude is no longer so prominent, nor so self-righteously proclaimed, in film studies today, its aftereffects can still be felt. ‘Critical distance’ is frequently held to be at the heart of objective analysis, the notion that scholars should keep themselves apart from the language of the artist and the distorting experience of art’s actualization. That Napoléon can still be seen at all is due to the enthusiasm of restorers like Brownlow, yet some have damned these very efforts as an ‘extravagance’ that could ‘prejudice’ scholastic sobriety (Thomson 1994: 272-3). In this view, enthusiasm becomes the enemy of critical argument: analytical competence is defined by a disparaging attitude towards a writer’s subject-matter. Faced with something that resists orthodox boundaries and classification, critics can become regrettably priggish. Scholars have responded to Gance in the same ruffled tone as those in the nineteenth century who complained that Victor Hugo’s prose was intent on ‘troubling us, offending us, buffeting us in the face’, leading readers to emerge from his novels in ‘a dishevelled, unseemly condition’ (Fraser’s Magazine 1866: 741). Opponents of Gance often repeat the same hope that he would ‘use wholesome restraint with becoming liberty, before the impulses, which should be his subjects, break into uncontrollable rebellion’ (ibid.: 745). Hugo wrote that critics were offended by Romanticism because it unbalanced their sensibilities; high drama was like the rolling ocean: ‘some people are exhilarated, others are sick’ (1840b: 1553). In the same way, early reviewers described Wagner’s music as a kind of ‘tonal typhoon’ that produced ‘attack[s] of aquatic nausea’ (Conrad 2011: 182-3). Twentieth-century critics cited both these artists as troublesome predecessors of Gance’s ‘excessive’ cinema. His films possessed an intimidating scale and febrile energy that left viewers as ‘overwhelmed’ and ‘lost’ as with Wagnerian opera (Miomandre 1927: 707). Napoléon was seen as a ‘barbarous and Hugolian masterpiece, which irritates us, which exhausts us with its virtuosity, by the ceaseless movement of its images, by its total absence of critical sense and even of intelligence’ (Bardèche/ Brasillach 1935: 242-3). Napoléon is the ultimate example of how a film can become cast out from established canons of art and taste. It is not the work of a single genre; it is not the work of a familiar ideology; it is a serial film never shown in serial format; it is a widescreen film made before widescreen cinema; it is the first of a series of six films, five of which were never made; it is so cinematic\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015.

Because of this intrinsic hybridity, critics and producers have tended to use Gance’s unwieldy creation as the means to different ends: the former want usable data, the latter want reliable profit. Both approaches have dismantled Napoléon, only to find it wanting. Yet trying to tame or control the precipitous character of such a film can only damage the work of art and our understanding of it. Napoléon is fascinating because of its strangeness, not despite it. Rather than criticize the film for what it is not, for what it fails to resemble, it would be more productive to examine Napoléon on its own terms. Critics would do well to heed the warning offered by Susan Sontag in her essay ‘Against Interpretation’, which attacks the distortive and self-serving ‘rules’ of academic analysis (1964: 77). As she later reiterated: ‘the intellectual experience is [not] opposed to the aesthetic experience […] The aesthetic experience is a form of intelligence’. The fact that ‘a great deal of what people call intellectual activity is aesthetic experience’ (Sontag 1995: 42) is particularly visible in some modes of film criticism. Evaluation does not begin away from the spell of film in cinemas but during this experience. Though Brownlow’s latest restoration of Napoléon has yet to be released on dvd, its potential impact on audiences in a domestic space cannot hope to recreate the effect the film has in the theatre. The scale and grandeur of Gance’s imagery was designed specifically for, and is uniquely suited to, cinematic exhibition for mass audiences. As much as any sequence or image may be described and analysed in print, the only way to comprehend its power is to experience it first-hand. This is something I can attest to with Napoléon, a film I have seen on three occasions projected on celluloid before an audience, accompanied by a live performance of Davis’s score. Accordingly, I have always tried to articulate the live presence of the film in a cinema, rendering its emotive resonance as well as its formal representation. Following Sontag’s dictum, I hope that in my own judgements the (immediate) aesthetic reaction of the cinematic experience can inform and enrich my (subsequent) close analysis. Physical unavailability and textual instability are the primary reasons for the critical neglect of Gance’s silent work. Whilst some argue that Napoléon will remain ‘forever out of reach’ as a complete text (Kaplan 1994: 9), it is surely an essential challenge for critics and historians to make sense of what remains. The reputations of canonical films are usually built upon their physical accessibility (prints, dvds) as well as their intellectual presence (documentation, scholarship) – luxuries that Napoléon and Gance have never possessed. I believe it both possible and desirable to perform\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015.

To this end, I have consulted a wide range of resources: multiple versions and fragments of Napoléon, archival documentation (much of which is translated here for the first time), and literary material. I have organized this book in a way that I hope will benefit any reader unfamiliar with Gance’s film or the history upon which it is based. Chapter 1 places Napoléon within a wider narrative of European political culture and the specific context of cinema in post-war France. The subsequent four chapters offer a chronological analysis of the film’s major sequences: chapter 2 discusses how the opening scenes of Napoléon shape our expectations of cinematic form and narrative content; chapters 3 and 4 deal with the representation of the French Revolution, both in terms of its historiographic method and the depiction of individual/collective power; chapter 5 looks in detail at the characterization of Bonaparte, examining the relationship between imagery, ideology, and film format. The next three chapters pursue a broader analysis of Gance’s treatment of marginality (chapter 6), melodrama (chapter 7), and class (chapter 8). Chapter 9 looks at the projects Gance conceived in the aftermath of Napoléon: Sainte-Hélène (the final episode of his six-part series) and Victor Hugo (a historical biopic), whilst my conclusion will summarize the main aspects of my argument.\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015.

All rights reserved.\n\n1.1 Introduction Interpretations of Gance’s film are often determined by critics’ ‘prejudicial hostility’ towards the historical Napoléon (Icart 1983: 178). Steven Englund argues that there is a tendency among Anglophone scholars to pursue an ‘inaccurate, anachronistic, and […] unfair’ comparison of Napoléon with Hitler and Stalin, in spite of the fact that the Emperor was neither ‘invoked’ by French, German, or Italian fascists nor by Russian communists, in the twentieth century (2004: 459). It is a common assumption that the ‘sinister’ legacy of Napoléon in some way sullies Gance’s film and that its portrait necessarily contains a ‘dangerous’ doctrine (Samuels 2004: 267). Such views attribute Napoléon with vague notions of ‘the political’ (definite article, indefinite meaning) and categorize it according to simplistic binaries of ‘left’/‘right’ or ‘reactionary’/‘progressive’. This ahistorical approach is unhelpful. As Norman King points out, the ‘political’ stance of European intellectuals like Gance in the 1920s was characterized by a cross-fertilization of ideas which renders terms like ‘left’ and ‘right’ obsolete (1984a: 140-6). It is equally important to challenge the view that interpretations of Napoléon were in any way consistent: he inspired an astonishingly diverse, and often entirely antithetical, set of ideologies. As Joseph Fouché told the Emperor during his reign: ‘some say you are a god, others that you are a devil; but everyone agrees you are more than a man’ (1824: I/182). After his death, Napoléon was ‘transformed into a mythical figure, an equivalent to those other Romantic archetypes of transgression and limitless desire: Faust, Satan, Prometheus, and Don Juan.’ (Bainbridge 2005: 451) This chapter outlines the history of Napoleonic messianism through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, locating Gance’s film within the cultural context of Romantic ideology and the political legacy of the Great War.\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015.

All rights reserved.\n\n1.2\n\nA Revolution for the Screen\n\nMessiahs of the nineteenth century\n\nIn the summer of 1789, the elected representatives of the French ‘third estate’ defied the clergy, the nobles, and the King of France to demand constitutional reform; their subsequent ‘Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen’ challenged the ‘divine right of kings’ and instated popular sovereignty. These actions triggered the French Revolution and unleashed immense moral and social forces that the ultra-conservative monarchies of Europe were desperate to contain. From 1792 until 1802, a series of wars were fought to ensure the survival of the Revolutionary Republic in the face of invasion from neighbouring kingdoms; from 1803 until his final defeat in 1815, Napoléon led France through further wars in an effort to establish a continent-wide system of political reform – he refashioned a chaotic map of innumerable feudal states and sprawling empires into a prototype for modern Europe. By dismantling the absolutist Holy Roman Empire in central Europe and challenging the hegemony of feudal Russia in the east, Napoléon encouraged the self-determination of nascent national groups. In 1805, the first Italian constitution was declared; in 1806, the formation of the Confederation of the Rhine was the first step towards a united Germany; in 1807, the Duchy of Warsaw fuelled Polish independence (to this day, Poland’s national anthem remains the only such hymn to celebrate the Emperor by name). Establishing his 1804 ‘civil code’ across much of Europe, Napoléon consolidated the Revolutionary principles of equality into legislative law – religious tolerance de-ghettoized Jews and other persecuted minorities for the first time in centuries. Many intellectuals in these previously disenfranchised peoples greeted the French Revolution as the ‘great necessity’ of the age and its aim of liberty as the ultimate ‘end’ of history itself (Hegel 1822-8: 20). France’s hubristic enterprise inspired both adulation and horror among contemporaries. The Revolution was alternately seen as the work of Christ or Antichrist, just as Napoléon’s miraculous rise from Corsican obscurity to world fame divided opinion: his republicanism as First Consul (from 1799) inspired hero-worship, but his career as Emperor (from 1804) was met with hostility. Even in ‘liberated’ regions, reformists such as Ludwig van Beethoven wavered in a state of ‘unconquerable ambivalence’ about Napoléon (Solomon 1978: 140). Elsewhere, conservatives were ravenously opposed to the man whose reign was built upon Revolutionary ideas. When Napoléon invaded Russia in 1812, the Orthodox Church encouraged peasants to view the French as ‘a legion of demons’ who were ‘commanded by the Antichrist’ (Ségur 1824: I/311). The subsequent campaign resembled a\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2015. Amsterdam University Press.

Even within the relative stability of Britain, hysterical volumes were written ‘proving Bonaparte to be the beast that arose out of the earth, with two horns like a lamb, and spake as a dragon whose number is 666’ (Mayer 1803: n. pag.). Lewis Mayer execrated Napoléon as ‘Lucifer and Gog’, prophesizing his ultimate defeat ‘in the mountains of Israel’ in the year 1809 (1806: 17). Though this prediction proved incorrect, the Emperor’s true defeat at Waterloo was seen as the logical endpoint of history, fulfilling the apocalyptic vision of St John in Revelation (Holmes 1819). In the wake of their final victory in 1815, the restored monarchies did their best to dispel reformists’ utopian delusions and affect a return to the preRevolutionary world order: national identities were once more subsumed by colonial empires. Much of the continent effectively became a police state in a mood of constant paranoia about ‘a threatening, unquantifiable, crepuscular underworld vowed to the annihilation of the status quo’ (Zamoyski 2000: 301). The death of the exiled Emperor on St Helena in 1821 did nothing to loosen his influence over the continent. As with Christ’s resurrection, rumours circulated that Napoléon had defied death and would miraculously return in the future. His name was associated with countless intrigues, revolts, and revolutions across Europe and the New World in the 1820s, and thousands of his former soldiers joined patriots and Romantics in pursuit of Napoleonic adventure. Literary responses were equally grandiose. Historians began to philosophize on the meaning of Napoléon’s role in the overall context of human progress. In the 1820s, German idealists postulated about the function of ‘World-Historical individuals’ as agents of the ‘World-Spirit’ (Weltgeist), the force propelling history towards a predestined end. Using Napoléon as an exemplar of this reasoning, G.W.F. Hegel wrote: There is a power within them which is stronger than they are […] Right is on their side, for they are the far-sighted ones: they have discerned what is true in their world and in their age, and have recognized the concept, the next universal to emerge. And the others […] flock to their standard, for it is they that express what the age requires […] [People] follow these leaders of souls because they feel the irresistible power of their own inner spirit pulling them in the same direction (1830: 83-5)\n\nThough these individuals possess great power, in channelling the revolutionary ‘force’ they must sacrifice happiness and choose ‘exertion, conflict,\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015.

Thomas Carlyle explored similar ideas in the 1830s, and his collection On heroes, hero-worship, and the heroic in history famously declares: ‘The History of the world is but the Biography of great men’ (1841: 34). Initiating social evolution and fulfilling the maximum potential of each stage of history, ‘the Great Man [becomes] the indispensable saviour of his epoch; – the lightning, without which the fuel never would have burnt’ (ibid.: 21). Carlyle believed the great man is a force of action, not merely of rhetoric: ‘He that works and does some Poem, not he that merely says one, is worthy of the name of Poet.’ (1845: I/74) This conception of Napoléon as both warrior and artist suited the diversity of interests his admirers possessed. As a youthful patriot, Józef Hoëné-Wronski had fought in the Polish uprising against Prussia in 1794; he then pursued a military career in Russia, after which he moved to France and studied logic and philosophy. At a ball celebrating Napoléon’s birthday in 1803, he experienced a vision in which it was revealed he would make an epochal intellectual discovery. The ‘transcendental philosophy’ HoënéWronski foresaw would provide ‘absolute laws’ underpinning ‘the whole of human knowledge’, and he later advised the Emperor that mathematics could provide the ultimate stability for the French Republic (1811: 185-8). Invested in a messianic conception of European destiny, he believed that Napoléon had heralded ‘a new epoch for the human race’, and his fall was due to an ‘invisible organization’ akin to the ‘Church of the Antichrist’ which sought to plunge the globe into the ‘hideous disorder’ of political anarchy (Hoëné-Wronski 1840: 72-3). Viewing Napoléon as a lost opportunity for the world, some authors attempted to rewrite history entirely. Louis Geoffroy’s Napoléon Apocryphe (1835) details the Emperor’s conquest of Russia, followed by his victory over Spain; Napoléon goes on to conquer Britain and North Africa, eliminate Prussia, partition Russia, and invade the Middle East via Constantinople; after the subsequent invasion and fall of the Far East and the rest of Africa, the whole of America is willingly subsumed into Napoléon’s new world order. However, all this was not simply a secular revolution but a combination of ‘Christianity and conquest […] formulated by two names: Christ and Napoléon’ (Geoffroy [1835] 1841: 278). Islam is abolished and the world’s Jews convert to Catholicism; when Napoléon dies in 1832, he is Emperor of a Christian universe. For Geoffroy, this history was an act of faith: ‘When I finished this book, I started to believe in it’ (ibid.: n. pag.).\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2015. Amsterdam University Press.

In this interpretation, Waterloo becomes Napoléon’s Golgotha and the exile on St Helena his spiritual redemption. After the July Revolution toppled the last of the French Bourbon monarchs in 1830, the ‘Citizen King’ Louis-Philippe sought to appease left-wing elements in the country. In 1840, royal permission was given for Napoléon’s earthly remains to return from St Helena to Paris and be interred in Les Invalides. Victor Hugo was among the crowd of ageing veterans and young devotees waiting for the cortege to arrive, and he observed the sun ‘doing its duty and magnificently appearing’ through the gloomy clouds just as Napoléon’s funeral carriage arrived (1840a: 21). Though the generation who fought in Napoléon’s wars was dying out, a new cadre of activists and writers were competing to claim the Emperor for their own ideologies – his symbolic return to France in 1840 coincided with a burgeoning of messianic literature. Amplifying Beauterne’s evangelical analogy, Simon Ganneau designated the battle of Waterloo as the martyrdom of a nation: ‘A people named France rose up and said: “All peoples are brothers”. And the Nations crucified France. Waterloo is the Golgotha-People. Waterloo is the Good Friday of the great Christ-People.’ (1843: 11-12) Turning the nation into a divine collective body was more than mere rhetoric: in 1838, Ganneau founded a new religion and proclaimed the beginning of the ‘era of Evadism’. This ‘hour of human virility’ began with the symbolic marriage of Mary-Eve (the ‘compound Genesiac female’) to Christ-Adam (the ‘compound Genesiac male’), forming the ‘Androgyne Evadam’ ([Ganneau] 1838: 3). Ganneau’s fusionism attempted to melt all opposites and antitheses into a single system; he took the title of ‘Mapah’, designating himself both mother and father, and his theology reconciled Christian pacifism with Napoleonic action: ‘Jesus and Napoléon: Jesus the Christ-Abel, Napoléon the Christ-Cain, great Beacons of the Centuries, Living Syntheses, sublime forms by which History has been transformed to return to the Unity-Adam’ (1843: 8). France was destined to provoke international redemption and return humanity to a state of prelapsarian oneness; Ganneau’s disciple Charles Caillaux prophesized that this would be the earthly utopia that the Revolution had promised: ‘the time of bread whiter than snow […] of revelation’ and ‘eternal peace’ (1840: 101). Ganneau was not the only Napoleonic messianist to found a religion. After experiencing a vision whilst visiting the battlefield of Waterloo in 1839,\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015.

Addressing a Slavic literary association in Paris, Towiański said that God had ‘honorifically’ designated the nineteenth century as the epoch in which the chosen nations would ‘wrest the [Holy] sceptre from the grip of terrestrial darkness’; he called upon ‘the spirit of Napoléon’ as the penultimate agent in the ‘luminous procession’ of saints who would inspire France and Poland to fulfil God’s will (1841: 10-14). This self-styled prophet quickly gathered a community of disciples around him, one of whom was the prominent Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz. Towiański not only performed a miraculous act of faith-healing on Mickiewicz’s wife but went on to stage a series of séances in which Napoléon and the Virgin Mary ‘spoke’ through him. Mickiewicz acted as host to these ceremonies, and used his academic position at the Sorbonne to oracularly glorify the Emperor’s career as ‘an extension of the work of Jesus Christ’. At one such lecture, lithographs depicting a vision of Napoléon at Waterloo were distributed to the audience: the Emperor wore a virginal communicant’s white veil, ‘his eyes turned towards heaven, his hands raised over a map of Europe’ – symbolic of his marriage to a unified continent. In contemplating this image, Mickiewicz ecstatically declaimed: ‘our souls have received a sacrament; we have celebrated one of the mysteries of the New Testament’ (1844: 292-301). Spiritual possession was a way of embodying the lost past, summoning its power to invigorate new creative acts. Whilst Mickiewicz took to signing his name ‘Adam-Napoléon’, the writer Gérard Labrunie reinvented his genealogy to become a descendent of the Roman emperor Nerva and the illegitimate son of Joseph Bonaparte. Renaming himself Gérard de Nerval, he identified with Christ and Napoléon as twin figures of messianic suffering: ‘Both wounded in their sides by a double mystery, / One spilled his blood to fecundate the Earth, / The other scattered into the sky the seeds of gods!’ (Nerval 1840: 735). Nerval suffered from schizophrenia and during a mental breakdown in 1841 he experienced a revelation concerning ‘the migration of souls’; he assured his friends that he was inhabited by Napoléon’s soul, which was ‘inspiring me and commanding me to do great things’ (1855: 489). This delusion of imperial reincarnation was not unique: the 1840s was a decade in which ‘more French madmen took themselves for Napoléon than for any other figure except Jesus Christ’ (Bell 2007: 306). Hoëné-Wronski was worried that no great redeemer had stepped forward to inherit Napoléon’s mission, so he spent the 1840s bombarding European monarchs with vast mathematical tracts that would guarantee harmonious social interaction. Roundly ignored by those in power, he tried to rekindle the Napoleonic spirit by forming the ‘Antinomian Union’: a ‘moral league’ of\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015.

At the same time, Alphonse-Louis Constant was urging Europe to ‘hail the spirit of revolution that propels us into the future’ (1848: 218). He believed that revolutions were like ‘storms that purify the air’ and men must ‘bow their heads’ to God’s anarchistic will; those who challenge religious dogma or overturn the state are not ungodly or bloodthirsty but martyrs ‘for world peace and universal harmony’ (ibid.: 181-2). The Catholic Church strongly objected to the Romantics’ recruitment of Jesus Christ for Revolutionary causes; his name became attached to various utopian projects, from Napoleonic messianism to communism and anarchist violence. Any writer who exhibited heresy was forcefully denounced, and the Church’s ever-expanding Index Librorum Prohibitorum condemned each new brand of spiritualism and socialism – wellsprings from which Romantic literature drew increasing inspiration. Nineteenthcentury Romanticism espoused deeply unconventional beliefs, challenging political as well as religious orthodoxy. The individual and collective impact of the movement was taken more seriously than the loose coherence of its views might suggest. Many of the writers mentioned thus far spent time in gaols or in exile for their involvement with networks of liberals, nationalists, and republican revolutionaries. The fear that Romantics inspired in royalist spies and conservative authorities was not unfounded. Constant claimed that the teachings of the ‘Mapah’ Ganneau inadvertently unleashed the great political crisis of the mid-nineteenth century. Having ‘completely lost his head’ under the influence of Evadist propaganda, ‘a nervy, moronic youth named Sobrier’ believed that he was ‘predestined to save the world by provoking the supreme crisis of a universal revolution’. During a period of civil unrest in February 1848, this ‘ranting madman’ rushed around the streets of Paris to harangue passers-by and demand that they march on the government. He disappeared when soldiers arrived to disperse the crowd, but fired his pistol into their ranks as he ran off. ‘This shot initiated revolution, and it was fired by a madman […] Without knowing what he was doing, Sobrier gave a jolt to the world.’ (Constant 1860: 523-4) Barricades went up across Paris and after weeks of fighting, King Louis-Philippe fled the country, ending monarchical rule in France. Thereafter, a wave of revolutions spread across Europe; throughout 1848-9, political Romanticism hoped to realize its ideals. A series of bloody riots and street battles left sections of Paris in ruins and the country without clear authority. Ganneau told his followers that ‘he was Louis XVII, returned to regenerate the Earth’ (Constant 1860: 522) and\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015.

He demanded that the Pope abdicate to make way for his alternate religion, then begged Hugo to become ‘Under-God’ or ‘SpiritSaint’ of the Christ-People (Karr 1853: I/284-5). Though Hugo bemusedly refused this offer, he was a significant presence in French politics and believed that the 1848 revolution would enable the establishment of an ideal republican state. He described the rebels’ barricades as the demolition of history before future reconstruction: ‘It was a pile of rubbish and it was Mount Sinai’ (Hugo 1862: IX/13). The leader who eventually emerged triumphant from the revolutionary wreckage was Louis-Napoléon, the late Emperor’s nephew. Elected President of France’s Second Republic in December 1848, he staged a coup d’état in 1851 and became the Emperor Napoléon III the following year. Hoëné-Wronski immediately wrote a lengthy epistle to this new ruler, demanding that he treat ‘the supreme goal of nation-states, begun so stridently by the Emperor Napoléon’ as ‘a true providential mission’ to fulfil (1851: v). Yet despite a popular myth that Louis-Napoléon was a (literal) ‘reincarnation’ of his ‘supernatural’ uncle (Robb 2007: 304), he proved to have none of the charisma or vision of the first Emperor. Hugo dubbed him ‘Napoléon-le-petit’, a man who presided over a ‘horrible, hypocritical, and inhuman’ government and legislated ‘a constitution-gibbet on which hung our every liberty’ (1852: 113). Hugo was the son of one of Bonaparte’s generals and saw himself as ‘the Napoléon of the Romantic movement’ (Robb 1997: 265). He demanded that artists become martyrs: ‘Lay down the pen, and go where you hear the grapeshot. Here is a barricade: be there. Here is exile: accept it. Here is the scaffold: so be it’ (Hugo 1864: 543). Hugo had fought on the streets in 1848 and tried to incite an uprising in 1851, after which he went into exile in the Channel Islands. Other French writers faded from the scene with less grandeur. The ‘Mapah’ died in obscurity during Louis-Napoléon’s presidency, leaving his wife (whom he believed to be a reincarnation of Marie-Antoinette) a ‘captive’ in the ‘state of permanent somnambulism into which he had plunged her’ (Constant 1860: 565). Constant rejected Ganneau’s teaching as that of a ‘false god’ and warned against the ‘enthusiast manias’ such revolutionaries inspired: ‘they are contagious, and it is dangerous to stand too close to the abyss of dementia’ (ibid.: 523). Another sober reflection on the failed ambitions of reformists is found in Ralph Waldo Emerson’s Representative Men, published soon after the revolutions of 1848-9. Napoléon is seen as the essence of the nineteenth century: enhancing the ‘mineral and animal force, insight and generalization’\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nNapoleonic ambition and historical imagination\n\n39\n\nof his age, he combined both ‘natural’ and ‘intellectual’ power, ‘as if the sea and land had taken flesh and begun to cipher’ (Emerson 1850: 225). However, though Napoléon possessed demiurgic potential, his efforts at world-changing reform were doomed to fail:\n\nCopyright © 2015. Amsterdam University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nHere was an experiment, under the most favourable conditions, of the powers of intellect without conscience. Never was such a leader so endowed and so weaponed; never leader found such aids and followers. And what was the result of this vast talent and power, of these immense armies, burned cities, squandered treasures, immolated millions of men, of this demoralized Europe? It came to no result. All passed away like the smoke of his artillery, and left no trace. He left France smaller, poorer, feebler, than he found it; and the whole contest for freedom was to be begun again (ibid.: 251).\n\nNevertheless, this defeat ‘was not Bonaparte’s fault’: the rise to prominence of any individual may refine their power but will simultaneously emphasize their faults. The Napoleonic project was ‘baulked and ruined’ by the fatalistic ‘nature of things, the eternal law of man and of the world’. The result, Emerson felt, would be the same ‘in a million [such] experiments’ (ibid.: 252-3). During the 1850-60s, European Romantics brooded on the fate of human greatness and collective action. In France, Constant hebraicized his name to Eliphas Lévi Zahed and retreated into the world of magic and the occult; the exiled Hugo continued to publish dazzlingly inventive condemnations of Napoléon III, demonstrating both the need for art’s sustained pressure on political life and his own belief in the artist’s superior position as social visionary. Though warriors such as Napoléon worked to demolish the old order by force, the reconstruction of humanity required a different form of greatness. Hugo classed the Emperor alongside other conquerors like Attila the Hun, Genghis Khan, Alexander the Great, and Julius Caesar – ‘all these vast, ferocious men are vanishing’ and not ‘without a kind of pious terror can one behold [these] stars changing to spectres’ (1864: 567). Destroyers like Napoléon could be admired only ‘on condition of their disappearance’: ‘Make room for better, greater men!’ (ibid.: 538). Similarly, in an essay on Beethoven, Richard Wagner defined the hero not as a military figure but as ‘the complete man in full possession of the purely human feelings of love, suffering, and power, in their highest, most powerful degrees’ (1851: 491). For Romantics, art was to be the new instrument of revolution: ‘The swordsmen are gone, now is the\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\n40\n\nA Revolution for the Screen\n\ntime for thinkers’ (Hugo 1862: III/123). Honoré de Balzac stood a plaster statuette of Napoléon on his cabinet, placing beneath it a piece of paper saying: ‘What he failed to achieve with the sword, I will accomplish with the pen’ (Werdet 1859: 331). Perhaps the grandest articulation of this impulse is found in Hugo’s William Shakespeare (1864). This bizarre crash course in bowdlerized history and great literature canonizes the author’s preferred pantheon of writers to create a vast treatise on the nature of genius. Hugo believed that geniuses were enriched by a superabundance of ‘nature and humanity’: these ‘great souls’ are simultaneously men and ‘superhuman men’, charged with leading social and spiritual enlightenment (1864: 358). Artists’ work benef ited all humanity society: ‘Genius is not made for genius, it is made for man. Genius on earth is God giving himself. Whenever a masterpiece appears, a distribution of God is taking place. The masterpiece is a variety of the miracle’ (ibid.: 424). Hugo deemed that ‘solar men’ are apostles charged with ‘the transport of civilization’ through the centuries: artists, not soldiers, must drag the human race into the future (ibid.: 227-42).\n\nCopyright © 2015. Amsterdam University Press. All rights reserved.\n\n1.3\n\nTowards a new era\n\nFor the rest of the nineteenth century, the utopian society that Romantics had envisaged remained a remote ideal. Napoléon III fell from power during France’s disastrous war with Prussia and the German States in 1870-1. However, the first act of the Third Republic that replaced his imperial regime was to violently suppress a socialist uprising in Paris: government forces killed more communards and civilians in this one week than had died during the year-long ‘Terror’ of 1793-4. The brutal extermination of this short-lived ‘Commune’ in the nation’s capital drove a permanent wedge between French traditionalists and socialists, setting in motion bitter political rivalries that would resurface at regular intervals during the twentieth century. Karl Marx felt that the event revealed the ‘hideous face of bourgeois civilization’ and pointed to the co-ordination of French and German ruling classes to achieve a ‘bloody triumph over the self-sacrificing champions of a new and better society’ (1871: 201-2). The defeat of France enabled the unification of Germany in 1871, but the state that liberal intellectuals had dreamt of shaping throughout the century became increasingly conservative, combatting rising socialism with an increasing appeal to militaristic nationalism.\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nNapoleonic ambition and historical imagination\n\n41\n\nIn the last years of the nineteenth century, some artists felt that the bourgeois establishment had stifled the ambitions of more radical social reform. From the midst of what he considered a ‘tame, mediocre, emasculated society’, Friedrich Nietzsche looked back at the dynamism of the Napoleonic era and its enigmatic leader with a degree of longing: Great men, like great ages, are explosives in which a tremendous force is stored up; their precondition is always, historically and psychologically, that for a long time much has been gathered, stored up, saved up, and conserved for them [...] Once the tension in the mass has become too great, then the most accidental stimulus suffices to summon into the world the ‘genius’, the ‘deed’, the ‘great destiny’ (1889: 547-9).\n\nThe eponymous prophet of Nietzsche’s Thus Spoke Zarathustra is an emblem of just such an ‘explosive’ agency and natural power:\n\nCopyright © 2015. Amsterdam University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nI love all those who are as heavy drops, falling one by one out of the dark cloud that hangs over men: they herald the advent of lightning, and, as heralds, they perish. Behold, I am a herald of the lightning and a heavy drop from the cloud; but this lightning is called overman (1883-5: 128).\n\nAs ‘overman’ (Übermensch), Zarathustra becomes the centre of endless wordplay on ‘overgoing’, ‘downgoing’, and ‘self-overcoming’ – a figure capable of rejuvenating the stagnant moral and social order of fin-de-siècle Europe. The French historian Frédéric Masson also expressed a deep personal connection to an era he was too young to have experienced. Born in 1847, he regarded himself as an orphan ‘adopted’ by the Republic after his father was killed in the 1848 Revolution (Masson 1894: ix-x). Writing at the end of the century, Masson recollected his childhood wonderment at hearing stories from Napoleonic veterans, touching their battle scars as they spoke: To this new gospel, the gospel of He who is no more – like that Other, the Son of Man, but who is Man itself – these witnesses bore the proof of their wounded bodies. [As they spoke,] their Holy tears fell on my forehead, baptizing me what I am and shall remain: a loyal believer (ibid.: xx-i).\n\nThe issue of faith is more prominent in Léon Bloy’s L’Âme de Napoléon (1912), which pursues the same line of Catholic interpretation as Beauterne in the 1840s:\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\n42\n\nA Revolution for the Screen\n\nCopyright © 2015. Amsterdam University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nNapoléon is the Face of God in the darkness […] Napoléon is unexplainable and, without question, the most unexplainable of men, because he is, before all and above all, the Prefigurer of he who is to come and who is perhaps not far off, a prefigurer and a precursor very close to us, signified by all those extraordinary men who have preceded him throughout the whole of history (1912: 8-9).\n\nMaking spurious claims as to the Emperor’s Catholicism, Bloy believed that ‘History is like an immense liturgical text […] whose meaning remains whelmed in secrecy’; Napoléon is a herald of the Second Coming – the ‘union of symbols and fulfilment of every prophesy’ concealed within the divine course of human evolution (ibid.: 14-15, 58). Thanks to his bigoted attacks on numerous contemporary writers, Bloy was despised by the left wing as a ‘false prophet’, an ‘Apocalyptic prattler’, a ‘coprophore who jumbles symbols and mystical ejaculations’ (Suarès 1933: 34). Yet those who attacked him were just as keen to claim Napoléon for their own beliefs. André Suarès confessed that he felt drawn to the period of national history which had become legendary for its unfulfilled promise: ‘France cannot think of Napoléon without trembling; and in her trembling, as much as she regrets it, she is afraid of him – afraid of the longing she still has for him’ (1912: 11-12). Though the volume of Romantic literature on Napoléon had dwindled by the start of the twentieth century, the last expression of Napoleonic messianism was inspired by the Great War – an apocalypse no less significant than the French Revolution. This ‘storm’ that broke across Europe in 1914 was not the moral revolution that Nietzsche had imagined, but it profoundly altered the course of world history. The defeat of the Central Powers in 1918 triggered the collapse of four world empires: those of Austria-Hungary, Germany, Ottoman Turkey, and Russia. Only after the Great War were the houses of Habsburg, Hohenzollern, Osman, and Romanov overthrown – their respective emperors being direct descendants of those who Napoléon had fought a century earlier in what had (until 1914) been known as the (first) ‘Great War’. When politicians met to discuss the future of Europe in 1919, the ‘great model’ they had in mind was the Congress of Vienna – a series of meetings undertaken by the Allied powers after Napoléon’s defeat. It was imperative that ‘something better’ emerge from the catastrophe of 1914-18 – this was a chance for ‘European civilization’ to right the wrongs of a century of lost opportunities (Cooper/MacMillan 2009: 126). Indeed, the causes of the 1914 war could be traced back to the treaties of 1814-15:\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nNapoleonic ambition and historical imagination\n\n43\n\nCopyright © 2015. Amsterdam University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nThe Vienna settlement imposed an orthodoxy which not only denied political existence to many nations; it enshrined a particularly stultified form of monarchical government; institutionalized social hierarchies as rigid as any that had existed under the ancien regime; and preserved archaic disabilities […] By excluding whole classes and nations from a share in its benef its, this system nurtured envy and resentment, which flourished into socialism and aggressive nationalism (Zamoyski 2007: 569).\n\nIn 1919, the Treaty of Versailles and the formation of the League of Nations (the forerunner of the United Nations) were attempts to diffuse the effects of these grievances that had built up throughout the nineteenth century. In the wake of the Great War, many writers reflected on the destiny of Europe. Just as Lord Byron began his post-Napoleonic epic Don Juan with the words ‘I want a hero’ (1819-24: I/3), so Elie Faure’s post-war study of Napoléon is dedicated ‘To he, whoever he may be, among the leaders of the universal revolution, whatever form it may take, who will possess the divine virtue to impose upon it the order which it will establish in his heart’ (1921: n. pag.). Writing in the immediate aftermath of Napoléon’s fall, Byron was searching for a subject worthy of admiration; writing exactly 100 years after the death of the Emperor, Faure looks back to the French Revolution to prophesize a future messiah. Faure calls Napoléon ‘a poet of action’ whose achievements were ‘the most decisive in the spiritual history of humanity’ since those of Christ. Both men were deemed ‘immoral’ because they ‘overthrew every social habit and prejudice of an age, dissolved and dispersed families, and precipitated the whole world into an abyss of war, glory, misery, and illusion’ (ibid.: 10). Echoing the solar imagery of Zarathustra, Faure envisions Napoléon as an ‘overman’ capable of ‘breaking down the gates before the sun’ (ibid.: 24). As a Nietzschean prophet, Napoléon ‘sanctifies the morality of conflict and condemns the immorality of ease’, complacency being a bourgeois quality that fosters oppressive social systems and moral stagnation. Faure uses Nietzsche’s phrase ‘beyond good and evil’ to describe Napoléon as a man who tries ‘to build the world after [his own] vision’ (ibid.: 260-3). Faure viewed this construction of a new world as a parallel to artistic endeavour: ‘art is action which is dreamed, action is art which is lived’ (ibid.: 235). As such, Faure variously calls Napoléon a poet, a conductor, a symphonist, a painter, a sculptor, a storm, and a demiurge; France becomes his musical instrument, his orchestra, and even his horse. The era’s whirlwind of social and political change is seen as work of musical\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\n44\n\nA Revolution for the Screen\n\nharmonization: Bonaparte was a composer-conductor of ‘Napoleonic symphonies’ (ibid.: 209). Genius enabled him to communicate this spirit of transformation to others, endowing society with an unprecedented sense of collective agency: The day when a few people realized that one man had been able to grow to unlimited heights, to raise men above themselves, to let loose upon the world an impetuous stream of new forces and new ideas – and all this against a social system and, above all, a moral order which were age-old – Napoléon’s spiritual sphere of attraction really began to take effect (ibid.: 263).\n\nNapoléon represents not a simplistic national figurehead or ideal political leader but a symbol of transcendent forces that lie within the individual – he demonstrated the ‘central force’ that lies within everyone but that we ‘do not know how to use’ (ibid.: 138). Faure demonstrates his argument by pointing to the diverse artistic, social, and ideological impact of Napoléon over the intervening century: from the music of Beethoven to the philosophy of Nietzsche. Faure also believed that Napoléon was essentially paradoxical:\n\nCopyright © 2015. Amsterdam University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nFrom a moral point of view, Napoléon is surely the Antichrist, as the disciples of Christ conceived of the Antichrist. And yet, in the depths of reality, he is undoubtedly the closest to Christ than was the most powerful of his disciples […] These two are the only known shades of Prometheus on Earth (ibid.: 9-11).\n\nIt was Napoléon’s chimerical dream of achieving peace by waging war that made him ‘the fraternal antithesis of Christ’; he was a ‘free’ agent, yet made a ‘slave’ by his ambition (ibid.: 185, 205). Yet it is precisely this stubbornness in the face of overwhelming odds that Faure admires; the tragedy of Napoléon’s forlorn pursuit was the basis of his continued greatness and relevance to the modern world: He forged ahead, and, despite everything – under grapeshot and in snow, even when he was crushing the people at the same time as he was crushing the old framework which wanted them imprisoned – he carried the new hope of mankind, an illusion still perhaps, but for that very reason a force, and exactly the force of the century at the head of which he was marching (ibid.: 160).\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015.

All rights reserved.\n\n1.4\n\n45\n\nCinema and the Napoleonic project\n\nIn order to continue this Napoleonic momentum into the twentieth century, a new solution to cultural divisions must be found. At the end of the nineteenth century, intellectuals like Edouard Schuré viewed orthodoxy as a barrier to truth: the ‘salvation of humanity’ depended on the ‘conciliation and synthesis’ of all the world’s major religions (1889: 16). Only through this union of divergent positions could a ‘science of the spirit’ prevail, paving the way for international understanding (Schuré 1912: 435). The views of such intellectuals were not far removed from the language of Ganneau’s fusionism of the 1840s; even if individual religions were deemed to be defunct, the religious impulse was not. Hugo wrote that ‘a religion is a translation’ but insisted a less distorted path must be found to access the divine reality behind humanity’s religious articulation (1863-4: 1085). Pursuing the same argument after the cataclysm of the Great War, Abel Gance wrote that Christ’s reliance on words was a source of profound regret and necessarily limited the extent to which his ideas could be understood (1930: 69). Bound by cultural specificity, written language was an outdated instrument; if mankind was to shed its materialistic individualism and achieve genuine social reform, it must find a means to speak ‘directly with the human spirit’ (ibid.: 145). Gance entered the film industry as an actor in 1909, but within three years he had established himself as a scenarist and director. He swiftly embraced cinema as a ‘faith’ whose strength was growing throughout the world (Gance 1912: 10). After achieving commercial success with a number of quickly made melodramas during the early 1910s, Gance began to conceive projects of a considerably larger scale. If the latest films from America (particularly those by Cecil B. DeMille and D.W. Griffith) demonstrated the technical possibilities of the medium, the Great War provided the motive to undertake weightier subject matter. Accordingly, in the summer of 1917, Gance outlined a trilogy of films to be based on the war and its (imagined) aftermath: J’accuse, Les Cicatrices, and La Société des Nations. Simultaneously, he planned a second trilogy focused on religious themes: Ecce Homo, Les Atlantes, and La Fin du Monde. Both series were to demonstrate the disastrous consequences of the world’s political shortsightedness and spiritual cynicism and to suggest a new way forward for the rebuilding of society on universal values. The first of these films to go into production was Ecce Homo (1918), in which the modern-day prophet Novalic (Albert t’Serstevens) preaches pacifism and the reconciliation of world philosophies. He is initially greeted\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2015. Amsterdam University Press. All rights reserved.\n\n46\n\nA Revolution for the Screen\n\nwith derision by the materialistic populace; however, by translating his ideas into works of cinema, he is eventually able to convince the crowd of his message. Though Gance abandoned Ecce Homo before it was completed, another prophetic figure appears in J’accuse – his next completed project. The horrors of the Great War turn the pacif ist poet Jean Diaz (Romuald Joubé) from a naïve dreamer into a radical visionary. Like Novalic’s cinematized ideology, Jean’s literature is transformed into imagery; Gance thus uses cinematic technique to link the mission of the on-screen visionary to his own as filmmaker. At the end of J’accuse, Jean voices the filmmaker’s own accusations against the complacent civilian population who are unworthy of the millions who have died for their sake. The film climaxes with a terrifying sequence in which thousands of dead soldiers rise from their graves and confront the living in order to make them change their lives. Gance juxtaposes a shot of the marching dead with footage of the victory parade through the Arc de Triomphe in Paris after the Great War. This ironic contrast pits the superficial pomp of official celebration against the reality of death and destruction. The Arc was commissioned by Napoléon to memorialize a generation of men and women who had fought for a recognizable purpose and to cement the link between the French Revolution and the wars he continued in its name. Napoléon’s remains had passed under the arch in 1840, just as the body of Victor Hugo had lain in state there in 1885. Gance saw the Europe of 1919 as an unworthy successor to the Europe commemorated by Napoléon’s monument. In his next film, La Roue, Gance’s characters are weighed down by the fatalities of economic and psychological circumstance; narratively and aesthetically, they are unable to escape the titular ‘wheel’ of fate, which condemns them to forever repeat their mistakes. La Roue points to a much wider cultural concern with a world that seems incapable of breaking free from its own past. The tremendous commercial success of J’accuse and the critical impact of La Roue enabled Gance to embark on the largest project of his career. In a spate of interviews and public speeches during the mid-1920s, the filmmaker set out his view of cinema as the ultimate synthesis of ideas, a medium that offered a chance to reimagine human communication and overcome cultural sterility. Using rhetorical enthusiasm not dissimilar to Ganneau’s annunciation of the ‘era of Evadism’ in 1838, or Constant’s call for revolution in 1848, Gance proclaimed the arrival of ‘the Time of the Image’ in 1927: Every legend, every mythology and every myth, every founder of religion and every religion itself, every great figure of history, every tangible echo of\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015.

Film was uniquely capable of reigniting social idealism in the wake of global catastrophe, finding the ideal expression for Faure’s investment in the powerful ‘illusion’ of Napoleonic hope. Gance wrote: ‘We’re charging on horses we’ve fashioned from clouds, and when we fight it’s to force reality to become a dream.’ Faith was required to sustain this transformative force: ‘those who don’t believe in cinema’ will fail to see ‘the most conclusive proof’ of its vision (ibid.: 97). Napoléon was to be the ultimate expression of Gance’s belief in cinema as both art and religion. Gance counted Napoléon among the ‘great line of idealist republicans, the first of whom was Christ’ (1927f). He was a successor to the visionaries in Ecce Homo and J’accuse and no less defined by predetermined fate than the characters of La Roue. It was precisely because Napoléon didn’t represent any specific political party that Gance saw him as a prophetic figure. As the literature of the nineteenth-century century amply demonstrated, the Emperor had come to embody any number of conflicting desires and forms of representation: he was a figure who embodied the synthesis, and transcendence, of divergent ideas. Whilst Napoléon had waged war in order to create a united Europe, Gance’s own revolution would be through art. On 11 November 1924, exactly six years after the end of the Great War, Gance recorded a conversation about his forthcoming film with its chief financier, Hugo Stinnes. Both men wanted to emphasize Napoléon’s ‘pacifist work’ rather than his military career, and Gance noted with approval that Stinnes ‘understood Bonaparte’s basic psychology: he did not like war, but was trying to create a universal republic’ (1924-7). Less understanding was the right-wing French press, which in early 1924 condemned Napoléon for being funded by foreigners like the Russian Vladimir Wengeroff and the German Stinnes. The Wengeroff-Stinnes company (abbreviated to Westi) was built on industrial profits from France’s recent military enemy, and xenophobic journalists found the notion that Germans would ‘profit’ from ‘one of our most glorious figures’ both ‘exploitative’ and ‘repugnant’ (L’Eclair 1924: 1). There was a fierce exchange of views in the press, and Gance’s financial administrator Edouard de Bersaucourt had to publish an explanatory letter to allay accusations of a ‘German influence’ on the film (1924: 1). After accusations of being Francophobic, François Coty worried that Napoléon would be unpalatably Francophile by\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015.

Gance responded by saying that J’accuse offered ‘sufficient vindication’ of his anti-war credentials (1925d). Napoléon was inspired by ‘the War, the Ocean, and Great Art’: rather than pursuing a ‘political’ agenda, the film was propaganda for cinema itself (Gance 1924b). In order to ‘conclusively’ counter those who believed that Napoléon would be a work of ‘French imperialism’, Gance planned to rerelease J’accuse through the League of Nations in order to promote the cause of pacifism (1924f). In fact, internationalism was at the heart of Gance’s Napoleonic project. Both the first-choice actors for the young Napoléon (Nicolas Roudenko) and his adult incarnation (Ivan Mosjoukine) were Russian. Even after Mosjoukine reluctantly turned down the lead role, the film counted a large number of émigrés among its cast and crew. Furthermore, when Westi collapsed in the spring of 1925, Napoléon was taken over by the Société Générale des Films (sgf) – a company founded by another Russian, Jacques Grinieff. As Gance pointed out, the financial basis of Napoléon was as multinational as its personnel, forming ‘an International Society’ (1925c, 1925e). Whilst Napoléon had sought to federalize the political map of Europe in the 1800s, Gance had similarly ambitious plans for the continent’s industrial infrastructure in the 1920s. In 1927, he invited various European film companies to form a production association called ‘Occident’, the first of other continental syndicates that would ultimately constitute an ‘International Film League’. As Hoëné-Wronski’s ‘Antinomian Union’ attempted to shape world events in the 1840s, so Gance envisaged an ‘Academy of Ten’ in the 1920s: an elite cadre of European filmmakers whose work would form the artistic and moral basis of world cinema. The chief project for this association was Les Grands Initiés, a series of films depicting the prophets of major religions. Inspired by Schuré’s 1889 study of the same name, Gance’s huge project would demonstrate the commonality of diverse belief systems to promote universal confraternity: millions of spectators could experience films ‘of the most profound religious nature’, and the series would be ‘a new gospel for the eyes’ (Gance 1927i). Like many intellectuals in the post-war years, Gance rejected ‘the politics of politicians’ (Parker 1998: 271) and sought to use art to engage directly with an international public. Just as Hoëné-Wronski had done a century earlier, Gance pestered politicians with grandiose formulae for world peace. In May 1928, he sent a lengthy document to the League of Nations, proposing the creation of a ‘Cinematographic Section’ in their organization (Gance 1928a). Not only would this further the anti-war cause to which the League was expressly committed, it would also cinematize the process of pacifism itself. Gance envisioned that his cinematic wing would produce and distribute a new brand of ‘world cinema’ dedicated to the overthrow of social prejudice,\n\nA Revolution for the Screen : Abel Gance's Napoleon, Amsterdam University Press, 2015.

Films would be used as instruments of universal education and cultural reconciliation. Gance even commissioned a statistical survey to substantiate his belief that the world was ready to receive his message of universal fraternity, and wrote to a series of financial institutions to convince them to back his grandiose project. His view was that cinema ‘belongs to the whole world’; just as every race and religion had the ‘duty’ to use film art ‘to explore the depths of their existence’, so Gance believed that governments were morally obliged to offer economic support for his scheme (1928f). Ecce Homo was the first of many religiose projects in which Gance aimed to ‘give a god back to mankind’ through cinema (1976). The director himself went on to play the prophet Jean Novalic in his first sound film, La Fin du Monde (1930); Gance’s appearance as the crucified Christ in the opening depiction of a passion play overtly signals his messianic conception of cinema. Similarly, in the post-apocalyptic narrative of his unrealized film La Divine Tragédie (1947-51), the last surviving members of the human race are confronted by a prophet who projects the life of Christ onto a Turin Shroud-like garment. Gance believed that a cinematized Passion was ‘the sole possible ideographic symbol of deliverance’ for the redemption of modern man (1949: 34). Only through its visual mediation "
