        "text": "Banker and financier Graham Lawlor is persuaded to invest in the Silver Shield Mines and become president of the company. Harris, Brennen and Lester, the promoters, are frauds. Lawlor sends word to his son Trevor who is practicing law in a small town, and tells him to give up his practice and take the secretaryship of the company. Trevor comes to look things over. He is convinced there is something wrong, refuses the secretaryship and warns his father; the two quarrel and Trevor returns to his practice. Lester, the mine's junior partner, makes love to his stenographer Brenda Wray, then casts her off. Ugly rumors get about regarding the stability of the Silver Shield Mine. The others try to throw all the blame for the failure on Lawlor, He declares, however, that he has papers in his possession which will exonerate him. They determine to get these incriminating papers. They bribe Lawlor's servant to steal them. Brenda, who has visited Lester's rooms to demand justice, overhears the plot. Trevor comes to town to defend his father. Brenda calls on him and tells him who the thief is. Thompson, the servant, is arrested and turns State's evidence. On his evidence Lawlor is exonerated, and Brennen, Harris, and Lester are arrested.\n\nJust as the bead clerk and his assistants are closing up the jewelry store for the day, a package containing a very costly necklace arrives by special messenger. The large safe deposit vault has been closed for the night and the time clock set. The head clerk is fearful to leave the necklace in the store and so decides to take it home. His actions have been closely watched by one of the junior clerks, with sinister and stealthy glances. As soon as the head clerk has gone, his young assistant hastily leaves the store and meets one of his pals, whom he tells about the necklace. It does not need a second glance to learn that his pal is a professional burglar and his interest in the necklace is very keen. Jordan, the head clerk, when he reaches home, puts the necklace in a small house safe. He has an engagement that evening, and is obliged to leave his wife alone. Later she decides to retire, and has no sooner done so than she hears a noise in the room below. She goes downstairs and on entering the room is met by the young clerk and his companion burglar. They seize her and she falls in a faint, continuing their work upon the safe, they have just succeeded in opening it when some medical college students who are on a lark, pass the house and seeing the open window, throw a skull which they are carrying, through the window into the room. It falls directly in front of the burglars who are so startled and frightened at the gruesome sight they hastily retire from the room. Mrs. Jordan, who has recovered, hastily opens the safe, takes out the necklace from the case in the safe and hides it in the hollow of the skull and resumes her position upon the floor. The burglars return, open the door of the safe, take out the case and are so surprised and disgusted on seeing nothing in it they hurriedly take their departure from the house. They have no sooner left, when her husband returns and finds her lying upon the floor. He picks her up. She smiles and then bursts into a laugh and picking up the skull, she quickly extracts the necklace from it. In his happiness at her safety and her cleverness in outwitting the burglars, he can only give her a kiss of appreciation. The next morning, Mrs. Jordan comes to the store with him, and while there, she recognizes the young clerk as one of the burglars of the night before. Police headquarters is notified by telephone and on the arrival of the police, the young fellow is taken into custody and through him, his pal is arrested.\n\nSwift Wind, a young chief, loves Dancing Fawn. In their ramblings they, too, see white wolves, which is an object of fear and veneration among the Indians, and return to the village. The two are betrothed by the old chief, but old Red Nose, the medicine man, demands her hand for himself. The chief, fearing his magic powers, considers. Dancing Fawn runs away to her lover. Swift Wind is taught a secret by an old trapper, \"If a trap is baited with an animal's own hair the iron jaws will never fail to catch it.\" The Indian decides how he will overthrow his rival. At his instruction Dancing Fawn cuts off a lock of hair from the sleeping medicine man. With it Swift Wind baits the trap. The next day a wolf is caught and as the Indians approach the trap the beast turns into the medicine man. The hand of the great father has proven his love again and Swift Wind and his sweetheart are united."
