        "text": "I have returned to discuss some more horror films from 1971. I’ve been putting this off for two weeks. Firstly, because there are so many films to go through, and I’m a chronic procrastinator. Second, because I’ve been a little disheartened by the sheer amount of mediocre horror films in the early '70s, and the lack of great films that I’m enthusiastic about.\n\nI won't have much to say about most of these, since they don't offer much material, and because it's been a couple of weeks since I've seen them, so I may have forgotten a few details. But anyways, let's get things started with the premiere of Cold Eyes of Fear in Italy on April 6th.\n\nIt begins, of course, with an eroticized assault. This guy busts into this gal's apartment and starts going at it, when… Sike! It's a dinner theater play! But wait, I think I saw four walls in that room, there was no audience!\n\nThe real plot of the film gets going when two guys invade the home of a high judge and take his son and the son's girlfriend hostage, while they set up an explosive at the judge's office.\n\nThe film was directed by Enzo G. Castellari, who would go on to direct the Franco Nero film Il cittadino si ribello in 1974, a classic piece of Eurocheese. Castellari seems to specialize in stories of men violently striking back at the corrupt system, man! He also loves low-angle shots of doorknobs.\n\nUp next, we have The Zodiac Killer, which premiered in San Francisco on the 7th.\n\nIt's about what you'd expect from a sleazy low-budget flick made to capitalize on current events. There's not much to say about it, other than that the director used the film in order to try to catch the real Zodiac. He would have audience members write on some cards after the screenings, and he actually hoped to find the Zodiac's handwriting on one of the cards. Certainly a noble attempt, I guess.\n\nNext, on the same day, we fly over to Fremont, Nebraska for the premiere of the Filipino production Beast of the Yellow Night. It's from Filipino auteur Eddie Romero, who brought us such classics The Blood Drinkers and the Blood Island trilogy. It stars his regular leading man John Ashley, who also produced the film this time around.\n\nAshley makes some deal with the Devil in order to stay alive on Earth, but in order to do so, he must occasionally transform into a goofy monster man and kill people. Y'know, the standard conditions in most contracts.\n\nIt's a slightly more watchable film than Romero's other works, but not by much. By the end, they return to the same house I've seen in Romero's other films to have the thrilling climax, in which I can't remember what happened.\n\nNext, we head to New York City for the premiere of The Mephisto Waltz on the 9th.\n\nIt's a big-budget film released by Twentieth Century-Fox, starring Alan Alda as a music critic who discovers his talent as a pianist, with the help of creepy Curt Jurgens who may have some sinister intentions. Meanwhile, Alda's wife, Jacqueline Bisset, smells something evil afoot.\n\nEven though this is a theatrical release, it may as well be another one of those Movies of the Week on ABC about a sinister secret conspiracy, only slightly more polished. The highlights are hearing the piano recitals, they sure loved the piano in the '70s. Oh, and the scariest thing in the film, a dog wearing a human mask.\n\nNext, we fly back to Italy for the premiere of The Man with Icy Eyes on the 10th.\n\nIt is set in Albuquerque, as a young, 12-year-old Walter White is off somewhere learning how to lie. It stars Antonio Sabato as a journalist trying to find out who assassinated a local senator. Co-starring as Sabato’s boss at the newspaper is Victor Buono, twice voted People Magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive.\n\nSabato keeps calling Buono a \"redneck\". Buono is many things, but a redneck he is not. You can also tell this was written by Italians when one woman says, \"I was returning from McDonald's.\" America! We love McDonald's!\n\nWe're flying back to NYC on the 14th, for the premiere of a double bill from British producer Tony Tenser. First up, The Blood on Satan's Claw.\n\nIt’s another story of witchcraft in the Middle Ages, with a youth cult sneaking off into the woods and playing games which usually end in a ritual sacrifice. In the leading man role is Barry Andrews, star of Dracula Has Risen from the Grave and runner-up in the Roger Daltrey lookalike contest.\n\nThere’s a scene foreshadowing Evil Dead II, where Andrews has to battle a severed hand and kill it. This seemed to be a popular trope in British horror films of the time, such as in Dr. Terror’s House of Horrors. Clearly, Sam Raimi was a fan.\n\nThen there's The Beast in the Cellar, starring Flora Robson as an elderly woman reminiscing with her sister about their father, meanwhile, word comes to them about a killer in the neighborhood, slaughtering army men. It almost feels like two different films clashing with each other, a family drama interrupted by a monster movie, but the two plots do eventually converge.\n\nNeither of these two films are all that great, but they're not bad. They're certainly a step up from most of Tony Tenser's other productions.\n\nWe're flying back to Italy once again, we seem to be making a lot of round trips. We have a film titled Something Creeping in the Dark, which premiered on the 15th. The biggest name in the cast is Farley Granger, who you film school kids may know as the gay guy from those Hitchcock films.\n\nGranger plays a killer who’s being transported to prison by two officers. They notice a mansion up on the hill, which is only a model…\n\nThe three of them, along with a colorful cast of characters, all decide to stay at the castle for the night while the roads are flooded, and goddamn it, it's another one of these! Pass!\n\nNext, we're flying over to France for the premiere of The Shiver of the Vampires on the 21st. It was directed by Jean Rollin, and was the second in his series of erotic vampire flicks.\n\nIt follows a married couple who decide, for some ungodly reason, to stay at another rundown old castle with a group of eccentric, flamboyant vampires. In typical French fashion, half of the men go to the same hairdresser as Wes Anderson.\n\nIt's quite a dull sit, which might only be worthwhile as background noise at a Halloween party or something.\n\nUp next, The Incredible 2-Headed Transplant premiered in San Francisco on the 28th. It stars Bruce Dern as a scientist developing a method to transplant a head from one body to the other, starting with animals and then eventually graduating to humans. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nIt also stars Mr. Shaggy Top 40, Casey Kasem, as Dern's buddy. It's a pretty sorry, little film, but if you're really curious, there is a RiffTrax version to watch. The film was distributed by American-International Pictures and remade the following year as The Thing with Two Heads, starring Ray Milland and Rosey Grier.\n\nWhen Bruce Dern appeared on The Tonight Show in 1978, he claimed he wasn’t paid for his involvement in the production. The account on IMDb runs thus…\n\n\"He was issued a check for $1,700 during filming, and when he went to the bank to cash his check, the check bounced. When he returned to the set on the next day scheduled for filming, the set had already been shut down.\"\n\nThen we have Alien Terror, released on an unspecified date in April, another Mexican production starring Boris Karloff which came out years after his death. There's a humanoid alien who comes down to Earth in the 19th century wanting to take over the world, and Karloff is a scientist developing, I don't know, some kind of laser cannon? It sucks, not much to say.\n\nEven less exciting is the final horror film of April, The Reincarnate, which premiered in Canada on the 30th. We'll be seeing plenty of awesome Canadian horror in the '70s, but this ain't one of 'em.\n\nThe only thing I can remember clearly is the name of a Satanic cult or tribe known as the Sakana. I don’t understand, where are the Fishmen?\n\nMaybe they showed up at the end, too bad I fell asleep at that point. I watched a very crappy VHS print of this thing, which would be forgiven if there were an interesting plot in there. Oh well, see you in May…"
