Well, let’s indulge in a little fantasy. If you could see any surviving silent film on the big screen, which film would you choose?\n\nThere are lots of choices so I decided to go in a slightly different direction this time and say that I would really, really like to see The Blue Bird on the big screen. I am not a huge fan of the plot but Maurice Tourneur’s visuals are amazing on DVD, I can only imagine how wondrous they would be in a theater with live music!\n\nWhat about you? Which silent film are you particularly excited to see on the big screen? I want to know! (I am limiting the choices to surviving films because most-wanted lost films is an entire thread of its own!)"
