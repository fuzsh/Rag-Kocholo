        "text": "ALWAYS say this — when a character in a film says the title of the film, declare “He said the title!” Even if it’s the title of another film.\n\nAbel Gance’s 1919 J’ACCUSE is an unusual case, a silent movie where the title is constantly appearing, either as chapter headings or as lines of printed dialogue. Some of these instances are very beautiful.\n\nThe blood-dripping main title. “I stand here, not as the accused, but as the accuser, of capitalism, dripping with blood!” John McLean.\n\nThe live-action, flesh and blood title, composed of French soldiers.\n\nThe supertitle.\n\nA human intertitle, this time with a heavy s&m flavour. The movie does seem to draw upon propaganda posters for its imagery of imperiled maidenhood, despite its pacifist intentions.\n\nEpisode titles in gothic script…\n\nThe return of the human bondage font, this time with added Ophelia-esque illustration.\n\nThe do-it-yourself intertitle.\n\nIt sounds better in French.\n\nThe film, of course, is tremendously impressive in its immediacy (the war had barely finished; Gance uses actual battle documentary in his story) and power. But I did find it a bit incoherent. The central trio of characters (a poet and a brute in love with the same woman) didn’t seem to illuminate the “anti-war message,” if that’s what it was. Most anti-war films aren’t really that at all — to properly assess them, it’s necessary to figure out what they’re really up to. Here, I wasn’t sure — the recurring cries of “J’Accuse!” begged a number of questions — who is being accused, and of what?\n\nAt the film’s end, this does finally coalesce into an accusation against the French citizenry — against the audience — that they enjoyed themselves while the soldiers were suffering. Not the biggest lesson I’d have drawn from the war, but Gance was a soldier for real and one can imagine it being close to his heart.\n\nI kept waiting for the parade of dead soldiers, remembering a clip from Kevin Brownlow’s UNIVERSAL HORROR doc (leave it to Kev to shoehorn in a bit of Gance!) in which real war veterans with disfigured faces advance upon the camera. But that clip comes from Gance’s sound remake, made on the brink of WWII. The similar scene in this film lacks the scarred faces, but has some remarkable imagery and effects shots nonetheless."
