        "text": "LOS ANGELES &#151; Esther Rolle, who played the feisty maid in the hit 1970s sitcom \"Maude\" and the strong-willed mother who kept her ghetto family together in the spin-off series \"Good Times,\" has died at 78. Rolle died Tuesday at a hospital in Culver City, her spokesman Larry Calhoun said. The cause of death was not determined, but she had diabetes and was undergoing dialysis, he said.Norman Lear, creator of \"Good Times,\" said he cast Rolle because of her strong presence.\"Wherever she was, you knew she was there,\" he said. \"The woman had strong conviction. We may not have agreed on everything, but that is what happens when you have two creative minds at work.\"Long a crusader against black stereotypes in Hollywood, Rolle was nevertheless best remembered in the role of a maid, and her stout build and stern demeanor reminded some of the \"Mammy\" roles of an earlier generation of movies.Her character Florida Evans was Bea Arthur\\'s maid in \"Maude\" and a maid in \"Good Times,\" about a family struggling to make ends meet in inner-city Chicago.She left \"Good Times\" after three seasons because she felt her TV son &#151; played by Jimmie \"J.J.\" Walker as a clownish character with the catch phrase \"Dy-no-mite!\" &#151; was a poor example for black youth. But she was persuaded to return for a year. The show ran from 1974 to 1979."
