        "text": "Do you have a favorite Black TV dad?\n\nJames Evans (played by John Amos) on Good Times\n\nGeorge Jefferson (played by Sherman Hemsley) on The Jeffersons\n\nCliff Huxtable (played by Bill Cosby) on The Cosby Show\n\nPhillip Banks (played by James Avery) on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\n\nThe list goes on, but one woman opened the door for a complete black family to be shown on television.\n\nEsther Rolle made it happen.\n\nNovember is a month of remembrance and reflection on Rolle as her date of birth was November 8, 1920, and she died on November 17, 1998. With the 20 year anniversary of her death, Dominique Magazine salutes Esther Rolle.\n\nShe is best known for her work in the 1970âs TV series, Good Times. Good Times aired from 1974 to 1979. It launched in February 1974 as a midseason replacement. The series broke ground by showing a low-income family on television and a complete black family.\n\nThe Belluah Show and Amos N Andy were the first black sitcoms to air on American network television on CBS. Both were highly rejected by the NAACP due to their portrayal of black characters. Belluah represented the âmammyâ stereotype whereas âAmos N Andyâ represented the âhustlerâ stereotypes. Both shows were gone by 1953 due to outrage. In the late 1960s, NBC attempted to fill the void with Julia and The Bill Cosby Show. Julia premiered in September 1968, and Bill Cosby debuted in September 1969. Both characters were single as Julia was a widowed woman whose husband died in the Korean War and left behind a son. Cosby was a bachelor who was a public school teacher.\n\nBoth shows were labeled as historians to focus more on gender and class issues more than race.\n\nMelissa, a history scholar that operates the American History 4 Travelers website, noted that Julia received more unjustified praise than it should have. While the show didnât have stereotypes, she states it avoided race all together which at that time of history for people was not a realistic description of life.\n\nâJulia was criticized for presenting a black woman who was more white than black. At one point during the showâs first season, Diahann Carroll began to agree with the critics of the show,â she wrote. âCarroll referred to her character as a âwhite negroâ which still is attached to the show today.â\n\nShow creator Hal Kanter once stated he wanted to create a series centering around black life via âtelling the truth as it isâ but the show failed to do that.\n\nâPerhaps the popularity related to its avoidance of racial issues, the whiteness of its star, and the impression it gave the nation on making progress on race relations,â she wrote.\n\nRolle along with television producer and creator Eric Monte wanted to have a complete black family on television. Rolleâs Florida Evans character was introduced on the TV series Maude in which was groundbreaking in how the maid interacted with the family.\n\nâThat was something that was taught to you by someone else who didn't want you to see its true value,' Rolle said in a 1985 UPI Interview. âUntil my show came on the air, there was never shown a black family with a father.â\n\nMonte created the series after seeing the success of All In The Family and wanted a television family to show the aspects of a realistic black family. He chose a housing project in Chicago. The original title was The Black Family but later changed to Good Times.\n\nWhile Norman Lear liked the concept, he along with a few producers felt a robust black father could not work citing lack of comedic appeal.\n\nâI was told I had to get rid of the father as strong fathers are not funny,â he said in a 2000 E! Television interview. âI refused to do it.â\n\nThe script was modified and presented to Rolle who stated the pilot had a black woman and her three children.\n\nâThe story was supposed to be about a black woman and her three children,â she said in the 1985 interview. âI refused to do it.â\n\nShe took a fierce and bold stance demanding that she play a married woman not a single mother.\n\nâI introduced the black father to this country, and I risked my job saying I wonât do it unless you give me a husband for my children,â she said in a 1991 interview with E! Television.\n\nOther black fathers such as Sanford and Son featured Redd Foxx with Demond Wilson in January 1972 as two grown men running a business together. Fred Sanford is a widower who lost his wife 20 years earlier and featured dialogue with him missing her.\n\nMabel King attempted to follow Rolleâs footsteps when given the role of Mabel Thomas on the ABC series, Whatâs Happening but producers made her a divorced woman with a questionable father. The father remarried in Season 2 and written off for the rest of the series. King also didnât like the way how her character showed no progression or had any real significance in the show. She left after the end of the second season.\n\nRolle would deal with problems on her the Good Times set with storylines along with John Amos. The majority of the writing staff of the series was white, and it angered both of them. Amos was fired at the end of Season 3. Rolle left at the end of Season 4 but came back for Season 6.\n\nJaânet DuBois admitted Amosâ departure from the show permanently stunted the growth.\n\nâNo one could fill the void that was left after his departure. The role was vital to the success of the show,â she said in a 2000 E! Television interview. âThey attempted with giving Bookman more storylines including a wife along with bringing in Moses Gunn as a mentor for Michael and love interest for Florida but it didnât work.â\n\nThe black television father outside of Good Times in the era was either shown as dead, a deadbeat or missing. The Jeffersons are the exception to the rule.\n\nIn the ABC series, Thatâs My Mama, aired from September 1974 to December 1975; the original movie pilot showed the father Oscar as a living man with his son and wife. In the television series, Oscar was dead and left his son the barber shop. The father was referenced to many times on the show but was not in the home. The series was not a rating hit but did exceptionally well in syndication for the decade following the cancellation. A proposed reboot in 1986 was considered but later scrapped.\n\nIn January 1975, CBS launched The Jeffersons, a spinoff of All In The Family with George, Louise, and Lionel Jefferson as a black family. Lionel, the son was grown and in college living his own life on the series. The family was an aged adult family thus having adult dialogue. The show lasted 11 seasons, and the series was canceled in 1985.\n\nIn January 1978, Lila Garrett created Baby Iâm Back for CBS. The series aired until April 1978 and addressed the issue of family abandonment by black men.\n\nâAt that time, black families were thought of being matriarchial. There was this theory that a lot of black women had been deserted by men who couldnât get jobs,â Garrett said in her interview with Funny You Should Ask: Oral Histories of Classic Sitcom Tellers. âI wanted to do a show that said when they got jobs, and they were part of society they did not abandon their families. They wanted a family like everyone else.â\n\nThe show, according to Garrett was supposed to come back for a second season but dropped to allow Good Times to have a sixth season.\n\nIn 1984, the Cosby Show created the new school black family with children who were in each generation. While some decried the realism in the show, the show was highly regarded and rated. Cosby is also credited with reviving the sitcom genre was considered to be declining and dying in this point of TV history.\n\nSeveral attempts were made to create father led families post-Good Times and the Cosby Show.\n\nIn 1985, CBS launched Charlie and Company starring Flip Wilson and Gladys Knight as a middle-class black family living in South Chicago. It also was the first starring vehicle for Jaleel White, who later found success on Family Matters as Steve Urkel. The show didnât catch on and was canceled in May 1986. Charlie and Company were supposed to be CBSâ answer to the Cosby Show.\n\nThat same year, NBC debuted 227, based on a stage play starring Marla Gibbs and Hal Williams. Regina King was their daughter, and this was her first breakout role. Gibbs played a housewife married to a black man who owned a construction company. The family was considered middle class living in Washington D.C., and the series lasted five seasons ending in May 1990.\n\nIn 1989, ABC launched Family Matters as their answer to 227. The show featured Reginald VelJohnson as a Chicago Police Officer. Similar to how Good Times started, Family Matters took a character from Perfect Strangers and gave her a complete family. JoMarie Payton was the first Winslow we met before the launch of Family Matters. While Family Matters centered around a working class family in Chicago, it became more silly focused around Steve Urkel in the latter years. The series also featured VelJohnson and Payton as the parents of several children and showed the extended family. Rachel Crawford (Telma Hopkins), Harriett's widowed sister with her baby also lived with them along with Carlâs mother, Estelle Winslow (Rosetta LeNoire). Family Matters lasted nine seasons before the 1998 cancellation.\n\nFox provided a new twist for the black family with the series True Colors. The leading characters Ronald Freeman (Frankie Faison in Season 1 and Cleavon Little in Season 2) and Ellen Davis Freeman (Stephanie Faracy) were an interracial couple. The Jeffersons featured the dynamic between a black wife and a white husband whereas True Colors featured a black husband and white wife. Ronald is a widowed dentist who had two sons and Ellen is one of his patients who is a school teacher and had a daughter. The show centered more on the adventures of the children with the parents in the backdrop and mildly played on the racial dynamics of their blended family with a live-in white grandmother. The series only lasted two seasons and canceled in 1992.\n\nThe same year, NBC introduced the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air featuring a family taking in a wayward youth from another relative to provide more structure and stability. A storyline that Amen would use in their last season with the church board mentoring a street kid. Will Smith played a loose version of himself moving in with Uncle Phil (James Avery) and Aunt Viv (Janet Hubert Whitten (S1-S3)/Daphne Maxwell Reid (S4-S6). The Banks had three children of their own and were considered upper class. In a nod to the Jeffersonsâ, the series highlighted more family interactions of a family in this demographic. The series lasted six seasons and ending in 1996.\n\nIn 1993, Fox attempted to turn a bachelor into a foster dad with The Sinbad Show. At the end of the first and only season, Sinbad became the adoptive father of the two children he had to keep for the year. The two children were orphans from two deceased parents, and state officials had to find living descendants. The show provided Ray J, then known as Willie Norwood, his first starring role.\n\nIn 1994 and 1995, there were two attempted dramas, South Central on Fox and Under One Roof on CBS that tried to focus more on more substantial issues without the need for comic relief but both shows were midseason replacements that were quickly canceled.\n\n1995 also saw the startup of two new television networks, the WB and UPN. Both networks struggled to gain a foothold within the marketplace dominated by ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC. The struggle resulted in the networks merging to form the CW in 2006. The platforms did provide a couple of new opportunities for black families.\n\nEach started with wanting a modern day, Cosby Show. WB premiered The Parent Hood featuring Robert Townsend and Suzanne Douglas as a middle-class couple in New York City that tackled current day issues with comedy. The show also featured the extended family concepts with cousins living with them and community involvement. The children had their fair share of storylines, and Townsend employed modern day issues in the series including high school dropout, working with a low-income parent who didnât see the value of their child having education, taking in a street child, and much more. While not a rating success, it did manage to get five seasons on the WB network from 1995 to 1999. WB also attempted with Cleghorne featuring Saturday Night Live alumnae Ellen Cleghorn who was a single mother but lived with her parents who helped her with her daughter. Cleghorne aired from September 1995 to December 1995. In 2003, WB attempted another black family sitcom with Anthony Anderson in All About The Andersons. Anthony played a TV version of himself where he and his son moved back in with his parents as he worked on his acting career. The laughs often centered around Anderson and his TV father played by John Amos battling over his life choices and career path. Amos provided a loving environment for his grandson and of course, his wife. All About The Andersons despite average WB ratings didnât last to see the second season.\n\nUPN sought to create the magic of the Cosby Show with Moesha in 1996 featuring singer Brandy playing Moesha Mitchell living with her father and stepmother and brother. Viewers saw a middle-class Los Angeles based family with extended relatives, but the vast problem came in February 2000 in the infamous âSecrets and Liesâ episode where it turned out Cousin Dorian was Frank Mitchell (Moeshaâs dad) son he had in an extramarital affair. Viewers were unforgiving and the last season suffered in ratings which led to the cancelation of the series in 2001. After the ending of Moesha, UPN showed the single father parenting his daughter who wanted to live with him through her high school years on One on One. One on One featuring Flex Alexander and Kyla Pratt entertained audiences for five years.\n\nRolle lived to see these things, and her legacy continues. She fought to change the image of the black maid during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nââHollywood maidsâ are so idiotic. They grin at everything. I told Norman Lear I didnât want to play a maid because of that hee-hee/grin-grin attitude, and he said Who said I wanted that? He told me he wanted two strong that are the black and white of the same coin. I said, Oh well, in that case, Iâll be right there,â she said previously in media reports. âI donât play Hollywood maids, the hee hee kind of people who are so in love with their madamâs children they have no time for their own.â\n\nBut the black father was her hardest legacy she fought for. She grew up with one and an intact family; she wanted that to be shown on television.\n\nâI had a wonderful father, and I couldnât bear that television virtually ignored black fathers. I could not compound the lie that black fathers donât care about their children,â she said previously in media reports. âI ruffle a lot of feathers. And Iâm also selective--that makes you a troublemaker, but so be it. I laid a cornerstone for black actors, and that makes me happy.â\n\nReader Comments\n\nJibriel Holloway • imjholloway@gmail.com\n\nNOV 26, 2018 • This was a fun read. I knew about Esther's impact on 70s sitcoms, but I never thought about her effect on shows like Fresh Prince and Moesha."
