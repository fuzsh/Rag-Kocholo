        "text": "In Loving Memory of Robert Gaylon Rosser (1940 - 2024)\n\nWith heavy hearts, we grieve the passing of Robert Gaylon Rosser, affectionately known as Gaylon, on January 6, 2024, following a brief illness. Born to Sam and Viola Rosser as the third of five children, Gaylon's life was a testament to love, perseverance, and service.\n\nGaylon leaves behind his beloved wife of 65 years, Wanda Stacy Rosser, an unwavering partnership that began in the summer of 1958 when Gaylon and his friend gathered the courage to stop their car and ask two beautiful sisters out for a date. Gaylon and Wanda’s immediate connection was undeniable, and the young couple married later that year, embarking on a lifetime of shared dreams. Together they raised five children who survive Gaylon, along with their spouses: Kelly and Jay Hinton, Ron Rosser, Angela and Steve Rushing, Lori and Richard James, and Shannon Rosser. His legacy continues through his brother, Charles Rosser; sisters, Pat Abernathy and Avis Wilson; 10 adored grandchildren; 19 great-grandchildren; and a host of nieces, nephews, and friends.\n\nAt the tender age of thirteen, Gaylon began his construction career as a wide-eyed helper armed with little more than an unyielding determination and robust work ethic. This bedrock of grit and dedication to excellence was the foundation upon which he eventually built his own construction company with the motto, “If you can describe it, we can build it!” It was Gaylon’s home, however, filled with laughter, wisdom, and unwavering support, that was his true masterpiece, and one that continues to stand as a testament to the man he was.\n\nA pillar of strength and wisdom for his family, Gaylon instilled in his children and grandchildren the values of hard work and compassion, virtues that still resonate in the lives he touched. His absence leaves a void filled with memories of his wisdom, kindness, and the quiet strength he exuded, creating a legacy that will endure through generations."
