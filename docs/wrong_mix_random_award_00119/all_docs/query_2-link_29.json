        "text": "Greg has been producing and directing award-winning films for more than 50 years. He started making films when he was just 13 and later partnered with Jim Freeman to form MacGillivray Freeman Films in 1966. He loves the continual chess game of making a film, where each move affects every element. Today, he has more than 60 films to his credit, including over 40 IMAX productions.\n\nSince the 1976 production of his first IMAX film, To Fly!, Greg has produced some of the most enduring films in the giant-screen genre. He has shot more 70mm film than anyone in cinema history and is the first documentary filmmaker to reach the $1 billion benchmark in worldwide ticket sales. Greg has received two Academy Award nominations for Best Documentary Short Subject: first in 1995 for The Living Sea, and then in 2000 for Dolphins. In 2002, the Giant Screen Theater Association honored Greg as one of the five most important contributors to the success of the industry. That same year, Greg accepted the Bradford Washburn Award, the highest honor bestowed by the Museum of Science in Boston, for his contribution to science education.\n\nOne of the best parts of his job is that it has allowed him to spend his life sharing filming adventures with his family and film team. He’s been everywhere, but among the coolest places he’s travelled are Tibet in 1980, which he describes as “rough and raw,” like the old west; Irian Jaya (New Guinea) in 1984 where he experienced the stone-age cultures; and Costa Rica, for the amazing surfing (except when Shaun was bitten by a shark!).\n\nA passionate ocean conservationist, Greg and his wife Barbara founded the MacGillivray Freeman Films Educational Foundation, a non-profit public charity dedicated to educating and inspiring the public through giant-screen films and science education programming about the need to take action to protect the world’s ocean. Greg also serves on the Board of Directors for The Great Park in Orange County and Sylvia Earle’s Mission Blue, as well as the Laguna Playhouse and Laguna Art Museum.\n\nIf you’d like to book Greg for a speaking engagement, please contact Lori Rick at lrick@macfreefilms.com or 949-494-1055.\n\nShaun’s been on filming expeditions around the world since he was in diapers, but it wasn’t until a trip to Palau at the age of 13 that he realized that his dad’s passion for storytelling was in his blood. He was snorkeling on the “set” when he encountered a giant grouper (think the size of a refrigerator), then months later got to watch the fervent reaction of kids in the theatre who were watching The Living Sea—seeing on the giant screen what he was able to experience underwater first hand. It dawned on him: “A. My dad has a pretty cool job. And B. Maybe if I am lucky, I could do this when I grow up.”\n\nSince then, Shaun has produced more than 10 award-winning 3D giant-screen films including Grand Canyon Adventure, Journey To The South Pacific, To The Arctic, blockbusters National Parks Adventure and Dream Big: Engineering Our World, and directed the latest giant screen films Cities of the Future and SuperHuman Body. Shaun leads the company’s Business Development and Partnership team and has successfully raised more than $40 million in funding for IMAX educational films. Shaun received a MFA degree in Film Production from the University of Southern California. He and his wife Katie live in Laguna Beach with their three children. He can’t wait to take them all on expeditions and show them the wonders of nature firsthand.\n\nIf you’d like to book Shaun for a speaking engagement, please contact smacgillivray@macfreefilms.com or call 949-494-1055.\n\nAround the office, Kathy is known as the person who can be counted on to get the job done, no matter what it takes. That’s probably because she’s not afraid to ask…and can talk her way into anything. Kathy’s been a positive force on the team since 1987 and has over 28 years of experience in large-format project development, film production, and film marketing. She oversees the music and narrator talent recruitment for the films, recently securing the participation of Morgan Freeman, Meryl Streep, Robert Redford, Helen Mirren, Paul McCartney and Dave Matthews Band. She still gets a charge when an A+ artist connects to a project because she knows that matching the right voice and music to the stunning imagery is a showstopper. But the most rewarding part of her job is watching young underserved school kids—who have never experienced an IMAX film, let alone a regular theatre film—see a MacGillivray film for the first time. Kathy was the project manager behind the award-winning films The Living Sea, (Academy Award-nominated) and Everest (highest grossing large format documentary) and managed the multi-city, multi-speaker education series for Dolphins (Academy Award-nominated). When she’s not working, you can find Kathy hiking, reading, skiing or cooking, as well as juggling the schedules of two busy teenagers. She does make time for sleep, coffee and a few moments of meditation—and she needs it!\n\nMichael came to MFF in 2019 as a Senior Editor with 35+ years in the business. He started his career as an assistant editor at the BBC in London, and since worked with all the major post houses, networks and studios in London and the U.S. including Oprah Winfrey, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Nova, MTV Video Music Awards, ESPN, HBO, Warner Bros, Sony Pictures, and the list goes on. As a technologist on the ground floor of the “HD” revolution, he was the online editor of the first prime time show broadcast in HD, Chicago Hope, in 1998. Most notably, he received a George Foster Peabody award as one of the editors of Break the Silence, a groundbreaking documentary hosted by Jane Seymour in 1994.\n\nWhile at MFF, his role has morphed into what he loves doing best: building bridges between technology, software, engineering, and creative minds who require efficient ways to make their vision a reality. As a self-proclaimed tech nerd, audiophile, car nut and HUGE dog lover, Michael spends his time away from editing by hiking with his wife, grandkids, and their dogs all over the country.\n\nA veteran of the giant screen industry, Mary Jane began working with Greg back in 1980 when she launched To Fly! in her first IMAX theatre. For 20 years, she worked on the theatre side of the industry, overseeing the successful launch and operation of numerous IMAX theatres including Boston’s Museum of Science and the Denver Museum of Natural History, and consulting for over 28 different institutions around the world including the Smithsonian Institution and the Museum of Science in Barcelona. She also helped develop the commercial giant screen theatre industry by launching and operating the first commercial IMAX theatre in New York City, where she premiered Everest. In 2006, she joined MacGillivray to develop strategic business partnerships, sponsorship opportunities and play a role in the marketing and distribution of films. It was meant to be. Now her job is to tell the world why they have to go see an MacGillivray film on the largest and best IMAX screens in the world. At MacGillivray, she’s discovered the incredible teamwork it takes to make a film and loves being in the office the first day the crew gets back from a big shoot to hear all their stories firsthand. A native of Fargo, North Dakota, she loves snorkeling in Laguna Beach, visiting India (where her husband is from), and can be bribed with maple cookies.\n\nNancy started working on various projects with MFF in 1998 and has been a full time part of the team since 2012. As the Operations Manager and Production Coordinator, she has the unique opportunity to work in the production of our splendidly, beautiful films and also work with Greg and staff keeping the company running smoothly. Her previous 11 years of experience producing entertainment television programs like “Entertainment Tonight” and producing / co-creating “Access Hollywood” have made her a key asset of the team that keeps production shoots and the day to day in the office moving without a hitch. She has worked on over 13 MFF films and is honored to be a part of a company that is creating such quality product. When she is not at work Nancy can be found adapting to the empty nest life as her two kids attend college. Ask her to make you a cocktail—she’s an expert. Well she thinks so.\n\nEver wondered how MFF finds those exotic and jaw-dropping locations from our films? That’s where Ana comes in. When she was six years old, she saw Adventures in Wild California and kept wondering “how did they film that?” Now, after studying History and with a passion for stories and story telling, she joins our team to assist the production team in research (and anything else thrown at her.) While at the University of Portland, Ana worked in the curatorial departments at two museums and has a deep understanding of how our films fit into their missions to promote lifelong learning. A curious lifelong student herself, Ana loves traveling and exploring new places. Her goals is to visit all 50 states, and has made it to 40 so far!\n\nSteve landed at MacGillivray in 1982 because “no one else would hire me.” (We’re glad we did.) After editing more than two dozen films for the company over the past 30 years, Steve now prefers to pass along his giant screen editing experience to “younger editors with more brain cells.” He has directed six of the company’s films, co-directed others and has lent his screenwriting talents to ten films, including the Academy Award-nominated Dolphins. His skills as a producer, director and writer helped shape the company’s smash hit Everest (which he also edited), for which he was voted into the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. On every film, the central focus of his work is always visual storytelling—making the films creative, engaging, eye-opening, informative, funny, musically compelling and visually breathtaking. Steve commutes “five long blocks” to the office, from the arts and crafts bungalow his neighbors call “the house that eBay built.” He makes time for daydreaming (and coffee) every day.\n\nBarbara and Greg met in the 9th grade—she sold tickets for his first surfing film—and making films has always been a part of their relationship. Over the years she has worked multiple capacities with production and post-production of the films, bringing their two children, Meghan and Shaun, along with them whenever possible on film shoots. With a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology, Barbara has also worked for 30 years in Children, Youth Services for the Orange County Health Care Agency as a Licensed Clinical Psychologist. She counts doing the science research for Journey to the South Pacific as the coolest thing she’s done at MacGillivray, which included filming the last stand of the Pacific Leatherback Turtles in Wermon, West Papua and swimming with the whale sharks in Cenderawasih Bay. But the best part of her job is being with her family, doing what she loves: making films with messages about conservation and education.\n\nMeghan started working for MacGillivray Freeman Films in research in 2007, and then moved into social media management, research and film production after graduating with a Master’s Degree in English from Chapman University in 2010. She changed roles to Unit Production Manager in 2013 with the film Humpback Whales, managing all logistics, and scheduling for the shoot in Maui. She has since been Production Manager on all subsequent giant screen films including National Parks Adventure, Dream Big, America’s Musical Journey, Ireland, Into Wild America, Cities of the Future and Superhuman Body. She has also worked on numerous television shows and short films including those for GoUSA TV and Travel Channel. She is responsible for pre-production scheduling, budget and assessing time and cost. She also works to survey all locations and secure permissions. She coordinates crew and arrangements for locations and approves financials. She goes on location to support and manage the production shooting schedule. She has experience working in a vast variety of countries, working in remote locations and coordinating all personnel and logistics. When not on location she enjoys spending time with her family, cooking, watching her sons’ soccer games and playing pickleball.\n\nOriginally from NY, Victoria (aka “Vik”) began her career in entertainment at 3 years old, when she sang at her first “gig” with her father, Eddy McGinnis, and his big band at the posh Riverboat Room in NYC’s Empire State Building. A musician all her life, she had a major “aha moment” in her early 20’s when she saw a TV show being edited – She realized editing was just like writing a song. – put two notes together and you’ve got a melody – put two clips together, you’ve created a story! That was the start of her fabulous and passionate career in tv and film production. She has now found her home in the sweet town of Laguna Beach (goodbye to the Big Apple) with MacGillivray Freeman Films (hello to the Giant Screen). One of her greatest moments at MacGillivray was performing with a Dixieland band for the SoCal screening of MacGillivray Freeman’s, America’s Musical Journey, the film she had just finished editing.\n\nWhile working at Six Flags for actual income, JP started his career doing everything he could connected to the film industry from set PA to grip to electrician to associate producer to editor to sound designer to post production supervisor. He landed a role at Marvel as post PA for Captain America in 2010, which cemented his love for filmmaking. He joined MacGillivray full-time in 2011 and has done some pretty cool things, including design the audio and visual assets for the interactive, traveling museum exhibit “Sea Monsters Revealed.” Seeing kids interacting with the submarine and ship deck environments he created was an incredible payoff—his favorite part of this job is watching people react to his work. JP comes from a highly musical family, writes music and plays piano and trumpet, and also loves to cook and bake. He’s still holding onto his dream of being a hockey player…a little bit…but is pretty content to be here at work. And he’s always here."
