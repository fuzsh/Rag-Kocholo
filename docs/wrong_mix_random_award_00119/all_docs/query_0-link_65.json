Howes, too, after Pas- ton's death, declared the later will a fabri- cation. But his testimony is not free from suspicion, and was contradicted by others. The facta before us hardly justify Sir James Kamsay (ii. 345) in assumintr without ques- tion that Paston was guilty of ' forgery and breach of trust.' The reopening of the civil war in the autumn of 1459 may very well have convinced Fastolf that unless ho gave 8ome one a strong personal interest in the foundation of his college his intentions were very likely to be defeated (Paston Letters^ i. 491). For the rest of his life Paston's whole energies were devoted to retaining his hold upon the Fastolf estates against the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk and the recalcitrant executors. Once his enemies laid a plot to carry him off into the north, and three times he was imprisoned in the Fleet, on the second occasion (1464) just after he had obtained Edward IV's license for the foundation of Fastolf's college. The suit against the will began in the spiritual court of Canterbury in 1464, and was still going on at his death. He was compelled to bring evidence to prove that he was not of 8er\\'ile blood. But the Fastolf succession had made Paston a man of greater importance than before ; he sat in the last parliament of Henry VI and the first of Edward IV as knight of the shire for Norfolk, and had some influence with Ed- ward, in whose household he seems for a time to have resided. He managed to re- tain possession of Caistor and most of the disputed estates down to his death, which tooK place at London on 21 or 22 May 1460 (ib, ii. 290). He was buried in Bromholm IViory. Paston was somewhat hard, self-seeking, and unsympathetic. He grudged his younger brothers the provision which their father made for them, and his dealings with his own eldest son leave something to be desired. His letters reveal the cool, calculating, busi- ness temperament, which we have chiefly to thank for the preservation of the unique family correspondence, in which he is the central, though not the most interesting, figure (for the history of the * Paston Corre- spondence * see under Fenn, Sir Johx, where the reprint of Fenn's collection, edited by liamsay in 1841 for Charles Knight, is not mentioned). By his wife, Margaret Mauteby (d. 1484), daughter and heiress of John Mauteby of Mauteby, near Caistor, Paston had five sons and two daughters. The sons were: John the elder (1442-1479), who is separately noticed; John the younger ((f.l503),whowas'the father of Sir William Paston (1479.«»-1554) [q. v.] ; Edmund, living in 1484; Walter, who took the degree of B. A. at Oxford in June 1479,and died a few weeks later; and William, who was at Et^n in 1479, and was afterwards attached to the household of John de Vere, earl of Oxford [q. v.], until, some time after 1495, he became * erased in his mind.' Pas- ton's daughters w^ere Margery, who married in 1469 liichard Calle ; and Anne, who mar- ried in 1477 William Yelverton, grandson of William Yelverton [q. v.], the judge. [Pjiston Letters, ed. Gairdner; Norfolk Archaeo- logy, vol. ir. (1855) ; Kamsay's Lancaster and York.] J. T-T. PASTON, Sir JOHN (1442-1479), courtier and letter-writer, born in 1442, eldest son of John Paston (1421-1460) [q. v.], and his wife, Margaret Mauteby, may have been educated at Cambridge, like his father, who did not, however, intend him for his own pro- fession of the law {Paston IjctterSy i. 483). On the accession of Edward IV he was sent to court to push the family fortunes and make interest in support of their retention of the disputed Fastolf estates. His want of suc- cess in this direction and the demands he made upon the not too well filled family ex- chequer gave great dissatisfaction to his father, who before long despised him as * a drane among bees ' without * politic demean- ing or occupation ' {ib. iii. 481-2). Their relations were not perceptibly' improved by the knighthood bestowed upon the younger Paston on his coming of age in 1463 (ib. ii. 135). At any rate. Sir John was withdrawn from court, and kept hanging about at home in Norfolk. But he soon g^»w weary of this life, and stole away from Caistor ap- parently to join the king on his northern expedition in May 1464 (ib. i. 438, ii. 141, 160, 257). His father was highly incensed, and for a time forbade him his house. But his mother interceded for him, and in the spring of 1465 he was back in Norfolk, and entrusted with the defence of Caistor Castle ; in July he got * great worship* by his resist- ance to the attempt of the men of John de la Pole, duke of Suffolk [q. v.], to enter upon the manor of Hellesdon (ib. ii. 177, 187, 205). His favour at court seems to have stood him in good stead after his father's death in May 1466, for within two months he obtained a royal recognition of the right of the family to tlie estates of Sir John Fastolf [q. v.] Once his own master, Paston basked in the sunshine of the court, and seldom ap- peared in Norfolk. Henceforth he lived chiefly in London at his * place in Fleet Street,' and afterwards * at the George by Pauls Wharf.* Among his friends the most congenial was Anthony Wydville, lord Scales, afterwards b2 Paston 4 Paston Emi\\ Uir<rrp. the kiiur'a brother-in-law, to a 1476 of John Mowbray, fourth duke of Xor- eo'JLfrin of wh nn Paston was for many years folk, leaving no male issue.

This occurs in the interesting inventory of books (among them Caxton's 'Game of Chess*), belonging either to him or his namesake and successor, included in the Paston * Correspondence *(iii. 300). We are disposed to regard it as a list drawn up by the elder brother, a few days before his death. Mr. Oairdner refers it to the younger brother. [The Paston Letters (ed. Guirdner) are the sole authority ; they inclu'Ie some documents not originally included in the Paston Collection. In a few cases the dates assigned by Mr. Q.'iirdner seem open to dispute; ^o. 325, placed under 1459, belongs more probably to 1464, and No. 639 to 1466, nther than 146(5.] J. T-t. PASTON, ROBERT, first Earl of Yar- mouth (1()31-1688), was born at Oxnead, the seat of the Paston family in Norfolk, on 29 May 1631. He was eldest son of Sir \"William Paston, an antiquary, who had been high sheriff of Norfolk in 1636, was created a baronet 8 June 1642, and died 22 Feb. 1662-3 [see under Pastok, Sir William, 1479 I-*- j5o4]. His mother, Katherine, daughter of Robert Bertie, first earl of Lindsey [q. v.], died in 1636. He was educated at West- min.<ter, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, and is said to have fought in t!ie civil wars. His family suffered during the Common- wealth (cf. Cal. Comm, for the Adcance of Money, i. 487), and he travelled abroad. \"When Charles II was restored, Paston was knighted on 29 May 1660. He sat in the House of Commons as member for Castle Rising from 1601 to 1673, and then gave Slace to Samuel Pepys. In 16(51 he was made eputy-lieutenant for Norfolk, and captain in the' Earl of Suffolk's regiment of militia horse. On 22 Feb. 1662-3 Paston succeeded his father as second baronet; he became a fellow of the Royal Society on 20 May of the same year, and on 25 Jan. 1666-7 he was appointed fentleman of the priw chamber. On 19 Aug. 673 he was created fiaron Paston of Paston in Norfolk, and Viscount Yarmouth of Great Yarmouth, and took his seat on 20 Oct. of the same year. He was also appointed high steward of Great Y'armouth 23 Dec. 1674 ; and he became lord-lieutenant of Norfolk 6 March, and vice-admiral of Norfolk 9 May 1670. In the same year he entertained Charles II at Oxnead, and on 9 Aug. he was wounded while in his coach by some ruffians who shot at him. Y'armouth was evidently a friend of the king. He had obtained a lease of the subsi- dies of wood, glass, earthen and stone ware, oranges, citrons, lemons, and pomegranates in 1666, and on 24 Jan. 1677-8 he secured the joint surveyorship of the green wax. In 1679 he became colonel of the 3rd Norfolk militia. On 30 Julv 1079 he was advanced to the earldom of Yarmouth. He took some part in debates in the lords, and signed numerous protests. Y'armouth died 8 March 1682-3, and was buried at Oxnead. His portrait was painted by Kneller after 1075. Y''armouth married Rebecca, daughter of Sir Jasper Clayton, by whom he lel't issue. His eldest son, AVilliam Paston, second Eakl of Y'armocth (16o2- 1732), succeeded to the title, became a fellow of the Royal Societv, and was treasurer of the household from 1080 to 1689. He was a supporter of James II, and married Charlotte Jemima Mary, natural daughter of Charles II ; and, after her death, Elizabeth, widow of Sir Robert Wiseman and daughter of Lord North [see under North, Dudley, fourth Baron ^Cortii] ; but his sons, who were by his first wife, died before him, and the title, on his death on 25 Dec. 1732, became extinct. His estate was found to be so encumbered with debt that it had to be sold, and Oxnead was bought by George, afterwards Lord An- son [q. v.], the admiral, who pulled down the old mansion.

Sketch of Caistor Castle.] W. A. J. A. PASTON, WILLIAM (1378-1444), judge, was born in 1378 at Paston on the coast of Norfolk, four miles from North AValsham, and close to the small Cluniac priory of Bromholm {Norfolk Arc/iepolofft/, vol. IV. ; Pttitton Letters, i. 30). He was son of Clement Paston, who died on 17 June 1419, and Beatrix de Somerton {ib. i. 52, iii. 448). Twenty years after AVilliam Paston^s death an attempt was made to defeat his son's claim to the Fastolf estates on the plea that his grandmother, and apparently his grand- father too, had been of servile blood. Cle- ment Paston was alleged to have been merely a good plain husbandman who cultivated his own little holding of a hundred acres or so, much of which he held on base tenure ot Paston Paston the duchy of Lancaster, and drove his own com to market (tft.vol. i.p. xxi, vol. ii. p. 227). The familvy it was said, held no manorial rights until William Paston purchased some. These assertions might seem to be supported by Clement Paston's modest will, and we cer- tainly find the judge's son endeavouring to obtain the grant of a court leet in Paston from the duchy (ib, iii. 421, 447). But the Pastons proved to the satisfaction of Ed- ward IV and his council that they were * gentlemen descended lineally of worshipfuU blood sithen the Conquest hither.' The pedi- gree and other evidences on which they relied w^ere preserved at Oxnead Hall until the family became extinct, and still exist in a copy made by Francis Sandford [q. v.] for Robert Paston, viscount (afterwards first earl of) Yarmouth [q. v.l, in 1674, and printed by Mr. Worship in tne fourth volume of the 'Norfolk Archapolopry.' The first steps in the family tree, beginning with AVol- stan, who came over from Normandy in 1069, are more than doubtful, and some curious errors occur elsewhere; but there seems no good reason to doubt that the Pas- tons belonged to the small gentry of Nor- folk, and had secured by marriage manors m parishes contiguous to Paston. But Judge Paston was clearly the real founder of the family fortunes. If the unfriendly statement already quoted may be trusted, his father had to borrow money to keep him at school, and he was partly supported, during his law studies in London, by a maternal uncle. lie made great progress in these studies, and one of the first acts of Kichard Courtenny [(\\. v.] when he became bishop of Norwich in 1413 was to make Paston steward of all his courts and leets (Blomefielt), 7/iV. of Norfolk , vi. 479). According to Blomefield, the citizens of Nor- wich called him in as arbitrator in a dispute about the election of mnvor in 1414, an honour repeated in 1442 (ift. iii. 126, 148). In 1421 the bench enrolled him in the select body of serjennts-at-law, and his ser- vices in that capacity were soon retained for the crown (Dtjgdale, Oriffines Juridicialcs, p. 46). On 15 Oct. 1429 Paston was raised to the bench as one of the justices of the common pleas, and continued toperfonn the duties of this office until a few months before his death {Ordmances of the Piivy Council^ iv. 4). A salary' of over seventy pounds was assigned to him, and, as a mark of special iavour, he received two robes more than the ordinary allowance of the judges (Paston LetterSf vol. i. p. xxiii). He was a member of the king's council for the duchy of Lancaster, and acted as a trier of petitions in the par- liaments of 1439 and 1442 (Hot Pari. v. 4, 36). His conduct on the bench in days when judicial impartiality was hard to pre- serve was such as to secure him the honour- able title of the * Good Judge,' and a place among Fuller's * Worthies of England.* But it did not entirely escape challenge. While a serjeant-at-law he had been in great re- quest among the Norfolk gentry as trustee and executor, and his services as counsel had been retained hj towns and religious bodies as well as by private persons. In the par- liament of November 1433 one William Dalling, an official of the duchy of Lancas- ter in Norfolk, accused the judge of being still * withholden ' at fees in every matter in Norfolk. The exact sums which he took yearly from certain parties named were speci- fied. If he still took fees from old clients, it would be sufficient to cast a doubt upon his impartiality in cases where their interests were concerned. The petition, however, was rejected, and his reputation does not: seem to have suffered. His duties as an advocate in lawless and litigious Norfolk had, before he became a judge, involved him in some awk- ward situations, of which we get a glimpse in the earlier letters of the Paston collection. In 1426 he prays * the Holy Trinite, dely vere me of my iij. adversaries, of this cursed bysshop forBromholm, Aslak for Sprouston, and Julian Ilerberd for Thomliam. I have nought trespassed ageyn noon of these iij., God knowing, and yet I am foule and noy- syngly vexed with hem, to my gret unease, and al for my lordes and frendes matieres, and nought for myii owyn' (Paston Letter s A. ''2^)* As counsel for the priory of Bromholm, in whose fortunes he had a personal and family as well as a professional interest, Paston had resisted the claim of Walter Aslak to the advowson of Sprouston, and prosecuted a certain John Wortes*that namvthe hvmself Paston, and affirmeth hvm untrewelv to be my cousin,' for apostasy from the priory. In August 1424 Aslak placarded Norwich with bills, threatening to murder PavSton, and by his interest in high places brought him into ill-odour with John Mowbray, second duke of Norfolk, whose steward Paston had been since 1415. Wortes went to Rome, where he was made bishop of Cork, and got his adver- sarv mulcted in a fine of 20.\")/., and ultimatelv excommunicated. We are not told how either matter ended. In January 1444 Paston was too ill to ride the home circuit, and made his will. He died on 13 Aug., late at night, which no doubt accounts for the date of his death being sometimes given as the 14th (tft. i.50, 64, ii. 289, iii. 448-60), Sandford quotes a state- ment of W^illiam Worcester that he died at Paston London, which may bo doubled. He waa buried in the chHpelof Our Lady in Norwich Cathedral, of which he hai) been a benefactor, and his son endowed a priest to pray for hia aoul in the said chapel for ninety years (BL0ifE7iELD, vi. 480). Blomefielij states that he built the north aisle of Therfield Church, Hertfordshire, and probably that of Great Cressingham Church, Norfolk, in both of which effigies of himself and his wife for- merly eiiated. Paaton married Agnes, daughterandheireaa of Sir Edmund Berry of Harlingbury orHor- welbury Hall in Herlfordahire, who bore liim {)Te sons and one datij^bter. Tlie sons were: John (1421-1466), who is separately noticed; Edmund (1425M449P). William (1436?- 1496 ?), Clement {b. 1442 ; d. before 1487), and Harry, who must have predeceased his father (I'aitoa Letters, i. 77). The daughter ■was Eliiabeth, who married (1), before 1469, Kobert PoTniiigs(d.l46l),by whom she was mother of Lord-deputy Sir Edward Povnings [q. T.], and (ji), before 1472, Sir Oeorfre Browne of Betchworth, Surrey. She made her will on 18 May 1487 iib. iii. 402). Paston's wife had hrousht him estates in Hertfordshire and Sufiblk, and he himself had made extensive purchases of lands in Fasten and other parts of Norfolk, including the manor of Ciresham, bought of Thomas Chaucer [a. v.] These e.^itates he divided by his will between bis widow and his sons, with elaborate precautions against disputes, which did not prove entirely successful. He also left a very considerable amount of ready money and plate, although over four hun- dred pounds of his salary was not paid until fourteen years after his death (Foes, iv. 353 ; Enrolled CuntoTni Aceoanti, 37 Heniy VI). His widow died in 1479. [Fobs, in his Lives of the Judges (ir. 350-2), giveit a.

The Ctther was A loldier, and had been brought Paston up in the familv of the Duke of Norfolk, with whom his family had muchdiBputej but, like bis elder brother, also called Sir John Paston, who is separately noticed, and from whom he must be carefully distinguished, he took the Lancastrian side iu the war of the Hoses, With bis brother he fought at Bamet in 1471, and bad to secure a pardon to meet the new turn of affairs. He served in the army of 1476, and, on his elder brother's death in 1 1479, he succeeded to the estates. He was high sheriff of Norfolk in 1485, and evidently ' was much trusted by the new king, who gave ' him a reward a( IGOl. in the same year. He I behaved well in tlie rubullion of Lambert Simnel, was knighted at the battle of Sloke I in 1487, was made a knight of the king's I bodv, and took part in the reception of Catherine of Arragon in 1501. He died in 1503. William Paston was educated at Cam- bridge, and a letter from him to his father, written about 1495, has been printed among the ' Pai^ton Letters.' It sliows that at the ■ time he had been forced to leave the univer- I sity on account of the ravages of the sweat- ing sickness. He was bred to the law, the ' borough of Yarmouthacknowledging hisse but he is chiefly known as a he was a commissioner of array for Norfolk. In I5I3 he secured a grant of part of the Pole estates. Un7 July lul7beattended on tbeking at a, banquet at Greenwich. The same year he was sheriff of Norfolk. It seems uncertain when he was knighted, but probably he was dubbed early in Ilenry VIH s reign. He waa certainly a knight in 1520. He was present at the reception of the emperor, Charles V, and the Field of the Cloth of Oold in 1520, and in ir,22 feems to have been employed as a treasurer for the army on the Scottish border. Ilewas often in the commission of iho feace for Norfolk, and secured various grants. a 1523bowasngain serving on the northern bonier, and his family connection with tho Lovell family secured him the executorship to SirThomas Losell [q. v.], who died in 1524. lie was a commissioner to collect the subsidy of 1524 ; the same vear, on 1 Sept., be was one of those who roie to Blackheath to meet the papal ambassador bearing the golden rose to Henry. He seems to have been high- handed us a lan(ilord,and had disputes with the men of Yarmouth about his estate of Caistor. In 1528 he was sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk. He went on the expedition of 1532, took some part, as an augmentation commissioner for Norfolk, in the suppression of the monaateries, was present at the recep- tion of Anne of Clevea in 1639, and died Pastorini 8 Pastorius in September 1554. lie was buried at Pas- ton on 26 Sept., and his will (P.P.C. More 15) was proved on 4 Dec. of the same year. He married Bridget, daughter of Sir Iienry Heydon of Baconsthorpe, ^'orfolk. By her he left two sons, of whom the second, Clement, is separately noticed. The eldest son, Erasmus Paston, died in his father's lifetime, in 1640, and was buried at Paston on 6 Nov. of that year. He had married Mary, daughter of Sir Thomas Wyndham of Felbrigg, Norfolk ; she lived until 1596, and by her he had a son. Sib William Paston (1628-1610), who was knighted on 22 Aug. 1578, and is famous as the founder of North AValsham grammar school. He succeeded to the property of his grandfather in 1540, and of his uncle Clement in 1597. In the latter year he removed to the new house which Sir Clement Paston had built at Oxnead ; and Caistor, which the Paston famiW had had such difficulty to keep in the fifteenth century, was suti'ered to fall into ruin. He died on 20 Oct. IGIO, and was buried in the church at North Walsham. A portrait is at North AValsham, and another, said to be by Zucchero, was at Empingham Rectory, llutland. He settled 40/. per annum on the school, with 10/. for a weekly lecturer ; he was also a benefactor to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He had married, on 5 May 1551, Frances, daughter of Sir Thomas Clore of Stokesby, Norfolk, and by her he left, with other issue, Christopher, his heir, who became insane in 1611, and who was great-grandfather of Robert Paston, first earl of Yarmouth [q. v.] [For Sir John Paston the introduction to the third volume of Gairduer s Paston Letters sup- plies full information ; see also Dawson Turner's Hist.

PASTORINI, BENEDICT (BENE- DETTO) {fl. 1775-1810), draughtsman and engraver, a native of Italy, came to England, where he obtained employment as a deco- rator of ceilings in the style then in vogue. He also studied stipple engraving under Fran- cesco Bartolozzi [q. v.], and executed some very successful plates in this manner, mostly subjects after Angelica Kauffmann, Zucchi, Rigaud, and others, but including a fuU- length portrait of Mrs. Billington after Sir Joshua Reynolds. Pastorini published in 1775 a very scarce set often engravings, en- titled * A Wew Book of Designs for Girandoles and Glass Frames in the Present Taste.* He exhibited two drawings for ceilings at the Royal Academy in 1775 and 1776. He also engraved some caricatures in aquatint. When the Society of Engravers was formed in 1803 to protect engravers and their widows and orphans, Pastorini was one of the first governors, the qualification being the contribution of a plate worth seventy- five guineas. It was this society which led to the foundation of the Artists' Bene- volent Fund in 1810, and as Pastorini's name does not appear among the governors then, it is probable that his death had taken place before the latter date. Two members of his family, F. E. and J. l*astorini, practised as miniature-painters, and exhibited minia- tures at the lloyal Academy from 1812 to 1834. The latter died in Xewman Street, London, on 3 Aug. 1839, aged 66.

PASTORIUS, FRANCIS DANIEL (1651-1719?), New England settler, bom in Sommerhausen, Frankenland, Germany, on 26 Sept. 1051, was son of Melchior Adam Pastorius, judge of Windsheim. In 1668 he entered the university of Altorf, afterwards studied law at Strasburg, Basle, and Jena, and at Ratisbon obtained a practical know- ledge of international polity. On 23 Nov. 1676 he receiv^ed the degree of doctor of law at Nuremberg. In 1679 he was a law lecturer at Frankfort, where he became deeply interested in the teachings of the pastor Spener, the founder of Pietism. In 1680 and 1681 he accompanied Johannes Bonaventura von RodecK, on Spener's recommendation, in his travels through France, England, Ireland, and Italy, returning to Frankfort in 1682. Having joined the sect of the pietists, he devised, with some of his co-religionists, a plan for emigrating to l*ennsylvania. They purchased twenty-five thousand acres, but abandoned the intention of colonising the land themselves. Pastorius, who acted as their agent, had made the acquaintance of AVilliam Penn in England, and became a convert to the quaker doctrines. He was commissioned by his associates, who in 1683 organised themselves as the Frankfort Land Company, and by some merchants of Crefeld, who nad acquired fifteen thousand acres, to Pastorius Patch conduct a colony of German and Dutch Mennonites and quakers to Pennsylvania. He arrived on 20 June 1683, settled upon the company's tract between the Schuylkill and the Delaware rivers, and on 24 Oct. began to lay out Germantown. Soon after his arrival he united himself with the Society of Quakers, and became one of its most able and devoted members, as well as the re- cognised head and law-giver of the settle- ment. In 1687 he was elected a member of the assembly. In 1688 he drew up a me- morial against slave-holding, which was adopted by the Germantown quakers and sent up to the monthly meeting, and thence to the yearly meeting at Philadelphia. It is noteworthy as the first protest made by a re- ligious body against negro slavery', and is the subject of John Greenleaf Whittier's poem, *The Pennsylvania Pilgrim.' The original document was discovered in 1844 by Nathan Kite, and was published in the * Friend ' (vol. xviii. No. 16). Pastorius was elected the tirst bailiff of the town in 1691, and served the office again in 1692, afterwards acting frequently as clerk. For many years he carried on a school in Germantown, which he temporarily removed to Philadelphia between 1698 and 1700, and wrote deeds and letters required by the more uneducated of his countrymen. He died in Germantown between 26 Dec. 1719 and 13 Jan. 1720, the dates respectively of the making and proving of his will. On 26 Nov. 168(5 he married Anneke, daughter of Dr. Johann Kloster- man of Miihlheim, by whom he had two sons, Jolm Samuel (b. 1690) and Henry (b. 1692). He was on intimate terms with William Penn, Thomas Lloyd, Chief-justice Logan, Thomas Story, and other leading men in the province belonging to his own religious society, as well as with Kelpius, the learned mystic of the Wissahickon,with the pastor of the Swedes church, and the leaders of the Mennonites. I lis * Lives of the Saints,' &c., written in German and dedicated to Professor Schurm- berg, his old teacher, was published in 1690. He also published a pamphlet, consisting in part of letters to his father, and containing a description of l*ennsylvania and its go- vernment, and advice to emigrants, entitled, * Umstandige geographische Beschreibung der zu allerletzt erfundenen I*rovintz Penn- sylvanisB,' 8vo, Frankfort and Leipzig, 1700, a further portion of which was included in the quaker Gabriel Thomas's * Continuatio der BeachreibungderLandschafUPennsylvanise,' 8vo, Frankfort and Leipzig, 1702. Some of his poetry, which is chiefly devoted to the pleasoies of gardening, the description of flowers, and the care of bees, appeared in 1710, under the title of ' Delicise nortenses: eine Sammlung deutscher epigrammatischer Gedichte.' Others of his works are : 1.' Dellasura Docu- ment or um,' Nuremberg, 1076, 4to, being his inaugural dissertation for his degree. 2. A primer, printed in Pennayhtinia previously to 1697. 3. * Treatise on four Subjects of Ecclesiastical History, viz., the Lives of the Saints, the Statutes of the Pontiff's, the De- cisions of the Councils of the Church, the Bishops and Patriarchs of Constantinople,' written in German and printed in Germany, and dedicated bv Pastorius to his old school- master at Windsheim, Tobias Schumberg, 1690. Pastorius left forty-three volumes of manuscripts. Few of these compilations have escaped destruction ; the most curious of all, however, the huge folio entitled Francis Daniel Pastorius, his Hive, Bee- stock, Melliotrophium Alucar or Kusca Apium,' was in 1872 in the possession of AVashington Pastorius of Germantown. It is a medley of knowledge and fancy, history, philosophy, and poetry, written in seven languages. His Latin prologue to the German- town book of records (1688) has been trans- lated by Whittier as an ode beginning * Hail to Posterity,' which is prefixed to the * Pennsylvania Pilgrim.* [Penn Monthly for 1871 and for January and February 1872; Whittier's Writings (London. 1888-9), 1. 316-45,434-5; Derdeutscho Vionier (Cincinnati) for 1871 ; Allgemeine deutsche Biographic, xxr. 219; Applelon's Cyclop, of Amer. hiojrr.] G. G. PATCH, RICHARD (1770 ?-l 806), cri- minal, born about 1770 at Heavitree, near Exeter, Devonshire, was the eldest son of a small farmer who for some daring acts of smuggling ^vas imprisoned in Exeter gaol, where he afterwards became turnkey. Ri- chard Patch was apprenticed to a butcher, and was liberally supplied with money by his father. On his father's death he inhe- rited a small freehold estate of about 60/. a year, which he farmed, renting at the same time a small farm in the neighbourhood of Heavitree. In this occupation he was en- gaged for some years ; but he was compelled to mortgage his estate, and in the spring of 1803 journeyed to London to avoid, accord- ing to his own account, an action for the non-payment of tithes. He was taken into the service of Isaac Blight, a ship-breaker living in the parish of St. Mary, Rother- hithe. In the summer of 1803 Blight, in order to protect himself against his creditors, appears to have executed an instrument con- Patch lO Pate veying his property to Patch. In Aug. 1805 it was arranged that Patch should become a real, instead of a nominal, partner in Blight*s business to the extent of one-third. For this share Patch paid Blight 250/., procured from the sale of his estate in Devonshire, and promised him, by 23 Sept. 1805, 1,000/., a sum that Patch knew he had no means of obtaining. On the evening of the 23rd Patch was alone with Blight in the front parlour of the latter*8 house, and about 8 p.m., just after Patch had been seen to leave the room. Blight was discovered by a servant lying wounded by a pistol-shot. Blight expired the next day, and Patch was tried for his mur- der on 5 April 1806, at the Sessions House in Horsemonger Lane, before Lord-chief- baron Macdonald. The prisoner, who ap- E eared dressed * in a handsome suit of black/ ehaved with the utmost coolness, and read a written defence. He was found guilty on clear circumstantial evidence, skilfully mar- shalled by the prosecution. Patch was deeply affected when visited in prison by his brother and by the sister of his deceased wife, but does not appear to have confessed the murder. He was executed on 8 April 1806 at nine o'clock, on a platform on the front of the gaol, Horsemonger Lane. A man and his wife were at the same time hanged for coining. The case excited great interest, and nume- rous accounts of the trial were published, among which were shorthand report s by J. & W. B. Gurnev, and by Blanchard & Ramsey (London, 1806, 8vo). A view and plan of Blight's house ai)peared in the < Lady's Magazine' for 1806, pp. 211-16. Fairburn's edition of the trial and an account published in vol. iv. of Kirby's * \\\\'onderfiil and Eccentric Museum ' (pp. 43-97) contain portraits of Patch, who is described (Ge7if.. Mag. 1806, p. 375, paged *383') as a man of heavy build, 'very round-shouldered, with a short thick neck and florid complexion.' [Gurney's Trial of Richard Patch, and other accounts (»f the Life and Trial of Patch, enum«'- rated in Brit. Mus. Cat. under ' Patch, Eichard.'] W. W. PATCH, Tl lOMAS (d. 1 782), painter and engraver, after studying art in London, went as a young man to Italy, making his way thither, chiefly on foot, in company with Richard Dalton the artist. He arrived at Rome some time before 1 750, and became a student at the academy there. He was patronised by the Earl of Charlemont and other amateurs, for whom he painted or copied pictures. His eccentric behaviour, however, drew on him the displeasure of the church authorities, and he had to leave Rome hurriedly towards the end of 1755. He then removed to Florence, where he resided until his death. When in Rome he became ac- quainted, and appears to have travelled in company, with bir Joshua Reynolds [q. v.], who introduced a portrait of Patch into the caricature of * The S^chool of Athens,' drawn by Reynolds in 1751. At Florence Patch became well known among the English resi- dents, and was a great friend of Sir Horace Mann [q. v.l, who frequently recommended Patch and his works to Horace Walpole and other friends in England or on their travels. Patch was one of the first artists to discern the supreme merits of Masaccio's frescos in the Church of the Carmini at Florence. He made careful drawings of these, which are the more valuable as the original paintings were shortly afterwards seriously damaged by fire. Though Patch had no previous ex- perience of engraving, he etched these draw- ings on copper, and published them in twenty- six plates in 1770 as *The Life of the Cele- brated Painter, Masaccio,' with a dedication to Sir Horace Mann. In 1772 he published a series of twenty-four etchings from the works of Fra Bartolommeo, dedicated to Horace Walpole ; and another series from the pic- tures by Giotto in the Church of the Carmini, dedicated to Bernardo Manetti. In 1774 he published a set of engravings by himself and F. Gregory from Lorenzo Ghiberti's Gates of the Haptist^ry of San Giovanni at Flo- rence. All these works have merit, and entitle Patch to a foremost place among the students of early Florentine art. Patch also executed a number of caricatures of English travellers and residents in Florence, including two of himself. A small 'caricature' painting of the bibliopliile Duke of Roxburghe, by Patch, is in the National Portrait Gallery. He painted conversation pieces and landscapes. Two views of the Arno by him are at Hamp- ton C'ourt; and he engraved a similar view : himself. He also engraved portraits of Ni- colas Poussin, Sir J. llawkwood, A. P. Bel- lori (after C. Maratti), some landscapes after Gaspar Poussin, &c. Patch was seized with apoplexy in Sir Horace Mann's house at Flo- rence, and died on 30 April 1 782. There are a few drawings by him in the print-room at the British Museum. His brother, James Patch, was a surgeon in Norfolk Street, London.

PATE or PATES, RICHARD (rf. 1505), bishop of Worcester, son of John Pate by Elinor, sister of John Longland [q. t.], bishop Pate II Pate of Lincoln, was bom in Oxfordshire, probably at Henley-on-Thames, and was admitted on 1 June 1622 a scholar of Corpus Christ i Col- lege, Oxford, whence he graduated B.A. on 15 Dec. 1623, according to Wood {Fast if ed. Bliss, i. 03). This degree having been com- pleted by determination, he went to Paris, and there graduated M.A. On 4 June 1623 he was collated by his uncle to the prebend of Centum Solidorum in the church of Lincoln, and he resigned it for that of Cro^redy in 1626. He appears to have resided lor some time at Bruges, as John Ludovicus Viv^, writing from that city on 8 July 1624 to Bishop Longland, the king's confessor, eays : * Kichard Pate, your sister s son, and Antony Barcher, your dependant, are won- derfully studious' (Brewer, Letters and Paj^rsof llmry VIII, vol. iv. pt. i. p. 203). In 162(5 he was made archdeacon of Worces- ter. On 11 March 1626-7 he had the stall of Sanctro Crucis, alias Spaldwick, in the church of Lincoln, and on 22 June 1628 the stall of Sutton cum Buckingham in the same church. On this latter date he was also made archdeacon of Lincoln upon the death of William Smith, doctor of decrees. His uncle, the bishop, wrote to Wolsey on 15 July 152^i : ' There is a house in the close at Lin- coln, belonging to the late archdeacon, wliich 1 should be glad of for a residence for my nephew, Kichard I'ate, archdeacon of Lin- coln, whom I should likfe to settle there ' (ih. vol. iv. pt. ii. p. 1973). In November 1633 Pate was appointed to be the king's ambassador resident in the court of the emperor, Charles V. During his ab- sence the bishop of Lincoln was not unmind- ful of his nephew's interests, and in a letter dated 27 Sept. 1535 he desired Cromwell's favour for the archdeacon of Lincoln, * whose great charges at this time are beyond what his income can bear,' and shortly afterwards he sought leave for the archdeacon to license his officers to visit his archdeaconry-, *or he will lack money to serve the king where he i<5, for this is the chief time of his profits.* In April 1536 Pate was at Home with the emperor, who complained of the course adopted by the king of England, and ener- getieally defended his own action on behalf of his aunt, Catherine of Arragon. Subse- quently he accompanied the emperor to the Low Countries. Soon afterwards be was recalled to England, and Sir Thomas Wyatt succeeded him as ambassador in the em- peror's court in March 1530-7. In June 1530 he had supplicated for the degree of B.1). at Oxford. On 8 July 1641 Pope Paul III ' provided ' Pate to the biahopric of Worcester, which had been vacated by the death of Cardinal Jerome Ghinucci, who had been deprived of the temporalities of the see in 1636 on account of his being a foreigner. Bishop Stubbs assigns the appointment and conse- cration of Pate to 1664, when he received the temporalities from Queen Mary {Begistrum Sacrum Anylicanwriy p. 81 ). It is to be noted that Nicholas Heath [q. v.], who was placed in this see by Henry v III in 1643, altnough rehabilitated by Cardinal Pole, and maae archbishop of York, was not recognised hj the pope as bishop of Worcester. In his * provision ' to York, Heath is styled * cleri- cus Eboracensis * (Brady, Episcopal Stuxes- sion in England, i. 61, 52^. Pate attended the council of Trent as bishop of Worcester, his first appearance there being in the session which opened on 21 April 1647. He was also present at the sittings of the council in September 1549 and in 1651. He remained in banishment during the reign of Edward VI. In 1642 he had been attainted of high treason, whereupon his archdeaconry was bestowed on George Heneage, and his prebend of East- harptre in the church of Wells on Dr. John Heryng. On tlie accession of Queen Mary he re- turned to this country. His attainder was revetted, and on 6 March 1554-6 he obtained possession of the temporalities of the see of Worcester (Rymek, Fadera, xv. 416). Queen Elizabeth deprived him of the tempora- lities in June bV>9, and cast him into prison. Uq was in the Tower of London on 12 Feb. i 1501-2, when he made his will, which has been printed by Brady. On regaining his liberty he withdrew to Louvain, where he died on 5 Oct. 1505. Mass is still said for him every year at the English College, Rome, on the anniversary of his death.

PATER, WALTER HORATIO (1839- 1894), critic and humanist, was born at Shad well in the oast of London on 4 Aug. 1839. He was the second son of Dr. Richard Glode Pater and Maria Hill, his wife. The family is of Dutch extraction, the critic's ancestors having, it is believed, come over from the Low Countries with William of Oranffe. It is said that the French painter Jean-Baptist€ Pater was of the same stock. The English Paters had settled at Olney in Buckinghamshire, w^here they lived all through the eighteenth century. Reserved and sny, preserving many of their Dutch habits, they are described in family tradition as mingling little with their neighbours, and as keeping through several generations this curious custom, that, while the sons wore always brought up as Roman catholics, the daughters were no less invariably trained in the Anglican faith. The father of Walter Pater quitted the Roman church before his marriage, without, however, adopting any other form of faith, and his two sons were the first Paters who were not brought up as catholics. The grandfather of the critic removed to New York, and there Richanl (41ode Pater was bom. He settled as a physician at Shadwell, and here were bom to him two sons — the elder, William Thomson Pater (1835-1888), a medical\" practitioner — and two daughters, who survive. Richard Glode I'ater died so early that his second son acarcely remembered him in later life. The family, at his decease, removed to a re- tired house in Chase Side, Enfield, w^hich has since been pulled down. Here they con- tinned to reside for fourteen or fifteen years. Walter Pater received the first elements of education in a local school at Enfield, but Sroceeded at the age of fourteen to King's chool, Canterbai7« Of the feelings and ex- periences of this change of life he has given a vivid picture in the * imaginary portrait ' called 'Emerald Uthwart.* l*ater was happy at King's School, in spite of his complete indifference to outdoor games. In his first years at public school he was idle and backward, nor was it till he reached the sixth form that his faculties seemed really to awaken. From the first, however, and long before he went to Canterbury, Walter had been considered the * clever * one of the family; not specially precocious, he was always meditative and serious — marked from the very cradle for the intellectual life. From the time when he first began to think of a future condition, his design was to be a clergyman, and this had received a great impetus, while he was yet a little boy, from his having seen, during a visit to Hursley, Keble, who walked and talked much with him, and encouraged him in his religious aspirations. Shortly before he lefb school, when he was entering his twentieth year. Pater read * Modem I'ainters,' and came very abruptly under the influence of Ruskin. The world of art was thus for the first time opened to him. But there is no truth in the fable, widely circulated at the time of his death, to the efi*ect that the finished and beautiful essay on * Winckelmann ' was written and even printed while the author was a school- boy at Canterburv. It was not until many years later that fater became aware of the existence of tlie German critic, and his essay was composed and published long after he was a fellow of Brasenose. He b not known to have made any attempt to write, either as a schoolboy or as an undergraduate, his earliest essays being as mature in style ns the author was mature in vears. Pater did not begin to practise the art of authorrihip until he had mastered all its secrets. On 11 June 1858 Pater entered Queen's College, Oxford, as a commoner, with an ex- hibition from Canterburv, and four vears later, in the Michaelmas t(^rm of 1 802, he fraduated BA. with a second class in classics, le was the pupil of Mr. W. W. Capes, then bursar and tutor of (Jueen's, and he was coached by Jowett, who was stmck by his abilities, and who said to him, * I think you have a mind that will come to great emi- nence.' Some years afterwards there was an estrangement of sympathy between Jowett and Pater, but this was removed in the last year of the life of each, and the master of Balliol was among those who congratulated Pater most cordially on his * Plato and Ila- tonism.' In 1802 Pater took rooms in the High Street, Oxford, and read with private Pater 14 Pater pupils.

His actual entry into the navy was probably in 1769, when he joined the Phoenix going out to the Guinea coast, with the broad pennant of his maternal uncle, Commodore George Anthony Tonyn. He afterwards served on the home and Newfoundland sta- tions ; in 1776 was in the Eagle, Lord Howe's flagship, on the coast of North America, and in 1777 was promoted by Howe to be lieu- tenant of the Stromboli, from which he was moved the next vear to the Briine.

In April 1780 he was appjointed to the Alcide of 74 guns, which joined Rodney in the West Indies in May ; went to New \\ ork with him during the summer; returned to the W^est Indies in November, and in the following January was present at the re- duction of St. Eustatius and the other Dutch islands [see Rodnet, George Bridges, Lord]. In February 1781 Paterson joined the Sandwich, Rodney's flagship ; went home with the admiral m the Gibraltar, and returned to the West Indies with him in the Formidable. On arriving on the station in the end of February, he was appointed acting- captain of the St. Eustatius, armed ship, and on 8 April was promoted to command the Blast, in which he returned to England on the conclusion of the peace. In 1793 I'aterson was appointed to the Gorgon, in which he went out to the Medi- terranean, where, on 20 Jan. 1794, he was posted to the Ariadne. On the reduction of Corsica he was moved into the Melpomene, and returned to England in 1795. In 1797 hs was inspecting captain of the quota men in Kircudbright and Wigtonshire, and in 1798 superintended the fitting of the Ad- miral de Vries, till she was turned over to the transport board. In 1800 he commanded the Montagu in the Channel, and in 1801-2 the San Fiorenzo. In 1810 he had charge of the French prisoners of war in Rochester Castle, and in 1811-12 commanded the Puis- sant guardship at Spithead. He was pro- moted to be rear-admiral on 12 Aug. 1812, vice-admiral 12 Aug. 1819, and admiral 10 Jan. 1837, but had no further service, and died on 10 March 1841. He married, in 1801, Jane Ellen, daughter of his first cousin, David Yeats, formerly registrar of East Florida. [Marshall's Roy. Nav. Biogr. i. 615; Service Book in the Public Record Office.] J. K. L. PATERSON, DANIEL (1739-1825), author of * The Road Book,' bom in 1739, was gazetted an ensign in the 30th foot on 13 Dec. 176o, promoted to be a lieutenant on 8 Mav 1772, was advanced to a captaincy in the 3(Uk foot on 11 July 1783, became a major in the army on 1 March 1794, and a lieutenant-colo- nel on 1 Jan. 1798. For many years he was an assistant to the (juartermatster-generalof his majesty's forces at the Horse Guards, London. On31Dec.l812hewasmadelieutenant-gover- nor of Quebec, and held the appointment to I his death. In 1771 he published * A New and Accurate Description of all the Direct and Principal Cross Roads in Great Britain, containing: i. An Alphabetical List of all the Cities, Boroughs, Marnet and Sea-port Towns in England and Wales; ii. The Direct Roads from London to all the Cities, Towns, and Remarkable Villages in England and Wales ; iii. The Cross Roads of England and Wales ; iv. The I'rincipal Direct and Cross Roads of Scotland ; v. The Circuits of the Judges.' The work, which is dedicated * To Lieute- nant Colonel Georpe Morrison, Quarter Mas- ter General of His Majesty's Forces,' soon became very well known in the army, as by its use all the distances of military marches Paterson 17 Paterson were calculated and charged in the public accounts. The second edition was called * Paterson's British Itinerary : being a new and accurate Delineation and Description of the lloads of Great Britain/ 1776, 2 vols. ; the third edition bore the original title. i'aterson latterly lived so retired a life that, when Edward Mog^ brought out a * re- modelled,augmented,and improved 'sixteenth edition of Paterson's * Roads ' in 1822, he in the preface spoke of the * death of the late proprietor.' The eighteenth and last edition came out in 1829. Paterson died at the residence of his friend, Colonel Dare, on Clewer Green, near Windsor, in April 1825, and was buried at Clewer on 21 April. Besides the works already mentioned, he wrote : 1. * A Travelling Dictionary, or Al- phabetical Tables of the Distances of all the Cities, Boroughs, Market Towns, and Sea- ports in Great Britain from each other,' 1772, 2 vols.; 6th edit. 1787. 2. * Topographical Description of the Island of Grenada,' 1780. 3. * A^Tew and Accurate Description of all the Direct and Principal Cross Roads in ScotUnd/ 5th edit. 1781.

PATERSON, Mrs. EMMA ANNE (1848-1886), organiser of trade unions among women, bom in London on 5 April 1848, was daughter of Henry Smith (rf. 18(54), head master of the schools of St. George's parish, Hanover Square. At a very youthful age she interested herself in the amelioration of the political and industrial condition of women^ and in 1867 became assistant secre- tary of the Workmen's Club and Institute Union. She thus gained opportunities of studying the trade organisations of working men. In February 1872 she transferred her services to the Women's Suttrage Association, of which she was appointed secretary. This post she resigned in 1873, when she married Thomas Paterson (1836-1882), a cabinet- maker and wood-carver of Scottish origin, who devoted his leisure to the study of eco- nomic and philosophical questions. He was successively honorary secretary and vice- chairman of the Working Men's Club and Institute Union, and organised the Work- men*s International Exhibition at the Agri- cultural Hall in 1870. Mr. and Mrs. Pater- son spent a prolonged honevmoon in Ame- rica. On her return to Lonaon in 1874 she founded the Women's Protective and 1^- vident League, with the object of helping working women to form trade unions. The VOL. XLIV. scheme was suggested to her by the Female Umbrella Makers' Union of New York. Of the Women's League Mrs. Paterson was honorary secretary and organiser until her death. Its members were largely men and women of the upper middle class who in- terested themselves in social reform, and were ready not only to give working women instruction in trade-unionist principles, but to pay the preliminary expenses of organising unions among women engaged in trade. A similar body was established at the same time at Bristol at Mrs. Paterson's suggestion, and was called the National Union of Working Women. The first women's union founded by the league in London was the bookbinders' in 1874. Unions of upholstresses, shirt-makers, tailoresses, and dressmakers quickly followed. In 1875 Mrs. Paterson was a delegate to the Trade Union Congress at Glasgow as a repre- sentative of the bookbinders' and uphol- stresses' societies. No woman had been ad- mitted to the congress before. She attended each succeeding congress (except that of 1882) until her death, and by her tact partially overcame the prejudices of the working-men delegates against female agitators. In the league's behalf she repeatedlv addressed public meetings in London, Oxford, and other cities in the provinces, and edited the ' Women's Union Journal,* a monthly record of the league's proceedings, which was started in February 1876. Meanwhile, in 1876, Mrs. Paterson had founded the Women's Printing Society at Westminster. To the manage- ment of that concern, which became a pro- nounced success, she devoted all her spare energies and personally mastered the printer's craft. Her husband died on 15 Oct. 1882. In 1886 she published, with a memoir, a pos- thumous work by him, * A New Method of Mental Science, with applications to Political Economy.' The views advanced were original and full of promise. In spite of increasing ill-health, Mrs. Paterson never relaxe<l her self-denying and sagacious labours until her death at her lodgings in Westminster on 1 Dec. 1886; she was buried in Paddington cemeterv. The Women's League was rechristened the- Women's Trade Union League in 1891. Thirty trade societies are now (1895) affiliated to it. A fund, raised in Mrs. Paterson's memory, was employed in securing offices for the associa- tion in the buildings of the Workmen's Club and Institute Union in Clerkenwell Road, which were completed in 1893.

Althoufrh his father was compelled by pe- cuniary difficulties to give up his farm and experienced various vicissitudes, the son re- ceived a fairly good education. Ultimately he was apprentic(*d to a printer at the otfice of the Kilmarnock * Mirror,' and in his thirteenth year began to contribute to Thomson's * Mis- cellany.* Subsequently he was transferred to the * Courier' office m Ayr, and on com- pleting his apprenticeship he went to Glasgow, where he joined the * Scots Times.' In 1826 he returned to Kilmarnock, and, having taken a shop as stationer and printer, he, in partner- ship with other gentlemen, started the Kil- marnock * Chronicle,' the first number appear- ing on 4 May 1831 , in the midst of the reform \" agitation, and the paper expiring in May 1 832. | In 1835 he left Kilmarnock for Dublin, where for some time he acted as Dublin corre- spondent of the Glasgow * Liberator.' Thence he went to Edinburgh, and ultimately found employment at a small salary in writing the letterpress for Kav's ' Edinburgh Portraits,' 1837-9, the majority of the biographies being contributed by him. Failing to find further employment in Edinburgh, he accepted in 1839 the editorship of the Ayr * Observer.' In 1840 he published * Contemporaries of Bums and the more recent Poets of Ayrshire,' and in 1847 a * IIit«torv()f the Countvof Ayr.' Disappointed with his ])rospocts on the Ayr 'Observer,' he again returned to PMinburgh, where he supported himself chiefly by miscel- laneous writing. In 1871 he publi.^hed* Au- tobiographical Reminiscences.' Shortly after this he was attacked by paralysis, and he died on 6 May 1876. His works are not character- ised by much literary merit, and are popular rather than scholarly. Paterson's publicatir^ns, other than those mentioned, were: 1. 'The Obit of the Church of St. John the Baptist at Ayr,' with a trans- lation and historical sketch,* 1848. 2. * The Poems of the Sempillaof Belt rees,* with notes, 1849. 3. *The Poems of William Hamilton of Bangoiir,' with a life of the poet, 1850. 4. * Memoir of James Fillans, Sculptor,' 1854. 5. * Origin of the Scots and of the Scottish Language,' 1 855 : 2nd ed. 1858. 6. * Historvof the Uegality of Mu.^selburgh,' 1857. 7. * Wal- lace and his Times,' 18.58, and several subse- quent editions. 8. *The Life and Poems of William Dunbar,' 18()(), 9.

Crawfiird's 'The Hunt ly Casket and other Poems,' 18()1. 10. * James the Fifth, or the Oudeman of Bal- lengich, his Poetry- and Adventures,' 1801. 11.* The History of the Counties of Ayr and Wigton,' 1863. 12. * A Contribution to His- torical Genealogy: The Breadalbane Succes- sion Case — how it arose and how it stands/ lH03. He had also some share in the pro- duction of P. H. M'Kirlie's * History of the Lands and their Owners in Galloway,' 1870, about which he had a dispute with the author. [Autobiogr. ReminiBcences, 1871 ; Irving's Eniiuent Scotsmen ; Brit. Mus. Cat.] T. F. H. PATERSON, JOHX (1632-1708), the last archbishop of Glasgow, bom in 1632, was eldest son of John Paterson, bishop of Ross. The father, bom about 1604, graduated at Aberdeen in 1624, and was appointed to the church of Foveran, Aberdeenshire, in 1632. He refused to sign the covenant of 16^{9, and fled south to the king. In July of the follow- ing year, however, he recanted in a sermon ])efore the general assembly, and was restored to his church at Foveran. He was a member of the commission of the assembly in 1644, 1(545, 1648, and 1649, and in 1661 he was named a commissioner for the visitation of the university of Aberdeen. In 1649 he had left Foveran to become minister of Kllon in Aberdeenshire. He was among the bene- factors contributing to the erection of a new building at Kings College, Aberdeen, in 1658 (Fasti Aberdonenses, Spalding Club, 1854, p. 541). In 1659 he was translated to the ministry of Aberdeen (the third charge). In 1662 he was promoted to the bishoj)ric of Ross, being consecrated on 7 May. He died in January 1679, leaving, besides the arch- bishop of Glasgow, George, of Seafield, com- missary ; Sir AVilliam of Granton, bart., clerk to the privy council; Thomas: Robert, prin- j cipal of Marischal College, Aberdeen ; and a daughter Isabella, who married Kenneth Mackenzie of Suddie ((Jordox, Scots Affairs, Spa ldixo, Memorials^ and Diary of the Lnird* cfBrodie, all published by the SpaldingClub ; GuTURiK, Memoirs ; Scott, Fasti EccL Scot, iii. 454, 602, 607). The son John, who may possibly have ■ made some preliminary studies at King's College, Aberdeen, was admitted as a stu- dent of theology at St. Andrews on 13 March 1655, and he is entered as regent in St. Leonard's College under date of 3 Feb. 1658, indicating that he had taught the junior class in the preceding year (informa- tion from Mr. J. M. Anderson, keeper of the records at St. Andrews). He probably continued to teach there until called to succeed his father (not without some oppo- sition. Synod liecords of Aberdeen, Spalding Club, 1846, p. 260) at Ellon on 6 Nov. 1059, to which charge he was admitted before 15 Jul V 1060. On 24 Oct. 1662 he was elected Paterson 19 Paterson by the town council of Edinburgh as minister 01 the Tron Church, and was admitted 4 Jan. following. From that charp^e he was promoted to the deanery of the High Kirk on 12 July 1()72. and w^as admitted a burgess and guild-brother of the city on 13 Nov. 1673. He strongly opposed the proposal of the more moderate party in the Scottish church in 1674 to hold a national synod. Through the influence of his patron, the Duke of Lauderdale, he was appointed on 20 Oct. 1674 to the see of Galloway, but was not consecrated until May 1675 at Edinburgh (Lawsox, Hi$t. of Soottish Epi- scopal Church, p. 34; Grub, EccL Hist of Scotl. iii. 249). For a few years father and son were thus occupants of Scottish sees at the same time. On 27 Sept. 1678 he was appointed a privy councillor. lie was trans- lated to Edinburgh on 29 March 1679. In the previous January he had obtained license from the king to reside in Edinburgh, on the ground that he had not a competent manse or dwelling-house in Galloway (Stephens, JJfe ofSharpCf p. 568). A pension of 100/. per annum was granted him on 9 July 1680. lie is found assisting on 15 March 1684-5 at Lambeth at Sancroft's consecration of Baptist Levinz [q. v.], the bishop of Sodor and Man. On 20 July 1685 an oixler was made for an annual payment to him by the city of Edinburgh of twelve hundred marks until the city should build him a house and chapel. He went to London in February 1086, re- turning at the end of March to give the king assurances that the bishops would support his proposed toleration, although it was re- ported by the Duke of Hamilton in the fol- lowing year that he was not in favour of such an entire repeal of thi^ penal laws as the king desired (Hist. MSS. Comm. 11th Rep. App. vi. p. 175). He was rewarded by being nominated to the see of Glasgow on 21 Jan. 1687, upon the illegal deprivation of Archbishop Alexander Cairncross [(j. v.] On 29 Jan. 16S8 he preached a thanksgiving sermon at Edinburgh for the queen's being with child, in whicn he mentioned that she often spent six hours at a time on her knees in prayer. At the Revolution he, with the majonty of the bishops, adhered to James 11. At the meeting of the estates in April 1689, when nine bishops were present, of whom seven were against declaring the throne va- cant, ' the Bishop of Glasgow made a long discourse of passive obedience* {if>, 12th Kep. App. vii. p. 237). He remained in Edin- burgh, living in privacy, after the Revolution, but is said in W. Nelson Clarke's preface to a 'Collection of Letters,' &c. (Iklinburgh, 1848y p. xxxi), to have been arrested in 1692 on suspicion of holding correspondence with the exiled court, and to have been imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle. The authority for this statement is not given ; and a further state- ment that he remained in prison until 1701 is incorrect, as, at some date previous to 1695, he was banished from Scotland to England, and was restrained to London. Among the papersof the Earlof Rosslyn at Dysart House (Hist. MSS, Comm. 1871, 2nd Rep. p. 192) there is a journal kept by Paterson in London in 1695-6, in which he records interviews with statesmen while seeking permission from William III to return to Scotland. Leave was at that time refused, and he was also forbidden to reside in any of the northern counties of England. He was, however, shortly after- wards permitted to return to Edinburgh, and probably regained complete liberty upon the accession of Queen Anne in 1 702. In that year he wrote a letter from Edinburgh to Bishop Compton of London on the subject of tolera- tion for the episcopal clergy. He exerted himself in the following years, together with the other Scottish bishops, in endeavouring to obtain gprants from the government for relief of poor clergymen, as well as some allowance for themselves out of the revenues of their sees. It was the queen's intention that such grants should be made, but it was not carried into real effect, except with regard to Bishop Alexander Ross [q. v.] of Edinburgh and Paterson himself. On 7 Dec. 1704 Paterson and Bishop Rose, with others, accredited Dr. Robert Scot, dean of Glasgow, as an agent to make collections in P]ngland. Their letters, with a list of contributions, were printed in 18(54 in the 'Anticjuarian Communications of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society' (ii. 226- 231). At the beginning of 1705 he went to London to personally approach the gueen on the subject. He was favourably received, and obtained a promise of 1,600/. annually, out of which George Lockhart [q. v.] of Camwath charges him with securing 400/. for himself, although he was then worth 20,000/., or, as the archbishop of Canterbury reported (ac- cording to Paterson's own statement), 30,000/. But Paterson declared that he never had a third of the latter sum. On 25 Jan. 1705, in consequence of the number of surviving bishops beingreduced to five, he, with Bishops Rose and Douglas of Dunblane, consecrated, in a private chapel in his own house at Edin- burgh, Bishops FuUarton and Sage. I le died in his house on 9 Dec. 1 708, and was buried on the 23rd in the Chapel Royal of Holyrood, at the east end of the north side, at the foot of Bishop Wishart's monument.
