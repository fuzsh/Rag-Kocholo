Their most recent post together was from September 2017, where Paul shared a sweet video of the pair posing together.

The actor captioned the post: "Fire in the booth @stephyclark."

Paul plays Arthur Shelby in the popular BBC series Peaky Blinders alongside well-known names including Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy.

On the BBC series, Paul's character is married to Linda Shelby played by actress Kate Phillps.

"They share a child together, there's definitely no chance Arthur would let Linda get away with Billy, so they're tied together, with the family connection, and obviously family is a big connection in Peaky Blinders."

Talking to Digital Spy, she continued: "I'd like to think she's going to be around and maybe there might be some reconciliation to have, but also you know her fury is pretty palpable by the end of episode five.

"But also like it does beg the question â€“ how do you come back from trying to kill your husband?"

Filming of the sixth series of the show is yet to be announced.
