        "text": "OK - I'm trying to figure something out for a project I'm working. Basically I'm trying to break down all of the eras of Popeye shorts and cartoons series - both theatrical and non-theatrical which has proven a bit of a task.\n\nNow I know that there were 234 Popeye theatrical shorts produced between Fleischer and Famous Studios but what I need is some help filling in the blanks on the other stuff. This is the info I've compiled so far for my project. Anything in red I need help filling out:\n\n108 at Fleischer Studios (1930-1942)\n\n- Classic series\n\n- Introduces: Popeye, Olive, Wimpy, Poopdeck Pappy, Sweepea, The Jeep, The Goons\n\n- Black and White Series\n\n- 3 extended color cartoons produced: Sinbad the Sailor, Ali Baba, Aladdin's Lamp\n\n- Directors: Fleischer brothers\n\n- Only a few banned WW2 cartoons near the end of the run.\n\n- Syndicated on CN\n\n1st Cartoon - Popeye the Sailor\n\nFinal Cartoon - Baby Wants a Bottleship\n\n126 at Famous Studios (1942-1957)\n\n- 2nd Classic series, Starts out strong ends kind of weak\n\n- Early cartoons are almost no different in style from the Fleischer run\n\n- Far less concentration on the side characters during this series outside of sporadic Wimpy appearances.\n\n- Latter cartoons have a limited \"UPA studio-style\" to them.\n\n- Starts in black and white at the very beginning, ends in color\n\n- Directors: Isadore Sparber, Seymour Kneitel (became synonymous with Popeye shorts during this and the latter run), Dan Gordon, Bill Tytla, David Tendlar\n\n- Large amount of banned WW2 cartoons at the beginning of the run, many of which are considered the best Popeye shorts.\n\n- Sparse amount of filler/remake shorts during this run.\n\n- Syndicated on CN\n\n1st Cartoon - You're a Sap, Mr. Jap\n\nFinal Cartoon - Spooky Swabs\n\n220 at King Features Syndicate (1960-1962)\n\n- 3rd Series, Television shorts done in style/format of the classic shorts.\n\n- Produced at six different studios\n\n- All color\n\n- Reintroduces the side characters from the Fleischer shorts and completely introduced Thimble theater characters and locales into the series: King Blozo, The Sea Hag (villian), Olive Oyls family, Diesel Oyl (Olive's niece), Roughhouse, Geezil, Alice the Goon and more concentration on Wimpy.\n\n- Bluto renamed Brutus\n\n- More concentration on fleshing out Popeye's universe that wasn't done in the Famous shorts.\n\n- Not the greatest when stacked next to Fleischer and Famous, but there are quite a few gems here and there. Cartoon quality was largely dependent on the director:\n\nThe Kneitel produced shorts (2nd largest of this era), were done at Paramount by the original storymen and animators from Famous. They knew how to handle the characters and the stories were normally pretty good. These are considered the best of this series on par with the latter portion of the Famous run. Closest to the \"classic series\" in terms of style.\n\nJack Kinney produced the largest amount of shorts during this period. His Popeyes are not up to the standards of Fleischer and Famous but are usually considered second best in this era. Some shorts were quite funny, but when they failed, the failed miserably.\n\nGene Deitch's (Tom and Jerry) shorts have some really weird stories (like \"Swee'pea Soup\"), but there's some really good, wacky animation in the early run. The later shorts however, are very mediocre.\n\n- Other directors incredibly weak or stitled even for TV by comparison. Some very bland\n\n- Directors: Kneitel, Kinney, Deitch, Ray, McDonald, Fennel\n\n- \"Lost Popeye series\", never syndicated after the 80's.\n\n1st Cartoon - Barbeque for Two\n\nFinal Cartoon - Hamburgers Aweigh\n\n??? at Hanna Barbera - Original Run (1978-1983)\n\nThe All-New Popeye Hour\n\nThe Popeye & Olive Show\n\nOlive Oyl in the Army\n\n- 4th Series, 1st major Popeye revival, Consisted of shorts and long adventures\n\n- Hour long format in the first part of the run, 30 minute in the latter run\n\n- All color\n\n- 1st Hanna Barbera Popeye series\n\n- Puts Popeye back in his original costume (dress blues and reds)\n\n- Brutus renamed Bluto\n\n- Formatted similarly to the Super Friends Hour: halfway through the show, there was Popeye's Treasure Hunt, which sent Popeye & Olive on various scavenger hunts around the world, with Bluto the primary rival. There would be health & safety tips with Popeye and his nephews, among others.\n\n- Popeye & Olive Show consisted of reruns of the first series plus Olive in the Army shorts\n\n-Thimble Theater adventure style shorts - \"Other Lost Popeye series\", never syndicated after the 80's.\n\n- Typical HB animation of that period\n\n1st Cartoon - Unknown???\n\nFinal Cartoon - Unknown???\n\n13 at Hanna Barbera - 2nd Run (1987-1988)\n\nPopeye and Son\n\n- 13 episode series\n\n- Half Hour format\n\n- \"Future\" series where Popeye is married to Olive Oyl and has a kid: Junior.\n\n- Bluto's son: Junior's rival was named Tank. Name of Bluto's wife?\n\n- Wimpy's son: Junior's sidekick was named Woody\n\n- Largely considered the most derivative of the Popeye series. Not awful but certainly not good. Effectively killed the Popeye revival?\n\n- Never shown in syndication.\n\n1st Cartoon - Unknown???\n\nFinal Cartoon - Unknown???\n\nSo there you go. Anybody that can help me fill out the gaps in red or expand any more on what I have now will be of great help to me. Coincidentally, I'm rather curious as to what you guys consider the best and the worst parts of each era if you've seen them all as well as the best and worst of the 5 Popeye series combined?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nAh, the memories.\n\nThere are various websites that may have a more accurate filmography of the shorts. I'm going to focus on the H-B work.\n\n1. The All-New Popeye Hour (1978-82).\n\nFormatted similarly to the All-New Super Friends Hour from the previous year. Halfway through the show, there was Popeye's Treasure Hunt, which sent Popeye & Olive on various scavenger hunts around the world, with Bluto the primary rival. There was an additional feature not connected to Popeye at all, Digby Dog, whose adventures followed Treasure Hunt. There would be health & safety tips with Popeye and his nephews, among others.\n\n2. The Popeye & Olive Show (1982-83).\n\nNever saw this incarnation, as it was airing at lunch time when local affiliates would black out network shows in favor of more profitable (to them, anyway) syndicated programming. What I do know is that Olive was spun off into her own solo feature, putting her in the Army a full year after ABC tried the same thing with Laverne & Shirley. Alice the Goon joined Olive for these. At least they weren't on a base with a talking pig.......! Cancelled after one season.\n\n3. Popeye & Son (1988-89).\n\n10 years after his CBS debut, Popeye returned, and it was postulated that at some future point, he'd married Olive at long last and they had a child of their own. Bluto somehow had a son, too. Disney would try something similar a few years later by giving Goofy & Black Pete sons for Goof Troop. Never saw this until the reruns aired on USA. Cancelled after one season.\n\nI should point out that the All-New Popeye Hour was trimmed in half, retitled the All-New Popeye Show, for its final season (1981-2). During the period from 1978-83, there was at least one Popeye prime time special, Sweethearts at Sea, with Sea Hag as the villain of the piece. Never saw this one, either.\n\nFrom the new DVD collection, I heard that the HB Popeye had to tone down the violence, so Popeye had to use other means besides his fists to defeat Bluto.\n\nWere the OP and CL missing? I remember the Family airing omitted the OP and sped up the CL.\n\nMore on Popeye & Son:\n\nBluto's son's name was Tank. Bluto's wife was a large, loud woman, who let's just say was perfect for Bluto. Bluto, like Pete would in Goof Troop, owned a car dealership, only I believe Bluto was a bit more honest in his dealings.\n\nAnd strangely tolerant to freaks. One episode had Junior befriending this new kid in town, an Eddie Munster clone complete with monster family (Dracula dad, Mummy, and Frankenstein's monster grandpa). Tank gets Bluto to send a torch-wielding mob to attack the family's house, accidentally setting a fire in the process. Fortunately, Junior and the monster family save the day, leading Bluto to browbeat his son for his bigotry.\n\nWe also got Popeye and Olive's wedding, on a tugboat with the captain doing the honors and a metal nut as a wedding ring (Popeye's anniversary gift is a diamond-studded nut-ring).\n\nIt should also be noted that Popeye took a backseat in many episodes, as the show focused primarily on Junior and Woody (Wimpy's son). Junior also had a HUGE disgust for spinach, similar to how Popeye did in the live action movie.\n\nActually, there was less focus on Woody, with Junior having a boy and two girls (names unknown) as his gang. And yes, every time Junior ate the spinach, he yelled YUCK!"
