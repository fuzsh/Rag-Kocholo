        "text": "What follows is Part I of “Dirty Work,” my oral history of recording with Steely Dan. (Read the introduction here.) Only paid subscribersto Expanding Dan get access to all seven parts.\n\nPart I: From Band to ‘Expanded Band’\n\nGary Katz (producer): I moved to L.A. in November of 1971 to take a staff producer job at ABC/Dunhill Records. A few months later, I got Donald and Walter out there, and they signed as staff writers for the label. They were writing songs for groups like the Grass Roots and Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds. The head of A&R at ABC/Dunhill, Steve Barri, really liked Donald and Walter, but their music didn’t translate well for the pop bands on the label. I was able to convince Steve that Donald and Walter needed to record their own music. He was extremely supportive and got us a budget. That’s how the first Steely Dan album, Can’t Buy a Thrill, came to be. When “Do It Again” and “Reelin’ in the Years” became hits, it was a surprise."
