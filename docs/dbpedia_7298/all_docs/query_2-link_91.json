        "text": "[Updated 8/14/2024]\n\nJust as Hollywood seemed to be recovering from its pandemic woes, the industry had to contend with both a WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, which caused production delays and shifted big release dates. But we’ve finally moved past that, and 2024 is nigh upon us, bringing with it exciting superhero movies, a highly anticipated musical adaptation, George Miller’s return to Mad Max, a third Avatar, and much, much, more. See below for the movies we’re most looking forward to in 2024, and check back regularly as we make more updates to the list!\n\nRecommended: The Most Anticipated TV & Streaming of 2024\n\nRecommended: The Best Movies of 2024, Ranked by Tomatometer\n\nSee January-July Titles\n\nAugust\n\nBorderlands (2024)\n\nDirected by: Eli Roth\n\nStarring: Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Ariana Greenblatt, Jamie Lee Curtis, Edgar Ramirez, Haley Bennett, Florian Munteanu\n\nOpening on: August 9, 2024\n\nGet ready for some outer space shenanigans as Eli Roth takes the helm for this adaptation of the popular and wacky video game series. The cast includes big names like Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black, and the film was written by Craig Mazin, who recently helped make a hit out of another acclaimed video game franchise, The Last of Us.\n\nTrap (2024)\n\nDirected by: M. Night Shyamalan\n\nStarring: Josh Hartnett, Saleka Shyamalan, Hayley Mills, Marnie McPhail\n\nOpening on: August 9, 2024\n\nM. Night Shyamalan’s latest film is a thriller on a smaller scale than some of his previous work, focusing on a father (Josh Hartnett) who takes his daughter to a pop concert and discovers the whole affair is an elaborate trap to capture a notorious serial killer rumored to be in attendance. The twist: Hartnett’s character is the killer. But knowing Shyamalan, we’re sure that’s not the only surprise in the film.\n\nAlien: Romulus (2024)\n\nDirected by: Fede Alvarez\n\nStarring: Isabela Merced, Cailee Spaeny, Archie Renaux, David Jonsson, Spike Feam, Aileen Wu\n\nOpening in: August 16, 2024\n\nThe new film comes from Don’t Breathe director Fede Álvarez and will follow “a group of young people on a distant world, who find themselves in a confrontation with the most terrifying life form in the universe.”\n\nThe Crow (2024)\n\nDirected by: Rupert Sanders\n\nStarring: Bill Skarsgård, Danny Huston, Laura Birn, Jordan Bolger, FKA Twigs\n\nOpening on: August 23, 2024\n\nBased on the same comic book series as the 1994 film starring Brandon Lee (who famously died during filming), this new iteration stars Bill Skarsgård as Eric Draven aka The Crow, and it’s directed by Rupert Sanders, who previously helmed Snow White and the Huntsman and Ghost in the Shell.\n\nAfrAId (2024)\n\nDirected by: Chris Weitz\n\nStarring: Keith Carradine, Katherine Waterston, Riki Lindhome, John Cho, Havana Rose Liu\n\nOpening in: August 30, 2024\n\nAfter Sony moved Kraven the Hunter out of their August 30 slot, they replaced it with this horror film from writer-director Chris Weitz (About a Boy, writer of The Creator) starring Katherine Waterston, John Cho, and Keith Carradine. Similar to last year’s smash success M3GAN, the story here revolves around a young family whose new, state-of-the-art AI home assistant takes on a life of its own.\n\nSeptember\n\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice (2024)\n\nDirected by: Tim Burton\n\nStarring: Michael Keaton, Winona Ryder, Catherine O’Hara, Jenna Ortega, Justin Theroux, Monica Belluci, Willem Dafoe\n\nOpening on: September 6, 2024\n\nTim Burton reteams with Michael Keaton to return to one of his early iconic characters in this sequel to 1988’s Beetlejuice. Winona Ryder and Catherine O’Hara are also both on board to reprise their characters Lydia and Delia Deetz, while Jenna Ortega joins the cast as Lydia’s daughter.\n\nSpeak No Evil (2024)\n\nDirected by: James Watkins\n\nStarring: James McAvoy, Mackenzie Davis, Scott McNairy\n\nOpening on: September 13, 2024\n\nJames McAvoy and Mackenzie Davis star in this remake of the 2022 Danish psychological thriller about a married couple with kids who meet another family on vacation, accept an invitation to visit their home later, and begin to sense increasingly undertones lurking behind the hospitality of their hosts. The film is directed by James Watkins, who gave us the similarly disturbing Eden Lake, as well as The Woman in Black and one of the darker episodes of Black Mirror, “Shut Up and Dance.”\n\nHis Three Daughters (2023)\n\nDirected by: Azazel Jacobs\n\nStarring: Carrie Coon, Elizabeth Olsen, Natasha Lyonne\n\nPremiering on: September 20, 2024 on Netflix (after debuting in select theaters on September 6, 2024)\n\nIndie hitmaker Azazel Jacobs, known for his work in The Lovers and French Exit, is bringing a family drama to Netflix’s fall lineup. His Three Daughters finds Natasha Lyonne, Carrie Coon, and Elizabeth Olsen as estranged siblings who meet again to care for their ill father. After a critically acclaimed Toronto International Film Festival premiere in 2023, the film was acquired by Netflix and is anticipated to be a top prize contender for the streaming giant when awards season approaches.\n\nTransformers One (2024)\n\nDirected by: Josh Cooley\n\nStarring: Scarlett Johansson, Chris Hemsworth, Brian Tyree Henry, Jon Hamm, Laurence Fishburne, Keegan-Michael Key\n\nOpening on: September 20, 2024\n\nThe Transformers franchise returns to its roots with an animated prequel that explores the origins of the titular robots’ home world of Cybertron and the rivalry between Optimus Prime and Megatron. It will be separate from the ongoing narrative of the live-action films, and it will be helmed by Toy Story 4 director Josh Cooley, with Chris Hemsworth as the voice of Optimus Prime and Brian Tyree Henry as Megatron.\n\nOctober\n\nJoker: Folie à Deux (2024)\n\nDirected by: Todd Phillips\n\nStarring: Joaquin Phoenix, Lady Gaga, Brendan Gleeson, Zazie Beetz, Catherine Keener, and Jacob Lofland\n\nOpening on: October 4, 2024\n\nDirector Todd Phillips helms this follow-up to the wildly successful R-rated take on the iconic Batman villain that earned Joaquin Phoenix the Oscar for Best Actor. In Folie à Deux, Phoenix will be joined by Lady Gaga, who is playing his love interest (it’s complicated) Harley Quinn, and the film will reportedly be a musical. Yes, you read that right.\n\nTerrifier 3 (2024)\n\nDirected by: Damien Leone\n\nStarring: David Howard Thornton\n\nOpening on: October 25, 2024\n\nWe don’t know much about the third installment of the cult favorite horror franchise Terrifier, but we do know that David Howard Thornton will return to play Art the Clown and that the film will be set on Christmas Eve. The budget is also reportedly much larger than the previous two films, so fans can look forward to upgraded production value.\n\nWolf Man (2025)\n\nDirected by: Leigh Whannell\n\nStarring: Julia Garner, Christopher Abbott\n\nOpening on: October 25, 2024\n\nIt’s still a bit early to speculate too much about this film, but Universal’s next classic monster reboot comes courtesy of the director who brought us the surprise 2020 hit The Invisible Man, namely Leigh Whannell. We do know that Julia Garner and Christopher Abbott have signed on to star, but that’s about it. If Whannell can bring the same kind of flair that made The Invisible Man a runaway success, we can expect good things.\n\nVenom: The Last Dance (2024)\n\nDirected by: Kelly Marcel\n\nStarring: Tom Hardy, Juno Temple, Chiwetel Ejiofor\n\nOpening on: October 25, 2024\n\nTom Hardy returns for this third installment of the Spider-Man-adjacent antihero franchise, centering on a San Francisco reporter possessed by an alien symbiote. Writer Kelly Marcel steps in behind the camera for this one, whose plot we really don’t know much about yet.\n\nNovember\n\nGladiator II (2024)\n\nDirected by: Ridley Scott\n\nStarring: Paul Mescal, Denzel Washington, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou, Joseph Quinn, Derek Jacobi\n\nOpening on: November 22, 2024\n\nRidley Scott returns to direct this sequel to the historical epic Gladiator. The story will reportedly revolve around a grown-up Lucius (played by Paul Mescal), who has become emperor, and will see the return of Connie Nielsen as Lucilla.\n\nWicked (2024)\n\nDirected by: Jon M. Chu\n\nStarring: Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, Jonathan Bailey, Michelle Yeoh, Jeff Goldblum, Bronwyn James, Bowen Yang\n\nOpening on: November 22, 2024\n\nThe legendary Broadway musical that tells the tale of the Wicked Witch of the West from a different perspective is getting a two-part film adaptation. Director Jon M. Chu (Crazy Rich Asians, In the Heights) will take audiences to Oz, while Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande will play Elphaba and Glinda, respectively.\n\nMoana 2 (2024)\n\nDirected by: Dave Derrick Jr.\n\nStarring: Auli’i Cravalho, Dwayne Johnson\n\nOpening on: November 27, 2024\n\nDisney made an unexpected announcement in February that a sequel to their hit 2016 animated film Moana, featuring the voices of Auli’i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson, would be releasing in theaters in November. The announcement gave us the name of the director, Dave Derrick Jr., who previously worked on films like How to Train Your Dragon, Megamind, and other Disney projects like Raya and the Last Dragon, Encanto, and of course the first Moana, and while no cast has been officially announced yet, we can expect Cravalho and Johnson to return as Moana and Maui.\n\nDecember\n\nKraven the Hunter (2024)\n\nDirected by: J.C. Chandor\n\nStarring: Aaron Taylor-Johnson\n\nOpening on: December 13, 2024\n\nOriginally set to appear sometime in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man franchise before it was discontinued by Sony, the classic Spidey villain finally makes the jump to the big screen. The film will be directed by J.C. Chandor (All Is Lost, Triple Frontier), with Aaron Taylor-Johnson (who portrayed Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver in Avengers: Age of Ultron) set to play the character.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim (2024)\n\nDirected by: Kenji Kamiyama\n\nStarring: Brian Cox, Miranda Otto\n\nOpening on: December 13, 2024\n\nWarner Bros. latest film in the Lord of the Rings universe is this animated prequel that follows the exploits of Helm Hammerhand, the legendary king of Rohan, home of the horsemen known as the Rohirrim that played a big part in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. Brian Cox will lend his voice to the central character, who reigned 183 years before the events of The Two Towers, while the latter film’s Miranda Otto reprises her role as Eowyn, who will serve as a framing device for the story.\n\nMufasa: The Lion King (2024)\n\nDirected by: Barry Jenkins\n\nStarring: Aaron Pierre, Kevin Harrison Jr., Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner, and John Kani\n\nOpening on: December 20, 2024\n\nThe “live-action” Lion King (which was 100 percent computer-generated and not actually live action, to be clear) is getting a prequel that will explore the backstory of Simba’s father, Mufasa. James Earl Jones, who voiced Mufasa in the original Lion King and the remake, will not voice this younger version of Mufasa, and instead Aaron Pierre will play the character. Kelvin Harrison Jr. will play Scar, who goes by Taka when the events of the film take place.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 3 (2024)\n\nDirected by: Jeff Fowler\n\nStarring: Ben Schwartz, Idris Elba, James Marsden, and Colleen O’Shaughnessey\n\nOpening on: December 20, 2024\n\nThe Sonic the Hedgehog film franchise is speeding right along with a third installment that will presumably bring back Ben Schwartz as Sonic, Colleen O’Shaughnessey as Tails, and Idris Elba as Knuckles. Jim Carrey, who played the villainous Dr. Robotnik in the first two movies, might sit this one out as he’s been talking about retiring from acting. But, there will be at least one foe giving Sonic a run for his money, as Sonic 2 teased a new villain, Shadow the Hedgehog, in its post-credits scene.\n\nNosferatu (2024)\n\nDirected by: Robert Eggers\n\nStarring: Bill Skarsgård, Lily-Rose Depp, Nicholas Hoult, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Emma Corrin, Willem Dafoe\n\nOpening on: December 25, 2024\n\nRobert Eggers (The Witch, The Lighthouse) follows up his action epic The Northman with a passion project he’s been working on for years. This remake of the classic 1922 vampire film of the same name looks to follow a similar plot, centering on a young woman (Lily-Rose Depp) and the vampire (Bill Skarsgård) who is infatuated with her.\n\nA Complete Unknown (2024)\n\nDirected by: James Mangold\n\nStarring: Timothée Chalamet, Edward Norton, Elle Fanning, Monica Barbaro, Boyd Holbrook\n\nOpening on: December 25, 2024\n\nAn early 1960s New York is the setting for James Mangold’s A Complete Unknown.
