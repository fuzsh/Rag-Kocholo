As I get info on each episode I will post it here, and once it is complete well, I'll say so. ;^) Please do not copy any of the synopses and/or comments here without permission, as they are mine and original.\n\nYes, I know that these are \"theatrical films\" and not \"episodes\" but, it is easier to refer to them as episodes, which is why I have done so. If you are a Popeye purist, please avert your eyes. ;^)\n\nAnd, those links to the Internet Movie Database are there for a reason. If you have seen the film in question, please go to the IMDb and vote for it! Thanks. ;) (If any of the links don't work please tell me.) While you're at the IMDb and you've seen the film in question, why not leave a review? I don't have to be the only one having that kind of fun. ;^)\n\nA BALMY SWAMI\n\nReleased: Jul 22, 1949\n\nDirector: I.

Sparber\n\nStudio: Paramount / Famous Studios\n\nPopeye and Bluto pine for the exotic Princess Alona.\n\nComments: Wow. Popeye is single-handedly responsible for the decline in the cayman population.

Heck, I wouldn't want to be Popeye's emeny!\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nBABY WANTS A BATTLE\n\nReleased: Jul 24, 1953\n\nDirector: Seymour Kneitel\n\nStudio: Paramount / Famous Studios\n\nPopeye recounts a day in his infancy when Bluto gave him a hard time.\n\nComments: The baby versions of Popeye and Bluto are cute, but I don't buy Pappy in a tweed suit, and not talking like an old salt.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nBABY WANTS A BOTTLESHIP\n\nReleased: Jul 3, 1942\n\nStudio: Max Fleischer\n\nPopeye babysits Swee'pea while Olive goes shopping.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nBABY WANTS SPINACH\n\nReleased: Sep 29, 1950\n\nDirector: Seymour Kneitel\n\nStudio: Paramount / Famous Studios\n\nPopeye is stuck babysitting.\n\nComments: I like this one okay, but I wish Swee'pea actually looked like Swee'pea.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nBARKING DOGS WON'T FITE\n\nReleased: Oct 28, 1949\n\nDirector: I. Sparber\n\nStudio: Paramount / Famous Studios\n\nOlive presents Popeye with a foofy French poodle, but Popeye's embarrassed to be seen in public with a \"sissy dawrg.\"\n\nComments: I have to crack up at Popeye walking the dog from behind a fence. And sure the ending of this one is predictable but who cares?

Will Popeye stand for it?\n\nComments: Firstly, you should know that this is not the Barnacle Bill from the comic strip, but is merely Bluto under a different name. Also, most of the film is done like some sort of operatic ballad--very unusual. The end is great. Popeye has a backbone after all!\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nBIG BAD SINDBAD\n\nReleased: Dec 12, 1952\n\nDirector: Seymour Kneitel\n\nStudio: Paramount / Famous Studios\n\nPopeye tells (three of) his nephews the tale of his encounter with Sindbad, known as the world's greatest sailor.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nBIG CHIEF UGH-AMUGH-UGH\n\nReleased: Apr 25, 1938\n\nStudio: Max Fleischer\n\nBig Chief Ugh-Amugh-Ugh wants Olive to be his new bride.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nBLOW ME DOWN\n\nReleased: Oct 27,1933\n\nStudio: Max Fleischer\n\nPopeye encounters Olive while in Mexico, but must compete with Bluto for her affection.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nBLUNDER BELOW\n\nReleased: Feb 13, 1942\n\nStudio: Max Fleischer\n\nPopeye takes an artillery class aboard a battleship.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nBRIDE AND GLOOM\n\nReleased: Jul 2, 1954\n\nDirector: I.

Inspired, he goes out to spread 'Brotherly Love' to his fellow man.\n\nComments: A fun ep. Popeye's such a nice guy it hurts sometimes. ;^)\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nBULLDOZING THE BULL\n\nReleased: Aug 19, 1938\n\nStudio: Max Fleischer\n\nPopeye accidentally becomes a bullfighter while infatuated with Senorita Olive.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nCAN YOU TAKE IT\n\nReleased: Apr 27, 1934\n\nStudio: Max Fleischer\n\nPresident of \"The Bruiser Boys Club\" Bluto puts Popeye through a number of tests when the sailor attempts to join.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nCAR-AZY DRIVERS\n\nReleased: Jul 22, 1955\n\nDirector: Seymour Kneitel\n\nStudio: Paramount / Famous Studios\n\nPopeye very bravely attempts to teach Olive how to drive.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nCARTOONS AIN'T HUMAN\n\nReleased: Sep 3, 1943\n\nDirector: Seymour Kneitel\n\nStudio: Paramount / Famous Studios\n\nPopeye creates his own animated cartoon and shows it to Olive and his nephews.\n\nComments: This one is so absurd it's fantastic. Not to be missed.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nCHILD PSYKOLOJIKY\n\nReleased: Jul 11, 1941\n\nStudio: Max Fleischer\n\nSwee'pea won't let Popeye and Pappy play poker in peace.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nCHILD SOCKOLOGY\n\nReleased: Mar 27, 1953\n\nDirector: I. Sparber\n\nStudio: Paramount / Famous Studios\n\nSwee'pea manages to get into a heap of mischief while Popeye and Bluto fight.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nCHOOSE YOUR WEPPINS\n\nReleased: May 31, 1935\n\nStudio: Max Fleischer\n\nAn escaped criminal attempts to chisel Popeye, who is owner and operator of a pawn shop. Fisticuffs ensue.\n\nComments: The best part of this film is the talking painting. Really.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nCOOKIN' WITH GAGS\n\nReleased: Jan 14, 1955\n\nDirector: I.

Sparber\n\nStudio: Paramount / Famous Studios\n\nPopeye completely underestimates Olive's competance when she joins the police force.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nTHE CRYSTAL BRAWL\n\nReleased: Apr 5, 1957\n\nDirector: Seymour Kneitel\n\nStudio: Paramount / Famous Studios\n\nPopeye poses as a fortune-teller to show Olive how badly Bluto has always treated her.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nCUSTOMERS WANTED\n\nReleased: Jan 27, 1939\n\nStudio: Max Fleischer\n\nPopeye and Bluto vie for Wimpy's patronage at their penny arcades.\n\nComments: As usual, Wimpy is the world's worst customer--but as usual, nobody seems to care. This film is mostly a front to show clips from earlier films. The end is worth it, however.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nTHE DANCE CONTEST\n\nReleased: Nov 23, 1934\n\nStudio: Max Fleischer\n\nOlive and Popeye join a dance contest (judged by Wimpy), and Bluto, apparently going stag, attempts to take over as Olive's partner.\n\nComments: Gee, I never would have guessed that spinach would make someone a better dancer. Oh and, Wimpy should never be made judge of anything. Look for a 'hidden Betty Boop' in this one.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nDIZZY DIVERS\n\nReleased: Jul 26, 1935\n\nStudio: Max Fleischer\n\nPopeye and Bluto are deep sea divers.

But how can Popeye's broken-down jalopy ever win out against Noah's souped-up convertible?\n\nComments: I think the best part about this ep is Noah's tendancy to call Popeye 'Papaya.' By the way, why didn't anyone bother to tell that poor highway patrolman about the race?\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nFARMER AND THE BELLE\n\nReleased: Dec 1, 1950\n\nDirector: Seymour Kneitel\n\nStudio: Paramount / Famous Studios\n\nOlive needs a new farmhand and, well, I'm sure you know what two guys show up to apply.\n\nComments: Another show of strength between the two sailors.

Sparber\n\nStudio: Paramount / Famous Studios\n\nPopeye and Bluto respond to Olive's request to fix a leak; but when Popeye does a better job, Bluto turns to sabotage.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nTHE FLY'S LAST FLIGHT\n\nReleased: Dec 23, 1949\n\nDirector: Seymour Kneitel\n\nPopeye can't get any sleep due to the noises outside, but inside's no better, thanks to a pesky fly.\n\nComments: Hm, reminds me of my neighborhood.

But Bluto would like to see the bird expire.\n\nComments: I never knew Olive to be such a fainter. Anyways, I like the parrot's little song. Wish my parrot could sing it.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nFRIEND OR PHONY\n\nReleased: Jun 30, 1952\n\nDirector: I. Sparber\n\nStudio: Paramount / Famous Studios\n\nBluto fakes dying from one of Popeye's pummellings, and tries to convince the other sailor to give up spinach for good.\n\nComments: Popeye's a sap, isn't he?

Popeye's mutterings in this ep are great.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nGOPHER SPINACH\n\nReleased: Dec 10, 1954\n\nDirector: Seymour Kneitel\n\nStudio: Paramount / Famous Studios\n\nA gopher invades Popeye's spinach bed.\n\nComments: You know, it's kinda creepy when you realize Popeye's pampering these spinach plants like human babies just so he can eat them. Anyways, here is another 'small animal gets the better of Popeye' story. It shocked me to see a mad-enough-to-kill Popeye chasing the cute little gopher with a loaded rifle. Not one of the better eps, IMHO.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nGREEK MIRTHOLOGY\n\nReleased: Aug 13, 1954\n\nDirector: Seymour Kneitel\n\nStudio: Paramount / Famous Studios\n\nPopeye tells his nephews about their ancestor, Hercules, who used to get his strength from sniffing garlic...until something better came along.\n\nComments: I like spinach but but I'm with the boys on this one.

But Popeye makes the mistake of bringing a despondant Shorty along.\n\nComments: In my opinion this is one of the funniest Popeye cartoons. I mean, the end alone. Also great is the Bob Hope gag. Shorty's awesome.\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nHELLO, HOW AM I\n\nReleased: Jul 14, 1939\n\nStudio: Max Fleischer\n\nPopeye is invited over to Olive's house for a hamburger dinner, but Wimpy gets there first - dressed like the sailor! How long can this masquerade go on?\n\nComments: Amazing what a corset and a Hallowe'en mask can do, isn't it? My absolute favorite Popeye film ever, the one that made me a true fan of the early cartoons. Wimpy's a clever cuss. I would walk around for days squeaking \"I'm Popeye!\" after seeing this film as a kid. And my brother (bless 'im) would reply, \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself for looking like Popeye!\"\n\nWhat the Internet Movie Database Has To Say\n\nHER HONOR THE MARE\n\nReleased: Nov 26, 1943\n\nDirector: I.
