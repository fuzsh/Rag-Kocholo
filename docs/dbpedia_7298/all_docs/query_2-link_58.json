        "text": "The second annual presentation of Studio Sound—a performance series that champions artists and musicians whose work engages new possibilities for sound and music—premieres If you unfolded us, a new opera by interdisciplinary artist and writer Sable Elyse Smith, in collaboration with composer David Dominique and vocalist Freddie June.\n\nIf you unfolded us is an immersive multimedia work, for two voices (Freddie June and S T A R R Busby) and an eight-piece ensemble, comprising a series of songs that weave together an unfolding love story between two Black women and the protagonist’s journey of self-discovery. Dominique’s score fuses traditional and popular musical forms, with influences ranging from R&B and jazz to musique concrète and contemporary chamber music. Set against the backdrop of a developing storm, the performance explores the political, collective, and dramatic potential of the voice, as well as the ways in which language dissolves through sonic expression.\n\nSmith has written the libretto and created video for the performance. Taking a cinematic approach, she combines found footage with imagery from the performers’ interior worlds. In addition to the live performances, during the hours listed below the Studio transforms into a multimedia installation, featuring the work’s video and sound.\n\nPerformance schedule:\n\nWednesday, July 10, 8 pm\n\nThursday, July 11, 8 pm\n\nSaturday, July 13, 3 pm\n\nSaturday, July 13, 8 pm\n\nSunday, July 14, 3 pm\n\nVideo viewing schedule:\n\nWednesday, July 3 – Sunday, July 7, 10:30 am – 5:30 pm\n\nWednesday, July 10 – Thursday, July 11, 10:30 am – 5:30 pm\n\nFriday, July 12, 10:30 am – 5:30 pm\n\nSaturday, July 13, 10:30 am – 12 pm\n\n*Sunday, July 14, 10:30 am – 12 pm\n\n*The matinee performance on Sunday, July 14, will be followed by a conversation between the artists and Martha Joseph of Media and Performance.\n\nImage: Portrait of Shala Miller, lead vocalist in Sable Elyse Smith’s If you unfolded us, 2024.

A former athlete, Barney’s artistic projects often explore new ways of thinking about the body, utilizing custom prosthetics, elaborate costuming, and unconventional materials to produce avant-garde narratives and imagery. The Cremaster Cycle is a five-film anthology, shot out of order, that has spawned accompanying works in sculpture, photography, and installation. Barney’s filmic narratives move beyond biology to explore creation through other disciplines—from mythology to geology—yet often return to the stage of development before sexual differentiation, a moment in which all outcomes are possible.\n\nJoin the American Cinematheque for a screening series presenting all of the works in The Cremaster Cycle, and visit Barney’s newest film and installation, SECONDARY: commencement, on view at Regen Projects through August 17, 2024.\n\nImage: Production still from Matthew Barney, CREMASTER 5, 1997. 35 mm film (color video transferred to film with Dolby SR sound), running time: 54 minutes, 30 seconds. © 1997 Matthew Barney, Photo: Michael James O’Brien\n\nRegen Projects is pleased to announce representation of New York-based artist Aliza Nisenbaum. The artist will present new work at Art Basel this June and debut her first exhibition with the gallery on September 12, 2024.\n\nOn the occasion of the announcement, Shaun Caley Regen stated:\n\n“I first encountered Aliza Nisenbaum’s work at the 2017 Whitney Biennial, and through a mutual friend we arranged to meet for the first time that year, I was quite intrigued by the figurative nature of the work, how it engaged in social practice, and celebrated often less visible communities. Aliza and I stayed in touch, and finally, in March of 2020, I was able to visit her in a temporary studio in Los Angeles where she had just completed the most stunning portrait of a salsa dancer. Everything from the colors to the composition were magnificent, as though Aliza’s love and care for her subject exalted her in the most caring and profound way. Of course, this was the beginning of Covid and the quarantine, but also the beginning of a great dialogue with Aliza about her continuing search for sincere connections to the world around us. Aliza is a generous and thoughtful humanist, and a very diligent painter. I am thrilled that Regen Projects will be representing her.”\n\nClick here to read the full announcement.\n\nImage: Aliza Nisenbaum, Pedacito de Sol (Vero y Marissa), 2022.

The artist will debut her first exhibition with the gallery from March 16 – May 18, 2024.\n\n“I am so thrilled Regen Projects will be working with Alberta Whittle,” Shaun Caley Regen said. “I was lucky to meet her in Glasgow in 2022, and her warmth, intelligence, and vision for her work were immediately palpable. Likewise, when I first saw Alberta's paintings I was taken by their remarkable newness. They are joyous, dynamic, and ebullient in their embrace of craft, folklore, and heritage. There is a freedom in her practice in all the media she embraces, that sends a message of hope amongst the harsh realities of our times, in particular legacies of racism, colonialism, and patriarchy worldwide. Alberta parses all of this and unravels it beautifully, offering an alternative vision and paths to navigate this moment.”\n\nClick here to read the press release for Learning a new punctuation for hope in times of disaster, which presents a suite of new paintings and sculptural works by Whittle, as well as the North American debut of Lagareh – The Last Born, 2022.\n\nImage: Still from Alberta Whittle, Lagareh – The Last Born, 2022.

Morris will present her first exhibition with the gallery in 2025.\n\nSpeaking in relation to the announcement Shaun Caley Regen said, “We are thrilled to be working with Rebecca Morris. I first encountered her work in Made in L.A. 2016 at the Hammer Museum, curated by Aram Moshayedi and Hamza Walker. And more recently in her breathtaking monographic survey at the ICA LA curated by Jamillah James. Rebecca is a master of abstraction with a mature and honed painterly vocabulary. The idiosyncratic dexterity and rigorous approach to her work places her front and center in the current dialogue around abstract painting. It’s exciting to welcome this extraordinary, brilliant, and essential artist into our program. I look forward to her survey exhibition opening at the MCA Chicago in the fall, and to our first exhibition with Rebecca in 2025.”\n\nClick here to read the full announcement.\n\nImage: Rebecca Morris, Untitled (#10-20), 2020.

Techno-futurisms, for example, might provide quick fixes to pressing issues, while allowing the structural conditions causing such issues to remain in place. Speculative futurisms are often oriented toward the grandiose nature of what-could-be yet might be too removed from the present to effect meaningful change. This panel invites a discussion of other kinds of alternative or nonlinear temporalities of becoming, including many Indigenous cultures that view the past, present, and future as occurring simultaneously, one temporal moment existing in close relation with the others. How might a reorientation toward that which-has-been and that-which-is provide equal, if not more insightful, approaches toward considering just environmental futures for the Pacific Ocean? What new and ancestral insights can artistic and curatorial engagements with these questions produce?\n\nPlease email Ziying Duan at zduan@ocma.art to RSVP.\n\nCATASTERISM, a new film by Matthew Barney and Jonathan Bepler, will be presented as a streaming premiere during Art Basel. CATASTERISM was written and directed by Matthew Barney with music written and directed by Jonathan Bepler. The film will go live internationally on June 12 at 2 pm CET / 8 am ET / 5 am PT and will only be available for two weeks on www.catasterism.net, until June 26, 2022.\n\nIn September 2021, Barney and Bepler presented a live performance at Schaulager, titled Catasterism in Three Movements. This collaboration featured a large-scale symphonic composition by Bepler, performed by the Basel Sinfonietta with conductor Jack Sheen; and choreography developed by Barney with dance artists K.J. Holmes and Sandra Lamouche. CATASTERISM draws from documentation of those performances witnessed by a live audience and expands the narrative with cinematic scenes filmed in the galleries and workspaces of Schaulager. The film elaborates on the characters’ private rituals and deploys forensic examinations of artworks within Schaulager to evoke connections between the material qualities of art objects and the ephemeral qualities of the music. With musicians moving through and inhabiting the building in varying locations an d configurations, Schaulager's iconic architecture becomes a monumental acoustic body, as well as an almost ceremonial stage for performers. The project continues Barney’s and Bepler’s long history of collaborative projects with distinguished musicians in experimental and unconventional settings.\n\nRegen Projects, Lisson Gallery, Marian Goodman, and 303 Gallery today mourn a great artist, Dan Graham, who sadly died this weekend in New York. His influence over the past half century as a writer, photographer, architect, sculptor, filmmaker, and performance artist is widely felt in the contemporary art world, with many of his groundbreaking endeavours in video, installation, and audience participation—including such legendary and confrontational works as Performer/Audience/Mirror (1975) and Public Spaces/Two Audiences (1976)—among the first and most enduring examples ever created in those fields.\n\nDespite his recent disavowal of Conceptual Art as a term, he was one of its earliest pioneers through early text-based works, typographic wall pieces and schematic poems, not to mention the seminal illustrated magazine essay, Homes for America (1966). He exhibited the work of his peers Donald Judd, Sol LeWitt, and Robert Smithson at the John Daniels Gallery in New York, where he was briefly the curator and director, before showing alongside these and many other Minimalists and Conceptualists during the 1960s and 70s.\n\nThe main focus of Graham’s art since the late 1970s was an ongoing series of public architectural installations, which he called pavilions, derived from geometric forms and rendered in plate glass, two-way mirror, and steel armatures. Graham intended his pavilions to function as punctuation marks, pausing or altering the experience of physical space, providing momentary diversion for romance or play, or else as places to delve into other activities, like reading or viewing videos. These deceptively simple structures recall many of the artist’s earlier experiments with perception, reflection, and refraction, but depart from them in their non-gallery setting as long-term additions to the landscape.\n\nGraham had an encyclopedic sphere of references and wrote about everything from Dean Martin and rock music to astrology and urban architecture. He is survived by his wife, the artist Mieko Meguro. His wit, generosity, and irascibility will be sorely missed by all who knew him. Our deepest sympathies are with his family and friends.\n\nImage: Dan Graham with Slightly Curvaceous, 2012\n\nRegen Projects is pleased to participate in Art Basel from Friday, September 24 – Sunday, September 26, 2021.

Its influence can be found in film, video, art, media, commerce, theater, and more. Barney himself performs characters as diverse as a satyr, a magician, and even the infamous murderer Gary Gilmore. Filmed over eight years, from 1994 to 2002, the films themselves are a grandiose mixture of history, autobiography, and mythology, creating an intensely private universe where symbols and images are layered and interconnected. Created for the big screen only and unavailable for many years, Cremaster Cycle is a unique, must-see experience, guaranteed to leave you awestruck and mystified in a glorious way. ​\n\nPROGRAM\n\nMatthew Barney's Cremaster Cycle\n\nPicturehouse Central, London\n\nSaturday, July 17, 2021, 5 pm BST\n\nCremaster 4,1,5 & 2\n\n£15.20–17.20 | Tickets\n\nSunday, July 18, 2021, 4 pm BST\n\nCremaster 3\n\n£15.20–17.20 | Tickets\n\nSaturday, July 24, 2021, 5 pm BST\n\nCremaster 4,1,5 & 2\n\n£15.20–17.20 | Tickets\n\nSunday, July 25, 2021, 4 pm BST\n\nCremaster 3\n\n£15.20–17.20 | Tickets\n\nImage: Production still of CREMASTER 1, 1995.

Throughout the work four decolonial thinkers and activists—among whom Marboeuf—share thoughts around the subject of the individual and collective racialized body. The exchange pivots around a concrete, devastating instance of racially motivated police aggression where a young man of Congolese descent, Théo Luhaka, was assaulted by police officers following a race-based identity check in a Parisian banlieue in 2017. Weaved through personal recollections, philosophical perspectives, and sociological scrutiny, there emerges an unambiguous account of present-day police brutality and institutional racism. This powerful testimony of systemic oppression of Black lives draws a straight line from historical colonialism into the present and throws into crisis the self-congratulatory western narrative of progress and reason that has led to contemporary democracy with its supposed all-encompassing equity.\n\nTickets\n\nRegular ticket: €4*\n\nStudent ticket: €2\n\nSolidarity ticket*: free\n\nThis is an online program, accessible via Zoom and bakonline.org.

The 12th Berlin Biennale takes place in 2022.\n\nFor over two decades, Kader Attia has worked with the concept of “repair” in his artistic practice. It allows him to investigate the dialectic between destruction and repair, in which repair is understood as a way of cultural resistance as well as a means for a society or a subject to reappropriate their history and identity. Raised in France and Algeria, Kader Attia studied philosophy and art in Paris and Barcelona; today he lives and works in Berlin and Paris. In 2016, Kader Attia founded La Colonie in Paris’ 10th arrondissement as a space for the exchange of ideas and discussions focusing on decolonization, not only of people but also of knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Driven by the urgency of social and cultural reparation, it aims to reunite what has drifted apart or been broken. Since March 2020, La Colonie has been closed to the public due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In March 2021, the Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin hosts the fourth part of a conference series initiated by Kader Attia, Ana Teixeira Pinto, and Giovanna Zapperi entitled The White West.\n\nDirector Gabriele Horn and the team of the Berlin Biennale warmly welcome Kader Attia.\n\nPhoto: F. Anthea Schaap\n\nMutina for Art is pleased to announce that the This Is Not a Prize 2020 award has been assigned to artist Silke Otto-Knapp (Osnabrueck, 1970).\n\nThis Is Not a Prize is not just an annual award but also Mutina’s commitment to support a future project of the selected artist: from an exhibition to a collaboration with an international institution, a publication or the production of a new artwork.\n\nSilke Otto-Knapp has been selected by the Mutina team, by its CEO Massimo Orsini and by the curator of Mutina for Art Sarah Cosulich, following a consideration on the importance and visibility that painting has recently reacquired. This year This Is Not a Prize wishes to recognize an international protagonist like Otto-Kapp, who with painting has brought forward in time an excellent and coherent path of great historical-artistic relevance. Despite belonging to the mid-generation, Silke Otto-Knapp can already be defined an “artists’ artist” for her reference role both on the level of practice and expression as well as of language and conceptual research.\n\nPhoto: Sharon Lockhart\n\nUPDATE: It gives us great pleasure to share that in just under one week we successfully met our goal of matching $20,000 in contributions to organizations mobilizing for racial justice and equality. We extend our sincerest thanks to all those who graciously donated to the campaign. Together, we were able to raise more than $40,000 to help support the organizations listed below. The effort to combat racial and social injustice continues. We encourage others to keep lending time and resources to these and other valuable causes, and we will do the same.\n\nRegen Projects stands in solidarity with our friends and colleagues around the country and the world who are calling out systemic racism, social and economic inequality, police brutality, and anti-black violence, as well as the horrific killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, Mychael Johnson, Nina Pop, Monika Diamond, and countless others. We are truly inspired by the many individuals and organizations both locally and nationally who have come together in this turbulent and important time to enact change.\n\nIn support of their efforts we are proud to match up to $20,000 of $100 donations to organizations helping to combat police violence, reduce incarceration, distribute resources, and bolster community organizing impacting the welfare of black and brown lives. Together we can double our impact – Please consider donating time and money to the organizations listed below, and send your receipts to us at office@regenprojects.com.\n\nACLU\n\nBlack Lives Matter LA\n\nBlack Trans Advocacy Coalition\n\nBlack Visions Collective\n\nEqual Justice Initiative\n\nNAACP Legal Defense Fund\n\nNational Bail Out\n\nRebuild Foundation\n\nSouthern Poverty Law Center\n\nSummaeverythang Community Center\n\nUnderground Museum\n\nImage: Gary Simmons, Time 4 Sum Aksion, 1993.\n\nTheaster Gates is featured in FIRSTHAND, a documentary series from WTTW Chicago which explores the personal, firsthand perspectives of Chicago residents whose lives have been affected by coronavirus. Gates talks about the pleasure as well as the hardship of working in isolation and discusses how he came to team up with the denim label Citizens of Humanity to create 1,000 masks for the Chicago Food Depository: ‘When it became evident that this virus was going to have a significant impact, it meant that I would have to shift significantly how I work. And I knew that I wanted to spend a portion of that time being selfish and enjoying the isolation in a way … But the other part felt like I would have to also figure out how I could be of service, and the service part was a bit more complicated.’ Watch the video at the link below.\n\nDear Friends,\n\nRegen Projects is committed to the health and well-being of our artists, staff, and community. In response to the developing concerns regarding COVID-19, and in keeping with current local and state government recommendations to proactively prevent spreading the virus, the gallery will temporarily be open by-appointment-only beginning Saturday, March 14, 2020. We are working remotely and will see to daily operations as well as continue to be available to assist our audience with any needs it may have.\n\nOur current exhibitions, Catherine Opie: Rhetorical Landscapes and Lawrence Weiner: ON VIEW, will be extended through Saturday, May 2. Our scheduled April exhibition, Kader Attia: The Valley of Dreams will be postponed until the fall. To make an appointment please contact us by phone at +1 310 276 5424 or email us at office@regenprojects.com.\n\nDuring this temporary closure please know that we are closely monitoring the situation and look forward to being in touch soon with an update regarding our normal business hours. In the interim, please continue to engage with us on social media and our website. We strongly hope and believe that taking these preventative measures now will help alleviate this health threat for our community.\n\nWe sincerely thank you for your support, and wish you and yours safety and health in this challenging time.\n\nOur best wishes,\n\nRegen Projects\n\nMatthew Barney: Redoubt\n\nNuart Theatre\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nJanuary 24 – January 30\n\nDaily screenings: 2:20 pm | 5:10 pm | 8 pm\n\nTickets\n\nAn artist Q&A follows the 8 pm screening on Friday, January 24. Tickets available here.\n\nRegen Projects is pleased to announce the Los Angeles premiere of Matthew Barney's new film, Redoubt. The film will screen at the Nuart Theatre from January 24 – 30, 2020. In addition, the artist will be joined by writer Maggie Nelson for a Q&A following the 8 pm screening of the film on January 24. For tickets and information, follow the link below.\n\nRedoubt loosely adapts the classical myth of Diana, goddess of the hunt and of nature, and Actaeon, a hunter who trespasses on her privacy and is punished. The first new film in several years by internationally acclaimed artist, writer and director Matthew Barney unfolds as a series of hunts in the rugged wilderness of Idaho’s spectacular Sawtooth Mountains. Anette Wachter, a real champion sharpshooter, is cast as Diana, and the director himself plays a grizzled mountain man known as The Engraver. The characters communicate a mythological narrative through dance, letting movement replace language as they pursue each other and their prey. By layering classical myths, cosmological myths, and American myths about humanity’s place in the natural world, the film creates a complex portrait of the American landscape.

Join the artist for an opening-day Q&A following the 6:50 pm screening.\n\nFrom the boundlessly fertile/febrile imagination of Matthew Barney, creator of the epic CREMASTER cycle. In REDOUBT, the myth of Diana and Actaeon unfolds in Idaho’s majestic Sawtooth Mountains, with Diana played by real-life sharpshooter Anette Wachter. She’s accompanied by two nymphs on a wolf hunt (one, Eleanor Bauer, choreographed the film’s gravity-defying movements); Barney is the Engraver/forest ranger – stealthily etching their movements onto copper plates. Wordless physical action, choreography and spectacular cinematography create a dreamlike logic. The title REDOUBT can refer to both a provisional military fortification, and a defensive, isolated psychological position – both evoked by the film’s setting in a vast Idaho wilderness. “Mr. Barney’s most engrossing film in over a decade… speaks directly to contemporary American themes: the place of the gun, the fate of the environment and the fantasies and paranoias of those who turn their back on constitutional government and American society” (Jason Farago, The New York Times).

A full-scale bar, originally sculpted from petroleum jelly, has been transformed into a monumental sculpture in cast plastic. ‘CREMASTER 3,’ the fifth and final part of Barney’s ‘CREMASTER Cycle,’ is set primarily in 1930s New York during the construction of the Chrysler Building. Many laborers who worked on the building were Irish immigrants and Freemasons, and the film’s iconography is informed by masonic rites and Irish folklore. ‘Partition’ marries the form of a traditional Irish bar with that of a plumb level, one of the principal symbolic tools of freemasonry. The original sculpture, with its jelly surface modeled around a refrigerated armature, existed in a state of indefinite suspension, poised on the brink of collapse. Here, Barney allowed the latent disintegration to begin, before casting the bar in plastic. The sculpture lists to one side, a reference to the metaphorical implications of the plumb level for freemasons. Overlaying the dense symbolism of the film with equally complex material transformations, ‘Partition’ evinces the breadth of Barney’s sculptural language. Photo: Andrea Rossetti\n\nLast year an image of my work 'Cloud Gate' (in Millennium Park Chicago) was used without my consent in a politicised advertisement for the National Rifle Association (NRA), entitled 'The Clenched Fist of Truth.' The NRA’s ‘advertisement’ – as they describe the video on their own website – seeks to whip up fear and hate. It plays to the basest and most primal impulses of paranoia, conflict and violence, and uses them in an effort to create a schism to justify its most regressive attitudes. Hidden here is a need to believe in a threatening ‘Other’ different from ourselves. I am disgusted to see my work – in truth the sculpture of the people of Chicago – used by the NRA to promote their vile message. Recent shootings in Florida, Las Vegas, Texas, and a number of other towns and cities, make it more urgent that ever that this organization is held to account for its ongoing campaign of fear and hate in American society.\n\n'Cloud Gate' reflects the space around it, the city of Chicago. People visit the sculpture to get married, to meet friends, to take selfies, to dance, to jump, to engage in communal experience. Its mirrored form is engulfing and intimate. It gathers the viewer into itself. This experience, judging by the number of people that visit it every day (two-hundred million to date), still seems to carry the potential to communicate a sense of wonder. A mirror of self and other, both private and collective, 'Cloud Gate' – or the ‘Bean’ as it often affectionately referred to — is an inclusive work that engages public participation. Its success has little to do with me, but rather with the thousands of residents and visitors who have adopted it and embraced it as their 'Bean.' 'Cloud Gate' has become a democratic object in a space that is free and open to all.\n\nThe NRA's nightmarish, intolerant, divisive vision perverts everything that 'Cloud Gate' – and America – stands for. Art must stand clear in its mission to recognise the dignity and humanity of all, irrespective of creed or racial origin.\n\nGun violence in the United States affects every citizen of your country – all religions, all cultures, all ages. The NRA’s continued defence of the gun industry makes them complicit in compromising the safety of the many in favour of corporate profit.

Working with color, “hands on” as it were, required a familiarity with trichromacity, the mechanism whereby organisms (and devices) deploy red, green, and blue receptors (or elements in mechanical reproduction) in the eye to mediate the visual world.\n\nAs I moved beyond a simple understanding of how the eye and film register color, I became drawn to what Goethe calls, in his Theory of Colors, “pathological color.” This intuition lead me to diverge from normative, one to one reproductive color matching and to look closely at 1960’s multichannel color experiments, ranging from Andy Warhol’s silkscreen paintings to Richard Avedon’s psychedelic portraits of the Beatles.\n\nI began my pathological color images in 2006-2010 using Philip Johnson’s Glass House and Pierre Chareau’s Maison de Verre as armatures for my initial color experiments using colored gels. (I have long been interested in photographing architecture and landscape. In the mid 1980’s I photographed H. H. Richardson buildings and railroad landscapes.) In 2014 I moved to multichannel inkjet prints with layered color channels combining photographs of contemporary dance, landscape, and Brutalist architecture.\"\n\nAnyone requiring accessibility accommodations should contact the events office at (617) 496-2414 or events@gsd.harvard.edu.\n\nHigh Desert Test Sites 2017, curated by Aram Moshayedi and Sohrab Mohebbi, opens this weekend, October 21-22!\n\nThis year’s iteration is built around An Ephemeral History of High Desert Test Sites: 2002-2015, a month-long exhibition focused on the project’s history. In addition, a pseudo-symposium titled The Palm Talks compliments the exhibition with live music and presentations on the topic of non-communities.\n\nThe Palm Talks includes both local and non-local contemporary thinkers, historians, writers, and artists, whose contributions culminate in a momentary glimpse into our collective state. Set within the context of the legendary Palms Restaurant in Wonder Valley and presented with live musical accompaniment by M. Cay Castagnetto and The Renderers, there will be a negotiation between language and sound, noise and meaning, music and speech. Participants in The Palm Talks include Fiona Connor, Trinie Dalton, Gary Dauphin, Steve Kado, Alexander Keefe, Nancy Klein, Annelies Kuiper, Cailin O'Connor, Litia Perta, Linda Sibio, Laura Sibley, Bobby Jesus and Frances Stark, Sam Thorne, James Owen Weatherall, Aurora Tang, and others.\n\nAn Ephemeral History of High Desert Test Sites presents an incomplete and partial look at the organization’s fifteen-year history, based on the artifacts, ephemera, and facsimiles that have been recovered by High Desert Test Sites and past participating artists. It has prompted a desire to document the organization’s history, to create a living archive of contributions that were otherwise ephemeral and temporary, and to observe the narrative of the gathered material in order to tell the story of the organization, the vast community of artists involved, and the landscape that has witnessed these activities.\n\nHigh Desert Test Sites 2017 is complimented by new projects and contributions by Fiona Connor, Bob Dornberger and Sarah Witt, Neil Doshi, Edie Fake, Glenn-Murray & Co., Oliver Payne, Carolyn Pennypacker Riggs, and Ry Rocklen.\n\nA publication for the exhibition will be available as part of the Saturday, October 21 edition of the Hi-Desert Star, a local newspaper that has served the community since 1957.\n\nHigh Desert Test Sites 2017 is curated by Sohrab Mohebbi and Aram Moshayedi, with Tatiana Vahan, Elena Yu, Vanesa Zendejas, and Andrea Zittel.\n\nFebruary 25 - October 31, 2017\n\nPalm Springs, California\n\nwww.dougaitkenmirage.com\n\nMIRAGE is a site-specific installation set in the Southern California desert. Utilizing the form of a ranch style suburban American house, the sculpture is composed of reflective mirrored surfaces. MIRAGE distills the recognizable and repetitious suburban home into the essence of its lines, reflecting, and disappearing into the vast western landscape. Opening February 25, 2017 as a part of Desert X, a site-specific contemporary art exhibition curated by Artistic Director Neville Wakefield, MIRAGE will remain on view after the exhibition closes through October 31, 2017.\n\nMovement was the driving force behind the settling of the American West, and the long flat vistas that stretched toward the Pacific shaped the ideology behind this iconic embodiment of American architecture. The California Ranch Style, which is unique to the West, was informed by the ideas of architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who believed that architecture should be both in and of the landscape. In the 1920s and ‘30s a small inspired group of architects working in California and the West created the first suburban ranch style houses, fusing Wright’s fluid treatment of spaces with the simple one-story homes built by ranchers. After World War II, the ranch style’s streamlined simplicity gained popularity and commercial builders employed a simplified assembly line approach to create this efficient form, matching the rapid growth of the suburbs. The mass-produced ranch home became a familiar sight across the country, the style filling the American landscape as quickly as each new subdivision was built.\n\nMIRAGE is reconfigured as an architectural idea, the seemingly generic suburban home now devoid of a narrative, its inhabitants, their possessions. This minimal structure now functions entirely in response to the landscape around it. The doors, windows, and openings have been removed to create a fluid relationship with the surrounding environment. Situated at the juncture where the rugged San Jacinto mountain range gives way to the Coachella valley, MIRAGE is perched over a distant modern development that fades into the open desert. As MIRAGE pulls the landscape in and reflects it back out, its familiar architectural form becomes a framing device, a visual echo-chamber endlessly reflecting both the dream of nature as a pure uninhabited state and the pursuit of its conquest. Its mirrored surfaces form a life- size kaleidoscope that absorbs and reflects the landscape. Subject and object, interior and exterior, the psychological and physical; each of these oppositional forces are held in constant tension, yet allowed to shift and transform in the ever-changing desertscape.\n\nLike a human-scale lens, MIRAGE works to frame and distort the evolving world outside of it. There is no single time to view this work, as each variation provides something new: at night the distant lights refract to create a universe of stars; on a tranquil afternoon the sky is transformed into banks of blue fragmented by slices of clouds. As there is no fixed perspective or correct interpretation, each experience of this living artwork will be unique.\n\nDoug Aitken (b. 1968) is an American artist and filmmaker whose work explores every medium, from sculpture, film, and installation to architectural intervention. His work has been featured in exhibitions around the world at institutions including the Whitney Museum of American Art, The Museum of Modern Art, Vienna Secession, the Serpentine Gallery in London, and the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. Aitken earned the International Prize at the Venice Biennale in 1999 for the installation electric earth. He also received the 2012 Nam June Paik Art Center Prize and the 2013 Smithsonian American Ingenuity Award: Visual Arts. He lives and works in Los Angeles, California.\n\nDriving from Los Angeles\n\nTake the I-10 East to Highway 111 (Palm Springs exit): Remain on Highway 111 for approximately 11 miles (it will become North Palm Canyon Drive).

Whilst editing the footage with Michael Amstad in Berlin, it became clear, that what was planned to be cut into six individual videos, should not be separated, but should remain as a consecutive sequence of six different moods.\n\nExplaining the motivations behind the visual album Wolfgang Tillmans says: \"Four songs have been written and recorded this summer in Fire Island and New York, in a time now marked as 'post Brexit / pre Trump'. New Jersey’s Ash B.’s performance and improvised rap on That’s Desire blew us away. The song was recorded in 30 minutes. Two vocal takes by myself, one by Ash B. That was it. Warm Star was written and recorded in Porto in January this year. Principally a love song with political undertones, some lines of the lyrics later made it onto my pro EU / anti Brexit campaign posters. Fast Lane is a recording from 1986, myself 17 years old, an electro-punk piece inspired by cold war angst and nausea at political indifference with the now more than ever poignant line ‘we take the fast lane into the dark’. I wanted the overall feel of the EP to be reflecting the desire to carry on and live our lives in a quest for personal happiness, whatever the circumstances are. We need to protest and campaign, but this shouldn’t stop us from reaffirming love and life, here and now. Anderes Osterlied is a song written by Swiss liberation theologian Kurt Marti in 1970. Even though I find it hard to believe in organised religion, I was and am deeply touched by this song ever since I first heard it in the early 90ies. Here We Are is about a moment of personal love and Naive Me is about the shock of realising the unimaginable happened on June 23 / Nov 8\"\n\n\"I’m grateful for the trust and openess each dancer, actor, performer brought to this project, - giving everything in a white blank space to the sound of a boombox. A set of coloured gels in front of the window being the only production props”\n\nThe accompanying EP will be out on Friday Dec 9 on 12” vinyl as well as digital download, distributed by WordandSound on Beatport, Traxsource, Juno, iTunes and other download sites. Streaming from Dec 9 on Spotify, Soundcloud and iTunes.\n\nUnderwater Pavilions is artist Doug Aitken’s most recent large-scale installation and will be installed this fall off the coast of Southern California on Catalina Island 22 miles from Los Angeles. Produced by Parley for the Oceans and presented in partnership with The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA), the work consists of three temporary underwater sculptures, floating beneath the ocean’s surface that swimmers, snorkelers, and scuba divers can swim through and experience. Geometric in design, the sculptures create underwater spaces synthesizing art and science as they are constructed with carefully researched materials and will be moored to the ocean floor. Part of each sculpture is mirrored to reflect the underwater seascape and create a kaleidoscopic observatory for the viewer, while other surfaces are rough and rock-like. The environments created in and by the sculptures will constantly change with the currents and the time of day, focusing the attention of the viewer on the rhythm of the ocean and its life cycles.\n\nUnderwater Pavilions engages the living ocean ecosystem as the viewer swims into and through the sculptures, which create huge reflective abstractions. The work operates as an observatory for ocean life, creating a variety of converging perceptual encounters. The sculptures will continuously change due to the natural and manmade conditions of the ocean, creating a living presence and unique relationship with the viewer. Both aesthetic and scientific, Underwater Pavilions puts the local marine environment and the global challenges around ocean conservation in dialogue with the history of art, inviting the viewer to write a contemporary narrative of the ocean and to participate in its protection.\n\nParley for the Oceans, Doug Aitken Workshop, and MOCA will launch Doug Aitken: Underwater Pavilions in tandem with the exhibition Doug Aitken: Electric Earth at The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA. The installation will be a cultural destination that is free and open to the public in the Casino Point Dive Park in the City of Avalon. The nearby Catalina Casino will also be activated for the New Ocean Happening, a special weekend event organized by Aitken that will include screenings, talks, and live performances, all geared toward bringing attention to critical issues in ocean conservation.\n\nCatalina Island is a one-hour ferry ride from several major ports and it was selected as the location for this earthwork in light of its historical and ecological importance, the beauty of its landscape, and its close proximity to Los Angeles. With its clear waters teeming with flying fish and bright orange Garibaldi, alongside nearby shipwrecks, the location makes for spectacular diving and snorkeling.\n\nIn September 2016, a major survey of Doug Aitken’s work will open at The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA). Presented in conjunction with this exhibition, the Underwater Pavilions will be a point of convergence for art, education, and culture within California.\n\nDoug Aitken (b. 1968) is an American artist and filmmaker whose work explores every medium, from sculpture, film, and installation to architectural intervention.

This is one thing which cannot be exaggerated.”\n\n“We are at war with the oceans. If we win, we lose it all. Art has the power to direct all eyes on the oceans, in the oceans, and make its protection a creative collaboration,” remarks Parley for the Oceans Founder Cyrill Gutsch.\n\nFurther information is available at www.underwaterpavilions.com.\n\nPlease join us for a fundraiser to celebrate High Desert Test Sites on Saturday, November 19 from 2-4PM. This year's limited edition print will feature work by Jack Pierson.\n\n\"As a part-time member of the community known as HDTS, I've had the privilege of being involved almost from its inception. It's an ambitious and inspiring project with many inroads and possibilities. What they have created in this extreme environment is a leap in the direction of the sublime. I am very happy to participate with this print of a new image. A road going towards HDTS. It's all happening over that mountain. Go now...\" –Jack Pierson\n\n\"Jack and I first met when we were both living in New York in the early 1990s. He had an exhibition at Pat Hearn Gallery where I was working as a gallery assistant, and there we formed a lasting friendship that led to him helping me start my own career. Then in 2000, an amazing coincidence occured where we both bought houses in the high desert, unbeknownst to each other. Being devoted to this region and a hugely generous human being, Jack has been involved in some way, shape, or form in nearly every HDTS event. One of my favorite works by Jack was a beautiful pink and white road sign covered in giant sequins that said \"NOTHING.\" The sign was stolen during our second event, and trying to locate it became fodder for many local myths, recounted at our favorite local roadside tavern The Palms.\" –Andrea Zittel\n\nJack Pierson\n\nOn the way there, 2016\n\nPigment print\n\n11.73 x 16.38 inches (29.8 x 41.6 cm)\n\nEdition of 25\n\n$1,500.00 (framed)\n\nFor more information or to purchase the edition, please contact Isha Welsh.\n\nTo RSVP for the event at Regen Projects, please contact Alexandra Weinress.\n\nHDTS Editions are offered to directly support High Desert Test Sites operations and programming, and to honor contemporary artists whose work embodies the non-profit's mission statement.

Titled \"placebo pets,\" supermodels Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid appear as super friendly, domesticated humanoid pets. Fitch/Trecartin see in our relationship to pets a parallel with our relationship to technology, in the way that we’ve been trained to adapt our behavior, our language, and the images we choose to present our changing selves. “There’s a certain power that animals have over us when they respond to us in unexpected, friendly ways,” says Trecartin. “And it’s really them domesticating us almost more than us domesticating them, because they’re training us to want them. Training and taming something is not one-sided. We created social media, but then it changed us because we interacted with it.\" Read more in an interview with Diane Solway.\n\nPlease join us to celebrate High Desert Test Sites Editions with a fundraiser on Saturday, November 21 from 2-4PM.\n\nThe inaugural limited-edition print will feature work by Shannon Ebner. Landscape Incarceration (HDTS Print Edition), 2015, revisits Shannon’s first project with High Desert Test Sites in 2003, in which she set up a series of oversize letters to create this image in the desert. The resulting photograph was originally printed as a newsprint edition, available to HDTS 3 attendees. Available framed in an edition of 10, the work will be sold for $1,400.00 each. Proceeds from the sale will go to support HDTS operations and programming.\n\nMichael Ned Holte writes, \"In Landscape Incarceration, the eponymous phrase is staged as a running barrier along the desert horizon. We view the letters from behind, cheap scaffolding and all. The disorientation slyly reflects the eroding border between private interiority and public exteriority. Ebner's language, whether borrowed or not, is quietly derived from private meaning but speaks volumes when placed in the imaginary, if wholly artificial, space of the public. In turn, her photographs bear witness to the construction of meaning itself, however ephemeral or involuntary.\"\n\nShannon Ebner\n\nLandscape Incarceration (HDTS Print Edition), 2015\n\nArchival pigment print on slickrock metallic\n\n11 x 14 inches\n\nEdition of 10\n\n$1,400.00 (framed)\n\nFor more information or to purchase the edition, please contact HDTS.\n\nTo RSVP for the event at Regen Projects, please contact Elly Hawley at +1 310 276 5424.\n\nHDTS Editions are offered to directly support High Desert Test Sites operations and programming, and to honor contemporary artists whose work embodies everything we believe in.

Here is a statement released by the artist.\n\n'Once again my work Dirty Corner has become a receptacle for the dirty politics of anti-semitic vandals, racists and right-wing royalists. The vandalised sculpture now looks like a graveyard, the stones are now gravestones marking the ruinous politics of fundamentalist bigotry. Dirty Corner allows this dirty politics to expose itself fully, in full view for all to see.\n\nAt this time, when we need to have compassion for the thousands of refugees on the road in Europe, the anti-Semitic, racist attack on Dirty Corner at Chateau de Versailles in Paris, brings to the forefront the intolerance and racism in our midst. Dirty Corner has become the vehicle for the expression of our anxiety of \"the other\" and emphasis that Art is a focus for our deepest longings and fears. It is urgent that we show our solidarity with the oppressed the down-trodden and those of our brothers and sisters in need.\n\nAs the artist I have -for the second time- to ask myself what this act of violence means to my work. the sculpture will now carry the scars of this renewed attack . I will not allow this act of violence and intolerance to be erased. Dirty Corner will now be marked with hate and I will preserve these scars as a memory of this painful history. I am determined that Art will triumph.' -- Anish Kapoor September 6, 2015"
