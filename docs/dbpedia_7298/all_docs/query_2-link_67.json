        "text": "Completed in 1896, this is the most ornate of the downtown churches. It combines pressed brick, brownstone and rough faced terra cotta. Features include a wheel window, stained glass windows and a huge corner bell tower. Patterned after St. Mark’s in Venice, the church is one of the first examples of the use of structural steel in an ecclesiastical building.\n\nThe church replaced the original St. John’s Church, which burned during the 1889 flood. the flood wave overturned dozens of houses that had coal stoves in their kitchens, and one of these crashed into the church with enough smoldering embers to ignite the structure above the water line. Latitude: 40.32538; Longitude: 78.91520\n\nThe only surviving downtown church that predates the 1889 Flood, the Franklin Street Methodist Church is famous for having split the flood wave, allowing several buildings on Main Street to avoid a direct hit. Latitude: 40.32567; Longitude: 78.91723\n\nBuilt in the Gothic Revival style, its design is credited to mill designer and inventor George Fritz. Constructed in 1869, the stone church has a steeply pitched roof, an 80-foot-tall corner spire, pointed arch window and door openings, buttresses and rose windows.\n\nThe Reverend Henry L. Chapman, the church’s pastor in 1889, was preparing his Sunday sermon when a B & O Railroad car floated by in front of the parsonage. He rushed his family to the attic. They watched as the row of frame houses down the street were whisked away by the flood waters. “Pale, frightened, and awestricken,” they waited through the long night, “expecting each moment to be swept away.”\n\nThe Chapman family survived mainly because their house stood close to the massive sandstone church, which took the brunt of the flood without a crack in its walls. The flood wave parted around the church, and continued on its path of destruction across town. Several other buildings that stood in its protection were still intact when the waters subsided.\n\nAlthough no damage was done to the exterior, the church suffered serious damage inside. Water broke through the windows and poured into the sanctuary some 18 feet deep, causing the floor to cave in, ruining the plaster, and destroying the choir gallery and numerous pews.\n\nLater, a Citizen’s Committee in charge of reconstruction ordered the church dynamited and cleared away. Fortunately, the commander in charge of relief troops, recognizing its significance in protecting lives and property, placed a guard around the church to save it until the committee reconsidered that decision.\n\nThe business center of the Cambria Iron Company’s empire, this office building is a survivor of the Johnstown Flood. Its two sections, built in 1881 and 1885, reflect the changing popularity of architectural styles. The oldest section (western) is Palladian with its symmetry, hip roof, stone belt course, and stone window surrounds. The later section (eastern) has a contrasting Queen Anne design with asymmetrical massing, large dormers, and brownstone details. The building was designed by Addison Hutton, a prominent Philadelphia architect.\n\nJohnstown was a company town in 1889. Some 7,000 men and women worked for Cambria Iron Company, and many of them rented one of the 700 company houses throughout the Conemaugh Valley. Groceries and supplies were purchased at the company store, and medical attention could be obtained at the company-financed hospital. Cambria Iron Company could afford such benevolence because at the time of the flood its holdings were well over $50 million.\n\nIn addition to being one of the world’s leading steel producers, the company owned many collateral interests. Among these were thousands of acres of mineral lands, 35 miles of railroad track and some 1,500 railroad cars. The company also held extensive real estate, such as a theater, a company executives’ club, shoe and furniture stores, wire, flour, and woolen mills, and several farms located on surrounding hillsides.\n\nThis general office building is one of the few structures on this street that survived the 1889 flood. However, it was the Iron Company’s large, three story department store that bore the brunt of the massive impact of the flood wave. The wave tore out an entire wall of the store but left the company’s office building intact. Latitude: 40.32812; Longitude: 78.92017\n\nThis French Gothic style library was designed by the Philadelphia architect Addison Hutton. The oldest public building in downtown Johnstown, the Cambria Free Library was built in 1892. The two and one-half story French Gothic design is distinguished by its steeply pitched hipped roof, pointed dormers, slate roof, narrow windows and battlements. (In the slider above, you’ll find a contemporary photo of the museum, an early 20th century postcard of the building, and an image of the pre-1889 library, which was destroyed in the flood. The new library was constructed on the same plot of land).\n\nThe building occupies the site of the former Cambria Library, which disappeared in the flood waters, along with its librarian. Four months after the devastating flood, Andrew Carnegie journeyed from Pittsburgh to visit the local steelworks and see the ruins of Johnstown. Carnegie donated the money to erect a new library on the same site. One of the nation’s richest men, he was better known in Johnstown as a member of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club. The club was responsible for the South Fork Dam, which gave way and sent 20 million tons of water rushing onto the city of Johnstown and the Conemaugh Valley.\n\nThe new building was similar to Johnstown’s first library, which had been financed by the Cambria Iron Company. Like its predecessor, the new Library contained 8,000 standard works and had spacious, comfortable reading rooms. Its large, first floor auditorium was used for town meetings. On the third floor there was a gymnasium which included a large exercise track made of padded leather. The library proper was on the second floor.\n\nIn 1973, the public library moved to a new building, and this structure became the Johnstown Flood Museum. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was restored in 1989. Latitude: 40.32788; Longitude: 78.92063\n\nErected in 1891, this Gothic Revival style church features a corner steeple, pointed arch windows and doorways, and battlement-like windows. It replaced an 1874 Episcopal Church that was destroyed by the Johnstown Flood, in which the pastor and his family died. The church bell and other items are relics from the original church.\n\nBut before the new church was constructed, the site was the location of one of the Red Cross hotels. Responding to her first major disaster since the founding of the American Red Cross in 1881, Clara Barton arrived in Johnstown on June 5, 1889, accompanied by fifty doctors and nurses. At age 67, Miss Barton had abundant energy and worked relentlessly for the relief of the valley’s survivors. The Red Cross directly served over 25,000 victims of the Johnstown Flood.\n\nHere, where St. Mark’s Episcopal Church now stands, the Red Cross built a hotel for “the wealthy, the elegant, the cultured leaders of society, and the fathers of the town.” After finding many of these men homeless and working long hours in the mud and rain to help in the grueling clean-up, Miss Barton reasoned: “As the salvation of the town depended in great measure upon the efforts of these men, it was vitally necessary that their lives should be preserved. . .”\n\nThe “Locust Street Red Cross Hotel” was constructed in fast order. On the outside, the hotel looked much like the large Red Cross warehouse only 50 yards away, but on the inside it was homelike and comfortable. It had hot and cold running water, gas heat, and furnishings donated by companies from far and near. (An image is included in the slider)\n\nThe Red Cross relief effort continued in the valley another two months. Clothing, medicine, furniture, and domestic supplies were freely distributed to all flood refugees. This was the first real test of the newly organized Red Cross. Latitude: 40.32692; Longitude: 78.91964\n\nConstructed in 1900 to replace an earlier municipal building on this site, City Hall is attributed to Walter R. Myton and Charles Robinson of Altoona. This landmark incorporates a Richardsonian Romanesque design with a central tower. Myton went on to design numerous residences, churches, stores, and schools in Johnstown.\n\nThe new City Hall held special significance for the community. Here one of the flood’s most beneficial changes to the town took place – the consolidation of many of the valley’s small boroughs into the City of Johnstown. Before the flood, each borough guarded its governing rights. The survivors of these small communities were united by the flood in a bond of common cause and grief. Rebuilding together made sense, and consolidation was approved by voters in on November 6, 1889.\n\nMarkers on the wall of City Hall show high water lines during Johnstown’s three worst floods. Flood control measures were taken after the 1936 disaster, yet in 1977, a “once in 500 years” storm caused a flood resulting in 85 deaths and $200 million in damage. Latitude: 40.32605; Longitude: 78.91958\n\nThis Presbyterian Church was dedicated in 1866, located midway along Johnstown’s principal business row. The pastor of the church, Reverend David J. Beale, lived in the new parsonage behind the church with his wife and children. The Beales, after the flood wave hit, climbed out over the wreckage and found refuge at Alma Hall. Both the church and the parsonage were spared. Although the church was still intact, it was greatly damaged inside by the water that submerged all its pews.\n\nFor weeks after the flood, the church served as one of the valley’s six temporary morgues. As bodies were found, they were brought to the church, where volunteer undertakers from Pittsburgh and other parts of the state embalmed them. Special care was taken to record any recognizable features. Clothing was also described to help survivors identify lost family members.\n\nMany of the dead were beyond recognition when they were pulled from under debris. Of the 2,209 total dead, 755 remained unidentified. These lie in a special memorial plot dedicated to the Unknown Flood Victims in Grandview Cemetery.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, this church was converted for use as a theater — first the Nemo and later the Embassy. The facade of the old church is incorporated into the Lincoln Center complex. Latitude: 40.32552; Longitude: 78.91932\n\nBuilt by the Independent Order of Odd Fellows in 1884, this Queen Anne style landmark is the oldest building constructed by a fraternal organization in the downtown district. It is still the headquarters for Alma Lodge 523 of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows (I.O.O.F.).\n\nShielded by the Methodist Episcopal Church, it survived the flood wave and gave refuge to 264 people during the night of May 31. This four story brick building was the tallest in Johnstown when constructed in 1884 in the Queen Anne style. Its decorative facade treatments include incised artwork on inset stone blocks, elliptical brick arches, and corbelled brickwork. Office space was rented out on the first and second floors. The third and fourth floors contained meeting halls.\n\nAfter the flood hit, the first floor was under water. Survivors from all over the valley were swept into the vicinity of the building. Many struggled over the wreckage, submerged in water 18 feet deep, and climbed into the Hall through second story windows. James M. Walters, a Johnstown lawyer, was thrown into his own office window when the rooftop he was on crashed into the building. While it was still light, some men in the Hall took a rope and went out on the wreckage to help rescue other survivors. Walters was elected as director of the building and along with three other men was placed in charge of the hundreds of people gathered on the second to fourth floors.\n\nWomen and children were made as comfortable as possible, and prayers were led by Reverend David Beale. Strict orders were given that no one was to turn on any of the gaslights, for fear that escaping gas might cause the building to explode.\n\nAlma Hall sheltered some 264 people during the night following the flood. In the course of the night two babies were born. Suffering from three cracked ribs, Dr. William Matthews did his best to attend to these newborns and numerous other survivors with injuries.\n\nThe threat of the surrounding water crushing the building was ever-present through the long night. By morning, one survivor had died. Those who were able climbed out a window and struggled their way across acres of debris to the safety of Green Hill. Latitude: 40.32517; Longitude: 78.91857\n\nThis park was designated as public space by the town’s founder, Joseph Johns, when Johnstown was first chartered in 1800. By the mid-l9th century, a firehouse, butcher shop, jailhouse, and a large market stood here on the public square. In 1833, the first circus in Johnstown was held in the Park. During the Civil War, soldiers used Central Park as a drill field. Children came with their parents to see circuses or watch the town’s two baseball teams, the “Kickenapawlings” and “Iron Club,” practice.\n\nIn 1872, the grounds were cleared of all buildings and laid out as a formal park. There was an ornate water fountain in the center. Nearly 100 planted trees offered shade in the summer. It was a small, quiet oasis in a busy industrial town.\n\nThe years of landscaping were wiped out in seconds by the flood wave. When the waters receded, debris 10 to 15 feet high filled the park. Within four days the wreckage was cleared to make room for tents that would house the 14th Regiment from Pittsburgh.\n\nAfter the troops departed, the park was lined with temporary wooden stores for about a year. The square was finally restored as a park, and new trees were planted. Today the park even includes a large, ornate fountain, donated by Frank Pasquerilla and very similar in style to the original fountain from the 1880s.\n\nDating from 1884, the BSG&G Investment Building is Gothic Revival style structure that survived the Johnstown Flood. It was originally the Moses Tailor Shop. It has a fleau de lis incised in stone and an elliptical arch.Latitude: 40.32448; Longitude: 78.91822\n\nThe former Tribune building, built in 1883, is a survivor of the Johnstown Flood. On the rainy Friday of May 31, 1889, George T. Swank, editor and publisher of the Johnstown Tribune, was preparing the weekly issue of the paper on the second floor of this building. At 2:30 p.m. he noted that the water stood about a foot deep on Franklin Street and that the current was flowing from Stonycreek River toward Main Street at about 6 miles per hour. Downstairs, the Tribune staff had given up trying to print the newspaper and was restlessly awaiting the recession of the waters, as was the rest of Johnstown.\n\nSwank received a call at 3:15 p.m. from the Central Telephone Office reporting that South Fork Dam was “getting worse all the time, and the danger of it breaking was increasing momentarily.”\n\nSwank had soothed the fears of Johnstowners about the South Fork Dam for years. If it were to break, he assured, it would cause little damage because it would spread out over the valley floor. But even Swank now felt grave concern. “It is idle to speculate,” he wrote, “what would be the result if the tremendous body of water . . .should be thrown into the already submerged Conemaugh Valley.” The lake water was tearing out of the broken dam on its way to Johnstown when Swank was writing the above quote.\n\nWhen the flood wave hit downtown at about 4:10 p.m., Swank could see buildings “melt like sugar in fire.” The Tribune men, after being warned of danger by a cracking partition wall, ran into the adjoining building just before part of the rear wall of the print shop collapsed. The men spent the night on the roof in the cold and rain, in the flickering glow of a fire that burned on at St. John’s Church. Latitude: 40.32483; Longitude: 78.91798"
