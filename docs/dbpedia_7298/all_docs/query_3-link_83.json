        "text": "Joe Pavelski retired this summer. Actually, he seems to have done it about a half-dozen times, which is weird in its own right, but we’ll allow it. He had a great career, lasting 18 seasons, cracking the 1,000-point mark and representing Team USA internationally.\n\nAnd while it may not have been quite as important as those accomplishments, Pavelski also did something else: He continued a long line of NHL stars named Joe. It’s been a classic NHL name since the league’s earliest days, when “Phantom” Joe Malone gave way to “Bullet” Joe Simpson, paving the way for modern-era stars like Joe Sakic, Joe Nieuwendyk and Joe Thornton.\n\nJoe is a great old-school hockey name. But these days, the emphasis is on the “old” because it’s just not a name you hear much anymore. The popularity of first names will rise and fall over generations, after all, and the NHL is no different. And when Pavelski made his exit official, I’ll admit that one of my first thoughts was: Is that the last Joe we’ll ever see in the NHL?\n\nNot quite, as it turns out. We still have Joe Veleno in Detroit, and if you also count guys named Joey, we’ve got Daccord and Anderson. Crisis averted. The legacy of Joe lives on, at least for a few more years.\n\nBut that got me wondering about some other classic hockey first names that haven’t been as lucky. In this new world of Brayden, Jayden and Kayden, a few names you might have come to associate with NHL greatness are now nowhere to be found in the league.\n\nI’ve put together a list of 10 examples, using the indispensable Hockey Reference database. I also checked recent drafts via Elite Prospects to see if there were any reinforcements on the way.\n\nIs this all an incredibly thinly veiled excuse to Remember Some Guys? Of course it is, absolutely. Welcome to Slow News Summer. Let’s start our list with arguably the most famous hockey name ever.\n\nGord, Gordon and Gordie\n\nThe GOAT: No question here, as Gordie Howe wasn’t just the best player to have the name, but singlehandedly turned “Gordie” into international shorthand for a Canadian hockey player.\n\nOther stars: Gordie Drillon was a Hall of Famer from the 1930s. More recently, Gordie Roberts, Gord Murphy and Gord Dineen were all good players, and Gord Kluzak was the No. 1 pick in 1982 but had his career wrecked by knee problems.\n\nAnd don’t forget: Labossiere, Bruce, Donnelly, Gallant, Lane, Kannegiesser.\n\nThe last one: Not counting Boyd and Andrew, who try to sneak onto the list using Gordon as their last name, the NHL’s last true Gord was Gordie Dwyer, a tough guy who played parts of five seasons from 2000 to 2004 with the Lightning, Rangers and Canadiens, and is best known for taking a 23-game suspension.\n\nHope for the future: A Gord hasn’t been drafted since the Flames took Gord Baldwin in 2005, although there does seem to be a wave of draft-eligible guys named Gordei on the way from Russia, so maybe one of them can make it. Until then, we still have Gord Miller in the broadcast booth.\n\nAl\n\nThe GOAT: Al MacInnis, the Hall of Fame defenseman with the legendary slap shot.\n\nOther stars: Al Arbour was a longtime defenseman before becoming one of the greatest coaches ever. Al Secord was an underrated 1980s power forward. Al Rollins won a very weird Hart Trophy in 1954. Al Iafrate was more fun than pretty much anyone ever.\n\nAnd don’t forget: Haworth, Karlander, MacNeil, Hill, MacAdam. And Al Hamilton was the first player to have his number retired by the Oilers.\n\nThe last one: We don’t have to go all that far back to find journeyman goaltender Al Montoya, the sixth pick in the 2004 draft who bounced around the NHL until 2018.\n\nHope for the future: The good news here is that Alexander and Alex are still in good hands, thanks to stars like Ovechkin, Pietrangelo and DeBrincat (plus Barkov repping Aleksander). But things are looking dire for Team Al, who haven’t even produced a draft pick since Montoya.\n\nNorm\n\nThe GOAT: Norm Ullman, the Hall of Fame forward who topped 1,200 points in a 20-year career.\n\nOther stars: Norm MacIver was basically the only guy with a pulse on those early Senators teams.\n\nAnd don’t forget: Ferguson, Dupont, Schmidt and Maracle.\n\nAnd if you want to count guys named Normand, that also gives us Rochefort, Baron and Lacombe. There have even been a pair of players in NHL history who went by Normie. But the league has never had a player who went by plain old Norman, presumably because the classic move of dropping a “Stormin” in front of that name would be way too cool a nickname for a hockey player.\n\nThe last one: Norm Milley, a winger who played parts of four seasons in the early 2000s for the Sabres and Lightning, scoring two goals.\n\nHope for the future: Zip. Milley was the last Norm to be drafted, and that was back in 1998. It’s going to be a long time, if ever, before hockey fans can do this again.\n\nBob\n\nThe GOAT: Bob Gainey, the Hall of Fame winger who was so good defensively that they made a new award just for him.\n\nOther stars: Bob Pulford is in the Hall of Fame, while guys like Bob Bourne, Bob Errey and Bob Rouse were all very good. And of course, Bob Probert will forever be the NHL’s all-time heavyweight champ.\n\nAnd don’t forget: Bassen, MacMillan, Nevin and “Battleship” Bob Kelly.\n\nThe last one: Future Sharks and Panthers head coach Bob Boughner, whose last season was in 2005-06.\n\nBut there’s a far bigger story developing here. Yes, “Bob” is a perfectly cromulent NHL name. But “Bobby” might be the single greatest name in NHL history, with Orr, Hull and Clarke leading a squad that also includes Holik, Carpenter and Ryan. But it’s also on the verge of extinction, with only Bobby McMann and Bobby Brink still fighting the good fight.\n\nThe good news is that we still have a supply of Roberts, including Thomas, Bortuzzo and Hagg. Be it resolved that if McMann and Brink leave the league, one of those guys has to change their name to Bobby.\n\nHope for the future: The Hurricanes spent a fifth-round pick on Robert Orr in 2021, but he went back into the draft in 2023, wasn’t picked, and spent last year in junior as an overager. Also, for some reason he seems reluctant to go by Bob or Bobby, I’m not sure why.\n\nGary\n\nThe GOAT: Probably Gary Roberts, who won a Stanley Cup in Calgary in the 1980s and then stuck around until 2009 while making you feel bad about all the junk food you were eating.\n\nOther stars: Gary Suter was a Calder winner and classic Hall of Very Good blueliner for a few teams, including those same Cup-winning Flames. Gary Leeman was the second Maple Leaf to ever score 50 goals. Gary Dornhoefer won two Cups with the Broad Street Bullies in the 70s. And of course, there was Gary “Suitcase” Smith, the extremely well-traveled 1970s goalie.\n\nAnd don’t forget: Veneruzzo, Nylund, Gambucci, Edwards, Croteau and (Garry) Unger.\n\nThe last one: Based on the final game played, it’s actually Roberts in 2009, with him and Suter being the only NHL Garys to play into the 2000s. As far as debuts, the last Gary to crack the league was Gary Emmons, who played three games for the 1993-94 Sharks.\n\nHope for the future: The NHL hasn’t drafted a Gary since the Rangers took Gary Roach in 1993. He eventually made it for a cup of coffee in the AHL, but no further. So there’s basically no hope here … for now.\n\nPeter\n\nThe GOAT: I think we have to go with Hart winner Peter Forsberg, although 1980s star Peter Stastny isn’t far back.\n\nOther stars: Peter Bondra scored 500 goals. Peter McNab topped 800 points. Peter Zezel won every single faceoff he ever took. Peter Sidorkiewicz was an All-Star in a season where he had a record of 8-46-3. And Peter Taglianetti once tried to defend his country’s honor by bodyslamming a 500-pound wrestler on the deck of the USS Intrepid. (He failed.)\n\nAnd don’t forget: Schaefer, Ihnacak, Popovic, Douris, Worrell, Holland and Budaj.\n\nI just love the mix here. The fact that this name was popular in both North America in Europe made it feel like an unassailable hockey name, right up until it wasn’t.\n\nThe last one: It would appear to be Bruins’ winger Peter Cehlárik, who played three games in 2019-20. Of course, there’s still Blackhawks’ goalie Mrazek, but he spells it “Petr,” the same as Nedved, Sykora and Klima.\n\nHope for the future: Peter DiLiberatore was a sixth-round pick by the Golden Knights in 2018, and has bounced between the AHL and ECHL for the last few years. At 24, he’s a long shot, but might be our best current hope.\n\nBill and Billy\n\nThe GOAT: I’ll go with Bill Durnan, although he’s one of a stunning seven HHOF Bills, along with Barber, Cook, Gadsby, Cowley, Quackenbush and Mosienko. And that’s not even counting Billy Smith.\n\nOther stars: Current Wild GM Bill Guerin was a very good player for almost two decades, while Billy Harris was the key to the Butch Goring trade that launched the modern deadline day. Bill Ranford won a Conn Smythe. Bill Masterton has an award named after him. And Bill Barilko disappeared, that summer.\n\nAnd don’t forget: Hogaboam, Berg, Huard, Plager, Sweatt, and of course the legendary “Builder Lego.”\n\nThe last one: We had a Billy just last year, when defenseman Billy Sweezey got into nine games for the Blue Jackets. But we’re past a decade since our last Bill, which was courtesy of the one and only career game played by Flames center Bill Arnold in 2013-14. These days, the NHL is a league for Williams.\n\nHope for the future: Sweezey is 28 and just signed a two-way deal with the Bruins a few weeks ago, so there’s a chance we see him in the NHL again at some point to at least bring Billy back. We haven’t had a Bill drafted since 2010. But finally, some good news: That should change next summer with Bill Zonnon viewed as a potential first-round talent.\n\nGreg\n\nThe GOAT: I’m not completely sure there is one. Seriously, the history of NHL guys named Greg is weird. Hockey Reference lists over 50 of them, but I think the best of the bunch is probably Greg Millen.\n\nOther stars: We have to mention Greg Adams because there were two of them and they once played on the same team just to confuse everyone. Also, shout out to 1974 No.1 pick Greg Joly, who debuted with the 1974-75 Capitals and went -69 in 44 games.\n\nAnd don’t forget: Terrion, De Vries, Gilbert, Hawgood, Johnson, Zanon, Malone. There was also Sheppard, although he was one of those “Gregg” guys. And of course, we have to mention Gregory Campbell, if only so his dad doesn’t send any nasty emails about us.\n\nThe last one: It’s a photo finish from the 2021-22 season, with Greg Hoffman and Greg Pateryn both playing their final NHL games. But the honors go to Greg McKegg, who made it into April of that year but hasn’t been seen in the league since.\n\nHope for the future: McKegg spent the last two years in the AHL, so we may get to see him again, meaning you can all dust off this joke. We also had a Gregor drafted this year, when Utah took Gregor Biber in the fourth round, and 25-year-old Greg Meireles is toiling away in the AHL.\n\nGuy\n\nThe GOAT: It can’t be anyone but “The Flower,” Guy Lafleur, one of the greatest wingers of all time.\n\nOther stars: Guy Lapointe and Guy Carbonneau are both in the Hall of Fame\n\nAnd don’t forget: Charron, Chouinard, Larose and Trottier.\n\nThe last one: Guy Hebert took the name with him when he played his last game in 2001. He was an American, but still went with the French pronunciation of Guy, presumably because he knew that Guy Lafleur had his own disco album and the only cool person to ever use the American pronunciation was Guy Smiley.\n\nHope for the future: I think it’s over, folks. The last Guy to be drafted was Guy Lehoux, a defenseman taken in the ninth round by the Maple Leafs back in 1991, and I’m just not sure he’s going to make it. Let’s mourn the loss of the NHL Guy by pouring one out and/or smoking a full pack of darts in between shifts.\n\nKen\n\nThe GOAT: It has to be Hall of Fame goalie Ken Dryden.\n\nOther stars: Ken Reardon was a 1940s star who’s in the Hall of Fame. Ken Hodge had a pair of first-team All-Star seasons with the 1970s Bruins. And of course, Ken Daneyko played roughly five decades on the Devils blue line, scoring three times.\n\nAnd don’t forget: Wregget, Yaremchuk, Linseman, Schinkel, Belanger and Morrow. And I can’t forget my all-time favorite heavy metal star, Ken “The Bomber” Baumgartner.\n\nThe last one: The last “Ken” in the league was Ken Klee, who hung them up in 2009 before going on to an interesting coaching career. We did have a Kenny as recently as 2021, when Kenny Agostino played for the Leafs. And Kenneth Appleby got into one game for the Islanders last January.\n\nHope for the future: The Kings took college forward Kenny Connors in the fourth round in 2022, so maybe he’s still got a shot. But there hasn’t been a Ken drafted since 2000, making this yet another name to fade from the NHL record books.\n\nExcept … I mean, this one could be coming back, right? Surely there are enough Barbie-loving parents out there who think this name would be Kenough for their little future NHLer bundles of joy. The 2041 draft should have plenty of Kens for GMs to pick from. There’s even a good chance that Ken Holland is still kicking around as an advisor somewhere to make sure it happens.\n\nAnd that’s a good place to end because it reminds us that you never know with a great hockey name. Sometimes they disappear, but sometimes they just take a little break, if only to make sure we appreciate them.\n\n(Top photo of Gordie Howe: Denis Brodeur / NHLI via Getty Images)"
