        "text": "Founder and Managing Partner\n\nGerry Cardinale\n\nGerry Cardinale is the Founder, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of the firm.\n\nRedBird manages $10 billion of equity on behalf of a select group of blue-chip institutional and family office investors. The Firm’s prior and current investment portfolio includes many of the world’s most iconic entrepreneurs, properties and brands across the sports, media and entertainment industries – including Fenway Sports Group (Boston Red Sox, Liverpool FC, Pittsburgh Penguins, New England Sports Network); the Yankees Entertainment & Sports (“YES”) Network (New York Yankees and Amazon); Skydance Media (Larry and David Ellison); The Springhill Company (LeBron James and Maverick Carter); the UFL (Dwayne Johnson and his partner Dany Garcia); and European football’s A.C. Milan which recently won Italy’s Serie A Championship.\n\nSince the Firm’s inception, RedBird has also been an active investor and company builder in Financial Services — a core competency of the Firm with a dedicated investment team that has invested over $1 billion across Insurance & Insurance Distribution, Asset & Wealth Management and Fintech & Insurtech. Notable investments include Aquarian, a diversified life and annuity insurance carrier with over $7 billion of assets and an affiliated asset manager; and Constellation, a managing general agent insurance distribution platform that RedBird scaled to a top 5 player in the industry in under two years before exiting to Truist in July 2021.\n\nPrior to founding RedBird in 2014, Gerry spent 20 years at Goldman Sachs where he was a Partner of the firm and a senior leader of the Merchant Bank’s private equity investing business. During his tenure, Gerry worked with entrepreneurs and family business owners to build several successful multi-billion-dollar companies, including the Yankees Entertainment & Sports (“YES”) Network, Legends Hospitality, and Suddenlink Communications.\n\nIn addition to his broad responsibilities as Chief Investment Officer, Gerry is actively engaged in company-building activities across the Firm’s portfolio in its core industries of Sports, Media & Entertainment and Financial Services. He is also active in driving RedBird’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion within the Firm as well as within the investment portfolio. Accordingly, 50% of the Firm’s investment professionals and 30% of CEOs in its most recent fund are either female or diverse.\n\nPhilanthropically, Gerry is a Trustee of the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City and leads one of the multi-state Selection Committees that awards Rhodes Scholarships each year. Gerry received an Honors BA from Harvard University where he graduated Magna Cum Laude and an M.Phil in Politics and Political Theory from Oxford University where he was a Rhodes Scholar.\n\nChairman\n\nJohn Thornton\n\nJohn Thornton is the Chairman of the Firm.\n\nJohn has had a legendary career on Wall Street spanning over four decades and most recently has served as the chairman of several corporate, public policy and educational boards in the US and China.\n\nJohn was the Co-President of Goldman Sachs and prior to that served as (i) the Co-CEO of Goldman Sachs International, where he is largely credited for building Goldman Sachs’ business outside the United States, and in this capacity also served as (ii) the Chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia.\n\nAfter retiring from Goldman Sachs, John became the first non-Chinese full professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing since 1949, where today he is also the director of the Global Leadership Program for the university.\n\nHe currently sits on multiple boards, and has a long history of corporate and philanthropic leadership. One of his strengths is his ongoing leadership in Asia. John is Co-Chair of the Asia Society, trustee of the Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management, and a member of the International Advisory Council of CIC, the Chinese sovereign wealth fund. John recently met with Xi Jinping as part of the US-China summit and CEO delegation in San Francisco.\n\nJohn has also served on the Boards of HSBC, Intel, General Atlantic, ICBC, China Unicom, IMG, BSkyB, DirecTV, News Corp and on the advisory board of McKinsey and the Council on Foreign Relations. Institutional Investor Magazine named John one of forty individuals who have had the greatest influence in shaping global financial markets over the past forty years.\n\nPresident & Partner\n\nRobert Klein\n\nRobert Klein is the President of the Firm.\n\nIn his current role, Robert oversees the non-investment operations of the Firm, including Capital Partnerships, Finance and Legal & Compliance. In this capacity, he is responsible for creating new products and partnerships to grow the Firm’s global presence. Since joining RedBird in 2017, Robert has helped to drive AUM growth from $1 billion to $10 billion and has diversified RedBird’s LP base to include global blue-chip pension plans, endowments, insurance companies, asset managers and family offices. He has also built internal teams to further support and institutionalize the Firm’s operating infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to his Firm responsibilities, Robert is also a Board member and/or actively involved in select investments, including AC Milan, Main Street Advisors and Obra Capital.

During his tenure at JPMorgan, Robert was also President of J.P.
