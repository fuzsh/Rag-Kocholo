        "text": "WWII propaganda short that plays on wildly offensive Japanese stereotypes. This is the first Popeye film I've ever seen (at least, that I can actively remember), and while it's in no way fair to judge such a widely and deeply-loved character on one short, I feel no urge to go any deeper into the sailor's filmography (the character himself annoyed me, not just the racist elements).\n\nYou can watch it on YouTube.\n\nAfter 108 shorts made under Max and Dave Fleischer, \"You're a Sap, Mr. Jap\" is Popeye's debut under a new Fleischer-less Paramount studio, now titled Famous Studios, and what a dubious starting point this is. Disturbingly racist as its title implies, it's more-or-less 7 minutes of Popeye inciting hate speech and antagonizing various aspects of Japanese culture while at sea. The Fleischers didn't escape racist caricature-heavy cartoons themselves (\"Big Chief Ugh-Amugh-Ugh\" from 1938 is probably the low point of their Popeye years), but this is easily the worst of the series so far, without any merit even as far as its animation goes (its visual gags and action obstacles feel so uninspired compared to all the Fleischer Navy-based Popeye cartoons preceding this one). This is the breed of wartime propaganda short that gave propaganda shorts such a bad distasteful name. The Fleischers navigated these murky waters with some care. This cartoon is just Hate.\n\nPopeye is out at sea when he comes across a Japanese ship and it's his American duty to try and destroy them all by himself.\n\nObviously with a title like YOU'RE A SAP, MR. JAP, you're not dealing with something that is politically correct by today's standards but that's why it's so important to remember that when this movie was made Japan was the enemy. We were fighting them in WWII and I'm sure Americans got a kick out of seeing Popeye beat them up on the screen. The stereotypes that are shown here will probably be offensive to a lot of people but that's why keeping them in context is so important. As far as the film goes, it's pretty fun as it's non-stop action and there are several funny bits including the tricks the Japanese soldiers try to pull to kill Popeye."
