        "text": "Prince Baggett, Confluential Films\n\nIt's not easy being a Prince. \"Growing up, I honestly hated the name,\" Baggett said.\n\nBut as he got older and made his way in the entertainment industry, he realized his unique name got him noticed, even in meetings packed with high-powered execs. \"They don't forget Prince in a room.\"\n\nThese days Baggett, 40, is building a career to remember. As the head of film for Confluential, a 9-year-old company led by producer and filmmaker Tommy Oliver, he was instrumental in bringing three buzzy features and an acclaimed documentary to the Sundance Film Festival this past January.\n\nIn a tough festival market that foreshadowed 2023's reined-in Hollywood spending, Confluential's narrative features didn't find buyers. But the documentary, \"Going to Mars: The Nikki Giovanni Project,\" which chronicles the life and influence of the award-winning poet and activist, is in the hunt for an Oscar nomination and will air on HBO in January after a theatrical run this month.\n\nLooking forward, Baggett is particularly excited about a project from creator Sonay Hoffman, who most recently was co-showrunner on the missing-persons drama \"Found\" for NBC. \"It's a huge sci-fi that's multi-generational, multi-dimensional and multi-female-led,\" Baggett said, adding that he's a fan of world-building and grand storytelling. He's also a romantic (\"'Titanic' is a movie I absolutely adore\") who'd love to produce a POC-centered remake of the 2003 Kate Hudson/Matthew McConaughey romcom \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.\"\n\nBaggett grew up in Inglewood, California, just south of LA — his father worked in the aircraft industry. By the time Baggett landed the job that would be his entree into Hollywood, an executive internship at Paramount Television, his family was living in Riverside, more than 60 miles east. He drove up to three hours, both ways, every day to pursue his dream.\n\nThe job involved dropping daily Nielsen ratings on execs' desks, gophering around the lot, and hitting the Paramount commissary to pick up bosses' drinks and lunches. \"But it allowed me to move around a lot and meet a lot of other studio execs, meet a lot of producers, and it all led to this opportunity I have today,\" he said. \"So the hustle then paid off.\"\n\nMost recent binge: \"House of the Dragon\" (HBO)\n\n— Alison Brower\n\nZita Brack, MRC\n\nAs a law student, Brack always thought she'd go into public life — but a clerkship at the San Diego Superior Court changed her mind.\n\n\"This might be a little bit too serious for me,\" she realized at the time, after an instance when the judge Brack was working with had a bomb placed under her car.\n\nIntrigued by a talk she attended about Hollywood dealmaking, Brack decided to try her hand at entertainment law. An internship at NBCUniversal — including a particularly challenging contract issue involving USA series \"Dig\" — sealed the deal.\n\n\"That opened the door to this other world of being in Hollywood but not being on the talent side, because I unfortunately wasn't blessed in that way,\" the 34-year-old said.\n\nShe went on to spend four years at NBCU, with her work spanning music, influencers, TV, and film.\n\nIn 2021, she started at MRC, where she is now the director of business and legal affairs. She has negotiated deals for shows like Hulu's \"The Great\" and Peacock's \"Poker Face,\" including hammering out the details of Natasha Lyonne's deal to star and executive produce as well as helping land guest stars like Adrien Brody.\n\nWhile this year's writers' and actors' strikes were disruptive, they didn't create much of a quiet period for Brack.\n\n\"We entered into a world where it was just competitive IP deals,\" she said. \"It got a little crazy, but it was very exciting to be in bidding wars with other studios.\"\n\nNow that Hollywood is rolling again, she's tackling how the new WGA and SAG-AFTRA contracts — and the twilight of peak TV — are changing the business. \"We are in a world where everything is at a premium, but the budgets from the buyers are going to be smaller,\" she said. \"We are going to figure out a way to still make high-quality content.\"\n\nHer latest triumph is closing the deal for a new showrunner for season two of \"Poker Face\" — she couldn't share the name, but said it was a \"great negotiation.\"\n\nMost recent binge: \"The Crown\"\n\nGuilty entertainment pleasure: \"Golden Girls\"\n\nDream reboot: \"Girlfriends\"\n\n— Madeline Berg\n\nMarissa Brooks, CBS Studios\n\nIn just 11 years, Brooks has gone from cashier at a Marshalls department store, where she worked upon moving to Los Angeles, to director of drama development at CBS Studios.\n\nFollowing a few gigs in casting, including one at Byron Allen's Entertainment Studios, Brooks landed at CBS as an executive assistant after a friend passed along her resume to the person exiting the role. The Pittsburgh native believes her honesty, including her willingness to admit she wasn't tuned into mainstream hits, helped her stand out.\n\n\"Everything that other people were watching, I was not watching. I was watching something completely different,\" Brooks said (that something else was the UK sitcom \"Chewing Gum\" on Netflix). \"So I was bringing a perspective from content in the industry that wasn't really being tapped into.\"\n\nAmong notable recent accomplishments for Brooks, 33, are overseeing series like \"CSI: Vegas,\" \"Matlock,\" and \"Fire Country,\" which was CBS' top new drama in 2022. Since the strikes ended, she's been working to get shows back on the air. She meets often with emerging writers who are working to reimagine familiar formats and themes.\n\n\"You can hear fresh perspectives on stories that have already been tackled but need a new way in, especially when you want to reach these younger audiences,\" Brooks said.\n\nBrooks is a big believer in improving representation, both by elevating those who've traditionally been overlooked and by making sure they're shown in a fair and accurate light.\n\n\"The industry has done really well on diversity on-screen, but I think you have to go a little bit deeper than that,\" she said. \"I want to see more people who look like my friends or my family in those family units.\"\n\nIn April, Brooks was selected for the Women In Cable Telecommunications' Rising Leaders Program, which offers mentorship and guidance in areas like team-building, not to mention an opportunity to build her industry network. For other up-and-comers in the industry, she has a simple piece of advice: \"Be open to the path your journey takes you on while being strategic about the moves that you make.\"\n\nMost recent binge: \"I just started 'Black Cake' (on Hulu). I read the book, love the book, and so far think that they have done a phenomenal job on the adaptation.\"\n\n— James Faris\n\nJessamine Burgum, Pinky Promise\n\nThe depths of a global pandemic might seem like the wrong time to throw caution to the wind and pursue an entrepreneurial path, but that's exactly what actress and producer Burgum decided to do.\n\nIn 2020, she founded Pinky Promise, a production and financing company that's backed several successful films — like last year's \"Honk For Jesus. Save Your Soul,\" which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was distributed by Jordan Peele's Monkey Paw and Focus Features. Other projects include \"If You Were The Last,\" featuring Anthony Mackie and Zoe Chao; and the forthcoming film \"I Don't Understand You,\" starring actors Nick Kroll and Andrew Rannells,\" that saw Burgum and her team decamp to Rome for filming. Another project in development is Scarlett Johansson's directorial debut.\n\nBurgum, 27, has raised more than $23 million in private funds from limited partners, and her all-women team focuses on films that celebrate the work of creative personalities from marginalized constituencies.\n\n\"Any industry where there's big systemic changes happening — they're really ripe for disruption. So I think that you're seeing a lot of young people in particular look at that opportunity and really want to make something great out of it,\" she told BI by phone from a company off-site gathering in Montana. \"I think to be an entrepreneur means that you have to always have your eyes on the horizon.\"\n\nBurgum, who's held roles in films like \"The Starling Girl,\" which she also produced, isn't giving up her dream of being an actress. It's an ambition she's harbored since she was a kid in North Dakota and her dad would take her to the farm supply store to buy materials she'd use — with some help from her brothers — to erect impromptu sets in the family's basement, where they'd stage original plays.\n\nBut Burgum said it felt natural to move from performing as an artist to backing and developing others' voices. \"In terms of raising, it really is a form of storytelling,\" she said of interacting with investors and pitching for capital. \"It's about getting the person that you're talking to excited about what you're building, and being able to paint a vision of what you're going to create together.\"\n\nGuilty entertainment pleasure: \"No one should feel guilty for watching kind, lovely British people bake things in a tent in the English countryside. It's absolutely 'The Great British Bake Off' — nothing bad is going to happen to me there. The world is perfect. Everyone gets along when you're in the tent.\"\n\nDream reboot: \"Someone has to make 'Mamma Mia 3.' Give the people what they want, which is more Abba and more Meryl Streep as a singing ghost.\"\n\n— Reed Alexander\n\nMaxfield Elins, Lionsgate TV\n\nElins' role as SVP of scripted television has him overseeing a head-swiveling variety of shows for a range of platforms — from Julia Child period dramedy \"Julia\" on Max to John Wick prequel \"The Continental\" on Peacock, which became that platform's biggest debut of the year. The 34-year-old credits his range to Lionsgate's focus on telling stories \"that feel left or right of center,\" he said, and Lionsgate in turn credits Elins with selling more than 20 shows across streaming and cable in the span of 18 months.\n\nGrowing up with a powerful appreciation for comedy legends like Garry Shandling and Albert Brooks, Elins knew early on, he said, \"I want to be a part of the world that creates this.\" He got his Hollywood start in the mailroom at WME, then assisted two agents there before landing at Lionsgate as the assistant to TV chair Kevin Beggs.\n\nOver the course of a decade, Elins has risen to a job that includes making deals with one of the WME reps, Ryan Drazin, whose calls he used to place. He's also had the opportunity to take meetings with personal heroes like Brooks. Other shows under his purview include Apple TV+'s bilingual resort dramedy \"Acapulco\" and \"Paul T. Goldman,\" a true-crime miniseries for Peacock that blends scripted and unscripted in a mix Elins called \"very meta.\"\n\nDuring this summer's writers' and actors' strikes, Elins and his colleagues changed the rhythm of their days. \"We read a lot of books. We looked at a lot of international formats. We met with a lot of European producers and directors and kind of just tried to do as much as we could to be ready for when the strikes ended,\" he said. \"We were able to hit the ground running.\"\n\nThe LA native and avid tennis player hangs out with longtime pals, only one of whom works in the entertainment industry. He told BI he finds inspiration and ideas for shows in \"all sorts of different places,\" from news headlines to friends' book recommendations, adding, \"I'm, sadly, a big Chicago sports fan, so I get a lot of emotional misery from that which I can draw upon.\"\n\nMost recent binge: \"'Beef' on Netflix. I'm kind of late to the game. I absolutely love it.\"\n\nDream reboot: \"If 'The Larry Sanders Show' were somehow to release five new episodes, I'm first in line.\"\n\n— Alison Brower\n\nJenny Falkoff, Amazon MGM Studios\n\nHow do you reinvent a stalwart of broadcast TV for the streaming era? Amazon set out to find out when it put long-running TV judge Judy Sheindlin on its free streamer, Freevee, in 2021. \"Judy Justice,\" which won a Daytime Emmy in its first season and became Freevee's No. 1 original show, leading to a two-season renewal and a pair of spinoffs.\n\nFor Falkoff, who developed and oversaw the show, it was about letting Sheindlin do what she does best while giving the show distinct touches to set it apart from the 27-year syndicated juggernaut \"Judge Judy.\" Sheindlin's granddaughter appears as a law clerk on \"Judy Justice,\" for example, and joins Sheindlin in her chambers to do a post-mortem on each case. \"You get a much more personal look at Judy,\" Falkoff said. \"Letting viewers see that softer, more open side is really interesting.\"\n\nFalkoff, 36, was elevated this year to head of reality series for Amazon MGM Studios, where she's working to make Amazon's platforms into unscripted powerhouses with fresh swings from \"Hollywood Houselift with Jeff Lewis\" and house competition show ​​\"The GOAT\" to cooking series and an adaptation of British game show \"The 1% Club.\"\n\n\"We would like to have the best in class of every subgenre,\" Falkoff said. \"We want people to come to us as a destination and have offerings for everybody.\"\n\nFalkoff got hooked on reality programming early in her career while working as an agent trainee at ICM Partners (which was acquired by CAA in 2022). \"There were so many different worlds to explore,\" Falkoff recalled. \"I loved the variety of it all; I loved the immediacy of it.\"\n\nShe got a job working on CBS' \"Big Brother\" and never looked back; other shows on her resumé have included \"Hell's Kitchen,\" \"Secrets & Wives,\" and \"Rich Kids of Beverly Hills.\" Falkoff believes there's still plenty of life in categories like true crime and dating shows, with new news stories and formats always waiting to be adapted.\n\n\"A lot of reality shows just speak to human nature. Everyone wants to find love; everyone wants justice,\" she said.\n\nMost recent binge: \"'Big Brother' — I worked on it for years and since I've come to Amazon I still love it. It is a massive time commitment.\"\n\nGuilty entertainment pleasure: \"If you like it, it's not guilty. But at night I definitely spend a lot of time looking at toddler meal and cleaning hacks on TikTok. I have toddlers and getting them to eat anything is a struggle.\"\n\n— Lucia Moses\n\nJacqueline Garell, Universal Pictures\n\nAs a creative executive at Universal Pictures, Garell is intimately involved in all aspects of the projects she works on — from the earliest pitch meetings through the theatrical release. She works on projects transcending genres from horror to comedy to big tentpole franchises.\n\n\"We get to support creatives in getting their vision told on the big screen,\" Garell said. \"I am inspired every day by that work, and the people we get to work with.\"\n\n\"It's getting to give out ideas and notes,\" she continued. \"It's getting to watch a cut of a movie and getting to problem-solve how we make little changes and improvements. It's hearing a pitch and seeing how that could fit into our studio.\"\n\nIn less than a decade, Garell, 30, has risen a long way, having started as a publicity intern at NBCUniversal in 2014 and later an assistant to Peter Cramer, the president of the studio. Today, she pays it forward for the next generation of Hollywood talent by serving as a mentor for Universal's Global Talent Development & Inclusion's Writers Program. She also puts time into an entirely different kind of creative outlet: singing with Lolas, a women's pop a cappella group.\n\nAmong her professional wins for 2023 was \"Five Nights at Freddy's,\" which became the highest-grossing horror film of the year, earning roughly $290 million at the global box office and smashing viewership records on Peacock. She also worked on \"Please Don't Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain,\" a film released on Peacock this year as well.\n\nNow, Garell's slate is packed with multiple projects in the next year, including \"Twisters,\" a sequel to the iconic 1990s disaster thriller \"Twister\"; and \"The Killer\" for Peacock with director John Woo, the famed Hong Kong filmmaker who helmed the original in 1989. Garell is also overseeing the action comedy \"Shots! Shots! Shots!\" Actor Jason Momoa is attached to the project.\n\nAnd while it might seem challenging to juggle different themes and filmmaking styles, Garell says she finds it energizing: \"Every stop is a story at the end of the day, and there's so many parallels you can see between the different genres and how they all tie in together,\" she concluded. \"I kind of love it all.\"\n\nMost recent binge: \"The Curse\" (Showtime)\n\nGuilty entertainment pleasure: \"I am finally watching 'Sex and the City' all the way through for the first time, which has been a really fun decompress show for me.\"\n\n— Reed Alexander\n\nZac Geoffray, ABC\n\nComedy always spoke to Geoffray. Growing up, he loved shows like \"The Simpsons\" and \"Scrubs\" — he'd buy full seasons at Blockbuster, and soaking up the DVD commentaries was a favorite pastime.\n\nAs a director of comedy development at ABC, Geoffray has overseen shows including \"Abbott Elementary,\" which he steered from the earliest phases through its greenlight and beyond. Quinta Brunson's Emmy-winning series, which was widely credited with revitalizing the network sitcom genre, put the work of American public school teachers in the spotlight.\n\n\"I'm so proud to have worked on a show that makes audiences both laugh and feel uplifted,\" said Geoffray, 31, who came to ABC in 2019 after spending several years in development at Warner Bros. TV. \"It was a joy to champion at every step of the way, just because of the care that the creators had for the characters.\"\n\nComedy has long been viewed in Hollywood as one of the toughest art forms to nail — it can be highly technical and finding a breakout star is no easy task. \"Comedy is very difficult because of how subjective it is. What makes me laugh is different than what makes other people laugh,\" Geoffray said, adding: \"It all starts with the characters\" and \"establishing their rapport with each other, making it feel like the audience can invite those characters into their homes and wants to invite those characters into their homes for hundreds of episodes.\"\n\nOne of his favorite parts of the job, he said, is reading sample scripts — he's read more than 3,000 over his years in Hollywood, according to a script log he keeps. The onetime UTA agent trainee finds it's one of the best techniques for getting a sense of a writer's voice.\n\nIn addition to his work on \"Abbott Elementary,\" Geoffray has earned respect internally for helping discover many of the writers now driving ABC comedies, and he's also participated in the network's Community Engagement Series. It's an informational program giving early-career professionals a look into the inner workings of Hollywood, partnering with organizations like the City of LA's Evolve Entertainment Fund, Academy Gold, LA City College, and Ghetto Film School.\n\nMost recent binge: \"Slow Horses\" (Apple TV+)\n\nGuilty entertainment pleasure: \"My ideal Sunday afternoon involves watching multiple NFL games at the same time while following along with my fantasy football team. That's definitely something that gets my mind off of everything else.\"\n\nDream reboot: \"I would love to watch more '30 Rock.' I'd love to see how those characters are navigating the entertainment industry challenges in 2024.\"\n\n— Reed Alexander\n\nNick Graves, SMAC Entertainment\n\nSMAC Entertainment, the company behind projects like \"Coach Prime\" (which follows Deion Sanders' college coaching career) and the upcoming Snoop Dogg comedy film \"The Underdoggs,\" brought on 28-year-old Graves two years ago.\n\nComing from making scripted fare at the production company Anonymous Content, he described being thrown into \"BS High\" — a documentary about the fake Bishop Sycamore High School and its football team — as a \"real crash course in how to work the doc world.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles native, who serves as creative executive for both scripted and unscripted at SMAC, said having a voice in \"BS High\" gave him the confidence to dig into a story to find exactly the right angle, even if that direction isn't clear from the start. The project sold before the full story of the scam behind the school had been uncovered, he said, and HBO execs there supported him in going past the initial shock to learn about the players' experiences.\n\nSMAC was cofounded in 2020 by former NFL star Michael Strahan and former NFL business executive and talent manager Constance Schwartz-Morini (SMAC stands for sports, media, and culture). The company manages sports and entertainment talent and works with brands as well as produces film and TV — Graves is hoping to expand its portfolio with international stories, which he's passionate about, and not just because \"everyone's trying to find the next 'Drive to Survive.'\"\n\n\"Most of the stuff that I really have watched and seen that feels fresh and unique, but also universally true, have been foreign films or foreign TV shows,\" he said. \"I think sports have a really powerful way of connecting people all across the globe.\"\n\nLooking ahead, the former Cartoon Network-loving kid is working on SMAC's upcoming animated series with Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin to teach kids about space and science lessons. Graves said the positive messages he learned from animated shows as a kid — like being a good friend and navigating difficult situations — still resonate with him, and he hopes the series will inspire young audiences to dream about space.\n\n\"Education and animation has always been such an important marriage of content and style,\" Graves said.\n\nMost recent binge: \"The Curse\" (Showtime): \"It's really twisted and weird, but I just haven't seen anything quite like it on TV.\"\n\nDream reboot: \"I'm just such a fan of 'Cheers,' and I'm like, honestly, if 'Frasier' can do it, I feel like there's a world in which we see Ted Danson getting back behind the bar. So to me that would be a very special thing.\"\n\n— Margaret Fleming\n\nHannah Gullixson, Netflix\n\nAs senior director for Netflix's social media in the US and Canada, Gullixson gets people watching — and talking about — the streamer's thousands of titles, including its biggest hits.\n\nShe and her team helped make \"Squid Game\" Netflix's most popular series on social media (until \"Wednesday\") with more than 3.3 billion social impressions on its own accounts, according to the streamer. She's also had a strong hand in the success of the follow-up competition series \"Squid Game: The Challenge,\" whose teaser trailer racked up 170 million global organic impressions, making it one of the streamer's largest teaser debuts.\n\nGullixson and her team work to identify elements that'll resonate with the audience. She said her team brings a diversity of experience to the table, which helps ensure a wide variety of viewpoints are represented.\n\n\"The art of virality, it's hard,\" she said. \"Squid Game,\" for example, \"is a Korean-language original and it took the world by surprise. What the team does really well is find those moments the world is going to love.\"\n\nHer impact also touched \"One Piece,\" the manga phenomenon that premiered in August, when her team helped create a bespoke in-app hub to connect fans with content on TikTok that gained Netflix over 436,000 followers in two weeks.\n\nAnd for \"Wednesday,\" Gullixson's team launched an X account in the voice of the lead character that commented on pop culture, interacted with fans, and partnered with Lady Gaga to recreate Wednesday's Bloody Mary dance scene.\n\nGullixson, 36, started at Netflix in originals marketing in 2015, working her way up to her current role in 2022. She previously worked at FX Networks and Top Flight Productions.\n\nFinding new ways to surprise and delight fans is a constant challenge, whether it's with live, interactive \"Squid Game\" experiences or taking photos of all 456 \"Squid Game\" challenge contestants for them to share online. \"We'd never done that scale before,\" she said of the challenge. \"It was such a wonderful moment on the internet.\"\n\nFor 2024 she'll be looking for more ways to create great moments. \"As a marketer our goal is conversation. Every year it's: How do we evolve to stay on top of the conversation? That's what keeps me up at night.\"\n\nMost recent binge: \"I'm a big book-to-screen fan. Apple just had 'Lessons in Chemistry' and 'The Buccaneers,' which is fun and a delight.\"\n\n— Lucia Moses\n\nWhitney Hodack, Funny or Die\n\nWhen Hodack arrived at Funny or Die in 2018, her first assignment was to figure out a reboot of Comedy Central's \"@midnight.\"\n\nThings have come full circle: In November, it was announced that \"After Midnight,\" the latest iteration of \"@midnight,\" will take the 12:30 AM slot on CBS, with Hodack as an executive producer.\n\nWith the show unannounced but in the hopper, Hodack and her colleagues were as eager as anyone in Hollywood for this year's writers' and actors' strikes to resolve. Once they did, \"we were like finally, now we can start working on 'After Midnight,'\" she said. \"I want to get back out on set. I want to make some funny content.\"\n\nThe show is Hodack's latest project at Funny or Die, where the 37-year-old SVP of physical production has worked on digital series \"Gay of Thrones\" as well as TV shows \"Flipped\" and \"Guilty Party\" and podcasts \"The Last Degree of Kevin Bacon\" and \"The Ron Burgundy Podcast.\"\n\nBut her biggest achievement so far has been the Roku Channel movie \"Weird: The Al Yankovic Story,\" which earned Hodack an Emmy nomination as producer (one of five nods for the project).\n\n\"Being able to be in those creative conversations, getting to work with our director Eric Appel and Al as a writer-producer — it just was next level,\" she said.\n\nHodack got her start in reality, working on shows for TLC and Food Network. In 2012, she moved to Los Angeles, where she transitioned into the narrative space, working on \"Entourage the Movie\" (as the assistant to star Jeremy Piven) and as a production assistant on \"American Sniper.\"\n\n\"I am on the set of a Clint Eastwood movie, I've arrived,\" she remembered thinking. \"From there, you meet new people, you just feel like maybe you will be okay.\"\n\nMost recent binge: \"'Peaky Blinders' (on Netflix). I had started it a few times, and my coworker was like, 'You've got to try it one more time and turn those subtitles on.' That was clutch, and I cruised through all six seasons.\"\n\nDream reboot: \"Happy Endings\"\n\n— Madeline Berg\n\nAurelio Lopez, Onyx Collective\n\nGrowing up the son of working-class immigrants from Guatemala, Lopez never expected to end up in Hollywood. But while studying economics at UC Santa Barbara, he was drawn to photography, leading him to switch his major to film and media. Attending a student symposium at the Telluride Film Festival, where he caught films like \"Moonlight,\" confirmed he'd found his calling. \"I came back with fire in my belly,\" he said.\n\nLopez, 30, hasn't left his humble background behind, as he's gravitated to companies that prioritize diversity. A manager of scripted series at Disney's Onyx Collective, a brand that celebrates creators of color and underrepresented voices, he played a key role in producing and launching its first scripted series, the juicy thriller \"Reasonable Doubt\" that's been renewed for season two on Hulu (the exclusive home for Onyx content in the US).\n\nHe's equally passionate about an upcoming project, \"Deli Boys,\" centered on a pair of Pakistani-American brothers forced to reckon with their father's past. \"It's a great example of representing different communities on screen that haven't been in the spotlight before,\" Lopez said. He also helps manage Onyx's overall deals with Ryan Coogler, Destin Daniel Cretton, Yara Shahidi, and Jason Kim.\n\nWithout connections in Hollywood, Lopez had to be creative to get into the business. When UTA told him its internship program was full, he called HR anyway and talked his way into getting a spot. \"I had to be my own advocate,\" he said. \"It goes back to tenacity and not giving up.\"\n\nHe went on to a second internship at CAA before landing a full-time spot in the agency's international TV group. He also did stints at Netflix, where he worked on films including \"The Two Popes\" and \"The White Tiger,\" and Ava DuVernay's production company, Array, where he worked on projects such as Max miniseries \"DMZ\" and \"Colin in Black & White\" for Netflix.\n\nLopez credits his parents for his work ethic, and he's proud of the path he's forged. \"A big mistake I made early on was feeling like I didn't belong,\" he said. \"It's natural to feel like I'm an imposter. But I've worked hard to earn a seat at the table.\"\n\nGuilty entertainment pleasure: \"Going to the movies by myself and just detaching from reality for a couple hours. It's hard to replicate being in a dark room.\"\n\nDream reboot: \"Disney's 'Lilo and Stitch' — I love the original, chaotic being. I'm very excited for what they do with it. And 'Avatar: The Last Airbender.'\"\n\n— Lucia Moses\n\nCory McConnell, The Ringer\n\nMcConnell understands that short-form video is key to driving young people toward The Ringer's podcasts and written analysis about the culture and future of sports.\n\n\"I think younger people almost expect there to be a visual element of a show that they're listening to,\" the 34-year-old senior video manager said. \"Most people my age, I would say in our mid-thirties, we're used to throwing on podcasts in the car and having it be an audio experience.\"\n\nMcConnell and his team shoot, edit, and produce the visual component of Ringer podcasts like \"The Dave Chang Show\" starring the celebrity chef. McConnell also leads production of original video series like \"The Play Sheet,\" where one of the company's NFL writers breaks down the league's action weekly. He works across platforms, learning what vertical content works on TikTok and Instagram while doing the same for longer-form, horizontal videos on YouTube.\n\nThe Florida native joined The Ringer in 2018 after two years at Render Media, a digital publisher, and earlier stints in branded video. He said that mostly coming from the reality TV world, he was wowed by his Ringer coworkers' smarts and passion for their sports and nerd-culture jobs. The Ringer has been owned by Spotify since 2020.\n\nMcConnell said he's still trying to figure out exactly what the company's TikTok strategy will be, but he's had some success leaning on the podcast personalities the audience already trusts, like Ringer founder/CEO Bill Simmons and former NBA player Austin Rivers.\n\n\"As much as there's a sort of eye-rolling reaction among some media people when you start talking about TikTok, you can't ignore the importance of it,\" McConnell said.\n\nMost recent binge: \"My wife and I have been watching the new season of 'Fargo,' which is great. It's really dark, but really funny — Jon Hamm, he's making some pretty wild choices in that show.\"\n\nDream reboot: \"The Martian Chronicles\" by Ray Bradbury: \"That has never really been turned into anything notable. There's been a few attempts over the years, but that has always struck me as an IP that's just ripe for someone to make into a great series or movie.\"\n\n— Margaret Fleming\n\nLauren Menno, Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nA lifelong avid movie-goer, Menno finds significant meaning in her work. As VP of global talent and influencers and global digital marketing for Warner Bros. Pictures Worldwide Marketing, she captures the energy of stars to drum up excitement for new releases and the theatrical experience.\n\nFor the megahit of this past summer, \"Barbie,\" that meant making diary-style TikToks with stars Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and America Ferrera during a multi-city tour that was completed just days before the SAG-AFTRA strike ended the cast's participation in any events or marketing for the film.\n\nSince joining WB in 2016 from Maxus, an ad agency, Menno has helped steer marketing for films including \"Dune,\" \"The Batman,\" and \"Elvis.\" While \"Barbie\" might be her most visible project, it was her work on \"Elvis\" last year — she collaborated with director Baz Luhrmann and title star Austin Butler to promote the project — that helped her see the potential for the talent- and influencer-focused team she pitched to WB Pictures leadership and now runs. \"It proved the need for a specific team that's focused on that,\" said Menno, 35.\n\nMenno's job got more complicated during the Hollywood strikes, when actors couldn't promote their projects and she had to find influencers who could step in (many of whom were wary of running afoul of guild labor actions).\n\n\"It was definitely a lot of navigation — we could work with this person but not that person,\" she recalled. \"I was so supportive of the different guilds and want everyone to have exactly what they deserve. So it was wanting everything to get resolved but keeping on with what we do.\"\n\nThe coming year will bring fresh challenges, including figuring out just what's going to get people continuing to consume entertainment \"and go to an actual movie theater,\" she said. \"I love movies. I love how you're escaping. Everyone can use an escape and sometimes I think we lose sight of what they can do for us.\"\n\nMost recent binge: \"Watching 'Virgin River' (on Netflix) with my mom, we loved that show.\"\n\nGuilty entertainment pleasure: \"Bravo's 'Housewives' — reality TV is such an escape from my norm. And I'm a loser for YA dramas that are such trash but bring me such joy.\"\n\nDream reboot: \"I was a huge 'Twilight' girl so I would love to know what they're up to.\"\n\n— Lucia Moses\n\nSamantha Mustari, RadicalMedia\n\nAt age 27, Mustari says she already has her dream job: producing shows for RadicalMedia.\n\n\"What I've always wanted to do is just make stories that I care about and share them with people, and I get to do that every day,\" Mustari said.\n\nBreaking into the media industry can take decades, and in one sense, Mustari is no exception.\n\n\"I've been pursuing a career in film and television pretty much my entire life,\" she said.\n\nAfter studying film in high school, she landed at Emerson College and scored student internships at Martin Scorsese's Sikelia Productions and Amazon Studios, where she worked in casting. Upon graduation, she moved back to New York and started full-time at RadicalMedia five years ago.\n\nAs a staff producer, Mustari is a chameleon who can lead projects, write the creative, manage production, or support her colleagues filling those roles.\n\n\"My involvement varies from project to project, and I think that is really one of the coolest parts of it,\" Mustari said.\n\nEarly-career highlights for Mustari include producing \"Kennedy\" for the History Channel, an eight-part docu-series that premiered in November, as well as projects like \"Spring Awakening: Those You've Known\" on HBO and \"Summer of Soul,\" Questlove's Oscar-winning documentary that's now streaming on Hulu.\n\nMustari offered some advice for those who may be envious of what she's accomplished well shy of her 30th birthday: \"Just be a sponge — learn everything you can from everybody you can. I've been very fortunate in my career to work with and work for some really inspiring, experienced, and creative people,\" she said. \"Listening to everything they have to say and picking up lessons from their life experiences and their journeys and their career mistakes and their stories has been really, really important.\"\n\nMost recent binge: \"My favorite show at the moment is 'The Great' on Hulu with Elle Fanning and Nick Hoult — they're just incredible and really funny.\"\n\n— James Faris\n\nDiego Nájera, Participant\n\nBefore moving to the US in 2014, Nájera spent five years working for a film festival in his native Guadalajara, Mexico, and the skills he built up there have served him well as a director of narrative film at indie production company Participant. Both jobs involve \"receiving a lot of material, tracking the submissions, finding the voices, and discussing why we love something or why we think it is worthy,\" he said.\n\nThese days, attending film festivals year-round is part of the job description for Nájera, 37, who's had a hand in acquiring and shepherding features like \"Radical,\" a Sundance drama starring Eugenio Derbez that opened at No. 1 in Mexico, and the upcoming \"White Bird,\" billed as \"a spiritual sequel\" to Participant's 2017 hit \"Wonder\" (both films are adapted from books by R.J. Palacio).\n\nAs a kid, Nájera spent hours on set with his TV producer dad and dreamed of directing — the first film that wowed him was \"Back to the Future,\" and later he fell for \"Amores Perros.\" But he found his path as a producer starting at USC, where he earned an MFA, before landing at AG Studios, a company founded by top Mexican producer and financier Alex García.\n\nComing out of his MFA program and eager to tap into a like-minded industry network, Nájera cofounded his own: the Latin Tracking Board. \"What started as eight people having drinks one night ended up becoming 200,\" he said, \"all Latinos who sometimes were the only Latino in the room or in the company.\" Now dozens of the group's members have risen to become executives, he added, and many have done deals together.\n\nHollywood's current AI anxieties have a personal resonance for Nájera, who in 2020 produced a live action short, \"Please Hold,\" set entirely in an automated prison cell. The film got him in the door at Participant three years ago, and it also scored a 2022 Oscar nomination. As for the disruptive tech it highlights, Nájera said he's counting on artists to explore its impact. \"There are fascinating opportunities to tell stories about it that are gonna really help us understand where we're headed,\" he said.\n\nMost recent binge: \"'Jury Duty' (on Freevee) is so, so good. Bold, amazing idea and flawless execution.\"\n\nGuilty entertainment pleasure: \"One is 'The Great British Baking Show' (Netflix), it's a way for me to watch something completely different, and it's so wholesome and beautiful. Even though I'm not a baker. The other one would be LGBTQ soaps — it's fun for me to see young people who are queer and living their lives. As someone from the community, I love to see that representation.\"\n\n— Alison Brower\n\nJillian Novak, Xavier Salas, and Nick Walsh, Hulu\n\nPromoting Hulu's smash comedy \"Only Murders in the Building\" is a plum job — and also one that never ends, considering the show's passionate fan base. It falls to a tight crew that includes Jillian Novak, 42, creative marketing lead; Xavier Salas, 40, director, originals marketing; and Nick Walsh, 38, director, originals social media, who make sure the marketing hits the right notes, feed the show's social media presence, and work with other Disney divisions to cross-promote it — work that's helped make \"OMITB\" Hulu's most-viewed original comedy series ever.\n\nThe show's award-winning campaigns have had a larger-than-life quality. A Times Square display to promote season 2 featured the series' leads as they ascend a 3-D rendered elevator; QR codes on the display let viewers enter to win tickets to a nearby gallery with a pop-up experiential exhibit based on the show.\n\n\"It was such a visual, interactive location — it was a really great coordinated effort,\" Novak said.\n\nThe trio also feeds fans' love for mystery, whether by sneaking the show's return date into promotional copy or hiding puzzles in social posts. With the show's third season premiering amid the actors' strike this past summer, the team put more emphasis on fan engagement, a shift that may well outlast the work stoppage. \"We had to be scrappier than before. Now that the strike is over, we'll have a more comprehensive playbook,\" Novak said.\n\nNovak's other creative marketing campaigns have included \"The Kardashians,\" \"Candy\" starring Jessica Biel, and \"The D'Amelio Show\"; she previously worked in creative advertising for Sony Pictures on films as varied as \"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,\" \"Greyhound,\" and \"Blumhouse's Fantasy Island.\"\n\nOutside of \"OMITB,\" Salas has shepherded marketing for prestige dramas like the Emmy-winning \"Dopesick\" and \"Candy\" as well as comedy series \"History of the World, Part II.\" Before Hulu, he worked for Netflix on \"Stranger Things,\" \"Birdbox,\" and more.\n\nWalsh directs social campaigns for other Hulu Originals, including \"Futurama,\" \"History of the World, Part II,\" and \"The Dropout.\" Notable accomplishments included collaborating with Mel Brooks on a Reddit AMA that attracted over 2,000 questions; and partnering with Amanda Seyfried to recreate the viral success of her wacky dance from Elizabeth Holmes biopic miniseries \"The Dropout.\"\n\nWhile the trio wait for \"OMITB's\" season four, they're poring over scripts to conjure up ways to keep the audience juiced and bring in new viewers. \"That's the nature of a franchise,\" Salas said. \"It's always hard. We never rest on 'Only Murders.'\"\n\nWhat's the biggest challenge for the entertainment industry in 2024?\n\nWalsh: \"Ethical AI is going to be a big line to toe. The technology is fantastic, but consumers are wary. It would be great to use it in marketing but the moment you do, you could lose trust with the consumer.\"\n\nMost recent binge: Salas: \"Sex Education\" (Netflix) and \"Black Cake\" (Hulu)\n\nGuilty entertainment pleasure: Novak: \"I gotta be a Hulu girl with 'The Kardashians.'\" Walsh: \"I find no shame in anything, but you can catch me at 11 on TikTok. It keeps me so entertained.\"\n\n— Lucia Moses\n\nFrank Ochoa, Sony Pictures Television\n\nOchoa watched a lot of syndicated TV as a kid — one of his favorite shows was \"The Simpsons,\" so he was a natural to work in the realm of adult animation.\n\nAdult animation — a genre that Ochoa felt had been \"part of me\" after so many years growing up as an avid viewer — \"completely shaped my sense of humor, my storytelling abilities.\"\n\nAt Sony Pictures Television, Ochoa, who in late 2022 was named the studio's vice president of adult animation, has been on a rocket trajectory, integral to expanding the studio's animation endeavors — including the forthcoming series \"Universal Basic Guys,\" created by the Malamut Brothers, for Fox. Ochoa, 37, was also responsible for developing the upcoming \"Community\" movie for Peacock, which will see most of the original cast from the hit NBC sitcom (produced by SPT) return to the screen.\n\nPreviously, he served as SPT's executive director of comedy development, where he was focused on overseeing projects like the live-action adaptation of the PlayStation game \"Twisted Metal,\" which premiered as Peacock's \"most binged\" comedy debut; and \"Sausage Party,\" an animated series that earned a straight-to-series order from Amazon's Prime Video.\n\nOchoa spent his first few years after college working in physical production on unscripted content and live events. Starting out at SPT as an assistant in 2011, he reported to the head of casting at a time when the studio was producing some of its most legendary series, from \"Breaking Bad\" to \"Happy Endings.\" \"I was like, 'I'll do whatever job you guys will give me and I'll learn how all this works,'\" he recalled. \"I just want to work with people that I've always admired from afar, or I can see have that next great show in them.\"\n\nDuring his 12 years at the studio, Ochoa has received half a dozen promotions. As he spoke to BI about his journey, a motivating mantra came to mind: \"Work long enough for your idols to become your rivals,\" he said.\n\nAnd play long enough for your childhood passions to reignite. \"I was obsessed with Pokémon when I was a kid — I watched the cartoon, had the GameBoy games, had the cards,\" said Ochoa, who's the father of an 18-month-old daughter and 5-year-old boy. \"When my son got into it, I was just like, \"I'm all in.\"\n\nMost recent binge: \"'Blue Eye Samurai' on Netflix. I was really blown away by an original idea which is harder nowadays … Beautiful animation, just great writing, great performances. It showcased what animation can do.\"\n\n— Reed Alexander\n\nBrittinee Royes, NBCUniversal\n\nRoyes, 35, VP of unscripted lifestyle and docuseries at NBCUniversal Entertainment, develops and oversees productions for some of the division's most successful unscripted programming, whether it's making Oxygen a destination for true-crime buffs, training her eye on comedies like \"Celebrity Prank Wars\" (hosted by Kevin Hart and Nick Cannon for E!), or developing the three-part docuseries \"House of Kardashian\" for Peacock.\n\nThe through-line is Royes' keen sense for topical stories, which she hones by digesting an endless amount of news and culture and keeping an eye out for fresh subjects she can work with. \"I try to be aware of what's going on all day — through CNN, TMZ, Baller Alert. Reading up on what's the hottest book, what series are coming out,\" she said. \"And hoping producers continue to love us and come to us before going to Netflix or another competitor.\"\n\nTwo projects she's especially excited about are \"House of Kardashian,\" a docuseries about the rise of the family to reality royalty (Royes also previously worked on E!'s \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\"); and the four-part docuseries \"Black Pop: The Celebration of Black Pop Culture\" for E!. \"Sometimes I develop something and hand it off,\" she said, adding that \"Black Pop\" is \"really special for me because I had the opportunity to develop it and got to oversee it in series.\"\n\nGrowing up in LA, Royes was exposed to Hollywood early on and got bit by the entertainment bug when she appeared in a Nike commercial that was shot at her high school. After studying journalism in college, she landed a job at BET, where she was exposed to the unscripted world and all its variations and storytelling forms. Jobs at Lionsgate Entertainment and Oxygen Media followed.\n\nHer best career advice: \"Be a sponge. There's no bad experience.\"\n\nMost recent binge: \"I'm really into 'Black Cake' (on Hulu). It really has the go and go — there's another secret — I'm ready for whatever comes next.\"\n\nGuilty entertainment pleasure: \"'The Real Housewives of Potomac' on Bravo.\"\n\n— Lucia Moses\n\nTrevor Smith, This Machine\n\nSmith, who hails from Australia, is living out his version of the American dream.\n\nThe 38-year-old film producer is proud of the roster of documentaries he's made alongside filmmaker R.J. Cutler, his longtime business partner, with whom he co-founded This Machine Filmworks in July 2020.\n\nTo date, his biggest hits are \"Big Vape: The Rise and Fall of Juul,\" which made Netflix's weekly top-10 list, and \"Billie Eilish: The World's A Little Blurry\" on Apple TV+, which was shortlisted for an Academy Award. Watching Eilish work behind the scenes was particularly special, he said.\n\n\"I feel so lucky to be able to enter into all these worlds that I would never have the opportunity to be a part of,\" Smith said. \"I am the furthest thing from a global pop star like Billie Eilish, and yet I got to hang out with her for a bit and see what that's like.\"\n\nUpon arriving in Los Angeles for a summer program at UCLA in 2005 after graduating from Bond University in Australia, Smith got an internship with producer Larry Gordon of \"Die Hard,\" \"Predator,\" and \"Field of Dreams\" fame. That gave him insight into the entertainment industry, and, soon after, a sponsored work visa through a gig as an assistant at Gordon's company.\n\nA few years later, Smith met Cutler and started working on nonfiction projects for him at Cutler Productions. The two formed a successful partnership — so much so that they then formed their own firm.\n\nIn 2024, Smith is looking forward to unveiling documentaries about Elton John for Disney+ and Martha Stewart for Netflix. Selling projects following the strikes has been challenging, Smith said, largely because there are fewer buyers that have become more risk-averse.\n\nHowever, Smith remains confident that as long as he's making good films, the audience and money will follow.\n\n\"People are always going to gravitate towards good storytelling,\" Smith said. \"It's really about finding opportunities to tell those stories and to find projects that adhere to what buyers are looking for. That lens is smaller, but there's still great opportunity out there.\n\nMost recent binge: \"Season 2 of 'The Bear' (on Hulu) — best thing I watched this year.\"\n\n— James Faris\n\nAaron Testa, Disney\n\nIn college, Testa studied anthropology — \"I really love the study of humanity and people,\" he said — and it's a discipline that he calls upon every day as director for casting at Disney Branded Television, where he's charged with identifying talent for shows across platforms including Disney Channel, Disney Junior, and Disney+.\n\nTesta, who came to his current role in the spring of 2022 (and previously was director for talent and casting at ABC Entertainment), has developed a reputation for spotting future stars before they supernova, and produces and hosts dozens of actor workshops every year. He works with Disney's internal team and external casting directors to recruit standouts and spends much of his time scouting the Internet to figure out who those up-and-comers might be.\n\nSome examples of success stories he's recognized before they made it big: Belissa Escobedo, an actress in her mid-20s whom Testa spotted during a workshop he helped organize in 2018 — she's since gone on to hold roles in Disney+'s 2022 \"Hocus Pocus 2\" and DC Studios' \"Blue Beetle.\" He's also helped discover or boost actors who have gone on to projects like \"The Marvels\" and Netflix's \"Luckiest Girl Alive,\" which starred Mila Kunis.\n\nMore recently, he conjured the idea of bringing back two stars of Disney's 1997 adaptation of \"Cinderella\" — Brandy Norwood and Paolo Montalban — to play the princess and her beloved King Charming in the upcoming film \"Descendants: The Rise of Red,\" which is set to debut on Disney+.\n\nTo Testa, representation of diverse constituencies is key. It's a commitment instilled in him in the late '90s, watching \"Cinderella,\" when he found himself connecting with the performance by Montalban, who shares Testa's Filipino heritage (the 32-year-old said he's recently been brushing up on Filipino dishes like adobo). \"That was the first time I saw myself and I was like, 'Oh wow, seeing myself on screen — that's not a specific stereotype,\" he said. \"I don't have to be at school being teased for being a certain way. And I think that really shaped my worldview.'\"\n\nMost recent binge: \"Gen V\" on Amazon Prime Video\n\nGuilty entertainment pleasure: \"I would have to say movie musicals — because it's a beautiful escape to be swept up in music and dance and story.\"\n\n— Reed Alexander\n\nDaniel Wiener, Antoinette Media\n\nWiener is \"violently allergic to dogs,\" he told BI. But that didn't stop him from hitting dog parks, pet stores, and other dangerous places for one of his first gigs in entertainment: casting on the 2000s Animal Planet series \"It's Me or the Dog,\" which featured families being torn apart by disruptive pups.\n\nThat relentlessness is key to Wiener's success with one of reality TV's most enduring franchises: MTV's \"Love and Hip Hop.\" He's been involved with the series since its 2011 launch and now oversees the Atlanta flagship and multiple spinoffs — along with \"Caught in the Act: Unfaithful\" and more — as VP of programming at Antoinette Media, which launched in 2020 as a joint venture with Paramount Global by longtime producer Lashan Browning.\n\nWiener, 37, grew up in New Jersey with a TV news producer dad and a mom who wrote on multiple series for Nickelodeon and Comedy Central, but he studied business in college and planned to build a career in music. Still, he always loved TV — \"my best friend and my babysitter,\" he said — and found his way to a role that combines the two worlds and keeps him on his toes.\n\n\"When you're delivering a show like 'Love and Hip Hop' or 'Caught in the Act: Unfaithful,' where it's 24 episodes shot over the better course of the year, there's inevitable hurdles and obstacles,\" he said. \"It's always something, nothing's ever done in a straight line.\"\n\nWhile Antoinette owns large blocks of MTV and VH1 primetime with its unscripted programming, the company has big ambitions to expand into scripted series, documentary, and more. That doesn't leave a lot of bandwidth for hand-wringing and debate about issues like the threat of AI, Wiener noted. While he and his colleagues keep an eye on the emerging tech, their focus is on \"whatever actual intelligence we still have and putting it to work,\" he said with a laugh. \"We're not ready for the artificial stuff yet.\"\n\nLatest binge: \"'Squid Game: The Challenge' (on Netflix), the high-concept competition show where they spared no expense — it was so impressive. The fun part about it is, it's just like the [scripted] show, they really got it right.\"\n\nGuilty entertainment pleasure: \"I go down the YouTube rabbit hole and start watching how-to videos of things that I'm never going to do. I'm never going to cook but 10 minutes after I watch a video I can tell you how to cook jerk chicken, or I'll learn how to do magic tricks or learn how to do an NBA crossover.\"\n\n— Alison Brower\n\nEmerald Wright-Collie, Sony Pictures TV\n\nGrowing up in Miami with 10 siblings, Wright-Collie found herself in a perpetually losing battle to win control over the television remote. But having little agency over what to watch may actually have been the seed of her future career as a creative executive overseeing the development of animated content.\n\nIndeed, watching cartoons like \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" and \"The Berenstain Bears\" exposed Wright-Collie, 29, to children's programming she fell in love with. After a post-college stint as a sixth grade English teacher in Manhattan and volunteering for the New York International Children's Film Festival, she decided to dive into making original IP.\n\nNow, the writer and producer, who's based in Brooklyn, serves as the director of creative content for Sony Pictures Television's kids' division, where she's won two Emmy and two Annie Awards for her work on the Netflix fantasy adventure series \"Hilda.\" Other series under her supervision include the upcoming \"Vamos,\" based on a picture book collection she discovered and is in the process of adapting for air.\n\nOne key responsibility execs in children's programming face is to reconcile instilling values and virtues with the imperative to entertain. \"It's really important to make sure that you are opening their eyes to worlds, narratives, and experiences that they've never seen before, because it's what allows them to grow and be enriched as a human being,\" Wright-Collie explained. Developing rich characters is key, giving viewers the opportunity \"to meet another character that looks different than them and learn about that character's narrative and that character's world naturally, and through a very magical way.\"\n\nAt Sony, Wright-Collie's career has been on a red-hot streak — she advanced from creative assistant to series producer and director of creative content in just three years. Her personal time is also rich with creative pursuits, from crochet to piano to painting watercolors in the park. Along the way, she's made a point of staying open to constructive feedback — an attribute she credits as integral to both her personal growth and professional development.\n\nHer philosophy? Break it down into three phases: Highlight the positive aspects of the feedback, highlight and define the learning points, and then apply the feedback to the next objective. \"You always give yourself an opportunity to reflect on those things — what you did really well, what you could improve on and evolve in, and then applying it to the next window so that you can continuously grow,\" she said.\n\nMost recent binge: \"'Law & Order: SVU' — every night I watch. My mom watched it a lot, so I've been watching it since I was young.\"\n\nGuilty entertainment pleasure: \"'Selling Sunset' — I'm not typically one to gravitate toward reality TV, but there is really something about the twins and their business perspective and their entrepreneurship that really hooks me into the series.\"\n\n— Reed Alexander"
