        "text": "CHARLES (CHARLIE) GWATHMEY, FAIA (1938-2009)\n\nGwathmey was a native of Charlotte NC. His mother was the sister of Walter Hook, a Charlotte architect whose work included Mercy Hospital, Carolinas Medical Center, Presbyterian Hospital, and the Veteran's Administration Hospital in Salisbury. Gwathmey's grandfather was C. C. Hook who designed projects at Duke University over 30 years. After his family moved to New York City, he attended the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Performing Arts, graduating in 1956. He studied architecture at the University of Pennsylvania and Yale University, receiving a Master of Architecture degree in 1962 at the latter. At Yale, he studied under Paul Rudolph and won both the Winchester Travelling Fellowship and a Fulbright Grant. From 1962-1963 he worked for Candilis Josic Woods in Paris; from 1963-1964 at George Nemeny Architects in New York, and from 1964-1966 for Edward Larrabee Barnes in New York.\n\nIn 1966 he rose to fame for a house and studio for his parents in Amagansett NY. Gwathmey was not a licensed architect at the time. When he did take the professional licensing exam, he was surprised to see a multiple-choice question on the test that asked \"Which of these is the organic house?\" The choices included the house he designed for his parents. He wanted to answer that the organic house was his, but in order to pass the exam he chose Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater House. He knew that was the answer they wanted. He passed the test.\n\nGwathmey went into partnership with Richard Henderson, left, to form Gwathmey and Henderson Architects. In 1968, the firm became Gwathmey Henderson and Siegel with the addition of Robert Siegel. After Henderson's departure in 1970, Gwathmey Siegel & Associates was established. He was one of the New York Five (with Michael Graves, Peter Eisenman, Richard Meier, and John Hejduk) who dominated Modernist architecture in the 1960s with mostly white buildings, clean lines, and minimal ornament. They were the subject of the 1969 CASE (Conference of Architects for the Study of the Environment) meeting at the Museum of Modern Art and a 1972 book, The New York Five.\n\nGwathmey was honored with the Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1970) and elected to the Academy of Fellows (1976). In 1983, he won the Medal of Honor from the New York Chapter of the AIA. In 1985, he received the first Yale Alumni Arts Award from the Yale School of Architecture. Three years later, the Guild Hall Academy of Arts awarded Gwathmey its Lifetime Achievement Medal in Visual Arts. In 1990 he received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the New York State Society of Architects.\n\nFrom 1965 through 1991, Gwathmey taught at Pratt Institute, Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, Princeton University, Columbia University, the University of Texas, and UCLA. He was Davenport Professor and Bishop Professor at Yale, and the Eliot Noyes Visiting Professor at Harvard University. In 2005, he served as the William A. Bernoudy Resident in Architecture at the American Academy in Rome. Gwathmey's first marriage, to Emily Gwathmey, ended in divorce; they had one daughter, Annie Gwathmey. He married Bette-Ann Damson in 1974 who donated his archives to Yale in 2010. 1980 interview.\n\nOne of his most famous designs is the 1992 renovation/addition of Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum in New York.\n\nHis North Carolina buildings are:\n\nThe 1994 Rubenstein-Silvers Hillel Center at Duke University in Durham.\n\nThe UNC-Charlotte School of Architecture (designed with Ferebee Walters) in Charlotte.\n\nThe 2002 Louise Cameron Wells Museum of Art in Wilmington.
