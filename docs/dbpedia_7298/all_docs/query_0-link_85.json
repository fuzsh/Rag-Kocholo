        "text": "01 of 32\n\n1883 (2021–2022)\n\nWhen Taylor Sheridan sought to expand the universe of his hit contemporary Western drama Yellowstone, he delved into the region's past and the Dutton family's first forays into their eventual homeland. 1883 features real-life couple Tim McGraw and Faith Hill as James and Margaret Dutton, who endure an arduous journey alongside their family and immigrant settlers as part of a wagon train run by crusty Civil War veteran Shea Brennan. Crackling with interpersonal drama and hard truths about living off the land, 1883 offers a compelling glimpse into another time. And it doesn't stop there: Sheridan further expanded the Yellowstone universe with 1923, another Paramount+ prequel series starring Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren as Jacob and Cara Dutton. —Johnny Loftus\n\nWhere to watch 1883: Paramount+\n\nCast: Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Sam Elliott, Isabel May, LaMonica Garrett, Audie Rick, Marc Rissman, James Landry Hérbert, Gratiela Brancusi, Anna Fiamora\n\n02 of 32\n\nThe Amazing Race (2001–present)\n\nOne of the reality TV stalwarts of the 2000s is still going strong all these years later. The Amazing Race features teams of two racing around the world and navigating unfamiliar countries — without the benefit of Google Maps. Each leg of the race features location-specific challenges, competing in Detours and Roadblocks while hoping to not be the last team to check in at the Pit Stop at the end of every episode, which typically results in elimination. With teams eliminated one by one, the ultimate winning pair receives a $1 million cash prize, but the fun of the show isn't always the destination so much as the journey along the way, showcasing vibrant cultures and contestants pushing themselves outside their comfort zones.\n\nBecause of the nature of the show, you don't have to start from the beginning and watch in order, but every season is available on Paramount+ through the recently concluded 36th race. —Kevin Jacobsen\n\nWhere to watch The Amazing Race: Paramount+\n\nCast: Phil Keoghan\n\n03 of 32\n\nAvatar: The Last Airbender (2005–2008)\n\nWhile multiple live-action versions have been mounted over the years, none can compare to the original Avatar: The Last Airbender. The animated series follows the epic saga of Aang, a 12-year-old boy blessed with the ability to manipulate all four elements — water, earth, fire, and air, each represented by a corresponding nation — and his efforts to provide peace amid the Fire Nation's attempted takeover. Frequently hailed as one of the best animated series ever made, Avatar's greatest quality is its ability to immerse you in its richly drawn world. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Avatar: The Last Airbender: Paramount+\n\nCast: Zach Tyler Eisen, Mae Whitman, Jack DeSena, Dante Basco, Michaela Jill Murphy, Dee Bradley Baker, Mako, Greg Baldwin, Grey DeLisle, Mark Hamill\n\n04 of 32\n\nBeverly Hills, 90210 (1990–2000)\n\nBeverly Hills, 90210 made a quiet splash in 1990 and soon earned success after embracing a more teen-centric plot — perfectly timed with other networks pausing their programming for Gulf War reporting — which propelled the show into pop culture stardom. Nestled against the lush backdrop of Beverly Hills, the series chronicles a tight-knit friend group's evolution from adolescence to grown-up realities across 10 seasons, overcoming several cast rotations while mainstays Jennie Garth, Tori Spelling, Brian Austin Green, and Ian Ziering anchored its entirety. But beyond the allure of West Coast glamour and trivial affairs, this show dove headfirst into societal issues such as homophobia, racism, body image, sexual assault, and more, laying the cornerstone for the teen drama genre we know and love today. —James Mercadante\n\nWhere to watch Beverly Hills, 90210: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nCast: Jason Priestley, Shannen Doherty, Jennie Garth, Ian Ziering, Gabrielle Carteris, Luke Perry, Brian Austin Green, Douglas Emerson, Tori Spelling, Carol Potter, James Eckhouse, Joe E. Tata\n\n05 of 32\n\nBig Brother (2000–present)\n\nFor millions of fans, it isn't summer without the three-month obsession that is Big Brother. The cutthroat reality series traps a group of contestants in a house together with no contact with the outside world. The houseguests compete in challenges for the power to nominate others for eviction and vote each other out one by one.\n\nUnlike Survivor, its fellow long-running reality competition companion, Big Brother doesn't take itself too seriously. In fact, it can be outright cartoonish sometimes, with goofy costumes, challenges, and twists aplenty. But, for diehard fans, there's nothing like watching the season unfold week to week, with live feeds of the house also available to stream 24/7 on Paramount+. Season 26 is airing now on CBS and Paramount+ — as always, we should expect the unexpected. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Big Brother: Paramount+\n\nCast: Julie Chen Moonves\n\n06 of 32\n\nThe Challenge (1998–present)\n\nWhile there are plenty reality competition shows across a multitude of streamers, MTV stands tall with its magnum opus, The Challenge, which Paramount+ offers starting with 2005's 10th season. What initially began as a humble spinoff affair for The Real World and Road Rules has since blossomed into the ultimate television crossover event. The Challenge now plays host to a diverse roster of reality stars plucked from a smorgasbord of shows including Survivor, Are You the One?, American Ninja Warrior, Big Brother, Love Island, and more. An ever-evolving competition, contestants are thrown into the gauntlet, playing in teams or flying solo while tackling a myriad of missions in their quest for game supremacy and cash prizes. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch The Challenge: Paramount+\n\n07 of 32\n\nCheers (1982–1993)\n\nLooking for \"a place where everybody knows your name?\" Swing by the iconic Boston bar owned by none other than Sam \"Mayday\" Malone, a former Red Sox pitcher who serves up drinks alongside a captivating crew of regulars who later take up a lot of screen time. (As EW's critic wrote, \"For a show without a center, Cheers is still awfully funny.\") With sharp dialogue, masterful physical comedy, and characters you can't help but root for, this show amassed 28 Emmys and four Golden Globes — and had the second-most-watched series finale of all time. Let's raise a glass to that! —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Cheers: Paramount+\n\nCast: Ted Danson, Shelley Long, Nicholas Colasanto, Rhea Perlman, George Wendt, John Ratzenberger, Kelsey Grammer, Woody Harrelson, Kirstie Alley, Bebe Neuwirth\n\n08 of 32\n\nColin From Accounts (2022–present)\n\nThis quirky romantic Australian series follows the meeting of two people and the dog they come to share. It all begins when Gordon (Patrick Brammall) nearly runs over Ashley (Harriet Dyer), who impulsively flashes him in return. This leads to Gordon accidentally hitting a stray dog in the road, and the panicked pair try to attend to him — eventually naming him Colin — and form an unexpected connection in the process. Infused with clever humor and infectious chemistry between the two leads (Brammall and Dyer are married in real life), Colin From Accounts is one of the more underrated comedies streaming today. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Colin From Accounts: Paramount+\n\nCast: Patrick Brammall, Harriet Dyer\n\n09 of 32\n\nThe Daily Show (1996–present)\n\nThe Daily Show has seen more than a few reinventions since it first hit Comedy Central airwaves in 1996. The infotainment variety series, which discusses the hot-button issues of the day with a comedic slant, has long been a welcome reprieve for political news junkies. After leaving his post in 2015, Jon Stewart returned to the desk in 2024 — just in time for another tumultuous presidential election — to host Monday episodes, with fan-favorite correspondents hosting the rest of the week's shows. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Daily Show: Paramount+\n\nCast: Jon Stewart, Desi Lydic, Ronny Chieng, Michael Kosta, Dulcé Sloan, Troy Iwata, Grace Kuhlenschmidt, Josh Johnson, Lewis Black, Jordan Klepper, Leslie Jones, Charlamagne tha God\n\n10 of 32\n\nDrunk History (2013–2019)\n\nThink of it as the most entertaining history lesson you've ever had. Adapting the Funny or Die web series of the same name, Drunk History invites actors and comedians to retell stories about political figures, while inebriated. Meanwhile, the show features actors (including many famous faces) re-enacting the story in the reteller's own slurred, giggle-ridden words. Only the fourth through sixth seasons are available on Paramount+, but there's plenty of fascinating history to learn about at your disposal — just don't take any of the character dialogue as gospel. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Drunk History: Paramount+\n\nCast: Derek Waters, Bennie Arthur, Tim Baltz, Maria Blasucci, Mort Burke, Michael Cera, Sarah Burns, Craig Cackowski, Michael Cassady, Michael Coleman, Aasha Davis, Tymberlee Hill, Adam Nee, JT Palmer, Greg Tuculescu\n\n11 of 32\n\nEverybody Loves Raymond (1996–2005)\n\nFamily sitcoms had been done to death even by the time Everybody Loves Raymond premiered in 1996, but its well-observed writing and perfectly assembled cast elevated it to true comedy gold. The titular Raymond, or, \"Ray\" (Ray Romano), is a Long Island sportswriter whose evasion of household responsibilities gets him into conflict with his beleaguered wife, Debra (Patricia Heaton). They also have to contend with Ray's parents, overbearing Marie (Doris Roberts) and blunt Frank (Peter Boyle), alongside Ray's older brother Robert (Brad Garrett), who all frequently bring the drama to Ray and Debra's home. The family's suburban struggles make for brilliant comedic tension as each episode feels like live theater; it's no wonder the show was showered with Emmys during its time, including wins for Romano, Heaton, Roberts, and Garrett. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Everybody Loves Raymond: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nCast: Ray Romano, Patricia Heaton, Brad Garrett, Doris Roberts, Peter Boyle, Madylin Sweeten\n\n12 of 32\n\nEvil (2019–present)\n\nShe's a forensic psychologist who's visited by demons in her dreams. He's a proponent of hallucinogenic drugs who's studying to be a Catholic priest. Together, they explore what's bogus vs. what's real about supernatural events and the dark side of faith. Katja Herbers stars alongside Mike Colter on Evil, an inventive, wild, and often sidesplitting take on an X-Files-style setup that migrated from CBS to Paramount+ around its third season.\n\nEW's critic praised the series for its abundance of \"sheer acting talent and narrative trickery built into every episode. Colter remains impossibly charming as a decent person whose spiritual confidence masks profound insecurities,\" while \"Herbers is a dream of witty toughness and parental anxiety, balancing daily concerns about her children with a curiosity about the bizarre world her cases open up.\" —J.L.\n\nWhere to watch Evil: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nCast: Katja Herbers, Mike Colter, Aasif Mandvi, Kurt Fuller, Marti Matulis, Brooklyn Shuck, Skylar Gray, Maddy Crocco, Dalya Knapp, Christine Lahti, Michael Emerson, Ashley Edner, Andrea Martin\n\n13 of 32\n\nFrasier (1993–2004)\n\nPsychiatry extraordinaire Frasier Crane can be found on the airwaves through this beloved Cheers spinoff series (which has now returned for a revival on Paramount+). After leaving his life and marriage in Boston, the eponymous character relocates to Seattle, where he reunites with his father — a retired detective sidelined by a gunshot wound to the hip — and his younger brother/fellow psychiatrist, Niles. There, he procures a new gig as a radio show host, offering psychiatric advice to occasional surprise callers from famous voices.\n\nWith an impressive haul of 37 Emmys, including five consecutive Outstanding Comedy Series awards, Frasier's true essence lies in its family dynamics between Fraiser and Niles, which EW's critic described as \"the most hilarious and poignant siblings on television\" because of their \"lofty, melancholy, yet funny exchanges [that] represent the least typical joke-writing.\" —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Frasier: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Kelsey Grammer, Jane Leeves, David Hyde Pierce, Peri Gilpin, John Mahoney, Dan Butler\n\n14 of 32\n\nFreaks and Geeks (1999–2000)\n\nIt's unforgivable that the show that launched the careers of James Franco, Linda Cardellini, Seth Rogen, Jason Segel, and more fell victim to NBC's premature cancellation during its first season. (\"Is it just me, or does the whole world suck?\") In a mere 18 episodes, this sleeper hit gem left a lasting imprint on viewers across generations and earned cult status over the years.\n\nCreated by Paul Feig and executive produced by Judd Apatow — who went on to harness the talents of this ensemble in subsequent projects — Freaks and Geeks is the coming-of-age tale of a high school mathlete who joins a clique of music-loving, pot-smoking burnouts, while her nerdy younger brother steers through the perils of freshman year. As EW's critic wrote, the series' authentically nuanced portrayal of teen life \"embodies all of its contradictions, craziness, hopes, and fears,\" and is one of those rare sitcoms that \"sustains funniness for its full 60 minutes.\" —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Freaks and Geeks: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nCast: Linda Carellini, John Francis Daley, James Franco, Seth Rogen, Jason Segel, Samm Levine, Martin Starr, Becky Ann Baker, Joe Flaherty, Busy Philipps\n\n15 of 32\n\nGhosts (2021–present)\n\nMarried couple Sam (Rose McIver) and Jay (Utkarsh Ambudkar) move into an idyllic country house only to discover it's overrun by ghosts who all died on the property. Sounds like the makings of your standard haunted house thriller, but Ghosts, adapted from the U.K. series of the same name, isn't interested in scaring anyone. The single-camera sitcom follows the various hijinks of the ghosts — all trapped in the outfits they wore at the time of their deaths — as they try to get a handle on the modern world; meanwhile, Sam and Jay deal with the fact that the former can see and hear the ghosts while the latter cannot. While there are plenty of laughs to be had, the series also doesn't shy away from emotional moments, as the ghosts try to make peace with their deaths to move on to the afterlife. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Ghosts: Paramount+\n\nCast: Rose McIver, Utkarsh Ambudkar, Brandon Scott Jones, Danielle Pinnock, Richie Moriarty, Asher Grodman, Sheila Carrasco, Devan Chandler Long, Rebecca Wisocky, Román Zaragoza\n\n16 of 32\n\nThe Good Fight (2017–2022)\n\nBrilliantly acted, often satirical, and furiously contemporary, The Good Fight follows in the footsteps of the hit CBS legal drama The Good Wife (see below). This spinoff tracks the rise and fall of the whip-smart, fabulously dressed attorney Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), who joins the across-town firm of Reddick, Boseman & Kolstad alongside Good Wife veteran Lucca Quinn.\n\nAlso starring Rose Leslie and featuring a strong ensemble cast, the series debuted its first four seasons on CBS All Access and its remaining two on Paramount+. With frequent animated musical asides, its final season's \"civil war\" concept, and powerhouse talent additions like John Slattery and Andre Braugher, The Good Fight always keeps things interesting. —J.L.\n\nWhere to watch The Good Fight: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nCast: Christine Baranski, Cush Jumbo, Erica Tazel, Rose Leslie, Delroy Lindo\n\n17 of 32\n\nThe Good Wife (2009–2016)\n\nArt truly mirrors life on The Good Wife, where married showrunners Robert and Michelle King drew inspiration from a weirdly specific yet all-too-familiar pattern of political scandals involving prominent male politicians cheating on their lawyer wives. After years of embracing the role of the self-sacrificing mother and spouse, Georgetown graduate Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) is forced to resurrect her legal career as a junior litigator after her high-profile husband is sentenced to jail for misusing state funds for prostitutes.\n\nBoldly shattering the television mold, The Good Wife introduced audiences to a remarkably complex and unapologetically flawed female protagonist, and was hailed by EW's critic as \"a non-genre series that drops Easter eggs and rewards careful viewing; a program that led the conversation on issues like cybersecurity and political graft; and a show that explored the romantic lives of 40- and 50-year-olds, but not for laughs.\" —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch The Good Wife: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nCast: Julianna Margulies, Josh Charles, Christine Baranski, Chris Noth, Matt Czuchry, Archie Panjabi, Zach Grenier, Matthew Goode, Cush Jumbo, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Alan Cumming\n\n18 of 32\n\nHalo (2022–present)\n\nBringing the vast landscape of the smash hit Halo video games to the screen was a challenge accepted by executive producer Steven Spielberg. Pablo Schreiber stars as resolute supersoldier Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, who becomes involved in humanity's 26th-century struggle against an aggressive bunch of aliens known as the Covenant. Joining Schieber's Master Chief in the United Nations Space Command are Olive Gray's Commander Miranda Keyes and Natascha McElhone's brilliant scientist Dr. Elizabeth Halsey.\n\nIf you want world-building, Halo's got you covered. And if you want sci-fi action, that's here, too. But what might surprise you most about the series is the level of humanity Schreiber brings to his Master Chief. Season 2, which many critics agreed to be an improvement upon the first, concluded in March. —J.L.\n\nWhere to watch Halo: Paramount+\n\nCast: Pablo Schreiber, Olive Gray, Shabana Azmi, Natascha McElhone, Bokeem Woodbine\n\n19 of 32\n\nThe Hills (2006–2010)\n\nAh, the iconic moment etched into every millennial's memory: Lauren Conrad confronting Heidi Montag with a resounding \"You know what you did!\" at Les Deux nightclub. Conrad's fame began with her gig on Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County, but what really catapulted her to reality TV royalty was her very own spinoff series, which perfectly captured the era of velour tracksuits and side-swept bangs. From Conrad's internship at Teen Vogue to all of the nights spent at the hottest spots, The Hills not only offered a glimpse into the world of Y2K fashion but also the entertaining escapades of twentysomethings navigating Los Angeles' glittering playground.\n\nWhile you're at it, extend your nostalgic time travel trip with The Hills' 2019 spinoff, New Beginnings. (Even if it did end up hitting the brakes after two seasons, remember: \"The rest is still unwritten.\") —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch The Hills: Paramount+\n\nCast: Lauren Conrad, Heidi Montag, Audrina Patridge, Whitney Port, Kristin Cavallari, Lo Bosworth, Stephanie Pratt\n\n20 of 32\n\nI Love Lucy (1951–1957)\n\nTime to break out your great big bottle of \"Vitameatavegamin.\" In a bold move that defied the norms of its time, Lucille Ball insisted that her real-life Cuban-American husband, Desi Arnaz, should play her onscreen spouse on what would become the sitcom of all sitcoms. This timeless comedic tandem — where Lucy's zany antics collided with Ricky's straitlaced demeanor — kept generations in stitches for a remarkable 180 episodes. Not only did I Love Lucy unapologetically thrust the once-taboo themes of interracial marriage and pregnancy into the spotlight, but it also clinched four Emmys and the esteemed position of being an inaugural inductee into the Television Academy Hall of Fame — cementing its status as a quintessential TV classic. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch I Love Lucy: Paramount+\n\nCast: Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance, William Frawley, Richard Keith\n\n21 of 32\n\nKey & Peele (2012–2015)\n\nWhile Jordan Peele continues to churn out acclaimed psychological horror movies (including Get Out, Us, and Nope), and Keegan-Michael Key takes the lead on whimsical series like Apple TV+'s Schmigadoon, it's absolutely essential to rewind to their roots on their Emmy-winning sketch variety show. Following in the footsteps of iconic comedy duos, this dynamic pair possesses an electric synergy that's fit for endless material, including \"Meegan, come back!\" and the substitute teacher who creatively butchers every student's name.\n\nAlthough Key & Peele wrapped in 2015, the comedy counterparts' friendship continues to conjure onscreen magic, with projects like Keanu (2016), Toy Story 4 (2019), and Wendell & Wild (2022), and an ever-growing list of joint ventures. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Key & Peele: Paramount+\n\nCast: Keegan-Michael Key, Jordan Peele\n\n22 of 32\n\nNathan for You (2013–2017)\n\nMeet Nathan Fielder, the star graduate from one of Canada's top business schools (with really good grades, naturally). On this Comedy Central docu-reality series — co-created with Michael Koman — Fielder portrays an oddball caricature of himself, using his business acumen and a patchwork of life experiences for a noble mission. Aiming to rescue small businesses from financial ruin, his well-intentioned (and objectively absurd) efforts often turn into inevitable chaos. From pitches for poo-flavored frozen yogurt to a budget electronics store accessible only through comically tiny doors, Nathan's well of wild ideas never runs dry. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Nathan for You: Paramount+\n\nCast: Nathan Fielder\n\n23 of 32\n\nThe Offer (2022)\n\nMuch has been written about the notoriously difficult production of Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 war epic Apocalypse Now, but another iconic film of his had its fair share of turmoil, too. This 10-episode miniseries follows the difficult process of making The Godfather (1972), and all the warring egos behind the scenes, including Coppola (Dan Fogler), producer Al Ruddy (Miles Teller), and maverick studio executive Robert Evans (a scene-stealing Matthew Goode). It's a fascinating look at all the blood, sweat, and tears that went into the making of a classic. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Offer: Paramount+\n\nCast: Miles Teller, Matthew Goode, Dan Fogler, Burn Gorman, Colin Hanks, Giovanni Ribisi, Juno Temple\n\n24 of 32\n\nRuPaul's Drag's Race (2009–present)\n\nRight alongside CBS stalwarts like Survivor, The Amazing Race, and Big Brother, RuPaul's Drag Race has become a reality TV institution. While RuPaul and company set out each season to crown America's next drag superstar, even those who don't win have become major figures in the industry, including Shangela, Alaska, and Peppermint. You can now binge all 16 seasons on Paramount+ — prepare to be gagged. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch RuPaul's Drag Race: Paramount+\n\nCast: RuPaul, Merle Ginsberg, Santino Rice, Michelle Visage, Billy B, Ross Mathews, Carson Kressley, Ts Madison\n\n25 of 32\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants (1999–present)\n\nLet's go back to 1999, when a certain absorbent, yellow, and porous fellow made his debut in a pineapple under the sea. And more than (cue the time card) two decades later, SpongeBob SquarePants is still riding the Nickelodeon waves, earning its place as one of the longest-running animated series alongside the likes of The Simpsons and South Park. Our ever-optimistic fry cook continues to radiate his \"Best Day Ever\" energy in the whimsical Bikini Bottom, where he embarks on hilarious escapades alongside his eclectic crew — including a slightly clueless starfish, a penny-pinching crustacean, a grouchy squid, and a science-savvy squirrel.\n\nWith its effervescent humor and never-ending supply of underwater adventures, SpongeBob is a timeless delight that has kept generations entertained, and even led them to adopt nautical catchphrases like \"Barnacles\" or \"Oh, tartar sauce\" into their swear vocabulary. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch SpongeBob SquarePants: Paramount+\n\nCast: Tom Kenny, Rodger Bumpass, Bill Fagerbakke, Clancy Brown, Mr. Lawrence, Dee Bradley Baker, Carolyn Lawrence, Jill Talley, Mary Jo Catlett\n\n26 of 32\n\nStar Trek: Discovery (2017–2024)\n\nParamount+ contains hundreds of hours of Star Trek movies and shows, with Discovery being the streamer's first foray into original Trekkie-friendly programming. A prequel to Star Trek: The Original Series, Discovery follows Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green), a Vulcan-raised human whose mutiny on the USS Shenzhou caused her to be detained and imprisoned, until she is reassigned to the USS Discovery. EW's critic praised Martin-Green's performance from the start: \"She is a commanding presence, weary and excited, bemused and desperate, never less than fully engaged.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Star Trek: Discovery: Paramount+\n\nCast: Sonequa Martin-Green, Doug Jones, Shazad Latif, Anthony Rapp, Mary Wiseman, Jason Isaacs, Wilson Cruz, Anson Mount, David Ajala, Rachael Ancheril, Blu del Barrio, Tig Notaro\n\n27 of 32\n\nStar Trek: The Next Generation (1987–1994)\n\nFor those yearning to \"live long and prosper,\" the third voyage of the Star Trek TV franchise beckons. While behind-the-scenes turbulence initially threatened the journey — artistic conflicts between Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and writers and producers almost deprived us of Patrick Stewart's legendary Captain Picard — Star Trek: The Next Generation transports viewers into a new era of interstellar exploration aboard the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D). Here, a novel crew of Starfleet officers embarks on exhilarating missions through unexplored territories.\n\nAs noted by EW's critic, \"There is a whole galaxy of explanations for why people respond to Next Generation. The thrills and chills of space travel, the vivid depictions of brave new alien worlds and civilizations, the sheer drama of blasting into the unknown — these are also powerful reasons to tune in.\" —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Star Trek: The Next Generation: Paramount+\n\nCast: Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, LeVar Burton, Marina Sirtis, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, Majel Barrett, Wil Wheaton\n\n28 of 32\n\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds (2022–present)\n\nAmong a bright cast of new helmspeople, medical officers, and engineers, Anson Mount spearheads this Star Trek: Discovery spinoff series as Christopher Pike, captain of the USS Enterprise during the years before the events of the original show. And yes, Spock is here, too. Strange New Worlds has received high marks for its production design, with its kicky riffs on 1960s aesthetics as well as its further development of characters that have been around for more than half a century. —J.L.\n\nWhere to watch Star Trek: Strange New Worlds: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nCast: Anson Mount, Ethan Peck, Jess Bush, Christina Chong, Rebecca Romijn, Celia Rose Gooding, Melissa Navia, Babs Olusanmokun, Bruce Horak\n\n29 of 32\n\nSurvivor (2000–present)\n\nThe EW tribe has spoken: You should watch Survivor. Hosted by Jeff Probst, the gripping reality competition series plucks contestants from their comfort zones, dumping them at remote locations where they must unleash their inner warriors. As they navigate an intense blend of physical and mental challenges for rewards and immunity, their strategic skills are tested through calculated votes for eliminations, ultimately leaving one \"sole survivor\" standing with a million-dollar prize. From Sue Hawk's unforgettable \"rat and snake\" speech in season 1 to the blindsiding of Erik Reichenbach in season 16 to the scheming antics of supervillain Russell Hantz in season 19, the show has been generating iconic moments since its 2000 debut.\n\nDon't be daunted by the number of seasons; you can leap in at any point, but why not start from the beginning? If it somehow doesn't click, you can bring us your torch. The recently aired 46th season is now available to binge, with season 47 to premiere on Sept. 18. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Survivor: Paramount+\n\nCast: Jeff Probst\n\n30 of 32\n\nThe Twilight Zone (1959–1964)\n\nYour next stop: the Twilight Zone! Courtesy of the Emmy- and Golden Globe-winning mind of Rod Serling, this sci-fi/horror anthology series is arguably one of the greatest TV shows to ever exist. Each half-hour episode unpacks a self-contained saga where characters grapple with phantasmagorical forces, ultimately culminating in unforeseeable twists that typically reveal profound moral truths. While it bears the hallmarks of its era, its evergreen appeal and visionary ingenuity continue to delight viewers and inspire auteurs — as evidenced by the numerous attempts to resurrect its magic, most recently Jordan Peele's 2019 reboot. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch The Twilight Zone: Paramount+\n\nCast: Rod Serling\n\n31 of 32\n\nTwin Peaks (1990–1991)\n\nIn an era of formulaic network television, oddball director David Lynch (Eraserhead, Blue Velvet) emerged as the perfect visionary to reshape the medium with this genre-bending series co-created by Mark Frost. With its pioneering introduction of season-long murder mysteries, innovative camerawork, music by Angelo Badalamenti, and surreal aesthetics, this tour de force — a part-neo-noir, part-supernatural horror, part-comedy — marked an unprecedented achievement in small-screen storytelling, as its unfading influence pops up on shows like Riverdale, Stranger Things, and more.\n\nTwin Peaks engrosses its viewers in the titular town, where, amidst its eccentric citizens, FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper investigates the murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer. For more twisted mysteries, Paramount+ also offers the 2017 revival series, Twin Peaks: The Return, a cinematic experience that pushes the boundaries of TV even further. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Twin Peaks: Paramount+\n\nCast: Kyle MacLachlan, Michael Ontkean, Mädchen Amick, Dana Ashbrook, Richard Beymer, Lara Flynn Boyle, Sherilyn Fenn, Warren Frost, Peggy Lipton, Joan Chen, Everett McGill, Kimmy Robertson, Ray Wise, Piper Laurie\n\n32 of 32\n\nYO! MTV Raps (2022)\n\nParamount+ has really leaned into society's collective need for nostalgia, offering a suite of updated, MTV-derived programming. YO! MTV Raps is one of the latest legacy titles to resurface, joining Behind the Music, which appeared on the streamer in 2021. Back in the '80s, Fab 5 Freddy and André \"Doctor Dré\" Brown were the ringleaders for the show's rambunctious mix of live segments, interviews, and rap video programming, but while the content remains the same, this YO! MTV Raps reboot features DJs Conceited and Diamond Kuts as hosts, who welcome guests like singer Freddie Gibbs and rapper Latto. —J.L.\n\nWhere to watch YO! MTV Raps: Paramount+\n\nCast: DJ Conceited, DJ Diamond Kuts"
