        "text": "Famous Studios (renamed Paramount Cartoon Studios in 1956) was the first animation division of the film studio Paramount Pictures from 1942 to 1967. Famous was founded as a successor company to Fleischer Studios, after Paramount seized control of the aforementioned studio and ousted its founders, Max and Dave Fleischer, in 1941.[1] The studio's productions included three series started by the Fleischers—Popeye the Sailor, Superman, and Screen Songs—as well as Little Audrey, Little Lulu, Casper the Friendly Ghost, Honey Halfwitch, Herman and Katnip, Baby Huey, and the anthology Noveltoons series.\n\nThe Famous name was previously used by Famous Players Film Company, one of several companies which in 1912 became Famous Players-Lasky Corporation, the company which founded Paramount Pictures.[1] Paramount's music publishing branch, which held the rights to all of the original music in the Fleischer/Famous cartoons, was named Famous Music, and a movie theater chain in Canada owned by Paramount was called Famous Players.\n\nMany of the Famous Studios productions are currently owned by AT&T's WarnerMedia and Warner Bros. through Turner Entertainment and DC Comics (for Popeye The Sailor (1942–1957) and Superman (1942–1943)) and Comcast's NBCUniversal and Universal Pictures through DreamWorks Animation/Classic Media for Harvey Comics (October 1950–March 1962 and Felix the Cat (1958–1962)). The April 1962–1967 cartoons, including two 1960s cartoons featuring Little Lulu, are still owned by Paramount Pictures along with the 1943 – September 1950 cartoons (the latter being through Melange Pictures, LLC).\n\nHistory[]\n\nFleischer Studios dissolution[]\n\nSee also: Fleischer Studios\n\nFleischer Studios was a successful animation studio responsible for producing cartoon shorts starring characters such as Betty Boop and Popeye the Sailor. The studio moved its operations from New York City to Miami, Florida in 1938, following union problems and the start of production on its first feature film, Gulliver's Travels (1939).[2] While Gulliver was a success, the expense of the move and increased overhead costs created finance problems for the Fleischer Studios. The studio depended upon advances and loans from its distributor, Paramount Pictures, in order to continue production on its short subjects and to begin work on a second feature, Mr. Bug Goes to Town.[3]\n\nCompounding the problems the studio was facing was the fact that the studio's co-founders, brothers Max Fleischer and Dave Fleischer, were becoming increasingly estranged, and by this time were no longer speaking to each other due to personal and professional disputes.[4] On May 25, 1941, Paramount assumed full ownership of Fleischer Studios, and required the Fleischer brothers to submit signed letters of resignation, to be used at Paramount's discretion.[3] Following the unsuccessful release of Mr. Bug in December 1941,[3] Max Fleischer, no longer able to cooperate with Dave, sent Paramount a telegram expressing such.[4] Paramount responded by producing the letters of resignation, severing the Fleischer brothers from control of their studio.[3]\n\nParamount renamed the studio Famous Studios. Although they had ownership of the company, it remained a separate entity.[3] Three top Fleischer employees were promoted to run the animation studio: business manager Sam Buchwald, storyboard artist Isadore Sparber, and Max Fleischer's son-in-law, head animator Seymour Kneitel.[1] Buchwald assumed Max Fleischer's place as executive producer, while Sparber and Kneitel shared Dave Fleischer's former responsibilities as supervising producers and credited directors.[3] A third animation director, Dan Gordon, remained only briefly before being fired shortly after the move to New York.[4][5] Although the Fleischers left the studio at the end of 1941, Famous Studios was not officially incorporated until May 25, 1942, after Paramount's contract with Fleischer Studios had formally run its course.[3]\n\nEarly years[]\n\nShortly after the takeover, Paramount began plans to move a significantly downsized Famous Studios back to New York, a move completed early in 1943.[1] Virtually all of the Famous staff, including voice artist/storyman Jack Mercer, storyman Carl Meyer, voice artist Mae Questel, and animators such as Myron Waldman, David Tendlar, Thomas Johnson, Nicholas Tafuri, and Al Eugster, were holdovers from the Fleischer era. These artists remained with Famous/Paramount for much of the studio's existence. As at Fleischer, the head animators carried out the tasks that were assigned to animation directors at other studios, while the credited directors—Kneitel, Sparber, Gordon, and Disney/Terrytoons veteran Bill Tytla—acted more as supervisors.[6] Sammy Timberg served as musical director until he was replaced in 1946 by Winston Sharples, who formerly worked with the Van Beuren Studios.\n\nContinuing series from the Fleischer period included Popeye the Sailor and Superman, both licensed from popular comics characters. The expensive Superman cartoons, having lost their novelty value with exhibitors, ended production in 1943, a year after Famous' inception. They were replaced by a series starring Saturday Evening Post comic strip character Little Lulu. Also in 1943, Famous began producing the formerly black-and-white Popeye cartoons in Technicolor, and began a new series of one-shot cartoons under the umbrella title Noveltoons (similar in respects to the Color Classics series from Fleischer Studios, and also the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series from Warner Bros.).[7]\n\nThe Noveltoons series introduced several popular characters such as Herman and Katnip, Baby Huey and Casper the Friendly Ghost. Casper was created by writer Seymour Reit and Famous animator Joe Oriolo in the late 1930s as a children's book manuscript, and was sold to Famous during World War II. It became the studio's most successful wholly owned property.[6]\n\nIn 1947, Paramount decided to stop paying Little Lulu creator Marge licensing royalties, and created another \"mischievous girl\" character, Little Audrey, as a replacement.[7] That same year Famous resurrected an old Fleischer series, Screen Songs, introducing a new series of musical cartoons featuring a \"bouncing ball\" sing-along.[6] In 1951, the Screen Songs became \"Kartune Musical Shorts,\" which ended in 1953 after Max Fleischer claimed ownership of the \"bouncing ball\" trademark. Only two more musical cartoons were released (as one-shot Noveltoons): 1954's Candy Cabaret and 1963's Hobo's Holiday.\n\nAlthough the studio still carried much of the staff from the previous regime, animation fans and historians note that its films soon diverged from the previous style.[1] Many of them, including animation historian and film critic Leonard Maltin, derided the company style for being highly formulaic and largely oriented toward a children's audience, with none of the artistic ambition or sophistication that the management under the Fleischer brothers strove for.[1][6]\n\nLater period and sales of cartoon libraries[]\n\nSam Buchwald died of a heart attack in 1951.[8] Seymour Kneitel and Isadore Sparber became the production heads of the studio shortly afterward, and Dave Tendlar was promoted to director in 1953.[8]\n\nThe mid and late-1950s brought a number of significant changes for Famous Studios. In 1955, Paramount sold most of its 1942–1950 shorts and cartoons, except for the Popeye and Superman shorts, to U.M. & M. TV Corporation for television distribution. The Popeye cartoons were acquired by Associated Artists Productions, and the Superman cartoons had already reverted to Superman's owners National Comics after the studio's film rights to the character had expired. In 1956, Famous Studios was downsized and reorganized. Paramount assumed full control of the studio, integrating it as a division named Paramount Cartoon Studios.[8] Around the same time, Isadore Sparber was fired, leaving Seymour Kneitel alone in charge of the studio. In addition, because of studio budget cuts, the animation quality of the shorts began to drop sharply; by 1959 everything that the studio was turning out began to look bizarrely cheap and limited. Paramount also ceased using Technicolor by this time in favor for cheaper color processes. The last Famous Studios short to use Technicolor was Katnip's Big Day, the finale of the Herman and Katnip cartoon series. Despite the studio submitting some of their shorts for Academy Award consideration, none received a nomination.[9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16]\n\nParamount sold its remaining cartoon film library and the rights to its established characters to Harvey Comics in 1959; however, the final theatrical cartoon to have any of their established characters already acquired by Harvey Comics since was Turtle Scoop featuring Tommy Tortoise and Moe Hare (both uncredited and redrawn) in 1961.[8] Paramount's attempts at creating replacement characters, among them Jeepers and Creepers and The Cat, proved unsuccessful. Nonetheless, television animation production outsourced from King Features and Harvey Films brought the company additional income. Ironically, these arrangements had Paramount working on new television cartoons starring Casper, whom they had originally created, and Popeye and Little Lulu, characters they had previously licensed for theatrical cartoons.[8] In the case of King Features' Popeye and King Features Trilogy TV cartoons, Paramount was one of several animation studios, among them Jack Kinney Productions and Rembrandt Films, to which King Features subcontracted production.[8] The first of only two all-new Little Lulu cartoons after the character's 13-year hiatus off-screen, Alvin's Solo Flight, was released as part of the Noveltoons series in 1961, while twelve of the King Features Trilogy cartoons, starring characters such as Krazy Kat, Little Lulu, Beetle Bailey, and Snuffy Smith, were released theatrically by Paramount in 1962 under the title Comic Kings.[8]\n\nSeymour Kneitel died of a heart attack in 1964, and Paramount brought in comic book veteran Howard Post to run the cartoon studio.[17] Under Post's supervision, Paramount began new cartoon series and characters such as Swifty and Shorty and Honey Halfwitch (the latter having originated from the Modern Madcaps series in the 1965 short Poor Little Witch Girl), and allowed comic strip artist Jack Mendelsohn to direct two well-received cartoons based upon children's imaginations and drawing styles: The Story of George Washington and A Leak in the Dike (both 1965).[17]\n\nHowever, Post left the studio due to internal conflicts with the Paramount staff. His replacement was Shamus Culhane, a veteran of the Fleischer Studios.[17] Culhane completed a few films that Post started and then ignored the rule book and made films that were very different from the previous regime.[18] In 1966, the studio subcontracted The Mighty Thor cartoons from Grantray-Lawrence Animation, producers of the animated television series The Marvel Super Heroes.[19] In 1967, Culhane directed another short based upon children's art, My Daddy, the Astronaut,[20] which became Paramount's first film to be shown at an animation festival.[19] However, when Paramount's board of directors rejected a proposal to produce episodes for a second Grantray-Lawrence series, Spider-Man, Culhane quit the studio, and was succeeded by former Terrytoons animator Ralph Bakshi in mid-1967.[19] Although Bakshi quickly put several experimental shorts into production, by the winter of 1968, Paramount's new owners, Gulf+Western, had begun the process of shutting down the animation studio, a task completed in December. The last cartoon from Paramount Cartoon Studios, Mouse Trek, the finale of the Fractured Fables series, premiered on December 31, 1967.[21]\n\nLegacy[]\n\nDespite Famous Studios' 1967 closing, it has since gained a cult following on both public domain home media and in animation circles.[22]\n\nThe 1961 short Abner the Baseball is displayed at the Baseball Hall of Fame.[23]\n\nThe Harveytoons Show, consulted by animation historian Jerry Beck, first aired in syndication during the 1990s.[24][25]\n\nFamous Studios Staff: 1942-1967[]\n\n(Note: Most of the staff listed are handovers from Fleischer Studios)\n\nProducers[]\n\nSam Buchward (Assistant Producer, 1942-1951)\n\nIsadore \"I.\" Sparber (1942-1958)\n\nSeymour Kneitel (1942-1964)\n\nDan Gordon (1942-1944)\n\nMax Fleischer (Archived footage, 1949, 1950, 1952)\n\nHoward Post (1964-1967)\n\nJames Culhane (1966-1967)\n\nRalph Bakshi (1967)\n\nDirectors[]\n\nPage Template:Div col/styles.css must have content model \"Sanitized CSS\" for TemplateStyles (current model is \"wikitext\").\n\nWriters[]\n\nPage Template:Div col/styles.css must have content model \"Sanitized CSS\" for TemplateStyles (current model is \"wikitext\").\n\nAnimators[]\n\nPage Template:Div col/styles.css must have content model \"Sanitized CSS\" for TemplateStyles (current model is \"wikitext\").\n\nAnimation Directors[]\n\n(Note: An animator who is credited first in a Famous Cartoon are directors of Animation)\n\nPage Template:Div col/styles.css must have content model \"Sanitized CSS\" for TemplateStyles (current model is \"wikitext\").\n\nOrestes Calpini\n\nDoug Crane\n\nAl Eugster\n\nJohn Gentilella\n\nGeorge Germanetti\n\nTom Johnson\n\nSteve Muffatti\n\nJoe Oriolo\n\nGraham Place\n\nNick Tafuri\n\nMartin Taras\n\nDave Tendlar\n\nJim Tyre\n\nMyron Waldman\n\nLayout and Scenic Artists[]\n\nPage Template:Div col/styles.css must have content model \"Sanitized CSS\" for TemplateStyles (current model is \"wikitext\").\n\nVoice Actors[]\n\nPage Template:Div col/styles.css must have content model \"Sanitized CSS\" for TemplateStyles (current model is \"wikitext\").\n\nMusical Supervisor and Arrangements[]\n\nSammy Timberg (1942-1946)\n\nWinston Sharples (1942-1967)\n\nFilmography[]\n\nTheatrical short subjects series[]\n\nPopeye the Sailor (1942–1957;
