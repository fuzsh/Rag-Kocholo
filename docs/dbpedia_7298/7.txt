Later, having moved to Angel Studios, he got the opportunity to assist on a variety of film, advertising and television productions and on orchestral sessions for major artists.

In 2007, producer Al Stone (Bjork, Jamiroquai) offered Gordon the chance to move to The Townhouse where, in the roles of assistant engineer and engineer, he worked with major rock and pop artists including Ian Brown, Kasabian, Stereophonics and Mick Jagger, as well as top engineers and producers such as Bob Clearmountain, Danton Supple and Jim Lowe.

Working with engineers and producers such as Geoff Emerrick, Ethan Johns, John Frasier, and Will.i.am across a variety of genres has provided Gordon with an incredible breadth of experience to apply to the projects he works on and collaborates with. Artists he has worked with include Paolo Nutini, Sam Smith, Novelist and Shirley Bassey.

Gordon loves to embrace the best new technology and combine it with the fantastic legacy of equipment and techniques Abbey Road is famous for. He is equally at home with vintage drum kits and drum machines, analogue synths and pianos, a two-piece punk band and a symphony orchestra.

Gordon is passionate about capturing, manipulating and reproducing sound to deliver the best experience possible to artists and listeners.
