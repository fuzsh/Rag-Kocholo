Funeral services were conducted from the residence by W. C. Cater after which the remains were interred in Freedom Cemetery. For many years the deceased had been a leading citizen in the affairs of Mercer County, and was always on the right side of moral and social questions. We believe no man in the community had a wider circle of friends. He was an affectionate husband, a kind father, and an accommodating neighbor, and his wife and children have the sympathy of all in their bereavement.

Peace to his ashes.

A Child Burned to Death.

Martinsville, Ind., Feb. 15.--James, the three-year-old son of E. E., Crawford, of Green township, was burned to death yesterday. The mother went to the barn for eggs, leaving the child alone. A few minutes later she was attracted by his piercing screams and ran to the house. She found her only child burned to a crisp, rolling in the snow in the yard. He exclaimed, as she picked him up "I'll not play with fire any more, mamma. You will have to get you another little boy; I'm burned to death." Almost every thread of clothing was burned from him and he died soon after.

Martinsville Republican, January 6, 1876

Mary Williams, daughter of Jonathan and Celia Wlliams, was born in Green Township, this county Sept. 20,1825. She was married to G. W. Egbert, Feb. 11, 1847. She died Jan. 4, 1876. Her disease was pneumonia, which speedily terminated her life. She was the mother of 6 children - two sons and four daughters - who survive her.

Her life was pre-eminently an exemplary one. I appreciate that she had not an enemy in the world. She was domestic in her habits and answered the apostalic description of a good and prudent woman, i.e. "discreet, chaste, keeper at home, obedient to their husbands." In a word, she spent her life in the strict discharge of her domestic affairs, which duties she discharged well. She was at peace with all the world, and when she laid herself down to die, she had no misgivings, but met death composedly and "like a hero in the strife," Alas! Mother, wife, sister, friend, farewell, farewell! H.W.C.

He was born in Morgan county, IN, Jan 1, 1859, and was consequently in his 23d year at his death. From Indiana the family moved to Illinois, where John has been the chief support of the family. He became a Christian two years ago and united with the M.E. church, where he has since lived a faithful Christian life. He died in the full assurance of faith, and his friends weep in the hope of meeting again in heaven. His funeral took place on Monday at Shaw's schoolhouse, Rev. A.M. Danely conducting the services.

Griffin, Nancy A.

Brother Mathes:

Mrs. Nancy A. Griffin, well known in this city, died at the home of her daughter, Mrs. William Hatley, in Brightwood, at 10 oâclock Tuesday night. The deceased had been sick since last Thursday with pneumonia, which caused her death.

The remains will be brought to this city from Brightwood on the 3 oâclock car tomorrow afternoon and will be taken to the home of her sister, Mrs. Andrew Carmichael, on North Henry street. The funeral will be held at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Carmichael, Friday morning at 10 oâclock, and will be conducted by Rev. Noah Harper, of Brightwood, former pastor of the Baptist church in this city, of which Mrs. Griffin was a member.

The deceased had lived in this city for many years, but moved to Maywood and made her home with her son, Sherman Griffin, for about two years, going from there to her daughterâs at Brightwood about two months ago. She was seventy-two years of age last fall. Her husband, Charles Griffin, died seventeen years ago last December. Three sonsâAlexander Griffin, this city; William and Sherman of Maywood; one daughter, Mrs. Wm. Hatley, of Brightwood, two sisters, Mrs. Carmichael, this city; Mrs. Sarah Jones, Paragon; twelve grand-children and two great-grand-children, survive.

Gross, Ephraim

Christian Record, May 1849, p. 351

Brother Mathes:

I will inform you that our beloved brother, cousin Ephraim Gross, is no more with us in this life. He died this morning at about 3 o'clock, at his residence, in Morgan County. He was only sick a few days, and I have not learned what the physicians called his disease. ~~John Gross~~

We have been intimately acquainted with Brother Ephraim Goss for more than 20 years. He became a disciple of Christ about the time we first became acquainted with him, and united with the church at "Old Union" meeting house, in Owen County. But when a church was established at Liberty, in the western part of Morgan County, it being more convenient for him, he united with the congregation at that point, and up to the day of his death, lived an acceptable member of the church.

He was a good citizen, an obliging neighbor, and affectionate friend, and a tender hearted and kind husband and father.

Community has lost much in the death of Brother Goss, as he was one of her most public spirited and enterprising citizens. The church has lost one of her most liberal and substantial members; but his family have lost most of all. But we are assured that those who die in the Lord shall come again when the Lord comes, we therefore sorrow not as those who have no hope. We truly sympathize with sister Goss and her bereaved family. May the Lord sustain them by his grace.

Hadley, Isaac Riley

The Cainsville News, Cainsville, MO, October 25, 1911

Mr. Isaac Riley Hadley,an old and highly respected citizen of this city, died at the family home last Sunday morning, Oct. 22, 1911, at 10 o'clock, after an illness of some weeks.

He was born in Morgan county, Ind., Oct. 21, 1829, and was therefore 85 years and 1 day old at the time of his death. He was married to Miss Eleanor Bain Nov. 14, 1847, and to this union 10 children were born - 3 boys and 7 girls, one of which died in infancy. Six of the children were born in Indiana. Mr. Hadley and family emigrated (sic) to Missouri in 1858, settling on a farm about 3 miles northwest of Cainsville where he continued to reside until 1882 when he moved to town to take charge of the post office which position he held for 10 or 12 years.

Soon after the breaking out of the war, he enlisted in Co. I, 23rd Mo.Vol. Inft. and served faithfully until being honorably discharged June 10, 1865, when he returned and made this vicinity home until his death. He was Justice of the Peace in this township nearly a quarter of a century serving 22 yars at one time without a break in his service. He was a capable and painstaking official.

He was a member of the G.A.R., I.O.O.F., and M.E. church, and was especially prominent in G.A.R. circles. On memorial occasions he always carried the flag he loved so well and it occupied a prominent place among the decorations at his funeral.

His wife passed on to the Better Land Aug. 18, 1907, since which time he has kept house, one of his daughters living with him the last few years.

Funeral services were conducted at the M.E. church in Cainsville Monday, Oct. 23, at 2 P.M. conducted by Rev. W.E. Tinney, Pastor, from the text found in James 4:14, after which interment was made in the Oakland cemetery according to I.O.O.F. ritual. He was a highly respected citizen and leaves a host of relatives to mourn his death.
