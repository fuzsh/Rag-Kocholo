        "text": "My family surnames from Holland, Derby, Brome Quebec are HALL, DAVIS and recently discovered, MAGOON.\n\nMy MAGOON ancestor is Dorothy who was born in VT in 1798 and married Enoch DAVIS, father of Solomon DAVIS and Eleazor DAVIS. I believe the DAVIS family goes back to Dudley DAVIS and I have found information on this branch. But I don't know who Dorothy's parents are and I would like to find that out.\n\nI have her buried in the East Bolton Cemetery, along with her husband Enoch and son Eleazer. Solomon DAVIS, another son, is my ancestor and he is buried in Sudbury Massachusetts. He was born in Quebec in 1825 and died in Framingham, MA in 1901. His daughter, Henrietta, married Albert HALL and lived in Holland, VT.\n\nIf you can shed any light on this family, I would appreciate it. I currently have a public tree on Ancestry.com and have a photo of Solomon's grave, should anyone you know want to see it.\n\nSuzanne Hall Eaton SUBITO@aol.com\n\n* * *\n\nI'm looking for relatives or ancestors in Canada\n\nNorbert Bolduc Sept 29 1903\n\nMother Alice Parr Bolduc\n\nFather Liborie Annie Bolduc\n\nThe only towns I have are Marie PQ Canada, Sacre Coeurde\n\nThey entered Maine in the 1900s my mother was born 1928 I have tried and tried with no luck.

It is known that Jean-François and his family went to Redford, New York (just west of Plattsburg), but it is not known where Jean-B'te resettled.\n\nWe know that his oldest surviving daughter, Délina D'AMOURS dit de COURBERON married Joseph LABONTÉ on 21 August 1848 at Stanstead. He was the son of Franois LABONT and Josephte ANTAYA. They had one child, Joseph, born 11 October 1848, in Sherbrooke, but he lived only one year.\n\nMy desire is to locate more information regarding Jean-Baptiste (born 1785 in Ste-Anne-de-la-Pocatire) after his release from prison. It is possible that he lived near Stanstead, either Vermont or Quebec, with his wife, Josephte PELLETIER and their three other children, Franois (born 1831 in Ste-Anne, Mdine (born 1834, Ste-Anne) and Srephine (born 1836, Ste-Anne). Marshall Colburn marshcolburn@aol.com\n\nMarshall,\n\nThe information you mention is in the local records.\n\nThe Parish of Sacre Coeur becomes a parish in 1848, the previous 10 years it was a mission. Most of the D'Amours were members of the Coaticook churches after they opened. The only record I can find in the marriage index that mentions Courberon is that of Alphonse D'Amour Courberon Feb 23, 1925, St. Marc, Coaticook.\n\nFiguring out if and where some one lived in Stanstead County using Sacre Coeur Parish records is not always a reliable method. It is the second oldest parish in our region of the lower Eastern Townships. Sherbrooke is a year or so older. So the whole County came to Stanstead until their own parishes were formed or one that was closer to where they lived was. Most of Orealns County, VT also came here for RC services or the priests went there as a missionary and preformed services. Those living in Stanstead County were considered members of this parish unless it is indicated to the contary in the records. That included Coaticook and up to the borders of the area covered by Sherbrooke.\n\nJean-Baptiste may have lived in Coaticook for example and the distance from there to Sherbrooke would be very close to that to Stanstead. Coaticook did not have its first parish until 1868. As a result recording the births, marriages and deaths before that date required the services of a priest from Sherbrooke or Stanstead or a missionary priest from head office.\n\nGenealogy Menu Page\n\nPOSTED 12.14.09 Richard SMITH, b. 1782, and his second wife Sarah KNAPP, b.1786, (both American born) were my 3-great grandparents. Richard, after large losses in Windham County, VT., real estate, deserted his first wife and children and moved to Ascot, Quebec, where he earned a living as a trader and school teacher. He had 5 children with his second wife. Only one baptismal record has been found for their first child Sarah Ann WHITE SMITH who oddly appears to have been named for his first wife who divorced him back in Vermont in 1829, after her birth and just about 2 weeks before the birth of my 2-great grandmother, Clarina HOWARD SMITH.\n\nI have been unable to find a marriage record for his second marriage in Quebec. It appears that RICHARD, SARAH & her mother Ruth were all living in Ascot in the 1819 Ascot census. By 1828 SarahÕs mother Ruth KNAPP has died and Richard and Sarah are witnesses. Quebec Vital and Church Records. Ruth KNAPP's death, Ascot (Church of England) Qubec On this 13 day of April, 1828, Sarah KNAPP, widow, born August 16, 1753 was buried in the presence of her daughter and other witnesses. Aged 70 years and 9 months. Witnesses: Richard SMITH, KNAPP SMITH\n\nI am trying to discover the maiden name of Ruth KNAPP, and who her husband was (the father of Sarah KNAPP) and where else to look besides the DROUIN collection for the marriage of Richard SMITH & Sarah KNAPP, and missing birth records of other 4 children. Jacki Russell Jackisr@aol.com\n\nJacki,\n\nThe age and dates here do not work. The index I have suggests that the Ruth Knapp with the Smiths as witnesses died April 28, 1828, aged 74, was buried on the 30th and was born August 16, 1753 as you mention. Have you tried the Eastern Townships Research Center at Bishop's University? There are still two Knapp family histories available from Higginson Books. The Knapp Family in America a genealogy of the descendants of William Knapp . . . including a pedigree of Hiram Knapp is a slim volume written in 1909. There are many Hiram entries in local records. The second one, Nicholas Knapp Genealogy, is a brick at 900 pages may also be of help.\n\n* * *\n\nWith cousins we have traced back to 1600, but the elusive time is between 1848 to 1865 My Great Grandfather Celestine (Lester) PRATT (b) 9 Apr 1848 in St.Hyacinthe,Quebec Christened 9 Apr 1848 in St. Dominque, Bagot. I have his father as Charles Dupras (PRATT) not at the Christening, and his mother Marie GUERTIN remarried around 1850. I would like to know where to find when he came across the border. I have his Civil War records. I know his mother stayed in Canada and he visited from time to time, as he lived in Vermont until 1895 then moved to Rhode Island where he is buried with my Great Grandmother Angeline CORROW ( CARON) Gene Caouette ,Vermont\n\ngene@vfwonline.net\n\nGene,\n\nThere does not seem to have been any restrictions on immigration from Canada to the United States until 1895. If they went by ship there could be a passenger list. If Mr Pratt became an American citizen or was naturalized there should be a record in the office closest to where he applied. I am surprised his military service record did not supply more information. If nothing else the time between 1861 and 1865 should be available.\n\nWhere abouts are you in Vermont? Close to the Manchester, NH end? The American Canadian Genealogical Society there has great records from Quebec and the Drouin records. It is sort of like one stop shopping for folks with roots in Quebec.\n\nMy family surnames are from Holland, Derby, Brome Quebec are HALL, DAVIS and recently discovered, MAGOON. My MAGOON ancestor is Dorothy who was born in VT in 1798 and married Enoch DAVIS, father of Solomon DAVIS and Eleazor DAVIS. I believe the DAVIS family goes back to Dudley DAVIS and I have found information on this branch. But I don't know who Dorothy's parents are and I would like to find that out.\n\nI have her buried in the East Bolton Cemetery, along with her husband Enoch and son Eleazer. Solomon DAVIS, another son, is my ancestor and he is buried in Sudbury, Massachusetts. He was born in Quebec in 1825 and died in Framingham, MA in 1901. His daughter, Henrietta, married Albert HALL and lived in Holland, VT.\n\nIf you can shed any light on this family, I would appreciate it. I currently have a public tree on Ancestry.com and have a photo of Solomon's grave, should anyone you know want to see it. Suzanne Hall Eaton SUBITO@aol.com\n\nGenealogy Menu Page\n\nPOSTED 10.30.09 First of all, thanks so much for your column! I posted a question a while ago and it was seen by a distant relative of mine. He has provided me with a great deal of information on my ancestry. Now I have a couple more queries to post.\n\nAccording to the 1901 census of Canada my ancestor Burton L DHU lived in Brome and was married to 17 year old Edith. In the Drouin files I found a marriage record for Miss Grace E SORNBERGER to Mr Burton L DHERS (transcription error I think, I strongly believe this is my Burton DHU.) The marriage took place at the Fitch Bay Adventist Church. This is the last time I found this wife in association with Burton and I always assumed she died. However, I just located a marriage record from Vermont, and it is not in front of me so I'm not sure of the date (several years after the 1901 census), that indicated a George DHU, son of Elizabeth HOLLENBECK and Ed DHU (these are also Burton's parents) married a Grace DHU, whose father was a SORNBERGER. It appears to me that Grace Edith divorced Burton and later married his brother George. I would like to confirm this somehow.\n\nAlso, I am looking for an ancestor named Amanda BELANGER. She was born around 1852, I believe in Canada, lived some of her adult life in Salem, Derby, VT and she died in 1885 in Salem, Derby, VT. She was married to Oliver &quot;lLevi&quot;l DERUSHA (or any other variation of that name). They had several children that were baptized at Sacred Heart in Stanstead, including Marie Louise DESROCHERS and Marie Jane DESROCHERS. Amanda is buried at Sacre-Coeur cemetery in Stanstead, though no stone remains. In her interment record from Sacred Heart, it states she has either a father or brother named Alexis (cannot tell if it says frere or pere). Levi went on to marry Martha POWERS and they are both buried at St Mary's in Stanstead. I would like to find out who Amanda's parents were, if possible, and where she was born in Canada.\n\nPaula Price paulajprice@yahoo.com\n\nPaula\n\nThe Stanstead Journal reported that at Oliver on Dec. 19, 1900, Elder D.W. Sornberger, grandfather of the bride, in the presence of her father at the home of the bride's aunt and uncle, Mr. Burton L. Dhu of the Twp. of Bolton married Miss Grace Sornberger of Magog Twp.\n\nElder D.W. Sornberger was the pastor at Fitch Bay for many years so the event was probably recorded in his books.\n\nWhen Valentine Orson Brown died suddenly on May 4, 1945 he was in the home of his sister, Mrs. Burton Dhu, Derby Line, VT. His sister Ivy Brown was Mrs. Dhu. His daughter Olive died here a few years ago. She was very sharp I am sure she would have remembered her aunt and uncle. I think her siblings have all gone too.\n\nAccording to the cemetery records at the Stanstead Historical Society Archives, Ivy Brown Dhu's middle initial was E. She dies in 1968 and was born in 1879; she is buried in Derby Line. Lawrence Dhu and his wife Yvonne (I think she was a Watson) are buried there also.\n\nThere was a death of an infant child of Berton Dhu of Beebe Plain recorded by the Sherbrooke Daily Record, Dec. 27, 1902.\n\nShe was 36 at the time of death. She had a brother Alexis.\n\nPaula Price wrote:\n\nThanks for putting Marc in touch with me. He has given me some excellent information! I have one more small clue to go on with Amanda. I located a baptismal record for Joseph Elwin GARCEAU, my grandfather. His parents were Edouard GARCEAU and Mary (Marie) DESROCHERS. Mary/Marie was Amanda Belanger's and Levi DERUSHA's daughter. According to the document Joseph Elwin's godfather was either Francis or Francois Xavier LEBLANC BOULANGER. If only I could figure out how he was related to Amanda... Paula Price paula.price@mshp.dps.mo.gov\n\nPaula\n\nYears ago when I worked as a funeral director I remember the funeral of Mr. Joseph Elwin Garceau who was the cousin of the daughters of Francois X. Leblanc making him Mr. Garceau's uncle. Therese LeBlanc Winter made the arrangements. That was in 1976. Mrs. F.X. Leblanc was Marie-Louise Desrochers.\n\nWhen Francois Xavier LeBlanc married Louise Durocher June 20, 1910 his address was Bedford, MA. Louise's address was Salem, VT. His parents were David and Emma Pinsonneault and Louise's were Lvis and Amanda.\n\nDavid\n\n* * *\n\nBea Nelson of the Holland Historical Society recommended you to me. I have 3 sides of my family that came from Canada. The 2 families I need help with are BEAN & HAMILTON.\n\nAlthough Bea told me today that Hamilton may have only been the English name of my gg-grandmother Ellen HAMILTON who married Charles BEAN on 4-8-1884 in Holland, VT. If this is the case then I don't know what her real last name would be.\n\nEllen definitely was Indian. Also my uncle Bernie is still alive at 75 &amp; he remembers Ellen &amp; he says she was very Indian. In fact he said he remembers her telling him a few of her Indian names &amp; one of them was Delilah.\n\nI have a picture of Ellen holding my mother as an infant &amp; the Indian features in Ellen's face are so clear &amp; precise that it's unreal! It's a 4-generation picture so my g-grandmother, Ellen's daughter, is in the picture also & her name was Mary Winona BEAN but her married name was Largy. The Indian features on Mary's face are very clear &amp;distinct as well just like her mother Ellen. My grandmother, Mary's daughter, also in the picture, has no trace of the Indian features except maybe for the chin. The chin sticks out or juts out &amp; it's sort of pointy but not too pointy. Some of us that are living have this chin, we all call it &quot;lthe Bean chin&quot;l. But I think it actually comes from Ellen's Indian side which all along has been Hamilton but now I have my doubts about her real last name. The info I have is Ellen was born on 8-1858 some where in Quebec &amp; she immigrated to the US in 1882. Her husband was Charles BEAN, middle initial may be H, b. 6-1860 in Barnston, Quebec. Their daughter, my g-grandmother, Mary Winona BEAN was born on 7-3-1885 in Holland, VT.\n\nNow, Ellen's father is supposed to have been George Hamilton b. 1823 in Ontario. He was married twice, Nellie??, no last name, no dates or places. A second wife was Elizabeth McKay b. 7-1-1844 in Ontario. I don't know which wife came first &amp; I don't know which one would have been Ellen's mother. I'm not sure at all on the accuracy of any of this info. I also have as George's father a Francis HAMILTON married to Janet??, no last name on her either. Again, on these 2 I have no dates, places, etc. & i'm not sure of this info either.\n\nNow for the BEAN side. As i've said above, Charles BEAN was married to Ellen HAMILTON. I have an Edwin BEAN listed as Charles' father. Edwin was born in Ontario, no dates at all. Edwin was &quot;lsupposedly&quot;l married to a Mary SHERWOOD b. 1-11-1828 in England. She immigrated to Perth, Ontario in 1832. I have no date or place of their marriage. I also have her father listed as Christopher Sherwood from Yorkshire, England. I also have her mother listed as Ann Stapp?? also from Yorkshire, England. But on Charles & Ellen's marriage certificate it lists Charles' mother as being Mary (MARSH) exactly like that with MARSH in parenthesis. So i'm not sure about the accuracy of any of this either.\n\nWould you please be able to help me with all of this? I have been every where on the internet & I keep getting all sorts of different things. On the Bean surname there are so many of them I don't know which ones are my line?! At one point I was told that my Bean's might be cousins to the John BEAN's from Exeter, NH but I don't know how accurate this is either. I don't know where else or who else to turn to & I need & want a lot of accuracy on names, dates, places, etc. In particular I want to know very much about my gg-grandmother Ellen HAMILTON & her Indian line, the correct tribe she belonged to & everything. Any help that you can give me will be greatly appreciated. If you cannot help me can you direct to someone else who can? Also, feel free to forward this email to someone else that can help me. Christine Bellrose, Nashua, NH chrisbellrose@gmail.com\n\nChristine, At that date her last name could easily be just Hamilton. With the name Hamilton she might be Metis which is a person of mixed European and Aboriginal descent. There is a marriage record for Charles H. Bean of Barnston to Ella Towle in 1878. The name Marsh could be Marais or Desmarais which is marsh in French.\n\nI do not have much information for Ontario which is hundreds of miles away. I do not feel I can be much help there.\n\nBea is right but is cutting our Native Canadian population a little short. There are many more Native Canadian groups in Quebec. But it is necessary to do genealogical research in the regular way unless the family you are researching lives on a reserve. Native Canadians who married non-natives and lived in towns and farms had the same rules about registration of b. m. and d. as everyone else.\n\nA quick search for George Hamilton with a Birth/Christening date of 1823, in all Countries from all sources on the Family Search site (LDS) returned 51 items. Some of these George Hamilton entries are for the same person but come from different submitters or at least different sources.\n\nThere were two George Hamiltons in Ontario with the same birth year 1823, found on the 1881 Canadian Census. This first family has a George married to a Mary who comes from Scotland. This George could be a descendant of one of those hundreds of Scots that came to Canada to work in the fur trade. Many of these men married/lived with Native Canadian women while in the bush and fathered many children. I saw the Francis and Janet Hamilton one but as you said no last name for Janet.\n\nI can tell you that the Beans in our part of Quebec were a very large group in the early 1800s. The original Beans in Hatley and Barnston did come from NH.\n\nAn Edwin Bean from Hatley did marry a Josephine Bean daughter of Simon Bean on Sept. 19, 1860. Simon was the son of Moses Bean who was born in Sutton, NH July 21, 1774 and who moved to Hatley Twp., Stanstead Co. in 1798. Hatley borders on Barnston Twp. which is also part of Stanstead Co.\n\nI do prefer to work with genealogical charts with a group as large as the Beans. Too many with the same names and dates to keep them straight in my head. I believe there is still an active group of Bean researchers.\n\nFor the Ontario connection please try this site: http://www.ogs.on.ca/\n\nI do not see any of the names you are asking about in the Abenaki lists of names.

She was thought to have been born about 1839 in Potton Township. She was married in about 1855, possibly in North Troy Vermont, to Hollis MANUEL, who was born in North Troy, Vermont in about 1832. She died July 2, 1914 in North Troy, Vermont and is buried in the North Troy Cemetery, with her husband Hollis. She had a daughter Alice Maryetta, born Nov.23, 1873 in Jay or North Troy, Vermont, date of death unknown. Alice married my great grandfather, Howard A. MOONEY, July 15, 1891 at St. Andrew Anglican Church in Bolton. Any information other sources you could supply would be greatly appreciated. Brian Mooney bmoony@sympatico.ca\n\nBrian There is a family called Brasee/Bresee in this area too. Volume 2 of The History of Brome Co. (Taylor) pages 237- 240, many of which came from Vermont to Brome Co. According to the information in the article that the name was corrupted from the French name Bresy. Perhaps to close to ignore?? I took a quick look at this site; http://simmons.b2b2c.ca/ Marlene covers both sides of the border near Richford and may be able to help. She does have a small charge for her service but is the best source for that part of both countries. Search results for Bracey on her site there are 75 entries Howard A. Mooney and Hollis Manuel are also there. The Canadian Census for 1901 does supply a little information too. May I ask where you have already looked for Susan? I may be able to suggest other sources.\n\nGenealogy Menu Page\n\nPOSTED 10.07.09\n\nSome of the Bartlett's that descend from Edson Lyman Bartlett have written you before, in an attempt to find further details on this man. See earlier request for information, below:\n\nI have been searching for information on Edson Lyman BARTLETT an recently obtained a copy of his wife's burial record which reads that she was buried in Fitch Bay on 10 July 1892 and mentions the Adventist Church with D. W. Somburger, Minister ( spelling may not be accurate). Do you know of such a church being located in Fitch Bay or what cemetery the family might be buried in? There seems to be several cemeteries located in the Fitch Bay area but I have found no record on them. I presume that Edson, Sylvia, Jonathon, Ira Orrin, Julie Ann and Benjamin Franklin (AKA) Franklin BARTLETT are all buried in the same cemetery in Fitch Bay. The burial record had Mrs. Sylvia Shurtleff, the widow of the late Edson Bartlett died in Coventry, VT.July 08,1892, aged 87 of general debility. Another record I found states that Franklin BARTLETT died in a mine blast at Magoon's Point 08 Sep 1867 as recorded in the \"Vital Statistics from The Stanstead Journal 1861-1875 \" which I purchased from the Stanstead Historical Society. Any help that you may provide on this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! Clifford Johnson Johnsoncliff@comcast.net\n\nClifford,\n\nRev. D.W. Sornberger was the first clergyman when the Adventist church was formed in Fitch Bay in 1862.\n\nD.W. Sornberger dies in 1903. He had been married for 60 years in 1898.\n\nThere are two cemeteries in Fitch Bay and Edson does not appear in the index to either.\n\nWhen the Bartlett, Shurtleff, Browns and Coles came to Stanstead they settled mostly around Fitch Bay and Brown's Hill and the surrounding area. The Bartletts of Barnston appear to be a different family. Page 197 in The History of Stanstead Co., B.F. Hubbard (1874) which you can see at http://www.ourroots.ca/f/toc.asp?id=880 The other family is on page 297.\n\nAlthough several of the Bartlett women are buried in Fitch Bay I do not see where their husbands are buried. Any chance some of them were Quakers and not Adventists?\n\nPerhaps Bill SHURTLEFF, P.O. Box 234 Lafayette, CA 94549-0234 could be a help. He posted Edson's birth on the LDS Family History site and suggests he died Jan. 1875 in Stanstead Co., Quebec.\n\nAnd the same site has tseven listings for Edson Lyman Bartlett all to do with Birth: 12 JUN 1798 Clarendon, Rutland, Vermont, and it has the following Edson Lyman Bartlett Birth: 12 JUN 1798 Clarendon, Rutland, Vermont Marriage: 08 JUN 1824 Derby, Orleans, Vermont Death: JAN 1875, Stanstead, Quebec Burial: Wife Sylvia Ann Shurtleff Birth: 08 OCT 1803 Marshfield, Washington, Vermont Marriage: 08 JUN 1824 Derby, Orleans, Vermont Death: 08 JUL 1892 Irasburg, Rutland, Vermont Burial: Children July Ann Bartlett Benjamin Franklin Bartlett\n\n* * *\n\nRecently a discovery was made wherein a KENDAL BARTLETT (11), and ROSE BARTLETT (10), along with Horace Bartlett (5; Edson's oldest son), and three of his wife Sylvia's brother's children: George, Charles & Betsy Shurtleff, all were supposedly shown as being in a school together in 1829. The record said: \"Head of Bury West School\" (or Bary, or Barre). Do you have any access to Records for this particular school? Could you check other records for the Kendall and/or Rose Bartletts? It is our thought that the two Bartlett's listed are cousins of Horace. Thus, information on their parents would be a great find. Nathan Bartlett dinabart5@msn.com\n\nNathan,\n\nSadly I do not. The Eastern Townships Research Center at Bishop's University http://www.etrc.ca/ and the Compton County Historical Society may be able to help, http://mus.eatoncorner.com/page2.html . If indeed the school is that at Bury, Quebec and not Barre, Vermont, Bury is in Compton County. I have checked the b, m, and d indexes for their lifetimes without success. The closest item found is a marriage for a Roe Bartlette to Petter Radieker in 1844, in Stanstead. A quick look through the part of the Descendants of Wm. Shurtleff that i have shows members of that family in both Bury, QC and Barre, VT. More work is necessary. David\n\n* * *\n\nI have been recently gifted an antique set of dishes and have been told they are from my Great-Great Grandmother. The information I have been given is that her name is Elmira DUROCHER STONE. She had a son named Freeman. I know very little about this side of the family, and am very excited to find out more. I do know that she lived in Coaticook, Quebec. According to a family diary, the date of death is July 17, 1967, and she was 75 years old at the time, so the date of birth should be 1892. This is on my father's side (Peter LUCE) and Freeman's daughter Hazel married Kenneth LUCE. They lived in Moe's River, Compton for many years, and there are still many Luces there (in fact we were just there last week!) I have heard that much of the family comes from the States. I would really appreciate if you could point me in the right direction to find out more! I came across your site while searching. Crystal (Luce) Smith Paris, Ontario tcsmith@sympatico.ca\n\nHello,\n\nStone is the translation of Durocher or at least as close as possible. So these folks appear under both names in Quebec records. Henri Durocher married Mina Lesperance Nov. 11, 1895 in St. Edmond parish Coaticook. Henri's parents were Henri and Julie Desindes. Mina's were Pierre Lesperance and Marie Lyonnais. According to the 1911 Canadian Census she was born Aug. 30, 1880. On the 1901 census she was born in Aug. 1879 but is still 5 years younger than Henry. He too was a year younger in 1911. Re: the picture in the June 10 and June 17 issues of the Journal, the one of a nun and a group of schoolchildren in front of the Journal building, I recognized the nun standing in the back row. My parents also think she is Sister Prudentienne Chevalier. At the time the picture was taken, she was known as Sister Alice. She taught at Our Lady of Mercy. Diane Seguin Bacon\n\n* * *\n\nWhat a great treat it has been for me and my twin sister Ginny to try to piece together our family history in the last year and a half. I have had many great people help me along the way and have recently returned from Quebec City where I did research at the Gabrielle Roy Library on my ancestors. They were English speaking Irish settlers in Quebec city who were commercial merchants and timber trade workers in the early 1830's. They were Hugh MACADAMS(MCADAMS) and Anne (nee ROBINSON. ) and lived in the Gowen's Buildings on Saint Peter Street in the lower town. He and his large family are recorded on the Drouin Records and we have managed to locate his grave, his wife, my great,great grandfather Alexander Macadams, and two spinster sisters. Many of the younger deaths in the 1840's are recorded in the Drouin records but we can't find their graves. A visit to the old St.Mathew's cemetery and library records of the tombstones did not find them either.In anycase Alexander MACADAMS moved on after marrying a Sarah Emma MURPHY in Quebec to have a family of his own. We have traced them to Essa Township on the 1861 census in Simcoe County Ontario( kind of near Barrie ont.) with the first of their children. The third eldest was a daughter who lived and died in between the census of 1861 and 1871 and her recorded death was reported in an Ottawa newspaper. The first son also died young on a visiting trip to Ste Foy in 1866 and is buried there. My direct relative was Alexander Humphrey MACADAMS born in Quebec City on June 8, 1859. His sister was born in 1864 in Ontario, perhaps in Essa Township or maybe in London City(London, Ontario) as that was their next home on the 1871 census. Her name was Stella Maris MACADAMS and she is the person I wish to ask you about.\n\nStella Maris MACADAMS was married twice, once to a Mr. BELFORD and listed as a wealthy socialite from Quebec. I know this because her second husband was rather famous, or should I say infamous! He was an artist who met her in London, England in 1901 and married her in Paris the same year.She was a young wealthy widow from Quebec who travelled over to England with her uncle Albert Alexander Humphrey who was there to sell a gold mine. ( St. George, Beauce region...st.Onge gold mine) of which he worked as the mine superintendent. She was said to be married to a Belford. I wonder if you know of any Belford's who married a Stella Maris MACADAMS and died before 1899? Her life with her new husband, Charles CONDER is outlined in detail in an online book called Charles CONDER: The Last Bohemian. written by Ann Galbally, of the University of Melbourne, Austr.in 2003. Stella Maris is mentioned in the book, Annie younger sister is also there, Alexander MACADAMS is mentioned as her father. I am pretty sure this is my family in print! Even though the MACADAMS, Murphy's and Humphrey's are all related I have not been able to locate much information on the Humphrey line or on the Belford line. Several ship manifests have listed Stella as a wife going to Ireland in the early 1890's but I don't know if that means he lived in Ireland? Any help you could give me would be great. I have heard of some Belford's in the Eastern Township area and don't know if you have too? The publishing Belford in the USA don't seem to have married any Stella's as far as I can see. I think it would have to be a fairly wealthy Belford, as she was a wealthy widow. My interests in the Macadams family started when my grandmother died at 101 yrs old and her birth cert. had another father's name on it than we all thought it would be. OPPS!!! SO the search continues for Alexander H. Macadams who was my grandmothers birthfather who abandoned her at 18 months or thereabouts. I thought if you knew any leads for the Belford connection I could get started on that vein of the family as well. Thank you in advance for any help you can give me.\n\nPatsy Joosse pjoosse@rogers.com\n\nPatsy Here is a note received from Tim Belford, long time CBC Radio personality, in answer to your request.\n\nHi, Thanks for the note. Unfortunately I can't help. Although my family did live in Quebec (Richmond) about a hundred years ago none married a Macadams. As far as I know, there are two different branches of the Belford family that arrived in the early 19th century and settled in Ontario. Whether or not they were related I'm not sure, although they both originated in the same area of Ireland. At present, I believe there are only two Belfords in Quebec - myself and my son.\n\nTim Belford\n\nAlso, There is a Mrs. Hugh Macadams living at 26 1/2 St. Genevieve St., St. John (Quebec City listing). There is also a William Macadams living in the same residence but held a law office, 20 St. Peter St., Lower Town. This from the Dominion Directory 1871. No Belford found in Quebec City listings in that year.\n\nAccording to the 1901 Census there are 86 Belfords in Canada with 60 of those people in Quebec. There were more in 1911.\n\n* * *\n\nMy name is Thomas LEES. I was born in Sherbrooke in 1944 and was raised in Beebe/Rock Island until 1963. My parents were Thomas LEES and Violet MELVIN.

I heard about the book \"Quebec Parish & Missionary Records of Northern New York & Vermont: Baptisms, Marriages, Burials & Abjurations\" But I donât have any access to this, nor can I travel to far with my Desert Storm Disability. Any ideas where else I might try? Scott Lovely, Portland, CT scottlovely@comcast.net\n\nScott, The Drouin Marriage records are probably the best place to look if they were married in a Catholic church and specially if they married before leaving Quebec. The two best sources in the USA for these records are listed below.\n\nhttp://WWW.ACGS.ORG/\n\nhttp://www.afgs.org/index.html\n\nhttp://www.afgs.org/genepges.html\n\nThe first is in the bottom of New Hampshire and the second in RI. I guess they are about the same distance from Portland. The third is a list of links to other French Canadian sites. If you have been to these folks without any luck let me know.\n\n* * *\n\nI came across your site while looking up info on Beebe Plain I'm hoping you can help me. I just found my great-grandfather's brother in the 1860 federal census living in Beebe Plain. His name was Michael KNEELAND, his wife was Margaret, and they had 3 daughters - Bridget, Margaret and Sara. They were Irish immigrants, but I believe they were Protestant, possibly Presbyterian. Nothing is known by us about this branch of the Kneeland family.My father always said that they changed the spelling of the name to NEYLON at some point - apparently they lost touch over the years. Do you know anything about this family? I sure could use some help with this! Joanne Kneeland joanne.k@rcn.com\n\nJoanne, I have not found any Kneelands in local records. Usually the Beebe, VT folks used the Beebe, Quebec churches and cemeteries. In the1860s, if they were Catholics they would have been using the Stanstead church as there wasn't another for miles on either side of the border. The first names you mentioned certainly could be for Catholics. On the Canadian side of the border the largest group of Kneelands is in Stukley, Quebec. Do you know where they went after Beebe, VT? I need a few more details to know if I find the right ones. When were they born, married etc.\n\n* * *\n\nI was given your name by a woman at the Stanstead Registry Office when I called there to inquire as to how to request birth/marr/death certificates from Stanstead for a genealogical search I am doing. My great-grandmother, Mary BEAUCHAMP, was born in Stanstead and came to the US at a very young age with her sister and never went home.\n\n* * *(Thousands of people left Quebec to work in the mills in Maine, New Hampshire, Mass. and Rhode Island. Many workers in these mills were young children).\n\nIt was always a mystery as to the circumstances of her leaving and what happened that she never saw her family again. Several years ago my father went to Stanstead and was able to find a baptismal record at Stanstead Plain and Beebe Plain Church of England: Mary BEAUCHAMP daughter of Louis Elijah BEAUCHAMP laborer and Ellen KNOWLES his wife of Stanstead Plain, born 2nd of March 1887 and baptized 15th of May 1877.\n\nWe could not locate the family in the census records until recently when we learned more about searching for spelling variations. We then found them listed under BOSHAW, BOOSHAW, BASHAW, BEAUCHAMP, and even BOUCHARD. We learned that Louis Elijah was the son of a Francis and Betsy BEAUCHAMP and likely had brothers William and Isaac. Louis and Ellen had another daughter Maud who was a year younger than Mary. We found Louis, Ellen, and Maud living in the poorhouse in Stanstead in 1891 (perhaps Mary had already come to the US). I guess my questions for you would include:\n\nAnother name to consider; Beauchamp would probably translate to Goodfield.\n\n1. is there no 1851 Stanstead census?\n\n* * *No 1851 census for Stanstead.\n\n2. do you know of other Beauchamp researchers in Stanstead?\n\n* * *No.\n\n3. what agency in Quebec do I contact to look for birth/marriage/death certificates that might help me learn more about this family?\n\n* * * (Here is the address for the certificates for before 1900.

These folks show up for various other events under the names Beauchesne, Beauchene and Beauchamp. Many of these people could not read or write and the many spellings is a result of that. The Magog ones are in the1960s. No way to connect them at present. The Stanstead Journal reported the death of Ellen, wife of Elijah Beauchamp in Stanstead Dec. 10, 1892 aged 51 years.\n\nThe Journal also has a birth announcement for a son born to Mr & Mrs Beauchamp in Hatley Nov 30, 1898. Sadly their first names are not mentioned.\n\nThere is a death for Betsey Beauchamp aged 86, in Rock Island Oct. 11, 1881.

It is not known how long they were in that area, as some of the family later moved to the US. The children were James, Martin and Mary, (probably born in Ireland), Elizabeth M., Laurence, Edward, Robert, John, and William. All belonged to the Catholic church. I have found that the three daughters are buried in Mont Ste. Marie Cemetery in Stanstead. Two sons married BISSONNETTE sisters, presumably in Stanstead. The daughter Elizabeth, married Prosper BISSONNETTE according to the cemetery record.\n\nI would welcome anything, but especially need information on the father Martin- his place of residence, whether he died and is buried in the Stanstead area and anything about his wife (name unknown). I have not found any listings for them in the burials in Sacre-Coeur de Jesus or Mont Ste Marie cemeteries.\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to have this query published in the area where the family once lived. The Mullins records I have are vague, and I was happy to see your . website. I am including my mailing address in case someone wishes to contact me and doesn't have email.\n\nBarbara Lamb, 12 Cornwall Road, Geneva, NY 14456 blamb@capital.net\n\nBarbara, I did not find a Martin Mullins in this area. The earliest Mullen/Mullens, Mullin/Mullins family here was that of John Mullen and Ann McCoy (McCone also). The first entry in local records I find for them is the birth of daughter Sara Anne in Georgeville March 3, 1848. She died in Georgeville Feb. 26, 1849 at ten months and is buried in Sacre Coeur Cemetery. There is the birth of a daughter Elizabeth on April 25, 1850. Elizabeth was 54 and the wife P.A. Bissonnette when she died May 4, 1905. Mary E. Mullins, daughter of John, dies May, 20, 1917 in Stanstead aged 76 and the Bissonnets were the witnesses. Robert Emmit was born Aug. 19, 1852 in Stanstead. He marries Cordelia Bissonnette Jan. 20, 1879, Stanstead. John Mullens dies Dec. 28, 1865 in Stanstead. He was 56. John's wife Ann McCone dies at the age of 77 on Oct. 22, 1889 in Stanstead. The witnesses were her sons Thomas and John.\n\nThere is a lot of activity for a James Mullins, son of James and Ann Jacklie. He and his two wives have a large family that marries in Stanstead but mostly in Coaticook. At this time I cannot connect him to the John Mullins family but depending when their first son James was born it is possible he is a grandson.\n\nIf John and Martin are one and the same this may be your family. Certainly the other bits of information seems to fit.\n\n* * *\n\nI'm writing to you today to ask your advise as to how I can locate land records from abt. 1881. In the 1881 census, I found my great great great grandparents living in Hatley, Qubec area and I would like to find exactly where they lived. My ggggrandfather was listed in the census as Freeman CURTIS. He was born,baptised at St. Hyacinthe on Dec.11, 1825. His birth name is Firmin CASSISTA. When he was a child, his father, also Firmin CASSISTA moved the family to Swanton,Vermont area. When he returned to Qubec by abt. 1877, he and his wife, Amelia ne Emilie GIRARD and their children settled in or near Hatley. It was about this time when his name changed from CASSISTA to CURTIS. He was a farmer and the census information shows district 56, sub-district E, Division 1,page 38, Household number 206.\n\nHis wife, Amelia died on December 23,1881. Her name is listed as Minnie GIRARD in the Hatley Methodist Church record. She was buried in the Bean Burying Ground,which is now the Lakeview Cemetary on route 143. I went to the cemetery, however there is no grave marker.\n\nA couple of years later, Freeman moved to Massachusetts to live near his oldest daughter, Philomene, who was my great great grandmother. A few of his other children remained in Qubec. One son, David CURTIS married Leila LIBBY in 1881 and they were living in Compton. David died in 1902, also a farmer. When his wife Leila died in 1913, the Church of England, Hatley record says she was the widow of David CURTIS, farmer of Waterville.\n\nI would also like to find where in Waterville they lived. Since I live near Sherbrooke, I would be able to see for myself where they lived, that's if the land records can be located. Any advise or information that you may have would be greatly appreciated. Sandra Putnam Roy, Westbury, QC sanro07@sympatico.ca\n\nSandra, You need to know the lot and range number inorder to start a search. Currently the Registry offices are known as Registre Foncier du Quebec . The website where you can find the information once you have the lot number is http://www.registrefoncier.gouv.qc.ca 7 h to 23 h Monday to Friday and 7 h to 17 h Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nPerhaps Russell Nichol of Compton may know about this family. He is a local historian.\n\nAt the time of their marriage (Nov. 10, 1881) David Curtis was living in North Hatley and Lelie S. Libby was in Ascot. That is according to the marriage notice in The Stanstead Journal.\n\nWhen Mary died Dec. 28, 1881 she was listed as the wife of Freeman Cassitta, she was 51. Her residence was given as Stearnsville, Stanstead.\n\nAccording to the Journal, when David Curtis died Dec. 19, 1902, (there may be more than one) he was a resident of Eustis (which is next to North Hatley). He died in Waterville and had lived at Abbot's Corner. All these places are within a few miles on a map. The Sherbrooke Record adds the detail that he died of typhoid fever and was about 45 years old.\n\nI will try to locate Stearnsville, Stanstead. That's a new one for me. The tricky part of your request is that there is both a village of Hatley and a township of Hatley. The same for Compton and Stanstead. Waterville is/was in Compton Twp.\n\n* * *\n\nI've been researching my family and have been stuck at one point for many weeks. I found an article in the NY Times July 5, 1897 about Moses PIERCE (my fourth great grandfather) dies at age 104 Uncle to the President Franklin Pierce. I have found very little about this man. He died in Derby Line July 5th, 1897 and was born per my calculations from his death certificate on May 26, 1793. The death certificate states possibly born in Corinth VT but it is hard to read. Moses had a daughter Anne Elizabeth PIERCE (PIPER) born in 1828 who died in Randolf, MA. June 17, 1909. Her death certificate states that her father was born in Stanstead, P.Q. She may have been born there also.\n\nMoses's father was Samuel PIERCE and mother was mary SARGENT. Moses's wife was Abigail COLBY. The article said that he live for many years in Canada. Would it be at all possible for someone to look up his and Anne's possible births in Stanstead? Would it be possible to find the death notice that woud give his parents? I'm also trying to find out if his son Tillotson who is listed in the 1850 census might actually be Henry Tillotson PIERCE who would be my great great great grandfather.\n\nI read a lot of your history but didn't find anything that rang a bell. Just for the heck of it I went to the Mormon Latter Day Saints. I'm not sure how good it is but it did have Moses and eleven children born in Grafton NH. I'll try looking there for his birth. I know he lived in Canada for many years and also Derby Line VT. I now believe that his daughter Anne Elizabeth PIERCE was born in Stanstead P.Q. One family tree has her born in Stanstead PEI but that is spelled Stansted. Elizabeth's death certificate says that her father was born in Stanstead PQ but I'm now thinking it was her. Frank Bartlett fcbsr@snet.net\n\nFrank,\n\nFound a marriage for Miss Ann E. Pierce to Robert Piper both of Derby, Vermont, June 17, 1852. Parents were not given. Is that the right Ann E. Pierce?\n\nNo birth record found for her.\n\nMoses Pierce d. July 5, 1897 in his 105th year. His wife Abigail B. Colby died Mar. 23, 1868 aged 77 yrs. There is an obituray for her which would be available at the Stanstead Historical Society Archives.\n\nThe Pierces in our region make up a very large group. It seems they may not all be related.\n\nI have been working through the: Pierce Genealogy, being the record of the Thomas Pierce . . . There are many enteries for both Samuel and Moses and for Stanstead. No connection yet. There are other concentration of folks with that surname not far from the border. Stanbridge in the Missiquoi Co. and in Shipton there is even a Samuel born in 1783. I will keep looking,\n\n* * *\n\nI am looking for the marriage record of John Nelson HAINES to Mary-Anne SHITLOVET in B.C.Canada circa 1875. The couple resided in the Empire Valley (Chilcotin region of B.C.) and later Deer Creek (Chilcotin region of B.C.) when they met. Their daughter Lillian BAMBRICK (nee Haines) was born in 1879 and raised in the Empire Valley (Chilcotin region of B.C.).\n\nIs it possible to get this info? Mary-Anne SHITLOVET would be my great-great grandmother and proves native background in our family (she was a Lil'Wat native from Big Bar).\n\nAdvise, Deanna Hendricks luella31@telus.net\n\nDeanna,\n\nBC is a great distance from my area of expertise. I suggest contacting the British Columbia Genealogical Society to see if they can help. http://www.bcgs.ca/\n\nI did try the LDS (Mormon) site and found the following two interesting families:\n\nOn the 1881 Canadian Census you will find the Household of John C. HAYNES of Irish origins, 48 years old, his wife Emily J. HAYNES 29. Their children Fairfax HAYNES 9, Valentino HAYNES 5, Hester Emily HAYNES 3, William Howe HAYNES 1 Irene Margaret HAYNES 5 months. Of the most interest are the next two children who are older but not listed first. I suspect they may have had a different mother. all chidren are born in BC. Mary HAYNES 14, John HAYNES 12 who was born 1869. The Census Place was Osoyoos, Yale, British Columbia The second family of interest is that of John HAINS who was born in 1829 in the USA. The Census Place for him is Clinton & Lillooet, Cariboo, British Columbia. John HAINS is 52 his son Nelson HAINS is13 born in the USA too. Daughters Minnie HAINS is 11, Lilly HAINS 6, Maria HAINS 6 months. The son Nelson could be John Nelson and was called by his middle name to avoid confusion around the house.\n\n* * *\n\nLooking for KNOWLTON family cousins out there !

See earlier request for information, below: I have been searching for information on Edson Lyman BARTLETT an recently obtained a copy of his wife's burial record which reads that she was buried in Fitch Bay on 10 July 1892 and mentions the Adventist Church with D. W. Somburger, Minister ( spelling may not be accurate). Do you know of such a church being located in Fitch Bay or what cemetery the family might be buried in? There seems to be several cemeteries located in the Fitch Bay area but I have found no record on them. I presume that Edson, Sylvia, Jonathon, Ira Orrin, Julie Ann and Benjamin Franklin (AKA) Franklin BARTLETT are all buried in the same cemetery in Fitch Bay. The burial record had Mrs. Sylvia Shurtleff, the widow of the late Edson Bartlett died in Coventry, VT.July 08,1892, aged 87 of general debility. Another record I found states that Franklin BARTLETT died in a mine blast at Magoon's Point 08 Sep 1867 as recorded in the \"Vital Statistics from The Stanstead Journal 1861-1875 \" which I purchased from the Stanstead Historical Society. Any help that you may provide on this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! Clifford Johnson Johnsoncliff@comcast.net\n\nClifford,\n\nRev. D.W. Sornberger was the first clergyman when the Adventist church was formed in Fitch Bay in 1862.\n\nD.W. Sornberger dies in 1903. He had been married for 60 years in 1898.\n\nThere are two cemeteries in Fitch Bay and Edson does not appear in the index to either.\n\nWhen the Bartlett, Shurtleff, Browns and Coles came to Stanstead they settled mostly around Fitch Bay and Brown's Hill and the surrounding area. The Bartletts of Barnston appear to be a different family. Page 197 in The History of Stanstead Co., B.F. Hubbard (1874) which you can see at http://www.ourroots.ca/f/toc.asp?id=880 The other family is on page 297.\n\nAlthough several of the Bartlett women are buried in Fitch Bay I do not see where their husbands are buried. Any chance some of them were Quakers and not Adventists?\n\nPerhaps Bill SHURTLEFF, P.O. Box 234 Lafayette, CA 94549-0234 could be a help. He posted Edson's birth on the LDS Family History site and suggests he died Jan. 1875 in Stanstead Co., Quebec.\n\nAnd the same site has tseven listings for Edson Lyman Bartlett all to do with Birth: 12 JUN 1798 Clarendon, Rutland, Vermont, and it has the following Edson Lyman Bartlett Birth: 12 JUN 1798 Clarendon, Rutland, Vermont Marriage: 08 JUN 1824 Derby, Orleans, Vermont Death: JAN 1875, Stanstead, Quebec Burial: Wife Sylvia Ann Shurtleff Birth: 08 OCT 1803 Marshfield, Washington, Vermont Marriage: 08 JUN 1824 Derby, Orleans, Vermont Death: 08 JUL 1892 Irasburg, Rutland, Vermont Burial: Children July Ann Bartlett Benjamin Franklin Bartlett\n\n* * *\n\nRecently a discovery was made wherein a KENDAL BARTLETT (11), and ROSE BARTLETT (10), along with Horace Bartlett (5; Edson's oldest son), and three of his wife Sylvia's brother's children: George, Charles & Betsy Shurtleff, all were supposedly shown as being in a school together in 1829. The record said: \"Head of Bury West School\" (or Bary, or Barre). Do you have any access to Records for this particular school? Could you check other records for the Kendall and/or Rose Bartletts? It is our thought that the two Bartlett's listed are cousins of Horace. Thus, information on their parents would be a great find. Nathan Bartlett dinabart5@msn.com\n\nNathan, Sadly I do not. The Eastern Townships Research Center at Bishop's University http://www.etrc.ca/ and the Compton County Historical Society may be able to help, http://mus.eatoncorner.com/page2.html . If indeed the school is that at Bury, Quebec and not Barre, Vermont, Bury is in Compton County. I have checked the b, m, and d indexes for their lifetimes without success. The closest item found is a marriage for a Roe Bartlette to Petter Radieker in 1844, in Stanstead. A quick look through the part of the Descendants of Wm. Shurtleff that i have shows members of that family in both Bury, QC and Barre, VT. More work is necessary. David\n\n* * *\n\nI have been recently gifted an antique set of dishes and have been told they are from my Great-Great Grandmother. The information I have been given is that her name is Elmira DUROCHER STONE. She had a son named Freeman. I know very little about this side of the family, and am very excited to find out more. I do know that she lived in Coaticook, Quebec. According to a family diary, the date of death is July 17, 1967, and she was 75 years old at the time, so the date of birth should be 1892. This is on my father's side (Peter LUCE) and Freeman's daughter Hazel married Kenneth LUCE. They lived in Moe's River, Compton for many years, and there are still many Luces there (in fact we were just there last week!) I have heard that much of the family comes from the States. I would really appreciate if you could point me in the right direction to find out more! I came across your site while searching. Crystal (Luce) Smith Paris, Ontario tcsmith@sympatico.ca\n\nHello,\n\nStone is the translation of Durocher or at least as close as possible. So these folks appear under both names in Quebec records. Henri Durocher married Mina Lesperance Nov. 11, 1895 in St. Edmond parish Coaticook. Henri's parents were Henri and Julie Desindes. Mina's were Pierre Lesperance and Marie Lyonnais. According to the 1911 Canadian Census she was born Aug. 30, 1880. On the 1901 census she was born in Aug. 1879 but is still 5 years younger than Henry. He too was a year younger in 1911. Re: the picture in the June 10 and June 17 issues of the Journal, the one of a nun and a group of schoolchildren in front of the Journal building, I recognized the nun standing in the back row. My parents also think she is Sister Prudentienne Chevalier. At the time the picture was taken, she was known as Sister Alice. She taught at Our Lady of Mercy. Diane Seguin Bacon\n\n* * *\n\nWhat a great treat it has been for me and my twin sister Ginny to try to piece together our family history in the last year and a half. I have had many great people help me along the way and have recently returned from Quebec City where I did research at the Gabrielle Roy Library on my ancestors. They were English speaking Irish settlers in Quebec city who were commercial merchants and timber trade workers in the early 1830's. They were Hugh MACADAMS(MCADAMS) and Anne (nee ROBINSON. ) and lived in the Gowen's Buildings on Saint Peter Street in the lower town. He and his large family are recorded on the Drouin Records and we have managed to locate his grave, his wife, my great,great grandfather Alexander Macadams, and two spinster sisters. Many of the younger deaths in the 1840's are recorded in the Drouin records but we can't find their graves. A visit to the old St.Mathew's cemetery and library records of the tombstones did not find them either.In anycase Alexander MACADAMS moved on after marrying a Sarah Emma MURPHY in Quebec to have a family of his own. We have traced them to Essa Township on the 1861 census in Simcoe County Ontario( kind of near Barrie ont.) with the first of their children. The third eldest was a daughter who lived and died in between the census of 1861 and 1871 and her recorded death was reported in an Ottawa newspaper. The first son also died young on a visiting trip to Ste Foy in 1866 and is buried there. My direct relative was Alexander Humphrey MACADAMS born in Quebec City on June 8, 1859. His sister was born in 1864 in Ontario, perhaps in Essa Township or maybe in London City(London, Ontario) as that was their next home on the 1871 census. Her name was Stella Maris MACADAMS and she is the person I wish to ask you about. Stella Maris MACADAMS was married twice, once to a Mr. BELFORD and listed as a wealthy socialite from Quebec. I know this because her second husband was rather famous, or should I say infamous! He was an artist who met her in London, England in 1901 and married her in Paris the same year.She was a young wealthy widow from Quebec who travelled over to England with her uncle Albert Alexander Humphrey who was there to sell a gold mine. ( St. George, Beauce region...st.Onge gold mine) of which he worked as the mine superintendent. She was said to be married to a Belford. I wonder if you know of any Belford's who married a Stella Maris MACADAMS and died before 1899? Her life with her new husband, Charles CONDER is outlined in detail in an online book called Charles CONDER: The Last Bohemian. written by Ann Galbally, of the University of Melbourne, Austr.in 2003. Stella Maris is mentioned in the book, Annie younger sister is also there, Alexander MACADAMS is mentioned as her father. I am pretty sure this is my family in print! Even though the MACADAMS, Murphy's and Humphrey's are all related I have not been able to locate much information on the Humphrey line or on the Belford line. Several ship manifests have listed Stella as a wife going to Ireland in the early 1890's but I don't know if that means he lived in Ireland? Any help you could give me would be great. I have heard of some Belford's in the Eastern Township area and don't know if you have too? The publishing Belford in the USA don't seem to have married any Stella's as far as I can see. I think it would have to be a fairly wealthy Belford, as she was a wealthy widow. My interests in the Macadams family started when my grandmother died at 101 yrs old and her birth cert. had another father's name on it than we all thought it would be. OPPS!!! SO the search continues for Alexander H. Macadams who was my grandmothers birthfather who abandoned her at 18 months or thereabouts. I thought if you knew any leads for the Belford connection I could get started on that vein of the family as well. Thank you in advance for any help you can give me. Patsy Joosse pjoosse@rogers.com\n\nPatsy Here is a note received from Tim Belford, long time CBC Radio personality, in answer to your request.\n\nHi, Thanks for the note. Unfortunately I can't help. Although my family did live in Quebec (Richmond) about a hundred years ago none married a Macadams. As far as I know, there are two different branches of the Belford family that arrived in the early 19th century and settled in Ontario. Whether or not they were related I'm not sure, although they both originated in the same area of Ireland. At present, I believe there are only two Belfords in Quebec - myself and my son. Tim Belford Also There is a Mrs. Hugh Macadams living at 26 1/2 St. Genevieve St., St. John (Quebec City listing). There is also a William Macadams living in the same residence but held a law office, 20 St. Peter St., Lower Town. This from the Dominion Directory 1871. No Belford found in Quebec City listings in that year.\n\nAccording to the 1901 Census there are 86 Belfords in Canada with 60 of those people in Quebec. There were more in 1911.\n\n* * *\n\nMy name is Thomas LEES. I was born in Sherbrooke in 1944 and was raised in Beebe/Rock Island until 1963. My parents were Thomas LEES and Violet MELVIN.

A form is available or you can order online with a credit card. http://www.formulaire.gouv.qc.ca/cgi/affiche_doc.cgi?dossier=10819&sujet=89 There is a link in blue near the bottom of the birth certificate information for the other forms). 2 - Copies of death certificates of parents Thomas (died 7 Mar 1979 in Rock Island) and Violet (died 10 Jan 1968 in Stanstead). Both are buried at Crystal Lake Cemetery in Stanstead. 3- Copies of death certificates of grandparents John (died 31 Aug 1950 in Beebe) and Jean (nee PATERSON) (died 1951 in Beebe). Both are buried at Woodside Cemetery in Beebe 4 - My father and his mom and dad and siblings came to Canada about 1912 (a guess). Is there any way to find out exactly date/ ship/port? * * * (Being British they did not have a problem coming to Canada. Ships passenger lists are available. They can be time consuming, microfilms can be borrowed from the National Archives through inter-library loan. The Journal says at the time of their 25 anniversary Aug. 18, 1956, that they were natives of Scotland. The first entry I find for them is the birth of a son July 10, 1936). 5 - Any census records available? * * *(The last Canadian census available to researchers is the 1911. If your folks came to Quebec early enough in 1911 they may be listed). http://automatedgenealogy.com/census/index.html 6- Any wills/testaments/inventories copies available for Father (Thomas) and grandfather (John). * * *(Several Lee wills registered here in Stanstead but none for Lees. Perhaps they had to go through the court system if they did not have a notarial will). Tom Lees, PO Box 1015, Vulcan Alberta, T0L 2B0 tmlees1@telus.net * * *\n\nI am at a wall in my Family tree and stumbled across your webpage. I Would like to know where else I might look for info on my 3x Grandfather Jean Dosithe LAVALLEE He was Baptized in St. Cesaire, Quebec. in September 1830. His Parents Joseph LAVALLEE and Jossette PELLETIER moved to Colchester, Vt. area around 1838. Jean (John LOVELY on census reports) Married Marie DUBE around 1848-1849 I am looking for there marriage record. I have found his brothers Francis and Charles marriage records in the old town of Winooski records. I have looked in the 2 church record books numerous times. St Joseph and St Mary (Immaculate Conception). I Have been doing this for ten years now and don't know where else to look? I heard about the book \"Quebec Parish & Missionary Records of Northern New York & Vermont: Baptisms, Marriages, Burials & Abjurations\" But I donât have any access to this, nor can I travel to far with my Desert Storm Disability. Any ideas where else I might try? Scott Lovely, Portland, CT scottlovely@comcast.net\n\nScott, The Drouin Marriage records are probably the best place to look if they were married in a Catholic church and specially if they married before leaving Quebec. The two best sources in the USA for these records are listed below.\n\nhttp://WWW.ACGS.ORG/\n\nhttp://www.afgs.org/index.html\n\nhttp://www.afgs.org/genepges.html\n\nThe first is in the bottom of New Hampshire and the second in RI. I guess they are about the same distance from Portland. The third is a list of links to other French Canadian sites. If you have been to these folks without any luck let me know.\n\n* * *\n\nI came across your site while looking up info on Beebe Plain I'm hoping you can help me. I just found my great-grandfather's brother in the 1860 federal census living in Beebe Plain. His name was Michael KNEELAND, his wife was Margaret, and they had 3 daughters - Bridget, Margaret and Sara. They were Irish immigrants, but I believe they were Protestant, possibly Presbyterian. Nothing is known by us about this branch of the Kneeland family.My father always said that they changed the spelling of the name to NEYLON at some point - apparently they lost touch over the years. Do you know anything about this family? I sure could use some help with this! Joanne Kneeland joanne.k@rcn.com\n\nJoanne, I have not found any Kneelands in local records. Usually the Beebe, VT folks used the Beebe, Quebec churches and cemeteries. In the1860s, if they were Catholics they would have been using the Stanstead church as there wasn't another for miles on either side of the border. The first names you mentioned certainly could be for Catholics. On the Canadian side of the border the largest group of Kneelands is in Stukley, Quebec. Do you know where they went after Beebe, VT? I need a few more details to know if I find the right ones. When were they born, married etc.\n\n* * *\n\nI was given your name by a woman at the Stanstead Registry Office when I called there to inquire as to how to request birth/marr/death certificates from Stanstead for a genealogical search I am doing. My great-grandmother, Mary BEAUCHAMP, was born in Stanstead and came to the US at a very young age with her sister and never went home.\n\n* * *(Thousands of people left Quebec to work in the mills in Maine, New Hampshire, Mass. and Rhode Island. Many workers in these mills were young children).\n\nIt was always a mystery as to the circumstances of her leaving and what happened that she never saw her family again. Several years ago my father went to Stanstead and was able to find a baptismal record at Stanstead Plain and Beebe Plain Church of England: Mary BEAUCHAMP daughter of Louis Elijah BEAUCHAMP laborer and Ellen KNOWLES his wife of Stanstead Plain, born 2nd of March 1887 and baptized 15th of May 1877.\n\nWe could not locate the family in the census records until recently when we learned more about searching for spelling variations. We then found them listed under BOSHAW, BOOSHAW, BASHAW, BEAUCHAMP, and even BOUCHARD. We learned that Louis Elijah was the son of a Francis and Betsy BEAUCHAMP and likely had brothers William and Isaac. Louis and Ellen had another daughter Maud who was a year younger than Mary. We found Louis, Ellen, and Maud living in the poorhouse in Stanstead in 1891 (perhaps Mary had already come to the US). I guess my questions for you would include:\n\nAnother name to consider; Beauchamp would probably translate to Goodfield.\n\n1. is there no 1851 Stanstead census?\n\n* * *No 1851 census for Stanstead.\n\n2. do you know of other Beauchamp researchers in Stanstead?\n\n* * *No.\n\n3. what agency in Quebec do I contact to look for birth/marriage/death certificates that might help me learn more about this family?\n\n* * * (Here is the address for the certificates for before 1900.

(I called the historical societybut the man could not speak English and i cannot speak French). I appreciate any pointers for research! Ronda Randall, Brunswick, Maine ronda at rondae@yahoo.com\n\nRonda, I find a few Catholic Beauchamps in local records.\n\nbirth of Rose Amanda dau. of Israel Beauchamp Rosalie Beloin 8/3/1875\n\ndeath of Andrew, Elizabeth and Felix\n\none marriage in Stanstead and 2 in Magog.\n\nElie Beauchamp of Waybridge, Vermont marries Mary Maguire in Stanstead 1/11/1868. These folks show up for various other events under the names Beauchesne, Beauchene and Beauchamp. Many of these people could not read or write and the many spellings is a result of that. The Magog ones are in the1960s. No way to connect them at present. The Stanstead Journal reported the death of Ellen, wife of Elijah Beauchamp in Stanstead Dec. 10, 1892 aged 51 years.\n\nThe Journal also has a birth announcement for a son born to Mr & Mrs Beauchamp in Hatley Nov 30, 1898. Sadly their first names are not mentioned.\n\nThere is a death for Betsey Beauchamp aged 86, in Rock Island Oct. 11, 1881. Rock Island is now part of Stanstead.\n\nThere is a death for Lizzie Beauchemp who d. Mar. 12, 1913 in her 87th year a resident of Rock Island and Derby Line for 42 years.\n\nThey seem to disappear after that date.\n\nOur county records do not show a cemetery record for them. These records were compiled for the most part from information on visible monuments. No monument, no record sort of thing.\n\n* * *\n\nThe names for the photo of Sept. 2, 2009.\n\nBack row left to right: Doug Bronson, Herb Mallalieu, Lee Brown, Arthur Slade, Gordon Bunk Laberee, Doug Putney, Earl Bushnell, Al Little, Jack Heald, Valmore Lepitre Middle row: Don Willing, _?_, Greg Bronson, Ron Langevin, Nil Belleville, _?_, Arthur Laberee Front row: Raymond Yates, Mike Wing, Keith Slade, David Lepitre, Alcide Yates, Gerald Lepitre, Danny Wallace, Mike Bronson.

It is not known how long they were in that area, as some of the family later moved to the US. The children were James, Martin and Mary, (probably born in Ireland), Elizabeth M., Laurence, Edward, Robert, John, and William. All belonged to the Catholic church. I have found that the three daughters are buried in Mont Ste. Marie Cemetery in Stanstead. Two sons married BISSONNETTE sisters, presumably in Stanstead. The daughter Elizabeth, married Prosper BISSONNETTE according to the cemetery record.\n\nI would welcome anything, but especially need information on the father Martin- his place of residence, whether he died and is buried in the Stanstead area and anything about his wife (name unknown). I have not found any listings for them in the burials in Sacre-Coeur de Jesus or Mont Ste Marie cemeteries.\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to have this query published in the area where the family once lived. The Mullins records I have are vague, and I was happy to see your . website. I am including my mailing address in case someone wishes to contact me and doesn't have email.\n\nBarbara Lamb, 12 Cornwall Road, Geneva, NY 14456 blamb@capital.net\n\nBarbara, I did not find a Martin Mullins in this area. The earliest Mullen/Mullens, Mullin/Mullins family here was that of John Mullen and Ann McCoy (McCone also). The first entry in local records I find for them is the birth of daughter Sara Anne in Georgeville March 3, 1848. She died in Georgeville Feb. 26, 1849 at ten months and is buried in Sacre Coeur Cemetery. There is the birth of a daughter Elizabeth on April 25, 1850. Elizabeth was 54 and the wife P.A. Bissonnette when she died May 4, 1905. Mary E. Mullins, daughter of John, dies May, 20, 1917 in Stanstead aged 76 and the Bissonnets were the witnesses. Robert Emmit was born Aug. 19, 1852 in Stanstead. He marries Cordelia Bissonnette Jan. 20, 1879, Stanstead. John Mullens dies Dec. 28, 1865 in Stanstead. He was 56. John's wife Ann McCone dies at the age of 77 on Oct. 22, 1889 in Stanstead. The witnesses were her sons Thomas and John.\n\nThere is a lot of activity for a James Mullins, son of James and Ann Jacklie. He and his two wives have a large family that marries in Stanstead but mostly in Coaticook. At this time I cannot connect him to the John Mullins family but depending when their first son James was born it is possible he is a grandson.\n\nIf John and Martin are one and the same this may be your family. Certainly the other bits of information seems to fit.\n\n* * *\n\nI'm writing to you today to ask your advise as to how I can locate land records from abt. 1881. In the 1881 census, I found my great great great grandparents living in Hatley, Qubec area and I would like to find exactly where they lived. My ggggrandfather was listed in the census as Freeman CURTIS. He was born,baptised at St. Hyacinthe on Dec.11, 1825. His birth name is Firmin CASSISTA. When he was a child, his father, also Firmin CASSISTA moved the family to Swanton,Vermont area. When he returned to Qubec by abt. 1877, he and his wife, Amelia ne Emilie GIRARD and their children settled in or near Hatley. It was about this time when his name changed from CASSISTA to CURTIS. He was a farmer and the census information shows district 56, sub-district E, Division 1,page 38, Household number 206.\n\nHis wife, Amelia died on December 23,1881. Her name is listed as Minnie GIRARD in the Hatley Methodist Church record. She was buried in the Bean Burying Ground,which is now the Lakeview Cemetary on route 143. I went to the cemetery, however there is no grave marker.\n\nA couple of years later, Freeman moved to Massachusetts to live near his oldest daughter, Philomene, who was my great great grandmother. A few of his other children remained in Qubec. One son, David CURTIS married Leila LIBBY in 1881 and they were living in Compton. David died in 1902, also a farmer. When his wife Leila died in 1913, the Church of England, Hatley record says she was the widow of David CURTIS, farmer of Waterville.\n\nI would also like to find where in Waterville they lived. Since I live near Sherbrooke, I would be able to see for myself where they lived, that's if the land records can be located. Any advise or information that you may have would be greatly appreciated. Sandra Putnam Roy, Westbury, QC sanro07@sympatico.ca\n\nSandra, You need to know the lot and range number inorder to start a search. Currently the Registry offices are known as Registre Foncier du Quebec . The website where you can find the information once you have the lot number is http://www.registrefoncier.gouv.qc.ca 7 h to 23 h Monday to Friday and 7 h to 17 h Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nPerhaps Russell Nichol of Compton may know about this family. He is a local historian.\n\nAt the time of their marriage (Nov. 10, 1881) David Curtis was living in North Hatley and Lelie S. Libby was in Ascot. That is according to the marriage notice in The Stanstead Journal.\n\nWhen Mary died Dec. 28, 1881 she was listed as the wife of Freeman Cassitta, she was 51. Her residence was given as Stearnsville, Stanstead.\n\nAccording to the Journal, when David Curtis died Dec. 19, 1902, (there may be more than one) he was a resident of Eustis (which is next to North Hatley). He died in Waterville and had lived at Abbot's Corner. All these places are within a few miles on a map. The Sherbrooke Record adds the detail that he died of typhoid fever and was about 45 years old.\n\nI will try to locate Stearnsville, Stanstead. That's a new one for me. The tricky part of your request is that there is both a village of Hatley and a township of Hatley. The same for Compton and Stanstead. Waterville is/was in Compton Twp.\n\n* * *\n\nI've been researching my family and have been stuck at one point for many weeks. I found an article in the NY Times July 5, 1897 about Moses PIERCE (my fourth great grandfather) dies at age 104 Uncle to the President Franklin Pierce. I have found very little about this man. He died in Derby Line July 5th, 1897 and was born per my calculations from his death certificate on May 26, 1793. The death certificate states possibly born in Corinth VT but it is hard to read. Moses had a daughter Anne Elizabeth PIERCE (PIPER) born in 1828 who died in Randolf, MA. June 17, 1909. Her death certificate states that her father was born in Stanstead, P.Q. She may have been born there also.\n\nMoses's father was Samuel PIERCE and mother was mary SARGENT. Moses's wife was Abigail COLBY. The article said that he live for many years in Canada. Would it be at all possible for someone to look up his and Anne's possible births in Stanstead? Would it be possible to find the death notice that woud give his parents? I'm also trying to find out if his son Tillotson who is listed in the 1850 census might actually be Henry Tillotson PIERCE who would be my great great great grandfather.\n\nI read a lot of your history but didn't find anything that rang a bell. Just for the heck of it I went to the Mormon Latter Day Saints. I'm not sure how good it is but it did have Moses and eleven children born in Grafton NH. I'll try looking there for his birth. I know he lived in Canada for many years and also Derby Line VT. I now believe that his daughter Anne Elizabeth PIERCE was born in Stanstead P.Q. One family tree has her born in Stanstead PEI but that is spelled Stansted. Elizabeth's death certificate says that her father was born in Stanstead PQ but I'm now thinking it was her. Frank Bartlett fcbsr@snet.net\n\nFrank,\n\nFound a marriage for Miss Ann E. Pierce to Robert Piper both of Derby, Vermont, June 17, 1852. Parents were not given. Is that the right Ann E. Pierce?\n\nNo birth record found for her.\n\nMoses Pierce d. July 5, 1897 in his 105th year. His wife Abigail B. Colby died Mar. 23, 1868 aged 77 yrs. There is an obituray for her which would be available at the Stanstead Historical Society Archives.\n\nThe Pierces in our region make up a very large group. It seems they may not all be related.\n\nI have been working through the: Pierce Genealogy, being the record of the Thomas Pierce . . . There are many enteries for both Samuel and Moses and for Stanstead. No connection yet. There are other concentration of folks with that surname not far from the border. Stanbridge in the Missiquoi Co. and in Shipton there is even a Samuel born in 1783. I will keep looking,\n\n* * *\n\nI am looking for the marriage record of John Nelson HAINES to Mary-Anne SHITLOVET in B.C.Canada circa 1875. The couple resided in the Empire Valley (Chilcotin region of B.C.) and later Deer Creek (Chilcotin region of B.C.) when they met. Their daughter Lillian BAMBRICK (nee Haines) was born in 1879 and raised in the Empire Valley (Chilcotin region of B.C.).\n\nIs it possible to get this info? Mary-Anne SHITLOVET would be my great-great grandmother and proves native background in our family (she was a Lil'Wat native from Big Bar).\n\nAdvise, Deanna Hendricks luella31@telus.net\n\nDeanna,\n\nBC is a great distance from my area of expertise. I suggest contacting the British Columbia Genealogical Society to see if they can help. http://www.bcgs.ca/\n\nI did try the LDS (Mormon) site and found the following two interesting families:\n\nOn the 1881 Canadian Census you will find the Household of John C. HAYNES of Irish origins, 48 years old, his wife Emily J. HAYNES 29. Their children Fairfax HAYNES 9, Valentino HAYNES 5, Hester Emily HAYNES 3, William Howe HAYNES 1 Irene Margaret HAYNES 5 months. Of the most interest are the next two children who are older but not listed first. I suspect they may have had a different mother. all chidren are born in BC. Mary HAYNES 14, John HAYNES 12 who was born 1869. The Census Place was Osoyoos, Yale, British Columbia The second family of interest is that of John HAINS who was born in 1829 in the USA. The Census Place for him is Clinton & Lillooet, Cariboo, British Columbia. John HAINS is 52 his son Nelson HAINS is13 born in the USA too. Daughters Minnie HAINS is 11, Lilly HAINS 6, Maria HAINS 6 months. The son Nelson could be John Nelson and was called by his middle name to avoid confusion around the house.\n\n* * *\n\nLooking for KNOWLTON family cousins out there !

See earlier request for information, below:\n\nI have been searching for information on Edson Lyman BARTLETT an recently obtained a copy of his wife's burial record which reads that she was buried in Fitch Bay on 10 July 1892 and mentions the Adventist Church with D. W. Somburger, Minister ( spelling may not be accurate). Do you know of such a church being located in Fitch Bay or what cemetery the family might be buried in? There seems to be several cemeteries located in the Fitch Bay area but I have found no record on them. I presume that Edson, Sylvia, Jonathon, Ira Orrin, Julie Ann and Benjamin Franklin (AKA) Franklin BARTLETT are all buried in the same cemetery in Fitch Bay. The burial record had Mrs. Sylvia Shurtleff, the widow of the late Edson Bartlett died in Coventry, VT.July 08,1892, aged 87 of general debility. Another record I found states that Franklin BARTLETT died in a mine blast at Magoon's Point 08 Sep 1867 as recorded in the \"Vital Statistics from The Stanstead Journal 1861-1875 \" which I purchased from the Stanstead Historical Society. Any help that you may provide on this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! Clifford Johnson Johnsoncliff@comcast.net\n\nClifford,\n\nRev. D.W. Sornberger was the first clergyman when the Adventist church was formed in Fitch Bay in 1862.\n\nD.W. Sornberger dies in 1903. He had been married for 60 years in 1898.\n\nThere are two cemeteries in Fitch Bay and Edson does not appear in the index to either.\n\nWhen the Bartlett, Shurtleff, Browns and Coles came to Stanstead they settled mostly around Fitch Bay and Brown's Hill and the surrounding area. The Bartletts of Barnston appear to be a different family. Page 197 in The History of Stanstead Co., B.F. Hubbard (1874) which you can see at http://www.ourroots.ca/f/toc.asp?id=880 The other family is on page 297.\n\nAlthough several of the Bartlett women are buried in Fitch Bay I do not see where their husbands are buried. Any chance some of them were Quakers and not Adventists?\n\nPerhaps Bill SHURTLEFF, P.O. Box 234 Lafayette, CA 94549-0234 could be a help. He posted Edson's birth on the LDS Family History site and suggests he died Jan. 1875 in Stanstead Co., Quebec.\n\nAnd the same site has tseven listings for Edson Lyman Bartlett all to do with Birth: 12 JUN 1798 Clarendon, Rutland, Vermont, and it has the following Edson Lyman Bartlett Birth: 12 JUN 1798 Clarendon, Rutland, Vermont Marriage: 08 JUN 1824 Derby, Orleans, Vermont Death: JAN 1875, Stanstead, Quebec Burial: Wife Sylvia Ann Shurtleff Birth: 08 OCT 1803 Marshfield, Washington, Vermont Marriage: 08 JUN 1824 Derby, Orleans, Vermont Death: 08 JUL 1892 Irasburg, Rutland, Vermont Burial: Children July Ann Bartlett Benjamin Franklin Bartlett\n\n* * *\n\nRecently a discovery was made wherein a KENDAL BARTLETT (11), and ROSE BARTLETT (10), along with Horace Bartlett (5; Edson's oldest son), and three of his wife Sylvia's brother's children: George, Charles & Betsy Shurtleff, all were supposedly shown as being in a school together in 1829. The record said: \"Head of Bury West School\" (or Bary, or Barre). Do you have any access to Records for this particular school? Could you check other records for the Kendall and/or Rose Bartletts? It is our thought that the two Bartlett's listed are cousins of Horace. Thus, information on their parents would be a great find. Nathan Bartlett dinabart5@msn.com\n\nNathan,\n\nSadly I do not. The Eastern Townships Research Center at Bishop's University http://www.etrc.ca/ and the Compton County Historical Society may be able to help, http://mus.eatoncorner.com/page2.html . If indeed the school is that at Bury, Quebec and not Barre, Vermont, Bury is in Compton County. I have checked the b, m, and d indexes for their lifetimes without success. The closest item found is a marriage for a Roe Bartlette to Petter Radieker in 1844, in Stanstead. A quick look through the part of the Descendants of Wm. Shurtleff that i have shows members of that family in both Bury, QC and Barre, VT. More work is necessary. David\n\n* * *\n\nI have been recently gifted an antique set of dishes and have been told they are from my Great-Great Grandmother. The information I have been given is that her name is Elmira DUROCHER STONE. She had a son named Freeman. I know very little about this side of the family, and am very excited to find out more. I do know that she lived in Coaticook, Quebec. According to a family diary, the date of death is July 17, 1967, and she was 75 years old at the time, so the date of birth should be 1892. This is on my father's side (Peter LUCE) and Freeman's daughter Hazel married Kenneth LUCE. They lived in Moe's River, Compton for many years, and there are still many Luces there (in fact we were just there last week!) I have heard that much of the family comes from the States. I would really appreciate if you could point me in the right direction to find out more! I came across your site while searching. Crystal (Luce) Smith Paris, Ontario tcsmith@sympatico.ca\n\nHello,\n\nStone is the translation of Durocher or at least as close as possible. So these folks appear under both names in Quebec records. Henri Durocher married Mina Lesperance Nov. 11, 1895 in St. Edmond parish Coaticook. Henri's parents were Henri and Julie Desindes. Mina's were Pierre Lesperance and Marie Lyonnais. According to the 1911 Canadian Census she was born Aug. 30, 1880. On the 1901 census she was born in Aug. 1879 but is still 5 years younger than Henry. He too was a year younger in 1911. Re: the picture in the June 10 and June 17 issues of the Journal, the one of a nun and a group of schoolchildren in front of the Journal building, I recognized the nun standing in the back row. My parents also think she is Sister Prudentienne Chevalier. At the time the picture was taken, she was known as Sister Alice. She taught at Our Lady of Mercy. Diane Seguin Bacon\n\n* * *\n\nWhat a great treat it has been for me and my twin sister Ginny to try to piece together our family history in the last year and a half. I have had many great people help me along the way and have recently returned from Quebec City where I did research at the Gabrielle Roy Library on my ancestors. They were English speaking Irish settlers in Quebec city who were commercial merchants and timber trade workers in the early 1830's. They were Hugh MACADAMS(MCADAMS) and Anne (nee ROBINSON. ) and lived in the Gowen's Buildings on Saint Peter Street in the lower town. He and his large family are recorded on the Drouin Records and we have managed to locate his grave, his wife, my great,great grandfather Alexander Macadams, and two spinster sisters. Many of the younger deaths in the 1840's are recorded in the Drouin records but we can't find their graves. A visit to the old St.Mathew's cemetery and library records of the tombstones did not find them either.In anycase Alexander MACADAMS moved on after marrying a Sarah Emma MURPHY in Quebec to have a family of his own. We have traced them to Essa Township on the 1861 census in Simcoe County Ontario( kind of near Barrie ont.) with the first of their children. The third eldest was a daughter who lived and died in between the census of 1861 and 1871 and her recorded death was reported in an Ottawa newspaper. The first son also died young on a visiting trip to Ste Foy in 1866 and is buried there. My direct relative was Alexander Humphrey MACADAMS born in Quebec City on June 8, 1859. His sister was born in 1864 in Ontario, perhaps in Essa Township or maybe in London City(London, Ontario) as that was their next home on the 1871 census. Her name was Stella Maris MACADAMS and she is the person I wish to ask you about. Stella Maris MACADAMS was married twice, once to a Mr. BELFORD and listed as a wealthy socialite from Quebec. I know this because her second husband was rather famous, or should I say infamous! He was an artist who met her in London, England in 1901 and married her in Paris the same year.She was a young wealthy widow from Quebec who travelled over to England with her uncle Albert Alexander Humphrey who was there to sell a gold mine. ( St. George, Beauce region...st.Onge gold mine) of which he worked as the mine superintendent. She was said to be married to a Belford. I wonder if you know of any Belford's who married a Stella Maris MACADAMS and died before 1899? Her life with her new husband, Charles CONDER is outlined in detail in an online book called Charles CONDER: The Last Bohemian. written by Ann Galbally, of the University of Melbourne, Austr.in 2003. Stella Maris is mentioned in the book, Annie younger sister is also there, Alexander MACADAMS is mentioned as her father. I am pretty sure this is my family in print! Even though the MACADAMS, Murphy's and Humphrey's are all related I have not been able to locate much information on the Humphrey line or on the Belford line. Several ship manifests have listed Stella as a wife going to Ireland in the early 1890's but I don't know if that means he lived in Ireland? Any help you could give me would be great. I have heard of some Belford's in the Eastern Township area and don't know if you have too? The publishing Belford in the USA don't seem to have married any Stella's as far as I can see. I think it would have to be a fairly wealthy Belford, as she was a wealthy widow. My interests in the Macadams family started when my grandmother died at 101 yrs old and her birth cert. had another father's name on it than we all thought it would be. OPPS!!! SO the search continues for Alexander H. Macadams who was my grandmothers birthfather who abandoned her at 18 months or thereabouts. I thought if you knew any leads for the Belford connection I could get started on that vein of the family as well. Thank you in advance for any help you can give me. Patsy Joosse pjoosse@rogers.com\n\nPatsy Here is a note received from Tim Belford, long time CBC Radio personality, in answer to your request.\n\nHi, Thanks for the note. Unfortunately I can't help. Although my family did live in Quebec (Richmond) about a hundred years ago none married a Macadams. As far as I know, there are two different branches of the Belford family that arrived in the early 19th century and settled in Ontario. Whether or not they were related I'm not sure, although they both originated in the same area of Ireland. At present, I believe there are only two Belfords in Quebec - myself and my son. Tim Belford Also There is a Mrs. Hugh Macadams living at 26 1/2 St. Genevieve St., St. John (Quebec City listing). There is also a William Macadams living in the same residence but held a law office, 20 St. Peter St., Lower Town. This from the Dominion Directory 1871. No Belford found in Quebec City listings in that year.\n\nAccording to the 1901 Census there are 86 Belfords in Canada with 60 of those people in Quebec. There were more in 1911.\n\n* * *\n\nMy name is Thomas LEES. I was born in Sherbrooke in 1944 and was raised in Beebe/Rock Island until 1963. My parents were Thomas LEES and Violet MELVIN. I have managed to find (or knew) of much of my immediate family's background. What I do not have are the following:\n\n1 - Copy of marriage certificate of parents (Thomas and Violet Melvin) married 22 Aug 1931 in Beebe.\n\n* * * (For all birth, marriages and deaths in Quebec since 1900 the certificates are available from Quebec. A form is available or you can order online with a credit card. http://www.formulaire.gouv.qc.ca/cgi/affiche_doc.cgi?dossier=10819&sujet=89 There is a link in blue near the bottom of the birth certificate information for the other forms). 2 - Copies of death certificates of parents Thomas (died 7 Mar 1979 in Rock Island) and Violet (died 10 Jan 1968 in Stanstead). Both are buried at Crystal Lake Cemetery in Stanstead. 3- Copies of death certificates of grandparents John (died 31 Aug 1950 in Beebe) and Jean (nee PATERSON) (died 1951 in Beebe). Both are buried at Woodside Cemetery in Beebe 4 - My father and his mom and dad and siblings came to Canada about 1912 (a guess). Is there any way to find out exactly date/ ship/port? * * * (Being British they did not have a problem coming to Canada. Ships passenger lists are available. They can be time consuming, microfilms can be borrowed from the National Archives through inter-library loan. The Journal says at the time of their 25 anniversary Aug. 18, 1956, that they were natives of Scotland. The first entry I find for them is the birth of a son July 10, 1936). 5 - Any census records available? * * *(The last Canadian census available to researchers is the 1911. If your folks came to Quebec early enough in 1911 they may be listed). http://automatedgenealogy.com/census/index.html 6- Any wills/testaments/inventories copies available for Father (Thomas) and grandfather (John). * * *(Several Lee wills registered here in Stanstead but none for Lees. Perhaps they had to go through the court system if they did not have a notarial will).

I Would like to know where else I might look for info on my 3x Grandfather Jean Dosithe LAVALLEE He was Baptized in St. Cesaire, Quebec. in September 1830. His Parents Joseph LAVALLEE and Jossette PELLETIER moved to Colchester, Vt. area around 1838. Jean (John LOVELY on census reports) Married Marie DUBE around 1848-1849 I am looking for there marriage record. I have found his brothers Francis and Charles marriage records in the old town of Winooski records. I have looked in the 2 church record books numerous times. St Joseph and St Mary (Immaculate Conception). I Have been doing this for ten years now and don't know where else to look? I heard about the book \"Quebec Parish & Missionary Records of Northern New York & Vermont: Baptisms, Marriages, Burials & Abjurations\" But I"
