Run by the Folding@home Consortium, a worldwide network of research laboratories focusing on a variety of different diseases, Folding@home seeks to address problems in human health on a scale that is infeasible by another other means, sharing the results of these large-scale studies with the research community through peer-reviewed publications and publicly shared datasets. During the COVID-19 epidemic, Folding@home focused its resources on understanding the vulnerabilities in SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, and working closely with a number of experimental collaborators to accelerate progress toward effective therapies for treating COVID-19 and ending the pandemic. In the process, it created the world's first exascale distributed computing resource, enabling it to generate valuable scientific datasets of unprecedented size. More information about Folding@home's COVID-19 research activities at the Folding@home COVID-19 page. In addition to working directly with experimental collaborators and rapidly sharing new research findings through preprint servers, Folding@home has joined other researchers in committing to rapidly share all COVID-19 research data, and has joined forces with AWS and the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) to share datasets of unprecedented side through the AWS Open Data Registry, indexing these massive datasets via the MolSSI COVID-19 Molecular Structure and Therapeutics Hub.

These tables provide accurate predictions of the astronomical tide (i.e., the change in water level due to the gravitational effects of the moon and sun and the rotation of the Earth); however, they cannot predict water-level changes due to wind, atmospheric pressure, and river flow, which are often significant.\n\nThe National Ocean Service (NOS) has the mission and mandate to provide guidance and information to support navigation and coastal needs. To support this mission, NOS has been developing and implementing hydrodynamic model-based Operational Forecast Systems.\n\nThis forecast guidance provides oceanographic information that helps mariners safely navigate their local waters. This national network of hydrodynamic models provides users with operational nowcast and forecast guidance (out to 48 â 120 hours) on parameters such as water levels, water temperature, salinity, and currents. These forecast systems are implemented in critical ports, harbors, estuaries, Great Lakes and coastal waters of the United States, and form a national backbone of real-time data, tidal predictions, data management and operational modeling.\n\nNowcasts and forecasts are scientific predictions about the present and future states of water levels (and possibly currents and other relevant oceanographic variables, such as salinity and temperature) in a coastal area. These predictions rely on either observed data or forecasts from a numerical model. A nowcast incorporates recent (and often near real-time) observed meteorological, oceanographic, and/or river flow rate data. A nowcast covers the period from the recent past (e.g., the past few days) to the present, and it can make predictions for locations where observational data are not available. A forecast incorporates meteorological, oceanographic, and/or river flow rate forecasts and makes predictions for times where observational data will not be available. A forecast is usually initiated by the results of a nowcast.\n\nOFS generally runs four times per day (every 6 hours) on NOAA's Weather and Climate Operational Supercomputing Systems (WCOSS) in a standard Coastal Ocean Modeling Framework (COMF) developed by the Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS).

The time-dependent nature of the strip DEM files allows users to perform change detection analysis and to compare observations of topography data acquired in different seasons or years. The mosaic DEM tiles are assembled from multiple strip DEMs with the intention of providing a more consistent and comprehensive product over large areas.
