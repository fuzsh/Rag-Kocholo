Was born in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, March 8, 1811; came West in 1839. He joined the Christian Church in 1858.\n\nWe sorrow not as those who have no hope, for while his place in the Church is made vacant, he fills a more exhalted station among the redeemed in glory. His mortal remains were taken to the house of worship on the following Sabbath morning, where the funeral services took place. A large company of friends followed the body to its last resting place. May the survivors of the departed father and husband be comforted and re-united in their home above.

Most of his life was spent in Morgantown. He owned a farm near there which he operated and years ago he also had a mill in the town. Quite a number of years ago he bought a farm near Eminence and moved to it. After the death of his wife about 1916 he came to Martinsville and made his home with his son Charles Coleman, until he moved to Arkansas, seven years ago.\n\nMr. Coleman was an earnest member of the Methodist Church and was a charter member of the Odd Fellows lodge at Morgantown. In politics he was a Republican. He was a man of fine character and had many friends in this city and over the county.\n\nCollett, Samuel E.\n\nDOD: 9 Dec 1860\n\nAge 15 years, 3 months, and 19 days.

He was orphaned at an early age and was raised by his aunt and uncle, Juraldine Tardee Collins and John Calvin Hensley in Tipton County, IN.\n\nHe came to Mercer County, MO in 1856 and was married to Sophia Lusk in 1860, the daughter of Charles Lusk and Lucinda Mix. They moved to Ohio in 1861, but in 1864 moved back to Mercer County, where they resided until his death.\n\nTo this union 10 children were born, Horace Bassett, Velma Effie, Bascom Everett, Emerson Roscoe, Althea V., Clifton Ogilva, Tennie, Wilkie Absalom, Belva V., and Vinnie E., all of whom survive, except Althea V. who died in infancy.\n\nMr. Collins came to his death from the rupture of a blood vessel in the brain due to a fracture of the skull sustained in early life.\n\nFuneral services were conducted from the residence by W. C. Cater after which the remains were interred in Freedom Cemetery. For many years the deceased had been a leading citizen in the affairs of Mercer County, and was always on the right side of moral and social questions. We believe no man in the community had a wider circle of friends. He was an affectionate husband, a kind father, and an accommodating neighbor, and his wife and children have the sympathy of all in their bereavement.\n\nPeace to his ashes.\n\nComer, Jesse\n\nDOB: 1800\n\nDOD: 30 Oct 1835\n\nAge 35 years, 8 months, 3 days.

She was married to G. W. Egbert, Feb. 11, 1847. She died Jan. 4, 1876. Her disease was pneumonia, which speedily terminated her life. She was the mother of 6 children - two sons and four daughters - who survive her.\n\nHer life was pre-eminently an exemplary one. I appreciate that she had not an enemy in the world. She was domestic in her habits and answered the apostalic description of a good and prudent woman, i.e. \"discreet, chaste, keeper at home, obedient to their husbands.\" In a word, she spent her life in the strict discharge of her domestic affairs, which duties she discharged well. She was at peace with all the world, and when she laid herself down to die, she had no misgivings, but met death composedly and \"like a hero in the strife,\" Alas! Mother, wife, sister, friend, farewell, farewell!

He died this morning at about 3 o'clock, at his residence, in Morgan County. He was only sick a few days, and I have not learned what the physicians called his disease. ~~John Gross~~\n\nWe have been intimately acquainted with Brother Ephraim Goss for more than 20 years. He became a disciple of Christ about the time we first became acquainted with him, and united with the church at \"Old Union\" meeting house, in Owen County. But when a church was established at Liberty, in the western part of Morgan County, it being more convenient for him, he united with the congregation at that point, and up to the day of his death, lived an acceptable member of the church.\n\nHe was a good citizen, an obliging neighbor, and affectionate friend, and a tender hearted and kind husband and father.\n\nCommunity has lost much in the death of Brother Goss, as he was one of her most public spirited and enterprising citizens. The church has lost one of her most liberal and substantial members; but his family have lost most of all. But we are assured that those who die in the Lord shall come again when the Lord comes, we therefore sorrow not as those who have no hope. We truly sympathize with sister Goss and her bereaved family. May the Lord sustain them by his grace.\n\nGuy, William\n\nDOD: 28 Jan 1841\n\nCounty Cemetery Index\n\nSpouse: Keziah Wellman\n\nAge 52.
