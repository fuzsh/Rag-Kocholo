        "text": "Gee, kids, do I have a surprise for you! This month, as a special added attraction, you're not going to have to put up with my usual petulant performance of, \"Aw-GollyMoses, I wish you guys would send me some news.\"\n\nNope, because I got some myself. So there! I got it a few weekends ago in the environs of the fair city of Boston. The Dartmouths and the Harvards played a football game, as you may have heard by now, and I made it a point to be on hand to witness the return of amateurism to the college sport. Quite aside from my reportorial activities, it was a good thing I did, too, because, if this game was any criterion, I'm all for it. Amateurism, I mean. Best Harvard game I've seen.\n\nBut, on to the news. Clap on your deerstalker and don your Inverness and try to keep up, please! Item One, I was the lucky recipient of the top-drawer hospitality of Joeand Ann Palamountain, those bright young Harvard faculty things. Before the game, we attended what is fast becoming a Boston in: stitution, and long may it prosper, Dick Lee'i gay soiree. (The only tarnishing spot was that Barbara wasn't present, being oft in Europe!) There I saw Ed McLaughlin, that pillar of the Boston bar (no, no, he's a lawyer!), Paul Vaitses, the man to tell you how the market is oscillating and an aldermanic candidate in ? (there's where that system of writing things on your cuff breaks down, Farley; the cuffs wear away); and Jack and Euie Callihan, both looking fine, although Jack told me he was just rounding back into form after a long and trying bout with colitis. Bob and BobbieMyers were scheduled to arrive, but babysitting problems balked them at the last moment. From the Callihans, I learned that the other member of the Crosby triumvirate, PeteGeisler, has gone Latin on us and is in Rio as an account executive for J. Walter Thompson.\n\nAt the game, I found myself next to Dr. andMrs. Bob Giles and just down the way was George Sumner. Jim and Marie O'Shea dropped by for a post-game chat, and the good doctor must be ministering well to Andoverites. He certainly looked prosperous.\n\nNow, to the mail. I even have some of that, too. First at hand is a letter from Sid Bull, who manfully says, \"I wouldn't want you to go through five years as class secretary without at least one note from me.\" There, I contend, are noble sentiments. He reports that he and Dicky were blessed with their first child, a boy, on August 29. The lad's handle is Howard Jon, but, as Sid says, the Jon will probably \"become just plain 'J,' or at least it would if my parents decorated me with the name of Jon Bull.\" Sid is still with Gulf Oil, a sales man recently transferred from the Forest Hills to the Beverly, Mass., district and lives at 21 Liberty Avenue, Lexington, Mass. He reports that Proc Page, through the addition of his third child, was sprung by the Army and is back at his printer's turtle in Burlington, Vt. The newest Page is a boy and the third of these one-time roommates, Black Jack Corwith, also recently sired a son and heir.\n\nThe champion '42 correspondent, the peripatetic Dick Lippman, is next at the dish. You all thought he was in Toledo, 0., hah? Well, lads, that's where you're wrong. He's now in Philadelphia as an account executive with the advertising firm of Ed Shapiro, Inc. But the Lipp is full of surprises. He's getting married, too, on December 23 to Miss Debby Rivkin, presently a senior at the University of Pennsylvania. The ceremony will take place at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Philadelphia and, after a wedding trip, the Lippmans will be at home at the Duval Manor, Greene and Johnson streets, in the scrapple city.\n\nIf all that weren't enough, Dick comes through with the news that he recently lunched with Bill Housel and Jack Hagy and saw those worthies, along with Diet Lamade and Fritz Heinbokle at the Penn game. \"Each,\" he adds, \"with their respective beautiful wives.\"\n\nAnother worthy, the aforementioned Dr.Giles, weighs in with an informative letter. Bob is in the Army Medical Corps, and he and Pat and Carol, 8, Ben, 5, and Dick, 11/2, are stationed at Fort Devens, Mass. This fall, he relates, they had a visit from Dick and Barbara Smith and one of their two sons (the other, he explained, is \"too young for such a weekend party\"). Dick has been in Germany and Austria for the past five or six years with Pan-American Airways and he and Barbara were home for a long-ish Stateside visit before returning for another tour of duty.\n\nBob also says that he saw that skiing southerner, Pat Reilly, in New Orleans. Pat's is a 24-carat Dartmouth family, his wife being Bob's sister Frederica. They have one son, Robin. And Bob had news of Dick Silver, who, along with Betsy, became the proud producer recently of twin girls, Sally and Elida. They have a son Walt, 3.\n\nNewspaper clips tell of the marriage in Waterbury, Conn., September 29, of Miss Jean Margaret Monroe of that city to Harry StoreyHanna Jr., of Bethany, Conn. Harry is associated with the Southern New England Telephone Company in Waterbury, and they are now living at Hoadley House, Bethany.\n\nAnother nuptial note concerns the marriage of Miss June Carly Meder of Fairfield, Conn., to Harold Joseph Eckardt of Rye, N. Y., at Fairfield, September 22.\n\nThis is supposed to be short, so you can get a gander at the fine results Class Agent Ad Winship pried out of us.
