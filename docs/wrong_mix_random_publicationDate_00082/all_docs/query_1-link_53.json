        "text": "Somehow or other, I once again find myself at the old stand, massaging one of the ALUMNI MAGAZINE'S Remingtons. In the past few months I've managed to wear such a wellworn groove between Hanover and Grosse Pointe, Michigan, that I can virtually do it with no hands now.\n\nDue to the fact that this is the month wherein the MAGAZINE publishes all the names of the 1947 Alumni Fund contributors, you lucky readers will have to wade through a third less verbiage before you finally reach the end of my column; which represents a considerable saving of wear and tear on both the optic and olfactory nerves.\n\nTherefore it behooves me to get down to business. On my last trip to the New England states just prior to Christmas, I managed to see Proctor Page, the late bricklayer of this column, in Burlington, where he is still healthy and happy at the Lane Press. Wife Ruth and daughter Candy were off vacationing in Philadelphia, so unfortunately I missed seeing them.\n\nIn Hanover, the main event of that journey was the wedding of Miss Helen Petrou of New York City to Ed Chalfant, instructor in English at a frigid institution of learning called Dartmouth. The event took place at the White Church in Hanover on Saturday, December 20, with Dr. Roy B. Chamberlain, Director of the Dartmouth College Chapel, officiating. Immediately following the ceremony, a small, but intense, reception followed at the home of Prof. Joel Egerer of the English Department. Ed and Helen will be in residence in Hanover as soon as they solve- their personal housing problem, which, in Hanover, approaches the plane of differential calculus.\n\nAlso seen in Hanover were Alex, Betty and Chris Fanelli; Harry, Nancy and {Catherine Bond; Bate Ewart, up visiting his sister and brother-in-law, the aforementioned Bonds; large Charles Camp; Jack and Betty Chandler; and Innmeister Dave Heald, Jane, Davey and Stoney.\n\nNow some grist from the correspondence mills. Top on the list is the shattering news of the marriage of that confirmed bachelor and peripatetic businessman, Robert BaconDewey. The new Mrs. Dewey was the former Miss Marjorie Lucille Ashley, and the ceremony took place Thursday, January 15, at the Brewster Pilgrim Congregational Church in Detroit, followed by a reception at the Detroit Golf Club. My Detroit scout assigned to follow Dewey tells me that his new father-in-law munificently presented the newly-weds with a house as a wedding present, taking care of that difficulty in no uncertain terms. I take more than a little pride in this whole affair, since I had been hinting at it with all the meager innuendo I could muster for the past few months in this column.\n\nA Christmas card from Rosalie and RumseyEwing with a thoughtful accompanying note brought this information: the Ewings celebrated Christmas early with the birth of a 7-pound, 7-ounce baby daughter on December 6. The new Ewing has, as you might suspect, red hair. Red said that though they were back in St. Louis temporarily, they had not given up the idea of ranching it out West and that while out there recently he saw Bill Temple in Denver.\n\nAlso a card from Bob and Linda Burdett, with a note on the back from Bob confirming his marriage on October 3, last. They are the proud possessors of a ten-room house in Swampscott, and Bob says that he sees RalphMorrison, Charley Brown, Dick Godfrey and Ad Winship from time to time.\n\nAnother from Craig Kuhn, telling of his trials and tribulations at Pitt Law School, which ordeal' he expects to weather by this coming July. In addition to his studies and familial duties, he is editing The Pitt LawReview. Other Christmas cards in hand are from Bob and Bobbie Myers, Anne and JoePalamountain and Joe McCormick. There were very likely others, but my already shaky filing system now has the blind staggers, being divided haphazardly between Hanover and Grosse Pointe.\n\nTwo announcements of additions to the '42 family, Diane Delacroix Gates, daughter of Don and Dotty Gates, born December 27, 1947, Fox Point, Wisconsin, weight seven pounds, three ounces. Martha Jane Parmer, daughter of Bill and Jane Parmer, born December 22, 1947, Dumont, New Jersey.\n\nFrom the clipping service: the marriage of Miss Doris Eleanor Schwannhausser to Walter Friend on December 20, 1947, at Christ Church, Short Hills, N. J.\n\nAnd the last item, courtesy of Luce's Clipping Bureau: Robert C. Crane was appointed to the board of directors of the Central Home Trust Company on December 9, 1947. He is also vice-president of the Junior Chamber of Commerce, Newark; vicepresident of the New Jersey Press Association; and vice-president and general manager of The Elizabeth Daily Journal.\n\nIn closing, I hope the publication of the Fund contributors will serve as an early reminder that this year's drive is not too far distant and that you should cooperate as well with our new Class Agent, Ad Winship, as you did with me. As a matter of fact, remembering last year's returns, cooperate better.\n\nFund, Contributors for 1947 Total gifts: $3,262.50 (77% of objective). JAMES L.
