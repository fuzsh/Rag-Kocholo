        "text": "I have passed Rossleighan countless times …. on the way to the dump! But I have never actually seen it. It is included because of its relevance to the social history of Clonreher and Lamberton. This post is more about genealogy and the human condition than architectural history. Though I would love to be able to put up a photo of Rossleighan if any one has one that they would let me use.\n\nThe 1838 OS survey shows a small farmhouse at Rossleaghan. The present house, and Rossleaghan Villa on the opposite side of the road, now a care home, are probably both post 1850. The “Ross” part of the name is easy – it means a wood. The OS letters of 1838 suggests Ros liathán, ‘wood of the grey man’. The Irish Places Names prefers Ó Liatháin’s Wood – a name anglicised to Lyons. The townland belonged to the Kelly family Clonreher, and passed by inheritance to the Bunburys, the Tydds and the Moores, who were certainly resident there up to 1930\n\nThe earliest reference in the press is to the appalling behaviour of the Foran and Whelan families in 1833\n\nOn Monday last an inquest was held in Maryborough, to inquire the cause of the death of Daniel Molloy, (upwards of 70 years old,) who expired on the previous Friday night in a ditch near Maryborough. Molloy was turned out by his relatives, with whom he had lived for nearly 20 years, and was refused admission into any other house; He lay for twenty-nine days and nights previous to his death in the open fields, where he was left to perish by his unnatural relatives in a populous vicinity. The jury found that the said Daniel Molloy came to his death from emaciation, and exposure of his person in a ditch in the open air ; where he was suffered to remain for weeks previous to his death, abandoned and forlorn, by his relatives and friends, viz. Catharine Whelan, Elizabeth Whelan, Margaret Whelan, Daniel Foran, Thomas Foran, James Foran, senior, and James Foran, junior. The persons named were committed by the coroner to the county gaol. — Dublin Evening Post – Thursday 26 September 1833.\n\nThe following year later James Foran was fined 5/- and committed to jail for assault on 24 Nov 1834. He is in the papers again in 1847, when hunger was biting – the potato crops of autumn 1845 and 46 had failed, and the country is 18 months into the famine.\n\nA carrier named Martin Hughes, from Ballinakill, was robbed by three men of a bag of rice, and a jar of whisky, on Monday night, in the vicinity of Maryborough. Constable Johns and Sub-constable Gibbon, having heard of the robbery immediately proceeded to Rosleighan, the scene of its perpetration, accompanied by Hughes. From the spot where Hughes was robbed, they traced the tracks of two men to a dung-heap near Mr. Clark’s barn (John Clark who was leasing Clonreher). Here the jar of whisky was found buried. From the dung-heap the tracks were again traced back, a distance of about perch,(200 m – a perch is 40 rood and a rood is 5 m) to the house of men named Foran in that neighbourhood. No other tracks intervened, either forward or backward, the time. On entering the house, Thomas Foran and his two brothers were seated at the fire, Hughes pointed out Thomas, as one of the men who robbed him ; he also pointed out a pitchfork behind the door, which he said resembled the one with which one of the three men struck him. Kings County Chronicle – Wednesday 17 February 1847\n\nOn the same day the paper ran two other famine related stories:-\n\nThe pay clerk of Maryborough East, has paid upwards of £l,800 on the relief works in the Barony, since the 14th November last. It would be interesting to know what the usual cost of relief was per quarter.\n\nA small girl was robbed of a stone of flour, on the Woodville road, near Maryboro’, on Sunday evening. The person who robbed her also attempted to take her cloak. In the same locality, on Monday evening a boy named Keys was robbed of a bottle of whisky, and 2s 6d worth of bread, which he was taking to Mr. Samuel Campion, of Lalor’s mills. Kings County Chronicle – Wednesday 17 February 1847\n\nA year later the situation is even more desperate. Evening Standard – Monday 03 January 1848\n\nOn the afternoon of last Thursday a carrier named John Doran was attacked by 20 men at Rosleighan, near Maryborough, and plundered of nine sacks of oatmeal, the property of James Sheane, Esq ., of Mountmelick. The Maryborough police, after a diligent search, succeeded in recovering two sacks of the meal, concealed in a field about a mile from the scene of outrage. We understand that the executive has refused, except on extraordinary occasions, to give military escort if the absence of police to protect provisions in their transmission from one town to another; but recommends that special constables be sworn in for that purpose, particularly at the cost of the owners of the bread- stuffs transmitted. If millers are not afforded sufficient protection in the transmission of their flour and meal, society will be soon reduced to a deplorable state, for of what use will money be if we cannot get food to purchase . This is the third plunder of provisions within the last fortnight, on the road between Maryborough and Mountmelick.\n\nOn Friday morning, Timothy Boughan set fire to an out-house Rosleighan, the property Rev. J, T. Moore; He then gave himself up to the police Maryboiough ; stated what he had done, and said his object was to get himself transported. The offender is from Streamstown, County Westmeath. (about 60 km away) Southern Reporter Tuesday 06 November 1849\n\nRev John Tydd Moore inherited his father’s massive estate in 1846. It appears that he was a very enlightened landlord, and as a result by 1851 he was negotiating the sale of the main estate at Lamberton for £14,000 to clear the debts that had accrued during the famine. This is probably when Rossleaghan Lodge was built.\n\nOn the 15 June 1853, at St. Thomas, Dublin, the Rev. Arthur Moore, eldest son of the Rev. John Tydd Moore, of Lamberton Park, in the Queen’s County, to Harriette, relict of Major Murray, of Baliina, County Mayo. Published: Reading Mercury At this stage he had definitely left Lamberton, but the social standing that it gave still reflected on the family. For instance Magan of Umma More will give a far longer line of credit that Magan of North London, or even than Magan of Castletown. The importance of place is part of the Gaelic psyche.\n\nOn 23 Aug 1856 there was a deed of conveyance for property near the town of Maryborough in Queen’s County between the Rev. John Tydd Moore of Rosleighan Lodge, Queen’s County and Thomas Turpin of Maryborough.\n\nlt is seldom that we have had to record a more terrific thunder-storm than occurred in the neighbourhood of Maryborough on Friday evening last. At nearly five o’clock it commenced, and the oldest inhabitant, even those who have seen foreign parts, never recollect to have witnessed such continued vivid and violent lightning coupled with most awful thunder. It continued with scarcely any intermission till nearly midnight, and part of the time the most copious rain poured out of the heavens, actually forming rivers in the driest places. Even horses and other animals were nearly paralysed with fear and the horses actually screamed with fright. We have as yet heard of no damage done, excepting what has happened to the small but beautiful greenhouses and conservatories belonging the Rev. J. T. Moore, Rossleighan Lodge.\n\nSoon after six o’clock the dreadful fluid struck down one of the chimneys of a range of greenhouses, 80 feet long, bursting the chimney ; entering the house through the glass at the end, it ran, conducted the wire trellis, up and down the inside, destroying most splendid crop grapes, just ripe, as well the vines and other lovely plants ; Most providentially the gardener and attendants had at the beginning the storm, made for their homes, dreading the torrents rain, otherwise it is more than probable that some of them would have been attending their charge these houses, as is their habit.\n\nDublin Evening Packet and Correspondent – Tuesday 18 June 1861. cf Clonraher 1877\n\nHis wife’s mother had had a very long life – Rebekah Bockett had died at Southcote Lodge in 1857 at the age of 92.\n\nHis sister in law was not so lucky, dying on 7 Jan 1862, aged 56, at Rathregan Rectory, Dunshaughlin. – Augusta Bockett had married Rev John H Dunn, then of Coolrain, in 1843. Later in 1862 John Tydd Moore suffered a stroke. In the Leinster Express October 11, 1862 Rossleighan is advertised to let, its owner suffering from ill health and having to leave. Money is still a problem and 14 February 1863 the Landed Estates Court was inviting creditors to apply for payment from the sale of The Rev. John Tydd Moore’s property at Derrytrasna (Moore Valley House) to Edmond, Patrick and Walter Sweetman.\n\n12 January, 1865. The Freeman’s Journal reported that the unfortunate man had taken his own life. “Rev. John Tydd Moore, incumbent of the valuable living of Erke, in the diocese of Ossory, committed suicide on Friday morning last in his residence near Maryborough. He rose about 9 o’clock, and was supplied with his shaving materials by his valet, who then saw nothing strange in his appearance or conduct. Sometime afterward a housemaid entered the room and found him lying on the bed with his throat completely severed and the razor which he had used beside him. At the inquest which was held the following day a verdict of ‘temporary insanity’ was returned. The unfortunate gentleman was the eldest son of the late Hon. Arthur Moore, for many years a puisne judge of the common pleas. The living which is worth 500l. per annum, reverts to the Crown.’\n\nCharlotte Moore stayed on, running the farm. Her son Rev Arthur was serving in a parish in Mayo and about to be promoted to be Dean of Achonry (Killala). On 22 July 1866 her daughter Caroline died, aged 45, the wife of Richard Hawkesworth, Esq., of Forest, Mountrath.\n\nAs soon as they are old enough the Dean sends his sons down to look after their grandmother and run the farm. They rather let him down. On 17 February 1877 there are five suits by Murdoch Campbell against the Moore brothers and four counter-suits in the courthouse.\n\nWhilst Murdock Campbell’s ploughman was having lunch Arthur Moore, whose family had retained the shooting rights over Clonreher, removed the steel pointed sock from the plough. The following day he was pretty beastly to the ploughman. A week later Campbell met Arthur on the farm and asked had he come to take off another sock from the plough. Moore responded his father never was a blacksmith, implying that Campbell’s was, and that Campbell himself was a puppy, and that everyone in the country knew he was a puppy. The next day John and Arthur Moore called up to Clonreher. Campbell thought that they were there to apologise, instead of which Arthur punched him. Fortunately John Kavanagh, Mr. Campbell’s gardener, came up, and an end was put to the affair.\n\nIn Court the Moore’s lawyer, John Roe, described Campbell Murdoch as “pampered, ignorant, and inflated”. His version was that Campbell said Arthur Moore was a puppy in a muttering manner. Moore told him to repeat it, but he did not. Moore then told Campbell he was a contemptable puppy. The upshot was that Moore was fined £5, though the rows continued for the following year. On reading the case as reported it is very hard to be sympathetic to the Moore brothers, who seem to be a complete pair of wallys.\n\nSaturday, May 29, 1880 the house is advertised to let for 5 years in the Leinster Express. It does not let and the Freeman’s Journal – Friday 07 May 1897 announced “The Lord Chancellor has appointed Captain Arthur Moore, Rosleighan, Maryborough, to the Commission of the Peace for the Queen’s County”.\n\nAt Exmouth, Devon, Charlotte, widow of the Rev. John Tydd Moore, M.A., Oxon, Rector of Eirke, Ireland last surviving daughter of the late John Bockett, Esq., of Southcote Lodge, Beading, aged 86, on the 9th inst., Reading Mercury – Saturday 17 June 1882\n\nHer son, Dean Arthur Moore died a month later on 7 July 1882 at Rossleaghan aged 63, of Pneumonia, still with his deanery in Ballymote where he had been since 1872\n\nHarriette Moore, one of the Dean’s daughters, married Francis Gethin in Feb 1882, with her sister Elizabeth Charlotte Moore as one of the witnesses, just before the death of her father and grandmother. On 14 January 1885 the Dean’s youngest daughter Caroline married Robert Persse Fitzpatrick, son of the Rev Frederick Fitzpatrick and Olivia , Lord Headfort’s daughter. Once again Elizabeth was witness.\n\nThe Dean’s sons now owned Rossleaghan jointly, but Arthur seems to have joined the regular army and travelled. John remained at home with ever increasing money troubles. In 1889 the bank sent in the sheriff to seize property and discovered that he made over everything that he could to the housekeeper Mary Pilsworth Leinster Leader – Saturday 26 January 1889. A trailer seized by the sheriff’s bailiff had to be relinquished after Mary Pilsworth (the sister of the apothecary in Portlaoise, she had worked for the Moores for nearly 40 years) swore an affidavit claiming that the goods had passed to her under a bill of sale in consideration of wages due. It was a bit mean of John Gore Moore to put Mary through this at the age of 69 – though Moore was in his mid thirties!\n\nIn April 1901 John Gore Moore married Henrietta Galway, daughter of William Galway from Ardee, and they had 4 daughters. Henrietta had a miscarriage in the Adelaide and died in 1912. Moore was still resident at Rossleighan in March, 1916 when the Nationalist was reporting on his problems with horses and Mr Jessop. War and revolution rather push his story out of the press!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Weekly Irish Times on Saturday 19 September 1908 reported that, on their annual outing, Lord Walter Fitzgerald told the Kildare Archaeological Society, so far as Clonreher Castle was concerned it had no definite history.\n\nAndrew Tierney in the Buildings of Ireland begs to differ. As the corner towers mimic a scaled down version of Fort Protector he suggests a colonial builder such as John Dunkerley, Sovreign of Naas, who was granted land here in 1563. Unlike Coolbanagher Castle, whose ruins were demolished after the storm of 2014 rather than being made safe, (a disgrace for which Laois should blush) Clonreher is still in reasonable condition though repointing and remedial treatment of mural cracks should be carried out without delay to avoid another embarrassing tragedy. The images of the cracked tower were taken in 2018 and are borrowed from irelandinruins.blogspot.com\n\nDunkerley’s grant actually refers to the castle of Clonreher, and Fitzwilliam’s accounts note that Dunkerley owes £253 for “victualling his fort in Leix” in 1565. It may have been built post 1547 as an outer defence for Fort Protector. Or it may have been built by the O’Dowling – there is an account that Sir Ralph Bagenal took it from the O’Dowlings. Bagenal, the Lieutenant of Leix and Offaly under Edward VI, had been dismissed for denying the Papal supremacy in 1554, and sought refuge in France, where he lived by selling at a great sacrifice a property worth 500l. a year.\n\nThe rath was probably the original O’Dowling residence – From Helen Roe’s “Tales and Customs of Laoighs”, Folklore of Ireland Society , June 1939\n\nNear Portlaoighise, there is a rath on the land of Clonreher. The ground was being adapted for a coursing club, and some of the trees growing on this rath were cut down. One tree fell and killed the man who was felling it. When the tree trunks were being drawn away from the field the chains holding them broke; the tree trunks rolled off the cart, and killed the man who was drawing them away. For many years a certain amount of ill luck followed all the coursing meetings held on this field, and quite recently one of the original promoters of the scheme was found dead on the banks of this rath. (Frank Kelly, in August 1933).\n\nDaniel Byrne-Rothwell’s 2012 article on Clonreher gives a full account of the early history, though he does not mention that it is also claimed as the birthplace of St Fintan of Clonenagh (Carloviana-No-22-197 p10)\n\nThe Fiants of Queen Elizabeth in 1576 record Thomas Myrrick as in possession and it is granted to Robert Hartpole. https://www.logainm.ie/\n\nIt was granted to Sir Pierce Crosby in 1628, but was already in the possession of his father Patrick Crosbie (aka Mac Crossan, hereditary Bard to the O’More) before 1600 (Calendar of the Patent and Close Rolls of Chancery in Ireland of the Reign Charles I p 360)\n\nClonreher Castle was “slighted” (made indefensible) in 1656 by the Cromwellians and the lands confiscated. In 1664 Phillimore’s calendar of wills records the will of Richard Crosbie of Clonriher, Queen’s Co. Charles II granted Clonreher to Thomas Dongan, Earl of Limerick (1634 – 1715) in 1670. Dongan, Governor of New York under Charles II and James II, forfeited Clonreher together with his many estates, in 1692 for his support of James II (they are a fascinating family worthy of a post of their own – the name come from the Norman – Dungeon!)\n\nWe are now approaching the period when the current house was built, and there are two stories that don’t quite work within the available timeline. The first is the duplicitous Dunne.\n\nThis is a story told by Daniel O’Byrne in “The History Of The Queen’s County”; the Castle passed to the Dunne family, and that the last member of the Dunnes who possessed Clonreher was married to a lady of remarkable beauty. Their three daughters married into ‘respectable’ farming families with gentry connections. Catherine Dunne married into the Conways, Winifred Dunne to the Dalys and Sarah Dunne to the Mihens (Meehan). Catherine Conway’s daughter married a Kelly and their daughter Margaret Kelly 1770-1847 married Walter Byrne, grandson of John Byrne of Timogoue, (brother of Sir Gregory Byrne, Cromwell’s tailor – but that’s another story!)\n\nThe point of this story is that the dastardly Dunne had “a doxy”, a secret mistress, a servant in the castle, who bore him a son, and he married her after his wife died, and the son, becoming a protestant, was able to exclude his half sisters from their inheritance. If this happened it would have had to be post the Popery Act of 1703.\n\nBut by 1714 John Kelly is resident at Clonreher. The Conservation Plan for Fort Protector (Laois Heritage Society) lists him first in 1714 “George Thornton of the City of Dublin and John Kelly of Clonreher leasing a great stone house formerly used as an inn.” He was still dealing in property in May 1725. According to Burke’s Peerage in 1724 Mary Kelly, the daughter of John Kelly of Clonreher married Benjamin Bunbury, son of Mathew Bunbury and Anne Blount.\n\nTurtle Bunbury writes:- When Benjamin Bunbury died in 1765, he had no male heir to the Kilfeacle estate and instead left the property to his eldest daughter, Elizabeth Richardson. His wife survived him by seven years. Her death was recorded as follows in the Freeman’s Journal (courtesy of Bob Fitzsimons): 20-22 Oct 1772. DIED At Clonteer near Maryborough, Mrs Bunbury, by whose death a fortune of £1000 per annum devolves to Benjamin Bunbury Esq.; late Lieutenant in the 3rd Regiment of Horse.\n\nIn 1777 her niece’s husband John Tydd is resident, who moves to Lamberton in the early 1790s. More research is needed into when and to whom it was granted after the Williamite confiscation.\n\nIt is probable that the house was built by John Kelly, and I suspect in the 1730s Tierney is succinct:-“Five bays, two storey with dormer attic. Tall narrow openings, sashes set close to the wall. Eaves course of cogged brick. Bulky stacks in the gable-ends, of characteristic T-shape. Small attic windows flank them, and there is evidence for dormer windows on the front, since removed. Late C18 joinery. Staircase with ramped handrail and scrolled tread-ends, continuing up to the attic.”\n\nAfter Tydd moves to Lamberton there is then silence for 50 years till we read that Mr. George Craig, of County Fermanagh, married Sarah, sixth daughter of Mr. John Miller, Clonrear Castle, Queen’s County. 31 August 1840 Dublin Morning Register\n\nThere was a John Miller who was the postmaster in Portlaoise, but this was a different person.\n\nDeaths:- In Clonreher, near Maryborough, in her 70th year. Mrs. Miller, wife of Mr. John Miller. Clare Journal, 26 August 1844\n\nIn 1846 John Miller of Clonreher is on the Grand Jury\n\nMurdoch Campbell (1808-1874) was a Glaswegian brought to act as steward to Sir Charles Coote at Ballyfin, Co. Laois. The inscription on his gravestone in Ballyfin Church of Ireland church states that ‘by his sole genius and resources he designed and constructed all the works of beauty and solidity in the demesne’. According to Mulligan these works would have included ‘almost certainly the tower, the ornamental rockwork, the menagerie and kennels’.\n\nIn 1846 his son Murdoch jnr was born. In June 1849 Murdoch was a merchant in Mountmellick, selling John Cassels Coffee. It is not clear whether he had left the Coote’s employ, or just had an additional job.\n\nIn 1850, at the time of Griffith’s valuation, John Miller is still in Clonreher, leasing it from Rev John Tydd Moore. The Rev John Mooore, who financial straights are dire, is in a house worth £2/5/- (as opposed to the £12/15/- valuation put on Clonraher, George Hamilton, whose house is valued at £4.00 is living at Cappagh North – R32 P2KC. His son, George Moore Hamilton, born in 1848 and died at Clonreher, a bachelor, in 1905. George Hamilton’s father may have been William Hamilton whose sister Mary (b1771) married Philip Lyster (d 1838), and his brother James married Mary Ann Randall in 1842. His grandparents were butchers in Birr. It would be interesting to see how they are related to the Hamiltons of Roundwood.\n\nAt the launch of Murdoch jnr’s agricultural machinery business in June 1870 Mr Fitzpatrick, Maryborough, said he would not like to see those who had partaken of Mr Campbell’s hospitality separate without drinking the healths both of father and son. He had known Mr Campbell, senior, for a period of at least thirty years, and a more honourable, upright man he never met in all his life, or one more competent to discharge the duties of his position. To show that he was a man well competent to manage such extensive estates as those of Ballyfinn , he would mention that in the famine years when the landed proprietors held a meeting at Maryborough, in accordance with the notice in Labouchere’s letter (well worth a google!), Sir Charles Coote was one of those proprietors who did not borrow a penny from the Board of Works , but of his own ample means employed all the hands on his estates and in the neighbourhood for the purpose of making drains and roads, and otherwise improving the soil. As sole manager Mr Campbell had superintendence of all these works. The Deerpark contained about five hundred acres, and all with the exception of a small portion, was under bog, furze -in fact it was a wide waste. This was valued by himself (Mr Fitzpatrick) in the year 1840 at £26, and in 1843 , by Griffith’s valuation, it was valued at a sum less than that. But by Mr Campbell’s management these lands have been all squared into fields of thirty and forty acres in extent, all bounded with neat thorn-quick hedges, and intersected by well made and well kept farm roads ; and from the soil at one time so wretched , he produces as fine crops of wheat, oats, turnips, clover, and so on, as the country could show. The farm buildings which were erected under Mr Campbell’s superintendence do credit to the Ballyfinn estates ; and the extensive system of stall-feeding pursued is highly remunerative. It would be almost impossible to describe the numerous improvements effected under Mr Campbell’s supervision, but it was a patent fact to every one conversant with the Ballyfinn estates, that his conduct of affairs, and his kind advice to all who sought it, was most beneficial to both employer and employees. He (Mr Fitzpatrick) was delighted to find himself there that day to witness the mowing match got up by Mr Campbell, junior, who he hoped would yet take up his father’s place in the esteem of the gentry and farmers of this county, and he also sincerely hoped he would be as successful as his best friend could wish in his new undertaking\n\nIt is possible (but unlikely) that the Campbells arrived at Clonreher before 1860 and that Ms Cummins was actually a Miss Campbell.\n\nBirths Cummins—At Clonreher, Queen’.

Greenock Advertiser – Tuesday 15 December 1868\n\nAnne Campbell beloved wife of Murdoch Campbell Snr d Apr 25 1869 aged 63 at Clonreher\n\nIn July 1870 the Leinster Express reported on Campbell’s new business:- “On Tuesday last a very interesting exhibition of mowing machines was held on the lands of Clonreher, at which a large number of the gentry and farmers attended, by the special invitation of Mr M. Campbell, jun., who has been for some time engaged extensively in selling agricultural machinery of every invention and best make, together with artificial manures and farm seeds as imported by the most eminent firms in the kingdom. The commodious offices and yards attached to the residence of Mr Campbell, jun., at Clonreher, enables him to keep on stock a large quantity of each of these articles; and as he keeps on hands a supply of the duplicate portions of the machines, this concern must prove a much desired boon to the agriculturists of Maryborough and the wide district of which that town is the centre; and young Mr Campbell, we are sure, will be encouraged and supported in this wide district, which was so long left without such an establishment as that he is now starting. At the present Mr Campbell is largely supplied with implements suited to the requirements of the present season, and it is sufficient to show that these are of the best manufacture , and sold at the most reasonable rate of market profit, when we say that several sales of combined reapers and mowers, together with hay tedders, hay rakes, &c, were effected. At about eleven o’clock Mr Campbell sent his machines to cut down a five acre field of new meadow hay, and the grass being rather thin , the exhibition was one well calculated to afford the many experienced farmers present an opportunity of judging the capabilities of the machines at work. Mr Campbell, we believe, is agent for all the different machines made, but on this occasion he only showed those manufactured by Wood and Samuelson, two of the most, celebrated makers in the world. On the other hand, in justice to another eminent maker, we shall give Samuelson’s machine all the credit due to it—and that is a great deal. The improvements in this year’s machine are very decided, and are of a three-fold character. They are:—1st. A system of draught which takes all weight from the hocks of the horses, at the same time materially lessening the dead draft of the machine. 2nd. The ” inclined-cut” sickle, a novel means of obtaining a lower cut than in any existing mower , with the important advantage of having the sections riveted to the top of the knifebar instead of the bottom ; this is the only position in which a section can be sharpened by a grindstone at all. 3rd. Running the sickle on hardened steel slips, which leave a clear wedge-shaped space between the sickle and the beam. By this means all clogging matters are discharged from beneath the sickle, which is always quite free in its bed, even in the worst bottomed meadows , and the draft rendered extraordinarily light when the cutting is the worst. These slips are removable, and they completely prevent the wearing into the beam by the sickle. When at work the great advantage of these improvements are noticeable to the observer, and as the same advantages extend to the reaper, there need be no hesitation in pronouncing that this machine has almost approached perfection. The prime consideration for farmers is the price of these machines, and as these two great machines axe equal in that respect, the only way to satisfy themselves is by attending such an exhibition as that at Clonreher, and which we understand , will be repeated at no distant day. The five acres of meadow were soon cut down, by the two machines , which were at once purchased up by two gentlemen on the ground.\n\n10 April 1873 Margaret Cunningham Campbell married Thomas Thompson Lagan, a teacher, the son of James Lagan, a builder from Dundee, in the C of I church, Portlaoise.\n\nJuly 1874 Murdoch Campbell snr dies, his son James Campbell present.\n\nThe Queen’s County Show is now being run by young Murdoch:- Mr Murdoch Campbell is the respected proprietor of the Queen’s County Agricultural Implement Manufactory, and being an extensive and enthusiastic agriculturist, besides being deservedly popular, we are sure he will afford complete satisfaction. The show on Wednesday last was a proof that Mr Campbell is the right man in the place which Mr Mowbray made so hard to fill after himself. Kilkenny Moderator – Saturday 18 August 1877\n\nOn Oct 5 1874 Margaret Spelling (nee Coffey) of New Road Maryborough had a daughter Mary whose father was, according to the birth certificate, Murdoch Campbell of Clonreher. On 5 June 1875 the death of the 8 month old Mary Murdoch, a servant’s child, of “diseases of the head” was recorded by the illiterate Margaret Spelling of New Road Maryborough\n\nI suspect Murdoch of misbehaving! However he was an interesting character. As well as being a businessman, land agent, and Senior Deacon in the Maryborough Masonic Lodge, he found the time to do a spot of inventing: In November 1873, The London Gazette reported that he had applied to patent a type of briquette.\n\nLongford Journal – Saturday 30 June 1877 THE RECENT LIGHTNING.. A very large sycamore or beech tree, which is quite close to one end of Clonreher House attracted the lightning, which entered through one the chimneys to an upper room, and continued its course downwards to two rooms immediately underneath. In the upper room a large metal fire grate was completely torn from its bed by the dangerous fluid, and broken into five distinct pieces, whilst in the same room a mirror which lay on chest of drawers at the opposite side was broken into fragments, and the glass slavered in every possible direction. The woodwork of this mirror had completely disappeared, and not trace of quicksilver could be found on the fragments of the broken glass. Continuing its downward course, the lightning burst into the centre room, made clean breach right out through a portion of the brick and solid wall, struck a metal spout reaching from the roof to a water barrel on the ground, and killed an unfortunate grimalkin (an archaic name for a cat, for those who, like me, didn’t know!) who had sought what it probably considered refuge under the barrel from the fearful rain. In the room on the ground floor extensive damage was done, a beautiful Brussels carpet being rendered almost valueless, a massive mahogany chair twisted into shapeless mass, the gilt moulding torn into atoms, and the wall paper stripped from roof to floor. At the time of these occurrences a pigeon in flight was struck and killed, as well as a turkey and duck the ground underneath, and three servants of Mr. Campbell who were in the stables.\n\nSo tempting to end here – I am reminded of an account of a raid by the O’Byrnes on the village of Tallaght in 1805 which reported that they had carried off 7 cows, 5 garron (horses) several goats and sheep and, almost incidentally, 3 women. However this article actually ends with the fact that they were flung violently on the ground, but, very fortunately, did not receive further injuries than the shock of the sudden fall.\n\ncf with the storm of 1861 at Rossleaghan\n\nMurdock jnr married Elizabeth Williams Kerr, though when and here is not quite clear.\n\nQUEEN’S COUNTY.

The folklore collection gives a great example of how oral history and a story teller’s imagination can conflate to give a completely false story Rathleague is situated about two miles out the New Road. This is how it got its name – when the Normans were in Ireland they had many gods. They used have them in forts or raths. They had one at Rathleague in a rath. They used to call it Rain God. As the Normans did not know much about this part of Ireland they had to mark it somehow This is how they knew Rathleague, It was about three (League) miles from the Normans’ camp which was on the Stradbally Road. From then on onwards it was called Rathleague.\n\nThe Kildare Rental in Mac Niocaill’s Crown Surveys of Lands lists William Kelly as occupier in 1518. By 1569 it was in the possession of Francis Cosby\n\nIn Pender’s Census of 1659 Thady Dwigin gent, is of Rathleague. Though totally absent from the current phone book (in the civil records the last one recorded is Michael Duigin of Errill reporting the death of his 80 year old father in 1888), the Duigins or Dwigins were certainly once a Laois family. In 1688 John and Mary Dwigin are taking a case against Edmond Morress (MP for Queen’s County in James II’s 1689 “Patriot Parliament” and killed at the Battle of Aughrim) the Attainders of 1691 name Matthew Dwigin of Dunamase, and James Dwigin of Clonenagh was one of the 15 parish priests registered in Laois in 1704 under one of the earliest penal laws, the Registration Act to prevent the further growth of popery.\n\nDwigin was probably a tenant of Walter Warneford, a Wiltshire Cromwellian who was based at Mountmellick. In 1716 his grandson or great nephew Edmund, winding up some of his Irish affairs, had all his lands mapped. He died in 1726 in Mountmellick, having sold Rathleague to John Parnell in 1716. In 1728 there was an act of the Irish Parliament “Exemplifying the will of Edmund Warneford”. The Warneford family remained Laois landlords till the 1920s, and in the 1890s nearly half their income (£2000 pa) came from Laois tenants. An English Family Through Eight Centuries F. E. Warneford, Elisabeth McDougall 1991\n\nTheir seat was Warenford Place in Wiltshire. In 1960, the James Bond author Ian Fleming bought the then derelict Warneford Place and built a new house which he named Sevenhampton Place, incorporating some elements of the original building. It now belongs to Paddy McNally, the Donegal businessman who made a fortune from Formula 1.\n\nOn 9 April 1716 Thomas Fisher of Rathleague wrote his will (pr 18 July 1718). Wife: Sarah. Son: Henry. Daughters: Margaret & Elinor. Son-in-law Charles Lester. Daughter: Anne Lester. Brother: James Fisher. Daughter: Mary. Son: William. Grandson: John Luttrell. BENTHAM 1.23 F 1700-1754 p21/70. Presumable his brother was James Fisher of Mountrath who died in 1721 and whose daughter married James Calcutt. (BET 1.23 F 1700-1754 p32/101) They were probably Quakers whose family had arrived in Ireland in the 1650s from Elton near Chester (see Searching for the Ancestors of Thomas Fisher Jackie L. Fisher 2005).\n\nA Deed, dated 15 March 1727, in the Deeds Registry, “…last Will and Testament of our father, John PIGOTT, Esq’r, deceased, bearing date the 2nd day of March 1708, the sum of £200 sterling was left to me John PIGOTT as a portion, and the sum of £300 stg was left to me Ann PIGOTT as my portion, also a dividend to each of us of £30 more, our shares of our sister Frances PIGOOTT’s portion deceased…” The Deed was witnessed by Pigott SANDES of Dysart in the Queen’s County, Esq, Warner WESTENRA of Rathleague in the Queen’s County, Esq, and Patrick DALY, a servant to Richard, Earl of Cavan (by whom the monetary shares had been delivered to John and Ann). But Ann PIGOTT alone signed and sealed it. Warner Westenra was the MP for Maryborough from 1727 to 1760, and married Hester Lambert, daughter of Lord Cavan in 1738, whose grandmother was Castilina Gilbert of Kilminchy, 2 miles from Rathleague. He was presumably at Rathleague whilst he was building Heath House into which he moved later that year.\n\nThe first Parnell in Ireland was a Cromwellian from Congleton, 30 miles east of Chester. His grandson was Thomas Parnell (1679-1718) Archdeacon of Clogher, author of the ” Hermit,” and friend of Pope, Swift, Addison, Congreve, and Steele. “The most capable man,” wrote Oliver Goldsmith in his Life, “to make the happiness of those whom he conversed with, and the least able to secure his own.” His wife (Nancy Minchin), a beautiful and amiable lady, died when he was thirty-two years of age, and thereafter a melancholia settled upon him, and he became mentally disordered (a sickness that he treated with alcohol). He suddenly died at Chester in 1717, when on his way from London to Ireland, and was buried there, in his thirty-eighth year, having being predeceased by his two sons.\n\nThomas’ sister Margaret married William Burgh, brother of Thomas Burgh the surveyor-general (Trinity College Library, Steevens’s Hospital, etc. )\n\nHis brother John Parnell (1680-1727) married Mary Whitshed (d 1768) one of 13 children of Thomas Whitshed and Mary (Quin), and by the terms of the marriage settlement John had to invest £1250 in land, which brought about the acquisition of Rathleague and Tonnikele (Tennekill). Mary’s brother Lord Chief Justice Whitshed and John Parnell were both distinguished judges (quite different from a learned judge – even the most ignorant buffoon who gets a seat on the bench is a learned judge!) Despite the Westenra and Fisher occupations, Parnell seems to have bought Rathleague in 1716.\n\nSir John Parnell ,(1717- 1782) his only son , who succeeded him in 1727 at the age of 10. He was created a Baronet in 1766 and married Anne Ward in 1744, daughter of Michael Ward (1683–1759) of Castleward, Co. Down and brother of Bernard Ward who built the present Castleward. It was he who was responsible for beautifying the estate and creating the delights that, were they still there, would make Rathleague one of the most important gardens in Ireland. He also started the herd of Bakewell’s Leicestershire cattle.\n\nThe diary of his first journey in England is now in the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington D.C. The diary of his second set of English travels in 1769-70 is now in the British Library in London. There is also in The London School of Economics , Coll. Misc. 38: The handwritten journal of Sir John Parnell entitled ‘Journal of a tour thro’ England and Wales,’ anno. 1769.\n\nThe books are full of memoranda about farming methods and implements and the way in which he might employ them at home. They also contain dozens of sketches of fences, gates and buildings as well as of garden features he had seen in England or which he planned to execute on his return to Ireland.\n\nParnell particularly liked the root seats that Shenstone had created at The Leasowes in the West Midlands. Made up of natural stone (as an entrance way), branches, roots, and sodded at the top, growing climbers to look like a natural bower but (naturally enough) designed as shelter from the rain.\n\nHorner’s “Mapping Laois” reproduces Byron’s 1789 survey. It shows a pleasure house, a lake with a boat house, a sunken fence (or ha-ha), and a pigeon house. The last two are now underneath the M7. The Silver Hall, originally a marshy field where a treasure is said to be buried beneath a tree, between the house and the lake, was clearly inspired by Shentone’s Virgil’s Grove.\n\nPatrick Bowe, the garden historian, has written on Rathleague. Parnell planted extensive woods and created an artificial lake that was notable for attracting great numbers of wild fowl. Around his house, he laid out gardens, erecting a circular temple in the Doric style as a new focal point for his demesne. (The flat Temple Field with a big pit surrounded by bushes was at the back of Conroy’s Farm). The latter was criticised by Richard Colt Hoare, owner of the famous English landscape garden at Strourhead. He wrote in his Journal of a Tour in Ireland that its architecture was bad, that its columns were too slender and that it had an inappropriate balustrade on top. Rathleague House was destroyed in a fire in the 1840s and was only partially rebuilt. The temple was finally demolished in the middle of the 20th century. Another of Parnell’s projects was at the Rock of Dunamase. Cromwellian soldiers virtually destroyed the medieval castle on top but Parnell set about the conservation of what remained, reconstructing part of the castle using medieval fragments such as cut stone window and door surrounds from the ruins of other nearby medieval structures and creating a banqueting hall – guaranteed to give SPAB and contemporary conservationists a conniption.\n\nArrived at Parkgate (Merseyside), the 15th inst. in the Prince of Wales, from Dublin, to be interred in the family vault in the church of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, in this city, the remains Lady Parnell (who died at Rathleague, the Queen’s county, the 20th inft.) relict of the late Sir John Parnell, and mother of the present Right Hon. Sir John Parnell, Bart. Chancellor the Exchequer in the kingdom of Ireland. Her Ladyship was an affectionate wife, a tender mother, and a sincere friend, whose death is much lamented by a numerous circle of acquaintance Chester Courant – Tuesday 28 April 1795\n\nHis son Sir John (1744- Dec 1801), the second baronet, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Irish Parliament in 1787 – a brave and honourable man who, in a time when nepotism was accounted almost a virtue and a sign of parental solicitude, resolutely refrained from using his public power for the betterment of his family. He opposed the Act of Union, and was dismissed from office and accused of treason by Castlereagh.\n\nHe education started with a year at Harrow in 1758 before going on to two years at Eton (1759–60) He married Laetitia Charlotte Brooke in 1774, and together they had four children.\n\nSir Charles Coote’s General View of the Agriculture and Manufactures of the Queen’s County:, published in 1801, is not madly enthusiastic :- Sir John Parnell occasionally resides at his seat at Rathleague. The timber is very fine here and the land greatly improved but the mansion house is very old and indifferent A rich plantation of exotics cover the banks of an extensive lake\n\nTheir eldest son John Augustus was born crippled and deaf mute. The large walled garden was converted into a safe space for him. John Augustus died in his late 30s in 1812.\n\nIn April 1801, the 2nd son Henry Brooke Parnell was in London when he married Caroline Elizabeth Dawson, Lord Portarlington’s daughter, from Emo. In 1812 he inherited the baronetcy and followed a political career in London, being created Lord Congleton in 1841. He published works on financial and penal questions as well as on civil engineering. In later years he seems to have spent most of his time in London, and his agent William Clarke was living at Rathleague in 1837, according to Lewis. Congleton hung himself with a silk handkerchief from his bedpost in his London house in 1842 at the age of 65, suffering from ill health and depression.\n\nHis son John Parnell, 2nd Lord Congleton, was born in London on June 16th, 1805 and whist at university in Edinburgh in the 1820s embraced rather fundamentalist Christianity, which culminated in the formation of the Plymouth Brethren in Dublin’s Aungier Street.\n\nBack in Laois, on June 19, 1831 Robert Turpin (his mother was Martha Clarke) the sub sheriff for Queen’s County, died at Rathleague. The duties of this position included presiding over evictions and elections, the appointment of gaolers and hangmen, and the executions of capital punishments He was only in his 30s and he left his widow, Marianne Odlum with three children under 5 years old. Very tough.\n\nIn 1834 William Clarke of Rathleague is a juror and on March 12, 1836 the Leinster Express advertises “Whitefooot will stand this Season at _RATHLEAGUE, near MARYBOROUGH, the residence of Wm Clarke mares £1 grooms 2/6 “, followed by regular advertisements for stallions over the next number of years.\n\nFreeman’s Journal on Tuesday 28 April 1846 reported that “On last Wednesday, on the part of the Right Hon. Col. Dawson Damer, William Clarke, of Rathleague, Esq., distributed a large sum of money amongst the gallant colonel’s tenantry, for the purpose of buying seed potatoes. On the other hand a couple of years later, perhaps the worst year of famine, his pursuit of people for pulling grass does seem just a tad unreasonable.\n\nList of 1870 Landowners shows a George Clarke of Rathleague, who was presumably the son and heir born to The Lady of William Clarke, Esq. of Rathleague, near Maryborough, 03 May 1837, although there was also a William Clarke of Rathleague, a coroner in the 1870 and making the headlines in the Dublin Weekly Nation in May 1880 for seizing Mr. Redington’s cattle for the sum of £40, half a year’s tent. Clarke many years ago became owner of the small property of Pallas, on which Mr. Redington was the principal tenant. The more Reddington improved the land, the more Clarke increased the rent. Richard Lalor, the Parnellite MP, denounced Clarke and the land laws. Redington sold up in 1884-\n\nDESIRABLE INVESTMENT. WH. COBBE WILL SELL BY AUCTION, On MONDAY, 3rd MARCH. 1884, By direction of Mr. Thomas Redington, of Pallas (Within one mile of Maryborough), HIS INTEREST in his valuable Farm, containing about 87 Acres of good arable and grass Land, held by Statutory Lease, at the reduced Rent of £55, being well laid out, cultivated, and highly manured (no second corn crop has been taken during 20 years); residence, thatched cottage, with kitchen, parlour, and several bedrooms, well furnished with iron bedsteads, hair mattresses and feather beds.

Present were:\n\nMary Elizabeth Stuart (daughter of George Wilkinson from Cappakeel), aged 42, a Farmer, widow,\n\nHannah Frances, daughter, aged 17,\n\nOlive A.M., daughter, aged 14, (who died in 1902)\n\nGeorgina, daughter, aged 9,\n\nWilliam, son, aged 6,\n\nAnne Wilkinson, mother, aged 71, a widow, (Anne was the daughter of Edward Luttrell, a farmer, and she was living at Cappakeel in 1858) In 1830 Edward, William and Richard Luttrell, and Edward and William jnr, were all resident at Cappakeel and signatories on the anti repeal of the union petition. One of their farms at Cappakeel was sold in 1884\n\nQUEEN’S COUNTY. Sale Lands, Dwelling-house, and Out-offices, BY AUCTION. On TUESDAY, the 4th of MARCH. 1884. Held under Lord Portarlington (the best of landlords). HENRY ODLUM has been instructed Mr. Robert Luttrell who is removing to his new Farm at Emo. to sell his right, title, and interest, in all that part of the LANDS OF CAPPAKEEL. New Inn (now in his possession). Containing 100 (Irish) Acres with excellent turbary. held at the low Rent of £53 13s. 9d. These Lands are of good quality for tillage or pasture, the tillage land being all in a most forward state for cropping. There is workman’s house on the holding. The Dwelling-house is partly slated, and contains six rooms, kitchen, dairy, and scullery, the out-offices are in good order and extensive, with turf shed. At the same time win he sold one Rick of Oat Straw, and one Turnip Pulper.\n\nAlso at Rathleague in the 1901 census were\n\nCharlotte Stuart, sister-in law, aged 71, not married,\n\nAnd Denis Conroy, a 32 year old RC servant.\n\nElizabeth, the 2nd surviving daughter of the late Benjamin Stuart of Emo, died at her brother William’s house at Coolbanagher April 1879. Her older sister Charlotte died in Cincinnati in 1908.\n\nThe Stuarts had married in 1882 at the Cof I church in Coolbanagher. One of the witnesses was Susan E Meredith; her brother James had married Anne Meredith of Ballyduff, near Stradbally. Maria Keegan, who lived at Rathleague in the 1940s was born a Meredith. William Stuart had died in Sept 1900, aged 68.\n\nMrs Stuart carried on farming for a few years but decided to emigrate to the USA via Canada on the ship Megantic in August 1910, together with her daughters Frances and Georgina, son William mother Ann Wilkinson, and sister in law – these last two were 80, and she was over 50. Her next of kin in Ireland was recorded as Mr Onions, Borris House, Maryborough. An amazing adventure. I wonder if they prospered in Ohio?\n\nEd Note – a granddaughter of Mrs Stuart has been in touch, and apparently they built a house on Springwater Avenue, Wenatchee, Washington to which they had moved due to the encouragement of very dear family friends, Dr. Scott and family, who had moved to the Wenatchee area. There Frances married Frances George Ellis from Balbriggan.\n\nIn a letter that one of her cousins sent to her grandmother about the house he writes about its condition in the mid 20th century:- “The cellars are very ancient. they are three in number and run parallel with the drawing room. The discovery was made quite by accident, and would not have happened but for the fact that some of the supports under the floor had crumbled and were being repaired. The carpenters found that where at most there should have been a two or three foot space , it looked dark and there was a hollow sound as if from a vault.\n\nOn getting a flashlight and up some more boards they discovered a passage. Further examination revealed that there were there were three, cellars which contained only a few jars and bottles.\n\nHow and why they came to be there, and why no one knew of their existence is a question. They cover most of the area of the drawing room and were probably used in later days for food and wine storage.\n\nIt would appear that they w are part of a large basement and sere converted into cellars when the house was rebuilt. Tba original was an extensive mansion which was demolished at one time The present house was rebuilt from a part of the right wing.\n\nA grove of trees to a large field was at one time an island It the centre of a lake which has since been drained. Trout ere spawned in a pond at the back of the house, and were taken once a year to the lake.”\n\nBy 1908 John William Gregg, son of the Bishop of Cork and educated at Repton and Cambridge, was running Rathleague as a stud farm. He had married Mary Studdert in November 1893. Her father was Major Charles W Studdert of Aylesbury Road and Cragmoher, Corofin. An odd advertisement in the Pymouth Gazette 16 Oct 1902 led me to reading about the Boer War remount scandal “The furniture and live stock belonging to Major Studdert. Cragmoher House, have been sold by auction by the Sheriff of Clare, under an execution in connexion with the purchase the Yeomanry remounts. They fetched £900. Mrs. Studdert was the purchaser.”\n\nTHE REMOUNT SCANDAL. FURTHER PROSECUTIONS. LONDON, AUG. 7. 1902\n\nMore is likely to be heard of the scandals connected with the purchase of remounts for the Yeomanry, which recently led to charges against Major C. W. Studdert and his two sons at Dublin. Evidence was given showing that Major Studdert bought horses at £8/10/ a piece and sold them to the Government at £30, but the proceedings were abandoned on the defendants paying the Government £2,000, with £1,000 cost. In the House of Commons last evening, however, Mr. St. John Broadrick, the Secretary of State for War, intimated that the persons implicated in the transactions forming the basis of the proceedings against Major Studdert would be prosecuted when the necessary evidence had been collected.\n\nCragmoher was gutted by fire in the 1980s, but has since been restored\n\nIn the 1911 census\n\nGregg John W R 40 Male Head of Family Church of Ireland\n\nGregg Mary 40 Female Wife Church of Ireland\n\nGregg Elenor Mary 16 Female Daughter Church of Ireland\n\nGregg Florence Amy 9 Female Daughter Church of Ireland\n\nGregg John B 9 Male Son Church of Ireland\n\nStuddert Agnes S 43 Female Sister in Law Church of Ireland\n\nCallaghan Mary 43 Female Servant Roman Catholic\n\nO’Neil Mary 23 Female Servant Roman Catholic\n\nBracken John 26 Male Groom Roman Catholic\n\nRankin Joseph 26 Male Groom Roman Catholic\n\nTheir son Private Robert Stoddart Gregg was killed at the age of 20 in 1916, serving with 1st Canadian Mounted Rifles (Saskatchewan Regt.). JW Gregg died on March 8th 1924\n\nThe Greggs were followed by Hamilton’s, Jacksons, and Keegans according to The Leinster Times which on Aug 23 1941 reported:- The Parnell estate included at one time the lands of Cullenagh. These lands were acquired by John Toler, Lord Norbury, the notorious ” harming judge.” The remainder of the estate has in recent years passed to the tenants under the Land Purchase Acts. The demesne lands at Rathleague were acquired some few years ago by the Land Commission for division, which has since been carried out, and the residence was disposed of by sale, Mr. Joseph P. Hannan, Rosleighan Park, being the purchaser.\n\nThat purchaser was presumably the Keegan family – “KEEGAN – June 20, 1944, at her residence, Rathleague House, Maryborough, Maria Keegan (nee Meredith), beloved and loving wife of George Charles Keegan, formerly of Coolbanagher and Kinsale.” Times Pictorial, Saturday, July 1, 1944. Her widow died November 3, 1954, Keegan, George Charles, at the residence of his son-in-law, Robert Levis, Newtown, Naas. George Charles Keegan from Wexford had been a teacher at the National School in Emo when he met Miss Meredith in 1896, the 4th of 16 children of Thomas Meredith who was farming at Emo.\n\nIn 1946 it was advertised for sale and was bought by GH Jackson who bred greyhounds, and Mrs Jackson gave butter making classes. The Jacksons had left, I think for Maida Vale, by 1950.\n\nThe next owner was Mrs A Twiss. In 1957 her son Major Robert Twiss (born 1919) of the Royal Army Service Corps had been sent to observe the nuclear explosions on Christmas Island. He gave the Leinster Express an account of his 105 hour flight home.\n\nIt began on August 21 when, said the Major: ” I lost a complete day in my life when we crossed the International date line.” Fiji was the next stopping place and he had time to view the fuzzy haired natives on the volcanic island and to see the cane and pineapple plantations. Disaster nearly overcame them shortly after take-off and the pilot had to jettison two tons of fuel when an engine stepped. Their second attempt wont smoothly and nine hours later the plane touched down in Brisbane for a night’s stop. Major Twiss described the city as somewhat like a large provincial English town, with- single decker German-type trams in operation. From Brisbane on to Darwin where the countryside changed from green to bush and from 8,000 feet ” looked like a complete desert.” . After a night in Darwin the plane set course North to Singapore over Borneo, and two days later continued to Colombo.\n\nNext stage took them to Bangkok and on over the Bay of Bengal to Calcutta for refuelling. Then began the longest “hop” over North India to Karachi—18 hours—and on. through the Gulf of Oman, where the view was clear as crystal. The plane followed the Tigress to Rabbanya, R.A.F. airfield in Iraq and resumed over the vast arid mountains of Turkey. The journey continued over Ankara, Silonika and Mount Olympus to Corfu Island, crossing the Adriatic to Italy. A comparatively short hop over the Alps—after joining in a fiesta in Brindisi—-brought the world trip to an end.\n\nThe Sunday Independent reported that Mrs Emily Audrey Twiss’s estate was proved at £8,403 in Sept 1970. Nationalist and Leinster Times Friday, August 23, 1974 Mrs A Twiss of Rathleague won the Connemara Pony prize at the Abbeyleix show and again in 1976, the year that 11 year old Sarah Twiss won the 1st Prize for best toy, puppet or whittled article.. Mr & Mrs Richard Twiss sold Rathleague on 30 acres in 1989 for just under £150,000\n\nIt can be hard to work out who lived in which farm at Rathleague. The Conroy family farmed at Rathleague. Leinster Reporter – Saturday 02 February 1907 William McKenna is giving up farming and selling his stock at Rathleague. The longest on the lands may well be the Haslams.\n\n6 March 1879 Henry Haslam born at Rathleague, son of Philip Haslam and Jane Griffin. She was the 17 year old daughter of William Griffin, a labourer, and he the son of Henry Haslam from Rathleague. The Haslams appear in Laois during the reign of Elizbeth I and Thomas Haslam was lay rector at Cremorgan in 1616. Later in the 17th Century there were Haslams in the Mountmellick Quaker records, and they have been at Rathleague for about 200 years. They had a 4 roomed house with three windows across the front, according to the 1901 census.\n\nThe tragic end of Elizabeth Jane Haslam, 29, at Rathleague, Maryborough. was investigated by Dr. Higgins, Coroner for Queen a County, yesterday. The deceased’s father-in-law stated that she had been depressed after coming there on her marriage in November. Her husband left on the 3rd May and wrote stating that he was taking hie passage to New York. The medical evidence showed that death was due to carbolic acid poisoning, and the jury found that the deceased was of unsound mind at the time. May 1905. Such a sad story. Two years older than Henry, they had married at Castleflemming on Wednesday 16 Nov 1904, 6 months earlier. She was from Clonmore, Errill, the daughter of farmers William and Charlotte Moynan. Henry remarried on Monday 5 December 1910 (when did Saturday become popular for weddings?) Sarah Jane Brennan of Fontstown, Athy. 22 May 1920 Jane Haslam of Rathleague widow aged 59 died, her son Henry Haslam of Rathleague present\n\nRathleague Lodge, originally called Tennekill is just north of Sheffield Cross, and opposite the site of Sir John Parnell’s lake. It is still Tennekill on Cahill’s Grand Jury Map of 1805. Tigh na Coille, the house in the wood, seems to be a very uninspired name since most of Laois was apparently solid woodland in the 1600s! Anyone driving along the R425 from Sheffield Cross can’t miss it – the beautiful trees, the stone walled garden and the massive gable chimney stacks wrapping the more delicately drawn house.\n\nIt is described in the Buildings of Ireland as a detached five-bay two-storey house, built c.1810, on an asymmetrical plan incorporating fabric of earlier house, c.1740, with two-storey split-level return to rear. Extended to rear. Stable complex to rear site. Walled garden to site. Double-pitched slate roof with nap rendered chimneystacks. Roughcast walls, re-rendered c.1970, painted, with rendered quoins. Square-headed window openings with limestone sills and replacement six-over-six timber sash windows, c.1900. Tripartite window opening to centre first floor. Round-headed door opening with timber pilaster doorcase and timber panelled door with sidelights and fanlight. Timber panelled internal shutters to window openings (none to Wyatt-style window opening); Entrance/Stair Hall with timber staircase having ramped handrail and square section balusters; open arch to right; plaster cornice to roof to room to front with decorative centrepiece; black marble fireplace to room to left and to Garden floor; black stone fireplace to room to right. Set back from road in own grounds; landscaped grounds to site; wrought iron railings to forecourt. Group of detached single- and two-storey rubble stone outbuildings to site, one dated 1740. Walled garden to site with red brick dressings.\n\nThe earliest reference to it so far found is when it was lived in by Malachy Delaney who was agent to the Parnells and the Stubbers of Moyne. Clearly of man of some importance. From the Leinster Express Saturday, February 25, 1860 “- In Dublin, Patrick Boland, Esq., of _Arran Quay to Mary, only daughter of the late Charles, Hyland Esq., of Queen-street, and grand-daughter of James Delany, of Tennekilly, Esq., Queen’s County”\n\nThe Delaney family deserve at the very least a PhD thesis! The surname Delaney, and its variations, are the Anglicisation of two different surnames, the Gaelic Ó Dubhshláine, and De l’aulnaie of Norman origins. The Norman name means “from the alder grove”, and the Gaelic comes from the words “dubh”, meaning black, and “slán”, meaning defiant, or farewell or from the river Slaney, or just a name – Black Slaney\n\nMalachi’s parents were Martin Delaney and Barbara Albrin of Mountrath. He married Jane daughter of John Sabatier of Mountmellick in about 1720. His brother Daniel married Rachel Sharp, the sister of Anthony Sharp of Roundwood. Their son was Sharp Delaney a Colonel in the American Revolutionary War and the first Collector of Customs in Philadelphia by George Washington. Malachi was also the grandfather of Lt Col Anthony Gale, the 4th commandant of the US Marine Corps!\n\nWhilst researching this Malachi Delaney I kept being led astray by an equally interesting Malachi Delaney, the son of a farmer between Narraghmore and Mullaghmast. He had served with distinction in the Austrian Army and returned to Ireland in time for the 1798, when he was one of the officers commanding the rebels in Naas.\n\nEarly in 1801 he accompanied Robert Emmet travelled throughout Europe raising support for the Republican cause.\n\nSaturday last, Malachy Delany, Esq. surrendered himself in the Court of King’s Bench, to take his trial for having been an officer with the Insurgents, in the county Kildare, during the rebellion. This gentleman had formerly been an officer in foreign service, and it now between fifty and sixty years of age. He was lodged in the New Prison, and is to be transmitted to Naas for trial. Saunders’s News-Letter – Wednesday 16 February 1803 He was acquitted, but then we read that everyone’s least favourite Irishman got involved, Major Sirr (the man who arrested Lord Edward Fitzgerald).\n\nLieut. Brown, of the Barrack Division in consequence of Information given Major Sirr, has apprehended Malachy Delany, Esq. late of the county of Kildare. Mr. Delany was tried and acquitted at the last Spring Assizes of the county of Kildare. Nine prisoners, who appeared to be of some Respectability, were lately brought to Kilmainham, from Naas, in carriages, under strong military escort. Two carriages also arrived at the same time from the North-road, with five prisoners, strongly escorted.—Our private letters state that Mr. Carr, a gentleman of fortune in the county of Westmeath, and Colonel Nesbit, a gentleman of the first respectability in one of the Northern Counties, have been apprehended in their respective dwellings. Chester Chronicle – Friday 14 October 1803\n\nHe appears to have been released. From The Star – Saturday 04 April 1807 “Died at Finglas Malachi Delany formerly an office of distinguished merit in the Austrian Service”\n\nMalachi Delany died in 1784, but his son seems to have continued on at Rathleague for a while before the Purdons moved in. I had wondered if the walled garden at Rathleague Lodge might have been constructed for John Augustus (the deaf mute son of Sir John).\n\nGeneral Sir Charles Coote’s 1801 View of the Agriculture and Manufactures of the Queen’s County gives us a rough date for the remodelling:- Mr Halpen, Sir John Parnell’s agent, has built a handsome house and offices near the road which are very ornamental.\n\nOn Sat 1st April 1809- Mrs. Purdon, Rathleague, Queen’s, wife of Edward Purdon, daughter of John Wrixon, of Welshestown, near Charleville, a lady very sincerely regretted by her honourable family connexions and numerous respectable acquaintance. Her husband was “The Distributor of Stamps” for Queen’s County, (nothing to do with postages and everything to do with Stamp Duty, William Wordsworth was the distributor in Westmorland! The Purndons had only married in March 1804.\n\nThe remnant of the Barrington estate at Cullenagh was sold to Sir John Parnell, soon after Col. Jonah Barrington’s s death in 1764 (Sir Jonah Barrington’s grandfather).\n\nSamuel Jones Bernard Anderson, (his full name comes from the announcement of his death in Kentish Weekly Post, Tuesday 08 January 1805, which also announced that his nephew James Dowling Anderson had died) the Catholic agent of Sir John Parnell, moved into Cullenagh, and fitted up a small chapel in the hamlet of Cullenagh adjoining, for the accommodation of himself and the Catholic tenants. Apart from being Parnell’s agent Anderson also had a Worsted Mill there. May 23, 1778 he was advertising a reward for the apprehension of Thomas Dungan a worker who had run away with a quantity of cloth and thread stolen from his looms.\n\nAnderson took the Oath of Allegiance at Portlaoise on 6 Oct 1775 and was a delegate at the Catholic Convention in Dublin in 1792 Archivium Hibernicum Vol. 67 (2014), pp. 319-340 Gleanings on the personnel of the Catholic Convention, 1792-93 C.J. Woods. He may have been a relation of Bernard Anderson ( 1722 ? – 1803 ) , late of Moate, Ballinakill, Queen ‘ s Co . , who d . in Queen St., Dublin , March 1803.\n\nIn 1774 the Irish parliament passed an act that would allow Catholics (“Papists”) to swear their loyalty to the King. Several clergy took the oath, while others adamantly refused. Between 1774 and 1793 Catholic Relief Acts were passed to reverse some of the Penal Laws. The acts, however, applied only to those who had taken the oath.\n\nBy 1830 Rathleague Lodge was the residence of Major Barrington.\n\nJohn Barrington, abt 1710-1784 had 16 children with his wife Sibella French, including Jonah Barrington who ended up in France and John Barrington who built Castlewood at Durrow. However the Barringtons at Rathleague cannot have been direct relations of the Cullenagh Barringtons.\n\nThe most likely kinship was a James Barrington, Coachmaker, Landowner (Freeholder 14 Apr 1774), b. Raheenlusk, Co. Wexford, abt. 1743; mar. Stradbally, 1 Sep 1768, Letitia Gray, dau of William Gray of Maryborough, and Margaret Pigott of Dysart; (Though if this is correct Letitia was only 16 at the time of her marriage) 8 children born at Stradbally: Richard Barrington, b. abt. 1770, William Barrington, b. abt. 1773, Henry Barrington, b. abt. 1778, John Barrington, b. abt. 1779, 3 further sons, Letitia Barrington, b. abt. 1782;living 1810 [AB, FT, Freeholders in Queen’s County, Gordon Kinship, McBride (1973), LDS, marriage settlement, ML] This branch were descendants of the Roundhead Major Thomas Barrington, John Barrington’s ggg uncle.\n\nMajor Richard Barrington of the 56th was Lt Barrington in 1804. He served in India from 1815 (Bombay Gazette – Wednesday 26 June 1816 Capt. Richard Barrington promoted to Major), and arrived back in Porstmouth in 1826. He died at Rathleague 30 Apr 1837. He had at least two children, a son William and a daughter Kate. On his death his brother John seems to have moved into Rathleague. Richard Barrington, of Lower Ormond-quay, Dublin, Solicitor, married Kate, daughter of the late Major Barrington, of Rathleague Lodge, in the Queen’s County, and formerly of the 56th Regiment in June 1840. Barrington was practicing at 24 Dominick Street in 1825.\n\nMaria Barrington eldest dau of John Barrington, and niece of Major Barrington died at Rathleague Lodge in July 1838. John Barrington himself died at Rathleague Lodge aged 60 “of an attack of the liver” 6 Aug 1842, leaving a large family to deplore his loss. In 1846 the Barringtons apparently sold the remainder of their lease\n\nLeinster Reporter…Saturday, November 28, 1908; John Scott has sold his farm at Rathleague\n\nShortly after this Rathleague Lodge was bought by the Maher family.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nSo it’s the 8th of March – International Women’s Day. Who knew that Portlaoise had connections with Andrea Praed the first Ozzie writer to explore gender and cross-cultural conflicts, the advent of theosophy and the groundswell of feminist opposition to the legal bonds of marriage?!\n\nMy attention was drawn to Newpark House by a couple of submissions on the Council’s Draft Development Plan\n\nWe act on behalf of John Killeen in this matter.\n\nNewpark House and Apartment blocks known as St. Michaels & St. Margarets is an existing apartment development in the centre of Portlaoise. The two-blocks were built in the late 70’s and currently house 10 apartments, a mixture of 1&2 bedroomed apartments. My client is looking to do extensive renovations and alterations to the site to include additional apartment development on the grounds within the vicinity of these two units. Opposite our development at The Maltings site the land within the vincinity of same has been zoned Residential 2, we are seeking a expansion of this zoned area to include the entirity of our site. We make this submission on the grounds that the site is bound on two sides by road frontage and we will be seeking to develop off Harpurs Lane with the new development. Attached find location map of same.\n\nNewpark House is a period style dwelling located in the centre of a privately developed housing scheme known as Newpark, built in the 1970’s. Newpark House was converted to a mixture of flats and bedsits over a period from the early 80’s to the mid 90’s. The dwelling has undergone extensive internal works along with external works which was carried out in a piecemeal fashion without proper consultation. The roof needs urgent attention and was covered down with a canopy covering 20 years ago which has now deteriorated and will now need to be replaced in full. The owner John Killeen is respectful to the history of the dwelling house however, this will need major reconditioning works in the near future and has gone beyond the former original features which the house was built to. We are seeking this to be removed from the records of Protected Structure in order to perserve its current use as a place of residence for 7 individuals and the building needs to be adjusted to meet their needs.\n\nI apologize if I offend, but I do tend to wonder if the owner John Kileen has any notion of the history of the house of which he is so respectful ! One of the earlier houses in Portlaoise, Newark was built by John McLean before 1814 (when he is recorded as being resident there in Leet’s Directory,) and then became the home of Rev Thomas Harpur around 1820.\n\nA large tract of land , known by the, name of the Green, on which great hurling parties formerly assembled. The Green is let out in parks. On a part of it is a very neat house, the residence of the Rev. Thomas Harpur, built by Mr McClean. Leinster Express Saturday, November 05, 1831; Page: 4\n\nThomas was probably the son of Rev Epharim Harpur (d 1810), a Presbyterian, who lived outside Portarlington. The Rev Singleton Harpur, who died following a fall from his horse in Monkstown in 1806, who had been chaplain to the Royal Irish Regiment in 1785, was a relation. George Harpur of James Street Dublin (d 1823) must have been another relative:- “On the 25th March 1826 in Maryborough, by the Rev. Thomas Harpur, Robert Galbraith, Esq., of Mountpelier-hill, to Miss Hannah Harpur, of Stradbally, eldest daughter of the late George Harpur, Esq. of James’s street, Dublin,” From Freemans Journal, October 18, 1823 we know that George Harpur’s executor was Elizabeth Broomfield, the wife of Henry Parnell Broomfield. They were clearly related to the Broomfields who were faming at Ballyfin in the 1820s. These Broomfields, who were regularly recorded as Bloomfield, had 4 children. Humphrey who married Elizabeth McGuiness in 15 Apr 1816 and emigrated to Australia, Basil, of Irey, south of Ballyfin, who signed a “Declaration against Repeal of the Union, 1830”, Joseph, & Henry Parnell Broomfield who married Anne Ince (who d 1855) (probably daughter of Richard Ince, Draper and Ironmonger of Maryborough) on 12 April 1852; lived at Borris Cottage Maryborough.\n\nSt Margarets & St Michaels – the North and South Pavilions – wouldn’t they look so much better if they were pure Palladian!\n\nBridget Harpur of Urney, Portarlington, who married Thomas Pilkington of Toar in 1768 might have been a sister or an aunt. Their son Captain Abraham Pilkington fought at Waterloo.\n\nThomas Harpur of Newpark, Portlaoise had married Hannah Colvill of Clontarf in 1815.\n\nHannah’s father was William Colvill (1737–1820), corn merchant and MP, the second son of William Colvill (1675?–1755), an agent at Newtownards, Co. Down, and his wife Jane, daughter of John Thompson of Blackabbey, Co. Down.\n\nHaving lost a good part of his £5000 inheritance in the slave trade (and serve him right!), Colvill joined a firm of flour merchants, Wyld’s of Molesworth Street, Dublin, and eventually succeeded to ownership of the business. He was a director of the Grand Canal Company at its foundation (1772) and became involved (1790) in the Barrow Navigation Company, in which he invested between £20,000 and £30,000.\n\nHe was also a founding director of the Bank of Ireland (1783). In the 1790s he was a supporter of Catholic relief and an opponent of the union of Ireland with Great Britain. I guess it’s not unreasonable to assume that it was his money that paid for the construction of Newpark.\n\nIn 1845 one of their daughters, Hannah Harpur, died at Newpark. 1851 in her 65th year Thomas’s sister in law Margaritta Colvill died at Newpark. The Harpurs were still there in 1861 when “a son was born to the lady of J Harpur Esq”, a brother to Thomas Singleton Harpur, born 1851, who emigrated to Australia in 1877.\n\nTo divert – or maybe not!\n\nMatilda Harpur born 1828, was one of five children of Thomas Harpur and Rosa Adams of Tullyhogue, Cookstown, who had married on January 24 1823 . Rosa died in 1835 and Thomas moved to Dublin where he married Mary Jane Speer, the daughter of a solicitor. In 1840 the all sailed for Australia on the Lord Western. In 1846 Matilda married Thomas Lodge Murray Prior (originally of Rathdowney). Their daughter Rosa Praed (1851-1935) achieved international literary fame as the first Australian author to explore gender and cross-cultural conflicts, the advent of theosophy and the groundswell of feminist opposition to the legal bonds of marriage.\n\nFrom the genealogy of the Greer family of The Grange, Co Tyrone, we have Mary the daughter of Thomas Harpur of Moy and his wife Sarah Clements of Brackaville marrying John Greer on 5 June 1816.\n\nThomas Harpur of Moy showed of his invention – a machine for working eight pumps – to the RDS in May 1811.\n\nThen leaping forward to 1853 there is an advertisement n the Australian papers :_ INFORMATION WANTED. A gentleman just arrived from Quebec, Canada, wishes to be informed of the address of either MR WILLIAM HARPUR or MR CHARLES HARPUR of Moy, county Tyrone, Ireland. He was requested to insert this advertisement by TOBY CAULFEILD, a particular friend of his and would therefore be most happy to communicate with either of the above gentleman. Please address to Mr. J.S. Waterson at O’Dowd and Klinefalter’s, Market Square west, opposite Montefiore & Co., William Street [Melbourne] 1853\n\nAll of which might suggest that these Hapurs had little to do with Hapur’s Lane in Portlaoise.\n\nAnd yet in the National Library of Australia there is “Information and correspondence, relating to Hybla, Monasterevin, Co. Kildare, associated with Thomas Harpur’s family (Thomas Harpur was Praed’s grandfather) (File 51) – Box 42 (MS 8363)” And Andrea Praed thought that Thomas Harpur of Newpark was her gg grandfather.\n\nFor further confusion there was a Thomas Harpur who printed the famous 18th Century Volunteer fabric at his mills in Leixlip.\n\nAnd from Saunders’s News-Letter – Monday 28 October 1799 we learn that Basil. HARPUR, late of No. 1 Dame-lane, has removed No. 5, Dame-lane, corner of Trinity-Place for the convenience of carrying on his business more extensively. He respectfully acquaints his Friends and the Public, that he has opened his house by the name of The QUEEN’S COUNTY TAVERN and CHOP HOUSE, in the most extensive manner,\n\nMoving on towards the 20th century\n\nRichard Edward and Jane Eleanor Odlum (nee Hinds) were living at Green Mills when their first son William Perry was born in 1878, and still there in 1882, but were at Newpark, when their son Arthur Wellesley was born on the 2th Sept 1884 . They had been married in the parish church in Castletown in November 1875. Her father, who lived in Church Street till his death in 1903 at 88, had had a shop on the South side of the Main Street, Portlaoise from at least 1837 – a grocer, earthenware dealer, and seedsman.\n\nRichard Odlum left school at the age of 14. He was the financial and business manager of Odlums, speculating on wheat futures making a lot of money in the process. He had a good brain for decision making but he was an autocratic and two of his sons, Arthur and Harold, rebelled and fled to Canada. In In 1897 the Odlums added a new kitchen and scullery onto the back of Newpark. Jane died in 1919 and Richard Odlum died on 24 Feb 1924\n\nIn 1909 the Odlums’ daughter Jane Evelyn had married Rev Robert Robinson Tilson. (b 1871) of the Grand Lodge of Freemasons of Ireland.\n\nIn 1926 Mabel Gee of Newpark was applying to be a Dispensary Nurse, so the Odlums were probably letting Newpark.\n\nThe Rev Tilson, Rector of Maryborough, died in 1920, leaving his widow Evelyn with four young children. They lived at Tower Hill, Portlaoise – their son married Deena Jessop, (whose sister had married Edgar McKeever of Moor Hall Ardee in 1933) their daughter Sylvia married Buce Williamson of Belfast, Eleanor graduated from Trinity in 1938. When the grieving widow married Peter Louis Sharp in the 1940s (who died in 1951) they moved back to Newpark. She and her family were still there in the 1950s – in 1951 she was looking for an experienced cook who could use an Aga; by 1956 she just needed a general cook! She died in 1960. Is that when Newpark’s downward spiral started?\n\nWouldn’t it be great see Newpark sympathetically restored and the magical walled garden once again a place of beauty. Does anyone else think that it could become swish offices and the garden be vested in the local community?\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nDriving from Dublin to Laois in the 1980s – Friday evening torture. Cutting through the car park and past St David’s Castle in Naas. I never discovered a back double through Monasterevan. But the worst traffic was at Portlaoise. So I avoided it by taking a left turn just before the Rock Inn and following the old coach road; that tranquil road down to Sheffield Cross and Ballyroan, was a sweet balm. There was a ruined house on the left as you left Ballyroan, but though I must have passed it 100 times a year back then, I never stopped to look at it. Driving past recently for the first time in many years I saw an anaerobic digester and a new house on the site. I am pretty sure that the original was a two storey, 5 bay house. Was there a breakfront with a central pediment? Or was that at Dunkerrin? I can’t remember. The moral is photograph, photograph, photograph.\n\nArthur Young’s 177s report can never be forgotten. “Slept at Ballyroan, at an inn kept by three animals who call themselves women; met with more impertinence than at any other in Ireland. It is an execrable hole.” Even Barrington was not enamoured: – “A Mrs Moll Harding kept the “natest” inn in Ballyroan close to my father’s house. I recollect to have heard a passenger (they are very scarce there) telling her that his sheets had not been aired. With great civility Moll Harding begged his honour’s pardon and said they certainly were and must have been well aired for there was not a gentleman came to the house the last fortnight that had not slept in them.” Laois Inns did not do too well in Tripadvisor precursors. In 1806 Colt Hoare wrote in his Tour of Ireland “The Emo Inn is a single house. A good inn and well supplied with post horses though I think I may apply to it what was once said to a Cistercian monk Albior exterius quàm interius – the outside is whiter than the inside; “ in other words, it was a filthy godforsaken dive!\n\nThe gables of the 17th Century Preston School still stand to the west of the main street.\n\nThe Prestons and the Nangles intermarried on a regular basis – the Preston family managed to hold on to their estate lands through the centuries despite being staunch Catholics. The head of the family is the Viscount Gormanston, the first Viscountcy created in Ireland. The Nangles, Barons Navan, were also a Norman family. John Preston, great nephew of the 4th Viscount Gormanston (1537-1599), married Mary Nangle, daughter of Jocelyn Nangle of Kildalkey who had been outlawed after the 1641 rising – he was a great great nephew of the 4th Viscount Gormanston. It was always suggested that when she married Preston she brought with her the lands of Tara and Ardsallagh in Meath, and Emo in Laois. In Chris Booth’s blog https://chrisb2701.wordpress.com/ &nbsp; he shows that in fact the owner of Emo Park in 1641 was Thomas FitzGerald (Catholic), and by 1670 ownership had transferred to Alderman John Preston (Protestant). As to the lands in Meath, Mary’s father may have got some of the lands back on the Restoration, as a loyal monarchist. But there were several Nangle siblings, so she probably would not inherited much, and her brother Walter inherited the Kildalkey estate.\n\nJohn Preston’s fortune came from purchasing property from the English soldiers and adventurers who had no interest in settling in Ireland. Preston was Mayor of Dublin in 1653-54 and was elected as Member of Parliament for Navan in the restoration parliament of 1661. When Charles II was restored to the throne, John Preston was confirmed in his occupation of 7,859 acres of land in Meath and Queens County under the Acts of Settlement In 1666. He set up the Preston Schools in 1686, the year of his death, so the suggestion that “as his defective land titles might be questioned in time, he set aside 1000 acres of his gains from the Nangle estates to endow two Protestant schools, judging that any government would be reluctant to question the title to land used for such a worthy purpose.” is probably not correct. (navanhistory.ie/ and bellinterhouse.com).\n\nHis granddaughter Anne married a Dublin banker (Oh, the shame!) by the name of Ephiram Dawson from whom the Earls of Portarlington are descended. Their son incidentally married the daughter of another banker, Joseph Damer, decribed by Walpole as a miser and a usurer!\n\nIn the 1836 Selection of Reports and Papers of the House of Commons: Education ; 3, Volume 3, published The Preston School is described as being in a large slated house that cost £500. The modern school-house was a presentable and comfortable two-storied house, having many rooms above and below, while its extension towards the rear was considerable. The building was then centrally placed in the town of Ballyroan (O’Hanlon). The master, Arthur Hutchins, was paid £122 15s. John Duffy and Charles Duffy who ran rival schools in Ballyroan received £10 pa and £16 pa respectively. Canon O’Hanlon was sent to the Preston School at the age of 13, in 1834 and describes Hutchins- Mr. Hutchins was rather a tall man, of lithesome shape, and having a good set of features, in which seriousness and vivacity were at once blended. His motions were restless, both within and without the house, and when walking abroad his thumbs were placed in the armlets of his vest, while the tips of his fingers were continually tatooing his breast on either side. In dress he was a stylish gentleman of the olden time, wearing a long-skirted black broad-cloth frock-coat with lappels, a waistcoat and pantaloons to match, a black silk stock, with shirt collars protruding on either side of his cheeks. His shapely silk hat was worn with a jaunty air, and his boots were highly polished ; but probably the most noticeable appendage of his dress was a cambric frill, snowy white, and elegantly crimped, which escaped in full display from the upper part of the vest. An earlier pupil had been Jonah Barrington. Of Charles Duffey’s school O’Hanlon wrote that Duffey put great importance on good manners and his students learnt to bow and curtsey to all the ladies and gentlemen travelling through on the mail coach, to the passengers’ delight.\n\nCarrying on past the very fine, though much overgrown, Norman motte on the right and up the hill, past the silhouette crib which incorporates the site of a medieval castle according to the OS map, and to the left is Rockbrook.\n\nThe earliest reference to Rockbrook is in the Freeman’s Journal of 1765, followed by Taylor and Skinners 1770 Road Book when it is shown as the seat of Mr Gray. However Finns Leinster Journal on Saturday, July 31, 1773; lists Thomas Morton of Ballyroan subscriber. In, of all places, the Pymouth archives office, there is a marriage settlement of 1 January 1791 between John Morton of Dublin, surgeon, and Rebecca Ingram of Limerick, which includes Rockbrook alias Rockfarm , Newtown and Ballyroan , barony of Cullinagh, Queen’s county, and other land of John Morton in Queens County.\n\nIn 1776 William Gray of Ballyroan was one of those seeking the office of County Coroner. Was William Wilson’s 1786 The Post-chaise Companion mistaken to list:-“At Ballyroan , on the L. is Rockbrook , the seat of Mr. Gray.”? Or should it have been Morton?\n\nBarrington also wrote of the Mortons at Rockbrook:- Mrs Mary Morton, a very worthy domestic woman, told me many years since that she had but one way of ruling her husband which as it is rather a novel way and may be of some use to my fair readers I will mention in her own words. “ You know,” said Mrs Morton, “ that Tom is most horribly nice in his eating and fancies that both abundant and good food is essential to his health. Now when he has been out of temper with me he is sure of having a very bad dinner. If he grumbles I tell him that whenever he puts me into a twitter by his tantrums I always forget to give the cook proper directions. This is sure,” added she, “of keeping him in good humour for a week at least.” Personal Sketches of His Own Times, Volume 3 pg 368\n\nBy 1820 according to the Post Chaise Companion it was once again the seat of Mr Gray and Mrs Morton was then at Knapton (which is where Barrington had been born).\n\nIn fact in December 1808, it was reported that William Gray, Esq of Rockbrook. Queen’s County, was married to Miss Julia Sophia Portington, of York Street, Dublin and in 1810 William Gray of Rockbrook got a Game Licence. They had several children and Gray served as a magistrate. However the Rockites made life a little tricky for him and there is a letter of 1829 in the Chief Secretary’s archives about an outrage committed on 2 sheriff’s officers ‘who had been placed in charge of the Premises of William Wall Gray at Ballyroan’. The next letter in the archive shows the church VERY militant in the form of Rev Pierce Goold, Finnoe Glebe House, Borrisokane requesting firearms to protect his family, explaining ‘as from very contracted means with a very large Family to support I cannot afford even for the sake of my Females to remove them into any of the neighbouring Towns for Protection. I therefore have determined to make the best Defence I am able with my three Sons very young lads’. Thankfully the Lord lieutenant was opposed to vigilantes and decided that “he cannot consent to the distribution of arms to individuals”.\n\nIn 1833 the newly graduated Corkonian Dr Henry Croly, fourth son of John Croly of South Cregg, Fermoy and Margaret Johnson, and serving as a Dispensary Doctor in Roscrea married the Gray’s eldest daughter, Isabel. Soon after William Gray and some of his family headed for Canada.\n\nWarner W. Gray, Esq., of the Irish Light Infantry, third son Wm. Wall Gray, late Rockbrook House, Queen’s County was married to Meliora the daughter the late Mr William Thompson of Roscommon in December 1838, by which time his father and at least one of his brothers was in Ontario. William Wall’s death at Lac Amiens, Upper Canada, after a long illness was reported in the Dublin Monitor – Thursday 30 July 1840.\n\nA grandson William Wall Warner Gray married Louisa Madeline Atkinson in Canada around 1861. They were the parents of at least 3 sons and 4 daughters. He died on 3 February 1901, in London, Middlesex, Ontario, Canada, at the age of 90. He stars in a Freemasonry Report of the London District, Ontario. May 26th 1875 “ I had the painful duty to perform in St John’s Chapter No 3 to suspend Comp William Wall Gray during pleasure of Grand Chapter for being drunk and for unmasonic conduct I therefore recommend that Grand Chapter will confirm the same.”\n\nOne of the earlier Grays of Laois, and maybe the almus pater, was Edward Gray of Portlaoise, noted in the Dublin Journal of Monday, January 05, 1733 as Treasurer to the Trustees of the Turnpike. The family also had a distillery in Portlaoise – which pretty much destroyed the town in 1782!\n\nMr L Flood briefly took Rockbrook, and was recorded as being there in 1837 by Lewis’s Topogaphy. This was probably Luke Flood, the youngest son of Luke Flood of Rondwood, who had married Olivia Warren in Abbeyleix in September 1827 (prompting Lord Norbury’s remark about rabbits resulting from a flood getting into a warren!) Finns Leinster Journal Sep 15, 1827; Page: 3. It was maybe the same Luke Flood who was living at Woodville, Portlaoise in 1818, when he got a game licence, and at Moneyclear, near Balinakill in 1834.\n\nAt some point James Doxey lived here (his brother Thomas lived at Clonbrin, just West of Ballyroan). They were the gg grand children of Hercules Doxey (d circa 1684 at Killone, near The Heath) who arrived probably as a Cromwelian soldier. In 1703, although he had married the daughter of a Pole from Ballyfin, Alexander Cosby of Stradbally was so broke that he decided to let Stradbally to Major Lyons and join the army. He borrowed £300 from William Doxey of Raheennahown, between Clopook and Luggacurren to buy a Captain’s comission. It is very hard to work out exactly when James Doxey could have lived at Rockbroock. He left for Quebec with most of his family in 1818, which is when apparently William Gray was there with his young family.\n\nOn 22 Nov 1723 John Doxey acquired a lease to 170 acres of land in the Barony of Cullenagh from Samuel Freeman of Dublin , to hold for a term of 86 years .\n\nWilliam Doxey, husband of Elizabeth McDaniel, assigned the interest in his property in Ballyroan on June 16 1759 to his two sons Samuel & Hercules Doxey . Samuel married Isabella Copperthwaite in 1765, and was at that stage living in Clonbrin.\n\nDeborah Greenham, prob. b. abt. 1745; mar. 1768 Hercules Doxey, brother of Samuel of Mountrath she was bur. 26 Nov 1831, Abbeyleix Parish.

It did not flourish and at some time must have closed down. A last gasp by Mr Stoker to reinvigorate it in 1891 was followed by its sale in 1894 to the McMahaon family, who still have it. The School moved to Abbeyleix and is still remembered in the name of Preston House, it’s home till 1966.\n\nBefore leaving Ballyroan, let’s not forget its most famous academic. Rev Daniel Barrett, rector (or possibly curate) of Ballyroan died in 1759/60. His widow Rossamund Gofton went to Dublin with their 7 year old son, John, better known as Jacky. At 17 he entered Trinity, and remained there for over 50 years, becoming Professor of Greek and Professor of Hebrew and Vice-Provost,\n\n“By a strange irony, Jacky Barrett lives on in people’s memories not nearly so much as a scholar and divine, but as a dwarf whose appetite for food was as great as his hunger for literature, and whose love of money was in a proportionate degree.” Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society, 1900.

The result was The Irish Tourist: In a Series of Picturesque Views, published in 1815. He was thought to be Anthony Atkinson of Cangort, who was known as Anthony the traveller.
