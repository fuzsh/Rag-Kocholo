Born in Lancaster, PA she was the daughter of the late Enos and Annamary (Young) Bleacher. She attended McCaskey High School.\n\nOur mom never did things halfway. Always hardworking, she gave every endeavor her full passion and effort. She was always ready to lend a helping hand to a neighbor even when she could have used a hand herself. She was dedicated to giving her three children a great start in life as well as many children in Lancaster County through her early professional days as a Head Start teacher and then after earning her degree with honors from Millersville University, a teacher with Solanco School District. She was passionate about environmental protection and was an avid gardener; she was an entrepreneur; owning a greenhouse business for many years that she operated from her home. She loved living near the river, being on the water and listening to the train horns at all hours of the day and night. Mom was always reading and enjoyed walks with her beloved four-legged companions. She was a knitter, a seamstress and she found great joy in handcrafted items made by others.\n\nShe is survived by her three loving children, Terra Adams and husband Jim Rothenberg of York, ME; Jake Adams and wife Cassie of Phoenix, AZ; Jeremy Adams and wife Jen of Phoenixville, PA; her adoring grandchildren, Oliver, Brody, Jack, Juliet and Willa; her former husband John Adams of Drumore, PA; her three siblings Richard married to Alice Bleacher of Albrightsville, PA, Barbara married to Robert Heisey of Gilroy, CA, Joan Bleacher married to Stan Jozwiak of Boulder, CO; as well as many cousins, nieces and nephews. She is preceded in death by her sweet grandson, Henry John Adams.\n\nKaren was a loving person who touched the hearts of many with her warm friendly smile and kind gestures. She will be greatly missed.\n\nIn lieu of flowers memorial contributions may be made to The Sierra Club, www.SierraClub.org, 225 Market Street, Harrisburg, PA 17101.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held at 11AM, on Wednesday, April 21, 2021 at the Charles F. Snyder Funeral Home and Crematory, 414 E. King Street, Lancaster, PA 17602. Family and friends will be received from 10AM to 11AM. Interment will be private.\n\nLeave a condolence on this Memorial Page\n\nCondolences to the Family\n\nI will miss her dearly ,and our many phone calls Rest in Peace Cousin\n\nDeborah Cameron\n\nIt is with sadness that I offer my sympathy to the family of a lady I came to know as Ms. Karen. We became acquainted several years ago when she responded to my notice in the local paper seeking odd jobs. The list of things to be done around her home grew to the point that I became her regular handyman. In the past two weeks, I was unable to make contact with her by telephone and decided to drive up and visit. When I arrived, this past Saturday, I realized something had happened and began searching online only to discover her obituary. Ms. Karen and I enjoyed an understanding work relationship and I will miss our conversations. Rest in peace my friend, your labors are ended.\n\nJames Turnbaugh\n\n717-844-0576\n\nIt was with great sadness that I read of Karen’s passing. She was a kind and caring friend and colleague of mine during my years at Solanco. One of my best and favorite memories of my teaching career was when Karen asked me to help chaperone the middle school gifted group on a field trip to Baltimore’s Inner Harbor. It was an amazing day, all organized by her. She and I would work on schedules that would “share” the best students, and she was so great to work with. She always asked about and supported my wife and I through all our struggles with our adopted children, always a sympathetic ear when I needed one. The world is a better place for her being here, blessings to her family at this difficult time.\n\nGlenn Dotterer\n\nMy Condolences to Karen and Joan’s Family. My Brother Don Styer and Karen were in the same class in school and I recently found out they were King and Queen at their 9th Grade Dance at Reynolds Junior High. Karen sounds like she was an amazing woman and I know she will be sorely missed by all those who loved her.\n\nKathy Styer\n\nOne day Karen knocked on my door because she liked the color of our houseand we became fast friends. I will always treasure our chats and my heart breaks to know we will never have another. Thank you Karen, thank you for being you, I will miss you dearly.\n\nErin Poole\n\nSo sorry to hear about Karen’s passing….her picture reminds me exactly as I remember her….smiling! Remember her bubbly countenance and caring attitude towards her students. Met her at Clermont years ago as support staff… Will think of her as I also overlook the river and hear the trains going by…Sincere condolences to her children, family, and friends.\n\nVicki Netting\n\nDear Terra, Jake and Jeremy, so sorry to learn of Karen’s passing.
