        "text": "Trinidadian-born rapper and singer (born 1982)\n\nOnika Tanya Maraj-Petty (born December 8, 1982), known professionally as Nicki Minaj ( NIK-ee min-AHZH), is a Trinidadian-born[a] rapper and singer based in the United States. Often referred to as the \"Queen of Rap\", she is known for her musical versatility, animated rap flow, and alter egos. She first gained recognition after releasing three mixtapes between 2007 and 2009.\n\nMinaj's debut album, Pink Friday (2010), topped the US Billboard 200 chart. Its single \"Super Bass\" reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Her follow-up album, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded (2012), explored dance-pop, debuted at number one in both the UK and US, and yielded the international top-ten single \"Starships\". Minaj's collaboration \"Bang Bang\" (2014) with Ariana Grande and Jessie J became the first female collaboration to be certified diamond. Her third album, The Pinkprint (2014), marked a return to her hip hop roots. Its second single, \"Anaconda\", peaked at number two on the Hot 100. She achieved her first two US number-one singles in 2020 with the collaborations \"Say So\" with Doja Cat and \"Trollz\" with 6ix9ine. In 2022, she earned her first solo number-one on the Hot 100 with \"Super Freaky Girl\", the lead single from her fifth album, Pink Friday 2 (2023), which also debuted atop the Billboard 200. To promote the album, Minaj embarked on the Pink Friday 2 World Tour in 2024, which became the highest-grossing concert tour by a female rapper.\n\nOutside of music, her other ventures have included voice roles in the animated films Ice Age: Continental Drift (2012) and The Angry Birds Movie 2 (2019), and supporting roles in the films The Other Woman (2014) and Barbershop: The Next Cut (2016). On television, she served as a judge on the twelfth season of American Idol (2013).\n\nMinaj is one of the world's best-selling music artists, with over 100 million records sold.[7] Billboard ranked her as the top-selling female rapper of the 2010s and one of the greatest rappers of all time.[8][9] She has the most number-one albums (3) and top-ten songs (23) in the US for a female rapper. Her various accolades include nine American Music Awards, eight MTV Video Music Awards (including the 2022 Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award), twelve BET Awards, five Billboard Music Awards, a Brit Award, and three Guinness World Records; she has received 12 Grammy Awards nominations. In 2016, Time included her on their annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Throughout her career, Minaj's outspoken views, feuds with several rappers, her personal life, and her fanbase have received significant controversy.[10][11]\n\nEarly life\n\nOnika Tanya Maraj was born on December 8, 1982,[12][13] in the Saint James district of Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago.[14][15] Her father was Robert Maraj (1956–2021),[16] a financial executive and part-time gospel singer of Dougla (Afro-Trinidadian mother and Indo-Trinidadian father) descent.[13] Her mother, Carol, is also a gospel singer with Afro-Trinidadian ancestry.[17] Carol worked in payroll and accounting departments during Minaj's youth.[18][19] Minaj's father was addicted to alcohol and crack cocaine[20] and had a violent temper, burning down their house in December 1987.[21] She has an older brother named Jelani,[22] a younger brother named Micaiah,[23] and a younger sister named Ming.[24]\n\nAs a child, Minaj and Jelani grew up with their grandmother in Saint James in a household with 11 cousins.[21] Carol was working numerous jobs in Saint James before getting her green card at the age of 24. She then moved to the Bronx in New York to attend Monroe College, leaving both Minaj and Jelani in Trinidad with their grandmother. Eventually, when Minaj was five, Carol got her first house, on 147th Street in South Jamaica, Queens and brought both Minaj and Jelani to live with her and their father.[21] Minaj claimed she came to the United States as an illegal immigrant, although by the time she moved to the United States her mother and subsequently her father had lawful permanent residency.[6] Minaj recalled, \"I don't think I had a lot of discipline in my household. My mom motivated me, but it wasn't a strict household. I kind of wanted a strict household.\"[25] Minaj successfully auditioned for admission to Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, which focuses on visual and performing arts.[14] After graduation, Minaj wanted to become an actress, and she was cast in the Off-Broadway play In Case You Forget in 2001.[26]\n\nAt the age of 19, as she struggled with her acting career, she worked as a waitress at a Red Lobster in the Bronx, but was fired for discourtesy to customers.[27] She said she was fired from \"at least 15 jobs\" for similar reasons.[28] Other jobs included customer service representative and office management on Wall Street. Minaj recalls buying a BMW as a 19-year-old with the money from waitressing.[29]\n\nCareer\n\n2004–2009: Career beginnings and mixtapes\n\nMinaj briefly signed with Brooklyn group Full Force, in which she rapped in a quartet called the Hoodstars composed of Lou$tar (son of \"Bowlegged Lou\"), Safaree Samuels (Scaff Beezy) and 7even Up.[30][31] In 2004, the group recorded the entrance song for WWE Diva Victoria, \"Don't Mess With\", which was featured on the compilation album ThemeAddict: WWE The Music, Vol.6. Minaj later left Full Force and uploaded songs on her Myspace profile, sending several of her songs to people in the music industry. Later, Fendi, CEO of Brooklyn label Dirty Money Entertainment, signed Minaj to his label in 2007 under a 180-day contract.[32] Originally adopting the stage name Nicki Maraj, she eventually changed it to Nicki Minaj stating that \"my real name is Maraj. Fendi flipped it when he met me because I had such a nasty flow!\"[33]\n\nMinaj released her first mixtape, Playtime Is Over, on July 5, 2007,[34] and her second, Sucka Free, on April 12, 2008.[35] She released her third mixtape, Beam Me Up Scotty, on April 18, 2009;[36] it received favorable coverage on BET and MTV.[37][38] At the time, she was managed by Debra Antney. One of its tracks, \"I Get Crazy\", reached number 20 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart and number 37 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[39] After Minaj was discovered by fellow rapper Lil Wayne,[40] she signed a recording contract with his Young Money Entertainment.[41] That November, she appeared with Gucci Mane and Trina on the remix of \"5 Star Bitch\" by Yo Gotti.[42]\n\nIn early February 2010, Minaj made her first two appearances on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart with her features on \"Knockout\" and \"Up Out My Face\" by Lil Wayne and Mariah Carey respectively.[43][44] Minaj also appeared on \"BedRock\" and \"Roger That\" on the compilation album, We Are Young Money (2009).[45][46] The singles peaked at numbers two and 56, respectively, in the U.S. Their parent album reached number nine on the U.S. Billboard 200, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[47][48] At Jay-Z's suggestion, Robin Thicke featured Minaj on his single \"Shakin' It 4 Daddy\".[49] Allison Stewart of The Washington Post stated that, during that time, she \"became the go-to girl for artists who wanted to add some skank to their tracks without sullying themselves in the process\".[50] Minaj became the first female solo artist to have seven singles simultaneously charting in the U.S.[51]\n\n2010–2011: Breakthrough with Pink Friday\n\nFurther information: Pink Friday\n\nOn March 29, 2010, Minaj released \"Massive Attack\" featuring Sean Garrett.[52] Intended as the lead single from her forthcoming debut album, Pink Friday, the song was dropped from the album due to poor commercial performance.[53][54] The next single, \"Your Love\", later became the album's lead single.[55] Released in June, it peaked at number 14 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Rap Songs chart.[39] The rapper was then featured on Christina Aguilera's song \"Woohoo\", which reached number 46 on the Canadian Hot 100 and number 79 on Billboard Hot 100.[56][57][58] In September, Minaj released \"Check It Out\" with will.i.am and \"Right Thru Me\" as follow-up singles.[59][60][61]\n\nIn October, Minaj was featured on Kanye West's \"Monster\", a posse cut with Jay-Z and Rick Ross featuring vocals from Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. Her verse received widespread acclaim with many critics regarding it as the best verse on that song. Complex rated Minaj's \"Monster\" verse as the number-one best rap verse in the past five years,[62] while Sean Fennessey of The Village Voice stated that \"Monster\" was \"the track that announced Minaj's \"brilliance\" to most people.\"[63] Shortly after, she performed \"Monster\" with West and Jay-Z at Yankee Stadium, becoming the first ever female rapper to perform there. In November 2010, Minaj received her first Grammy Award nomination for her guest verse on Ludacris' song \"My Chick Bad\".[64]\n\nPink Friday was released on November 19, 2010, debuting at number two and later reaching number one on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 375,000 copies.[65][66] It had the largest sales week for a female rap album in the 21st century and second-highest sales week overall after Lauryn Hill's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998). Upon release, the album received generally positive reviews from critics.[67] It was certified platinum in December, with it becoming the first album by a solo female rapper to go platinum in seven years.[68][69] \"Moment 4 Life\" featuring Drake was released as the fourth single from Pink Friday,[70] on December 7, 2010. Minaj performed \"Right Thru Me\" and \"Moment 4 Life\" as the musical guest on the January 29, 2011, episode of Saturday Night Live.[71]\n\n\"Super Bass\", the album's fifth single, was released in April 2011.[72] It became a sleeper hit and commercially successful, ultimately peaking at number three on the Hot 100.[39] It was eventually certified 12-times platinum in the U.S.[73] Super Bass was the highest-charting solo single by a female rapper since Missy Elliott's \"Work It\" in 2002. The music video has over 1 billion views on YouTube as of April 2024.[74][75][non-primary source needed] Early in her career, Minaj identified as bisexual and made several references to it in her music. However, she eventually stated in a 2010 Rolling Stone interview, \"I think girls are sexy, but I'm not going to lie and say that I date girls.\"[76] She once again addressed her sexuality in 2020 on Doja Cat's \"Say So\" remix. The lyrics divided members of the LGBT community, with some accusing her of \"bisexual erasure\" while others voicing there is nothing wrong with originally identifying as bisexual, and then later identifying as straight.[77][78]\n\nMinaj was one of the opening acts on Britney Spears' 2011 Femme Fatale Tour.[79] She and Kesha appeared on the remix of Spears' \"Till the World Ends\", which peaked at number three in the U.S.[80] On August 7, 2011, Minaj experienced a wardrobe malfunction during a live performance on Good Morning America when she revealed her left nipple. Both ABC and Minaj apologized for the incident, with Minaj denying it was a publicity stunt.[81][82] Minaj continued to perform at high-profile events throughout 2011 with Donatella Versace inviting her to perform with Prince for the introduction of a Versace collection for H&M.

The alter egos are incorporated with her lyrics in British accents (Roman Zolanski) or soft-spokenness (Harajuku Barbie). Ice-T said about Minaj's rapping style, \"[Minaj] does her thing. She has her own way of doing it. She has an ill vocal delivery. She kind of reminds me of a female Busta Rhymes, like how she throws her voice in different directions.\"[316]\n\nJon Caramanica of The New York Times called Minaj \"a sparkling rapper with a gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she's a rapid evolver, discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones.\"[315] Although many critics describe her technique as bubblegum rap, Minaj said: \"What people don't know is that before I was doing that craziness I was doing me, I was just doing regular sounding rap that anyone could hear and identify with. But once I started doing all that weird shit—I'm not mad at it because it got everyone's attention.\"[317] Robby Seabrook III of XXL included Minaj in list of \"most unique flows from rappers over the last five years\", saying that she \"has solidified her spot as a leader of the pack for her animated flows, inspiring many other women in hip-hop to play with their vocals. She goes from campy to bellicose, excited to eccentric, oftentimes all on one song.\"[318]\n\nNoted as a rap artist, she also occasionally lends herself to electronic music genres (especially electropop).[319] Pink Friday marked her exploration of the genres, spawning electro songs including the pop-laden \"Super Bass\".[320][321] Also combining rap with synthesizer music, Minaj's second album, Pink Friday Roman Reloaded, had a number of electro-hop and electro pop songs: \"HOV Lane\", \"Whip It\", \"Automatic\", \"Come on a Cone\", \"Young Forever\", \"Fire Burns\",[322] \"Roman Holiday\",[323] \"The Boys\" and \"Beez in the Trap\";[324] while \"Starships\" is a Eurodance song.[325]\n\nHer verse on Kanye West's \"Monster\" was critically acclaimed and contributed greatly to her popularity; many critics said she had the best verse in the song.[326][327] West claimed at one point he considered deleting her verse from the track, because he was worried it would outshine his own work:\n\nIt was like that moment when I thought about taking Nicki's verse off of 'Monster' because I knew people would say that was the best verse on the best Hip Hop album of all time or arguably top ten albums of all time. And I would do all that work, eight months of work on Dark Fantasy and people to this day would say to me 'My favorite thing was Nicki Minaj's verse'. So if I let my ego get the best of me instead of letting that girl get the shot to get that platform to be all she could be, I would take it off or marginalize her, try to stop her from having that shining moment…[328]\n\nTara Colley of The Conversation described Minaj as a \"pre-eminent female rapper\" and that she has \"consistently straddled the distinct personas of gangsta boss and sexy pop siren without truly committing to either\" and that \"her chameleonic ability\" matches \"some of rap's most verbose, witty, filthy and pop-friendly\" stars such as Eminem and Lil Wayne.[329] Zoe Johnson of XXL, stated that in recent years Minaj's \"beat selection has moved to refined production full of grit and hip-hop flare in recent years\".[330]\n\nAlter egos\n\n\"Roman Zolanski\" redirects here. Not to be confused with Roman Polanski.\n\nWith her parents frequently fighting during her childhood, Minaj lived through characters she created as a means of escape. She recalled that \"fantasy was my reality\" and her first identity was Cookie, who became Harajuku Barbie and (later) Nicki Minaj.[331] In November 2010, Minaj assumed the alter ego Nicki Teresa, wearing a colorful headdress and calling herself \"healer to her fans\" during a visit to the Garden of Dreams Foundation at Fuse Studios in New York.[332] She introduced another alter ego, Rosa (pronounced with an exaggerated R), to commemorate her December 2010 appearance on Lopez Tonight.[333]\n\nOne of Minaj's most well-known alter-egos is \"a demon inside her\" named Roman Zolanski (named after film director Roman Polanski with modified surname), Minaj's \"twin brother\", whose character she assumes when she is angry.[334] Roman has been compared to Eminem's alter ego Slim Shady, and on \"Roman's Revenge\" Minaj and Eminem collaborate as their alter egos.[335] On her next album, she said that there would be a lot of Roman: \"And if you're not familiar with Roman, then you will be familiar with him very soon. He's the boy that lives inside of me. He's a lunatic and he's gay and he'll be on there a lot.\"[336] Roman has a mother, Martha Zolanski,[337] who appeared on \"Roman's Revenge\" with a British accent[338] and singing on \"Roman Holiday\" for the first time.[339][340] Martha appeared in the \"Moment 4 Life\" video as Minaj's apparent fairy godmother.[334] In December 2023, in response to a fan inquiry on Martha ever returning, Minaj confirmed that Martha had died of old age.[341]\n\nInfluences\n\nMinaj cites Lil Wayne, Foxy Brown, and Jay-Z as major influences: \"I can't even imagine my career, my creative spirit without Wayne [...] I feel like I'm still intertwined with him creatively\". Minaj has called Lil Wayne her mentor and credited him with discovering her.[342][343] On Foxy Brown and Jay-Z, Minaj said: \"I really loved [Foxy] as a female rapper. I was really interested in her mind and her aura [and] I was really, really into Jay-Z. Me and my friends in high school, we were reciting all of the Jay lyrics. His words were our words in our conversations all the time.\"[344]\n\nShe said, further: \"I never really told Foxy how much she has influenced me and how much she changed my life\" adding that Foxy Brown was \"the most influential female rapper\" for her.[345] Minaj said in a T Magazine interview in 2017: \"Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Foxy Brown... [...] Those are the three I keep in my head when I'm writing because they've influenced me so much, [...] I feel like I'm a part of all of them.\"[346]\n\nIn 2023, Minaj revealed that popular music singer Whitney Houston is one of her major influences, stating: \"I don’t think people realize how much singing or singers like Whitney [influenced me]. Whitney’s first album, I know it front to back.\"[347]\n\nJada Pinkett Smith is one of Minaj's role models in her acting career.[348] Minaj was inspired by R&B singer Monica, singing \"Why I Love You So Much\" at every talent show she entered. While performing in Atlanta as part of her Pink Friday Tour, she called Monica one of her all-time greatest musical influences. Lauryn Hill is also one of Minaj's major influences, with Minaj quoting her lyrics in a high school yearbook.[349][non-primary source needed][350][non-primary source needed] Minaj has also cited Beyoncé,[351][352] Marilyn Monroe,[353] Madonna,[354] Enya,[355] Eminem,[356] Kanye West, Trina, Drake,[357] Lil' Kim,[358][359][360] Lisa Left Eye Lopes,[361] Janet Jackson,[362] Grace Jones,[363][364] Britney Spears,[365] Remy Ma and Missy Elliott as influences.[366]\n\nShe called Betsey Johnson a fashion inspiration: \"[Betsey] is a free spirit. When I met her the other day, I felt like I knew her for my whole life. She's so warm and considerate and caring. She's amazingly talented and I've been wearing her clothes forever, so to meet her was like, 'Yay!' [I was] bowing down to her; she's dope!\"[367] Minaj has also expressed appreciation for Cyndi Lauper's style and how her videos inspired her as a teenager: \"When I first went to get my hair colored, I was about 14 and I wanted blonde highlights. The beautician said, 'No, you have to get your mother on the phone,' and I was just crying and begging. I've always been experimenting. Cyndi Lauper's videos – that's what intrigued me.\"[368]\n\nPublic image\n\nBillboard listed Minaj as the fourth-most-active musician on social media on its March 2011 Social 50 chart.[369] She is the most followed rapper on Instagram with over 229 million followers—the first to surpass 200 million followers—and one of the most followed musicians on the social media platform.[370][371] On Twitter, she is one of the most followed rappers, with over 28 million followers on the app, as of February 2024.[372][non-primary source needed] She was the most followed rapper on Twitter in 2012.[373] BET has named Minaj as a \"gay icon\".[374] Minaj was a vocal proponent of streams counting towards an artist's RIAA certifications. The organization later announced in 2016 that it would be modernizing the certification process for albums, including on-demand audio and video streams.[375][376]\n\nMinaj has been called as a \"fashion icon\" by Allure, Time, XXL and has been called a \"camp style icon\" by Refinery29.[377][378][379][380] She has cited Alexander McQueen, Gianni Versace, and Christian Louboutin as her favorite designers.[381] The Huffington Post described her style as \"risk-taking\" and \"far-out\", with \"bold sartorial choices\";[382] Minaj has been included on the annual Maxim Hot 100 list several times.[383][384] In 2014, Minaj underwent a reinvention in her image sporting a \"natural\" and \"softer\" look, wearing fewer wigs and less colourful costumes.[385] She stated that she \"went so far to the other side that there's only one place to go from there. You can either continue doing costumes or you can just say, \"Hey guess what? This will shock them even more. Doing nothing will shock them even more\"\".[385][386]\n\nHer physique, notably her buttocks, has attracted significant attention from the media.[387][388] Early in her career, she made autographing breasts part of her movement to empower women.[389] In 2010, she said that although she originally felt obligated to mimic the provocative behavior of the \"female rappers of [her] day\", she intended to subdue her sexuality because she \"[wants] people—especially young girls—to know that in life, nothing is going to be based on sex appeal. You've got to have something else to go with that.\"[390][391]\n\nMinaj talked about feminism in an interview with Vogue in 2015, saying \"There are things that I do that feminists don't like, and there are things that I do that they do like. I don't label myself. I just say the truth about what I feel. I feel like women can do anything that they put their minds to.\"[392] In 2018, an interview with Elle, in which she discussed sex workers, her own sex appeal, and sexuality in music and on social media, attracted criticism.[393][394] In The New York Times Magazine, music critic Vanessa Grigoriadis said that Minaj \"has become expert at modelling the ways that women can wield power in the industry. But she has also drawn attention to the ways in which power can be embodied by a woman standing up for herself and speaking her own mind.\"[395]\n\nThe cover art and music video for her 2014 single, \"Anaconda\", attracted significant media attention upon release.[396] The music video was viewed 19.6 million times in its first 24 hours of release.[397] The Guardian called the video \"racy\" but noted that she \"doesn't shy from ruffling her audience's feathers\",[398] while others praised Minaj for \"owning her sexuality\",[399] examining her work through a feminist perspective.[396][400][401][402] Another writer for The Guardian said, of the \"Anaconda\" video, Minaj turns \"the classic song into a conversation, and [refuses] to let the camera objectify her lap dance by keeping it zoomed out, at a distance.\"[403]\n\nMinaj's fanbase, known as the \"Barbz\", have been reported as often being militant towards Minaj's critics, including incidents of reported doxxing, cyberbullying, and death threats.[404][405][406][407]\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nIn 2010, Minaj performed a cover of \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\", alongside singer Katy Perry, for service members during the 2010 VH1 Divas Salute the Troops concert.[408][409] The two would later collaborate in 2017 on \"Swish Swish\". In 2011, Mattel created a Barbie doll with Minaj's likeness to auction for Project Angel Food, a charity that provides food for people afflicted with HIV and AIDS.[410] In 2012, in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, Minaj donated $15,000 to the Food Bank For New York City and held a turkey drive at her alma mater, PS 45.[411]\n\nIn May 2017, Minaj offered via Twitter to pay college tuition fees and student loans for 30 of her fans. She appeared to grant their requests, ranging from $500 to school supplies to $6,000 for tuition, promising to respond to more requests in a month or two.[412] She also announced that she would launch an official charity for student loans and tuition payments in the near future.[413] In the same month, Minaj revealed on Instagram that she has been donating money to a village in India for a few years via her pastor, Lydia Sloley. These donations helped the village get a computer center, a tailoring institute, a reading program, and two water wells. \"This is the kind of thing that makes me feel the most proud\", she said about the new additions to the village.[414]\n\nIn August 2017, after Hurricane Harvey hit the city of Houston, Texas, Minaj answered a social media challenge by comedian and actor Kevin Hart and donated $25,000 to the Red Cross, saying she was \"praying for everyone there\".[415][416] On September 4, 2018, Minaj appeared as a guest and performed several songs on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.[417] Throughout the episode, Minaj and Degeneres, with the participation of Walmart, gave out over $150,000 in donations to fans.[418][174]\n\nIn 2019, Minaj pulled out of headlining a concert in Saudi Arabia following online backlash from activists, after women's rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul was detained and arrested for speaking out against the Saudi regime. Minaj was praised by Thor Halvorssen of The Human Rights Foundation, who criticized her initial plan to perform in a letter, and released a statement saying, \"After careful reflection ... I believe it is important for me to make clear my support for the rights of women, the LGBTQ community and freedom of expression.\"[419][420]\n\nIn 2020, Minaj donated $25,000 to the St. Jude's Home for Girls school after visiting the school in her native country of Trinidad. In a speech, Minaj encouraged the girls to push through hard obstacles, even referencing her own experience with domestic violence: \"I've experienced being in a home with domestic violence. I've experienced, you know, being at a very difficult crossroads in my life as a teenager. And sometimes as a teenager when things happen, you feel like there's no up from there.\"[421] In the same year, following the release of Minaj and 6ix9ine's collaboration, \"Trollz\", Minaj announced that a portion of the proceeds from the song, along with profits from all merchandise, will go towards the Bail Project amid the Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd.[422] In April 2024, Minaj was one of over 200 artists who signed an open letter speaking to and asking for safety from the \"predatory use of AI\" in the music industry.[423]\n\nCultural impact and status\n\nVarious media outlets, such as Billboard, Time, NME, Rolling Stone, NBC News and Cosmopolitan, have referred to Minaj as the \"Queen of Rap\" and The New York Times, The Washington Post, NPR, and The Los Angeles Times have referred to her as the \"Queen of Hip Hop\".[424][425] Several media outlets, including The New York Times, Evening Standard, and Nylon, have also called her one of the most influential rappers.[426] Minaj was ranked as the tenth greatest rapper of all time on Billboard and Vibe's list of the 50 greatest rappers (2023).[9] In 2024, Billboard named her the \"hottest female rapper\" and stated that she \"remains at the apex of the rap mountain 15 years after the release of her breakout mixtape, Beam Me Up Scotty\".[427]\n\nIn 2012, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called Minaj \"the most influential female rapper of all time\", and in 2015 Vanessa Grigoriadis from its magazine called her \"the world's biggest female rap superstar\".[315][395] In Evening Standard, Jochan Embley called her one of the most influential rap artists of all time, saying that \"Everything she does is bold, fearless and distinct – whether that be her eye-popping stage attire or her expertly delivered lyrics, which stare gender and race dead in the eye.\"[428] Zoe Johnson from XXL called her \"one of the most versatile MCs\" and that she has \"made millions off upbeat pop hits and traditional hip-hop sounds that cater to both her femininity and her assertive side\".[330]\n\nFor NPR Music, Sowmya Krishnamurthy noted that Minaj has portrayed \"the quirky, life-size Barbie, glamorous vixen and girl-next-door\", arguing that she \"changed the landscape for artists in hip-hop for the past decade\" with said alter egos.[429] In 2017, Patrik Sandberg of Dazed argued that Minaj has \"surpassed every other female hip hop artist to become the most successful in history\" in 2017.[430] In 2020, Nick Soulsby of PopMatters called her the \"best female rapper and the best rapper of the past ten years – no gender preposition required.\"[431] Glamour included Minaj in their list of 104 women who defined 2010s pop culture.[432]\n\nIn XXL, Madeline Roth commented that Minaj \"has helped birth a new generation of rappers that mimic her style\".[330] She has influenced several artists, including Tinashe,[433] Cher Lloyd,[434] Cupcakke,[435] Billie Eilish,[436] Lil Nas X,[437] Ms Banks,[438] Asian Doll,[439] Doja Cat,[440] Megan Thee Stallion,[441] Latto,[442] Shenseea,[443] BIA,[444] Lakeyah,[445] Luísa Sonza,[446] Coi Leray,[447][non-primary source needed] Maliibu Miitch,[448] City Girls,[449] Baby Tate,[450] Ice Spice,[451] Rico Nasty,[452] Flo Milli,[453] Ivorian Doll,[454] Angel Haze,[455] Rubi Rose, and Saweetie.[456] Billboard credited her for bringing female rap back to the mainstream in the U.S.[457] With over 140 features, the magazine has called Minaj a \"rap and pop icon\" adding that \"she's been one of popular music's most reliable guest performers, notching dozens of chart hits as a supporting presence on other artists' singles.\"[458] Minaj has been credited by Complex for being able to \"take a simple song and turn it into a smash hit just because she's featured on it.\"[459] In 2012, Caramanica in The New York Times said that:\n\nMinaj \"became a nimble, evocative rapper. She became an intricate lyricist. She became a thoughtful singer. She became a risky performer. She invented new personae. More than any other rapper in the mainstream, she pushed hard against expectations ... with no one around to compare herself to, or for others to compare her to, she became her own watermark.\"[460]\n\nIn 2014, NPR's Erik Nielson said that Minaj's \"success over the last decade has stood as an exception to the unwritten rule that women rappers no longer have a place among elite artists\".[461] Nylon writer, Demicia Inman, also credited Minaj for her influence which \"stands as one of the most successful rappers of the millennium\", also going on to say that Minaj \"battled misogyny and industry bias against black women to carve her own identity and sound\" thus impacting her career. Complex also commented that, \"From her bold outfits to her multi-colored wigs, Minaj oozed confidence that inspired others who were watching closely... [she] doesn't need anything but her art to speak for itself\".[462][463] Michael Saponara of Billboard wrote that Minaj \"reaffirmed living legend status\" by \"hitting the road for the Pink Friday 2 World Tour\"—which became the highest-grossing tour by a female rapper—and proved herself as rap's \"centrifugal female force\".[427]\n\nAchievements\n\nMinaj is the recipient of numerous accolades, including nine American Music Awards, twelve BET Awards, eight BET Hip Hop Awards, four Billboard Music Awards, eight MTV Video Music Awards, ten MTV Europe Music Awards, four People's Choice Awards, one Soul Train Music Award, and four Teen Choice Awards.

The lawsuit was settled in September after the company changed the snack's name to \"Bar-B-Quin\".[558] Minaj released a \"variety pack\" with Rap Snacks in October,[559] and a \"Nocho Nachos\" nachos flavor in March 2023, inspired by her 2023 single, \"Red Ruby Da Sleeze\".[560] Also in October, the rapper appeared alongside Lil Baby, Kane Brown, Pete Davidson, and Bukayo Saka in a trailer for the first-person shooter video game, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II.[561]\n\nIn March 2024, Minaj launched her press-on nails line, Pink Friday Nails.[562] A vegan and cruelty-free brand, it was launched DTC via its webstore,[563] and later made available via Shopify as well.[564] Pop-up stations dedicated to the range were held exclusively to VIP ticket holders on the Pink Friday 2 World Tour.[565] In April, she and British apparel brand Loci released a sneaker collection.[566] Minaj clarified that the association was not \"a sponsorship. [She is] an owner and partner\".[567] Loci announced that month that Minaj joined the brand as a co-owner and investor.[568]\n\nHeavy On It Records\n\nOn March 3, 2023, Minaj announced the launch of her record label imprint on an episode of her radio show, \"Queen Radio\". Minaj did not reveal the name of the label but did say her long-time friend Patty \"Patty Duke\" Lauren has signed on as the label's A&R. Minaj also unveiled her starting roster: Nana Fofie, Tate Kobang, Rico Danna, and London Hill.[569][570][571]\n\nOn March 13, 2023, Minaj revealed the name of her imprint as \"Heavy On It Records\". The label currently has a venture with Republic Records.[572]\n\nGaming\n\nA playable character model of Minaj in her \"Red Ruby\" persona was released as downloadable content to the first-person shooter video game, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II in July 2023 alongside those of rappers Snoop Dogg and 21 Savage to commemorate the 50th anniversary of hip-hop music's origin; her character marked the first woman \"operator\" of the game.[573]\n\nOn December 8, 2023, she and Roblox introduced the virtual world Gag City on the game platform to promote her fifth album, Pink Friday 2 (2023).[574][575] Days before the launch, Minaj's fanbase, the Barbz, heavily circulated AI-generated content of the fan-made cityscape Gag City, a pink futuristic metropolis inspired by the cover artwork of the album, which the rapper herself coined on her social media.[576][577]\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn her songs \"All Things Go\" and \"Autobiography\", Minaj revealed that she had an abortion as a teenager. She has said that although it has \"haunted\" her, she stands by her decision.[578] In July 2011, her cousin Nicholas Telemaque was murdered near his home in Brooklyn, an incident she references in her songs \"All Things Go\" and \"Champion\".[579] Minaj's father, Robert Maraj, died in February 2021, while walking along a road on Long Island, in a hit-and-run accident.[16] Charles Polevich, a 70-year-old man, was charged as the suspect of Maraj's death. Polevich was arraigned and charged with two felonies, which were leaving scene of incident involving death of a person and tampering with or suppressing physical evidence.[580] Three months later, she commented on her father's death in a letter, saying, \"[...] it has been the most devastating loss of my life. I find myself wanting to call him all the time, more so now that he's gone. [...] May his soul rest in paradise. He was very loved & will be very missed.\"[581]\n\nRelationships\n\nIn late 2014, Minaj separated from her longtime boyfriend Safaree Samuels, whom she had dated since 2003.[b] According to Minaj, he had proposed to her, but she declined.[582] Several tracks on The Pinkprint are believed to have been inspired by the end of their relationship.[583] Minaj began dating rapper Meek Mill in early 2015.[584] In January 2017, she announced that she had ended their relationship.[585][586][587] She briefly dated fellow rapper Nas in 2017.[588]\n\nMinaj began dating her childhood friend Kenneth \"Zoo\" Petty (born 7 April 1978) in December 2018,[589] and after less than a year of dating, filed for a marriage license in August 2019.[590][591] She announced that they had officially married in October, hyphenating his last name to hers upon marriage.[592] Petty was convicted of first-degree attempted rape in 1995.[593] He served four years in prison and was required to register as a sex offender upon release. In 2006, Petty was convicted of first-degree manslaughter, for which he served an additional six years and eleven months in prison.[594] In July 2020, Minaj announced via Instagram that she was expecting her first child.[595] She gave birth to a son on September 30, whom she refers to publicly as \"Papa Bear\". His real name is still unknown.[596][597][598][599]\n\nLegal issues\n\nAfter facing charges for failing to register as a sex offender in California, Minaj's husband Kenneth Petty was entered into the California Megan's Law database in 2020, having been convicted of attempted rape in 1995 in New York.[593] He previously served nearly four years in prison for the mentioned crime.[600][601] In August 2021, her husband's victim, named Jennifer Hough, filed a lawsuit against the couple for alleged harassment and intimidation, and alleged infliction of emotional distress, and did an interview about the mentioned lawsuit on the talk show The Real.[602][603][604]\n\nMinaj has not addressed the accusations publicly, but has spoken about it in a private case filing. Minaj claimed she \"never asked [Hough] to change her story\" and \"never offered her any money in return for a statement\".[605] Hough later voluntarily dismissed the case against Minaj whilst the case against Petty is still pending.[606][607] Speaking to a federal judge, Hough's lawyers expressed that they were going to refile the lawsuit in California due to jurisdictional issues while Minaj's lawyer said that the refiling was a \"frivolous gambit to avoid a sanctions motion\" and that \"their claims received an aggressive response\".[608]\n\nOn May 25, 2024, Minaj was arrested at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, Netherlands after marijuana was found in her luggage.[609][610] The arrest occurred as she was attempting to board a plane for a concert in Manchester, England.[610][609] Though she would be released the same day, Minaj would postpone the Manchester show.[609][610]\n\nFeuds\n\nMinaj has been embroiled in several feuds with other artists, including female rappers Lil' Kim, Remy Ma, Cardi B, Latto, and Megan Thee Stallion. After Lil' Kim and media critics noticed resemblances between Minaj and her on the Sucka Free mixtape,[611] Lil' Kim accused Minaj of copying her image saying, \"If you are going to steal my swag, you gonna have to pay. Something gotta give. You help me, I help you. That's how it goes to me.\"[611] Minaj's single \"Roman's Revenge\" with Eminem was believed by critics to be a response to Lil' Kim's comments,[612] although at the time she denied this.[613] However, in a 2018 interview with Genius, Minaj seemingly confirmed that the track \"Roman's Revenge\" was about the feud, saying, \"Someone got at me. A veteran got at me, and I hit them with 'Roman's Revenge' and then I kept on going.\"[614] Lil' Kim reignited the feud following the release of her mixtape Black Friday, an album that directly referenced Nicki Minaj, including artwork that showed Lil' Kim decapitating Minaj with a sword.[615] A fragment of Minaj's diss track \"Tragedy\" was released online in April 2011, featuring lyrics \"Pink Friday, Eminem, 8 Mile/ It must hurt to sell your album on PayPal.\"[616] Following the release of Minaj's second album, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, critics suggested that the track \"Stupid Hoe\" may have contained attacks at Lil' Kim.[617]\n\nIn 2007, Nicki Minaj released her debut mixtape, Playtime is Over, featuring the song \"Dirty Money\", on which she raps, \"Tell that bitch with the crown to run it like Chris Brown,\" over the beat of rapper Remy Ma's song \"Yeah Yeah Yeah\". Ma, who frequently referred to herself in lyrics as the \"queen of rap\", believed the verse to be directed towards her and confronted Minaj during a release party about the lyric.[618] Ma later rapped several verses which fans perceived to be against Minaj, including in a cypher during the 2016 BET Hip Hop Awards, on her song \"Money Showers\" with Fat Joe, on a remix of the Phresher song \"Wait a Minute\",[619] and in a freestyle on Funkmaster Flex's show on the radio station Hot 97.[620] In 2017, Minaj featured on the songs \"Swalla\" with Jason Derulo and \"Make Love\" with Gucci Mane, in which she took apparent shots at Ma, including criticizing her disses and mocking her low album sales.[621][622] One day after the release of \"Make Love\", Ma recorded and released the song \"Shether\", a diss track in which she attacked Minaj for allegedly using a ghostwriter, her alleged plastic surgery, her fashion, her record deal, and the child sexual assault charges against Minaj's brother, and more.[623] Minaj responded on Instagram by posting a screenshot of an article showing the opening week sales of Ma's album Plata O Plomo as well as a video of Beyoncé calling Minaj a \"rap queen\".[618] Ma later released a second diss track directed at Minaj, \"Another One\"; in response, Minaj released \"No Frauds\" with Drake and Lil Wayne, a diss track aimed at Remy Ma whose title and chorus references the lyric \"I swear to God, this chick a real fraud\" from \"Another One\".[624][625] In \"No Frauds\", Minaj criticizes Ma for her time in jail and her record sales, while also accusing Ma of getting plastic surgery and not being able to get clearance from Jay-Z to include the remix of \"All the Way Up\" on Plata O Plomo.[626] Following its release, Minaj posted to Instagram, writing that she was issuing a challenge to Ma, giving her \"72 hours to drop a hit\" and promising her half a million dollars if she was able to \"book any show or interview\" without mentioning Minaj, while also defending herself against criticism of the delayed timing of her response to Ma.[624] \"No Frauds\" was negatively received by critics, who felt that it was not as impressive as Ma's \"Shether\" and that the appearance of Drake and Lil Wayne on the diss track was a mistake.[627][628]\n\nAt a New York Fashion Week after-party in September 2018, fellow rapper Cardi B threw one of her high heel shoes at Minaj and attempted to physically attack her; bodyguards intervened before she could reach Minaj, leaving Cardi B with a large bump on her forehead.[629][630][631] Following the altercation, she alleged on Instagram that Minaj had previously \"liked\" social media comments that spoke negatively of Cardi B's ability to take care of her newborn daughter.[632] Minaj denied the allegations on her Queen Radio show, claiming she \"would never talk about anyone’s child or parenting\", and expressed embarrassment at the fight.[633] She accused Cardi B of building \"her career off of sympathy and payola\" and of bribing DJs and radio outlets with sex to play her records. Minaj also criticized Cardi B's rapping ability, saying, \"Do you know what it’s like to sit in your room for hours writing raps? You came into my fucking culture. I never had to fuck a DJ to play my songs.\"[634] Minaj also called Cardi B a \"disgusting pig\" for allegedly cyberbullying a guest caller on Minaj's show and for unearthed posts calling dark-skinned black women “cockroaches.”[635]\n\nIn 2022, a feud ignited between Minaj and fellow rapper Latto after Minaj went on Instagram Live to express her frustration with her song \"Super Freaky Girl\" reportedly being placed in the pop categories instead of the rap categories for voting consideration at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards. By way of comparison, Minaj mentioned Latto's 2021 song \"Big Energy\" as an example of a song that should also not be considered for the rap categories.[636] She further alleged that there is a \"concerted effort to give newer artists things that they really don’t deserve\" and that soon the female rap genre will no longer \"have any black women\", which was taken to be a dig against Latto, whose mother is white and father is black.[637] Latto then tweeted, \"Damn I can’t win for losing… all these awards/noms I can’t even celebrate,\" which was perceived as a response to Minaj's commentary. Minaj responded with a tweet calling Latto a \"Karen\", a term typically reserved for white women, and criticizing her for previously claiming to be a fan yet not standing up for her.[638] Latto then tweeted that she agreed with Minaj's case but felt the way she brought up Latto's song \"seems malicious\", alleging that Minaj had been making subliminal tweets about her and had said on the phone that Latto is not \"flourishing\" and that no one cares about her \"little song.\" This sparked a heated back-and-forth exchange of tweets, in which Latto insulted Minaj's age and her family members by saying she is \"married and related to rapists\", while Minaj insulted Latto's appearance for looking like \"the one pushing 40\" and for \"wiping that spray tan off & being a Karen\", continuing to use the slang term usually for white women.[639] The back-and-forth carried on through the night, with Latto airing out past subliminal digs by Minaj and Minaj posting a screenshot of a text Latto sent her, followed by Latto releasing an audio recording of a phone conversation the two had. In the end, Minaj deleted all of her tweets to Latto, only leaving behind a video clip of Whitney Houston laughing uncontrollably in a music video, while Latto continued to declare that Minaj is a \"40 Year Old Bully.\"[639][638]\n\nAlthough having collaborated on the 2019 single \"Hot Girl Summer\", Minaj's relationship with fellow rapper Megan Thee Stallion grew cold after Megan allegedly tried to persuade Minaj to consume alcohol while she was trying to conceive a child.[640][641] Minaj threw subliminal shots at Megan in her 2023 singles \"Red Ruby da Sleeze\" and \"FTCU\", both of which make references to the 2020 shooting of Megan by Tory Lanez according to critics and fans.[642][643][644][645] In 2024, Megan Thee Stallion released the song \"Hiss\", in which she raps the line that people \"don't be mad at Megan\", but that they're \"mad at Megan's Law\", naming the law regarding sex offenders.[646] Believing it to be directed at her and her husband, registered sex offender Kenneth Petty, Minaj took to Instagram Live to preview her own song, a diss track against Megan called \"Big Foot\", alluding to the shooting of Megan's foot.[647] For the next several days, Minaj continued to attack Megan on social media, calling the rapper a \"pathological and manipulative liar\", accusing her of winning \"fraudulent awards\", and describing her as a \"flop\" compared to her own success.[648] She addressed Megan on Instagram Live by saying, \"You bringing up 30-year-old tea from when this man was a 15-year-old child. You bringing up 30-year-old tea cause no man will ever fucking love you, and lying on your dead mother\", referencing Megan's mother, who died of brain cancer in March 2019. On the radio app Stationhead, Minaj continued to discuss Megan's mother, as well as Tory Lanez and former collaborator DaBaby: \"You let everyone be thrown under the bus. You let DaBaby be thrown under the bus, Tory, your best friend, your mom... You better go conjure up your mother and apologize. That’s disgusting.\"[649] Megan posted an Instagram story where she was doubled over with her left hand on her mouth, seemingly laughing at Minaj's response.[650] Two days after the release of \"Hiss\", Minaj released the song \"Big Foot\", a diss track against Megan Thee Stallion.[651] A few hours prior to the release of \"Big Foot\", Minaj disclosed that her team was waiting for producer Lil Juju to clear the beat \"that [she] had for 6 years\" and suggested that Megan tried to prevent the diss track from coming out.[298] In the song, Minaj taunts Megan over her dead mother, her appearance, and her ex-boyfriend Pardison Fontaine; various publications reported that the song was poorly received by critics and fans, who criticized the production, the rap flow, and the shots at Megan for being lacking in quality.[301][302][303] On the fifth day of Minaj's continued \"intense fixation\" with Megan following \"Hiss\", as Rolling Stone labeled it, she speculated on Twitter's Spaces that Megan's management company, Roc Nation, had launched a smear campaign against her and accused Megan of seeking sympathy as a victim of violence to further her career, saying \"She wanted a Rihanna moment so bad\", an allusion to Chris Brown's 2009 assault on Rihanna.[652]\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine tweets\n\nIn September 2021, Minaj announced she would not be attending the 2021 Met Gala due to the COVID-19 vaccine requirement. She stated that she has avoided public appearances and traveling after contracting the virus herself and having to quarantine from her son as a result.[653][654][655] She shared several tweets about her unvaccinated status and claimed she wanted to do more research and be comfortable with her decision first.[656] She alleged in a tweet that her cousin's friend in Trinidad suffered swollen testicles and became impotent as a result of the vaccine.[657] These tweets received backlash where her story about her cousin's friend became the subject of jokes and memes.[658] Trinidad and Tobago health minister Terrence Deyalsingh declared that her claims were false and that no such report existed.[659]\n\nShortly after, Minaj recommended other people get the vaccine and set up a Twitter poll on COVID-19 vaccine brands. She tweeted that she was sure she would get vaccinated herself because of touring.[660][661] The White House offered her a phone call with a doctor to answer questions about the safety of the vaccine.[662] In an Instagram Live response two days later, she claimed that she was simply asking questions and she did not give any facts about the vaccine.[663] Minaj alleged that reporters harassed her family for a story, with her sharing some text messages she alleged were harassment on social media.[664] In May 2022, Olivia Truffaut-Wong of The Cut stated that Minaj had likely gotten vaccinated, as the 2022 Met Gala (which Minaj attended) required proof of vaccination and a negative COVID-19 PCR test to attend.[665]\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nPink Friday (2010)\n\nPink Friday: Roman Reloaded (2012)\n\nThe Pinkprint (2014)\n\nQueen (2018)\n\nPink Friday 2 (2023)\n\nFilmography\n\nMain article: Nicki Minaj videography\n\nIce Age: Continental Drift (2012)\n\nThe Other Woman (2014)\n\nBarbershop: The Next Cut (2016)\n\nThe Angry Birds Movie 2 (2019)\n\nTours\n\nHeadlining\n\nPink Friday Tour (2011–2012)\n\nPink Friday: Reloaded Tour (2012)\n\nThe Pinkprint Tour (2015–2016)\n\nPink Friday 2 World Tour (2024)\n\nCo-headlining\n\nThe Nicki Wrld Tour (2019)\n\nOpening act\n\nLil Wayne – America's Most Wanted Tour (2008)\n\nLil Wayne – I Am Music II Tour (2011)\n\nBritney Spears – Femme Fatale Tour (2011)\n\nSee also\n\nTrinidad and Tobago portal\n\nNew York City portal\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nHope, Clover (2021).
