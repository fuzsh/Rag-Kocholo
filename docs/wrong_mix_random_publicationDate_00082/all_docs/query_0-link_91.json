        "text": "Eugene Edwards (ne Jaramillo) shows up right on time, carrying two hot coffees and pastries from the Silver Lake staple Café Tropical.\n\nNo one asked for treats, but he’s got ’em, and a smile.\n\nHe unpacks a little Fender amp, an American made $2k Fender Telecaster, a mic stand and a mic.\n\nBut most importantly he arrives with tons of energy, and a never-ending wealth of stories and knowledge of music history and theory. It’s no wonder we, two strangers, ended up talking and laughing for three hours. (Fret not, Jordan edited it down to one tight hour.)\n\nWhen he’s not winning over podcasters, Eugene tours the world as the lead guitarist for country star Dwight Yoakam.\n\nSo naturally we began our conversation about a podcast episode he did where he and his co-host, Dave Rayburn, marveled over Elvis Costello’s awe-inspiring “Get Happy” (1980). Their podcast, The Jukebox Graduate is a beautifully produced conversation between two longtime friends as they chat about records that mean a great deal to them.\n\nTony Pierce: You’re an excitable person. You’re a lively character. You’re meant for the stage, and you’re also incredible behind the mic. I have not heard energy from you like when you talked about Elvis Costello’s “Get Happy.”\n\nEugene Edwards: Yeah man.\n\nThere’s several themes that have developed so far in the 35+ episodes of this podcast. One is you can’t put people in a box.\n\nSome might say, “oh you’re Native American, you have no business in a white guy’s country band.”\n\nOr “you play a Telecaster, you have no business talking about metal.”\n\nSo, ‘Get Happy,’ which I don’t believe has any guitar solos —\n\nIt sort of does. Okay. So that’s interesting. You’re right. What would attract, a guitar player…?\n\nAnd that is if I were to put you in a box. But you love it for the reasons I do, because there are 20 great songs, right?\n\nIt’s hooks. The melodic movement.\n\nAlso, the band is playing in that Stax / Volt / Motown… they’re playing with a little more swing to them than they were on the previous two albums…\n\nThey throw that playbook [of the first two records] out the window, and make ‘Get Happy’ and decide they’re just gonna pretend that they’re making an old Motown record, which is great.\n\nCostello’s the least-accomplished musician on his instrument in that band. But of course he’s a great songwriter and singer, so that’s his primary thing. But when he needs to imitate a Booker T. or an or Al Green thing, he knew he could put that together. He could make that go.\n\nWhen I saw John Fogerty years ago at the Kodak, he had four guitarists even though he was the only one who soloed.\n\nRight.\n\nWe both love Springsteen. He’s got four guitar players. That seems like a lot. He’s got his wife on guitar, you can’t kick her out.\n\nYeah, she’s strumming.\n\nYou got Little Steven.\n\nAnd he’s still got Nils.\n\nAnd Bruce is a very good guitar player.\n\nHow come Elvis doesn’t get a real guitar player like you?\n\nElvis, I’m open, buddy. I’m good usually Sunday nights through Wednesday nights.\n\nIs it ego? Because we know Elvis doesn’t get along with everybody.\n\nYou mean that’s why he doesn’t have another guitar player?\n\nWould it kill him to have one?\n\nMy theory is that that set his overall sound apart.\n\nGrowing up as a kid, a latchkey kid in Yuma, Arizona, and watching MTV videos at the time in the early ’80s, there was Tom Petty and Mike Campbell, the guitar player. There was the singer/songwriter and the lead guitar player.\n\nThere’s always a lead guitar player in every rock band except for this one.\n\nSo I think it was just, “well, if we do that, then our songs will have that guitar solo thing just like everyone else’s.” So I think he was always trying to dodge what everyone else was doing. And that kind of forced them to not be typical.\n\nAnd he also has the secret weapon of Steve Nieve.\n\nHe’s unique.\n\nI don’t think any rock and roll keyboard player has so many flurries going on in the background. And then when it’s time for the solo, Elvis hands it over to Steve.\n\nTrust me, as a kid who would sit at the edge of his bed playing along to Costello albums, there’s nowhere to jam some lead guitar noodling. It’s really dense stuff.\n\nSo why does Springsteen have so many guitar players? Because “Growin’ Up,” which you get your podcast’s name from, barely needs one. It’s a piano song with a piano solo. So why’s he carrying so much weight?\n\nAnd then he brings in Tom Morello!\n\nI think the thing here is that he has both Steven and Nils at the same time. I think this is a matter of “I don’t wanna make a Sophie’s Choice. I put the band back together. Steve’s available and so is Nils.” And it’s like “just put them both on the bus, it’s fine.”\n\nPlus Nils can play lap steel, and accordion.\n\nAnd he’s a great singer.\n\nI think you now get to spread things out quite a bit. But I think it’s also not about how to deliver the music in any specific way, I think now a Springsteen concert is like this big family reunion.\n\nThey’re two men down, now. They’ve lost two E. Street band members. So now it’s sort of like, “while we can have absolutely everybody let’s just bring absolutely everybody.”\n\nExcellent points. But also you’re a touring musician. And even though you’re ridiculously talented — I’ve only a heard one bad note from you in everything I’ve seen on YouTube.\n\nAnd I’m not kissing your ass. I was trying. I was hoping to find a bad note.\n\nI think there’s something to be said for the guy in the van who’s not a fucking asshole. Someone you can get along with.\n\nNow you’ve hit the thing. If you have a national-level gig, like I do, you will get asked… “How do you get a gig like this?”\n\nMe and other guys, sidemen, if you will, we talk about this a lot.\n\nLook, there’s somewhat of a minimum amount of proficiency you truly need on any given instrument. You have to know enough.\n\nBut it really does boil down to, “can I live with you for two weeks on a bus? The hang is soooo crucial.\n\nI was referred to Dwight when he needed a guitar player by a great friend of mine who was already in his band.\n\nHe said, “hey Dwight wants to talk to us.”\n\nSo I go down to talk to him about it. There was a guitar there and I picked it up and he had an acoustic. He would just start like some old Sun Records tune and I’d play along. Or he’d start on an old Merle Haggard song and I’d play along. I don’t think we even played much… an intro, a verse, and then we just stopped and talked.\n\nHe didn’t need to hear me. He didn’t need to see, “can you play this lick and play that lick?” He just sort of gestured to me and said, “well, obviously you’re, you’re a guitar player. Are you available to do these dates?”\n\nHe didn’t wanna be burdened with, “well, let’s see your technique.”\n\nIt’s like, “well, you were referred. I know you must have technique.”\n\nAnd I think it probably didn’t hurt that I have no serious addictions, I’m a homeowner, husband, father, like I have responsibility, so I’m accountable for something.\n\nI’ll probably show up when I’m supposed to.\n\nAre you the one that’s always late for the 4 p.m. Lobby Call or sound check?\n\nHow often are we asking, “hey, where’s So-and-So?”\n\nThose are the demerits.\n\nMoving to Eagle Rock at the turn of the Century\n\nWe bought our house in August of 2001 in Eagle Rock. It’s been over 20 years. And I’ll tell you, those first several years, it was tough to sleep at night because there were helicopters overhead.\n\nAnd now, they’re not.\n\nSo you’re gonna have to explain to me how that’s not good.\n\nGentrification is usually somebody saying, “everything was better when I arrived.” They don’t talk about what it was like before your ass got here.\n\nSo all the street names in East LA are very New York-based because guess who was there before the Latinos?\n\nI have a retired uncle who lives in Glendale and he cracks me up because he he’s so angry about the demographic change in Glendale. And I’m just thinking, well how do you think John Wayne’s family felt when your ass moved here in 1960?\n\nWe don’t see ourselves as the change.\n\nOr maybe we get territorial, like, “look, I went through this crap and now I don’t want anyone else ever moving here that doesn’t look like me.”\n\nIt’s a very funny thing.\n\nLet’s talk about guitar solos in country music.\n\nYou mentioned something about this when we were setting up. What’s the question?\n\nThe question is where are they? You get two bars. I feel like most country lead guitar players —\n\nAre you talking about modern country or just in general?\n\nModern country. When you are on the stage with Dwight, you get —\n\nTons.\n\nYes. You do get tons.\n\nBut they’re not long?\n\nNo.\n\nOh. Oh, okay. So yes —\n\nBy the way, Dwight seems very generous about that.\n\nHe is generous.\n\nHe plays his acoustic, he sings his song, all the girls swoon, and then he steps back at the right time. You get some love. And then the steel guitar player gets some love.\n\nAnd that to me is so beautiful. You’re a real band. A full ensemble. You’re all talented musicians.\n\nBut you don’t get to play behind your back. You don’t get to play with your teeth. You don’t set that thing on fire.\n\nI don’t have to, Tony."
