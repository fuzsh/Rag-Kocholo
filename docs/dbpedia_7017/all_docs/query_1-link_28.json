        "text": "Henri Cartan , who died on August 13 aged 104, inherited the mathematical genius of his father, Elie Cartan, and made fundamental advances in the theory of analytic functions, for which he won the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1980.\n\nThe theory of functions of several complex variables had been initiated by Hartogs, Levi and Poincaré shortly after the turn of the 20th century, but it was Cartan who brought it to the centre of modern mathematics. From the 1920s to the 1950s he published papers in this field, synthesising the central ideas in Cartan's Séminaires in the early 1950s.\n\nCartan's accomplishments were broad. As well as analytic functions, he worked on the theory of sheaves, homological theory, algebraic topology and potential theory, producing significant developments in all these areas.\n\nHenri Cartan was born at Nancy, France, on July 8 1904. When he was five, his father Elie, who is considered to be the founder of modern differential geometry, was appointed a lecturer at the Sorbonne and the family moved to Paris.\n\nHenri attended the Lycée Buffon, and the Lycée Hoche at Versailles. He had a sister and two younger brothers, both of whom died tragically. Jean, a composer, died of tuberculosis aged 25; Louis, a physicist, became involved in the Resistance and was executed by the Gestapo in 1944.\n\nElie Cartan never tried to steer any of his children towards a career in mathematics, but from an early age Henri knew that he wanted to be a mathematician. \"Of course, I had some conversations with my father,\" he recalled. \"I was quite surprised when he told me that Euclid's Postulate was not a necessity.\"\n\nHe went on to study the subject at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris, where he became friendly with fellow student André Weil and was taught by Gaston Julia and by his father, who held classes there. The students at the Ecole Normale also attended courses at the Sorbonne, so Henri studied there, too. After graduating he took a doctorate in 1928 under Paul Montel, whose research interests were the theory of analytic functions of a complex variable.\n\nAfter being awarded his doctorate, Cartan taught at the Lycée Caen, then at the University of Lille.\n\nHe published Les transformations analytiques des domaines cerclés les uns dans les autres in 1930. Since this paper acknowledged the work of Heinrich Behnke, he was invited by Behnke to visit Germany in May 1931 and give a series of lectures at Münster. While there, he met Peter Thullen, Behnke's assistant, and they began a collaboration which resulted in a joint paper, Zur Theorie der Singularitäten der Funktionen mehrerer Komplexen Veränderlichen, published in 1932. A joint paper written by Henri and his father Elie, Les transformations des domaines cerclés bornés, appeared in 1931. The same year Cartan took up a post at the University of Strasbourg.\n\nIn January 1935 he attended the first meeting of the \"Bourbaki\" group, young French mathematicians brought together on the initiative of Cartan's friend André Weil to try to revive French mathematics and scientific thinking, which had been disrupted by the carnage of the First World War. In addition to Cartan and Weil, the founding members of Bourbaki were Jean Dieudonné, Szolem Mandelbrojt, Claude Chevalley, René de Possel and Jean Delsarte. Cartan became one of the group's most active participants.\n\nAfter the war ended he returned to Strasbourg and taught there for a further two years, renewing contacts with German mathematicians he had met before the war.\n\nCartan had been invited to the United States in 1942, but decided that he must remain in France for the sake of his family, particularly his father, who by this time was elderly and in poor health. In 1947, however, he flew to New York, where he initiated a fruitful partnership with Samuel Eilenberg which led to the publication of Homological Algebra in 1956.\n\nAfter his two years in Strasbourg, Cartan returned to the Sorbonne. He taught in Paris until 1969 and then at the Université de Paris-Sud at Orsay from 1970 to 1975, when he retired. At the Ecole Normale Supérieure he started the Séminaire Cartan, a series of seminars which were published between 1948 and 1964 and had a huge influence on generations of young mathematicians.\n\nOutside his mathematical work, Cartan became involved in politics and in campaigning for human rights.\n\nWhen, in 1974, the Russian authorities arrested the mathematician Leonid Plyushch and sent him to a psychiatric hospital, Cartan initiated a vigorous campaign for his release, collecting the signatures of more than 1,000 eminent mathematicians on a petition and setting up a committee to support Plyushch and other dissident mathematicians around the world.\n\nPlyushch's release in 1976 was seen as a major success for Cartan and his committee. For his work in assisting dissidents Cartan received the Pagels Award from the New York Academy of Sciences.\n\nIn politics, Cartan became a European Federalist and stood unsuccessfully for election to the European Parliament in 1984 for a party called \"Pour les États-Unis d'Europe\".\n\nHe believed that a United States of Europe could be achieved without encroaching on the rights and responsibilities of member states.\n\nCartan was a member of numerous academies and societies around the world. He was elected to honorary membership of the London Mathematical Society in 1959 and to a fellowship of the Royal Society in 1971. He received the Gold Medal of the National Centre for Scientific Research in 1976, the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1980 and was made a Commander of the Légion d'honneur in 1989."
