Licensed historians do not write much on contemporary history of mathematics. Yet, more and more mathematicians are interested in the history of their discipline, namely in the history of the mathematics they do every day. This book is written for them. This does not prevent it from being written with the intellectual rigour one can expect from a historian as from a mathematician. The book Its goal is the investigation of the works of several mathematicians on the iteration of rational functions during the years 1917–1918, in relation to the topic of the Great Prize of mathematical sciences that was announced by the Paris Academy of Sciences for 1918. We know that this Prize was awarded to Gaston Julia, and that Pierre Fatou, who had also worked on the subject, did not enter the competition. We also know that the subject remained dormant from say the 1920’s to the 1980’s, when it found a new dynamic, popularising the name of Julia and, to a lesser extend, that of Fatou. Our problem could be roughly summarised in two questions: – The reasons why the most influential part of the mathematical community gave preference to Julia will be investigated; Julia was severely injured during the 1914–1918 war, a “gueule cassée” (broken face), he would still be considered sacrosanct in 1944, he was, in 1917–18, a kind of icon; we will shed light on this position by investigating the context, the mathematical texts, and by publishing previously unpublished sources. – To understand the reasons for a fifty year long eclipse in so beautiful a subject is also an interesting question. Briefly: Julia was surrounded by many students but he did not make any of them want to work on the subject; Fatou, as an astronomer at the Paris Observatory, had no students and he died in 1929 (leaving quite a few problems to posterity); on the other hand, the M. Audin, Fatou, Julia, Montel: The Great Prize of Mathematical Sciences of 1918, and Beyond, Lecture Notes in Mathematics 2014, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-17854-2_1, © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011\n\n1\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nnotions which could have made the open questions progress, those contained in Felix Hausdorff’s works for instance, were not spread well in France (for reasons arising from the historical context). Beyond the description from day to day of the mathematical discoveries of Fatou, Julia, Lattès, Ritt and others, which I hope to have made interesting; beyond the obvious effects of the war, the First World War, a neverending slaughter, on the behaviour of the mathematicians—effects on which the readers will find in this book unpublished information; beyond the admiration modern readers cannot help but feel, they who are used to the strange beauty of Julia sets, when they see Fatou and Julia invent them by hand and understand their properties without the intuition given by a computer 1 ; we shall emphasise on the quality of Pierre Fatou’s modern and open work. This is not a history of iteration (moreover, there is already such a history, that by Alexander [1994]2 , for historical comments on Julia’s works, see also Hervé’s text in [Julia 1968] and article [1981]). Our perspective here is rather on the sequel, on what happened next. It is hard for a mathematician of today to speak of Julia sets without thinking of Siegel discs, of the Mandelbrot set, of Hermann annuli and of Douady’s rabbit. It is hard to speak of the First World War without remembering that it was followed by the Second World War3 (and not only in the chronological sense). The paths followed by the mathematicians considered here collided with these wars through which they had to live. Each in its own way, all of these questions show the importance of context... This is why there are many digressions in this text. On the other hand, despite these digressions, there is a unity in the style: to give an example, we have chosen to favour quotations and examples coming from the Paris Academy of Sciences and its Comptes rendus 4 . Since the history considered here is that of 1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nAccording to John Hubbard, Lars Ahlfors told him in 1984 that Lindelöf asked him to read the papers of Fatou and Julia when he was a student... but that he only understood what was in Fatou’s and Julia’s minds when he saw the pictures that Hubbard and Mandelbrot produced (see the preface of [Tan 2000]). Although it is possible to disagree with some assessments of this book, it is nevertheless an important source of information on the history of iteration, especially before 1906. Or even by the Algerian war. Although Montel and Julia were still professionally active during this war, we will not mention it here. To read the Comptes rendus, which give an account (this is what the title means) of what happened during the sessions of the Academy of Sciences—presentation of scientific notes, election of new members, reading of obituaries on deceased members, choice of professors at the Collège de France or of astronomers at the Observatory, choice of delegates sent to such and such meeting, speeches on “politics” at the end or at the beginning of the year—is instructive and even exciting, even if, as one can imagine, not “everything” was written (the investigation of part of what was not written, at another time, is one of the subjects of our paper [2009a]). The decision made by the Academy of Sciences, a few decades ago,\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\na Prize of the Academy of Sciences, it is by no means absurd to wonder what was in the mind of the members of this assembly, in addition to science, when they assessed the works in competition. Let us now look at the contents of this book. For simplicity, it follows a more or less chronological order. The scene (subject of the Great Prize, the war, the first examples of iterated rational functions) is set, and the main characters (Fatou, Julia, Lattès, Montel and the others) are introduced in the first chapter. Then (in Chapter II), the research of Fatou, Julia, Lattès and Ritt, and that of Montel, are described, more or less day by day, as they appear in the Academy of Sciences, from Fatou’s note of May 21st 1917 to the proclamation of the Great Prize on December 2nd 1918, through Julia’s fit of anger in December 1917. The mathematical contents of the memoirs of Julia and Fatou are described (rather quickly) in Chapter III. Let me make a personal comment: before reading their papers, I tried to review all the prejudice I could have about the subject and especially against the two authors, in order to avoid letting this prejudice influence the issue of my reading of these mathematical texts; I can tell that it is indeed because it struck me, that I emphasise the quality of Fatou’s work, and especially its modernity. In the next chapter (Chapter IV), the question of the almost complete cessation, as early as in the twenties, of research on the subject, is raised. We also introduce some close relatives of the Julia set, the J-points (which probably lie at the source of the “Julia set” terminology) which appeared in a paper by Ostrowski in 1927 and which play a role in the rest of the story. As we shall see, in this story, Pierre Fatou never stops disappearing. Chapter V is dedicated to his personality and to the few things we were able to learn about his biography. In the last chapter (Chapter VI) we reproduce letters, most of which have not been previously published, sent to Paul Lévy in 1965. On the occasion of a rather late priority dispute between Montel and Julia on the question of “J-points”, we will see the criticisms made of Julia and of his attitude during the time he was working on iteration, this reproach having never been, to my knowledge, explicitly stated. We quote, here and there, some excerpts of a report by Hadamard on Fatou, and also some letters of Fatou to his friends Fréchet and especially Montel. These cuts can be frustrating, so we include these texts in their entirety and in an appendix. to let this mixture disappear will certainly be lamented by the historians who will investigate the end of the 20th century.\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nWarning A complete biography of all the protagonists will not be found in this book. This is in particular the case of that of Gaston Julia; there is some sporadic information; for more detail, see, e.g., the obituary by Garnier [1978], and also what can be deduced from the papers in Volume 6 [Julia 1970] of Julia’s complete works. An exhaustive list of his publications will not be found here either, after all, his Complete Works were published in his lifetime. In § VI.4, I mention a few reasons why it would be very hard to write a biography of Julia. The same is not true of Fatou’s Works—although the paper [Nathan 1971] that was devoted to him in the Dictionary of scientific biography announced that the French mathematical society (smf) planned to publish them (Szolem Mandelbrojt even said [Lebesgue 1991, note 358] that he was in charge of this publication). This was never done, thus posthumously confirming the underevaluation of his work that lead, in his lifetime, to Fatou’s slow and modest career. Without pretending to be exhaustive, this text is more complete regarding Fatou’s works. For the same reasons, it contains some information on his biography, some of which is new, unpublished information, obtained with the help of several members of his family (see below). Regarding the other mathematicians we shall mention, we shall provide some information about Montel, of course, but also about Picard, Siegel, Hausdorff and Garnier, which will be scattered in the text—but it is equipped with an index, which will hopefully be effective. Thus this book might contribute to a (perhaps less monolithic than usual) history of the French mathematical community in the 20th century. War dead The First World War, which is the scene of the beginning of this story, is already far enough in the past for most the witnesses to be already dead5 . But it is culturally very close to us, and it is not easy to consider it with serenity, it is not even easy to use at least some historical perspective6 . Millions of young 5\n\n6\n\nThe last two French “poilus” (hairy, French soldiers) died while I was writing this text, the last fighting Tommy died the day I began to translate it into English. This is shown by the confusion made by the French President in his speech of March 17th 2008, between the “poilus” of 1914–18 and the combatants of the Glières plateau, a centre of the French Resistance against German Occupation during WWII, who were going, they too [emphasised by me] to sacrifice their lives while proclaiming “live free or die” [allaient eux aussi faire le sacrifice de leurs vies en proclamant “vivre libres ou mourir”] (speech for the funeral of Lazare Ponticelli). One can wonder whether this absence of historical perspective is related to the present fashion in WWI “history”?\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\npeople died during this war, many of them having agreed to die for their homeland. Among those whose homeland was France, a whole generation of young scientists, who were not devoted to remaining anonymous and silent, but who did not have time to give their names to discoveries, theorems, or other mathematical objects. In respect for these millions of unknowns, I have tried to name all the ones (in general, mathematicians) whom I have met during this work. Women I am quite unhappy to say so, but this story is a story of men. However, as it is well known, one of the effects of WWI was the massive arrival of a new class of women on the job market7 . The story you are going to read is almost exclusively a masculine one— nobody thought of replacing by women the mathematicians fighting at the front or killed in war! Some wives play their anonymous and discreet role, for instance, Charles Hermite’s daughter whom the young Émile Picard married, this having probably sped up the establishment of his power over the community, and the devoted nurse who became Julia’s wife8 , who is present in the speeches and writings of [Julia 1970] (her first name never being mentioned9 ) as a wife, mother of Gaston Julia’s six sons, and she too, as a daughter, in her case, daughter of the composer Ernest Chausson. Wives and daughters, but also sisters and mothers... and even female workers! Let us quote here, for the first time, a speech of the President of the Academy of Sciences in 1915, Edmond Perrier [1915, p. 806]: Haunted by the vision of the trenches, mothers and sisters were too anxious to think of adorning themselves; the sober elegance of the almost religious dress of the nurses hardly allowed the ornaments Mimi Pinson uses for a living, and one could not expect that the lively and nimble fingers of the 7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nIt would be wrong to say, as it is often done, that “the women” arrived on the job market because men were fighting at the front. There were already many women at work long before WWI, e.g. among peasants and in the working class. In the story of Julia’s wound, there are, of course, some nurses, the one who saved him from death and was Norwegian (see the speech Julia gave at the Oslo International Congress in [Julia 1970, p. 34]) and the one whom he married, in 1918. A family (or a world) in which wives have no first names: in the biography [Gallois 1994] of the composer Ernest Chausson, two daughters in law of Marianne Chausson and Gaston Julia, Madame Marc Julia and Madame Sylvestre Julia, are thanked.\n\n6\n\nIntroduction dressmakers would courageously agree10 , as they did, to calibrate explosive shells, to fill hand grenades, or to manipulate explosives11 .\n\nWe shall nevertheless encounter a female scientist, Jeanne Lattès, the wife (and, later the widow) of Samuel Lattès, a discrete and modest scientist, inventor of an important discovery, autohistoradiography. As for Pierre Fatou, well, he was a bachelor. In his own discrete way, he nevertheless introduces (as an astronomer) a female scientist in this story, the astronomer Rose Bonnet, with whom he used to observe double stars. Let us mention also the refreshing appearance of Marguerite Borel (1883– 1969), daughter of the mathematician Paul Appell (and of a niece of Joseph Bertrand, so that she was also a relative by marriage of Hermite and Picard) and the wife of Émile Borel, a remarkable woman12 , who was, under the pen name of Camille Marbo, a recognised writer (for instance, she was awarded the Femina Prize in 1913) and whose memory book [1968] is a very lively source of information on the period 1883–1967 (which includes the periods we consider in this book). If, for reasons that would be interesting to understand, she practically does not mention Julia in this book written in 1967, she is, in one of the lyrical outbursts of a speech of the latter [1970, p. 72], the Gretchen (Marguerite) of a Faust personified by Émile Borel. Illustrations This text is about more than delightful mathematics, which has won a great aesthetic popularity over the last twenty or thirty years, but which was invented during the course of a more than serious story, millions of people killed of an atrocious war prefiguring the tens of millions killed in an even more atrocious (and abject) war, and it is about the individual destinies of the protagonists in this not so old story... It was thus desirable to keep a certain sobriety. This is why, although we shall give references to some modern texts on what are nowadays called “complex dynamical systems”, the Julia 10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nThe young dressmakers (“midinettes”) indeed accepted, courageously but also with lucidity, as the fourteen day strike they staged in the spring of 1917 shows... after which they obtained, among other things, some collective employment contracts and days off. Regarding women and the war, see the paper [Thebaud 1992]. [Hantées par la vision des tranchées les mères et les sœurs avaient trop d’angoisse au cœur pour songer à se parer; la sobre élégance du costume presque religieux des infirmières n’admettait guère les fantaisies qui font vivre Mimi Pinson, et l’on ne pouvait s’attendre à ce que les doigts alertes et légers des “midinettes” consentissent courageusement, comme ils l’ont fait, à calibrer des obus, emplir des grenades ou manipuler des explosifs.] Marguerite Borel founded, with her husband, in 1906, the Revue du mois (Journal of the month), a monthly journal that was quite successful. She was the President of the “Société des gens de lettres” (Pen club) in 1937, 1938 and 1947. She also chaired the committee of the literary Femina Prize.\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nsets, “common beauties of fashion pictures of mathematics”, and “ ‘fractals’ as ‘super-models’ of mathematics” 13 , do not proliferate in this text: this would have made it anachronistic and also too light. Sources Except in the case of unintentional omission, we quote all the sources at their right place (this is elementary rigour). Among the sources, there are mathematical papers, discourses and speeches, letters, birth and death certificates, testimonies and memories. On the history of WWI, we have quoted papers that were written for a general audience [Audoin-Rouzeau 1992 ; Becker 1992 ; Pierrard 1992 ; Thebaud 1992 ; Sirinelli 1992] and first published in the magazine l’Histoire. These papers contain detailed bibliographical references. In addition to the published texts14 that can be found in the bibliography, we have used – Julia’s sealed letters and the manuscripts of some Comptes rendus notes, from the archives of the Academy of Sciences, – the file concerning the prizes of the Academy of Sciences of 1918, – the correspondence of Julia and Fatou to Borel, from the Borel collection, that of Fatou and Lebesgue to Montel from the Montel collection (72J) and that of Fatou to Fréchet from the Fréchet collection in these archives, – again from these archives, the biographical files of some of the mathematicians we discuss in this text (in these files, one can find, among other things, Fatou’s notices, a hand-written report by Hadamard that we shall quote several times (and reproduce in full in an appendix), the letters of Picard which we shall quote15 in Chapter V) and some information from the Villat collection (61J), – the register of secret committees16 in the archives of the Academy of Sciences, – the administrative archives of the Henri Poincaré Institute, – the Paul Lévy file at the Chevaleret library, – the annual reports of the Observatory (kept at the library of the Paris Observatory), – the archives of the Collège Stanislas, – the personal archives of some members of Pierre Fatou’s family, 13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n[“beautés banales des gravures de mode de la mathématique”, les “fractales” comme “top-models” de la mathématique” [Roubaud 1997, p. 135]] Among the published texts, there are several papers that appeared in the Cahiers du séminaire d’histoire des mathématiques, a very rich publication, the disappearance of which may be deplored. As a rule, in this book, when we quote an unpublished document, we give a precise reference in the text or in a footnote. The Academicians met in public sessions, then in camera, namely in non-public meetings. Reports of these meetings are kept in a register.\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\n– the Bourbaki archives, digitised by the Archives Henri Poincaré and on-line at http://math-doc.ujf-grenoble.fr/archives-bourbaki – the files and the archives of the library of irma, – the database “memory of men” [mémoire des hommes] of the French Ministry of Defence, that contains more than 1.3 million records of people who “died for France” during WWI (http://www.memoiredeshommes.sga. defense.gouv.fr). Dates of birth and death given in this text come from reliable sources (encyclopaedias, the website http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/ ~history/ of St-Andrews for most of the mathematicians, a dictionary [Véron 2004] for the astronomers, the yearbook of the association of former students of the ens...). I am solely responsible for the errors that remain. In a few cases however, I was not able to find this information (I have replaced it by an “XX”), in some other cases, I have given approximate data (an approximate date comes with a “c.” (for “circa”)). The information on Paul Flamant was given to me by Jean Cerf (I have used it already in [Audin 2009b]), it complements the article [Sartre 1948]. Most of the unpublished biographical and personal information on Pierre Fatou was given to me by members of his family: one day, I sent a letter to twenty-two people with the name Fatou and living in Brittany or in the Paris region whom I found in the telephone directory. By the following day, I had already spoken with four cousins or great-nephews of Pierre Fatou, and they had already told me everything they knew about “Pierre Fatou the astronomer”, as he is called in the family, and they put me in contact with other cousins. They all soon sent me copies of all the documents they had. Other information comes from the registry offices of the towns of Pornichet and Lorient. Credit for photos – The photo of the family of Pierre Fatou that is reproduced on page 137 belongs to Madame Gladys Sérieyx, that of Pierre Fatou at the Collège Stanislas (page 139) belongs to the archives of the Collège Stanislas, that of the young Pierre Fatou on page 149 belongs to Monsieur Henry Fatou. The photo of the astronomers taken at the time of the transit of Mercury (figures V.1 and V.2) belongs to the Paris Observatory. – The portrait of Felix Hausdorff (page 117), was published in his Works, and is reproduced here with the kind permission of the Hausdorff edition. – The photo of Gaston Julia and Charles de la Vallée Poussin in Ravenna (page 210) comes from the photo album of George Pólya [Alexanderson 1987]. – The photo of Samuel Lattès on page 82 belongs to the Academy of Sciences, inscriptions and literature of Toulouse. – The portrait of Paul Lévy (page 215) was published in his Complete Works.\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nI myself took the other photos. Nevertheless, the rights of the documents on pages 98, 110, 258 and 276 belong to the Academy of Sciences. For the English edition The main additions for this edition are the two (unpublished) letters written by Montel and Lebesgue to Élie Cartan just before Julia’s election to the Academy of Sciences. I found these two letters while helping the Cartan family to sort out the letters received by Élie and Henri Cartan during the 20th century. They confirm and enlighten the analysis made here and I am grateful to the Cartan family for the authorisation to publish them. I translated the text myself, but the result was in need of careful editing. This was carried out by Ruth Preater and John Preater, to whom I am most grateful. I am of course responsible for any remaining errors. Thanks I thank: firstly, the institutions: – the town archives service of Lorient for the birth certificate of Pierre Fatou and the information on Florian La Porte, – the registry office of the town hall of Pornichet for the death certificate of Pierre Fatou, – the Collège Stanislas for the information on Pierre Fatou and Désiré André, the digitisation of and the permission to publish the photo on page 139, – the library of the Paris Observatory for the permission to look at the annual reports and the inventory books, – the libraries of irma (Institut de recherche mathématique avancée at Strasbourg), of Chevaleret (Bibliothèque interuniversitaire scientifique Jussieu, mathématiques recherche), of the École normale supérieure and of the Henri Poincaré Institute for all I learned there, – the Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach for having conveniently organised an Arbeitsgemeinschaft on “positive measure Julia sets” in March-April 2008, – and above all the archives service of the Academy of Sciences for its reception of me, and especially its curator Florence Greffe for having, in MarchApril 2008, filed and made an inventory of Paul Montel’s correspondence, for having created the Paul Montel collection, and for having given me the permission to publish the picture in Figure III.1, the letters from Fatou to Montel and Fréchet and Hadamard’s report, ? then, Pierre Fatou’s family, namely\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\n– his great-nephew Henry Fatou for the photos, the text written by his father, and for the humorous encouragement he sent me, – his cousins – Admiral Alain Fatou for the documents he collected around 1992 and that he sent me, – Anny Fatou for the family tree of the Fatou family, – Gladys Sérieyx, for the photos and other documents she sent me, – Hélène Fatou, for the connections she made between her family and me, and for the suggestions she made, – Michel Fatou, for the oral memories he collected among other cousins and which he passed on to me, ? and also, the four anonymous referees, who read a preliminary version of this text for Springer, for all their suggestions and their constructive criticism. ? and lastly – David Aubin, historian of mathematics, for his knowledge of the history of the observatories, for the references he sent me on Pierre Fatou and for the hints he gave me on the research on ballistics mentioned in Chapter I, – June Barrow-Green, historian of mathematics, for the reference to her paper [2008] on British mathematicians, – Xavier Buff, Arnaud Chéritat and all the participants in the Arbeitsgemeinschaft, for the help they gave me in understanding the mathematics of the subject, and again – Xavier Buff for his careful reading of a preliminary version of this text, for the innumerable corrections and mathematical refinements he suggested to me—thanks to which there are perhaps not too many mathematical mistakes in this version (I am of course solely responsible for those which, unavoidably, remain)—and for the references that motivated Remark IV.5.1, – Arnaud Chéritat for the pictures of Julia sets he produced (at my request), which he sent me, and which that I used to illustrate this book (Figures I.2, I.4, II.1, III.2, that in Note 45 of Chapter III, Figure IV.1 and all the components of Figure IV.217 )18 and, above all, Figure IV.4, – Dominique Dartron, librarian, for his help with the archives at Henri Poincaré Institute (ihp), – Suzanne Débarbat, astronomer and historian, for the information on the Observatory she gave to Alain Fatou in 1992–93, for the invitation to the 17 18\n\nWhich I made for a talk at the Arbeitsgemeinschaft. Each of these figures took him only ten minutes (this is what he said)... until I asked him to also produce Figure IV.4, which took him a long day of work, one of the reasons being that he had to first compute the exact positions of the five white circles in the figure.\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nObservatory in December 2007, the introduction to the library there, and for all the information she provided, – Maurice Galeski, librarian, for the invaluable information he gave me on the history of the library at the Centre international de rencontres mathématiques (cirm) and especially, for what we are interested in here, on the Gaston Julia collection of this library, – Étienne Ghys because he mentioned the paper [Garnier 1954], – Catherine Goldstein, historian and mathematician, for numerous discussions, for her rigour, for the documents she showed me, for all the information she gave me and for all the help she provided, of which these few lines cannot give any idea, – Nathalie Granottier, librarian, for her help with the early collections of the library at cirm, – Jeremy Gray, historian of mathematics, for his comments and suggestions after reading a first version of this text, – Tara Holm for her help in finding the English translation of Under Fire used here, – Jean-Pierre Kahane for a discussion at the very beginning of this work, – Nicolas Lecervoisier, in charge of archives at the Collège Stanislas, for his search concerning Pierre Fatou and Désiré André, at my request, in his archives, for his reception of me and for the guided tour of the Collège, – Juliette Leloup, historian of mathematics, for her help with the theses we mention in this book, and especially for the reports on Gaston Julia’s thesis, – Odile Luguern, librarian, for her help in searching the “Fatou donation” in the library at the ens, – Philippe Maisonobe, mathematician from Nice, for having sent me a copy of the book [MathNiçois 1966], – Doctor Pierre Marinelli for the posthumous consultation of Pierre Fatou, – Frédéric Paulin for the information on the Ahlfors conjecture, – Jacques Roubaud for a useful conversation, – Claude Sabbah, for his TEXnical help, – Arnaud Saint-Martin, sociologist and historian, for having sent me his thesis [2008], for his kind answers to my questions, and for the comments he sent me on a preliminary version of the chapter on Pierre Fatou, – Norbert Schappacher, historian and mathematician, for many conversations, – Marie-Hélène Schwartz and Claudine Schwartz for the permission to publish the letters sent to (their father and grand-father) Paul Lévy, – Norbert Steinmetz for Figure III.4, coming from his book [1993], – Philippe Véron, astronomer and historian, for having sent me (on a cd) his unpublished dictionary [2004] of astronomers, – Brigitte Yvon-Deyme, librarian, for having shown me the registers of the library at ihp,\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\n– Liliane Zweig, librarian, for her reception of me at the library of Chevaleret. ? While I was writing this text, I read (or reread) The Shell Shard, All Quiet on the Western Front, Under Fire, Storm of Steel, The Bells of Basel, Wooden Crosses, Calligrammes and Poems to Lou, The Acacia... It would be surprising if none of these readings [Leblanc 1916 ; Remarque 1928 ; Barbusse 1916 ; Jünger 1920 ; Aragon 1934 ; Dorgelès 1919 ; Apollinaire 1980 ; Simon 1989] had left a trace in this work. It is thus fair to thank the authors.\n\nI The Great Prize, the framework\n\nBertinck has a chest wound. After a while a fragment smashes away his chin, and the same fragment has sufficient force to tear open Leer’s hip. Leer groans as he supports himself on his arm, he bleeds quickly, no one can help him. Like an emptying tube, after a couple of minutes, he collapses. What use is it to him now that he was such a good mathematician at school? Erich Maria Remarque, All Quiet on the Western Front [1928]\n\nIn this chapter, we describe the setting for the beginning of our story: the topic of the Great Prize of mathematical sciences, the historical context in mathematics and the historical context in general, namely the First World War. After a quick introduction of the various characters and of their roles, we establish some notation and give the first pertinent examples of the mathematical question under consideration, that is, the iteration of rational functions, setting it as it was when the story began.\n\nI.1 The iteration problem in 1915 In 1915, The Paris Academy of Sciences announced that it would award in 1918 a “Great Prize of mathematical sciences”. This was a prize, financed by the French State, of 3 ,000 Francs. The topic was published on December 27th , 1915 in [Académie 1915, p. 921], and was presented as follows: The iteration of a substitution with one or several variables, namely, the construction of a system of successive points P1 , P2 , . . . , Pn , . . . , each of them being deduced from the previous one by the same operation: Pn = ϕ(Pn−1 )\n\n(n = 1, 2, . . . , ∞)\n\n(where ϕ depends rationally, say, on the point Pn−1 ) and such that the first point P0 is also given, appears in several classical theories and in some of the most famous papers of Poincaré. M. Audin, Fatou, Julia, Montel: The Great Prize of Mathematical Sciences of 1918, and Beyond, Lecture Notes in Mathematics 2014, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-17854-2_2, © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011\n\n13\n\n14\n\nI The Great Prize, the framework Up to now, the well known works devoted to this investigation are mainly about the “local” point of view. The Academy considers that it would be interesting to proceed from here to the examination of the whole domain of the values taken by the variables. In this spirit, it opens a competition, for the year 1918, on the following question: To improve in an important point the investigation of the successive powers of a same substitution, the exponent in the power increasing indefinitely. One will consider the effect of the choice of the initial element P0 , the substitution being given, and it will be possible to limit the investigation to the simplest cases, such as that of rational substitutions of one variable.1\n\nIt would be interesting to know exactly how and why this topic was chosen. We know that some of the Academicians thought initially of another 1\n\nL’itération d’une substitution à une ou plusieurs variables, c’est-à-dire la construction d’un système de points successifs P1 , P2 , . . . , Pn , . . . , dont chacun se déduit du précédent par une même opération donnée: Pn = ϕ(Pn−1 )\n\n(n = 1, 2, . . . , ∞)\n\n(ϕ dépendant rationnellement, par exemple, du point Pn−1 ) et dont le premier P0 est également donné, intervient dans plusieurs théories classiques et dans quelques-uns des plus célèbres Mémoires de Poincaré. Jusqu’ici les travaux bien connus consacrés à cette étude concernent surtout le point de vue “local”. L’Académie estime qu’il y aurait intérêt à passer de là à l’examen du domaine entier des valeurs que peuvent prendre les variables. Dans cet esprit, elle met au concours, pour l’année 1918, la question suivante: Perfectionner en un point important l’étude des puissances successives d’une même substitution, l’exposant de la puissance augmentant indéfiniment. On considérera l’influence du choix de l’élément initial P0 , la substitution étant donnée, et l’on pourra se borner aux cas les plus simples, tels que les substitutions rationnelles à une variable.\n\nI.1 The iteration problem in 1915\n\n15\n\nsubject, nothing less than Fermat’s Theorem2 , before they chose iteration. It had happened before, and was even a common practice, that a prize topic was announced because it was known that such and such a mathematician had made great progress on this topic3 . This was apparently not the case here, where it seems, on the contrary, that the Prize itself would stimulate new research in the field. It is however possible that one of the Academicians, for instance Hadamard, thought of Fatou’s note [Fatou 1906d] and of the fact that the latter had done further work on the topic (without writing it up) , when declaring the subject (see the excerpt of the letter quoted on page 18). The allusion to Poincaré might come from the same source: “as everybody”, Hadamard admired Poincaré a lot, but he himself organised a seminar on his work in 1913 and should have known this work quite well4 . The fact (note 2) that Darboux, Jordan and Picard thought of proposing Fermat’s theorem is a hint that none of the three was at the source of the actual subject. Note that, in the statement of the subject, the question is on iteration per se (in modern and anachronistic terms, on dynamics): mathematicians had iterates for a very long time, for instance in order to find approximate solutions of algebraic equations, and more than one of them had carried out 2\n\nA little note, signed Darboux, Jordan and Picard, Prizes file, archives of the Academy of Sciences, reads: The Academy of Sciences opens a competition on the proof of the celebrated theorem of Fermat about the impossibility of the equation xn + y n = z n . We are mostly looking forward to progress in number theory that could lead to this proof. We cannot resist saying here that, a few years later, on September 19th 1923, in a letter to Pierre Gauja, the “secretary-archivist” of the Academy of Sciences, Picard asked Gauja to write to a correspondent that the Academy never declared a competition on this question [Fermat’s Theorem], if this is indeed the case [que l’Académie n’a jamais mis la question [le théorème de Fermat] au concours, si toutefois il en est bien ainsi]\n\n3\n\n4\n\n(Picard file, archives of the Academy of Sciences). Among the most famous examples, are that of the Bordin Prize of 1888, for the progress made by Sophie Kowalevski on the question of the rigid body (see [Audin 2008]), and that of the Great Prize of mathematical sciences, which was declared at the end of 1890 because Stieltjes thought he had a proof of the Riemann hypothesis (and which was eventually awarded to Hadamard). For a concise but efficient history of the mathematical prizes, see [Gray 2006]. Note besides that Hadamard was the author of the paper [Hadamard 1921] on Poincaré’s mathematical work that would be published by Acta Mathematica in its special issue of 1921.\n\n16\n\nI The Great Prize, the framework\n\nsuch an activity5 . One of the most interesting aspects of the subject was the global, “general”, as they said at that time, nature of the expected research. Let us quote now, to whet the appetite, the start of the report [Académie 1918, p. 811] written by Émile Picard and Georges Humbert6 for the award ceremony of the Prize in 1918. They mentioned the history of the subject and clarified, for instance, the allusion to Poincaré’s works7 : The Academy declared a competition on the investigation of the iteration of a substitution, recalling that only the local point of view had been considered until then and it invited the competitors to take a general point of view. Previous work, especially the fundamental works of M. Kœnigs, for a substitution S, z1 = ϕ(z) of one variable, led to the notion of points of attraction: if ζ is a point that is fixed under S or one of its powers (an invariant point), and if a corresponding quantity, called the multiplier 8 , has absolute value less than unity, all the successive transforms (consequents 9 ) of a point z, taken in a neighbourhood of ζ, tend to ζ or periodically tend to p points, one of which is ζ and the others its first (p − 1) consequents. These initial results raised many problems: are the attracting points of limited number; what exactly is the domain of attraction of one of them; what division of the plane is associated with a given function ϕ(z)? On these fundamental questions, we had only a Note of M. Fatou (October 1906), where the author showed that, in some examples, it could happen 5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nTo give a flavour of this: the “Newton method” is, according to Cajori [1893, p. 363–366], due to Raphson, so that he calls it the “Newton-Raphson method”; as for Cayley, whom we shall have the opportunity to meet again, he calls this same method the “Newton-Fourier method”. Newton, Raphson, Fourier, one could even add two pages by Galois [1962, p. 379], following an Appendix in Legendre’s book on number theory [1955, Appendice, Section I] (see also [Galuzzi 2001])... but let’s remain serious. See [Alexander 1994] for a prehistory of the subject, from Newton’s method to what we are discussing here. Georges Humbert (1859–1921), a member of the Academy of Sciences from 1901, plays an important supporting role in our story and in Gaston Julia’s life. We shall see him settle the argument in a priority quarrel (below, in December 1917). Let us point out also that he, together with Painlevé, would back Julia in his election as a member of the French Mathematical Society (smf) on March 13th 1919. Julia would participate in the publication of Humbert’s Works, with Pierre Humbert (1891–1953), the son of Georges Humbert and a mathematical contemporary of Julia. See also Note 23 in Chapter II. It seems clear that the Academy of Sciences makes no connection with Poincaré’s work on Kleinian groups, which we shall have the opportunity to mention again (see Note 14 and § IV.5.b), and this despite the fact that Fatou had noticed, as early as 1906, the analogy with automorphic forms [Fatou 1906d]. The definition of the word multiplier, together with other useful definitions, can be found in § I.4. The beautiful word consequent (conséquent in French), which our protagonists will use quite a lot, deserves to be defined: the consequents of a point z are its successive images zn = Rn (z) (n ≥ 1), its iterates.\n\nI.1 The iteration problem in 1915\n\n17\n\nthat the regions of the division are bounded by non-analytic curves, thus highlighting the difficulty and the complexity of the question. Finally, from another point of view, Poincaré had established that, in certain cases, it is possible to associate with S a function θ(u), meromorphic in the whole plane, such that, if one puts z = θ(u), one has z1 = θ(su), s being a constant of absolute value greater than 1, thus reducing the study of the iteration to that of θ(u); but no application was made of this parametric iteration method10 .\n\nThe Note [Fatou 1906d] It seems that the only global work that had been undertaken in this field before the publication of the Prize topic was indeed Pierre Fatou’s note [1906d]. Nobody had dared to tackle the question in the whole plane when, in 1906, in a short Comptes rendus note, M. Fatou, giving the example of the extraordinary results met, showed at once the interest and the high difficulty of doing so,\n\nHadamard would comment in 1921 in a report that we shall have the opportunity to quote several times11 . In this note, Fatou investigated the rational 10\n\n11\n\nL’Académie avait mis au concours l’étude de l’itération d’une substitution, en rappelant que le point de vue local avait seul été considéré jusqu’alors et en invitant les concurrents à se placer d’un point de vue général.

Kœnigs, avaient, pour une substitution S, z1 = ϕ(z), à une variable, conduit à la notion des points d’attraction: si ζ est un point laissé fixe par S ou par une de ses puissances (point invariant), et si une quantité correspondante, dite multiplicateur , est de module inférieur à l’unité, les transformés successifs (conséquents) d’un point z, pris au voisinage de ζ, tendent tous vers ζ, ou tendent périodiquement vers p points, dont l’un est ζ, et dont les autres sont ses (p − 1) premiers conséquents. Ces résultats initiaux soulevaient bien des problèmes: les points attractifs sontils en nombre limité; quel est le domaine exact d’attraction de l’un d’eux; quelle division du plan est ainsi associée à une fonction ϕ(z) donnée? Sur ces questions fondamentales, on ne possédait qu’une Note de M. Fatou (octobre 1906), où l’auteur montrait, sur des exemples, que les régions de la division pouvaient être limitées par des courbes non analytiques, mettant ainsi en évidence les difficultés et la complexité de la question. Enfin, à un autre point de vue, Poincaré avait établi que, dans certains cas, on peut associer à S une fonction méromorphe dans tout le plan, θ(u) telle que, si l’on pose z = θ(u), on ait z1 = θ(su), s étant une constante de module supérieur à 1, ce qui ramène l’étude de l’itération à celle de θ(u); mais aucune application n’avait été faite de cette méthode d’itération paramétrique. Hand-written report, July 4th 1921, Fatou file, archives of the Academy of Sciences. The unabridged text (together with the French original) can be found in the Appendix at the end of this book.\n\n18\n\nI The Great Prize, the framework\n\nmaps the unique attracting12 orbit of which is a fixed point. Despite the attention directed to functional equations, the questions Fatou raised are stated in dynamical terms: an attracting fixed point attracts a whole neighbourhood; what do the boundaries of these various convergence domains look like? He proves (with some additional assumptions) that the iterates of a rational function with a unique fixed point converge to this point... except on a set, which he denotes by E and of which he proves that it is totally discontinuous (i.e. its connected components are points) and perfect (i.e. it is closed and without isolated points). See, more precisely, Example I.4.2 below. In addition to being the first global result, it seems that this is also one of the first times that what we now call general topology was used in the iteration problem. Fatou also considered, in the second part of this note, the case where the rational function has several limit points, and proved that the lines between their convergence domains are not, in general, analytic, proving that this is the case for R(z) = (z 2 + z)/2 (see Example I.4.3 below). Fatou did continue to work on the subject, as he wrote in a letter to Fréchet on February 10th 1907: [...] I have undertaken more extensive research on iteration; but I lack the energy to write it all up [...]\n\n(see the complete letter and the French original on page 256)—given the very close relationship between Fréchet and Hadamard, it is very probable that the latter was aware of this. Digression (on general topology). What we today call “general topology” arose from a part of “set theory” 13 or “point set theory”—Mengenlehre, since 12\n\n13\n\nThe word “attracting” did not exist in 1906, neither did it exist when the Prize was declared. But it was used in the report on the Prize: we shall see an efficient terminology being set up as the work on the subject progresses (see page 78). We remind ourselves of the definition in § I.4. Regarding set theory in France at that time, see the very interesting paper [Gispert 1995].\n\nI.1 The iteration problem in 1915\n\n19\n\nthis theory was invented in Germany and in German14 : the paternity of Cantor is generally acknowledged. Even if the term did not yet exist, general topology was used in analysis, even in France, at least since the work of Poincaré, then Borel15 . The impression produced on us by the articles of M. Cantor is appalling; to read them seems to all of us a genuine torture, and while we pay tribute to his merit, while we recognise that he has opened a new field of research, none of us is tempted to follow him16 ,\n\nHermite had written [Dugac 1985, p. 209], but this was already very old (1883). Let us mention for instance, the Borel-Lebesgue theorem, which was called “a lemma in set theory” (in particular in [Julia 1918f]). The work of Borel, Baire and Lebesgue uses set theory quite a lot. Since we have not much space here for that, we direct the reader, for a more detailed history, to Taylor’s papers [1982 ; 1985] on Fréchet, to the introduction [Purkert 2002] to the edition of the book [Hausdorff 1914] contained in the complete Works [Hausdorff 2002], and to [James 1999]. It was Bourbaki who, much later, would make the separation between set theory (cardinals, and so on) and general topology17 . Among the books devoted to this theory, let us quote here those of Borel [1898] and Baire [1905], then that of Grace Chisholm Young and her husband [1906], written with the blessing of Cantor himself (see the letter Cantor wrote to Grace Chisholm that can be found in the 1972 Chelsea edition of that book), and that of Schoenflies [1913]. There was also a book by Sierpinski, in Polish, a part of which was translated into French, but only in 1928. 14\n\nIt should be noticed that, the same year, Mittag-Leffler published in “his” journal French translations of some of Cantor’s papers (among which [1884]) and the article of Poincaré on Kleinian groups, in which the latter writes [1883, p. 78]: The vertices of various polygons R form eine undendliche Punktmenge P and, to get the line L, we must add to this Punktmenge its erste Ableitung P 0 . One sees that the line L is eine perfekte und zusammenhängende Punktmenge. It is in this sense that it is a line. [Les sommets de divers polygones R forment eine undendliche Punktmenge P et pour obtenir la ligne L, il faut ajouter à cette Punktmenge son erste Ableitung P 0 . On voit que la ligne L est eine perfekte und zusammenhängende Punktmenge. C’est en ce sens que c’est une ligne.]\n\n15 16\n\n17\n\nA passage which shows that the terminology (derived, perfect, connected) existed only in German... and the subject of which is not unrelated to that of this book, so that it deserves to be quoted here (see also § IV.5.b). See his book [Borel 1898]. L’impression que nous produisent les mémoires de M. Cantor est désolante; leur lecture nous semble à tous un véritable supplice, et en rendant hommage à son mérite, en reconnaissant qu’il a ouvert comme un nouveau champ de recherches, personne de nous n’est tenté de le suivre. In 1965, Denjoy [1980] would complain that the students who learned under Bourbaki hardly knew the notions of power, order, and transfinite.\n\n20\n\nI The Great Prize, the framework\n\nNeither the notion of metric space, nor, a fortiori, that of topological space, appear in these books that are, indeed, books on set theory—in which powers and cardinals are important. The notions of derived set (due to Cantor under the name of Ableitung), of perfect set and of boundary are set out. It seems that in France, the analysis course of Jordan at École polytechnique (at least its second edition [1893]) played an important role in the popularisation of this subject among young mathematicians (this book was used by the generations of Lebesgue, Baire, Fatou... and at least until the thirties). It was essential to understanding measure theory and the Lebesgue integral. This is what one of our protagonists, Pierre Fatou, said, at the very beginning of his thesis [1906c, p. 335]: The problem of the measure of sets was first tackled by M. G. Cantor; his definitions were clarified by M. Jordan in his course on analysis; but it is M. E. Borel [...]18\n\nIn this book by Jordan, one finds the word “écart” (gap), that Fréchet would still use and that would become, with Hausdorff, our “distance” 19 . The courses given by Borel at ens from the spring of 1897 also played a not insignificant role. About Borel again: his series Collection de monographies sur la théorie des fonctions published by Gauthier-Villars had a notable effect on the spreading of what would become general topology. Let us mention also the article of Zoretti [1912], under the influence of Borel (whose Peccot course of 1901–1902 on meromorphic functions he transcribed), in the Encyclopédie des sciences mathématiques 20 —and in which he introduces the measure theory of Borel and Lebesgue. It is worth noticing that the original German edition has no article on this subject: – there is an article (by Schoenflies) on set theory in Volume I (arithmetic), the French version of which was published in 1909 and adapted by Baire, but this is devoted more to cardinals and ordinals than to point sets, – there is an article by Dehn and Heegaard on the Analysis situs in Volume III (geometry), which is more on “geometry of situation” than on general 18\n\n19 20\n\nLe problème de la mesure des ensembles a été abordé pour la première fois par M. G. Cantor; ses définitions ont été précisées par M. Jordan dans son cours d’analyse; mais c’est M. E. Borel [...] Regarding Jordan’s analysis course, see also [Gispert 1983]. This is the French edition, “written and published following the German edition under the direction of Jules Molk” of the Encyclopädie der Mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschuss ihrer Anwendungen, Herausgegeben im Auftrage (under the auspices) des Akademien des Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, Leipzig, München und Wien, so wie unter Mitwirkung zahlreicher Fachgenossen (with the collaboration of numerous scientists), started under the direction of Felix Klein, planned as an international collaboration... the French edition has been the only non-German edition to appear, before it stopped for good in 1916, because of the war. An example of international co-operation that was interrupted, brutally and for a long time.\n\nI.1 The iteration problem in 1915\n\n21\n\ntopology—it seems to me that this paper had no analogue in the French version. The additional chapter that contains Zoretti’s paper is inserted between the adaptations of that of Pringsheim (on the fundamental principles of function theory) and that of Voss (on differential calculus). Slightly biased (!) information on the organisation of the writing of this encyclopaedia can be found in [Lebesgue 1991]. Baire also was asked by Molk to contribute. In a letter to Borel [1990], he complains he must read some spiels of Hausdorff to which the Germans attach such great importance21 .\n\nIf I am not mistaken, Lebesgue did not contribute to this work. Besides, the book which is now considered as the first “true” topology book would be written by a German mathematician, namely Felix Hausdorff [1914] (and he would dedicate it to Georg Cantor, “creator of set theory”). The title is still Grundzüge der Mengenlehre (foundations of set theory). Of course, and even if he amply quotes Borel and even Baire, this book, which appeared in Germany in 1914, was not used in France at the time we are interested in: we shall see that the war would interrupt, for a long time, all communication between French and German mathematicians22 . On the reception and the use of Hausdoff’s work, see also § IV.2. Hausdorff also mentioned the words “Analysis situs” (Latin root, as in the famous paper of Poincaré and in its no less famous supplements, and as in the chapter by Dehn and Heegaard cited above) and “Topologie” (Greek root23 ), neither of the two having already been adopted. The first one would become, more or less, algebraic topology, the second would have to take on the adjective “general” before it would replace “point sets” 24 . ? As this digression shows, the beginning of the 20th century is not a kind of appendix to a 19th century which would never finally terminate. The period 21 22\n\n23\n\n24\n\ncertains topos de Hausdorff dont les Allemands font le plus grand cas. Also note that the Borel series Collection de monographies has no German contributor. It seems that the word “Topologie” was first used (at least first published) as early as in 1847 by the German mathematician Johann Benedict Listing [1847]. See a reproduction of its front page in [James 1999]. The terminology “ensembles de points” has completely disappeared from French today, but the English point set topology persists in being synonymous with general topology.\n\n22\n\nI The Great Prize, the framework\n\njust before the war was indeed, in mathematics as well25 , the beginning of a modern time, which war and its consequences would retard.\n\nI.2 The protagonists around 1917–1918 The main people working on iteration between 1915 and 1918 were, in alphabetical order, Pierre Fatou (1878–1929), Gaston Julia (1893–1978) and Samuel Lattès (1873–1918), and also, as we shall see, the American mathematician Joseph Fels Ritt (1893–1951). The work of Fatou and Julia would make great use of the notion of normal family, due to Paul Montel (1876–1975). Here are a few words on these protagonists at that time, again in alphabetical order. Pierre Fatou Born in 1878 in Lorient (in Brittany), he entered the ens in 1898, graduated in 1901, became assistant-astronomer (“astronome-adjoint”) at the Paris Observatory, and passed his thesis in 1907. Of this thesis, he “often talked” with Henri Lebesgue [Lebesgue 1991, p. 112] (so that it is not surprising that he left his name to a lemma in integration theory). He was promoted to astronomer (permanent) in 1928 and died the following year. See Chapter V for portraits and for more information on his life and his work. Gaston Julia Born in 1893 in Sidi Bel Abbès, in Algeria, he entered (as the top-student) the ens in 1911 (he was also ranked first at the École polytechnique) after only one year of preparation (while it usually takes two) at the lycée Janson de Sailly, and graduated in 1914. He was severely injured in the face (his nose was obliterated, his jaw was smashed) at “Chemin des Dames” 26 in 1915, had to undergo numerous operations (he was a “gueule cassée” (broken face), and would wear for the rest of his life a leather mask27 ). He passed his thesis in 1917 (this was on a different subject, the theory of forms, see page 6428 ), he was rewarded with the Bordin Prize of the Academy of Sciences and began to 25\n\n26\n\n27 28\n\nThis is here an allusion to the modernity, for instance of a Picasso, a Schönberg or an Apollinaire. Thinking of the modernist mathematicians of the beginning of the 20th century, Borel, Baire, Lebesgue and Fatou, for instance, we quoted, as an opening to this book, another who was wounded in the head in the 1914–18 war, “trepanned under chloroform”, and who was, indeed, a modernist. Several battles took place at Chemin des Dames (not far from Soissons, 150 km northeast of Paris), the most bloody of which was that of April 1917. There is a (later) photograph of Julia on page 210. The first paper published by Julia [1913] is called “On the singular lines of some analytical functions” [Sur les lignes singulières de certaines fonctions analytiques]. It appeared in Volume 41 of the Bulletin of the smf... in the same volume two\n\nI.2 The protagonists around 1917–1918\n\n23\n\nwork on the topic of the Prize we are discussing here. See Chapter VI to find out what happened next. Samuel Lattès Born in Nice in 1873, he entered the ens in 1892 after only one year of preparation in Marseilles, graduated in 1895, defended his thesis in 1906, was professor at Toulouse University from 1911, died from typhoid fever during the summer of 1918. Regarding his work and his life, see Note 60 in this chapter, and Chapter II (where there is a photograph of Samuel Lattès), especially Note 65 and the references given there. Paul Montel Born in 1876, also in Nice, he entered the ens in 1894, graduated in 1897, he liked to travel and to teach29 , he took his time before working on a thesis30 , passed it in 1907, taught in secondary schools then, from 1911, at the University of Paris. He was awarded the Gustave Roux Prize by the Academy of Sciences in 1913. He would die as an almost hundred-year-old, but we shall speak of him again (in Chapter VI). More precise biographic information can be found in the papers [Cassin 1966 ; Beer 1966]. As the readers will certainly have noticed, all the protagonists of this story, the son of a mechanic from Algeria (Julia), the sons of a photographer and a shopkeeper in Nice (Montel and Lattès), and the son of a Breton sailor as well (Fatou), all received the same scientific education, through preparatory classes and the École normale supérieure. We could think that they acquired the same knowledge, a common corpus—notice however that neither Lattès nor Montel benefitted from the courses of Borel at the École normale supérieure. Digression (Reports on the theses). The reports on the theses of our protagonists (except for that of Julia, which was defended too late and of which we shall speak again in the next chapter) can be found in [Gispert 1991]: written by Painlevé on Fatou on p. 397 and Montel on p. 399, and by Hadamard on Lattès on p. 396 (Lattès’ thesis was called “On the functional equations that define a curve or a surface that is invariant under a transformation” [Sur les équations fonctionnelles qui définissent une courbe ou une surface invariante par une transformation]).\n\n29\n\n30\n\npapers of Fatou [1913a ; 1913d] appeared a well, the title of one of them being “On the singular lines of analytic functions” [Sur les lignes singulières des fonctions analytiques]. The similarity between the titles is, taking the rest of the story into account, rather surprising, but it conceals deep differences: Julia was twenty and produced a classical work on complex analysis, as for Fatou, he proceeded in his using the Lebesgue integral. One of his pupils in Poitiers in 1898 was Raoul Dautry, who became a politician and with whom he kept good relations for the rest of his life. At the instigation of the historian Albert Mathiez, his fellow student at the ens.\n\n24\n\nI The Great Prize, the framework\n\nI.3 The war The First World War has already made an appearance in this text, when we discussed the references on general topology. And indeed, this story takes place during the final two years of a war which was an absolute slaughter: it killed eight million people and produced six million disabled people, among whom were 1,400,000 French victims, that is, approximately one tenth of the male working population, and almost as many disabled, among whom were numerous “broken faces”. France sent its elite to the front line. The students of the French “grandes écoles” were most often in the infantry, in general with the rank of second lieutenant, a rank that put them at the head of their soldiers so that they were especially vulnerable. Both Gaston Julia and René Gateaux (of whom we shall speak more below) were infantry second lieutenants, the first in the 34th and the second in the 69th regiment. This was an effect of a 1905 law, called “the two year law” 31 . This “egalitarian” French policy had deeply unequal effects. If the proportion of mobilised soldiers who were killed was a dreadful 16,8%, this proportion was 30% for the infantry officers and 41% for the students of the ens (figures given in [Audoin-Rouzeau 1992 ; Becker 1992]). It was also reckoned that 40% of the students who had registered at a French university in 1914 were killed or mutilated (figure from [Beaulieu 1990, p. 41]). The other warring countries had different policies. This does not mean that the young German intellectuals were not called up, nor does this mean that they did not enlist. For instance, Richard Courant was wounded in the trenches [Reid 1976]32 , Max Dehn enlisted and was in the war from 1915 to 1918, Heinz Hopf enlisted as well, was in the war as a lieutenant on the western front and was wounded twice, Emil Artin was enlisted in the Austrian army33 (see also the examples of Siegel and Hasse on page 126), the narrator of All Quiet on the Western Front [Remarque 1928] was also a student. Let us mention also, briefly, the British case. The army engaged by the United Kingdom in the war was at first a professional one. It then called for volunteers. The first wave of conscription began after the Military Service Act of January 1916: single men from 18 to 41 were enlisted. This was of course 31\n\n32\n\n33\n\nDespite strong opposition from the socialists, the two year law was replaced, in July 1913, by a “three year law”, which announced the forthcoming war and which modified the duration of military service and the age of call-up (20 instead of 21), but which did not modify the status of the students of the grandes écoles. See the same book, pages 47–49, for information and comments on the mobilisation in Göttingen at the beginning of the war. Max Dehn was rewarded by the Ehrenkreuz, a military decoration, but this did not prevent him in 1935 from having to leave, first his position at Frankfort, then Germany. See [Burde et al. 2002 ; Siegel 1978]. As for Artin, who was a teenager when he was enlisted, it was Hamburg that he would have to leave in 1937. See [Brauer 1967]. Regarding Heinz Hopf, see [Frei & Stammbach 1999]. He was a professor in Zurich from 1931.\n\nI.3 The war\n\n25\n\nvery different from the situation of the French army. On the other hand, there were, for instance in Cambridge, during the whole war, active pacifists (often people who remembered the Boer war), conscientious objectors (often for religious reasons), and even, after the Military Service Act, associations fighting against conscription (Hardy was the secretary of one of these associations, The Union of Democratic Control )—such phenomena had no analogue in France after the start of the war. If this war slaughtered 800,000 British soldiers (among them the eldest son of Grace Chisholm and William Young, who were mentioned above) and if two million people were wounded (among them the mathematician Ralph Fowler, wounded at Gallipoli), this was not a massacre of the intellectual elite comparable to that which affected French students. See [Barrow-Green 2008]. But let us come back to the French mathematicians. Paul Lévy and Émile Borel served in the artillery, Maurice Fréchet, born in 1878, was mobilised with the rank of sergeant and served as an interpreter with the British troops (but on the front), André Bloch34 was injured, René Thiry was injured twice and was taken as a prisoner, Louis Antoine, second lieutenant35 in the 151st , was wounded three times and became blind, Louis Sartre, another 1911 student of the ens, was taken prisoner, Paul Flamant, second lieutenant in the 77th , was wounded in Charleroi and taken prisoner, André Marchaud, a 1909 graduate of the ens, second lieutenant in the 344th , was taken prisoner as early as August 20th 1914, Henri Mineur, who entered the ens at eighteen in 1917, enlisted in the army. Many young scientists died. According to [Guiraldenq 1999], of 265 students who entered the ens between 1910 and 1913, 109 were killed (this is the 41% mentioned above)36 . Of most of them, the names have been forgotten— they are nevertheless still visible, in golden letters engraved in the marble of the Memorial at the École normale supérieure, as well as on the yellowing pages of the yearbook of former students. One thinks for instance of the brilliant young mathematician René Gateaux, killed as early as October 3rd 1914, at the age of twenty-five, when he had not quite finished his thesis37 , of Joseph 34\n\n35\n\n36\n\n37\n\nAndré Bloch and Paul Lévy are the only former students of the École polytechnique in our list of young mathematician soldiers, all the others being from the École normale. As was Julia, André Bloch was born in 1893. He entered the École polytechnique in 1912. For more information about this uncommon mathematician, who, by the way, was also a specialist in the Picard theorems that we mention here and there in this text, see [Cartan & Ferrand 1988]. The ranks and the numbers of the regiments given here come from the yearbook of the association of former students of the École normale supérieure. I don’t know the proportion of students of the École polytechnique who were killed. In his book [1970], Paul Lévy writes that the fact that he chose the École polytechnique (rather than the ens) may have saved his life. Regarding René Gateaux’ life, death and destiny, see the paper of Laurent Mazliak [2007]. The Academy of Sciences posthumously awarded the Francœur Prize to Gateaux in 1916.\n\nI The Great Prize, the framework\n\nc M.A.\n\n26\n\nThe Memorial, unveiled on December 9th 1923, at the École normale supérieure\n\nM. Gateaux, formerly a student of the École normale, then disciple of our illustrious correspondent M. Senator Volterra, who recognised his high value, also died for France, thus disappointing the legitimate expectations created by his first work [M. Gateaux, naguère élève de l’École normale, puis disciple de notre Illustre correspondant M. le Sénateur Volterra, qui en avait reconnu la haute valeur, est aussi mort pour la France, trompant ainsi les légitimes espérances que suscitaient ses premiers travaux] Jordan [1916] would say during the public session in which the prizes were announced. Two of his posthumous papers [1919a ; 1919b] would be published by Hadamard and Paul Lévy, in the same volume as an article [Fatou 1919b] we shall have the opportunity to mention again.\n\nI.3 The war\n\n27\n\nMarty, a specialist in Fredholm equations, who died for France in 191438 , of Roger Vidil, a 1911 student of the ens as was Julia, who had written up the notes he took during the Peccot course of Châtelet [1913], killed near Arras on November 27th 1914 and reported missing until his body was identified in 1917, of Paul Lambert, an algebraist, ranked second at seventeen in the same year 1911, the author of a paper on Gauss integers, corporal in the 60th , killed at the front in 1915, of Jean Piglowski, who was always in a good mood and had written a small paper on the motion of projectiles in 1911, killed in in the Vosges on February 18th 1915, of Louis Néollier, second lieutenant in the 258th killed in 1914, whose disastrous agrégation oral exam was recounted by Lebesgue [1991, p. 308] (in 1913)39 , and who was still reported missing40 after the armistice in 1918, or of Roger Félix, ranked first at the ens, at seventeen, in 1916, who enlisted before call-up because he wanted to be with his classmates and who “died for France” shortly before the armistice41 . This is how the destiny of these young people is related, at the Academy of Sciences, at the end of 1915: They were pacifists, so to speak, by purpose, because scientific works are, more than anything else, works of peace and quiet; they were also pacifists by reason, because an intelligence which has been charmed by the enchantments of Science, delighted by its wonders, refuses to understand that men should use all the resources of their mind to collect the most effective ways of killing one another. They enroled willingly among the disciples of the naïve school which pretended “to declare peace to the world”. But now sounds the call to arms. The Homeland is attacked, and all these pacifists stand: no one will miss the call. Farewell! the quiet work in the laboratory; they are now only soldiers; they do not even think—and it might be a pity that nobody thought of it for them—to take advantage of their knowledge to obtain special positions; had they not been called to handle the shovel and the gun like their friends who just had left the file or the plough, they would think themselves demeaned42 . They are all brothers; all 38 39\n\n40\n\n41 42\n\nSee also Note 81 in Chapter VI. The algebraists Lambert and Vidil are mentioned in [Dubreil 1982]. Julia mentioned Lambert in a speech [1970, p. 169] he gave in 1950. Lambert, Piglowski and Néollier appear, very much alive, in [Lebesgue 1991]. The article [Piglowski 1911] of Piglowski is referenced in the Jahrbuch über die Fortschritte der Mathematik. I found mention of the paper [Lambert 1912] in the notice [Julia 1919a] which Gaston Julia devoted to his friend Paul Lambert. This war also caused numerous disappearances. The record of Louis Néollier in the database “memory of men” [mémoire des hommes] of the French Ministry of Defence says that he “died for France between September 20th and 26th 1914”—his body was never found and it was a judgement dated May 21st 1920 that declared him dead. Regarding Roger Félix, see the memoires of his sister in [Félix 2005]. Let us listen to another point of view, that of Camille Marbo [1968, p. 165 and 172], regarding her adopted son Fernand Lebeau, a student at the ens, a socialist who was an opponent of the war:\n\n28\n\nI The Great Prize, the framework will walk hand in hand, under the horizon blue uniform, the uniform of equality that mistakes them for the sky! Only, when the assault time comes, they will remember that the more educated have to set the example; they will be the first to jump on the embankments, the first to run to the barbed wires, the first to die [Perrier 1915, p. 803]43 .\n\nNote that the rhetoric that would accompany the mention of the war wound of Julia all the way through speeches by himself or by others that are collected in [Julia 1970] is very close to that which we have just had the opportunity to As a physicist with a great future ahead of him, he was posted in a sound reconnaissance section [...] Without mentioning it to anybody, he managed to get a position of lieutenant in the infantry, like almost all his colleagues. During his first leave, he told me “We socialists, who want to work for harmony between peoples and peace, we decided to be sent to the front line in order to prove that we are as brave as anybody. Those who survive will have the right to speak loudly in front of the shirkers.” [...] “Never forget it”, Fernand told me. I never forgot it.\n\n43\n\n[En tant qu’agrégé physicien promis à un brillant avenir, il avait été affecté à une section de repérage par le son [...] Sans en parler à personne, il avait fait des démarches pour obtenir un poste de lieutenant d’infanterie, comme la presque totalité de ses camarades. À sa dernière permission, il m’avait dit: “ Nous, socialistes, désireux de travailler pour l’entente des peuples et la paix, nous avons décidé de nous faire envoyer en première ligne afin de prouver que nous sommes aussi courageux que n’importe qui. Ceux qui survivront auront le droit de parler haut devant les embusqués.” [...] “Ne l’oublie pas, m’avait dit Fernand”. Je ne l’ai pas oublié.] Numerous pacifists and socialists enlisted, like Henri Barbusse who described his experience in Under Fire (le Feu) [Barbusse 1916], Goncourt Prize 1916. Ils étaient, pour ainsi dire, pacifistes par destination, parce que les œuvres scientifiques sont avant tout des œuvres de calme et de sérénité; ils l’étaient aussi, par raison, parce qu’une intelligence séduite par les enchantements de la Science, ravie par ses merveilles, se refuse à comprendre que des hommes emploient toutes les ressources de leur esprit à rassembler les plus sûrs moyens de s’entre-tuer. Volontiers, ils se rangeaient parmi les disciples de cette école naïve qui prétendait “déclarer la paix au monde”. Mais voilà que résonne l’appel aux armes. La Patrie est attaquée et tous ces pacifistes sont debout: pas un ne manquera à l’appel. Adieu! le tranquille travail du laboratoire; ils ne sont plus que des soldats désormais; ils ne songent même pas — et il fut peut-être dommage qu’on n’y ait pas songé pour eux — à se réclamer de leur savoir pour obtenir des postes spéciaux; ils croiraient déchoir s’ils n’étaient pas appelés à manier la pelle ou le fusil, tout comme les camarades qui viennent de déposer la lime ou de quitter la charrue. Tous sont frères; tous vont marcher la main dans la main, sous l’uniforme bleu horizon, l’uniforme d’égalité qui les confond avec le ciel! Seulement, quand arrivera l’heure de l’assaut, ils se souviendront que les plus instruits doivent l’exemple; ils seront les premiers à sauter sur les glacis, les premiers à courir aux fils barbelés, les premiers à mourir.\n\nI.3 The war\n\n29\n\nadmire. More of a politician, Painlevé would say, in his victory speech [1918c, p. 799]: Ah! Gentlemen, the horrifying holocaust demanded by the monstrous Moloch erected by pangermanist ambition before he was annihilated! However stoical we decide to be, our heart becomes heavy when we think of our deserted laboratories, of our university chairs from which eloquent and deep voices will not be heard anymore, of so many young and powerful brains whose fertile thought was interrupted forever by a stupid iron fragment. Our grandes Écoles, the breeding grounds of our engineers and scientists,— École polytechnique, École centrale, École normale supérieure, to quote only these,—how empty will be their audience44 when they meet for the first time!45\n\nFrom this evocation, we understand that a whole generation of intellectuals, of scientists and, for what interests us here, a generation of mathematicians, was sacrificed and decimated. According to [Leloup 2009], the last thesis in mathematics defended in Paris by a French mathematician in 1914 was that of Georges Valiron, on June 20th , there were three of them in 1915, including that of Joseph Pérès, one in 1916, then the next one was that of Julia, of which we shall speak at length later (see page 64), in December 1917. There was then only one in 1918, that of Pierre Humbert (Georges Humbert’s son) on June 18th 1918 (in Paris)46 . One should note that he was wounded during the war and, like Julia, started his research again after his injury. Fathers bury their sons. Julia and the mathematicians This is one of the reasons why Gaston Julia, a brilliant young former student of the ens, seriously and atrociously injured on January 25th 1915, was the darling child of the mathematicians of the previous generation. 44\n\nLet us quote Camille Marbo again [1968, p. 171]: Back in his position of scientific director [at the ens], Émile Borel found the school filled with ghosts. [Revenu prendre son poste de directeur scientifique [à l’ens], Émile Borel trouva l’École peuplée d’ombres.]\n\n45\n\n46\n\nAh! Messieurs, l’effroyable holocauste qu’a exigé, avant d’être anéanti, le Moloch monstrueux dressé par l’ambition pangermaniste! Si stoïques que nous voulions être, notre cœur se serre quand nous songeons à nos laboratoires déserts, à nos chaires où des voix éloquentes et graves ne se feront plus entendre, à tant de cerveaux jeunes et puissants dont un éclat de fer stupide a interrompu pour jamais la pensée féconde. Nos grandes Écoles, pépinières de nos ingénieurs et de nos savants, — École polytechnique, École centrale, École normale supérieure, pour ne citer que celles-là, — quels vides présenteront leurs auditoires quand ils se réuniront pour la première fois! I owe this information to Juliette Leloup.\n\n30\n\nI The Great Prize, the framework\n\nHe was seen as a substitute son for a lot of them, who had lost theirs. Hadamard, for instance, lost two of his sons47 , Jordan three sons and one grandson. Closer to Julia, let us mention Émile Borel, who was the scientific director of the ens, and who lost his nephew and adopted son, also a former student of the ens, in the storm on September 29th 1915 (Fernand Lebeau has already been mentioned in Note 42, see the memories book [Marbo 1968]), Émile Picard, whose elder son was killed48 in Crouy in January 1915 (just before Julia was wounded), Georges Humbert, whose son was wounded. All took it in turns at his bedside in the military hospital of Val-de-Grâce. The atmosphere in which Julia’s work took place is perfectly described in the report that Picard would deliver at the end of the viva for his thesis (see page 67): through Julia, the sacrificed generation49 would be glorified50 . 47\n\n48\n\n49\n\n50\n\nWhile their mother, Louise Hadamard, was a nurse, Pierre Hadamard, a student of the École polytechnique, was killed in February 1916 in Verdun at the age of 22, and Étienne Hadamard, who passed the exam to enter the École centrale, was killed in June 1916, also in Verdun, at the age of 19. Let us add that the third son of Jacques and Louise Hadamard, Mathieu, a member of the ffl (the French resistance army), would be killed in 1944. See [Maz’ya & Shaposhnikova 1998]. The elder son of Picard, Charles (1884–1915), was killed in Crouy, near Soissons, on January 8th 1915; his youngest daughter Madeleine (1892–1915) was killed during the war as well, she was a nurse. A few years later, Picard would lose his last son Henry (1886–1926) killed by tuberculosis. Two daughters would survive him, Jeanne and Suzanne (Picard’s biographical file, archives of the Academy of Sciences). Jeanne and Charles Picard (born in 1882 and 1884) were childhood friends (and cousins) of Marguerite Borel (born in 1883), see her book [Marbo 1968]. A more detailed discussion of the notion of “generation” (and of the generation in question here) is given in [Sirinelli 1992]. Julia played very well the role of a representative of this generation. The way Paul Dubreil [1950, p. 149], a 1923 graduate of the ens, remembered the inauguration of the Memorial shown on page 26 shows this: Shortly after the start of the academic year, the “École” was awarded the War Cross, during a ceremony in which the sacrifice of its Sons, dead and alive, was exalted. When Dupuy finished reading the long list of those who fell, we saw you [Dubreil is addressing Julia] move forward to receive the Cross of the École and to carry it to the Memorial. Among the memories I have that are related to the 1914–1918 war, this is one of the deepest; it still gives me a striking impression of seriousness and greatness. [Peu après la rentrée, l’École, cette année-là, reçut la Croix de Guerre, au cours d’une cérémonie où fut exalté le sacrifice de ses Fils, morts et vivants. Quand Dupuy eut fini de lire la longue liste de ceux qui étaient tombés, nous vous [Dubreil s’adresse à Julia] vîmes vous avancer pour recevoir la Croix de l’École et la porter au Monument aux Morts. Dans ceux de mes souvenirs qui se rapportent à la guerre 1914–1918, celui-ci est l’un des plus profonds; il me laisse encore une impression saisissante de gravité et de grandeur.]\n\nI.3 The war\n\n31\n\nVolume 6 of the Complete Works of Julia [1970], the one in which his speeches and non-mathematical texts are collected, is full of hints of the fact that Picard was, for Julia, a fatherly figure. The very catholic Gaston Julia loved to compare Picard with Saint Christopher (see for instance [Julia 1970, p. 50 and 262]). One can find in the archives of the Academy of Sciences a letter sent by Julia to Picard in February 1936 to give him an account of the state of the International Mathematical Union (imu) (Julia was a member of the Commission in charge of the preparation of the refounding of the imu at the Oslo conference51 ), a letter the main part of which is devoted to a description of the pain and health problems of Julia. The way Julia, who, at the time of this letter, was a man of 43, complains, shows the kind of relationship he had with his correspondent. In addition, Julia was the one who gave a speech “on behalf of the students of M. Émile Picard” during the ceremony of awarding the medal of the Mittag-Leffler Institute to Picard on July 6th 1937 (see [Julia 1970, p. 39]). It is probable that, conversely, Julia was a kind of son for Picard. There was a similar relationship between Julia and Borel. All the students of the ens, and in particular Julia, who was writing up Borel’s lectures, were, even before the war, the “children” of the assistant director Borel52 . The letters of Julia to Borel53 show that Borel sent money to Julia, in 1914, to help him to equip himself before leaving for the front. Borel was also, for quite a long time, a kind of father for Julia54 . War effort Montel, who finished his military service in 1898 with the rank of corporal [Cassin 1966] was mobilised, despite some “eye problems”: Montel writes to me that his eyes begin again to worry him55\n\nLebesgue [1991, p. 144] wrote on March 23th 1906, and again on October 7th 1910, The state of Montel’s eyes has not improved, on the contrary56 [Lebesgue 1991, p. 268]. 51 52\n\n53 54\n\n55 56\n\nRegarding the imu, see also page 209. Regarding the family atmosphere at the ens, invitation of the students by the scientific director, and so on, see again [Marbo 1968]. Borel Collection, archives of the Academy of Sciences. These mathematicians constituted a kind of “parental generation”, even if it is not absolutely correct, in terms of their influence, to put Borel and Hadamard in the same generation as Picard and Jordan. Actually, Borel, as the scientific director of the ens and with his Collection de monographies sur la théorie des fonctions, and Hadamard, setting up his legendary seminar at the Collège de France in 1913, would have a more direct scientific influence than Picard and Jordan. Montel m’écrit que ses yeux recommencent à l’inquiéter L’état des yeux de Montel ne s’est pas amélioré au contraire\n\n32\n\nI The Great Prize, the framework\n\nAfter a few months, Painlevé called him to the Department of Inventions and he contributed to the war effort by Lebesgue’s side (see below). Other mathematicians were not called up, Baire for instance, due to failing psychological health57 , Denjoy, who was declared unfit for military life because of his very bad eyesight, was only called up for the auxiliary service [Cartan 1974] and worked on the mathematical problems of ballistics (see below)58 . The two other protagonists of the story of iteration, Fatou and Lattès, did not fight in the war. Pierre Fatou had a very weak constitution (see Chapter V and the references there), which explains why he was not called up. Samuel Lattès also had some health problems. For him too, we have a testimony of Lebesgue. In 1910, he wrote about the question of academic positions: Lattès’ health is such that he might not agree to go to Clermont, but it should be offered to him59 [Lebesgue 1991, p. 251]60 ,\n\nand, a few days later: Lattès is neurasthenic61 , true, but not in his work [Lebesgue 1991, p. 256].62\n\nIt seems that he stayed in Toulouse for the whole duration of the war. If he contributed to the war effort and how, we do not know. ? This is not the place to investigate in great detail and systematically how the scientists contributed to the war effort. This question goes far beyond the scope of the present study and deserves to be left to “real” historians— who do indeed investigate it: see the very interesting study [Aubin & Bret 2003] and, more specifically on mathematics and mathematicians, the works of the “project on the history of mathematics” of the Institut mathématique de Jussieu (for instance [Mazliak 2007 ; Goldstein 2009]). We nevertheless mention briefly (based solely on published sources which are easily accessible63 and which concern, for the most part, mathematicians 57\n\n58\n\n59\n\n60\n\n61\n\n62 63\n\nDeclared unfit for duty after a few weeks of military service at the end of 1897, he was exempted permanently on December 1st 1914 (see [Dugac 1990]). According to [Choquet 1975], he was sent on a mission to Utrecht in 1917 and was torpedoed twice on the way there. La santé de Lattès est telle qu’il n’acceptera peut-être pas d’aller à Clermont, mais on devrait le lui offrir Lattès was a teacher in a secondary school in Algiers, then in Dijon, in preparatory classes in Nice, then in Aix after a sick leave. He was then, after his thesis in 1906, appointed in Montpellier in 1908, “chargé de cours” (assistant-professor) at the Faculty of sciences in Besançon in 1911 and eventually, a few months later, professor in Toulouse. In a letter to Borel, dated March 11th 1902, Baire described Lattès as a “fellow in neurasthenia” [confrère en neurasthénie] [Baire 1990, p. 51]. Lattès est neurasthénique, soit, mais pas dans ses travaux. To browse the Comptes rendus is rather informative. In 1915, the following titles can be found:\n\nI.3 The war\n\n33\n\nwho appear elsewhere in this text) that some scientists, and in particular some mathematicians, contributed to the war effort without actually fighting in the war. The mobilisation started in France on August 2nd 1914. As early as August 3rd , the President of the Academy of Sciences (who, in 1914, was Paul Appell) declared: My dear Fellows In the serious situation the country is facing, I am certain that I am the spokesman of all the Members of the Academy who have not been called up to a public service, when I declare, on their behalf, that they are at the disposal of the Government to help in the national defence, each within his own special field64 .\n\nAnd our commentator Perrier, who was the president the following year, confirmed, in his inexhaustible speech [1915, p. 809]: Since August 3rd 1914, its members [of the Academy of Sciences] split up into four big Commissions corresponding to their specific competence, with respect to the various aspects of the war. A Mechanics Commission prepares for the study of the possible improvements of the Air Force, electric traction, destruction of barbed wires and even of artillery. Numerous and especially delicate are the problems the Physics Commission deals with. The Chemistry Commission prepares to know everything concerning explosives and gas, either tear gas, suffocating gas, or deadly gas, by the use of which the Germans have managed to deepen further the barbarity of their war; it thinks of organising, not without feeling nauseous, the way of paying back dishonourable enemies, but who should nevertheless be controlled by their own means, gas for gas65 , asphyxiation for asphyxiation, as our threatened soldiers and the neutrals themselves urge us to do [... the fourth Commission is that of hygiene, health and diet]66 .\n\n64\n\n65\n\n66\n\nNew treatments of the injuries of nerves by projectiles, On the ration of the soldier in wartime, On the wounds of the external genital organs, Feeding armies in campaign, Radioscopic methods to locate projectiles, On an induction device for searching for projectiles... During 1916, just Ernest Esclangon published three notes under the titles: On the air trajectories of projectiles, On cannon shots and silence zones, On the Doppler principle and the whistling of projectiles. Mes chers Confrères, Dans la situation grave où se trouve la Patrie, je suis assuré d’être l’interprète de tous les Membres de l’Académie non mobilisés dans un service public, en déclarant en leur nom qu’ils se tiennent à la disposition du Gouvernement, pour aider à la défense nationale, chacun selon sa spécialité. There was, in the ens, a chemistry laboratory that produced deadly gas [Lebesgue 1991, note 996]. Dès le 3 août 1914, ses membres [de l’Acadmie des sciences] se répartissent en quatre grandes Commissions correspondant à leurs compétences particulières, relativement aux divers aspects de la guerre. Une Commission de Mécanique s’apprête à étudier les perfectionnements qui peuvent être apportés à l’Aviation,\n\n34\n\nI The Great Prize, the framework\n\nAs we shall see (in § II.2), at the beginning of 1918, Painlevé would use a more sober style to describe this contribution of the Academy of Sciences. In what we have already called his “victory speech” [1918c, p. 808], he draws up a list and recalls the “mobilisation of science”: All the problems raised by the war, on land, on sea or in the air, the war of mines, the submarine war, all the attack and defence methods in the war of trenches, and so on, have been studied, explored, by a multitude of researchers, scientists, engineers, workers. Applications and improvement of the T.S.F. [wireless transmission (radio)]; long distance land communications; sound reconnaissance of enemy batteries and saps; radiowave tracking or guiding of dirigibles and aeroplanes; reconnaissance of enemy positions by aerial photographs; new explosives; smoke projectiles; toxic gas (as attack or protection means); aircraft engines; trench mortar shells; infantry cannons; aeroplane cannons; and lastly tanks67 , all subjects (and how many subjects do I not forget!) that required the intervention of the most diverse intelligence and to which all the sciences contributed: chemistry, mechanics, thermodynamics, optics, acoustics, electricity, meteorology, up to the investigation of new problems the interest of which will appear in the future. The most abstract or the most subtle mathematics contributed to the solution of reconnaissance problems and to the computation of very new range tables which increased by 25 per cent the efficiency of the artillery.68\n\n67\n\n68\n\nà la traction électrique ou à vapeur, à la destruction des fils barbelés ou même à l’Artillerie. Nombreux et particulièrement délicats sont les problèmes qui doivent occuper la Commission de Physique. Celle de Chimie se dispose à connaître de tout ce qui concerne les explosifs et ces gaz lacrymogènes, asphyxiants ou meurtriers par l’emploi desquels les Allemands ont trouvé moyen d’avilir encore la barbarie de leur guerre; elle songe à organiser, non sans un haut-le-cœur, les moyens de rendre à des ennemis déshonorés, mais qu’il fallait cependant contenir par leurs propres moyens, gaz pour gaz, asphyxie pour asphyxie, comme le réclament instamment nos soldats menacés et les neutres eux-mêmes The production of tanks was determined in June 1917 and played a decisive role in the last phase of the war. Jules Breton, who would be elected as a free Academician in 1920, contributed, at the Department of Inventions, to developing this vehicle. Regarding this topic, see the speech [Perrier 1940] of the President of the Academy of Sciences, another Perrier, during another war. Tous les problèmes que posent la guerre sur terre, sur mer ou dans les airs, la guerre de mines, la guerre sous-marine, tous les moyens d’attaque et de défense dans la guerre de tranchées, etc., ont été étudiés, fouillés, approfondis par une multitude de chercheurs, savants, ingénieurs, artisans, ouvriers. Applications et perfectionnements de la T.S.F.; communications à distance par le sol; repérage par le son des batteries ou des sapes ennemies; repérage ou guidage par les ondes hertziennes des dirigeables ou des avions; repérage des positions ennemies par photographies aériennes; explosifs nouveaux; projectiles fumigènes; gaz toxiques (moyens d’attaque ou de protection); moteurs d’avions; mortiers de tranchées; canons d’infanterie; canons d’avions; enfin tanks, autant de sujets (et combien j’en oublie!) qui ont sollicité les intelligences les plus diverses et mis à contribution toutes les sciences: chimie, mécanique, thermodynamique, optique, acoustique,\n\nI.3 The war\n\n35\n\nLet us thus come to the mathematicians69 . Here is, for instance, what Montel [1941] said in his obituary of Lebesgue70 in 1941: During the 1914–1918 war, he chaired the Mathematics Commission of the Service of Inventions, Investigations and Scientific Experiments the director of which is our fellow member M. Maurain71 in this Department of Inventions which was created by Painlevé. With a tireless energy, he worked on the solution of the problems raised by the computation and correction of the trajectories of projectiles, sound reconnaissance, and so on. With the help of a large team of volunteers, he prepares a triple entry collection of trajectories72 , which would be used, by interpolation, for the fast computation of range tables73 .\n\nThis Comm"
