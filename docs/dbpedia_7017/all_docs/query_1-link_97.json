With ten years of operational experience, the PJM energy market is uniquely suited to test the theories of market concentration and efficiency in a natural experiment. This research tests the hypothesis that, for a given number of generating units in the industry, system marginal price will be a decreasing function of the number of owners or generators controlling the units (i.e., the industry concentration ratio). Market simulations are utilized to assess price-cost markups in the PJM energy market during three distinct periods of expansion: (1) pre-Commonwealth Edison integration, (2) pre-American Electric Power (AEP), Dayton Power and Light (DPL), Duquesne Light (Duquesne), and Dominion Virginia Power (Dominion) integration, and (3) post-AFT, DPL. Duquesne, and Dominion Integration. The results of the market simulations for the May 1 to August 31 periods for 2003, 2004, and 2005, indicate that the performance of the market improved with the addition of new market participants in 2004 and 2005. The results of the simulation indicate that the load-weighted Lerner index decreased to -3.70 percent in 2005 from 0.92 percent in 2003. Clearly, the addition of Commonwealth Edison in 2004 significantly increased constraints within the PJM energy market and likely impacted the observed prices in PJM during 2004 due to the lack of a significant link to the other PJM market participants. This deficiency was address in 2005 with the addition of American Electric Power. The market simulations also highlight the prevalence of computed negative markups in the simulation results. Many of the off-peak periods in particular are characterized by negative markups where the expected marginal cost exceeds the observed price. Unit commitment constraints are believed to largely account for these\n\n77 FR 3766 - PJM Interconnection, L.L.C.; Notice of Staff Technical Conference\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2012-01-25\n\n...

We estimate and monetize the resulting human health and environmental damages from life cycle air emissions for each vehicle technology. We model PJM using the most recent data available (2010) as well as projections of the PJM grid in 2018 and a hypothetical scenario with increased wind penetration. We assess a range of sensitivity cases to verify the robustness of our results. We find that PEVs have higher life cycle air emissions damages than gasoline HEVs in the recent grid scenario, which has a high percentage of coal generation on the margin. In particular, battery electric vehicles with large battery capacity can produce two to three times as much air emissions damage as gasoline HEVs, depending on charge timing. In our future 2018 grid scenarios that account for predicted coal plant retirements, PEVs would produce air emissions damages comparable to or slightly lower than HEVs.\n\nConsequential life cycle air emissions externalities for plug-in electric vehicles in the PJM interconnection\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWeis, Allison; Jaramillo, Paulina; Michalek, Jeremy\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe perform a consequential life cycle analysis of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and conventional gasoline vehicles in the PJM interconnection using a detailed, normative optimization model of the PJM electricity grid that captures the change in power plant operations and related emissions due to vehicle charging.

(letter)\n\nAn economic welfare analysis of demand response in the PJM electricity market\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWalawalkar, Rahul; Blumsack, Seth; Apt, Jay; Fernands, Stephen\n\n2008-01-01\n\nWe analyze the economic properties of the economic demand-response (DR) program in the PJM electricity market in the United States using DR market data. PJM's program provided subsidies to customers who reduced load in response to price signals. The program incorporated a 'trigger point', at a locational marginal price of $75/MWh, at or beyond which payments for load reduction included a subsidy payment. Particularly during peak hours, such a program saves money for the system, but the subsidies involved introduce distortions into the market. We simulate demand-side bidding into the PJM market, and compare the social welfare gains with the subsidies paid to price-responsive load using load and price data for year 2006. The largest economic effect is wealth transfers from generators to non price-responsive loads. Based on the incentive payment structure that was in effect through the end of 2007, we estimate that the social welfare gains exceed the distortions introduced by the subsidies. Lowering the trigger point increases the transfer from generators to consumers, but may result in the subsidy outweighing the social welfare gains due to load curtailment. We estimate that the socially optimal range for the incentive trigger point would be $66-77/MWh\n\nProbing the WL'WH and WR'WH interactions at LHC\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBao Shoushan; Li Honglei; Si Zongguo; Zhou Yufeng\n\n2011-01-01\n\nMany new physics models predict the existence of TeV-scale charged gauge boson W ' together with Higgs-boson(s). We study the W ' WH interaction and explore the angular distribution of charged leptons to distinguish W R ' WH from W L ' WH in the ppâHWâbblÎ½ process at the LHC. It is found that a new type forward-backward asymmetry (A FB ) relating to the angle between the direction of the charged lepton in the W rest frame and that of the reconstructed W ' in the laboratory frame is useful to investigate the properties of W ' WH interaction. We analyze the standard model backgrounds and develop a set of cuts to highlight the signal and suppress the backgrounds at LHC. We find that A FB can reach 0.03(-0.07) for W R ' (W L ' ) production at â(S)=14 TeV.\n\nWhÄnau Ora; He Whakaaro Ä WhÄnau: MÄori Family Views of Family Wellbeing\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAmohia F. Boulton\n\n2014-04-01\n\nFull Text Available This article presents the findings from two studies that investigated the concept of whÄnau ora (family wellbeing: One examined the nature of resilience for MÄori whÄnau and how resilience relates to whÄnau ora; while the second investigated the impact of the Working for Families policy on MÄori familiesâ perceptions of whÄnau ora. In each study, MÄori were asked to define whÄnau ora for their family. The responses to the âwhÄnau oraâ definition question in each of the studies were separated out to derive a unique dataset of 46 whÄnau definitions of whÄnau ora. A secondary analysis of responses was undertaken specifically for this article and these were compared to the whÄnau ora outcome definition outlined in the Report of the Taskforce on WhÄnau-Centred Initiatives (Taskforce on WhÄnau-Centred Initiatives, 2010. The degree of concordance between the definitions of whÄnau ora expressed by MÄori families and those espoused by the governmentâs Taskforce is outlined. The article discusses the variability in understandings around whÄnau ora and the implications of our analysis for social service delivery and social policy development.\n\nWh-optatives in Danish\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nÃrsnes, Bjarne\n\n2013-01-01\n\nDanish has an optative taking the form of a wh-clause with embedded word order: Hvem der var rig! lit. âWho there were rich!â with the intended meaning Wish I were rich! Such wh-clauses cannot be used as optatives in German or English (or only marginally so). On the basis of a detailed analysis...... of the syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of this little-studied phenomenon, this article seeks to explain why a wh-clause with âembeddedâ word order can be used as an optative. I argue that wh-optatives are compositional in many but not all respects. It is a special construction whose interpretation...... is determined to a large extent by its grammatical properties but which also has completely idiosyncratic properties. In German and English, such wh-clauses are only potential optatives: They are not used as optatives, but nothing would preclude it....\n\nA comparative study among fossil fuel power plants in PJM and California ISO by DEA environmental assessment\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSueyoshi, Toshiyuki; Goto, Mika\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis study compares among fossil fuel power plants in PJM and California ISO by their unified (operational and environmental) performance. DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) is used as a methodology. For comparative analysis, DEA incorporates strategic concepts such as natural and managerial disposability into the computational process. This study explores both how to measure Returns to Scale (RTS) under natural disposability and how to measure Damages to Scale (DTS) under managerial disposability. This empirical study obtains two implications on US energy policy. One of the two policy implications is that California ISO outperforms PJM in terms of the three unified efficiency measures. The result implies that strict regulation on undesirable outputs, as found in California, is important in enhancing the performance of US fossil fuel power plants. Thus, it is necessary for federal and local governments to regulate the fossil fuel power plants under the strict implementation of environmental protection. Under such a policy direction, it is possible for US fossil fuel power plants to attain economic prosperity (by enhancing their operational efficiencies) and to satisfy environmental regulation (by enhancing their environmental efficiencies). The other policy implication is that coal-fired and gas-fired power plants in PJM and California ISO need to reduce their operational sizes or introduce technology innovation on desirable and undesirable outputs and/or new management for environmental protection within their operations. Meanwhile, oil-fired power plants may increase their operational sizes if they can introduce technology innovation and new management on undesirable outputs. - Highlights: â¢ This study compares fossil fuel power plants in PJM and California ISO. â¢ California ISO outperforms PJM in terms of their unified efficiency measures. â¢ Regulation by Clean Air Act is important for environmental protection. â¢ Fossil fuel power plants need technology\n\n48 CFR 53.303-WH-347 - Department of Labor Form WH-347, Payroll (For Contractor's Optional Use).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-10-01\n\n... 48 Federal Acquisition Regulations System 2 2010-10-01 2010-10-01 false Department of Labor Form WH-347, Payroll (For Contractor's Optional Use). 53.303-WH-347 Section 53.303-WH-347 Federal...

The current M&V protocol requires that a PURPA-compliant Load Research study be conducted every five years for each Load-Serving Entity (LSE). The current M&V protocol is expensive to implement and administer particularly for mature load control programs, some of which are marginally cost-effective. There was growing evidence that some LSEs were mothballing or dropping their DLC programs in lieu of incurring the expense associated with the M&V. This project had several objectives: (1) examine the potential for developing deemed savings estimates acceptable to PJM for legacy air conditioning and water heating DLC programs, and (2) explore the development of a collaborative, regional, consensus-based approach for conducting monitoring and verification of load reductions for emerging load management technologies for customers that do not have interval metering capability.\n\n77 FR 30002 - Primary Power, LLC v.

Independent system operators (ISOs) now manage broad regional markets for electrical energy in several areas of the U.S. A recent rulemaking by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) encourages the development of regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and restructured competitive wholesale electricity markets nationwide. To date, the transition to competitive wholesale markets has not been easy. The increased reliance on market forces coupled with unusually high electricity demand for some periods have created conditions amenable to market power abuse in many regions throughout the U.S. In the summer of 1999, hot and humid summer conditions in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, and the District of Columbia pushed peak demand in the PJM Interconnection to record levels. These demand conditions coincided with the introduction of market-based pricing in the wholesale electricity market. Prices for electricity increased on average by 55 percent, and reached the $1,000/MWh range. This study examines the extent to which generator market power raised prices above competitive levels in the PJM Interconnection during the summer of 1999. It simulates hourly market-clearing prices assuming competitive market behavior and compares these prices with observed market prices in computing price markups over the April 1-August 31, 1999 period. The results of the simulation analysis are supported with an examination of actual generator bid data of incumbent generators. Price markups averaged 14.7 percent above expected marginal cost over the 5-month period for all non-transmission-constrained hours. The evidence presented suggests that the June and July monthly markups were strongly influenced by generator market power as price inelastic peak demand approached the electricity generation capacity constraint of the market.

For my analysis, I follow Plunkett (1992:73 in adopting a weak version of the Continuity Hypothesis where all the principles of UG are available from the outset of the acquisition process, but the structure of the functional template must be built up before parameter setting can begin. I adopt this hypothesis due to its compatibility with my finding that in the acquisition of Russian wh-questions, the functional projection CP appears at a later stage of syntactic development than other functional projections. Following Plunkett, I assume that in the beginning, the landing site for the wh-word is [Spec,TP] and later, for the valuation of other features (such as finiteness, the child is forced to acquire another functional projection (CP in order to create a landing site for the wh-word. The analysis shows that the first wh-questions acquired by the child are wh-complement questions. The child starts to produce subject wh-questions when the CP projection is acquired, and by the age of 2;4.14, the childâs structure of wh-questions is close to that of adult speech.\n\nDid Geomagnetic Activity Challenge Electric Power Reliability During Solar Cycle 23? Evidence from the PJM Regional Transmission Organization in North America\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nForbes, Kevin F.; Cyr, Chris St\n\n2012-01-01\n\nDuring solar cycle 22, a very intense geomagnetic storm on 13 March 1989 contributed to the collapse of the Hydro-Quebec power system in Canada. This event clearly demonstrated that geomagnetic storms have the potential to lead to blackouts. This paper addresses whether geomagnetic activity challenged power system reliability during solar cycle 23. Operations by PJM Interconnection, LLC (hereafter PJM), a regional transmission organization in North America, are examined over the period 1 April 2002 through 30 April 2004. During this time PJM coordinated the movement of wholesale electricity in all or parts of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia in the United States. We examine the relationship between a proxy of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) and a metric of challenged reliability. In this study, GICs are proxied using magnetometer data from a geomagnetic observatory located just outside the PJM control area. The metric of challenged reliability is the incidence of out-of-economic-merit order dispatching due to adverse reactive power conditions. The statistical methods employed make it possible to disentangle the effects of GICs on power system operations from purely terrestrial factors. The results of the analysis indicate that geomagnetic activity can significantly increase the likelihood that the system operator will dispatch generating units based on system stability considerations rather than economic merit.\n\n75 FR 45626 - PJM Interconnection, L.L.C.; Notice of Petition for Declaratory Order\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-08-03\n\n... review in the Commission's Public Reference Room in Washington, DC.

We find that controlled electric vehicle charging can reduce associated generation costs by 23%-34% in part by shifting loads to lower-cost, higher-emitting coal plants. This shift results in increased externality costs of health and environmental damages from increased air pollution. On balance, we find that controlled charging of electric vehicles produces negative net social benefits in the recent PJM grid but could have positive net social benefits in a future grid with sufficient coal retirements and wind penetration.\n\nWh-filler-gap dependency formation guides reflexive antecedent search\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMichael eFrazier\n\n2015-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Prior studies on online sentence processing have shown that the parser can resolve non-local dependencies rapidly and accurately. This study investigates the interaction between the processing of two such non-local dependencies: wh-filler-gap dependencies (WhFGD and reflexive-antecedent dependencies. We show that reflexive-antecedent dependency resolution is sensitive to the presence of a WhFGD, and argue that the filler-gap dependency established by WhFGD resolution is selected online as the antecedent of a reflexive dependency. We investigate the processing of constructions like (1, where two NPs might be possible antecedents for the reflexive, namely which cowgirl and Mary. Even though Mary is linearly closer to the reflexive, the only grammatically licit antecedent for the reflexive is the more distant wh-NP, which cowgirl. 1. Which cowgirl did Mary expect to have injured herself due to negligence?Four eye-tracking text-reading experiments were conducted on examples like (1, differing in whether the embedded clause was non-finite (1 and 3 or finite (2 and 4, and in whether the tail of the wh-dependency intervened between the reflexive and its closest overt antecedent (1 and 2 or the wh-dependency was associated with a position earlier in the sentence (3 and 4.The results of Experiments 1 and 2 indicate the parser accesses the result of WhFGD formation during reflexive antecedent search. The resolution of a wh-dependency alters the representation that reflexive antecedent search operates over, allowing the grammatical but linearly distant antecedent to be accessed rapidly. In the absence of a long-distance WhFGD (Exp. 3 and 4, wh-NPs were not found to impact reading times of the reflexive, indicating that the parser's ability to select distant wh-NPs as reflexive antecedents crucially involves syntactic structure.\n\n\"Wh\"-Questions in the English Language\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMowarin, Macaulay\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis paper analyzes \"wh\"-questions in the English Language based mainly on Chomsky's Minimalist Programme of transformational grammar as the theoretical model.

[PJM Interconnection LLC, Philadelphia, PA (United States)\n\n2005-07-01\n\nPJM is one of the largest grid operators in North America, serving 51 million people. This white paper examined the causes of the 2003 blackout in relation to grid management tools, operator training and system planning and analysis. The aim of the paper was to explain how competition and regional transmission offices (RTOs) are addressing these issues and doing more to help improve reliability and strengthen the grid. It was suggested that consumer savings can be achieved while enhancing, rather than diminishing the reliability and security of the electricity system. Changes in the electricity industry were reviewed. Issues concerning the lack of data to measure grid reliability were discussed. It was suggested that key influences on grid reliability are regional dispatch and scheduling practices, as well as RTO coordination and system operator training. Security constrained unit commitment was discussed, as well as various new technologies to improve reliability, including real-time contingency analysis and generation dispatch; real time voltage analysis; and visualization technology. Applications scales and scopes were discussed, as well as issues concerning RTO coordination. Issues concerning enhanced operator information through data transfer protocols were discussed, as well as the development of enhanced reliability tools through joint operating agreements. It was suggested that regional planning and large wholesale markets support regional reliability. It was concluded that regional RTO markets have evolved to produce economic efficiency and enhanced reliability in short-term and mid-term operations, and provide transparent regional information that will assist in providing data in the future, in order to address the long-term infrastructure investment concerns that exist on a national level.\n\n29 CFR Appendix B to Part 825 - Certification of Health Care Provider (Forms WH-380E & WH-380F)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... 29 Labor 3 2010-07-01 2010-07-01 false Certification of Health Care Provider (Forms WH-380E & WH-380F) B Appendix B to Part 825 Labor Regulations Relating to Labor (Continued) WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION, DEPARTMENT OF LABOR OTHER LAWS THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT OF 1993 Pt. 825, App. B Appendix B to Part...\n\nDo Persian Native Speakers Prosodically Mark Wh-in-situ Questions?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShiamizadeh, Zohreh; Caspers, Johanneke; Schiller, Niels O\n\n2018-02-01\n\nIt has been shown that prosody contributes to the contrast between declarativity and interrogativity, notably in interrogative utterances lacking lexico-syntactic features of interrogativity. Accordingly, it may be proposed that prosody plays a role in marking wh-in-situ questions in which the interrogativity feature (the wh-phrase) does not move to sentence-initial position, as, for example, in Persian. This paper examines whether prosody distinguishes Persian wh-in-situ questions from declaratives in the absence of the interrogativity feature in the sentence-initial position. To answer this question, a production experiment was designed in which wh-questions and declaratives were elicited from Persian native speakers. On the basis of the results of previous studies, we hypothesize that prosodic features mark wh-in-situ questions as opposed to declaratives at both the local (pre- and post-wh part) and global level (complete sentence). The results of the current study confirm our hypothesis that prosodic correlates mark the pre-wh part as well as the complete sentence in wh-in-situ questions. The results support theoretical concepts such as the frequency code, the universal dichotomous association between relaxation and declarativity on the one hand and tension and interrogativity on the other, the relation between prosody and pragmatics, and the relation between prosody and encoding and decoding of sentence type.\n\nSubject-Auxillary Inversion Errors and Wh Question Acquisition: What Children Do Know.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRowland, Caroline F.; Pine, Julian M.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nAnalyzed correct wh-question production and subject-auxiliary inversion errors in one child's wh-question data.

At NLO in QCD, tWH interferes with t anti tH and a procedure to meaningfully separate the two processes needs to be employed. In order to define tWH production for both total rates and differential distributions, we consider the diagram removal and diagram subtraction techniques that have been previously proposed for treating intermediate resonances at NLO, in particular in the context of tW production. These techniques feature approximations that need to be carefully taken into account when theoretical predictions are compared to experimental measurements. To this aim, we first critically revisit the tW process, for which an extensive literature exists and where an analogous interference with t anti t production takes place. We then provide robust results for total and differential cross sections for tW and tWH at 13 TeV, also matching short-distance events to a parton shower. We formulate a reliable prescription to estimate the theoretical uncertainties, including those associated to the very definition of the process at NLO. Finally, we study the sensitivity to a non-Standard-Model relative phase between the Higgs couplings to the top quark and to the W boson in tWH production.

If efficient appliances are used, an average household will use about 700 kWh per year, compared to about 3000 kWh it is using on average at present. Efficient appliances, however, are more expensive. The extra cost per kWh saved is about the same as the cost of the fuel needed to produce a kWh in a power plant. The 700 kWh per year can be produced by an autonomous solar cell system with an area of 3 m 2 (efficiency 19%). The analysis is valid roughly for the area between 40 o northern and southern latitude. A comparison has been made between the total costs of a grid connection and the costs of an autonomous solar cell system. If all costs are capitalized and compiled, a grid connection will amount to about $6,000 (fuel costs are not included). The costs of a solar cell system producing 700 kWh per year are about the same or even lower. The modular nature of solar cell systems makes it possible to start with a certain number of appliances, depending on the amount of money one can spend. 6 tabs., 2 refs\n\nEstimating the value of electricity storage in PJM. Arbitrage and some welfare effects\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSioshansi, Ramteen; Denholm, Paul; Jenkin, Thomas; Weiss, Jurgen\n\n2009-01-01\n\nSignificant increases in prices and price volatility of natural gas and electricity have raised interest in the potential economic opportunities for electricity storage. In this paper, we analyze the arbitrage value of a price-taking storage device in PJM (power transmission organization in the USA) during the six-year period from 2002 to 2007, to understand the impact of fuel prices, transmission constraints, efficiency, storage capacity, and fuel mix. The impact of load-shifting for larger amounts of storage, where reductions in arbitrage are offset by shifts in consumer and producer surplus as well as increases in social welfare from a variety of sources, is also considered.

These \"peaking units\" are exempt from some federal and state air quality rules. We identify RTO assignment and peaking unit classification for EGUs in the Eastern U.S. and estimate air quality for four emission scenarios with the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model during the July 2006 heat wave. Further, we population-weight ambient values as a surrogate for potential population exposure. Emissions from electricity reliability networks negatively impact air quality in their own region and in neighboring geographic areas. Monitored and controlled PJM peaking units are generally located in economically depressed areas and can contribute up to 87% of hourly maximum PM2.5 mass locally. Potential population exposure to peaking unit PM2.5 mass is highest in the model domain's most populated cities. Average daily temperature and national gross domestic product steer peaking unit heat input. Air quality planning that capitalizes on a priori knowledge of local electricity demand and economics may provide a more holistic approach to protect human health within the context of growing energy needs in a changing world.\n\nEscape from the island.

Previous research has found that Mandarin-speaking children assign a universal interpretation to sentences with a wh-word (e.g., shei 'who') followed by the adverbial quantifier dou 'all' (Zhou in Appl Psycholinguist 36:411-435, 2013). Children also compute free choice inferences in sentences that contain a modal verb in addition to a wh-word and dou (Zhou, in: Nakayama, Su, Huang (eds.) Studies in Chinese and Japanese language acquisition: in honour of Stephen Crain. John Benjamins Publishing Company, Amsterdam, pp 223-235, 2017). The present study used a Question-Statement Task to assess children's interpretation of sentences containing shei + dou, both with and without the modal verb beiyunxu 'was allowed to', as well as the contrast between sentences with shei + dou, which are statements for adults, versus ones with dou + shei, which are wh-questions for adults. The 5-year-old Mandarin-speaking child participants exhibited adult-like linguistic knowledge of the semantics and pragmatics of wh-words, the adverbial quantifier dou, and the deontic modal verb beiyunxu.\n\nAgrammatic Comprehension of Wh-Extraction in Danish, English and French\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nNyvad, Anne Mette\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis dissertation discusses the comprehension deficit in agrammatic aphasia and how it relates to wh-extraction.

We projected the polytopes to three-dimensional Euclidean space where the quaternionic vertices are the orbits of the Coxeter group W(H 3 ), icosahedral group with inversion, where W(H 3 ) x Z 2 is one of the maximal subgroups of the Coxeter group W(H 4 ). The orbits of the icosahedral group W(H 3 ) in the polytope {3, 3, 5} are the conjugacy classes of the binary icosahedral group and represent a number of icosahedrons, dodecahedrons and one icosidodecahedron in three dimensions. The 15 orbits of the icosahedral group W(H 3 ) in the polytope {5, 3, 3} represent the dodecahedrons, icosidodecahedrons, small rhombicosidodecahedrons and some convex solids possessing the icosahedral symmetry. One of the convex solids with 60 vertices is very similar to the truncated icosahedron (soccer ball) but with two different edge lengths which can be taken as a realistic model of the C 60 molecule at extreme temperature and pressure\n\nTechnetium labeled WH701 for its potential use to image TNF-receptor-positive hepatocarcinoma\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nXia Jinsong; Wu Hua; Xiang Yan\n\n2004-01-01\n\nObjective: In this investigation, TNF analogs (WH701) was labeled with technetium (A number of TNF analogs had been selected and synthesized in our lab using random phage-display peptides library ) and pharmacokinetics and feasibility studies were performed for its potential use as diagnostic radiopharmaceutical. Methods WH701 was radiolabeled with 99m Tc then the complexes were characterized by thin layer chromatography. In vitro stability of the radiolabeled WH701 was examined simultaneity. Biodistribution and tumor uptake studies were also conducted to determine its in vivo characteristics. Results: The peptide analog WH701 permitted efficient incorporation of 99m Tc. The preparation of 99m Tc-WH701 was stable in vitro. Studies in vivo suggested that the biological activity of the peptide was not compromised. The agent was cleared rapidly from the blood and excreted mainly from kidney. The labeled peptide was shown in the nude mouse model to localize rapidly and specifically in site of tumor. Conclusions: The TNF analogue peptide WH701 can be radiolabeled with 99m Tc without loss of affinity, and the 99m Tc-WH701 shows radiochemical stability for an extended period of time in vitro. The high specific tumor uptake, rapid blood clearance, and predominantly renal excretion make 99m Tc-WH701 a promising candidate for tumor imaging.

Handling this variability with slower, traditional resources leads to inefficient system dispatch, and in some cases may compromise reliability. Grid operators are looking to future energy technologies, such as automated demand response (DR), to provide capacity-based reliability services as the need for these services increase. While DR resources are expected to have the flexibility characteristics operators are looking for, demonstrations are necessary to build confidence in their capabilities. Additionally, building owners are uncertain of the monetary value and operational burden of providing these services. To address this, the present study demonstrates the ability of demand response resources providing two ancillary services in the PJM territory, synchronous reserve and regulation, using an OpenADR 2.0b signaling architecture. The loads under control include HVAC and lighting at a big box retail store and variable frequency fan loads. The study examines performance characteristics of the resource: the speed of response, communications latencies in the architecture, and accuracy of response. It also examines the frequency and duration of events and the value in the marketplace which can be used to examine if the opportunity is sufficient to entice building owners to participate.\n\nTechnetium labeled WH701 for its potential use to image TNF-receptor-positive hepatocarcinoma\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nJinsong, Xia; Hua, Wu; Yan, Xiang [Department of Nuclear Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan (China)\n\n2004-07-01\n\nObjective: In this investigation, TNF analogs (WH701) was labeled with technetium (A number of TNF analogs had been selected and synthesized in our lab using random phage-display peptides library ) and pharmacokinetics and feasibility studies were performed for its potential use as diagnostic radiopharmaceutical.

We calculate the electric grid load increase and emissions due to vehicle battery charging in PJM and NYISO with the current generation mix, the current mix with a $50/tonne CO(2) price, and this case but with existing coal generators retrofitted with 80% CO(2) capture. We also examine all new generation being natural gas or wind+gas. PHEV fleet percentages between 0.4 and 50% are examined. Vehicles with small (4 kWh) and large (16 kWh) batteries are modeled with driving patterns from the National Household Transportation Survey. Three charging strategies and three scenarios for future electric generation are considered. When compared to 2020 CAFE standards, net CO(2) emissions in New York are reduced by switching from gasoline to electricity; coal-heavy PJM shows somewhat smaller benefits unless coal units are fitted with CCS or replaced with lower CO(2) generation. NO(X) is reduced in both RTOs, but there is upward pressure on SO(2) emissions or allowance prices under a cap.\n\nJBioWH: an open-source Java framework for bioinformatics data integration.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVera, Roberto; Perez-Riverol, Yasset; Perez, Sonia; Ligeti, BalÃ¡zs; KertÃ©sz-Farkas, Attila; Pongor, SÃ¡ndor\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe Java BioWareHouse (JBioWH) project is an open-source platform-independent programming framework that allows a user to build his/her own integrated database from the most popular data sources.

The present study aimed at exploring how variation occurred in English and Persian wh-questions. More specifically, it investigated whether such a variation was systematic and patterned. To this end, a modified version of the Edinburgh Map Task was used in data collection. The population of this study was 60 Canadian and Persian native speakers who performed the task through the construction of wh-question variants. The results indicated that both languages experienced variation in the construction of wh-questions. However, Persian proved to be more variable than English because it allowed more wh-question variants to be produced. Moreover, this variation was patterned in English and Persian individually, yet a systematic variation could not be observed between these two languages. It followed that the different mind-sets of the Canadian and Iranian participants which were affected by social and cultural factors might account for such a variation.\n\nJBioWH: an open-source Java framework for bioinformatics data integration\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVera, Roberto; Perez-Riverol, Yasset; Perez, Sonia; Ligeti, BalÃ¡zs; KertÃ©sz-Farkas, Attila; Pongor, SÃ¡ndor\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe Java BioWareHouse (JBioWH) project is an open-source platform-independent programming framework that allows a user to build his/her own integrated database from the most popular data sources.

It is currently controversial the degree to which such deficits derive from social-pragmatic requirements and/or because these are complex grammatical structures. The current study employed the intermodal preferential looking (IPL paradigm, which reduces social-pragmatic demands. The IPL paradigm can help distinguish these proposals, as successful comprehension promotes the âpragmatics-originsâ argument whereas comprehension difficulties would implicate a âgrammatical-originsâ argument. Additionally, we tested both the linguistic and social explanations by assessing the contributions of children's early grammatical knowledge (i.e., SVO word order and their social-pragmatic scores on the Vineland to their later wh-question comprehension. Fourteen children with ASD and 17 TD children, matched on language level, were visited in their homes at 4-month intervals. Comprehension of wh-questions and SVO word order were tested via IPL: the wh-question video showed a costumed horse and bird serving as agents or patients of familiar transitive actions. During the test trials, they were displayed side by side with directing audios (e.g., âWhat did the horse tickle?â, âWhat hugged the bird?â, âWhere is the horse/bird?â. Children's eye movements were coded offline; the DV was their percent looking to the named item during test. To show comprehension, children should look longer at the named item during a where-question than during a subject-wh or object-wh question. Results indicated that TD children comprehended both subject and object wh-questions at 32 months of age. Comprehension of object-wh questions emerged chronologically later in children with ASD compared to their TD peers, but at similar levels of language. Moreover, performance on word order and social-pragmatic scores independently predicted both groups' later\n\nProcessing load imposed by line breaks in English temporal wh-questions\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMasako Hirotani\n\n2016-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Prosody plays an important role in online sentence processing both explicitly and implicitly. It has been shown that prosodically packaging together parts of a sentence that are interpreted together facilitates processing of the sentence. This applies not only to explicit prosody but also implicit prosody. The present work hypothesizes that a line break in a written text induces an implicit prosodic break, which, in turn, should result in a processing bias for interpreting English wh-questions. Two experiments â one self-paced reading study and one questionnaire study â are reported. Both supported the line break hypothesis mentioned above. The results of the self-paced reading experiment showed that unambiguous wh-questions were read faster when the location of line breaks (or frame breaks matched the scope of a wh-phrase (main or embedded clause than when they did not. The questionnaire tested sentences with an ambiguous wh-phrase, one that could attach either to the main or the embedded clause. These sentences were interpreted as attaching to the main clause more often than to the embedded clause when a line break appeared after the main verb, but not when it appeared after the embedded verb.\n\nDesign and Construction of 10 kWh Class Flywheel Energy Storage System\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJung, S. Y.; Han, S. C.; Han, Y. H.; Park, B. J.; Bae, Y. C.; Lee, W. R.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nA superconductor flywheel energy storage system (SFES) is an electro-mechanical battery which transforms electrical energy into mechanical energy for storage, and vice versa. A 10 kWh class flywheel energy storage system (FESS) has been developed to evaluate the feasibility of a 35 kWh class SFES with a flywheel Ip/If ratio larger than 1. The 10 kWh class FESS is composed of a main frame, a composite flywheel, active magnetic dampers (AMDs), a permanent magnet bearing, and a motor/generator. The flywheel of the FESS rotates at a very high speed to store energy, while being levitated by a permanent magnetic bearing and a pair of thrust AMDs. The 10 kWh class flywheel is mainly composed of a composite rotor assembly, where most of the energy is stored, two radial and two thrust AMD rotors, which dissipate vibration at critical speeds, a permanent magnet rotor, which supports most of the flywheel weight, a motor rotor, which spins the flywheel, and a central hollow shaft, where the parts are assembled and aligned to. The stators of each of the main components are assembled on to housings, which are assembled and aligned to the main frame. Many factors have been considered while designing each part of the flywheel, stator and frame. In this study, a 10 kWh class flywheel energy storage system has been designed and constructed for test operation.\n\nAdditional functions of remotely read kWh-meters\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKoponen, P [VTT Energy, Espoo (Finland); Vehvilaeinen, S [Mittrix Oy (Finland); Rantanen, J [Helsinki Energy Board (Finland)\n\n1998-08-01\n\nIn this chapter the possibilities to include new applications into remotely read smart kWh-meters are considered. New electronic meters can measure various electric quantities and have some extra calculating capacity. So they can be used to provide functions that distribution automation and the customer need and thus share the costs. Some applications like monitoring the state of the distribution network or locating faults are only for the utility, but many applications also need an interface to the customers or their automation systems. Among those are monitoring the quality of electricity, estimating load curves, applying dynamic tariffs and selling electricity and accounting. As a special item, the continuous monitoring of the quality of electricity is discussed. This includes voltage levels, total distortion, asymmetry and so on. If such a kWh-meter indicates quality problems it is possible to go there with a portable quality meter that is suitable for the case and inspect the situation. The poor quality can be detected before it causes harm to equipment owned by the customers or the power distribution company. This article also presents a prototype of such a quality monitoring kWh-meter. Dynamic tariffs and free electricity markets require two way communication with the utility and the customer and measurement of the time variations of the energy consumption. The customers or their energy management system must receive the energy prices from the utility and calculate the energy costs and decide upon the energy consumption control actions. Some alternative ways to meet these customer interface requirements are compared. Remote reading of kWh-meters requires a certain investment in meters and their data communication with the utility. Because smart meters can have some additional memory and calculating capacity and are capable of measuring various electric quantities, it is possible to share the costs with other applications that use the same hardware and data\n\n78 FR 15653 - Notice of Intent To Form the Commercial HVAC, WH, and Refrigeration Certification Working Group...\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2013-03-12\n\n...

We study the impacts of the complete NLO QCD radiative corrections to the integrated cross sections, the scale dependence of the cross sections, and the differential cross sections ((dÏ/dcosÎ¸), (dÏ/dp T )) of the final W-, Higgs boson and jet. We find that the corrections significantly modify the physical observables, and reduce the scale uncertainty of the leading-order cross section. Our results show that by applying the inclusive scheme with p T,j cut =20 GeV and taking m H =120 GeV, Î¼=Î¼ 0 â¡(1/2)(m W +m H ), the K-factor is 1.15 for the process ppâW Â± H 0 j+X at the Tevatron, while the K-factors for the processes ppâW - H 0 j+X and ppâW + H 0 j+X at the LHC are 1.12 and 1.08, respectively. We conclude that to understand the hadronic associated WH 0 production, it is necessary to study the NLO QCD corrections to the WH 0 j production process which is part of the inclusive WH 0 production.\n\nSyntactic constraints and individual differences in native and non-native processing of wh-movement\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAdrienne eJohnson\n\n2016-04-01\n\nFull Text Available There is a debate as to whether second language (L2 learners show qualitatively similar processing profiles as native speakers or whether L2 learners are restricted in their ability to use syntactic information during online processing. In the realm of wh-dependency resolution, research has examined whether learners, similar to native speakers, attempt to resolve wh-dependencies in grammatically licensed contexts but avoid positing gaps in illicit contexts such as islands. Also at issue is whether the avoidance of gap filling in islands is due to adherence to syntactic constraints or whether islands simply present processing bottlenecks. One approach has been to examine the relationship between processing abilities and the establishment of wh-dependencies in islands. Grammatical accounts of islands do not predict such a relationship as the parser should simply not predict gaps in illicit contexts. In contrast, a pattern of results showing that individuals with more processing resources are better able to establish wh-dependencies in islands could conceivably be compatible with certain processing accounts. In a self-paced reading experiment which examines the processing of wh- dependencies, we address both questions, examining whether native English speakers and Korean learners of English show qualitatively similar patterns and whether there is a relationship between working memory, as measured by counting span and reading span, and processing in both island and non-island contexts. The results of the self-paced reading experiment suggest that learners can use syntactic information on the same timecourse as native speakers, showing qualitative similarity between the two groups. Results of regression analyses did not reveal a significant relationship between working memory and the establishment of wh-dependencies in islands but we did observe significant relationships between working memory and the processing of licit wh-dependencies.

New Zealand-wide cross sectional population surveys between 2000 and 2002 of smokers and whÄnau pre- and post-airing of the campaign. Measures included recall and awareness of the campaign; perceptions of the campaign; and campaign-attributed changes in quitting-related attitudes and behaviours. Seventy-eight per cent of smokers and 73% of whÄnau were able to recall the campaign one year following its launch. The television commercials (TVCs) were consistently rated very believable or very relevant by over half of the smokers who had seen them. More than half of smokers (54%) stated that the campaign had made them more likely to quit. This nationwide mass media cessation campaign developed to deliver a cessation message to indigenous people was received positively by MÄori smokers and their whÄnau and played a role in prompting quit attempts. Social marketing campaigns have an important role as part of a tobacco control program to reduce high smoking prevalence among MÄori and inequalities in health outcomes between MÄori and other New Zealanders.\n\nThe road to electricity deregulation : open highway or crash-test dummy\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLaughlin, K. [PJM Interconnection LLC, Norristown, PA (United States)\n\n2001-07-01\n\nAn overview of PJM Interconnection company operations and governance was presented. The company has been a member of the power pool since 1927 and has been ISO approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) since January 1998. PJM operates 540 generating units with a total generation capacity of 57,000 MW. Its role as a marketer since deregulation of energy markets has proven to be a success due to its dynamic operation through independent efficiency.

The company's energy market was composed of 52 per cent bilateral transactions, 18 per cent spot market, 27 per cent self-supplied, and 3 per cent net imports. tabs., figs.\n\nA real option analysis of investments in hydropower-The case of Norway\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKjaerland, Frode\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThis paper presents a valuation study of hydropower investment opportunities in the Norwegian context. According to NVE (Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, the regulator), there is a potential of 39 TWh not yet developed (generation in a normal year is approximately 120 TWh). By using the conceptual real option framework of Dixit and Pindyck [1994. Investment Under Uncertainty. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ] one can estimate the value of investment opportunities to NOK 11 million/GWh (EUR 1.4 million/GWh). Furthermore, the optimal trigger price for initiating an investment based on electricity forward prices is calculated to NOK 0.32/kWh (EUR 0.04/kWh). The analysis shows consistency between real option theory and aggregate investment behaviour in Norwegian hydropower\n\nEscape from the island.

It explores connections between Wh.3469's final design and construction and the different interests each community had in X-ray crystallography.\n\nOptimal feed-in tariff for solar photovoltaic power generation in China: A real options analysis\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nZhang, M.M.; Zhou, D.Q.; Zhou, P.; Liu, G.Q.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe feed-in tariff policy is widely used to promote the development of renewable energy. China also adopts feed-in tariff policy to attract greater investment in solar photovoltaic power generation. This study employs real options method to assess the optimal levels of feed-in tariffs in 30 provinces of China. The uncertainties in CO_2 price and investment cost are considered. A method that integrates the backward dynamic programming algorithm and Least-Squares Monte Carlo method is used to solve the model. The results demonstrate that the feed-in tariffs of 30 provinces range from 0.68 RMB/kWh to 1.71 RMB/kWh, and the average level is 1.01 RMB/kWh. On this basis, we find that the levels of sub-regional feed-in tariff announced in 2013 are no longer appropriate and should be adjusted as soon as possible. We have also identified the implications of technological progress and carbon emission trading schemes, as well as the importance of strengthening electricity transmission. It has been suggested that the Chinese government takes diverse measures, including increasing research and development investment, establishing and improving a nationwide carbon emission trading scheme and accelerating the construction of electricity-transmission infrastructure, to reduce the required feed-in tariff and promote the development of solar photovoltaic power generation. - Highlights: â¢ We estimate the optimal levels of feed-in tariffs for 30 provinces in China by using real options method. â¢ The uncertainties in CO_2 price and investment cost are considered. â¢ The feed-in tariffs of 30 provinces range from 0.68 RMB/kWh to 1.71 RMB/kWh, and the average level is 1.01 RMB/kWh.\n\nDesign of a 1-kWh bipolar nickel hydrogen battery\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCataldo, R.

Accordingly, wind energy is in the forefront of many government officials' minds throughout the United States; however, there are several barriers to wind farm development. This research reviews the social and political barriers to wind farm development and examines the successful renewable energy policies that have been used throughout Europe and the United States. This research consists of interviews with various stakeholders in the PJM region who compare and contrast renewable energy policies in Europe from those in the United States. The resulting information from the interviews creates a comprehensive policy framework that policy makers at all levels of government can utilize and refer to when discussing and drafting wind energy legislation.\n\nFiscal implications of a 1-mill/kWh waste management fee\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nEngel, R.L.; White, M.K.\n\n1982-12-01\n\nThe variations in parameters and uncertainties that can affect future waste management program costs are examined. Costs were estimated for both spent fuel and reprocessing waste disposal. Costs for repository site exploration and development, construction and operation of the first two repositories, and waste transportation of either spent fuel or reprocessing waste to the repository were included in the estimate of program costs. Costs for disposing of either spent fuel or reprocessing wastes in four generic geologic media (domed salt, bedded salt, tuff, and granite) were estimated considering uncertainties in package design waste preparation, mining cost, repository layout, repository startup date, and waste shipment distance. The range of these costs is then compared with estimated revenues from the proposed 1-mill/kWh fee to determine whether that fee would provide sufficient funds to meet waste management program needs. The estimated revenues and the range of program cost estimates in 1982 dollar resulting from these variations and uncertainties are shown graphically. The figure shows that the assumed 1-mill/kWh fee provides sufficient revenues to meet program costs for the range of conditions considered. Collection of a 1-mill/kWh fee at the time fuel is irradiated will result in the federal government precollecting for future waste management services. The relationship between funds accumulated to offset future waste management liabilities and the estimated cost of these liabilities will depend on the inflation rate and on the interest the federal government earns on the accumulated funds. If inflation continues, future fee adjustments will be required to assure that adequate funds are available to dispose of wastes when they are received\n\nWh-question intonation in Peninsular Spanish: Multiple contours and the effect of task type\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNicholas C. Henriksen\n\n2009-06-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper reports on an experimental investigation of wh-question intonation in Peninsular Spanish. Speech data were collected from six LeÃ³n, Spain Peninsular Spanish speakers, and oral production data were elicited under two conditions: a computerized sentence reading task and an information gap task-oriented dialogue. The latter task was an adaptation of the HCRC Map Task method (cf. Anderson et al., 1991 and was designed to elicit multiple wh-question productions in an unscripted and more spontaneous speech style than the standard sentence reading task. Results indicate that four contours exist in the tonal inventory of the six speakers. The two most frequent contours were a final rise contour and a nuclear circumflex contour. Systematic task-based differences were found for four of the six speakers, indicating that sentence reading task data alone may not accurately reflect spontaneous speech tonal patterns (cf. Cruttenden, 2007; but see also Lickley, Schepman, & Ladd, 2005. The experimental findings serve to clarify a number of assumptions about the syntax-prosody interface underlying wh-question utterance signaling; they also have implications for research methods in intonation and task-based variation in laboratory phonology.\n\nHearing dysfunction in heterozygous Mitf(Mi-wh) /+ mice, a model for Waardenburg syndrome type 2 and Tietz syndrome.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNi, Christina; Zhang, Deming; Beyer, Lisa A; Halsey, Karin E; Fukui, Hideto; Raphael, Yehoash; Dolan, David F; Hornyak, Thomas J\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe human deafness-pigmentation syndromes, Waardenburg syndrome (WS) type 2a, and Tietz syndrome are characterized by profound deafness but only partial cutaneous pigmentary abnormalities. Both syndromes are caused by mutations in MITF. To illuminate differences between cutaneous and otic melanocytes in these syndromes, their development and survival in heterozygous Microphthalmia-White (Mitf(Mi-wh) /+) mice were studied and hearing function of these mice characterized. Mitf(Mi-wh) /+ mice have a profound hearing deficit, characterized by elevated auditory brainstem response thresholds, reduced distortion product otoacoustic emissions, absent endocochlear potential, loss of outer hair cells, and stria vascularis abnormalities. Mitf(Mi-wh) /+ embryos have fewer melanoblasts during embryonic development than their wild-type littermates. Although cochlear melanocytes are present at birth, they disappear from the Mitf(Mi-wh) /+ cochlea between P1 and P7. These findings may provide insight into the mechanism of melanocyte and hearing loss in human deafness-pigmentation syndromes such as WS and Tietz syndrome and illustrate differences between otic and follicular melanocytes.

However, sufficient space for the installation of thermal energy storage (TES) components may not be available in family houses or urban areas, where space may be restricted and expensive. Sorption TES devices seem to be a promising means of replacing conventional TES devices and reducing the occupied space for its high energy density. In this paper, a 10Â kWh short-term sorption TES device was developed and investigated. The employed composite sorbent was formed from lithium chloride (LiCl) with the addition of expanded graphite (EG). The principle of sorption TES for the LiCl/water working pair is first illustrated. This prototype was tested under conditions representative of transition or winter seasons. Under the conditions used (charging temperature T_c_h_a at 85Â Â°C, discharging temperature T_d_i_s at 40Â Â°C, condensing temperature T_c at 18Â Â°C, and evaporating temperature T_e at 30Â Â°C), the heat storage capacity can reach 10.25Â kWh, of which sorption heat accounts for approximately 60%. The heat storage density obtained was 873Â Wh per kg of composite sorbent or 65.29Â kWh/m\"3, while the heat storage density of hot water tank was about 33.02Â kWh/m\"3. - Highlights: â¢ A 10Â kWh short-term sorption thermal energy device was developed. â¢ The device was tested under conditions of transition and winter seasons. â¢ The performance of the device was improved by recovering waste heat. â¢ The sorption thermal energy device was compared with a 300-L hot water tank.\n\nSimulation of the Long period Core Design for WH type of KHNP\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nJung, Ji-Eun; Moon, Sang-Rae [Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co., Daejeon (Korea, Republic of)\n\n2016-10-15\n\nThe current core design of the reactor and the new design of long period based on ANC code are compared here targeting the unit of WH type(Westinghouse nuclear steam supply system) operated by KHNP.

While it is true that the California electricity market is in turmoil, other electricity markets like the Pennsylvania-NewJersey-Maryland (PJM) are doing fine. This paper assesses the mark of efficiency reached by the electricity markets in California, New York, and PJM. It also compares the degree of efficiency across markets (forward vs. real time) and across time. No significant differences between the California and PJM electricity markets were discovered in the year of California's energy crisis (2000) using the co-integration tests. This research suggests that differences in price behavior between these two markets during 2000 did not arise from differences in efficiency. According to our analysis and measures of efficiency, PJM and California electricity markets are more efficient than the New York market. Also, as these markets become more mature over time, their efficiency level goes up. We also found evidence that a multi-settlement scheduling system leads to higher efficiency.

The representative materials of the moderator are light water (H 2 O) and heavy water (D 2 O). Also, it is well known that the slowing-down ratio of D 2 O is hundreds of times larger than that of H 2 O while the slowing-down power of H 2 O is several times larger than that of D 2 O. This means that the H 2 O sometimes plays a role of an absorber such as the liquid zone controller (LZC) in a CANDU-type reactor. It is thought that the flux spectrums in a different reactor can differ from each other. In this research, two representative assemblies (the Westinghouse (WH)-type fuel assembly of PWR and the CANDU-type fuel lattice of PHWR) are selected and the flux results for each group are extracted. Although there are many codes for the lattice transport calculation, the WIMS code and the HELIOS code are used for the calculation of the WH-type fuel lattice and the CANDU-type fuel lattice. A clear difference in spectrum between the CANDU-type lattice and WH 16GD-type lattice is confirmed. Because of the superior moderating ratio of the heavy water, the thermal flux ratio of the CANDU-type lattice is almost 82%, while that of the WH 16 GD-type lattice is around 23%. Because of the large portion of the thermal flux in the CANDU-type lattice, the boron effect is maximized with the result from variations of boron. Thus it can be said that the spectrum largely depends on the moderator material, and the boron effect and sensitivity largely depends on the flux spectrum. Because of the dominant effect of the moderator material on the flux spectrum in a nuclear reactor, in the future, a comparison of the spectra of SFR, HTGR, PWR, and PHWR are also an interesting subject to study. Over-moderation in PHWR lattice and under-moderation in PWR lattice can be explained by the investigation about flux spectrums with variations of moderator density in each lattice\n\nThe Difference between Flux Spectrums of WH-type Assembly and CANDU-type Lattice\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nRyu, Eun Hyun; Song, Yong Mann [Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, Daejeon (Korea, Republic of)\n\n2014-10-15\n\nThe nuclear reactors are categorized by the material of the moderator because of its importance.

Because of the dominant effect of the moderator material on the flux spectrum in a nuclear reactor, in the future, a comparison of the spectra of SFR, HTGR, PWR, and PHWR are also an interesting subject to study. Over-moderation in PHWR lattice and under-moderation in PWR lattice can be explained by the investigation about flux spectrums with variations of moderator density in each\n\nMutations in actin used for structural studies partially disrupt Î²-thymosin/WH2 domains interaction.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDeville, CÃ©lia; Girard-Blanc, Christine; Assrir, Nadine; Nhiri, NaÃ¯ma; Jacquet, Eric; Bontems, FranÃ§ois; Renault, Louis; Petres, StÃ©phane; van Heijenoort, Carine\n\n2016-10-01\n\nUnderstanding the structural basis of actin cytoskeleton remodeling requires stabilization of actin monomers, oligomers, and filaments in complex with partner proteins, using various biochemical strategies. Here, we report a dramatic destabilization of the dynamic interaction with a model Î²-thymosin/WH2 domain induced by mutations in actin. This result underlines that mutant actins should be used with prudence to characterize interactions with intrinsically disordered partners as destabilization of dynamic interactions, although identifiable by NMR, may be invisible to other structural techniques. It also highlights how both Î²-thymosin/WH2 domains and actin tune local structure and dynamics in regulatory processes involving intrinsically disordered domains.

Deadweight, thermal expansion, and seismic loads were considered. Results of this analysis show that the subject piping system will meet ASME Code, Section III, Class 2 requirements\n\nUsage-based vs. rule-based learning: the acquisition of word order in wh-questions in English and Norwegian.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWestergaard, Marit\n\n2009-11-01\n\nThis paper discusses different approaches to language acquisition in relation to children's acquisition of word order in wh-questions in English and Norwegian. While generative models assert that children set major word order parameters and thus acquire a rule of subject-auxiliary inversion or generalized verb second (V2) at an early stage, some constructivist work argues that English-speaking children are simply reproducing frequent wh-word+auxiliary combinations in the input. The paper questions both approaches, re-evaluates some previous work, and provides some further data, concluding that the acquisition of wh-questions must be the result of a rule-based process. Based on variation in adult grammars, a cue-based model to language acquisition is presented, according to which children are sensitive to minor cues in the input, called micro-cues. V2 is not considered to be one major parameter, but several smaller-scale cues, which are responsible for children's lack of syntactic (over-)generalization in the acquisition process.\n\nEvolution and current status of demand response (DR) in electricity markets: Insights from PJM and NYISO\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWalawalkar, Rahul; Fernands, Stephen; Thakur, Netra; Chevva, Konda Reddy\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIn electricity markets, traditional demand side management programs are slowly getting replaced with demand response (DR) programs. These programs have evolved since the early pilot programs launched in late 1990s. With the changes in market rules the opportunities have generally increased for DR for participating in emergency, economic and ancillary service programs. In recent times, various regulators have suggested that DR can also be used as a solution to meet supply - demand fluctuations in scenarios with significant penetration of variable renewable sources in grid. This paper provides an overview of the evolution of the DR programs in PJM and NYISO markets as well as analyzes current opportunities. Although DR participation has grown, most of the current participation is in the reliability programs, which are designed to provide load curtailment during peak days. This suggests that there is a significant gap between perception of ability of DR to mitigate variability of renewables"
