The Greek calendar was based on the Olympiad, the four-year period between games. The games were staged in the wooded valley of Olympia in Elis. Here the Greeks erected statues and built temples in a grove dedicated to Zeus, supreme among the gods. The greatest shrine was an ivory and gold statue of Zeus. Created by the sculptor Phidias, it was considered one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Scholars have speculated that the games in 776 BC were not the first games, but rather the first games held after they were organized into festivals held every four years as a result of a peace agreement between the city-states of Elis and Pisa. The Eleans traced the founding of the Olympic games to their King Iphitos, who was told by the Delphi Oracle to plant the olive tree from which the victors' wreaths were made.\n\nAccording to Hippias of Elis, who compiled a list of Olympic victors c.400 BC, at first the only Olympic event was a 200-yard dash, called a stadium. This was the only event until 724 BC, when a two-stadia race was added. Two years later the 24-stadia event began, and in 708 the pentathlon was added and wrestling became part of the games. This pentathlon, a five-event match consisted of running, wrestling, leaping, throwing the discus, and hurling the javelin. In time boxing, a chariot race, and other events were included.\n\nThe victors of these early games were crowned with wreaths from a sacred olive tree that grew behind the temple of Zeus. According to tradition this tree was planted by Hercules (Heracles), founder of the games. The winners marched around the grove to the accompaniment of a flute while admirers chanted songs written by a prominent poet.\n\nThe Olympic Games were held without interruptions in ancient Greece. The games were even held in 480 BC during the Persian Wars, and coincided with the Battle of Thermopylae. Although the Olympic games were never suspended, the games of 364 BC were not considered Olympic since the Arkadians had captured the sanctuary and reorganized the games.\n\nAfter the Battle of Chaironeia in 338 BC, Philip of Makedon and his son Alexander gained control over the Greek city-states. They erected the Philippeion (a family memorial) in the sanctuary, and held political meetings at Olympia during each Olympiad. In 146 BC, the Romans gained control of Greece and, therefore, of the Olympic games. In 85 BC, the Roman general Sulla plundered the sanctuary to finance his campaign against Mithridates. Sulla also moved the 175th Olympiad (80 BC) to Rome.\n\nThe games were held every four years from 776 BC to 393 AD, when they were abolished by the Christian Byzantine Emperor Theodosius I. The ancient Olympic Games lasted for 1170 years.\n\nThe successful campaign to revive the Olympics was started in France by Baron Pierre de Coubertin late in the 19th century. The first of the modern Summer Games opened on Sunday, March 24, 1896, in Athens, Greece. The first race was won by an American college student named James Connolly.\n\nChronology of athletic events added to the Olympic Games\n\nAccording to the tradition of Hippias of Elis ca. 400 BC, the events of the Olympic Games were added to the program in the following order.\n\nYear\n\nOlympiad\n\nEvent\n\n776 BC\n\n1st Olympiad\n\nStadium race\n\n724 BC\n\n14th Olympiad\n\ndouble-stadium race\n\n720 BC\n\n15th Olympiad\n\nlong-distance race\n\n708 BC\n\n18th Olympiad\n\nPentathlon\n\n708 BC\n\n18th Olympiad\n\nWrestling\n\n688 BC\n\n23rd Olympiad\n\nBoxing\n\n680 BC\n\n25th Olympiad\n\n4-horse chariot race\n\n648 BC\n\n33rd Olympiad\n\nhorse race\n\n648 BC\n\n33rd Olympiad\n\nPankration\n\n520 BC\n\n65th Olympiad\n\nrace in armor\n\n408 BC\n\n93rd Olympiad\n\n2-horse chariot race\n\nMyths and the Olympic Games\n\nPelops myth\n\nThere are several Greek myths about how the games were started. The most common myth was the story of the hero Pelops, after whom the Peloponnese is named (\"Pelops’ isle\"). The story of Pelops was displayed prominently on the east pedimental sculptures of the Temple of Zeus. Pelops was a prince from Lydia in Asia Minor who sought the hand of Hippodamia, the daughter of King Oinomaos of Pisa. Oinomaos challenged his daughter's suitors to a chariot race under the guarantee that any young man who won the chariot race could have Hippodamia as a wife. Any young man who lost the race would be beheaded, and the heads would be used as decoration for the palace of Oinomaos. With the help of his charioteer Myrtilos, Pelops devised a plan to beat Oinomaos in the chariot race. Pelops and Myrtilos secretly replaced the bronze linchpins of the King's chariot with linchpins made of wax. When Oinomaos was about to pass Pelops in the chariot race, the wax melted and Oinomaos was thrown to his death. Pelops married Hippodamia and instituted the Olympic games to celebrate his victory. A different version of the myth refers to the Olympic games as funeral games in the memory of Oinomaos.\n\nHercules (Herakles) myth\n\nAnother myth about the origin of the Olympic Games comes from the Tenth Olympian Ode of the poet Pindar. He tells the story of how Herakles, on his fifth labor, had to clean the stables of King Augeas of Elis. Herakles approached Augeas and promised to clean the stables for the price of one-tenth of the king's cattle. Augeas agreed, and Herakles rerouted the Kladeos and Alpheos rivers to flow through the stables. Augeas did not fulfill his promise, however, and after Herakles had finished his labors he returned to Elis and waged war on Augeas. Herakles sacked the city of Elis and instituted the Olympic Games in honor of his father, Zeus. It is said that Herakles taught men how to wrestle and measured out the stadium, or the length of the footrace.\n\nThe Importance of the Olympic Games\n\nThe Importance of Ancient Greek Athletics\n\nThe ancient Greeks were highly competitive and believed strongly in the concept of \"agon\", or \"competition\" or \"contest\". The ultimate Greek goal was to be the best. All aspects of life, especially athletics, were centered around this concept. It was therefore considered one of the greatest honors to win a victory at Olympia. The fact that the only prize given at Olympia was an olive wreath illustrates this point. The athletes competed for honor, not for material goods.\n\nAthletics were of prime importance to the Greeks. The education of boys concentrated on athletics and music as well as academic subjects such as philosophy. Education took place in the gymnasion and the palaistra as well as the academy.\n\nThe Religious Aspects of the Ancient Olympic Games\n\nIn ancient Greece, games were closely connected to the worship of the gods and heroes. Games were held as part of religious ceremonies in honor of deceased heroes, a concept displayed in the funeral games for Patroklos in Book 23 of Homer's epic poem, The Iliad. Games were also held in the context of many ancient fertility festivals. The games at Olympia were connected with both the funeral games of Oinomaos, established by Pelops, and a fertility cult involving any number of gods and goddesses who were worshipped at the site. The Olympic games began to be usurped by the prominent cult of Zeus, and eventually lost much of their religious character.\n\nThe Olympic Games and the Greek Calendar\n\nThe Greek calendar was based on the conception of the four-year Olympiad. When Greek historians referred to dates, they most often referred to a year (i.e., first, second, third, fourth) within the Olympiad that the event occurred. The winner of the stadium race in a given year had the Olympiad named in honor of him. The first Olympiad is therefore known as that of Koroibos of Elis, the winner of the stadium race in 776 BC.\n\nThe Sacred Truce\n\nThe sacred truce was instituted during the month of the Olympiad. Messengers known as \"spondorophoroi\" carried the word of the truce and announced the date of the games all over the Greek world. The truce called for a cessation of all hostilities for a period of one month (later three months) to allow for the safe travel of athletes to and from Olympia. Armies and armed individuals were barred from entering the sanctuary. In addition, no death penalties could be carried out during the period of the truce.\n\nThe Internationalization of the Olympic Games\n\nFrom the beginning, the games at Olympia served as a bond between Greeks and strengthened the Greek sense of national unity. During the Hellenistic period, Greeks who came to live in foreign surroundings such as Syria, Asia, and Egypt, strove to hold on to their culture. One of the ways to achieve this was to build athletic facilities and continue their athletic traditions. They organized competitions, and sent competitors from their towns to compete in the Panhellenic games.\n\nIn the 2nd century A.D., Roman citizenship was extended to everyone within the Roman empire. From then on, the participation of many competitors from outside of Greece in the Olympic games, gave them to a degree, international nature.\n\nWhen the Greek government reinstated the games in 1896, this international character of the competitions was preserved by Baron de Coubertin. Now, 16 centuries later, the Olympic games attract competitors from countries all over the world.\n\nModern Olympic Games\n\nThe best amateur athletes in the world match skill and endurance in a series of contests called the Olympic Games. Almost every nation sends teams of selected athletes to take part. The purposes of the Olympic Games are to foster the ideal of a \"sound mind in a sound body\" and to promote friendship among nations.\n\nThe modern Olympic Games are named for athletic contests held in ancient Greece for almost 12 centuries. They were banned in AD 394 but were revived and made international in 1896. The Winter Games were added in 1924. World War I and World War II forced cancellation of the Olympics in 1916, 1940, and 1944, but they resumed in 1948 and are held every four years. After 1992 the Winter and Summer Games were no longer held within the same calendar year. Winter Games were scheduled for 1994, after only a two-year interval, and every four years thereafter. The Summer Games were scheduled for 1996, and every four years thereafter.\n\nSummer and Winter Sports\n\nSummer sports include archery, basketball, boxing, canoeing, cycling, equestrian events (horseback riding), fencing, field hockey, gymnastics, handball, judo, rowing, shooting, soccer, swimming, tennis, track and field, volleyball, water polo, weight lifting, wrestling, and yachting. Winter events include skating, skiing, bobsledding, luge, tobogganing, ice hockey, and the biathlon (skiing-shooting).\n\nThe most exacting track and field event is the decathlon (from the Greek words deka, meaning \"ten,\" and athlon, \"contest\"). Contestants compete in ten different running, jumping, and throwing events. The athlete scoring the greatest total number of points is the winner. The pentathlon, consisting of five such events, was discontinued after 1924. It was restored in the 1948 games as the modern pentathlon, based upon five military skills--fencing, riding, running, shooting, and swimming. The marathon race, covering 26 miles 385 yards, honors the ancient Greek runner Pheidippides, who ran from Marathon to Athens to announce the Greek victory against the Persians.\n\nWomen take part in separate summer and winter events. Ten new women's summer competitions added in 1984 included the marathon and a 49-mile cycling event. The pentathlon, introduced in 1964, was replaced by the heptathlon, which consists of 100-meter hurdles, shot put, high jump, long jump, javelin throw, and 200- and 800-meter races. Additional events for women in the 1992 Winter and Summer Games included the biathlon, 10-kilometer walk, baseball, and judo.\n\nHighlights of the Modern Games\n\nOne of the most dramatic feats of the Olympics was the triumph of the United States track and field team in 1896. Competing as unofficial representatives, the ten-man squad reached Athens barely in time to participate. They won nine out of 12 events.\n\nIn 1912 Jim Thorpe, a Native American, became the only man to win both the decathlon and pentathlon in one year. Officials canceled his record and took back his medals when they learned that he had played professional baseball. His medals were restored posthumously in 1982 (see Thorpe). In track and field, Jesse Owens, a black American, won four gold medals including a team medal in 1936 (see Owens). The first woman to win three individual gold medals was Fanny Blankers-Koen of The Netherlands. The first athletes to win the decathlon twice were Bob Mathias of the United States, in 1948 and 1952, and Daley Thompson of Great Britain, in 1980 and 1984. The first perfect 10.0 in Olympic gymnastics was scored by Nadia Comaneci of Romania, who received seven perfect scores and three gold medals in 1976.\n\nIn the 1964 Winter Games the Soviet speed skater Lidya Skoblikova was the first athlete to win four individual gold medals. Her feat was duplicated in the 1968 Summer Games by the Czech gymnast Vera Caslavska.\n\nIn 1972 the United States swimmer Mark Spitz won a record seven gold medals at a single Olympics. Swimmers John Naber of the United States and Kornelia Ender of East Germany each won four gold medals in the Summer Games in 1976.\n\nThe all-time individual medal winner was the American track athlete Ray C. Ewry, who won eight events in the 1900, 1904, and 1908 Games.\n\nThe 1972 Summer Games in Munich, West Germany, became a tragedy when Palestinian terrorists murdered 11 Olympic team members from Israel. In a protest against a New Zealand rugby tour of South Africa about 30 African nations boycotted the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal, Que. To protest the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan more than 60 countries, led by the United States, withdrew from the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow. The Soviet Union, which first participated in 1952, withdrew from the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles.\n\nScandals rocked the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul. Ten athletes were disqualified after drug tests revealed steroid abuse. Charges of bias and incompetence in the officiating at the boxing events led to two-year suspensions for five Korean boxers and officials and several other judges and referees.\n\nThe 1992 games were unusual in that there were no more Soviet teams; the Soviet Union had split up in December 1991. The teams that participated from its former republics, sometimes still wearing the old Soviet uniforms, represented either now-independent Baltic states or the Commonwealth of Independent States, which had been formed from 11 of the former Soviet republics. Nevertheless, at the Winter Games in Albertville the Commonwealth's United Team came in second, after Germany, in number of medals won.\n\nIn the 1896 Olympic Games there were fewer than 500 athletes representing 13 nations. In 1988 the Seoul games drew entries from a record total of 160 countries. While the number of athletes who competed in Los Angeles did not surpass the high of 10,000 set at Munich in 1972, the 1984 games set records for the largest total attendance--almost 5.8 million people--and the most gold medals for one country--83 for the United States.\n\nThe centennial Olympic Games opened in Atlanta, Ga., with more than 10,000 athletes from a record 197 nations in attendance. The opening ceremonies, which began 16 days of athletic competition, featured a tribute to the ancient Greek games and slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. Former world heavyweight boxing champion and Olympic gold medalist Muhammad Ali lit the Olympic torch, which completed a 84-day, 15,000-mile (24,000-kilometer) trek across the United States. The games featured 28 delegations that were participating for the first time, including athletes from the Czech Republic, FYROM, and Burundi, and Palestinians competing under the name Palestine. Tight security and Atlanta's hot and humid August weather were major concerns for Olympic organizers and those attending the games. In spite of security precautions, a homemade pipe bomb loaded with nails and screws exploded at a late-night concert in Centennial Olympic Park, killing one person and wounding more than 100 others. In addition, a Turkish television cameraman died of a heart attack while running to film the blast. No one claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee\n\nThe development and governance of the modern games are vested in the International Olympic Committee (IOC), founded in Paris in 1894. Its headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland. The original committee had 14 members; today there are about 70. These individuals are considered ambassadors from the committee to their national sports organizations and are dedicated to promoting amateur athletics. Normally there is only one member from each country. Presidents of the IOC are elected for an eight-year term and eligible for succeeding four-year terms.\n\nEach country sending teams to the games must have its own National Olympic Committee. By 1988 there were 167 such committees. One responsibility of a national committee is arranging for its team's participation in the games, providing equipment, and getting the team to the game site and into specially arranged housing.\n\nOfficial Olympic Anthem (Greek & English)\n\nThe Olympic Hymn (given below in Greek and English) was written by Costis Palamas, one of Greece's most famous poets, in 1893 and was set to music by Spiros Samaras in 1896. The Hymn was adopted as the Official Olympic Hymn by the International Olympic Committee in 1957.\n\nGreek\n\nΑρχαίο Πνεύμ' αθάνατον, αγνέ πατέρα\n\nτου ωραίου, του μεγάλου και τ' αληθινού,\n\nκατέβα, φανερώσου κι άστραψ' εδώ πέρα\n\nστη δόξα της δικής σου γης και τ' ουρανού.\n\nΣτο δρόμο και στο πάλεμα και στο λιθάρι,\n\nστων ευγενών Αγώνων λάμψε την ορμή,\n\nκαι με τ' αμάραντο στεφάνωσε κλωνάρι\n\nκαι σιδερένιο πλάσε κι άξιο το κορμί.\n\nΚάμποι, βουνά και πέλαγα φέγγουν μαζί σου\n\nσαν ένας λευκοπόρφυρος μέγας ναός,\n\nκαι τρέχει στο ναό εδώ προσκυνητής σου.\n\nΑρχαίο Πνεύμ' αθάνατο, κάθε λαός.\n\nEnglish\n\nImmortal spirit of antiquity,\n\nFather of the true, beautiful and good,\n\nDescend, appear, shed over us thy light\n\nUpon this ground and under this sky\n\nWhich has first witnessed thy unperishable\n\nfame.\n\nGive life and animation to those noble games!\n\nThrow wreaths of fadeless flowers to the victors\n\nIn the race and in strife!\n\nCreate in our breasts, hearts of steel!\n\nShine in a roseate hue and form a vast temple\n\nTo which all nations throng to adore thee,\n\nOh immortal spirit of antiquity.\n\nHost cities of Olympic Games\n\nSince their resumption in their modern form in 1896 in Athens, the Olympic Games took place in the following cities:\n\n1896\n\n1900\n\n1904\n\n1908\n\n1912\n\n1916\n\n1920\n\n1924\n\n1928\n\n1932\n\n1936\n\n1940\n\n1944 Athens\n\nParis\n\nSaint Louis\n\nLondon\n\nStockholm\n\nCancelled (was due in Berlin)\n\nAmbers\n\nParis\n\nAmsterdam\n\nLos Angeles\n\nBerlin\n\nCancelled (was due in Tokyo)\n\nCancelled (was due in Helsinki)\n\n1948\n\n1952\n\n1956\n\n1960\n\n1964\n\n1968\n\n1972\n\n1976\n\n1980\n\n1984\n\n1988\n\n1992\n\n1996\n\n2000 London\n\nHelsinki\n\nMelbourne\n\nRome\n\nTokyo\n\nMexico City\n\nMunich\n\nMontreal\n\nMoscow\n\nLos Angeles\n\nSeoul\n\nBarcelona\n\nAtlanta\n\nSydney\n\nSydney for Olympic Games of 2000\n\nThe International Olympic Committee, meeting in Monaco, on September 23, 1993, announced that Sydney, Australia, would be the host city for the Summer Olympic Games in the year 2000. The closest contender for the site was Beijing, China. There had been much opposition to choosing Beijing, however, because of the 1989 Tienanmen Square massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators and China's current policies on human rights. Australia had previously hosted the 1956 Summer Games in Melbourne.\n\nThe opening of the 27th Olympiad took place on Friday, 15 December 2000 in the magnificent Olympic stadium of Sydney, build specially for this historic event. The stadium is some 9 miles from the centre of the city and 1 million people where on the streets of Sydney the night before.\n\nThe ceremony, which lasted nearly four hours, started with horsemen entering the stadium bearing the Olympic flags, symbolizing the arrival of horsemen in Australia in 1778. Following the national Australian National anthem, the story of Australia was portrait through scenes of sea and fish, forest fires and dances by the Aborigines, the indigenous population of Australia for 40000 years. Thy Olympic Anthem was sang in Greek by the Australian Greek Orthodox Church choir.\n\nThe climax of the ceremony was the Olympic Torch entering the stadium, relayed by veteran Australian Olympic athletes of the 20th century and handed over to the Australian athlete Cathy Freeman, who was ringed by fire after lighting the Olympic flame. The flames rose above Ms Freeman, the 400m world champion, and moved up the stand to a final resting place over the stadium.\n\nThere was temporary anxiety when the cauldron carrying the Olympic flame, after being lit, briefly stuck in front of a worldwide television audience of nearly 4 billion. The Olympic flame went on a 16,740 - mile route of Australia involving 11,000 torch bearers and passing near 80% of the population.\n\nFacts:\n\n1) Built at cost of more than £250m, the new stadium has a capacity of 110,000 and four Boeing 747s would fit side by side under the span of the main arches of the grandstands.\n\n2) A translucent saddle-shaped roof floods the stadium with natural light during the day.\n\n3) Inside the stadium there are 99 tons of lighting and power equipment connected by 2 miles of wiring. A ring road and wide entrances to move sets. Production crew of 4,600 planned the ceremony.\n\nHistory of Grunge Music\n\nGrunge music is generally characterized by \"dirty\" guitar, strong riffs, and heavy drumming. The \"dirty\" sound resulted both from the common use of heavy guitar distortion and feedback, and from a stylistic change in the standard method of playing punk rock. Grunge involves slower tempos and dissonant harmonies that are generally not found in punk.\n\nThe lyrics concern similar themes such as social alienation, apathy, entrapment and a desire for freedom. They are typically angst-filled — anger, frustration, ennui, fear, depression and drug addiction are often explored in grunge songs. The lyricism bears similarities to those of punk and the perceptions of Generation X. A number of factors may have influenced these lyrics. Many grunge musicians and fans displayed a general disenchantment with the state of society and discomfort with social prejudices. They were often identified as 'slackers' and drug use was widespread. Also, many grunge musicians began their careers as teenagers or young adults, when feelings of angst are common. Nonetheless, not all grunge songs dealt with such themes: Nirvana's satirical \"In Bloom\" is a notable example of more humorous writing. In fact, several grunge songs are filled with either a dark or fun sense of humor as well (for example, Mudhoney's \"Touch Me, I'm Sick\" or Tad's \"Stumblin' Man\"), though this often went unnoticed by the general public. Humor in grunge often satirized glam metal (for example, Soundgarden's \"Big Dumb Sex\") and other forms of rock music that were popular during the 1980s.[2]\n\nGrunge evolved out of the Pacific Northwest's local punk rock scene, inspired by local punk bands such as The Fartz, The U-Men, the feedback- and distortion-intensive The Accused, and pop-punksters The Fastbacks.[3] Additionally, the slow, heavy, and sludgey sound of The Melvins was one of the biggest influences on what would become the grunge sound. The band itself are often considered grunge, although others would classify them differently. The same can be said for Portland's The Wipers, who were also highly influential in the development of grunge. Aside from its punk origins, the grunge movement had strong roots in the musical and youth culture of the American Northwest. The musical resemblance to such 1960s Northwest bands as The Wailers and The Sonics is unmistakable.\n\nMark Arm, the vocalist for the Seattle band Green River (and later Mudhoney), is widely credited for being the first to use the term \"grunge\" to describe the style. However, Arm used the term pejoratively; he called the band's style \"pure grunge, pure shit\". This was not seen as being negative by the media, and the term was subsequently applied to all music that sounded similar to Green River's style.[4] The word grunge itself means \"dirt\". It is likely that the term was seen as appropriate because of the \"dirty\" guitar sound that grunge is known for, and the unkempt appearance of most grunge musicians. This was in direct contradiction to the relatively polished look and sound of glam metal bands of the late 1980s.\n\nGreen River Circa 1987Formed in 1983, Green River is widely believed to have created the genre, and was a prime inspiration for many grunge bands, despite the band's relatively low level of commercial success.[5] After the band split up in 1988, members of Green River formed Mudhoney and Mother Love Bone, then - after the death of Mother Love Bone's vocalist, Andrew Wood - Pearl Jam, continuing their style. Green River, who used a harder sound in their performance than many later grunge bands, inspired other early grunge bands such as Soundgarden and Alice in Chains to use a similarly hard style. However, shortly before its mainstream success in 1991, the grunge sound began to include an alternative and hard rock influence. This is most often credited to the styles of Nirvana and Pearl Jam. Nirvana began to combine the sound of earlier grunge bands with that of the Pixies. Nirvana's use of the Pixies' \"soft verse, hard chorus\" popularized this stylistic approach in both grunge and other alternative rock genres. Pearl Jam, since their formation in 1990, used a style that was noticeably less heavy than most grunge bands. As such, the band are often classed as hard rock in addition to grunge.\n\nGrunge's unique sound is often said to have resulted from Seattle's isolation from other alternative rock scenes.[6] However, outside of the Pacific Northwest, other musicians are said to have influenced grunge. Such Northeastern bands as Sonic Youth and Dinosaur Jr. are considered important influences on the grunge sound and both groups championed many Seattle grunge bands. The influence of the Pixies on Nirvana — and through them on other bands — is also unquestionable. The Minnesota hardcore punk/alternative rock band Hüsker Dü and the Wisconsin alternative/noise rock band Killdozer are also believed by some to have been major influences. After Neil Young played live a few times with Pearl Jam and recorded the album Mirror Ball with them, some members of the media gave Young the questionable title \"Godfather of Grunge,\" a claim grounded mainly on his work with his band Crazy Horse, and his regular use of distorted guitar, most notably in the song \"Hey Hey My My\" from the album Rust Never Sleeps. Australia's The Scientists and Detroit's proto-punk luminaries the Stooges and MC5 are also noted influences.\n\nMudhoney's Steve Turner says that Black Flag's 1984 record My War and its supporting tours were major influences on many Seattle grunge bands. The record found the Los Angeles punk rock stalwarts slowing their tempo considerably and injecting a potent dose of heavy metal, though to considerable derision and disgust from some fans. Turner says that \"A lot of other people around the country hated the fact that Black Flag slowed down ... but up here it was really great — we were like 'Yay!' They were weird and fucked-up sounding.\"[7] While elements of heavy metal made their way into the grunge sound,[8] the genre continued to remain loyal to its punk roots. The mentality of the musicians was still deeply rooted in the punk scene, with many bands adhering to the DIY ethic. The hardcore punk band Bad Brains was also a huge influence on grunge. Dave Grohl of Nirvana said, \"Seeing Bad Brains live was, without a doubt, always one of the most intense, powerful experiences you could ever have... They made me absolutely determined to become a musician, they basically changed my life, and changed the lives of everyone who saw them.\" Fellow Nirvana bandmate and bassist Krist Novoselic said that an early version of their single \"In Bloom\" \"sounded like a Bad Brains song.\"[9] Bad Brains' albums such as I Against I and Quickness helped pioneer the combination of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a single sound.\n\nGrunge concerts were known for being straightforward, high-energy performances. Grunge bands avoided the complex, high budget presentations that bands from other musical genres such as heavy metal were known for; complex light arrays, pyrotechnics, and other visual effects unrelated to playing the music were not part of the concerts. Stage acting was also generally avoided. Instead, the bands presented themselves no differently from any local band, using only their instruments and their own presence as visual \"effects\" (neither being budgeted higher than what was needed). However the concerts did have some level of interactivity. Fans and musicians alike would participate in stage diving, crowd surfing, headbanging, and pogoing, though the audiences at grunge concerts were best known for their extremely enthusiastic moshing. The mosh pits would be located close to the stage, allowing such interaction between the audience and the band.\n\n[edit] Early development\n\nNirvana, early in their careerPrior to its popularity, grunge was listened to mostly by those who played the music. Bands would play at clubs with very few people in attendance, most of whom were from other performing bands. Others who listened to the music in those early days were often people who were \"just trying to get out of the rain\" as many attendants would claim. As bands began to issue albums, independent labels became the key catalysts in bringing the music to the local public. Many of the more successful bands of the era were associated with Seattle's Sub Pop record label. Other record labels in the Pacific Northwest that helped promote grunge included EMpTy Records, Estrus Records, C/Z Records, and PopLlama Records.[10][3]\n\nA seminal release in the development of grunge was 1986's Deep Six compilation, released by C/Z Records (later reissued on A&M). The record featured multiple tracks by six bands: Soundgarden, the Melvins, Green River, Malfunkshun, Skin Yard, and the U-Men; for many of them it was their first appearance on record. The artists had \"a mostly heavy, aggressive sound that melded the slower tempos of heavy metal with the intensity of hardcore\".[7] As Sub Pop producer Jack Endino recalled, \"People just said, 'Well, what kind of music is this? This isn't metal, it's not punk, What is it? '[. . .] People went 'Eureka! These bands all have something in common.'\" Later in '86 Bruce Pavitt released the Sub Pop 100 compilation as well as Green River's Dry As A Bone EP as part of his new label Sub Pop. An early Sub Pop catalog described the Green River EP as \"ultra-loose GRUNGE that destroyed the morals of a generation\".[11]\n\nIn November 1988, Sub Pop took their initial step towards popularizing grunge with the Sub Pop Singles Club, a subscription service that would allow subscribers to receive singles by local bands on a monthly basis by mail. This increased grunge's following locally, and allowed Sub Pop to become a powerful company in the local scene. According to Sub Pop founders Bruce Pavitt and Jonathan Poneman, grunge's popularity began to flourish after journalist Everett True from the British magazine Melody Maker was asked by them to write an article on the local music scene. This helped to make grunge known outside of the local area during the late 1980s, giving the genre its first major spurt of popularity.[12] Mudhoney is often credited as having been the biggest commercial success for grunge during this time, and was the most successful grunge band until the end of the 80s.[13] Still, grunge would not become a huge national phenomenon in the US until the 1990s.\n\nThe first music video to call attention to grunge was Soundgarden's \"Flower\", which was directed by Mark Miremont and aired several times on MTV's 120 Minutes. A little over two years later, the video for Nirvana's \"Smells like Teen Spirit\", directed by Samuel Bayer, would introduce grunge to the mainstream.\n\n[edit] Mainstream success\n\nNirvana's Nevermind album coverNirvana is generally credited for breaking the genre into the popular consciousness in 1991. The popularity of Nirvana's song \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", from the album Nevermind, surprised the entire music industry. The album became a #1 hit around much of the world, and paved the way for more bands, including, most popularly, Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam, in fact, had released their debut album Ten a month earlier in August 1991, but album sales only picked up after the success of Nirvana. For many audiences then and later, grunge came to be almost totally associated with these two bands and their punky, rebellious attitude towards mainstream mores as well as cultural and social institutions. By 1993, other popular Seattle-based bands (most notably Alice in Chains and Soundgarden) would also become extremely successful. Some bands from other regions, such as Stone Temple Pilots from San Diego, Australia's Silverchair, and Great Britain's Bush also became popular by the mid-90s.[14]\n\nMost grunge fans and music critics believe that grunge emerged as a popular genre and was embraced by mainstream audiences in reaction to the declining popularity of glam metal. Glam metal bands, such as Mötley Crüe, Poison, and Warrant, had been dominating the charts during the 1980s (especially in the United States) despite being looked down upon by most critics. Glam metal was known for macho (some critics have said misogynist) lyrics, anthemic riffs, and a perceived lack of social consciousness, especially in the race to attract mainstream audiences. These aspects were popular during the 1980s, but they began to have the opposite effect on audiences towards the end of the decade. Grunge, however, sharply contrasted glam metal; its lyrics avoided machismo and used a simpler style similar to punk. With a viable alternative to hair metal realized by the public, the popularity of glam metal began to die off as the popularity of grunge began to rise.\n\nGrunge fans in the Pacific Northwest believed that the media gave excessive importance to the clothing worn by grunge musicians and fans, along with other aspects of the local culture. Clothing commonly worn by grunge fans in the Northwest in its early years was a blend of the punk aesthetic with the typical outdoorsy clothing (most notably flannel shirts) of the region. The \"fashion\" did not evolve out of a conscious attempt to create an appealing fashion, but due to the inexpensiveness of such clothes and the warmth that they provided for the cold climate of the region. The media, rather than focusing on the music, would give this fashion a heavy amount of exposure. In the early 1990s, the fashion industry marketed \"grunge fashion\" to a widespread audience, charging relatively high prices for clothing that they assumed to be popular in the grunge scene. Similarly, the media would view grunge as a whole culture, assuming it to be Generation X's attempt to create a culture similar to the hippie counterculture of the previous generation. Rather than focus on the music, much of the media focused on other superficial aspects of the musicians and fans. An interesting case of this superficiality backfiring on the media was the grunge speak hoax, which caused The New York Times to print a fake list of slang terms that supposedly were used in the grunge scene. This was later proven to be a prank by Sub Pop's Megan Jasper. The excesses of this media hype would also be documented in the 1996 documentary Hype!.[3]\n\nPearl Jam's Eddie Vedder on the cover of the October 25, 1993 issue of Time magazine, as part of the feature article discussing the rising popularity of grungeWhile such superficiality bothered Seattle-area grunge fans, most grunge musicians from the area continued to dress in the way that they had prior to popularity. Some musicians from outside the region also began to dress similarly. In the rock world, expensive, designer clothing was shunned in favor of less elaborate clothing; some common items worn included flannel, jeans, boots (often Doc Martens), and Converse sneakers. Many young fans outside of the region embraced this style for its simple defiance of the norms of the era's popular culture, which was seen by many of them as corporate-dominated and superficial. In England, youth who dressed in this fashion were sometimes called grungers, while the term grungies was often used in the United States. Traditional rock and roll ostentatiousness became offensive to many rock music fans, inspiring an anti-fashion trend. Oddly, this attitude helped the fashion industry push their \"grunge fashion\" line, turning the fans' defiance to fashion against them. As a result, many grunge fans dropped the \"traditional\" grunge fashion soon after having embraced it; the industry stopped marketing it shortly afterwards.\n\nMany notable events happened during the \"grunge era\" of music that may not have happened had grunge never become popular. Alternative rock, previously heard mostly in local clubs, on college radio, and on independent record labels, became popular in the mainstream as major record labels sought out more previously obscure music styles to sell to the public. The traveling festival Lollapalooza came about as a result of this, with grunge being a major part of the 1992 and 1993 events. In the media's spotlight, grunge became part of the pop culture, most notably being a major part of the 1992 film Singles, which featured several grunge bands. Nirvana and Sonic Youth would star in a documentary film that same year, 1991: The Year Punk Broke. Riot grrrl, another hardcore punk offshoot that came into being in Western Washington (and was thus often seen as the feminine equivalent of grunge), became well known from the media coverage of the local scene. With such punk derivative genres becoming popular, punk itself was able to make a revival, as bands such as Green Day and The Offspring became chart-topping successes. Independent record labels, which used to rarely have success on level with major labels, were able to sell albums with equal or similar success as the major labels (most notably in the cases of Sub Pop and Epitaph Records).\n\n[edit] Decline of mainstream popularity\n\nThe mass popularity of grunge music was short-lived, however. There were several important factors that contributed to this. Though some of them could have single-handedly ended the genre's mainstream popularity, it is generally believed that more than one factor caused the decline.\n\nMost fans and music historians believe that many grunge bands were too opposed to mainstream stardom to actually achieve long-lasting support from major record labels. Many grunge bands refused to cooperate with major record labels in making radio-friendly hooks, and the labels found new bands that were willing to do so, albeit with a watered-down sound that did not sit well with the genre's long-time fans. A decline in music sales in general in 1996 may also have influenced labels to look for different genres to promote rather than genres such as grunge that were popular up to that point. However, this decline may have been a result of the industry's use of such watered-down groups.\n\nAnother factor that may have led to the fall of grunge's mainstream popularity was the advent of the sub-genre of grunge known as post-grunge. Post-grunge was a radio-friendly variation of grunge which lacked the \"dirty\" sound that most fans of grunge were used to. The sub-genre is generally believed to have come about at the behest of label executives who wanted to sell a variation of grunge that would sell to a larger audience as a result of sounding more like pop music. In the mid-1990s, record labels began signing several bands that used such a sound and gave them wide exposure. While some of these bands, such as Silverchair and Bush, were able to gain widespread success, many fans of grunge denounced post-grunge bands as being sell-outs. This is most notable in the cases of Candlebox and Collective Soul, who were reviled by most grunge fans. Even the commercially successful post-grunge bands would be given such accusations by grunge fans, causing most of them to have shorter spurts of popularity than earlier grunge bands.\n\nHeroin use amongst grunge musicians was also a serious problem for the continuation of some grunge bands. Andrew Wood's death from an overdose in 1990 was the first major tragedy for the grunge scene, bringing an end to Mother Love Bone. Kurt Cobain's use of heroin is believed to have contributed to his death in 1994 (though whether or not it did was never confirmed).[3] Also, the deaths of Kristen Pfaff of Hole and Layne Staley of Alice in Chains in 1994 and 2002, respectively, were caused by heroin overdoses. It is believed by many that grunge effectively began its decline when Cobain died in April of 1994. Interestingly, Cobain had often been photographed wearing t-shirts stating that \"Grunge is Dead.\"\n\nSoundgarden Circa 1991The year of 1996 proved to be the last year in which grunge musicians were considerably active. During this year, many \"lasts\" had occurred. Pearl Jam released their last album that topped the charts, No Code. Alice in Chains gave their final performances with their ailing estranged lead singer, Layne Staley. Soundgarden and The Screaming Trees released their final studio albums, Down on the Upside and Dust, respectively. And Nirvana released the live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah, the only new release from the band until the greatest hits album Nirvana in 2002.\n\nFor many fans of the genre, it wasn't until the pioneering band Soundgarden disbanded in 1997 that they finally conceded grunge's time in the mainstream was over. Over the next few years grunge's mainstream popularity quickly came to an end. Many grunge bands have continued recording and touring with more limited success, including, most significantly, Pearl Jam. Grunge music still has its followers, and many of them still express their fandom over the Internet. Grunge's mainstream following still shows some continuation in the popularity of Nirvana's post-break-up releases; the previously unreleased song \"You Know You're Right\" became a chart topping hit in 2002, and the box set With the Lights Out has become the best selling box set of all time."
