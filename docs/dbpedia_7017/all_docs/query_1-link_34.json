        "text": "2. Vita: From mathematics to philosophy\n\nRené Thom, at several occasions, recounted some events from his childhood that are related to the shift that occurred later in his intellectual activity, from mathematics to philosophy. I have already commented on this in the long biography [40] that I devoted to him in the first chapter of the book [41]. In this section, I will give a short Vita of Thom, highlighting some episodes from his life that are connected with his journey from mathematics to philosophy.\n\nRené Thom was born in 1923 in Montbéliard, a small town in the East of France, now in the Burgundy-Franche-Comté region. The city was occupied by the Germans between 1940 and 1945, the period in which Thom was finishing secondary school and entering higher education. His parents owned a grocery store in Montbéliard. His father had a solid education, with a good knowledge of Latin, and he wrote poetry. Thom used to say that he gained his open-mindedness from having met people with very different backgrounds at the family grocery store. His parents encouraged him and his siblings to get a higher education.\n\nThom had the profile of a studious French schoolchild. From what he recounted, we know that he was not particularly brilliant at school, but some of his recollections from that period are harbingers of his life as a future mathematician, and I will mention some of them.\n\nThe first reminiscence dates from age ten or eleven, when Thom had set himself the task of systematically exploring what every theorem he knew on the geometry of three-dimensional space becomes in dimension four. He writes about this in an interview published in 1989 [38]:\n\n[This] was, if I may say so, my first attempt to do something original; but it was a way for me to understand, say, how a system of two planes in ℝ4superscriptℝ4\\mathbb{R}^{4} was made, etc., and I think I had arrived to a pretty good intuition at that time. I was already seeing in four-dimensional space.\n\nThe second fact I mention took place when Thom was thirteen or fourteen. We read in [44] that he came across a book on differential calculus in the public library of his hometown and was seduced by it. But Thom’s main interest was Euclidean geometry. He writes in [89, p. 10]: “I had a certain taste for Euclidean geometry which immediately attracted me very much.\" On the other hand, he had no taste for algebra, which, he says, was akin to certain automatisms. He later maintained this opinion on this field, a field which he considered “not very instructive\", and he kept his ardor for Euclidean geometry, “our old Euclidean geometry\", as he used to call it affectionately. On the same subject, he writes in [84]:\n\nThere was one encounter that was quite decisive, and this was with Euclidean geometry in the ninth and tenth grades, where I really developed a taste for geometric thinking and proof. I had made it a point of honor to find solutions to all conceivable problems in elementary geometry, in the geometry of the triangle, and this is why, since that time, I have kept a preference for Euclidean geometry that my colleagues and fellow mathematicians do not forgive me.\n\nBesides geometry, Thom was intrigued by dynamics. In the interview [38], he recalls his early interest and his motivation for this subject which, a few years later, became one of his favorite topics of reflection:\n\nAround age seventeen, I started being interested in dynamics. I don’t remember on what occasion it was, but I had handed in a paper to my mathematics teacher, where I talked about the eternal return seen from a dynamical point of view, the theories of the eternal return… It was the idea that one could have of a space-time, a universe in which there would be the eternal return, that is to say, where the dynamics would be periodic, but I believe that it was almost the first time that I really thought things in terms of dynamics.\n\nDuring his high-school years, Thom was equally fond of literature, poetry, history and science. He especially enjoyed reading Greek and Latin classical authors. In 1939, the question arose as to the choice of the second part of the baccalauréat. Thom hesitated between the literature curriculum (which, in France, was called the philosophy section) and the science one (called the elementary mathematics section). He opted for the second. He explained his choice in his interviews with Émile Noël [89, p. 9]:\n\nWe knew that this section offered more opportunities than the first one; it was perhaps an illusion, but we were convinced of that. Above all, we were in 1939, at the beginning of the war, and our parents, who had fought during the First World War, used to tell us: “try be a artilleryman, you are less exposed than in the infantry! \" To be an artilleryman, you had to have studied mathematics. This element probably weighed heavily in the birth of my mathematical vocation.\n\nThom obtained his baccalauréat 2ème partie in June 1940, in a lycée in Besançon, the large city close to Montbéliard. He was sixteen. The period was hard for the Thom family, as for many in Europe, because of the Second World War. Furthermore, in those years, studying at high school represented a major cost for families. Thom, as a gifted child from a modest background, had obtained a small government scholarship for his education. We read in an interview reported on by Michèle Porte [44] that Thom’s parents were really struggling to make their financial needs meet and to put their children through education.\n\nAfter his baccalauréat 2ème partie, Thom, together with his older brother, managed to cross the Swiss border, escaping from the Germans who had occupied Montbéliard and the region around it. Their stay in Switzerland was hard for they were penniless, and Thom recounts that they suffered there from starvation. With the help of the French authorities, the two brothers returned to France, and they ended up in Lyon, which was still in the free zone. There, with the help of a family friend, who at the same time was a remote cousin, René Thom enrolled again a high school, since he had nothing better to do, and he presented for the second time the baccalauréat 2ème partie, this time in the philosophy section.\n\nAfter Thom graduated anew from high school, the preparation of the competition for entering the École Normale Supérieure was a natural choice for a talented young man like him, interested in science, literature and philosophy. In France, such a preparation is offered by some selective high schools, and Thom was admitted at the Lycée Saint-Louis, a prestigious secondary institution in Paris. The preparation lasts in principle two years, in classes called classe de mathématiques supérieures and classe de mathématiques spéciales. Thom spent three years at the Lycée Saint-Louis, as his first attempt to enter the École Normale was unsuccessful and he had to repeat the year of mathématiques spéciales.\n\nAt several occasions, Thom recounted that right after he was admitted to the École Normale, he announced to the school director that rather than studying mathematics, his desire was to study philosophy of science, precisely, “in the path of Cavaillès and Lautman\". The acting director at that time was the physicist Georges Bruhat, who strongly advised Thom not to follow this path, saying that it would be more useful for him to concentrate his efforts on the preparation of the agrégation in mathematics, cf. [38].\n\nAt the end of this paper, I have included an appendix on the two philosophers of science Jean Cavaillès and Albert Lautman.\n\nThom’s teacher at the École Normale was Henri Cartan, who took him under his tutelage and who played later an important role for him, especially at the beginning of his career as a mathematician.\n\nThom finished his studies at the École in 1946, after having passed the competitive examination of the agrégation. On the recommendation of Cartan, he was appointed to the University of Strasbourg.\n\nThom was expected to submit a PhD thesis in the years that followed his appointment, and his first task was to find an appropriate research subject. He chose the field of algebraic topology. He explained later that it was easier for a beginner like him to work in a new discipline such as this one, where the ground to be explored was virgin and where there were still easily accessible open problems [92].\n\nThom’s work on cobordism, which was to ripen in his mind in the few years following his arrival in Strasbourg, inaugurated the implementation of the methods of differential topology in algebraic topology, so that the subject of topology of manifolds became a combination of the two, differential and algebraic topology. In fact, at the time Thom entered the field of topology, both points of view (the algebraic and the differential) were in a state of rapid expansion and were undergoing major transformations. Algebraic topology and the study of differentiable functions occupied Thom during his whole mathematical career. He obtained his doctoral degree in 1951, with a dissertation titled Espaces fibrés en sphères et carrés de Steenrod [49]. Cartan, who was officially Thom’s thesis advisor, became involved in this work after Thom had written a first version, in order to correct the writing and make it intelligible. Several letters exchanged between Thom and Cartan, edited by André Haefliger in the form of an article in volume I of Thom’s Mathematical Collected Works [98], concern the finalization of the writing of this thesis. The article contains excerpts from these letters, which show that Cartan strongly committed himself during the last months before the defense, to make the thesis understandable. The general impression that emerges from this correspondence, as well as from some letters dating from the previous year concerning a paper that Thom had submitted to Cartan for publication in the Comptes Rendus de l’Académie des Sciences (and which was eventually published in the proceedings of a conference), is that Cartan did not consider Thom capable of writing complete proofs. The correspondence between Thom and Cartan also shows that the latter consulted Samuel Eilenberg about Thom’s dissertation and that Eilenberg began by expressing serious reservations about the validity of the proofs. In particular, in a letter to Thom, Cartan writes that Eilenberg “believes that it is absolutely impossible to know whether the theorems in question are correct, and consequently he considers that it would be very imprudent to publish them as they are in a thesis, without a true proof.\" We note incidentally that among the changes that Cartan advised Thom to make to his thesis, he recommended the elimination of a complete chapter which seemed to him very unclear and almost impossible to make readable in order to defend the thesis in due time, hoping that Thom could at least work properly on the rest; in fact, this was a chapter on cobordism, a notion that Thom had introduced, and which became later the ground of the work for which he was awarded the Fields medal.\n\nFrom an exterior point of view, the years Thom spent in Strasbourg (1947-1963) were those of his purely mathematical activity. In his interviews Prédire n’est pas expliquer, talking about this period, he summarizes it as, in the first place, that of an abandonment of philosophy in favor of mathematics, and also a period ending with a passage to mathematics as a tool for the description of the real world. This is how mathematics is used in catastrophe theory, a theory which he started to develop under the name model theory, whose goal was to provide a mathematical framework to ideas from all domains of knowledge, including the physical, social and biological ones. He writes [89, p. 24]:\n\nFrom 1950 on, I abandoned these philosophical preoccupations to devote myself to mathematics. This lasted until 1956-1957. Then I went through a phase of depression: progress in mathematics was made by others. They led to theories so algebraically complicated that I could not follow them anymore. I gave up. …But one must still do something! So I started to look for possible applications of the mathematical theories I knew. That is how I oriented myself towards catastrophe theory.\n\nBy the end of his stay in Strasbourg, Thom came across Christopher Zeeman’s article Topology of the brain, an article which opened for him the door to new possibilities of representing the phenomena of life by mathematical models. He writes in his introductory talk of the 1982 symposium Logos and Catastrophe Theory [84]:\n\nThe idea of biological modeling, I owe it to a certain extent to Christopher Zeeman who, in 61, had published an article called Topology of the brain, where he had shown the great theoretical possibilities of mathematical modeling of the most complex biological activities. I was very impressed by this article at the time.\n\nAt the Edinburg ICM (14-21 August 1958), Thom was awarded the Fields medal for his work on cobordism. Later, he described this problem as “to know when two manifolds can be deformed into each other without having singularities at any moment in this deformation\". He considered that he had partially solved this problem. Concerning the prize itself, he declared in the interview Paraboles et catastrophes [85, p. 23]: “It was a bit of a good fortune. I seized the right moment by being able to exploit the techniques that Cartan, Ehresmann, Serre and many others had taught me.\" He wrote in his autobiographical article [11] that ultimately, this prize left him with a bitter taste, because the work done was too little, compared to what others did after him. “In this sense”, he says, “this prize represented for me a certain fragility that the future made even more visible. The consequence, if there was one, was only the invitation to the new Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques.\" Indeed, Thom was offered a research position at this newly founded institute. In [89, p. 27], he writes:\n\nI left Strasbourg and came, answering the call of the founder of the IHÉS. I had more leisure time, I was less preoccupied with teaching and administrative tasks. My purely mathematical productivity seemed to be on the wane and I began to focus more on the periphery, i.e., possible applications.\n\nIn addition to optics, I wondered if there were some possible applications to biology. I finally understood where these exceptional singularities came from: they are linked to the fact that the trajectories of light rays are special, because they satisfy a variational principle, Fermat’s principle; they have special properties that make caustics “catch\" singularities more easily than they should. It is the transfer of this idea that led me to the theory of catastrophes, to the mathematical part that leads to it.\n\nThom declared at several occasions that his interest in forms arose from his observation of caustics.\n\nThom later had another “revelation\", during a visit to the Poppelsdorfer museum in Bonn, when he saw plaster cast models of the various phases of the development of a frog embryo in the process of gastrulation. In particular, he noticed that some lines in these representations were, from the mathematical point of view, singularities that were familiar to him and he realized that the whole process may be interpreted using topology and geometry. He gave an interpretation of this beautiful geometry in terms of the unfolding of a wave front in an appropriate space that projects onto the ordinary space and later, he described all the process of development of the frog as a sequence of successive unfoldings of a singularity. This was the starting point for the application of his ideas on singularity theory to embryology [89, p. 111].\n\nThom’s stay in Strasbourg lasted from 1947 to 1963, with a few breaks for visits he made to the United States, each for several weeks, and an interruption during the academic year 1953-1954, which he spent in Grenoble.\n\nThom introduced the word catastrophe in his book Stabilité structurelle et morphogénèse (1972), to denote an abrupt phenomenon that appears and disappears continuously. The work quickly became the reference for the theory that became known under the name Catastrophe theory. Speaking of this theory, Thom recalls the role of the optical experiments he conducted in 1959-1960 in Strasbourg as an impetus. He declares in his interview [89, p. 26]:\n\nI came to [catastrophe theory] in a rather natural way: it was an evolution that led me, starting from a purely mathematical problem, the one called the generic singularities of a map, to see whether this theorem had physical applications. I was then at the University of Strasbourg and I had the opportunity to do some optical experiments. A colleague, who was a physicist, lent me some instruments, a spherical mirror, a prism and a dioptre. I was able to produce some caustics, and I made them vary by changing a little bit the position of the parameters; I observed how they were deformed. That is precisely the thing that interested me. […] From there I started the theory of catastrophes: I realized that there were types, variations of caustics, that I did not foresee, and that I had to explain to myself the appearance of these singularities. It took me two or three years to understand where this came from. This is a banal phenomenon, but that is where I started from.\n\nOptical caustics are curves that appear as envelopes of a beam of light rays reflected in a curved mirror. Later, in 1991, in his lecture titled Leaving mathematics for philosophy [91], Thom recalled that his first surprise during his experiments on optics was to see that the caustics obtained using a spherical mirror or a linear diopter give rise to singularities that he had not expected to see.\n\nIn 1961, during one of his trips to the United States, Thom met Salomon Lefschetz, who was working on structural stability, a notion that was introduced in the 1930s by Aleksandr Andronov and Lev Pontryagin. Several years later, in his introductory talk of the 1982 conference Logos et théorie des catastrophes (Logos and catastrophe theory) [84], Thom wrote, regarding Lefschetz : “He understood very well the crucial importance of this notion and he did a lot to develop this theory in the Western circles.\" Later on, Thom used this concept in a decisive way in his mathematical and philosophical work, and it became a central element of his theory of morphogenesis. In fact, the title of his first book, published in 1972, whose aim is to provide a mathematical formalism to tackle general morphogenesis problems, is precisely Stabilité structurelle et morphogénèse [58]. He writes in the introduction: “This book is the first systematic attempt to think in geometrical and topological terms the problems of biological regulation, as well as those posed by the structural stability of any form.\" Thom, whose main objective became to understand form in nature, considered that only structurally stable morphologies and phenomena can be understood. He even tried to formalize thermodynamics using the notion of structural stability, although he realized later on that he failed, and that some weaker notion of structural stability was needed.\n\nLet me make a parenthetical remark, concerning physics regarded by philosophers from Greek Antiquity, since, as we shall recall below, Thom often referred to them. Plato considered that there cannot be any knowledge of nature, that is, that physics does not exist, since the physical world is permanently subject to change, and it is impossible to have a real knowledge of something which is perpetually changing. Aristotle, on the contrary, in his Physics, was puzzled by evolution, and by things that are changing. His Physics is precisely a physics of motion and of change. Structurally stable phenomena makes a compromise between changing and unchanging objects. A dynamical system is structurally stable if, at each moment of its evolution, there is an interval of time around this moment such that the system obtained at any given time in this interval is identical to the original system.\n\nThom’s main philosophical program, that of describing nature and language in geometric terms, is already largely initiated in his book Stabilité structurelle et morphogénèse (1972). He writes in the Preamble: “This is a work that wishes to place itself in the line of a deceased discipline, namely Natural philosophy,\" and the reference to Aristotle is clear. A good half of this book is devoted to questions of embryology, where Thom proposes a formulation of this field using a geometric language.\n\nIn his second book, titled Modèles mathématiques de la morphogenèse [60], published in 1974, Thom defines morphogenesis as “the creative or destructive process of forms\" [60, p. 10]. Thom declares that his research on morphogenesis is based on two sources: on the one hand, his research in differential topology on structural stability, and on the other hand, his reading of embryology treatises. He considered that the applications of the theory he proposes go far beyond embryology and even biology, to include subjects such as physical chemistry, optics, hydrodynamics and others.\n\nAt IHÉS, Thom continued publishing on mathematics, but not in a classical style, that is, not on new theorems and proofs. Most of his mathematical works were addressed to biologists, philosophers, linguists and other non-mathematicians, and some of these articles were published in philosophical journals. Thom declared later that his drift towards biology and the other sciences was due in part to the presence of Alexander Grothendieck at IHÉS. He writes on this subject, in an autobiographical text [11, p. 82]:\n\n[…] Relations with my colleague Grothendieck were less agreeable for me. His technical superiority was crushing. His seminar attracted the whole of Parisian mathematics, whereas I had nothing to offer. That made me leave the strictly mathematical world and tackle more general notions, like the theory of morphogenesis, a subject which interested me more and more and led me towards a very general form of “philosophical\" biology. The director, L. Motchane, had no objection (or if he did he kept it for himself). And so I ran what was known as a “crazy\" seminar, which lasted the best part of my first year at the institute. Three or four years passed, during which I returned to Aristotle and classical Greek.\n\n7. Aristotelian biology\n\nLike Aristotle, Thom was the philosopher of biology. And basically, biology, from Thom’s point of view, was not far from topology, nor from philosophy: “The great problem of biology,\" he says in a 1992 interview on catastrophe theory [92], “is the relationship between the local and the global. Knowing the organism, why the organs have this or that property at this point and not another, etc., that is the big problem\". He then adds:\n\nThe problem of the relation between the local and the global is a problem that is essentially philosophical, that has to do with extent; this problem is the object of topology. Topology is essentially the study of the means to make the junction between a known local situation and a global property to be found, or vice versa: knowing a global property of space, find the local properties, around each point. There is a kind of deep methodological unity between topology and biology.\n\nIn his article Les mathématiques et l’intelligible (The mathematics of the intelligible) (1975) [62], Thom introduces what he calls mathematical thought in the context of biology and anthropology, a thought that, according to him, goes beyond the usual language in describing external phenomena with their mixture of determinism and indeterminism.\n\nChapter 5 of Thom’s Esquisse is titled The general plan of animal organization. It is in the lineage of the zoological treatises of Aristotle, expressed in the language of modern topology. Thom writes in the introduction: “This presentation might be called an essay in transcendental anatomy; by this I mean that animal organization will be considered here only from the topologists’ abstract point of view.\" He adds: “We shall be concerned with ideal animals, stylized images of existing animals, leaving aside all considerations of quantitative size and biochemical composition, to retain only those inter-organic relations that have a topological and functional character.\" In §B of the same chapter, Thom returns to Aristotle’s notion of homeomerous and anhomeomerous, in relation with the stratification of an animal’s organism, formulating in a modern topological language the condition for two organisms to have the same organisation. Aristotle considers this notion at the beginning of the History of Animals [4]: “Regarding the parts of the animals, some are non-composite: these are those which can be divided into homeomers, like flesh is divided into flesh; others are composed: these are those which can be divided into anhomeomers; the hand, for example, cannot be divided into hands, nor the face into faces.\" Thom explains that a homeomerous part of an animal (´ομοιομερής) has generally a boundary structure constituted by anhomeomerous parts, which implies that the substrate of a homeomerous part is, topologically speaking, not closed. Mathematics, philosophy and biology are intermingled in this interpretation of a living organism, following Aristotle, with formulae like: “The opposition homeomerous-anhomeomerous is a ‘representation’ (a homomorphic image) of the metaphysical opposition: potentiality-act. As the anhomeomerous is part of the boundary of a homeomerous of one dimension higher, we recover a case of the application of act as boundary of the potentiality.\" [75, p. 400].\n\nIn Thom’s words, an animal organism is a three-dimensional ball O𝑂O equipped with a stratification which is finite provided we neglect the details that are too fine. For example, when we consider the vascular system, we may take into account only the elements that can be seen with the naked eye: arterioles and veinlets. Seen from this point of view, the homeomerous parts are the three-dimensional strata: blood, flesh, the inside of bones, etc., the two-dimensional strata are the membranes: skin, mucous membrane, periosteum, intestinal wall, walls of the blood vessels, articulation surfaces, etc., the one-dimensional strata are the nerves: vessel axes, hairs, etc., and the zero-dimensional strata are the points of junction between the one-dimensional strata or the punctual singularities: corners of the lips, ends of hairs, etc.\n\nThis leads Thom to the definition of two organisms O𝑂O and O′superscript𝑂′O^{\\prime} “to have the same organisation\" by the existence of a homeomorphism h:O→O′:ℎ→𝑂superscript𝑂′h:O\\to O^{\\prime} that preserves this stratification.\n\nThom also developed his ideas on the stratification of an animal body in the series of lectures given in 1988 at the Solignac Abbey [55]. On p. 7 of these notes, he addresses the question of when two animals have isomorphic stratifications, and he uses for that the notion of isotopy between stratified spaces: Two sets E1,E2subscript𝐸1subscript𝐸2E_{1},E_{2} have isotopic stratifications if there exists a stratification of the product E×[0,1]𝐸01E\\times[0,1] such that the canonical projection p:E×[0,1]→[0,1]:𝑝→𝐸0101p:E\\times[0,1]\\to[0,1] is of rank one on every stratum of E𝐸E, with E1=p−1​(1)subscript𝐸1superscript𝑝11E_{1}=p^{-1}(1) and E2=p−1​(2)subscript𝐸2superscript𝑝12E_{2}=p^{-1}(2). He considers that this notion is implicitly used by Aristotle in his classification of the animals, insisting on the fact that the latter neglected all the quantitative differences and was only interested in the qualitative ones.\n\nThom also talks about stratification in Aristotle in chapter 5 of his Esquisse, a chapter titled The general plan of animal organization, in relation with the notion of homeomerous introduced by the Stagirite. He gives this idea of stratification in biology an official status in his work, by defining his phenomenological equivalence relation, a relation which at the same time allows us to take a new look at Aristotle’s classification of the elements of a living body. He writes in his article Structure et fonction en biologie aristotélicienne [87], that this allows “the identification of two anomalies by an isotopy between stratifications, either according to genus, or refined according to species.\"\n\nIn relation with Aristotle’s classification of the parts of the animals, and more generally of a general plan of animal organisms, Thom revived a famous controversy that took place in 1830 between Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and Cuvier, in which the former used a purely geometrical classification principle of animal organs whereas the latter defended criteria based only on function; see [53], an article in which Thom proposes an approach to this dilemma using catastrophe theory.\n\nGenericity is another idea that Thom finds in Aristotle’s biology. He declares in his 1992 interview La théorie des catastrophes [92] that Aristotle considered that what matters in the study of nature is not to know everything that can happen, but everything that happens most often. In the Metaphysics, as in other texts, the Philosopher speaks at length about the difference between what happens most often and what is only an accident (ςυμβεβηϰ´ος). He writes in particular that all science is either about what is always or what is most often; otherwise, he says, how could one learn or teach others? Thom establishes a parallel between this and the theory of singularities: we study generic singularities, and those can be classified; their number is. There are important pathological singularities, but since they are not generic, the general theory does not deal with them.\n\nIn the series of interviews To predict is not to explain, Thom returns to the homological Stokes formula d2=0superscript𝑑20d^{2}=0 and to its biological interpretation in terms of Aristotelian zoology: “The boundary of the boundary is empty; this is the great axiom of topology, of differential geometry in mathematics, but it expresses the spatial integrity of the edge of the organism.\" [89, p. 111]\n\nThom spent some time trying to teach biologists the fundamental notions of topology that he thought they may need. Several sessions of the courses he gave at Solignac were devoted to this subject [55]. His 1982 lecture Les réels et le calcul différentiel, ou la mathématique essentielle [86] at the École Normale contains a summary of what is needed for the biologist as a minimal mathematical background.\n\nIn the next section, we talk more about the status of singularities in Thom’s philosophical system.\n\n12. A metaphysics of analogy\n\nIn the 1970s, Thom started a systematic use of analogies and metaphors in his writings. In fact, his approach to phenomena of science and morphology as taking place in an abstract substrate favored an extensive use of analogy. He declares in the interview To predict is not to explain [89, p. 122]: “There could be science only if we immerse the real in a controlled virtual. And it is through the extension of the real into a larger virtual that one can study the constraints that define the propagation of the real within that virtual.\" On a related subject, talking about the notion of “boundary”, he declares in another interview: “To reach the limits of what is possible, you have to dream the impossible, and it is really the interface between the possible and the impossible that is important because if we know it, we know exactly the limits of our power\" [38].\n\nIn the field of analogy, Thom considered himself once again the heir of Aristotle. In a 1976 conference, titled Le statut épistémologique de la théorie des catastrophes [64], he writes that “the simple fact of being able to classify analogous situations is a considerable achievement: there has been no theory of analogy since Aristotle.\" Later, in the interview titled La théorie des catastrophes (1992) [92], he declares that catastrophe theory is “a theory of analogy\", the first, of such breadth, since Aristotelian logic.\n\nFrom a strictly mathematical point of view, the word “analogia\" is used by Euclid in the Elements to denote an equality between two ratios. Thom quotes at several occasions Aristotle’s example of analogy saying that old age is to life the same thing as evening is to day, in the form of an equality between two ratios:\n\nold​agelife=eveningday.oldagelifeeveningday\\frac{\\mathrm{old\\ age}}{\\mathrm{life}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{evening}}{\\mathrm{day}}.\n\nFrom this follows the metaphor: “old age is the evening of life\". In the same passage, Aristotle writes: “The cup is to Bacchus what the shield is to Mars. We shall therefore say: “the shield, cup of Mars\", and “the cup, shield of Bacchus\".\n\nIn his Esquisse d’une sémiophysique and in other works, Thom highlighted Aristotle’s analogies concerning animals. Let us especially mention an analogy that Aristotle makes in his Parts of the Animals (668a10-13), comparing the vascular system of an animal to an irrigation channel in a garden. Thom emphasized this analogy in his 1988 lectures titled Structure and Function in Aristotelian Biology [87]. Among the other examples of analogies made by Aristotle are the one between the organization of the parts of an animal and the political organization of the city (Politics, 1290b25-35), the one saying that sight is to the body what intelligence is to the soul (Nicomachean Ethics, 1096b28), the one saying that the soul is to the body what the pilot is to the ship (De Anima, 413 a 8-9), the one saying that the scale is to the fish what the feather is to the bird (History of Animals, 486b15), and there are many others. Thom, on several occasions, spoke of an analogy between the development of the embryo and that of a Taylor series function. I have commented on other instances of analogy as a method of thinking in the works of Aristotle and Thom in my article [42].\n\nThom also talked about Aristotle’s theory of analogy in terms of boundary. He writes in [89, p. 75]:\n\nAnalogy is not something arbitrary. Analogy, or metaphor, contrary to the common vision that makes it something approximate, fuzzy, appears to me as a strict relation that, in many cases, we can express mathematically, even if this mathematical expression in itself is not interesting in the mental process that makes you consider the analogy.\n\nIn the same passage, speaking again of Aristotle’s analogy between evening with respect to day, and old age with respect to life, he writes: “The formal structure of this analogy is simply the notion of boundary. You have here a time interval; this interval has an end; one calls ‘evening’ or ‘old age’ the tubular neighborhood, if I dare say of the word ‘end’, and the corresponding catastrophe is, for me, a fold.\"\n\nConcerning the general role of analogy in science, Thom writes, in his article The twofold way of catastrophe theory [63] that this role is very much contested and that it is the object of a vast misunderstanding among professional scientists, most of whom—imbued with a positivist spirit—see it as a source of illusion, claiming that science must be quantitative whereas analogy is a qualitative thought. He reminds the reader that Konrad Lorenz, the famous biologist, in his reception speech of the Nobel Prize, stated that in a certain sense, all analogies are true, by definition. Thom, more precisely, distinguishes two cases of analogies: a “mathematically formalized analogy, associated with an organizing catastrophe\", which is always “true, but can be sterile (it can only generate more or less poetic metaphors)\", and a “partial\" analogy, whose algebraization is incomplete, and he says about the latter: “It is precisely by striving to specify an analogy that one can come across interesting data; it is the incompleteness of the analogy that offers the best possibilities of synthesis. It is only because we accept the risk of error that we can reap new discoveries.\"\n\nConcerning analogy, I would like also to mention Kurt Gödel, whom Thom often quoted for having shown that a formal system of arithmetic is either inconsistent or incomplete. Gödel made an analogy between this formal side of mathematics and a rigid human society. In a draft letter to David Scurlock, quoted by Pierre Cassou-Noguès in his book Les Démons de Gödel : Logique et folie (Gödel’s Demons: Logic and Madness) [14, p. 164], Gödel writes that one may expect from a society without any freedom at all (i.e., proceeding in everything according to strict rules of “conformity\") to be either inconsistent or incomplete in its behavior, i.e., unable to solve certain problems, perhaps of vital importance. He also says that a similar remark can be applied to human beings individually.\n\nTalking about metaphor, I cannot but point out the collection of articles Mathematics as metaphor by Manin [35].\n\n14. Conclusion\n\nThom was a singular figure in the history of mathematics, and one of his important contributions was to challenge all dogmas, especially those of science. The fact that he had shifted his focus to philosophy and the consequences of this change were not understood by most of his colleagues: criticisms were voiced here and there, by mathematicians and others, even though the Fields medal assured him an immunity from any dispute of his mathematical talents.\n\nIt is not surprising that some colleagues of Thom considered his philosophical reflections as delirium. Some of the criticisms that came from the mathematical community were deeply unfair. In the introduction to his book on catastrophe theory [9], Vladimir Arnold writes (p. viii):\n\nNeither in 1965 nor later was I ever able to understand a word of Thom’s own talks on catastrophes. He once described them to me (in French?) as “bla-bla-bla\", when I asked him, in the early seventies, whether he had proved his announcements. Even today, I don’t know whether Thom’s statements on the topological classification of bifurcations in gradient dynamical systems depending on four parameters are true. […] Nor am I able to discuss other, more philosophical or poetical declarations by Thom, formulated so as to make it impossible to decide whether they are true or false (in a manner typical rather of medieval science before Descartes or (the) Bacon(s)).\n\nThom did not waver, but deep down, the reactions to his ideas hurt him. He wrote in La science malgré tout (Science despite everything) [61] (1965):\n\nIt used to be fashionable—and probably still is—in scientific circles, to rave about philosophy. And yet, who could deny that the only really important problems for man are philosophical problems? But philosophical problems, being the most important ones, are also the most difficult ones; in this field, to show originality is very difficult, a fortiori to discover a new truth. This is why the society, very wisely, has given up subsidizing research on philosophical subjects, where the profit is too uncertain, to devote its efforts to scientific research, where, thank God, it is not necessary to be a genius to do a “useful work\".\n\nDid the community of philosophers understand Thom? In some sense, the answer is simple: unlike the situation in mathematics, there is no philosophical community. In his article Leaving mathematics for philosophy, [91], Thom explains that in philosophy, things are not as simple as in mathematics: there are schools, cliques, etc.\n\nRegardless of his involvement in philosophy, Thom had a personal view on mathematics and on mathematicians and why we do mathematics, which he expressed sometimes in a very metaphorical mode. In his paper De l’icône au symbole. Esquisse d’une théorie du symbolisme (From icon to symbol. A sketch of a theory of symbolism)[54], he writes:\n\nI would like to see the mathematician as a perpetual newborn babbling in front of nature; only those who know how to listen to Mother Nature’s answer will later manage to open a dialogue with her, and to master a new language. The others only babble, buzzing in the void — bombinans in vacuo. And where, you may ask, could the mathematician hear the answer of nature? The voice of reality is in the sense of the symbol.\n\nManin is among the mathematicians who understood Thom’s approach since the beginning. In his contribution to Kyoto’s ICM (1990), he writes [34]:\n\n[…] What is relevant is the imbalance between various basic values which is produced by the emphasis on proof. Proof itself is a derivative of the notion of “truth.\" There are a lot of values besides truth, among them “activities,\" “beauty\" and “understanding,\" which are essential in the high school teaching and later. Neglecting precisely these values, a teacher (or a university professor) tragically fails. Unfortunately, this also is not universally recognized. A sociological analysis of the controversies around Catastrophe Theory of René Thom shows that exactly the shift of orientation from formal proof to understanding provoked such a sharp criticism. But of course, Catastrophe Theory is one of the developed mathematical metaphors and should only be judged as such.\n\nIn any case, Thom felt out of step with the mathematical milieu of his time, which was rather very monolithic. He writes [85, p. 29]:\n\nI never really thought of myself as a mathematician. In fact, a mathematician must have, in my opinion, a taste for difficulty, for beautiful, rich and deep structures. I do not have that taste at all. The ultra-refined structures that fascinate my colleagues—Lie groups, simple finite groups, etc., in short, all these kinds of mathematical mythologies— have never really interested me. On the other hand, I like things that move, flexible things that I can transform to my liking. I prefer the field of mathematics where one does not really know what he is doing! This is the reason why I consider mathematics today with a certain detachment, and I cannot say whether there is currently a strictly mathematical problem for which I have a deep interest.\n\nThom declared several times that even though he became a mathematician by accident, mathematics brought him great satisfaction. In the interview [89], he says: “Really, when one has found a theorem in his lifetime, he can tell that he participated in a certain form of immortality, whatever he did. An illusion perhaps, but among all the fictitious immortalities by which we are deluded, this is still one of the most solid\" [89, p. 73]. In the article La science malgré tout[61], he writes: “I know only one really difficult science: mathematics.”\n\nAppendix: Jean Cavaillès and Albert Lautman\n\nLet me say a few words on the two philosophers of science, Jean Cavaillès (1903-1944) and Albert Lautman (1908-1944) to whom Thom was attracted as a young student.\n\nCavaillès is the author of an important philosophical corpus on the foundations of mathematics in which the stress is on a dynamical evolution of these foundations. Among the multitude of philosophical schools of the first half of the 20th century, Cavaillès was situated between Hilbert’s formalism and Brouwer’s intuitivism, a trend that he used to call “modified formalism\". He was close to the mathematician Émile Borel, one of the French representatives of the “semi-intuitionist\" current. As a matter of fact, in 1940, Cavaillès wrote an authoritative synthesis of Borel’s theory of the quantification of chance [15], which constitutes the latter’s point of view on the philosophy of probability theory expressed in Vol. IV of his Traité du calcul des probabilités et de ses applications [13]. The volume is titled Valeur pratique et philosophie des probabilités [13].\n\nCavaillès taught at the École Normale Supérieure before Thom entered there. His philosophical work, which was in part the result of a close collaboration with Emmy Neother, had a non-negligible impact on the mathematical research done at the École.\n\nLautman had been Cavaillès’s student at the École Normale. In 1937, he defended a doctoral dissertation, in two parts, the first one titled Essai sur les notions de structure et d’existence en mathématiques (Essay on the notions of structure and existence in mathematics), and the second one, Essai sur l’unité des sciences mathématiques dans leur développement actuel (Essay on the unity of the mathematical sciences in their present development). Following the path of Cavaillès (and before him, that of Poincaré), Lautman considered that both the formalist and the intuitionist movements were a failure. He was an advocate of structuralism in the tradition of Bourbaki. He was a promoter of the concept of unity of mathematics, see the collection of articles [28].\n\nCavailles and Lautman found the sources of their theories in the recent developments in mathematics and physics (notably quantum physics). They both wondered about the role and the consequences of the various movements of thought that had appeared at the end of the 19th century on the philosophy of mathematics (conventionalism, logicism, constructivism, formalism, etc.). Even if they diverged on some points, and in particular on the organization of mathematics as a system of thought, they both considered that the philosophy of mathematics must necessarily be at the center of any metaphysical theory, as it was already for Plato, Heidegger and other philosophers. Their work is an embodiment of this approach. Both Cavailles and Lautman had close relations with mathematicians of the Bourbaki group such as Cartan, Chevalley, Dieudonné, Ehresmann, and Weil and they were very much interested in Boubaki’s project of writing complete treatises on the foundations of several topics in mathematics.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Lautman et Cavaillès joined the resistance to the German occupation of France. They were both shot by the Nazis in 1944. The first was 36 years old and the second 40.\n\nThe French Society of Philosophy devoted its session of February 4, 1939 to the discussion of Cavaillès and Lautman’s works. Several mathematicians, including Henri Cartan, Paul Dubreuil, Paul Lévy, Maurice Fréchet, Charles Ehresmann and Claude Chabauty, were present at that session. A report on this session was published after the liberation of France, in the Bulletin de la Société française de philosophie [27] (1946). Thom may have been present at this debate, but being still too young, his name is not mentioned in the Annals."
