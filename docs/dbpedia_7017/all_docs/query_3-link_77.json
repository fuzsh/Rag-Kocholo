The decision to organize the 1908 International Congress of Mathematicians in Rome (after those in Paris and Heidelberg) confirmed this position. Qualified Italian universities were permanently included in the tour organized for young mathematicians’ improvement. Even in the years after the First World War, Rome (together with Paris and Göttingen) remained an important mathematical center according to the American mathematician G. D. Birkhoff. Now, after almost a century, we can state that the golden age of Italian mathematics reduces to the decades between the 19th and the 20th century. In the centre of interest stood the algebraic geometry school with Guido Calstelnuovo, Federico Enriques and Francesco Severi acting as key figures. Their work led to an almost complete systematization of the theory of curves to the complete classification of the surfaces and to the bases of a general theory of algebraic varieties. Other important contributions came from the Italian school of analysis. Its main representative was Vito Volterra – an outstanding analyst with a strong interest in mathematical physics – who produced important results in real analysis and the theory of integral equations and contributed to the initiation of functional analysis. Guiseppe Vitali, Guido Fubini and Leonida Tonelli were well known in the integration theory and the calculus of variations. At the beginning of the century Tulli LeviCivita’s scientific adventure started: He became one of the most recognized and esteemed Italian mathematicians abroad. There also was a strong connection between the authority in the scientific disciplines and the role they could play for the future and the modernization of Italy. In chapter 1 we describe this thrilling season of Italian mathematics. The golden age however, is only the prologue of our history. We will focus our attention to the years between the two World Wars. The turning point during those years was marked by the Great War – it was an epochal change. Nothing remained as it was before. The ingenuous hope that the war could simply be a gap of time and afterwards one could come back to the belle époque were illusions. In chapter 2 we analyze the changes in Italian mathematics. From a strict mathematical point of view the twenties and the thirties were less stimulating for Italy than the previous ones, but from the context of the whole century they were attractive on other sides: The social and political situation suddenly changed with the raise of the fascist regime (chapter 4). Also structural scientific aspects changed with the creation of new institutions which should play an important role in the development of Italian science and mathematics for the rest of the century. In chapter 3 we describe the birth of UMI (Italian Mathematical Union) and of CNR (National Research Council); in the chapters 6 and 8 we deal with the consecutive presence of INAC and of Severi’s INDAM.\n\nvi\n\nPreface\n\nNaturally the next step is to consider whether there was any link between the changes in the political and scientific spheres and if these influenced the organization of the mathematical research, its contents and its quality level. We can describe the main problems dealt with by our analysis in a more detailed manner. In the period between the two World Wars the leading actors of Italian mathematics were rather the same as before. Perhaps the most relevant difference was the arrival of Mauro Picone on the scene. His presence was particularly noticeable in a numerical and applied perspective and also in the ideas that guided the creation and the development of INAC – an absolute novelty in the international mathematical panorama. Even if the names were rather the same, their role had changed. Volterra’s brilliant career was stopped by fascism, and so the old liberal generation was marginalized by the new government. Severi became piece by piece the head of the mathematical group. We dedicate the chapter 3 and 5 to this leadership change. Like Volterra, Severi was an outstanding mathematician and a broad-minded man, and his personality was charismatic, even if different in the coherence of his behaviour patterns. His leadership should remain till the Second World War. There should be some tensions – see chapter 6: the alternative of the CNR – but in the thirties Italian mathematics grew with a sufficient continuity (chapter 7). It needed another external event, the tragical experience of the Second World War to induce a new discontinuity in the Italian mathematical life (chapter 8). The mathematical research itself was always at a good level. The influence of Italian researchers on algebraic geometry was a strong one. Enriques contributed some important historical studies to his research in this field. The “old lion”, Volterra, wrote a last relevant chapter in his scientific career by analyzing population dynamics. Tonelli’s Fondamenti di Calcolo delle Variazioni were published and his esteem – about all for the use of direct methods – was high in the mathematical world. Picone’s influence has already been described. Some other young brilliant scholars joined the already acknowledged researchers: Renato Caccioppoli, Lamberti Cesari, Francesco Tricomi and others. Another young man, Bruno de Finetti, increased the suspense of the probabilistic studies and anchored a research directed towards economic and social applications. Not to forget the undoubted authority of Levi-Civita and the role he played by corresponding with Einstein and many younger colleagues. Nevertheless this survey makes a clear statement: for Italian mathematics the golden age was on the retreat. Its potential did never return after the First World War. Not quite a crisis but rather the difficulty to maintain the previously excellent level and to continue in playing a role in originality and creativity. On the contrary the orthodox respect towards a still young tradition and the acceptance of a level just achieved seemed to prevail. The new abstract and algebraic languages did not speak Italian any more. They were born in situations where the weight of tradition was lower and we could speak of a decline of Italian mathematics with respect to its level 30-40 years before compared to the new languages that were developing in the other countries between the wars. This is the point where the two histories – the Italian and the mathematical one – met. The conditions and the progress of Italian mathematics are analyzed by focusing on both the inner and the external influences. Is there any link between the establishment of\n\nPreface\n\nvii\n\na dictatorial regime and the decline of Italian mathematics? Can we find this possible link in the most repressive fascism facts – the 1931 oath and the 1938 racial laws – or rather in its politics towards science and particularly in its attitude in favour of the applied sciences? In the following pages we will try to give an answer to these questions by analyzing the most important works of the Italian mathematicians living in the period, the life of the Italian mathematical community, some correspondence of the most representative members of it and their positions outside the research or educational fields. But our interest goes beyond the historical facts of the period between the two World Wars and its influences on the present problems. So the previous questions have a “modern” version too. Can the scientific world accept – and at which conditions – a confrontation with the political power or is it necessary to avoid these contaminations? Which are the possibilities of the political sphere to orient the trends of the scientific developments? And in the particular case of mathematics? How can a political will overcome the constraints imposed by the economic structure? In the light of the episode of the oath and the silence of too many mathematicians at the sight of the racial laws, which are the ethic and political responsibilities of a researcher? As one can see, the questions are numerous. We just hope to give a contribution in answering them through the analysis of Italian mathematics between the two World Wars.

In that year the various nation-states into which the Italian peninsula had been politically and administratively divided were unified in a process called the Risorgimento. Under the leadership of Piedmont (the northwestern region of Italy on the French border, whose capital is Turin) and its hegemony, a remarkable idealistic and democratic impulse with significant popular support led to the unification of the country. Yet, a number of uprisings, two wars of independence against Austria (1848–9 and 1859, the latter of which was fought with crucial help by France), and intense diplomatic activity, were still necessary to achieve this goal. Some of the mathematicians whom we shall shortly present, who will figure prominently in this prologue, participated in the military mobilisation for these wars of independence, particularly in the years 1848 to 18591. Enrico Betti was a volunteer in a student battalion from the University of Pisa. In 1848, Luigi Cremona participated in the defence of Venice, which had rebelled against Austrian rule and was given the rank of corporal and later that of sergeant. Francesco Brioschi participated in 1848 in the insurrection of Milan against the Austrians and in 1870 in the storming of Rome. In 1860 the peninsula had not yet been completely unified. The Veneto region (in the north-east of Italy) was still under the sway of Austria. It would only be annexed to the new Italian state after the third war of independence (1866). In particular, Rome was still ruled by the papacy. In this case, public, political and diplomatic issues were of much greater complexity. It would only be in 1870 that the Italian government could overcome the temporal power of the papacy. On this occasion it exploited the opportunities offered by the difficulties faced by the Vatican’s erstwhile ally, France, in the aftermath of the FrancoPrussian war, the fall of Napoleon III and the end of the Second Empire. The annexation of Rome by the Italian state would usher in a long period of difficulties in its relationship with 1\n\nAs for the commitment of Italian mathematicians during the Risorgimento, see: Universitari Italiani nel Risorgimento (ed. by L.

Vittorio Emanuele II thus became the first king of Italy. The capital of the newly founded state, initially established in Turin, was subsequently moved to Florence following the Italo-French agreements of 1864. Actually, this was a step towards making Rome the capital, as it was considered the historical and ideal centre of the Country. Rome was finally made the capital of Italy in 1870. The next fifty years, before Italy’s entry into the First World War, can be characterized as full of intense efforts to weld the country into a nation, with infrastructures, standards of living and vital statistics as close as possible to the more developed nation states. The initiatives taken to modernize agriculture and to industrialize the economy\n\nPrologue\n\n3\n\nwere held back markedly by the great differences between different regions of the country. The situation in the South, the so-called southern question, was particularly critical from the social and economic viewpoint. The north of Italy benefited from a much more solid economic and social base. In the last two decades of the 19th century, a bourgeoisie began to develop here which would progressively influence city styles and customs. The consolidation of a bourgeoisie would be accompanied by a similar development of the working class, mainly concentrated in the Milan-Turin-Genoa triangle. The mathematicians were in the front-line of this process of nation building, occupying significant political and administrative positions. Just to mention some of the names cited above, both Brioschi and Betti would become parliamentarians, senators and undersecretaries in the Ministry of Education (in the years 1861–2 and 1874–6, respectively). Cremona was appointed the Minister for Education in 1899, even if only for one month. Brioschi, in particular, was a key protagonist in establishing an education system that reflected the outlook of the new entrepreneurial bourgeoisie, which was consolidating in the north of Italy in opposition to a lazy and passive landowning class. The expectations of this emerging class that scientific progress and its technological fallout would nurture and accelerate the industrial development of Italy are paralleled in the mindset of scientists and the culture of scientific research. In particular, they were reflected in the perspectives mathematicians envisaged for their teaching and research. This common world view formed the motivating factor behind the establishment of the Polytechnic of Milan, founded in 1863 by Brioschi with the intention of creating a class of qualified technicians indispensable for the rise of Italy’s industrial initiatives. In short, during the first half-century of its existence as a unified nation state, Italy went through a period which was in many respects similar to that of other European countries. Unlike them, however, it had to race to make up for its late start because of the backwardness and uneven progress of the vast underdeveloped areas surrounding its limited industrial base. For a time, Italy was blessed with political stability accompanied by a gradual, albeit not straightforward and not altogether peaceful, widening of its democratic base. It survived the economic crisis of the last quarter-century. Later it could not resist the siren call of colonial adventure in East Africa. Its agricultural and industrial development gathered pace over the last years of the 19th century with constantly increasing rates of production which sometimes attained considerable heights before 1908. By a remarkable coincidence the boom characterizing the decade before this date also involved mathematics, given that 1908 was to be the year of the fourth International Congress of mathematicians in Rome. We can now introduce Italian mathematics over the first half-century more systematically by describing its structure and protagonists starting with the generation of the Risorgimento. This era precedes a period on which we will focus later. We have already mentioned Enrico Betti (1823–1892) and Francesco Brioschi (1824–1897) in terms of their participation in political and military events. Together with the young Felice Casorati (1835–1890) both these mathematicians visited the universities of Göttingen, Berlin and Paris in 1858 to learn of the most significant advances in European mathematics both from the scientific and organizational point of view. They were able to meet, amongst others, such distinguished mathematicians as R. Dedekind, P. C. L. Dirichlet,\n\n4\n\nGuerraggio\n\nFelice Casorati\n\nB. Riemann, L. Kronecker, K. Weierstrass and C. Hermite. Tradition has it that this voyage marked the birth – almost from nothing – of Italian mathematics. The theory that the Risorgimento also caused a new starting point in mathematics naturally derived from a patriotic ideology which emphasized the view that unification had set wings to the aspirations and enthusiasm of the best minds in the country, including science2. Actually, it cannot be argued that the mathematical school had sprung up from nothing (nor simply through a fact-finding mission). Even so, extreme as it may appear, this view can still be taken as a suitable starting point. The collaboration between Betti and Brioschi can be considered the true driving force behind this rebirth of Italian mathematics, which was to be extremely fruitful both in terms of organization and quality of research. Betti’s meeting3 with Riemann in Göttingen and their intense cooperation during the latter’s stay in Pisa (from 1863 to 1865) was a turning point. Following Riemann’s death in 1866, Betti became a reference point for all European mathematicians interested in further investigating this German mathematician’s works. Betti was a physicist-mathematician and the author of significant research (which was also translated into German) into the theory of potential and elasticity. 2\n\n3\n\nIn the inaugural speech of the International Congress of mathematicians in Rome, in 1908, Volterra asserted: “Hence, I would not be surprised if, following scientific development, there were a sudden transformation in the Italian thought, brought about by its quick progress and dissemination, and by the new enriching features it took in the years following the period of the political Risorgimento”. About Betti, the mathematical school of Pisa, and more in general about Italian mathematics after the Unity, see U. Bottazzini, Va’ pensiero. Immagini della Matematica nell’Italia dell’Ottocento, Bologna, Il Mulino, 1994.\n\nPrologue\n\n5\n\nIn this field his most well-known contribution is the so-called reciprocity theorem. This held that, if for an elastic solid one can consider two states of equilibrium consequent on the action of two different force systems, the work carried out by the first system (with respect to the deformations involving the second) is equal to the work of the second system with respect to the deformations involving the first. He also investigated complex variable functions, elliptic functions, and had even earlier looked into a number of issues concerning algebra and algebraic topology. It is no coincidence that Poincarè would coin the expression: Betti numbers as a means of measuring the different connection orders in n- dimensional figures. Betti was amongst the first in Europe to realize the value of Galois and Abel’s research for the resolution of algebraic equations, arriving at original results which subsequently were rediscovered and praised by Hermite. Finally, Betti was appointed director of the Scuola Normale di Pisa4 (from 1865 to his death), making the first contribution to the establishment of what was to become the most important research centre in Italy. We have already mentioned Brioschi’s5 “political” involvement and his contribution to the education of a ruling class in Italy which would step over the limits drawn by an exclusively legal – literary schooling. In his case, from a more strictly mathematical point of view, it is difficult to single out a particular discipline with which to identify him. Brioschi’s research ranged from algebra, analysis, geometry and mechanics, to mathematical physics. In analysis he made important contributions in the field of elliptic functions and differential equations, and particularly in that of differential invariants (associated with singling out the class of differential equations referable to constant coefficients equations). However, it was in algebra where he made his most lasting contributions, with innovative research into the theory of determinants and algebraic forms. By the time he embarked on his “European trip” in 1858, Brioschi was already a highly regarded mathematician. His book on La teorica dei determinanti e le sue principali applicazioni (published in 1854) had already been translated into French and German by 1856. His reputation derived in particular from his resolution of fifth and sixth degree algebraic equations (after Galois had demonstrated that it was impossible to solve for radicals equations that were greater than the fourth degree). Brioschi’s works accompanied others results by Hermite and Kronecker for the solution of general equations of the fifth degree through elliptic functions, and all three mathematicians were accorded merit for their solution of sixth degree equations through hyperelliptic functions. Finally – as in the case of Betti – one must mention Brioschi’s efforts in founding and then successively promoting the Annali di Matematica pura e applicata destined shortly to become one of the most prestigious journals in the sector. 4\n\n5\n\nThe Scuola Normale, founded in 1813, prepared the future school teachers in the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. Napoleon’s fall caused its closing (as well as that of other Napoleonic institutions) in 1814. The Grand Duchy of Tuscany reopened it in 1846, always with the same objective. After the Unity of Italy, besides this “old vocation”, it developed as a research centre, different from the university, and as a training centre for future researchers. On F. Brioschi see U. Bottazzini, Francesco Brioschi and the “Annali di Matematica”, in C.G. Lacaita, A. Silvestri (eds.), Francesco Brioschi e il suo tempo (1824–1897), Milano, Angeli, 2000, pp. 71–84; A. Brigaglia, Brioschi, Cremona e l’insegnamento della Geometria nel Politecnico, ibidem, pp. 403–418.\n\n6\n\nGuerraggio\n\nDuring their trip to the European capitals of mathematics in 1858, Betti and Brioschi were accompanied by the young Casorati6 (who was then only 23, having been one of Brioschi’s students). In his case, it is easier to single out a specific area of research to discuss: this was complex analysis. Casorati was the one who disseminated in Italy the ideas of Cauchy, Riemann and Weierstrass, also by publishing a monograph titled Teorica delle funzioni di variabili complesse (1868), containing original results which often preceded similar discoveries usually wrongly attributed to Weierstrass, Mittag-Leffler and Picard. Aside from Betti, Brioschi and Casorati, few other names need to be mentioned to give a fairly complete picture of the first generation of mathematicians in the recently unified Italy. Among these, the most important were Luigi Cremona (1830–1903) and Eugenio Beltrami (1836–1900). The former is considered the founder of the Italian school of algebraic geometry7. His commitment, and the role he intended to play in the field of geometry, can already be seen in his Prolusione published in 1860 at the University of Bologna where he wrote very clearly about the absence of “modern” geometry in Italy although it was already an essential part of teaching in France, Germany and Great Britain. Cremona moved from Bologna to the Polytechnic of Milan (where he held a course of static graphics) and then to Rome, to the School of Engineering, where the appeal of his teaching among students can be considered one of the first indications that the study of mathematics was coming into its own in Italy. In particular, two of his monographs8 (published in 1861 and 1867) marked the peak of projective studies and introduced a method for the geometric treatment of numerous algebraic problems, in the belief that synthetic geometry, with its clear supremacy, was the only system that could ensure the application of a methodology both rigorous and intuitive. Cremona’s main contribution (in which he showed he could appreciate the ideas already expressed by Riemann and the German school) was the introduction of the concept of the birational transformations of planes and space. These are a generalization (later called cremonia transformations) of the classic concept of linear transformations, and can be expressed through rational functions, usually invertible with functions of the same type. It was by using this concept, as well as the analysis of algebraically invariant properties with respect to birational transformations, that the study and classification of algebraic curves and surfaces starts. This research, in particular his synthetic study of cubic surfaces, won him, together with Charles Sturm, the Steiner prize of the Academy of Sciences of Berlin in 1866 (considered at the time the most prestigious award in the field). He received this prize again in 1874 without participating in any preliminary examination, in recognition of all his publications on geometry. 6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nOn F. Casorati see U.

Silvestri (eds.), Francesco Brioschi e il suo tempo (1824–1897), op. cit., pp. 419–429. His great interest for the history of geometry and his many international relationships can be appreciated in his correspondence, being printed by a research group coordinated by G. Israel. See L.

Bologna, n.s., 6 (1867), pp. 91–136 e 7 (1867), pp. 29–78.\n\nPrologue\n\n7\n\nBeltrami9 is mainly remembered for his research on differential geometry, undoubtedly influenced once again by Riemann’s ideas and their dissemination during the latter’s Italian sojourn10. Riemann’s studies kindled his interests in non-Euclidean geometry and the creation of their first model on the pseudosphere. Beltrami’s research can hence be situated between differential geometry and mathematical physics. With the publication of his monographs: Saggio di interpretazione delle geometria non – euclidea (1868) and 9\n\n10\n\nAs a young man, Beltrami was very active, given his Risorgimento ideals. As a result of these in 1856 he had to suspend his studies at the University of the Pavia before graduation and start working as a humble clerk. After the Kingdom of Italy was founded, Brioschi had him appointed without a public examination (on Cremona’s recommendation) as visiting professor in algebra and analytical geometry at the University of Bologna in 1862. Beltrami could at last devote himself to research and teaching, swinging for two decades between the Universities of Pisa, Rome and Pavia. He finally decided to settle in Rome, where he succeeded Brioschi as president of the Accademia nazionale dei Lincei. On Beltrami, see R. Tazzioli, Beltrami e i matematici “relativisti”. La meccanica in spazi curvi nella seconda metà dell’Ottocento, Bologna, Pitagora Editrice, 2000. Due to health reasons, Riemann spent the winter of the year 1862 in Sicily. From October 1963 until July 1965 he stayed in Pisa.\n\n8\n\nGuerraggio\n\nTeoria fondamentale degli spazi di curvatura costante in the following year, Beltrami’s work took its rightful place in the history of non-Euclidean geometry. These works, together with Beltrami’s proof of the coherence of Gauss, Lobatchevsky and Bolyai’s hyperbolic geometry, lend credibility to their reassessment of the privileged status which Euclidean geometry had hitherto enjoyed. So far, we have dealt with Betti, Brioschi, Casorati, Cremona and Beltrami. We can also add Giuseppe Battaglini (1826–1894) to this group. Battaglini is essentially a geometrician, a self-educated mathematician whose main concerns were the more analytical “neo-geometry” of Plucker and the geometric theory of algebraic forms by Clebsch. We owe to Battaglini also the Italian translation of Todhunter’s classic manual on Calculus and the publication, from 1863, of the Giornale di Matematiche (known precisely as “Battaglini’s Journal”), which promoted the education of young researchers through the dissemination and explication of major research programs and their results11. However, our list of mathematicians stops here. It was this small group which worked towards the mathematical modernization of the country by taking as its model the most advanced European situations. These close links with other countries would remain a constant feature in all the programs established in this period, together with a strong public and political commitment by mathematicians, an almost inevitable consequence of the great ideals and the fervent aspirations expressed in previous decades. Hence, mathematicians can be numbered amongst the most impassioned intellectuals committed to finding solutions for the many problems which afflicted the Italian education system in the period following unification. Foremost amongst these problems were the great differences between the Italian regions. The development of the Italian education system can be seen from the right perspective when one realizes that it was only in 1877 that the first two years of primary school became compulsory (after a long struggle against the most intransigent sectors of the Catholic church which sought to maintain family prerogatives). Indeed, at the time Italy was united, about 70% of the population was illiterate and this percentage would only decrease slowly in successive decades (from 69% to 62% in the 1871 and 1881 censuses respectively) reaching the threshold of 50% only at the beginning of the 20th century. In Europe a similar situation could be encountered only in Spain (and an even worse one in the Russian Empire). By the mid -19th century the other European countries had just under 58% illiterate people (Austrian Empire, Belgium, France) or even less (Great Britain 25%, Prussia 20%, Sweden 10%). Given that this proportion of educated people form the base of the educational pyramid, one should not be surprised by the small number of university students. Indeed, there were little more than 12,000 in 1871 and they doubled over the next 30 years, with a particularly accentuated progression in the period 1881 to 1901 also because of the prolonged economic crisis at the time (as always one of the variables with the greatest impact on the length of schooling). About one-third of university population attended the polytechnics or scientific degree courses. Here, amongst the teaching staff, the presence of mathematicians was prepon11\n\nA collection of his letters, from 1854 to 1891, can be found in M. Castellana and F. Palladino (eds.), Giuseppe Battaglini, Bari, Levante ed., 1996.\n\nPrologue\n\n9\n\nLuigi Cremona\n\nderant for the half-century this prologue is dealing with. In 1881, for example, mathematicians held 69 positions, which was slightly less than half of the total number of positions assigned to the scientific faculties. The boom in mathematics (in terms of students numbers and quality of the curricula mentioned above) can be appropriately explained in terms of the initial situation (at the beginning of unification), which we described as being extremely inadequate, making what happened later appear extremely positive by comparison. The same, in particular, can be said for any type of research which did not require great expense or investments and which could therefore develop rapidly even in a country with severe social problems. Also fundamental was the cohesion of the small group of mathematicians introduced above and the atmosphere in Italy during the last decades of the 19th century. At the time, Positivist thought was in the ascendancy and it informed the values of the growing bourgeoisie. The mathematical and physical sciences (not to mention economics) were seen as instruments for its affirmation, as was the development of a prevalently technical education in opposition to the literary and artistic curricula considered as antiquated and typical of a backward social organization. The mathematization of the social sciences also met with a certain measure of success because of the widespread belief in the objectivity of economic laws, contrasted with any attempt to subject economics to moral or ideological priorities.\n\n10\n\nGuerraggio\n\n2. The golden age. The Italian school of algebraic geometry The virtues of the Risorgimento generation (Betti, Brioschi, etc.) are to be seen, however, in terms of the creation of the conditions which made possible the second generation to transform Italian mathematics into a great power, second only to France and Germany. This corresponds to what we can call the golden age of Italian mathematics. It is of greater interest to us because it was during this period that some of the future protagonists of the years between two world wars began their careers. The levels of excellence that this group attained set the standards the following generation would have to measure up to. First we deal with the school of algebraic geometry (which we already mentioned when we spoke of Cremona). The Premio Bordin of the Académie des Sciences, was awarded to Italian mathematicians12 on two occasions in 1907 and in 1909 for research in this field, and the prestige of the Italian school is reflected in the epithet: italienische Geometrie attributed to algebraic geometry. One student of Cremona’s13 was Giuseppe Veronese14 (1854–1917) who worked in Berlin and Lipsia in 1880 and 1881 where he met Felix Klein. It was certainly an important encounter: the structural approach of the German mathematician encouraged Veronese to study the foundations of non-Archimedean geometry and the projective geometry of hyperspaces, to the extent that he would be recognized as one of the fathers of projective geometry in n-dimensional spaces. Battaglini, too had a student, Enrico D’Ovidio (1843–1933) who, after arriving in Turin, began to work with the young Corrado Segre (1863–1924). Their collaboration would bring, either by their own efforts or through those of their students, Italian algebraic geometry to full maturity. It was in this school that the study of algebraic surfaces would develop to become the greatest achievement of the Italian mathematical tradition. Segre15 started his career with an outstanding dissertation on hyperspatial quadrics and some studies regarding their geometry, following the concepts of Veronese. Soon, these projective techniques would be placed “at the service” of other research allowing him to ‘import’ and develop A. Brill and M. Noether’s program regarding the geometry of an algebraic curve, or in other words, the study of the properties of algebraic curves which are invariant with respect to birational transformations. In addition to these studies which represented the core of his scientific efforts, Segre also investigated such fields as: the ruled surfaces in hyperspaces, enumerative geometry, algebraic topology, and the initial elements of a theory of algebraic surfaces (with the intention of rigorously demonstrating Noether’s theorem for the existence of a smooth birational 12\n\n13 14\n\n15\n\nThe prize was awarded in 1907 to Federigo Enriques and Francesco Severi and in 1909 to Giuseppe Bagnera (1865–1927) and Michele de Franchis (1875–1946). Among other pupils of Cremona, we should cite at least Eugenio Bertini (1846–1933). Veronese graduated in Rome in 1877. From 1897 to 1900 he was Member of Parliament, and later town counsellor in Padua and (from 1904) Senator. Part of this correspondence (in particular 270 letters and postcards exchanged with Castelnuovo from 1891 to 1898, almost all regarding his early studies on the geometry over a surface) has been published and analysed in P. Garzio, “Singolaritá e Geometria sopra una superficie nella corrispondenza di C. Segre a G. Castelnuovo”, Archive for History of Exact Sciences, 43 (1991), n. 2, pp. 145–188.\n\nPrologue\n\n11\n\nCorrado Segre\n\nEugenio Beltrami\n\n12\n\nGuerraggio\n\nmodel for every algebraic surface) and the varieties described by families of projective spaces. His research on the relations between surfaces submerged in a projective space and partial differential equations would make him the most distinguished mathematician in Italy in the fields of differential geometry of curves, surfaces or varieties submerged in a projective space without a metric structure. Of equal import was the incisiveness of his teaching in his famous courses on “Superior geometry” held between 1888 and 1924. The radical contraposition between geometry and analysis which can be seen in Cremona’s “purism”, was in some respects overcome whilst still remaining within a framework highlighting the supremacy of synthetic methods. Their elegance and productiveness would become a model for the entire mathematical edifice. Students of Segre’s were Guido Castelnuovo (1865– 1952), Federigo Enriques (1871–1946) and Francesco Severi (1879–1961)16. The Italian school of algebraic geometry is generally identified with them. It is worthwhile having a closer look at their role and activities: they debut brilliantly at the turn-of-the-century but we will find them again – maybe in other fields of academic endeavour – also in the 1930s. Severi in particular would become one of the key figures of Italian mathematics between the two world wars. Immediately after graduating in Padua under Veronese, Castelnuovo began postgraduate study in Rome in 1886 where he heard Cremona’s lessons. The following year he went to Turin, where he began what was to be his lasting and friendly collaboration with Segre. His research mainly concerned algebraic curves, for which he elaborated a rigorous proof of Riemann-Roch’s theorem and the formula of maximum genus, with the subsequent determinations of maximum genus curves. This result generalized a discovery made by G. Halphen and M. Noether, but previously valid only for three dimensional projective spaces. The techniques used by Castelnuovo to elaborate his proof were original and still striking today for their simplicity and elegance. The turning point came a few years later, in 1891 when he was given a professorship in geometry at the university of Rome. Henceforth he focused on a new study of algebraic surfaces, but we should not neglect results such as those obtained in 1901 when he formulated the first rigorous proof of the theorem for which each cremonian flat transformation can be seen as the product of quadratic and linear transformations. In Rome, Castelnuovo met Enriques, with whom he was to write fundamental works in the history of the theory of algebraic surfaces. Until then the points of reference had been E. Picard’s transcendent and M. Noether’s geometric approach. The former had studied simple integrals of total differentials of the first kind annexed to an algebraic surface, coming to the result that these only existed on particular surfaces, for example hyperelliptic ones. The latter introduced the invariants constituted by the geometric genus pg, the linear genus p (1) and the numerical genus pa. It could be pa = pg , as always happens in the case of curves, or it could be q = pg– pa ≠ 0. Cayley had verified the second possibility in the case of the ruled ones. Since then it had been hypothesized that q was null, with the exception of the ruled ones. However, already in 1891, after studying certain particular types of surfaces, Castelnuovo had built 16\n\nWe should not fail to mention Gino Fano (1871–1952).\n\nPrologue\n\n13\n\nthe first example of an irregular unruled algebraic surface for which pa = pg. In 1896 he made his most important discovery17, with Enriques already working at his side, formulating a famous counterexample, where he extended the Riemann-Roch theorem of curves and the determination of the criterion of rationality. The condition valid for the curves – their rationality is linked to a null genus – was generalized: a surface is rational if and only if: q = P2 = 0, where q is the surface irregularity index and the plurigenus Pn is a new birational invariant, introduced by Enriques. Enriques had graduated in 1891 at Pisa university. He had wanted to undertake postgraduate study in Turin with Segre. Instead, he managed to find a position in Rome. Here he immediately changed from the team led by the then elderly Cremona to the one of the promising Castelnuovo, who would direct him towards the study of algebraic surfaces. Already in 1893 and in 1896, when he had been in Bologna for two years, Enriques published two fundamental memoirs where he laid the basis for the organic theory and the classification of algebraic surfaces. Enriques would never completely abandon this field of research, unlike Castelnuovo, who would practically stop publishing on algebraic geometry in the early years of the 20th century. However, within this field he would soon dedicate significant attention to elementary mathematics (developed also thanks to his personal acquaintance with Felix Klein) and to the philosophy and history of mathematics. His meeting with Castelnuovo, their friendship (further strengthened when Castelnuovo married Enriques’s sister) and their scientific plans have been documented by an exceptional collection of correspondence containing almost 700 letters written by Enriques to Castelnuovo between 1892 and 190618. Their personalities appeared to be complementary: Enriques was exuberant and possessed an extraordinary power of intuition. Often he would appear already certain of an outcome before securing it with successive formulation. But he was less interested in proofs and their rigour; he was impatient and often superficially read articles by colleagues. In contrast, Castelnuovo was perhaps less brilliant but original as well. He also sought nonetheless to refine and channel his brotherin-law’s genial intuitions into more suitable and productive outcomes. Their twenty year collaboration would develop a new method of formulating the theory of algebraic surfaces leading to a particularly simple classification, with the elimination of all the special cases. Consequently, the study of algebraic surfaces would involve now only those of curves lying on the surface. Amongst these, particular attention was dedicated to linear systems and to nonlinear continuous systems (existing only on irregular surfaces, for which the difference pg – pa is positive). In two notes19 written in 1914 Enriques presented almost definitive results on the theme of classifications: the surfaces were subdivided into classes of birational equivalents according to the values assumed by the plurigenera and the geometric genus. In the same year, the publication of a long article20, written together 17\n\n18\n\n19\n\nG. Castelnuovo, Alcuni risultati sui sistemi lineari di curve appartenenti ad una superficie algebrica, Mem.

We shall discuss Severi in the coming pages, both to illustrate his research in algebraic geometry and to reveal his rich and complex personality, together with his cultural and philosophical interests. His political role between the two world wars as the undisputed leader of mathematicians will also be examined. Even younger than Enriques, Severi graduated in 1900 at the university of Turin under Segre, with an outstanding thesis on enumerative geometry. Two years later he was in Bologna working with Enriques, who encouraged him to investigate the theory of algebraic surfaces. Severi will win a professorship already in 1905, first in Parma and soon after in Padua. From 1903 onwards, in particular, he concentrated on irregular surfaces (after the counterexample by Castelnuovo who had proven that the conjecture according to which ruled surfaces were the only irregular surfaces was groundless). There is already a glimpse – always within the school – of a strong and original personality, with a marked attention towards topological and functional aspects. In particular, Severi “retrieved” transcendent methods21 as a means of determining the link between irregular surfaces and surfaces endowed with total differential integrals of the first and second kind. It is thus proved – also thanks to an algebraic-geometric proof of Enriques, which Severi will not see fit to aprove, though – that irregular surfaces and those with Picard’s integrals of the first kind are the same set, and the existing relation between q and the number of integrals of the first and second kind (linearly independent) is stated. At that time, his relationship with Enriques was excellent and their collaboration continued: in 1907 both mathematicians, as mentioned above, received the Premio Bordin for their research on the classification of hyperelliptic surfaces by finishing G. Humbert’s work. In particular, Severi is awarded the prize Medaglia Guccia at the International Congress of Rome, in 1908, by a committee formed by M. Noether, E. Picard and C. Segre. He tries to extend those results and methods, that had proved so effective in the case of surfaces, to the study of varieties. In the same year he is appointed member of the Accademia dei Lincei, that in 1913 will award him the Premio Reale. In 1912, Severi and Enriques collaborate again, publishing a work on the foundations of enumerative geometry, which B. L. van der Waerden would consider of fundamental importance as a rigorous basis for algebraic geometry. In this work a solid basis was given to enumerative methods and in particular to Schubert’s principle of the conservation of number, according to which, if an enumerative problem had in the general case a finite number of solutions, then the same number of solutions (unless they become infinite) can also be found in particular cases. We shall now leave Severi and his studies on algebraic geometry to briefly deal with differential geometry. In reality, these two fields of research are not so distinct (although for clarity’s sake we discuss them as if they were) and the protagonists in20\n\n21\n\nG. Castelnuovo, F.

Houzel, La geómetric algebrique, ed. Blanchard, Paris, 2002.\n\nPrologue\n\n15\n\nvolved were often the same. However, two names are new to the scene described above: Luigi Bianchi (1856–1928) and Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro (1853–1925). Both graduated at the university of Pisa and spent a period of postgraduate work in Göttingen together with Klein. It is not the first time that we encounter this German mathematician; in fact, Klein played a similar role to that of Riemann with the first generation of Italian mathematicians, confirming the appeal that German mathematics and its organisational methods exercised over their Italian counterparts. Bianchi spent his whole mathematical career in Pisa, where he was to become the director of the Scuola Normale between 1918 and 1928. He also wrote22 on subjects such as analysis, algebraic number theory and one of his most important first contributions was his activity as a writer of treatises. Whole generations of Italian mathematicians would study from his book Lezioni di geometria differenziale. Of equal merit was his teaching work in algebra, with monographs (on finite groups and the theory of Galois, on continuous groups, and on the arithmetic theory of quadratic forms) which disseminated in Italy the arithmetic techniques formulated by the German school, in particular, by L. Kronecker, R. Dedekind, H. Weber and D. Hilbert. Regarding differential geometry, in his doctoral thesis of 1879, Bianchi introduced the so-called “complementary transformation” for surfaces submerged in the ordinary space. The result was applied in the theory of partial differential equations and in particular in nonlinear equations which we today term sine – Gordon. A few years later, the Swedish mathematician A. E. Bäcklund generalized Bianchi’s transformation, and in turn Bianchi integrated Bäcklund’s theory with the so-called “permutability theorem”, which allowed their transforms to be found using only algebraic and derivative calculations (after Bäcklund’s transforms of an initial pseudo-spherical surface are all known). Other notes examined the general theory of Riemann’s spaces. In a paper published in 1898, Bianchi with greater simplicity demonstrated the result (already known to Riemann) according to which n-dimensional spaces with constant and equal curvatures can be mapped isometrically to each other. In a successive work23 (dated 1902) he obtained the famous Bianchi identities, satisfied by the covariant derivatives of Riemann’s four index curvature symbols. However, despite the use of the covariant derivatives, as L. Pizzochero observed24, Bianchi was substantially unfamiliar with the methods of absolute Calculus. The true “Master” of this field in Italy was Ricci-Curbastro, who on his return from Göttingen, finally settled in Padua. Here, in the decade from 1885 to 1895 he studied the calculus of tensors, finding his main source of inspiration in the invariant theory of Riemann’s varieties, developed in research carried out by E. B. Christoffel, R. Lipschitz and of course, B. Riemann himself. As early as 1886 one of his notes introduced what he would later call covariant derivatives of a function (without, to tell the truth, quoting either Lipschitz or Christoffel, who had both already analysed the same operation). This expression appeared for the first time in a work published in the following year: Ricci 22 23\n\n24\n\nHis writings, collected in Opere (10 volumes), were published in 1952 (Roma, Cremonese). L.

In a memoir of 1888, with the emergence of systems with many counter-variant indices, he practically announced the birth of absolute Calculus, with the change of the ordinary procedures of differential calculus proposed so that formulas and results keep the same form, whatever system of variables is used. The expressions absolute differential Calculus and absolute systems appear in the memoir, Méthodes de calcul différential absolu et leur application, written together with his student Tullio Levi- Civita (1873–1941) and published in 1900 in Mathematische Annalen on F. Klein’s invitation. The memoir expounds Riemann’s geometry, with the new terms, and physical applications (to elasticity, to electrodynamics, etc.). The usefulness of the new methods would only be realized after some time. International aknowledgment for Ricci-Curbastro would arrive only on the eve of the First World War. In 1913, Einstein would adopt absolute Calculus as the basic mathematical language for the theory of general relativity which he was developing at the time. The infinitesimal methods of differential geometry were ‘exported’ to projective geometry. Finally Guido Fubini25 (1879–1943) dedicated some notes to the construction and the analysis of metrical structures in projective spaces and, in particular, to the description of the metrical structure induced by a hermitian form over a complex projective space (of any dimension). We shall discuss Fubini again when we deal with the Italian school of real analysis. The line element ds2 in the projective space is still today indicated with his name (together with that of the German mathematician E. Study).\n\n3. The golden period. The mathematical physics We should now give due recognition to one of Ricci-Curbastro’s students, Levi-Civita, one of the most creative Italian mathematicians in the first half of the century. We will mention him often in this book. Tullio Levi-Civita26 (1873–1941) graduated in Padua, where he received his entire education, if we except a brief period of postgraduate study in Bologna (where he met Enriques, becoming his lifelong friend) and some teaching in Pavia. In 1918 he was appointed at the University of Rome as professor of Superior analysis and successively Rational mechanics. Levi-Civita was in essence a mathematical physicist whose interests ranged from electromagnetism to analytical mechanics, from celestial mechanics to Relativity, from hydrodynamics to the theory of heat. Throughout his work, as observed by L. Dell’Aglio and G. Israel27, there was a close correlation between innovation and tradition. He explored new and original perspectives without weakening his steadfast attachment to a method which oriented analytical investigation according to results emerging from the preliminary use of geometric models. 25 26\n\n27\n\nHis writings are collected in three volumes in Opere (Roma, Cremonese, 1961–1963). His writings, edited by the Accademia dei Lincei, are gathered in six volumes in Opere matematiche (Bologna, Zanichelli, 1954–1970). See the article by Dell’Aglio-Israel in La Matematica italiana tra le due guerre mondiali (A. Guerraggio ed.), Pitagora ed., Bologna, 1987 .\n\nPrologue\n\n17\n\nIn the first years of his career, Levi-Civita expanded the research on stability according to Liapounov, ; in 1901 he developed his theorem on stationary movement and began his study of the theory of wakes in hydrodynamics that he would later deepen more fully in Rome. In the case of celestial mechanics he focussed on the classic problem of the three bodies, starting from P. Painlevé’s results and deducing a regularization of motion equations (he was able to predict and therefore to eliminate their singularities). Levi-Civita’s first essential contribution to absolute Calculus dated back to 189628. It was also the first time Ricci’s Calculus was adopted in a context outside of metric differential geometry, to solve a problem of analytical mechanics. The memoir confronts the issue, already raised by K. Appell in 1852, of the mutual transformability of “two systems of dynamic equations with the same number of variables”. The problem, in the case of forces independent of speed, was to be re-examined by Painlevé, who “by an opportune modification” had revealed that it could be applied to the determination of all systems (called correspondents) that have common trajectories. Hence, the invariant character of the problem emerged, and it was reduced to the singling out of all the correspondents of a given system. This suggested quite naturally that Ricci’s Calculus could be applied. It was by using this Calculus that Levi-Civita came to the conclusion, for the most general pair of correspondent dynamic systems (having the same number of degrees of freedom and not stimulated by other forces) that “n perfectly determinate types” were possible. Another, but no less significant proof of the fruitfulness of Ricci’s Calculus was provided in a memoir29 published shortly afterwards (1899), containing research on the types of potentials that can be made to depend on only two spatial coordinates. The analytical evaluation of the problem from Riemann onwards had led to differential systems, which were so complex as be intractable. Levi-Civita took as his starting point the observation that all those potentials that allow “infinitesimal transformation in themselves” were independent of one coordinate. From here Levi-Civita went on to consider the infinitesimal transformation to allow by the Laplace D2 y = 0 equation, finding five categories of infinitesimal transformations to which corresponded five types of binary potentials. Ricci’s Calculus was used at this point to show (also following advice by F. Klein) that the binary potentials found in this manner are the only ones possible. In the same year – as we already said – F. Klein invited Ricci-Curbastro to arrange a whole and systematic explanation of the calculus of tensors, to be published in Mathematische Annalen. In the writing of the article, later considered as the manifesto of tensorial algebra, Ricci-Curbastro let the young Levi-Civita, whose contribution would be fundamental especially for its applications to mathematical physics, join in. Tensorial relationships are not modified by the change in the coordinate system, therefore their language is particularly useful to express the properties that are naturally independent of the chosen reference. The works cited above, published at the end of the century, were written by an extremely young Levi-Civita. Over the same period, the reputation of another Italian 28 29\n\nT.

Torino, 49 (1899), pp. 105–152.\n\n18\n\nGuerraggio\n\nmathematician, Vito Volterra30 (1860–1940) was nearing its zenith. Volterra was the undisputed leader of Italian mathematicians in the first decades of the new century. He graduated in Pisa in 1882 after having studied under Betti. He was then appointed professor at the University of Pisa and successively Turin. In 1901 he moved definitively to Rome to become Beltrami’s successor. This move to the capital increased Volterra’s public profile and his involvement in positions of increasing responsibility in determining the scientific and cultural policies of the nation. At the beginning of the century, Volterra was elected president of the Società Italiana di Fisica. In 1905 the Italian Prime Minister, Giolitti, appointed him to the Senate. In 1907 he founded the SIPS (Società Italiana per il Progresso delle Scienze) – becoming its first president – on the model of similar societies already existing in France, England and other industrialized countries. His objective was of establishing a meeting point among scientists from different backgrounds as well as giving them a chance to disseminate their research. We shall deal with Volterra again later in this book. His presence influenced 50 years of Italian scientific research and makes us possible to deal not only with mathematical physics and analysis, but also with mathematical economics and mathematical biology. The age difference with Levi-Civita (who represented an interesting balance between innovation and tradition) is less than 15 years, but it was enough to place Volterra in a more classicist “19th century” perspective, where one feels the powerful pull of a strongly cohesive research, capable of describing the complexity of macroscopic physical phenomena by using only a few basic equations. As regards mathematical physics, the most important contributions, over the turn-of-the-century, regarded the propagation of light in birefractable equipment, the movements of the terrestrial poles (or, to be more precise, the movements of the Earth’s surface with respect to the Earth’s rotational axis), hereditary phenomena and what in modern terms is called dislocation theory. This last subject, which Volterra called distorsioni (distortions), constitutes part of his theory of elasticity which, according to Klein had become a “national issue” for the Italians31. In 1901, L. G. Weingarten had proven that a state of tension can exist in an elastic body without being subjected to external forces (occupying a non-simply connected dominion). The first example that comes to mind is that of a ring which after being cut transversally, removing a slice of matter, is then re-attached. Volterra’s studies, which were to have a significant impact on the theory of elasticity in non-simply connected dominions, began from this point. His findings, the classification and theory of distortions which derived from his research, were collected in a sizeable memoir dated 1907 (published in the Annales scientifiques de l’Ecole Normale Supérieur) “Sur l’équilibre des corps élastiques multiplement connexes”. Other authors would continue this research, including 30\n\n31\n\nVolterra’s Opere matematiche were issued in five volumes in 1962, edited by the Accademia dei Lincei. Among the several works on elasticity, we would like to point out Introduzione alla teoria matematica dell’elasticità (Turin, Fratelli Bocca, 1894) by the Neapolitan Ernesto Cesàro (1859–1906), who died tragically at sea while trying to save his son in danger. Particularly influenced by Beltrami in his works on mathematical physics, Cesàro is still remembered today for his works on analysis and for his classic method of summation of series, and stands out also for his results in the field of intrinsicgeometry and of asymptotic arithmetic.\n\nPrologue\n\n19\n\nCarlo Somigliana (1860–1955) who was a friend and colleague of Volterra’s, a descendant of Alessandro Volta and the author of a general theory of distortions. Volterra deserves a final mention as a physicist and mathematician for his researches on hereditary phenomena or on systems with memory, quoted above. His studies, starting from the observation that the deformations of an elastic body depend also on previous deformations, investigated those bodies which maintained the memory of their history and whose future state subsequently depended on their present as well as previous states. Once again an interesting convergence emerged between experimental data and mathematical instrumentation: the equations are no longer differential but integral-differential equations (which would be applied in particular to electrostatics and hereditary elasticity) given that heredity is expressed by functions that are integral with respect to time, of linear combinations of deformation components.\n\n4. The golden age. The analysis. By briefly referring to Fubini and in particular Volterra, we have been able to bring the study of analysis into the discussion. In Italy, this third great discipline of 19th-century mathematics was developed particularly in Pisa. The leader of this school was Ulisse Dini (1845–1919), who graduated under Betti in 1864 with a thesis on differential geometry. His name32 is universally known among mathematicians and students of mathematics for his theorem of implicit functions and for the “Dini derivative”, in which the customary passage to the limit is generalized through the notion of upper or lower limits. Also deserving mention are his studies on numerical and trigonometric series, complex variable functions, and differential equations. But the greatest impact that Dini had on the Italian mathematical scene (and not only the Italian) was due to the publication of his monograph: Fondamenti per la teorica delle funzioni di variabili reali (1878), in which he developed his rigorist program. For the objective was not to discover new results so much as to place already known ones on more solid foundations by completing them and specifying the dominion of their validity. Giuseppe Peano (1859–1932), from Turin, was another protagonist of the rigorist turning point. His contribution was to present the axioms of arithmetic, to give some counterexamples – some of which were ruthless in their simplicity, with which he ridiculed unsubstantiated hypotheses, mistakes and approximations (some contained in the most widely used manuals) and to obtain a precise and general formulation of a number of fundamental notions of analysis (limits, area of a region, Taylor’s formula, partial derivatives, maxima and minima for functions of several real variables, etc.). He is a particularly well-known mathematician33: his importance in the axiomatization of math32\n\n33\n\nDini’s Opere, edited by the Unione Matematica Italiana, were published in three volumes in 1955 (Roma, Cremonese) See H.C. Kennedy, Life and work of Giuseppe Peano, Dordrecht, D. Reidel Publ. Comp., 1980. Peano’s Opere scelte have been published in three volumes, edited by the Unione Matematica Italiana (Roma, Cremonese).\n\n20\n\nGuerraggio\n\nematical theories is undeniable; his non – recursive definition of a derivative of order n is still used today in some research on analysis and non-smooth optimization. His contribution (in the second half of the 1880s) to the theorem of existence for the differential equation y1 = f(x,y), proven with the sole condition of the continuity of function f, is specifically mentioned in many manuals. Equally well known is his role in devising a system of axioms for vector spaces described in his monograph dedicated to the dissemination of Grassmann’s ideas. Peano’s Curve (1890) more than 100 years on, still remains one of the most amazing and least intuitive conclusions which deductive rigor has brought to set theory and has played a truly significant role in the history of the concept of dimension: it is possible to find a curve, expressed by two continuous functions x = f (t) and y = g(t), which goes through all the points of the unity square whilst t varies over the interval [0.1]. In other words it is not always possible to enclose a continuous curve within an arbitrarily small area. Indeed, it was on the issue of scientific rigour that Peano engaged in a lively dispute in 1891 with Segre (and Veronese). Segre had backed a less rigid and absolute position by distinguishing the period of discovery from that of rigour. Peano instead retorted tersely that a theorem can be considered as discovered only when it is proven and that in the absence of the only – absolute – rigour that mathematics comprehends, one may write poetry, but not mathematics. Peano had another, much harsher, dispute with Volterra. Mathematical content34 concerns the motion of … a cat, allowed to fall in a vacuum upside-down and more generally the internal movements of a body (and the possibility of modifying their orientation) that Volterra had analysed in specific reference to the terrestrial globe subjected to the action of internal forces. Paradoxically in this case, Peano stood accused for the lack of rigour and originality of his conclusions. The dispute increased his isolation. Given the almost forgone outcome of his battle in favour of mathematical rigour, Peano gradually left his research in analysis and began to develop his ambitious plan of reconsidering all of the propositions of classical mathematics, breaking them down and analysing them in their smallest parts so as to be certain that they contained nothing less and nothing more than what was necessary. The same propositions were rewritten using combinations of algebraic and logical signs which leave no scope for misunderstanding and allow their precise and succinct formulation. In referring to Volterra we can return to Pisa, which we have depicted as the main centre of Italian analysis. Dini’s influence on the young Volterra can be seen in the latter’s early but famous contribution of 1881 at the young age of 21. Volterra was engaged in the process of completing the Riemann integration theory. One of the main issues of interest were the so-called two fundamental theorems of Calculus, that is, the study of the relationships between the operations of derivation and integration. It was here that Volterra devised the now classic example of a function derived in an interval, with a limited but not integrable derivative. At this point, Volterra’s research horizons widened beyond the strictures of a rigorist program. Also thanks to Betti and his competence in physics, Volterra was attracted by the possibility of applying analytical tools, 34\n\nSee A. Guerraggio, Le Memorie di Volterra e Peano sul movimento dei poli, Archive for History of Exact Sciences, 1984, pp. 97–126.\n\nPrologue\n\n21\n\nof course in a sophisticated and adequate manner, to the exigencies of the problem to be faced. These were the characteristics which we can find in his work on functional analysis. Volterra can rightly be considered one of the founding fathers of this discipline and its independent development, although his pioneering ideas would attract greater appreciation in other countries (in France, for example, thanks to the attention and sensitivity displayed by Hadamard) with slightly different characteristics. We have already spoken of Volterra’s ‘classicist’ outlook when dealing with his research in physical mathematics. Whilst using an abstract language in functional analysis, which was very distant from concrete applications, Volterra still kept his sights on “practical” objectives, such as real problems in physics or other mathematical issues. It would be these “practical” issues that suggested the specific abstraction to implement and which constituted a means of validating the significance of the formalization adopted. His first notes on functional analysis were published at the end of the 1880s. Within a few years, Volterra had introduced the concept of a functional with its associated calculus (up to its development using Taylor’s polynomial) and carried out his first research about linear functionals on a given functions space. Actually, he did not use the term functional (which would be suggested later by Hadamard) but the term function of a line to indicate a real number which depends on all the values taken up by a function y(x) defined over a certain interval, or the configuration of a curve. A functional can be considered as a limit case, for n Æ + •, of a function with n variables. In this manner, the first coherent research was carried out in spaces of infinite dimensions and the whole edifice of classical analysis was generalized to some specific functional spaces. The evolution of such an extension, starting from n-dimensional spaces, was highlighted and took on both an explanatory and reassuring role at the same time. Hence the derivative of a functional (defined on the set C[a,b] of continuous functions over a given interval) is what today we would call a directional derivative, or a Gâteaux-Lévy directional derivative. This is obtained by passing from an initial value f0 to an incremented one: f0 + eh, making e tend to 0 and hence reducing to the customary concept of derivative for a real function (adopting a procedure well-known to Calculus of variations). Volterra is not so interested in studying the functional properties of ‘his’ derivatives, so much as their actual calculus. And in defence of his approach he reminded those who accused him of giving a too specific definition (with respect to the ensuing “differential according to Fréchet”), such as Hadamard and especially Fréchet, that maximum generality is not the ultimate value to be sought after, but rather the most adequate generality for the problem being dealt with35. One should remember that Volterra’s first results took place at the end of the 19th-century and that M. Fréchet’s thesis is dated 1906. Although his initial works still considered specific functional spaces, they already did so from the perspective of general theory. Hence, they would enable and encourage unifying studies of metrical and topological structures. 35\n\nFréchet would not give up either. Still in 1965, in a letter to P. Lévy from the 30th July (published in Cahiers du Séminaire d’Histoire des Mathématiques, 1980, n. 1), he clarified that “si je considère que Volterra a réalisé un grand progrès en donnant au moins une définition de la différentielle d’une fonction dont l’argument est une fonction, d’autre part, je considère que sa définition est mauvaise”.\n\n22\n\nGuerraggio\n\nVolterra’s other well-known contribution in this period were integral equations, inserted for the first time into a general theory, later taken up and developed by E. Fredholm, D. Hilbert and others. Volterra investigated integral equations of the first and second kind with a triangular kernel. Here too, the procedure for their resolution was accompanied by the formulation of the principle of the passage from discrete to continuous, for which an integral equation of the first kind is the limit case (for n Æ + •) of a system of n algebraic equations in n unknowns. Giulio Ascoli36, Cesare Arzelà37 and Salvatore Pincherle (1853–1936) all graduated in Pisa. The first two names can be seen in every text on functional analysis for their studies on the concept of equicontinuity and the extraction of a converging subsequence from a sequence of equilimited and equicontinuous functions. After graduating, Pincherle studied in Pavia (with Casorati) and Berlin where he studied under the guidance of K. Weierstrass38. His stay in Germany is fundamental for an understanding of how his research developed. Pincherle is considered another pioneer of functional analysis thanks to his theory of analytic functions. The remark that each of these functions can be singled out from a countable infinity of parameters, which could be interpreted as its coordinates, led Pincherle to investigate functions spaces of infinite dimension and the abstract study of the linear functionals acting on these spaces. He sought to create a calculus for these functionals similar to the already well known one for the functions of a complex variable. Over the next few decades, these concepts would be developed along different pathways to an extent which was unthinkable at the turn of the century. Instead, the route taken by Pincherle would not be as well trodden, as he himself would serenely come to recognize. After his brief stay in Berlin, Pincherle moved definitely to Bologna, that would become, together with Pisa, a new important research centre in analysis. The most representative exponent of the school in Bologna was Leonida Tonelli (1885–1946), whom we shall encounter as one of the foremost protagonists of Italian mathematics in the period between the two world wars39. He had studied at Bologna under Arzelà and Pincherle, graduating in 1907. His academic career as full professor would begin only after the war for a number of reasons (first at Bologna and later at Pisa). Nevertheless even before 1915, Tonelli had written a number of very important works, numbered among his most significant, in the field of real analysis and Calculus of variations. In 1908 he published a note40 on the length of rectifiable continuous curves with particular reference to the case in which the functions representing the curve are absolutely continuous. In the 36\n\n37\n\n38\n\n39\n\n40\n\nG. Ascoli (1843–1896) graduated at the Normale in Pisa in 1868. Then he taught at the Polytechnics in Milan. Also C. Arzelà (1847–1912) graduated in Pisa, at the Normale, in 1869. Later, he taught at the Universities of Palermo and Bologna. His Opere, in two volumes, have been issued in 1992 (Roma, Cremonese) and edited by the Unione Matematica Italiana. Pincherle’s Opere scelte, in two volumes, edited by the Unione Matematica Italiana, were published in 1954 (Roma, Cremonese). Tonelli’s Opere scelte were issued in 1961 (Roma, Cremonese) and edited by the Unione Matematica Italiana. L. Tonelli, Sulla rettificazione delle curve, Atti Acc. Sci. Torino, 1908.\n\nPrologue\n\n23\n\nfollowing year, he published a note41 where in generalizing the integration formula by parts to the functions of two variables, he provided a criterion for the integrability (according to Lebesgue) of a measurable function f(x,y) ≥ 0 which admits a pair of successive integrals. It can be affirmed that this article completed the well-known result proven by Fubini in 1907 according to which the double integral (assuming it existed) of f(x,y) can be calculated by two successive simple integrals, independently of the order of integration. Fubini, whom we have already mentioned for the originality of his studies in projective differential geometry, was another leading figure in the Italian school of real analysis. He is mainly remembered for his theorem on double integrals but he was also the author of other important works in the theory of integration, the minimum principle, automorphic functions and integral equations. But let us return to Tonelli. His fundamental memoirs on Calculus of variations were published in 1911, 1914 and 191542. Calculus of variations took its rightful place in functional analysis by the systematic use of direct methods, already used in particular cases by B. Riemann, D. Hilbert, J. Hadamard, H. Lebesgue, C. Arzelà etc., based on the notions of compactness and semicontinuity (generalizing the definition given by Baire for real functions). It was through direct methods that Tonelli proved some theorems of the existence for the so-called simplest problem in Calculus of variations, avoiding the passage through Euler’s equation and hence avoiding difficulties about the calculation (and the existence) of the solution of a boundary value problem, the strong limitation imposed on the functional class by the consideration of differential equations, the privilege given to the relative extrema and then the search for suitable sufficient conditions. Giuseppe Vitali (1875–1932) was the other main exponent of the school of Bologna, even if he graduated in Pisa (after having studied in Bologna under Arzelà and Enriques)43. The year 1905, in particular was a “magical” one in terms of his scientific endeavours. After having proven the necessary and sufficient condition for Riemann integrability of a limited function over a limited interval (depending on the measure of the set of its discontinuity points), in the same year Vitali published a series of notes in which he proved the so-called Lusin’s theorem on the almost continuity of measurable functions, giving the famous example of non-measurable sets (according to Lebesgue). Moreover, he characterized the integral functions of not necessarily limited functions by inventing the term, of absolutely continuous functions (and studying the class of these functions in relation to those of bounded variation). Many of these results were more or less obtained over the same period by H. Lebesgue. Nevertheless, they were obtained 41 42\n\n43\n\nL. Tonelli, Sull’integrazione per parti, Rend. Acc. Lincei, 1909.

Vitali’s Opere sull’Analisi reale e complessa, edited by the Unione Matematica Italiana, were published in 1984 (Roma, Cremonese); the publication of the letters addressed to him would follow (edited by M.T. Borgato and L. Pepe).\n\n24\n\nGuerraggio\n\nwholly independently. At this junction one should remember that Vitali was unable to find a university position and for many years was forced to teach in high schools in distant locations removed from the customary channels of scientific communication. At the same time, Lebesgue could also complain that at Poitiers, where he taught from 1906 to 1910, he was not able to consult any Italian journal. This may explain the partial overlap of Vitali’s results with those of Lebesgue, without diminishing the originality and value of his research, in particular that regarding absolutely continuous functions. In this instance, Vitali’s priorities were clear, not so much because he introduced the term or for his generalization to the functions of two variables, but because of the central position he accorded to such a concept in his theory of integration. Pisa was also where Eugenio Elia Levi studied. He was born in 1883 and died in 1917 in the war44. With him we introduce the topic of complex analysis which we touched upon when discussing Pincherle. His brother45 Beppo (1875–1961) was also a mathematician and at the same time as Vitali engaged in a brief controversy with H. Lebesgue regarding the cogency of some proofs by the latter. Nevertheless, he would mainly concentrate his efforts on algebraic geometry, number theory, logic and the foundations of geometry. In the complex analysis, Eugenio Elia’s research focused on the singular point sets of a holomorphic function of several variables. However, he also wrote on issues relating to: differential geometry, Lie’s groups, partial differential equations and the minimum principle. E. E. Levi would also demonstrate the falsity of Weierstrass’s conjecture according to which given an open A of C2 , a merophormic function will always exist in A which has essential singularities in each point of the border of A, providing further evidence in favour of the differentiation between the theory of the single complex variable and the theory of more than one complex variable. His research followed Hertogs’s theorem (1906) which signals the rise of multidimensional complex analysis as an independent research field. This springtime in Italian mathematics at the beginning of the 20th century was not confined to geometry, mathematical physics and to analysis but also involved the “new” disciplines. We have already mentioned how Peano went on to study logic after embarking on his rigorist struggle and his search for extreme precision in definitions and proofs, also for teaching purposes. Around him and his publishing plans and the Rivista di Matematica (founded in 1891), a school of young and combative scholars would rapidly coalesce. Their presence would enliven many conferences which were still an innovation at the beginning of the century. Bertrand Russell would remember his meeting with Peano at the International Philosophy Congress in Paris in 1900 as being a particularly significant event for the formulation of his program. In partial contradiction with the 44\n\n45\n\nE. E. Levi had graduated from Pisa in 1904. He had been Dini’s assistant and then taught at the University of Genoa. His Opere, edited by the Unione Matematica Italiana, were printed in two volumes in 1959 (Roma, Cremonese). B. Levi graduated from Turin in 1896. After a short period as assistant and as secondary school teacher, he taught geometry in Cagliari and then in Bologna. After the racial laws of 1938, he was forced to emigrate to Argentina, contributing to organize the mathematical activity in that country. His Opere, edited by the Unione Matematica Italiana, have been printed in two volumes in 1999 (Roma, Cremonese).\n\nPrologue\n\n25\n\nnew ideas of the period, mathematical logic for Peano did not involve the application of algebraic techniques to traditional logic (and hence was not – nor could be – an independent mathematical discipline) but a tool and a language which were essential to mathematical activity, allowing concepts and proofs to be expressed with the greatest clarity. With even less traditions a group of young mathematical economists also formed. The “lesson” taught by Walras approach had been adopted by Vilfredo Pareto (1849– 1923) who, despite teaching in Lausanne, became the founder of the Italian school of mathematical economics and the true disseminator of the theory of general economic equilibrium. Mathematical economics was already an independent discipline but it had not yet expressed those distinguishing features typical of its full maturity. This field continued to entertain a close exchange with other areas of mathematical research and with those sectors of Italian culture and society interested in mathematizing a science which had traditionally been considered part of the social sciences. Economics was thereby endowed with quantitative and “objective” foundations46. The most active season of Italian mathematical economics was brief, very much associated with Pareto’s commitment to it. Indeed, in 1909 with the publication of the French edition of the Manuale di economia politica, Pareto would in practice cease his research in economics. This would not stop an economist and an economic historian such as Joseph Schumpeter to consider Italian economic research in 1915 (thanks to the mathematical economists) as second to none.\n\n5. External interests As representative of the Risorgimento generation, we have dealt with a small group of mathematicians of great ability, tempered and selected by the political and military events of the period. These mathematicians associated their research with their public lives and were inspired by the most advanced research of the time in Europe. This small group had now grown. In the next generation we have met almost all the protagonists of our history: Volterra and Levi-Civita, Enriques and Severi, Tonelli. University positions in mathematics was increasing as was the number of young students aspiring to a university career. Before a national society of mathematicians was established, a number of scientific associations and academies had already developed (and they often published their journals and “bulletins”). In 1870, with the taking of Rome, the historical Accademia dei Lincei was reorganized. In 1884 the Circolo matematico of Palermo was founded; its Rendiconti would soon draw international attention, and it would be given the task (together with the mathematical section of the Accademia dei Lincei) of organizing the fourth International Congress of mathematicians in Rome in 1908. By that date the Circolo would number 924 members, of which 618 were foreigners, and its international prestige would be universally recognized. Also in 1908, 46\n\nOn this issue, see A. Guerraggio, Economia e matematica in Italia tra Ottocento e Novecento, Scientia, 1986, pp. 13–39.\n\n26\n\nGuerraggio\n\nPoincarè publicly declared that the Circolo was the most important world mathematical organization!47 Although this increase in the scientific community would make it difficult for a collective mind to formulate and carry out a single plan, the picture that we have before us at the beginning of the new century is sufficiently consistent to be considered as a whole. The efforts made for greater prominence in the international scene continued (as proof we have the exemplary story of the Circolo matematico of Palermo), and were still associated with strong engagement in public affairs. Increasing social complexity, however, meant that this engagement was not only expressed in terms of participation in government and parliament. A greater number of steps and a longer march through society became mandatory. Such a trek for mathematics could not begin but in the school system. The grave problems in education, noted immediately after unification, would not be solved. The process of homogenization of the different regional situations would be slow, and the modernization of the country placed an added burden of tasks and objectives on the educational system. Tertiary education faced the problem of having too many universities, inherited from the various Italian states before unification, which brought to the fore the problem of the quality of teaching. In the secondary schools, the need to increase levels of education led to many calls to reduce and simplify programs (particularly and especially in mathematics). Despite this difficult situation the teachers of mathematics would react positively by displaying strong individual commitment, founding (in 1895) a society, called Mathesis, which published the Periodico di Matematiche, and attracted the collaboration of a substantial number of university lecturers and professors. Unfortunately, results did not always match efforts, as the crises which this association would have to cope with testify to. Nevertheless, a distinguishing feature of Mathesis in this period was its great faith in active and direct involvement by members and in the establishment of a grass-roots reform movement. All the main educational issues were expressed and subjected to consultation amongst teachers in a positive fashion. From the point of view of Mathesis, the strength of this representation and logic would almost inevitably transform the resulting solutions into a reform project. The relationship of Italian mathematics to the rest of society was not confined to establishing and disseminating scientific culture among the youngest generations. At the same time, its intention was to “export” the language and rationality it considered distinguishing features of its research, particularly by influencing traditionally closest scientific disciplines. Starting in 1895, Il nuovo cimento became the official publication of Italian physicists with Volterra as a member of the scientific committee for the journal. Two years later, the Società italiana di fisica was founded, with Volterra becoming its president, as we have already seen. Even more surprising were the mathematical “incursions” into fields traditionally occupied by the “other” culture. It must not be forgotten that Italian mathematicians developed a strong historical consciousness and also expressed their opinions on philo47\n\nSee A. Brigaglia, G. Masotto, Il Circolo Matematico di Palermo, Bari, Dedalo, 1982.\n\nPrologue\n\n27\n\nsophical issues. This happened thanks to the presence of a strongly interconnected general culture. The rigid separation channels which would bound the disciplines in 20th century thought had not yet been fully excavated. The most prominent Italian mathematician in this sense was Enriques (although he was not the only one). The first examples of his interest in philosophy date back to the mid -1890s, if we except his first encounter with it as a secondary school student. However, it is in the 20th century that the activities of Enriques as a philosopher acquired public significance. In 1906 he published a volume titled I problemi della scienza. He began by philosophically analyzing the construction of geometrical systems and the problem of space. Enriques faced several problems which had also been studied by mathematicians such as F. Klein and H. Poincaré: what is the nature of geometrical postulates? How can the different geometries be explained from this perspective? Enriques stressed the importance of intuition and of the interaction among real space, space intuition and geometry postulates, refusing to consider the latter as a purely formal system. He saw geometry postulates as conceptual abstractions, but based on the different ways in which space is perceived. That same year Enriques founded the Società filosofica italiana (SFI), becoming its president. In 1907 he founds the review Rivista di scienza; in 1911 it would adopt the name Scientia turning into an international journal of scientific synthesis, in an attempt to counter tendencies towards excessive specialization. In 1907 he participated in the second congress of the SFI presenting a paper titled: “Il rinascimento filosofico nella scienza contemporanea”. In the next congress, he even approached Hegel in a paper titled: “La metafisica di Hegel considerata da un punto di vista scientifico.” By now it had become clear that his work could no longer be ignored by “professional” philosophers, in particular by Benedetto Croce (1866–1952) and by Giovanni Gentile (1875–1944) who at the time were the leading exponents of Italian idealism. Already at the beginning of the century, they had become exponents of a plan to extend their philosophical hegemony over the culture of the whole country. The event for the redde rationem was to be the fourth International Congress of Philosophy (1911). Since it was to be held in Italy it was organized and chaired by Enriques (in his capacity as president of SFI). The clash with Croce and Gentile began immediately, during the preparation of congress events. The congress then went smoothly. It was only once it was finished that Croce publicly attacked Enriques, in a newspaper interview, by directly accusing him, coupling ironic comment with harsh judgment, of being an amateur and for encroaching on a field which he knew nothing about. Croce’s severe criticism was emblematic: by declaring its incomprehension and hostility, ‘official culture’, or rather that more closely rooted in the traditions of the country, handed down its negative sentence (destined to “count” for many decades to come) on the enthusiastic attempt by mathematicians to link their extremely qualified professional capacities to active participation in the cultural and social life of the country. Although the Croce – Enriques controversy is perhaps the most well- known event of the period, the most “political” incident saw the participation of Volterra, with the establishment of the already mentioned SIPS. This association was founded with a double objective, which we have already noted in regard to Mathesis. The internal objective addressed the scientific community by advocating consciousness of one’s intellectual\n\n28\n\nGuerraggio\n\nrole. Although specialization in academic research was considered as a positive necessity, it should not lead to fragmentation and isolation into small sectors, inspired only by technical perspectives. Consciousness of a greater mission to fulfil, as well as a more attractive image (which was to be achieved by publicising the character and work of scientists) were considered the prerequisites for applying strong pressure to combat the inertia of the political establishment, encouraging it to recognize the usefulness of science by according it a rightful place in society. This was the second objective of the SIPS: to participate in the development of a modern country, which recognized the social function of science by following in the footsteps of the more developed European countries. This message was lucid and strong. Volterra suggested that both he and the scientific com"
