There the hospital, in particular, is named after him. Not that he was a medical doctor nor was he involved in medicine. He was in fact the mayor of the town when the hospital was built, and it is far from being the only construction he can be credited with. Borel was indeed a builder, among many other facets of his personality. He also constructed, and ran as director until his death, the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris. When I took over the direction of this famous and internationally renowned house of mathematics, the fact that it had been founded by Borel was quite impressive. So, I am honoured and delighted to have contributed a little bit to the publication of this volume, thanks to the links we have been developing with European Mathematical Society Press, which now publishes two of the four journals stemming from the original Annales de l’Institut Henri Poincaré. As far as I know, this is the first book ever written in English about Borel, even though one can have a glimpse of his life, for instance, in the book Mathematicians at war: Volterra and his French colleagues in World War I by Laurent Mazliak and Rossana Tazzioli. In fact, the few historians of mathematics interested in Borel have long refrained from writing down his biography. Hélène Gispert even wrote a paper (in French) in 2012 to explain their reasons. A biography of Borel would be too difficult a story telling, with too many choices to\n\nbe made within his numerous intellectual, mathematical, and political commitments, let alone the classical danger of instrumentalisation of his character. Nevertheless, Gispert accepted to curate an exhibition about him at the Institut Henri Poincaré library in 2021. Entitled Émile Borel, un mathématicien au pluriel, it was designed to avoid the pitfalls she had pointed out in her paper, and reflects her suggestion to focus on specific topics, and actually also on specific years in the life of the Borels, with information about his wife and writer Camille Marbo being showcased along with those about him. Thanks to our librarians and this group of historians, in particular Martha Cecilia Bustamante, the exhibition’s material was soon translated into Spanish and shown in Cali in Colombia, where Borel is a hero. In addition, we also published a booklet (in French) about the exhibition together with the Société Mathématique de France. Back in 1999, the biography written in French by the physicist and Borel enthusiast Pierre Guiraldencq filled a gap in a way that was not competed with until Michel Pinault’s monumental work entitled Émile Borel : une carrière intellectuelle sous la IIIe République. Today we are lucky enough to have a widely renewed version of Pierre Guiraldencq’s book in English, thanks to the joint work of the author and the translator Arturo Sangalli. I wish this book be enjoyed by a wide audience, ranging from professional mathematicians or historians to students and the general public. We will surely be proud to display it on the shelves of the Institut Henri Poincaré library. Paris\n\nSylvie Benzoni\n\nvi\n\nForeword to the French edition Pierre Guiraldenq’s Émile Borel offers the portrait of a mathematician who had a considerable influence on the development of twentiethcentury mathematics, and, in addition, the discovery of his lifelong contribution to the awareness of this science’s cultural significance. Borel’s 1894 doctoral thesis contained the basis of a new theory of measure that he would expand in his Leçons sur la théorie des fonctions – an essential tool for the development of analysis – published in 1898; a theory that would completely revitalise the field and pave the way to the Lebesgue integral. This work also contained the first statement of the Borel–Lebesgue theorem, which would lead to one of the fundamental concepts of general topology, that of compactness. It is worth mentioning that in his proof of the theorem Borel used the notion of transfinite formulated by Cantor, demonstrating for the first time the practical application of Cantor’s hierarchy of infinities, which would later allow Baire to elaborate his famous classification of discontinuous functions. One of Borel’s defining traits was his desire, very early in his career, to devote his scientific knowledge, his prodigious intelligence, and his force of character to the service of his country. Ten years after his thesis, when he was at the summit of his scientific career and fame, he embarked in a new direction, favouring what seemed to him to possess a “practical value”, foremost the calculus of probability, until then considered a minor discipline, and for which he would develop the theory. He was the author of “the article” that in 1909 gave a new dimension to the field; but also, and especially, to all its applications, from statistical physics –\n\nwhich had been reborn with the flourishing of molecular theories – to every human activity that involves statistics, including games of political and military strategies, of which he was a pioneer. It is impossible to understand this radical change of direction without considering Borel the man in his entirety and his deep attachment to his origins. In this sense, Pierre Guiraldenq’s book is unique. One cannot envision Borel without a land, a root, an anchoring point whose solidity rests on centuries of wisdom and human values. The author tells us a great deal about Borel, the man, the teacher, the scientist, the administrator, the politician. We discover, among other things, his foretelling vision of the necessity to build Europe, and his pledge for a greater representation of the “feminine element” in public administration. His involvement in the creation of the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris, which he headed until his death, was decisive. Pierre Guiraldenq’s book will be of particular value to all those interested in the history of science and culture; the science and culture that Émile Borel so eminently represented. Paris\n\nBernard Bru and Pierre Dugac†\n\nviii\n\nPreface This book introduces the reader to the life of a scientist and man of action, Émile Borel, well known in mathematical circles but little known by the public at large. Borel was a member of the great French mathematical school of the beginning of the twentieth century, and an active participant in the remarkable scientific adventure of those pioneers of genius that revolutionised modern physics. But amid the profound upheavals that fell upon the continent, he also showed other talents: his energy and capacity to act decisively added a new, social and political dimension to his life. Borel’s theoretical and applied scientific works, so vast in number and scope, remain a permanent reference. However, apart from the short book La vie et l’œuvre d’Émile Borel written in 1965 by his former student Maurice Fréchet, little appears to have been written before the 1999 Colloque Émile Borel in Saint-Affrique to restore the memory of the man, his family life, his career, and his numerous and varied activities. Since then, a growing number of historians of mathematics, both in France and further afield, have manifested a real interest in his works: Hélène Gispert, Marie-France Bru, Bernard Bru, Roger Laurent, Gustave Choquet, André Warusfel, Laurent Mazliak, Jean-Michel Kantor, Jean-Baptiste Hiriart-Urruty, Henri Caussinus, Jean-Michel Guieu, Alexandre Klein, Jean-Paul Pier, Loren Graham, among others. Echoing the title of this book and underlying a renewed interest in Borel’s life and works, the study meeting “Borel : savant et politique” was held on November 17–18, 2021 at the Centre Alexandre-Koyré,\n\na research institute in the history of science and techniques located in a suburb of Paris. His wife, Marguerite (née Appell), a writer known by her pen name Camille Marbo, lived a dynamic and passionate existence at his side, but confessed to always having refused to write about the life of her husband of fifty years, as she writes in her last book À travers deux siècles : souvenirs et rencontres (1883–1967): Of such a complex man, what is to be said? One is simply struck by his extraordinary intelligence, his powerful will, his instinctive and rare kindness.\n\nDuring a visit to the Princeton University Library in 1984, the author discovered on its shelves all the books written by Borel – in stark contrast with the handful of copies of his works held in the French National Library’s collection, in Paris. This prompted him to embark on a journey of historical research to restore the memory of his illustrious compatriot. Chance, a concept central to Borel’s work on probability, brought together (virtually) author and translator, during the long months of a global pandemic. The result of their collaboration is this English version of the author’s Émile Borel, 1871–1956 : l’espace et le temps d’une vie sur deux siècles, adapted for an international audience. The reader will find a chronological analysis of Borel’s “space in time”, with a focus on the most significant moments and the principal events in his rich life, across two centuries and two wars and against the backdrop of a complex contemporary history. As for his mathematical works, important as they are, they are only briefly discussed in the context of his scientific career. This book, which is also our way of marking the 150th anniversary of the birth of the great mathematician and statesman, would not have seen the light without the vision and enthusiasm of Apostolos Damialis, editorial director at European Mathematical Society Press, to whom we address a heartfelt “thank you”.

His father, Honoré Borel, was a Protestant minister married to Émilie Tessié-Solier, who came from a very respectable family of the region. Much younger than his two sisters, Jeanne, sixteen, and Marthe, fourteen, little Émile was the centre of attention in an atmosphere of well-established family traditions. He received his primary education at the private Protestant school run by his father and located in his own house. In a difficult period when France, humiliated by her defeat in the 1870 war and with the French Republic still fragile, struggled to recover, it became important to instill in the young generation a sense of duty, effort, and responsibility. Of Émile’s early training few traces remain, except for some rare souvenirs recorded by his wife, who reported that Émile’s sharp mind didn’t go unnoticed, as his first academic successes confirmed.2 1 Also\n\nknown for the mnemonic rule of Sarrus for calculating determinants.\n\n2 C. Marbo in F. Decuq, Retrospective de Saint-Affrique et de sa région, Maury, Millau\n\nBorel’s formative years were also marked by a deep affection for the arduous and hardworking rural life of South Rouergue, his homeland, a trait that would later be reflected in his actions and decisions. In the property his father possessed at Saint-Paul-des-Fonts he discovered the demands of working the land, amid the damp heat, the yokes, and the herds. In 1882, young Émile was sent to live with his eldest sister and her husband, the pastor Élie Lebeau, in Montauban. He pursued his studies there at the Lycée Ingres and soon attracted his teachers’ attention for his outstanding abilities.3 In 1887, he obtained his baccalauréat ès sciences after winning nearly every first prize: in mathematics, physics and chemistry, history and geography, and German, besides, not surprisingly, the prize of excellence. In addition to his science degree he also successfully sat the baccalauréat ès lettres exams. Émile’s next goal was to prepare for the entrance examinations for the grandes écoles. These are elite education institutes, separate from French universities at the time, that employ highly selective admission policies, leading to a fiery competition among potential candidates. Following his teachers’ advice, Émile left his southern town and headed for Paris, home to such prestigious academic institutions.\n\nParis: Entrance exams, École Normale Supérieure, military service In October 1887, holding a higher education scholarship, Borel took a one-year course in advanced mathematics at the Collège Sainte-Barbe. He then continued his preparation for the exams at the famous Lycée Louis-le-Grand as a student of the reputed teacher Bolesias Niewenglowski.4 A string of achievements followed: in 1889, at age eighteen, young Borel obtained the first prize in mathematics in the general entrance (1971), pp. 143–147 3 J.-F. Delord, Le Lycée Ingres de Montauban, 1870–1914. Histoire, anecdotes, silhouettes et portraits, Archistra, (1993), no. 107, pp. 1–63 4 R. Deltheil, Émile Borel, Revue du Rouergue, tome X (1956), no. 1, janvier–mars, pp. 1–14\n\n2\n\nexaminations, and also the top place in those of the École Normale Supérieure (ENS) and the École Polytechnique; a rare feat, reserved to distinguished alumni,5 such as Gaston Darboux, his future thesis advisor, in 1861, and Jacques Hadamard in 1884. The 1994 Fields medallist Jean-Christophe Yoccoz also swept all three top prizes in 1975. Borel was now at a crossroads, facing two alternative paths: either a life devoted to teaching and research, or a career in government – military or civil – by enrolling in the École Polytechnique, a first-class engineering school. In 1940, at the celebrations honouring his fifty years of public service, he would look back at those entrance examination days and the role played by the fortunes of life and the social environment around him: I was lucky to have as a friend Gaston Darboux’s son, thanks to whom I was introduced into the family of the eminent mathematician. The homely fifth-floor apartment on rue Gay-Lussac welcomed the young student from the province I was with warmth and good nature. I learned there many things, and in particular that the ENS was not only a pathway to a teaching career but also served as a preparation for scientific research. Gaston Darboux’s influence was thus crucial in determining the direction of my future training. . . 6\n\nThe dynamic spirit and technical achievements of the times could very well have lured him toward a successful future as an engineer. He already possessed the creativity and organisational talent that would be revealed later, during his Navy service and by his active role in the foundation of the Institut Henri Poincaré and the construction of a modern hospital in Saint-Affrique. But, in the end, his long-weighted decision to enroll at the ENS was driven by a need for abstraction and general knowledge, at least initially. He would spend three years at the prestigious school, from 1889 to 1892, and benefit from the lectures of some outstanding mathematicians: Charles Hermite (higher algebra), Paul Appell (rational mechanics), Gaston Darboux (higher geometry), Émile Picard (differential and integral 5 Maîtres et Élèves, célébrités et savants : l’École Normale Supérieure (1794–1994), Archives nationales, Paris (1994) 6 Idem, p. 71\n\n3\n\ncalculus) and, at the Faculté des Sciences, Henri Poincaré (probability calculus and mathematical physics). During his time at the ENS Borel would also forge some lasting friendships, notably with Élie Cartan, Jean Perrin, and Paul Langevin. His friendship with Paul Valéry, whom he met in the Parisian intellectual circles, followed a different path, as it was anchored in their shared Southern origins, mutual passion for the sea, and months of military service in the same barracks in Montpellier.7 A true breeding ground of illustrious scholars,8,9 the ENS provided Borel with a worldview in the largest sense of the word (one that included culture and intellectual life), which perhaps explains and anticipates his future choices and trajectory. Even before obtaining his first university degree (licence ès sciences) in 1891, Borel submitted two articles – on theorems of Humbert and Fouret and on semi-convergent series – that were published in the reputable journals Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques10 and Bulletin des Sciences Mathématiques,11 respectively. In 1892, he published a third article, on certain systems of differential equations, in the Annales de l’École Normale Supérieure.12 That same year, he sat his aggrégation examination to receive a teaching license and once again was top of his class; he was then only twenty-one. And then came the call for military service. The 1889 military law required all French citizens to serve for the same period of time, but ENS students underwent a special military training that allowed them to reduce their actual service period to one year,13 in order to prevent, in times of peace, too big a drop in the school’s enrolment. 7 É.\n\nBorel in Paul Valéry, vivant, Cahiers du Sud, Marseille (1946) et Élèves, célébrités et savants : l’École Normale Supérieure (1794–1994),\n\n8 Maîtres\n\nop. cit. 9 A.

Back in Paris, and even before having defended his dissertation, he was appointed Maître de conférences at the Faculty of Science of the University of Lille on a temporary basis. Obliged to share his time between Paris and Lille, between his research and his teaching, Borel took the frequent trips in stride, as they were well-suited to his dynamic disposition and stimulating for his work. He successfully defended his thesis less than one year later, in June 1894, at the Faculté des Sciences de Paris, before a jury composed of some illustrious names: Darboux, his thesis advisor and president of the jury, Appell, his future father-in-law, and Poincaré, as a reviewer. The title of his dissertation’s first topic, Sur quelques points de la théorie des fonctions, was remarkably unassuming. His thesis also included a second topic: on third-order partial differential equations, characteristic16 of families in triple orthogonal systems of surfaces with plane lines of curvature – at the time, doctorats d’état required a second, imposed topic, consisting of an analysis of papers already published in order to assess the candidate’s teaching ability and summarizing skills. 14 É.

Thanks to him I came to appreciate and admire Cauchy, an admiration that only grew as I got to know better the work of he who was considered the chief founder of modern analysis. Those who came after Cauchy, in particular Weierstrass and Riemann, introduced new points of view of undeniable potential. Under their influence, analysis became more rigorous, more subtle, and more abstract, leading to the summit of abstraction that was reached with Georg Cantor’s theories. I must confess that in the beginning I was seduced by Cantor’s ideas, as were many other young mathematicians; I don’t regret it, because they help open up the mind. But I always believed that those abstract concepts should be a means to a goal, not an end in themselves; in my view, the study of sets was only justified by its usefulness in the study of functions.20\n\nIt is in this spirit that he defined the measure of a set of points on the unit interval21 and showed the interest of the notion of sets of measure zero in the theory of functions. Borel devoted the period from 1894 to 1897, during which he was teaching at Lille, to a generalisation of the theory of analytic functions. In particular, he contemplated regarding as multi-valued certain single-valued functions. His commitment to the generalisation of certain mathematical concepts was in phase with the explosion of science in general, and particularly modern physics, to which many of his friends and colleagues were attracted. 17 Comptes rendus de l’Académie des Sciences, Bulletin des Sciences Mathématiques, Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques, Annales de l’École Normale Supérieure. 18 Notice sur les travaux scientifiques de M.

In the midst of so much success, what was to become of his private life? Borel’s hometown was not foremost in his mind and, despite the relatively long university holidays, his visits to Saint-Affrique were infrequent. But life went on – and so did death. Two family tragedies befell him just one year apart. In 1894, his brother-in-law died, leaving his sister Jeanne, then forty-nine, a widow with a four-year-old child. The following year his father suddenly passed away; an affective loss that might explain Borel’s need to so ardently serve the community to which his father had devoted almost fifty years of his life.\n\n22 É.

Among his students we find René Baire, Paul Montel, and Henri Lebesgue. He would later describe this period of his life as one during which “you are not sure whether you’re already a professor or still a student”.1 From 1899 to 1902 he also gave a course at the Collège de France, introducing young scientists to new and potentially fruitful perspectives on various branches of pure and applied mathematics. This course, known as the Cours Peccot, was created in 1899. Borel was the first and unique recipient for two consecutive years (originally, the course was to be given only once). At the dawn of the twentieth century, the University of Paris, known as the Sorbonne, counted among its mathematics and physics faculty a number of distinguished names: Gaston Darboux, who was also the dean 1 Jubilé scientifique de M. Émile Borel (January 14, 1940), Gauthier-Villars, Paris (1940), p. 76\n\nof the faculty, Paul Appell, Henri Poincaré, Paul Painlevé, and the future Nobel laureate in physics, Jean Perrin. Following the death of Pierre Curie in 1906, Marie Curie was appointed professor of general physics. As for Borel, who had assumed the role of professeur-adjoint in 1904, he had become the indisputable specialist of the theory of functions. In 1909 he was appointed to the chair Théorie des fonctions that had been created for him. Borel was then only thirty-eight years old. The doctoral theses presented in Paris during the years 1900–1910 demonstrate the diversity of research fields and the contributions of those French scholars who marked the contemporary history of science. Such an exceptional scientific community provided Borel with the occasion to imagine and develop new ways of communication addressed to a large audience. For example, the Revue du Mois was created by him in 1906 with the participation of several of his colleagues. However, the war would put a stop to his dynamic and promising university career. Later, in 1920, after peace had returned, Borel would occupy the chair of mathematical physics and probability calculus; he would remain in this post until his retirement in 1941.\n\nThe spirit of his teaching and research: Some firsthand accounts Here’s how some of Borel’s students remembered him: Robert Deltheil (ENS, 1909) – future professor and dean of the Faculty of Science of the University of Toulouse – observed that Borel’s teaching “was more like study supervision than formal lecture. There were impromptu discussions, with the master’s research work taking place before his students’ eyes, with his incisive mind and his constant concern for distinguishing what is essential from what is accessory”.2 Charles Maurain (ENS, 1890): “When I arrived at the École Normale, I found Borel’s presence everywhere. . . We were a group of students from the province, easily impressed by a world that was new to us. Intimidated by Borel’s reputation and prestige, we didn’t dare seek in2 R. Deltheil, Émile Borel, Revue du Rouergue, tome X (1956), no. 1, janvier–mars, pp. 1–14\n\n12\n\nformation or advice from him; it was he who would kindly come to us and, through informal conversations, helped us more than anyone else get a foothold on this new environment. It was for me the beginning of a long friendship, for which I always felt gratitude and respect”. Maurain still remembered Borel’s methods: “Thanks to his admirable insight he would come up with interesting ideas without taking the time to develop them himself, for his insatiable curiosity would soon take him in a new direction. Even though he left vast subjects for others to explore, he didn’t really abandon them, sparking their study and further development by his teaching and his numerous publications, such as the collection of monographs on the theory of functions – hence the large number of his students and the scope of his influence”.3 Gaston Julia (ENS, 1911) vividly recalled some traits of Borel’s personality and his behaviour during examinations: “A big man, dressed in black, sporting a black beard; with a brightness in the eye under the black eyebrow, he would walk back and forth along the rows, stopping from time to time to take a look over a student’s shoulder at the progress of his ‘research’. . . ” Julia adds: “The exam consisted of two parts: solving a problem in writing while the previous candidate was being assessed, and an oral examination at the blackboard. He would give us a small piece of paper with a question to be solved while the preceding candidate was plugging away at the board. Then, we picked up the chalk. . . and we had the impression of being dragged through every wet and muddy path of a wild forest. “I have a very precise memory of the ordeal I went through before admitting defeat. A single problem, at which we looked from every possible angle, and each time I succeeded in finding something new you would take me in a different direction. Your few but insidious questions; the occasional word to clarify some point; and then this final question over which I long struggled before hopelessly declaring, as I put down the chalk, that I didn’t understand anything anymore. But, to my astonishment, I didn’t come out completely defeated from this battle of Jacob with the Angel; your eyes lit up, and with a warm smile 3 C.\n\nMaurain in Annuaire de l’École Normale Supérieure (1954–1957), January 13, 1957, pp. 29–32\n\n13\n\nand a convincing tone you told me that ‘I was not expected to know everything’ ”.4 Another former student of Borel’s, George Bruhat, whose books in general physics would for many years be essential reading for license exam candidates, recalled his teacher’s very personal style and pedagogical choices: “In your lectures as in your works, you focused on what is really fundamental; you knew how to make us understand the essential features of the theories you presented, and the importance of avoiding secondary demonstrations. It is thanks to your lectures that I came to appreciate how fascinating the teaching of mathematics could be; if I could resist its appeal, it was only because I was already initiated to the pleasures of building devices and performing experiments”.5 In a clever and efficient way, Borel gathered around him several of his colleagues to write a monograph on the theory of functions. He was at first the only author; later, a team of French assistants and foreign colleagues joined him in the project, resulting in the production of an impressive number of volumes, ten of which were written by Borel himself. The reason he was able to achieve such a feat was probably due, as his student Maurice Fréchet pointed out,6 to the fact that he would only develop the subjects orally during his lectures, leaving the task of writing them down to one of his students, just as Poincaré did. He also demonstrated his flair for choosing his assistants, since most of them would later become university professors. Here is a partial list of volumes based on the courses he taught, and which he published, like a metronome, over a period of about ten years: Lessons on: Theory of Functions (1898), Integral Functions (1900), Divergent Series (1901), Series with Positive Terms (1902), Meromorphic Functions (1903), Functions of Real Variables (1905), the Theory of Growth (1909), and Monogenic Functions (1917) – whose publica4 G.

The complete collection consists of some forty volumes.\n\nPrizes and other teaching activities The years 1900–1905 saw Borel awarded a number of prizes: the Poncelet Prize (Geometry Section) awarded by the Académie des Sciences in 1901, and the 1904 Vaillant Prize for determining and studying all the displacements of an invariant figure of which the different points describe spherical curves. On this latter occasion he had entered the contest under a pseudonym.7 It was only after the results were announced that the jury learned the true identity of “Olinde Rodrigues” (the name of one of his wife’s relatives). In view of his repeated achievements, he was nominated several times to the Académie des Sciences, in 1900, 1901, and 1912, but each time he was passed over. Among his teaching activities, he served as a member of the École Navale entrance examination committee. A somewhat surprising undertaking, but one that showed Borel’s interest in, and passion for, marine sciences and, later, military navy. From 1901 to 1910 he performed his duties as examiner with distinction, as reports from the committee’s presidents testify. In 1901: “We couldn’t have made a better choice. The reputation of such an eminent mathematician could have intimidated the candidates, but he proved capable of asking even the hardest questions with extreme kindness and benevolence, thus allowing them to show their real competence”.8 In 1907: “An excellent examiner, absolutely impartial, with unequalled patience and insight. He would begin by asking simple questions to put the candidate at ease, and then, little by little, the examination often becomes extremely interesting”.9 7 Prix Vaillant, C. R. Acad. Sci. (1904), juillet–décembre, p. 1070; see also M. Husty, E. Borel’s and R. Bricard’s papers on displacements with spherical paths and their relevance to self-motions of parallel manipulators.

Between 1903 and 1910, he published a number of elementary mathematics texts in arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. These clearly written books, often illustrated with practical examples, were addressed not only to baccalauréat students but also to anyone seeking to learn without the pressure of having to take an exam. Years later, after the 1914–18 war, he would create the “Scientific Education Library”, a collection of volumes devoted to popular scientific culture. Here’s how he presented it: Our aim is to provide the reader with the basic tools for acquiring a true scientific education, without the burden and preoccupation of having to prepare for examinations. These days, we need scientific culture as much as we do literary and artistic cultures. If the former appears more difficult to acquire, it’s because most books, written for an audience with specific needs, often put off those seeking knowledge without the sanction of a diploma.11\n\nAmong the titles in the collection, we find Principles of Algebra and Analysis (1924), Geometry and Imaginary Numbers, co-authored by Robert Deltheil (1932), and Mechanics and Universal Gravitation (1942). Well aware of the importance of popularizing all branches of science without sacrificing rigour, he recruited other authors to contribute books in various fields, such as Energy, Matter, and Light, by the physicist Jean Perrin, and the zoologist Octave Duboscq’s The Cell in Primitive Organisms. 9 Idem,\n\n(Année 1907), Paris, October 23, 1907 from É.

Borel, Preface to the presentation of the series “Bibliothèque d’éducation scientifique” (Scientific Education Library). In: Principes d’algèbre et d’analyse, Albin Michel, Paris (1924) 10 Letter\n\n16\n\nPedagogy for children and psychological research on creativity and imagination were also subjects that attracted Borel’s attention. To help develop different thought mechanisms, he did not hesitate to resort to very simple arithmetic questions, such as “How much is one-third plus half of one-third of 100?”12 “Someone who follows to the letter the statement of the question”, he wrote, “will, with more or less difficulty, first compute one-third of 100, that is, 33.333; then divide it by 2, and finally perform the addition. A person with some notions of arithmetic will observe that one-third plus half of one-third make 3/6, that is one-half, and therefore simply divide 100 by 2. Finally, someone used to employing geometric intuition will immediately visualise a segment OA divided in three equal parts by two points B and C, and intuitively see that the midpoint of BC is also the midpoint of OA. This person will arrive at the answer by taking a direct, immediate path, with no calculations”. O\n\nB\n\nC\n\nA\n\nM This example, almost trivial, conceals under its surface Borel’s subtler work on sets of points of the interval [0, 1] and their properties: measurable sets, open or closed, rarefaction – a notion he introduced to establish a classification and a scale among “zero” probabilities – , transfinite numbers, and geometric probability, among others.\n\nMarried life begins: The Borel–Appell union In her last book,13 Camille Marbo (née Marguerite Appell) charmingly described the cultural environment of her youth, the university life of her father, Paul Appell, and the first encounters with her future husband. At the time, she lived in Paris with her parents at 6, rue Le Verrié, near the Luxembourg Gardens, where her father would meet with friends 12 É. Borel, Documents sur la psychologie de l’invention dans le domaine des sciences, Organon (Warsaw), 1 (1935), pp. 33–42 13 C. Marbo, À travers deux siècles : souvenirs et rencontres (1883–1967), Bernard Grasset, Paris (1967), pp. 53–63\n\n17\n\nand colleagues, in particular Darboux and Painlevé. She mentions a “scientific dinner” to which Borel was invited for the first time. But Émile forgot the date and did not show up. Made aware of his impoliteness by Darboux, he apologised to Mme Appell. This missed invitation would teach Borel a lesson: Punctuality became for him an imperative, and he made it a golden rule for family members, his assistants and, later, his drivers – an obsession with punctuality that became legendary. By 1898 Borel had become a frequent guest of the family. Marguerite was then fifteen. Borel continued his visits after the Appells left Paris for Saint-Germain-en-Laye, in the western suburbs. In a passage of her book, Marbo observes that “this mathematician likes to dance and is not averse to worldly pleasures. He is tall, dark-haired, with beautiful golden eyes and a thick beard”.14 He asked her hand in marriage on the day of her eighteenth birthday, April 11, 1901. The wedding took place at the City Hall six months later, on October 12, in the presence of their families. Among the witnesses of the wedding was Borel’s friend Paul Painlevé, who at thirty-seven was already a member of the Académie des Sciences. In the tradition of the “Belle Époque”, the newlywed couple left for a four-week honeymoon in Italy. They visited Bellagio, Venice and its palaces, and the island of Murano, before pursuing their tour of Italian cities with stops in Milan, Pisa, and Florence. The journey back to France was, just as their future would be, cosmopolitan and maritime, with a rough sea crossing from Genoa to Marseille in a cargo ship, punctuated by some picturesque stopovers. Back in Paris, they moved into the apartment Borel had occupied during his single years, at 30, boulevard Saint-Germain. An exhausted young Marguerite had a miscarriage that was followed by complications. To their great despair, they realised that they would never be able to have children. Their social life revolved around a group of ENS graduates, scientists, and intellectuals: Jean Perrin, Paul Langevin, the mathematicians Jules Drach and Paul Montel, the poet and essayist Charles Peguy, the politician and future prime minister Édouard Herriot, Pierre and Marie 14 Idem,\n\np. 20\n\n18\n\nCurie, and the poet and philosopher Paul Valéry. Such a rich intellectual environment provided a fertile ground for Marguerite’s literary aspirations. The sudden death of Émile’s eldest sister Jeanne Lebeau, in 1903, prompted the Borels to take under their care Jeanne’s son, Fernand, who was then only thirteen. Assuming the role of an adoptive father and now responsible for his nephew’s schooling, Borel enrolled Fernand at the Lycée Louis le Grand. In order to accommodate the larger family, the couple moved into a more spacious house, at 2, boulevard Arago.\n\nThe Revue du Mois In 1905, Borel won the Prix Petit d’Ormoy. The mathematical prize was accompanied by a monetary reward, and the Borels decided to use the money to create an imaginative periodical, La Revue du Mois. An editorial board headed by Borel and made up of friends and colleagues was appointed. Marguerite, who had adopted the pen name “Camille Marbo” – a combination of the first syllables of her given and married names – was in charge of proofreading and typesetting. The first issue of the magazine came out in January 1906, with articles by Vito Volterra, a professor at the University of Rome, on mathematics in biology and the social sciences, and by Gaston Darboux, on the life and works of Charles Hermite. Every month, the Revue would feature original perspectives on scientific culture, economic and social life, and political developments, while keeping abreast, at the approach of 1914, of German technical and military organisation. Among the articles contributed by Borel, and likely to capture a large readership, were “Graphology and the scientific method”, “The social role of amateur scientists”, and “Probability calculus and the individualist mentality”. The magazine, which at one point counted one-thousand subscribers, owed its success to the quality of the subjects treated on its pages, often connected to current events. But the war would gradually disrupt the operations of this distinctive publication. The 1915 issues were devoted to the dramatic events shaking the country, and the focus shifted to such topics as an inventory of the technical and military resources and the 19\n\nanalysis of public opinion on the war. Publication ceased following the general call-up and the increasing number of casualties. Among these, the Revue’s secretary, who was killed in action. Borel, for his part, joined the artillery regiment. La Revue du Mois would see light again in 1919 for a short period of time but remained faithful to its spirit. The December 1920 issue would be the last. In it, Borel insisted on the importance of a scientific vision of tomorrow’s world, based on international exchanges, and he expressed his hope of resuming publication in the future.15\n\nNew administrative duties and a foreign mission Scientific direction of the ENS Following the death of Jules Tannery in 1910, Borel was appointed scientific director and assistant director of the École Normale Supérieure, the institution he had entered as a student twenty-one years earlier. He considered this promotion as “an honour he didn’t deserve”, given the influence and reputation of the man he had admired at the beginning of his studies. He would later say that this was the most important change in his career since his admission to the ENS: The years between this date and the war of 1914 were among the happiest of my life. . . later darkened by the terrible slaughter of young men.16\n\nThe Borels moved into the apartment provided by the school, which had been occupied earlier by Louis Pasteur when he was administrator and director of scientific studies.17 From the beginning of his tenure Borel took a particular interest in student life, and organised weekly working lunches to facilitate the dialogue across disciplines. A series of foreign trips to represent the university then began; notably to Italy, where he met his friend Vito Volterra at the University 15 The magazine Vient de Paraître would feature a scientific section named La Revue du Mois, from 1923 to 1925. 16 Selecta : jubilé scientifique de M. Émile Borel, Gauthier-Villars, Paris (1940), p. 71 17 Maîtres et Élèves, célébrités et savants : l’École Normale Supérieure (1794–1994), Archives nationales, Paris (1994), p. 47\n\n20\n\nof Rome, and Hungary, to attend the inauguration of Eötvös József Collegium, an institution modelled on the ENS. This administrative period weighed heavy on Borel.18 Shortly before the war, there were plenty of problems to worry about. Besides staff shortages, the recruitment of new candidates was made difficult by the appeal of other prestigious careers that attracted the French elites towards the business world. Borel sounded the alarm and warned the ministry that beyond a certain rank the only candidates left were those who didn’t gain admission to the École Polytechnique; action was needed to put things back on an even keel. In addition, in 1913 the ENS administration faced new challenges: The recently passed military law obliged students to participate in regular periods of military training, and for the 1913 academic year the school was compelled to double the number of admissions without receiving additional funding.\n\nThe Curie affair It was around this time that a campaign of slander against Marie Curie broke out in the press, prompting the Borels to stand up for her with tenacity and determination. Several books19,20,21 give an account of the facts: the events were brought to a head a few years after the death of Pierre Curie, during the Solvay Conference that took place in Brussels in October 1911. Among the participants we find Planck, de Broglie, Rutherford, Einstein, Lorentz, Poincaré, Perrin, Langevin, and Marie Curie. A smear campaign was launched to destroy Curie’s career. She was an easy prey for the tabloids, which denounced her origins, her work, and her friendship with Paul Langevin – a married man – misrepresenting her as a foreign Jewish home-wrecker.\n\n18 P.

No. 149))\n\n23\n\nThe Borels strongly supported the twice-Nobel Prize laureate. After an angry mob gathered in front of Curie’s home, they offered her shelter in their apartment, despite the opposition of Paul Appell, who asked his daughter and son-in-law to reconsider their decision. Borel was summoned by the minister of higher education and threatened with dismissal for allowing Curie to stay at government premises. With his future at the ENS in the balance, Borel stood his ground and replied: “Mme Curie shall stay at my place as long as she wishes. If I should be fired for having served a just cause, it will make me proud.”22 The minister did not insist. The story eventually went away, both in the press and among certain members of the university. It is important to emphasise the crucial role played by the Borels in this affair, at a time when Sweden was about to award Curie her second Nobel Prize for the discovery of radium in December 1911. A deep friendship developed between the Borels and Marie Curie that would last until her death in 1934.\n\nScientific mission to the USA A few months after the death of his mother, Borel, now aged forty, was chosen to replace Poincaré, whose health had deteriorated, as France’s representative to the inauguration of the recently created Rice University in Houston, Texas. It was an opportunity for the Borels to take some time off for themselves. They left in August 1912 on the transatlantic liner Espagne and would not be back in Paris until the beginning of winter. Rather than taking the most direct maritime route to New York (the tragedy of the Titanic had taken place only a few months earlier), they embarked on an original and colorful adventure that took them first to Cuba, then to Key West, Florida, and finally, after visiting New Orleans, by train to Houston. Borel gave two talks at the university’s inauguration: “Molecular theories and mathematics”, where he developed some novel concepts and showed the relevance of numerical analysis for the study of con22 Idem,\n\np. 113\n\n24\n\ntinuous, discontinuous and distribution functions, and “Aggregates of zero measure”, where he presented his latest results on zero-measure sets.23,24 Their journey of discovery of the New World would include other stops before reaching New York: the University of Illinois UrbanaChampaign, the University of Chicago, Cambridge, in Boston, and finally Princeton. They travelled back to Paris on the SS France, the first liner built at the French shipyards. Borel resumed his university duties, while Camille Marbo put the finishing touches on her novel La Statue Voilée, for which she would receive the 1913 Prix Femina.\n\nA penchant for the concrete: Novel scientific and technical approaches At the dawn of the Great War, three books clearly indicated the new direction of Borel’s thought: In 1909 he published Éléments de la théorie des probabilités, in which probability and its applications become, in his own words, a tool for the experimental sciences. It was followed, in 1910, by l’Aviation, coauthored by Paul Painlevé, aimed at popularising and foreseeing the modern means of transportation. And in 1914, the release of Le Hasard provided a subtle and concrete vision of how the science of chance can be applied to numerous fields of activity. These three books seemed to mark a complete departure from the line of research he had pursued up until then. But, in fact, they were merely an expression of his personality: his penchant for concrete action, his interest in the applications of theory to real-world situations, and his search for practical solutions to complex problems in collective life. These character traits would later show up and contribute to his successful political career.\n\n23 É.

Borel, Aggregates of zero measure, Rice Inst. Pamphlets, vol. IV, January 1917, no. 1, pp. 1–21\n\n25\n\nElements of the Theory of Probability This book was primarily written for “practical users”, given the number of applications to questions in physics, biology, and economics. As Borel put it in the preface, “those interested in applications do not always have the opportunity to study in depth the mathematical theories of probability; moreover, for them, these theories are of only secondary interest, since they are mostly looking for a theory of general methods”. Borel presents the basic notions of a probabilistic analysis and gives plenty of concrete examples (the Heads or Tails game, lottery drawings, and so forth). Besides these examples addressed to non-specialists, it is interesting to place Borel’s thinking in the context of theoretical physics, which in those years was making prodigious progress. Borel distances himself from Henri Poincaré’s views (for example, on the St. Petersburg’s paradox and the small planets problem) a topic so well discussed by Bernard Bru and Pierre Crépel at the 1999 Colloque in Saint-Affrique.25 To draw-in the reader, he chooses some simple cases, such as drawing balls from urns containing balls of different colours and the problem of ranking groups of students according to their level of achievement by random testing. He puts forward the idea that when the causes of an event are not well known, there is necessarily confusion in the analysis of the problem, but this analysis is essential in making decisions, as is evaluating the correlation between causes and events. Due to its huge success, the book was reprinted and augmented several times. Two other series on the same subject would follow: Traité du calcul des probabilités et de ses applications. Tome 1 à 4 (1925–1939) and Probabilités, Erreurs (1923; 1954). Finally, the well-known series “Que sais-je ?”, published by Presses Universitaires de France, would release two other titles by Borel: during the war years, Les statistiques et la vie (1943) and, only a few years before his death, Probabilités et certitudes (1950). It is also worth mentioning the series Monographies\n\n25 P. Crépel and B. Bru, Émile Borel et le calcul des probabilités, Archives de la Maison de la Mémoire, Saint Affrique, 12400\n\n26\n\nsur les Probabilités (Librairie Gauthier-Villars), of which he was the director, and featuring a number of authors besides Borel.\n\nChance Published five years later, the book is a natural sequel to the previous one, clearly addressed to a wide audience. Borel points out the relevance of the science of chance in facilitating reflection before action “by all reasonable beings”. He writes: “In the analysis of any question, common sense needs to be guided by the results of calculations; formulas do not create a shrewd mind, but they facilitate its use”. In this dawn of the twentieth century, when all of physics is still based on rational mechanics, he shows the need to embark on a true scientific revolution, since “the traditional mechanical explanations are insufficient, and must give way to statistical ones”. In those days of fundamental discoveries on radioactivity and its mechanisms, Borel presents the new concepts of quantum mechanics and irreversible thermodynamic processes. To capture the reader’s imagination, he chooses the right examples; the most famous is undoubtedly that of the monkeys typing at random. An example that is remarkable because it illustrates the notion of a practically impossible event, that is, one whose probability is extremely small, without any calculations: “Let’s imagine an army of one million monkeys, each sitting in front of a typewriter; they are trained to press the keys at random, and they work at this task ten hours per day under the surveillance of illiterate foremen. Each day, the foremen would collect the sheets typed by the monkeys and bind them into volumes. After one year, we can imagine that, by a miraculous coincidence, these volumes would contain the exact copy of all books of every kind in every language kept in libraries all over the world. . . and in the National Library”. The probability of such a “miracle”, even though extremely small, is not strictly speaking zero. Therein lies the subtlety of the argument. Other examples include the paradox of the “pile of grains of wheat”. How many grains constitute a pile? One grain doesn’t, neither do two. If we keep adding grains, we would eventually have a “pile”, although it 27\n\nwill be impossible to tell exactly at which point this happened – that is, the point at which a non-pile became a pile by the addition of a single grain. There is no logical way out of the impasse; the notion of “pile of grains” defies definition. Borel then transposes this idea to a subject he knows well: the expression of thought and the writing of a book. How many words? What should the number and the length of the sentences be? What choices are reasonable? He shows in this way that when we are confronted with making decisions, we should make them based on “statistical truths” as a way out of the logical deadlock resulting from “reasoning by continuity”. Finally, drawing on his earlier theoretical work and by an analysis of numbers in the context of set theory, he shows how to combine statistical analysis and the theory of functions, a synthesis he would later mention at his scientific jubilee in January 1940.\n\nAviation Borel also had a passion for aviation. The spirit of the times fostered such enthusiasm, with the exploits of those pioneers of the “mechanical genius”, in particular the French, who succeeded in building machines heavier than air that could fly ever faster and higher. Issy-les-Moulineaux, at the edge of Paris, witnessed the first flights. In 1908, the first Aeronautics Show was held in Paris. That same year, Louis Bleriot managed an eight-minute flight, and the American Wright brothers stunned the world at Avours. Eager to enlighten the general public with a better knowledge of the new technology, Painlevé and Borel published l’Aviation, as part of the “New Scientific Series”. It provides an analysis of flight mechanics based on the expertise and experience of the time, besides describing the various record-breaking airplanes that would soon be followed by the first fighter planes engaged in the Great War. A number of technical notes explain the role of each parameter, the future of certain peculiar aircrafts (helicopter, gyroplane), the importance of navigational instruments, and the ongoing research on decreasing the mass of those flying machines. There are also hints on what the future 28\n\nof aviation will look like – non-stop and long courier flights, and air security and regulation problems. Besides treating a subject of current interest, the book fitted well with an initiative of the Faculté des Sciences in Paris, which had created an aero-technical research laboratory. In line with maintaining his commitment to the communication of knowledge before the onset of the war, Borel wrote Introduction géométrique à quelques idées physiques, a book that combines physics and mathematics. Released in 1914, it discusses the elements of relativity, statistical mechanics, and the new notions in atomic and molecular theories. He finished the book at the Saint-Paul-des-Fonts family home, where the Borels so much enjoyed receiving friends, notably the Perrins, Langevins, and Marie and Irène Curie.\n\n29\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Great War and the return to peace (1914–1924) The draft: The Front and the Ministry of Defense When war broke out in August 1914, Borel was not immediately put on active service for several reasons: First of all, his age (he was forty-three); also, the fact that since October 1911, he had been a Reservist1 and, finally, his important duties as director of the ENS, where his presence was deemed essential. But events were moving fast and the situation becoming so critical that new categories were drafted. Current and recently graduated students of the ENS left for training as Reserve sub-lieutenants, as did students from other grandes écoles. The ENS would no longer serve as a higher education institution, but became instead an auxiliary hospital as part of the effort to relieve the military hospitals in Paris. Élie Cartan was in charge of the administration. He could count on the help of several wives of university colleagues who acted as nurses; among these was Marguerite, who, in particular, cared for the morale of wounded newcomers. 1 P.\n\nJeannin, École Normale Supérieure : livre d’or, Office français de diffusion artistique et littéraire, Paris (1963)\n\nDuring the first months of the conflict the loss among former ENS students was heavy: of the 265 enrolled at the École between 1910 and 1913, 109 were killed in action. Borel, for his part, was drafted on February 23, 1915. He initially reported to the High Command; then, one month later, to the Second Heavy Artillery Regiment. He was temporarily appointed Reserve sub-lieutenant and soon after commander of a sound localisation section on the Fourth Army front. His mission consisted of implementing the new electro-acoustic techniques to locate enemy batteries. These techniques had been developed at the ENS by the physicists Aimé Cotton and Pierre Weiss. In October 1915, Borel was awarded the Croix de Guerre avec palme for the successful accomplishment of the mission. His citation in the French Army’s “Order of the Day” reads: “He installed sound localisation stations all along the Army Corps’ front; on numerous occasions he carried out reconnaissance missions in heavily bombarded areas to set up new stations or to check the workings of the instruments”.2 That same year, Paul Painlevé entrusted Borel with the task of organising the recently created Service of Inventions of Interest to National Defense (SIDN). His new post would become an important support to the organisation of the defense. It was imperative to make up for Germany’s industrial lead – both in artillery and in combat materials in general – but first, he needed to recruit competent personnel and define the goals and objectives of the Service. Borel set up an applied mathematics and computation group headed by himself, with Charles Maurain and Henri Lebesgue as close assistants. Under difficult conditions, the varied characters and dispositions of these men were put to the test. Borel was true to his reputation as a quick and efficient organiser, while Lebesgue, a solitary man, worked in isolation and persisted in being a skeptical researcher. The letters Lebesgue addressed to Borel during those war years are most revealing; they show their often opposing reactions, and rekindle old rivalries about the paternity of certain mathematical concepts (definition of the measure of sets of points of the unit interval, zero-measure sets, and so forth).3 However, in the short 2 Ordre 3 P.\n\nno. 408, IVème Armée, October 28, 1915 Dugac and B. Bru, Cahiers du séminaire d’Histoire des mathématiques, no. 12,\n\n32\n\nterm at least, Borel imposed his agenda so that artillery and adjustment of fire remained SIDN priorities. In 1917, as the war dragged on, Painlevé became prime minister, and Borel private secretary appointed to technical services, and later secretary general of the premier’s council. In a difficult political and military atmosphere that carried the weight of its recent past (the failure of the April 1917 offensive, the mutinies), Borel, now close to the circles of power, was confronted with the seriousness of the situation. In the autumn of 1917, the new government of Georges Clemenceau took the reins of the nation. Borel, promoted to lieutenant on October 1, 1917, and despite his age (he was now forty-six), requested to be redeployed to the Eighty-eighth Heavy Artillery Regiment. On January 1, 1918, he took the command of the Sixth Battery and once again would participate in war operations; first at Montdidier, Belgium, and later at Moreuil, France.4 He is cited in the Regiment’s “Order of the Day”: “Officer showing the highest military qualities and having the most extensive technical knowledge. His devotion and unrelenting energy were an inspiration to all his personnel. On August 28, ordered to occupy an advanced position, he carried out in the allotted time frame the particularly difficult mission despite the losses suffered under heavy bombardment”.5 He was promoted to reserve captain, and made Officer of the Legion of Honour by the minister of war in November 1918. During this period, he carried out a scientific mission for the Italian government, in particular in Rome, on behalf of the Office of Inventions. Italy had already honoured him with the rank of Commander of the Order of the Royal Crown in November 1917.6 After the armistice, Borel would retain his military status and serve in the Ministry of Industrial Reconstruction. He ceased active service on Université Paris VI, Laboratoire de mathématiques fondamentales (1991) 4 É.

Although exempt from military duties, Captain Borel would remain a member of the army until 1929.\n\nThe death of Fernand Lebeau We recall Borel’s family situation. Borel’s nephew, Fernand Lebeau, became an orphan at thirteen and, in 1904, was taken in by his uncle to pursue his studies in Paris. Like his adoptive father, he was a brilliant student with a keen interest in the physical sciences,7 and in 1909 he obtained his engineering degree. After completing his second year of military service and soon after the war broke out, he was promoted to sub-lieutenant. As commander of a company, he was highly appreciated for his professionalism in a role he had not chosen. Fernand was killed in action in September 1915, at age twenty-five. News of his passing reached Marguerite Borel one month later, while her husband was at the Front. Fernand’s remains would join those of thousands of others in the graves of unknown soldiers.\n\nPostwar years: New scientific and international activities On his return to civilian life, Borel’s grief was immense: The loss of his nephew was like a terrible open wound for him and Marguerite. The ENS, to which they were so attached, had paid a very heavy price during the war. In his post as scientific director Borel no longer felt the same commitment to his task; the spark that had animated him in the beginning had now gone: “The school became filled with shadows. Young faces that we will no longer see crop up at every corner. All of Fernand’s friends, except Deltheil (who was wounded twice) are dead”.8 Marguerite’s family had not been spared either – her brother Pierre 7 R. Deltheil in Annuaire de l’Association des anciens élèves de l’École Normale Supérieure (1917), pp. 130–133 8 C. Marbo, À travers deux siècles : souvenirs et rencontres (1883–1967), Bernard Grasset, Paris (1967), p. 171\n\n34\n\nwas second-in-command of the submarine Monge, sunk by an Austrian cruiser along the Yugoslav coast in 1916.9 Borel could no longer bear the grieving atmosphere of the school and had lost interest in higher mathematics: “I’ll resign, even if we have to cut down on expenses”,10 he said to Marguerite. The Borels’ life then took on a new direction. They moved out of their residence at the school and rented the apartment his in-laws had vacated on rue du Bac. Three significant events took place between 1920 and 1924, in the aftermath of the war: an official trip to China with Painlevé, Borel’s appointment to the Académie des Sciences and, finally, on the scientific but also political front, Albert Einstein’s visit to Paris.\n\nMission to China Shortly after resigning from his post at the ENS, Borel was asked by Paul Painlevé to join him on a trip of several months to China. The former prime minister had been invited by the Chinese government as a technical advisor with the task of improving the organisation of the country’s railway and transportation systems. The invitation allowed for the possibility of adding a science education component: a series of lectures on new pedagogical methods to be given by Borel at various Chinese schools. The mission, sponsored by the ministry of foreign affairs,11 took place from June to September 1920, only a few months after the creation of the League of Nations. Their long journey was more like an expedition. They left from the port of Le Havre for New York, crossed the continent from east to west by train, and boarded a ship in Vancouver to finally arrive in China from the Pacific via Japan and Korea.12 During their stay, Borel and Painlevé shared with school authorities and teachers their rich common experience, insight, and vision on school curricula and 9 Pierre Appell (1887–1957), Toulon – Service Historique de la Marine, Musée national de la marine 10 C.

Painlevé, Paroles et écrits, Rieder, Paris (1936)\n\n35\n\nelementary training in mathematics. At the time, France was highly regarded as an authority on education. The province of Yunnan, in southwestern China, where Protestant churches were established by French missionaries coming from Indochina and teaching the French language,13 was most certainly one of the regions visited by the two mathematicians.14 As a token of appreciation and gratitude for his contribution to the mission’s success, the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) government awarded Borel an official decoration, a medal stamped with old Chinese characters referring to culture and education. Following an ancient tradition, the symbols were coined in mirror image, to divert the attention of evil spirits.15\n\nMembership to the Académie des Sciences 1921 was a year marked by the recognition of Borel’s scientific accomplishments. Besides his appointment to the mathematical physics and probability calculus chair – formerly occupied by Boussinesq and Poincaré – the fifty-year-old Borel finally became Member of the Académie des Sciences as the successor of the deceased Georges Humbert (Geometry section).16 He was elected after obtaining forty-eight of the fifty-four votes cast – Henri Lebesgue came a distant second with only four ballots. One year later, he would also serve as a member of the jury for several prestigious mathematical prizes, such as the Montyon and the Petit d’Ormoy.17 With a renewed interest in theoretical research, Borel aimed at linking probability to mathematical physics and unifying the various trends in modern physics. In a scientific note, he cautioned physicists against an overuse of a “mathematical framework that sometimes only serves to conceal the shortcomings of the hypotheses and the arguments”.18 13 P.\n\nRaibaud, personal communication (1997) remains to be confirmed. 15 R.

Finally, in line with his early ideas on the theory of functions, he established the importance of probability in the study of sets of points of the real line.\n\nAlbert Einstein’s visit to Paris Borel’s position at the University of Paris and, in particular, his kinship with Paul Langevin, led him to support Einstein’s special theory of relativity – he was one of the first in France to do so – and later his general theory. In 1922, he published L’espace et le temps, a book popularizing the subject.20 With the painful memory of the war still vivid, news of the invitation that Langevin had extended to Einstein, then professor at the University of Berlin, caused a certain turmoil. The visit therefore required some special arrangements for the transportation and the stay of their illustrious colleague. The Collège de France organised a lecture to be given by Einstein on March 31, 1922 for a scientific audience. Another was given six days later at the French Philosophical Society. Among those present at the second talk were literary figures and philosophers such as Henri Bergson, Paul Valéry, and the Romanian-French writer and poet Anna de Noailles, who was said to be captivated by geometry and an admirer of abstract mathematical research.21 The visit to Paris resulted in the creation of close ties between Einstein and the French university community, aimed at promoting the goals of the League of Nations through the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation. Contact between Borel and Einstein would continue until the latter’s departure for Princeton in 1933.

In a letter of July 10, 1930, Borel asked Einstein to write a few words in preface to the volume, but the famous physicist, at the time afflicted with health and family problems, never obliged. In the end, it was the book’s translator, H. Schutze, who wrote an introduction with the title “Der Leser und Einstein” (The Reader and Einstein).\n\n40\n\nChapter 4\n\nFrom science to politics (1924–1940) The beginnings of a parliamentary career Borel’s political calling came late in his life – he was fifty-three – but its roots were deep. The war had changed his outlook, and what he now wanted above all things was to participate in the reconstruction of his country, victorious but weakened. He would face many challenges: Which methods to choose? By which means? Towards which goals? How to get organised? The victory, obtained at a high cost, had awakened in public opinion a desire for a lasting peace. Borel saw in the creation of the League of Nations a glimmer of hope, and in the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation (ICIC), formed in Geneva in 1922, a powerful lever. The executive organ of the ICIC, the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation, was established in Paris in 1924 with the aid of the French government. Its aim was to promote an exchange of knowledge and ideas essential to peace, by cooperation with regard to scientific, literary, and artistic progress. Paul Valéry called this “politics of the mind”, a vehicle for the large-scale development of culture as the foundation for sustainable peace.\n\nA fervently committed Borel expressed his views forcefully in the press, and later collected and revised his articles in a book with the trenchant title Organiser.1 The urgency and importance of the problems naturally pushed him towards a new mission: political activism. In the work, he identified the four pillars of his action: (1) Peace, at a time when Europe was facing the critical problem of disarmament and France’s role in it, owing to her culture (French was widely used in official communications) and her ideals. “It is imperative”, he wrote, “that all over the world, peoples suffering injustice and yearning for freedom look up to France for protection and help. It is by pursuing an idealistic policy that we shall better serve our own interests; if we had not been known, in 1914, as defenders of human rights, the world would not have come to help us liberate our country from occupation”.2 (2) The citizen, whose future he couldn’t imagine without a larger worldview. “What is happening in the United States has a direct impact on the French farmer or worker, in regard to their taxes, benefits, and wages. The day citizens of free nations will be entirely convinced that the knowledge of foreign countries is now necessary to whoever has the interests of his country – that is, his own interests – at heart, that day world peace and prosperity would have taken a great leap forward”.3 (3) Europe. He promoted the idea that the problem of the organisation of Europe “requires the gradual construction of the United States of Europe, together with, for financial and economic questions, the transfer of some degree of national sovereignty to this super state that would be the League of European Nations [. . . ]. The country that would refuse to negotiate trade agreements with its neighbours and accept some of their demands would be condemned to isolation and ruin”. Troubled to see Europe so slow in recovering its moral equilibrium, he vigorously declared that “in order for Europe to heal, we must first heal the crisis of the mind” (an expression dear to Paul Valéry).4 1 É.\n\nBorel, Organiser, Librairie Félix Alcan, Paris (1925) p. 33 3 Idem, p. 35 4 Idem, p. 218 2 Idem,\n\n42\n\n(4) Education. He took up a subject familiar to him, that of the education system: the role to be played by science in education and culture in general (“science allows us to better understand the mechanisms of human reason”),5 a reorganisation of the disciplines to be taught in order to establish their complementarity,6 and, finally, technical training, long neglected and deserving an honourable place. He observed that “in the economic struggle, becoming more ruthless every day, it is the quality of their technical training that will determine which nations come out on top”. He concluded with an analysis of the fundamental question of the quality of entrance examinations (to the grandes écoles) and exams in general, pointing out the need for alternative ways of gaining access to professional training. It was in January 1924 that Borel declared his intention to run for deputy. He gave an account of the circumstances in a speech addressed to the minister of industry and commerce, Eugene Raynaldy, at a banquet in Paris in October of the same year: Last January, you called on me at the Académie des Sciences and asked me to join your party’s list. I initially responded that such honour belonged to my friend Étienne Fournol, whom you had not succeeded in recruiting as a candidate. You then told me that it was the duty of those from Aveyron who had left their homeland and came to Paris not to forget their fellow citizens that stayed behind. I must admit that your plea touched me deeply, and, after consultation with my friends from Saint-Affrique, a few weeks later I accepted your invitation.7\n\nThe election campaign got underway, with its rallies in support of the leftist cartel (Radical Socialist party), and confrontations with the traditional right, through the press, speeches, and posters.8 The results of the vote, although extremely close, handed Borel the success he had hoped for. The support of miners, railway workers and, to a lesser extent, glovemakers, proved decisive to his victory.9,10 5 Idem,\n\np. 238 p. 298 7 Speech given by É.

Marguerite became his personal secretary in charge of departmental affairs, while he travelled between Paris and Saint-Affrique, enduring the laborious railway journeys, to visit his constituency, lecture at the Sorbonne, and participate in parliamentary sittings and committees. His life, now divided between Paris and Rouergue, was to become even more full by his taking on new duties, far removed from the scientific realm that was his initial calling, but which would provide a new balance, answering to its own dynamics.\n\nThe Ministry of the Navy and the Naval budget Prime minister Paul Painlevé appointed Borel as minister of the navy in April 1925, a post he would occupy for only six months.11 But in this short period of time he and his team managed several noteworthy accomplishments: the organisation of naval schools, the statutes of the fleet crew and the mechanical engineer corps,12,13 and the development of rules for the definition of military materials (weaponry, tests, periodic ship maintenance).14 On the aviation front (the book written with Painlevé was proof of his knowledge of the field), Borel issued a directive for the organisation of naval air forces, including the creation of personnel training centres, the conversion of cruisers into aircraft carriers,15 and new promotion criteria for pilots that would take flight hours into consideration.16 Borel also initiated a program for the construction of seven submarines, whose names reflected his affinities: Pascal, Pasteur, Monge, Poincaré, Poncelet, Fresnel, and Archimède.17 9 La\n\nDépêche du Midi, May 13, 1924, pp. 1, 3; Archives de l’Aveyron, Rodez Catholique, no. 111, May 13, 1924; Archives de l’Aveyron, Rodez 11 Annuaire de la Marine 1925, Imprimerie Nationale, Paris (1925), p. 47 12 Bull. off.

This medal, which he received from the Bey of Tunisia, Muhammad VI al-Habib, was a symbolic reference to his mathematical work. The anagram, carved in Arabic characters, signified that the “measures” taken with the Bey came from the book of Allah and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad.19 Well aware of the role the navy could play in international missions, Borel invited his old friend Paul Valéry for a trip of several weeks aboard one of the ships of the Mediterranean fleet. To convince his high command of the relevance of the invitation, Borel alleged the interest surrounding the upcoming appointment of the “poet of the sea” to the Académie Française. Valéry was thus host of Admiral Dumesnil aboard the cruiser Provence in July 1925.20,21 Borel defended the interests of the navy not only during his short tenure as minister, but in multiple other occasions. As a member of the finance committee, he drew up the bill establishing the Navy’s 1934 budget and spelled out the resources to be engaged on the military level.22 In the text, after a critical analysis of the maritime situation and an assessment of the fire power capabilities of the major nations’ fleets, he proposed developing maritime aviation and requested a corresponding transfer of funds from the Air Force budget to that of the Navy. He had foreseen the tactical and strategic importance of aircraft carriers in future conflicts, and his analysis of the situation, which had little effect on France’s policy in the short term, would be amply vindicated and prove formidably efficient less than ten years later in the Pa18 Idem,\n\n(1944–1945), p. 29 Krichen, doctoral student at École Centrale de Lyon, personal communication 20 É.

In 1933 he wrote: “Given its important role in searching, fighting, reconnoitring and protecting ships, maritime aviation must be closely linked, by traditions, usages, combat methods, and commandment, to other naval forces, whose operations it amplifies and completes”.26 He emphasised the need to replace as soon as possible the outmoded fighter planes with more powerful and better adapted ones, and not to rely only on the single existing aircraft carrier, Bearn. He also insisted on the urgency to ensure that future navy officers were properly trained by completing the construction of the Naval School, the ministry of the budget having foolishly withdrawn its funding.\n\nLife as a member of parliament: His three terms between the two wars The national issues of particular interest to Borel arose from his participation in various parliamentary committees: external affairs, military navy, mines, and education and fine arts. On each of these he worked incessantly, tirelessly, and enthusiastically. Camille Marbo quotes him: What I enjoy, is having lunch on Sunday with Rigaud (the mayor) in Broquiès (a commune in the Aveyron department) while we drink his favourite wine, and the day after going to the Élysée to have a chat with [Gaston] Doumergue (the president). In my opinion, a deputy must be the link in the chain that connects the humblest citizens to those in power and to the administrations. It is important to give proper consideration to the interests of common people, while at the same time work on the big issues, on which the fate of France, and even of Europe, depends.27 23 V. A.

Funding for it would come from a portion of the taxes levied on production, the so-called “Laboratory Cent”. During this term, other topics affecting the lives of ordinary people were a source of concern: monetary stability, unemployment, and the high cost of living. He was also aware of the need to prepare the country should the lightning of war strike again; in particular, the recruitment for military service of students from the grandes écoles, a delicate situation of which he had first-hand experience.\n\nSecond term (1928–1932)29 Re-elected, but barely, in April 1928, he joined the group of independent leftists. He continued his efforts in favour of education and culture, and proved particularly innovative on the social domain by proposing a law to ensure effective representation of the “feminine element” in all municipal councils, a project that would only gradually see the light. His sense of precision and concern for rigour prompted him to suggest, as a way of improving and modernising voting procedures in the Chamber, the installation of electrical devices to guarantee the accuracy of vote counting and results.\n\nThird term (1932–1936)30 Once again re-elected by a slim margin, after an epic campaign carried out before difficult and often tumultuous crowds,31 Borel joined the Republican Socialists group.

In 1934, when France was experiencing a very difficult period, Borel might have appeared to support extreme left views while in fact he was only a socialist radical, but devoted to the hierarchy of the grandes écoles despite being a humanist. The terrible February riots and their devastating consequences for the country’s social fabric were at the heart of a persistent economic crisis. Borel was appointed member of the commission of inquiry looking into the origin of those social movements. Having put so much hope on scientific progress as a vehicle for social justice and peace, he realised with dismay the pitiful state of Western Europe and the world.32 True to his beliefs, the events of 1936 – the victory of the Popular Front (an alliance of left-wing movements) and the Socialist leader Léon Blum becoming prime minister – pushed him to resign as deputy and to cut down on his activities. As Camille Marbo relates, 1936 was for Borel a year of reorientation and choices. He complained that “he was too old for taking up tasks imposed to conscientious deputies”.33 He therefore did not seek re-election and supported instead a little-known newcomer to the region,34 who was defeated by the conservative candidate. Borel was confronted with the same problem any scientist embarking on an administrative or political career must face: the difficulty for someone in a “hard” discipline such as mathematics to take on new responsibilities – for instance, director of the Institut Henri Poincaré, which we discuss in the next chapter – while at the same time fulfilling their duties as deputy, both in the field with his constituents and in the Chamber in Paris. For Borel, 1936 was nevertheless a year in which he was honoured by his country: He was appointed Commander of the Legion of Honour (External Affairs), in recognition for his international actions in favour 32 É.

He scored a victory on both fronts, but, faced with new responsibilities combined with his already heavy agenda, the management of his personal time became a real challenge. Borel had to split his time between Paris (at the Sorbonne, the Chamber of Deputies, the Académie des Sciences) and Rouergue (at his deputy and mayoral offices); not to mention his numerous scientific missions abroad and his work for the League of Nations in Geneva. As in the days of the Revue du mois, Marguerite was of invaluable help with administrative and social tasks. Borel was elected mayor in May 1929. Among the main projects completed during his first term were the tarring of roads, the construction of a school for girls, a modern sewage system, and a one-hundred-bed hospital-hospice. The latter, built in an original style inspired by the colonial empire, was named after the mayor: Centre Hospitalier Émile Borel. For those who enjoyed playing boules, a well-established tradition among Saint-Affricans, he had a playing ground built on municipal land. Inaugurated in the summer of 1936, it would be known as Boulodrome Borel.36 In those difficult times of the Third Republic, Borel regularly wrote about national and international politics in the pages of the local newspaper, Le Progrès. In 1933, for instance, he didn’t hesitate, despite his profound desire for peace, to denounce Hitler’s rise to power as a frightening menace, and to warn his fellow countrymen: “In his propaganda, he calls himself national-socialist, seeking an equal balance between 35 J.\n\nM.

On the national front, he has made the most extreme demands, including the abolition of the Treaty of Versailles. On the socialist front, he has made fabulous promises to workers and lower-class employees. The big question will be to what extent he will try, once in power, to honour the promises he made to get there. If he wanted to make good on his national program of a Great Germany, he could only succeed by immediately resorting to war. That is a danger we cannot close our eyes to, and which will require our full vigilance if we are to foil it”.37 Borel’s second term as mayor, from 1935 to the 1939–1940 war years, coincided with one of the most painful political periods, due to the general deterioration of the situation, the so-called “funny war” followed by France’s surrender, and the beginning of the German occupation. Throughout those distressing years, Borel reassured and alerted his fellow citizens on subjects that had become crucial: the organisation and exploitation of statistics as a bookkeeping tool that would allow the country to operate like an enterprise;38 training and professional career counseling for the youth;39 the nee"
