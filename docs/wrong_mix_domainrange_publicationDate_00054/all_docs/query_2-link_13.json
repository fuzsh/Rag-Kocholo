Surprisingly, however, the materials uncovered then and the implications to which I believe they point still remain largely uncommented upon by contemporary interpreters ofJames's life and work. Where these materials are mentioned they seem to me to be interpreted in a different context than the one in which my own reading places them. At that time, the first volumes of James's collected works were just coming out; the project of collecting James's letters was underway, but publishing them had not even begun; the veritable industry that James scholarship has become was just starting; and while many scholars had seen significant portions of the unpublished manuscripts, barely a fraction of these documents had appeared in the published literature. For many of these erstwhile investigators, quite apart from whether or not they really know James, the question of who claims priority for rushing each little tidbit into print has since become a puzzling standard by which reputations are made and by which careers either rise or fall on the academic ladder of success. The truth is, however, that a vast amount of work is still left to be done on William James. In my own work, I have tried to address only a few of the pertinent questions regarding such topics as a detailed chronological sequence of James's life, the personalities of the women who had a significant impact on his work, the root of James's interest in psychical research, his interpretation of the ideas of Emanuel Swedenborg and Ralph Waldo Emerson, the complex relationship that developed between Henry James, Sr., Charles Sanders Peirce, Chauncey Wright, and William James, the vast web of relationships in James's larger family constellation, as well as James's connection to a host of personalities who did not fit into the worldview of his many later commentators. Perhaps these are only a few of the meanings implied in the enigmatic phrase uttered by Ignace Skrupskelis, in all probability the world's preeminent James scholar with regard to the documents, who once said that the definitive James biography would not be written for another forty years. In other words, the most challenging question for THIS BOOK\n\nX\n\nPREFACE\n\nJames scholars, in my opinion, remains: Do we yet have the core of James's vision of reality, from which all the rest of his life and thought radiates? My answer, merely echoing Skrupskelis, is that we have barely begun. The present text is my second attempt to shed a little more light on this question, the first being my reconstruction of James's 1896 unpublished Lowell Lectures on \"Exceptional Mental States,\" which first appeared in 1982 through the good offices of Jacques Barzun at Charles Scribner's Sons. Both works have been created self-consciously using a technique of primary textual analysis borrowed from the field of comparative religions. This technique cleaves so closely to the original documents that it requires additional information be considered only sparingly, and then only when it has a direct bearing on the text. My approach may be disconcerting to some readers because it omits the tremendously large corpus of literature about James that has been generated over the years. Because I have done this deliberately, I offer some further explanation of this method of doing business. I have described the particular school of thought to which this method belongs in \"Contemporary Interest in Classical Eastern Psychology.\"1 This approach was communicated to me over an eight-year period, between 1968 and 1976, by the late Frederick Streng, Professor of Comparative Religions at Southern Methodist University and translator of the Indian Mahayana Buddhist texts of Nagarjuna.2 I then adapted these methods of historical scholarship in comparative religions to archival investigation in the history of American psychology and psychiatry when I first came to Harvard University in 1977 as a Resident Graduate in Applied Theology and the History of Religions.3 I began with a reconstruction of James's Lowell Lectures on \"Exceptional Mental States\"; the same year I first established a stewardship over the papers of Gordon Willard Allport and also began working in certain uncataloged sections of the E. G. Boring Papers that were not readily available to other scholars. The method, in brief, establishes a radical separation between primary and secondary sources—much like what Hindu Sanskrit scholars have called sruti versus smriti—that which is revealed versus that which is remembered. The principal focus then becomes the primary, not the secondary, texts. In this case, the primary texts are what James himself said about a subject. The secondary texts are what the commentators have said about James and his work from his time to the present.4 Primary texts always exist somewhere in the form of an original document or a first edition. One must be concerned with the language in which they were written, meaning not only whether they were in English\n\nPREFACE\n\nXI\n\nor German or Chinese but also the professional language into which they were cast—here, the lexicon of philosophy, psychology, and psychiatry in the late nineteenth century. Texts are always further situated in a particular historical time period; they belong to a particular school of thought, there are lines of influence to which the texts themselves point, and there are always particular factors surrounding their construction, including the motives and personality of the author. To allow the texts to speak for themselves is to reconstruct them in their original context, wherever possible, without the mediating influence of interpreters who have not engaged in a similar reconstruction. The reader will further find that the method is existential, but in a uniquely American vein; phenomenological, but without being related to the Husserlian school of phenomenology; and hermeneutic, but without reference to the present hermeneutic movement in textual analysis, to which I do not subscribe. Further, it is philosophical, but does not situate James in the Western analytic tradition; rather, it places him, more accurately in my estimation, in the context of a uniquely American interpretation of pragmatism. Pragmatism, the first uniquely American philosophy to have international consequences, was, in James's hand, more a direct outgrowth of Emersonian transcendentalism and the Swedenborgian thought of Henry James, Sr., as well as a retailed version of the philosophies of Charles Sanders Peirce and Chauncey Wright, than it was a capstone to the British empiricists or in any way more closely related to the continental philosophers. And while my method has been most heavily informed by the University of Chicago tradition of textual analysis in comparative religions, it has been further modified in its adaptation to the historical literature of psychology and psychiatry by the influence on my own thinking of Buddhist epistemology and James's radical empiricism.5 In this adaptation the method is exegetical; that is, it is freely applied to contemporary circumstances wherever possible. It also serves a soteriologic function— namely, it presumes that historical scholarship has applications to the process of personality transformation where questions about the nature of ultimate reality are concerned. The initial premise of the present work is quite straightforward, namely, that William James is typically thought to have abandoned psychology after publication of his Principles of Psychology in 1890. The text suggests, instead, that all of James's work after 1890 was, in fact, informed by his interest in psychology, but that his attention was directed toward studying \"the rise and fall of the threshold of consciousness\" and other phenomena related to abnormal and personality psychology, rather than toward the kind of sterile academic laboratory psychology\n\nxii\n\nPREFACE\n\nthat was becoming increasingly dominant in the United States at the time. Based upon what he believed was credible scientific evidence, James abandoned the positivist viewpoint he had taken in The Principles and fashioned, instead, his metaphysics of radical empiricism, which, I will claim, he meant specifically to be directed toward psychologists in the renovation of their own science. This change was to have important consequences for James's own career as he busied himself with widening the scope of psychology just when it was being narrowed by the newly arrived laboratory experimentalists fresh from the German universities. But James held his ground, and for this reason it is understood by historians of the discipline such as Kurt Danziger that psychology in the late nineteenth century had two popes—James in America and Wundt in Leipzig. In my opinion, these two thinkers represent two radically different traditions which exist to this day and are often confused. To assuage the misgivings of those who believe that the commentarial literature must come first, I have added an annotated bibliography at the end, in which I have tried to review what at least some James scholars have said about James and his psychology after 1890. The context in which this psychology needs to be placed, as I see it, is not the Wundtian laboratory tradition, nor is it Freudian psychoanalysis, but rather an international consortium of psychologists, psychiatrists, physicians, psychotherapists, and philosophers loosely organized into what I have since called the French-Swiss-English-and-American psychotherapeutic alliance. I am not the only one to hold this view, as it is also entertained to one degree or another by a small but growing band of scholars. The work of these scholars, taken collectively, suggests that this alliance played an important role in the development of subsequent trends in personality, abnormal, social, and clinical psychology in the United States in the early twentieth century; their work contributes to further understanding the origins of the split between experimental and clinical psychology, which continues to this day; their studies may even throw new light on the relevance of a flourishing medical psychology one hundred years ago to present problems in the neuroscience revolution. Further, the work of these scholars suggests to me the outline of an alternative history to American psychology than the one promulgated by E. G. Boring and largely reiterated by most historians of the discipline after him. This newer history is uniquely Jamesean and not Wundtian and has always represented the experience of most psychologists in the United States. A major line of this uniquely American Jamesean tradition influenced the personality-social psychologists of the 1930s and 1940s and the humanistic psychologists who followed them into the 1960s, separate from the psychophysical tradition of the Germans and\n\nPREFACE\n\nxiii\n\nthe behaviorism of Pavlov, Watson, Hull, and Skinner, and quite apart from psychoanalysis, although this Jamesean lineage helped in many important ways to Americanize Freud's ideas. Referring to this uniquely American Jamesean tradition, in my title I have self-consciously linked James with the idea of psychology as a person-centered science, a phrase which I have freely appropriated from the writings of Gordon Allport and Carl Rogers.

Murray, who, in the years that I was privileged to know him, was for me \"like the shadow of a rock to a stranger in a weary land,\" and who, as Gordon Allport once remarked, was more like William James than any other psychologist at Harvard.\n\nWilliam James on Consciousness beyond the Margin\n\nChapter One AN OUTLINE OF THE PROBLEM\n\nwhether loved or reviled, looms large in the history of American psychology. He was the first to wrest control of psychology from the abstract philosophers by adapting study of mental functioning to the methods of physiology. He was the first to take up the scientific study of consciousness within the context of the new evolutionary biology. He was the first to teach the new scientific psychology in the United States in 1875; the first to open a laboratory for student instruction that same year; the first to grant a Ph.D. in the new discipline, to G. Stanley Hall, in 1878; and the first American to write a world-famous textbook, The Principles of Psychology (1890), from the positivist point of view. Moreover, a list of his many beloved students reads like a Who's Who of the discipline. As teacher, colleague, and friend, he touched the lives of James Rowland Angell, Gertrude Stein, Robert Yerkes, E. L. Thorndike, Walter Cannon, William Healy, Robert Woodworth, Boris Sidis, L. Eugene Emerson, Mary Calkins, E. B. Holt, and more. But he fell out with the Social Darwinists when he championed the importance of the individual over the survival of the species. He scandalized the philosophers and the scientists with his theory that emotions do not follow cognitions, but rather are the complex of our immediate physiological perceptions. He offended the medical establishment by his eloquent and successful defense of the mental healers, and he appeared to abandon psychology altogether after 1890 when his experimentalist detractors said that professionally he had fled into philosophy and personally he had become lost in the occult. The truth of the matter is, however, that, far from abandoning psychology, James was paying close attention to then recent advances in experimental psychopathology, a new field which historians have shown developed out of psychical research and the French experimental psychology of the subconscious, and in both lines James himself was a pioneer.' Experimental evidence for the pathology of the emotions and for the reality of multiple subconscious states caused James to reevaluate the antimetaphysical position he had taken in The Principles. This led him to his metaphysics of radical empiricism and to a sophisticated critique of experimentalism in scientific psychology after 1890.2 Psychologists first heard of radical empiricism, although as yet unnamed, when James delivered his presidential address to the American WILLIAM JAMES,\n\n4\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nPsychological Association in 1894. There James asserted that any legitimate scientific psychology must contend with the fact that no scientific system can ever be free of metaphysics. In James's case this meant that laboratory investigation, which was defined by strict materialism and positivist epistemology, could not possibly establish itself as the only legitimate form of knowledge-getting in psychology simply by asserting that it was antimetaphysical. James's analysis showed that positivistic reductionism was, rather, based on a metaphysics of physicalism. James was willing to concede that, by confining attention only to models of the external world, replicable effects were produced that approximated normal interaction between the organism and the environment. Such modeling, however, could not possibly apply to an understanding of the internal phenomenological life of the person, to beliefs, attitudes, values, or to the phenomena of changing states of consciousness. Experimentalism, radical materialism, or reductionistic positivism, as he came to call it, could never lead to an understanding of the whole person. Instead of ignoring the individuality of the subject by focusing exclusively on normative scientific data, he believed that the core of the discipline should be a scientific study of consciousness, by which he meant experience in all its forms and manifestations. To James this meant, among other things, that psychologists should take an in-depth look at the phenomenology of the science-making process. It also meant that if positivism was itself based on an implied metaphysics, then other philosophical systems could also plausibly govern scientific psychology. James envisioned his metaphysics of radical empiricism as serving such a function, which he developed as an epistemology, in turn, to justify his pioneering work in abnormal psychology, psychical research, and the psychology of religion, particularly between 1890 and 1902. But the experimentalists ignored him as a psychologist after the publication of his Principles in 1890. They criticized him in print for his support of the mental healers; they accused him of making a full flight into theology; and they absolutely denied any philosophical bias to their own definition of science. Eulogized in public for fathering the New American Psychology, but castigated in private by the laboratory types as irrelevant, when he died in 1910 it was nevertheless generally recognized by psychologists the world over that a major figure had passed from the scene. But did James really abandon psychology after 1890? After all, this is the contention of almost all modern psychology textbooks that mention him in any detail; it is the prevailing opinion aired by the most noted historians of the discipline; and it was a view widely held by James's own contemporaries who played a major role in the development of modern psychology as an experimental, laboratory-based enterprise.3\n\nAN OUTLINE OF THE PROBLEM\n\n5\n\nMy answer to the question, on the other hand, shall be a resounding \"no!\" In fact, as I read the evidence, James abandoned only the reigning positivist epistemology of the era. His own scientific sensibilities had been fostered under the local Harvard influences of such men as Charles Peirce, the mathematical logician and interpreter of Kant whofirstintroduced James to the German psychophysicists; and Chauncey Wright, who had been an avid follower of the works of Comte and Mill before turning to Darwin. James had then gone on to fight his own pitched battles against the scientific pretensions of Herbert Spencer and the Social Darwinists and the political motives of medical scientists trying to infuse all of culture with reductionism. All this prepared him for the positivism of Mach and Avenarius, and for the German experimental laboratory tradition that soon came to dominate the new scientific psychology by the end of the nineteenth century. By the 1890s, the German ideal of science, with its emphasis on determinism, materialism, and reductionism, began to gain prominence in American universities. James thought that it had created a barren brass instrument psychology, too much artificial busywork in the laboratory, and a glut of measurements carried to three decimal places, which, in the end, the experimentalists themselves admitted had no meaning except to justify their new love affair with precision. Growing more and more devoid of concrete references to human experience, psychology, according to William James, was in danger of degenerating into mere experimentalism. James preferred instead to redefine psychology anew in terms of an evolving person-centered discipline, in vital touch as much with philosophy and the humanities as with physics and the natural sciences. At the center of this new psychology, at first only glimpsed in numerous eleventh-hour footnotes and newly written passages in his Principles ofPsychology, was a dynamic conception of personality and consciousness, which, for the first time in his thinking, gave formal recognition to the impact of personal metaphysics in the collective enterprise of psychology as a science. His new position acknowledged the reality of consciousness as an ultimate plurality of states; it shed significant light on then current scientific studies of personality disintegration; it admitted the iconography of the transcendent as a crucial determinant of personality transformation; and it provided James with an analytic tool powerful enough to critique the unexamined assumptions of radical materialism in experimental science. To understand his change from positivism to radical emipiricism is to throw new light on a variety of problems James took up, from experimental psychopathology, psychical research, the social psychology of crowds, the psychology of painting, our understanding of creative genius, and the psychology of education, to the experience of transcen-\n\n6\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\ndence in religious awakening. Indeed, his psychological investigations during this pivotal phase of his career, particularly between 1890 and 1902, I shall maintain, significantly informed the development of his technical philosophy, which in turn he used to justify the possibility of a scientific psychology centered on the person rather than the laboratory. WHAT WE KNOW OF JAMES'S PSYCHOLOGY AFTER 1890\n\nWhile it is true that James's contributions to psychology after 1890 continue to be largely overlooked or misinterpreted, there is a handful of scholars who have considered James's activities as a psychologist during this era. Dorothy Ross has alluded to this period in her review of G. Stanley Hall's relation to James, but she gives greater stress to Hall's point of view.4 Otto Marx reviewed the neurological and psychiatric journals during this time and concluded that James made no contribution to the literature.5 Archie Baum, as well as Gardner Murphy and Robert O. Ballou, have written in defense ofJames's studies of psychic phenomena, but deal only with James's published materials, and they cast their interpretation against the implicit backdrop of twentieth-century definitions of parapsychology and not the nineteenth-century context of psychical research.6 Grace Foster has given one of the most thorough analyses of James's personal and professional involvement in psychotherapy during this period, while H. D. Spoerl has reviewed with much accurate detail James's contribution to abnormal and social psychology.' Both these authors made their ideas known only in brief articles read by limited audiences, and they did not fully draw out the implications of James's psychology after 1890 for later developments, either in James's thinking or in the field of psychology at large.8 Within the history of medicine, Henry Ellenberger, Nathan G. Hale, and John Burnham have mentioned James's contribution to the rise of American psychotherapy in the late nineteenth century, but only as a prelude to the coming of Freud.9 While they have broached James's influence on the so-called Boston School of Abnormal Psychology and pointed to his association with such lights as Morton Prince, Boris Sidis, James Jackson Putnam, and Josiah Royce, only when taken collectively does their work suggest that James played an important role in the development of a uniquely American psychology of the subconscious, now largely forgotten because it was later inundated by the flood of Freudian psychoanalysis and then politically torpedoed by the prophets of behaviorism. Norman Cameron has given a summary of James's contribution to the American reception of psychoanalysis, seconded by Barbara Ross.10 Saul Rosenzweig in 1959 has suggested that Freud might even have been influenced by James's stream of consciousness technique, par-\n\nAN OUTLINE OF THE PROBLEM\n\n7\n\nticularly as it derived from the method of automatic speaking, writing, and drawing described by James John Garth Wilkinson, a translator of Swedenborg, pastoral psychiatrist to the James family, and older colleague of William James in the field of abnormal psychology.11 Despite this wealth of information, historians of psychology and psychiatry continue to suggest that James was more of a philosopher than a psychologist; that his efforts in the field of psychical research were somehow not scientifically legitimate; that his dabbling in the unconscious was merely a naive precursor to Freud; and that after The Principles of Psychology in 1890 James was not involved in anything that could be called psychology by his more experimentally oriented colleagues. Thus, a work such as The Varieties of Religious Experience (1902) represents to\n\nJames's most reductionistic scientific detractors a full flight into theology, even though James himself claimed that in examining religious consciousness he spoke from the standpoint of a psychologist. Clearly, to stretch a point to its limit, most experimental psychologists do not read James after 1890, if they read him at all, while theologians, ministers, and psychologists of religion tend to ignore him before Varieties of Religious Experience.\n\nWhile James scholars generally have managed to avoid most of these problems, three tendencies are nevertheless clear: (1) James is often interpreted out of context according to an author's own more modern and oftentimes less eclectic frame of reference. James's name is then invoked as anticipating some exclusive future trend; hence, when writing about the Jamesean influence in psychology, we have James the pioneer psychoanalyst, James the pioneer behaviorist, or James the pioneer phenomenologist, all simultaneously claimed by adherents among the rival schools. (2) Most James scholars rely primarily on James's published works, on only the most accessible letters, or on only a limited reading of the vast collection on deposit at the Houghton Library at Harvard. And (3), only in certain instances has Ralph Barton Perry's initial interpretation of James and his psychology been questioned or revised. Despite Perry's eminent status as a philosopher in his own right, and despite the circumstances that he was first a student and later friend and designated biographer—and that he deserved the Pulitzer Prize he won for his life of James—he was still highly selective about what he emphasized in James's writings. Perry, ultimately a Western philosopher in the American academic tradition, tended to gloss over James's activities in psychical research, his psychology of the subconscious, the Asian influences, and the impact of the New England Mind-Cure Movement on James's thinking as a psychologist}2 Indeed, I shall maintain that even in his most positivistic phases, William James espoused a psychology which I would characterize as a\n\n8\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nperson-centered science. True, he was a man of many moods and mirrors. He appeared to change his mind on an issue many times and indeed at one point said that he really didn't mind contradicting himself. But there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the general orientation toward a person-centered science was present in his work when he first entered the field of psychology in the 1870s. He may have waxed hot and cold during different decades over it as a primary focus, yet it remained hovering in the background even in his most reductionistic pronouncements. Despite his antimetaphysical claims, his Principles is suffused with this person-centered orientation, and it comes out most cogently in the period between 1890 and 1902, when he became intensely involved in problems of experimental psychopathology, psychical research, and the psychology of religion. As I shall also attempt to indicate, the influence of James's psychology during this period was extensive, not only in relation to the subsequent content areas and methodologies inherent in the numerous subdisciplines he covered, but also because his views on the implicit metaphysical assumptions even of the most rabid positivist epistemology continue to cast important light on the present state and future prospects of psychology. This thesis I shall defend in five stages. First, I would like to establish that from its very inception, James's psychology, while it focused on the scientific study of consciousness, remained person-centered. Second, while James self-consciously established a positivist epistemology in his Principles of Psychology, even there he injected important psychological material that had clear metaphysical implications for his later philosophical critique of science. Third, using archival manuscripts as well as his published works, I would like to ask, \"Just what were James's activities as a psychologist after 1890, and particularly before 1902?\" and to answer by showing that his endeavors demonstrate the foundation upon which he believed a person-centered science could be built. Fourth, I would like to examine the opposition that developed in America to James's program for psychology, chiefly among a coterie of Wundt's American students who wished to displace James's influence with the rhetoric and methods of the German experimental laboratory tradition. Fifth, I intend to enunciate the grounds upon which James repudiated the positivist epistemology of these German-trained students, claiming their agenda to be an ill-conceived basis for constructing a scientific psychology. In stating my conclusions, I would like to highlight what I understand to have been James's final message to psychologists about some potential future trends in the discipline.\n\nChapter Two CONSCIOUSNESS: THE FOCUS OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY AT HARVARD BEFORE 1890\n\nG. BORING wrote his monumental History of Experimental Psychology (1929), which became required reading for almost all graduates in psychology for nearly fifty years, he already had a prearranged agenda. His aim, indeed his lifework, was to develop, largely by editorial fiat, the German experimental laboratory tradition of his mentor, E. B. Titchener, and especially the subfield of psychophysics as it had developed in the tradition of Helmholtz, Fechner, and Wundt, into what was thought of as the only legitimate standard upon which to base a science of psychology. Boring knew that he was omitting tests and measurements, developmental perspectives, and dynamic psychotherapy from his book. He even said privately that he hoped someday to do a history of those areas as well. But he publicly created the impression anyway that German experimental laboratory psychophysics was the only legitimate standard in the history of Western science, in the history of American psychology, and in the history of psychology at Harvard.1 The birth of this movement he fixed as 1879, when Wilhelm Wundt first opened his experimental laboratory in Leipzig, which Boring declared to be the first real laborarotory of experimental psychology to be founded in the world. Boring did not make this claim of priorities until the second edition of his History, which appeared in 1950, however. In the first edition of his work, he was satisfied to give James due credit for his early laboratory, which James had maintained as early as 1875. But in the ensuing years between 1929 and 1950, the dates of Boring's two editions, the personality-social psychologists in the Jamesean tradition at Harvard—Allport, Murray, and others—had risen up and Boring was carrying on an ideological battle against them. In this context, using the way he wrote history as a weapon, Boring separated the experimentalists at Harvard from direct links with James, associated them, instead, with Wundt, and then proceeded to subsume James under the experimental tradition as a precursor.2 To make this claim, Boring had to remake William James over into a follower of the right kind of European science.3 He accomplished this by WHEN EDWIN\n\n10\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nfirst overemphasizing James's few weeks in 1867 as a student and auditor of Helmholtz and Wundt. He followed by cleverly outlining James's role as an empirical psychologist with a philosophical bent, but then discounted James as a serious scientist because he hated laboratory work (what James really hated, of course, was German experimental laboratory work). Boring finally dressed out the lines of the desired picture by arguing that if James was not a serious experimentalist, therefore his early laboratory of 1875 was not a real one. Boring's chief vehicle, and the denouement of his story, was to establish in the minds of succeeding generations the fiction that modern psychology really began with the founding of Wundt's laboratory in Leipzig in 1879.4 This assertion, however, does not explain why, in the closing decades of the nineteenth century, and at least to 1910, two popes reigned in scientific psychology, James in America and Wundt in Germany. It does not explain why experimental psychology was equated with psychical research in the minds of the American public between 1880 and 1910. It does not explain how France, America, Switzerland, and Italy differentially interpreted the new science into their own indigenous expressions. It does not even admit the history of dynamic unconscious processes. And it does not help us to see the quite separate origins of personality, abnormal, social, and clinical psychology. Nor does Boring's account help us to explain, except by its omissions, the current internecine war between academic researchers and clinical psychologists, which I believe has roots reaching back to James's time.5 I cannot hope in the present work to thoroughly examine all these issues. However, I would like to focus on one important aspect of their history by developing the thesis that a conceptual fusion of experimental psychology and the scientific study of psychic phenomena in the United States in the closing decades of the nineteenth century led to major developments in the understanding of consciousness and, hence, to the evolution of scientific psychotherapy by the 1890s. To do this, I would like to present evidence that reveals how experimental psychology at Harvard in the hands of William James between 1872 and 1890 was informed by early studies in experimental neuropathology, physiological psychology, and psychical research, which, in turn, significantly contributed to the development of the new field of experimental psychopathology. EVOLUTION AND CONSCIOUSNESS: JAMES'S 1865 REVIEWS\n\nThe first piece of evidence comes from James's earliest-known statements on the efficacy of consciousness in the context of the biological evolution of humans.\n\nCONSCIOUSNESS\n\n11\n\nSome years before details were formally published, scholars working in James's unpublished manuscript collection at Harvard University were aware of two unsigned articles authored by James that originally appeared in the North American Review in 1865 on the subject of Darwin's theory of natural selection.6 The first was a review of Thomas H. Huxley's\n\nLectures on the Elements of Comparative Anatomy: On the Classification of Animals, and on the Vertebrate Skull, while the second was a review of Alfred R. Wallace's The Origin of Human Races and the Antiquity of Man Deduced from the Theory of 'Natural Selection'? These items have been of\n\nsome interest, not only because they linked James with Darwin's ideas at the height of the controversy over the theory of natural selection, but also because they are the earliest-known pieces that James ever published and hence alter significantly the accepted annotated bibliographies of James's writings upon which all biographical statements about the genesis of his writing career are based. Since I have analyzed the content of these reviews elsewhere, I will confine myself to making only a few of their most salient points.8 In the first article, James labeled Huxley a left-wing extremist because in his writings all thought about anything was always reduced to a radical materialism. But Huxley's work was important, James said, because it supported Darwin's theory of natural selection, which was just then being taken up by so many other reputable scientists. The bulk of the article was concerned with Huxley's arguments for the theory that the skull was an evolutionary extension of the vertebral column, which James elaborated upon. In the second article, we have a much more developed text on the theory of natural selection in which James took full opportunity to explicate, emphasizing the role of conscious choice. The question that Wallace addressed and James commented upon was why, if the creationists were wrong in believing that God created all species in their present form all at once a long time ago, do the sources of variation that one would expect to see throughout nature appear to be absent in man? The answer proposed was that they are not absent, but have been considerably slowed. This has occurred because in the course of the social evolution of the species human beings have made the decision to band together and protect the most gifted as well as the most unfortunate, especially those who would not normally survive on their own. This has changed the rate at which variation by selection is introduced into the species by significantly slowing down the selection of those unfit to continue biologically because they are being preserved for social or moral reasons. In addition, variation in the species was being further slowed because man has the ability to introduce alterations into the physical environment that far surpass any other species, thus forcing the environ-\n\n12\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nment to adapt to human needs, instead of the other way around. These arguments gave James a chance to develop the thought that social organization and intellectual superiority must therefore also be deciding elements in evolutionary survival, especially in humans. Consciousness, consequently, becomes an efficacious force in the biological evolution of the species. I would say that these articles are important for three reasons. First, while other Darwinians in the 1860s were busy talking biology and the development of plants and animals, the articles show where James first staked out the problem of consciouness as his contribution to the larger discussion. He continued to develop his answers most directly against the Social Darwinists in essays such as \"Great Men, Great Thoughts and Their Environment\" and \"The Importance of Individuals,\" where he argued for the evolutionary importance of individual differences and defined the principles of variation and selection that are always active in consciousness. In these texts, James maintained the position, still lost on evolutionary psychologists who remain focused on the superiority of rationality, that creative brainstorming was just as important as decision making because the widest possible number of choices allowed for the most adaptive product to be selected. The content of these essays for what they say about consciousness remains quite overlooked, however. Instead, James remains best remembered for his discussion of instinct, habit, perception, and other evolutionary topics related to the problem of consciousness which he posed in The Principles. Second, the 1865 articles are also important because they reflect the influence of C. S. Peirce and Chauncey Wright on James's views.9 At Darwin's behest, Wright had written \"The Evolution of Self-Consciousness\" in an attempt to identify how natural selection works in the development of language.10 Peirce, ever the consummate scientist and logician, remained skeptical of the evolutionary hypothesis, signing neither on nor off, a fact which William, struggling with his own conception of an open universe even then, must have duly noted. Meanwhile, the Peircean influence on James's conception of pragmatism, and hence evolutionary functionalism, and on James's early conception of psychology have been well documented.11 Subsequently, we find the influence of Peirce and Wright in James's formulations on consciousness, on evolution, on psychophysics, and on the philosophy of science. In fact, we see James's efforts to retail their work to psychologists and philosophers throughout the rest of his career. Third, the 1865 articles are important for the light they shed on the deeper connections to Henry James, Sr., and Emerson and to the as yet unacknowledged debt of Swedenborgian and transcendentalist thought\n\nCONSCIOUSNESS 12\n\n13\n\nto the evolution of American pragmatism. As a case in point, James's connections to Charles Eliot Norton, the editor of the North American Review, came through Henry James, Sr., Emerson, and the Saturday Club. These were, in fact, the same lines that William used to enter Agassiz's Lawrence Scientific School when he first came to Harvard in 1861, although he promptly sided with Agassiz's enemies, the Darwinists such as Asa Gray, Chauncey Wright, and Charles William Eliot, on the evolutionary question. If we look more closely into the complex of relationships among these figures during this seminal period, I believe the following explanation suggests itself: When young William, the aspiring artist, abandoned the palate and brush for the Lawrence Scientific School in 1861, he was actually fulfilling a mandate as heir to the Swedenborgian and transcendentalist literary psychology of Emerson and Henry James, Sr. This was essentially a spiritual psychology of character formation which William was silently charged with carrying on and which, in the more empirical and reductionistic age in which he found himself, William transmuted into a science of consciousness and a psychology of individual differences. These events exacerbated a deep personal conflict that led James to both a crisis and recovery, but the route he took was rather circuitous. In conflict over the suffocating influence of his father's religious metaphysics, largely through the influence of Peirce during the 1860s, William fled into the ultrapositivistic and scientific philosophy of Chauncey Wright. Peirce, meanwhile, was adopted by Henry James, Sr., into the James family as something of a spiritual son. As such, after long conversations with the senior James while William was in Brazil, Peirce converted to his idiosyncratic brand of Swedenborgianism. From there, Swedenborg's Doctrine of Use and his conception of rationality became one influence, still unaccounted for, on Peirce's later formulation of the pragmatic maxim. For his part, by fleeing into science William successfully separated himself from continuous fusion with his father's ideas, content now to derive them indirectly through Peirce. But William could not long abide with the antiphilosophical and antireligious stance that Wright's brand of positivism represented, and William's attempt to do so literally drove him nearly to suicide by 1870. He recovered by reading Wordsworth and Renouvier and by believing to believe in free will, thus now distancing himself enough from both Henry James, Sr., and Wright, to be able to use them in his new and evolving worldview, but without the old emotional restraints. Mental science and the study of consciousness was to become his forte, and he got his first chance to teach these subjects through his old chemistry teacher, Charles William Eliot, by then presi-\n\n14\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\ndent of Harvard, who hired William in 1872 to teach anatomy and physiology. Physiological psychology, the first course so-called to be taught in an American university, was only two years away, and from there James's vocational course was set. JAMES'S\n\n1867-1868 MEDICAL SCHOOL NOTEBOOK\n\nThe second piece of evidence that helps define the origin of experimental psychology at Harvard is William James's medical school notebook, which dates from the late fall of 1866 or early 1867.13 The notebook is particularly important for the glimpse it gives into the state of medical school training at the time. There are notes on muscle and cell physiology and the differential effects of chemicals on living tissue. References are made to the works of Huxley, Busk, and particularly Carpenter, and chemical notations appear throughout. The most interesting feature of the notes is the level of discourse, in that they convey extensive correlation of mental symptoms with physical pathology in diseases of the nervous system. In terms of the clinical picture of disease, no attempt was made to reduce consciousness strictly to the language of physiology. Rather, the signs and symptoms of the patient's mental state were presented as equally important to a description of the accompanying organic picture. Most important, a large part of this notebook contains details of neuropathological lectures given at Harvard by Charles Edouard Brown-Sequard. Herein, I believe, lies one of the chief sources for William James's concept of the experimental method. Brown-Sequard was Harvard's first professor of neurology. He had an important influence on Henry Pickering Bowditch, James Jackson Putnam, and William James as young medical students, and all three came to know him in the late 1860s. Brown-Sequard was an English subject from the island of Mauritius, whose bloodline was French and Irish American. He had received his medical training in Paris and distinguished himself for his experimental laboratory research on the nervous system and the endocrine glands before he came to America. When he became professor of neurology at the Harvard Medical School in 1864, he brought with him the latest techniques of experimental medicine, which applied laboratory research to the understanding of clinical problems important to the practicing physician. His appointment was an attempt to expose medical students to the \"new physiology,\" that is, the experimental (meaning surgical) demonstration of the relation of structure to function. This was the French scientific tradition of Xavier Bichat, Francois Magendie, and Claude Bernard. In this vein, while dissection on nonliving organisms had long been a standard procedure, Brown-Sequard was in fact the first to introduce vivisection into the med-\n\nCONSCIOUSNESS\n\n15 14\n\nical curriculum as an experimental technique. James, Bowditch, Putnam, and others were the first students at Harvard to be exposed to this procedure on living organisms, which was soon to form such a vital part of the biological sciences. One should not underestimate, in this regard, the effect that French experimental physiology had on William James's subsequent definition of scientific psychology. In Germany, experimental laboratory research became the ideal pursued in the universities, and pure science was seen as the father of clinical application. But in France, the ideal of la clinique, bedside teaching and the care of the patient, had held sway. Since the French Revolution, because medical schools had been founded around the Paris teaching hospitals, la clinique had been the focus, while scientific research, especially experimental physiology, grew up as its handmaiden. Hence, the experimental tradition in France had to fight for its own independent recognition in a way that was unthinkable for the pure laboratory sciences in Germany.15 In the early part of the nineteenth century, American physicians flocked to Paris to study at the patient's bedside and to tour the wards with greats such as Corvisart, Louis, Laennec, and Bouillar. Professors on the faculty at Harvard Medical School, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., and Jeffries Wyman, two of James's mentors, drew their inspiration from French clinical medicine at a time when other medical institutions looked to Germany, Edinburgh, Leyden, or England. The pervasive influence of the French clinical tradition at Harvard was to continue until well into the late nineteenth century.16 Because of this clinical emphasis on the soon-to-emerge laboratory sciences of physiology, neurology, and psychology, the French experimental tradition was also to have a significant later influence on the development of experimental psychopathology and scientific psychotherapy in Boston in a way that the ideal of German science never had. Parenthetically, I want to add two small details about James's notebook before proceeding further. First, inserted in the flyleaf is a notation in an unidentified hand, probably Mrs. Bailey Aldrich, referring to Ralph Barton Perry, James's biographer. The notation says that Perry did not want the notebook to be a part of the William James Collection at Harvard College, ostensibly because it was \"medical\" and not \"philosophical.\" Here again is a small but clear-cut example where Perry exercised his selective influence on the history of James scholarship. Second, inserted in the notebook is a letter, dated July 22, 1942, from Edwin G. Boring, the historian of experimental psychology at Harvard, to Charles Burwell, dean of the Medical School. In this letter Boring offers to give the notebook to the Medical School archives. Boring had intended to include it as part of a centenary James exhibit at the Ameri-\n\n16\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\ncan Psychological Association meeting that year, but the meeting was canceled because of the war. With a background limited to psychophysics and engineering, Boring was unable to draw any inferences relevant to James's scientific training. He wrote: \"I have gone through the notebook but do not find anything of great interest in it.\" By seeing the notebook as a precursor to physiological psychology, however, we gain some important clues to a direction in James's development that Boring did not fathom. JAMES'S LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS\n\nThe third cache of evidence is actually a collection of two groups of experimental studies that James had undertaken between 1874 and 1889. The first group is indicated by two references that describe James's involvement in laboratory-oriented neurophysiology in the early 1870s, while the second is made up of what James thought of as his main contributions to experimental psychology proper. To understand the significance of James's laboratory investigations, one should know that the physiology laboratory at Harvard Medical School, which at the time was just across the street from the Massachusetts General Hospital, had been established by Henry Pickering Bowditch as the first experimental facility in the United States for studying problems of clinical physiology. This laboratory was also the site of early collaborative experiments between Bowditch, James, Putnam, and, a few years later, G. Stanley Hall. Second, one should know that, while Bowditch had studied briefly in Paris under Bernard, Brown-Sequard, and Charcot, he was preeminently identified with Carl Ludwig in Vienna; Putnam had been a postdoctoral student under Meynert and Benedict in Leipzig. Meanwhile, in this triumvirate, James, although he remained strongly influenced by French experimental and clinical medicine, became the philosophical champion of the group because of his involvements with Peirce and Wright and the orientation toward the mind-body problem that later came to be known as American functionalism. During the early 1870s in Bowditch's lab, James, with Putnam and Bowditch, undertook the reproduction of Meynert's experiments on cerebral localization. One of these studies, led by James Jackson Putnam with the assistance of James and Bowditch, was published in January 1874 under the title \"Contributions to the Physiology of the Cortex Cerebrii.\"17 The problem under investigation involved a much discussed topic in the scientific literature at the time on localization of brain function. Specific centers of the brain in live animals had been surgically exposed and then electrically stimulated, and entire maps had been drawn showing the relation of specific brain sites to bodily\n\nCONSCIOUSNESS\n\n17\n\nfunctions. The primary criticism of such endeavors was methodological, in that one could not definitely tell whether the superficial stimulation of surface tissue in the cortex was activating more deeply embedded brain centers. Putnam, James, and Bowditch devised a unique approach to answer this question. Etherized dogs had a portion of their skulls surgically removed and a partial incision was then made around the area of the cortex to be tested, creating a flap of tissue which prevented electrical stimulation from penetrating more deeply into the brain at that site. Stimulation of the surface confirmed the recognized specificity of function, thus answering the questions of the critics. An account of these Harvard activities soon appeared in the pages of the New York Medical Record as part of the program of the New York Society for Neurology and Electrology.18 At the stated meeting on January 18, 1875, with Dr. Meredith Clymer in the chair, a paper \"On Experimental Researches of the Motorial Functions of the Cerebral Convolutions\" was discussed. Its content described Hitzig's experiments on stimulation of specific brain centers, which had produced consistent flexion and extension of the limb in five animals. James Jackson Putnam and George Miller Beard, both pioneers in the founding of American neurology, were present, along with a number of others. Putnam, by invitation of the president, was part of the program and described the aforementioned experiments, performed by himself with William James assisting. They had attempted to test, Putnam said, the degree to which feeble induction currents applied to the cerebral cortex, after the manner of Hitzig and Ferrier, acted on parts lying beneath the surface. Putnam then proceeded to explain other experiments that William James had been doing in which Putnam had acted as assistant. Their point was to determine whether excitation of the cortex of the cervical lobes would cause a rise of blood pressure, such as had been known to follow excitation of peripheral nerves. Putnam reported that the changes in blood pressure were recorded upon a revolving cylinder through a manometer attached to some large artery. The results so far had been inconsistent, but the experiments were still in progress. In fact, they were never reported, but their role in the development of James's theory of the emotions ten years later seems quite likely. C. K. Mills, in his historical sketch of advances in American neurology in the 1870s, referred to Putnam, Bowditch and James's experiments with faradic currents on the cerebral cortex and subcortex. 19 Ellis, a student of Bowditch's in the 1880s, recalled decades later with some reverence the importance attached to the early collaboration of these experimenters. And Cannon in the 1930s echoed this same theme as a major first step in the development of physiology at Harvard. 20\n\n18\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nTheir significance in the present context is that Bowditch's facilities became the prototype for Putnam to develop a laboratory in neuropathology at Harvard Medical School and for James to develop the laboratory of experimental psychology in Harvard College. Their collaboration also marked the kind of mutual interaction the three would continue to have throughout their respective careers in physiology, neurology, and psychology. As a result, the history of these laboratory sciences became bound up together at Harvard. Mind-body issues around the experimental study of consciousness would come to have an important role in the evolution of the social and medical sciences, and an important era of psychological medicine in general practice would soon result. Once his own laboratory activities got underway in 1875, James produced several studies which, in a letter to James McKeen Cattell, he labeled his only \"scientific papers.\"21 The first such study, published in The American Journal of Otology (1882), had been undertaken as part of James's interest in the perception of space and the feeling of effort. It was an empirical verification for the hypothesis that deaf-mutes were immune to the feeling of dizziness.22 To test this notion, James devised an apparatus for whirling each subject around rapidly.23 An experimental group of 519 deaf-mutes drawn from various institutions was compared with a control group of nearly 200 normal subjects who were students and instructors at Harvard College. Of the deaf-mutes, 186 were totally insusceptible to being made dizzy, 134 were made dizzy to a slight degree, while 199 became dizzy as expected of normals. In the control group of 200, only one remained exempt from vertigo. From this James concluded that, along with the semicircular canals, hearing was also implicated in balance.24 James's second study, published in the Proceedings of the American Society for Psychical Research, was a replication of an experiment previously conducted by G. Stanley Hall in Bowditch's laboratory. The topic of the investigation was reaction time under hypnosis.25 In the early 1880s, before going to Hopkins and while still in Boston, Hall had subjected \"a traveling mesmerist's histrionic assistant\" to a series of trials to determine the effect of trance on speed of reaction time, based on some observations of Wundt.26 James tested the same theory by collecting data from 806 trials on three different subjects, all Harvard seniors, using reaction-time equipment and a Baltzar's kymograph. Hall had proclaimed that his data showed unequivocally that reaction time was faster during trance than when the subject was measured both before and after. By a comparison of simple mathematical averages, James showed, however, that in his subjects the trance actually slowed reaction time, which only slightly improved once the trance had ended. Rather than presuming he had established anything definite, James merely con-\n\nCONSCIOUSNESS\n\n19\n\neluded that Hall's assertion was by no means proven. He implied that Hall's subject may have been acting out the subconscious desires of the experimenter; and that at the very least one \"should beware of making rash generalizations from few cases about the hypnotic state.\" The third study, a continuation of Wier Mitchell's observations on the phantom limb phenomenon, James also published in the Proceedings of the American Society for Psychical Research}1 He based his work on interviews\n\nand questionnaires with 185 amputees and attempted to find out why some preserve consciousness of a limb after it has been lost, while others do not; why the phantom limb appears fixed in some and moves around in others; and in those that move, why some can will the movement, while with others the movement is beyond their control. James had sent out no fewer than eight hundred circulars to addresses furnished by leading makers of artificial limbs, but he was disappointed in the results because they failed to explain the causes of the enumerated differences. He thought in a delicate inquiry such as this that a single patient carefully cross-examined would yield deeper knowledge than the answers of the average patient to an impersonal circular. Nevertheless, he did get information that he thought might be of use to future inquirers. Three-quarters of the sample that responded, for instance, reported experiencing the phantom limb phenomenon. A much greater number, he said, had felt it immediately after the amputation, or up to years later, but the feeling had faded by the time of their questioning. About one hundred cases said they could work or wiggle their missing limbs at will. In almost all such cases there was accompanying contraction of muscle at the stump. In others, weak electrical stimulation of the stump could produce the sensation of the lost limb, and so on. In almost all cases, James was able to invoke such principles as the doctrine of specific energies to account for the neurological facts. Finally, he took up the problem of how, if telepathic powers actually do exist, it would be possible to feel an insult to a severed limb being acted on at a distance from its former owner. As for the evidence in favor of such telepathic rapport, none in his own hands, James reported, had inspired any confidence. James's fourth study involved observation of subjects who engaged in automatic writing.28 The typical subject would sit at a table with his or her head buried in one arm, while the other arm would be outstretched in the writing position, pencil in hand, over blank paper. If the writing hand could be made to begin to move, say through small circular motions, after some ten minutes or so, in certain developed subjects legible writing would appear of which the person would have no knowledge.29 The phenomenon had been extensively investigated by the British psychical researchers, and the American Society for Psychical Research\n\n20\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nhad collected numerous cases over the preceding three years. James endeavored to show only some half-dozen cases. His point of departure was the assertion made by M. Pierre Janet that in a somnambulist showing double personality, during automatic writing the hand and the arm of the automatic writer were anesthetic. James resolved to look for this symptom in ordinary subjects prone to automatic writing, and, finding it, corroborated Janet's view that a true dissociation of consciousness was present. James showed that once automatic writing began, the subject's arm and hand were completely insensitive to pin pricks and pinches. When asked directly, his head still buried, the subject reported feeling nothing. The anesthetized hand, however, wrote, unbeknownst to the subject, demanding to know why it had been stuck with a pin. James found, moreover, that it was possible to communicate with the two split halves of the subject's personality, one by speaking to the buried head, the other by speaking to the anesthetized hand, and to extract information about the subject's personality from one part that was unknown to the other. While he found no solid evidence for any telepathic ability in the anesthetized hand, James concluded that the implications of the phenomenon of dissociation for understanding psychopathology were obviously far-reaching. In sum, these studies show a clear focus on brain neurophysiology and the problem of consciousness. Not once did James revert to any sort of spiritualist hypothesis about life after death, nor did he presume the reality of psychic phenomena as previously given. Rather, the paradigm of psychical research became an early framework for the scientific study of the relation between mind and body and pointed the way to the later development of dynamic theories about the subconscious. T H E DESCRIPTION OF JAMES'S EARLY LABORATORY\n\nThe fourth piece of evidence I want to present is a description of James's psychology laboratory because it gives us some clues about the direction James's definition of scientific psychology had taken in its early years. The laboratory was pictured to Ralph Barton Perry by one of James's students, Ralph Waldo Black, who had been there in 1886. Black said it was the laboratory in the Lawrence Scientific School: Where there were some human brains in alcohol which I did not consider myself physiologist enough to cut up, also there was some electrical apparatus for measuring time reactions. We would press a key the minute we saw a spark. . . . He [meaning James] had some staples with a pin and a screw in each the width of the staple apart and we all stripped to the waist or rolled\n\nCONSCIOUSNESS\n\n21\n\nup our pant legs and he would try them on the skin to see if we felt the contact as one or two. He said I had the most insensible calves he ever saw and thought perhaps they needed washing. If I were there now I should improvise apparatus and try experiments on my own account, but none of us seemed to realize the opportunity we had to build up a laboratory. . . . There was a sort of barber's chair at the laboratory and we would sit in it and look at a bright object on the wall preparatory to being hypnotized. . . . When it was my turn I grimaced when he approached me after I had stared a while at the object and he said \"You can't be hypnotized.\" But with the doubts that creep into our minds with age I now recall that it occurred to me one evening that I would 'loaf over' to the laboratory and see what was going on. I was an unbidden guest and James said, \"Couldn't you keep away?\" So I now wonder if he 'suggested' my coming.30 Our first inference here is that the methodological approach in James's laboratory was one of some combination of surgical dissection, the electrical measurement of reflexes, and the use of hypnosis to artificially induce dissociated states of consciousness. Also, the student's description of the two-point threshold suggests to us the dual use of a simple piece of experimental apparatus. There are many examples of how James adapted some piece of reaction-time or psychophysical equipment to prove a point in experimental psychopathology. The staple and screw arrangement, for instance, was used in elementary psychophysics to determine when a subject could first detect two skin pricks first held closely together and then moved farther and farther apart, but it also became a way to map anesthetic and hyperaesthetic zones that would characteristically appear on the body of hysteric subjects. And while it is true that we are given the impression that students had to be somewhat self-motivated, the fact is that they had access as undergraduates to laboratory instruction and apparatus. The point is significant, for in the claim of Wundt's laboratory as a first in 1879, Boring omitted to mention that students were not receiving credit for laboratory work even at that time, while as early as 1875 James had arranged for students to get course credit for work in both his own lab and Bowditch's as well.31 Finally, while we have no pictures of the lab setup in the Lawrence Scientific School, from this sketch it is apparent that physiological methods and studies in experimental psychopathology dominated the environment, with due reverence given to the German experimental laboratory methods as at least necessary to round out the picture of experimental psychology. But James did not consider the German approach as being in any way preeminent.\n\n22\n\nCHAPTER TWO THE EARLY RESEARCH COMMITTEES OF THE\n\nASPR\n\nA fifth collection of facts I would like to present is the makeup of the various research committees of the American Society for Psychical Research. In order to appreciate the significance of their impact on James's experimental psychology, one should know that the ASPR was convened in September 1884 in Boston after a visit of the physicist Sir William Barrett. Barrett had come at the instigation of certain distinguished members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, among them Edward Charles Pickering, the Harvard astronomer; Charles Sedgwick Minot, the Harvard embryologist; Samuel Scudder, a distinguished entomologist and head of the Boston Museum of Natural History; and Alpheus Hyatt, editor of Science. The original Committee of Nine that worked on the organization included E. C. Pickering as chairman, plus G. Stanley Hall, William James, Henry Pickering Bowditch, William Watson of MIT, Charles Sedgwick Minot, Alpheus Hyatt, Samuel Scudder, and N.D.C. Hodges as secretary. The first official meeting of the Society was held in January 1885 at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, with eighty-two members and one hundred associates. Among the early members of the American Society for Psychical Research were some of the great lights of American science and medicine, such as Benjamin Peirce, Asa Gray, George Fullerton, Dallas Basche, Henry Ingersoll Bowditch, Moses Allan Starr, and Charles Loomis Dana. The Society's first president was Simon Newcomb, then head of the Smithsonian Institution. But the research committees were all clearly controlled by a tight group of Harvard professors. Charles Sedgwick Minot chaired the Committee on Experimental Psychology, which circulated questionnaires to test the prevalence of superstition in the community. The five hundred returns, tabulated by sex and age, showed by simple totals \"the prevalence of a tendency toward superstition\" and \"the willingness to treat a certain superstition with respect, or at least a show of it,\" especially among women. The Committee on Thought-Transference, chaired by E. C. Pickering from the Harvard Observatory, attempted to ascertain the extent of telepathic powers in the population at large by soliciting random numbers and diagrams from individuals who believed they were reproducing what was hidden away and known only to the experimenters. Telepathy was not found to be widespread, except that numerous similarities were noted to occur frequently in people's responses. Further investigation revealed that specific individuals always chose such numbers or diagrams without knowing why, but the motifs reappeared across individuals. The committee dubbed this phenomenon the number or diagram habit and pointed out that it had no relation whatever to telepathic abilities.\n\nCONSCIOUSNESS\n\n23\n\nThe Committee on Apparitions and Hallucinations, chaired by Josiah Royce from the philosophy department, collected numerous examples of phantasms witnessed by individuals. The work of this committee was performed in conjunction with the International Census of Hallucinations, launched by the Congress of Experimental Psychology in Paris during 1889, and contributed to the idea that inner phenomena involving the subconscious were somehow related to the psychology of mental imagery. The Committee on Mediumship, originally chaired by William Norton Bullard, the Boston physician, was eventually taken over by William James. Under James's guidance numerous individual mediums were investigated. Extensive verbatim transcripts were taken of trance sessions. James's biggest discovery here was Mrs. Leonora Piper, probably the best studied psychic medium in the early history of psychical research. Healthy, vibrant, and free of neuroses, Mrs. Piper represented for James refutation of the physicians' assertion that the ability to enter trance consciousness was a mark of psychopathology.33 James also chaired the Committee on Hypnotism. In the name of this committee, numerous experiments on hypnotic induction and posthypnotic suggestion were carried on in the laboratory at Harvard. James's intent was to replicate the original observations of Charcot, Binet, Janet, Delboeuf, and Bernheim, the physicians and scientists who were at the forefront of the so-called French Experimental Psychology of the Subconscious, whose work had been further studied by F.W.H. Myers, Frank Podmore, and Edmund Gurney of the Society for Psychical Research in London. The work of this committee was important for primarily two reasons. First, the British psychical researchers were the main conduit to the United States for the latest developments in scientific psychotherapy in England, the Netherlands, Europe, and Switzerland. Through them the earliest work of Pierre Janet on dissociation and multiple consciousness was first corroborated and transmitted to the United States in 1887, and in the early 1890s the British group, through James and his Boston colleagues, became the route through which first news of the work of Breuer and Freud on hysteria entered the American psychological literature.34 Second, the laboratory work on hypnotism at Harvard was the basis for the adoption of light hypnosis, crystal gazing, and automatic writing as both diagnostic and therapeutic regimes. Following James's experiments, physicians who ran the outpatient departments at the Massachusetts General and Boston City hospitals, such as James Jackson Putnam and Morton Prince, applied such techniques to large numbers of patients suffering from ambulatory psychoneuroses.35\n\n24\n\nCHAPTER TWO CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe evidence, then, suggests the following picture. Experimental psychology in the hands of William James originated primarily in experimental physiology. But, while the emphasis with Putnam and Bowditch was on the superiority of German science, James clearly remained the exponent of the French clinical and experimental tradition. Moreover, James tempered his interpretation of European science with the more immediate and uniquely American philosophy of science put forth by Wright and Peirce. The result for James was a program that defined the new psychology as the scientific study of consciousness in ways that could be empirically explored in a laboratory setting. Moreover, the history of James's early involvement with experimentation shows the link he developed between experimental physiology, psychical research, and experimental psychopathology. This line of thinking is further corroborated by the setup ofJames's laboratory in the 1880s, the focus of which was clearly on issues related to the mind-body problem. Since James still had to teach the full spectrum of methods then available in psychology, English mental testing, questionnaire methods, and techniques in German experimental psychophysics were given their due, as well as the French emphasis on hypnosis and automatic writing, which had also been taken up by the British psychical researchers. But James's laboratory investigations, especially after 1884, were clearly harnessed in service of the scientific committees of the newly formed American Society for Psychical Research. The effect of those committees, particularly those controlled by James himself, was twofold. First, through James the ASPR acted as a conduit for introducing French and English experimental work on hypnotism and psychotherapeutics into American experimental psychology. Second, the replication of this work in James's laboratory created scientific legitimacy for the application of hypnosis and automatic writing in clinical neurology through the local hospitals. The outcome of these applications was soon to make Boston the center of developments in scientific psychotherapy in the English-speaking world between 1884 and 1920.36 Yet even as these developments were unfolding, by the late 1880s James's attention was focused on bringing a more all-encompassing project to completion, one that would have even larger repercussions for the establishment of psychology as a science.\n\nChapter Three\n\nCONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SUBCONSCIOUS: THE CONUNDRUM OF THE PRINCIPLES\n\n77ie Principles of Psychology broke upon the scientific world in 1890. Its main contribution was to take the study of mental life from the abstract philosophers and, by defining thought and feeling as physiological, to firmly establish psychology as a legitimate discipline within the domain of the natural sciences. James first signed a contract for the book in 1878 to produce the text in two years. That it took twelve showed the unswerving loyalty of his publisher, Henry Holt. But the gamble paid off handsomely, as James's Principles is the only pre-1900 textbook in psychology still in print after a century, and the Briefer Course, which immediately followed—a cut-and-paste version of the larger work—was for many years a standard textbook for most psychology courses in the United States. The long passage of time between first contract and final publication also allowed James to develop more fully some of the ideas for which he has now become most famous—the stream of thought, which in its flights and perchings bears us ever onward; the self and its biological, material, social, and spiritual aspects; habit, the great flywheel of society; and our emotions, which exist, not as abstract entities in themselves, but as the physiological complex of our immediate perceptions. When it finally appeared in the autumn of 1890, James was relieved to get what he called \"the enormous rat, which . . . ten years' gestation has brought forth\" out of his hands. To his publisher he wrote: \"No one could be more disgusted than I at the sight of the book . . . a loathsome, distended, tumified, bloated, dropsical mass, testifying to nothing but two facts: 1st, that there is no such thing as a science of psychology, and 2nd, that WJ. is an incapable.\"1 Nevertheless, as soon as The Principles came out, it was an instant classic. James's biographer, Ralph Barton Perry, noted that it was widely read, even by people who were under no obligation to read it, largely because it was so well written. And despite the fact that it was viewed with some shade of disapproval by laboratory experimentalists and systematizers alike, everyone of any note in psychology felt immediately compelled to get their opinion about it into print. James Sully, the English psychologist, referred to James's \"intellectual larking.\" He believed the book was made up only of assorted articles with WILLIAM JAMES'S\n\n26\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nno plan, and he thought the style questionable.2 Charles Peirce, the mathematical logician, wrote in The Nation that it was \"the most important contribution that has been made to the subject in many years.\" But he also said that James had indulged in \"idiosyncrasies of diction and tricks of language such as usually spring up in households of great talent.\" G. Stanley Hall, James's former student at Harvard and by then editor of The American Journal of Psychology, derided the unscientific nature of the work, describing James as \"an impressionist in psychology.\" Yet the book also had its lion's share of supporters. The Revue Philosophique called it \"une oeuvre glorieuse.\" Carl Stumpf in Berlin, a fellowcritic of Wundt, said that James had written \"the best of all psychologies, such as would make the Germans envious.\" George Santayana, James's younger colleague in philosophy at Harvard, said, \"It would be pedantry to regret the loss of logical unity in a book so rich and living, in which a generous nature breaks out at every point.\" And the literary critic William Dean Howells remarked that James wrote \"with a poetic sense of his facts and with an acute pleasure in their presentation.\" The only problem, according to Howells, was that James \"had come dangerously close to writing a popular book.\" With such diversity of opinion, we must ask, just what was significant about this definitive text, written as it was in almost the style of a psychological novel? To answer, there is significant consensus among James scholars that the primary contribution of the work was James's stated intention to define the science of mental life in terms of a strict positivist epistemology. On the first page of the preface, James made it clear that he intended to keep close to the point of view of natural science throughout his book. According to this point of view, \"every natural science assumes certain data uncritically, and declines to challenge the elements between which its own 'laws' obtain, and from which its own deductions are carried on.\"8 He then proceeded to define psychology as \"the science of finite minds,\" which assumes as its basic data three things: (1) thoughts and feelings, (2) a physical world in time and space with which thoughts and feelings coexist, and (3) what thoughts and feelings know about the physical world. While these are discussable topics, his point was that for a positivistic science, their discussion represented metaphysics and was therefore beyond the scope of his book: \"All attempts to explain our phenomenally given thoughts as products of deeper-lying entities (whether the latter be named 'Soul,' 'Transcendental Ego,' 'Ideas,' or 'Elementary Units of Consciousness') are metaphysical. This book consequently rejects both the associationistic and the spiritualist theories; and in this strictly positivistic point of view consists the only feature of it for which I feel tempted to claim originality.\"4\n\nCONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SUBCONSCIOUS\n\n27\n\nHis position, however, held the important caveat that metaphysics had its place, that it was simply inappropriate for an infant science. Positivism was necessary to launch psychology, but sooner or later \"the data assumed by psychology, just like those assumed by physics and the other natural sciences, must some time be overhauled,\" and \"the effort to overhaul them is clearly and thoroughly metaphysics.\" But the problem in 1890, according to James, was twofold. Psychology needed to divorce itself from metaphysics to be launched, and metaphysics, in any case, was not yet well enough developed for its task of overhauling the sciences. By attacking associationism and spiritualism, James was, in each case, eliminating a metaphysic that was \"fragmentary, irresponsible, and half-awake, and unconscious that she is metaphysical.\"5 He chose instead to treat \"our passing thoughts as integers\" and to regard \"the mere laws of their co-existence with brain states as the ultimate laws for our science.\" How far he achieved this agenda remains to be seen, since quite a bit of metaphysical speculation eventually crept into his text. But the scientific purists who were his detractors remained only a handful and the educated public bought his program, believing, from James's charm and style as much as from his data and his arguments, that psychology could be positivistic and still remain a human science. James's various acknowledgments tip us off to the range of his prevailing attitude. First, he dedicated the book to Francois Pillon, editor of the Critique philosophique. The reason for this is not hard to find. At the heart of James's psychology was a person-centered science, derived largely from the influence of French experimental physiology and from a small knot of philosophers who had been instrumental, not only in James's recovery from his near-suicidal episode, but in expanding James's international reputation.6 As editors of a widely read philosophical journal, Pillon, with Renouvier and Delboeuf (a Belgian), had arranged for most of James's early essays to be translated from the American and British literature beginning in the 1870s. This came about partly because Renouvier's ideas on free will had influenced James during his recovery from depression, and James had gratefully begun a correspondence with Renouvier thereafter. Renouvier then introduced James to Pillon. James was thus known to the French as a Frenchman from the beginning of his career, and his acclaim in France had contributed in no small part to further renown in England and America. His dedication to Pillon was a friendly acknowledgment of this long-standing debt. We get further clues concerning James's agenda in the preface, where he extended \"gratitude for the inspiration I have got from the writings of J. S. Mill, Lotze, Renouvier, Hodgson, and Wundt.\" As last in the line of British thinkers, from Locke through Berkeley and Hume, whose philosophy James would eventually renovate, Mill was a philosophical\n\n28\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nempiricist \"unafflicted with the closed mind of the positivists. \"7 James found Lotze \"soundly scientific without prejudice to ulterior metaphysical considerations.\"8 Renouvier was the thoroughgoing empiricist in whose pluralism James discovered \"the right to believe what his moral will dictated\" and \"a philosophical justification of the attitude required for . . . personal salvation.\"9 Hodgson, a philosophical influence equal to Renouvier, led James to see that all phenomena contain an objective and subjective aspect, \"a distinction which appears, on a certain level of reflection, within the field of consciousness.\"10 As for Wundt, \"in spite of his intolerable sleekness and way of soaping everything on to you by plausible transitions so as to make it run continuous,\" James found \"every now and then a compendiously stated truth . . . which is nourishing or instructive.\"11 At the same time, in his preface James lauded \"the intellectual companionship (to name only five names) of Chauncey Wright and Charles Peirce in old times, and more recently Stanley Hall, James Putnam, and Josiah Royce.\" It would take a separate book to analyze the influences of these figures, but at least they can be roughly estimated. Wright and Peirce represented not only James's early escape from Henry James Sr.'s religious philosophy, as well as James's first introduction to science, but more importantly they stood for the prevailing mood in the developing philosophy of science at Harvard that was only reaching maturity in the 1890s, and of which James had become an integral and (according to President Eliot and professors such as Putnam and Bowditch) indispensable part. Hall had been James's intellectual companion in the new science, first as a student and then as a colleague, until Hall's own agenda had begun by the late 1880s to grate on their relationship. Putnam had drawn James into the earliest scientific experiments in neuropathology in America in the 1870s, only to convert to psychotherapeutics himself through James's work in experimental psychopathology in the 1880s. As for the great Royce, his doctrine of the Absolute provided no mere foil for James's pluralism. Royce was the arch monist and Christian apologist in a secular philosophy department that, nevertheless, stood for an ethical and teleological psychology of self-realization. There can be little doubt that he had taken Henry James Sr.'s place in the constellation of William's cosmology. Royce, in turn, had followed James into psychical research and abnormal psychology. As for its content, Rand Evans maintains that the continuity ofJames's book lies in its positivistic emphasis on a naturalistic psychology in which thought itself is the thinker.12 In my reading, The Principles still had at least two centers of gravity that were not easily reconcilable (probably a not inaccurate reflection of James's own state of mind at the time).\n\nCONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SUBCONSCIOUS\n\n29\n\nThe major paradox, for our purposes, lay in James's description of the normal personality. His stated agenda for the book was to build it around traditional classifications such as instinct, sensation, perception, reasoning, discrimination, the will, and the emotions, and he tried to maintain a focus on the so-called New Science, meaning physiological psychology, or the correlation between mental states and brain states. At the same time, his text kept bursting out of these bounds because he also tried to paint a more all-encompassing picture of the whole personality in its abnormal as well as supernormal manifestations. This created a clash of epistemologies, because of the implication that \"something more\" lay beyond the cognitive center of attention. To describe the accomplishments of the new laboratory science, James needed only to refer to physiological advances on localization of brain function and to the extensive psychophysical literature on vision and hearing, especially in the German language.13 This he did in numerous places. In volume one, for instance, he refers in chapter 3 to extensive experiments in reaction time, while in chapter 9, on \"Attention,\" he mixes pedagogic maxims with details of laboratory experiments. Ditto with chapter 13 on \"Discrimination and Comparison.\" Chapter 14, on \"Association,\" is one long metaphysical statement punctuated with results from the laboratory. Chapter 15, on \"The Perception of Time,\" also contains long descriptions of experimental measurements. The results of experiments based on quantification are also densely presented in his three chapters on perception in volume 2. But to consider the abnormal manifestations of sensations and brain states, James relied on the literature derived from the French Experimental Psychology of the Subconscious, which forms important sections of his chapters \"The Relation of Minds to Other Things,\" \"The Self,\" and \"Hypnotism.\" To consider the possibility of training human faculties beyond their normal but undeveloped range of functioning, as he did in his chapters on habit and in his discussion of double consciousness, he invoked a moral philosophy of character development. His sources here, in addition to the English moral philosophy of Carpenter and Maudsley, encompassed the psychical researches of Edmund Gurney and F.W.H. Myers.14 The problem was that psychophysics, abnormal psychology, and psychical research remained three historically unreconciled sources of empirical knowledge, each trying to supplant the influence of the older moral philosophy while separately claiming their own legitimacy in science. Psychophysical measurements became the back door through which psychologists attempted to identify with the German laboratory ideal in science generally. The positivist epistemology of Helmholtz and\n\n30\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nMach admitted no mental constructs beyond a conceptual interpretation of physical measurements. In thejamesean scheme, this meant that the thinker could still be the thought. But abnormal psychology, which had arisen in the context of medicine, chiefly through French contributions in neurology, had posited the existence of dissociated states, suggesting to James the possibility of different fields of consciousness within mental life. If there could be multiple thoughts, only one of which might be in the field of immediate awareness, could there also be multiple thinkers in the same person? If so, which one was the true self? Meanwhile, psychical researchers in England, breaking completely with the reductionism of the materialists, had proposed that clairvoyant and telepathic abilities were associated with higher evolutionary states of consciousness.15 By presenting all three epistemologies under one cover, James, despite his many caveats to the contrary, created an impression in the naive reader of their unity, as if each were guided by the same underlying assumptions and methods. To the more sophisticated observer, on the other hand, his pages seemed to abound with contradictions. James was not unaware of this situation himself. While he maintained his positivistic focus on the thinker as the thought, he kept injecting metaphysics into the book, and he said so in numerous places. In his chapter \"The Functions of the Brain\" (chapter 5) he first discussed whether or not \"the cortex was the sole organ of consciousness in man.\"16 Abruptly, he then turned to restitution of function, which he considered a \"problem, not so metaphysical.\"17 He spent an entire chapter on the automaton theory, only to proclaim that, \"on purely a priori and (jrwasi-metaphysical grounds, [the theory] is an unwarrantable impertinence in the present state of psychology.\"™ Then, he claimed that, even after\n\n\"swamping the reader with too much metaphysics\" by describing the automaton theory, he intended to follow with a chapter on \"The Mind Stuff Theory,\" which he states would be \"exclusively metaphysical.\"19 Here, he refutes the associationists' theory of the compounding of consciousness—that more complex states are made up of smaller, simpler aggregates. In his chapter on \"The Self,\" he reiterates that the question of 'just who the thinker is\" remains an \"ulterior metaphysical inquiry,\"20 although he says he will allow himself \"to indulge in some metaphysical reflections\" on this subject at the end of the book.21 We also have numerous examples of James indulging in metaphysics without explicitly telling us, although he appears to have been aware of what he was doing. One of the most glaring examples concerns James's mixing of different levels of epistemological discourse. In chapter 2 on \"The Functions of the Brain,\" for instance, while discussing the education of the cerebral hemispheres, he writes as follows:\n\nCONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SUBCONSCIOUS\n\n31\n\nNerve-currents run in through sense-organs, and whilst provoking reflex acts in the lower centers, they arouse ideas in the hemispheres, which either permit the reflexes in question, check them, or substitute others for them. All ideas being in the last resort reminiscences, the question to answer is: How can processes become organized in the hemispheres which correspond to reminiscences in the mind}'1\n\nHe then appends a footnote: I hope that the reader will take no umbrage at my so mixing the physical and the mental, and talking of reflex acts and hemispheres and reminiscences in the same breath, as if they were homogeneous quantities and factors of one causal chain. I have done so deliberately; for although I admit that from the radically physical point of view it is easy to conceive of the chain of events amongst the cells and fibers as complete in itself, and that whilst so conceiving it one need make no mention of 'ideas,' I yet suspect that point of view of being an unreal abstraction.23\n\n\"The radically physical point of view,\" in other words, moves only within its own closed system of logical consistency, but the true state of affairs is that there might be no absolutely closed system. This was the commonsense position, he said, that he would later detail more fully. Until then, since \"language lends itself so much more easily to the mixed way of describing,\" he intended to continue mixing his metaphors. THE METAPHYSICS OF THE PSYCHOLOGIST\n\nThis nexus between the brain and the mind was a recurring metaphysical theme. In discussing \"Some General Conditions of Brain Activity\" (chapter 3), for instance, James had criticized the associationists' scheme that every mental idea corresponds to a single brain cell. While this was, of course, absurd, \"In some way our diagram must be realized in the brain; but surely in no such visible and palpable way as we at first suppose.\"24 He then admitted in a footnote that all such schemes are ultimately symbolic. He justifies them elsewhere, however, by claiming: \"Our usual scientific custom of interpreting hidden molecular events after the analogy of visible massive ones enables us to frame easily an abstract and general scheme which the physical changes in question may be like.\"25 The wonder is that this modeling of objective reality works so often. Nevertheless, James asserts, it never is an exact duplicate. Its claims are always provisional. What was the mechanism by which inner mental states and outer objects were related? The question had more than one dimension. When he said that \"the word on the page does not pass from the page into\n\n32\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nthe mind directly. Rather, the duplication of the object as an inner construction must take place,\"26 he as much meant to describe the phenomenon as he did point to the limits of psychology's ability to address the problem. By stating that \"the dualism of subject and object and their pre-established harmony is what the psychologist as such must assume,\"27he also felt dutybound to recognize the metaphysical boundary of this commitment: What must be admitted is that the definite images of traditional psychology form but the very smallest part of our minds as they actually live. The traditional psychology talks like one who should say a river consists of nothing but pailsful, spoonsful, quartpotsful, barrelsful, and other moulded form of water. Even were the pails and the pots all actually standing in the stream, still between them the free water would continue to flow. It is just this free water of consciousness that psychologists resolutely overlook. Every definite image in the mind is steeped and dyed in the free water that flows around it. With it goes the sense of its relations, near and remote, the dying echo of whence it came to us, the dawning sense of whither it is to lead. The significance, the value, the image is all in this halo or penumbra that surrounds and escorts it,—or rather that is fused into one with it and has become bone of its bone and flesh of its flesh; leaving it, it is true, an image of the same thing it was before, but making it an image of that thing newly taken and freshly understood.28 Psychologists, in other words, tend to take their categories as more objectively real than experience itself. The opposite is quite the case, however. On t"
