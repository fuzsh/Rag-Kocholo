        "text": "William Sterling Estes was my father. He was commonly called Bill, and sometimes Sterl, by family members. He was probably born in either 1902 or 1903, or maybe 1901, records vary, and he died, positively, in 1963. That’s one of the few positive things we know about him. His life was anything but ordinary, and he was missing for many years. And that’s just the beginning…\n\nMy father was a study in polar opposites. He was extremely intelligent, helping his step-son with physics in graduate school, yet did incredibly stupid things that landed him in a heap o’ trouble – and I’m not talking just about that Ilo incident where he married under a fictitious name and then went AWOL. There were more. Many more….\n\nMoonshine and Rough Beginnings\n\nMy father’s issues began when he was young. This isn’t meant as overtly critical, but my father’s early years were anything but stable. He was born near the turn of the century in Claiborne County, Tennessee. That area, deep in Appalachia was both stunningly beautiful and equally as poverty stricken.\n\nLand there, what was farmable, was already taken and the “next generation” had to find something else to do. But there was nothing else there, so many moved on west. In the case of my grandparents, they tried several avenues, one of which was moonshining.\n\nMoonshining wasn’t anything unusual in the hills, nor among the original settlers. In fact making your own liquor had been a staple on every farm for hundreds of years in the US, until the law made it illegal over taxation. It was never a moral issue until Prohibition. Moonshining or bootlegging has been illegal for awhile, actually a long while, in one form or another, but in Appalachia, mostly everyone ignored that. Moonshining increased during Prohibition and has been a staple of that region ever since. My family shares stories of painting milk jugs white and having the kids deliver moonshine in milk jugs in the coal camps from their red wagon. The family survived and ate together, or didn’t. Everyone was expected to contribute. There wasn’t any other choice.\n\nThe Estes family in Halifax County, Virginia, some 4 generations earlier had been known for their fine brandies distilled from their orchards. The difference was, I’m guessing, is that they paid taxes, or they greased the right palm.\n\nIn any case, my grandfather, William George Estes was a moonshiner, a photographer and a farmer, among other things. A veritable Appalachian Renaissance man. He married my grandmother, Ollie Bolton, in September of 1892. In July of 1893, their first child, was born, and a year later, in August of 1893, that son, Samuel would pass away and was buried in the family cemetery in Estes Holler behind his grandfather, Lazarus Estes’, house.\n\nThree months later, a second child was born, Estel, who lived. Two years later, another child whose name we don’t even know for sure, and in another 2 years, Robert, who would burn to death.\n\nLife was rough. The 1900 census gives us a glimpse. William George Estes states that he was out of work for 9 months the previous year.\n\nSometime between 1900 and 1910, the family moved to Springdale. Arkansas where Ollie took care of the children and ran a boarding house and William George fished off the bridge down the street from the boarding house, and drank. By this time, they had several children, and it seemed there were always more on the way. In the 1910 census, Ollie has borne 8 children and only 5 were living.\n\nThis picture of Ollie and the children was taken in 1907. The child, Robert, the blond boy on the chair, would perish when their cabin burned, sometime before the 1910 census. Cousin George Estes, in the 1980s, showed me where that cabin stood and told me he planted a willow tree there in honor of the child. Estel, the oldest child, standing in the rear in this photo, age 13 in 1907, had been left in charge and tried to save Robert, who hid under the bed, to no avail. Estle did manage to get my father, standing in front, and Margaret, held by Ollie, out safely. That memory alone could scar a person for life. Robert too is probably buried in the family cemetery just a few feet away, but there is no marker.\n\nBy 1913, the family had moved to Fowler, Indiana and become tenant farmers. Ollie and William George’s marriage was coming unraveled too. It seems that Ollie’s young female cousin was visiting from Tennessee, and Ollie came home and caught William George and her cousin “in the act.” She grabbed either a bull whip or a horse whip and proceeded to use it on them, specifically on him, with the full intention of killing him. The family stories are that it took 5 adult men to restrain her long enough for him to escape. The family story, from the Crazy Aunts, of course, also says she was pregnant with twins which she subsequently had prematurely and died. If so, the Benton County, Indiana death records contain no record of this birth/death. They could have been too small, or not born alive.\n\nDivorce followed, but according to Aunt Margaret’s letters which she wrote to my step-mother after my father’s death, Ollie went to Chicago, taking the two girls with her, and William George headed back for Tennessee, but no one wanted the two middle boys, my father and Joseph. Estel by this time, about 20, was old enough to make his own way. My father was about 12 and Joseph, about 10.\n\nJoseph and my father hopped a train in Indiana and found their way back to Tennessee, and when they arrived at their grandparents house in Estes Holler, extremely hungry, dirty and threadbare, having walked a great distance, and with stories to tell…there was hell to pay. When William George Estes, their father, arrived sometime later, he was literally run out of Estes Holler by his father, Lazarus Estes, under threat of death, for what he had done both to Ollie and to those boys. William George crossed over the mountains and settled in Harlan County, Kentucky, known as bloody Harlan, where he very successfully moonshined for decades up in the roughest section of Black Mountain, the roughest area in Kentucky, near the coal camps. My Mom visited once with my father and refused to ever return.\n\nUnfortunately, all of William George’s boys learned to drink, and none of them learned to drink in moderation. I was told that when there was no food to eat, the children were given liquor to drink, to make them feel better, or maybe, to make them go to sleep. I found that hard to believe…until I found the death certificate of a child from William George’s third marriage, William James, who died at the age of 2 years and 6 months, in 1935, and the coroner indicated that the child had died from “improper feeding.” I was sick the day I read that, physically ill, because I knew all the things I had heard about my father’s young life and were too horrible to believe, were probably true.\n\nThe reason I mention this at all is because while my father certainly had a huge number of issues, perhaps not all of them were entirely his fault. He was probably an alcoholic while yet still a child. Alcohol both ruled and ruined his life, and certainly affected the lives of all the people around him, including, and maybe especially those who loved him. Alcohol certainly affected the lives of his brothers the same way, and his sisters, well, they became the Crazy Aunts.\n\nWilliam Sterling Estes Joins the Military\n\nMy father joined the military in 1917 during WWI, “adjusting” his birthdate to be 1898 instead of 1901, 1902 or 1903. So did his even younger brother Joseph, nicknamed “Dode,” after his grandfather, Joseph “Dode” Bolton. The military was most likely a better option for my father than any of the alternatives.\n\nSometime about this time, my father met a young gal in Dunkirk, Indiana, named Virgie. My father was extremely handsome, and he certainly understood how to win a young girl’s heart. Look at this picture. He brought Virgie a kitten (see his shoulder) and two baby ducks.\n\nThese photos were sent to me after her death in 1989 by her daughter, along with the flag from my father’s coffin.\n\nNow the kitten is on her lap. I wonder who took the photos.\n\nThis photo is just heart-wrenching to me. I suspect this is when he married Ilo or maybe my sister’s mother, or at least during that timeframe.\n\nWhy did Virgie still have these photos, some 70 year later? Because, she did eventually marry my father, in 1961, some 44 years after these pictures were taken. She was his last wife. They both claimed they were soulmates, and indeed, perhaps they were. She was the only woman I ever met that had something good to say about my father. In fact, she never said one bad thing about him. She was a truly lovely lady.\n\nAs a child, I had no concept of my father’s constant woman problems, the betrayal of trust, his problem drinking, or the fact that he had “another family.” I didn’t know I had a brother, Dave, who was only 5 months older than I was. My mother, who was terribly embarrassed about the situation, managed to hide that from me, as did the “other woman,” from her child too.\n\nMy Father’s Daughter\n\nI never knew my father as an adult. I knew him as a child and I loved him, wholly and completely, in my childish way. My father would come and visit and I would absolutely adore him, much to my mother’s chagrin. It must have been tough from her perspective. She did all the work and he got all the glory for simply showing up. I remember once when he bought me a rocking chair, which I still have to this day, at Krogers. I was maybe 4 or 5 and it was for my birthday or maybe Christmas. Mother was so angry with him, because that is what she was going to get me and he “scooped” her.\n\nI remember another time too when she was furious with him. I understood that she was angry, very angry, and that it wasn’t directed at me, but I didn’t know why. The phone rang, very late at night. She got me up and we went for a drive. I was excited as this was a great adventure in my pajamas. When we got “there,” my Dad was there, which made me very happy. I got to sit on his lap for a few minutes, but then we had to leave, taking his little dog, Timmy, with us, who I thought was my dog. Turns out, Dave thought Timmy was his dog too, and we both had photos of us with Timmy. Here I am in that coveted rocking chair holding Timmy.\n\nYears later, I asked Mom about this very foggy recollection. Turns out, “there” was the jail in the next county. Why? Because he has been arrested for drunk driving. That’s what we called it then, no politically correct terms like “impaired operation of a motor vehicle.” I asked Mom why she went at all and she said, in a semi-growl, “for the dog.” Yep, she would have done that and she would have been furious with him both for having to go and retrieve the dog that wasn’t even hers, and for doing what he did….again.\n\nHis Death\n\nMy father’s death in 1963 in an automobile accident, like every other event in his life, was filled with contradictions. My step-mother told me he was on the way to the preacher’s house to pick him up to go fishing, stone cold sober. Her daughter told me that my father had been seen at the park earlier in the day, intoxicated. Regardless, he reportedly had an angina attack while driving, missed the brake, stomping instead on the gas, and hit a telephone pole head on.\n\nAs an adult, after talking to my mother and his part-time employer at the time, which happened to be the funeral home, I wonder if he committed suicide. On Friday, he backed the hearse into the garage, which in that small town doubled as an ambulance (isn’t that creepy – imaging waking up in the hearse and not knowing if you are dead or alive), and telling the funeral director that he would need it over the weekend. And indeed, he did. My father rode in it as an ambulance to the hospital on Sunday and a few days later rode in it as a hearse to the cemetery.\n\nAs I got older, everything I knew about my father seemed to be contradicted by something or someone else. I wanted to love the man, but in some ways, he didn’t seem to be very nice – rather unlovable. I finally came to the conclusion that while my adult woman self would not like him very much at all, it was just fine for my young child self to continue to love him. My mother once said to me in a fit of unbridled honesty that the best thing my father probably ever did for me was to die when I was young before I painfully discovered his betrayals personally. She managed to shield me from most of his drinking.\n\nIf I couldn’t know him personally, I wanted to know of him, to understand him. I was insatiably curious about him. He seemed so mysterious. After all, I carried part of him in me. What was that part and what made my Dad tick, aside from alcohol? Sadly, I came to discover that alcohol and the actions he took under its influence truly did rule his life.\n\nThe Timeline\n\nI started creating a timeline trying to make sense of my father’s life. There were so many disjoint pieces. I wrote for his military records, but most of them were destroyed in a fire in the St. Louis records center in 1973. The military helped reassemble as much as possible from other sources.\n\n1917 – In a letter from the VA it says that he served in the Army from Aug. 24, 1917 until honorably discharged on May 19, 1919. His last rank was private. He was born Oct. 1, 1898 and died on Aug. 27 1963. He enlisted May 14, 1917 at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, 18 years 24 days of age, born in Tazewell, Tennessee. Subsequent service – enlisted May 20, 1919.\n\nI have a copy of this discharge, Sergeant first class, honorably discharged on May 19, 1919 at Camp Custer, Michigan. His second discharge was honorable as well, even given his time spent in the Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, which really surprised me.\n\n1919, May 20 – My father reenlisted in the Army at Camp Custer.\n\nNovember 1919 – AWOL from the Army.\n\nDecember 1919 – Married Ilo Bailey in Battle Creek, Michigan, under the name of Don Carlos. Aunt Margaret remembered her name as Laila LaFountaine and said that “she hooked him to the plow and drove him like a horse.”\n\nFebruary 1920 – Son Lee born, eventually to be called Lee Devine, in Battle Creek to Ilo.\n\nApril 1920 – Arrested for being AWOL – sent to Fort Leavenworth Disciplinary Barracks in Kansas.\n\nMay 1920 – My sister, Edna born, also in Battle Creek, Michigan, to Martha Dodderer.\n\nNovember 28, 1921 – Honorably discharged from the military at Fort Leavenworth.\n\nDecember 12, 1921 – Married Edna’s mother in Battle Creek, Michigan.\n\n1924 – Martha Estes (Edna’s mother) was paying an attorney for her divorce. His name was Joseph Hooper and he lived in Battle Creek. The divorce appears to have been final Feb. 26, 1924. Edna stated in a 1960 letter than before 1950, no one had heard from him in 29 years. We don’t know where William Sterling Estes was in 1924.\n\n1927 – William Sterling Estes enlisted in the military January 8, 1927 at Fort Sheridan in Chicago. He was AWOL on May 23, 1927.\n\n1924-1930 – William Sterling Estes “married” again during this time, probably in southwestern Michigan, possibly Benton Harbor, having a daughter named Violet, about whom very little is known. Violet married a Golliday or Galliday. Violet later married a Blevins and joined a religious commune in the Ozark Mountains in or near Licking, Missouri. Given this and some additional information provided by my sister Edna, who knew Violet, I decided not to pursue this relationship. Violet was still living in the 1980s, to the best of my knowledge.\n\nThe Crazy Aunts told me that Violet’s mother may have been underage, because there was a statutory rape allegation, charge or conviction in western Michigan, possibly in the Benton Harbor area, having to do with the age of the pregnant female. Michigan prison records held in the State Archives don’t reveal any William Estes having been a prisoner during this timeframe.\n\nApparently, the Crazy Aunts weren’t the only ones who were suspicious, because Ellen, the “other woman” to whom my father was married in the 1950s wrote a letter to the warden at Jackson State Prison in Michigan inquiring about whether or not my father could have been a prisoner there under an alias.\n\nA letter from the warden of Jackson State Prison to Ellen on Feb. 21, 1957 states that inmate number #24884, Paul LeMarr, alias William Estes, sentenced March 2, 1929 to 10-15 years for statutory rape, was discharged on March 20, 1942. He was sentenced in Benton Harbor, Michigan and he was age 29 in 1929. The warden believed that from photos submitted by Ellen that Paul LaMarr could have been William Sterling Estes.\n\n1937 – William Sterling Estes filed for his social security card in Chicago, Illinois. He is working at Printers Finishing Company and gives his birth date as Oct. 1, 1902, which I believe to be correct. The signature is my father’s.\n\nThis proves that my father is not Paul LeMarr, because Paul LeMarr was not released from prison until 1942. Was Paul LeMarr using William Estes as an alias? Finally, something in Dad’s favor! But where did that statutory rape rumor come from? Was it Violet’s mother and did the charge “go away” because he married her?\n\nSo if he wasn’t in prison in Michigan, where was he from 1927 to 1937?\n\nThe Crazy Aunts said he was in prison or jail in Michigan at one time, and that one of them visited him there. But then again, they are the Crazy Aunts and he could have been in “jail” for a few days for who knows what.\n\nThere is a rumor about him being in prison in Illinois (Joliet) based on a statement he made to my mother about where he had made someone’s acquaintance. On the way to Florida in the early 1950s, he stopped at the Georgia prison and visited with the prison guards, the very men who had been his guards. He made friends with everyone everyplace he went and the man did not know a stranger. I suspect he could have sold ice cubes to Eskimos.\n\nIt’s hard to believe that after being married 3 or 4 times in less than 10 years that he became a monk for the next decade. Maybe he wasn’t as good at getting divorced as he was at getting married. He had to be someplace doing something. And I’m betting that there may be children out there someplace lurking that were conceived between the 1920s when Edna, Lee and Violet were born, and the 1950s when Dave and I were born. I doubt that he discovered how to prevent pregnancy in the late 1920s and suddenly forgot in the 1950s.\n\nThe next hint we have about William Sterling Estes is about 1938.\n\nIn March 2006, I visited with the daughter of Estel Estes. My cousin said that my father came to stay with their family in Fleming, Kentucky in 1938 or 1939. She was a little girl at the time. They went for walks together and they found a baby duck without a mother, which they rescued and raised. She said that the duck was old when it finally died. My father stayed with their family for a month or 6 weeks. She said that there was talk that he had gotten out of prison. There was diphtheria wherever he had been.\n\n1938, Oct. 31 – Discharged from Service – “Other than honorable.” This is maddeningly brief. Is this the discharge that matches up with the enlistment from 1927? This makes no sense. This also doesn’t tell us where he is, just that this action occurred.\n\nThe Unbelievable Story – 2 for 1\n\nNow, let me tell you an unbelievable story. This is one of two, actually, that kind of fit together like two insane puzzle pieces, and you’ll see why I was convinced that my Crazy Aunts were indeed, crazy. As time went on, it wasn’t just the Crazy Aunts though that told this story, but my step-mother and others who lived in Claiborne County at the time this was happening.\n\nThe Doctor\n\nI remember, when I was a child, there was an old doctor who had his Norman Rockwellish office in the front part of his home down the street from where we lived in Indiana. I went there one time when I was older, maybe a teen, for something, when the old gentleman said that he remembered my father and that my father was a doctor too. I told him that I was sure he had the wrong man, and he repeated his name and told me, no, that he was not mistaken, that he remembered me, and that my father was indeed a doctor. He dug around in a drawer, pulled out my father’s file, and showed me where it said he was a doctor.\n\nBeing raised in a time when one did not contradict your elders, at least not ones that weren’t your mother, I didn’t say anything, but I was sure this man was wrong. However, I never forgot the story. It always nagged at me, the feeling that something wasn’t quite right or that there was something that I didn’t know.\n\nI went to visit my step-mother from the time I was a child. I first went to visit my Dad and Virgie, my step-Mom, when I was young, before Dad passed away. I loved to visit. Virgie’s elderly mother lived there too, Grandma, whom I dearly loved. Grandma would tell me how smart my Dad was. I found this kind of odd. He worked on furnaces and had his own furnace shop at that time in Dunkirk, Indiana. She said not to let that fool me, that he had once been a great man. Oh, the rantings of an old woman. I loved her just the same. We contented ourselves looking at ViewMaster reels and its predecessor, the stereoscope. My favorite was Niagara Falls. Grandma would tell me all about the images while I looked and they came to life. I loved spending time with Grandma.\n\nAfter my father and Grandma were both gone, I visited Virgie from time to time until her death. They were always such pleasant visits. She told me wonderful stories about the loving man she knew as her husband. Yes, I mean my father.\n\nBefore his death, he hid love letters and notes around the house for her to find later. I’m sure he knew his time was limited. My mother told me that based on his health, she thought he might have had cancer. I’m more suspicious of cirrhosis of the liver, but regardless, he was not a healthy man. One time, Virgie shared with me a note she had just found stuck behind a picture frame. It was so sweet and personal and it was nice to know him in this lovely way. She also kept all of his letters he wrote to her when he was in the service. Her daughter sent those to me after Virgie’s death. Even though I felt like I was intruding into a personal vignette, I did read them. They were both sorrowful and beautiful, especially from my perspective, looking backwards in time and knowing what happened.\n\nVirgie told me that my father understood physics and helped her son when he was studying for his PhD. I questioned this, and she said that she didn’t know how he had come upon that knowledge, but that he had worked at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and that at some time, in some way, he was a doctor. Truthfully, I found all of this quite unbelievable. I knew that Virgie was not one of the Crazy Aunts, and that she would never tell me something she didn’t believe. She told me that he had done those things before he “went into the hospital.” What she didn’t add was that the hospital stay was the VA hospital to “dry out.”\n\nApparently, he “dried out” several times, but never was able to stay dry, although he desperately wanted to. It’s too bad that Alcoholics Anonymous did not exist then. He might have stood a fighting chance. I discounted all of this, figuring that most of it was fanciful stories he had made up – but that didn’t explain how he could ever help a college student studying for an advanced degree that included physics.\n\nWhen I started my genealogy search, I contacted people in Claiborne County, Tennessee. All I started with was the name of a town, from my mother, Tazewell. I called the telephone operator and told her to connect me to any Estes family there – and she did. I eventually made my way from person to person to the family historian and my relatives. They told me stories about my father and grandparents. They knew them. Of course, all of those old people are gone now.\n\nI went to visit and met many of these lovely people who opened their hearts, shared their photos albums and family stories with me. They told me that my father was a doctor and he treated people locally, for years. In fact, people would find out when he was coming home and line up to see him. He was a favorite. And he performed surgery. Surgery? More than one person told me this. They also told me that he practiced at the VA hospital in Knoxville, Tennessee until a patient bit him and he hit the patient.\n\nThey told me that at one time, he worked at Oak Ridge, and that he worked on ‘the bomb,” and that he was never “right” after that. His drinking increased. At that time, he was living in Claiborne County and these people knew him. He was their neighbor. These were family members who had known him their entire life. They were not all making this up – but where was the kernel of truth in these seemingly conflicting, albeit very interesting, stories?\n\nHow could he have been a doctor, as in medical doctor, and also a physicist? Furthermore, he had no more than a high school education to the best of my knowledge, if that, except that we really don’t know what he did or where he was for that 10 year period. Was he in the military that entire time doing something “special’ that we don’t know about? Those records for that time are entirely missing.\n\nHe could have learned about medicine while serving in a hospital someplace, but I don’t think you can learn physics that way. Physics is extremely difficult under the very best of circumstances.\n\nThe requirement for a doctor to practice, legitimately, in Tennessee at that time are foggy, but in general, by 1930, nearly all medical schools required a liberal arts degree for admission and provided a 3- to 4-year graded curriculum in medicine and surgery. Many states also required candidates who wanted to get their medical license to complete a 1-year internship in a hospital setting in addition to holding a degree from a recognized medical school. That presumes that one is doing things legally and by the book. Of course, in Appalachia, healers had been treating their families and those of their neighbors for decades, and local neighborhood healers were probably trusted much more closely that “outsiders.” Joseph, my father’s brother, was also a practitioner, a family herbal healer. Death certificates during that time in Claiborne County are rife with comments like “refused to go to the hospital because did not want to split up the family” and many included reports of people refusing to see a doctor.\n\nMy brother, Dave, told me that he thought William Sterling was arrested for performing illegal abortions in or near Chicago in the 1950s or 1960s.\n\nThere is obviously some truth in here someplace, because there were too many witnesses….but where…and what was that truth? Back to the timeline.\n\nMany Wives – Too Many\n\n1944 – I reached out to the Tennessee State Archives who provided me with information that William Sterling Estes began working for the Eastern State Mental Hospital on Dec. 29, 1944 and that he was dismissed March 12, 1945. He was an attendant. His legal voting residence was Claiborne Co., Tn. but he lived in Harlan Ky., while he worked at the State Hospital. He was married, no wife’s name given, but he had relatives in state service – Dortha Estes also at Eastern State.\n\nThey could provide me no information about Oak Ridge or the VA Hospital.\n\n1940s – Per Aunt Margaret’s (his sister) letter to Virgie, William Sterling was married to a woman in Oak Ridge, Tn., although she knew of no children by her. Margaret also states that he got in trouble in the 1940s by “taking a girl over the state line,” perhaps to Kentucky, and spent some time in jail, but Ethel was apparently faithfully waiting for him. Who was Ethel?\n\nLate 1940s – The next we know of William Sterling was in the (possibly) late1940s when he was married to a woman named Ethel and living with his aunt, Cornie Epperson in Claiborne County, working at Oak Ridge Tennessee, possibly in a hospital there. We know of no children from this marriage. Cornie’s daughter says he was a doctor in the VA hospital. Aunt Dorothy says he operated on her foot. While this was reported as late 1940s, it sounds to me like it may have occurred before 1945.\n\n1945 – March 15 – William Sterling Estes, now about age 42 or 43, married a 17 year old young female in Walker County, Georgia. Note that this is only 3 days after his dismissal from Eastern State Mental Hospital in Knoxville, Tennessee, assuming that he was actually present in Knoxville at the time he was dismissed. He could have been dismissed for not showing up at work. Regardless, the Georgia courtship seems very abbreviated.\n\nI am not including the name of the gal he married in Walker County, because I believe she is still living. He gives his age as 34, born Oct. 1, 1911 and residence as Chicago. Shortly after this marriage, her father filed papers against him for bigamy, giving his other wife’s name as Dorothy Kilpatrick. I surely wonder how her father made that discovery. Did Dorothy show up? Maybe right after the wedding, shouting, “I object!”\n\n1945 – 1948 – In the Superior Court of Walker Co. Georgia on June 15, 1945, three months to the day after his marriage, William Sterling Estes was convicted of bigamy and sentenced to 5 years in prison. According to prison records, he was discharged Dec. 13, 1948. His wife on arrival at the prison was listed as Dorothy Estes, also listed as Dorothy Kilpatrick in court papers, Trailer Camp, NW 5th St., Richmond, Indiana. He was in the Georgia State Prison at Reidsville, Georgia. The specific court records no longer exist, nor do the prison records.\n\nA few years ago, I spoke to the Georgia wife. She did not have any children by William Sterling and said the marriage was annulled. She did marry and have one child, about 5 years later. I verified this child’s age and he was not born at a time when he could have been my father’s child.\n\nSo what happened to Dorothy? And Ethel? And the young gal he “took over the state line.” Or was that story really the bigamous marriage in Georgia?\n\nBack to Chicago\n\n1949 – Apparently, after William Sterling was released from prison in Georgia, he returned to Chicago where his mother lived. He lost no time marrying again, this time to an Ellen in Cook. Co., Illinois on Feb. 19, 1949. This must be some kind of record. An entire courtship and marriage in less than 2 months. Quick courtships seemed to be his style. Apparently Dorothy divorced him while he was in prison? But then again….um….maybe not.\n\n1950 – William Sterling Estes finds my sister, Edna, in Michigan after a hiatus of almost 30 years. Edna’s mother has passed away and Edna was none too pleased with her prodigal father.\n\n1952 – His delayed birth certificate issued in Tennessee gives his address as 2210 Broadway, Fort Wayne, Indiana.\n\nThe “Other Woman’\n\n1955 – Both my brother David and I were born within 5 months of each other, to different wives. No, my father was not Mormon.\n\nMother told me years later that he filed for divorce from Ellen in 1955, in Florida, but somehow the waiting period got “messed up,” as in one day short. Therefore the divorce didn’t happen, but apparently he thought it had. My reaction to this? “Likely story.”\n\nI checked the Florida divorce index and there is nothing for a William, William Sterling or any Estes male involving a woman named Ellen. That’s assuming that he used his correct name to get divorced. I did verify the name on his marriage license to Ellen to be sure it was correct.\n\n1956, April 3 – Mom wrote my sister, Edna a letter that includes information about my father. She says “Bill is working very hard right now and when spring comes his business starts to be pretty heavy. He wasn’t too well this winter but we hope he will be better when the weather gets nice. He was out working through in spite of the way he felt.”\n\nThe photo below, I believe, is the only photo of me with my father, taken in 1956. I have no idea who the other child in the photo, beside my father, is. Makes me wonder…\n\n1956 – November 3. My father is a passenger in a head on car accident that nearly kills him. He flies through the windshield. This is before the days of seatbelts or safety tempered glass. I still vividly remember the scar on his forehead and the skin graft they did from his leg to his face and head. This car accident was his undoing in more than one way though. You see, it’s how he got caught with 2 wives, in the worst possible soap opera scenario.\n\nBusted\n\nMom actually heard the sirens that day. She remembers saying something like “I hope that’s not Bill.” But it was. Sometime later, the police came and took us to the hospital. My father was not expected to live. He had lost a great deal of blood and was badly injured.\n\nAt the hospital, employees had dug through his billfold and other personal information to figure out who to contact. He was not conscious.\n\nMother and I were sitting by his bedside. I remember none of this of course.\n\nA few hours later, another woman, also with a baby walks into the room, looking for her husband. Mother motioned to the next bed, but the woman came back and said no, that the man in this bed, my father, was her husband.\n\nBoth women stared at each other, and their babies, incredulously, as the awful truth slowly sunk in, and then they began to talk, as he lay comatose. He’s a very lucky man indeed, that they simply did not finish him off. I think they wanted him to regain consciousness so they could beat him senseless. Needless to say, they were both furious.\n\nYes, they were both his wives. Ellen lived in Chicago (or Fort Wayne) at that time. My father traveled selling and arranging installations of industrial furnaces and he literally had a wife at both ends of the track, so to speak. Can you imagine the stories the doctors and nurses had to tell when they went home that day. “You are not going to believe this…..” My mother couldn’t believe it either, and neither could Ellen.\n\nThere is another family story that has something to do with my father, my (Brethren) grandfather and a baseball bat…but I never did get that entire story. I got the general drift though and I’m guessing it might have happened about this time.\n\nAbove, my father outside one of the Holland Furnace company offices, from my mother’s photos. Below, my father outside the Holland Furnace company facility from Ellen’s photos.\n\nMy mother wasn’t as forgiving as Ellen who stayed married to him…at least for awhile.\n\n1960, Oct. 3 – A letter from the Cook Co., Illinois Adult Probation Dept. to my sister saying that William Estes is under the supervision of that office and his whereabouts are no longer known to them. Unless they are able to locate him, a warrant will be issued for his arrest for probation violation. William D. Meyering is the person who wrote the letter and he is the chief probation officer.\n\nEdna wrote a letter to the Cook Co. Adult Probation Department, replying to their letter of inquiry. She said she had not had contact with him for 4 years and had not seen him in 6. She says in 1956 he was with my mother and working for Holland Furnace Co. She said she did not believe he would come to her house because she did not know him well, had only seen him about 10 times in her life, and all in the past 10 years. Before then it had been 29 years since anyone had heard from him. Doing the math, this means that she corresponded with him from 1950-1956 to some degree, and before that it had been 1921, the year she was born. She asked why he was on probation, but did not receive a reply.\n\nMother said that about this time, Bill was working in Wisconsin, near Chicago. He showed up in Indiana with a small station wagon that was brand new, an electric skillet, a toaster, clothes and toys. The police arrested him for something to do with fraud. The title for the car he traded was not clear, or something to that effect. She said he served several months in the Chicago jail, which ironically would be the same Cook Co. jail where I installed inmate tracking software some 20 years later.\n\nDavid thought he might have been sent to jail for performing illegal abortions in Wisconsin.\n\n1960 – There is a dated photo of Bill sitting in the living room at Ellen’s house in Fort Wayne. David remembers him living with them in Fort Wayne. The city directory confirms that as well.\n\n1960-1962 – This is the timeframe when Mom and I went to pick Timmy up from the jail. My mother did not bail him out, much to his dismay, but took Timmy and left. Mom said that when he got out of jail, the time we went to get Timmy, that he came by the house, and then went to Virgie’s in Dunkirk, and was unhappy that no one had come to see him.\n\nMom said that he spent time in jail in Terre Haute, Indiana, at some time, for repeated drunk driving offences. I am unclear about when that might have been, but I got the idea it was when she knew him and perhaps after she was no longer romantically involved with him.\n\nMarried for the Last Time\n\n1961, April 24 – William Sterling Estes married Virgie, his childhood sweetheart, in Rome, Georgia under the name William S. Este’ (no final s). I would think that given what happened to him previously in Georgia when he was married to two women, he would have avoided Georgia entirely and would have been as nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rockers just being in the state. Can you believe he did this again, and in Georgia no less? He was not divorced from Ellen.\n\nAccording to mother, she is the one who told Virgie that he was not legally divorced from Ellen so Virgie and my father had to go to Florida and “take care of it.”\n\nVirgie’s daughter says he worked in a heating place in Fort Wayne for about a year before they married. He was likely living with Ellen during this time, unbeknownst to Virgie. This man could never pull this off today in the age of cell phones, texting, e-mail and FaceBook.\n\nDespite his “misrepresentation” of things, Virgie loved him dearly. Apparently, among other things, he told Virgie that my mother was his sister. My Mom was hopping mad about that one. Virgie wrote to me after his death “that no matter what people say, there is a lot that goes into human behavior and your father is not ALL bad.”\n\n1961 – There is an envelope from Jopling, Darby and Duncan, Attorneys at Law, People’s Hardware Building, Lake City, (Columbia County) Florida dated October 17, 1961 addressed to William S. Estes at 501 Hickory St., Dunkirk, Indiana. This may have to do with the divorce from Ellen that somehow went awry. Someone said that the lawyers filed it a day late.\n\nThis is the last known picture of William Sterling Estes, with Virgie, obviously at Christmas time, in the early 1960s. I would guess this is Christmas 1961 or 1962.\n\n1963, Aug. 27 – William Sterling Estes died. From funeral home information, it says in WWI he was hit ?? in a??. Looks like he was hit in the arm with something. It also says that he had a ruptured right col??. Right side of page is cut off.\n\nHis obituary says he is a member of the Ralph Burgess post 227 of the American Legion “here”, the Williamson-Smiley Post 401 of Redkey, and the DAV post in Portland.\n\nAfter my step-mother died, her daughter sent me items related to my father. In fact, one day, I went to the mailbox to discover the flag from my father’s coffin stuffed in the back of the mailbox in one of those heavy Tyvek mailing envelopes. Thankfully, the envelope held.\n\nAmong other things she sent me, unfortunately, attempting to reuse the same envelope some 30 years later, was a condolence card from the White House, to Virgie, “signed” by President Kennedy and postmarked Sept. 10, 1963, just a few weeks before Kennedy’s own untimely death.\n\nMy Favorite Memories\n\nAlthough I don’t have a lot of memories of my father, I do have some and a few that stand out.\n\nThere are a couple things that have struck me over the years. Most all of the photos I have ever seen of him show him in either a suit or a dress shirt. There is maybe one or two in a t-shirt and jacket. He did not talk, act or look like a “jailbird,” in any way. He always looked and acted professional and sophisticated, from my perspective and that of many others as well. He either was as he appeared, or he was a supreme con artist – or maybe both.\n\nHe loved to fish. Dave and I both share memories of fishing with him. Here he is with his can of worms and his ever-present coffee cup. Wherever he was in his lifetime, he found a place to fish. He was drawn to it like a moth to a flame.\n\nAnd speaking of coffee, Dad started me drinking coffee. Actually, today they would be called lattes because they consisted mostly of milk and sugar with a little coffee added in. I loved them then and still do.\n\nMy Dad also rescued critters, animals in need. Dogs, cats, ducks and even a raccoon. The mother raccoon got killed. He scooped the baby up and rescued it off of the road. It traveled with him for a long time, but I don’t know what ever happened to said raccoon. I believe Timmy was a rescue of some kind too.\n\nYou’re going to laugh when I tell you this, but he loved kids. I’m not sure he loved the responsibility that went along with them, but he did love them, and I don’t just mean creating them. Dave and I both have very good memories with him.\n\nI remember going to the VFW post with Virgie and my Dad and he used to let me pull the arm of the slot machine. I thought watching the spinning dials was great fun, and if I ever won anything, I got to keep it. I was a very rich 5 or 6 year old with a jarfull of pennies! My mother was appalled, both about the slots and the coffee drinking!\n\nI remember one Easter when I was maybe 2 or 3 that Mom and Dad hid a little red wagon behind the couch. I was ecstatic, and I found a purple easter egg too. I’ve always loved purple and that egg was so richly colored.\n\nAnd I remember when Dad brought me a small handmade stuffed doll we named Sleepy because her eyes were simply stitches and she appeared to be asleep all of the time. She was maybe 6 inches long, and we made a bed for her out of a tomato crate that held 3 tomatoes and we made her a blanket for her bed that fit her perfectly. I had Sleepy until I was an adult when she disintegrated.\n\nI remember when Dad took me to my first Indian Powwow. I was about 5. Powwows were illegal then, and mother was utterly furious that he had taken me to something illegal. I, on the other hand, loved it. They had braided my hair. I had danced. For the first time, I felt like I belonged someplace. They gave me a beautiful beaded belt and braid ties. He bought me a fringed leather jacket. But he did more than that, far more than he knew or anyone could have guessed. He introduced me to my people, to my heritage, to a people and heritage I take great pride in. He introduced me to my future, that day, at the illegal powwow, and planted a seed that blossoms today. Thank you Dad.\n\nAnd then, there is my final memory, and it’s not directly of Dad. Virgie told me that as he lay dieing in the hospital, that gave her a message for me. First, he asked her to be sure I graduated…although I’m not sure from what, although I expect he meant college. Then he told her to tell me that I’m smart and I can do absolutely anything I want to do. His words would be echoed, almost word for word, a decade later from my step-father, almost like an arrow shot through time.\n\nNeither of those men, I’m sure, had any idea of the power or the inspiration of those words, or the comfort they would bring me. My faith in difficult times, in the face of a fearful future was rooted, in part, in the knowledge that I knew they both had total confidence in me, even if I didn’t, that they loved me to the depth of their souls, and neither of them would ever steer me wrong.\n\nJust because our family members can’t overcome their personal demons doesn’t mean they don’t love us.\n\nThe DNA\n\nYou might suspect that with all of this chronic uncertainly swirling around in my father’s life that I had some doubt that any or all of his children were actually his, including me. I desperately, and I do mean desperately, wanted his DNA. Initially, I was seeking his Yline, but then I realized he had Ollie’s mtDNA and now of course, I’d love to have his autosomal.\n\nI discovered hairs under his hatband and I attempted to have DNA extracted from them, as well as from an envelope mailed in the 1960s from my grandfather to my father. No luck with any of those, and we tried three times. You can read all about that in the article, “Digging Up Dad, Exhumation and Forensic Testing Alternatives.” And for the record, no, I didn’t. I do, however, still have a couple of hairs and someday when the technology has improved, I’d still love to have his DNA. Maybe by then, I can do a full genome sequence.\n\nFortunately, I was able to go back upstream a couple of generations and find one male Estes descended from Lazarus Estes, my father’s grandfather, left to test. This gave me the Yline, and it did match the known Estes line, which of course, disproved my brother Dave’s descent from my father. The grown up me thinks that it’s somehow fitting that the ultimate scammer, in terms of women and drama, got scammed himself.\n\nI upgraded that same cousin’s DNA to autosomal when that test became available, and thankfully, I match him. I heaved a huge sigh of relief that day, let me tell you.\n\nFortunately, several cousins were willing to test, along with my sister’s granddaughter, so we’ve proven the rest of the relationships, at least those available to us. And because my mother tested before she passed over, I in essence have half of my father’s autosomal DNA by subtracting my mother’s half from mine. Not the same, granted, but certainly not bad for a guy who has been dead now for more than half a century.\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nI think it’s possible that people are still living who were involved with or knew William Sterling Estes. For example, there may be someone out there who knows something about Ethel, last name unknown, but probably Estes at one time, or Dorothy Kilpatrick Estes – the two women he was involved with in the 1940s and probably married to in Tennessee…or maybe Indiana.\n\nI suspect that there may be more wives in the 1930s. I suspect even more strongly that there may be more children. It find it hard to believe that he [supposedly] fathered 3 children in the 1920s, 2 in the 1950s and none inbetween. For all I know, he may have had several more families. He’d certainly get married in the blink of an eye. His haunt seemed to be from Michigan to Florida, but my mother met him on a train from Philadelphia to Chicago.\n\nI nearly had a coronary writing this article when I found on Ancestry that someone had attached a wife and several children to him in Harlan County, KY in the 1920s and 1930s. I don’t think it’s him, mostly because if it was, the Crazy Aunts and the rest of the family would have known about a wife, Addie, and a half dozen kids in that vicinity. And truthfully, I can’t imagine him being with one woman for more than a decade. It didn’t seem to be his style. Plus I know he was in Chicago in 1937, but still…he was a slippery guy. I’ve sent the woman who owns the tree a note asking how she knows that Addie was married to William Sterling Estes….just in case. She hasn’t answered, and I don’t expect she will. I figure she just attached Addie to the closest William Estes and my grandfather, William George Estes, was living nearby and had a son, William Sterling, of about the right age.\n\nIf you can fill in any blanks, please let me know. I hope we can complete the missing chapters to his story, one way or another, or at least add some puzzle pieces. I’ve love to figure out where he was for a decade.\n\nAnd yes, I’m still waiting for that DNA match that one day, I just know is going to happen!\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nDisclosure\n\nI receive a small contribution when you click on some of the links to vendors in my articles.

There was still snow on the ground in places where there had been drifts, but the first spring flowers were shyly peeking their heads out into the warm sunshine as the last of the snow melted. Mom and I were sitting at her kitchen table, chatting about much of nothing, in the way that mothers and daughters do once they’ve survived the miserable teenage years and become fast friends as adults.\n\nWe had been discussing family history, one of the interests we had in common. Ironically, I gave her a family history book to be completed about 10 years earlier. She kept it for a few months, then gave it back to me. Empty. I quizzically looked at her and asked why it was empty. She said that she thought I should do the book. I told her I didn’t know anything about the family history, which is why I gave the book to her. She smugly looked at me and said, “Well, I guess we’ll have to do it together then won’t we.” Touché, Mom! We had great adventures for the next decade doing just that!\n\nIn passing, that sunfilled spring morning, mother mentioned that her grandmother, Evaline Miller, known as Eva, always wore her “white hat.” White hat? What white hat? And why? Mom didn’t know. She said she never thought to ask, it was just always a part of her grandmother and she never thought anything of it. Little did she know it was the hint that would launch a search and lead to the discovery of an entire branch of the family.\n\nMother mentioned that Eva and her family were from the New Paris area in Northern Indiana, not far from where we were sitting that day. Not being terribly familiar with the various German immigrant groups at that time, I presumed this meant Eva was Amish or Mennonite, the two most prevalent in the region. The women of both religions practice “plain dressing” and wore prayer caps. Having grown up in this area, I was familiar with the practice and the people, but had always viewed them as “other,” separate from me. Them, those nice quiet people who never got into trouble. Definitely not connected to me, or so I thought.\n\nSince Eva married a Dutch (as in fresh from the Netherlands Dutch) man, Hiram Ferverda, I figured she was Mennonite, because the Amish would not have allowed her to marry outside the church. I was wrong. The Miller family would prove to be German Baptist, commonly called Dunkards, now known as Brethren, with a long history of religious perseverance, and so, apparently, were the Ferverdas, at least in the US.\n\nAfter immigrating from the Netherlands in the late 1860s, the Ferverdas joined the Brethren Church. Apparently Hiram Ferverda’s father had been Lutheran in Holland, but his first and second wives, both Dutch, has been Mennonite. So, as you might guess, the family adopted a pietist faith. Anyone who thinks the wife doesn’t run the family hasn’t been married very long:) The beliefs of the Brethren and Mennonite are not drastically different.\n\nThe picture above is Eva Miller Ferverda, sitting on the porch of her home in Leesburg, Indiana. I had always wondered at the significant of the three stars in the window behind her, if any. I discovered that the window star banner was adopted in 1917 displayed during WWI to indicate family members fighting in that War. Three of Eva’s sons were serving.\n\nOn the document below found in the probate records of Eva’s father, her signature is recorded, along with those of her two full siblings and her mother, Margaret, who could not write and signed with an “X” as her mark.\n\nEvaline Louise Miller, known as Eva (rhymes with Bev – the Ev sounds like the ev in Bev), was born on March 29, 1857 to John David Miller and his second wife, Margaret Elizabeth Lentz. Margaret had also been previously married, to Valentine Whitehead III. These families were all Brethren in Elkhart County, Indiana and in Montgomery County, Ohio, where they lived before settling in Elkhart County in the 1830s when land first became available. They had migrated as part of a Brethren group who settled on what was then the frontier.\n\nUnfortunately, we don’t have a sample of the Eva’s mitochondrial DNA, so I’ll be listing her siblings and bolding female relatives whose descendants could potentially provide a sample of DNA inherited maternally from Eva or her matrilineal ancestors. There is a fully paid scholarship for the first person who qualifies.\n\nJohn David Miller and his first wife, Mary Baker, had 11 children, as follows:\n\nMatilda “Tillie” Miller b 1845 married John Dubbs.\n\nSarah Jane Miller married David Blough\n\nAaron B. Miller b 1843 married Sarah E. Myers\n\nHester Miller b 1833 married Jonas Shively\n\nMaryann Miller b 1841 married Michael W. Treesh\n\nMartha Miller b 1847\n\nGeorge Washington Miller b 1851/52 married Lydia Miller\n\nDavid B. Miller b 1838 married Susan Smith\n\nSamuel Miller died before 1893\n\nJohn N. Miller died before 1893\n\nCatherine Miller died before 1893\n\nNone of the above people carry the mitochondrial DNA of Eva Miller. They are her half-siblings through her father. Mary Baker Miller died March 12, 1855 and John David Miller remarried to Margaret Elizabeth Lentz Whitehead a year later on March 30, 1856. Both had children to raise.\n\nMargaret had at least 5 children with Valentine Whitehead III, as follows:\n\nEmanuel Whitehead b 1849 married Elizabeth Ulery\n\nMary Jane Whitehead b 1851 married John D. Ulery\n\nJacob Franklin Whitehead b 1846 married Eva Bowser\n\nLucinda Whitehead b 1842 married Joseph B. Haney\n\nSamuel Whitehead b 1844 married Henrietta, last name unknown\n\nOf the above half-siblings, only the descendants of the women carry their mother’s mitochondrial DNA. Therefore, only descendants through females carry Eva’s mitochondrial DNA. That would be both Mary Jane and Lucinda Whitehead. In the current generation males can test, because females give their mitochondrial DNA to all of their offspring, but only females pass it on.\n\nJohn David Miller and Margaret Elizabeth Lentz had 3 more children of their own.\n\nEvaline Louise Miller b 1857 married Hiram Ferverda\n\nIra J. Miller b 1859 married Rebecca Rodibaugh\n\nPerry Miller b 1862\n\nSince there are no females, none of the above brothers’ descendants carry the mitochondrial DNA of Eva and her mother.\n\nEva’s mother, Margaret Elizabeth Lentz Whitehead Miller (1822-1903) also had siblings. Margaret was born in 1822 in Pennsylvania to Jacob Lentz (1783-1870) and Frederica Moselman (also Musselman) (1788-1863), both born in Germany and both died in Montgomery County, Ohio.\n\nTheir children were:\n\nJacob Franklin Lentz b 1822 married Sophia Schweitzer\n\nGeorge W. Lentz b 1806 married Catherine M. Blessing\n\nJohann Adam Lentz b 1819 married Margaret Whitehead and Elizabeth Neff\n\nBenjamin Lentz b 1826 married Sarah Overlease and Catherine Halderman\n\nFredericka “Fanny” Lentz b 1809 married Daniel Brusman\n\nMary Lentz b 1829 married Henry Overlease\n\nOf the above siblings, only Fredericka’s and Mary’s descendants would carry their mother’s (and Eva’s) mitochondrial DNA, assuming they descend from her through all females to the current generation, where males too can test.\n\nEva married Hiram Ferverda on March 10, 1876 in Goshen, Elkhart County, Indiana. They started their family of eleven children and a few years later, moved to neighboring Kosciusco county and bought a farm. Another decade later, in 1893, they moved to nearby Leesburg where they lived for the rest of their lives.\n\nEva Miller and Hiram Ferverda’s children were:\n\nJohn Whitney (or Whitley) Ferverda b 1882 married Edith Barbara Lore (mother’s parents)\n\nIra Ferverda b 1877 married Ada Frederickson\n\nEdith Ferverda b 1879 married Tom Dye (had daughter)\n\nIrwin G. Ferverda married Jessie Hartman\n\nElizabeth Gertrude Ferverda b 1884 married Louis Hartman (had daughters)\n\nChloe E. Ferverda b 1886 married Rolland Robinson (had daughter)\n\nRay Ferverda b 1891 married Grace Driver\n\nRoscoe Ferverda b 1893 married Effie Ringo and Ruby Mae Teeter\n\nGeorge M. Ferverda b 1895 married Lois Glant and Elizabeth Haas\n\nDonald M. Ferverda b 1899 married Agnes Ruple\n\nMargaret Ferverda b 1902 married Chester Glant (had daughters)\n\nThe women whose names are bolded carry the same mitochondrial DNA as Eva Miller, and all 4 had daughters whose children could well be alive today.\n\nMother said that her Grandmother, Eva Ferverda, always came to stay with her when she was sick. My mother had Rheumatic Fever as a child (which I thought was Romantic Fever when I was a child) and was sick a lot, so she spent a lot of time with her grandmother. Sadly, Mom said that when she was about 15, she was sick when her grandmother passed away and could not attend her funeral.\n\nThis tidbit of information about when Eva died led me to the Allen County Public Library where I found the census and cemetery records, and then to the Goshen/New Paris area to find the cemetery where Eva’s parents were buried on a cold rainy October day in 2002.\n\nI found the Rodibaugh cemetery, and the graves of Eva’s parents, John D. Miller and Margaret Lentz Whitehead Miller, but had to wonder with the overwhelming number of Miller families in the area how I would ever figure out who was who and how they were connected.\n\nOver the next year, I did some online genealogy and searched available records, pretty much to no avail. It seemed that no one else was researching the Elkhart Miller families. Mostly, the families still lived there and knew each other, so no one needed to research – they just asked someone.\n\nThe photo above is from a small family history book published by the Ferverda family. This is the only known picture of Margaret Lentz Whitehead Miller and John David Miller, both seated, with five of their children. Grandma Ferverda is Eva Miller Ferverda.\n\nIn October 2003, I returned to Goshen to the local library. In the Indiana room, I found obituaries and references to this family in various books. Finally, I pieced enough information together to determine that John David Miller’s father, David Miller, came to Elkhart County in the early 1830s, along with his brother John Miller. Their initial winter was spent living in a lean-to type of shelter with a flap for a door, among the Native families, who directed them where to select good land the next spring.\n\nThe house below is where Eva Miller was born, according to deed records. It’s rather unusual in that it’s turned sideways to the present-day road.\n\nThe Ferverda family had a reunion about 1978. At that time, the older family members who had visited the Ferverda homeland in Holland had printed a small book about their discoveries. In that book, some photos were included, thankfully.\n\nThe photo above is labeled “The Old Home Place” in the Ferverda book, so this would either be the farmhouse in Kosciusco County or after they moved to Leesburg. I suspect it’s the Leesburg farm because it’s where they lived the longest, almost 50 years, and last. In Leesburg, they owned a farm a couple miles outside of town and also a house in town where Hiram Ferverda was a banker.\n\nEva maintained her strong religious convictions throughout her life. On the occasion of her husband’s 56th birthday, in the year 1900, Eva wrote him a note which was found in his Bible sometime after his death in 1925. In her handwriting, it says,\n\n“Search the scriptures for in them you shall find eternal life.”\n\nFollowed by:\n\nRemember me when this you see,\n\nWhile traveling o’er life’s troubled sea,\n\nIf death our lives should separate,\n\nI pray we’ll meet at the Golden Gate.\n\nYour wife, Eva.\n\nIndeed, death did separate them, but it would be Hiram that was taken first, in 1925, followed by Eva in 1939, at age 82.\n\nFrom the Silver Lake Record newspaper Dec. 21, 1939, page 1 column 1.:\n\nMother Dies Wednesday\n\nMrs. Louise Evelyn Ferverda, long time resident of the Leesburg community, died Wednesday night at the home of a daughter, Mrs. Robinson, at Leesburg. She had been critically ill for several weeks from heart trouble and hardening of the arteries. The family had been pioneer residents of that locality, she and Mr. Ferverda buying a farm near Leesburg in 1893 and rearing a family of 11 children. Four girls and 5 sons survive, including Roscoe and John of Silver Lake. Funeral services will be held Saturday afternoon at Salem Church, near Leesburg.\n\nOn January 6th, 1940, the Brethren publication, The Gospel Messenger, included the following:\n\nEva Miller Ferverda was born March 29, 1857 in Elkhart County, Indiana and passed away at the home of her daughter, Mrs. Rollo Robinson of Leesburg, Indiana. She was married to Hiram Ferverda. The early part of their married life was spent in Elkhart County. Forty-sever years ago they moved on a farm near Leesburg, Indiana. Brother Ferverda passed away in 1916. Since that time, Sister Ferverda made her home with her children. Brother and Sister Ferverda were charter members of the New Salem church. She was a faithful attendant at all church services whenever she could get there. She is greatly missed by all, especially the senior Bible class and Aid Society. She will be remembered by the Women’s Work organizations of Northern Indiana because of her ability to give readings. She was the faithful mother of seven sons and four daughters. Two sons preceded her in death. She leaves five sons, four daughters, 27 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren. Funeral services were held in the New Salem church by Brethren Manly Deeter and J. J. Kreider. Burial was in the cemetery near by. Written by Dora A. Stout, Milford, Indiana.\n\nNew Salem Brethren Church, above, was founded by 1906, or at least the cemetery was, as there is a wrought iron marker above the gate with that date. Rex Miller, grandson of Eva’s brother, says that when he was a child, he went to the Miller/Ferverda reunions every year on the farm of Don Ferverda who lived about 1/2 mile south of the church near the old home farm.\n\nThis photo of Hiram Ferverda and Eva Miller Ferverda was taken on the farm at Leesburg. John Whitley (or Whitney) Ferverda, mother’s father, is in the back row, second from right. Based on the ages of Hiram and Eva and the military service banner in the window, I would estimate that this picture was taken about 1917-18.\n\nAfter their deaths, Hiram and Eva were both buried in the Salem churchyard just up the road from their farm, at the church they had attended since moving to Leesburg.\n\nMom says that she did not remember her grandfather, or only vaguely, as he died when she was 2 years old. She did remember her grandmother, Eva, vividly and very fondly. Eva came to stay with whomever was sick in the family. Because of Mom’s rheumatic fever, her grandmother, whom she called Mawmaw, came to stay with them often. Eva did not drive so someone had to go and get her and take her where she wanted to go next. She took care of all of her sick grandkids, so she was always busy all winter.\n\nMom said she was too sick to go to Eva’s funeral and she resented her parents greatly for making her stay at home.\n\nIt’s unusual for a woman in this timeframe to speak at all, much less historically, in their own voice, with strong opinions. Most Brethren women were quiet and obedient. Fortunately, for us, Eva wrote a letter or article, of which we have several pages. The final page and a half are missing. However, from her letter, we hear her own voice and understand some of her opinions, which were nigh on radical for a Brethren woman of the time which she wrote them, especially considering her strong faith.\n\nKeep in mind that this open letter about opportunity and college education for women, penned sometime before 1939, is written by the first generation of women in our family who could read and write. Her mother, Margaret Elizabeth Lentz Miller, signed her name with an X. So these statements and views are indeed very powerful and foresightful. It’s also a foreshadowing of many successful women to come in this genealogical line, her descendants, most of whom also pushed the limits of the time in which they lived.\n\nEva’s faith and patience must have been gravely tried, because, of her children, not everyone apparently embraced the pietist faith in quite the same way she did. One of the primary beliefs of the pietists is that violence in any form is wrong. This belief, in time of war, qualified one as a Conscientious Objector. These families had followed, believed and been persecuted for these beliefs for generations. In other words, these beliefs and this religion was a strongly held family value, one for which they were willing to, and did sometimes, sacrifice their lives.\n\nJohn, my grandfather married outside the faith to a Lutheran and their family became Methodist. Eva’s son, Ira, fought in the Spanish American War, for 3 years. Brethren typically do not “take up arms.” Donald, Roscoe and George Ferverda all served in WWI. The 3 star banner in Eva’s window indicates 3 family members serving in the War. Both Irvin and Elizabeth followed the Brethren faith, and other children probably did as well.\n\nThe article written by Eva Miller Ferverda is shown below. I’ve transcribed it to make it easier to read. There is no date, nor do we know why she wrote it nor the intended recipient. For whatever reason, I’m glad she did, because this and the card to her husband are all we have of her voice.\n\nSome Things Our Women Are Doing\n\nWomen in the olden times were in the main appendages of men. They [were] mere servants in some capacity and were not supposed to need any special intellectual training.\n\nThe women of olden time were not educated in the school as they now are, but now in our times, her real worth is more properly estimated, and her education is held of equal importance with man. Education is power, and when rightly used sharpens the mind, it kindles ambition, awakens self respect. The intelligence of woman is rapidly increasing.\n\nWomen are graduating from our colleges, with equal honors with men. This enlarged intelligence of women should vastly increase the intelligence of our homes. Ignorance in the home never will promote its welfare. Ignorance in the mother is never any benefit to her children. Ignorance never made a womans work of any better quality. Ignorance in the women of a neighborhood never promotes the better interests of the neighborhood, the church or Aid So[ciety]. It does promote gossip, scandal, backbiting, jealousy, folly, coarsemess, lone life. Ignorance is on the level with these things and is the mother of them all. But womans day has come and with renewed womanhood and Christian intelligence, are prepared to do a good work wherever their lot shall be, in the home, the church, the S.S [Sisters Society] of Aid.\n\nWe have noted women of old history who had great influence in private and public life. Miriam Sister of Brother Moses aiding much in the deliverance of her people. Deborah who ruled and judged Israel. Hannah noted for her trust in the Lord, being the mother of Samuel. In the time of Christ and the apostles there were many noted women, zealous in their devotion to the new religion, the religion which opened new encouragements and hopes to women, the religion of Jesus Christ which placed women on an equality with men. Paul in Rom 16th speaks of some good women in his day. He commends Phebe our sister who is a servant of the church. Also Priscilla, sister Aqualia and Tryphena, sister Tryfanosa who labored much in the church. We have the Marys and Dorcas and we might name many more noted women.\n\nWomen can do great things. Think once of the crusaders some women of our time. That awakening of moral conviction and spiritual power such as perhaps has not been known since the early days of Christianity. They came on bended knee and tearful eyes and prayed for all the guilty offenders, that they might repent and be forgiven. They lifted the cause to the throne of God and hold it there still. They made it his cause. They joined in with his church. This took the cause of temperance up to the summit level of practical Christian life, and made it what it all along should have been, a high, holy, divine cause. All this some of our good Christian women have done and through their efforts we shall soon have worldwide temperance. What other women have done we can do and our women of today are doing things. Our Sister Aid Society is doing a great work. We have about 16,000 women engaged in the various activities of the Aid Society.\n\nPage 6 missing.\n\n…attend our Aid Society. The Lord gives us health. When we are well we can surely give one day every two weeks for this good work and we know we shall be blessed for every good deed we do. It is the little deeds we do which count for so much for a cup of cold water, given in his name we shall be blessed….\n\nIndeed Eva, women can do great things. You were a wise and prophetic woman. But it is in “the little deeds we do” that most of us will be remembered, what kind of a person were and how we made those around us feel. Eva is remembered as a lovely lady, a kind and loving Grandmother who came to stay and cared for her grandchildren when they were ill.\n\nPage 6 missing.\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nDisclosure\n\nI receive a small contribution when you click on some of the links to vendors in my articles.

Bailey, born sometime between 1901 and 1904 in Ohio, who lived in Battle Creek, Michigan by 1920, daughter of John Bailey and Maude Wable. Then it went one step further and became the search for Leo Thomas Devine, and then Lee Joseph Devine. Yes, that’s the name of Ilo’s infant son and then what he was called as an adult.\n\nYou’re invited…come along…but word of warning…this is a theme park thriller stand-in-line-for-an-hour ride as it unfolds. Except you don’t have to stand in line and you have a front row seat! And, at the end, you get to vote….but I’m not going to reveal the question because it would spoil the story. And what a story it is! Pull up a chair…\n\nMy week #1 ancestor of Amy Johnson Crow’s 52 Ancestors in 52 Weeks challenge was Searching for Ilo’s Son. Wow – what a mind-boggler this has turned out to be. Remember the game Twister? This is a lot the same. I feel like I’ve been living on an emotional roller coaster for the past two weeks.\n\nA short summary is that my father, William Sterling Estes had a child in 1920 with a woman in the Battle Creek/Kalamazoo area of Michigan, near Camp Custer, where he was stationed. I had been unable to find either the woman, Ilo, or the male child, but a letter she left, included in the week #1 article, provided several clues.\n\nMany people left comments and several of the commenters hit pay dirt. I could not have put this puzzle together without all of you. So let me say a very, VERY, big thank you to readers Carole, Laurie, Phyllis, Donna, Jerry, William and librarian in Louisville, Mark Taflinger. I hope I didn’t miss anyone.\n\nThis exercise just goes to show why you should always obtain the actual record, no matter what the abstract or index says, and why you absolutely must think way, far, outside the box – and check even the unlikely.\n\nThis is the third time that viewing an actual record provided critically vital information. You’d think I would have learned.\n\nI had previously found the marriage record between an Ilo Baily and a Don Caroles in Battle Creek and discarded it because my father’s name was William Estes and an Ilo marriage to a Don Caroles seemed irrelevant. It was the only Ilo record in that time and place and I felt that Caroles marriage eliminated that Ilo. As it turns out, that marriage was far from irrelevant.\n\nWilliam Sterling Estes was the son of Ollie Bolton and William George Estes of Claiborne County, Tennessee. Around 1910, the family came north to live in Indiana and in the late 19-teens, Ollie and William George divorced, with Ollie Bolton Estes moving to Chicago and William George Estes moving to Harlan County, Ky. My Dad joined the Army.\n\nOllie Bolton’s mother was Margaret Claxton. Why is this the least bit relevant, you ask? Good question, because I certainly never thought it would be to Ilo Baily and Don Caroles. But, it looks like Don Caroles just might not be who he said he was.\n\nThis is the actual marriage index entry on two pages. I don’t know why it’s marked through, but it is and 2 others are on the same page are as well.\n\nIlo Bailey lists her parents as James I. Bailey and Ollie Bolton, but Ollie Bolton was the mother of William Sterling Estes.\n\nDon Caroles says he was born in New Mexico and his parents are George Caroles and Mary Claxton. Claxton? Ollie Bolton’s mother’s surname??\n\nPerhaps even more important is the note under their marriage record that says “In War Service Against Germany from Clayborn Co., Tenn.” Clayborn is a misspelling of Claiborne which is where the Estes family hailed from.\n\nChecking the 1910 census, there is no Don Caroles nor any Caroles born in New Mexico. Maybe more importantly, there were no Caroles in Claiborne County, Tn., either. My Estes and Bolton families were from Claiborne County, and I have many reference books. There were no Caroles. To be absolutely positive, I checked the Claiborne Pioneer Project too, and nada. There was Carroll, but no Don.\n\nBy now I’m extremely suspicious, so I checked further. The 1920 census showed Ilo and Don Caroles. The census date was Jan. 13, 1920, just a month after their marriage, and there is no baby yet, but they are living with Maud E. Bailey. Maud looks for all the world to be Ilo’s mother. And notice that Ilo’s age has been reduced by 2 years in the month since she got married. Hmmm…usually marriage ages people! Don Caroles’ occupation was “fireman” and then “locomotive” which is what William Sterling Estes did in WWI at Camp Custer.\n\nIlo is living in the same house with Maud Bailey, probably her mother.\n\nWilliam Sterling Estes is not listed in Michigan in the 1920 census, but we know positively that he was stationed at Camp Custer at that time. However, he was also AWOL, from November 1919, before he married Ilo, through April 1920, so maybe this is her family’s attempt to hide him.\n\nLooking back at the 1910 census, we do find Ilo with her family and indeed her mother is Maud and the siblings match.\n\nIlo E. Bailey in the 1910 census was age 6, so born in 1904, and living in Belvidere in Montcalm Co., Michigan. That means in 1919, she was age 15 when she married “Don Caroles.” Her parents were John Bailey and Maude E., although her father had died before the 1920 census. Her grandfather John C. Bailey age 78 also living with them in 1910.\n\nReconstructing her family between the 1900, 1910 and 1920 census, we find the following:\n\nIlo’s father, John Bailey was born in 1865 in Ohio and his father was John C. Bailey born in 1832 in Ohio. Ilo’s father, John, died sometime between the 1910 and 1920 census. Ilo’s mother was Maude E. born in 1881 in Ohio. We discover Maud’s maiden name in two of her children’s death records.\n\nIlo’s sibings:\n\nMartha E. Bailey born in October 1898 in Ohio, died Aug 3, 1913 in Belvidere Twp, Montcalm Co. Mi., father, John Bailey, mother, Maude Wable.\n\nJohn C. Bailey born in 1901 in Ohio.\n\nMervin E. Bailey born in 1907 in Ohio (Ervin born Jan 24, 1907 in Van Wert, Ohio, according to Ohio births,) Mervin Eugene died March 11, 1921 in Belvidere, Michigan, his death record says that Ervin born was Jan. 24, 1906 in Van Wert, Ohio, child of John C. Bailey and Maude Wable.\n\nMay E. Bailey born October 1918 in Michigan.\n\nJohn Bailey married Maude Wable (Or Woble) in Jackson, Jackson Co., Michigan on March 31, 1897 according to Michigan marriage records. According to the 1900 census, John already had 3 daughters from a first marriage.\n\nOk, it surely looks like we have the right Ilo, but where is Ilo in the 1930 census, or, for that matter, anytime after the letter she wrote to William Sterling Estes dated March 22, 1921?\n\nThe 1930 census shows no Don Caroles or any other that look familiar at all. Of 5 Caroles listed nationally, 4 are born in Italy and one in Nebraska.\n\nOnce Again, We’ve Run Aground.\n\nHere’s my working theory in terms of what happened surrounding Ilo Bailey and “Don Caroles’” marriage.\n\nWilliam Sterling Estes was actually either 17 or 18 in 1919 but his military ID would have said that he was 22 or 23, born in 1898. He would not have needed his parents to sign. Ilo, if she was born in 1903 would have been 16 and if born in 1904, 15 when she married in 1919. She was obviously pregnant, I’m guessing at least 3 months, so the child was born sometime after the census in January and probably before June. My sister was born May 22nd that year to another woman. I wonder if he knew my sister’s mother was pregnant when he married Ilo.\n\nWhen applying for a marriage license, Ilo claimed she was 19, but her youthful appearance might have caused some suspicion. Her own mother had a young baby at home herself and was a widow by January 1920, so obviously a woman facing hardships. It would be easy to surmise that she did not want her daughter finding herself in the same kind of situation and might not have been in favor of her marrying so young. I suspect that Ollie Bolton went along with the young couple to get their marriage license and then to get married, and posed as “her” mother, not his. Note that Ilo did not give her correct father’s name either.\n\nI checked Ancestry, Family Search and Rootsweb for Ilo’s family, with no luck. There is one very sketchy record at Ancestry. I did leave the contributor a note but also noticed they had not signed on in over a year. Not a good omen.\n\nI was trying to track Ilo’s siblings forward in time, thinking I might be able to find their obituaries which could lead me to Ilo once again, as an adult, with a married surname…but all I found was two of her siblings death records as young people. Of the two siblings who lived, I was unable to find anything at all about May Bailey, and John C. Bailey was too general.\n\nSo, we’re at a dead end again.\n\nThe Ridiculous and the Sublime\n\nDo ridiculously silly questions sometimes haunt you? If not, l’ll gladly share some of mine!\n\nHere’s a mind-twister that might even stump legal eagle Judy Russell. If you’re Ilo, and you marry “Don Caroles” and have a baby, and then discover that there is “another woman” and “another baby,” and that your marriage is illegal, probably saving you the trouble of getting divorced – what surname do you file under in court? Bailey, Caroles or Estes? And given that, who do you file against, Don Caroles or William Sterling Estes? And what do you file? And what kind of a court do you file in? And what do you ask for, exactly, other than having the scoundrel shot?\n\nWhen the baby is born, what surname do you give your baby? Caroles? If you give the baby the name Caroles, do you then ask for it to be changed when you discover that not only were you illegally married, but not to the man Don Caroles at all? And changed to what, Estes or Bailey? Is the child then legally illegitimate? And assuming all of this is filed, is the entire court record and file now sealed because it involves changing the parentage of a minor, similar to an adoption? In other words, will I ever be able to find this record, wherever it is, whatever it is?\n\nIn Ilo’s letter, she tells William Sterling Estes that “it’s in a lawyer’s hands now” and that she doesn’t need his signature at all. And besides that, even if she did, exactly which signature would he use??? And wouldn’t you think he would get in trouble with the military for getting married under a fake name, I mean, if he wasn’t already in trouble for being AWOL? Wouldn’t you think he would think about these things? Just saying….\n\nAnd if Ilo then went to remarry, or marry, whatever you call it, what surname would she use in that marriage record? The 1920s was a long time before women petitioned to take their maiden name back. In the 1980s, judges were reticent to grant the return to maiden names if children were involved – and that’s 60 light-years later.\n\nOne of the reasons that I ask all of this is that I know the “father” was changed on my sister’s birth record to reflect my father’s name, after her mother married my father in December of 1922. He seemed to like December weddings. My sister’s birth record was then refiled with the later “delayed” or “adopted” records and given that my sister didn’t know about this, she had fits getting her birth certificate because it had been stricken in the original book with no “pointer” to the new entry. A clerk finally found it on a fluke and with her standing there refusing to leave without a birth certificate.\n\nAm I ever going to be able to find out what happened to Ilo’s son? I actually wonder if he died. My sister who was born within months or weeks (or for all we know days) of Ilo’s child was well known to the family, even if her mother and her mother’s family “didn’t care for” my father, to put it mildly. So if Ilo’s child died, what surname would his death record have reflected?\n\nI may never figure this out, but still, I want to know…\n\nWho was that child?\n\nWhat was his name? No child should be remembered namelessly. Even my babies who died all have names.\n\nDid he live or die? Is my brother alive? Did he have children?\n\nIf he died, when, and how?\n\nAnd oh, just one more crazy twisted question. If you were William Sterling Estes, and you had two women pregnant at the same time in the same town, due, it seems, about the same month…wouldn’t you worry that they might meet each other? Like at the doctor’s office…or worse yet, wind up being roommates giving birth???\n\nWait a minute! Maybe that’s what happened. He was AWOL from November 1919 through April 1920 when he was arrested. Arrested? Maybe he turned himself in….maybe it seemed like the safer choice. Oh what a tangled web we weave…..\n\nIlo’s Son\n\nJust as I was ready to call this a draw, again, for about the 100th time in the 36 years I’ve been searching for my brother…another reader sent me a vital piece of information. Ilo Esther Bailey remarried in Ohio using her maiden name. And yes, it’s the same Ilo because she gave her parents names. And for once, the names all match.\n\nOn June 9, 1928, Ilo Esther Baily, born in Van Wert, Ohio to John Bailey and Maude Wable married Thomas Devine, son of Mathew Devine and Elizabeth Hawkins. They both listed their marital status as “single” and they were married in Bowling Green, Wood County, Ohio, just south of Toledo.\n\nThe image of the actual application shows that they weren’t just single, but that they both state they have never been married before.\n\nThe 1930 census, just two years later shows this couple with several children, including one named Leo Jr, age 10, so born in 1920, in Michigan. They were living in Lucas County, where Toledo is located. Ilo is listed as age 27, so born in 1903.\n\nChildren listed were:\n\nLeo Jr. – 10 – born in Michigan\n\nMatthew T. – 8 – born in Ohio\n\nRobert J. – 6 – born in Ohio\n\nWilliam E. – 3/12th – so born in January of 1930\n\nLeo would have been the son of William Sterling Estes. How then could he be Leo Jr.? Did she rename the child after her second husband? This doesn’t make sense, but then nothing about this entire situation makes sense.\n\nAbout this time, I recalled what my crazy aunts had told me. That my father was married about 1920 or so to a Laila LaFountain and they had a son Lee, who eventually took his step-father’s name of “Levi or Levy or something like that.” Lee wound up in Louisville, Ky studying the ministry in a seminary “or something,” they recalled. All this time, I thought Laila LaFountain was a different person, if she and Lee even existed at all. Remember, they were the crazy aunts:)\n\nBy 1933, Ilo was in Louisville, Ky., with husband L. Thomas, as listed in the Louisville, Kentucky City Directory. L. Thomas Devine is listed with Ilo E., r rear 911 Washington in 1933 and in 1934 Leo T. Devine with Ilo is listed at 1056 Washington.\n\nBy 1939, Mrs. Ilo E. Devine is listed by herself at 1005 E. Main.\n\nAnother reader found ILA (sic); Leo, Jr., student; and Matthew, living at 412 E. Grey in Louisville, in the 1940 city directory. Ilo is listed as widow of Thomas. There is a Thomas listed in 1940, who is a Laborer at Cavehill Cemetery. There is also a William, but there is no way to know if he is Ilo’s son.\n\nThe family is missing in the 1940 census. In 1940, Ilo’s children would have been:\n\nLeo – 20\n\nMatthew – 18\n\nRobert – 16\n\nWilliam – 10\n\nAccording to the Ohio birth registry, another child, James J. Devine was born Oct. 24, 1923. Would this be Robert James Devine who died in 1975? The answer is in Robert’s death certificate and obituary.\n\nAnd I have to ask…why does this family continue to change their names??? Leo Thomas Jr. became Lee Joseph., James J. became Robert James and William E. became William Douglas???\n\nIn 1942, Matthew T. and Robert J. are living at 829 Washington Street. There is also a Thomas.\n\nWe know that at least Robert James was alive beyond 1942, because he died in Fort Worth, Texas on July 7, 1975. His mother is listed as Ilo Esther Bailey and his father as Leo Thomas Devine.\n\nI ordered Robert’s obituary from the Fort Worth Library. It did not list his parents, but did list his siblings.\n\nSo we now know that in 1975, Lee, Matthew and William were all still living in Louisville.\n\nAccording to the birth index, Matthew T. was born January 15, 1922 in Lucas County, Ohio to Ilo and Leo. This means that this child was conceived in April 1921, approximately 1 month after Ilo wrote the letter to William Sterling Estes. Perhaps this relationship with Leo Devine, is what Ilo was referring to in her letter when she stated that William, upon his return to Battle Creek, would hear “quite a bit about me.” If indeed she did return to Michigan in June as she indicated was planned, she was then pregnant with her second child. It’s interesting that the location from where she wrote the letter to William was Louisville, where she and Leo Devine ultimately wound up living. Maybe Leo is the “very fine people who are wealthy and willing to take care of baby and I.”\n\nIf Leo, or Lee, the child, was raised as part of the Leo Devine family, he may never have known that he was not Leo Devine’s biological child. But was Lee Devine the biological son of Leo Devine? As it turns out, Leo Devine was living with his brother Douglas in Battle Creek, Michigan in 1920, per the census, and it appears that Douglas was working at the Army Base.\n\nOne thing is for sure, Matthew Devine was positively not the child of William Sterling Estes, because he was in the Leavenworth Disciplinary Barracks, in Kansas, at the time Matthew was conceived.\n\nMatthew Devine died August 19, 1997 and his obituary is as follows:\n\nMatthew Thomas Devine, 75, died Sunday at Caritas Medical Center. He was a retired employee of the old International Harvester Co., an Army veteran of World War II and a member of Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 1181.\n\nSurvivors: his wife, the former Norma J. Taylor; sons David and James Harbin; daughters Mary Scott and Esther Choi; a brother, William Devine; six grandchildren; and a great-grandchild.\n\nFuneral: 1 p.m. Tuesday, Resthaven, 4400 Bardstown Road. Burial: Resthaven Memorial. Visitation: 2-9 p.m. Monday.\n\nFrom the Ohio Birth Index – William Douglas Devine was born December 31, 1929 son of Leo & Ilo. His birth date in the SSDI (Social Security Death Index) matches this date.\n\nHere is his obituary From findagrave.\n\nDevine, William Douglas, 77, of Louisville, passed away on Tuesday, March 27, 2007, at Jewish Hospital. Mr. Devine was a retired captain on the Louisville Fire Department, a member of the Fire Fighter’s Union, Retired Fire Fighters, honorary member of the 10th. Mountain Division, and Guardian Angels Catholic Church. He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Mary Lee Devine; a daughter, Dusty Callahan-Hardin (Tim); and two grandchildren, Ryan and Caitlin Callahan. Funeral Mass will be 10 a.m. Saturday at Guardian Angels Catholic Church, 6000 Preston Highway. Burial will follow in Resthaven Memorial Park. Visitation will be 2-8 p.m. Friday and after 8:30 a.m. Saturday at Arch L. Heady at Resthaven, 4400 Bardstown Rd. Expressions to Guardian Angels Catholic Church. Published in The Courier-Journal on 3/29/2007.\n\nUnfortunately, this obituary doesn’t say anything about his brother, Lee.\n\nWhere is Leo Thomas Devine?\n\nIn 1939 and 1940, we find a Lee Joseph Devine attending the University of Louisville in the Liberal Arts program.\n\nIn the 1956 City Directory, we find Lee J. Devine with wife Ruth who works for the Pan Am Service Station. Then we find Matthew T. Devine who works in the same place. That seems just too much of a coincidence and connects Matthew T. with Lee J. who is married to wife Ruth. To me, this removes most of the doubt as to whether or not Lee. J. Devine is the same person as Leo T. Devine. Having said that, this family “ball of string” has thrown me so many loops and blindsided me so many times that I’m very hesitant to conclude anything without definitive proof. It seems that no one behaves or plays by the rules, or even keeps their names!\n\nBy the 1960 directory, we find Lee J. Devine who is now a vice president of Thurston Cook Mercury.\n\nIn 1989, we find the death record for Lee J. Devine, also listed as Leo Devine in at least one death record index. He was born February 24, 1920, obtained his SS number in Louisville prior to 1951 and died in St. Petersburg, Pinellas County, FL on January 21, 1989. He had a death record both there and in Louisville and was buried in Howe Valley, Hardin Co., KY. Hardin County borders Jefferson County where Louisville is located.\n\nPhoto taken in January, 2012….and Ruth isn’t buried at that time.\n\nThis particular Lee Devine married Cordelia Ruth Lyon on June 26, 1943. But, is this Lee Devine the son of Ilo Esther Bailey or is this a different Lee Devine?\n\nWhen in doubt, call the library. I learned this years and years ago, and once again, it didn’t fail me. Mark Taflinger, the Data Desk Manager provided me with Lee’s obituary which clearly links him with brothers William and Matthew.\n\nLee J. Devine, 68, died Saturday in St. Petersburg, Fla.\n\nHe was a retired president and administrator of St. Matthews Manor and Mount Holly Convalescent Centers, a former president of the Kiwanis Club of Louisville and the Executive Club, and a member of the Pendennis Club, Boys and Girls Council of the Salvation Army, English Speaking Union, Stephensburg Masonic Lodge, Scottish Rite and Kosair Shrine Temple.\n\nSurvivors: his wife, the former Ruth Lyon; and two brothers, Matthew T. and William D. Devine.\n\nFuneral: 10 a.m. Wednesday, Christ United Methodist Church, 4614 Brownsboro Road, with burial in Howe Valley Cemetery in Cecilia. Visitation at Pearson’s, 149 Breckinridge Lane, from 1 to 9 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nBut there is one more thing….he had no children. So I don’t have any nieces and nephews, and there is no one to do DNA testing to prove, or disprove, that Lee was my brother.\n\nFrom Lee’s obituary, I would have been proud to know this man. It certainly looks like he made a very positive difference in the world. Ilo, your son would have made you proud. I’m just so sorry that I never got the chance to meet him. But now I know. I no longer have to wonder. There will be no mysteriously appearing sibling DNA match, at least not from him. I can stop waiting.\n\nSo, now I must pause to reflect. It has been an extremely long couple of weeks.\n\nIs Lee Devine My Biological Brother?\n\nIs this man my brother? I’m sure you’ll understand my need to ask after discovering that my brother Dave was not. Added to this doubt, in this case, is the fact that Leo Devine was also in Battle Creek in the 1920 census and that Ilo named the child, according to the 1930 census, Leo Thomas Jr. – although his name would somehow evolve over time to Lee Joseph.\n\nI’m sure that this Lee Devine is the man that is supposed to be my brother. We have finally walked, crawled and then sprinted to the end of that trail. But was he really my brother? The only resource left now is photos and once again, Mark, from the Louisville library came through for me. Libraries have clipping files. This photo of Lee Devine is from March 2, 1955. It’s the only photo in his file.\n\nI have no photos of my father from the time of his military service until about 1950 or so.\n\nHere is a photo of my father I’d guess about 1945 or 1950. And no, I have no idea who the child is…which leads to more questions, that, unless someone recognizes this photo, will forever be unanswered. It was labeled as “one of his girlfriend’s children” by my brother Dave’s mother, so it’s not Dave.\n\nMy father about 1950, so about 13 years older than Lee was in the photo taken in 1955.\n\nHere, above and below, are photos of my father in the military around 1918, so about age 15.\n\nHere’s William Sterling Estes about 1960 with my step-mother, Virgie.\n\nHere is a photo of my genetically proven sister, the one born in 1920 just three months after Lee, taken about 1955.\n\nHere’s my proven sister at about age 60.\n\nHere is a photo of me taken when I was about 5 years older than Lee was in the photo in 1955.\n\nThere are a few more family photos in the “Crazy Aunts” story. I personally think Lee resembled my father’s brother, Joseph, shown in the family photo in that article, and below.\n\nThis is the end of the story. We’re done. Case solved, thanks to many contributing people. It stops here because there are no children to DNA test. There can be no final chapter, so to speak, no definitive conclusion.\n\nFeelings and Coping\n\nI feel that it’s only appropriate to add a quick note about how I feel about this. These have been an extremely emotion-filled few days. I have chosen to share not only this experience in total, step by step, but also how I feel about it, for two reasons.\n\nFirst, many others will go through this same process. I didn’t quite expect to go through it publicly, but that is how it started with the Ilo story and I felt obliged to share with you “the rest of the story,” especially given that so many of you contributed the key pieces of the puzzle. It would not have been solved without the reader contributions.\n\nThe resolution of this type of search within a few days is actually very unusual. Often there are weeks or months between pieces of information and you can deal with each one as they arrive. For me, this process has been extremely compressed these past few days due to the newly available online records such as the Ohio birth, death and marriage indexes. This process and the emotional roller-coaster attached to each new piece of data feels quite lonely and the emotions are extremely raw, especially if you’re searching for the family you don’t have. These journeys by virtue of what they are often isolated and alone. Other than giving birth or burying a family member, these types of searches are one of the most personal journeys you can embark upon. They will change your life forever, the journey itself, if not the outcome.\n\nFor many, especially adoptees, there is a sense of desperation that defines these searches. The clock is always working against you in the sense of finding the person alive, and working for you in terms of new records becoming available that may help your search. Your feelings are always a conflicted hodgepodge of hope and fear, often wildly swinging between the two. Fear of what you will find, what you won’t find, that you’ll find nothing, or that it will be too late.\n\nSecond, I’ve shared to help those who never experience this understand the process for those of us who have. Almost all of us will know someone who goes through this. Many people experience this over and over trying to find parents and then siblings, having no idea what awaits them….what they will find…if anything. It never becomes easy or even easier, especially after a few choice rejections and setbacks. Many times, each one becomes more difficult. The end of these stories aren’t always happy endings in the classic sense of a tearful, joyful reunion. Trust me – there is another sister I haven’t told you about.\n\nAnyone who searches for a sibling or parent or child knows that the entire search, for however long it takes, often decades, is fueled by hope. Some hope for a joyful reunion, for love. Some just want closure. Some want to know what that person was or is like. Many want to find some commonality. Some of us are almost afraid to hope. Given the dysfunctional state of my father’s life and his history of drinking, I had no idea what to expect in his child. Lee was a pleasant surprise.\n\nI clearly knew that it was extremely unlikely that I could ever find this brother, and by this time, more than 90 years after his birth, if I did, he would likely be deceased. I’m far more surprised that I’ve actually found him than I am that he has passed over.\n\nI was extremely blessed to have found my sister Edna in 1978 and my brother Dave in the early 2000s. I had a few years with both of them before they passed – years I would not trade for anything. I think we loved each other more intensely and gratefully to make up for the years we didn’t have. My sister and I were so very much alike in uncanny ways. I was utterly devastated at her passing – given and so unexpectedly wrenched away again just a dozen years later. It was many years before I stopped picking up the phone on Sunday afternoons to call her. The second anniversary of Dave’s passing is next week. And so – another brother lost, and found, and lost again.\n\nWhen we obtain closure, it allows us to move on, in our own way, in our own time. In the meantime, we grieve what wasn’t, what might have been, what we hoped would be and never happened. Sometimes, depending on the circumstances, we grieve what was.\n\nThis discovery, as glad and extremely grateful as I am to have made it, is, in it’s own way, a death. It’s finally over. The door has shut, as gently as possible, but it is closed, latched, and he is on the other side…and although I’ve found him, given the murky circumstances, I still don’t"
