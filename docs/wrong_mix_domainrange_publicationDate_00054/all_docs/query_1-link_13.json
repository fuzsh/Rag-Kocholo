        "text": "Like last year, I read a lot of books; and last year’s exercise in recapping the most blog-adjacent was fun so I thought I’d do it again. (Plus, it’s very easy content to write between Christmas and New Year…) So click the link above if you want to know a bit about rules and criteria.\n\nAppropriately for a year which has not been a particularly good one, it felt like this year was much less interesting and fun, reading-wise, than 2022. I actually crunched some numbers on this (‘cause I’m that cool) using my Goodreads account, and it wasn’t quite as bad as I’d feared; but the numbers were revealing. I gave many fewer books 5 stars, and of the ones I did only one (Radiance by Catherynne M. Valente) was a book I hadn’t read before. Even that one was really a 4.5 stars pushed upwards by the book’s ambition. In general, if Goodreads let you give half-stars, I think the disparity would be a lot more apparent – there were a lot of basically 3.5-star reads I ended up pushing into the 4-star category. What this means is that my non-work reading felt a lot less inspirational this year than last year. During my time unemployed this year, I have been doing a lot less work reading than I did in 2022 in order to do a lot more writing in the hope that increasing my publication list will help land a job. Hopefully next year will see an improvement, but for now, this list is going to be shorter than last year’s. Onwards!\n\nOne thing I mentioned a couple of weeks ago is that I’ve been reading a lot of Penguin Classics. Mostly, they’re not that remarkable (although on re-reading Bram Stoker’s Dracula for the first time in years what I’d apparently forgotten is that the opening is noticeably better than the rest of the book). My favourite, for the record, was the Chu Ci, but the one which really made me think was:\n\nHesiod, Works and Days\n\nThis illustrates a point about both translation, and potentially about modern English-language poetry (unless I’m a weirdo). We’ve noted in the past that poetry is very difficult to translate into other languages, and on the few occasions I’ve had to do it I’ve just done it as prose. This is very much the coward’s option; but this translation of Hesiod’s combination hectoring/agricultural calendar illustrates why the coward’s option might still be best. The amount of skill both as translator and as poet it takes to transfer Greek verse into rhyming English verse is incredible. The problem is that – to me, at least – rhyming English verse sounds contrived and goofy. I’ve been very slowly reading the poems of Coleridge, and whilst I appreciate the technique that goes into fitting words to form as carefully as Coleridge does in his earlier poems, the palpable artificiality of it counteracts his emotional and didactic points – I engage less with the whole whilst looking at the individual parts. It’s not that free verse is actually less artificial, of course; but it wears it on its sleeve less. The other thing is that in modern non-oral English-language poetry, I encounter rhyme most often in the context of advertising jingles, or humorous limericks, and so that’s now my main association. As a consequence, this version of Hesiod sounds rather less like one of the foremost poets of all time and rather more like the old man from Nantucket.\n\nMichael Psellus, Chronographia\n\nEnjoyably gossipy, but Psellus is such an egomaniac.\n\nSticking with the Roman Empire, I read a couple of interesting works on that theme as well:\n\nPeter Sarris, Empires of Faith\n\nI will confess for having a real soft spot for Peter Sarris, quite apart from his scholarship, because I have fond memories of being taught by him at undergraduate. This is actually relevant to Empires of Faith because he makes an argument in this book which I remember him making in our supervisions back in 2010. It has to do with the early Islamic conquests, and goes as follows: one important reason for the success of the armies is that the zeal of the new faith meant that its leaders could rely on their armies having stronger morale, versus the weakened and exhausted Byzantine and Persian forces. Having at the time recently finished a very Timothy Blanning-heavy paper on the French Revolution, my mind immediately leapt to Blanning’s counter to similar arguments made by eighteenth-century scholars: revolutionary zeal, Blanning said, was all very well and good, but if you look at which battles the early Revolutionary armies won, it’s because their conscription and logistics allowed them to massively outnumber their enemies. I was therefore sceptical that the Islamic armies could in fact draw on that much more zeal than their opponents, rather than being able to more successfully use desert mobility to concentrate their forces against their enemies. Since then, a couple more thoughts on this matter have occurred to me. One is that the Byzantines take a bit longer to push over than the Sassanids do, and one wonders how far that is because the Byzantines have a counter-advantage in terms of mobility which the Persians don’t, i.e. their ability to move things around by ship. The second is how we’d know about Muslim zeal – the Arabic sources we have are much later and look back on the Conquest period as a Golden Age. I don’t know if we would expect them to go ‘the Christians and fire-worshippers were obviously just as devoted to their cause as we were to ours, but we had two dudes to their one and you can guess the rest!’ (For the record, I went back and had a quick check as to what sources Sarris cites and both relevant footnotes amount to ‘pers. comm.’.) It’s quite possible that he’s written on this in more detail elsewhere and I haven’t read it, and obviously I’m not a professor of Byzantine History with tremendous expertise in the primary sources; but prima facie I don’t think my undergraduate scepticism has been assuaged.\n\nMichael Kulikowski, Imperial Tragedy\n\nThis may be one of the best books on Late Antique history I’ve ever read. The only reason it isn’t the best one is because it needed more at the front end. The key argument is that the break-up of the Roman Empire in the West ultimately comes down to the fracturing of its elite into different geographical blocs, and I don’t think Kulikowski fully establishes this in the book itself. It has to be said that, 1) this is a sequel to Imperial Triumph, which I haven’t read; and 2) is a public-facing work of scholarship so it’s light on apparatus, which might have fleshed this out. Still, it’s a bit of a shame that the book misses out on being my first go-to for the subject by a hair.\n\nFurther afield than Rome, we come to\n\nJohn Romer, A History of Ancient Egypt, vol. 3\n\nI really liked the first book in this series, and I thought the second was also pretty darn good. By this point, though, his schtick is losing its force. That schtick can be summed up as ‘early Egyptology came out of an Ancien régime which encouraged its formative practitioners to see the social and political structures of the Early Modern state in what were actually very archaic societies where those terms don’t apply’. This applies to concepts as basic as ‘politics’ or ‘warfare’. I’m not 100% on board with this argument actually being true when applied to the Old or Middle Kingdoms, but after encountering several people doing exactly what Romer describes – notably Bob Brier’s Great Courses entry on the history of Egypt – I was at least sympathetic to it. By the New Kingdom, though, when the sources multiply, this becomes unrealistically static. You can argue what you want about this or that later dynasty of the New Kingdom, but at some point you have to accept that something has changed: at some point, Egypt was no longer an archaic state. The obvious analogy to me is the ‘Feudal Revolution’: I am as much a proponent of Carolingian continuity as anyone, but the fact is that by the twelfth century nowhere in particular is evidently ‘Carolingian’ unless you’re putting enough qualifiers on ‘Carolingian’ as to render the term completely meaningless. Continuity is one thing; stasis is quite another.\n\nSpeaking of the Carolingians:\n\nStuart Airlie, Making and Unmaking the Carolingians\n\nOne of the elements of Carolingian scholarship of which I have always been sceptical is the concept of ‘dynasticism’ – that the Carolingian dynasty was considered special per se. I think that once you take away the fact that kings’ sons are considered special, the evidence points towards the idea of a stirps regia being something that the early and high Carolingian rulers would have *liked* to propagate but which never saw that much take-up. (To illustrate what I mean by ‘kings’ sons’ vs ‘dynasties’, consider the case of Louis the Blind: he’s not part of the Carolingian dynasty, but he is the son of a king, albeit a dodgy one, so he gets a complete pass as the real deal.) Having read Airlie’s book, I’m now willing to accept that the concept of a special royal dynasty had more purchase than I’d previously allowed, but still think the case is overall overstated. I wish he’d spent a bit more time talking about explicitly anti-dynastic ideas, like Hincmar’s theoretical rejection of hereditary succession in the De divortio.\n\nElsewhere in the world of medieval history:\n\nThe Origins of the German Principalities, ed. Graham Loud & Jochen Schenk\n\nOne of the basic, frustrating, questions of my academic research from the very beginning has been about distinguishing ‘principalities’ from ‘not-principalities’. Sure, some scholars – Charles West and Florian Mazel spring to mind – might argue that ‘principality’ is a basically meaningless term and that so-called princes are qualitatively the same as any other aristocrat. To me, this seems to be going too far – I’m not happy with a refusal to distinguish between, say, the duke of Normandy on one hand and, like, the lords of Sablé on the other – but articulating what that distinction is has always been my primary challenge. With this book, I was hoping that a comparative perspective would help. Unfortunately, no. The development of a defined princely ‘class’ under Frederick Barbarossa frees the contributors from worrying out their terms, so they’re quite happy treating, say, the city of Nuremburg, the diocese of Eichstätt, and the Zähringer dynasty as inherently comparable phenomena. Quite apart from my personal research needs, this does have the effect of also making the book a little bit incoherent. That’s not to say it’s bad – it’s not, and if you’re looking for a collection on just ‘power in central medieval Germany’ you could do a heck of a lot worse – but it’s not quite what was advertised.\n\nOn quite another note:\n\nChristopher Gidlow, The Reign of Arthur\n\nI went on a bit of a King Arthur kick last May. I’d still say that Guy Halsall’s Worlds of Arthur would be my recommendation to anyone who wanted one book on the subject, but Halsall recommends Gidlow as the one more-or-less respectable version of ‘no, really, he’s historical!’. When it comes to Arthur, like Mulder, I want to believe; and I’m also happy with ‘no smoke without fire’ arguments*, so I was a willing audience for this. Gidlow’s work on the Early Medieval material is in fact pretty respectable, even if not convincing in every detail. He then takes it way too far and tries to show historical bases for the Central Medieval stuff, which involves some wild methodological shenanigans. It’s all good fun, but the latter part is not historical.\n\n*For my money, one of the strongest bits of evidence for some kind of historical Arthur is the appearance of several figures at the end of the sixth century bearing that unusual name, as though they were all named after someone of that name who had been important in the previous generation or two.\n\nFinally, some fiction:\n\nNicola Griffith, Hild\n\nThis was strongly recommended to me by a colleague, and for the first two-thirds or so I was on board with it being superb. By the end, the shine had worn off a tiny bit (although don’t get me wrong, it’s still very good and I recommend it). The problem is perhaps that the author got a bit too into the research. The movement from royal centre to royal centre for this-and-that feast structures much of the novel, and by the end it gets repetitive. Plus, the fact that Hild’s main estate centre is in Meanwood, which is now a suburb of Leeds, is very funny to me: I can’t help thinking ‘oh, she’s ordered palisades built by the river, so that’s I guess where the Waitrose is?’ and then you end up imaging a threat from raiders fighting outside the Boot and Rally…\n\nJean d’Ormesson, The Glory of the Empire\n\nSecond attempt at reading this, first time I managed to finish it. It’s a history of a fictional empire, and d’Ormesson had clearly read a lot of old-fashioned work on the Byzantine Empire. The introduction, written by someone else, promises that it’s more than ‘a jeu de lycéen: the clever joke of a high-school whiz kid’, and it is absolutely not more than that. The work’s understanding of historical causation is shallow, and explicitly Great Man-orientated. This is a problem for it as fiction: unlike, say, Olaf Stapledon’s Last and First Men, the society is not painted imaginatively so one is forced to look to the characters. The characters, though, have no real inner life. The narrator frequently tells us they have inner life, but it’s so filtered through smug references to the way that inner life was (fictionally) portrayed by later artists that it does not engage. The reason I mention this book, though, is to contrast it with:\n\nAngélica Gorodischer, Kalpa Imperial\n\nThe society here is also underwritten, but it doesn’t need to be fleshed out: this is a series of vignettes, and the author is really, really good at making the one or two nails you need to hang a short story on. Turns out, if you want to write engaging fiction about empires, Borges is a better model than Gibbon.\n\nNormally on the blog we try to pitch our posts to a reasonably broad audience. We want what we write to be interesting and useful to people inside and outside the academy. Whether we always succeed in this ecumenical ambition may be open to question, but at least that’s the general idea. This post is a little bit different, as it’s primarily targeted at postgraduate students and post-doctoral researchers in medieval studies who are contemplating attending Leeds International Medieval Congress for the first time. As a result, it’s more inside baseball than we generally aim for. That said, I hope that what follows is interesting for readers who don’t fall into that category, and I would particularly invite people who have attended the IMC in the past to comment with thoughts, comments and ringing denunciations of my suggestions, qualifications, moral character, and personal hygiene.\n\nWhat is Leeds International Medieval Congress?\n\nLeeds IMC is the second-largest annual conference in medieval studies (the largest being the International Congress on Medieval Studies held in Kalamazoo.) In the first week of July several thousand medieval scholars take over the centre of the University of Leeds for four days of papers, book launches, wine receptions and sundry other shenanigans. It is reportedly the largest annual academic conference in Europe. Last year over 2,400 people attended and over 1,800 papers were delivered, and that was a down year because of understandable covid-related concerns. Although the dominant discipline represented is History, you will find papers on Literature, Archaeology, Musicology and a bewildering array of other medieval subjects, ranging from late antiquity to the beginning of the early modern period, with a healthy dollop of medievalism and medieval reception as well. Participants come from all over the world, although there is a strong skew towards Europe and the United States.\n\nShould I go to Leeds IMC?\n\nI love the IMC. It’s medievalist summer camp and I have attended 7 of the last 8. That said, the answer to that question is maybe and depends on your answer to the following two questions.\n\n1. Will someone pay for you to go?\n\nLeeds IMC is not cheap. This year, full registration costs £266, while concessionary registration (which students qualify for) goes for a mere £145. Add in travel costs, accommodation and food, and you’re looking at a serious financial investment. The IMC does offer bursaries for those in need, but they are extremely competitive. See if you can get money from your institution to go.\n\n2. Are you giving a paper?\n\nHere I break with conventional wisdom, which says that going to your first IMC without giving a paper is a good way of dipping your toe in and getting a feel for the event. I disagree. First, it is much easier to get funding bodies to cover your expenses if you’re giving a paper. Second, giving a paper provides you with a clear task which you have successfully performed before and which is largely in your power to carry out. This helps concentrate the mind and mitigates the more stressful aspects of a major conference. Third, it will help you meet the people you want to meet by putting your name and research interests in the programme, giving them an opportunity to see you in action. Fourth, ‘what timeslot have they given you?’ is the easiest conversational icebreaker at Leeds, a chance to bond in shared commiserations or congratulations.\n\nHow do I give a paper at Leeds IMC?\n\nThis is the hard part. Generally, you want to start thinking about this a year before the next IMC. The deadline for submitting panels for Leeds IMC 2024 is 30th September 2023 whereas the deadline for submitting an individual paper is 31st August 2023 (we’ll talk about the difference below.) In around May, the organising committee will announce the theme of the IMC for the next calendar year. While you certainly don’t have to give a paper on that theme, it won’t hurt your chances of being selected, so it may be worth thinking about the topic as a springboard. But don’t be too discouraged if no obvious connection emerges. The majority of papers won’t directly connect to the theme.\n\nBecause of the scale of the IMC, people normally organise and submit panels of papers. Each panel normally consists of 3-4 speakers and you can submit 1-4 panels, although they all have to be linked as part of the same set. Your panels are much more likely to be selected if they include a range of scholars from different institutions, countries, and career stages. Alternatively, you can submit an individual paper directly to the organising committee.\n\nBoth of these routes are fine, but if you can, try to get on a pre-organised panel. If you successfully submit an individual paper, you will be placed on a panel with other people who did likewise. The organising committee will try to make sure these papers are thematically linked, but they can’t work miracles and the results can be somewhat miscellaneous in nature. This can have an impact on your audience, who, faced with choosing between 30 panels running at the same time, may prefer to go to a panel that more consistently speaks to their interests. There’s also a certain risk aversion in play. Being part of an organised panel acts as a vote of confidence, indicating that other academics valued you enough to involve you in their work and stake their reputation on your performance. (This does unfairly penalise people with smaller networks, often junior scholars from small departments or from countries that haven’t traditionally sent people to Leeds.) That said, it is by no means a disaster to give a paper as an individual submission, and it is well worth doing.\n\nA great deal of luck goes into joining your first participant organised panel. In an ideal world, you’ll be invited to participate by the organisers. In practice, you may have to be more proactive. Ask your supervisor or mentor if they have any leads, as well as around your department more generally. Panel organisers often advertise on medievalist Facebook groups, or on Twitter. Keep in touch with people you meet at other conferences. It is far from easy so don’t be discouraged if the right constellation of events fails to come together.\n\nFinally, my instinct is that organising your own panels for your first Leeds may be a step too far. It’s hard work and a lot easier to do once you’ve seen what it looks like.\n\nLogistics\n\nOne thing to bear in mind right at the start is that while Leeds is a decent sized city of about 800,000 inhabitants, several thousand medievalists descending on it for a week will have a noticeable impact on transport and accommodation.\n\nTransport will obviously differ based on where you’re coming from. The closest airport is Leeds-Bradford. I personally favour flying into Manchester and taking the pleasant train ride over the Pennines.\n\n[Ed.: My preference is actually to fly into London and get a train from King’s Cross. I’m less enamoured of the Trans-Pennine Express than Sam is – I find it slow (only about an hour faster to get to Leeds than the London equivalent), frequently crowded, and much less reliable than the LNER service from London – and often the extra cost of the train from King’s Cross is offset by the price of flying to Manchester rather than London. Also, book well in advance for lower prices, and consider if getting a railcard is worth it.]\n\nLeeds train station to the university campus is walkable and I normally take advantage of the opportunity to admire the grand Victorian architecture, but it is about a mile uphill and I am weird. The chances are that the station will be full of people making their way to the IMC, so splitting a cab can be a viable option.\n\n[Ed.: there’s currently long-term road works in Leeds city centre and the one-way system is a nightmare, so a) don’t bother with a car; but also b) although the buses can’t be caught from outside the station, they are fairly close by.]\n\nIn my experience getting away from Leeds is a lot more stressful than arriving. People tend to trickle in in the days leading up to the IMC, but leave on the last day of papers (Thursday), sometimes missing the last session. As a result, trains tend to get filled up by exhausted people with too much luggage. It only takes one cancelled train (and there’s usually at least one) to have a ripple effect down the line. Likewise, although I’ve never tried it, the reports I’ve heard about Leeds-Bradford in the aftermath of the IMC have not been promising. If you don’t live in the UK, it might be worth taking a couple of days holiday to explore the country and avoid the immediate exodus.\n\nWhen you register for the conference, you will be offered the opportunity to book accommodation on campus. I would strongly recommend this, but do it quickly because it fills up fast. Staying on campus gives you more of a rest in the morning if you’ve been up late networking in the bar. It also provides you with a convenient base during the day, where you can deposit things, or take a nap if things are getting a little overwhelming. Finally, it also comes with a hearty English breakfast that, combined with the cheery smiles and buoyant mood coming from one’s fellow medievalists, will surely set you up for the day to come.\n\nYou can also pre book lunch and dinner. I generally don’t because I prefer having the freedom to continue conversations begun in the sessions or to meet up with friends. In addition to the main canteen, there’s a number of food places and a mini-supermarket in the depths of the central building that makes grabbing a quick lunch pretty easy. For dinner, there are a couple of bars in the complex serving standard British pub fare. Leeds also has a large number of restaurants if you would like to escape campus.\n\n[Ed.: and please do try to escape campus! Getting medievalists out of the campus can be like pulling teeth, but the food and drink options are cheaper and better in the town centre!]\n\nThe conference\n\nThe sheer scale of Leeds IMC can be a little overwhelming at first. The programme should be available online ahead of the conference. I would advise going through it in advance to get a rough sense of what looks interesting (I myself may or may not put together a spreadsheet…). When you arrive, you should be issued with a list of updates. This will include details of any papers that have been withdrawn or last-minute substitutions.\n\nGenerally, I would advise choosing which to panels go to based on how interesting they sound to you, rather than whether you feel you have to (this obviously does not apply to the panel on which you’re speaking). This is your best opportunity all year to learn something new and broaden your horizons. Given the sheer number of papers and panels you’re also much more likely to retain information if you go to ones that sound like fun.\n\nInevitably there will be sessions when multiple interesting panels clash. In such a situation it can be tempting to try to race from one to another to try to catch different papers from each. I would resist that urge. Not only is it likely that they will be held in different buildings, but the chair’s discretion over when to have questions makes it hard to predict when a paper will start. Also, it just feels rude to me and will be slightly heart-breaking for any speaker who watches the audience melt away when they stand up to speak.\n\nEqually inevitably, there will be sessions when nothing particularly leaps out at you. While it can be annoying, I would advise using that time as a chance to catch your breath. You can check out the book sale, with stalls from academic publishers and second-hand bookdealers. It can be an opportunity to practise your paper somewhere secluded (I favour St George’s Fields close to the campus). Particularly as the conference goes on, this time can also be a chance to sit quietly or have a quick nap.\n\n[Ed.: entirely agreed. Don’t feel obliged to attend every session: five days of six hours-plus of papers and socialising is tiring. It’s like Disneyland: militantly trying to squeeze as much ride time out of your stay as possible is a recipe for stressful exhaustion.]\n\nGiving your paper\n\nThis is the area that requires the least comment. Most papers will run for twenty minutes followed by ten minutes for questions. Depending on the nature of the panel, the chair may decide to combine all the question sessions at the end. Because of the large number of panels, sessions are scattered across the main campus, so it’s worth making sure you know where the room is in advance. The rooms come in all shapes and sizes, although they should all come with the standard AV setup and there will be a team of local students helping you to set up any presentation you might have. The organising committee will try to assess how large each panel’s room will need to be, but they don’t always get it right, so you may end up speaking in a packed closet, or presenting to an empty lecture theatre.\n\nOtherwise, you’ve probably done this or something like it before. Depending on the room, it may be worth pitching your paper slightly more broadly than you would to a more specialist conference. Be aware that if you’re going to discuss someone else’s work it is by no means impossible that they will be in attendance. While I can say from personal experience that it’s very enjoyable as an audience member to watch someone get ambushed by the person they’ve just spent the last twenty minutes attacking, it may be less fun if you’re the one standing behind the lectern. Sometimes, no matter how good your paper is, the question session will focus on the other papers on the panel. Your chair should try to get you involved and ask you questions, but try not to take it personally. It will say as much about the composition of the audience as it does about your work.\n\nA final thought here. Leeds International Medieval Congress is, well, an international congress (about medieval things, held in Leeds), which means that papers can be given in several languages. Speaking as someone who is aware of the immense privilege he holds as a native English speaker, I would strongly recommend that you give your paper in English to maximise your audience. This is your opportunity to share your scholarship with a wider group of people and the best way to do that is to do it in the global lingua franca.\n\nMeeting People\n\nLeeds IMC can be a tricky place to attempt to network at, and not just because academics tend to be socially awkward at the best of times. The sheer scale of the event turns individual academics into a faceless crowd, which can complicate making connections. Whereas at a smaller conference everyone sees the same papers, eats meals in the same places and may stay at the same hotel, those shared experiences are much rarer at an event the size of the IMC. Further, Leeds offers more established academics an incredibly precious opportunity to catch up with old friends who now live in other cities, countries or continents. This is one of the great attractions of the IMC but it means that senior scholars tend to have less time and energy for talking to new people.\n\nThis means that it is surprisingly easy to find yourself alone in the crowd, particularly if you don’t have any buddies from your own institution. This is never a pleasant situation to be in, and it’s easy to feel gloomy. If it happens, try not to let it get you down. Even the most assured and gregarious of the people you see before you have moments when they walk into a room full of strangers. Bear in mind that most of the scholars at the IMC feel much less confident than they look and that you are probably not the only person feeling uncomfortable.\n\nPrecisely because the IMC is the sort of place where a lot of people are feeling a bit out of place, it’s an excellent opportunity to strengthen existing acquaintanceships. People you vaguely know from previous conferences and workshops will be extremely glad to see a familiar face and you should build on that. In terms of meeting new people, there are a couple of things you can do. If you enjoyed someone’s paper, go up and tell them so. Everyone likes talking to people who appreciate their work. If they’re not looking busy you can explain why you were interested and maybe ask a follow-up question. The same applies to people whose scholarship you’ve read elsewhere (or to people whose blogs you follow).\n\nThere will be a range of social events throughout the conference that offer chances to get to know people better. The highlight of any IMC (apart from the paper I’m giving, which is always a work of genius that is as scholarly rigorous and philosophically profound as it is rhetorically splendid) is of course the legendary Wednesday night disco. I find the sight of one’s bibliography cavorting before one’s eyes humanises senior scholars considerably. This may be a somewhat intense space to meet people, although if you fancy saying hi, I’ll be the incredibly handsome tall blond guy doing a pogo stick impression across the dance floor.\n\n[Ed.: be careful: he flails.]\n\nMore low-key are the wine receptions that take place in the evenings. In addition to offering free refreshments, they offer a venue where people have shown up specifically to chat to strangers. Also popular is the casual football match normally played in the mid-morning break on Thursday.\n\nIf all else fails, my go-to strategy is to locate the nearest group of Americans and make friends. In my experience, Americans tend to be (1) outgoing, (2) eager to make friends while in Europe, and (3) easy to find. International conferences would be much less fun without them.\n\nTwo thoughts to close this section. Thought the first, no one likes being ‘networked’ at. It can be dehumanising if it feels like someone is only talking to you because they’re interested in what they can get from you. If you’re in conversation with someone, aim to find the things about them that are genuinely interesting. That doesn’t mean turning every chat into a deep excavation of your interlocutor’s soul, but it means treating people as worthy of attention for who they are, rather than just for what they might be able to do for you. Not only will this encourage the people you meet to spend time with you, you’ll also have a lot more fun doing it.\n\nThought the second, this is an international conference (that takes place in Leeds, featuring medievalists). As scholars get better at collaborating with each other and paying attention to work done in other countries, medieval studies can feel like a single community. It’s useful to bear in mind that the people you will be talking with come from dozens of countries with different intellectual traditions. This means that the big names, ideas and sources that you’re familiar with may not be household names for everyone else in the same room as you. This is an incredible opportunity for you to share what you know with other people and learn from them in turn, but it can be disorientating.\n\nIt also means that the ways that medieval studies interact with the wider political and intellectual landscape that scholars come from will also be different. Terms and ideas that are controversial in one environment may not be in others. By all means, challenge bad behaviour. By all means, defend your ideas and practices. But unless you have strong reason to suspect otherwise, I would suggest operating under the assumption of good faith.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nLeeds IMC is fantastic precisely because it brings people from across the world together. Part of the miracle is that we don’t fully appreciate how wondrous this is. In Europe, it is barely two generations since the language skills and cultural knowledge of our forebears were drafted in the service of war against each other. Even now, one of the consequences of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is that it has become increasingly hard for Russian scholars to participate in events like the IMC.\n\nIt’s not for everyone. You can have a stellar career in medieval studies without setting foot in Leeds IMC. It’s expensive, exhausting and overwhelming. But I love it. I’ve learned a huge amount about the medieval past from attending, developed my skills as a scholar and a communicator and made wonderful friends. And I hope this (monstrously long) post is of some help for anyone thinking of attending it for the first time.\n\nRecently, a very nice person got in touch via the blog’s contact form to say thanks. This is always appreciated, but what inspired this post was the reason they were reading the blog in the first place. It seems that genealogical enquiry had got them as far back as the ninth century, to the emergence of the so-called Thibaudine family. We’ve met their most famous early representative, the memorably-named Theobald the Trickster, trying to assert his own authority in the Neustrian March against Hugh Capet in the late 950s, and it’s safe to say that this mid-tenth century point is their ‘big bang’ moment. Eventually, they’ll go on to be counts of Champagne and even kings (of Navarre) before dying out in the early fourteenth century. Their emergence in the ninth century, though, is obscure; and given that the topics are interesting (and also that a surprisingly high proportion of this blog’s traffic comes from Facebook genealogy groups and the like) I though that addressing some of the myths and realities of the earliest Thibaudines would be worthwhile.\n\nIt has to be said that the reality is pretty easy to cover. The first Thibaudine to emerge into the light of the documentary sources is Theobald the Elder, viscount of Tours, who first appears in 908 already in post. Theobald, rather like his colleague Fulk the Red in Angers but even more so, basically came out of nowhere. However, we know a little bit about Fulk’s background and connections, enough to know that his family had some royal ties, some marital connections to local Church magnates, and maybe a couple of more important distant relatives (although the evidence for this is rather more circumstantial than I would like). We know none of this for Theobald. By analogy, we can say that he was a ‘man in the middle’, a member of the local elite who by dint of ability or connection was granted an office by Robert of Neustria and who parleyed that office into a lasting family legacy. But that’s it.\n\nThis hasn’t stopped people trying.\n\nProbably the first was Richer of Rheims, whose work spends a remarkable amount of its opening pages on the counts of Blois. Per Richer’s telling, during the reign of King Odo, a royal standard bearer named Ingo distinguished himself in battle against the vikings, and was given the castle of Blois. When he died, he left it to his young son Gerlo. Richer doesn’t actually make Gerlo an ancestor of Theobald. However, by the beginning of the twelfth century, Lambert of Saint-Omer made this Gerlo not a little boy but a ravening pirate, and explicitly placed him as the founder of the Thibaudine line. These figures are all inventions. None of them are found in the – relatively good – contemporary sources. Equally, we have no reason to think that Richer had any good sources of information about the later ninth century, and his genealogical statements about the period (such as giving Robert the Strong a father named Wichmann) are demonstrably incorrect. Lambert too had no good contemporary sources, and his use of Richer and other later sources simply piles legend on legend. In short, we are in the realm of genealogical myth.\n\nNext in line comes the mid-eleventh century historian William of Jumièges, who places the inception of Thibaudine rule not in a genealogical line but one of office-holding. According to William, after his many ravages King Charles (it’s unspecified which one) granted the city of Chartres to the viking Hasting, who held it for some time. However, when Rollo began to attack the West Frankish kingdom, Theobald tricked Hasting into selling Chartres to him, after which Hasting disappeared and Theobald’s power was consolidated. Again, this is central medieval myth-making: the historical Hasting is pretty well-documented and none of his activities happened at that time or in these places. Equally, Thibaudine dominion over Chartres didn’t come about until the mid-tenth century. What’s happened is that William has read Dudo of Saint-Quentin’s Gesta Normannorum and combined two themes: that Hasting was an evil predecessor to Rollo and that the Norman War of the 960s against the Thibaudines was a turning point in Norman history. By having Hasting as the forerunner of the Thibaudines in office-holding, William paints the Thibaudines as the Rollonids evil mirror, all the better to savour their defeat under Richard the Fearless. The historical Hasting has no place in the history of the Thibaudines.\n\nThis brings us to modern historians. Perhaps the most fun theory was that of Ferdinand Lot. Lot, attempting to keep Richer’s evidence in the picture, argued that Theobald was born from an illicit union between Gerlo and Charles the Bald’s widow, the Empress Richildis (thereby also explaining a letter to the empress from Fulk of Rheims castigating her for her bad behaviour in widowhood). Unfortunately, this theory is completely vitiated by Lot’s false belief that Theobald the Elder and Theobald the Trickster were the same person. As it happens, we think – although it’s not completely certain – that it was Theobald the Trickster’s mother who was called Richildis, and there’s no good reason at all to identify this figure with the dowager empress. Richildis is not exactly an uncommon name.\n\nThis, finally, brings us to a whole dossier of claims, made by historians as distinguished as Karl Ferdinand Werner and Jacques Boussard, attempting to link Theobald, or Richildis, or both, to ninth-century figures. Werner believed Theobald the Elder derived from a distinguished Franco-Burgundian lineage; Boussard connected them to the counts of Bourges; others have tried to link them to the Robertians, the Rorgonids, and others. The evidence for all such claims is scanty and can be summarised as relating to either onomastics or office/property-holding, or both. Thus, for instance, Werner’s argument relies in great part that ‘Theobald’ was also the name of Hugh of Arles’ father; and Boussard makes much hay from the fact that Theobald the Trickster’s (half-?)brother Richard became archbishop of Bourges, ‘doubtless’, he says, ‘because of his mother’s family ties with the counts of the city’. I’ve written before about the problems in using onomastics to make genealogical arguments, so all I will say here is that the presence of the name ‘Theobald’ amongst the highest echelons of the Carolingian aristocracy has very little probatory value when it comes to connecting them to figures on the other side of the Frankish world who were by all other accounts fairly minor and it certainly doesn’t explain anything about their careers. On the other hand, Boussard is making a leap, and I think a fallacious one, which is very common if rarely articulated amongst a certain kind of prosopographer: that the only way for property or office-holding to be gained or passed on is via family ties. This is demonstrably untrue, and the fact that it is demonstrably untrue significantly weakens any kind of argument based on succession.\n\nSo where does this leave us? When it comes to tracing back the Thibaudines beyond the early tenth century, nowhere. That’s not a bad thing, though. The temptation to give ancestral figures glittering genealogies or careers more exciting than our sources warrant can be strong; but ultimately the figure of a local elite making a prosperous but unremarkable career as upper management has more explanatory power than any amount of myth-making.\n\nMedieval manuscripts do not come to us straight from their moment of creation. They were read, scribbled on, stored, repaired, sold and collected in the intervening centuries, passing through many hands along the way. These histories are important. They can provide clues to the manuscript’s provenance or help to explain curious features about its preservation and current condition. They show us how people responded to their contents, who was interested in them and why. As a consequence, medieval historians tend to acquire a working familiarity with the activities of wealthy collectors, covetous Renaissance clerics, earnest revolutionaries and any other group of people likely to contribute to the moving of manuscripts.\n\nI recently found myself trying to track the post-tenth-century history of Cambridge Corpus Christi College MS 223. The manuscript was donated to the college by one Daniel Rogers, whose name can be read on p. 2. His name is also present in six other manuscripts in the collection of the Parker Library and M.R. James suspected that other manuscripts might have been given by Rogers to the library as well. Having exhausted most of my other options for following this manuscript over the centuries, I decided to investigate the other manuscripts that he had donated, as well as the man himself, to see if some pattern in their acquisition might furnish me with any clues. I walked away not much more enlightened on the history of MS 223, but fascinated by Rogers and the collection. What follows is my attempt to use the seven manuscripts securely connected to him to think about his life and world. Rogers had an unusually interesting life, but the library collections that scholars use today were built by stories like his. In talking about Rogers and his books, I’d like to shed a little bit of light on how the manuscripts that medieval history is built on were preserved, assembled and used.\n\nThe First Book: The Gospel of St Mark in Greek (MS 224)\n\n‘Overseas’ is a congenial address for a writer, offering a safe redoubt where one can hide one’s eccentricities behind a cloak of foreignness. For George Hermonymus, known as the Spartan, ‘overseas’ was Paris, which proved to be a good place to be Greek in the 1470s. There, when not teaching his tongue to other foreigners with strange names like Erasmus and Reuchlin, he copied Greek books, such as this Gospel of St Mark that Daniel Rogers acquired when, nearly a century later, he too discovered his overseas in Paris.\n\nRogers’ father John found an overseas of his own, in Antwerp, and there he also encountered copies of the Good Book in Greek. There, the erstwhile catholic chaplain of the Merchant Adventurers worked with Tyndale to render Holy Scripture into English. There, he married Adriana de Weyden with whom he had a son, Daniel. For these, among other crimes, John Rogers burns. He is bound to a stake and set alight in front of a crowd on 4 February 1555 at Smithfield, earning his place as the first martyr in Foxe’s book. Daniel watches. This is an important day. His career as a book collector is about to begin. Upon visiting his father’s cell, Daniel will find a book, ‘a blacke thing’, containing John’s account of his interrogation. He is seventeen.\n\nThe Second Book: Greek Miscellany including Homerocentones, Hesiod, Cebes, Theognis et al., with (Latin) Life of St Nicholas of Myra (MS 248)\n\nSaint Nicholas of Myra is a patron of travellers, and his intervention can balance scales tilted against the vulnerable abroad. The flames burn out in England and a new queen, Elizabeth, takes the throne. Daniel Rogers leaves his studies in Wittenberg and takes them up in Oxford. Rogers catches people’s attention and in the 1560s finds employment working for the English ambassador in Paris. He makes himself useful. As their terms end, his employers recommend him to their successors. He can be trusted to run the ambassador’s household, school the ambassador’s children, and keep his mouth shut when arrested on a dark night on the ambassador’s business.\n\nHe also makes friends, many of them French; but in this time, as in all other times of its history, Paris is filled with foreigners: German, Italian, and above all, Dutch. Rogers comes to know them all. He talks poetry and politics, history and heresy. He merges his love of the classics with his love of God. Perhaps in light of his multifarious interests, in 1564 one of his friends, Ioannes Olivarius, presents him with this Greek miscellany, copied by Olivarius himself, marrying the Greek past and the Christian present. The book stays with Rogers, as does the city. In future decades in other lands, his friends will remark that his appearance brings Paris with him.\n\nThe Third Book: Marcus Valerius Martialis, Epigrammata (MS 236)\n\nHe writes poetry by the yard. An epigram here. An ode there. He begins young and never stops and the verses accumulate. These are working poems, meant to do things in the world. He is as liberal with names in his verse as he is with puns, and the two often overlap, to the detriment of at least one German prince. He praises statesmen and writers and rulers and above all his Queen. His poetry makes friends and gets those friends in front of people who matter. He is an alchemist. He transmutes words into money and guns and powder for his Dutch comrades fighting for God’s cause.\n\nHe writes in Latin, of course. His father may have taught him that English is a fine language for Scripture, but Rogers knows that only Latin will do for poetry. If there is artifice in his work, there is also soul. In his lines we find the market raised on the frozen Scheldt where he drank wine and bought books, the beloved friends he lost in the murderous violence of St Bartholomew’s Day, and the university in Leiden, a city bearing the wounds of Spanish cannon, founded in his presence by men whose hands had only recently replaced guns with books. His poetry works in the world, and you will find all the world in it.\n\nThe Fourth Book: Claudian, De raptu Proserpinae. Bernardus Silvestris, Cosmographia (MS 228)\n\nClaudian was another master of the art of sending soothing poetry to powerful people. He was also a traveller, who crossed the Roman sea from Alexandria to the Eternal City. Rogers is a still more restless soul, taking wealthy Germans around Ireland in between employment elsewhere. His Queen is killing Irishmen in the name of the cause that Rogers has dedicated his life to, but he has Gerald of Wales to guide him and history to nourish him. The inevitable poem on Ireland that follows is to be but the prelude to his history of Roman Britain. He explains to his kinsman Ortelius that he will strip back the layers of medieval embroidery to reach austere ancient truth (it is a time for such iconoclasm.) Where words fail, he will draw upon numismatics, or the example of the present-day Irish, who preserve the simple barbarism of antiquity. Everywhere he will find the traces of the work of Rome. Word spreads that the manuscript is complete. And yet it never seems to appear. Rogers has other matters to attend, new wars to fight, a new empire that threatens the island of Britain. Upon his death, his notes emerge, in the manuscript now known as Cotton Titus F. 10. They are restless and endlessly curious, filled with wandering Greeks, druids, and fulminations against lesser chroniclers.\n\nThe Fifth Book: Publius Papinius Statius, Thebaid (MS 230)\n\nIn Statius’ tale, seven princes allied to make war on Thebes and reimpose a banished king. It’s a story Rogers knows well, as Spain turns its might on the Dutch to restore Habsburg rule to the rebellious provinces. And so to war he too must go. He dons no armour, raises no spear, and stands in no phalanx. But he is everywhere. In London, he has secret meetings with his master, the spider Walsingham. In Brussels, he watches as Philip Sidney matches wits with Don John of Austria. He is known in the courts of Germany, and by the kings of Denmark and Norway, as he continues the quest to assemble his own league of princes for the cause. He spends a year riding with quiet stadtholder Willem, who speaks long into the night with him. When the skies between the Sea Beggars and the Merchant Adventurers turn dark and foreboding, it is Rogers who calms the intervening waves, soothing proud men and setting them on gentle waters.\n\nAnd those rare places where he is not, his words are. Whether in reports, poems or entreaties, they scatter across Europe, a constant chorus calling for aid, for money, for men. Desperate battles are won and lost. Neighbours turn on each other in the name of God. Antwerp burns at the hands of unpaid Spanish soldiers. Satan himself stalks the land and it is incumbent upon all men to defy him as the last day creeps inexorably forward. Daniel Rogers bears no arms and fights no battles, but his words draw blood and summon armies. This fact does not go unnoticed.\n\nThe Sixth Book: Boethius, The Consolation of Philosophy (MS 214)\n\nLike his father, he is imprisoned. The wheel of fortune turns, and his luck runs dry in the autumn of 1580, in Cleves, on his way back from a meeting with German leaders. He is taken on the road and held on Philip’s orders. He will not be ransomed cheaply. The king of Spain knows his worth. So a man of constant movement must now hold still. (Six years later his captor will be knighted on behalf of Elizabeth for services rendered after changing sides. Few men understand the turn of the wheel better than mercenaries.) The world notices Rogers’ absence. Letters are written and petitions sent. Quiet negotiations are undertaken and dangerous rescues plotted. Walsingham is coaxed into taking an interest. The Merchant Adventurers attempt a ransom. The Queen enquires into his wellbeing. There are setbacks, and rebuffs, but at last, for an extortionate price, he is released after four years. He returns to England, having been given his liberty and a very large bill.\n\nHis copy of Boethius’ Consolation is eleventh-century, with Old English notes. It has been gnawed by rats.\n\nThe Seventh Book: Prudentius, Cathemerinon, Liber apotheosis, Hamartigenia, Psychomachia, Peristephanon, Contra symmachum, Dittochaeon, De opusculis suis. John Scottus Eriugena, Aulae sidereae (MS 223)\n\nEriugena wrote his last poem, Aulae sidereae, to praise Charles the Bald, the king who protected him from his theological enemies. The complete text survives only in this manuscript, which crossed the channel at the end of the ninth century or early tenth century to remain in England. So too does Daniel Rogers, seeking the protection of his own monarch. He will have to wait for some time, but at last the powers that be are grudgingly stirred into action to pay back old debts, and in 1587 he is appointed clerk of the privy council. His fighting days are over. His new role affords him considerable time and comfort. He travels in Scandinavia, discussing witches and the movements of the earth. He is elected a Member of Parliament. Above all he collects books.\n\nWhen and why he decides to leave them to the College of Corpus Christi and the Blessed Virgin Mary in Cambridge, better known in his day as St Benet’s and familiar now as Corpus Christi, is unclear. Just as we rarely know of the manner in which he acquired his books, so too we know very little about their donation. Most of the clues to those stories died with Daniel Rogers, on the 11 February 1591. But if he cannot tell us anything about his books, his books may be able to tell us something about him.\n\nPlaces and people from the past become inextricably linked to particular genres of writing in the present. It is a truth universally acknowledged that a story set in Regency England will be in want of a costume romance. The spectre of the Gothic looms over any tale located in Transylvania before the twentieth century. And any fiction set in Los Angeles in the 1940s is going to let you know they’re trouble when they walk into your office with legs that go all the way down to the ground. In the case of the Early Middle Ages, that genre is fantasy. The association stretches back to the Middle Ages themselves. Well before Tolkien began crafting a world for his languages, jongleurs carried songs of Arthur, Attila and Charlemagne through the courts of Europe, while farmers and merchants in Iceland passed long lightless winters listening to sagas about years gone by. That the writer who did more than anyone else to codify modern fantasy was a Professor of Anglo-Saxon studies with a special interest in Beowulf certainly didn’t hurt either.\n\nThe bibliography on the influence of the early medieval world on Tolkien’s fantasy writing is enormous and I have no intention of attempting to add to it. But as a professional specialising in the Early Middle Ages with a deep fondness for fantasy as a genre, it struck me that it might be interesting to think about the ways in which fantasy writers since Tolkien have engaged with the period in their writing. In doing so, I’d like to consider what it is about the early medieval world that they find useful and interesting, what that says about popular perceptions of the period, and what ideas, if any, historians can take from them. My method in selecting examples is highly scientific – I raided the contents of my book shelves and my kindle in no particular order. For this reason, it is by no means exhaustive, being anglophone, with a heavy emphasis on the 2000s (aka my teenage years when I had pocket money and a lot of free time) and reflective of my (very) peculiar tastes. Nonetheless, upon reflection I think certain trends emerge which are potentially revealing.\n\nFiling the Serial Numbers Off: Guy Gavriel Kay\n\nFew fantasy writers have made the inspiration they drew from the Early Middle Ages more obvious than Guy Gavriel Kay, whose literary career began when he worked as Christopher Tolkien’s assistant in editing his father’s unpublished works. The majority of Kay’s books are set in fictionalised versions of real-world settings, many of which are from the early medieval period. These include The Sarantine Mosaic duology (1998, 2000, based on Byzantium in the age of Justinian), The Last Light of the Sun (2004, Alfred the Great and the Vikings), and, my personal favourites, The Lions of al-Rassan (1995, eleventh-century Spain) and Under Heaven (2010, eighth-century China).\n\nAlthough Kay clearly does considerable research for each book, the setting is ultimately there to serve the story and he very reasonably compresses timelines and characters for narrative economy. The early medieval world provides Kay with epic backdrops, settings filled with colour and scale, and dramatic events kickstarting the conflicts that drive the plot. Generally the broad sweep of the history remains the same, with the big exception being The Sarantine Mosaic which throws a couple of fairly large counterfactuals into the mix. Perhaps the most distinctive thing about Kay’s use of the Early Middle Ages, and one of my favourite things about his books in general, is how beautiful his settings are. As we shall see, when the early medieval period is used to provide a fantasy background, it’s normally for a rather grim state of affairs. Kay’s early medieval worlds are culturally rich, filled with art and poetry and song. Despite widespread prejudice, they are also spaces where people of different faiths and races can meet and try to understand each other. Unlike many other works that draw on the period, the tragedy in Kay’s stories is not that the Early Middle Ages are here, but that they are going and with them their beauty and their tolerance. His best writing evokes these fragile middle grounds, creating quiet moments of grace that take place just before the wrecking storm. These spaces are doomed, but that makes them all the more precious. Kay’s ability to see the wonder in the Early Middle Ages helps explain his popularity among medievalists more generally, and is the reason The Lions of al-Rassan is a book I return to every year.\n\nWidukind and Friends: Kate Elliott\n\nAs we shall see throughout this post, some early medieval settings are more attractive than others. Arthur and the end of Roman Britain will always attract a crowd. Similarly, anything with Vikings in it does well, particularly when we throw in the compulsory trip to Constantinople. Fantasy depictions of tenth-century Germany on the other hand are rather more unusual. Hesitant though I am to say it, I fear that the Ottonians lack the raw sex appeal of other inhabitants of the Early Middle Ages (Saxon-appeal on the other hand…). Fantasy books that cite Widukind are rare birds indeed.\n\nRare, but not unheard of thanks to Kate Elliott’s excellent Crown of Stars series (1997-2006), which is set in an unusually convincing fantasy world based on Ottonian Germany. Fantasy it most certainly is, being stuffed full with magic, monsters, rock-creatures for Vikings, and interdimensional elves which come in Roman and Aztec flavours. These elements are grounded by a thoroughly researched human society based on tenth-century itinerant kingship. (It probably helps that the author’s sister is a professor specialising in medieval German literature.) Elliott adds weight and believability to her world through her close attention to material culture and day to day logistics. A hundred warriors are a considerable army in this setting, and one that needs to be fed. Elliott is skilled enough that such realities add to the plot rather than slowing it down. Even the magic acquires a certain verisimilitude from her use of early medieval scholarship (and a healthy dose of Macrobius).\n\nPerhaps my favourite element is the handling of religion. Modern fantasy writers tend to struggle with the role of religion in their early medieval analogues, if they don’t drop it altogether, often reverting to faith as a cynical con perpetrated by a corrupt church. Crown of Stars certainly features plenty of ecclesiastical shenanigans. But Elliott constructs an interesting religious world based on the teachings of Bardaisan of Edessa, where faith imbues every part of society. Although all the characters have different relationships to it, religion matters practically, spiritually and culturally for our protagonists. The result is a vivid depiction of an early medieval world.\n\nStories of Arthur: Philip Reeve\n\nIn discussing the Early Middle Ages as an inspiration for fantasy writing, Arthur is the 1000-pound bear in the room. There is no possible way anyone can briefly summarise the influence of Camelot and company. Generally, when people write stories about Arthur, they follow one of two routes. Either they embrace the weirdness of the medieval source material with plenty of magic and very little attention to historical context, or they go full ‘Dark Age Arthur’, cutting the mythology out in favour of a gritty allegedly realistic setting. As a rule, I tend to prefer the first approach (which is how you get the superb The Green Knight film from 2021) to the second (which is how you get a horribly miscast and inexplicably Pelagian Clive Owen fighting the Saxons on Hadrian’s Wall). But because this post is about using the early medieval past for fantasy narratives, the latter strand is more directly relevant for us today.\n\nIn these sorts of stories, the early medieval past is used to strip out Arthurian weirdness and replace it with something more grounded. Done straight, ‘Dark Age Arthur’ can be very good indeed, with Bernard Cornwell’s The Warlord Chronicles (1995-1997) being a fine example. But something about the contempt with which a lot of these narratives cannibalise the mythology rubs me the wrong way. For this reason, the book I’d like to mention in this section is Philip Reeve’s Here Lies Arthur (2007). Despite being written for a YA audience, Reeve’s Arthurian world is a dark place indeed. His Arthur is one armed thug with a retinue among many fighting over the carcass of western Britain, distinguished only by his violence and by his patronage of Myrddin. The latter, who is a bard, wizard and spin-doctor extraordinaire, is determined to unite Britain against the Saxons by turning Arthur into a heroic legend. Our main character, Gwyna, becomes Myrddin’s assistant in this endeavour.\n\nReeve has a lot of fun with Myrddin’s cunning schemes, as he stage-manages a number of familiar literary episodes. But what I particularly like about this book is his willingness to embrace some of the weirder elements of Arthuriana and medieval culture. His handling of gender and sexuality in the Early Middle Ages is particularly bold for 2007 and serves as a nice nod to the complexity that medieval gender studies have been revealing for decades. Reeve’s Age of Arthur is a fluid world, defined by the stories that people tell, and all the more fascinating for it.\n\nIn the Far Future there is only the Dark Ages: Mark Lawrence and Joe Abercrombie\n\nOne recent trend in fantasy writing is to use the Early Middle Ages as the blueprint for a postapocalyptic world. This is something employed by Mark Lawrence in his The Broken Empire trilogy (2011-2013, followed by The Red Queen’s War, 2014-2016 set in the same world) and by Joe Abercrombie in his Shattered Sea trilogy (2014-2015). Both feature elite young male protagonists relying upon their intelligence and ruthlessness to survive and thrive in a Hobbesian war against all. Both are also incredibly dark narratives, in which our main characters do appalling things. Because of these parallels, I’m talking about them together.\n\nMuch of the action in The Broken Empire takes place in a setting that draws heavily on traditional views of France in the tenth and eleventh centuries. Our teenage protagonist, Jorg Ancrath, reads like a cross between Fulk Nerra and Alex from A Clockwork Orange. We encounter him leading a merry band of droogs on a brutal rampage across a war-torn northern France. The Shattered Sea treads slightly more familiar ground, set in a postapocalyptic Baltic with a strong Viking flavour (our protagonists even travel to Miklagard in the second book). Born into a royal family with a crippled hand, Yarvi was meant to enter the church but unexpectedly becomes a king. Betrayed and sold as a slave, Yarvi seeks his revenge, giving the plot a pleasing hint of The Count of Monte Cristo.\n\nThe first thing that raises eyebrows is of course the idea that the Early Middle Ages is what naturally happens when civilisation collapses. I’ve talked about my problems with the idea of the Dark Ages before. This sort of thing undermines our ability to see the period on its own terms, and understand both its beauty and the unique factors that shaped it. There is nothing natural about the Middle Ages, and treating it as a short hand for the state of nature short-changes it. That said, Lawrence and Abercrombie do make good use of the concept. The visual image of a dark age warlord hunkered down in a fortified office block rereading his treasured copy of Plutarch, or of a band of Vikings exploring the irradiated ruins of modern Stockholm, is a striking one, which adds to the atmosphere of the narrative. I particularly like the way radiation and other postapocalyptic standbys are interpreted via medieval stories of magic and the Monstrous Races, giving a fresh feel to both sets of concepts.\n\nI think as a medieval historian I should probably object to the depiction of the Early Middle Ages as a period of constant warfare characterised by political instability and treachery. In my heart of hearts, I don’t think I can. I think it’s safe to say that both Lawrence and Abercrombie struggle with the role of faith and ideology in politics. The idea that people might actually believe in things beyond survival, self-advancement and loyalty to one’s intimates doesn’t really make much of an appearance. That said, I can’t think of many successful well-sourced early medieval rulers who didn’t have an awful lot of blood on their hands. Frankly, the Early Middle Ages could be extremely violent and unstable, although not all the time or at a constant level, and not mindlessly.\n\nBoth The Broken Empire and the Shattered Sea take a stab at thinking about how people’s environments and the structure of their societies turn them into bloodstained villains. Where I think they differ is on what they lead into. Lawrence hints that the game can be won, that a Leviathan can emerge to create peace, but that it may require a monster to do so. (Whether a good person can break the wheel is a question he ducks in one of the more disappointing moments in the series). Abercrombie is more sceptical, viewing these events as an escalating cycle, in which efforts to create order through violence lead to more chaos as acts of cruelty beget further cruelty. Trying to read too coherent a philosophy of politics and history into books that are meant to be entertaining may be missing the point. Ultimately both series succeed at their basic ambition of being enjoyable reads if your taste runs to dark fantasy.\n\nMagic and the Waning of the Early Middle Ages: Naomi Mitchison\n\nTravel Light (1952) is probably the weirdest book I want to talk about today. It’s certainly the shortest, clocking in at 135 pages in my copy. Into that relatively brief length, Mitchison crams a huge amount. The book begins as a fairytale for children, a charming and funny story about how a girl named Halla is raised by bears and dragons in the wilds of Scandinavia, with strong nods to Norse mythology. The tone very quickly acquires a tragic air, eventually becoming a surprisingly dark political thriller in which Halla must navigate literally Byzantine court intrigue in Miklagard. But this is merely the second act, leaving a final act that is sad, ambiguous and hauntingly beautiful.\n\nNaomi Mitchison refuses to make things easy for us as the reader. Every time we think we know what genre of story we’re reading and what kind of endgame we’re leading towards, she upends our expectations. Even as she changes, Halla ultimately chooses to remain free and authentic to herself, even when those choices impose costs upon her. Having experienced human civilisation, she sides with the world of magic and dragons, even when its clear both that that world is doomed, and that her own humanity makes it impossible for her ever to truly be a part of it. Halla walks her own path, and not even the Allfather, or the love of her life, can stop her.\n\nIn terms of its depiction of the early medieval world, what I find interesting about Travel Light is that it shows the onset of the Early Middle Ages as a tragedy not because it represents an anarchic breakdown of order, but because it is too civilised. The colonisation of the wildernesses of the north marks the end of freedom and magic. Whether it is the corrupt inequality of Byzantium, or the patriarchal brutality of the Russias, the world of men (and it is very much men) does not come across well in this story. Throughout the narrative there are nods to an ancient world were humans were more in touch with nature and power came through personal sacrifice rather than through coercion and violence.\n\nMitchison also walks the line between medieval literature and history in a way unusual in more recent fantasy. The former provides the basis for the disappearing older world of magic. We’re invited to sympathise with the likes of the Grendels (family friends of Halla) and with Fafnir. In this she resembles Tolkien with whom Mitchison had a long correspondence (she also proofread The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers). The result is a story that brings back some of the alienness of the Middle Ages, which I very much enjoyed.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nA lot of fantasy writing that draws inspiration from the Early Middle Ages leans hard on the image of the period as a Dark Age. If you want to tell a story about a poor, violent world, with low levels of technology and stability and high levels of mud, popular perceptions of the early medieval period will give you plenty to work with. Further, the idea of the early medieval world as postlapsarian place, a world in decline in the dying afterglow of Rome, allows for some really compelling stories, which you can also apply to postapocalyptic settings. I don’t really have a problem with this, so long as the stories that we get are entertaining, but it’s worth noting that it reflects a particular interpretation.\n\nIt’s also not the only way that you can depict the period. It’s possible to give a much more positive interpretation, as in the case of Guy Gavriel Kay. Other writers, such as Kate Elliott, lean much harder into the primary sources, using her understanding of the Early Middle Ages to ground more fantastical elements. One interesting trend is a move away from medieval literature to history. While they knew a huge amount about history, I suspect that the formative encounter for older writers like Tolkien and Mitchison was with Old English and Norse literature, and that shapes the feel and texture of their writings. By contrast, my sense is that more recent fantasy writing draws much more upon history, which informs their plots and settings but perhaps not the actual language they employ, resulting in books that feel much more modern and less alien. (Kay may be a transitional figure, still active today, but imbued in the older tradition).\n\nAs I mentioned above, this is a very brief survey of a somewhat random selection of books. It is by no means exhaustive. I should also say that for all my occasional criticisms, this is a genre I genuinely like. I am already compiling a list of promising sounding authors for the next moment I have some time to read for pleasure (summer of 2057 is going to be amazing). At the moment I have Saladin Ahmed, Poul Anderson and Katherine Kurtz on my radar, but I’d invite readers to offer their own suggestions in the comments.\n\nRecently, I was doing some peer review on a translation. I thought it was a good translation, and recommended it be published with only a few tweaks, but it was one of several things I’ve seen recently that raised a question which might be interesting to discuss. We do a lot of translation on this website, and if you’ve read them you’ll know that we tend to render every word in English. The translation I was reviewing, and it’s not the only one I’ve seen, kept several words in Latin. I’ll say up front that there’s a case for either approach and I don’t think either is objectively worse, depending on your perspective and goals; but it may be worth writing down why I go for the former option.\n\nFirst, let me give you a concrete example of what I mean. Here’s a passage from the Bachrach and Fanning translation of Flodoard of Rheims’ Annals (chosen because it’s the easiest example of this in print for me to get – as I write this, which is several weeks before it will go up, I’m in isolation with COVID so my resources are a bit more limited than they otherwise would be):\n\n…King Louis gave the castrum of Amiens to Erluinus. Heribert’s sons took the munitio of Clastres, in the pagus of Vermandois, due to the treachery of Raoul, one of King Louis’s fideles. This Raoul secretly slipped out of the stronghold when Heribert’s sons entered it and plundered the treasures before abandoning the deserted municipium.\n\nB.S. Bachrach & S. Fanning (trans), The Annals of Flodoard of Rheims (Toronto: 2011), p. 39.\n\nAs you can see, in these two sentences, five words are untranslated: castrum, munitio, pagus, fideles and municipium. Were I translating the same passage, I would have rendered them as ‘citadel’, ‘fortress’, ‘district’, ‘followers’ and ‘fortress’ again. So what arguments could justify either approach?\n\nThe main argument for leaving some words in Latin is that the word is ‘untranslatable’. In some cases, English can’t convey any of the nuance. Take Vergil’s Aenid, which repeatedly refers to its main character as pius Aeneas. That seems like it should be ‘pious Aeneas’, but a Classically-trained friend of mine once spent a good fifteen minutes explaining to me that this is a very flat translation: pius doesn’t mean that Aeneas is religious, necessarily (although it does include that meaning with its ambit) but that he is dutifully loyal in appropriate ways, especially towards his family. In other cases, English can’t convey wordplay or puns. Gregory the Great’s famous pun that beautiful English slave-boys looked like non Angli sed angeli (‘not Angles but angels’) does work in English, but his follow-up puns don’t – they were from the kingdom of Deira (modern Yorkshire), and Gregory responded bene Deiri, de ira eruti (‘Deira is a good name for it – they will be snatched from God’s wrath’). Or – my favourite – the description of Dominicans as domini canes, ‘the dogs of the Lord’, which also doesn’t really work in English (‘Dominicanines’?). Finally, there are technical terms which some translators deem more appropriate to keep in Latin, in much the same way that people who work on eighteenth-century France tend to keep the French word gabelle rather than putting it into English as ‘salt-tax’. I see these most often in the case of titles (dux is probably the most significant, but marchio also gets this treatment) and fortifications (some well-known medievalists have argued that the endless different Latin words for ‘fortified place’ – arx, castrum, oppidium – and so on all have different technical meanings and so leave them untranslated). I personally find this last point the least sympathetic, not least because at least a few of the arguments that X or Y is a technical term are tendentious and not translating them smells too much of stacking the deck. That is, by leaving these terms untranslated, an artificial sense of a coherent technical terminology is created which might be as if not more misleading than just putting the word in English. Nonetheless, there are certainly ambiguities. Dux is a case in point: I don’t think anyone would object too strenuously to translating dux Normannorum applied to the Viking leader Ragnar in 845 (as indeed it is) as something like ‘Viking chief’ or ‘Scandinavian warlord’; or to translating the same phrase applied to William the Conqueror as ‘duke of Normandy’ in 1066 – but what about when applied to Richard the Fearless c. 970?\n\nAll these points are valid, but to leave words untranslated because of them seems to me like an abdication of responsibility. This is a personal point of view – another person may very well see it as due caution – but let me try and explain. To start with, I don’t think translation is the process of transparently rendering a Latin text into an English one; it is (in an academic context, at least) a work of mediation and explanation, a tool to help with understanding the original version. This is so far from being a controversial opinion that it might be almost a commonplace – to go back to the example from Flodoard at the top of this post, the word ‘stronghold’ in the translation isn’t in the Latin but has been added by the translators, making the structure of the sentence smoother in English but also providing a gloss on munitio and municipium – but I think an approach which says that some words are translatable and others aren’t runs the risk of implying it. To take the Bachrach/Fanning translation as an example again, they choose to leave dux in the Latin but render comes as ‘count’, which implies that a comes is straightforwardly comprehensible to English speakers in a way that a dux isn’t – and I am on record on this very blog as not thinking that’s true.\n\nWhat that means is that not translating Latin words hamstrings a translation’s value as a tool to aid understanding. An important part of translating a text is deciding what the words mean, and refusing to do that in (say) 3% of cases means that the translation is only 97% useful as a tool. It certainly means you as a translator have to make interpretative judgements; but the whole translation is an interpretative judgement, making refusal in particular cases somewhat arbitrary. Sometimes, choosing one rendition of a word or phrase is tricky – but this is exactly the sort of thing that scholarly apparatus exists to discuss: nuance, wordplay and technicalities find their home in footnotes. This does mean that translations are not very useful for doing detailed linguistic analysis of sources. On the other hand, that’s not their job: a translation isn’t a source, it’s a translation of a source, and anything which rests on particularities of the language needs to be related back to the original text. For this reason, I think my comments apply even to translations aimed at an audience of academics, who might have more grounding in the source languages than interested non-academics – anyone who is going to be doing serious research based on an historical text will need to have a copy of the original to hand anyway if the language matters, because by their nature translations are useful but not dependable for this: trust, but verify, as the saying goes.\n\nAs I’ve said several times, I think leaving words untranslated is a legitimate choice, and I don’t find it reprehensible or unjustifiable. However, I do think that translating all the words, even the difficult ones, is more helpful, and that’s why I do it.\n\n(Oh, and it almost goes without saying that calling this a post about ‘translation philosophy’ is a little pretentious – there is a large literature which is actually about translation philosophy, to which my only exposure is a couple of comments at the front of Penguin Classics. Consequently, these are only the little musings of a rough-and-ready practitioner and may seem rather naive to anyone who’s actually well-versed in these ideas!)\n\nOne of the things that makes being an academic often seem slightly unreal is that you spend a lot of time feeling like you’re screaming into the void. You craft articles by conducting the research, honing the argument in conference papers, writing and re-writing variations of the same words over again until by some curious alchemy they are transmuted into something resembling coherence, before scurrying off to the library to get the last footnote just right. You benefit from/endure the advice of anonymous peer reviewers. You edit, and edit some more, and question your intelligence and sanity when at the very last minute you spot a ghastly spelling mistake that somehow escaped the ministrations of the past half year or more of work. At last, you finally place it into the journal’s online submission system, and away into the aether it goes. And then, if you’re anything like me, in the quiet moments in the middle of the night, you ask yourself whether there was in fact any point to the exercise, whether any of that work will make any difference, and if anyone, anywhere, will ever read your labour of love.\n\nThis is why my first emotional reaction to reading a chapter criticising my work was joy. In this piece, ‘Holy wars’? ‘Religious wars’?: The perception of religious motives of warfare against non-Christian enemies in ninth-century chronicles’, in the recent volume Early Medieval Militarisation[1], Professor Hans-Werner Goetz spends a couple of pages (pp. 214-216) discussing an article of mine (‘“Those same cursed Saracens”: Charlemagne’s campaigns in the Iberian Peninsula as religious warfare’, Journal of Medieval History 42 (2016), pp. 405-428). I think it’s fair to say that he’s not a fan of it. Nonetheless, the excitement of opening the volume, seeing my name in print and realising that someone somewhere had read my work and thought it worth their time demolishing it was very real.\n\nMy attention was drawn to this chapter for a couple of reasons. These begin with the fact that Hans-Werner Goetz is a major scholar whose work on medieval frontiers and perceptions of other religions I have greatly benefited from. But also, this isn’t the first time that my article has attracted the attention of Professor Goetz in print, having featured previously in his ‘Glaubenskriege? Die Kriege der Christen gegen Andersgläubige in der früh- und hochmittelalterlichen Wahrnehmung’, Frühmittelalterliche Studien, 59 (2019), 67-114, specifically at pp. 99-102. Given this, I thought it might be useful for me to take some time to respond to Goetz’ concerns, not least because he raises some interesting questions about the relationship between war and religion in the early medieval period.\n\nThe argument in my original article, which you can read in full here, runs as follows:\n\n1. Charlemagne’s wars in the Iberian Peninsula, which include both the disastrous invasion of 778 and the campaigns conducted by his son Louis the Pious as king of Aquitaine in the 790s and 800s, are normally understood as secular affairs, opportunistic wars of expansion. This is because the most important primary sources, particularly the Royal Frankish Annals, don’t depict them as religious conflicts.\n\n2. This is quite striking when compared to wars against other non-Christian neighbours such as the Saxons, where Charlemagne deliberately targeted sites of worship such as the Irminsul and forced the population to convert to Christianity at the point of a sword, imposing multiple laws defining what it meant to be a Christian.\n\n3. However, by looking at a wider range of sources that relate to Carolingian warfare in the Iberian Peninsula in this period, we can see a more complicated picture, where defending and even expanding the Christian faith are key motives for these campaigns. These sources are:\n\na. The Continuations of the Chronicle of Fredegar, compiled during the reign of Charlemagne’s father, which celebrate his ancestors in their wars against Muslims.\n\nb. A letter of Pope Hadrian I to Charlemagne discussing the 778 expedition.\n\nc. The liturgies of war contained within the Sacramentaries of Gellone, Angoulême and Arles.\n\nd. Charters from Charlemagne, granting land to the Hispani on the Spanish March in about 780 and 801.\n\ne. A letter of Alcuin from around 790 concerning Charlemagne’s expansion of the Christian world, including in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nf. A poem by Theodulf from 796 calling upon Charlemagne to bring the Arabs to Christ.\n\ng. A letter from Charlemagne to Bishop Elipandus of Toledo from around 794, saying that he had sought to liberate the Christians of al-Andalus from Saracen rule.\n\nh. Ermold the Black’s praise poem of Louis the Pious (written 824-6), which has Louis declare that if the defenders of Barcelona in 801 were Christian, there would be no need for him to go to war against them.\n\nWhile individually each would be a thin reed to base an entire argument, in accumulation they become increasingly convincing.\n\n4. Based on these perspectives from within and without the court, Frankish wars in al-Andalus in the reign of Charlemagne can be characterised as holy wars, because they were presented as wars to protect and expand the Christian church in Francia and in the Iberian Peninsula. This does not mean those were the only motivations for those conflicts, but they were a major one, and the dominant explanation provided in contemporary or near contemporary sources.\n\n5. I speculate that the reason the annals avoid much of this religious language is that with the exception of the capture of Barcelona in 801, the majority of the campaigns in the Iberian Peninsula did not go particularly well. While this was never desirable, it was particularly embarrassing if you had previously raised the stakes by making it a war of faith. Therefore, annalists linked to the court played down the religious fervour that surrounded the expeditions.\n\nAs mentioned above, Hans-Werner Goetz has disagreed with this article in two separate publications. Both resemble each other closely, often sentence-by-sentence and footnote-by-footnote, so unless specified I’m going to treat them as the same text. His broad argument is that the category of ‘holy war’ is not a meaningful one in the early medieval world, because all of culture and society was so imbued with religion that there was no other type of war. All conflicts were justified and legitimised by the faith so the idea of a war of religion is a modern anachronism. This is an idea I find extremely interesting and which I want to discuss later.\n\nHowever, Professor Goetz has also disagreed with my article on more specific grounds and, with your indulgence reader, I would address them first, if only because anyone who read his pieces would fairly walk away under the impression that I am a poor scholar indeed. But let’s start with places where we both agree. Goetz begins by saying that my work ‘still pre-assumes (setzt voraus) that Charlemagne’s wars were religiously motivated’. Basing my work on assumptions would indeed be unfortunate. However, prior scholarship for several decades tended to assume the opposite, and it was this prior scholarship which the case that I made was responding to. The professor also notes that ‘the fact that the Saracens are recognised and judged as non-Christians’ is not proof that wars against them were holy wars. I agree! My argument was that the apparently ‘secular’ ethnic labels often used in the sources such as ‘Saracen’ or ‘Agarene’, were in fact imbued with Biblical significance, implying that they were non-Christian and antithetical to Christianity; but this was not meant to be evidence for holy war, but rather against standard arguments that the language of the annals is secular on the matter. In the longer German treatment, Goetz argues that we cannot use the religious motivations that the biography of Louis the Pious written by the anonymous author known as ‘the Astronomer’ attributes to Louis for his campaigns against al-Andalus, because they are too late. I agree and did not use it in my article for precisely that reason.\n\nTurning to the pieces of evidence underpinning my argument listed under point 3 above, Goetz only mentions b, c, d and g; and I will deal with these in order. With regards to Hadrian’s letter to Charlemagne on the eve of the campaign of 778 (b), he argues that the Pope’s language comparing the Saracens to Pharaoh in the Bible says nothing about his motivations and was applied to every war. I disagree. The reference to Pharaoh is relevant because Hadrian notes that the reason he and the Egyptians drowned is because ‘they did not believe in God’. Charlemagne will triumph because he is Christian and the Saracens are not. Goetz’ argument is not strengthened by the examples of other wars he himself lists where similar comparisons were made. These include the statement in the Life of Bishop Athanasius of Naples c.7 that God helped the people of Naples defeat the Saracens and cast them down like Pharaoh. However, insofar as this language is also being used to describe non-Christian enemies this comparison would seem to support my case better than his. The other examples listed in fn.193 of the German article are all considerably later but also don’t strike me as entirely convincing in this context. Henry of Latvia describing the conversion of Baltic pagans as being akin to the casting down of Pharaoh does not scream secularity to me. I am not intimately familiar with Otto of Freising or William of Newburgh and so won’t comment on them. Nonetheless, I would argue that two of the four examples which Goetz chose to prove that comparisons to Pharaoh did not have connotations of holy war actually do look like precisely that.\n\nGoetz also dismisses the sacramentaries (c), writing that ‘people prayed to God for assistance before every war’. This is true, but not every sacramentary contains a mass specifically for wars against non-Christians, in the case of that of Gellone against ‘the infidel people’, in that of Angoulême ‘the pagans’. These are highly unusual masses, and in the case of the Sacramentary of Arles, the relevant mass had to be added to the manuscript at a later date than the other liturgical texts. All three of these sacramentaries are to be located in Aquitaine or Septimania, where the most likely non-Christians to be encountered were Muslims. That of Gellone may have belonged to Count William of Toulouse, who spent much of his career battling al-Andalus.\n\nNor is Goetz impressed by the charters (d), stating that ‘the granting of charters and donations to individual followers is a completely normal procedure’. In this case, though, what is significant is the unusual content of these documents. Charlemagne explains that he is giving the land because the recipients have had to flee the oppression of the Saracens in their homes in al-Andalus. The reason they are oppressed is that they are Christian, and the Saracens are ‘the enemies of the Christians’. The reason that Charlemagne is helping them is because they are his fellow Christians and they take part ‘in the unity of the faith’. In turn, they would perform military service, fighting with Charlemagne against their shared enemy the Saracens, who were their enemy because the Saracens hate Christians. This is strengthened by a charter from the 790s which rewards a soldier named John with land because he had killed ‘the heretic or infidel Saracens’. In fn. 49 (fn. 197 of the German article), Goetz claims that I explain the presence of Arab or Berber sounding names among the charter beneficiaries as ‘a misconception of the scribes’. However, my argument was somewhat different: I suggest that this points to the possibilities for nuance and complexity, where grandiose rhetoric and ideology meet reality. I don’t think even the most hardcore scholar of holy war would doubt that there were places where lines blurred at the edges, as any historian of the crusades could tell us.\n\nIn the longer German treatment, Goetz states that Charlemagne was more concerned with heretics than with non-Christians. This refers to Charlemagne’s letter to Elipandus (g), where the Frankish king informs the Adoptionist bishop of Toledo that whereas before he had striven to save them ‘from worldly bondage’, that is, being ruled by Saracens, but now that he knows they are heretics, he will leave them to their fate. Moreover, in this letter Charlemagne claims that his motivation for his earlier wars against al-Andalus, including the invasion of 778, was to save the Christian population, his co-religionists, who were being oppressed because of their religion. If that’s not a religious war, I don’t know what is. Further, Charlemagne’s statement that he felt less inclined to wage war on the Saracens now that he knew he wouldn’t be saving his fellow catholic Christians again seems to me to fall on my side of the ledger.\n\nGoetz finally observes that in 778 Charlemagne treated the Muslims of Zaragoza gently, while sacking the Christian Basque city of Pamplona. The reason Zaragoza got off lightly is that Charlemagne didn’t conquer it. It was never in Carolingian hands. The ruler, Husayn al-Ansari, refused to let the Franks in and they were balked by the mighty Roman walls of the city. Pamplona may have been sacked because it was perceived to be in rebellion, something Charlemagne was never gentle in his dealings with. In any case, as the ignominious example of the Fourth Crusade demonstrates, religious military campaigns can be vulnerable to mission creep.\n\nHaving said all that, Hans-Werner Goetz does raise an interesting point. Religion suffused medieval society to the point that it was the air that it breathed. Kings begged for divine aid in their endeavours and sought the help of their advisors who were learned in such matters. Spin doctors legitimised conflicts as being pleasing to God, encouraging people to believe that their cause was just and that they would triumph. Those engaged in battle beseeched the heavens for survival. He also notes that unlike the idea of a ‘just war’, there is no clear category of ‘religious war’ in the sources.\n\nTo take the second point first, while avoiding anachronism is an important part of comprehending the past, historians apply categories and ideas familiar to us but unfamiliar to the period all the time when it helps us to analyse and understand the past in ways that the people who wrote our sources were not consciously able to. A nice example here is economic history, which uses methods and concepts developed by modern economists in order to build up a sense of how resources, labour and exchange interacted to underpin the medieval world in ways that would not have been articulated at the time, but which reveal something real about the period that we can use. This applies to other topics related to the world of ideas and identities. Studying subjects such as gender and sexuality requires that we both understand the way they were categorised in the past and relate them to our own concepts in the present. Sticking purely to the intellectual constructions we find in our sources traps us in the worldview of the sorts of people wrote those sources. Those include few women, poor people or slaves. To get their history, our history, the history of the vast majority of human beings alive at the time, we need to be able to read our sources against the grain, and to ask questions which cut across the purpose and mindset of their writers.\n\nBut I would also suggest that there are points where we can in fact see people from the early middle ages categorising a particular war as specifically religious. When Pope Leo IV exhorted a Frankish army in 852 going to war against the Saracens, he famously promised them ‘that the kingdom of heaven will be given as a reward to those who shall be killed in this war’. This was because they were ‘fighting for the truth of the faith and the salvation of the soul, and the defence of the country of the Christians’. The Pope draws an implied distinction between this type of war and other types of wars. Unlike other campaigns the Franks might find themselves on, this one would see them win the ultimate prize because they were fighting for a holy cause. The same point was made by Pope John VIII in 878 in a reply to the bishops of West Francia who had asked for clarification on this. John wrote ‘those who, out of love to the Christian religion, shall die in battle fighting bravely against pagans or unbelievers, shall receive eternal life’. The Pope emphasises that this is because of the nature of the cause and of the enemy being fought. Again, this distinguishes between a religious war and other sorts of conflict.\n\nThe statements made by Leo and John are old chestnuts in scholarly circles because it is unusual to have anyone be this explicit on the matter in the early medieval world. But we might also be able to identify holy wars by the behaviour of those who undertook it. There were any number of possible reasons that Charlemagne might want to conquer the Saxons that would not involve religious motivations, ranging from a desire for a more secure frontier, military glory or expanded resources. None of those explanations would require the Frankish king to destroy Saxon cultic sites or forcibly convert the population to Christianity. Such a policy was if anything more likely to inspire resistance and rebellion. His father, Pippin the Short, had not felt the need to do such things when he invaded Saxony in 747 and 758. The way Charlemagne prosecuted the war against the Saxons was specifically shaped by his motivations. This was a holy war in a way that Pippin’s had not been, and his behaviour and that of his men and his opponents was different because of it.\n\nThis is where I think the concept of ‘holy war’ comes in useful, because by identifying it as a meaningful category, we can use it to draw up hypotheses and make predictions about people in the past. This is not to say that all religiously driven warfare was the same, or that all people involved in it had no other motivations. The past is complicated. People are complicated. But, by having ‘holy war’ in our tool box, we can understand and interpret patterns of behaviour that would be otherwise baffling if we didn’t have it.\n\nI want to close this post by expressing my gratitude to Hans-Werner Goetz. If he had not taken the time to seriously consider and respond to my work, I might not have been motivated to think about this topic in this way, and clarify in my own mind why ‘holy war’ strikes me as an interesting and meaningful topic.

Hybrid beings such as cynocephali, men with the heads of dogs, broke down all the safe barriers that made life secure, unsettling the hierarchy that placed humans above their beasts. But warnings prompt the wise to observe what needs to be noticed. The writers of the middle ages found instruction in these unnerving transgressions. In the stories they told about people with the heads of dogs we can hear the echoes of their thoughts on those with the heads of apes. The land that lies between human and animal, fact and fiction, is often fertile, even if it produces curious fruit. It is in this country that I find myself walking with this post.\n\nIn the year 814, the recently crowned Carolingian Emperor Louis the Pious was presented with a dog-headed man. That this extraordinary incident is not better known is entirely due to an error in our primary source, the Treatise of Signs, Prodigies, and Portents Old and New of Jakob Mennel, which is a historical survey of portents and omens produced in 1503 for the Emperor Maximilian I.:\n\nIn the year 914, a monster having the head of a dog and other "
