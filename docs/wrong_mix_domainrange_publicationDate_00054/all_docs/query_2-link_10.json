White certainly has been, in Nash's words, a herald. White's work emerged from obscurity at the same time as the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith did, in the years after the Revolution in Iran in 1979. It is more than coincidental that his first major book of poetry Another Song Another Season was published that same year. There is now a burgeoning literature on the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith provided by individual BahÃ¡'Ã­s the world over in the two decades since Nash wrote what have become prophetic words. White has, indeed, become a herald. Though I'm sure he did not set out to become the brilliant initiator that he has been.\n\nThere are others I could focus on to describe this 'development of a BahÃ¡'Ã­ consciousness in world literature': Robert Hayden, Bahiyyah Nakjavani, H.M. Balyuzi, M. Momen, Adib Taherzedeh, John and William Hatcher, among others, whose books, each in their own way, played their unique parts, in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, in laying this foundation of consciousness. I think the period 1979 to 1984 was especially significant in bringing about a transformation in the literature available to BahÃ¡'Ã­s on their Faith. White published three books of poetry and a novella which I deal with in essays later in this book. Nakjavani published two books: Response and Four On An Island in a refreshing and highly stimulating idiom that was as much poetry as prose and, like White, left many readers puzzled. Others found her writing possessed of a vitality and originality that, as Henry Moore once put it, were uniquely her own.[1] It was also a style of writing that was inspired by that same universal vision that inhabited White's poetry and that, I am confident, will take on additional significance as time goes on. And there were other books. But this series of essays deals with the poetry of Roger White. I leave it to other writers and critics to deal more comprehensively with the other authors who have been part of this emergence beginning, say, with the first teaching Plan(1937-1944) when, arguably, this BahÃ¡'Ã­ consciousness made its earliest appearances in world literature and the Faith itself begin to expand over the surface of the earth to become the second most widespread religion on the planet.\n\nThe course of development of the prose, the language, the thought--and especially the poetry--of a group of people: a nation, an ethnic group, a religion, indeed any group with a specific identity, a specific set of characteristics is, as the nineteenth century literary critic Matthew Arnold wrote, \"profoundly interesting.\" \"By regarding a poet's work as a stage,\" he continued, \"in this course of development we may easily bring ourselves to make it of more importance as poetry than it really is.\"[2] Perhaps I am guilty of this literary sin in what I admit to be, again in Arnold's words, my quite exaggerated praise, my arguable overrating of White's work. What may be the long term historical estimate of White's work and what is the intrinsic estimate of his work to a contemporary individual--and particuarly this critic-are not necessarily identical.\n\nThe internationalization of literature, its global orientation, its planetization, its planetary consciousness, the perception of literature as part of the essential fabric of a global civilization or culture has really only emerged in the last quarter of the twentieth century. Goethe, at the turn of the nineteenth century, was the first great thinker to suggest that the literature of the future would be a world literature with a planetary consciousness. A. Alvarez remarks, in analysing modernism in literature in the first three decades of the twentieth century, that it was \"synonymous with internationalism.\"[3] The scholarship of comparative literature and the histories of comparative literature have demonstrated that a common vein of ideas and conventions runs through all of Western literature. Indeed, there is unquestionably an underlying uniformity in the literary heritage of humankind, although an outdated nationalism, parochialism and insular local traditions still militate against the thrusting sense of global culture. Of course, traditionality, localism, associations of a national culture will remain, will be enriched. That, too, is part of the process currently underway on this planet.\n\nMr. T.S. Eliot once wrote that \"literary criticism should be completed by criticism from a definite ethical and theological standpoint.\"[4] I'm not sure that is necessarily the case.[5] It would appear than many of the greatest painters and writers did not write from an explicit, a defined and articulate philosophical perspective, but in the case of this work, this literary evaluation of the poetry of Roger White, I do write from much the same ethical and theological standpoint as White. Perhaps more importantly, though, the White I am analysing in this book is a very personal White. He is my White. A personal relationship grows up between poet and reader, a personal interpretation. The poet may be part of an embryonic BahÃ¡'Ã­ consciousness in world literature, but he also becomes part of the individual reader's consciousness in a very private and personal world often quite different from the world's of other readers. Lionel Trilling made this same point in relation to Robert Frost's poetry at a talk he gave at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York in 1959 in celebration of Frost's eighty-fifth birthday.[6]\n\nFor this reason and the personal friendship that I had with White over many years, I feel somewhat like the famous literary critic Helen Vendler who said in a panel discussion just recently in New York[7] \"I don't often do negative reviews...that does not seem to me an interesting kind of writing to do.\" Vendler went on to say that the negative, the critical, side of reviewing detracts from the affect, the vitality, of the content on the page. Critics want to write about the kind of poetry they would like to write themselves or they'd like to sponsor. No critic wants to write about some poet they don't like especially, Vendler concluded, as they get older and especially if they know the poet. Marjorie Perloff, another critic on the panel, said that to demolish or trash a poet was a devastating thing to do. Her approach was to say 'if you can't say something good about the poet, don't write the review or the book.' She said this is especially true for poets you know personally and when the review is not anonymous. Who wants to be critical of someone you know personally? It's not natural or instinctive, said Perloff. Some critics can hide behind the veil of anonymity and psychological distance and thus make more devastating comments. Others simply won't write about living poets. As far as these essays are concerned, then, readers will find little overt and strong criticism of White. There is, I trust, much of that etiquette of expression, that judicious and disciplined exercise of the writtten word, that moderation which \"ensures the enjoyment of true liberty.\"[8] Such is my aim.\n\nI like to think my study, my literary criticism, is similar to that of the father of literary criticism, John Dryden. \"His is the criticism\" in the words of Samuel Johnson, \"of a poet, not a dull collection of theorems, not a rude collection of faults....but a gay and vigorous dissertation, where delight is mingled with instruction, and where the author proves his right of judgement, by his power of performance.\"[9] Whatever the standpoint, though, theological and otherwise, my aim, like the aim of White's poetry, is to awaken and enlarge the mind by rendering it the receptacle of a thousand otherwise unapprehended combinations of thought.[10] White knows that:\n\nLife, like a dome of many-coloured glass,\n\nStains the white radiance of Eternity,\n\nUntil death tramples it to fragments.[11]\n\nAnd so he gives us that `many-coloured glass,' some of his philosophy `the white radiance of Eternity' and the process of our death trampling life `to fragments.' And I give you this review of White's poetry. I try to convey something of the new voice that White creates for us in his several books of poetry. I try to save the poetry from the artist who created it. For this is what White wanted. He was quite insistent in making this separation. This book opens with a short biography in three parts. I know that readers are as much interested in the man as the poet and his poetry. I don't think I overdo it, though. I hope Roger would find my weighting of these two distinct categories in good taste. He was always so kind in his letters that even if he disagreed with you he would always let you down slowly, laughing as you went. And he is no longer with us, with me, to say \"I think you overdid it here, Ron.\" He was also adventurous and frank, so you knew where you stood. He did not beat around the bush, as they say.\n\nThere is a high seriousness in White but his alembic is humour. For some readers the affect of his poetry is a lightness and pleasure that only humour can provide; for other readers White's seriousness and his language place too much of a demand and, not willing to read and reread his poems, these readers put him down without extracting the intellectual delights; for still others, White has the affect of an invigorating exercise of the mind. For them the laughs are a bonus and the reward is more than pure delight. These readers gain an understanding of the religion they joined at some time in the last half century, an understanding perhaps deeper than any learned commentary or, indeed, the efforts of their own investigation. These readers get a sense of a BahÃ¡'Ã­ consciousness, a BahÃ¡'Ã­ sensibility, a BahÃ¡'Ã­ voice, from a poet who has made a distinctive contribution to the birth of a spiritual and universal art.[12]\n\nMatthew Arnold, writing about the 'sanguine hopes' which accompanied the splendid epoch of poetry in European civilization in the first quarter of the nineteenth century, said there was a 'prematureness' to its expression. He said that, in spite of its energy and creative force, that epoch did not know enough. The creation of a modern poet, he went on, \"implies a great critical effort behind it\"[13] or it will be a short-lived affair. Time will tell, of course, if there has been enough of that critical effort behind the poetry of Roger White to make it a long-lived affair. There is certainly a critical effort required on the part of the reader if White's work is to be appreciated. In this twenty-first century, sinking deeper as it appears to be into a slough of despond, one can't help but wonder with Harold Bloom[14] what will survive in the long term from the world's burgeoning literary and media productions that fill people's lives today to assume a home in the world's literature in history's long arc.\n\nIn this greatest drama in the world's spiritual history in which we are all engaged, Roger White appeared for a time on the stage and is gone. But his poetry remains: as playful as Robert Frost and as serious as Ezra Pound, with his delightful metaphor and the freshness thereof, with his sympathy and infinitude, expansive virtues as Shelley once wrote \"awaiting a world of peace and justice for their due recognition.\"[15] That voyager is gone, ten years now. He gave himself, the only thing a writer has to offer. And where life is concerned, a writer, a poet, can only truly see, as he does through his own eyes and his own heart. He gives us the results of his search which, as Mark Tobey once wrote, are \"the only valid expression of the spirit.\"[16] He gives us what Dante says are the proper subjects of poetry: venus, virtue and salus.[17]\n\nHe liked the term `minor poet,' at least he used that term to apply to himself in one of his first poems.[18] I think he would have eschewed the term `major poet' for many reasons but, if a distinction can profitably be drawn between `major' and `great,' then White, for me anyway, deserves recognition as a great poet. Minor writers, minor poets, can be loved as purely and appreciated as much as major ones, and sometimes more easily, as another great analyst of poetry, Helen Vendler notes.[19] The distinction between talent and genius may be useful here. The former, said Arnold, gives the notion of power in a poet's performance, while the latter felicity and perfection in the art.[20] For me, White has some of both.\n\nIt is, perhaps, unimportant to \"decide\" whether White was a great poet. Pursuing labels of this kind and making such distinctions, may not be that helpful. White was good enough to provoke the question; that in itself is a great deal. He was an exquisite craftsman. He produced an ample body of powerful poetry. That was enough, in the case of Balzac, for Somerset Maugham to use the term genius, or in the case of Wordsworth for Matthew Arnold to use the same term. Arnold also felt that \"poetry to be truely excellent must have a high seriousness.\"[21] White certainly had that.\n\nArnold also wrote that: \" Whether one is an eagle or an ant, in the intellectual world, seems to me not to matter much; the essential thing is to have one's place marked there, one's station assigned, and to belong decidedly to a regular and wholesome order\"[22] as one gave others a taste for the things of the mind. BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h explored the same idea in writing about the portion of some lieing in a gallon and others in a thimble. 'Abdu'l-BahÃ¡ wrote much about the cultivation of the mind. Arnold was in good company. I got the impression these questions did not matter much to White.\n\nNow, of course, I think it unlikely that recognition of this or any kind concerns him in the slightest. As he writes in one of his last poems:\n\n.........................Released from\n\nwanting and having, I shall only be.\n\n..................\n\nOccupied with boundlessness\n\nI shall yet divine your unspoken question:\n\nWere you drawn away by the music,\n\nThe laughter,\n\nThe promised ecstasy of reunion?[23]\n\nThe work of a critic can be fantastically overestimated. Readers often forsake the works critics are writing about. Instead of enjoying the poet, the reader now turns to the critic as specialist, to his prodigalities of implication, his hyperboles, his nimbuses of rhetoric, his exaggerations and the various promptings that the critic places before the reader. This I do not mind. I think there is a certain inevitability here, at least for some readers. As long as all that I have written convinces you, the reader, if only for the moment, of White's talent and genius, I will have done my job. For my main responsibility is to the poet, Roger White, and the need to be truthful. If what I write appears over the top, as it is said colloquially these days, that is because of the genuine enthusiasm and pleasure I take in reading his poetry. White is a subtle, yet bewilderingly gifted, poet. I would not want you to miss the experience of Whiteland. I like to think that most of White's life consists of only those things that weren't good enough to go into his poems.[24] So, if his biographical details are a little light on, readers should not feel they are missing much. White wanted it this way.\n\nThe nineteenth century literary critic Amiel, describing perhaps that century's finest French literary critic Sainte-Beuve, wrote that \"it is only at fifty that the critic is risen to the true height of his literary priesthood, or, to put it less pompously, of his social function.\"[25] Only then does a critic have the required critical judgement. These essays were put in their present form when I was in my late fifties. I'm not so sure I qualify for any literary priesthood; I'm not sure I possess the maturity of judgement Amiel refers to, but I hope that readers enjoy the essays that follow.\n\nSamuel Johnson wrote biographies of each of his subjects before proceding to comment and evaluate their works. Such a combination satisfies, it seems to me, a perfectly proper curiosity. Johnson's Lives of the Poets is part of a biographical tradition going back to the early seventeenth century and earlier, a tradition that keeps separate a man's poetry and the man.[26] Gradually, in the nineteenth century, the study of a man and the interpretation of his work began to mingle and to mingle more in the twentieth century. I do some mingling. I am a moderate mingler in deferecne to White's particular philosophical proclivities in this regard. I hope readers will find my mingling helpful but not intrusive.\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] Herbert Read in Poetry and Experience, Vision Press Ltd., London, 1967, pp.157-8 describes the importance when writing literature of any kind of cultivating and giving experession to 'an intensity all its own' and a style which 'renews the spiritual vitality of the English language.'\n\n[2] Matthew Arnold in Critical Approaches to Literature, 2nd edition, David Daiches, Longman, London, 1981(1956), p.249.\n\n[3] A.

The facts of writers' lives, wrote Shaw, have no more to do with their writing ability than the shape of their nose. White used to quote Rabindranath Tagore on this biographical theme: 'the poem not the poet,' as Tagore put the theme succinctly. White felt that his life was, to use Shaw's words, biographically uninteresting. I don't think, though, that White's life, among those lives of the other minor poets to whose ranks he himself claimed to belong, could be said to be so unvarying and, therefore, so uninteresting. White did not want to diminish his work by restoring it to the particularities of what he felt was his mundane biographical context. And so there is little here of what that significant biographer and poet in our early modern period, Samuel Johnson, referred to as \"domestic privacies\" and \"the minute details of daily life.\"[1]\n\nI'm sure White felt about his future biography somewhat the way Mark Twain felt about Shakespeare's biography: \"an Eiffel tower of artificialities rising sky-high from a very flat and thin foundation of inconsequential facts, a fifty-seven foot high brontosaur that looks convincing enough in the natural history museum but is made of six hundred barrels of plaster of paris and maybe only 'nine old bones.'\"[2] He did not feel the same way about his poetry, although he does not appear to have had Walt Whitman's grandiose sense of destiny and overriding purpose about his poems. His was a more moderate sense of self-worth. But, like W.H. Auden, he was inclined to the view that an artist's private life sheds little light on his works. But like Auden, too, he would have been willing to bend the rule given the right circumstances. Of course, during his life White did not have to fend off biographers standing in line to write his story. I certainly don't have enough information about White's life to provide the kind of story White's life deserves, although Anne Gordon Perry has gathered a collection of White's letters and, if the right circumstances can be arrived at serendipitously and through Perry's insight into that collection, then White lovers will soon be able to read the first stab at a biography of White.[3] The chief source material for biographers is often their subjects' letters[4] or a diary. White was a most prolific letter writer and, for me anyway, his poetry serves as a type of diary. If any biographical skyscraper is to be built on White's land, his letters will provide the architecture.\n\nLiterary critic, J.V. Cunningham, once said of the poet E.A. Robinson that he was \"a man almost without biography.\" [5] I don't think White would have put it that strongly vis-Ã -vis his own life, but that was the sort of emphasis White wanted to give to his day-to-day life and, more importantly, that was the sort of emphasis he wanted his readers to give to it. I address myself to some extent to what White saw as his quiet and uneventful life,[6] to the events behind his character and personality and to the tough fibre that was his life as a writer. I hope that readers will like and respect White more, find him clearer as a human being, as a result of the glimpse I have provided into his life story and his poetry. I hope, in the process, to deepen the understanding of White's art. But my purpose is not, in the main, to correct or refine taste, as T.S. Eliot said was the purpose of the literary theorist.[7] Nor is my purpose to provide evidence for a thesis. What I write issues out of the pleasure I take in reading White's poetry and the belief that, as Robert Hayden once put it, \"Poetry does make something happen, for it changes sensibility.\" Biographer Frederick Glaysher elaborates: \"Such change, incontrovertibly spiritual in nature, is the prerequisite for any transformation in the objective, quotidian world.\"[8] I hope I bring to this exercise what the true father of English practical criticism John Dryden(1631-1700) said was the \"primary qualification of the good practical critic-the ability to read the work under consideration with full and sympathetic understanding.\"[9] I hope that I also bring a secondary qualification to my critic's role, a qualification which Dryden thought was important for any critic to possess; namely, the ability to communicate my relish and enjoyment of White's work and thereby help the reader enjoy his poetry in a similar vein. It is difficult, though, to rationally explain the effect of a poem on one's mind and emotions.\n\nBut insofar as White's inner world is concerned, a world largely inaccessible to biographers except through speculation, it is my view that White's poetry comes closest to revealing its true nature. Of course, letters can be very useful in revealing the nature of a person's inner life and I leave that to Perry, as I indicated above. Mark Twain expressed some of my skepticism regarding the extent to which a person's outer life, their actions and their conversation are a revelation of their true nature. Twain says they are just \"the clothes and buttons of the man.\" Twain continued:\n\nWhat a wee little part of a person's life are his acts and words! His real life is led in his head and is known to none but himself. All day long, and every day, the mill of his brain is grinding, and his thoughts, not those other things, are his history. His acts and his words are merely the visible, thin crust of his world--and they are so trifling a part of his bulk....The mass of him is hidden.\n\nTwain expatiates at great length on this theme and it reminds me in some ways of what has become an oft'-quoted passage of Shoghi Effendi:\n\nOne thing and only one thing will unfailingly and alone secure the undoubted triumph of this sacred Cause, namely, the extent to which our own inner life and private character mirror forth in their manifold aspects the splendour of those eternal principles proclaimed by BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h.[10]\n\nPerhaps the real person is quintessentially a mystery. If so, my intention is to explore that mystery through White's poetry. My focus is not on some complex of internal and self-referential relations, some theory of psychoanalysis. I'm not trying to focus my gaze on the inaccessible inner reaches of the authorial psyche. I'm not trying to get inside White's head. I try to understand White the man in a way he wanted to be understood: through his poetry. For the most part, I leave to biographers the question of the poet's character formation and the peculiarities of his personality as they take shape over a lifetime. I hope in the process to give White what Auden said \"every author hopes to receive from posterity--a hope usually disappointed--justice.\"[11]\n\nWhite's life may have been much like Jane Austen's novels: nothing much happens but you eagerly turn the page of his literary life waiting for what happens next. For the drama of White's life was in some ways like Lord Acton's, only on a different scale. That drama was a drama of ideas. Just as Acton's life illustrates the influence that powerful minds, past and present, exerted over his development,[12] so does White's, only in his case the powerful minds were those of two manifestations of God and Their chosen successors who passed by before and during his lifetime, and some very impressive individuals in the first century and a half of the religion he became associated with in his late teens.\n\nThe whole of creation, BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h writes, \"was revolutionized and all that are in the heavens and on the earth were stirred to the depths.\"[13] In 1921 T.S. Eliot expressed this change as a 'dissociation of sensibility.'[14] Others have called it a paradigm shift. Society has not recovered; indeed, the tempest is still with us. For this writer, White is but one of the multitude of manifestations of this quite complex and profound shift, as it was expressed in poetry,[15] in the early epochs of the Formative Age and, in particular, the tenth stage of history when the charismatic Force that gave birth to the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith was fully institutionalized.[16]\n\nI see myself very much like the type of literary critic that Eliot calls 'the advocate:' to help readers find merit in what they once overlooked, to find charm in what may have been first experienced as a certain tedium vitae or boredom, to remind others that there is a depth there in White's poetry that simply must be tapped and simply to express my gratitude to White, posthumously, on behalf of many of the lovers of White's poetry. There are no explicit canons of criticism. What is needed is a meeting of the author's intention and the critic's appreciation. \"Worthwhile criticism,\" writes Herbert Read, has as its basis \"pathos, sympathy and empathy.\"[17] To some extent, too, this commentary is a by-product of my own creative activity. As 'Abdu'l-BahÃ¡ said many times, the reality of man is his thought and it is White's thought that this book is devoted to, for the most part. Here is White's thinking talking to you. I hope that the reason readers want to know more about White's life is that they care for his poetry and are interested in his thinking. If Robert Pinsky is right about what constitutes good poetry over poetry that is dross, namely, that it will admit abstract statement,[18] then White's poems are good ones. They certainly tell you what he is thinking with a fair portion of abstract thought.\n\nI was able to piece together a basic outline of White's life. I sent it to him for his approval two years before he passed away. He made two or three minor corrections of fact and returned it. It was obvious to me that White was disinclined to provide more than he already had done about his life. \"If you want to know about me, read what I have written,\" seemed to be his position, his view, on writing about his life.\n\nI have done so and enjoyed White's poetry with the relish of a starved palate. Now I hope I can accomplish what the twentieth century's great poetry critic Randall Jarrell\n\nsaid was the critic's aim: \"to show to others what the critic saw in what he read.\"[19] Inevitably readers here will be exposed to the defects of my own sensibility, prejudices and idiosyncrasies as well as a substantial body of analysis and evaluation of White's poetry. For the most part I do not dwell on the intricacies with which White's mind negotiates with its surroundings to produce what I find deeply satisfying poetry. For the most part I do not occpy myself with the nature of the connection between White's personality and his poetic imagination. I leave that to the more biographically inclined student. I am content to explore the poetry, the world that is contained in White's poetry and its meanings. Even then, I only explore a small part of his oeuvre. Poetry, in some ways, is the attempt to organize through the imposition of language raw human perception, the flux and mess of experience. I examine a very small part of White's specific perceptions, specific experience, specific poems and the examination is largely tentative. It is just an initial exploration of the territory. Perhaps it will stimulate others to journey into White's land, to follow his path, to continue beyond these first studies in these early stages of what I am confident will become 'the White industry.'\n\nIf you had met White at any time in his adult life, say after his marriage in 1954 at the age of twenty-five, the man you would have seen is one that I have only the most vague impression of. It is an impression I have gathered from several photographs and from the several letters I received: a short, slender fellow, thin and bird-like, a serious countenance, a ready smile, a quick-wit, but since I never met Roger White, since I have no observations of others at my fingertips and since White himself wanted me to focus on his poetry what readers have here is poetic evaluation as a type of philosophical activity. It is an activity as Lord Acton once described it: something concerned with \"the latent background of conviction, discerning theory and habit, influences of thought and knowledge, of life and descent.\"[20] I find it helpful to be able to connect White's poetry with his life, but I cannot go as far as the literary critic Emilio Roma III who wrote that \"a critic will get at the meaning of a poem if and only if he does connect it with the poet's life....he must use this material if he is to be a good critic.\"[21] Neither can I go to the other extreme, as far as Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault as far back as the 1950s and in the United States since the 1970s, where literary criticism has set itself the aim of erasing the author as an entity and \"treating the text as a bloodless, authorless orphan.\"[22] Readers so influenced by this approach to the study of literature in a spirit of aggressive demystification--and I think this approach has its place--will find my approach somewhat \"belletristic\" and retro. But to others, to the community of poets and readers of White's poetry, I hope this community finds what I write an encouragement to take criticism and evaluation of poetry back into their own hands. The study of literature, prose and poetry, does not need to be only arcane and for some literary elite. It can be for everyman and he can still do his gardening, fix the car and watch movies. I like to think White's poetry can and will spread far and wide because, for many, his work is free of that \"narrow and dull decorum\" with its studied plainness which Robert Breslin saw as having \"spread over most, though not all, poetry in America.\"[23]\n\nI take some comfort in the words of the nineteenth century English essayist William Hazlitt who thought we could know too much about a person. Hazlitt wrote that \"the more evidence about a person you accumulate the more complex and difficult it is to 'know' someone. Interest and prejudice take away the power of judging, especially of those we love. The harder and longer you look, the more impossible it becomes to attain knowledge of others. Actual qualities do not conform to any factitious standard in the mind but, rest upon their own truth and nature.\"[24] It is difficult, as Virginia Woolf once put it, describing the process of creating biography, to describe some seamless whole around the life of anyone, some \"granite-like solidity of truth\" and some \"rainbow-like intangibility of personality.\"[25] And so I do not try, nor does White even want us to try. I do not try to portray or to shape White's life; I do not strain to define his identity; I do not describe from the outside some wholeness nor view his life from the inside in all its bits and pieces. I do not run after the unity of White's person. I accept that unity, as Alfred North Whithead expressed it, namely, as an \"inescapeable fact.\" I find Whitehead's view of personal unity helpful in connection with whatever remarks I may make about White:\n\nPersonal unity is a perplexed and obscure concept. We must conceive it as the receptacle, the foster-mother as I might say, of the becoming of our occasions of experience. This personal identity is the thing which receives all occasions of the man's existence. It is there as a natural matrix for all transitions of life, and is changed and variously figured by the things that enter it; so that it differs in its character at different times. Since it receives all manner of experiences into its own\n\nunity, it must itself be bare of all forms. We shall not be far wrong if we describe it as invisible, formless, and all-receptive. It is a locus which persists.[26]\n\nThe literary critic Edmund Wilson and others of his school who employ psychology and sociology in their study of literature inform us of the immense complexity and subtlety of the task of relating writers' lives to their works. The latter is not simply a variation on the former; each throws light on the other. Wilson prefers to work from the writer's life to his work, but more technical psychological criticism often works the other way. This is not so much of a problem if we know a great deal about a person's life. In the case of White, Wilson and his school are of little help.\n\nIt is the role of biography to describe the contours of this highly problematic receptacle and in the process portray character, render personality, place the individual in a sequence of culturally patterned relationships. That is not my role.\n\nI find that man and milieu, idea and context meet somewhat haphazardly on street corners: in Akka, in Haifa, in Toronto, in Belleville, in Tehran and around the corner from where I live. I am not concerned with where the cameras were pointed, at what the newspapers said, how White might have appeared on TV or on the radio or the contradictions that inevitably arise from the multitude of views that people have of anyone and of White in particular. I am writing about a media event, but it is in the print media. I am not trying to transform a selection of ephemeral events and scattered accidents into some fixed documentary with reportorial authority. I am not trying to recreate White, although I must confess to a certain impulse toward elegy, toward commemoration. The fertile, the creative, facts that suggest and engender and that I am after are not in White's life but in his poetry. This is no exercise in 'mere impressionism,' as David Daiches calls the simple setting forth of an autobiographical response in the place of critical assessment of a work, a literary oeuvre.[27] Autobiography is not literary evaluation.\n\nThe biography of a man whose adventures are played out silently under his brain cupola is a literary labour of another order.[28] When a life is not crowded with incident and adventure, when a biographer can not compile external excitements but must rely on inner greatness of spirit and on quite complex phenomena the challenge facing that biographer is greater. For the complexity of White and the phenomena associated with his poetry resides in factors like: who readers have gradually become by reading his verse; how his communication with readers is achieved; the exhuberance of his language and its appeal to our intellect and feelings; and his political poetry which overtly attempts to reveal connections between the feelings-the inner life-of the individual and objective social/historical facts.[29] To keep the poet and his poetry together, the doer and the deeds into one sober set of facts, under these conditions, and make it an interesting read for the public is beyond this writer. I do not see my role as an attempt to protect White, now that he has died, from \"malice, obtrusive sentiment or vain curiosity,\"[30] to use the words of one of Thackeray's memorialists; nor is my role to show and tell all. I show and tell very little really of White the man: whatever harmonies and disharmonies there may have been, whatever warts and all he may have had, whatever achievements he may have had while serving on a multitude of committees, assemblies and groups doing a myriad projects, assignments and activities as part of an embryonic Order, as an adolescent, a husband, a single man, a friend, indeed in one of any numbers of roles he had in life. I am not trying to save him for future generations. I am trying to put his poetry in perspective. I am trying to paint a mosaic in which White's poetry, its intimate imagery with so many of the historical landscapes associated with the birth and development of his religion-and ours-coexist as equal expressivities within a pattern. My aim is not to describe or embody in words some personal coherence of White the poet, like a Renaissance painting. If anything my style is more cubist. I come at White from a thousand directions, just brushing his side, touching his hair, taking a fertive look, as I hit his poetry with everything I've got. It's the hit of a baseball out of the ball park or a golf ball on a long putt right into the hole. That is my aim. Sadly I often strike out or settle for an eagle. For I am no professional. I am simply someone who loves White's poetry.\n\nWhite approved, in the two years immediately before his passing, a collection of a dozen or so essays, essays which focused on his poetry not his life, his words not his life story. Put slightly differently, this same focus on the art not the artist was expressed by George Painter in his biography of Proust. \"Tell me anything,\" Painter wrote, \"which I could not find more intensely, acceptably and deeply in Proust's works.\" Biography would only provide meagre details of Proust--and White. In White's poetry the reader can find his personal analysis, his introspective pondering, his inner self. His poetry, he felt, could and should stand on its own. It is the thread joining his life's occasions of experience. It is the way he discovers and clarifies his vision. It is a vision far removed from every ting of partisanship and politics but \"wholly devoted to the interests of all mankind.\"[31]\n\nI'd like to say a little more about White's politics. The words of poet Carolyn Forche are useful here. Forche writes that \"the quality of a poem is dependent on the quality of its engagement, a high degree of commitment.\" This is part of what she calls the poet's \"ideological stance.\" The time to determine one's politics is the \"whole of one's life. We are responsible for the quality of our vision, we have a say in the shaping of our sensibility. In the many thousand daily choices we make, we create ourselves and the voice with which we speak and work.\"[32] This comes close to expressing the type of politics White was concerned with in his poetry. By the time White had become an adult he had been exposed to what was clearly a BahÃ¡'Ã­ definition of the political. It was concerned with building a new Order and White worked within that Order in different capacities for nearly fifty years.\n\nI think it is impossible to get a comprehensive, a coherent picture of White from his poetry.[33] With some people, usually writers, there is a tendency to describe and record everything in their lives. This tendency gives a biographer a fighting chance. Virginia Woolf and Bertrand Russell were two such people. White did not put it all down. He put 'the love and madness of life,'[34] as Woolf called life's travail and adventure, into his poetry. But I do not attempt to knot up the incoherences of White's life into some theoretical coherence. This is no psychoanalytic exercise, however probing it may try to be. White knew and experienced a great deal but I apporach this knowledge, this experience, through his poetry, not through what happened to him. If readers want an entertaining yarn about an interesting BahÃ¡'Ã­ who lived in the last half of the twentieth century, they must go elsewhere.\n\nWhite kept no diary and so we do not have a detailed picture of his life, what Stendal called the \"excessive pile of I's and Me's.'[35] Prose was not a sufficient vehicle for White, although he certainly made use of it in his letters and in his craft as editor. The miraculous gift that makes an artist, a poet, remains a mystery, however near he may be brought to us by our need to understand him and his work.[36] His poetry, though, belongs to all lovers and appreciators of literature, whoever and whereever they are, even if the best critics of poetry are the poets as Seneca argued two thousand years ago and as T.S. Eliot stated the case in our own time. There is a basic unity to White's work, a unity that is difficult to define, except to say that White gives us Life itself, the Word and the World seen from a particular point of view by a North American BahÃ¡'Ã­ during the second, third and fourth epochs of the Formative Age.[37]\n\nReaders will find here in these essays a personal, unsystematic, eclectic kind of criticism, creating as it moves a tone, an atmosphere, that reflects in various ways the special qualities of Roger White and his writing as well as my own qualities, preferences and prejudices. I do not try to demonstrate with analytic precision the presence of any given quality in White's poetry; I respond to the achieved work rather than engaging in some technical demonstration.[38] I like to think there is an atmosphere of the study, for that is where I've done all my writing. The chairs are comfortable, the walls lined with books, some Bach or Beethoven is playing. I, like White, \"Draw my chair beside the fire and/Gather silence to me./I wind my thoughts in knotless skein,/Unspoken mile by mile,-/A league from immortality/Lay down my wool and smile.\"[39] And, in the process, I draw closer to Emily Dickinson in his poetic evocation The Figure in White; or perhaps I draw closer to myself.\n\nWhite was more than ready to respond to the analysis of his poetry written by others, even though he himself wrote little about his own life and little about his poetry. The essays which I wrote and sent to him about his life and his poetry were returned quickly with the occasional comment and a general appreciation and enthusiasm for what I had written. A dozen years later, in 2002, I revised these essays. It is these revisions which appear in this book. The result of this playing down of the biographical was that I never felt I was living in White's skin, only in his poetry and in the wonder of consciousness that emanated from his mind. In my essays I try to emphasize understanding White's poetry and to avoid the danger of slipping into endless explanation. Criticism in literature is not a science, however theoretically based it may be. There are no established canons or standards of criticism today as the Greeks once developed in the fourth century BC in Aristotle's Poetics. I try not to overemphasize enjoyment and the impressionistic and so avoid making poetry a mere amusement and pastime. There's a balance, I think, between the overlaping categories of understanding and enjoyment, analysis and impressionistic response. I trust I have preserved the balance, one that is often defined in our culture as that between entertainment and education. It seems to me there is an essential key, though, to the deeper understanding of a man's poetry to be found in his life, in spite of what White says. I toy with that key in this book while accepting the premise of Carlyle's biographer Froude that \"every person is a mystery even to those closest to him.\"[40]\n\nI have never written to anyone who responded with such haste to my letters. These were the last days before e-mail began to move communications electronically faster than a speeding bullet. His correspondence was humorous and engaging. One of the affects of his letters was to make me want to dip into his poetry more frequently. As I came to enjoy the man behind the poems, I came to enjoy the poems even more. I never actually met Roger. We exchanged letters for a dozen years: 1981 to 1993, years when his poetry reached out to the wide audience that he enjoyed for the last decade or more of his life. He died in April 1993 at the age of sixty-three. I have included a sample of our correspondence because it tells about the man in a way that his poetry does not. In the main, though, I have left White's correspondence to Anne Gordon Perry whose new book I trust will be on book shelves in the next year or so.\n\nThe sample of letters I do deal with, though, is partly my concession to the biographical. My aim, too, is to convey some of the joy or delight that is produced by reading White. \"Poetry only gives joy,\" though, writes Herbert Read, \"in proportion to the understanding we bring to it and our understanding must be of the most universal and intuitive kind.\" [41] White was more than a little conscious of what Sir Philip Sidney once called: \"man's erected wit and his infected will.\"[42] His letters, at least the ones I received are a tribute to his \"erected wit.\" Indeed, given the human propensity and need for, and pleasure taken in, laughter, it will not surprise me if White is remembered more for his wit than his wisdom. For he is par excellence the entertainer.\n\nShelley saw the poet and the man writing the poetry as having two quite different natures. I find that sometimes they blend and sometimes they occupy two quite separate worlds. I can only partly agree with Shelley, but what I do in these essays and what Roger White would have preferred me to do, is to focus on his poetry or, to use Shelley's idiom, I focus on the poet and the poetry not the man. White was only too aware of most people's preferred interest in the man, the personality behind the poetry. He was prepared to admit that biographies were not only inevitable but that they were desireable. But such a concession he would have surrounded with a host of reservations and warnings.[43] He would have been the first to admit that biographies are worthy of cultivation because they can enchain the heart by their irresistible interest and diffuse instruction by their diversity of form. But 'not about him' he would add, if you gave him the last word. At any rate White would have been pleased with any attempt to discuss intelligently his poetic opus. For he would have agreed with Daiches that \"A civilization is judged by its amateurs, by the degree to which intelligent non-experts can discuss with sense and understanding the phenomena of their culture....not too far removed from ordinary readers of literature.\"[44]\n\nI wrote the preface to White's last major book of poetry Occasions of Grace(1992). This preface focused on his poetry not his biography. And I do it again, here, in what is a more extensive and, I feel, a more deserving way, a decade after his passing. The timing seems right. The 'White industry' has had a quiet beginning, not an unusual one, though, for a poet. There is not yet a Collected Poems for White. For someone starting out to read, to imagine and meditate upon White's verse, the journey will be demanding. The exercise would be something like setting out to explore the planet. For anyone who is already familiar with some of his poems the new ones and the new books of his poetry will fit well into their existing pattern. I have spent years on White's poems, at least twenty during which I have examined them in some detail, underlining, making notes and watching two of the volumes that I came to cherish gradually fall apart as the binding deteriorated. I hope this time and effort, personal pleasure and profit, will in turn be of use to those who want to know more about White's poetry. For White crystallizes much of the amorphous nature of our existence, not by providing information but by a direct apprehension of the nature of reality and the significance of life. The process by which he achieves this is his style and a certain grace and clarity of performance. In the process he creates his own universe. Occasionally I refer to it as Whiteland.\n\n\"The point of a biography\" writes Ray Monk in a recent biography of Bertrand Russell, \"is no more and no less than to understand its subject. But a biography is not a \"necessary precondition for understanding a body of work.\" [45] Ray Monk, Shaw and White saw a distinction between life and work . And they would have placed the focus on the work. The work was always there to illumine the life; in fact the life could not really be understood without understanding the role played in the life and the imagination by the work. And I would add, in conclusion, that the exercise of sympathy on the part of the critic must meet and mingle with White's own predominant passions and concerns in his poetry, in his work, if his intellectual life is to be discerned, if the music of his soul is to be described, as Herder defined poetry.[46]\n\nI trust that readers will easily detect my sympathy meeting and mingling with White's work in the chapters that lie ahead.\n\nMy general aim could very well be a motto attributed to T.S. Eliot in his practical criticism and study of poetry: \"Study the craft, follow the process and read constructively.\"[47] In doing this in the essays which follow I try to strike a balance between making comments on individual poems and making them on the entire corpus of White's poetry. The extent to which I achieve this balance is the extent to which my own response to the poetry of Roger White is full and complete.[48] The analytical criticism and the more intellectual and complicated poetry that developed after WW1 was part of a major change of taste in poetry. White's poetry is not overly complicated and my criticism is far from the bewildering obscurity of much of contemporary criticism. I trust the reader will find here a moderate middle ground.\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] Samuel Johnson in Justin Kaplan, \"The Real Life,\" Studies in Biography, Harvard UP, Cambridge, Mass., 1978, p.1.\n\n[2] Justin Kaplan, op.cit., p.5.\n\n[3] Anne Gordon Perry, Yours, Roger: The Correspondence and Influence of Roger White, unpublished manuscript, 2002.\n\n[4] W.H.

The stock market crash precipitated the beginning of several years of economic bleakness that have come to be known as the Depression. Roger White was born in that bad year, 1929, in Toronto becoming part of what literary critic Maxwell Geismar called 'the generation of '29.'[1] A new Conservative government had taken office the year before under R.B. Bennett. Two years later Canada ceased to be a colony of Great Britain thanks to the Statute of Westminster. This little-known fact mattered little to most Canadians at the time.\n\nThe first wave of exploration in Canadian history had been religious and economic: missionaries, voyagers and fur traders. The second wave was technological and scientific: railway builders, miners, the many fields of science and technology. The third wave that explored phenomenal existence was cultural. The poetry of Roger White, beginning in the late 1940s, became part of this third wave. This, too, is a little known fact.\n\nUntil WW1, 1914-1918, romantic and adventurous tendencies in Canada were associated with western and northern Canada. Intellectual adventurousness had its roots in classical civilization and the minute examination of the Judaeo-Christian tradition. Until WWI and perhaps even WWII the classical tradition of western civilization still held the centre of Canadian intellectual life. But after WWII a new continental, north-south, consciousness began to emerge and with it a global, an international, perspective. The classical tradition began to lose its centrality on the Canadian intellectual landscape.\n\nThis new and emerging continental, north-south, divide provided the matrix for the developing embryo, the first seeds, of an evolving BahÃ¡'Ã­ consciousness in world literature. Within the context of this continental, this American expansiveness, a new literary cosmopolitanism invited readers to a luxurious feast, a great banquet of world literature. A host of writers, rising as they did above ideological and cultural differences to sound the unified note of an 'international perspective,' began to be heard more and more as decade succeeded decade in the last half of the twentieth century.[2] The BahÃ¡'Ã­ voice in this literary cosmopolitanism was a small one and not surprisingly for a community which did not exceed twenty-five thousand members in Canada and, perhaps one hundred and fifty thousand members in the United States at the turn of the millennium. Globally, though, the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith was the second most widely spread religion on the planet. The emergence of a BahÃ¡'Ã­ consciousness, a BahÃ¡'Ã­ perspective, in the literature of the people's of the world was inevitable. This emergence has taken place in several forms and several places. One of these forms is the poetry of Roger White.\n\nThe Canadian consciousness, whether turned toward classical or Judaeo-Christian history, whether turned toward the west, the north, the south or, indeed, to the entire planet as it increasingly was, could not be conservative. It was impossible, wrote Canadian cultural historian George Grant,[3] to build a conservative nation on a continent right beside the most dynamic nation on earth. It was not only impossible, it was ridiculous to even try. Canada had tried to do this until 1939. After WWII in a rapidly developing global cultural marketplace and ethos Canada moved increasingly in waters that covered the face of the earth. It was in these waters that White's poetry belonged. Although there is a strong Canadian flavour to his poetry as early as 1947, his poetry reached out to BahÃ¡'Ã­s around the world by the 1980s.\n\nIn 1929, though, White's hometown Toronto was a homogeneous Scotch-Irish community. It was noted for its smugness, its snobbery and its sterility. This was to be the case until the large intake of immigrants was absorbed in the late 1940s and 1950s. That conservative ethos and philosophy was rubbed off, given a shift outward, loosened up, as a post-war nation moved imperceptibly toward an era of multiculturalism by the 1970s. Perhaps this rubbing off process was part of White's release, too, from that same Canadian smugness and sterility which he was born into in Toronto and which he was sure to be part of the air he breathed in Belleville, also on the northern shore of Lake Ontario, in the 1940s. In 1947 White had begun to take an interest in a religion that had been in Canada, by then, for half a century. Something was sure to rub during this association and it did for nearly fifty years.\n\nIn the late 1920s and 1930s Canadians still wondered why their former Prime Minister Sir Wilfred Laurier had said that the future belonged to Canada. It seemed to them that the era of the farmer was passing and that Canada was rapidly being urbanized. The optimism of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had been tarnished by WWI, to put it mildly, and what was left of that optimism was obliterated by the Depression. Whoever the future belonged to it was not Canadians. Of course, a new optimism was born again after WW2 and White tasted its fruits beginning perhaps with his first job as the war ended and his first poetry in 1947. The religion he joined in 1947 was also one of a great optimism and it filled his poetry for half a century.\n\nOn 29 October 1929, Black Thursday, the boom of the 1920s came to a crashing halt and the New York Stock Exchange collapsed. Within a year millions of North Americans were without work and without money. Canada was desperately affected, so inextricably tied to the US economy had she become. By 1933 one-third of the Canadian workforce was unemployed. The new fiery leader, R.B. Bennett, elected in 1930 had no solution to the problem, although he was clocked at speaking some 220 words per minute. John Bernard White, Roger's father, moved to Belleville that year. A job there was better than none in Toronto.\n\nHere in this small Canadian town, hugging the northeast shore of Lake Ontario, Roger White entered primary school. Here he stayed until grade ten when he took his first job as a court reporter and Justice of the Peace in the Family and Juvenile Court of Hastings County Ontario. He was now 15. The year was 1944.\n\nThe 1920s and the 1930s came to be known as the years of Boom and Bust. When WWII ended these roller-coaster years were over. Although Canada had entered WWII with little emotional enthusiasm for the project of defending the Empire and western civilization and although the war was an exhausting process, Canada was surprisingly recharged. Her economy was transformed by the war. Unemployment disappeared and the standard of living rose all across the country. There were jobs everywhere and when peace came in 1945 Roger White was 16 and enjoying that first taste of employment.\n\nTwo years later, at the age of eighteen, Roger came into contact with a small group of BahÃ¡'Ã­s in Kingston, a large city near Belleville which Roger visited from time to time. Roger's first poem dates from this same year, 1947. That international climate was beginning to stir in the Canadian consciousness and it was reflected in the first significant wave of new members. The BahÃ¡'Ã­ community of Canada grew from about one hundred in 1945 to three hundred in 1952. By the mid-1960s the numbers had gone to over three thousand. The essentially international nature of this new message was beginning to attract an essentially conservative people on a highly dynamic continent that was going global, indeed, as the world was becoming a neighbourhood.\n\nOf course, this phenomenon was not confined to North America. White got in early, as the BahÃ¡'Ã­s did all around the world, for theirs was a religion made for a planetary culture and civilization. As its nationally elected body, the Canadian National Assembly, formed for the first time in 1948, [4] indeed, as the North American BahÃ¡'Ã­ community passed into its second half century, Roger White was beginning to write his first poems. Few would read any of them for another thirty years.\n\nWhite was born into a world, the North American world, which had just seen the final separation of the writer, the poet, from society. Some literary critics[5] argue that this process of separation had begun in North America in the mid-nineteenth century and was completed in the 1920s, in the Jazz Age. The energy which had conquered the continent in the previous two centuries had, by the 1920s and 1930s and with the help of the worst war in history and the deepest depression of the industrial age, lost its direction. What some called the generation of '29 was psychologically homeless, placeless and free to create a new world. Little did that world know that a new world[6] was in fact being created even as it went through the chaos of that great bottoming out. This generation existed, White existed, at the very start of a unique transformation, a turning of a cultural tide. With a new courage and a new faith won from crisis, new novelists arose at the very period when the nucleus and pattern of a future world Order was being formed: [7]Lardner, Hemingway, Passos, Faulkner, Wolfe, Steinbeck. White began his contribution in the forties, a later part of that new wave. The Beat poets: Ginsberg, Kerouac and Burroughs were forming their first relationships in the mid to late forties. A new wave was indeed on its way after the holocast of the second great war of the century, one of the lowest points in the history of civilization.\n\nThe literary critic, Clement Greenberg, had remarked acutely about the modernist poets of the 1930s, the years before WW2: It is small-scale poetry, lacking resonance, lacking real culture.....Its makers have neither inherited nor acquired enough cultural capital to expand beyond the confines of their immediate experience and of a narrowly professional conception of poetry.[8] By the time White began his poetic work, though, in the late 1940s the cultural capital had begun to be built anew. There had begun a new turning to belief and the embryo of new forms of poetry was finding its first shaping. White had been one of those precious adventurers of those post WW2 years, searching the unknown, a writer, at once unique and common, who would make his discoveries and endure them until his passing near the century's end. One of his discoveries was an emerging Order associated with an emerging world religion.\n\nEnjoying his childhood during that \"little overture to the immense drama of the centuries,\"[9] as Geismar called those years between the wars, an overture during which the nucleus and pattern of this emerging world Order was given its initial shaping, White would come to play a part in formulating an understanding of its beliefs, its outreach, its meaning to the generations that had joined its ranks in the second half of the twentieth century. This embryonic Order, a democratic theocracy in its political form, was going through some of its crucial early stages in its institutional evolution during his lifetime. The sociologist Max Weber had called these stages 'the institutionalization of charisma.'[10]\n\nEverything was changing for that generation of '29. Of course, Plus ca change, plus ca la meme chose. The inherent conservatism of the Canadian psyche was slow to move, even if it did live beside that great Dynamo to the south. White wrote about this change and this conservatism in his poetry. Living through nearly two-thirds of the first century of the Formative Age of the new religion and being one of its members for nearly fifty years after he had joined its forces in the forties, he was certainly part of its first wave. For history has its waves upon waves. The first wave of BahÃ¡'Ã­s, some 555 in the years 1898 to 1948,[11] was succeeded by a second in the years, 1948 to 1998, in the first century of its Canadian experience. It was here that the poet Roger White made his home, swam in the sea of its waters and discovered some wondrous gems which he once wrote were part of an \"unmerited grace.\"[12]\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] Maxwell, Geismar, Writers in Crisis: The American Novel 1925-1940, E.P.

But it has not been my intention to cover White's entire collection of poetry, letters, essays and references in the general literature. Rather, I am attempting a general introduction to White's work since, as yet, no introduction has become available and it has been ten years since he passed away. The time is right, it seemed to me and to my publisher, for such an introductory work. The focus in this book is, in the main, on White's poetry, his major publications, not on his letters, essays and the several genres within which he worked as a creative artist with words. Some attention to these other genres is found here in the name of bringing White closer to his audience and introducing a new generation of readers to this delightful poet who happened along at a critical stage in the emergence from obscurity of the religion he had been associated with since the late 1940s.\n\nWhite's first published work, the first work in what could be called the Early stage of White's poetic development,[1] was a chapbook in 1947. It was entitled Summer Window and was published by Cherry Press in Belleville.[2] One day a student of White will examine its contents as the White industry, now in its earliest days, expands, as it surely will. Even by his mid to late teens White needed to write. This need defined the basic premise upon which everything else depended. It was one of the two or three great categorical imperatives of his life. A second chapbook of poetry, also containing poetry from these early days, was published in 1973 by Haifa Publications. He called it Sketches of 'Abdu'l-BahÃ¡.3 I leave the examination of this poetry to future scholars. One chapbook that Roger sent me at some time in the 1980s, Old Songs/New Songs, contains several poems about White's early life before the age of twenty-one.[4] It was certainly written before he was twenty-one. White called these poems his juvenilia. Two of them, sent to me under separate cover, he said he wrote 'circa 1947.' He wrote at the top of the page 'juvenilia.' He said he found these \"while sorting through his papers.\"[5] I reproduce them here, the earliest poems that I have read from what became nearly half a century of writing poetry. There is no indication that his earliest work gave him \"the creeps\" as the earliest work of the great American poet Wallace Stevens affected him as he looked back from the pinnacle of his literary success.[6]\n\nThese were the early days of White's education as a poet. Through the experience of writing, White was learning what literary structures fitted his talents. They were important lessons. Often a poet does not learn until too late. Ezra Pound learned late that The Cantos were basically incoherent and a lifetime of over fifty years and 800 pages may have been useful for a biography of Pound but they served largely as an unvisited mausoleum[7] for his poetry. White, on the other hand, slowly fashioned his craft without the harsh judgement that some poets inflict on themselves. One of White's contemporaries, Robert Lowell, for example, complained that his(Lowell's) poems \"seemed like prehistoric monsters dragged down into the bog.\"[8] White's poetic edge seems lighter, humorous, easier on his psyche even in the late forties and fifties. By the seventies and eighties, then, White had refined his literary structures. He profited, it would appear, from that early education.\n\nÂ Â Â FORECAST\n\nEmily Dickinson had a way\n\nof passing every tidy day;\n\nhome, the hearthside and a cat,\n\nto pen a verse, she asked just that.\n\nMy home is bare,\n\nmy hearthside's cold,\n\nmy cat has mange,\n\nI'm growing old.\n\nWhat shall I do should all disperse?\n\nPen a verse, son, pen a verse.\n\nWhite was only sixteen at the time he wrote this. The wonderful poet Emily Dickinson had already made her mark on White's consciousness. Few Canadian youths at sixteen would have enjoyed the perspicacity to appreciate this enigmatic poet of the nineteenth century who, with Walt Whitman and Emerson, gave a poetic voice of some profundity to American society in that long and arduous century. White, who helped hundreds, perhaps thousands, of BahÃ¡'Ã­s in the 1980s and 1990s, most of whom had joined what one writer called this chrysalis global church in the period of its first six Teaching Plans 1937 to 1979, to articulate their own voice within the framework of the writings of their Faith. In the 1940s White was already defining his own voice. It was a voice that had little to do with the Brooklyn Dodgers, the New York Yankees or so much that was popular culture.[9] \"There is no clear window into the inner life of a person,\" wrote the philosopher Derrida, \"for any window is always filtered through the glaze of language, signs and the process of signification.\" [10]In these poems White gives us some of that glaze. He also gives us the very beginnings of that narrative identity which developed with the years into a tool of great power and strength and which is \"a task of the imagination, not a fait accompli.\"[11] This imagination empowered White to identify with the great range of historical personages, a process, an activity, I discuss in a later chapter.[12]\n\nI have included a second item of White's juvenilia here because it shows the kindness that was already a part of his style, his humour and his forgiving nature, and was also a part of his character, a character which endeared him to people until his death in 1993 and continues to do so through his poetry.\n\nÂ Â Â AND IN CLOSING\n\nNow that you have bruised my heart\n\nand, tiring, said that we must part,\n\nI'll smile your favourite smile and say,\n\n\"The gods be with you on your way,\"\n\nand brush aside remembering\n\nand wish you joy and everything\n\nthat's good.\n\nBut if your angel deems it wise\n\nto overcast your summer skies,\n\nand other lovelings whom you hold\n\nturn aside and leave you cold;\n\nif some small wraith of misery\n\nhaunts your nights with thought of me,\n\nthat's good!\n\nThere is self-disclosure here but it is oh so gentle, so indirect, so light. There is the humour, the surprise element, the delight. And this would be how the reader would come to know White and his poetry in the years ahead. The reader might have to draw on a dictionary now and then, for White was quite a wordsmith. He digs deeply below life's surface and into his large vocabulary and he requires, often, some patient study on the part of his readers. Such patience would yield a payoff, though; readers would come to know White as a friend. For many, they would learn something about the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith and life that could not be learned in the available commentaries on the Cause and in the burgeoning literature increasingly available. What I provide here in this brief biography will not detract, as biography often does, from the brilliant opacities that are many of White's poems.\n\nThe friendship that readers can enjoy is not to be based on personal acquaintance, reciprocity and having cups of tea in his home or theirs, but the kind of friendship that the Pythagoreans enjoyed, a friendship based on being part of a universal brotherhood--in the case of the Pythagoreans the universe of several Greek city states in the sixth century BC. These friends were assumed to be friends regardless of whether they knew each other. It would be a friendship not based on physical proximity or face-to-face meetings. It would be a friendship embedded in silence, in his poetry and the words of his letters. It would be a friendship that yielded no anecdotes, except those deriving from the printed word, from White's poetry. It would be a friendship characterized by sudden interruptions, sudden communications that commented in some unique way on the strangeness, the fascinating complexity, the surprising nature of human community and its existential dilemmas. Hearing not seeing is the condition of friendship for White, at least for most of those who are his readers. There is camaraderie; there is Voltairean irreverence and there is also a profound respect. In addition, people have a basic need to make evident their deepest feelings about life, part of everything they are and know. Readers of White, each in their different ways, felt they were partly satisfying this basic need in his poetry. For hundreds, thousands, of BahÃ¡'Ã­s it was a refreshing relationship, a relationship of self-discovery with the help of an art form that never ended. It could always be re-created.[13]\n\nWhite knew he could not heal the multitude of wounds people had who came near to his poetry. But as a friend he might help with understanding. I'm not so sure White was conscious of much of this at sixteen, in 1945, at the onset of his poetic experience. One poem he wrote, which first appeared in his Old Songs/New Songs, does go a long way to describe what he did know, where he was at, in his mid-to-late teens, say 1945 to 1950. It is called New Song. In it he refers to a certain cynicism that set in during these years. \"A clean, cold, wind\" left him feeling like \"a stripped young tree in autumn with a cynical winter setting in.\" This spiritual state, he goes on, left him with \"nothing large enough to house his impulse to believe.\"[14]\n\nWhite continues, though, and describes his psychological, his spiritual, condition in 1947 or 1948, when he first came across the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith in those meetings in Kingston Ontario that he began to attend:\n\nThe need lay as quiet, unhurried and insidious as a seed\n\nsnowlocked in a bleak and lonely landscape.\n\nThese words could very well describe the condition of the needs of millions of young men and women in their late teens(as well as many adults): quiet, unhurried, insidious, waiting Micauber-like for something to turn up, waiting for a sense of direction to emerge in their lives, waiting for some love which would sweep them off their feet, some career to give them some centering and some meaning. This is how White describes his early years of contact with this small group of BahÃ¡'Ã­s in Kingston:\n\nBut forgiveness came, an unsuspecting flooding rain\n\nand the seed was there, a promise kept.\n\nEven your rejection was forgiven\n\nand, in the burgeoning, lovesap slowly stirred.\n\nGod hadn't died, of course, abandoned us for Russia,\n\nnor moved to Uganda.\n\nThe lines are evocative and present a sensitive and humorous portrait of the first stirrings of White's beliefs, beliefs that would produce some of the finest poetry written by BahÃ¡'Ã­s about their experience in the second half of the first century of the Formative Age. In White there is an etiquette of expression. There is that tact which is a part of fine poetry. There is, too, a passionate, sympathetic, insightful, astute, attractive personality who often made the writing of others seem more important than his own.. Often only a fraction of the output of a poet is really first rate. In White's case the fraction is large.\n\nThe following poem take us back to even earlier years in White's life. Innocent Ogress,[15] refers to a period of \"cloudless years,\" probably his late childhood, 1937 to 1941, or early adolescence, 1942 to 1945. He focuses in this poem on these magic days of his early life, cloudless years\n\nwhen make-believe ran rampant\n\nand each young heart\n\nloved his private witch\n\nwho stoked delicious fears.\n\nIn this poem White describes a spinster in Belleville who lived alone in a big grey house. He writes:\n\nshe always wore one black gown\n\nso this woman was our witch\n\n........\n\nsuch adventures I remember we would have\n\ntrailing the old woman about\n\nshivering with sweet delightful fear.\n\n.....\n\nshe bound stray children into sacks\n\nand kept them in her basement\n\nbut, of course,\n\nwe never really caught her in the act.\n\nTwo other poems, in a collection of poetry published in 1981, give us some insight into White's life with his mother and father during his childhood and adolescence. In Memoriam: John Bernard White 1904-1971 does not tell us a great deal about his life with his father, although it reveals some of White's attitude to and understanding of his father, written perhaps a decade after his passing. Kathleen's Song,16 in that same 1981 collection called The Witness of Pebbles, tells us much more about a woman who coaxed him \"toward exultancy.\" She was the \"goodwife.\" She was \"Earth's God's-penny.\" Perhaps the following lines, the first ones in the poem, place his life with his mother in the most accurate perspective:\n\nLife is her cause and love her sole crusade.\n\nShe extols, proclaims, upholds them, knows them dear,\n\nDivine and indivisible. Many chilled with fear\n\nFind her warming fire.\n\nWhite's mother was a woman who held the \"key to recesses of hearts.\" She had an energy and joy that had an immeasurable affect on White's psychological and spiritual development. Perhaps it was in this critical relationship that White acquired his sensitivity and innocence, the same \"swift joy\" and the same \"uncunning generosity.\"\n\nI think it is useful to make one or two points about the poem White wrote about his father, In Memoriam: John Bernard White. Father and son relationships have long been characterized by far fewer words than the mother-son or mother-daughter relationship. White writes:\n\nFather, I am your book, you know me well\n\nYet said so little of this while you lived.\n\nThe mysteries that once held you time has sieved\n\nAnd memory surrenders you to tell\n\nThe words that man and boy may barely say.\n\nThis poem was written at some time in White's mid-to-late forties and shows an empathy, a wisdom, an identity with his father, a closeness only achieved, one safely assumes, with the passing of the years. Although the poem tells us little about White's early life in Canada it tells us a great deal about how White came to see these years and his father more than thirty years after he left home and nearly a decade after his father's death.\n\nFor all of us, though, our life story is always incomplete, partial, episodic. A man turns to poetry to provide experiential self-continuity. The poetry provides a sort of remobilization of memory in the service of living more effectively. It resurfaces the poet's life and gives a new depth to memory's story. White writes:\n\nI am your inmost essence, your hidden way.\n\nReplication of your heart's deep need;\n\nI voice your silent prayer, retrace your plan\n\nAnd sorrow for this lonely thing--a man.\n\nThe poet composes his life story over and over again, as we all do as we get older. White here is interpreting the reality of his relationship with his father, a reality that became quite a different thing in the light of his experience, in the light of his poetic and contemplative reflection on his life's narrative, his story. He continues:\n\nMy soul's map charts your bravest deed,\n\nBears imprint of your hope and conquered fears\n\nAnd love. Shamelessly I shed your unspent tears.\n\nI asked Roger once what he thought his father's \"bravest deed\" might be that his soul was charting. He said it might be the occasion when his father put his foot through the television screen when someone was talking about the Cause. White was impressed that his father could feel so strongly about the Faith. Imagination and critical reflection live in the house of the mind where White composes the definition of his reality, in this poem the reality of his relationship with his father. The friends that his critical reflection and imagination bring home are a source of great illumination. They produce, here, a poem of considerable insight.[17] White continues, as if speaking directly to his father:\n\nRegard your book--you know to Whom addressed\n\nAnd tell blind reader: is the ending blest?\n\nIn the end White is faced with mystery in his relationship with his father. So, too, is it in our own lives. We get a sense here of what it means to be a father, a person. What were his father's \"unspent years?\" Did White feel, at this juncture, while he wrote the poem, a \"homeless thing?\" Who knows? In some ways it does not matter. But there is little doubt that we all feel this way from time to time. The meaning of this poem, like all poems, whatever its sound or its structure, remains empty and a non-event to readers unless it touches the receiving mind. The receiving mind must be active in a certain way if a transmutation from a mere set of words on a page into an experience of meaning is to occur. This activity is part technique and part an \"inner ringing and singing\"[18] as the reader constructs a parallel world to the world constructed by the poet.\n\nIn a poem in a 1982 collection, Whitewash, White ponders his years in Belleville and whatever pleasures they offered to him as a growing boy--and it would appear they were for the most part pleasurable. He ponders these happy, cloudless, years in the context of another form of pleasure and ecstasy, that of martyrdom. White seems to be reflecting in this poem, Sweetmeat,19 on his life and the indifference of his society to the religion he joined. He contrasts his life with the experience of a person living in a society which would kill those who took an unorthodox path of belief:\n\nI would welcome contempt\n\nabove indifference\n\nIn that same 1982 collection, Whitewash, in a poem entitled Lines on Drowning, White refers to the lack of response to one's efforts to teach the Cause in a brilliant piece of analysis: \"how tiresome this pride which love nor hope nor irony convinces,/this will that will not will belief.\" Here was a man speaking from thirty-five years experience in, what for me, is one of his cleverest turns of phrase and one of his most accurate statements of an important area of BahÃ¡'Ã­ experience, both in his first twenty-five years of living and in the second twenty-five that was to come.\n\nI will have more to say about White's experience in school in a later chapter but, for now, let me say that for the most part White enjoyed school. He did not enjoy mathematics, metalwork or woodwork. The Catholic sisters were uniformly kind, gentle and pious. They all smelled faintly of disinfectant or witch hazel, a fact which perhaps contributed to their seeming interchangeableness and anonymity.\n\nBy 1947, at the age of eighteen, White was in the habit of visiting Kingston, the biggest city on the northeast shore of Lake Ontario. Kingston is at the point where Lake Ontario joins the St. Lawrence River at Thousand Islands. It was a natural attraction for a young man with a curious and adventurous spirit living in what was then the small country town of Belleville. Over the next five years, as the North American BahÃ¡'Ã­ community was completing its first temple in Chicago and its second Seven Year Plan, White got to know the small BahÃ¡'Ã­ community in Kingston. He also got to know some of the Ottawa BahÃ¡'Ã­s who travelled to Kingston on extension teaching trips. Winnifred Harvey was one such travel teacher. Doug Wilson and Cliff Huxtable were students at Queen's University in Kingston at the time.[20]\n\nFrom time to time he heard visiting speakers like Ruth Moffatt, Allan Raynor and Margaret and Larry Rowden. Eventually, a small BahÃ¡'Ã­ community grew up in Belleville: Margeurite Carter, William Connors, Helen Owens, Margaret Mann, Jack Campbell, James McLaughlin and Robert Cretney. These names are, for the most part, unknown now but, by 1954, a local Assembly was formed in Belleville. That same year Roger married Helen Owens.\n\nIn 1954 Roger also started working as a freelance court reporter and assistant editor of Hansard in Ottawa. This daily record of the debates in the Canadian House of Commons gave White an invaluable experience which helped him get a job in Vancouver in 1958 with the Supreme Court of British Columbia as a reporter and which helped to continue watering those poetic seeds that would eventually mature twenty to thirty years later in an extensive body of poetry.\n\nThere is no doubt, though, that White was a skilled craftsman with words is these early years. John Ward, in his book The Hansard Chronicles, says that White was \"acknowledged by his colleagues as one of the finest shorthand writers ever to serve the country. White gave up a promising career as a freelance journalist to join Hansard where he was for many years resident...\"[21]\n\nThe decade from 1947 to 1957 saw the beginning of White's poetic output. White produced a chapbook Summer Window in 1947. The poetry in this booklet may have gone back to earlier years. Further study of the White archive in Toronto and Haifa will tell future scholars more about the beginnings of White's poetic life in the 1940s. Job, marriage and the demands of early adulthood kept him busy. The total quantity of poetry that has come down to us from these years, at least that poetry now readily available for popular consumption and not requiring the resources of an archive, is slim. This, as yet unpublished, poem \"When the Gods Forsake Us,\"[22] provides a retrospective look at White's early-to-mid adolescence, the years to the end of WWII. Written five years before his passing, this poem gives us a window into his early youth in Toronto: age 14:\n\nÂ Â Â WHEN THE GODS FORSAKE US\n\nInexplicably disconsolate\n\nI reach for a forbidden cigarette\n\nout of a perverse loyalty to Paul Henreid\n\nwho sanctified the ritual of lighting up\n\nback in the days when the Surgeon General\n\nminded his own business.\n\nMost of my significant decisions\n\nwere made during matinees\n\nat the Alhambra, Danforth Avenue, 1943.\n\nFay Wray would have given that ape the slip\n\nif she'd known how much I loved her,\n\nageless in reruns.\n\nI'd never have torn her dress.\n\nThe casual slouch of Bogart's fedora,\n\nCary Grant's insouciant grin--\n\nthe mirror yawned at my worshipful impersonations.\n\nNo one warned me that the immortals would die.\n\nHave I mentioned that I'm still in mourning\n\nfor Leslie Howard and Vivien Leigh?\n\nIt's 1987 and friends in their 70s\n\nwho've forgotten Sonny Tufts\n\ncomplain that they're up\n\nseveral times in the night\n\nand hint at other dark indignities.\n\nI am inconsolable.\n\nDo not come to me\n\nsaying in the clipped tones of Bette Davis,\n\nWhat do you mean? Whatever do you mean?\n\nFor the years of his late adolescence and the earliest years of his adult life(1946-1952) we must also remain, scantily informed. All we get from these early years is the occasional poetic revelation into some aspect of the impressionable years of a Canadian youth and young adult who became, in the last dozen years of his adult life, a poet who defined and described the experience of BahÃ¡'Ã­s in the last half of the twentieth century, perhaps better than anyone else. The identity that White conferred on his readers was not so much his own, although he does give us a human and humorous taste, but theirs.\n\nIt did not concern White that he left little information about his life, any direct autobiographical detail, for to him the poet was not to be confused with the poem. If the reader wanted to know about the poet, about Roger White, White advised readers to study his poetry. Therein, he said, was his life. Although not explicitly autobiographical, poem after poem tells much about White. His autobiographical poetry is not, as Ann Goetting[23] argues in her study of the autobiographical process, some simple repetition of the past. His poetry is the presence of a spirit in a world now gone, the creation of a particular view of reality, reconstructed truth, fact and experience. This truth, this reality, is not always self-evident or even subject to proof. It often adds an element of seasoned consciousness to some original experience, an interpretation of life's processes. It was an expression of how White dealt with the life around him.\n\nCombining history and biography, much of White's poetry is a type of sociological imagination as C.Wright Mills described it back in 1959.[24] This imagination escapes the merely personal by surrenduring to the features of life's bigger picture; it escapes personality because the poet is only a medium, a vehicle, a vessel, a catalyst in the process of creation. This forces the critic to direct his attention to the poems not to the poet. T.S. Eliot called this the \"impersonal theory of poetry\"[25] and Goethe said it was part of the poet standing \"above art and the object\"[26] so as to utilize art and its many forms for his own purpose and deal with it in his own manner.\n\nWith Proust, White would have concurred that \"in reality, every reader is, while he is reading, the reader of his own self. The writer's work is merely a kind of optical instrument which he offers to the reader to enable him to discern what, without the book, he would never have preconceived in himself.\"[27] With Ortega y Gasset and the poet Wallace Stevens White saw himself as the poet of himself,[28] but he also provided a view, a philosophy of life.[29] It remained the task of his readers' to find themselves in his poetry. White was conscious, as we all are, of the incomplete, episodic nature of daily life. Poetry provided a source of experiential self-continuity; it remobilized his memory in the service of the living, of living more effectively; it provided freshness of surface and depth of meaning and retention.[30] It does the same for White's readers who travel with him in his poetry. For what readers see depends on what they bring to White's poetry and what they read depends on what they bring to the reading. Readers, in other words, create their own poetry through their own interpretive strategies \"as members of a larger community.\"[31] The interpretation of a poem is not so much the art of construing but the art of constructing. Poetry can penetrate deep into people's personal lives because in giving form to their worlds, it articulates their nature, sensibility, energy, passion, their life of feeling. For many White's poetry did just that.\n\nBefore we turn to White's poetry and the specific books of poetry that he had published, though, we will examine in the essay which follows his second twenty-five years: 1954-1979. It is difficult to draw on what some literary historians see as a developmental model for my study of White. Early, Middle and Late can be comfortably applied to White, but I'm not sure how useful such a division into periods of writing is in White's case.[32] Like the theories of developmental psychology: Freud, Erikson, Piaget, et al., whose application is complex and still unfolding their relevance to students in the field of psychology, this chronological development model applied to White's poetry could be a study in itself. For my purposes, though, these three stages simply provide an outline, a broad chronologic"
