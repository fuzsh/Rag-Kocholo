        "text": "There is a rumour going around that I have found god. I think is unlikely because I have enough difficulty finding my keys, and there is empirical evidence that they exist.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\n“I create gods all the time — now I think one might exist,” Daily Mail (21 Jun 2008)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nI don’t have much truck with the “religion is the cause of most of our wars” school of thought because that is manifestly done by mad, manipulative and power-hungry men who cloak their ambition in God.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\n“I create gods all the time — now I think one might exist,” Daily Mail (21 Jun 2008)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nIt’s that moment, that brief epiphany when the universe opens up and shows us something, and in that instant we get just a sense of an order greater than Heaven and, as yet at least, beyond the grasp of Stephen Hawking. It doesn’t require worship, but, I think, rewards intelligence, observation and enquiring minds. I don’t think I’ve found God, but I may have seen where gods come from.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\n“I create gods all the time — now I think one might exist,” Daily Mail (21 Jun 2008)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nIf you said to a bunch of average people two hundred years ago “Would you be happy in a world where medical care is widely available, houses are clean, the world’s music and sights and foods can be brought into your home at small cost, travelling even 100 miles is easy, childbirth is generally not fatal to mother or child, you don’t have to die of dental abcesses and you don’t have to do what the squire tells you” they’d think you were talking about the New Jerusalem and say ‘yes’.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\n(Attributed)\n\nUsually cited to alt.fan.pratchett, but not found in the repository.\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nIn all seriousness, people think that it’s the ideas that are important. Well, everyone has ideas, all the time. I tend to write mine down and remember them, but at some point you have to apply the bum to the seat and knock out about sixty five thousand words — that’s how long a novel is.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\n(Attributed)\n\nSource unknown.\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nI’d rather be a rising ape than a falling angel.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\n(Frequent Phrase)\n\nPratchett used this phrase and variations on it on numerous occasions. Here are a few:\n\nHumans need fantasy to be human. To be the place where the falling angel meets the rising ape.\n\n-- Hogfather (1996)\n\nWho would not rather be a rising ape than a falling angel.\n\n-- \"I create gods all the time,\" Daily Mail (2008-06-21)\n\n\"I'd much rather be a rising ape than a fallen angel\"\n\n-- Guardian Book Club Q&A video, 7:19 Guardian (2009-12-19)\n\nSee also F. H. Knelman's essay, \"Probing Man's True Nature\" in 1984 And All That, Sec. 3 (1971):\n\nIn the last few years science has been racked by vexing questions concerning the nature of man. The fallen angel has departed and the rising ape appeared.\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nWhy do you go away? So that you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors. And the people there see you differently, too. Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nA Hat Full of Sky (2004)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nThere isn’t a way things should be. There’s just what happens, and what we do.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nA Hat Full of Sky [Miss Level] (2004)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\n[I]t was followed by a long scream of rage mixed with a roar of complaint: “AAaargwannawannaaaagongongonaargggaaaaBLOON!” which is the traditional sound of a very small child learning that with balloons, as with life itself, it is important to know when not to let go of the string. The whole point of balloons is to teach small children this.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nA Hat Full of Sky, ch. 11 “Arthur” (2004)\n\n(Source)\n\nThis is apparently the origin of the much more frequently found paraphrase:\n\nThere are times in life when people must know when not to let go. Balloons are designed to teach small children this.\n\nThis shorter form has been used, among other places, in a Change.org petition to Death to reinstate Pratchett after the author's passing. It is possible Pratchett may have used it somewhere else, but I am unable to find it (it does not show up in the alt.fan.pratchett board in any message from him).\n\nSee also Cox.\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\n“And sin, young man, is when you treat people like things. Including yourself. That’s what sin is.”\n\n“It’s a lot more complicated than that –”\n\n“No. It ain’t. When people say things are a lot more complicated than that, they means they’re getting worried that they won’t like the truth. People as things, that’s where it starts.”\n\n“Oh, I’m sure there are worse crimes –”\n\n“But they starts with thinking about people as things …”\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nCarpe Jugulum [Granny Weatherwax, Rev. Mightily Oats] (1998)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\n“It’s not as simple as that. It’s not a black and white issue. There are so many shades of grey.”\n\n“Nope.”\n\n“Pardon?”\n\n“There’s no greys, only white that’s got grubby.”\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nCarpe Jugulum [Rev. Mightily Oats, Granny Weatherwax] (1998)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nTHERE ARE BETTER THINGS IN THE WORLD THAN ALCOHOL, ALBERT.\n\n“Oh, yes, sir. But alcohol sort of compensates for not getting them.”\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nDeath’s Domain (1999)\n\n(Source)\n\nDeath speaking with his manservant, Albert.\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nThe trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nDiggers, ch. 3 (1990)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nAnd the funny thing was that people who weren’t entirely certain they were right always argued much louder than other people, as if the main person they were trying to convince were themselves.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nDiggers, ch. 4 (1990)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nShe was already learning that if you ignore the rules people will, half the time, quietly rewrite them so that they don’t apply to you.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nEqual Rites (1987)\n\n(Source)\n\nOf the character Eskarina \"Esk\" Smith, modeled after Pratchett's daughter, Rhianna.\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nAnimals never spend time dividing experience into little bits and speculating about all the bits they’ve missed. The whole panoply of the universe has been neatly expressed to them as things to (a) mate with, (b) eat, (c) run away from, and (d) rocks. This frees the mind from unnecessary thoughts and gives it a cutting edge where it matters.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nEqual Rites (1987)\n\n(Source)\n\nFrequently paraphrased:\n\nThe entire universe has been neatly divided into things to (a) mate with, (b) eat, (c) run away from, and (d) rocks.\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nThey say a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, but it’s not one half so bad as a lot of ignorance.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nEqual Rites [Granny Weatherwax] (1987)\n\n(Source)\n\nAfter Pope.\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nJust erotic. Nothing kinky. It’s the difference between using a feather and using a chicken.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nEric (1990)\n\n(Source)\n\nCompare to Isabel Allende.\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nBringing about Armageddon can be dangerous. Do not attempt it in your own home.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nGood Omens, “Caveat” (1990) [with Neil Gaiman]\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nCrowley (An Angel who did not so much Fall as Saunter Vaguely Downwards)\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nGood Omens, “Dramatis Personae” (1990) [with Neil Gaiman]\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\n“You’ve got to admit it’s a bit of a pantomime, though,” said Crawly. “I mean, pointing out the Tree and saying ‘Don’t Touch’ in big letters. Not very subtle, is it? I mean, why not put it on top of a high mountain or a long way off? Makes you wonder what He’s really planning.”\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nGood Omens, 1. “In the Beginning” (1990) [with Neil Gaiman]\n\n(Source)\n\nReferring to the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil (Gen. 2:16-17).\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nGod moves in extremely mysterious, not to say, circuitous ways. God does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of His own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other players (i.e., everybody), to being involved in an obscure and complex version of poker in a pitch-dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won’t tell you the rules, and who smiles all the time.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nGood Omens, 2. “Eleven Years Ago” (1990) [with Neil Gaiman]\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nIt may help to understand human affairs to be clear that most of the great triumphs and tragedies of history are caused, not by people being fundamentally good or fundamentally bad, but by people being fundamentally people.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nGood Omens, 2. “Eleven Years Ago” (1990) [with Neil Gaiman]\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nCrowley had always known that he would be around when the world ended, because he was immortal and wouldn’t have any alternative. But he hoped it was a long way off.\n\nBecause he rather liked people.\n\nIt was major failing in a demon. Oh, he did his best to make their short lives miserable, because that was his job, but nothing he could think up was half as bad as the stuff they thought up themselves. They seemed to have a talent for it. It was built into the design, somehow. They were born into a world that was against them in a thousand little ways, and then devoted most of their energies to making it worse. Over the years Crowley had found it increasingly difficult to find anything demonic to do which showed up against the natural background of generalized nastiness. There had been times, over the past millennium, when he’d felt like sending a message back Below saying, Look we may as well give up right now, we might as well shut down Dis and Pandemonium and everywhere and move up here, there’s nothing we can do to them that they don’t do to themselves and they do things we’ve never even thought of, often involving electrodes. They’ve got what we lack. They’ve got imagination. And electricity, of course.\n\nOne of them had written it, hadn’t he … “Hell is empty, and all the devils are here.”\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nGood Omens, 2. “Eleven Years Ago” (1990) [with Neil Gaiman]\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nMost of the members of the convent were old-fashioned Satanists, like their parents and grandparents before them. They’d been brought up to it and weren’t, when you got right down to it, particularly evil. Human beings mostly aren’t. They just get carried away by new ideas, like dressing up in jackboots and shooting people, or dressing up in white sheets and lynching people, or dressing up in tie-dye jeans and playing guitars at people. Offer people a new creed with a costume and their hearts and minds will follow.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nGood Omens, 2. “Eleven Years Ago” (1990) [with Neil Gaiman]\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nHe’d been an angel once. He hadn’t meant to Fall. He’d just hung around with the wrong people.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nGood Omens, 2. “Eleven Years Ago” (1990) [with Neil Gaiman]\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nCrowley thumped the wheel.

There is said to be a code in the number and placement of the horse’s hooves: If one of the horse’s hooves is in the air, the rider was wounded in battle; two legs in the air means that the rider was killed in battle; three legs in the air indicates that the rider got lost on the way to the battle; and four legs in the air means that the sculptor was very, very clever. Five legs in the air means that there’s probably at least one other horse standing behind the horse you’re looking at; and the rider lying on the ground with his horse lying on top of him with all four legs in the air means that the rider was either a very incompetent horseman or owned a very bad-tempered horse.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nI Shall Wear Midnight (2010)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nWhatever happens, they say afterwards, it must have been fate.

It had been finding out that governments were not, on the whole, staffed by people who had a grip, and that plans were what people made instead of thinking.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nNight Watch (2002)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nWhen he was a boy, he’d read books about great military campaigns, and visited museums and had looked with patriotic pride at the paintings of famous cavalry charges, last stands, and glorious victories. It had come as rather a shock, when he later began to participate in some of these, to find that the painters had unaccountably left out the intestines. Perhaps they just weren’t very good at them.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nNight Watch (2002)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\n“Huh! Priests!” said Mr. Shoe. “They’re all the same. Always telling you that you’re going to live again after you’re dead, but you just try it and see the look on their faces!”\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nReaper Man (1991)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nIt was later that the story of Windle Poons really came to an end, if “story” means all that he did and caused and set in motion. In the Ramtop village where they dance the real Morris dance, for example, they believe that no one is finally dead until the ripples they cause in the world die away — until the clock he wound up winds down, until the wine she made has finished its ferment, until the crop they planted is harvested. The span of someone’s life, they say, is only the core of their actual existence.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nReaper Man (1991)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\n“Yo!” said the Dean.\n\n“Yo what?” said Ridcully.\n\n“It’s not a yo what, it’s just a yo,” said the Senior Wrangler, behind him. “It’s a general street greeting and affirmative with convivial military ingroup and masculine bonding-ritual overtones.”\n\n“What? What? Like ‘jolly good’?” said Ridcully.\n\n“I suppose so,” said the Senior Wrangler, reluctantly.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nReaper Man (1991)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nLight thinks it travels faster than anything but it is wrong.

Ridcully was simple-minded. This doesn’t mean stupid. It just meant that he could only think properly about things if he cut away all the complicated bits around the edges.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nReaper Man, ch. 17 (1991)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\n“You’re not one of us.”\n\n“I don’t think I’m one of them, either,” said Brutha. “I’m one of mine.”\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nSmall Gods (1992)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nHis philosophy was a mixture of three famous schools — the Cynics, the Stoics and the Epicureans — and summed up all three of them in his famous phrase, “You can’t trust any bugger further than you can throw him, and there’s nothing you can do about it, so let’s have a drink.”\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nSmall Gods (1992)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nTime is a drug. Too much of it kills you.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nSmall Gods (1992)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nWhat have I always believed? That on the whole, and by and large, if a man lived properly, not according to what any priests said, but according to what seemed decent and honest inside, then it would, at the end, more or less, turn out all right.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nSmall Gods (1992)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nGoodness is about what you do.

Satchelmouth had been made aware that he had a soul and, though it had a few holes in it and was a little ragged around the edges, he cherished the hope that some day the god Reg would find him a place in a celestial combo. You didn’t get the best gigs if you were a murderer. You probably had to play the viola.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nSoul Music (1994)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nYou could say to the universe this is not fair.

If it was well done and maybe had a slice of tomato.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nThe Fifth Elephant (1999)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nA marriage is always made up of two people who are prepared to swear that only the other one snores.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nThe Fifth Elephant (1999)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nBut still, one of the most basic rules for survival on any planet is never to upset someone wearing black leather.*\n\n*This is why protesters against the wearing of animal skins by humans unaccountably fail to throw their paint over Hell’s Angels.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nThe Last Continent (1998)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\n“Is it true that your life passes before your eyes before you die?”\n\nYES.\n\n“Ghastly thought, really.” Rincewind shuddered. “Oh, gods, I’ve just had another one. Suppose I am about to die and this is my whole life passing in front of my eyes?”\n\nI THINK PERHAPS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND. PEOPLE’S WHOLE LIVES DO PASS IN FRONT OF THEIR EYES BEFORE THEY DIE.

No one goes mad quicker than a totally sane person.”\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nThe Light Fantastic (1986)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nBe careful. People like to be told what they already know. Remember that. They get uncomfortable when you tell them new things. New things … well, new things aren’t what they expect. They like to know that, say, a dog will bite a man. That is what dogs do. They don’t want to know that man bites a dog, because the world is not supposed to happen like that. In short, what people think they want is news, but what they really crave is olds … Not news but olds, telling people that what they think they already know is true.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nThe Truth [Lord Vetinari] (2000)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\n“Now … if you trust in yourself …”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“… and believe in your dreams …”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“… and follow your star …” Miss Tick went on.\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“… you’ll still be beaten by people who spent their time working hard and learning things and weren’t so lazy.”\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nThe Wee Free Men (2003)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nThem as can do has to do for them as can’t.

Of course someone would be that stupid. Some humans would do anything to see if it was possible to do it.

In fact no gods anywhere play chess. They haven’t got the imagination. Gods prefer simple, vicious games, where you Do Not Achieve Transcendence but Go Straight To Oblivion; a key to the understanding of all religion is that a god’s idea of amusement is Snakes and Ladders with greased rungs.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948-2015) English author\n\nWyrd Sisters (1988)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Pratchett, Terry\n\nThe suggestion that the world could be completely other than it is always annoys those who are content with the way things are.
