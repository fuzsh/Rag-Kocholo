He is best known as being the sire of the 1977 Triple Crown winner, Seattle Slew.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nBold Reasoning was foaled in Florida. He was out of the Hail To Reason mare Reason To Earn, by the Santa Anita Derby winner Boldnesian, a son of Bold Ruler.\n\nRacing career\n\n[edit]\n\nBold Reasoning recorded his most important successes as a three-year-old in 1971, winning the Jersey Derby and the Withers Stakes. He set a new track record at Belmont Park for six furlongs as a four-year-old in 1972.\n\nStud record\n\n[edit]\n\nUpon retirement, Bold Reasoning only produced three crops of foals at Claiborne Farm before his death on April 24, 1975, due to a breeding shed accident in which he cracked his pelvis. He had to be euthanized after the injury caused severe colic.[1] He sired Seattle Slew in his first crop of foals and the top-rated French two-year-old Super Concorde in his second."
