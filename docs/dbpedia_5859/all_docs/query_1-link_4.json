        "text": "Alan Porter’s 2024 Breeding Analysis for Arabian Lion\n\nThe only grade one winning son on dirt of Triple Crown winner Justify, Arabian Lion took the Woody Stephens Stakes with 109 Beyer, and is also a stakes winner around two turns. He’s out of a stakes performing Distorted Humor mare from the great family of Personal Ensign.\n\nOut of A.P. Indy line mares, Justify has stakes winners from daughters of the similarly-bred Tapit and Bernardini. Tapit is by Pulpit, who is out of Preach, where Justify is inbred to the sisters Yarn and Preach. Tapit can be brought in through Constitution, Frosted, Cupid, Tonalist, Trappe Shot, Tapiture and Tapizar. Pulpit is also sire of Sky Mesa (broodmare sire of a grade one winner by Scat Daddy, the sire of Justify), Flashback, Mr. Speaker (who gives inbreeding to Personal Ensign), Corinthian and Stroll. Bernardini could be brought in through Stay Thirsty or To Honor and Serve.\n\nContinuing with the A.P. Indy line, graded stakes winner Azar is by Scat Daddy out of a mare by A.P. Indy son, Mineshaft (bred on the same cross as Pulpit, and himself sire of Discreetly Mine and Dialed In). This also suggests mares by A.P. Indy sons, Flatter, Congrats, Malibu Moon, Stephen Got Even, Jump Start and Majestic Warrior.\n\nJustify has the brilliant European two-year-old filly Ramatuelle out of a mare by Raven’s Pass (by Elusive Quality sire of Quality Road, Smarty Jones and Great Notion) and a graded stakes winner out of a mare by Proud Citizen, both from the Gone West line, and Scat Daddy has a graded stakes winner out of a mare by Grand Slam, as well as a stakes winner out of a mare by that horse’s son, Strong Hope. It would also be possible to try mares by Mr. Greeley (sire of El Corredor) and by Speightstown and his son, Munnings.\n\nGone West is from the Mr. Prospector line, and Scat Daddy has enjoyed considerable success with mares from the Fappiano branch of that line. He has graded winners out of mares by Unbridled’s Song and Empire Maker and stakes winners out of mares by Broken Vow and Niigon, all by Unbridled. From mares by sons of Unbridled’s Song, there is also a grade one winner out of a mare by Buddha, and graded winners from daughters of Rockport Harbor, First Defence and Songandaprayer. This also suggests trying daughters of such as Cross Traffic, Midshipman, Even the Score, Half Ours and Old Fashioned. Empire Maker is sire of Pioneerof the Nile (himself sire of American Pharoah and Classic Empire) and Bodemeister. There are also Scat Daddy stakes winners out of mare by Fappiano sons Rubiano (sire of Too Much Bling and Burning Roma) and A.P. Jet, and mares by Quiet American and his grandson, Midnight Lute, could also be considered.\n\nScat Daddy has a pair of grade one winners out of a mare by Street Cry (sire of Street Sense). There is a grade two winner out of a mare by Smart Strike, two graded stakes winners by Scat Daddy sons out of mares by Smart Strike son English Channel, and another out of a mare by Smart Strike son Curlin, which suggests mares by Lookin At Lucky. From other branches of the Mr. Prospector line, there are Scat Daddy line graded stakes winners out of mares by Afleet (sire of Northern Afleet and grandsire of Afleet Alex), Not For Love and Thunder Gulch (and a stakes winner out of a mare by his son Point Given). There are also stakes winners out of mares by Smoke Glacken, Seeking the Gold (sire of Mutakddim, Petionville and Cape Town) and Lemon Drop Kid.\n\nJustify is sire of graded winner Learning to Fly out of a mare by Fastnet Rock, a son of Danehill, and stakes winner Legacies, out of a mare by another Danehill son, Danehill Dancer. There are also Scat Daddy line stakes winners out of mares by Danehill sons, Exceed and Excel, Rock of Gibraltar, Kodiac and Oratorio.\n\nDanehill is a son of Danzig and the cross of Scat Daddy and sons over Danzig line mares has been a prolific one with more than 20 stakes winners. This aslo includes grade one winners out of mares by Hard Spun, Boundary (sire of Big Brown), Oasis Dream (by Green Desert) as well as graded winners out of mares by Belong to Me and War Chant, and a stakes winner out of a mare by Langfuhr. Mares by War Front and sons, and Exchange Rate could also work.\n\nJustify already has three stakes winners, two graded out of mares by Galileo (represented in the U.S. by Magician and Cape Blanco) and a graded stakes winner out of a mare by Galileo’s sire Sadler’s Wells. Overall the Scat Daddy/Sadler’s Wells cross mares has been a very successful one, including a grade one winner out of a mare by Powerscourt and a grade one winner out of a mare by Borrego (by El Prado, sire of Medaglia d’Oro, Kitten’s Joy and Artie Schiller). There is also a graded stakes winner by Medaglia d’Oro son, Bolt d’Oro out of a sister to the dam of Arabian Lion, which also suggests mares by Violence. There are also two graded stakes winners out of High Chaparral. Justify has also sired a group winner out of mares by Pivotal from the sire line of Sadler’s Wells’ three-quarters brother, Nureyev. From that line Scat Daddy has a stakes winner out of a mare by Peintre Celebre and Nureyev sources in the U.S. include Theatrical, Fasliyev and Spinning World.\n\nFrom other branches of Northern Dancer, Justify has graded stakes winner Verifying out of a mare by Repent, a son of Louis Quatorze, from the male line of Sovereign Dancer, a Northern Dancer/Bold Ruler cross, like Justify’s male line ancestor, Storm Cat. There are also already two stakes winners by Justify from the Giant’s Causeway branch of his own Storm Cat male line. Among sons of Giant’s Causeway are Not This Time, Eskendereya, First Samurai, Creative Cause, Brody’s Cause, Carpe Diem and Hold Me Back.\n\nJustify’s grade one winner, Aspen Grove, is out of a mare by More Than Ready (sire of Ready’s Image, Verrazano and Daredevil) a grandson of Halo. The Scat Daddy line has done well with Halo in general, including graded stakes winners out of mares by Sunriver and Saint Liam, sons of Saint Ballado (also sire of Yankee Victor, Captain Bodgit, Sweetsouthernsaint and Straight Man), and a graded winners from a daughters of Sunny’s Halo and Lively One. Halo is a Hail to Reason line horse, and from the Roberto branch of that line, there are Scat Daddy line graded stakes winner out of a mares by Arch (sire of Blame) and Dynaformer (sire of Temple City, Point of Entry and Brilliant Speed).\n\nThere is a Scat Daddy grade one winner out of a mare by Monarchos (by Maria’s Mon, also sire of Super Saver). There is a grade one winner out of a mare by Holy Bull (sire of Macho Uno and Flashy Bull) and stakes winners out of mares by Honour and Glory (sire of Put it Back) and In Excess (sire of Indian Charlie, Notional and Bring the Heat, and grandsire of Uncle Mo, Adios Charlie, Bwana Charlie and Liaison).\n\nAlan Porter’s 2024 Breeding Analysis for Arabian Lion\n\nThe only grade one winning son on dirt of Triple Crown winner Justify, Arabian Lion took the Woody Stephens Stakes with 109 Beyer, and is also a stakes winner around two turns.
