        "text": "DAWN had pierced the cool darkness, suddenly turning the sky to pink and purple above the stables at Hialeah Race Track. The sun must have felt good as it warmed the coat of the brown colt who had just been led out from the center stall in Barn M, his home for 23 hours a day. He arched his neck toward the sun as Philip Gleaves, his exercise rider, swung into the saddle and steered him onto the path that cuts through the palm trees and on to the race track.\n\nFor 29 days, the colt had walked this path to the track for his daily gallop, once or twice around the mile-and-an-eighth Hialeah oval with his rider pulling back hard on the reins to keep him at a slow clip. But now the colt was in for a mild surprise halfway through his 30th morning gallop at Hialeah.\n\nAs he rounded the stretch turn, he felt the bit go loose in his mouth as Gleaves let less than an inch of slack out of the reins. The colt responded eagerly, now setting each foot down a fraction of a second sooner and more forcefully than before, suddenly picking up moderate speed for half a mile.\n\nFifty-two seconds later it was over, the reins pulled tight again as on other mornings, and the colt slipped back into a slow gallop. It had been only a fleeting variation in his routine. But those 52 seconds when he was allowed to run a little last Monday marked the beginning of what may be the most keenly awaited campaign by a race horse in more than a decade.\n\nThe colt was Devil's Bag, and as he works toward his first race as a 3-year-old, he is looking like the state of the art that began more than two centuries ago, when British sportsmen first bred their sturdy mares to fast Arabian stallions to produce thoroughbred race horses. Everything Devil's Bag has done since he first stepped onto a race track less than a year ago suggests he could exceed all who have run before him.\n\nAs a 2-year-old last year, he became the most valuable horse ever at that age, having been sold last month to a syndicate of breeders under a plan that sets his value at $36 million. He raced as impressively and often faster than any 2-year-old before him, winning all five of his starts with disarming ease and turning in the kind of fast times that point out the great ones. He did it all without having been whipped or even mildly encouraged to run his fastest.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
