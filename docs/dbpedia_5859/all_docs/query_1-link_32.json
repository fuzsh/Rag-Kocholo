        "text": "The names and stories of the men and women who were primary caregivers to thoroughbreds, whether great champions or hard-working horses who ran on local racetracks, are largely unknown. Since many of these people were perceived as menial workers employed in the stables of the wealthy, they were overlooked by turf writers and the general public. However, even though fragmentary, a few stories of thoroughbreds and the men who loved them have come down to us from the past.\n\nOne such narrative fragment concerns Will Harbut and the legendary Man O’ War.\n\nThe Latin “texere” from which the word “text” derives means texture and was first used to describe the process of weaving textiles. There is a kind of lovely rapport between the concept of storytelling and weaving. Both involve the choice of a pattern, colour and intricate stitchery that produces a design. And both are human endeavours that seek to warm, beautify and inspire.\n\nIt is in that spirit that we offer you another narrative of Will and his big, copper-red stallion.\n\nAs frequent readers of THE VAULT know, I have long been a collector of old thoroughbred photographs. Many years ago now, I found this image of Will and Man O’ War. Unlike the version of the Meadors photo above, the one I purchased has a ‘whited out” background, so that only man, horse and a portion of the ground they walk upon are depicted. What transfixed me about the “revised” rendering of the famous Meadors photo is that Man O’ War and the man he loved have been pulled out of time. There is no car or other visual cue to bind them to a specific time or place. Will and Man O’ War appear deep in communion and their intimacy fills the eye.\n\nWill Harbut was born in 1885 and as a young man, moved to Maddoxtown, where he built one of its first houses on the land he purchased. Maddoxtown was one of many “free towns” that sprung up in Kentucky after the Civil War where freed men and women could settle, farm and raise their families. The South of the pre-Civil War was a place where landowners and slaves contributed to a thriving economy. As we understand today, the master-slave relationship was a very complex one and, with the emancipation, was forced into a state of social upheaval that saw newly-liberated men, women and children leaving homesteads and flocking into Southern cities. And just as suddenly, these families found themselves homeless and jobless. In an attempt to restore social and economic order, the state of Kentucky opened free towns to Afro-Americans as a means of attracting them to rural areas where they would find some measure of security and employment.\n\nThe residents of Maddoxtown farmed their land, while also working on the horse farms of the Bluegrass. As such, they were simply continuing a tradition of long-standing, since Afro-American men had cared for and ridden Kentucky thoroughbreds in the pre-Civil War era. Their contribution to thoroughbred history had been vital and important: 12 of the 15 jockeys who rode in the very first Kentucky Derby were Afro-Americans and thoroughbreds carrying Afro-American riders would wear the roses 15 times over the next 28 years. Men from the free towns around Lexington also served as trainers, as well as grooms, passing on their thoroughbred expertise from father-to-son.\n\nWill Harbut’s Maddoxtown home, where he and his wife, Mary, raised their 12 children, faces out onto the rolling pastures of the world’s thoroughbred heartland. On any given morning, Will could stand on his porch and watch bands of thoroughbreds grazing and rollicking in the lush bluegrass. By the time he was hired by farm manager Harry/Harrie B. Scott, Will Harbut had already gotten the reputation for being a fine horseman and, some said, a horse whisperer. And when Scott was asked to run the operations at Faraway Farm in 1930, he took Will with him.\n\nMan O’ War had been at stud for over a decade when Will Harbut walked into his life. His stud career had started off at Elizabeth Daingerfield’s Hinata Farm, outside Lexington. Daingerfield was a consummate horsewoman and an expert breeder. She went on to purchase and set up Faraway Farm for Riddle and served as its manager until 1930, when Scott took over. So it was that Will became Man O’ War’s new stud groom and the two would be together, each and every day, for more than 15 years.\n\nWill had never seen Man O’ War race, but at the time he became the stallion’s handler he certainly knew he was rubbing a living legend. Did Will also know that he had just met his soul mate, a thoroughbred who would make Will his (equine) family? Perhaps not in that first meeting, but I would wager that it wasn’t long before both horse and man knew that they had found the truest expression of themselves in the light of the other’s eye.\n\nMan O’ War was the kind of thoroughbred that brought you closer to divinity than most people had ever been before.\n\nThe magnificent chestnut had an indomitable will and an almost uncanny sense of his own power. The starter of the Travers Stakes the year Man O’ War ran, said this of him,” …[he was] so beautiful it made you want to cry, and so full of fire you thanked your God you could come close to him.” Joe H. Palmer, the celebrated turf writer, said, ” He was as near to a living flame as horses ever get, and horses get closer to this than anything else…It was that even when he was standing motionless in his stall, with his ears pricked forward, and his eyes focused on something above the horizon which mere people never see, energy still poured from him. He could get in no position which suggested actual repose, and his very stillness was that of a coiled spring, of the crouched tiger…”\n\nHere is live footage of Man O’ War that allows us a glimpse of him in all of his glory:\n\nMan O’ War probably found his life as a breeding stallion far more satisfactory than he did the highly structured and controlled life of a race horse. Intelligent and high strung by nature, life on the farm offered Big Red great distractions, as well as time to churn up his paddock on a regular basis, kicking up sod as though he were being chased by a predator. For his part, Will Harbut provided a firm and loving hand and a routine that made Big Red feel secure and happy within himself. The man who had broken more thoroughbreds than he could count and who owned not one, but two teams of draft horses understood the equine soul. And, as a father of 12, there was probably little Man O’ War could do that would surprise him.\n\nWill Harbut had a rich, melodic voice and wide, smooth hands. According to Will’s son, Tom Harbut, it wasn’t long before his father and Man O’ War became as one. Of his father, Tom had this to say when interviewed by D. Cameron Lawrence for an article published in the October 2006 issue of Kentucky Humanities, ” He was well respected and I admired him for his accomplishments because for one thing, he was closer to the slave era. At that time, he wasn’t allowed to read or write. And to get where he did was amazing.”\n\nWill was Man O’ War’s everything, the first face he saw in the morning and the last he saw at night. Will fed him, bathed him, mucked out his stall, groomed him, hand-walked him, brought him water and turned him out into his paddock. It was Will who brought him to the breeding shed or led him out to meet the steady stream of admirers who came to visit. And it was Will who reminded him to be gentle with the children that brought him a carrot or a lump of sugar and Will who admonished him to behave himself, which he did by snapping the shank and demanding, “Stand still, Red” or “Stop fidgeting, Red” or “Stop messin’ around, Red.”\n\nHaving a best friend like Will Harbut also assured the champion some privacy and respect. Samuel Riddle was most generous in allowing fans access to Man O’ War, for Faraway Farm was open to visitors every day from 9 a.m. – 4 p.m. Although he greeted over a million visitors, Will refused to wake the stallion up if visitors arrived when the horse was napping, telling them rather curtly, ” When Man O’ War wants to get up, he get up. And when he wants to lie down, he lie down.” If it was time for Man O’ War to be fed, Will would shoo people away and ask them to wait. If the stallion was out in his paddock and if Red appeared to be inviting company, Will might take one or two people right up to him. Although dignitaries from all walks of life, including film star Jeanette MacDonald, Henry M. Leland (founder of Cadillac Co.), Lord Halifax and government officials visited on a regular basis, Will never distinguished between famous and average folks. Everyone was treated with the same respect and everyone was made to understand that the only dignitary at Faraway was Man O’ War himself and, as time went on, his sons.\n\nIt was during these public visits that Will became famous for giving Man O’ War a voice. When visitors arrived, they first received a tour of Faraway Farm and some of its other equine superstars and, when anticipation had mounted enough to make even the hardiest mouth go dry, Will would disappear into the small barn to emerge with Red. As men and women gaped, Man O’ War struck what was to become an archetypal pose — head held high, muscles rippling under his copper coat, feet firmly planted and eyes that looked away, towards the horizon.\n\nIf he judged his audience worthy, Will would tell them a story or two. To be thus acknowledged, Will needed to feel that his visitors were in awe of the champion. Otherwise, he led the stallion out, waited a bit and then led him back to his stall. But whether or not Will so acknowledged you, a visit with Man O’ War always began with, “Folks, this is Man O’ War. He’s the greatest horse that ever lived. He’s the most and he’s going to go on being the most as long as you and I can tell about it.” Although he was famous for his declaration that Man O’ War was “… just the mostest horse,” Will spun a whole anthology of tales for his rapt listeners, holding the mighty stallion on a loose shank with one hand. His stories were never exactly the same and when he was storying, Will talked as much to Red as he did to his admirers. And Red always listened, punctuating the anecdotes with nods, nickers or snorts.\n\nIn most of the popular photos of Will and Man O’ War, the two are posing. But what was lovely about the shots taken in 1941 by Ivan Dmitri for the cover of The Saturday Evening Post (below) was the way they articulated Will and his horse ….. or, Man O’ War with his Will.\n\nThe famous cover shot would also inspire equine artist, Fred Stone, whose collectors’ plate, “Forever Friends” remains one of his most popular. Had they seen Stone’s plate, neither Will nor Man O’ War would have been surprised. The most famous photographers, artists and sculptors of the day immortalized the champion, who stood for sittings patiently because Will was almost always at his side.\n\nEven though Man O’ War, unlike most thoroughbreds, found the love of his life after retirement, there came a day when Will did not come to Faraway Farm. In 1946, Red’s best friend was the victim of a stroke that left him partially paralyzed and blind. Joe Palmer, writing of Big Red’s upcoming birthday that year, began this way, “When Man O’ War celebrates his next birthday here the party will have already been spoiled. Will Harbut, the groom who tended the big red stallion for nearly 20 years, was stricken with an attack which has at least temporarily deprived him of his sight as well as his powers of motion.” He went on to say, talking about Will’s legendary stories of Man O’ War’s exploits, “…It was, indeed, a full-blown and well-flavored narrative, now apparently never to be told again, for Will’s chances of complete recovery seem slight…It has for years been a half-jesting comment in Lexington that neither Man O’ War nor Will Harbut would be able to live without the other, and the jest is now getting a little bitter…”\n\nPalmer’s observations proved prophetic.\n\nWill Harbut died on October 3, 1947. His obituary in The Blood Horse listed among his survivors his wife, six sons, three daughters and Man O’ War.\n\nLess than a month later, as photographer James W. Sames recounted to The Blood-Horse, he visited Faraway Farm at the request of farm manager, Patrick O’Neill, to take some pictures of Man O’ War. Little did he know that the last photo he took, in colour, would be the final image of a legend. When his new groom, Cunningham Graves, affectionately known as Bub, took Man O’ War back to his stall, the stallion balked. His head held high, he looked out and down the driveway, perhaps searching for a familiar figure. Finally, Man O’ War entered his stall at Faraway Farm and lay down.\n\nHe never got up again.\n\nPostscript: Man O’ War died on November 1, 1947. Given the thousands who wished to pay their final respects, he was laid out in his coffin before being buried at Faraway Farm. When Man O’ War’s remains were disinterred and re-settled at the Kentucky Horse Park, the Harbut family declined a request to move Will Harbut from his burial spot, in the Maddoxtown cemetery, to a grave near the Man O’ War memorial. Instead, a plaque was erected beside the statue that tells the story of their long and loving relationship.\n\nTO SEE SOME WONDERFUL, RARE PHOTOS OF MAN O’ WAR, READERS SHOULD VISIT THE KENTUCKIANA ONLINE DIGITAL LIBRARY.

Goldikova’s story is still “in progress” but Miesque’s narrative, while over with her death earlier this year, shone just as brightly during her racing career and later in the breeding shed. Both mares boast a huge fan following overseas, having established themselves as individuals who embody the highest possible breed standards in a modern thoroughbred. As we think about our own equine heroes and heroines, it is equally important to appreciate the greats of the past on a global stage, as well as those thoroughbreds of today who, like Goldikova, Rachel Alexandra, Zenyatta, Frankel and Black Caviar are writing themselves into legend.\n\nGOLDIKOVA (2005) Bred in Ireland by owners, Wertheimer et Frère\n\nGoldikova walked into history last week when she won the Prix de Rothschild for the fourth consecutive time. The 6 year-old daughter of Anabaa (1992) out of Born Gold (1991) by Blushing Groom (1974) has been nothing less than extraordinary in her racing career. That trend is likely to continue right through until her retirement is announced, likely some time after the 2011 Breeders’ Cup.\n\nHer owners, Wertheimer et Frère, are the descendants of a distinguished French family whose history in the sport goes back to the early 1900’s. Proprietors of the House of Chanel, which they acquired through a partnership with Coco Chanel formed in 1924, the first of their thoroughbreds to make an international name for himself was the champion Epinard (1920). Owned by the canny Pierre Wertheimer, Epinard was the grandson of the British Triple Crown winner Rock Sand and in his native France, Epinard is still considered a racing legend to this day. In spite of his iconic status in the hearts and minds of the French, the great horse was commandeered by the German occupying forces during WWII and was reportedly seen as a cart horse before his death in 1942. A tragic end to the life of a champion who had so dominated his peers on the turf in the 1920’s. Other Wertheimer greats since the 1920’s include the spectacular filly, Midget (1953), the accomplished Riverman (1969) and the influential sire, Lyphard (1969), all of whom raced in France and England. Riverman and Lyphard were both retired to stud in the USA.\n\nGoldikova’s trainer is the talented Freddie Head, who was a winning jockey overseas before he retired and began training for the Wertheimer family. In fact, the Head family has a long-standing tradition with the Wertheimers, beginning with the appointment of Freddie’s father, Alec Head, to train Pierre Wertheimer’s horses in 1949. Alec Head turned out to be a superb trainer and businessman, purchasing the famous French stud, Haras du Quesnay after WWII. The stud farm had been founded originally by William Kissam Vanderbilt in 1907. Haras du Quesnay is still owned and operated by the Head family today and is known for its distinguished roster of thoroughbred stallions, most recently standing Mr. Sidney (2004), Sevres Rose (1993) a grandson of Nijinsky II, Kentucky Dynamite (2003), a son of Kingmambo and the recently retired Youmzain (2003), a son of champion Sinndar.\n\nHaras du Quesnay is essentially a non-commercial thoroughbred farm. Its horses are bred and owned by the Head family, with only a very few ever going to auction. However, given their excellent reputation in the industry, they have established the kinds of connections with the thoroughbred community worldwide that have resulted in some exceptional thoroughbreds, of which Goldikova is one. Although she was bred by the Wertheimers, Goldikova’s pedigree resounds with the influence of the Head family. A daughter of the Heads’ great stallion, Anabaa, Goldikova is inbred 3X4 to Northern Dancer through Lyphard on the bottom and 4X4 to Riverman, both horses bought by Alec Head for the Wertheimers.\n\nDuring his career as a jockey, Freddie won the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe three times, twice in partnership with a Head family member: the wonderful filly Ivanjica (1972), was trained by his father, Alec, and another outstanding filly, Three Troikas (1976) was trained by his sister, Criquette Head -Maarek. While Criquette Head-Maarek is the world’s most famous female thoroughbred trainer, still another sister, Martine Head, is the current manager of Haras du Quesnay. Criquette Head-Maarek’s daughter, Christiane, is currently training for Haras du Quesnay.\n\nSafe to say that Goldikova’s connections are as distinguished as the mare herself. Goldikova is a champion, but she is also a harbinger of the rich thoroughbred racing and breeding history of two historic families, the Heads and the Wertheimers. They are to Europe what denizens like the Belmonts, Whitneys and Hancocks are to American thoroughbred history.\n\nIt is fair to say that Goldikova is a precious gift to the Head family and in particular, for reasons far beyond her winning form. Her sire, Anabaa, was given to Alec Head by Sheikh Maktoum Al Maktoum as a gift. When training under Criquette Head as a 2 year-old, it appeared that Anabaa was a wobbler, for which there is no cure. But rather than euthanising the colt, Alec Head determined to rest him. Six months later, it was discovered that Anabaa had actually sustained a pinched nerve — the cause of his “wobbler-like” symptoms. At this point, Sheikh Maktoum gave his colt to Head, because it was the gifted trainer who had been responsible for saving Anabaa’s life. It was a great gesture from a great horseman, whose love of the thoroughbred was legion.\n\nPredictably, Head and the lovely bay colt formed a bond that lasted until Anabaa’s untimely death, of peritonitis, in 2009. Retired to stud at Haras du Quesnay after a brilliant career on the turf, Anabaa sired classic winners Goldikova, Anabaa Blue and Martillo, as well as the Australian champion sprinter Yell and 2003 Hong Kong champion, Anabar. When Anabaa was finally moved to Castleton Lyons in Kentucky, Martine Head accompanied him on the trip and stayed with him until it was clear that the stallion had settled in. In an article in the Thoroughbred Times, she acknowledged that moving Anabaa to the USA had been a heartbreaker for her family, because they were all so committed to him. The Head family loved Anabaa, considering him “part of the family.” And so he was. Anabaa was owned by Alec Head, trained by Criquette Head -Maarek and ridden to victory by Freddie Head. The young colt who appeared to have no future at all, turned out to be a champion on both the turf and in the breeding shed. His offspring ran at all distances, over the dirt and grass, in two different hemispheres. He was clearly one of Danzig’s best sons — if not the best of them all. And just how great was Danzig? An amazing sire to be sure, but he had been a brilliant race horse too, whose career was cut short by repeated health issues. In this short clip (below), entitled “Danzig….What Might Have Been” we can re-live his brilliance on the track:\n\nAnabaa’s death came as a blow to the Head family. It was noted that, despite all the champion horses that he had trained and bred, Anabaa was “The One” in Alec Head’s life, making the subsequent triumphs of his brilliant daughter both bittersweet and exhilarating. Like her sire, Goldikova is a thoroughbred with a kind disposition who loves to run, loves people and is always keen to answer any questions asked of her on the turf.\n\nTo date, Goldikova has won 17 of 24 starts from ages 2-6, earning slightly under 7 million USD. She has raced to victory on three continents. She has won the Eclipse Champion Turf Mare twice (2009, 2010), the Cartier Champion Older Horse twice (2009, 2010) and has twice made history, winning the Breeders’ Cup Mile for the last three consecutive years (the only horse in history to win a World Championship race three times) and the Prix Rothschild for four years running. In 2010, she was voted the Cartier Horse of the Year. With her win in the Rothschild, the sensational filly who seems to do everything just right, notched her 14th Group One/Grade One win.\n\nJoin us as we watch the stuff that makes a thoroughbred fan’s heart sing and eyes cloud with emotion. Here is a video of Goldikova’s three consecutive wins under her jockey, Olivier Peslier, at the Breeders’ Cup in the Turf Mile against the boys:\n\nAfter her Rothschild win, Freddie Head reflected, “I would say she is better than Miesque, as she is better in her head and Miesque used to pull very hard. Marchand d’Or is very good and is a champion, but she has to be the very best I have trained, she is something else.”\n\nWhich hints at one facet of the Goldikova-Miesque connection….\n\nBelow, 6 year-old Goldikova pictured in her last race to date — the Prix Rothschild, which she won for the fourth consecutive time. Olivier Peslier would say later that he never needed to touch her once with his whip — she just accelerated when asked, all on her own:\n\nMIESQUE (1984) Bred in Kentucky by owners Flaxman Holdings Ltd. (Niarchos family)\n\nLet us introduce you to Miesque. She was one of the very first “fabulous fillies” to invade the boys’ turf when she ran in the Breeders Cup Mile in 1987. Watching her here, it is easy to understand what it means to witness a thoroughbred’s great heart:\n\nMiesque was owned and bred by the flamboyant Stavros Niarchos out of his very fine stallion, the great Nureyev. During his lifetime, Niarchos was an enthusiastic and successful competitor in France, England and the USA. Other than the champion Nureyev, his first big winner was Dactylographer (1975), a son of Secretariat. Miesque was, without question, the best horse he ever raced — and her jockey was the young Freddie Head. The dark bay filly with the white star and Freddie Head were as indissociable as Ronnie Turcotte and Secretariat. They were a team that chalked up 12 victories in 16 starts in England, France and the USA, earning over 2 million dollars USD in the process.\n\nLike “Goldie,” Miesque hailed from the family of the incomparable Northern Dancer. But unlike the Head-trained Goldikova, Miesque was “hot” in character. Like so many great thoroughbreds, the filly had a mind of her own and it was through Freddie Head’s deep understanding of the thoroughbred, together with trainer Francois Boutin’s patience, that her disposition was channeled into a hardy, competitive spirit on the race course. Temperamental or otherwise, Miesque was adored by her fans and enjoyed international fame. When she appeared at the 1987 Breeders’ Cup for the first time as a 3 year-old, her French campaign preceded her. But when she took the BC Turf Mile for the second straight time at 4, she became a legend — no other horse had ever done this before. She retired having been named Champion at 2, 3 and 4 in France, England and the USA.\n\nHere she is winning the Breeders Cup Turf Mile for the second consecutive year (1988). With this win, the noble Miesque walked into horse racing history:\n\nMiesque is known today in North America through her brilliant progeny, the best of whom was unquestionably Kingmambo (1990), a son of Mr. Prospector (1970). But Miesque had 13 other foals, including a full sister to Kingmambo called Monevassia(1994) who has already produced the champion Rumplestiltskin2 (2003) by Danehill. In turn “Rumple” is the dam of the promising filly, Why (2008), by the great Galileo. Miesque’s other winning offspring are the French champion filly, East of the Moon (1991), Mingun (2000) and Miesque’s Son (1992). The latter is the sire of Miesque’s Approval (1999) who retired with earnings well over 2 million USD and earned the titles of Eclipse Award for Outstanding Male Turf Horse and Florida-bred Horse of the Year in 2006.\n\nKingmambo is an American legend and a sire of sires. And it is he who assured that the great heart of Miesque would go on. Prior to his retirement, Kingmambo had sired 13 millionaires and a goodly number of winners of over 200K USD. Among his millionaires are the champions Lemon Drop Kid (1996), American Boss (1995), El Condor Pasa (1995) who stands in Japan, Student Council (2002), Rule of Law (2001), Henrythenavigator (2005) and Tawqeet (2002). Progeny who earned 500K USD or more include the likes of Archipenko (2004), Parade Ground (1995), Light Shift (2004), Detroit City (2002) and Master of Hounds (2008). When pensioned by Lane’s End, Kingmambo’s champion offspring had raced worldwide, on dirt and turf and at a range of distances. All were as consistent in the winner’s enclosure as they were sound. Today, Kingmambo’s progeny and their progeny comprise an almost dizzying array of champion bloodstock.\n\nIn 1999, Miesque was inducted into the National Museum of Racing’s Hall of Fame. She died on January 20, 2011 and is buried at the Oak Tree Division of Lane’s End Farm where she lived as a broodmare following her retirement from racing.\n\nMiesque stands 82nd on the Blood-Horse’s list of the 100 Greatest Thoroughbreds of the 20th century and 14th on Tony Morris’ international list of the greatest fillies of the last century. She certainly deserves to be remembered in this way.\n\nYet neither honours nor her impressive legacy to the breed can ever quite compete with our memories of her, coming home with a young Freddie Head in the saddle, her body streamlined in flight as she reached toward the wire. It is in the wake of thoroughbreds like Miesque that we learn to appreciate the art and grace of a thoroughbred.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nThis article was inspired by a request from VAULT reader, John Embry. But as we began to research Zarkava, as per John’s request, we came across a number of astoundingly good European fillies and mares. As you might imagine, each one of these great thoroughbreds was loved as passionately as Personal Ensign, Ruffiian, Rags To Riches, Rachel Alexandra and Zenyatta during their racing campaigns and subsequent broodmare careers. Since there are too many great Euro fillies and mares to write about in one article, the plan is to continue this series, though not necessarily in consecutive instalments. At a later date, our visit with champions from “across the pond” will include Goldikova, Miesque, Allez France and Dahlia.\n\nZARKAVA (2005) bred in IRELAND by owner HRH the Aga Khan\n\nZarkava has a WOW! kind of pedigree and her owner-breeder acknowledges that she represents the zenith of his breeding program to date, even though the Aga Khan’s breeding operation has produced the likes of Epsom Derby winners Shergar, Shahrastani and Kahyasi. Quite the complement to a quirky, gutsy mare who won all seven of her starts, retiring undefeated.\n\nSo deep is Zarkava’s bloodline that it is difficult to imagine how she could have been anything but a superstar. For starters, her sire, Zamindar (1994) is by the great American stallion, Gone West (1984), a grandson of Secretariat (1970). Zamindar’s dam, Zalzafon (1982) is a daughter of Epsom Derby winner, The Minstrel (1974), one of the gutsiest thoroughbreds ever trained by the esteemed Vincent O’Brien. In addition, Zarkava is inbred to Northern Dancer (4 X 5) and to the dam of Nijinsky II, Flaming Page (5 X 5).\n\nZarkava’s dam, Zarkasha (1999) is the daughter of Epsom and Irish Derby winner, Kahyasi (1985), a grandson of the last British Triple Crown winner, Nijinsky II (1967). Zarkasha is out of Zarkana (1992), a daughter of Doyoun (1985), the sire of champions Daylami (1994) and Kalanisi (1996). Doyoun’s sire, England’s beloved Mill Reef (1968), won both the Epsom Derby and the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe.\n\nHow’s that for royal blood?\n\nDuring her racing career, the incomparable Zarkava took pretty much all of France’s most prestigious classic races, beating the likes of Goldikova (twice), Da Re Mi, Youmzain, Duke of Marmalade and Soldier of Fortunes, all outstanding horses in their own right. Noted for her exuberance out of the starting gate at 2 (see the “Zarkava leap” above), it took time for her trainer, Alain du Royer-Dupre and her jockey, the talented Christophe Soumillon to “get her right.” But even as they puzzled over the right way to get Zarkava into a more relaxed stride leaving the gate so that she could really call on her stamina in longer matches, the bay daughter of Zamindar just went right on winning. By 3, Zarkava had learned to race at a more relaxed, steady pace, saving her energies for the home stretch. Despite her relentless marches to victory that preceded it, her most spectacular victory came in the Arc in 2008 and raised her to the status of a French heroine:\n\nA lovely (though long) video that features all of Zarkava’s victories and includes some rather rare footage:\n\nNow retired, Zarkava produced a filly by another Arc winner, the handsome grey, Dalakhani (2000), in 2010. In 2011, she delivered a colt by the incomparable Sea The Stars (2006), who, like Zarkava herself, was retired following his victory in the Arc. These two babies are the progeny, between them, of 3 Arc winners. Wow! Here’s hoping that each of their futures shines as brightly as their parents. As we said at the beginning, it seems unlikely that we’re not looking at champions in the making.\n\nALL ALONG (1979) Bred in France by owner Daniel Wildenstein\n\nShe raced in France, Japan, the UK and the USA, as well as in Canada, and wherever she went, they fell in love with All Along. Angel Cordero dreamed (literally!) that he would get a chance to ride her even before he piloted All Along to a second place finish in the 1983 BC Turf. The loss was heartbreaking, but Cordero noted the slow pace and had only praise for the mare. Clearly, in his eyes, she had lost nothing in defeat. Barbara Livingston, America’s best loved equine photographer, writing about meeting All Along in her exquisite and informative book, Old Friends, had this to say in her conclusion, ” She was tickled to be brought in from the Midway, Kentucky paddock where she grazed with friends. Still awed by her racing performances, I was equally tickled to rub her face and say I’d touched All Along.”\n\nAs is the case with Zarkava, All Along’s pedigree bespoke depth and stamina. The beautiful mare was a granddaughter of America’s champion, Round Table (1954) out of Agujita (1966), a daughter of Vieux Manoir (1947), winner of French and English classics, from the British sire line of Blandford (1919) and Swynford (1907). In her third generation, All Along carries Bold Ruler (1954), Princequillo (1940) and Coastal Traffic (1941), a son of the immortal Hyperion (1930). She is also inbred to the great Prince Rose (1928) in her fourth generation.\n\nVieux Manoir’s sire, Brantome (1931) had a dramatic story of his own. The Arc winner was retired to stand in France, but during the Second World War, he was seized by the Germans, along with some 600 other French thoroughbreds. During the war years, Brantome stood as a kind of hostage at the German National Stud, before being recovered and returned to France in 1945. Lucky, too, since Brantome’s son, Vieux Manoir was also the grandsire of Ivanjica (1972) who won the Arc, as well as Val de Loire (1959), an outstanding French stallion who was the broodmare sire of the ill-fated but brilliant Shergar (1978).\n\nAll Along started 21 times, winning 9 and only being out of the money in 6. Trained by Patrick Biancone, All Along showed promise until the beginning of her four year-old campaign, where she sustained three losses. However, come her fourth race that year, the prestigious Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, All Along began a stunning array of victories that would see her victorious in three different countries, including her homeland. It was her second try at the Arc, but this time All Along was not to be denied. Given her losses that year, it is not surprising that in the footage below the track announcer never mentions her name until the field turns for home. Ridden by a young Walter Swinburn, All Along showed an astonishing turn of foot that day to cross the wire first. Watch for Swinburn’s navy silks and white cap on the thoroughbred against the rail as the horses near the finish line:\n\nFollowing her victory in the Arc, the commanding bay mare shipped to Toronto, Canada for the Rothman’s International, where she would again vanquish the colts. Next on the hit list was the American Turf Classic, which she won by almost nine lengths going away. Her final race that year was the Washington D. C. International. Did she win it? Of course she did, defeating the likes of Majesty’s Prince and other international turf stars. That same year, All Along was the Horse of the Year and Champion Older Female in the USA and her native France, respectively. The gifted mare was also inducted into the Racing Hall of Fame in 1990.\n\nAll Along spent her broodmare career at Three Chimneys in Kentucky. As a broodmare, All Along was less lucky. Of her 13 foals, the ones who raced proved to be mediocre, despite having brilliant parents on both the top and bottom of their pedigrees. Pensioned in 2003, All Along died on February 23, 2005 at the age of 26. She is buried at Three Chimneys.\n\nDespite her lack of success in the breeding shed, All Along had already attained racing immortality before her attention turned to motherhood. Her exploits on the turf against international fields of colts and fillies are the stuff of legend. Neither time can diminish her, nor racing hearts ever forget her.\n\nTHE VAULT credits Barbara Livingston’s outstanding thoroughbred ethnography, Old Friends, for the excerpt in which Barbara’s admiration for All Along is quoted. Readers interested in purchasing a copy of Old Friends or any of Livingston’s books should visit the Eclipse Press (Blood-Horse web site) or abebooks.com\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nEven though nothing in breeding is ever 100% certain and no one characteristic leads to thoroughbred perfection, our three super-mares can be expected to pass down at least some of their brilliance to their offspring. This concluding article in The Power of X series looks at other influences that are as important as possible sex-linked traits. To many in the thoroughbred pedigree field these genetic traits, together with the union of excellent bloodlines, are the most important aspects of all in breeding thoroughbreds.\n\nThe Miracle of mtDNA\n\nAnother sex-linked gift that Rachel, Rags and Zenyatta will bring to their respective offspring is mitochondrial DNA, or mtDNA. What’s amazing about mtDNA is that it is passed directly to either a filly or a colt by its dam, because it is only the female that carries it in her genetic make-up. This form of “maternal” DNA is located in the mitochrondria, which carry their own genes that generate the fuel that drives the machinery of certain cells. The mitochondria passed from Rachel, Rags and Zenyatta to their foals at conception represents as direct a link between mother and foal as mare’s milk. The reason is that mtDNA is thought to change very little over generations of thoroughbreds.\n\nIn a piece of terrifically exciting research done by Dr. Stephen Paul Harrison and his Thoroughbred Genetics company in Kent, England, mtDNA is being tested to see how its energy-producing qualities transfer to the racing abilities of 3 year-olds in Ireland, the USA, France and Australia. In short, since mtDNA fuels both muscles and the heart, it exerts influence over a thoroughbred’s speed and stamina. As you might expect, part of the way this influence shows itself is in thoroughbreds that prefer shorter to longer distances, as well as those that appear able to handle both.\n\nHarrison’s research also argues that thoroughbred lineage records are inaccurate, since several so-called separate families can be traced back to common ancestors using mtDNA, making this kind of genetic evidence far more reliable than the oftentimes flawed records from the past that were kept in stud books. This research is ongoing, but its purpose speaks to an overall general improvement in the management of this variable in broodmares. Harrison et al. also note two other important facts: firstly, the unlocking of the potential of mtDNA is only one factor in successful breeding practice. Secondly, for a variety of reasons, the majority of thoroughbred mares today likely carry a mixture of genetic material that fails to target stamina and performance in any pure, undiluted way.\n\nWhile it is impossible to say that Rachel, Rags and Zenyatta carry mtDNA that will automatically make their offspring performance giants, this in no way diminishes the speed and stamina influences that they bring to a mating. And, as this important research continues, mtDNA will feature more and more in the kinds of information breeders use when selecting stallions for their broodmares.\n\nOne thing is certain: genetic science offers much to the breed, the sport and the industry. These are indeed exciting times!\n\nRags to Riches\n\nAdding Rags to Riches to the Coolmore broodmare band is a definite plus for an organization whose success at breeding and on the turf is unrivalled worldwide. The impetus for what was to become Coolmore began with the incomparable trainer, Vincent O’Brien and a super-wealthy business tycoon, the late Robert Sangster.\n\nWhen the great Nijinsky II was retired to Claiborne, the Irish mourned his loss as keenly as if Secretariat had been retired to a stud farm in Mongolia. He was, quite literally, their Secretariat and still garners the adoration of UK racing fans today. The loss of Nijinsky II to North America was followed by an exodus of other great Irish-trained champions, notably The Minstrel, El Gran Senor (sire of Toussaud, among others) and Storm Bird (sire of Storm Cat and Summer Squall). What did these thoroughbreds have in common? They were all sired by Canada’s Northern Dancer. O’Brien and Sangster determined to find their own “Northern Dancer” and after many tries, along he came in the person of Sadler’s Wells. How good was Sadler’s Wells? He turned out to be the Northern Dancer of Great Britain and Europe: a sire of sires with an outstanding produce record.\n\nMere months after his death at the age of 30, Sadler’s Wells son, Galileo, had two sons who finished 1-2 in the 2011 Irish Derby. A great grandson finished third. The speculation is that Galileo may be every bit as great as his sire. Possibly greater. And this is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg when it comes to Sadler’s Wells. Suffice to say that the vast majority of Coolmore champions over the last 20 + years are direct descendants of Northern Dancer, the majority through Sadler’s Wells.\n\nCoolmore’s loyalty to that sire line after over two decades of breeding makes Rags’ third foal, a colt by Galileo, a very exciting prospect indeed! Coolmore probably understands the pluses and minuses of breeding Northern Dancers better than any organization in the world, so we can assume that breeding Rags to Galileo was much more than a good guess. Granted, her first two offspring have been by the excellent Giant’s Causeway and the young sire, Henrythenavigator, themselves descendants of Northern Dancer. Clearly, in the case of Rags, Coolmore is also exploiting the Northern Dancer-Secretariat cross. This same cross has already produced champions like Storm Cat, Summer Squall, Dehere, Chief’s Crown, Secreto and Chapel of Dreams. A more recent example of Ballydoyle winners bred on the Northern Dancer-Secretariat cross is Misty For Me (Galileo ex. Butterfly Cove by Storm Cat).\n\nRags’ dam, Better Than Honour, is an outstanding producer. Her offspring include the champions Casino Drive (2005) by Mineshaft, Jazil (2003) by Seeking the Gold and Man of Iron (2006) by Giant’s Causeway. Like the dams of Rachel and Zenyatta, the fact that Better Than Honour has produced a total of 4 champions by 4 different sires leads one to be confident that she has passed on some serious genetic material to all of her offspring. What Coolmore will also value in Rags To Riches is her track record on dirt, since they have long-awaited the arrival of a thoroughbred that could compete in American stakes races like the Kentucky Derby. In turn, if even one of Rags’ offspring shows this inclination, they will become valuable assets to Ashford’s (Coolmore USA) breeding program.\n\nAll in all, we feel confident in expecting Rags to produce champions who do as well on the grass as on dirt. With the combined influences of the feisty and talented Rags to Riches, together with stallions like Giant’s Causeway and Galileo, the future is going to be intensely exciting for thoroughbred fans worldwide. Given Coolmore’s breeding expertise, that includes availing themselves of state-of-the-art pedigree research, America’s heroine is in very good hands. It looks like Rags’ chances of becoming a thoroughbred matriarch of the 21st century are huge!\n\nRachel Alexandra\n\nThe decision to breed Rachel Alexandra to Curlin was obviously central to the late Jess Jackson’s plan to breed a stronger, better thoroughbred. X influences aside, these two have an impeccable lineage that will, without question, flow into Rachel’s colt on the back of a small army of blue-ribbon chromosomes!\n\nOne of the influences in Rachel’s pedigree that we find significant is that of El Prado, a son of the aforementioned Sadler’s Wells, who was purchased during the years of the Vincent O’Brien – Robert Sangster partnership. Bred in Ireland, El Prado was trained by Vincent O’Brien and was a brilliant two year-old who won 4 of 6 starts to become the Irish Champion Two Year-Old of 1991. Out of the mare, Lady Capulet, a daughter of the superb Sir Ivor, who was also trained by O’Brien, hopes for El Prado’s 3 year-old season were high. However, the colt lost his three starts that year and was subsequently sold to Frank Stronach, who adored him right from the start. (In case you’re wondering why Coolmore would have let El Prado go, the answer lies in his 3 year-old performance or, rather, lack of it. In Ireland at that time, horses that had a dull or inconsistent career on the track were often sold to outside interests because there was massive attention at studs like Coolmore to breeding superior horses. As we noted earlier, great race horses don’t always make great stallions. However, in the last 120 years of thoroughbred breeding in the UK, the sires who have done best at stud have tended to have very good performance records on the turf.)\n\nAt the time that Stronach acquired El Prado, offspring of his sire (Sadler’s Wells) had absolutely no appeal to American breeders, since they considered him a turf (grass) sire. And that was fair enough, at the time. But El Prado turned out to be a brilliant sire of both dirt and turf horses. His millionaire progeny include Rachel’s sire, Medaglia d’Oro (1999), Nite Dreamer (1995), Artie Schiller (2001), Borrego (2001), Fort Prado (2001), Kitten’s Joy (2001), the filly Asi Siempre (2002) and, most recently, the brilliant Paddy O’Prado (2007). It is clear that El Prado’s pre-potency is reflected in Medaglia d’Oro’s stud record to date, as well as that of Kitten’s Joy.\n\nRemembering that there are 62 other chromosomes, arrayed in pairs, that Rachel received from her sire and dam, it’s clear that an El Prado genetic influence is in her bloodlines. Similarly, Rachel is inbred 5 X 5 to Meadow Stables’ Sir Gaylord (1959), a son of the great Turn-To (1951). Sir Gaylord was a fine racehorse and an excellent sire. His offspring include the champions and leading sires, Sir Ivor and Habitat. As significant is the fact that Sir Gaylord was a half-brother to Secretariat, both having the same dam, Somethingroyal (1952). In other words, Rachel’s beautiful pedigree also includes 2 influences from Princequillo. Other than Sir Gaylord, Rachel also carries Damascus(1964) on top in her 4th generation and both Mr. Prospector (1970) and Dr. Fager (1964) on the bottom, in her 4th and 5th generations, respectively.\n\nCurlin’s pedigree shows the influence of the successful Mr. Prospector-Northern Dancer cross. And, as we know, Rachel descends along the Northern Dancer sire line as well and this “doubling up” of powerful traits will definitely show in her first-born. Curlin’s sire, Smart Strike, is a half-brother to the incomparable Dance Smartly (1988), winner of the Canadian Triple Crown (against the colts) and the Breeders’ Cup Distaff in 1991. And while Curlin remains Smart Strike’s most wealthy offspring, the Canadian-bred stallion also sired the millionaires English Channel (2002), Fabulous Strike (2003), Fleetstreet Dancer (1998), Tempins (1998), Strike A Deal (2004), Papa Clem (2006), Soaring Free (1999) and, in 2007, Lookin’ At Lucky. Through Smart Strike, Curlin also boasts 4 X 5 to the great Nasrullah.\n\nRachel’s colt foal will represent what thoroughbred breeders mean when they talk about “breeding for the future” — introducing the best possible bloodlines into the thoroughbred pool. Whether or not this little fellow grows into an even greater champion than his illustrious parents, his arrival on the scene bespeaks great promise for the thoroughbred in the 21st century. Rachel’s foal is the very incarnation of greeting the future with hope — an aspect of thoroughbred racing that is both precious and inspiring.\n\nZenyatta\n\nBernardini (like Curlin) is a young sire. This makes it more complex to draw conclusions about his performance at stud, despite the fact that his first offspring to hit the track have ranged from good to excellent, injuries aside. To date, Bernardini has sired the champions To Honor and Serve, Stay Thirsty, Biondetti, Arthurs Tale and AZ Warrior. Another very promising individual is Bold Warrior. All of these champions are from Bernardini’s 2008 crop of foals and, with the exception of AZ Warrior (BMS-Carson City) and Bold Warrior (BMS – Kris S) all of the others are by mares whose sires are direct descendants of Northern Dancer. While acknowledging that Northern Dancer’s bloodline runs through a good 80% + of thoroughbreds worldwide today, this seemingly strong nick, or cross, is still worth noting in our discussion, because Zenyatta is void of the Northern Dancer sire line.\n\nOf some interest here is Bold Warrior, since his dam, Hollywood Wildcat, comes out of the same sire line and (dam) family as Zenyatta. ( Hollywood Wildcat was an exceptional performer, winning among others, the Breeders Cup Distaff, Hollywood Oaks, the Gamely and Lady’s Secret handicaps and the Debutante, retiring with earnings of over a million dollars USD. ) This makes the latter’s son, Bold Warrior, an interesting precursor of what we might expect from Zenyatta’s foal by Bernardini — and Bold Warrior at 3 is a very good colt! Hollywood Wildcat’s other successful progeny all hail from a Northern Dancer sire line, suggesting a positive nick of Street Cry-Northern Dancer. A Zenyatta- Giant’s Causeway offspring would be one example of such a nick, as would be matings to Galileo or Sea The Stars. In the case of the half-brothers, Galileo and Sea The Stars, we have the powerful influence of the Arc winner and Blue Hen, Urban Sea.\n\nBernardini’s dam, Cara Rafaela, is by the handsome Quiet American, a proven sire and broodmare sire. By Fappiano (1977) out of a daughter of Dr. Fager, Quiet American is inbred to Dr. Fager 2 X 3, as well as to a daughter of Princequillo, Cequillo (3 X 4), giving him an absolutely star-studded pedigree that boasts tons of heart, stamina and speed. This accounts for at least part of his success as a sire of exceptional fillies. Other than Cara Rafaela, his daughters include millionaires Switch (2007) and Seattle Smooth (2005), as well as the lightly raced Quiet Dance (1993), dam of the 2005 Breeders’ Cup Classic winner and Eclipse Horse of the Year, Saint Liam (2000). Quiet Dance is also the grandam of the filly, Buster’s Ready (2008) who is strutting her stuff in style on the track as a 3 year-old.\n\nAs we saw earlier, the grey Cara Rafaela is a positive influence, through both her sire and her dam, Oil Fable (1986) who traces back from the incomparable Spectacular Bid to Mahmoud. Despite the respectable bloodlines of his dam, all of Bernardini’s most accomplished offspring to date are all sons, with the exception of AZ Warrior. Meaning that the “jury is out” as concerns his capacity to produce an outstanding filly. What is certain is that Bernardini brings both a speed and a size influence to Zenyatta’s foal-to-be, whether a filly or a colt. (As concerns size, a foal that stands a more average height has a better chance of starting as a two year-old since, unlike Zenyatta, it would take less time to “grow into” its body.)\n\nAs for Zenyatta — her sire, Street Cry, has a positive nick pattern (41%) with Seattle Slew mares. The same pattern can be seen, in the reverse, in her mating to Bernardini and this is will likely be an asset. More than the direct influence of Street Cry, of considerable interest is the fact that Zenyatta carries inbreeding within the first 5 generations of her pedigree to both Hoist the Flag and Hail To Reason, two exceptional American sires.\n\nHoist The Flag (1968), a son of the spectacular Tom Rolfe, won 5 of his 6 starts at two and three. However, despite being lightly raced, Hoist The Flag went on to become a leading sire ( in 1981) and broodmare sire (in 1987). Two of his top earners were the double Arc winner Alleged (1984) and the rightly-named filly, Sensational (1984). As good as Hoist The Flag was as a sire, he was a brilliant broodmare sire. His daughters produced the champions Personal Ensign, Sacahuista, Mr. Chief, Broad Brush, Cryptoclearance, Personal Flag and Imperial Gesture, among others. In his breeding career, two crosses that were particularly good with Hoist The Flag were El Prado and Mr. Prospector. Is it possible that his potency helped to shape Vertigineux’s phenomenal success as a broodmare?\n\nHail To Reason (1958), a son of Turn-To (1951) had a disastrous racing career, largely due to injury, and was retired before the end of his two year-old season. However, he proved to be an amazing sire, producing the great Roberto, as well as champions Straight Deal, Halo, Personality, Proud Clarion, Stop The Music, Bold Reason and Mr. Leader. As a broodmare sire, Hail To Reason had enormous success. His best granddaughters were the brilliant Allez France, winner of the Arc and of earnings over 1 million dollars and the accomplished Triptych, who earned over 1 million BPS through victories in Prix Marcel Boussac, the Irish 2000 Guineas and the Champion Stakes, which she won twice, at the ages of 4 and 5. In addition, Hail To Reason’s daughter, Reason to Earn is the dam of Bold Reasoning, who sired Seattle Slew. In terms of Seattle Slew, there is the potential of an important confluence of pedigree influence between Zenyatta and Bernardini.\n\nAs has been said before on THE VAULT and elsewhere, Zenyatta has a beautiful pedigree, one that gave her stamina, speed and the heart to win. And as significant as other influences may be, her physical conformation owes something to both Hoist The Flag and Hail To Reason. This may indeed be an indicator of something great, given the contribution of these outstanding stallions to the breed. Anticipating her first foal is exciting for that reason, since her Bernardini baby is but the first step to unlocking the treasure that is Zenyatta!\n\nIn conclusion\n\nAll of these famous matings remain “unexplored territory” until these babies and babies-to-be set their feet on a race track. Only then will the rest of us get to see what, other than colouring and conformation, each inherited from their distinguished parents. We loved Rags To Riches, Rachel Alexandra and Zenyatta on the track, but this element of anticipation in their broodmare careers complements the excitement we felt when they raced, while also ensuring a lasting legacy.\n\nSo until their babies hit the turf running, let’s keep dreaming about …………………..\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nLast time, in Part One of this series, we looked at a few of the imponderables that influence thoroughbred breeding and the offspring of some very fine racing mares. In Part Two, we’re going to look at some of the inherited traits carried on the X chromosome and how these might influence Rachel’s, Rags’ and Zenyatta’s offspring, just as they have influenced thoroughbreds from as far back as 200 years ago.\n\nBut before we get started, a couple of “truths” must be kept in mind. First and foremost is that there is no fail-proof recipe for breeding a thoroughbred champion. There are, of course, any number of breeding beliefs. But to produce a champion, many factors have to be taken into account, from pedigree to race records and from soundness to training.\n\nSecondly, every thoroughbred is a completely unique, unrepeatable individual. So that, while our three exceptional ladies will undoubtedly have fine offspring, they can never reproduce themselves, simply because it is the design of genes, chromosomes and DNA that each of them inherited from their parents that made them who they are. Rachel, Rags and Zenyatta are all originals in that sense — and there will never again be another thoroughbred just like them. Anymore than there could ever be an exact replica of you or of me!\n\n(NOTE: For anyone who needs it, there’s a definition of gene, chromosome and DNA at the end of this article. Just scroll down to the end.)\n\nTo begin: there are many reasons that pedigree experts may decide to match a particular stallion with a specific mare. Typically, the choice of a stallion for Rachel, Rags and Zenyatta will involve looking at what each individual brings to the mating through studying sire lines and family (mare’s side), as well as racing performance data over a number of generations and the stallion’s record at stud. This, together with a focus on the characteristics the breeder is looking to breed into a potential offspring, completes the picture. If a mare, or a stallion, has lots of speed, a breeder might look for a stamina influence. Soundness and conformation might be another important consideration. Or a breeder might be looking for offspring with lots of heart room, favouring individuals with this type of conformation, such as Bernardini (2003) or Giant’s Causeway (1997) or Zenyatta or Rags to Riches. A breeder who is looking to breed a dirt horse who is good under most track conditions is looking for a mare/sire combination that favours this kind of adaptability. In this instance, a son of Mr. Prospector (1970) like Smart Strike (1992), or a grandson like Curlin (2004), might be favoured for a mare like Rachel Alexandra, who demonstrated so dramatically that she could win in the mud or in the sunshine.\n\nRegardless of the rationale for pairing a certain stallion and mare, whether or not the qualities being sought come to fruition in the foal is as much a matter of genetics as it is related to the environment in which the foal is raised and trained. The genetic influence begins with the difference between the X and Y chromosomes. The mare carries a pair of X chromosomes (XX) — an X from her sire and another X from her dam. The stallion carries a different pair: a Y from his sire and an X from his dam (XY). This means that, in the case of a filly foal (XX), the stallion contributes the X chromosome he received from his dam. But because a mare has two X chromosomes, she will contribute either the one she received from her sire OR the one she received from her dam, depending on which one is dominant. In the case of a colt foal (XY), the stallion contributes the Y he received from his sire, while the mare provides the X, making it the stallion who determines the sex of a foal. However, neither the sex of a foal nor which of the two X’s the dam expresses to it can be pre-determined.\n\nWhile the stallion has the role of determining the foal’s sex, it is the X chromosome that carries far more genetic potential (whether it comes from the stallion or the mare). On the X chromosome are factors that influence sound build, temperament, speed and stamina. These are called “X-linked traits.” But the sex-related chromosomes are not the only genetic inheritance a foal receives from its parents. There are 62 other chromosomes, arrayed in 31 pairs, that influence everything else about the foal’s physiology, conformation, coat colour, temperament, racing prowess and so forth. Each pair of chromosomes is composed of inherited genetic traits from both the sire and the dam. In other words, a foal inherits a bunch of important characteristics, including speed and stamina traits, from both its parents.\n\nSo although the X chromosome carries more genetic material than the Y, who contributes what as far as the other 31 pairs of chromosomes are concerned has to do with dominant and recessive genes. As they combine into the “code of life” that will become a foal, these dominant and recessive genes — themselves the inheritance of the sire and dam’s ancestors — dance themselves into a pattern that is completely unique to this still unborn thoroughbred. And depending on how the chromosomes that carry the genes arrange themselves, certain traits will dominate over others. So, for example, if Rachel Alexandra expresses a dominant stamina influence via her genes they might well dominate a speed influence from a prospective stallion to whom she is bred. In this case, she will likely produce a foal who needs a longer distance and who may quite honestly be (genetically) disadvantaged in a sprint. This is why, when you open the progeny list for a mare or a stallion, even the successful ones, you usually find everything from soup to nuts! Those pesky genes combine in ways that can advantage — or seriously disadvantage — a champion’s offspring.\n\nIn any mating, the hope is for a talented, healthy youngster and breeders base much of that optimism on the performance abilities of its sire and dam. But it’s the genes, chromosomes and DNA that always hold the best hand — and they keep their secrets pretty much hidden until that foal becomes a yearling and goes into training.\n\nThere is still another factor that’s loaded with potential, depending on whether or not it occurs in a thoroughbred’s pedigree. It’s quite literally called the “X-factor” because it’s a sex-linked trait. It’s “sex-linked” because it involves the inheritance of a large heart gene that is only carried on the X chromosome — the sire’s single X that is expressed only to his daughters and the dam’s two X’s, one of which she will express to her foal, whether a filly or a colt. And that large heart gene has been found to be a solid indicator of racing performance in standardbreds, thoroughbreds and quarter horses.\n\nResearch over the last 20 years in the UK, Australia and the USA has uncovered an inherited pattern for the large heart gene, as far back as the first known instance recorded of a large heart, which was that of the great Eclipse (1764). Now it appears that Eclipse passed on this trait. Over several generations, this large heart gene was passed from sire to daughter and from that daughter to her son, until we arrive at the most influential broodmare in thoroughbred history: Pocahontas (1837). A descendant of Eclipse, Pocahontas was a great producer during her lifetime, her most famous sons being Stockwell(1849), Rataplan (1850), and King Tom (1851) . She also produced five very good daughters, out of a total of 15 foals. Stockwell became the most important of her three sons and appears in the pedigrees of the outstanding individuals Phalaris (1913), Nearco (1935), and Native Dancer (1950). How influential was Pocahontas? Just look at the number of crosses back to her found among these remarkable thoroughbreds: The Tetrarch (7), Man O’ War (9), Nearco (37), Raise A Native (175), Secretariat (249), Northern Dancer (272) and Mr. Prospector (353). Too, in Pocahontas’ pedigree are 13 crosses to the immortal Eclipse — suggesting to large heart X researchers that this trait may well be Eclipse’s permanent gift to the breed.\n\nIt was upon the death of the immortal one, Secretariat (1970), that X-factor research was given the impetus it needed to move forward. It was discovered during his autopsy that Secretariat had a huge heart, weighing approximately 22 lbs. (An average thoroughbred heart weighs about 8.5 lbs.) Despite its size, Secretariat’s heart was normal in every other aspect. It was just that the champion turned “running on heart” from a metaphor into a statement of biological fact. In an industry that had focused almost exclusively on the sire, it turns out that the dam is as reliable a transmitter of this gene as the sire. As you might perhaps expect, a mare more reliably passes this gene on to a son. And, as the stallion is only able to transmit the large heart gene on his X chromosome to a daughter, his reliability lies there. In Secretariat’s case, it was Somethingroyal (1952) who expressed her large-heart gene to him, and not Bold Ruler (1954), his sire (who had to donate the Y for Secretariat to become a colt.)\n\nIn an almost poetically beautiful turn of events, we now know that Secretariat’s great heart is literally living on, through the progeny of four of his daughters: Weekend Surprise (1980), Terlingua (1976), Secrettame ( 1978) and Betty’s Secret (1977). We know this because the ongoing research into the large heart X has shown that to carry this sex-linked trait to an offspring, a thoroughbred needs to descend directly from at least one of four sire lines: War Admiral (1934), Mahmoud (1933), Blue Larkspur (1926) and Princequillo (1940). Each of these sire lines, in turn, trace directly back to the British mare, Pocahontas.\n\nToday, the large heart principle, or “X-factor” is used as one source of breeding information, in combination with more traditional breeding theories.\n\nAs indicated above, the large heart X gene descends, in a zigzag pattern, from a sire to his daughter and from that daughter to her sons. However, not all stallions have this X-linked trait to pass on to their daughters. Only those who trace back to the four heart line sires named above can accomplish the deed. If a mare inherits her X from a sire who descends from at least one of the large heart sire lines, she is called a “single copy” mare. This means that she has a 50/50 chance of passing the large heart on to her son(s) or daughter(s), depending upon which X is dominant. So, even though the large heart gene is an important trait, it isn’t necessarily the dominant X in a mare’s genetic profile. In other words, a mare may be a carrier of the X-factor but never be able to pass it on to her offspring.\n\nIf a mare inherits the X-linked large heart from both her sire and her dam, she is called a “double copy” mare. All of Secretariat’s four large-heart daughters are double copy mares. This means that both of their X chromosomes carry the large heart X, making it twice as likely that they will be able to give it to either a son or a daughter.\n\nFor example, Weekend Surprise likely expressed the large heart X to her sons, A.P. Indy (1989) and Summer Squall (1987). However, these sires can only pass it on to their daughters. As an example, a filly by Seattle Slew (1974) ex. Weekend Surprise inherits an X from Slew that carries the large heart trait PLUS another large heart X from Weekend Surprise, who, being a double copy mare is more likely to pass the trait on with some consistency to her offspring. In any case, this filly would have 3 out of 3 chances to inherit the large heart gene from one of her parents.\n\nNow, let’s take a look at the pedigrees of our three outstanding ladies, and the gentlemen in their lives, to see whether or not the large heart gene is present in these mating combinations and, if it is, what its chances are of being inherited by a foal from these matings.\n\nRags To Riches\n\nRags’ sire, A.P. Indy carries the large heart X which he received from his dam, Weekend Surprise (who had both Princequillo AND War Admiral large heart sire lines). Given his success on the track and at stud, it is reasonable to say that A.P. Indy passed the large heart gene on to Rags, just as he appears to have done with other female offspring. However, Rags’ dam, the excellent Better Than Honour (1996), does not link back (in that zigzag pattern) to a large-hearted sire line. So Rags is very likely a single copy mare, with a 50/50 chance of passing this trait on to a son. (The 50/50 ratio drops in the case of a filly, since both parents contribute an X and one of those X’s will be more dominant than the other.)\n\nAlthough she is now in Ireland and in foal to Galileo (1998), Rags’ first foal, a filly by Giant’s Causeway, was born in the USA. A chestnut who seems to hold an uncanny resemblance to her dam, the filly’s training has been postponed because of an injury to her sesamoid following a gallop (Thoroughbred Times, 09-06-2011). Interestingly, Giant’s Causeway has two potential sources of the large heart gene in his pedigree, only one of which is active since his sire, Storm Cat (1983), could only give him a Y chromosome. So it is the X he received from his dam, Mariah’s Storm (1991), that he will pass down to a daughter. This means that Rags’ first foal, a filly, had two opportunities to inherit the large heart gene — one from her dam and the other from her sire. If the “X-factor” theory holds true, Rags’ firstborn has an excellent chance of inheriting the large heart gene from Giant’s Causeway.\n\nRags’ second foal, a colt, is by Henrythenavigator (2005) and the little fellow is reportedly a beautiful individual. This stallion has no connection to any of the four heart line sires in his pedigree. This means that Rags may have expressed the large heart gene on the one X in her pedigree that carries it. Or maybe not. The chances remain about 50/50 because only one of her X’s carries the large heart gene.\n\nGalileo was a great race horse and is proving to be an outstanding sire. He carries the large heart gene from his dam, Urban Sea (1989), who is also the dam of his half-brother, the brilliant Sea The Stars (2006). Urban Sea inherits the gene through her sire, Miswaki (1978), a son of Mr. Prospector who traces back to War Admiral. This bodes well for Rags’ third offspring — if a filly, it will certainly receive the large heart gene on Galileo’s X; if a colt, it has a 50/50 chance of inheriting Rags’ large heart gene.\n\n“Hooves crossed,” wonder- full Rags!\n\nRachel Alexandra\n\nRachel’s sire, Medaglia d’Oro (1999) does not descend from one of the four heart line stallions in a pattern that allowed him to receive the large heart gene, even though his sire is El Prado (1989), who descends from Northern Dancer and, therefore, the Mahmoud heart line. (El Prado expressed the Y chromosome to Medaglia d’Oro.) Still, no-one could doubt that this stallion isn’t sending great genetic material to his daughters when we think of Rachel’s brilliance, as well as the exploits of Champagne d’Oro (1997), Gabby’s Golden Gal (2006), Tasty Temptation (2006), Payton d’Oro (2006), Plum Pretty (2008) and Vision in Gold (2009).\n\nRachel’s dam, Lotta Kim (2001), traces back to Pocahontas through her sire, Roar (1993), but not to one of the heart line sires along the way. However, through her broodmare sire, Cure the Blues (1978), Lotta Kim traces back to War Admiral. In other words, Rachel’s dam is likely a single copy mare and, if so, has a 50/50 chance of expressing the large heart gene to her offspring. Curlin, Rachel’s first beau, does not trace back to the large heart sire lines, although through his dam, Sherriffs Deputy (1994), Curlin does trace back to Eclipse.\n\nThis adds up to mean that Rachel might be a carrier of the large heart gene, but only if it was passed on to her by her dam. If she is — and it would appear to be a strong possibility, given her amazing racing abilities — Rachel would also be a single copy mare, with a 50/50 chance of expressing this trait to a son or a daughter. As we know that Rachel is expecting a colt, it will be interesting to see whether or not he exhibits this trait.\n\n“Hooves crossed,” beautiful girl!\n\nZenyatta\n\nAlthough Zenyatta’s sire, Street Cry (1998), traces back to Pocahontas in a zigzag pattern (sire to daughter to daughter’s son), he does not trace back to heart line sires through his dam. And it is Street Cry’s dam that would need to express the large heart gene, first to him and then from him to Zenyatta. However, Zenny’s dam, Vertigineux (1995), descends from the Princequillo heart sire line, making Zenyatta — like both Rags to Riches and Rachel Alexandra — a potential single copy mare.\n\nBernardini, her first suitor, traces back to the War Admiral and Mahmoud heart sire lines through his dam, Cara Rafaela (1993), making her a double copy X mare. This means that Zenyatta’s foal — if it’s a filly — has three possible chances of inheriting the large heart gene, one from Zenny and the other on the X from Bernardini, which must carry the large heart X . As we have seen, the A. P. Indy sire line boasts a goodly number of outstanding fillies, making it quite interesting to see — X aside — what a filly foal from this pair will be like in terms of racing performance. If the foal is a colt, Zenny becomes the only potential source of the large-heart X, a 50/50 proposition.\n\nHowever, Vertigineux has also produced other accomplished daughters in Balance (2003) by Thunder Gulch (who traces back to Eclipse through his dam), as well as Where’s Bailey (2002) by Aljabr (who does not trace back to the heart line sires). Her son, Souper Spectacular ( 2007) by Giant’s Causeway is a promising turf performer, having most recently won three in a row over distances from a mile to a mile and a quarter. All of which bodes well for Zenyatta, since it would suggest that Vertigineux tends to express her large heart gene to her offspring fairly consistently, possibly because the gene is a dominant X. (Note: Eblouissante, another Vertigineux daughter, is still in training, so was not mentioned at this time.)\n\n“Hooves crossed,” big girl!\n\nOf course, it must be stressed that these sex-related influences are only one dimension of a much larger “genetic collage.” When one looks carefully at the pedigrees of Rachel, Rags and Zenyatta, as well as the stallions to whom they have been bred, it really is an impressive array of great, great thoroughbred bloodlines. Other influences these bloodlines favour will form part of the final article (part three) in this series.\n\nOne thing’s for certain: Rachel, Rags and Zenyatta all gave astounding testimonials to their stamina, courage and heart each and every time they raced. As broodmares, there is absolutely no reason to doubt their potency and the gifts it will bring to their respective offspring!\n\n(P.S. Special thanks to zenyatta.com for inventing the expression “Hooves crossed” that was re-cycled here.)\n\nNEXT TIME: Here’s another genetic trait that these ladies share where dominance has absolutely nothing to do with it. Join us at THE VAULT as we conclude our series with a look at the power of mitochondrial DNA, as well as other influences on the offspring of Rachel, Rags and Zenyatta.\n\nDEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nGene: a segment of DNA.
