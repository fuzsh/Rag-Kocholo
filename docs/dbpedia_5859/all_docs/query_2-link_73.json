It was awarded to the winner, NotThirdChance and is engraved with the inscription \"The Westchester Racing Association, The Acorn, 1951, won by NotThirdChance.\" Made in England and has \"PG\" stamped on bottom. The Acorn has been run since 1931 at Belmont, with Aqueduct holding it several times in the 60's and 70's. Dam to Hail to Reason; great grandsire of Barbaro and sire to multiple Triple Crown race winners. Originally sold in the 2008 Christie's Important American Silver sale featuring the estate of Hall of Fame horse racing owner and trainer Hirsch Jacobs.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';\">Sourcing straight from the private collection of a world-renowned thoroughbred breeder comes a wonderful offering of nearly 40 horse racing trophies that Lelands is honored to feature in the 2019 Fall Classic. Originally purchased from the 2008 Christie&rsquo;s Silver Auction, these trophies source from the estate of Ethel and Hirsch Jacobs. We have devoted an entire category to this collection in which collectors will have many chances to own some of the earliest horse racing trophies to be offered publicly. Most of the trophies span back to 1950s-60s and include Hall of Fame horses such as Stymie, Searching and Affectionately.</span></p>"
