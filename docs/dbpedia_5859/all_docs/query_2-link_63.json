        "text": "Pedigree Analysis for Afleet Alex\n\nBy Alan Porter\n\nAn outstanding 2-year-old who developed into a dual classic-winning champion 3-year-old, Afleet Alex has sired six North American Grade 1 winners and is an outstanding value-for-money sire.\n\nAs a Mr. Prospector-line stallion, it’s not surprising to see Afleet Alex do well with Northern Dancer-line mares. His Breeders’ Cup Juvenile (G1) scorer Texas Red is out of a mare by Jeune Homme, a Nureyev-line horse closely related to Storm Cat and Royal Academy, both also broodmare sires of Afleet Alex stakes winners. Afleet Alex sired 2-year-old Grade 1 winner Dublin out of a mare by Storm Bird, the sire of Storm Cat. From mares by other sons of Nijinsky II (sire of Royal Academy), Afleet Alex has stakes winners from daughters of Sky Classic and Strawberry Road.\n\nAfleet Alex has sired two stakes winners out of Danzig line mares, including Florida Derby (G1) victor Materiality out of a mare by Langfuhr. From the Dixieland Band branch of Northern Dancer, Afleet Alex has two stakes winners, including Grade 2 scorer Dancing Afleet, from mares by Citidancer (a clever cross here), suggesting daughters of Dixie Union might work well. Icecapade, a three-quarter relative to Northern Dancer, appears frequently in Afleet Alex’s good winners via either Wild Again or Clever Trick and his son Phone Trick.\n\nCrossing Afleet Alex back over Mr. Prospector has generally met with considerable success, with examples including the Travers Stakes (G1) hero Afleet Express out of a mare by Distant View and Grade 1 winner Sharla Rae out of a mare by Gold Fever, a son Forty Niner who appeals through Distorted Humor. Mr. Greeley, a son of Gone West, is the broodmare sire of Afleet Alex’s three-time Grade 1 winner Iotapa. Afleet Alex has two stakes winners out of mares by Kingmambo, a horse bred on a similar cross as Afleet Alex’s sire and himself sire of Lemon Drop Kid. From Mr. Prospector’s Fappiano branch, Afleet Alex has two stakes winners—including Grade 2 captress Afleeting Lady—out of Unbridled mares. From another branch of Raise a Native (the sire of Mr. Prospector) comes graded stakes winner La Gran Bailadora from a daughter of Affirmed.\n\nAfleet Alex’s dam is from the Roberto branch of the Hail to Reason line. Crossed back over a mare from that line, Afleet Alex sired graded stakes winner Called to Serve from a daughter of Kris S. (sire of Arch and grandsire of Blame, both of whom would be intriguing here). Afleet Alex already has two stakes winners, including graded scorer Bizzy Caroline, out of mares by Saint Ballado (brother to Devil’s Bag). We can note a stakes winner by Afleet Alex from a daughter of Rahy, whose dam, Glorious Song, is a sister to Saint Ballado."
