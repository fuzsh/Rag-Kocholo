        "text": "MATING RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nNo other Canadian-based stallion can match the three Graded stakes winners sired by Point Of Entry in 2022.\n\nKitodan won five of his eight starts during a highly successful season that featured three stakes wins capped by the Grade 3 Dueling Grounds Derby.\n\nAdmission Office, already a Grade 2 winner, enhanced his record by winning the Grade 3 Arlington Stakes, while the top Japanese mare Lotus Land won the Group 3 Kyoto Himba Stakes and ran second in the Group 1 Takamatsunomiya Kinen.\n\nEach provides a snapshot of the talent, durability and versatility thrown by Point Of Entry on a regular basis. Kitodan, for instance, is the winner of six races at ages two to four, and with the prospect of more to come.\n\nSimilarly, Admission Office boasts five wins and over $620,000 in earnings during a career highlighted by nine black-type placings.\n\nAs for Lotus Land, she is the winner of six races at up to 9f but as her run when a neck second in the Takamatsunomiya Kinen, one of Japan’s most prestigious 6f events, shows, she is an extremely effective sprinter as well.\n\nAs such, it’s been another excellent year for Point Of Entry, and with almost $5 million in seasonal earnings to his credit, one that makes him the leading active Ontario-based sire of 2022 - just as he was in 2021, when the Grade 1 Bruce D. Stakes winner Point Me By led a tally of four black-type winners.\n\nIn all, it’s everything that we have come to expect from the Dynaformer influence, a sire line renowned for its durability. Indeed, five-time Grade 1 winner Point Of Entry is Dynaformer’s most accomplished son on the track and now ranks as his sire’s most successful active son at stud.\n\nLike Dynaformer, Point Of Entry is capable of siring high-class performers on both turf and dirt; while Point Me By, Analyze It and Lotus Land are elite turf performers, Plus Que Parfait won the Group 2 UAE Derby on the dirt at Meydan.\n\nAnd like Dynaformer before him, Point Of Entry is also particularly effective with mares containing Mr. Prospector in their backgrounds. From the noted Phipps family of Our Country Place, Point Of Entry is out of Matlacha Pass, by Mr. Prospector’s leading son Seeking The Gold and it is worth noting that as many as 17 of Point Of Entry’s stakes horses contain another thread of Mr. Prospector.\n\nInterestingly, the black-type pair Tuggle and La Dame Blanche are both inbred to Seeking The Gold.\n\nGone West, meanwhile, is a key element to Point Me By (dam by Proud Citizen) and Emro (dam by Grand Slam) alongside the stakes-placed Devine Entry (dam by Elusive Quality) and Point Of Grace (dam by Mr Greeley), all of whom illustrate a notable affinity for Gone West.\n\nKitodan, Plus Que Parfait, Lotus Land, Admission Office, My Gal Betty and I’llhandalthecash are other stakes winners who are inbred to Mr. Prospector.\n\nPlus Que Parfait is also one of three stakes horses for Point Of Entry out of a mare by former Adena Springs stalwart Awesome Again alongside champion Cacciatora and Tuggle. His son Ghostzapper is also the damsire of I’llhandalthecash.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Awesome Again is out of a mare by Blushing Groom, himself another proven option for Point Of Entry whose sire line is responsible for the mares that produced stakes horses Maries Melody (dam by Leroidesanimaux), Glamanation (dam by Orientate), Flower Point (dam by Lewis Michael) and Dynamite Dan (dam by Runaway Groom).\n\nOutside of Awesome Again, other Northern Dancer lines of interest include Storm Cat, whose son Consolidator is the damsire of Analyze It.\n\nLotus Land is also out of a mare by Scat Daddy while mares by the likes of Giant’s Causeway, First Samurai and Hold That Tiger have also clicked with Point Of Entry to produce black-type horses.\n\nStorm Cat’s relation Royal Academy is also the damsire of Admission Office. He is inbred to Nijinsky, as is Lotus Land and Tuggle."
