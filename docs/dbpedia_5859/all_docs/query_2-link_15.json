        "text": "At lock-down – thinking out economics upon breeding, one may contemplate whether the glass is 1/2 full or 1/2 empty?\n\nAnd should we re-value what mares sold, what is culled?\n\nWhich lines are selected and how goes the justification?\n\nPast crisis World Wars which deeply fractured many unknown bloodlines of the breeding population and though it might be history, its recovery & re-growth.\n\nThe breed shapers came new. Nasrullah/Bold Ruler/Nashua – Native Dancer/Raise A Native – Northern Dancer/ Nijinsky et al\n\nYet shooting for the stars, the laissez faire economics morphed the breeding practice to consumption & industrialism. This interfaced greatly to sports gambling influence and governance & racing pattern directives.\n\nA racing pedigree came re-defined to sire $ and stake-win interest. The statistical influencing the market, how-to-select, how-to-breed by ROI, to immediate turn-around.\n\nAnd here we are…..wondering if its a black swan flying low or a may-day call-out.\n\nMAYBE established studs are patronized well enough. However one might easily assume smaller operations that are market dependent, have investment more exposed.\n\nThe core dilemma is always Decision & decisions: fundamental female bloodlines not recently produced or tested, yet nevertheless are classified elite, the ‘classic’ black-type producer. Primarily, they are a backbone of the breeding thoroughbred. They are foundational.\n\nI contemplate the books written by Sir Charles Leicester, Franco Varola, Ross du Bourg, Ken McLean, Leon Rasmussen, Miles Napier – they all help to understand specialized thoughts to degrees of robust breeding & advice is accompanied by diligence.\n\nTheir meaningful breeding advisory, went to project well ahead. The Practice principle is about development: an ‘upgrading’ quality to breeding quality stock. Those writers mentioned above are still ahead of our time…..\n\nToday however, is the mainstream exercise – the perpetual attempt to increase specialization to sprint and speed.\n\nI have no intention to debate early colt speed sires, yet I do believe a global change is here and that course is changing before our covid-19 eyes.\n\nRather than Designing ‘pure’ Speed to the Racehorse, it seems propitious to instigate a TB Conservation agenda. Or at least, assert more of specialized breeding.\n\nWhat to cull deserves to be seriously considered.\n\nA ‘Conservation’ application leverages Balancing speed nemesis thru to a ‘balanced’ constitutional longevity; widening the sire bloodline pool(s), and strictly sustain prototype progenitors & ensure ecological growth.\n\nAnd without hesitation, the overdue ending, to a ‘wastage’ landscape productivity.\n\nIt is caustic to see early 2,3 year olds discharged without some level of maturity. The natural stayer coerced to a sprinting training and development schedule disproving any talent in less than a season or two.\n\nIt’s the crude indifference – mass siring of major lines, to an incessant, bland, and monotonous duplicated ‘numbers’ breeding methodology and notably, increasing deterioration of genetic value once given to classic/solid/rough/professional diversity.\n\nGenotype pedigree analysis might come feeblest to bloodstock business know-how….but my god, how salient it is to see abandoned bloodlines emerge like earthquake, because genetic breeding is one slow innate process of ‘cycles’.\n\nIs it too difficult to envisage ‘future’ Breeding for conservation – further the potential & expand quality via added-Values.\n\nSuch to the likes of the great Man O’ War, Blandford, Bahram, Princequillo, Hail to Reason et al. They are seemingly too genetically smothered. Yet somehow, they simply bubble an extraordinary defiant robust potency.\n\nWith declining racing opportunity & escalating recession probability, let’s depart from imbalanced equilibriums, within breeding.\n\nThe imbalance(s) has claimed a morphological change to the breed, from proven stars to gambling chattel, investment commodity and yes, the horse-meat export trade.\n\nI suppose I can only plead Walk-back up the hill, view, select, upgrade & support the thoroughbred breed. Equine souls are on the line.\n\nFor the ‘new’, for the future, It is time to embrace responsibility.\n\nInflated breeding is gone, gone, gone….\n\nI’ve never run away from my responsibilities – Roberto Braggio\n\nI don’t care about keeping seats of power – Roberto Braggio\n\nEvery manager can improve – Roberto Mancini\n\nYoung people are our future and I want to help them to grow – Roberto Mancini\n\nSometimes a player think’s its enough what they did the year before and doesn’t understand that everyday they should improve – Roberto Mancini\n\n******\n\nRoberto – a genetic powerhouse\n\n(Hail to Reason-Bramalea (f.f.12c) by Nashua.\n\nRoberto’s sire, Hail To Reason as a young sire very soon made his mark when he in 1970 ended the great Bold Ruler’s 7 year term, to leading American sire.\n\nBroodmare sire Nashua, was a very sound horse. He sired tough stock.\n\nRoberto’s dam Bramalea was a quality racing type, but moody temperamental which Roberto inherited.\n\nRoberto’s dam, Bramalea descends from the ancestral Blank mare (Blank by Godolphin Arabian from Amorett Grey Whynot, ff 15).\n\nRoberto was a particularly good mover suited by firm ground, though he was able to act in any conditions – Sir Charles Leicester\n\nThe horse (Roberto) was renowned for his strength (tho’ not with the best of knees) toughness, a fiery nature coupled from a very bad temper. Vincent O’Brien\n\nRoberto is line-bred as follows:\n\nPlucky Leige – 5sx5sx7Dx5d (*foundational elite mare f.f. 16a)\n\nMumtaz Begum – 5sx4D (conduit-elite, speed mare f.f. 9c)\n\nBlue Larkspur – 4sx4d (classic chefs f.f.8f)\n\nTeddy – 5sx7Dx5D (stout chefs f.f.2n )\n\nSardanapale 5dx5d. (professional chefs f.f.16c)\n\n“If two or more ancestors with the Blue Larkspur/Teddy affinity are linked together it would produce enough electricity to light up Paris or New York”! – Ken McLean\n\n“….he (Olin Gentry Sr) deliberately duplicated French champion Sardanapale 5dx5d. Nashua’s grand-dam sire Sardanapale” Ken McLean – Designing Speed in the Racehorse. (n.b Sardanapale, the champion 3yo colt in France and leading broodmare sire (France) and leading sire, 1922, 1927)\n\nThough of American breeding, Roberto won the 1972 title to the English Derby. His hero moment was to defeat the brilliant Brigadier Gerard in the Gold Cup at York.\n\nFurther, Roberto is one strain-to-retain, the maternal pedigree is abundantly defined by 27x St Simon. Lining up St Simon ‘layers’ and depth is exemplary breeding (Read depths to St Simon → Waldgeist, the prodigious sire\n\n“The pedigree of Roberto speaks volumes for how to breed a better racehorse.” Leon Rasmussen\n\nas above, so below….Roberto\n\nRoberto – grand-dam sire to Makybe Diva (GB) (Desert King – Tugela) 3x Melbourne Cup winner 2003-2007\n\nRoberto – maternal grand-sire: Zenyatta (Street Cry – Vertigineux → Kris S/Roberto)\n\nCartier & European champion, Enable – (Nathaniel – Concentric) – Nathaniel’s dam, grand-paternal sire Roberto ENABLE (GB) – supreme\n\nEclipse champion turf female 2018 – Sistercharlie (IRE) (Myboycharlie – Starlet’s Sister (IRE)\n\nConsistent class performer, and 1-eye blind!
