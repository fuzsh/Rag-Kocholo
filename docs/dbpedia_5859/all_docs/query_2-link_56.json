        "text": "With the close of the 2019 sales season, one thing is clear: most yearlings lose money and therefore most breeders lose money. Likewise, losing is the key to horse racing because in any field of eight, seven are going to lose. Yet despite the prevalence of loss in our game, nobody wants to.\n\nLosing and its effect on profit is at the apex of risk, and there is a 2019 book on the subject that offered some interesting material for anyone negotiating risk, especially anyone in the horse business.\n\nAs a group, books on economics are not known for their lively titles; so Allison Schrager’s new volume, An Economist Walks Into a Brothel (and Other Unexpected Places to Understand Risk), is immediately at the head of the pack for that alone.\n\nThis 204-page investigation of risk is so thoroughly broad-minded in its approach and specific in its analysis, however, that readers from many different fields – certainly not economics alone – will find value and interest in its chapters.\n\nIn this book, Schrager assesses how risk works in real businesses or economic activities, and she addresses the nature of risk in situations as diverse as the legal brothel of the title, movie-making in Hollywood, paparazzi photography, and breeding Thoroughbred racehorses.\n\nThe thematic thread linking these and other endeavors covered in Schrager’s book is risk, that odious goblin of business and professional life that nearly everyone fears.\n\nSchrager not only defines risk but also sets forth the “rules of risk” that she sees being actively used by people, as well as those frequently being ignored. Most of us understand some of these rules, perhaps even practice them, but few of us understand them all. Even fewer, I expect, have thought through the process of risk and reward, plus the psychological requirements for managing them.\n\nOne example is the search for a lower-calorie cinnamon roll that Cinnabon won by keeping its original recipe and reducing the size of the bun to create a 350-calorie MiniBon. Sales rose. This was a lower-risk change to the cinnamon roll business than trying a diet pastry with different ingredients and likely different taste.\n\nThe most dangerous choice is following the risk-free path of doing nothing at all. This is also the norm for much of human activity because, for the most part, we are a risk-averse species. Or so economists thought until Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman introduced prospect theory, which “says when we weigh different options, the value we place on them depends on how much money we have when we start and if there is the possibility of loss. Humans aren’t risk-averse; they hate losing anything.” Anything.\n\nEspecially true for racing and breeding?\n\nRisk avoidance in breeding has brought us to the point that only stallions who are “first-year or proven” are in demand as the sire of weanlings or yearlings. This moderates somewhat at the sales of horses in training, when breeze time and radiographs tend to play a greater role. But what about all the stallions who fit in between those criteria?\n\nThose horses are being forced out of the marketplace so quickly that some are being sold before they have runners, as we have just seen with the sale of California Chrome to Japan, or before they even have foals on the ground, as we saw a few years ago with the champion juvenile Hansen. As a result, there is a dearth of good to useful sires who get lots of sound racehorses and winners but not many (or any) superstars.\n\nSchrager wrote that “We put a big weight on very likely or unlikely events and put almost no weight on anything that happens in between.” We, as horse breeders, veer strongly toward things that we perceive as very likely. For instance, we feel safer breeding to first-year sires because nobody has had a bad one. Yet.\n\nIn essence, we are so afraid of having our (and our expected buyers’) expectations dashed on the rocks of reality that we are putting ourselves in a corner, perhaps a corner that is untenable for the breed. If we as horsemen and breeders do not believe in our stock and support them with good mates, how is the breed to improve?\n\nIt won’t. At least not overall.\n\nThere are, however, some experienced breeders and horsemen who manage probability so well that they have consistent overall success. Two examples of this are Arthur Hancock and George Strawbridge.\n\nHancock was the co-breeder of Kentucky Derby winners Gato del Sol (by Cougar) and Fusaichi Pegasus (Mr. Prospector), as well as the co-owner of Kentucky Derby winner Sunday Silence. A critic might say the latter was luck, and it was. Hancock thought he was buying back the lanky near-black yearling when he bid him in for $17,000, but the breeder didn’t want the horse. But Hancock was not going out and throwing money – intentionally or otherwise – at a horse by Old Bupkis out of Something Thecats Draggedin. Sunday Silence was a select sale yearling by leading sire Halo out of a multiple stakes winner. Those are differences that matter, in the general and in the specific.\n\nStrawbridge breeds and races elite racehorses around the world. He has had top-class sprinters, milers, classic horses, and winners at the Breeders’ Cup. This year, he also bred the colt most likely to be named Horse of the Year: Bricks and Mortar (Giant’s Causeway), who is unbeaten in 2019 and closed his career with a brave victory in the Breeders’ Cup Turf. No breeder, however, can afford to keep and race and breed them all, and Strawbridge realized that Bricks and Mortar was a quite nice young prospect and had him consigned to the Keeneland September yearling sale, where he brought a profitable $200,000. For owners Klaravich Stables and Bill Lawrence, Bricks and Mortar has done rather more, but the breeder was correct in seeing the colt as a very desirable prospect who would help to balance the books. That is a pragmatic decision in balancing probability and profitability.\n\nThis was a good practical decision. And in like fashion, a balance of probability, profitability, horsemanship, and knowledge should help breeders, sellers, buyers, and stable managers moderate risk and improve the chances of success in a business and sport that is all about risk.\n\nThe continuing great challenge for any farm or stallion manager in standing and managing a young sire with a lower-price stud fee is getting enough mares, especially getting enough of the right mares. The challenge of getting sufficient volume to less-known or less-popular stallion prospects has been there since the days of Eclipse, but Spendthrift Farm owner B. Wayne Hughes, self-made billionaire, came up with a solution.\n\nThat was to send a young horse of this description to stud and offer breeding rights for the production of a live foal and then payment of the fee. This was labeled the “share the upside” program and struck gold with one of the first stallions that Spendthrift stood under the program: Into Mischief (by Harlan’s Holiday).\n\nApproximately 10,000 people in Central Kentucky nearly bought a breeding right in the horse. Not that many decided to go through with purchasing a breeding right contract, however, and Into Mischief now stands for $175,000 live foal. You can’t buy that kind of advertisement for your program. It has also been a source of continuing grief for farms that do not operate a program similar to Share the Upside.\n\nMany of Spendthrift’s subsequent stallion purchases have been wildly popular, and the farm has branched out into more expensive stallion purchases that stand for larger fees, such as Omaha Beach (War Front), $40,000; Vino Rosso (Curlin), $30,000; and Mitole (Eskendereya), $25,000. These seasons are not offered with a breeding right.\n\nAlso for 2020, the farm has a pair of lesser-priced prospects, including a son of Into Mischief, that stands available for the purchase of a breeding right. The son of Into Mischief is Maximus Mischief, unbeaten at 2 and winner of the 2018 Remsen Stakes (G2). The big bay was third in the G2 Holy Bull, his only subsequent start, and stands for $7,500 live foal.\n\nStanding for $5,000 live foal is six-time stakes winner Coal Front (Stay Thirsty), who was a stakes winner each year he raced (3 through 5). A two-time winner at the G2 level (Amsterdam Stakes and Godolphin Mile), Coal Front won a trio of G3 races (Gallant Bob, Mr. Prospector, and Razorback) that helped push his earnings to more than $1.8 million.\n\nA grand-looking dark brown, Coal Front is inbred 3×3 to A.P. Indy through champions Bernardini and Mineshaft.\n\nAnother striking dark brown colt out of a Mineshaft mare is Darley‘s Enticed (Medaglia d’Oro), who stands for $10,000 live foal. A winner of the G2 Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes at 2, Enticed was third in the G1 Champagne, then came back at 3 to win the G3 Gotham and finish second in the Wood Memorial.\n\nEnticed is out of one of the very best Mineshaft daughters, three-time G1 winner It’s Tricky, who showed her best form in winning the CCA Oaks, Acorn, and Ogden Phipps.\n\nOne of the attractions of Enticed is his resemblance to his famous father, leading sire and racehorse Medaglia d’Oro (El Prado). Grandsire El Prado is also sire of leading turf producer Kitten’s Joy, whose son Divisidero enters stud at Airdrie for 2020 ($7,500 live foal).\n\nA G1 winner twice in the Turf Classic at Churchill Downs, Divisidero won a half-dozen stakes over five campaigns from 3 through 7, earning more than $1.6 million.\n\nA medium-sized and sturdy horse who showed great consistency and soundness, Divisidero was a turf performer at a high level through a long career. He is also one of a handful of turf performers who have found a spot at stud this season, in contrast to the general trend over the past 20 years, when turf horses have had an uphill battle to find support at stud.\n\nIn addition to Divisidero, turf horses entering stud for 2020 include Demarchelier (Dubawi), Heart to Heart (English Channel), Lost Treasure (War Front), and Qurbaan (Speightstown).\n\nEntering stud at Claiborne, Demarchelier is a beautifully balanced son of leading international sire Dubawi (Dubai Millennium). Great-grandsire Seeking the Gold stood at Claiborne, and the farm bred and sold the dam of Sadler’s Wells, who is Demarchelier’s broodmare sire.\n\nLike Divisidero, Crestwood Farm’s new sire Heart to Heart had a long career, racing from 2 through 8, and won 13 stakes, including a pair of G1s, and earned more than $2 million. Inbred to Mr. Prospector and Northern Dancer, Heart to Heart was a fan favorite because of his dramatic racing style and the distinctive heart-shaped marking on his forehead.\n\nA strongly made horse, Heart to Heart is cast in the mold of his famous sire English Channel, one of the best sons of leading sire Smart Strike on the racetrack and at stud.\n\nOut of the Silver Deputy mare Ask the Question, Heart to Heart traces to the top-class 2-year-old Fair Astronomer, who was top-weighted filly on the Irish and English Free Handicap. He stands for $5,000 live foal.\n\nLost Treasure stands at Hill ‘n’ Dale for $5,000 live foal and was covered in greater depth in a previous story about his entering stablemate World of Trouble.\n\nUnbeaten at 2 and a stakes winner each year from 3 through 6, Qurbaan won the G2 Bernard Baruch at 5 and 6. A winner of four stakes, Qurbaan also placed in nine more, earning $854,408. Purchased at the 2013 Keeneland November sale as a weanling by Shadwell for $300,00, Qurbaan comes from the thriving international family of Japan’s champion Bubble Gum Fellow (Sunday Silence), Japan Derby winner Deep Brillante (Deep Impact), and classic-placed Candy Stripes (Blushing Groom), who is the broodmare sire of leading sire Candy Ride.\n\nQurbaan is the second jet-setting son of Speightstown standing at Shadwell, which also stands Tamarkuz, winner of the 2016 Breeders’ Cup Dirt Mile. With that gaudy G1 in his career finale and other high-class dirt-track performances, Tamarkuz stands for $10,000, compared to the $5,000 fee for Qurbaan.\n\nA stakes winner on turf who also shone on dirt, Flameaway (Scat Daddy) is by a stallion who sired a Kentucky Derby winner out of a mare by Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus, and that alone could have created some Derby fever. But the dashing chestnut won the G3 Sam Davis early in his 3-year-old season, defeating both Catholic Boy and Vino Rosso, then finished second to champion Good Magic in the G2 Blue Grass Stakes.\n\nThat was smart form, especially considering that Good Magic next ran second in the Kentucky Derby, but the colt’s only subsequent start that put him within 10 pounds of that rating was a second in the G2 Jim Dandy at Saratoga.\n\nAs a result of that decline in form, Flameaway enters stud at Darby Dan for $7,500, a fraction of the fees commanded by subsequent G1 winners, such as Catholic Boy and Vino Rosso.\n\nIn contrast to that early form is Airdrie’s other new stallion for 2020, Preservationist (Arch), who found his best form at 6 with victories in the G1 Woodward and the G2 Suburban. A big, rangy horse, Preservationist is by a stallion from an outlier among contemporary sire lines (the Turn-to line through English Derby winner Roberto). Arch sired 70 stakes winners, including champion Blame, and comes from the family of Courtly Dee.\n\nPreservationist looks like his male line, showing the ruggedness typical of Hail to Reason and Kris S., in particular. Yet despite their size and growthy type, both those sires could sire exceptional juveniles, as well as outstanding classic prospects and older horses.\n\nSo each of these new sire prospects for 2020 offers breeders hopes of success and unheralded athletic potential. Hope not only reigns supreme among the value-oriented breeder; it is a vital and constructive force. From the ranks of horses in this price range have come leading sires, including Into Mischief, War Front, and Mr. Prospector.\n\nIn the hyper-competitive world of managing and standing commercial stallions, the higher-end horses get a chance, frequently a superb chance, to prove whether they have the genetic and phenotypic qualities to make a successful sire.\n\nThe economic stress of the undertaking, however, means there is a pivot-point in the pricing of stallions, a point at which the market for stallion seasons balances, then goes down. That price point currently seems to be at about $15,000 for a live-foal nomination.\n\nAnd among the 2020 crop of entering sire prospects, there is one stallion at that price: World of Trouble.\n\nThe 4-year-old son of Kantharos (Lion Heart) is the second stakes winner out of the Valid Expectations (Valid Appeal) mare Meets Expectations. She is a half-sister to major stakes winner Bucchero and he is also by Kantharos.\n\nThat chestnut son of G1 winner and Kentucky Derby second Lion Heart is a key to World of Trouble finding his way to John Sikura’s Hill ‘n’ Dale Farm because Kantharos came to Hill ‘n’ Dale from Florida, “where he made it on his own,” Sikura said, “and he’s a horse on the rise that I believe is going to be a sire of the highest merit.”\n\nFrom one of the Kantharos crops bred in Florida, World of Trouble also was one of the fastest horses in the world, maybe the fastest. From five to seven furlongs, World of Trouble won eight stakes at 3 and 4, and the only sprint he lost in that span was the G1 Breeders’ Cup Turf Sprint that he lost to Stormy Liberal (Stormy Atlantic). He won all four of his starts in 2019, including the G1 Carter on dirt and the G1 Jaipur on turf. In the latter, World of Trouble outran Belvoir Bay and Om, who were first and second in the G1 Breeders’ Cup Turf Sprint at Santa Anita last month.\n\nSikura summarized: “World of Trouble is an accomplished, elite racehorse. Hard to find a horse who’s accomplished on both surfaces, especially at the G1 level. He had a world of talent. And physically, World of Trouble is a lovely horse, medium-sized, but very well made, and I guess that’s the reason he stayed so sound. You could breed a bigger, leggier mare to him or go type to type and have a beautiful prospect. Moves very well, very correct. He has added flesh since he came to the farm and is turning into a masculine, beautiful horse.”\n\nFrom discerning breeders, more is expected than simply good looks and G1 victories on a stallion prospect’s race record. Talent that transcends the generations is the image in the mist of Thoroughbred breeding.\n\nSikura said, “You can’t predict who will be a leading sire, but history has shown that the ‘freak racehorse’ when he reproduces himself, can be a major force at stud. And World of Trouble had freak speed. So, I’m definitely sending mares to the horse. We own a majority interest and have syndicated him.”\n\nWhereas World of Trouble had so much speed he could beat the gate, joining him among the ranks of stallions at Hill ‘n’ Dale is a lesser-known racer who earned high praise from his internationally known trainer, Aidan O’Brien.\n\nThis is the 4-year-old War Front (Danzig) horse Lost Treasure. An Irish-bred from one of Coolmore’s best families and from a dam by the wondrous classic sire Montjeu (Sadler’s Wells), Lost Treasure combines the two most vibrant strains of Northern Dancer.\n\nPriced at $5,000 live foal, Lost Treasure is priced among the lower tier of new stallions and is bucking the trend of the contemporary market. Sikura explained why he was attracted to the horse: “I saw him race in Ireland, and he is a beautiful, fast, masculine horse of great energy. Aidan thought the world of the horse, and as a 2-year-old, he was narrowly beaten in a G1 race in France. [O’Brien] told me that ‘this is a horse with world-class talent, but I never got the best out of him.’”\n\nSikura continued, “I know there will be doubters saying that he didn’t win a Grade 1, but being a student of history, I know that there have been sires like Vice Regent (Northern Dancer), who was lightly raced [two victories from five starts] and didn’t win a stakes but sired a champion in Deputy Minister and became an important sire on his own. I don’t know whether Lost Treasure can rise to that level, but we’re prepared to help him try. We’re going to send mares, and the Coolmore team are going to send mares. We’ll see how that works out.\n\n“Coolmore was going to stand Lost Treasure themselves,” Sikura said, “but I managed to persuade them to allow me to buy in and bring him over here. I’m going to follow my conviction and breed 15 to 20 mares of my own. They will do the same, and other smart people will work it out and send him some mares.”\n\nThere is some contrarian pragmatism in Sikura’s thinking, and he said that “with a shrinking foal crop and the incentive opportunities elsewhere, a lot of horses don’t come to Kentucky, and when you’re trying to make a new horse, that situation makes it tougher. It also makes you more accountable [due to the potential losses in the market]. So you have to sharpen your eye in getting a horse and backing him extensively.”\n\nOne of the fascinating things about the horses entering stud for 2020 is that they show such a wide variety, in both pedigree and racing character, that breeders are virtually sure to find one or more they can’t live without.\n\nIn addition to pro-tem divisional champions like Breeders’ Cup Classic winner Vino Rosso (by Curlin) and BC Sprint winner Mitole (Eskendereya), the higher-end new sires for 2020 also include racers like Catalina Cruiser (Union Rags), who is in the model of the tried and true fast miler on dirt, and Yoshida (Heart’s Cry), who is a top-class switch hitter on dirt and turf.\n\nFor next season, Catalina Cruiser goes to stud at Lane’s End as the fourth generation of a series of stallions who earned high honors at the Versailles, Ky., farm founded by Will Farish. Beginning at the beginning of Lane’s End, Dixieland Band (Northern Dancer) was one of the three original stallions at the farm, and he was an unqualified success as a high-quality sire and broodmare sire.\n\nAt Lane’s End, Dixieland Band sired 111 stakes winners, including French classic winner Egyptband, who won the Prix de Diane, as well as G1 winners Dixie Brass, Sharp Lisa, Spinning Round, and Dixie Union.\n\nDixie Union became an important sire at Lane’s End and got 48 stakes winners before his death at age 13 in July 2010. A big, scopy dark brown, Dixie Union sired G1 winners Dixie Chatter (Norfolk), Hot Dixie Chick (Spinaway), Overanalyze (Arkansas Derby), and Union Rags, winner of the G1 Champagne at 2 and the Belmont Stakes at 3.\n\nA very talented juvenile, Union Rags has risen to the lead among fourth-crop stallions of 2019 due to the quality of his later-maturing stock, such as Paradise Woods and Catalina Cruiser, although the stallion also sired the juvenile G1 winners Free Drop Billy (Breeders’ Futurity) and Union Strike (Del Mar Debutante). To date, Union Rags has 15 stakes winners, including five this year, and he will stand for $60,000 live foal in 2020.\n\nCatalina Cruiser comes from his sire’s first crop, like Paradise Woods and Union Strike, and the brawny chestnut will be priced at $20,000 live foal. He is out of a very “Lane’s End” pedigree. In addition to the generations of sires that stood at the farm, Catalina Cruiser is out of a mare by champion Mineshaft (A.P. Indy).\n\nA winner in his debut at 3, Catalina Cruiser won six of his subsequent eight starts at 4 and 5. The handsome horse won five times at the G2 level: the San Diego Handicap twice, the Pat O’Brien twice, and the True North, earning $711,100.\n\nWhereas Catalina Cruiser is the prototype for the American dirt miler, with his principal victories coming at distances from 6 ½ furlongs to 8 ½ furlongs, Yoshida is cut from a different bolt of cloth.\n\nFirst of all, the 5-year-old Yoshida wasn’t even bred in the U.S. He was bred in Japan by Northern Farm and is by the high-class racehorse Heart’s Cry.\n\nElliott Walden, president and CEO of WinStar Farm, said that “we wanted to bring back an outcross, especially something from Sunday Silence’s line, and Heart’s Cry is probably Sunday Silence’s second-best son behind Deep Impact.”\n\nTo get the colt, of course, WinStar and partners had to outbid some of the leading outfits in Japan. Walden recalled, “When Tom Ryan and I went to Japan, we were looking for a horse that could possibly come over here to stand at stud. We ended up buying five: two yearlings and three foals. At their premium sale, the breeders’ sales company auctions both at the same time in July, and the foals are still on the mares.\n\n“He was the most expensive horse we bought, paid about $800,000 U.S. for him. He was the one we wanted and the others were nice,” Walden said. “We felt so strongly about him that we stretched to get him, and fortunately it has turned out very well.”\n\nTom Ryan of SF Bloodstock recalled that, when the partners embarked on the Japan project, “we weren’t exactly targeting sons of Heart’s Cry but were definitely looking to get involved in the Deep Impact – Sunday Silence sire line. That said, it’s amazing the strides Heart’s Cry has taken in the last few years. He’s about the most universally successful stallion going right now.”\n\nAt the time of sale, the point that brought both Walden and Ryan on board for this particular colt was his physical appeal. Ryan said, “What made Yoshida appealing to me personally as a yearling was his physique and his athleticism. He moved as effortlessly then as he does now.”\n\nWalden was even more emphatic. He said, “When Yoshida was walking around the ring in the back [of the sale area], he gave me a message. He just had a presence and a sense of charisma that is something extra.”\n\nMessage received.\n\nYoshida has proven himself the most successful racehorse to be purchased and exported from Japan, where the purses are so rich that it is very challenging for U.S. or European owners to buy in the Japanese home market and then export to race elsewhere for relative peanuts.\n\nYoshida, however, has proven to be a “really special horse for the international development of our roster here at WinStar,” Walden said, and the horse has proven himself an unexpectedly versatile and talented and sound athlete. A winner in five of 18 starts over four seasons, Yoshida earned slightly more than $2.5 million, and his most important victories came in the G1 Turf Classic at Churchill Downs and the G1 Woodward on dirt at Saratoga, and the handsome bay affirmed his form on dirt with a second in the G1 Whitney and a third in the Woodward this year.\n\nIn truth, there was every reason to expect that a strongly built grandson of Kentucky Derby, Preakness, and Breeders’ Cup Classic winner Sunday Silence would prove just as effective on dirt as on turf, but Yoshida proved it, and no doubt, the marketplace will reward him for this accomplishment.\n\nSunday Silence’s sire Halo had been a champion on turf, as well as a multiple stakes winner on dirt, and his sire Hail to Reason was adept at getting horses whose form on dirt was as good as that on turf. This line goes back through Turn-to to Nearco’s high-class son Royal Charger, who carried high weights on turf in Europe and sired high-class performers, mostly on dirt, here in the States.\n\nInterestingly, Yoshida’s sire had a nearly identical career to Yoshida, winning five of 19 starts but earning slightly more than $8 million from the better purse structure in Japan. The sire’s best victories came in the G1 Dubai Sheema Classic and G1 Arima Kinen, and he was also second in the Japan Cup and third in the King George and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot.\n\nThe ability of Heart’s Cry to travel and reproduce his best form bought him a good place at stud at the Shadai Stallion Station. There, Heart’s Cry has produced some notable successes, including Japan Cup winner Cheval Grand, champion older horse Just a Way, and champion filly Lys Gracieux.\n\nJust like his sire, Yoshida has earned him a serious opportunity at stud through his racing excellence, and Walden noted that “typically we have pretty strong books. Our first-crop sires last year had books in the 160s. So, we are breeding a lot of mares. [Partners] China Horse Club and SF Bloodstock are breeders of significance and becoming more important. It’s good to have a strong group of shareholders to support these horses.”\n\n“SF plan to support Yoshida and will do so with confidence,” Ryan said. “He retired sound and performed at the highest level on a global stage on both surfaces. He has the makings of a very versatile stallion, and that’s exactly what the world needs more of.”"
