        "text": "Alan Porter’s 2024 Breeding Analysis for Zandon\n\nA grade one and multiple graded stakes winner from one of the most successful branches of the A.P. Indy line, Zandon has top-class form at two, three and four, winning or placing in 11 graded stakes, six grade ones.\n\nZandon is out of a mare by a grandson of Storm Cat and should be well-suited by crossing back over Storm Cat line mares. Zandon’s sire, Upstart, has a stakes winner out of a mare by Harlan’s Holiday and a stakes winner out of a mare by Harlan’s Holiday son, Majesticperfection, which suggest others Harlan’s Holiday sons, such as Into Mischief (sire of Goldencents and Maximus Mischief) and Shanghai Bobby. Upstart also has stakes winners out of mares by Bernstein and Pure Prize. Flatter, the grandsire of Zandon also has a graded winner out of a mare by Storm Cat son, Black Minnaloushe. We could also consider Storm Cat through Hennessy (sire of Henny Hughes, Johannesburg and Cactus Ridge, and grandsire of Storm Cat), Forest Wildcat (sire of Wildcat Heir and D’Wildcat), Forestry (sire of Shackleford and Discreet Cat), Tale of the Cat (sire of Lion Heart; grandsire of Kantharos), Stormy Atlantic and Yankee Gentleman.\n\nStorm Cat is a Northern Dancer line horse and Upstart and Flatter have also done well with the Danzig branch. Upstart has a stakes winner out of a mare by Lawyer Ron, and Flatter has a graded stakes winner by that horse’s sire, Langfuhr, a graded stakes winner out of a mare by Honor Grades and a graded stakes winner out of a mare by War Front (sire of Declaration of War, The Factor, Summer Front, Air Force Blue, Jack Milton and Hit it a Bomb). Other Danzig line options include Hard Spun, Boundary (sire of Big Brown), Belong to Me, War Chant and Exchange Rate.\n\nFrom the Sadler’s Wells branch of Northern Dancer, there are two stakes winners by Flatter out of mares by El Prado (sire of Medaglia d’Oro, Kitten’s Joy and Artie Schiller; grandsire of Violence and Bolt d’Oro). Sadler’s Wells can also be brought in through Galileo (represented in the U.S. by Magician and Cape Blanco) and Powerscourt. Flatter grade one winner Taris is out of a mare by Theatrical, a son of Sadler’s Wells’ three-quarters brother Nureyev, who could also be found through Fasliyev and Spinning World.\n\nFlatter also did very well with mares from the Deputy Minister branch of Northern Dancer with stakes winners out of mares by Awesome Again (sire of Ghostzapper, Paynter, Oxbow and Awesome of Course), French Deputy and Silver Deputy (also sire of Posse, Badge of Silver and Spring At Last; grandsire of Kodiak Kowboy).\n\nFrom the Mr. Prospector line Upstart has grade two winning and grade one placed Prerequisite out of a mare by Smart Strike (sire of Curlin, English Channel, Lookin At Lucky, Dominus and Square Eddie). He also has graded stakes winner Masqueparade out of a mare by Any Given Saturday, while Flatter has graded stakes winning and grade one placed Favorable Outcome out of a mare by that horse’s sire, Distorted Humor (also sire of Maclean’s Music, Jimmy Creed, Alternation, Brethren and Khozan).\n\nFlatter has enjoyed remarkable success with mares from the Fappiano branch of Mr. Prospector. His grade one winner Search Results is out of a mare by Candy Ride (sire of Twirling Candy and Gun Runner), from the Cryptoclearance branch which also supplied Victory Gallop, broodmare sire of Flatter graded stakes winner Ami’s Flatter. Flatter multiple graded stakes winner Avie’s Flater is out of a mare by Empire Maker (sire of Pioneerof the Nile and Cairo Prince, grandsire of American Pharoah and Classic Empire). Empire Maker is a son of Unbridled, himself broodmare sire of Flatter graded stakes winner Apart. Unbridled’s son, Unbridled’s Song is broodmare sire of Flatter grade two winner Flatlined, and he could be introduced through Liam’s Map, Cross Traffic, Rockport Harbor, First Defence, Songandaprayer, Midshipman, Even the Score, Half Ours and Old Fashioned. There is also a Flatter stakes winner out of a mare by Unbridled son, Grindstone, the sire of Birdstone, and Unbridled is also responsible for Broken Vow.\n\nFlatter has no less than four stakes winners out of mares by Fappiano son, Quiet American, who is grandsire of Midnight Lute. Fappiano is also sire of Rubiano (sire of Too Much Bling and Burning Roma).\n\nThere is also an Upstart stakes winner out of a mare by Mr. Prospector line stallion Two Punch (sire of Smoke Glacken), and there are further Flatter graded stakes winners out of mares from this line by Street Sense (by Street Cry, also sire of Street Boss) and Aldebaran, and stakes winners out of mares Seeking the Gold (sire of Cape Town, Mutakddim and Petionville), Proud Citizen (by Gone West, sire of Speightstown, Mr. Greeley, Elusive Quality and Grand Slam, and grandsire of Quality Road, Smarty Jones, El Corredor and Munnings).\n\nUpstart sired the multiple graded stakes winning Kathleen O out of a mare by Blame, who is by Arch (broodmare sire of a stakes winner by Flatter), from the Kris S. branch of Roberto. Roberto is also represented by Red Ransom (broodmare sire of a Flatter stakes winner) and Dynaformer (sire of Brilliant Speed, Point of Entry and Temple City). From the same Hail To Reason male line as Roberto, Flatter has two stakes winners out of Halo grandson, More Than Ready (sire of Daredevil, Verrazano and Ready’s Image).\n\nFlatter sired champion West Coast out of a mare by Honour and Glory (sire of Put It Back), from the Relaunch line that can also be brought in through Tiznow (sire of Tiz Wonderful, Colonel John, Gemologist, Morning Line and Tizway) and Bertrando, broodmare sire of a Flatter stakes winner, and sire of Officer. Relaunch is an In Reality line horse and there is also a Flatter graded stakes winner from the Valid Appeal branch, which can be brought in through Successful Appeal, Valid Expectations and Valid Wager.\n\nAlan Porter’s 2024 Breeding Analysis for Zandon\n\nA grade one and multiple graded stakes winner from one of the most successful branches of the A.P.
