        "text": "<p>Sterling silver two-piece bowl. Top piece is removable. Inscription reads: \"New York Racing Association, The Great American Stakes, Aqueduct, 1960, Won by, Patrice Jacobs, Hail To Reason.\" Stamped \"Sterling\" on the bottom. Hail to Reason's lineage spans to multiple Triple Crown race-winning horses. He was great grandsire to Barbaro (Kentucky Derby) and sired Proud Clarion (Kentucky Derby), Personality (Preakness Stakes) and Hail to All (Belmont Stakes). His career was in jeopardy when he stepped on a loose horseshoe during a workout and broke sesamoid bones in his front left foot. Owner Hirsch Jacobs and his son John took immediate action and made a cast for the foot. Luckily the foot healed and Hail to Reason had a successful stud career, winning the \"Leading Sire in North America\" award in 1970. Originally sold in the 2008 Christie's Important American Silver sale featuring the estate of Hall of Fame horse racing owner and trainer Hirsch Jacobs.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';\">Sourcing straight from the private collection of a world-renowned thoroughbred breeder comes a wonderful offering of nearly 40 horse racing trophies that Lelands is honored to feature in the 2019 Fall Classic. Originally purchased from the 2008 Christie&rsquo;s Silver Auction, these trophies source from the estate of Ethel and Hirsch Jacobs. We have devoted an entire category to this collection in which collectors will have many chances to own some of the earliest horse racing trophies to be offered publicly. Most of the trophies span back to 1950s-60s and include Hall of Fame horses such as Stymie, Searching and Affectionately.</span></p>"
