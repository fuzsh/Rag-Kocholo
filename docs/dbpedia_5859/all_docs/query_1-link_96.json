The odor of burning juniper is the sweetest fragrance on the face of the earth, in my honest judgment; I doubt if all the smoking censers of Dante's paradise could equal it.

As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.

It's a tension by which the living know they're alive.\"\n\n-- Ghanima (Children of Dune by Frank Herbert)\n\n\"Balance is what distinguishs a people from a mob.\"\n\n-- Maud 'Dib (Dune Trilogy by Frank Herbert)\n\n\"The joy of living, its beauty, is all bound up in the fact that life can surprise you.\"\n\n-- Leto Atrides (Dune Trilogy by Frank Herbert)\n\n\"Most deadly errors occur from obsolete assumptions.\"\n\n-- Bene Gesserit saying (Dune Trilogy by Frank Herbert)\n\n\"I have often been downcast, but never in despair; I regard our hiding as a dangerous adventure, romantic and interesting at the same time. In my diary I treat all the privations as amusing. I have made up my mind now to lead a different life from other girls and, later on, different from ordinary housewives. My start has been so very full of interest, and that is the sole reason why I have to laugh at the humorous side of the most dangerous moments.\"\n\n-- Anne Frank\n\n\"The life of man is but a succession of vain hopes and groundless fears.\"\n\n-- Montequieu\n\n\"Communism is just one big telephone company.\"\n\n-- Lenny Bruce\n\n\"Often, the most significant feature of good work is that it has kept something bad from happening to the company. How can we measure bad things that do not happen?\"\n\n-- Robert M. Tomasko\n\n\"I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody.\"\n\n-- Bill Cosby\n\n\"Nothing in the world is so powerful as an idea whose time has come.\"\n\n-- Victor Hugo\n\n\"Be like the bird that, passing on her flight awhile on boughs too slight, feels them give way beneath her, and yet sings, knowing that she hath wings.\"\n\n-- Victor Hugo\n\n\"The cost of living is dying.\"\n\n-- Seen on a T-shirt\n\n\"There is a thin line between courage and foolishness\"\n\n-- Robert Heckendorn\n\n\"A chicken is just one egg's way of making another egg.\"\n\n-- anon\n\n\"A messy office is a happy office. This office is delerious.\"\n\n-- anon\n\n\"There is only one true beast in the bull ring, the crowd.\"\n\n-- anon\n\n\"He who truly knows has no occasion to shout.\n\n-- Leonard Da Vinci\n\n\"Nothing strengthens authority so much as silence\"\n\n-- Leonard Da Vinci\n\n\"In rivers, the water that you touch is the last of what has passed and the first of that which comes; so with present time.\"\n\n-- Leonard Da Vinci\n\n\"Some people think the glass is half full. Others think it is half empty. I think the glass is too big.\"\n\n-- George Carlin\n\n\"Trying to be happy by accumulating possessions is like trying to satisfy hunger by taping sandwiches all over your body.\"\n\n-- George Carlin\n\n\"I keep six honest seving men\n\n(They taught me all I knew);\n\nTheir names are What and Why and When\n\nAnd How and Where and Who.\"\n\n-- \"The Elephants Child\", Rudyard Kipling [1865-1904]\n\n\"Every time I see an adult on a bicycle, I no longer despair for the future of the human race.\"\n\n-- H.G. Wells\n\n\"Bicycling is a big part of the future...it has to be....there is something wrong with a society that drives a car to work out at a gym.\"\n\n-- Bill Nye, the Science Guy\n\n\"To come to a place with preconceived notions and expectations of what you will get from it, is a very dangerous thing. Because you might actually succeed in accomplishing exactly what you came there to find. And in this so-called success you may not even know that you can fail utterly to discover far greater rewards that you might find otherwise. By this I don t just mean discovery of things about the place that you did not know were there, but rather discovery of things in, and about, yourself that you did not know you were capable of feeling and that can transform and elevate your life in ways you never knew possible.\"\n\n-- Guy Tal, photographer\n\n\"The rock is the great equalizer and the great liberator, the great reminder, the great setter of priorities, and the great debunker of illusions, dissonance, and delusions of grandeur.\"\n\n-- Guy Tal, photographer\n\n\"A place is not a place is not a place. Places assume meanings as we interact with them; as we accumulate experiences and memories in them; as we gain knowledge about them; as we evolve relationships with them; as we become familiar with them and comfortable in them. There is a world of difference between a place as partner in a lasting relationship, and a place considered as just a photographic subject. The latter does not interest me much. I have long found that my work is most meaningful to me as an expression of my life and my relationships with the world. Without such relationships, aesthetics alone, while enjoyable to view at times, do not move me to create. In creating I need more than just beauty; I need a story a good one and I need to be a character in that story. And my story unfolds here.\"\n\n-- Guy Tal, photographer\n\n\"To ride a bicycle is in itself some protection against superstitious fears, since the bicycle is the product of pure reason applied to motion. Geometry at the service of man! Give me two spheres and a straight line and I will show you how far I can take them. Voltaire himself might have invented the bicycle, since it contributes so much to man's welfare and nothing at all to his bane. Beneficial to the health, it emits no harmful fumes and emits only the most decorous speeds. How can a bicycle ever be an implement of harm?\"\n\n-- Angela Carter\n\n\"There is beauty in silence and there is silence in beauty and you can find both in a bicycle!\"\n\n-- Mehmet Murat Ildan\n\n\"Bicycle means simplicity and simplicity means happiness!\"\n\n-- Mehmet Murat Ildan\n\n\"Life is like a bicycle. To keep your balance you have to keep moving.\"\n\n-- Albert Einstein\n\n\"When I go biking, I repeat a mantra of the day's sensations: bright sun, blue sky, warm breeze, blue jay's call, ice melting and so on. This helps me transcend the traffic, ignore the clamorings of work, leave all the mind theaters behind and focus on nature instead. I still must abide by the rules of the road, of biking, of gravity. But I am mentally far away from civilization. The world is breaking someone else's heart.\"\n\n-- Diane Ackerman\n\n\"A bicycle does get you there and more.... And there is always the thin edge of danger to keep you alert and comfortably apprehensive. Dogs become dogs again and snap at your raincoat; potholes become personal. And getting there is all the fun.\"\n\n--Bill Emerson, \"On Bicycling,\" Saturday Evening Post, 1967 July 29th\n\n\"It is curious that with the advent of the automobile and the airplane, the bicycle is still with us. Perhaps people like the world they can see from a bike, or the air they breathe when they're out on a bike. Or they like the bicycle's simplicity and the precision with which it is made. Or because they like the feeling of being able to hurtle through air one minute, and saunter through a park the next, without leaving behind clouds of choking exhaust, without leaving behind so much as a footstep.\"\n\n-- Gurdon S. Leete\n\n\"Bicycling is the nearest approximation I know to the flight of birds. The airplane simply carries a man on its back like an obedient Pegasus; it gives him no wings of his own. \"\n\n--Louis J. Helle, Jr., Spring in Washington\n\n\"When the spirits are low, when the day appears dark, when work becomes monotonous, when hope hardly seems worth having, just mount a bicycle and go out for a spin down the road, without thought on anything but the ride you are taking.\"\n\n-- Arhur Conan Doyle\n\n\"... she will never know what it feels like to pump first over the crest of the hill with the others strung out behind her like the beads sliding off a broken necklace.\"\n\n-- anon (about bicycle racing)\n\n\"Klaatu barada nikto!\"\n\n-- From the movie \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\"\n\n\"If you ever get a second chance in life for something, go all the way.\"\n\n-- Lance Armstrong who won the Tour de France after fighting cancer\n\n\"Beyond 100,000 lines of code, you should probably be coding in Ada.\"\n\n-- P.J. Plauger\n\n\"I have recently been examining all the known superstitions of the world, and do not find in our particular superstition (Christianity) one redeeming feature. They are all alike founded on fables and mythology.\"\n\n-- Thomas Jefferson\n\n\"God, who gave us life, gave us liberty. Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God?\"\n\n-- Thomas Jefferson\n\n\"I distrust those people who know so well what God wants them to do, because I notice it always coincides with their own desires.\"\n\n-- Susan B. Anthony\n\n\"Sir, what you had there ...(cough)... was what we refer to as a focused, non-terminal, repeating phantasm, or a class 5 full roaming vapor .... real nasty one, too!\"\n\n-- Ray Stantz (From the movie Ghost Busters)\n\n\"For those who like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing they like\"\n\n-- Abraham Lincoln\n\n\"We can complain because rose bushes have thorns, or rejoice because thorn bushes have roses\"\n\n-- Abraham Lincoln\n\n\"As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy. Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the difference, is no democracy.\"\n\n-- Abraham Lincoln\n\n\"A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half-slave and half-free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved - I do not expect the house to fall - but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other.\"\n\n-- Abraham Lincoln\n\n\"There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law.\"\n\n-- Abraham Lincoln\n\n\"It is the eternal struggle between two principles, right and wrong, throughout the world. It is the same spirit that says 'you toil and work and earn bread, and I'll eat it.' No matter in what shape it comes, whether from the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride the people of his own nation, and live by the fruit of their labor, or from one race of men as an apology for enslaving another race, it is the same tyrannical principle.\"\n\n-- Abraham Lincoln\n\n\"Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation. We, even we here, hold the power and bear the responsibility.\"\n\n-- Abraham Lincoln\n\n\"The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.\"\n\n-- Abraham Lincoln\n\n\"You're not a statesman! A statesman is a dead politician. Lord knows we need more statesmen!\"\n\n-- Milo Bloom, Bloom County\n\n\"Politicians like to see cranes on the horizon.\"\n\n-- Kevin Stanley of the proposed new tallest building in the world, the Grollo Tower.\n\n\"Good tea. Nice house.\"\n\n-- Lt. Worf\n\nGuinan: \"It's an Earth drink. Prune juice.\"\n\nWorf: \"Warrior's drink!\"\n\n--Star Trek: The Next Generation, \"Yesterday's Enterprise\"\n\n\"Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra\"\n\n\"Shaka, when the walls fell.\"\n\n\"Sokath! His eyes open!\"\n\n\"Mirab, his sails unfurled!\"\n\n\"Temba his arms open.\"\n\n\"Temba at rest.\"\n\n--Star Trek: The Next Generation, metaphors from \"Darmok\" episode\n\n\"A syndicate makes sense to me. I'm a peaceful man at heart, but I'm sick and tired of all these hits. I hit Krako, Krako hits Teppo, Teppo hits me. There's too many bosses! We can't get anything done. I was thinking--if there was just one--maybe somebody like you as the top boss--then we could get things done!\"\n\n--Bela Oxmyx from the Star Trek episode \"A Piece of the Action\"\n\n\"A question. Since before your sun burned hot in space, and before your race was born, I have awaited ... a question.\"\n\n- The Guardian of Forever from Star Trek\n\nRocket Raccoon: [about Drax] His people are completely literal. Metaphors go over his head. Drax the Destroyer: Nothing goes over my head...! My reflexes are too fast. I would chatch it.\n\n- Guardians of the Galaxy\n\n\"The only matter I do not take seriously, boy, is you. Your politics bore me. Your demeanor is that of a pouty child. And apparently, you alienated my favorite daughter, Gamora. I shall honor our agreement, Kree, if you bring me the Orb. But return to me again empty handed... And I will bathe the starways in your blood.\"\n\n- Thanos to Ronan the Accuser, Guardians of the Galaxy\n\n\"Always listen to experts. They'll tell you what can't be done, and why. Then do it.\"\n\n-- Lazarus Long\n\n\"In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's there are few.\"\n\n-- Shunryu Suzuki\n\n\"If one really wishes to be master of an art, technical knowledge of it is not enough. One has to transcend technique so that the art becomes an 'artless art' growing out of the Unconscious.\"\n\n-- D. T. Suzuki in a forward to \"Zen in the Art of Archery\"\n\nRollo Lee: Now there are your meerkats, correct? (pointing)\n\nLauderbee: Don't do that please sir, please! They go straight for the throat!\n\nRollo Lee: Now this new plack of yours, Lauderbee, says that they are the piranha of the dessert. Is that right?\n\nLauderbee: They can strip a human carcass in 3 minutes, sir.\n\nRollo Lee: My encyclopedia says they are easily tamed and are often kepts as pets.\n\nLauderbee: Noooo, you've not been attacked by one, sir.\n\nRollo Lee: Nobody's been attacked by one...or if they have they've never noticed.\n\n-- from the movie Fierce Creatures\n\n\"I think ordinary people in this country are sick and tried of being told that ordinary people in this country are sick and tired. I'm certainly not, and I'm sick and tired of being told that I am!\"\n\n-- Monty Python\n\n\"And there shall in that time be rumours of things going astray, and there will be a great confusion as to where things really are, and nobody will really know where lieth those little things with the sort of raffia work base, that has an attachment they will not be there... At this time a friend shall lose his friends's hammer and the young shall not know where lieth the things possessed by their fathers that their fathers put there only just the night before ...\"\n\n-- Monty Python's Life of Brian\n\nMan 1: \"...
