        "text": "Undefeated in stakes competition at two, Fire At Will broke his maiden in a black-type stakes sprinting on the dirt, and marked himself as one of the best two-year-olds in the world on the grass with an impressive three lengths victory over an international field in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Turf (G1). He is by Declaration of War, a European Champion and classic sire who is the leading stallion son of War Front. Out of a mare by twice Leading Sire Kitten’s Joy, Fire At Will stems from the remarkable family of Rough Shod II, ancestress of at least 30 grade one sires, including the legendary Sadler’s Wells and Nureyev.\n\nFire At Will is an example of the very successful cross of War Front and his sons with Sadler’s Wells line mares which through mares by Galileo has produced two classic winners by Declaration of War. Sadler’s Wells will back in the fifth generation of Fire At Will’s foals, and this will allow him to cross back over Sadler’s Wells line mares. Galileo been represented in the U.S. by Noble Mission, Magician, Cape Blanco and Treasure Bay, and other other Sadlers’ Wells line horses to have stood in North America include Horse Chestnut, Perfect Soul, Northern Spur, Powerscourt and Sligo Bay. Fire At Will’s strain of Sadler’s Wells comes through El Prado, but this will be in his fourth generation his foals, and there are already stakes winners with El Prado inbreeding, which opens the possibility of trying that strain through mares by Medaglia d’Oro (himself broodmare sire of a Declaration of War stakes winner, and sire of Violence, Fast Anna, Vancouver, Astern and Warrior’s Reward), Artie Schiller and Paddy O’Prado.\n\nDeclaration of War also has a stakes winner out of a mare by a grandson of Nureyev, a three-quarters brother to Sadler’s Wells, which would encourage trying mares descending from Theatrical, Fasliyev (broodmare sire of a Declaration of War stakes winner), Peintre Celebre, Stravinsky (broodmare sire of a Declaration of War graded stakes winner), Unusual Heat, Atticus and Spinning World (broodmare sire of a Declaration of War stakes winner).\n\nFrom another branch of Northern Dancer, Declaration of War has four stakes winners out of Storm Cat line mares including from daughters of Hennessy (sire of Johannesburg, Henny Hughes and Cactus Ridge; grandsire of Scat Daddy) and Giant’s Causeway (sire of Eskendereya, Shamardal, First Samurai, Creative Cause, Not This Time and Carpe Diem), himself a brother to Freud. It would be interesting to bring in Storm Cat through Stormy Atlantic, a half-brother to the third dam of Fire At Will, and Storm Boot, who is also from this same family, with other sources including Tale of the Cat (sire of Lion Heart and Tale of Ekati and grandsire of Kantharos and Uncaptured), Harlan’s Holiday (sire of Into Mischief, Majesticperfection and Shanghai Bobby), Forestry (sire of Discreet Cat and Shackleford), After Market, Bluegrass Cat, Cat Thief, Stormin Fever, Forest Wildcat (sire of D’Wildcat and Wildcat Heir), Bernstein, Mountain Cat, Sir Cat, High Yield and Tabasco Cat.\n\nDeclaration of War and War Front have both done well with the Fappiano branch of Mr. Prospector, and Declaration of War has two stakes winners out of mares by Empire Maker, a son of Unbridled who is sire of Pioneerof the Nile and Bodemeister, and grandsire of American Pharoah, Cairo Prince and Classic Empire. Declaration of War has a stakes winner out a mare by another son of Unbridled, Unbridled’s Song, who has also done very well under War Front. Unbridled’s Song can be brought in through Liam’s Map, Arrogate, Songandaprayer, Cross Traffic, Rockport Harbor, First Defence, Old Fashioned, Half Ours, Dunkirk, Even The Score, Graydar, Mission Impazible and Noonmark. It would also be possible to bring Unbridled in through Broken Vow and Grindstone (sire of Birdstone) and other branches of Fappiano that could be worth considering include Quiet American, including through Midnight Lute, Cryptoclearance (sire of Victory Gallop; grandsire of Candy Ride, who in turn is sire of Twirling Candy), and Rubiano (sire of Too Much Bling and Burning Roma).\n\nFrom the Gone West branch of Mr. Prospector, Declaration of War has sired graded stakes winner Opry out of a mare by Speightstown (sire of Munnings, Speightster and Central Banker), a graded stakes winner out of a mare by Zafonic, and a stakes winner out of a mare by Raven’s Pass, a son of Elusive Quality (sire of Quality Road, Smarty Jones and Great Notion), while there is a War Front stakes winner out of a mare by Mr. Greeley (sire of El Corredor, Whywhywhy and Greeley’s Galaxy). This also encourages considering mares by Grand Slam (sire of Limehouse) and Proud Citizen.\n\nStill with the Mr. Prospector line, Declaration of War grade one winner Gufo is out of a mare by Petionville, and Declaration of War also has a stakes winner out of a mare by that horse’s sire, Seeking the Gold (who is also available through Mutakkdim and Cape Town). The War Front cross with mares from the Forty Niner branch has been a grade one-producing one and has worked for Declaration of War through Distorted Humor (sire of Flower Alley, Sharp Humor, Drosselmeyer, Maclean’s Music and Jimmy Creed), with additional success for War Front over mares by Coronado’s Quest and Trippi, Forty Niner can also be found through Editor’s Note, End Sweep, Jules, Luhuk, Gold Fever, Banker’s Gold, Roar and Twining. Fusaichi Pegasus – a horse bred like Distorted Humor – is broodmare of a Declaration of War graded stakes winner, and he is available through Roman Ruler and Bandini (again giving linebreeding to the family of Fire At Wil).\n\nThere is a War Front grade one winner out of a mare by Smart Strike, whose sons include Curlin – already broodmare sire of a graded stakes winner by Declaration of War – Lookin at Lucky and English Channel. There are graded stakes winners out of mares by Street Cry and his son Street Sense (broodmare sire of a Declaration of War graded stakes winner), with Street Boss, Street Party, Street Magician, New Year’s Day and Street Hero being other sources of that line. A son of War Front has a grade one winner out of a mare by City Zip, a son of Carson City, and a stakes winner out of mare by Five Star Day (also broodmare sire of Hit It a Bomb’s first crop graded performer, Costa Rica) which also suggests daughters of Pollard’s Vision or Cuvee, and Declaration of War has a graded stakes winner out of a mare by Gulch, sire of Thunder Gulch, and grandsire of Point Given.\n\nWar Front and sons have enjoyed tremendous success with mares from the A.P. Indy line. Particularly effective has been the cross with daughters of Pulpit, which has produced at least 13 stakes winners. This includes multiple graded stakes winner Silver Prospector, by Declaration of War out of a mare by Tapit (sire of Tapizar, Tapiture, Constitution, Tonalist. Frosted and Trappe Shot), which suggests other Pulpit sons, such as Sky Mesa (also broodmare sire of a War Front line stakes winner) and Stroll. There are also War Front stakes winners out of mares by Flatter (a brother to Congrats), Malibu Moon and Old Trieste, which also suggests trying daughters of Mineshaft (broodmare sire of a Declaration of War stakes winner and sire of Discreetly Mine and Dialed In), Bernardini and Girolamo.\n\nThe cross of War Front and sons with Roberto line mares has proved to be a very profitable one. Fire at Will’s second dam is by Arch, a grandson of Roberto, and she is a close relative to Blame, who would be interesting here. Arch is by Kris S. also sire of Brocco (broodmare sire of a War Front line stakes winner), Kissin Kris, Prized and Rock Hard Ten. There are two grade one winners by War Front out of mares by Roberto son Red Ransom (broodmare sire of a Declaration of War stakes winner), and three stakes winners out of mares by Dynaformer (sire of Point of Entry, Brilliant Speed and Temple City). Roberto is a Hail to Reason line horse, and from the Halo branch of that line there is a Declaration of War stakes winner out of a mare by More Than Ready (sire of Ready’s Image, Daredevil and Verrazano).\n\nWar Front carries Moon Glitter, sister to the influential sire, Relaunch, there are already three War Front line grade one winners with Relaunch in the dam.. We can note that War Front has grade one winners out of mares by Relaunch line stallions Officer and Tiznow (sire of Tiz Wonderful, Colonel John, Gemologist and Tizway). There is also a graded stakes winner of a mare by Relaunch son, Honour and Glory (sire of Put it Back).\n\nFrom the Blushing Groom line, War Front has a champion out of a mare by Rahy and a grade two winner out of a mare by Housebuster (by Mt. Livermore, also the sire of Orientate), while Declaration of War also has a stakes winner out of a mare from that line. War Front also has a champion out of a mare by Maria’s Mon (sire of Super Saver and Monarchos) and grade one winner out of a mare by Known Fact.\n\nA stakes winning sprinter by Into Mischief, Honest Mischief comes from a stallion producing family. A half-brother to the champion siring, First Defence, he is out of grade one winner Honest Lady, one of Seattle Slew’s fastest daughters. Herself out of grade one winner and Broodmare the Year Toussaud, Honest Lady was not only a brilliant sprinter, but is also half-sister to classic winner and outstanding sire, Empire Maker and to grade one winner and grade one sire Chester House.\n\nThe Into Mischief cross with mares from the Gone West branch of Mr. Prospector has been an extremely successful one. Daughters of Mr. Greeley have supplied Kentucky Derby (G1) and Breeders’ Cup Classic (G1) winner Authentic and stakes winner More Mischief; grade one winners Mia Mischief and Mischievous Alex are out of mares by Speightstown (sire of Munnings and Central Banker); from a mare by Grand Slam, Into Mischief sired graded winner Strict Compliance, and he has graded winner Somebeyay out of a mare by Grand Slam son, Limehouse. There are also Into Mischief stakes winners out of mares by Gone West sons Elusive Quality (sire of Quality Road, Smarty Jones and Great Notion) and Proud Mischief.\n\nInto Mischief has sired the brilliant Goldencents out of a mare by Banker’s Gold, and seven stakes winners, including grade one winners Life is Good and Practical Joke, out of mares by Distorted Humor (sire of Flower Alley – himself broodmare of an Into Mischief graded stakes winner – Sharp Humor, Drosselmeyer, Maclean’s Music and Jimmy Creed). Banker’s Gold and Distorted Humor are both sons of Forty Niner, a stallion who could also be introduced through mares by Coronado’s Quest, Gold Fever, Roar (broodmare sire of an Into Mischief stakes winner), Trippi (broodmare sire of an Into Mischief graded winner) and Twining.\n\nInto Mischief has crossed well with mares from the Fappiano line particularly through Unbridled, who appears as broodmare sire of his brilliant daughter Covfefe. There are four stakes winners out of mares by Unbridled’s Song, as well graded winner Maximus Mischief out of a mare by his son, Songandaprayer, and a stakes winner out of a mare by his three-quarters brother, Malabar Gold. Other sons of Unbridled’s Song including Liam’s Map, Mission Impazible, Midshipman, Rockport Harbor, Cross Traffic, Dunkirk, Graydar, Half Ours, Old Fashioned, Will Take Charge and Noonmark.\n\nThere is also a stakes winner out of a mare by Empire Maker (sire of Pioneerof the Nile and Bodemeister, and grandsire of American Pharoah, Cairo Prince and Classic Empire). Any mare with Empire Maker in the pedigree will be particularly interesting here, doubling the elite mare Toussaud. A son of Into Mischief has a stakes winner out of a mare by Broken Vow, and Grindstone and his son Birdstone are also worth considering. From the Cryptoclearance branch of Fappiano Into Mischief has graded stakes winner Conquest Enforcer out of a mare by Victory Gallop, and two stakes winners out of mares by Candy Ride (sire of Twirling Candy, who also gives inbreeding to Toussaud).\n\nInto Mischief has graded winner Golden Mischief out of a mare by Mr. Prospector son, Carson City, and graded winner Gas Station Sushi out of a mare by Carson City son Five Star Day, which also suggests daughters of City Zip. Into Mischief has sired stakes winners out of daughters of Mutakddim and Bob and John (both by Seeking the Gold, also sire of Petionville and Cape Town), and graded stakes winner Miss Mischief out of a mare by Lemon Drop Kid (by Kingmambo). Overall, almost any strain of Mr. Prospector might prove positive here, but we can note that Into Mischief has also sired graded winner Bye Bye out of a mare by Smart Strike (sire of Curlin – himself now broodmare sire of an Into Mischief stakes winner – Lookin At Lucky and English Channel) also has stakes winners out of mares by Thunder Gulch and Pulling Punches (by Two Punch, also sire of Smoke Glacken). It would also be interesting to experiment with mares by Street Sense, whose granddam is half-sister to Mr. Greeley, the broodmare sire of Authentic. From another branch of the sire line stemming from Mr. Prospector’s sire, Raise a Native, that of Majestic Prince, Into Mischief has graded stakes winner Mighty Mischief out of a mare by Super Saver (by Maria’s Mon), himself sire of Runhappy.\n\nTurning to the Northern Dancer line, we find that Into Mischief has enjoyed considerable success with mares from the Danzig line, including graded winner Can The Man out of a mare by Danzig himself, graded stakes winner Ain’t Easy out of a mare by Fastnet Rock (from the Danehill branch), a graded stakes winner out of a mare by Hard Spun, and stakes winners out of mares by Lil’s Lad and Polish Numbers. There are a number of other sources of Danzig that would appeal here, including Belong to Me, War Front (sire of Declaration of War, The Factor, Summer Front and Hit it a Bomb) and Exchange Rate.\n\nInto Mischief’s graded stakes winner Vyjack is out of a mare by Stravinsky, a son of the Northern Dancer horse, Nureyev. Other sources of Nureyev include Fasliyev, Spinning World, Theatrical and Atticus. He is also emerging as an option for the Medaglia d’Oro branch of Sadler’s Wells – a three-quarters brother to Nureyev – with a stakes winner out of a mare by Medaglia d’Oro (by El Prado) and another out of a mare by that horse’s son, Warrior’s Reward, with Medaglia d’Oro also being sire of Violence. This would suggest trying mares by other El Prado sons, Kitten’s Joy and Artie Schiller\n\nHonest Mischief’s dam is by Seattle Slew, which could make it worth trying him over mares from the sire line of Seattle Slew son A.P. Indy. On this cross we can note Into Mischief millionaire Owendale and graded winner Twenty Carat out of mares by Bernardini (sire of Stay Thirsty and To Honor and Serve) and graded stakes winner Hoosier Philly out mare by the similarly-bred Tapit (sire of Constitution, Cupid, Frosted, Tapizar, Tonalist, Tapiture and Trappe Shot). There are also Into Mischief line stakes winners out of mares by A.P Indy sons Aptitude and Congrats (a brother to Flatter), which additionally suggests introducing Pulpit (sire of Tapit as well as Sky Mesa and Stroll) as well as Malibu Moon, Mineshaft (sire of Dialed In and Discreetly Mine) and Girolamo.\n\nFrom the Relaunch line, Into Mischief has sired Champion Two-Year-Old Filly Wonder Wheel out of a mare by Tiz Wonderful, and graded winner Comical out of sister to Colonel John, both by Tiznow, and a son of Into Mischief is sire of multiple graded winner Mr. Money out of a mare by Tiznow (also sire of Gemologist and Tizway). From this line, Into Mischief also has a stakes winner out of a mare by Honour and Glory (sire of Put It Back), and a stakes winner out of a mare by Skywalker (sire of Bertrando and grandsire of Officer).\n\nInto Mischief’s spectatular daughter Gamine is out of a mare by Kafwain, and he also has graded winner One Liner out of a mare by that horse’s sire, Cherokee Run, and a stakes winner out of a mare by another son of that horse, Yonaguska. Into Mischief’s sire, Harlan’s Holiday sired Champion Shanghai Bobby out of a mare by Orientate (by Mt. Livermore, also sire of Housebuster and Peaks and Valleys), who is also broodmare sire of graded winner Wildman Jack by a son of Into Mischief. There is also a stakes winner by Into Mischief out of a mare by Blushing Groom son, Rahy.\n\nInto Mischief is sire of grade one winner Audible out of a mare by Gilded Time, from the Damascus line, and also has a graded winner Mischievous Mama out of a mare by Afternoon Deelites, who is also from that line and by Private Terms, a son of Private Account (who is available through Corporate Report, Personal Flag, Unaccounted For, Secret Hello and Valley Crossing). We can also note that Into Mischief has a graded winners Dayoutoftheoffice and Frank’s Rockette out of mares by Indian Charlie, sire of Uncle Mo (sire of Nyquist, Laoban and Outwork), Adios Charlie, Liaison and Cindago.\n\nPrepared by Alan Porter, Pedigree Consultants\n\nWinner of the Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes (G2) at two, Keepmeinmind won or placed in five other graded stakes including the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile (G1), Breeders’ Futurity (G1) and Woodward Stakes (G1). A son of Laoban, he is from the powerful Uncle Mo sireline.\n\nLaoban sired grade one winning two-year-old Simply Ravishing out of a mare by More Than Ready, from the Halo line, which in general has done well under Uncle Mo. More The Ready can be found through Daredevil, Ready’s Image and Verrazano. From other branches of this line Uncle Mo has graded stakes winner Royal Mo out of a mare by Saint Ballado (sire of Saint Liam), a brother to Devil’s Bag (sire of Devil His Due and Diablo),\n\nLaoban’s grade two winner Un Ojo is out of a mare by A.P. Indy, and he has also sired two stakes winners out of mares by Bernardini (sire of Stay Thirsty and To Honor and Serve), who is also broodmare sire of an Uncle Mo grade one winner. Laoban is also sire of stakes winner Les Bon Temps out of a mare by Tapizar, a son of Tapit (also sire of Constitution, Tapiture, Frosted, Trappe Shot, Race Day and Concord Point). Tapit in turn is by A.P. Indy son, Pulpit, the broodmare sire of Uncle Mo classic winner Mo Donegal. From other branches of this line, Champion Vequist is by a son of Uncle Mo, out of a mare by Mineshaft (sire of Dialed In and Discreetly Mine) and there are three stakes winners out of Malibu Moon mares. Other sources of A.P. Indy include Congrats, Flatter, Jump Start, Golden Missile, Old Trieste and Stephen Got Even. A.P. Indy is a son of Seattle Slew, and Uncle Mo also sired the brilliant sprinter Yaupon out of a mare by Seattle Slew son, Vindication.\n\nUncle Mo and sons have done very well with mares from the Storm Cat line this cross producing more than 20 stakes winners. Four of these are by Keepmeinmind’s sire, Laoban, and are out of mares by Stormy Atlantic; Tale of Ekati, a son of Tale of the Cat, sire of Lion Heart and grandsire of Kantharos and Uncaptured; Cactus Ridge, by Hennessy, the sire of Henny Hughes and Johannesburg, and grandsire of Scat Daddy; and Harlan’s Holiday, sire of Into Mischief, Majesticperfection and Shanghai Bobby.\n\nOther Storm Cat line stallions to work under Uncle Mo and sons are Forestry (sire of Discreet Cat and Shackleford), the broodmare of Champion Two-Year-Old and Kentucky Derby winner Nyquist. Uncle Mo stakes winner, Thrilled, is out of a mare by Giant’s Causeway (sire of Eskendereya, Shamardal – both broodmare sires of Uncle Mo graded stakes winners – First Samurai, Creative Cause, Not This Time and Carpe Diem). Uncle Mo stakes winner Clipthecouponannie is out of a mare by Freud, a brother to Giant’s Causeway, and he also has a stakes winner out of a mare by After Market, who is bred on the same cross as Giant’s Causeway and Freud. Uncle Mo’s multiple graded winner Envoutante is out of a mare by Bluegrass Cat, and there is also a stakes winner out of a mare by Tactical Cat. This also suggests trying mares by Cat Thief, Stormin Fever, Storm Boot, Forest Wildcat (sire of D’Wildcat and Wildcat Heir), Bernstein, Mountain Cat, Sir Cat, High Yield and Tabasco Cat.\n\nStorm Cat is a Northern Dancer line horse, and from another branch of Northern Dancer, Uncle Mo has sired graded stakes winner Epical out of a mare by Deputy Minister. From sons of that horse he has stakes winner Mo Dont No out of a mare by Defrere, a brother to Dehere (sire of Graeme Hall) and stakes winner King For a Day out of a mare by French Deputy. Uncle Mo’s sire, Indian Charlie and sons have also been represented by a graded winner out of a mare by Touch Gold. The Deputy Minister line can also be brought in through Silver Deputy (also sire of Posse), Awesome Again (sire of Ghostzapper, Paynter, Oxbow and Awesome of Course), Salt Lake, Forest Camp and Deputy Commander.\n\nUncle Mo has done well with mares from the Sadler’s Wells branch of Northern Dancer. His graded winner Donna Veloce is out of a mare by Montjeu and stakes winner Galilean out of a mare by El Prado (sire of Medaglia d’Oro, Kitten’s Joy – himself broodmare sire of an Uncle Mo stakes winner – and Artie Schiller), both by Sadler’s Wells.\n\nUncle Mo has already shown an extremely strong affinity for mares from the Fappiano line. Keepmeinmind is out of a mare from the Cryptoclearance branch of that line, and should cross well over other branches of Fappiano. From the Unbridled branch Uncle Mo is sire a graded winner out of a mare by Unbridled himself, and has grade one winner Outwork out of a mare by Empire Maker (sire of Pioneerof the Nile and Bodemeister, grandsire of Cairo Prince). Uncle Mo has also done well with mares by Unbrilded’s son, Unbridled’s Song is broodmare sire of Uncle Mo graded winners Girl Daddy and Uncle Chuck, and Unbridled’s Song is also sire of Midshipman – broodmare sire of Uncle Mo grade one winner Golden Pal – Songandaprayer, First Defence, Old Fashioned, Zensational, Rockport Harbor, Political Force, Even The Score, Dunkirk, Half Ours, Buddha and Eurosilver.\n\nUnbridled can also be brought in through Broken Vow, Grindstone, Birdstone and Red Bullet. From other branches of Fappiano, Uncle Mo is sire of graded stakes winner Mo Tom out of a mare by Rubiano (whose son Burning Roma is broodmare sire of a stakes winner by a son of Uncle Mo, also suggesting Too Much Bling), and Indian Charlie – the sire of Uncle Mo – sired graded winner Two Trail Sioux out of a mare by Quiet American (sire of Real Quiet and grandsire of Midnight Lute).\n\nFrom other branches of Mr. Prospector – the sire of Fappiano – Uncle Mo has done very well with mares from the Gone West line. Gone West is here through Speightstown, but Speightstown will in the fourth generation of the pedigree, allowing for crossing back with that strain through Speightown’s sons, Munnings and Central Banker. Uncle Mo is also sire of graded winner Rally Cry from a mare by Gone West himself, and has grade one winner Gomo and graded stakes winner Lost Raven out of mares by Gone West son, Elusive Quality. It might also be worth trying mares by Elusive Quality sons, Smarty Jones and Quality Road, as well as mares by other Gone West line stallions such as Grand Slam, Mr. Greeley and Proud Citizen.\n\nUncle Mo has graded winner Moon Colony out of a mare by Carson City, the sire of Flying Chevron (broodmare sire of a champion by Uncle Mo’s sire, Indian Charlie), City Zip, Lord Carson, Good and Tough, Cuvee, Pollard’s Vision and Five Star Day. There is also an Uncle Mo stakes winner out of a mare by Smoke Glacken, as well as graded winner Mo’ Green, out of mare by that horse’s sire, Two Punch. There are graded stakes winners out of mares by Square Eddie and his sire, Smart Strike (also sire of Curlin, Lookin At Lucky and English Channel). There are also stakes winners out of mares by Northern Afleet (sire of Afleet Alex) and the similarly-bred Lemon Drop Kid. Stakes winning Conquest Mo Money is out of a mare by Seeking the Gold (the sire of Mutakddim, Petionville and Cape Town). Uncle Mo also has graded stakes winner Front Pocket Money out of a mare by Fusaichi Pegasus (sire of Roman Ruler), a horse bred on similar lines to Distorted Humor (sire of Jimmy Creed, Maclean’s Music and Flower Alley).\n\nLaoban has a stakes winner out of a mare by Successful Appeal from the In Reality line, and from the Relaunch branch of that line, Uncle Mo sired stakes winner Forevamo out of a mare by Slew Gin Fizz, a son of Relaunch, a line that might be brought in through Tiznow, the broodmare sire of Uncle Mo stakes winner My Aunt Mo (sire of Tiz Wonderful and Colonel John), Skywalker, Bertrando, Officer and Honour and Glory (sire of Put It Back).\n\nFrom the Roberto line, Uncle Mo has multiple grade one winner Bast out of a mare by Arch (sire of Blame), a son of Kris S., and two stakes winner, one graded, out of mares by Dynaformer.\n\nA talented, graded stakes winning miler, The Lieutenant, is a half-brother to Justify – the only Triple Crown winner to retire undefeated – and is by Street Sense – the first ever winner of the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile and Kentucky Derby.\n\nThe Lieutenant is half-brother to the mighty Justify, who is by Scat Daddy, a son of Johannesburg, from the Hennessy branch of the Storm Cat line, and Hennessy can also be introduced through Henny Hughes and Catus Rdige. The cross of Street Sense and his sons with Storm Cat line mares has been an exceptionally successful one with grade one winner Callback out of a mare by Forest Wildcat (sire of Wildcat Heir and D’Wildcat); grade one winner Street Fancy out of a mare by Cat Thief; graded stakes winner Tiger Moth out of a mare by Sir Cat; and stakes winners out of mares by Giant’s Causeway (sire of First Samurai, Freud, Eskendereya, Cowboy Cal, Creative Cause, Frost Giant, Hold Me Back, Heatseeker and Noble Causeway), Forestry (sire of Discreet Cat and Shackleford), Stormy Atlantic and Stormin Fever, and Storm Cat might also be brought in through Tale of the Cat (who is bred similarly to Johannesburg, the grandsire of sire Justify, and is sire of Lion Heart and grandsire of Kantharos), Storm Boot, Storm Creek, Sea of Secrets, Harlan’s Holiday (sire of Into Mischief), Bernstein, Mountain Cat, High Yield, Tactical Cat and Tabasco Cat.\n\nStreet Sense has also done very well with mares from the Danzig branch of Northern Dancer, this cross producing ten stakes winner. Four of these, including grade one winners Hallowed Crown and Politeness, are out of mares from the Danehill branch. There is a grade two winner and a grade three winner out of a mare by Danzig Connection, and a grade two winner out of a mare by Cape Cross, a son of Green Desert, and a stakes winner out of a mare by Boundary (sire of Big Brown). It might also be worth introducing Belong to Me, Dayjur, Exchange Rate, War Chant, Langfuhr, Lost Solider, Hard Spun and War Front (who would give Relaunch and a sister).\n\nOut of mares from the Sadler’s Wells branch of the Northern Dancer, Street Sense has a graded stakes winner out of a mare by Singspiel, a graded winner out of a mare by Horse Chestnut, and stakes winners out of mares by Medaglia d’Oro and his sire, El Prado (also sire of Kitten’s Joy and Artie Schiller) and Galileo (represented in the U.S. by Cape Blanco and Magician). There has also been success for Street Cry – sire of Street Sense – and sons with mares descending from Sadler’s Wells’ three-quarters brother, Nureyev, including via Atticus and Stravinsky, with other sources including Theatrical, Spinning World and Fasliyev.\n\nStreet Sense is out of a mare by Ghostzapper, a son of Awesome Again, who is by Deputy Minister. It could be worth crossing The Lieutenant back over mares from other branches of Deputy Minister, including Silver Deputy (sire of Posse, who should be particularly good here, Badge of Silver and Spring at Last), Touch Gold (sire of Mass Media and Medallist), Dehere (sire of Graeme Hall), Deputy Commander, French Deputy, Forest Camp and Defrere.\n\nStreet Sense has sired six stakes winners out of mares by A.P. Indy, graded winners Avery Island and Doctor Mounty among them. The Lieutenant’s second dam is a grade one placed daughter of the A.P. Indy son, Pulpit, so it would be interesting to introduce the similarly-bred Mineshaft (sire of Discreetly Mine and Dialed In), Malibu Moon, Flatter and Congrats. Full Mandate is a reverse A.P. Indy/Deputy Minister cross to the dam of The Lieutenant, and other A.P. Indy sources include Stephen Got Even (sire of First Dude), Friends Lake, Golden Missile, Majestic Warrior and Jump Start.\n\nCrossed back over mares from his own Mr. Prospector sire line, Street Sense sired grade one winner Wedding Toast out of a mare by Coronado’s Quest, a son of Forty Niner, also sire of Distorted Humor (who himself is responsible for Any Given Saturday, Cowtown Cat, Drosselmeyer, Flower Alley, Jimmy Creed, Maclean’s Music and Sharp Humor), End Sweep (also sire of Trippi and Precise End), Twining, Roar, Jules, Gold Case, and Gold Fever. Still with the Mr. Prospector line, Street Sense grade one winner McKinzie, is out of a mare by Petionville, and there is also a Street Sense graded stakes winner out of a mare by that horse’s sire, Seeking the Gold, also sire of Petionville and Cape Town. From the Fappiano branch of Mr. Prospector, Street Sense has stakes winners out of mares by Unbridled and his son, Grindstone (sire of Birdstone). Unbridled is also sire of Broken Vow, Empire Maker (sire of Pioneerof the Nile and Bodemeister), and Unbridled’s Song, himself sire of Rockport Harbor, First Defence, Old Fashioned, Half Ours, Dunkirk, Songandaprayer and Even The Score.\n\nThe cross of Street Sense over mares from the Damascus line has yielded stakes winners from daughters of Time For a Change, Gilded Time and Personal Flag. Street Sense has also sired grade one winner Sweet Reason out of a mare by Mt Livermore (sire of Orientate, Housebuster and Peaks and Valleys) and stakes winner Silverette out of a mare by Holy Bull (sire of Macho Uno and Flashy Bull).\n\nPrepared by Alan Porter, Pedigree Consultants.\n\nA talented, graded stakes winning miler, The Lieutenant, is a half-brother to Justify – the only Triple Crown winner to retire undefeated – and is by Street Sense – the first ever winner of the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile and Kentucky Derby.\n\nThe Lieutenant is half-brother to the mighty Justify, who is by Scat Daddy, a son of Johannesburg, from the Hennessy branch of the Storm Cat line, and Hennessy can also be introduced through Henny Hughes and Catus Rdige.

Street Sense has also sired grade one winner Sweet Reason out of a mare by Mt Livermore (sire of Orientate, Housebuster and Peaks and Valleys) and stakes winner Silverette out of a mare by Holy Bull (sire of Macho Uno and Flashy Bull).\n\nPrepared by Alan Porter, Pedigree Consultants.\n\nThe exceptionally speedy Union Jackson – described as “..brilliant..” by his Hall of Fame trainer, Steve Asmussen – is by two-time Horse of the Year and exceptional sire, Curlin, out of Hot Dixie Chick, who was not only the fastest two-year-old filly of her crop, but is also half-sister to Kentucky Derby (G1) victor, Always Dreaming.\n\nCurlin is out of a mare by Deputy Minister, a broodmare sire who worked very well under Curlin’s sire, Smart Strike. Breeding Curlin back over Deputy Minister line mares has proved to work well providing Travers Stakes (G1) winner Keen Ice out of a mare by Awesome Again (sire of Ghostzapper, Awesome of Course and Daaher), multiple grade one winner Curalina out of a mare by Graeme Hall (by Dehere, a brother to Defrere), and a stakes winner out of a mare by Silver Deputy (sire of Posse, Badge of Silver and J Be K, and grandsire of Kodiak Kowboy). Other sources of Deputy Minister include Touch Gold (sire of Mass Media and Medallist), Deputy Commander, Salt Lake and French Deputy.\n\nAnother very strong cross for Smart Strike has been with Northern Dancer through Danzig, which for Curlin has supplied Champion Two-Year-Old Good Magic out of a mare by Hard Spun; four stakes winners, including grade two winner Irish War Cry, out of mares by Polish Numbers; and stakes winners out of daughters of Ascot Knight, Pine Bluff and Foxhound. This would also invite daughters of Belong to Me (broodmare sire of Smart Strike’s Champion Lookin At Lucky), Chief’s Crown (sire of Concerto; grandsire of Bellamy Road), Boundary (sire of Big Brown), Dayjur, Honor Grades, Exchange Rate, Langfuhr, War Chant and War Front.\n\nCurlin has already developed a strong affinity for Storm Cat line mares, including grade two scorer Diversy Harbor and classic placed Ride on Curlin and a total of five stakes winners out of mares by Storm Cat himself. From mares by sons of Storm Cat come graded stakes winner Ocean Knight and stakes winner Curlin’s Honor out of a mare by Stormy Atlantic, graded stakes winner Gladiator King out of a mare by Hennessy (sire of Johannesburg, Henny Hughes and Cactus Ridge, grandsire of Scat Daddy), and graded winner King Zachary out of a mare by Giant’s Causeway (sire of First Samurai, Freud, Eskendereya, Cowboy Cal, Creative Cause, Frost Giant, Hold Me Back, Heatseeker and Noble Causeway), stakes winners Theogany and Chaos Theory from mares by Tale of the Cat (sire of Lion Heart, who might work well, as might his son, Line of David). There are also Smart Strike stakes winners out of mares by Storm Cat sons Mountain Cat, Storm Creek and and this also suggests daughters of such as Tabasco Cat, Forest Wildcat (sire of Wildcat Heir), Bernstein, Cat Thief, Forestry, Stormin Fever, Sir Cat, Storm Boot and Tactical Cat.\n\nStorm Cat is a son of Storm Bird, and that horse’s genetic relative Nijinsky II has also worked well under Smart Strike, including a grade one winner by Strawberry Road, and Canadian classic winner, Breaking Lucky, out of a mare by Sky Classic (giving inbreeding to the family of Smart Strike). Consider also daughters of Royal Academy (a close relative to Storm Cat), Shadeed, Alydeed, Seattle Dancer and Sword Dance.\n\nFrom the Nureyev branch of Northern Dancer, Curlin is sire of classic winner Palace Malice out of a mare by Royal Anthem, and a stakes winner from a mare by that horse’s sire, Theatrical, and graded winner Texas Ryano out of a mare by Great Commotion. Smart Strike and sons have three stakes winners, two graded, out of mares by Stravinsky, and mares by Atticus, could also be tried. Nureyev is a three-quarters brother to Sadler’s Wells, and there are 11 stakes winners on a cross of Smart Strike and sons, including from daughters of El Prado (sire of Medaglia d’Oro, Kitten’s Joy and Artie Schiller) and Horse Chestnut.\n\nSmart Strike crossed very well with mares by Wild Again (by Northern Dancer’s three-quarters relative, Icecapade), and Curlin has stakes winner Stopshoppingdebbie out of a mare by that horse. Other Wild Again sons, such as Wild Rush or Milwaukee Brew could also be considered.\n\nCurlin has sired Champion Stellar Wind out of a mare by A.P. Indy son, Malibu Moon, and there are also two Smart Strike grade one winners out of mares by A.P. Indy himself, as well as from daughter of Bernardni (sire of Algorithms, Stay Thirsty and To Honor and Serve) and Pulpit (sire of Sky Mesa, Tapit – broodmare sire of Curlin classic placed graded winner Tenfold – Sightseeing and Stroll; grandsire of Concord Point, Trappe Shot and Tapizar). This also suggests considering daughters of Congrats, Flatter, Mineshaft (sire of Discreetly Mine and Dialed In), Golden Missile, Old Trieste, Jump Start and Stephen Got Even. Curlin’s classic winner Exaggerator is out of a mare by Seattle Slew son Vindication; his grade two winner Moulin de Mougin is out of a daughter of Avenue of Flags; and two-year-old grade one scorer Off the Tracks is out of a mare by Boston Harbor, by Seattle Slew son, Capote (also sire of Matty G. and grandsire of Mayakovsky).\n\nCurlin has graded winner Curlin’s Approval out of a mare by Caro son, With Approval. Union Jackson’s granddam is a graded stakes winning daughter of Caro line stallion In Excess, and duplicating that strain through Uncle Mo, looks particularly interesting, with In Excess also available through Uncle Mo’s sire, Indian Charlie (also sire of Adios Charlie, Bwana Charlie and Liaison), and his sire Siberian Express, also appearing as sire of Siberian Summer. There is also a graded stakes winner by a son of Smart Strike out of a mare by Cozzene (sire of Mizzen Mast and Alphabet Soup).\n\nThere is a grade one winner by Smart Strike out of a mare by Rahy from the Blushing Groom line, and Curlin has a stakes winner on the same cross. Smart Strike also has a stakes winner out of a mare by Blushing Groom son, Runaway Groom (sire of Cherokee Run; grandsire of Yonaguska and Kafwain).\n\nSmart Strike and sons have done very well with mares from the Roberto line, with a grade one winner out of a mare by Lear Fan, a graded winner out of a mare by Red Ransom (and a stakes winner out of a mare by his son, Hold For Gold), and stakes winners out of mares by Blumin Affair (by Dynaformer), Silver Hawk and Kris S. (sire of Arch, Prized, You and I and Rock Hard Ten). Roberto is a Hail to Reason line horse, and from the Halo branch of the line there is a\n\nFrom the In Reality line Curlin has a stakes winner out of a mare by Valid Expectations (by Valid Appeal, also sire of Valid Wager and Successful Appeal), and from the Relaunch branch stakes winners from daughters of Honour and Glory (sire of Put It Back) and Bertrando (sire of Officer). This also suggests daughters of Tiznow (sire of Tiz Wonderful).\n\nThe dam of Union Jackson is a half-sister to Kentucky Derby (gr. I) winner Always Dreaming, by Bodemeister, a son of Empire Maker (also sire of Pioneerof the Nile), from the Unbridled/Fappiano branch of Mr. Prospector. Smart Strike line stallions have outperformed opportunity with Unbridled line mares, particularly through Unbridled’s Song, the sire of Songandaprayer, First Defence, Half Ours, Old Fashioned, Rockport Harbor, Buddha, Dunkirk, Eurosilver, Even the Score, Mission Impazible, Noonmark, Value Plus (broodmare sire of a Smart Strike stakes winner) and Zensational. Other sources of Unbridled include Grindstone (whose son, BIrdstone, sired a Kentucky Derby (gr. I) winner out of a Smart Strike mare) and Broken Vow. Another from the Fappiano line who would work well here is Midnight Lute, a parallel Mr. Prospector/Deputy Minister cross to Curlin. From other branches of Mr. Prospector, Curlin is sire of graded stakes winner Vino Rosso out of a Street Cry mare bred on a parallel Mr. Prospector/Deputy Minister cross to Curlin; graded stakes winner Curlin Road out of a mare by Coronado’s Quest (by Forty NIner, who might also be brought in through Distorted Humor), stakes winner Bonita Bianca, out of a mare by Artax (by Marquetry, a son of Conquistador Cielo) and stakes winner Flash Forward, out of a mare by Miswaki (sire of Black Tie Affair).\n\nCurlin also has grade one winner Connect and stakes winner Eurphrates out of mares by Holy Bull (sire of Flashy Bull and Macho Uno) and graded stakes winners Terra Promessa and Valadorna out of mares by Yes It’s True.\n\nPrepared by Alan Porter, Pedigree Consultants"
