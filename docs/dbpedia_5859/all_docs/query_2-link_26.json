        "text": "Having established himself as the dominant horse in Macau – where he became the first Triple Crown winner – Luen Yat Forever is set to return to his homeland, Australia, to tackle top-class opposition. The announcement was made following his win in last Saturday’s Star of The Sand Stakes (Macau gr. II event), and the plan calls for his homecoming to be in the Sir Rupert Clark Stakes (gr. I) at Caulfield in mid-September.\n\nFrom a pedigree standpoint, Luen Yat Forever is interesting as he is bred on a Danzig/Danzig cross. His sire, Honours List, is an Irish-foaled son of Danehill, and his dam is from an Australia shuttle crop sired by Langfuhr (TrueNicks,SRO) (giving him Danzig 3 x 3). Boosted by the fact that there are so many Danehill line horses in Australia, the cross of his sons and grandsons over Danzig line mares is becoming a very frequent one, and has so far produced at least 22 stakes winners, three of them grade I. Luen Yat Forever’s pedigree might be helped by the fact that both his sire and dam are Danzig/Hail to Reason crosses, making him a “parallel pattern” horse. In the dam’s side, the Hail to Reason comes in through Halo, and of course Danehill is inbred to Natalma, a half sister to Halo’s dam, Cosmah.\n\nStaying with Australian-breds, and another horse who has multiple Almahmoud through Natalma and Cosmah, we come to Gingerbread Man, winner of The Magic Millions Juvenile Championship (local gr. III) in Singapore. He is from the second Southern Hemisphere crop of Shamardal (TrueNicks,SRO), who has been on fire in both Europe and Australia. The dam is by Hurricane Sky, who brings in Sir Ivor, a horse who is cropping up an awful lot of times in Shamardal’s good winners.\n\nWe thought that the Dr. Fager line might be all but gone, but on the most recent weekend, it was represented by Wendy, who captured the Clasico Criadores Mexicanos (a local gr. I in Mexico). Her sire is Alegandro De, a stakes winner in Mexico, who is by Zarkoff, by Good Doctor (by Dr. Fager out of Speedwell, a three-parts-sister to Secretariat). Wendy’s dam is by El Villano, who is from the Ribot line, via Con Brio II. She’s also the first mare I’ve ever seen inbred to More Megaton (who appears 3 x 3). He was a prolific California speedster in the mid-sixties, and by the brilliant English speedster and subsequently successful West Coast sire The Pie King.\n\nThe colt’s edition of the same race was taken by Capuccine, who tallied by nine lengths over Jethro (by Saarland out of a Signal Tap mare, so a Fappiano/Fappiano cross). Capuccine is by the very well-bred Arbitrate (by Deputy Minster out of Serena’s Song). The dam, Atsa Pretty Muffin, is a stakes placed daughter of Maria’s Mon, and is a half sister to Skipping Around, a grade II winner who is also dam of Santa Maria Handicap (gr. I) victress Sugar Shake (by Awesome Again (TrueNicks,SRO), by Deputy Minister, so from the same sire and dam line as Capuccine).\n\nIn Argentina, Smart Strike (TrueNicks,SRO)’s son Seeking Daylight has a good filly in Paris Queen who took the Clasico Eudoro J. Balsa (gr. III) – her second graded win – over daughters of Thunder Gulch (TrueNicks,SRO) and Orpen (who, as we’ve said frequently, appears as sire of stakes horses in South America, Europe and Australia). The dam is by the T. V. Lark grandson Dark Brown, going back to a sister to the dam of Arkansas Derby (gr. I) winner Rampage.\n\nIn Turkey, Rainbow Quest son Bin Ajwaad scored one-two in the ten-furlong Basbakanlik Prime Ministry Cup (gr. I). The winner, Inspector, is out of Pandora, a daughter of Platini (by Surumu) from a good German family, and has Red God (grandsire of Rainbow Quest) 4 x 5 in the pedigree.\n\nA young stallion to keep an eye on in Germany is Lord of England (group I winner by Dashing Blade, a grandson of Shirley Heights, and from the Liranga/Love In family), who with his first crop of two-year-olds was represented by the first two home in the Oppenheim-Rennen. The four lengths winner, Acadius, is out of a mare by Tiger Hill (by Danehill), and the runner-up, Salona, out of a mare by Lomitas (out of La Dorada, whose grandsire and granddam are the sire and dam of Liranga, second dam of Lord of England). Acadius is line bred to Liranga’s sire, Literat, and there should be a lot of interesting games that can be played with Lord of England’s pedigree.\n\nStill with two-year-olds, in Zimbabwe, Kingmambo (TrueNicks,SRO)’s brother Kitalpha (TrueNicks,SRO), who now stands in Kentucky, was represented by Samuel, who won the Thoroughbred Breeders Champagne Stakes. Samuel is inbred to Northern Dancer, and his dam is by Hallgate (by a son of Great Nephew, a horse who is out of a three-parts-sister to Northern Dancer’s sire, Nearctic)."
