        "text": "Nathaniel as a Broodmare Sire\n\nNATHANIEL (IRE) is maternal grandsire of ZELLIE (FR) (Wootton Bassett); Prix Marcel Boussac, Gr.1: TRIBALIST (GB) (Farhh); Prix du Muguet, Gr.2 (twice), Prix Bertand du Breuil, Gr.3, third in Poule d’Essai des Poulains, Gr.1: SILVER KNOTT (GB) (Lope de Vega); Man O War Stakes, Gr.2, Elkhorn Stakes, Gr.2, Autumn Stakes, Gr.3; second in Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Turf, Gr.1: HASKOY (GB) (Golden Horn); Aston Park Stakes, Gr.3; second in St Leger, Gr.1 (but disq and placed 4th): NOVAKAI (GB) (Lope de Vega); Aphrodite Stakes, L; second in Fillies’ Mile, Gr.1: GODS WINDOW (GB); third in Futurity Trophy Stakes, Gr.1: ALL IRON (SPA) (Noozhoh Canarias); Derby du Midi, L.\n\nNathaniel Pedigree Notes 2020\n\nNathaniel hails from one of Europe’s finest female families. His dam Magnificent Style was a producer of eight individual stakes winners, six at Group or Graded stakes level which includes a hat-trick of G1 winners. There are two main elements of his female line that are playing a dominant role in his leading progeny. Magnificent Style is by the Hail to Reason line stallion Silver Hawk and Nathaniel’s third dam is by the Ribot line stallion Tom Rolfe. There are a considerable portion of his leading progeny that carry additional strains of Hail to Reason (4 of his 10 GSW) and/or Ribot line (8 of his 10 GSW) stallions. Although there are very few mares left in the population from the Ribot sire-line, Nathaniel has sired LW Palombe from a mare by Boreal (Ribot-line). Names to look out for further back in pedigrees include Alleged, Tom Rolfe, Hoist The Flag, His Majesty, Graustark, Chieftain (half-brother to Tom Rolfe) etc. A son of Galileo has sired G1W Quadrilateral from a mare by Mizzen Mast (dam-sire by Graustark) so he may be another option to try with Nathaniel.\n\nMachiavellian (dam is by Halo; 2nd dam is by Hoist the Flag) looks a key stallion for Nathaniel and mirrors the most influential elements of his female line. Nathaniel has sired a Listed winner from a mare by Machiavellian (only runner). Machiavellian also features as the 2nd dam-sire of a pair of Group Stakes winning fillies by Nathaniel. Nathaniel has sired Deutsches Derby runner-up Enjoy Vijay (G1P) from a mare by Machiavellian’s son Medicean. Mares by Street Cry might be worth experimenting with Nathaniel. Nathaniel has sired a stakes winner from a mare by Shamardal (who is out of a mare by Machiavellian). Shamardal’s son Lope De Vega (inbred to Machiavellian) in theory could be a good option. There are two successful examples of inbreeding to Roberto within Nathaniel’s leading progeny. G3W Highgarden and the stakes winner Ronald R, both have second dams by sons of Roberto from only six runners with inbreeding in these positions. Nathaniel has sired the useful Glencadam Glory from a mare by Orpen (dam by Halo stallion Devil’s Bag and a three parts sister to the dam of Machiavellian). Nathaniel has also sired the smart G2P Melodic Motion with a 2nd dam by Devil’s Bag).\n\nNathaniel has sired G1W God Given from a mare by Kingmambo’s son Dubai Destination (dam by Alleged), while he has also sired G3W Chasedown (2nd dam is by Law Society who is a son of Alleged) from a mare by Whipper (by Miesque’s Son – full brother to Kingmambo). Mares by Lemon Drop Kid might be worth trying. Nathaniel has sired the Group Stakes placed Falcon Wings from a mare by Elusive Quality from a small number of runners. Mares by Elusive Quality’s son Raven’s Pass may also be worth trying, as might mares by Distorted Humor (contains Tom Rolfe and Hail to Reason). There are now at least four sons of Galileo that have sired Group Stakes winners from mares by Dubawi. Nathaniel who has sired G2W Amorella and the useful stakes horse Nate the Great from mares by Dubawi from only five runners. Suitable mares by Dubawi could be a significant combination for Nathaniel going forward.\n\nUnsurprisingly the Danehill branch of Danzig has been one of the most tried lines with Nathaniel. Nathaniel has sired a trio of stakes winners from mares by Danehill (G3W Precious Ramotswe – 2nd dam by Machiavellian, LW Steel Prince – 2nd dam by Caerleon, LW Mutamakina – 2nd dam by Sadler’s Wells) at a strike rate of 18%. Nathaniel has also sired G1 winner Channel (1st dam by Dansili; also inbred to Sadler’s Wells), G2W Dashing Willoughby (1st dam by Dylan Thomas; also inbred to Sadler’s Wells), G3W Tamniah (Rock of Gibraltar; 2nd dam by Machiavellian). The only successful example so far from a mare by a Green Desert line stallion is G3W Highgarden (also inbred to Roberto) who was from a mare by Green Desert.\n\nHernando (dam-sire by Tom Rolfe) looks a very promising broodmare sire for Nathaniel. He has sired G2W Pilaster and Italian Derby runner up (G2P) Back on Board from mares by Hernando from only two runners bred on the cross. Caerleon (carries Hail to Reason) also looks a significant influence for Nathaniel beyond the first generation. Nathaniel has already sired two stakes winners plus G2P Back on Board with Caerleon as the 2nd dam-sire.\n\nShirley Heights features as an important component in some of the leading progeny of Nathaniel. Nathaniel has sired G1W Enable and G2W Pilaster with 2nd dams by Shirley Heights and G1W Channel and G3W Chasedown with 3rd dams by Shirley Heights.\n\nNathaniel has a good strike rate with Blushing Groom line mares which includes LW Natavia (Arazi) and LW Face the Facts (Nashwan).\n\nInbreeding to Sadler’s Wells is becoming more apparent in the leading progeny of Nathaniel and if done with consideration, can deliver significant results. Champion and ten time G1 winner Enable is 3 X 2 (1st dam is by Sadler’s Wells), G1 Prix de Diane winner Channel is 3 X 4 (2nd dam is by Barathea), G1P Enjoy Vivay (2nd dam is by Barathea), G2W Dashing Willoughby is 3 X 5 (2nd dam by Diktat whose dam is by Sadler’s Wells), G3W Chasedown is 3 X 4 (1st dam by Whipper whose dam is by Sadler’s Wells), LW Mutamakina is 3 X 3 (2nd dam by Sadler’s Wells), etc.\n\nGalileo has enjoyed phenomenal success with mares by Pivotal (12 stakes winners from 29 runners) and Nathaniel has made a steady start with the same sire having produced a couple of stakes horses including the promising two-year-old Sound of Cannons. Nathaniel has also sired the stakes winner Ronald R (Wolfhound) and the talented G2P Melodic Motion (Spinning World) from Nureyev line mares."
