        "text": "While there is a long time until the final International Federation of Horseracing Authorities' (IFHA) Longines World’s Best Racehorse Rankings of the year, the first edition of 2017 was a win for the Mr. Prospector sire line with two racehorses sired by his grandson and great-grandson tied for the top spot.\n\nReleased on Thursday, it was no surprise to see Arrogate (Unbridled’s Song) and Winx (Street Cry) both earning ratings of 127, four points ahead of third placed Hartnell (Authorized). In all, six of the 28 ranked horses trace back to Mr. Prospector through their sires while seven of the ranked horses’ broodmare sires also come from that particular sire line. Hussonet (Mr. Prospector) proved to be the most popular close link through broodmare sires with two of the ranked racehorses out of Hussonet mares.\n\nWinx (IFHA/©bradleyphotos.com.au)\n\nUnbridled’s Song was the only Mr. Prospector descendant to both sire a ranked horse and the dam of another ranked horse with his daughter’s Sixties Song (Sixties Icon) tied for fifth on a 119 rating while his sire Unbridled was also the great-grandsire of another ranked horse in Midnight Storm, who is sired by Pioneerof the Nile (Empire Maker).\n\nMr. Prospector’s Forty Niner also earned the distinction of showing up both in the sire line and broodmare sire line of ranked horses with his grandson Trippi siring Trip to Heaven and son Distorted Humor siring Arrogate’s dam. Distorted Humor is also the grandsire of Hoppertunity (Any Given Saturday), giving that branch of the Mr. Prospector line three representatives in this month’s rankings.\n\nDistorted Humor\n\nOverall, ranked horses traced back to Mr. Prospector through eight different sons with Fappiano leading the way with three followed by Hussonet's two dams of ranked horses. Arrogate was the only ranked horse to trace back to Mr. Prospector through both his sire and broodmare sire.\n\nSixties Song is one of five ranked horses bred on the Northern Dancer/Mr. Prospector cross with those two sires mostly showing up in the fourth generations. Not surprisingly, Northern Dancer’s line is the most popular sire line in the rankings with 16 of the 28 ranked horses hailing from one of six of his sons.\n\nBy Galileo’s (Sadler’s Wells) son Sixties Icon, Sixties Song is one of three ranked horses by sons or grandsons of Sadler’s Wells (Northern Dancer). One other ranked horse is a grandson of Sadler’s Wells’ full brother Fairy King and another is a great grandson of Fairy King.\n\nNorthern Dancer also features prominently in the broodmare sire lines of ranked horses with 11 tracing back to him that way. While the Sadler’s Wells branch of that line accounts for two broodmare sires, it is through Danzig that it is strongest, with four horses produced by daughters of that line. Danzig is also responsible for eight of the horses by sires who trace back to Northern Dancer with Danzig’s influential son Danehill providing the link in five of the horses.\n\nBut Mr. Prospector and Northern Dancer can’t take credit for all the ranked horses. Hail to Reason has three ranked horses sired by great-grandsons in Hey Doc (Duporth), Makahiki (Deep Impact) and Neorealism (Neo Universe), with two coming from the Sunday Silence (Halo) branch of the line in Japan.\n\nSir Ivor is another one of those stallions who appears in the sire line of both a sire and a broodmare sire of ranked horses with his great-grandson siring Legal Eagle (Greys Inn) and another grandson siring the dam of Werther (Zabeel). Speak John (Prince John) doesn’t have any representation through the sires of ranked horses but two stallions from his line sired the dams of ranked horses, including Winx. In Reality also shares that distinction with great-grandson Bertrando (Sky Walker) siring the dam of Midnight Storm and grandson Cee’s Tizzy (Relaunch) siring the dam of Trip to Heaven.\n\nOverall, the ranked horses come from 12 different sire lines through their sire or broodmare sire. Surprisingly, only six of the ranked horses trace back to the same sire line through both their sire and broodmare sire. Not surprisingly, most of those horses find Northern Dancer on both sides.\n\nInterestingly with the lack of a large amount of diversity in the bloodlines, the ranked horses come from nine different countries. While you see a certain parts of a line showing up more in one region over another, it shows how specialized sire lines get when horses get to the upper echelons of the sport.\n\nWORLD'S BEST RACEHORSE RANKINGS\n\nRanked Horse (Sire)\n\nSire Line\n\nBranch of Sireline (Son)\n\nArrogate (Unbridled’s Song)\n\nMr. Prospector\n\nFappiano (Unbridled)\n\nWinx (Street Cry)\n\nMr. Prospector\n\nMachiavellian\n\nHartnell (Authorized)\n\nNorthern Dancer\n\nSadler’s Wells (Montjeu)\n\nSatono Crown (Marju)\n\nNorthern Dancer\n\nTry My Best\n\nAmazing Kids (Falkirk)\n\nNorthern Dancer\n\nStorm Bird (Storm Cat)\n\nBlack Heart Bart (Blackfriars)\n\nNorthern Dancer\n\nDanzig (Danehill)\n\nChautauqua (Encosta De Lago)\n\nNorthern Dancer\n\nFairy King\n\nErtijaal (Oasis Dream)\n\nNorthern Dancer\n\nDanzig (Green Desert)\n\nHelene Paragon (Polan)\n\nBlushing Groom\n\nRainbow Quest\n\nLegal Eagle (Greys Inn)\n\nSir Ivor\n\nSir Tristram\n\nLe Romain (Hard Spun)\n\nNorthern Dancer\n\nDanzig\n\nPeniaphobia (Dandy Man)\n\nNorthern Dancer\n\nDanzig (Danehill)\n\nSixties Song (Sixties Icon)\n\nNorthern Dancer\n\nSadler’s Wells (Galileo)\n\nTrip To Heaven (Trippi)\n\nMr. Prospector\n\nForty Niner (End Sweep)\n\nWerther (Tavistock)\n\nNorthern Dancer\n\nSadler’s Wells (Montjeu)\n\nWhisky Baron(Manhattan Rain)\n\nNorthern Dancer\n\nFairy King\n\nBlazing Speed (Dylan Thomas)\n\nNorthern Dancer\n\nDanzig (Danehill)\n\nChampionship (Exceed and Excel)\n\nNorthern Dancer\n\nDanzig (Danehill)\n\nExtreme Choice (Not A Single Doubt)\n\nNorthern Dancer\n\nDanzig (Danehill)\n\nHey Doc (Duporth)\n\nHail to Reason\n\nRoberto\n\nHoppertunity (Any Given Saturday)\n\nMr. Prospector\n\nForty Niner (Distorted Humor)\n\nJoyful Trinity (Zanzibari)\n\nMr. Prospector\n\nSmart Strike\n\nLucky Bubbles (Sebring)\n\nHail to Reason\n\nHalo (Southern Halo)\n\nMakahiki (Deep Impact)\n\nHail to Reason\n\nHalo (Sunday Silence)\n\nMalaguerra (Magnus)\n\nNorthern Dancer\n\nDanzig (Danehill)\n\nMidnight Storm (Pioneerof the Nile)\n\nMr. Prospector\n\nFappiano (Unbridled)\n\nNeorealism (Neo Universe)\n\nHail to Reason\n\nHalo (Sunday Silence)\n\nTerravista (Captain Rio)\n\nNorthern Dancer\n\nNureyev\n\nThe Impact of El Prado\n\nWhen El Prado (Sadler’s Wells) was imported to the United States after being purchased from Coolmore by Frank Stronach in the early 1990s, very few breeders were willing to give El Prado a shot. \"No one wanted a son of Sadler’s Wells in America,” Dermot Carty, who bought the horse for Stronach, told Blood-Horse when the stallion died. “Everyone saw him as just a grass horse, but now he’s a broodmare sire, a sire of sires, and he’s made history. It was a gamble … to buy a son of Sadler’s Wells was a major move, but it paid off.\" But over 20 years later, El Prado has made a major impact on the breed in North America. El Prado started his breeding career at Airdrie Stud in Kentucky for Stronach, who didn’t have a stallion operation at the time. Within a few years, Stronach’s opened up Adena Springs stallion facility and El Prado became one of the cornerstones of the operation.

His successful racing career turned out to be a foreshadowing of his stud career when he joined the stallion ranks in 1999, retiring to Ashford Stud in Versailles, Ky for $25,000. By a top sire in Storm Cat and from a strong female family that includes champion Johannesburg (Hennessy) (out of Tale of the Cat’s half-sister) and Pulpit (A.P. Indy), Tale of the Cat has constantly ranked in the top 30 on the General Sires list since graduating from the crop-specific lists (where he was ranked in the top five on the first, second and third crop sires lists). While never a leading General Sire, Tale of the Cat is more often than not seen in the top 15 with his best ranking on that list being a seventh. The stallion has also done well enough with his 2-year-olds to lead the Two-Year-Old Sires list in 2003 and to rank second o\n\nNorth America's Champion Second-Crop Sire: Munnings\n\nMunnings When Coolmore’s Demi O’Byrne paid $1.7-million for Munnings as an early 2-year-old, expectation were high for the chestnut son of Speightstown. After winning three graded stakes races and finishing on the board in six others, Munnings retired to Coolmore’s Ashford Stud for $12,500 (approx. €11,523/£8,792) in 2011. That crop produced 109 live foals with 53 of those making it to the track as 2-year-olds. Twenty-seven of those first 2-year-olds went to the winner’s circle with three stakes winners and one graded stakes winner in 2014, allowing Munnings to finish fourth by earnings behind Quality Road (Elusive Quality) on the Leading First-Crop Sires list. Munnings also finished second behind fellow Ashford Stud Lookin at Lucky (Smart Strike) by winners and stakes winners (Super Saver (Maria’s Mon) tied with Lookin at Lucky at the top of the stakes winners list). But with 108 runners representing the stallion in 2015, the odds swung in his favor. Munnings had 32"
