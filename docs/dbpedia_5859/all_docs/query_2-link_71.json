        "text": "Written April 2008\n\nWhile Shamardal does carry a line to Mr. Prospector, his sire Giant’s Causeway has a very high strike rate with his sireline and should appreciate another presence of this influence in mares. Australasian broodmare sires such as RHYTHM, HUSSONET, MISWAKI, UMATILLA, GONE WEST, KINGMAMBO, WOODMAN, STRAIGHT STRIKE, ZOFFANY, GEIGER COUNTER, MR. HENRYSEE, BELLOTTO, EL MOXIE, JADE ROBBERY, distorted humor, END SWEEP, INFLATE, THUNDER GULCH, XAAR and SECRET SAVINGS carry Mr. Prospector. Secret Savings’ sire Seeking the Gold has produced a Group One placegetter by Giant’s Causeway.\n\nThe Northern Dancer / Bull Page cross in Giant’s Causeway’s grandsire, Storm Bird is also present in NIJINSKY II’s pedigree. Nijinsky II also works well with Blushing Groom, grandsire of Giant’s Causeway’s dam. Sources of Nijinsky II in Australia include ROYAL ACADEMY, WESTERN SYMPHONY, HURRICANE SKY, CAERLEON, REDOUTE’S CHOICE, QUEST FOR FAME, YEATS and WHISKEY ROAD mares.\n\nQUEST FOR FAME’s sire RAINBOW QUEST has also produced Group One winner Footstepsinthesand by Giant’s Causeway. He carries a Blushing Groom / Herbager cross which is also present in Giant’s Causeway.QUEST FOR FAME mares also carry Raise a Native and have the added appeal of carrying Nijinsky II.\n\nRoyal Academy not only carries Nijinsky II, he is also a half brother to Storm Cat’s dam.\n\nNijinsky’s three-quarter brother The Minstrel is also known to work well with Storm Bird. Daughters of MASTERCLASS, PETERHOF, PALACE MUSIC and his son NATURALISM are therefore appealing. Aischa, a stakeswinner by Giant’s Causeway, is by Zafonic who has The Minstrel as his damsire. Zafonic is also sire of XAAR.\n\nRIBOT has worked well with Storm Cat. DANEHILL, EAGLE EYED, EL MOXIE, MORCON, KALA DANCER, SEA ROAD, RED ANCHOR, STAR WATCH and BOUCHER are sources of Ribot.\n\nDANEHILL mares have worked very well with Shamardal’s sire, Giant’s Causeway. Group One winner Juste Momente and stakes winners Murjana and Causeway Queen are out of Danehill mares.\n\nThe duplication of Hail to Reason in Giant’s Causeway’s dam calls for other mares from the Danzig sireline. His damsire Admiral’s Voyage is a close relation of Hail to Reason. Mares by SNAADEE, MISTER C., BELONG TO ME, BIANCONI, ANABAA, CHIEF’S CROWN, DESERT SUN and PERUGINO qualify.\n\nGiant’s Causeway’s dam is by Rahy, a half brother to RIVOTIOUS.\n\nStorm Cat’s damsire Secretariat should appreciate the presence of Sir Gaylord in broodmares.SIR TRISTRAM and mares from his sireline by sires such as ZABEEL, OCTAGONAL, WESTMINSTER, MARAUDING, DR. GRACE and SOVEREIGN RED will deliver Sir Gaylord, as will IMPERIAL PRINCE, BLUEBIRD, FLYING SPUR, HURRICANE SKY, XAAR and UMATILLA mares, amongst others."
