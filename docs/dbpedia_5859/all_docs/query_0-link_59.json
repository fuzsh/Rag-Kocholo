There was a chestnut stallion by the name of Way In (GB) by Fairway and he was exported to Italy. He produced a good quality steeplechaser by the name of Galatian (GB) and a Italian mare Feiro De Rio. Feiro De Rio was a G1 Oaks winner and produced Feria, a champion 3yo filly in Italy – she produced the US bred Gyr & Berkut (both by Sea Bird). Berkut produced Alydars Best, a G1 winner at 2 years. Gyr produced a G1 winning French bred son, Bon Sang (Fr).\n\nRenowned Pedigree analyst Harold Hampton considered the Fair Trial thoroughbred pedigree as ideal.\n\nFair Trial – a high class English sprinter-miler who could carry his speed to 10 furlongs. He was a burnished chestnut with a prominent white blaze and three white socks.\n\nFair Trial – ranks as the most influential all-purpose sire line to make their mark. The Fair Trial line produced outstanding sprinters and milers, in addition to many winners of Derbies, Oak, St Legers, Quineas, weight-forage, 2mile handicaps and ever the Melbourne, Caulfield and Doombden Cups.\n\nFair Trial was an imposing individual, combining quality and strength who turned a foot out, a trait often discernible in his descendants. He got a consistent stream of good racehorses, whose salient quality was speed, and passed on his beautiful temperament to nearly all of his stock. – John Hislop\n\nThe Fair Trial earliest influences are ‘built’ to Cosmic Speed distaff @ 9×8, following on thru his son Court Martial 3rd dam sire of Elliodor (FR) – 2x Goofed – son Petition, 2nd dam sire of Danzig.\n\nFair Trial son Fairthorne (IRE) was a tremendous influence to the South African studbook as leading sire six times. The male line continued with F.T grandson Damask the 5th dam sire of Cosmic Speed.\n\n(n.b. the classic-speed traits – what serve world calibre distinction are immersed in lines (ie Lyphard’s Court Martial/Goofed/Chouberski) came coeval. The 1951 French bred Court Martial son Affreux who served successfully in Australia, had produced the middle distance freak racing machine Winfreux. Winfreux was a holder of three Australian time records for the old imperial distance through 8 1/2 furlongs 9 furlongs and 11 furlongs and winner of 21 black-type races.

Busted is 4th dam sire to Zenda, dam of Kingman.\n\nWhilst a familial ‘pattern’ affinity maintains integrity of L3a1a/b, the perennial breeding discussions revolve around the delicate balance between avoiding excessive in-breeding or achieving a more favourable alignment with homogeneity values. This presents a complex scenario in which the markers of genotype must be meticulously assessed, striking a considered balance of breeding in relation to the resulting phenotype, which, nevertheless, remains somewhat undeterminable.\n\nBy our suggestion… the proficiency of breeding remains plausibly upon refining to multiples, the diversity ‘outside’ in much similar supportive strains which arise and converge as potent crosses. This development eventually advanced upon Danzig & Border Bounty where Border Bounty from a Danish line, Mowerina, gave Invincible Spirit.\n\nCoefficient of Relationship (COR) measures the degree of consanguinity, or biological relationship, between two individuals. The term Coefficient of Relationship (COR) was, like the Coefficient of Inbreeding, defined by Sewall Wright in 1922. https://www.truenicks.com/pedigreestatistics.htm\n\nInbreeding Coefficient (IC) measures the Inbreeding to 10 generations using Sewall Wright’s F calculation expressed as a percentage value. A low inbreeding coefficient means a low level of inbreeding. The vast majority of Thoroughbreds will have an inbreeding coefficient of less than 10% and inbreeding coefficients over 15% are very rare. https://www.truenicks.com/pedigreestatistics.htm\n\nSparkling Plenty dam **family 16-c, as is 4th dam sire Faraway Son + Herbager thru Rainbow Quest (Frankel’s 2nd dam sire).

Like many New Zealand studmasters, Brian Anderton did not have the budget to import high class racetrack performers. Instead, he had to take the punt that a top pedigree would compensate for a lack of proven racetrack ability. In the case of Mellay and Noble Bijou, he hit the bullseye. Mellay, a son of Never Say Die, was from the Epsom Oaks and One Thousand Guineas winner Meld. Mellay came to New Zealand in 1965 and the following year his half-brother Charlottown helped the cause by winning the Epsom Derby and being named England’s Horse of the Year. Mellay, who died when 13, was twice champion sire and was the leading broodmare sire five times. Mellay left a host of good stayers, including dual NZ Cup winner Princess Mellay, Swell Time (Caulfield Cup), Rose Mellay (Auckland Cup) and Trelay, while both Mayo Mellay and Bahrain were runner-up in the NZ Derby. (Source and credit: LoveRacingNZ) Further notice: Mellay is 3x Blandford thru Blenheim and Bahram & 5×5 Scarpa Flow (dam of Fairway & Pharos)\n\nPrincess Sapphire 3rd Dam by Noble Bijou. Noble Bijou served his first book in 1975, was a Vaguely Noble half-brother to the outstanding race mare, Allez France, who won eight Group I races, including the Arc de Triomphe. Noble Bijou had an even better record, heading the NZ sires’ premiership four times, winning the Dewar Trophy (combined NZ and Australian earnings) once, and, like Mellay, was five times champion broodmare sire. Noble Bijou is also the only stallion in modern times to have been New Zealand’s leading sire and leading broodmare sire in the same season. Noble Bijou owed much of his success to being regularly mated with Mellay mares, a cross that produced six Group I winners – Prince Majestic, Alibhai (four Grp I wins), Powley, Our Sophia, Allez Bijou and Be Noble (dual Grp I winner in South Africa). Noble Bijou also left the talented brothers The Phantom (1994 NZ Horse of the Year) and The Phantom Chance (Cox Plate and NZ Derby) and Caulfield Cup winner Lomondy.\n\nFull Replay 👇👇\n\nJane Bielski (researcher) @ The Thoroughbred Link\n\nadditional: 🐴Warmonger has similar distaff to filly, Princess Calla (SAF) (post) BUT alone by studbook pedigree where it is subject to Haplotype.

She had verve and spirit and boasted a fantastic pedigree which was steeped in talent derived from Senor Frederico Tesio’s breeding skills. She would sprint and stay and possessed an uncanny acceleration. She won 24 times from 43 starts.\n\nThe New Zealand purchase of Olgiata by Wanganui breeders Mr and Mrs Jack Alexander whom specifically sought Tesio lines, where their chosen mare, was so named after a Tesio property in South Italy. On pedigree Olgiata was a gem. Her background was indicative of Tesio’s propensity to buy and sell stock in his overwhelming desire to upgrade the breed.\n\nOlgiata was by Acropolis fron Tesaura, by Niccolo dell’ Arca from Tokamura, by Navarro from Tofanella, by Appelle. Her 3rd dam, Tofanella, was an example of Tesio’s trading predisposition. Tofanella was bought as a yearling in England by Tesio. As a racehorse Tofanella won three times in Italy and once in Germany before retiring to stud. She was a shy breeder but her offspring were all class. They were headed by the Italian Derby and St Leger winner, Tenerani who later won the Queen Elizabeth Stakes and Goodwood Cup in Britain just after WWII. He was at stud in England and Italy and gained racing immortality by siring for Tesio the unbeaten Ribot considered in some quarters to be the greatest racehorse produced in the 2oth century.\n\nAs a racehorse Olgiata was no champion when compared with her illustrious forebears, but those Tesio talents were only resting in her genetical composition. On reaching Wanganui, New Zealand, Olgiata produced a filly foal to Worden II. Named La Balsa, she was speedy and fiery, but experienced a hip-injury and retired to stud without ever racing. Her first foal, by Battle-Waggon, was sold to Australia where she raced as Beach Manner and won races.\n\nMr Alexander next put La Balsa to Copenhagen II, the mating which was to produce La Mer. By Royal Charger, Copenhagen II was a prepotent type with the flair to revive talents seemingly lying dormant in various pedigree.\n\nWhile being broken in, La Mer began to really impress. She had brains and quality. I knew then we had a real racehorse on our hands – Malcolm Smith (trainer) recalls. La Mer distance wins, 1400m -2000m.\n\n\"she (La Mer) can be expected to influence the international thoroughbred scene for many years\".

He was truly exceptional, a marvel. It is to consider well, that he may be the pinnacle of any pedigree, transmitting a distinction from the sole inheritable factor of one ancestral mare.\n\nWith performances as noted, she will be highly praised alongside those Matriarch notables.\n\nAlice Hawthorn – 3 to 7 year old, a splendid racer, ran 71 times and won 50+ times inclusive of 17 King’s Plates. First foal at 11 years old, and had 7 foals without a break. 3 Splendid foundation mares, Lady Hawthorn and Sweet Hawthorn + dam of Thormanby.\n\nCatherina by Whisker out of Alecto – a splendid racer.

Died 1797, about a fortnight after foaling Wowski. Doric Stakes (2-mile heats) carried 9st 7lbs, winning 3 1lbs over her nearest rival.\n\nGuiccioli (Bob Booty) – 2-6 years old a very good racer. Ran as a 6-year-old after foaling and again in foal producing a healthy foal, six times, won twice in the King’s Plates over 4 miles with heats in September in curragh and in Northumberland Handicap in October amongst such good horses as Skylark, a 3-year-old and Napoleon, a 5-year-old. First foal at 6 years old. 13 foals amongst where Birdcatcher and Faugh-a-Ballagh.

Guiccioli 9x to **Siberia > Curlin (USA)\n\n🐴🐴🐴 Alice Hawthorn, Catherina, Maria, Guiccioli. Not merely sources to great dams of great sires where these genetics are power house. The ‘discovered’ mare produced a phenotype that evidently goes overlooked and it was only through Harkaway himself as passed to his son King Tom & his descendants, that distinguishes an ultimate contribution.\n\nBut firstly, another well-known mare Pocahontas – esteemed breeder of Stockwell & Rataplan & King Tom. Pocahontas never won a race of 9 starts.\n\nPocahontas: 2-5 year old ran 9 times without winning. First foal at 6 years,13 foals amongst which were Stockwell, Rataplan, King Tom, The Knight of Kars, Ayacanora, Knight of St Patrick, Auricula (dam of Nuncham & Blanford, Araucaria (dam of Wellingtonia, Camelia, Chamont and Rayon d’Or. Lived to 33 years of age. (n.b. 1909 referenced **)\n\nComprehending Harkaway – his nucleus: The Godolphin Arabian, the sire of Old England, from Amorett, also known as Little Hartley mare, a Royal mare. One of Old England’s grand-daughters is Mother Brown.\n\n*Mother Brown by Trunnion-Old England. At 4-12 years old, ran 39 races and won 20. As 8 year old, and in foal, she won a race over 4 miles. As a 9 year old, after foaling, ran again four times and won four times (amongst which was a King’s Plate). As a 10 year old ran 6 times, winning twice. As a 12 year old, ran once, not placed. Had 6 foals. At 21, Toby a good racer in Ireland, At 25, Jerry Sneak, a splendid racer in Ireland and won as a 13 year old and was sire of many good racehorses. At 26, Mare by Bagot, the grandmother of Nabocklish, family 4. About 30years old, had last foal. Mother Brown, dam of Bacchus, winner of 31 races between 1791 and 1796 including 3 King’s Plates\n\nNabocklish – 1815, 1816 x 2, 1817 King’s Plate The Curragh. The Nabocklish mare and only recorded daughter Fanny Dawson is the dam of Harkaway.\n\nBloodstock writer, George Tattersall (1817-1849) impresses Harkaway was exploited and whether from aristocrat jealously towards the roguish character in owner, Mr Ferguson, it does appear Harkaway attracted an unnecessary misfortune. Harkaway received heavy weights to his racing performances and Stewards would adjudicate faulty starts. Under such harsh conditions to his running, Harkaway earned much respect and praise afar after his triumphant races.\n\nThe name of Harkaway is sacrificed to the disgusting practices of an unprincipled third ‘party’.\n\nAt stud in his first year, Harkaway only served 3 mares. He served the following season in Newmarket to later return to Ireland, and he produced a good number of quality winners. King Tom was considered much like Harkaway. Harkaway daughters were considered very good and turf writers greatly admired them. Even so, rapidly his stud career did decline as breeding services preferred The Baron, to sire Stockwell and Rataplan.\n\nIn this light – one may appreciate how TB History took the evolutionary path.\n\nFiner breeding models are generally to St Simon the Byerley Turk male line. To his pedigree, it maybe comprehended to Harkaway, a Godolphin Arabian/Barb specimen, was a dynamic cross of its time & further St Simon’s dam, St Angela, tap-root family 11-c where his 5th dam Jerboa reveals 7x Godolphin Arabian & 4x Crofts Partner. However, it is not the only aspect influencing. Among those bred-in strains, *Mother Brown (Trunnion – Old England mare) contributes an exemplary trait.\n\nWith this focus, what maybe catalysed to any breeding model may be determinable by understanding exactly whom Harkaway has given influence to, & also to Harkaway’s son King Tom through his few descendants outside of St Simon.\n\nHarkaway influences\n\nSt Simon\n\nHastings, > Fair Play, > Man o War > War Relic, Speed Boat\n\nDisplay\n\nDiscovery\n\nSpearmint\n\nVaguely Noble – 28 strains St Simon, 5x5x6 Spearmint, Harkaway daughter Chaseaway designated, female family 1-d.
