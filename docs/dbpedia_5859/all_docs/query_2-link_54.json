        "text": "The female line of Act Of War traces to a full sister to stallion Portlaw, who can be found remotely in South African pedigrees, including Averof/Foveros and Ribocco (in Dynasty’s damsire). Closer up in his female line is Si Senorita’s ancestor l’Etoile (full sister to the grandam stallion Foreign Agent – a son of Mexico and sire of highclass sprinters). L’Etoile’s sire Faubourg is from the same female line as she is, making her kinbred to the dam of Portree and 3-part sister Needle Eye (from Faubourg).\n\nRemotely, the female line is also the one of SA stallion Greatorex.\n\nAct Of War’s grandam Vadostar is inbred to Turn To, through the latter’s sons Sir Gaylord and First Landing. Turn To is out of Source Sucree, who is a daughter of Lavendula. Act Of War and his two stakes winning siblings kin-link to this line.\n\nAct Of War is by Dynasty, whose grandam Joy Petite carries a double: from her sire Joy and her 3rd dam Black Brook (half sister to Turn To). Dynasty’s sire Fort Wood has another line of Turn To, through Hail To Reason. Act Of War’s half brother Subastador is by Tara’s Halls, who is inbred to Turn To through Sir Gaylord and Hail to Reason. The same double appears in another half brother, Luna de Victoria, who is by Victory Moon – the latter’s sire Al Mufti has Hail to Reason and Sir Gaylord."
