        "text": "Not so many years ago, the hottest stallion prospects in the world were the sons of leading sire Storm Cat, the blocky dark bay son of Storm Bird (by Northern Dancer) out of Terlingua (Secretariat). Beaten for the 1985 Breeders’ Cup Juvenile in the last jump by Tasso, Storm Cat nonetheless became the dominant sire of his generation, and after sons such as Harlan sired major competitors like Menifee and Harlan’s Holiday, the demand for sons of Storm Cat went into the stratosphere.\n\nToday, there are still more than two dozen sons of Storm Cat at stud, and of those, at least six have sired Grade 1 or Group 1 winners this year. Of course, Giant’s Causeway was “the” son of Storm Cat after a terrific racing career, and he has proven the most successful stallion son of his fabled sire.\n\nThis year, Giant’s Causeway has G1 winners Brody’s Cause (Breeders’ Futurity) and Carpe Diem (Blue Grass Stakes). The other sons of Storm Cat with 2015 G1 winners are Bluegrass Cat, with Chilean-raced Linda Linda (Alberto Solari Magnasco); the deceased Bernstein, with Tepin (Breeders’ Cup Mile, First Lady Stakes, Just a Game Stakes), certain finalist for the Eclipse as top turf filly; Tale of the Cat, with Stopchargingmaria (Breeders’ Cup Distaff), one of the likely finalists for the Eclipse Award as Older Female; Stormy Atlantic, with the evergreen Stormy Lucy (Matriarch Stakes); and Pure Prize, with unbeaten Hi Happy in Argentina.\n\nOf those, Tale of the Cat and Stormy Atlantic come from the same crop, foaled in 1994, and they are two of the most reliable representatives of Storm Cat for their own individual types. Tale of the Cat was arguably the fastest son of his sire, and Tale of the Cat has sired a high percentage of quick and frequently precocious performers. They tend to be medium-sized and strongly made. Few want to race much farther than a mile, but the stallion’s most famous performer is champion turf horse Gio Ponti, who was best at 10 to 12 furlongs.\n\nStormy Atlantic, however, is a taller version of the Storm Cat model, significantly influenced by broodmare sire Seattle Slew, and the stallion has found particular success with turf performers, many of whom show great longevity. His best racers include Canadian champion Up With the Birds (G1 Jamaica Handicap) and multiple G1 winner Get Stormy (Woodford Reserve Turf Classic, Gulfstream Park Turf Handicap, Maker’s Mark Mile).\n\nBut one interesting facet of Stormy Atlantic’s record as a sire is his versatility. In addition to those top performers able to succeed going two turns, the stallion sires others who have high speed and precocity and who show top-level form on dirt. Among these, the best was surely Stormello, winner of the Hollywood Futurity and the Norfolk Stakes. Other good juveniles include She Says It Best (Alcibiades Stakes) and Wired Bryan (Sanford Stakes).\n\nThe sire of 97 stakes winners, Stormy Atlantic comes from one of the most distinguished American female families, that of Rough Shod (Gold Bridge). The distinguished producer is the fourth dam of Stormy Atlantic, coming through the mare’s champion daughter Moccasin (Nantallah). Moccasin produced seven stakes winners from nine foals in her time at stud, and one of those was Flippers, who is the second dam of Stormy Atlantic.\n\nA daughter of Belmont Stakes winner Coastal (Majestic Prince), Flippers was a good racer but lankier than her dam. Possessing less speed than champion juvenile Moccasin, Flippers was bred to champion juvenile (and Triple Crown winner) Seattle Slew. That mating produced the mare’s best performer, stakes winner Hail Atlantis, who is the dam of Stormy Atlantic.\n\nThe stallion has certainly held up the best traditions of his heritage, and he will cross the threshold of 100 stakes winners in the near future.\n\nAnother son of Storm Cat from an exceptional female family, Pure Prize is out of champion Heavenly Prize (Seeking the Gold) and won the G2 Kentucky Cup Classic. Sent to stud, the big chestnut became a racing man’s star stallion, getting solid performers at a variety of distances and surfaces. G1 winner Pure Clan was probably the stallion’s best-known performer in the States.\n\nIn South America, Pure Prize has found even greater acceptance and success. This year, he has the unbeaten Hi Happy, top 3-year-old colt in Argentina and pro-tem Horse of the Year after a powerful victory in the G1 Carlos Pellegini at San Isidro on Dec. 12.\n\nThe winner of four G1 races from six starts to date, Hi Happy won the Pellegrini by a length and a half from the 3-year-old Include colt Don Inc, with the nearest of their older competition six lengths farther back.\n\nBred and raced by Haras La Providencia, Hi Happy is a full brother to Hinz, a G1 winner in Chile. They are out of the French Deputy mare Historia, and their third dam is the Forli mare Islands, who is out of stakes winner Grand Luxe, by Sir Ivor out of Alabama Stakes winner Fanfreluche (Northern Dancer).\n\nPure Prize stands solely in Argentina, where he is based at Haras Carampangue, near San Antonio de Areco.\n\nMuch like not seeing the forest for the trees, sometimes we don’t see the horse for the pedigrees.\n\nSeldom has that seemed more significant than with the 1989 Horse of the Year Sunday Silence. The tall, dark, handsome son of leading sire Halo was not on anyone’s list of “must-have” yearlings when he went to the sales at Keeneland in July 1987.\n\nThe future classic winner had been foaled and raised at Arthur Hancock’s Stone Farm in Bourbon County, Ky. He was a son of the farm’s banner stallion Halo — one of the three best stallion sons of leading sire Hail to Reason. A champion juvenile colt, Hail to Reason had risen to the top of the stallion ranks through the 1960s and ‘70s as a result of the toughness and classic quality of his offspring, including Preakness winner Personality.\n\nHail to Reason had a lot of high-class sons on the racetrack, including English Derby winner Roberto. The latter went on to become a stallion of high international significance. He had classic stock and top juveniles, as well as rugged older horses of high caliber.\n\nIn addition to Personality, Hail to Reason’s best sons included Kentucky Derby winner Proud Clarion, Belmont Stakes winner Hail to All, and Travers winner Bold Reason, also third in the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes.\n\nSo Halo had to be pretty special to rank among such company among the sons of Hail to Reason.\n\nIndeed, both as a striking individual and as a force at stud, he was an animal of the first rank. A near-black horse with a stripe down his face, Halo was a high-priced sales yearling, then progressed during his racing career to be a major racehorse, especially as turf performer as an older horse.\n\nThe leading stud farms were not greatly interested in Halo as a stallion prospect, however, and after a cancelled sale to the UK, because Halo was a cribber, E.P. Taylor had the good fortune to secure Halo and send him to stud in Maryland at his expanding annex of Windfields Farm located there in the 1970s.\n\nFrom the first, Halo was an unqualified success at stud. Like big raindrops ringing against a tin roof, the good Halos started pouring down. The first crop included champion Glorious Song, and a few years later, her full brother Devil’s Bag became an unbeaten champion 2-year-old colt and made a lot of people believe he was the best racehorse in a long time… at least for a short time.\n\nIn between, Halo sired Kentucky Derby winner Sunny’s Halo, and the acclaim for Halo climbed higher and higher.\n\nTom Tatham’s Oak Cliff Thoroughbreds made an offer to purchase Halo from Windfields, succeeded in that high-dollar endeavor, and moved the dark horse from Maryland to Stone Farm in Kentucky.\n\nThere, Halo sired Sunday Silence for Oak Cliff. The colt went through the July sale unprotected and was bought in by Hancock, who later commented that he thought he had just thrown away $17,000 when Tatham said he didn’t want the colt back.\n\nThree years later, Hancock ended up having to sell Sunday Silence because the tax law “reforms” had worked their magic on the horse business and several other business sectors, and nobody wanted to buy into horses, especially ones that had to be held a long time like stallions and mares.\n\nSent to stand in Japan at Shadai by the visionary Zenya Yoshida, Sunday Silence became a legend in his new home, setting records for quality and quantity of success.\n\nBut at the time he was set to go to stud, not many breeders in this country could see the horse for the pedigree, which in Sunday Silence’s case was considered to be weak on the bottom half.\n\nThe problem with that line of thought was that the horse had clearly gotten all the good traits that were available, as he had shown on the racetrack, and he then went on to transmit them with exceptional regularity to his offspring.\n\nThe effect of their quality and consistency is still felt in Japan.\n\nThis year’s Japan Cup winner is Shonan Pandora, winner of Japan’s Group 1 Shuka Sho last year. To date, she has earned $4.8 million. The second dam of the Japan Cup winner is a full sister to Japanese champion 2-year-old and champion sprinter Soccer Boy. That full sister also produced international G1 winner Stay Gold, by Sunday Silence.\n\nShonan Pandora is one of 71 stakes winners by Sunday Silence’s son Deep Impact. That stallion is the best of Sunday Silence’s many sons who went to stud, but even if Deep Impact were subtracted from Sunday Silence’s record, there would be a herd of good and important sires by the Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner.\n\nDeep Impact also sired Satono Lupin, winner of the G3 Keihan Hai on the same day as the Japan Cup, and Sunday Silence’s son Suzuka Mambo sired Sambista, winner of the Champions Cup (Japan Cup Dirt).\n\nIn America, the best son of Sunday Silence available to breeders is top-rated miler Hat Trick, and he had G3 winner Dressed in Hermes, winner of the Cecil B. DeMille Stakes at Del Mar on Nov 29. The 2-year-old gelding is from the first crop after European high-weight Dabirsim drew attention to Hat Trick with G1 successes as part of that stallion’s first-crop racers.\n\nWhile doing some work in a stall at Lane’s End Farm, the new groom thought he heard a deep rumble coming from a nearby stall. After the third occurrence, he stuck his head out, looked up and down the broad aisle.\n\nA fellow stallion groom was sweeping an errant piece of straw back into a stall, and the new guy asked, “Did you hear anything?”\n\n“Like what?”\n\n“Like that,” as another rumble came down their way.\n\n“Oh, he’s just reading the race results from the weekend,” said the experienced groom.\n\n“Who’s reading, and what’s so funny?”\n\n“The big horse is having a good time with his reading material this morning…”\n\n“What you mean reading. Horses don’t read.”\n\nThe experienced groom sighed, “That’s A.P. Indy down there, and if he takes a notion to fly, you better start wearing a muck bucket on your head.”\n\nWhat’s more, A.P. Indy had plenty to chuckle about after this weekend’s racing.\n\nOn Nov. 28 at Aqueduct, A.P. Indy’s grandson Tapit solidified his lead as the top sire in the country with the victories of Tonalist (Belmont Stakes, Jockey Club Gold Cup) in the Grade 1 Cigar Mile and of the unbeaten Mohaymen (Nashua Stakes) in the G2 Remsen. Then in Florida, Tapit’s juvenile son Rafting won the Smooth Air Stakes at Gulfstream West (nee Calder).\n\nA.P. Indy grandson Sky Mesa sired a first-time stakes winner, the 2-year-old Family Meeting, in the G3 Jimmy Durante Stakes at Del Mar.\n\nSons Malibu Moon, Bernardini, and Mineshaft also had graded stakes winners. At Churchill Downs on the 28th, Malibu Moon’s daughter Carina Mia was a four and a quarter length winner of the G2 Golden Rod. The same afternoon at Aqueduct, Bernardini’s daughter Lewis Bay came home a winner in the G2 Demoiselle Stakes. Those victories were the initial stakes and graded stakes successes for those promising young athletes.\n\nNot so with Mineshaft’s contribution to the roll of success for the A.P. Indy crowd. Established performer Effinex won the G1 Clark Handicap at Churchill Downs on the Friday after Thanksgiving, and he defeated last year’s winner of the Clark, Hoppertunity, by three-quarters of a length.\n\nAnd finally (small drum roll here, please), A.P. Indy himself sired the winner of the G2 Hawthorne Gold Cup on Nov. 28.\n\nThat 4-year-old colt is named Commissioner, and he is perhaps best remembered for a heroic front-running effort in the 2014 Belmont Stakes, going down in the shadow of the wire to Tonalist. A notably good prospect as he progressed toward the classics last season, Commissioner went out a good winner and will enter stud next season at WinStar Farm for $7,500 live foal.\n\nCommissioner is one of two colts from A.P. Indy’s last crop who will enter stud in 2016. The more heralded of the pair is Honor Code, a striking near-black animal who won the Metropolitan Handicap and Whitney Stakes this season. A colt who has drawn plenty of attention since the start of his racing career, Honor Code will enter stud alongside his greatly honored and pensioned sire at Lane’s End. That farm also stands Horse of the Year Mineshaft.\n\nSpendthrift has Malibu Moon; Darley has Bernardini; Three Chimneys has Sky Mesa; and Gainesway has Tapit. So these and other important sons and grandsons are well-dispersed among the leading stallion farms in the Bluegrass.\n\nCommissioner makes three sons of A.P. Indy for WinStar, which also stands leading freshman sire Congrats and G1 Florida Derby winner Take Charge Indy. The latter will have his first yearlings in 2016 and has bred 296 mares in his first two seasons at stud.\n\nThe popularity of Congrats and Take Charge Indy with breeders should have a positive effect on Commissioner, who comes from a female family known for quickness and good looks.\n\nThe colt’s first three dams are all stakes winners, and Commissioner’s dam, the Touch Gold mare Flaming Heart, has produced two stakes winners. Commissioner earned nearly $1 million, and his stakes-winning half-brother Laugh Track (by Distorted Humor), earned $598,014 and finished second in the Breeders’ Cup Sprint.\n\nThis family contributes its share of quality and strong physical appeal, and Commissioner shows their influence, plus the trademark A.P. Indy look: great length of rein, deep shoulder, width and length through the body, plus a good hip. The A.P. Indys tend to look like classic horses, with plenty of leg, and the best of them have plenty of speed to go with their stamina.\n\nA.P. Indy and his sire, Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew, pulled the Bold Ruler – Nasrullah line back to the peak of importance as a source of classic prospects, and the classic influence of these horses is a tale with stories just waiting to unfold.\n\nAs the racing season winds toward winter, serious classic watchers are ever aware of the late-maturing colts who may progress to become the stars of their second season.\n\nOne of the sires who is a consistent source of later-maturing juveniles is A.P. Indy’s son Bernardini. A horse who did not come to his form until 3, Bernardini usually gets stock that will be goodish at 2, then improve out of sight through the early months of their 3-year-old season.\n\nOn the Nov. 22 race card at Aqueduct, Bernardini had a couple of nice prospects, both winning their maidens while racing a mile on dirt. In the fourth race, Seymourdini became a winner in his third start after a pair of sharp seconds going six furlongs. The bay ridgling went the mile in 1:38.40 and cruised home by nine lengths as the 2-5 favorite. Out of the graded stakes winner Graeme Six (by Graeme Hall), Seymourdini is a half-brother to Grade 3 Monmouth Oaks winner Delightful Joy (Tapit) and to stakes winner Cali Star (Street Cry). Bred in Kentucky by Besilu Stables, Seymourdini sold for $900,000 to Iris Smith Stable at the Ocala Breeders Sales Company’s April auction this spring.\n\nIn the sixth race at Aqueduct, Shagaf won his début by five lengths in 1:37.61. Bred in Kentucky by owner Shadwell Farm, Shagaf is out of the stakes-winning mare Muhaawara, by Unbridled’s Song. Muhaawara is a half-sister to Breeders’ Cup Marathon winner Eldaafer (by A.P. Indy), and their dam is G1 winner Habibti. The latter is not the superb Irish-bred mare by the great Sir Gaylord stallion Habitat but is one of the best performers by Preakness and Belmont Stakes winner Tabasco Cat (Storm Cat).\n\nIn addition to Shagaf being another bright maiden winner for the stable, Shadwell has one of the most intriguing stakes juveniles of the late fall season in Mohaymen (Tapit). Winner of both his starts to date, Mohaymen defeated Seymourdini in their debuts and then progressed to win the G2 Nashua Stakes in a mighty professional sort of second start.\n\nMohaymen is expected to race next in the G2 Remsen Stakes at Aqueduct over nine furlongs, and that race, of all the stakes on the East Coast at this time of year, is the launching pad for classic dreams.\n\nIn addition to classic winners like Northern Dancer, Damascus, and Pleasant Colony being past winners of the Remsen, the race has been won recently by such progressive racers as Honor Code, who defeated the talented Cairo Prince in a thrilling renewal of the event in 2013.\n\nIn other years, the race has been won by some extraordinary future slugs, but let’s not think about them just yet.\n\nA victory in the Nov. 28 Remsen would be a serious step forward in Mohaymen’s prospects for the classics, emphasizing both his ability to race the distance at this point in his young career, as well as his obvious progressiveness.\n\nThe good-looking gray will need both class and stamina as he moves along the unforgiving path to the Kentucky Derby and other classics in 2016.\n\nBred in Kentucky by Clearsky Farm and bought for $2.2 million as the equal high-priced yearling of the season at the 2014 Keeneland September yearling sale, Mohaymen would appear to be worth every cent if he wins the Remsen and makes himself the wise guys’ choice for the classics of 2016. Furthermore, he would be a really exciting prospect for Shadwell, which has been among the most successful breeders in the world for three decades, although rather quietly so among American fans because the operation infrequently races youngsters in the States.\n\nIf sent to follow the program pursued this year by Godolphin stable star Frosted (also by Tapit), Mohaymen would be an exciting prospect to exceed his stable companion (both trained by Kiaran McLaughlin). Frosted was second in the Remsen last year, improved to win the G1 Wood Memorial, then was fourth in the Kentucky Derby and second in the Belmont.\n\nAnd of such things as these are classic dreams made.\n\n**(Written last week before Mohaymen’s victory in the Remsen)"
