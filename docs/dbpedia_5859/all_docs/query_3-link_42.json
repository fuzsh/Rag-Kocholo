        "text": "Highway Mary, the dam of Hit The Road, is closely kinbred, through the dam of her sire US Ranger and her own dam. Both are by Red Ransom out of daughters of His Majesty, Andover Way and Beautiful Bedouin. The latter has kin-breeding through her sire’s His Majesty’s 4th dam Kampala and her own 4th dam Nine II. Beautiful Bedouin is half sister to sire-of-sires Silver Hawk, by Red Ransom’s sire Roberto. That makes Hit The Road’s grandam Wandering Star very close kin to Silver Hawk.\n\nWandering Star is dam of Gr1 winner War Command (rated 118 and stallion at stud with Coolmore). War Command is by War Front, a son of Danzig whose dam Pas de Nom is close kin to On The Trail in US Ranger, the damsire of Hit The Road. US Ranger is by Danzig, his grandam Andover Way is by His Majesty out of On The Trail. US Ranger’s dam is full sister to Dynaformer, a successful sire.\n\nHit The Road’s sire More Than Ready traces to influential mare La Troienne, who links to the earlier noted kin-breeding in Beautiful Bedouin – La Troienne is close kin to both Kampala (from His Majesty’s bottom line) and Nini II (in Hit The Road’s bottom line). In More Than Ready’s bottom line, Good Landing (has La Troienne as 3rd dam) is close kin to Halo and Hail To Reason (More Than Ready’s sire line). Hail To Reason is sire of Roberto (sire of Red Ransom).\n\nSuitable Lines\n\nSuitable Lines for HIT THE ROAD could include\n\n- descendants of La Troienne (in multiples, preferably), most notably Buckpasser (widespread).\n\n- Jet Master – his damsire Rollins is very close kin to Red Ransom (interplay of Damascus and Roberto & full sister), while his sire Rakeen is close kin to Southern Halo (sire of More Than Ready)\n\n- Captain Al – his sire Al Mufti is close kin to Red Ransom, his damsire Complete Warrior is out of the mare Splendid Spree, who is by Damascus out of a sister to Buckpasser\n\n- Elusive Fort – his damsire Secret Prospector is very close kin to Woodman (damsire of More Than Ready), their dams Playmate and Secret Asset are close kin to Change Water, grandam of Fort Wood (sire of Elusive Fort); Change Water is dam of Fall Aspen, who is close kin to Empress (Elusive Fort’s 5th dam), who in turn is close kin to Flower Bowl (dam of His Majesty & Graustark)\n\n- Red Ransom is damsire of Marchfield, and sire of Sri Pekan, damsire of Buffalo Bill Cody\n\n- Dynaformer is second damsire of Admiral Kitten, who in addition has a double of Roberto, of Buckpasser and of brothers His Majesty and Graustark (among other things), and has the same female line background as Fort Wood\n\n- Silver Hawk is sire of Fahal (whose dam is by a grandson of Graustark) and Albarahin\n\n- War Front is sire of Lancaster Bomber and of Fire Away whose famous grandam Personal Ensign is by Private Account (Damascus x Numbered Account who is full sister to Woodman’s dam Playmate)\n\n(posted 2024)"
