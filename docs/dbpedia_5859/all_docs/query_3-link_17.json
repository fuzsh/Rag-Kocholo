        "text": "It is the landmark race of the thoroughbred business, it can make you rich and famous in two minutes, it can establish breeding fortunes and enhance bloodlines for generations to come. And every now and then, the Kentucky Derby is won by a horse of modest or even obscure pedigree, something of a genetic freak, a carpetbagger in the bluegrass.\n\nAnd this year, the issue of breeding lurks behind every barn at Churchill Downs. The favorite is Holy Bull, the big, gray colt who has won seven of his eight races while leading almost every step of the way. But many experts will warn you, and even bet you, that he may not have the pedigree to win the most important race in America, that he comes up short in both distance and class genes.\n\n\"As good as he is, this horse will fail in the Derby,\" said John Frato, a bloodline specialist, \"and the reason is genetics. To win the Kentucky Derby, you've got to carry 126 pounds for a mile and a quarter. None of these young colts has done it yet. The one most likely to do it Saturday will need the right genes.\n\n\"Holy Bull can run fast. He even coasts on the lead, as he did in the Florida Derby and the Blue Grass. But how far can he run while going that fast? The only distance influence we could find in his pedigree is in the fourth generation, in the classic distance horse Herbager. Otherwise, Holy Bull is a freak, genetically speaking. Amazing-looking and very fast, but a freak. And he'll have to be a freak to win the Derby.\"\n\nBut is pedigree everything? Chick Lang, the longtime racing official and former general manager of the Pimlico Race Course, said bluntly: \"Many horses -- like many people -- outrun their pedigrees. To outrun Holy Bull, you might need some guy on a motorcycle.\"\n\nThe other morning, Dan Rosenberg stood outside the elegant Tudor barns of the Three Chimneys breeding farm in Midway, Ky., where he is the manager and where the star stallions include Seattle Slew, Capote, Time for a Change and the newly arrived Fly So Free. And he said the answer to the whole issue was common sense: \"Breeding isn't an exact science. It's more a combination of art and science.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
