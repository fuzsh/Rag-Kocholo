YANCEY, from the Committee of Thirteen, reported as follows:\n\nThe Committee to whom it was committed to consider upon, and report, what action was necessary to be taken by this Convention, in order to protect and preserve the rights and independence of the people of the State of Alabama, beg leave to report, that they have calmly and thoughtfully considered the great matter committed to them; and they have instructed me to report the accompanying Ordinance and Resolutions.\n\nW. L. YANCEY,\n\nChairman.\n\nAn Ordinance to dissolve the Union between the State of Alabama and other States united under the compact styled \"The Constitution of the United States of America.\"\n\nWHEREAS, the election of Abraham Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin to the offices of President and Vice President of the United States of America, by a sectional party, avowedly hostile to the domestic institutions and to the peace and security of the people of the State of Alabama, preceded by many and dangerous infractions of the Constitution of the United States by many of the States and people of the Northern section, is a political wrong of so insulting and menacing a character as to justify the people of the State of Alabama in the adoption of prompt and decided measures for their future peace and security; therefore,\n\nBe it declared and ordained by the people of the State of Alabama, in Convention assembled, That the State of Alabama now withdraws, and is hereby withdrawn, from the Union known as \"the United States of America,\" and henceforth ceases to be one of said United States, and is, and of right ought to be, a Sovereign and Independent State.\n\nSEC. 2. Be it further declared and ordained by the people of the State of Alabama in Convention assembled, That all the powers over the Territory of said State, and over the people thereof, heretofore delegated to the Government of the United States of America, be and they are hereby withdrawn from said Government, and are hereby resumed and vested in the people of the State of Alabama.\n\nBe it resolved by the people of Alabama in Convention assembled, That the people of the States of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi,\n\nPage 77\n\nLouisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Missouri, be and are hereby invited to meet the people of the State of Alabama, by their Delegates, in Convention, on the 4th day of February, A. D., 1861, at the city of Montgomery, in the State of Alabama, for the purpose of consulting with each other as to the most effectual mode of securing concerted and harmonious action in whatever measures may be deemed most desirable for our common peace and security.\n\nAnd be it further resolved, That the President of this Convention be, and is hereby instructed to transmit forthwith, a copy of the foregoing Preamble, Ordinance, and Resolutions to the Governors of the several States named in said resolutions.\n\nDone by the people of the State of Alabama, in Convention assembled at Montgomery, on this, the eleventh day of January, A. D., 1861.\n\nMINORITY REPORT.\n\nMr. CLEMENS, from the minority of the same Committee, made a report with resolutions as follows:\n\nThe undersigned a minority of the Committee of Thirteen, to whom was referred all matters touching the proper mode of resistance to be adopted by the State of Alabama, in the present emergency, beg leave to present the following\n\nREPORT:\n\nLooking to harmony of action among our own people as desirable above all other things, we have been earnestly desirous of concurring with the majority in the line of policy marked out by them, but, after the most careful consideration, we have been unable to see, in Separate State Secession the most effectual mode of guarding our honor and securing our rights. Without entering into any argument upon the nature and amount of our grievances, or any speculations as to the probability of our obtaining redress and security in the Union, but looking alone to the most effectual mode of resistance, it seems to us that this great object is best to be attained by the concurrent and concerted action of all the States interested, and that it becomes us to make the effort to obtain that concurrence, before deciding finally and conclusively upon our own policy.\n\nWe are further of opinion that, in a matter of this importance, vitally affecting the property, the lives and the liberties of the whole people, sound policy dictates that an ordinance of secession should be submitted for their ratification and approval. To that\n\nPage 78\n\nend, the resolutions which accompany this report have been prepared and are now submitted to the Convention.\n\nThe undersigned purposely refrain from a detailed statement of the reasons which have brought them to the conclusions at which they have arrived. The action proposed by the majority of the Committee is, in its nature, final and conclusive--there is no chance for rehearing or revision; and we feel no disposition to submit an argument, whose only effect will be to create discontent, and throw difficulties in the way of a policy, the adoption of which we are powerless to prevent. In submitting our own plan and using all fair and honorable means to secure its acceptance, our duty is fully discharged; to insist upon objections when they can have no effect but to excite dissatisfaction among the people, is alike foreign to our feelings, and our conceptions of patriotic duty.\n\nThe resolutions hereinbefore referred to, are prayed to be taken as part of this Report, and the whole is herewith respectfully submitted.\n\nJERE. CLEMENS,\n\nDAVID P. LEWIS,\n\nWM. O. WINTSON,\n\nA. KIMBAL,\n\nR. S. WATKINS,\n\nR. JEMISON, JR.\n\nWHEREAS, repeated infractions of the Constitution of the United States by the people and States of the Northern section of the Confederacy have been followed by the election of sectional candidates, by a strictly sectional vote, to the Presidency and Vice Presidency of the United States, upon a platform of principles insulting and menacing to the Southern States; and WHEREAS, it becomes a free people to watch with jealous vigilance, and resist with manly firmness every attempt to subvert the free and equal principles upon which our Government was originally founded, and ought alone to be maintained; therefore,\n\nBe it resolved by the people of Alabama in Convention assembled, That the States of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana. Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Missouri, be and they are hereby requested to meet us in general Convention in the city of Nashville, in the State of Tennessee, on the 22d day of February, 1861, for the purpose of taking into consideration the wrongs of which we have cause to complain; the appropriate remedy therefor, and the time and manner of its application.\n\nBe it further resolved, That the State of Alabama shall be represented in said Convention by nine delegates, one to be selected\n\nPage 79\n\nfrom each Congressional district, and two from the State at large, in such manner as shall hereafter be directed and provided for by this Convention.\n\nBe it further resolved, That our delegates selected shall be instructed to submit to the general Convention the following basis of a settlement of the existing difficulties between the Northern and the Southern States, to wit:\n\n1. A faithful execution of the Fugitive Slave Law, and a repeal of all State laws calculated to impair its efficacy.\n\n2. A more stringent and explicit provision for the surrender of criminals charged with offences against the laws of one State and escaping into another.\n\n3. A guarantee that slavery shall not be abolished in the District of Columbia, or in any other place over which Congress has exclusive jurisdiction.\n\n4. A guarantee that the inter-State slave trade shall not be interferred with.\n\n5. A protection to slavery in the Territories, while they are Territories, and a guarantee that when they ask for admission as States they shall be admitted into the Union with or without slavery as their Constitutions may prescribe.\n\n6. The right of transit through free States with slave property.\n\n7. The foregoing clauses to be irrepealable by amendments to the Constitution.\n\nBe it further resolved, That the basis of settlement prescribed in the foregoing resolution shall not be regarded by our delegates as absolute and unalterable, but as an indication of the opinion of this Convention, to which they are expected to conform as nearly as may be, holding themselves, however, at liberty to accept any better plan of adjustment which may be insisted upon by a majority of the slaveholding States.\n\nBe it further resolved, That if the foregoing proposition for a conference is refused, or rejected, by any or all of the States to which it is addressed, Alabama, in that event, will hold herself at liberty, alone, or in conjunction with such States, as may agree to unite with her, to adopt such plan of resistance, and mature such measures, as in her judgment may seem best calculated to maintain the honor and secure the rights of her citizens; and in the meantime we will resist, by all means at our command, any attempt on the part of the General Government to coerce a seceding State.\n\nBe it further resolved, That the President of this Convention be instructed to transmit copies of the foregoing preamble and resolutions to the Governors of each of the States therein named.\n\nPage 80\n\nAnd also the following resolution from the same:\n\nBe it resolved by the people of Alabama in Convention assembled, That an ordinance of secession from the United States is an act of such great importance, involving consequences so vitally affecting the lives, liberty and property of the citizens of the seceding State, as well as of the States by which it is surrounded, and with which it has heretofore been united, that in our opinion it should never be attempted until after the most thorough investigation, and discussion, and then only after a full and free ratification at the polls by a direct vote of the people, at an election held under the forms and safeguards of the law in which that single issue, untrammelled and undisguised in any manner whatever, should alone be submitted.\n\nMR. CLEMENS moved that the preamble and first series of resolutions be taken up and substituted for the ordinance.\n\nThe ayes and noes was demanded.\n\nThe ayes and nays were then called on the motion of Mr. Clemens, and it was lost. Ayes, 45, nays, 54.\n\nThose who voted in the affirmative are Messrs. Allen, Barclay, Beard, Bulger, Clarke, of Lawrence, Clemens, Coffee, Coman, Crumpler, Davis, of Madison, Earnest, Edwards, Ford, Forrester, Franklin, Gay, Green, Guttery, Hood, Inzer, Jemison, Jones, of Fayette, Jones, of Lauderdale, Johnson, Kimball, Leonard, Lewis, McClellan, Posey, Potter, Russell, Sanford, Sheets, Sheffield, Slaughter, Smith, of Tuscaloosa, Steadham, Steele, Taylor, Timberlake, Watkins, Whitlock, Wilson, Winston, Wood--45.\n\nThose who voted in the negative are Messrs. President, Bailey, Baker, of Barbour, Baker, of Russell, Barnes, Beck, Blue, Bolling, Bragg, Catterling, Clarke, of Marengo, Cochran, Coleman, Crawford, Creech, Crook, Curtis, Daniel, Dargan, Davis, of Covington, Davis, of Pickens, Dowdell, Foster, Gibbons, Gilchrist, Hawkins, Henderson, of Pike, Henderson, of Macon, Herndon, Howard, Humphries, Jewett, Ketchum, Love, McClanahan, McPherson, McKinnie, Morgan, Owens, Phillips, Ralls, Rives, Ryan, Shortridge, Silver, Smith, of Henry, Starke, Stone, Watts, Webb, Whatley, Williamson, Yancey, Yelverton--54.\n\nMR. CLEMENS offered the following amendment:\n\nProvided, however, that this ordinance shall not go into effect until the 4th day of March, 1861, and not then unless the same shall have been ratified and confirmed by a direct vote of the people.\n\nPage 81\n\nThe ayes and noes were taken on the amendment, and were ayes, 45, nays, 54, and the amendment was lost.\n\nThose who voted in the affirmative are, Messrs. Allen, Barclay, Beard, Bulger, Clarke, of Lawrence, Clemens, Coffee, Coman, Crumpler, Davis, of Madison, Earnest, Edwards, Ford, Forrester, Franklin, Gay, Green, Guttery, Hood, Inzer, Jemison, Jones, of Fayette, Jones, of Lauderdale, Johnson, Kimball, Leonard, Lewis, McLellan, Posey, Potter, Russell, Sanford, Sheets, Sheffield, Slaughter, Smith, of Tuscaloosa, Steadham, Steele, Taylor, Timberlake, Watkins, Whitlock, Wilson, Winston, Wood--45.\n\nThose who voted in the negative are Messrs. President, Bailey, Baker, of Barbour, Baker, of Russell, Barnes, Beck, Blue, Bolling, Bragg, Catterling, Clarke, of Marengo, Cochran, Coleman, Crawford, Creech, Crook, Curtis, Daniel, Dargan, Davis, of Covington, Davis, of Pickens, Dowdell, Foster, Gibbons, Gilchrist, Hawkins, Henderson, of Pike, Henderson, of Macon, Herndon, Howard, Humphries, Jewett, Ketchum, Love, McClanahan, McPherson, McKinnie, Morgan, Owens, Phillips, Ralls, Rives, Ryan, Shortridge, Silver, Smith, of Henry, Starke, Stone, Watts, Webb, Whatley, Williamson, Yancey, Yelverton--54.\n\nMR. YANCEY moved to take up the Ordinance of Secession, and that it be adopted.\n\nPending this motion MR. CLARK, of Laurence, said:\n\nMr. President--As separate secession is not a right, so it is not a remedy. As a question of policy, merely, a more appalling picture can scarcely be presented to the eye of the patriot and philanthropist, than that of separate State secession. There is something repulsive in the very exclusiveness of its name.\n\nIt is no remedy, because it would remove no evil. The slavery question, the \"Iliad of all our woes,\" would not be decided in our favor, or even settled in any way. It would still continue a vital and ever-present issue. If we succeed in quieting or removing this cause of disturbance, we have accomplished all--if we fail, nothing. How shall separate secession effect this result? It would be a revolution of the Government, it is true, but it would not revolutionize the Northern mind. It would neither hush the pulpit, calm the forum, nor purify the quarters of Black Republicanism.\n\nThis mode of action certainly can afford no relief for the past. It is equally clear, it can provide no security for the future. Destitute\n\nPage 82\n\nof the ordinary means of self-defence--in no condition to demand an alliance, and without the power to invite one--the General Government provoked into hostility by our disobedience --other governments refusing to acknowledge our independence-- the surrounding States forced to become enemies by our dictation; shut out from the Pacific on the West, the Atlantic on the East; with Federal fleets cautiously watching our manoeuvres from the Gulf of Mexico--our border exposed on every side--abolitionism always ready to foray upon us--with no fugitive slave law to protect our property--without a treasury, an army or a navy--we should be, indeed, the Niobe of nations. Intimidated by our own weakness, distressed by our exposed condition, and exhausted by destructive efforts at self-preservation--all history teaches that but one fate would await us. The proud spirit of our people bruised, broken, and at last overcome by these combined agencies, would demand protection, as the dernier resort, from some stronger power--and Alabama ultimately become a dependency of Great Britain, or of France, or perhaps be forced to return \"in secret, in silence and tears\" to the American Confederacy! The minor States of ancient Greece, alternately paying tribute to Sparta or Athens, great as the power of one or the other was paramount, afford a mournful and instructive lesson upon this melancholy subject. The small feudatories of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, in England, also offer sad examples of the well established historical truth, that a weak State can only maintain a nominal independence--a sort of political wardship when environed by more powerful neighbors. Separate secession, therefore, so far from enabling us the more effectually to secure the interests of slavery, would only invite the descent and make us the easy prey of Northern marauders. Nations are not improvised. They are the slow and steady growth of centuries. \"A thousand years scarce seem to make a State.\"\n\nThe sense of insecurity, which our forlorn condition would beget, most certainly, would drive capital away; just at the time, too, when we should need it most. The cost of administering a government is in inverse proportion to its size. Federal officers with Shylock avidity, would seize the public revenue in every collection district, and direct taxation would be the only resource for funds with which to support the machinery of government. Our people, oppressed to the earth by a system of taxation more intolerable than that of despotic Austria, and impelled likewise, by the instinct of self-preservation, would strike their tents and emigrate to the West. Thus deserted by population, our lands would pass out of demand, and depreciate; and our negroes, too, cease to be valuable for want of a market. This emigration would go on\n\nPage 83\n\nchiefly from the white population, and the dismal proportion of negroes which we have already, would then become absolutely alarming. Our lovely State, with its few Caucasian inhabitants, would be converted into a kind of American Congo.\n\nShould Alabama and South Carolina withdraw their representation in Congress, the democratic majority there, which makes the present of slavery secure, according to the infamous Phillips, would be destroyed; and Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee, the great central slave and border States being left--ungenerously abandoned to the implacable vengeance of their relentless foe, would seek safety for their slaves in emigration, and fair equivolency in Southern markets; and, besides crowding the Gulf States with a ruinous surplus of the black race, would themselves, by gradually yielding up their lands to the exclusive culture of incoming whitemen from the North, become free States. Thus the institution of slavery, gradually receding before the Northern avalanche of abolitionism, pressing down upon it like a glacier in the gorges of the eternal Alps, and coming southward from State to State, would finally perish. We should then believe, but all too late, the recent declaration of Senator Wade, \"separate State secession is the decree for universal emancipation.\" This evil could not be remedied by laws prohibiting the immigration of negroes to the State. In thus attempting to avoid Charybdis, we should be wrecked upon Scylla. To obstruct the inter-slave-trade, is, at once, to \"clip the golden hair from the head of Nisus.\" The Black Republicans desire nothing more. It is the policy, therefore, of Alabama to remain, if not in the Union, at least in the South with Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky, interposed between her and the region of danger, if for no other purpose than to give protection to her own property. But she owes this much, at least, to those States themselves. Her patriotism, chivalry and magnanimity could never be excused for ingloriously deserting them in this hour of awful peril. The hostile tread of abolition invaders will only desecrate the virgin soil of Alabama, when the courage of the Old Dominion becomes a myth and the Kentucky rifle a fable.\n\nSurely, Alabama ought to exhibit no indecent haste in cutting the companionship of Virginia. She is a powerful auxiliary--a tried friend. If the State of Virginia, losing annually a hundred times as much property as our own, and submitting to a thousand indignities to which our people are strangers, can remain in the Union, at least long enough, to select with some deliberation the best mode of retiring from it, certainly Alabama's honor will not be compromised by the determined abandonment of a friend,\n\nPage 84\n\nso dear and invaluable. It is said that if Virginia and Kentucky do not wish to be deserted, let them follow Alabama. But is it not eminently discourteous, selfish and unkind, for any one State to arrogate the Supreme Dictatorship of fourteen equals?\n\nSouthern sentiment is opposed to separate State secession; and if not a majority, at least a large minority of our own people are violently hostile to it This circumstance, alone, should be conclusive against the policy. A large part of the produce of North Alabama finds a market in Tennessee, or passes through that State on its way to it. North Alabama has no idea of permitting her citizens and cotton to run the guantlet of passports, custom houses, and the other machinery of a foreign government as they go to market. Already many of her best and truest citizens are speaking of secession from Alabama and annexation to Tennessee: thus illustrating at once the utter absurdity of the doctrine of secession, as well as foreshadowing the storm that is impending over our own State. Shall we ever live to behold the day when Alabama, having assumed the untried responsibilities of separate secession, shall find herself torn, convulsed and rent in twain by the dissensions of her own people? Shall the martial roll of the warlike drum ever be heard reverbrating through the deep ravines of the Sand Mountains, calling the clansmen of the hills against our brothers of the South? Shall grim-visaged war lift his horrid front\" above the Arcadian valley of the Tennessee, and bestain and overspread with slaughter's pencil those beautiful and picturesque landscapes, brighter than any scene which ever flashed admiration upon the shepherd's soul among those flowering peaks, where \"smooth Peneus glassy flood reflects purpureal Tempe's pleasant scene?\" Shall the very Eden of peace, become the home of strife, of carnage and of destruction? The bare probability of such a thing \"fills me, and thrills me with terrors no mortal ever felt before.\" Great God forbid it!\n\nIn her name, and by her authority, I implore you to yield something, for once, to the demand of North Alabama--to your brothers who have the same common cause, danger and destiny, the same fathers and mothers to watch over and pray for you; who love and cherish you, and whose brave hearts and strong arms will bleed and strike for you in peril's darkest hour. Although cautious in council, North Alabama, when the conflict comes, if come it must, will lead your army to victory and to glory.\n\nWhat abolition aggression do you resist by going out of the Union alone? Will it repeal the personal liberty bills of the North? Will it return a single fugitive slave? Can it prevent the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia? or the suppression\n\nPage 85\n\nof the inter-State-slave trade? Alabama by seceding, voluntarily relinquishes whatever of interest she has in the golden fruitage of the territories--the Hesperides of America. Has the cotton bloom no interest in the Indian territory worth Alabama's attention? Can you witness without a pang the federal assetts go to enrich the coffers of your enemies? Will you shed not a tear when you bid farewell to that army and navy, around which so many glorious recollections cluster, and in which Southern valor has won such unperishable laurels? But above all, to say nothing of the grave of Washington and the home of Clay, are you ready tamely to surrender the Temple of the Constitution--the Jerusalem of our hopes--to the Saracens who beleager it? Southern patriots! can you repose in quiet upon your pillows while the Constitution of your fathers--the grandest effort of human workmanship--writhes in the harpy hands of Black Republicanism? Can you prevent this deplorable consummation by separate State action? Delude not yourselves with the vain hope, that if this Government is picked to pieces by fragments, it, or any considerable portion of it, can, upon some self-adjusting principle, ever rëunite in sufficient strength to demand and assert our claim to any of the Federal property which we shall abandon. Has history been written in vain? Shall we not profit by the experience of the past? If our fathers, surrounded by all of the terrors of the Revolution, could scarcely form a Union, how can their sons expect, in times of peace, to restore the unity of a disintegrated South? If a few weak and nerveless colonies--without money and without men--doubted long, and finally agreed with great reluctance, do you suppose that fifteen Sovereign States, as you so love to call them, would mingle again gracefully into one? Said Mr. Madison, in 1829, \"In the event of a dissolution of the Union, an impossibility of ever renewing it is brought home to every mind by the difficulties encountered in establishing it. But you ask me, where then would be a unity of interest, a unity of climate and a unity of soil--what would prevent a union in politics? The same causes which came so near defeating the hopes of liberty under the Articles of Confederation, and which rendered the present Constitution a necessity. The same causes which have operated in all ages and in all instances wherever the federative system has been attempted. History abounds with examples. The bad passions of men, and the passions of bad men. The ambitious schemes of selfish, political leaders, and the honestly entertained views of others--petty rivalry and jealousies--various views of government, questions of boundary, perhaps, and conflicting commercial regulations.\"\n\nPage 86\n\nBut suppose you could succeed, after striking Alabama from the constellation of States, in provoking a war with the General Government, if it was not imposed upon you, and by thus desolating her fair borders and slaughtering her peaceful citizens, draggoon the other Southern States unto your assistance and a union with you, would you do it? Every instinct of philanthropy, and common humanity answers for you a thousand times, no. My chief objection, therefore, to separate secession, is, that it would be a disunion of the South: a thought so gloomy and awful that it needs only to be mentioned.\n\nThese are a few of the numerous objections to peaceable separate State secession. But could this policy be carried out peaceably? I think not. It must be followed sooner or later, by an appeal to the high arbitrament of arms--where the eloquence of artillery would debate, and the bayonet's bloody point decide. The annals of all time furnish but few, if any, instances of a people changing their allegiance by a bloodless revolution. If the General Government were to attempt to coerce the State, that would determine the question at once. If the incoming administration, however, should adopt the constitutional constructions of its predecessor, the unpleasant alternative will be presented of engaging in a civil war, or of submitting to the collection of the Federal revenue. A brave people, ground down by taxation, will not be long in deciding that question. I shall not argue to it. A settled gloom comes over the mind and deadly sickness steals upon the heart at its mere contemplation. One paragraph from that magnificent burst of oratory, uttered by Mr. Webster in the great strife of 1850, which gathers new splendor from the impending crisis, is worth more than all of my argument: \"Who is so foolish--I beg everybody's pardon--as to expect to see any such thing? Sir, he who sees these States now revolving in harmony around a common centre, and expects to see them quit their places and fly off without convulsion, may look the next hour to see the heavenly bodies rush from their spheres and jostle against each other in the realms of space, without causing the wreck of the universe. There can be no such thing as peaceable secession. Peaceable secession is an utter impossibility. Is the great Constitution under which we live--covering this whole country--is it to be thawed and melted away by secession as the snows on the mountains melt in under the influence of a vernal sun, disappear almost unobserved and run off? No, sir! No, sir! I will not state what might produce disruption of the Union: but sir, I see as plainly as I see the sun in heaven what that disruption itself must produce. I see it must produce war, and such a war I will not describe in its twofold character.\"\n\nPage 87\n\nThe only hope for a peaceable secession is in a United South; and that alone can afford certain security to the future of slavery Now is the time, too, if ever, that it can be effected. Southern sentiment, although opposed to separate secession, is ripe for a Union of the South. That moral revolution which must always precede political changes, has been already wrought. Lincoln's election--a standing menace to slavery--by a party organized upon a basis of hostility to that species of property, in which all of the Southern States are so largely interested, will force the South into unity of idea.\n\nA united South! What music to the patriot's car! In it would be realized the brightest dreams of Southern statesmanship--the life-long ambition of the great Calhoun consummated--and the institution of slavery protected forever against the propagandism of the Northern mania. A united South implies all that is profitable in practice, beautiful in theory, and stupendous in conception. A salubrious climate, fertile soil, and nearly nine hundred thousand square miles of slave territory; fifty navigable rivers, unlocked by the rigors of winter; a sea coast by ocean and gulf almost immeasurable; a population in the year 1850 of nearly ten millions; her property worth, exclusive of slaves, in round numbers, three billions; and fifty-five millions of acres of improved land, groaning beneath the richest of harvests. The cash value of her farms, two billions of dollars; her farming implements alone worth sixty millions of dollars; her agricultural products, estimated at six hundred and thirty-two millions of dollars; each agriculturist earning in the sweat of honest industry, an average of one hundred and seventy-one dollars per annum: a capital of ninety-six millions of dollars employed in manufactures, and working up in raw material a value of eighty-seven millions of dollars. [Here Mr. Clark enlarged upon the resources of the South, and continued:] Besides, the South is the nursery of the Arts and Sciences, the land of the philosopher; the home of the orator and statesman, the poet, the historian and the divine. Its chivalry unvanquished by flood or by field, and its beauty blooming like \"wild roses by the abbey towers\" in every hamlet and village. While these statistical facts, taken indiscriminately from the census of 1850, augmented by a decade's increase, demonstrate that the South, under the present Government, has attained a distinction almost unrivalled in material progress, they admonish us to exercise great patience before we destroy the Constitution which has supplied us with so much nourishment, growth and wealth. They also show that the South, united, possesses within herself, all of the elements of greatness, prosperity and independence. Our independence would then be\n\nPage 88\n\nacknowledged, and our power, influence and vast resources would invite alliances. Coercion would then become a thing impossible, and even fanaticism itself would not attempt it. The united freemen of the South, standing above the soil of their nativity, and battling around the urns and sepulchres of their fathers, can never be conquered. We should then possess, in short, all of the requisites of a great nation; the evils incident to separate secession above alluded to, would be prevented; and in this way, if at all, the long train of deplorable disasters consequent upon civil war, avoided.\n\nThe North know that we are injured and that the grounds of our complaint are just. They know that if there is any wrong in the fugitive slave law, we are indebted to them for it. Almost before their tracks were dry on the decks of the May-flower, in 1643, only twenty-three years after,\n\n\"A band of exiles moor'd the bark\n\nOn the wild New England shore.\"\n\nCommissioners from Connecticut, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and other places enacted a Fugitive Slave Law.\n\nLet the South in her united majesty once more come forth \"with her cohorts gleaming in purple and gold,\" and, lifting her mighty voice, like the sound of many waters, above the granite hills of New England, utter again to Abolitionism, the edict of heaven: \"thou shalt not steal.\" We owe it to the interests of liberty--to republican institutions, and to the great rights of man throughout the civilized world. We owe it to that long line of posterity which shall rise up and bless us--to the present with all of its untold grandeur--and to the illustrious past.\n\nAn act, involving such momentous consequences as the tearing down or building up a government implies, should not be done in passion, pique or precipitation. We should at least determine the successor before we dethrone the incumbent--agree upon the form of a new government before we destroy the old. Our ancestors were nearly a century and a half in erecting the present government of the United States; and in the Convention which assembled in Albany in 1754, its ruling spirit, Dr. Franklin, and his associate commissioners, unlike our separate secession advocates, spurned the idea of separate Confederacies. Indeed, colonial history fully proves that the great statesmen who were acting under a high and patriotic sense of their responsibilities to mankind, and whose deliberations resulted in the formation of a government, which up to the present moment has been regarded with wonder and admiration by the civilized world, were controlled by two principles, which obtain but little favor with the government makers of the present day: the greatest caution and a strong desire for\n\nPage 89\n\nunited action. They were acting, too, under circumstances ten times more alarming than those which surround us, and with precisely the same object in view--self-protection against external danger. Even after hostilities had commenced in the province of Massachusetts, they published resolutions renouncing trade with Great Britain, Canada and the Colonies; they preferred petitions to the King; and it was only after argument, persuasion, remonstrance, entreaty, non-intercourse and every other conciliatory measure had been exhausted, that they struck the final blow which made America free.\n\nWhat a change has come over the spirit of South Carolina's dream! Then she was prudent, cautious, full of delay; even up to the first day of July, 1776, although her arms had flashed forth at Fort Moultrie in a blaze of glory, she had not given in her adherence to the Declaration of Independence; and the reason, still more singular, was that one of her deputies wanted time to unite others in the project.\n\nFor these reasons, with many others, it is the policy of Alabama, clearly indicated, to invite a Conference of the Southern States for consultation and endorsement. What should be the policy of that Convention, it is not for me to anticipate. But, that great good would result from it we may safely hope. If some plan of reconciliation were derived by it which should satisfy the demands of the Southern States, as I confidently believe would be done, certainly every good patriot would hail it with delight. But if after we have made this last appeal to the justice of the North--after we have exhausted, like our revolutionary fathers, argument, persuasion and entreaty, injustice and wrong shall continue to rule then counsels--thus manifesting the determination to wage the \"irrepressible conflict\" until the foot of the slave shall no longer tread the soil of the South--then no constitutional scruples about State sovereignty or Federal coercion will be mooted; the South in grand, unbroken and consolidated unity, would appeal to that right which is higher than all constitutions--which tears down and sets up governments--which topples dynasties and crushes empires--which dethrones kings and decapitates tyrants--the implacable right which the Great God of the Universe has granted to man in the eternal charter of the skies--the right of every community to freedom and happiness, and of every people, when the government established over them becomes incompetent to fulfill its purposes, or destructive of the essential ends for which it was instituted, founded upon the law of nations and the reason of mankind, and supported by the best authority and most illustrious precedents, to throw off such government and provide new guards for\n\nPage 90\n\ntheir future security. If the wisdom, the patriotism and the experience of the land, assembled in solemn council, after calmly surveying the facts and maturely, considering the consequences of their act, shall be of the opinion that the dearest interests of our people require the destruction of the government, let them quietly ascertain and define our grievances; and then having adopted the example of the immortal fathers of the first revolution, in vindication of the second, \"let facts be submitted to a candid world.\" But if this Convention should neither restore peace nor declare independence, our condition would be no worse than it is now. Once more, therefore, in the names of Liberty, of Peace, of happy hours--of the aged, of the poor, of our mothers, of our sisters--of helpless humanity throughout the borders of our State, I implore you to concede something to the counties of North Alabama.\n\nMR. TIMBERLAKE offered the following amendment:\n\nAmend by inserting the following after the second section of the Ordinance, viz:\n\nAnd it being the desire of the State of Alabama to form a Provisional Government, and a Southern Confederacy, upon the basis of the Constitution of the United States of America, with such of the slaveholding States as will join in forming the same; and the present resumption of its powers are declared to be for that purpose.\n\nMR. TIMBERLAKE said:\n\nIn proposing this amendment, he hoped to so explain an ordinance by the adoption of which, Alabama proposes to resume the powers heretofore delegated to the Federal Government, as to confine the future action of the State, in the exercise of those powers, to the formation of a Confederacy of Southern States. He was unwilling to clothe Alabama with those powers for any other purpose; he could but regard the experiment of States, (formerly belonging to the United States,) setting up for themselves separate independent Governments, as being dangerous and unwise in policy, and as it had been a question upon which the parties in this Convention differed in the late canvass, both agreeing that the object and purpose of secession was the formation of a new Confederacy with Southern States. The Ordinance thus explained, will be complete for that purpose. He was willing that Alabama should resume the delegated powers for that purpose and for no other.\n\nPage 91\n\nThis Convention has power to adopt all measures for the defence of the interest and honor of Alabama, as well before as after the act of separation.\n\nMR. WHATLEY said:\n\nThe amendment of the gentleman from Jackson, is already incorporated in the Ordinance proposed by the Committee. The only spirit and object of the Ordinance is to accomplish what the gentleman proposes. It seems that no explanation or solicitations by the Chairman of the Committee, and other members, can suit the taste of the gentleman from Jackson; I therefore move to lay his amendment on the table.\n\nMR. YANCEY said:\n\nHe was willing to vote for a proposition that it was the desire and intention of the people of Alabama in seceding, to join other seceding States in erecting a Southern Confederacy of States upon the principles of the Constitution of the United States of America. But he could not vote for the proposition of the gentleman from Jackson, [Mr. Timberlake.] because it announced such design as the sole motive in seceding from the Union. He asked the attention of the gentleman from Jackson to this distinction. If he really desired an announcement, upon the part of delegates, that they intended to use all proper efforts to frame a Confederacy of Southern States upon Republican principles, let him alter his amendment so as to express that idea, and he will receive a hearty support from the friends of secession in this Convention. For us to vote for this amendment as now worded, is to ask us to declare a motive for secession which was never entertained by its friends.\n\nThe advocates of secession placed their action upon far higher grounds. They believed that the rights and liberties of the people of Alabama were assailed, and endangered by the Northern majorities, who control a majority of the States, and who are about to control the legislation of the Union.\n\nBelieving this, secession, or withdrawal of the State from under the power of that hostile majority, was advocated purely for the purpose--for the purpose alone--of protecting and preserving the endangered rights of the people of this sovereign State--even though not another State should follow our example. Though this was the sole purpose of secession, yet we all believed that other States would secede, and in that event it was our hope that\n\nPage 92\n\nthey would join us in forming a new Confederacy upon old-fashioned Republican principles.\n\nAfter a short discussion, Mr. WHATLEY renewed his motion to lay the amendment on the table.\n\nThe ayes and noes were called, and resulted: ayes 62--noes 37.\n\nThose who voted in the affirmative were Messrs. Brooks, Allen, Bailey, Baker of Barbour, Barnes, Beck, Blue, Bolling, Bragg, Catterling, Clarke of Marengo, Clarke of Lawrence, Cochran, Coleman, Crawford, Creech, Crook, Curtis, Daniel, Dargan, Davis of Covington, Davis of Madison, Davis of Pickens, Dowdell, Foster, Gibbons, Gilchrist, Green, Hawkins, Henderson of Macon, Henderson of Pike, Herndon, Howard, Humphries, Jewett, Jones of Lauderdale, Ketchum, Lewis, Love, McClanahan, McClellan, McPherson, McKinne, Morgan, Owens, Phillips, Ralls, Rives, Ryan, Sheets, Shortridge, Silver, Smith of Henry, Starke, Stone, Watts, Webb, Whatley, Williamson, Wood, Yancey, Yelverton--62.\n\nThose who voted in the negative were Messrs. Baker of Russell, Barclay, Beard, Brasher, Bulger, Clemens, Coffey, Coman, Crumpler, Earnest, Edwards, Ford, Forrester, Franklin, Gay, Guttery, Hood, Inzer, Jemison, Jones of Fayette, Johnson, Kimball, Leonard, Posey, Potter, Russell, Sanford, Sheffield, Slaughter, Smith of Tuscaloosa, Stedham, Steele, Taylor, Watkins, Whitlock, Wilson, Winston--37.\n\nMR. YANCEY moved the following amendment, to be inserted immediately after the Ordinance, and before the resolutions:\n\n\"And as it is the desire and purpose of the people of Alabama to meet the slaveholding States of the South, who may approve such purpose, in order to frame a provisional as well as permanent Government, upon the principles of the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\nThe amendment of Mr. Yancey was adopted.\n\nMR. WATTS announced the presence of Ex-Governor J. W. Matthews, Commissioner from Mississippi, who was, on motion, invited to a seat within the bar of the Convention.\n\nPage 93\n\nOn motion of MR. JEMISON, the Convention then adjourned until to-morrow (Friday), at 11 o'clock, A. M.\n\nFIFTH DAY-JANUARY ELEVENTH.\n\nThe President laid before the Convention the following official dispatches from the State of Florida:\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Jan. 10.--Florida has seceded unconditionally by a vote of sixty-two to seven.\n\nM. S. PERRY.\n\nThe other was from Hon. E. C. Bullock, Commissioner from Alabama to Florida, precisely similar to the one from Gov. Perry.\n\nThe President announced that the special order before the Convention for this day, was the report of the majority from the Committee of Thirteen, and the Ordinance of Secession.\n\nMR. JEMISON, who was entitled to the floor, said:\n\nThat he had thought of submitting to the Convention, this morning, some extended remarks touching this most important question; but, upon reflection, he would decline to do so. His own mind had long been made up to acquiesce in whatever the majority of the Convention might do. He was pledged, unconditionally, to his constituents to this course; and he would cheerfully carry out his pledge; and, he trusted, to their satisfaction. He would not only acquiesce himself in the passage of the Ordinance of Secession, but, upon his return to his constituents, he would use all honorable exertions, if need be, to satisfy the people with the action of this body. This he deemed to be his duty, as suggested by every consideration of patriotism. The public welfare demanded unity of action; and, so far as he was concerned, the best energies of his mind would be devoted to that end.\n\nMR. DARGAN said:\n\nI wish, Mr. President, to express the feelings with which I vote for the secession of Alabama from the Government of the United States; and to state, in a few words, the reasons that impel me to this act.\n\nI feel impelled, Mr. President, to vote for this Ordinance by an overruling necessity. Years ago I was convinced that the Southern\n\nPage 94\n\nStates would be compelled either to separate from the North, by dissolving the Federal Government, or they would be compelled to abolish the institution of African Slavery. This, in my judgment, was the only alternative; and I foresaw that the South would be compelled, at some day, to make her selection. The day is now come, and Alabama must make her selection, either to secede from the Union, and assume the position of a sovereign, independent State, or she must submit to a system of policy on the part of the Federal Government that, in a short time, will compel her to abolish African Slavery.\n\nMr. President, if pecuniary loss alone were involved in the abolition of slavery, I should hesitate long before I would give the vote I now intend to give. If the destruction of slavery entailed on us poverty alone, I could bear it, for I have seen poverty and felt its sting. But poverty, Mr. President, would be one of the least of the evils that would befall us from the abolition of African slavery. There are now in the slaveholding States over four millions of slaves; dissolve the relation of master and slave, and what, I ask, would become of that race? To remove them from amongst us is impossible. History gives us no account of the exodus of such a number of persons. We neither have a place to which to remove them, nor the means of such removal. They therefore must remain with us; and if the relation of master and slave be dissolved, and our slaves turned loose amongst us without restraint, they would either be destroyed by our own hands--the hands to which they look, and look with confidence, for protection--or we ourselves would become demoralized and degraded. The former result would take place, and we ourselves would become the executioners of our own slaves. To this extent would the policy of our Northern enemies drive us; and thus would we not only be reduced to poverty, but what is still worse, we should be driven to crime, to the commission of sin; and we must, therefore, this day elect between the Government formed by our fathers (the whole spirit of which has been perverted,) and POVERTY AND CRIME! This being the alternative, I cannot hesitate for a moment what my duty is. I must separate from the Government of the United States, and abandon the Government of my fathers, one under which I have lived, and under which I wished to die. But I must do my duty to my country and my fellow-beings; and humanity, in my judgment, demands that Alabama should separate herself from the Government of the United States.\n\nIf I am wrong in this responsible act, I hope my God may forgive me; for I am not actuated, as I think, from any motive save that of justice and philanthropy!\n\nPage 95\n\nMR. POSEY said:\n\nMr. President--Before the vote is taken, I desire to offer some reflections, not arguments, upon this solemn occasion. I admit the time for argument is passed. The test votes taken upon the question clearly indicate the determination of a majority on this floor, to withdraw Alabama from the Government left us by our fathers, and which all here once valued as our richest inheritance.\n\n\"I come to bury Cræar, not to praise him.\" Mr. President, I know you are a man, having the feelings of a man, and can appreciate the sensations of the minority. Reflect how you would have felt before you had been prepared, head and heart, to dissolve our relations with the Federal Government. We of the minority have not advanced so far; we would make one more effort to preserve the Federal Government, and by united action with the other Southern States, demand and sustain all our just rights; and should such united demands be refused by the States of the North, then to withdraw together from the Union.\n\nThe minority believe the Ordinance of Secession ought to be submitted to the people; our constituents believe the same, and would submit more willingly to the vote of the people themselves. This Ordinance will be more distasteful to them, because they have not been allowed to ratify or reject it. I hope they will acquiesce in the action of a majority of this Convention. Division at home would be worse than Secession; this is the opinion of the minority on this floor, upon mature reflection. The first impression of some of us, was, if the Convention refused to submit the question to the people, to bolt the Convention and return home. This intention we have abandoned; the conciliatory course of the majority on this floor, was wise and prudent, and has induced us to remain; and as we conceive, without being responsible for the Act of Secession, we can stay here and aid in providing for the emergencies of the future.\n\nMR. JONES, of Lauderdale, said:\n\nThat he had not wasted the time of the Convention by factious opposition to the action of the majority; he did not desire to do so now, yet he thought the act about to be performed would justify him in occupying the time of the Convention for a few moments.\n\nThis had been the most solemn hour of his life--he expected to feel no more solemn when he should stand in the presence of the King of Terrors.\n\nPage 96\n\nWe are to sever the ties that have hitherto bound us to the Federal Union, and enter upon an unknown sea of experiment. He would not argue the propriety of that act. The whole history of this Convention proves that the decision is already made--that each member has determined the course he will pursuse, and is prepared to meet the responsibility of his acts both now and hereafter.\n\nKnowing this, he would not have said one word, but for the fact that it was reported and believed by many, that the constituency he represented were submissionists: this is a great mistake.\n\nThe people of Lauderdale are as jealous of their rights, and as ready to resent an infraction of those rights, as any people represented on this floor--they have solemnly and unanimously declared, time and again, that they would not submit to Black Republican rule on the principles enunciated by that party--they hold doctrines announced in your resolutions of Monday last to be their principles, and stand pledged to maintain them.\n\n'Tis true, they differ with you about the time and mode of redress; they think that hasty secession is not the proper remedy; they think it unwise, impolitic and wanting in proper courtesy to our brethren of the border States. Thus you see, we do not differ about the fact, but the manner of redress--the remedy. But whether your mode or ours be wisest, he would not argue; that must be left for future history to decide.\n\nHe had been much moved by the remarks offered by the gentleman from Green, [Mr. Webb]. Seventeen years ago he had met that gentleman in the House of Representatives, when they were mere boys; since then, they had met in both ends of the Capitol, and he had ever found him ready to accord full and ample justice to my section. North Alabama had never drawn a draft on him, he did not honor. Then, sir, if the danger which he describes shall befall his section of the State, he will find us ready and willing to share every toil and divide every danger. Though differing totally from the majority on this subject, yet he was a son of Alabama, born and reared upon her soil, he had not, nor expected to live beyond her limits. To her he owned his first allegiance, and through her a second to the Federal Union. When Alabama shall sever this last allegiance and bid him stand in her defence, he had but one course of duty left. When her banner was unfurled he should stand beneath it--her friends should be his friends and her enemies his.\n\nThese opinions were widely known to his constituents, and they sent him here because they endorsed them. He would only add that he had a boy 15 years old now training in your ranks, and\n\nPage 97\n\nhis mother says that when he is called his father must go with him; and he could not shrink from the responsibility.\n\nMR. INZER said:\n\nMr. President--This is the most solemn period of my life. Although a young man, I have been looking forward for years to a dissolution of the States composing this Confederacy. The Great Compact has already been broken. South Carolina, Florida and Mississippi have seceded, and before the going down of the sun the State of Alabama will have declared her independence, and no longer be one of the United States of America. I am pledged to oppose the Ordinance. I told the people of the county which I have the honor to represent, that if elected, I would most assuredly vote against immediate separate secession; and today I stand here ready to redeem my pledge, and will vote against the Ordinance. But when it becomes the organic law of my State, I will support it, as I believe it to be my duty to do so. I believe the people of my county will stand by the action of the State in her sovereign capacity; and I am in hopes that Alabama will go on with her great work to independence and prosperity. I told the people of St. Clair, [Mr. Inzer's county,] while canvassing the county, that I was in favor of coöperation; but said, if Alabama should secede separate and alone, I would go with her and stand by her in every peril, even to the cannon's mouth; and I now repeat it, I am for Alabama under any and all circumstances.\n\nMR. SMITH, of Tuscaloosa, said:\n\nMr. President--I will not at this time express any argument of opposition I may entertain towards the Ordinance of Secession. I have many reasons for this course.\n\nI meet here a positive, enlightened and unflinching majority. I have respect for them, and I despair of being able to move them.\n\nIn times like these, when neighboring States are withdrawing one by one from the Union, I cannot get my consent to utter a phrase which might be calculated, in the slightest degree, to widen the breaches at home. My opposition to the Ordinance of Secession will be sufficiently indicated by my vote; that vote will be recorded in the book; that book will take up its march for posterity; and the day is not yet come that is to decide on which part of the page of that book will be written the glory or the shame of this day.\n\nIt is important to the State that you of the majority should be\n\nPage 98\n\nright, and that I should be wrong. However much personal gratification I might feel hereafter in finding that I was right on this great question, and that you were wrong, that gratification would indeed be to me a poor consolation in the midst of a ruined and desolated country. Therefore, as the passage of the Ordinance of Secession is the act by which the destiny of Alabama is to be controlled, I trust that you are right, and that I am wrong. I trust that God has inspired you with His wisdom, and that, under the influence of this Ordinance, the State of Alabama may rise to the highest pinnacle of national grandeur.\n\nTo show, sir, that the declarations I now make are not forced by the exigencies of this hour, I read one of the resolutions from the platform upon which I was elected to this Convention:\n\n\"Resolved, That we hold it to be our duty, first, to use all honorable exertions to secure our rights in the Union, and if we should fail in this, we will maintain our rights out of the Union--for, as citizens of Alabama, we owe our allegiance first to the State; and we will support her in whatever course she may adopt.\"\n\nThus, Mr. President, you will observe that the course I now take is the result of the greatest deliberation, having been matured before I was a candidate for a seat in this Convention; and there is a perfect understanding on this subject between me and my constituents.\n\nIt but remains for me to add, that when your Ordinance passes through the solemn forms of legislative deliberation, and receives the sanction of this body, I shall recognize it as the supreme law of the land; my scruples will fall to the ground; and that devotion, which I have heretofore, through the whole course of my public life, given to the Union of the States, shall be concentrated in my allegiance to the State of Alabama.\n\nMR. GREEN said:\n\nHe would vote against the Ordinance, but would sustain the action of the Convention. His people would ratify and fully endorse it. Mr. G. spoke feelingly, and said he hoped the people of Alabama would be a unit.\n\nHe had been elected as a coöperationist; and would now greatly prefer a consultation with the slaveholding States before he severed the bonds of the Union. But, he would not withhold his acquiesence from the will of a majority here, however much he might be convinced, in his own mind, of the propriety of coöperation. In this great day of interest, it becomes all good men to be united\n\nPage 99\n\nin the same ranks to promote the general welfare of the people, and to oppose our enemies in a solid and determined body.\n\nMR. KIMBALL said:\n\nMr. President--The passage of the Ordinance is now a settled fact; and I do not rise, sir, to make factious opposition to its passage. It is due to myself, it is a duty I owe the people whom I represent on this floor, that I should express to this body, the power delegated to me by my people. Now, sir, I represent in part, thirty-three hundred votes, as good and true people to the South as lives on Alabama soil. It is true they were opposed to separate secession; that opposition, nevertheless, made them none the less opposed to Black Republicanism; but in my opinion, the more effectual. In all my intercourse with my fellow-citizens, I found none who did not cordially desire a united South, not a dissenting voice. In the \"Advertizer\" of this morning, I find a dispatch expressing the opinion of Gen. Scott, who is said to be the great War Spirit, who unhesitatingly says, that with a certain unanimity of the Southern States, it would be impolitic and improper to attempt coercion. This is the effect we expected to consummate by the action of coöperation. We believed it would be effectual with less loss of blood and treasure. Now, sir, to show our sincerity in effectual resistance, I read from the platform, published to the people, on which we went before them for the position we occupy on this floor. One of the resolutions in said platform, says:\n\n\"That in order to secure the coöperation of the South as a unit, and justify ourselves in the eyes of the world, we consider it wise and politic that a general Convention of all the Southern States should be called to adopt an ultimatum to the Northern Republicans, and that unless such ultimatum so presented be adopted, that then our safety, and the preservation of our rights, demand that those rights should be maintained, even if it result in the secession of the State of Alabama and the rupture of the Union.\"\n\nNow, sir, this shows a laudable effort on the part of the people of Tallapoosa, to avoid the horrors of war by securing a united action of the South on an ultimatum. The rejection of which, would certainly greatly tend to our unanimity--a most desirable object.\n\nAnother objection I have to the passage of the Ordinance, under existing circumstances, is the evident disposition and settled purpose of this Convention not to submit this Ordinance to the people for their rejection or ratification. It is right and proper, this should be done. The sovereign people of the State of Alabama, on a great question of this sort, should be consulted; they are the parties\n\nPage 100\n\nwhose interest is to be affected. In this opinion all parties were agreed, and I now read the resolution to which none (of the candidates,) in Tallapoosa objected:\n\n\"That the Sovereignty of Alabama remains with the people thereof, and that the result of the Convention called by the Governor, let it be what it may, should be referred back to the people for their rejection or ratification.\"\n\nAs one of the Committee of Thirteen, I desired this should be done; but as this Convention has decreed otherwise, as a loyal citizen of Alabama, I must yield; and I am satisfied my constituents will concur, and will stand by Alabama in weal and woe.\n\nMR. JOHNSON said:\n\nMr. President--Similar reasons to those assigned by gentlemen as having influenced them in arriving at the conclusion to sustain the Ordinance when passed, has operated upon and influenced me in forming a similar conclusion. This question differs very materially from all ordinary political questions. To have opposed the policy of separate State secession, before any action taken or expression given by this Convention, was certainly legitimate, and, I think, wise; but having ascertained that there is a well-defined majority of this body in favor of that policy, further resistance should cease.\n\nIt is either factious or revolutionary, or both; and hence, in my opinion, should not be persisted in.\n\nThe minority of this body, with which I have acted, have voluntarily and patriotically pledged themselves, unanimously, to resist abolition aggression.\n\nWe have had an opportunity of expressing our preference as to the mode and measure of resistance which we would offer to present and anticipated aggressions.\n\nWe preferred the calling of a Convention of all, or as many of the slaveholding States, as would meet us in such Convention, in order that we might avail ourselves of their counsel, their grievances, and their simultaneous action. This Convention decided that to be impracticable.\n\nThen, sir, acting upon the principle that the people are sovereign, and should be permitted to exercise their inalienable right to supervise the action of their agents, in a matter involving their dearest rights and destiny, we proposed to refer the action of this Convention to the people, for their ratification or rejection.\n\nThis was decided to be impolitic or unnecessary. Having thus failed, sir, to induce the Convention to adopt our policy or mode\n\nPage 101\n\nof resistance, the alternative is presented: Will we adopt Secession as a mode of resistance? or will we say to the world that we prefer Submission to this mode of resisting abolition aggression?\n\nI prefer secession to submission, and will not only sustain your Ordinance when passed, but will go farther, and say that, if responsibility attaches to its passage, I will share that responsibility.\n\nI will vote for the ordinance, believing that Talladega county is unwilling to shun a responsibility which other counties of the State are willing to assume. The entire delegation from Talladega, as well as those from Coosa, will vote for the Ordinance.\n\nWe are not influenced, in casting this vote, by a desire to conciliate the majority here, or to obtain popularity elsewhere, for the records of this body will show our preference, and views as to the mode of resistance which should be adopted. We desire that our common enemy should know and appreciate, that so far as relates to a determination to resist their aggression, there is but one feeling in Alabama: and although we may and do differ as to the means by which we will protect our rights and our institutions, yet I wish them to see and feel that, although our line of policy is rejected by a majority of a Convention of that people. yet we will accept another means and another policy.\n\nI have no hesitancy in saying, sir, that I believe the entire people of Alabama will sustain this Ordinance when passed, and I humbly hope we may go on in our course of greatness and prosperity, and that this action may redound to the honor and interest of the entire people.\n\nMR. WATKINS said:\n\nMr. President--The Ordinance before us, proposing the severance of this State from a Government so deeply rooted in the affections of the people, is a matter of such grave concern, and involves so many great and vital considerations, as to make it necessary that I, in common with others who have preceded me, should say something touching the vote I am about to give.\n\nA native of one of the Southern States, who, for more than twenty years of continued residence in this State, has enjoyed her beneficence and protection, because wedded to her soil, identified with her institutions, and, withal, jealous of her honor and watchful in guarding against any infraction of the rights of her people, I feel it to be a duty, no less of affection than gratitude, on this great occasion, to declare the most devoted fealty to her, and to pledge all I have and am in her behalf, whatever may be her fate.\n\nThe constituency I represent--with whose sentiments I fully\n\nPage 102\n\ncoincide--are deeply and strongly attached to the Union of the American States; and, although they acknowledge and feel that grievous evils exist, which call for prompt and efficient resistance, they believe that a more satisfactory, safe, and effective remedy can be had, by a coöperative effort on the part of all the Southern States, than by the more desperate and hazardous expedient of separate State secession, proposed in the Ordinance before this Convention. I shall vote against the Ordinance, in obedience to the will of the people I represent, and will cheerfully await the verdict of the future as to the wisdom which actuates it.\n\nMR. BEARD said:\n\nMr. President--I came to this Convention a warm friend to the policy of consulting and coöperating with all the slaveholding States, or with as many of them as would agree to meet us for the purpose of consultation. I have labored faithfully to carry out my desires--as much so as any member here; and I still believe that that would be the best, safest and wisest course for Alabama to adopt in this trying emergency. But my opinions in this regard will not lead me to stubborness in my opposition to what this Convention, in its wisdom, may decide to do. That I am, and have been, in favor of resistance to the rule of Black Republicanism, has already been shown by my vote on the resolution which was adopted by this Convention on the first day of our meeting. If this Convention shall decide on immediate secession, as the surest and wisest mode of resistance; and if, in the wisdom of the counsel that prevails here, it shall be decided that this is the remedy for the surest redress of our grievances, while I may not agree to endorse this with my vote, I am the last man in the State of Alabama who would lift a voice of opposition to your decree. I will acquiesce in your action, and I will support, heartily, the State of Alabama, in all the difficulties that may beset her now or hereafter, so long as I am able to raise my voice in her councils or my arm in her defense. And I can safely say as much for the people of my county--who, though by a large majority, have been in favor of coöperation and consultation with the slaveholding States, yet they will earnestly support the State of Alabama in all her troubles, even though the necessities of the times should call them to take up arms, and to muster in the ranks of the army in military array. I, as well as they, will be prepared, under whatever emergencies may arise, to shoulder my musket and to do as good service for our country as any man on this floor. We will be found to be in the rear of none in our readiness to act when the moment of danger comes.\n\nPage 103\n\nI shall vote against the Ordinance of Secession, but to that extent alone will my opposition be carried.\n\nMR. STEELE said:\n\nThat he would stand with the bravest and truest of Alabama's sons in support of the action of the Convention, and in defence of the honor and independence of Alabama. Though opposed to the Ordinance, and in favor rather of the policy of consulting with the other slaveholding States, yet he would not carry his opinion so far as to embarrass, in any manner, the will of the majority of the delegates in this Convention. In the hour of danger he would know no country but Alabama; and he would be ready, he hoped, to show his allegiance, in some practical way, whenever the State should need his services.\n\nMR. CRUMPLER said, in substance:\n\n[Speaking for himself and colleagues,] that he and his colleagues were elected on the coöperation ticket, and had acted and voted with the coöperation party on every measure before the Convention. He now felt it to be his duty, with the facts before him, to vote for the Ordinance of Secession and the resolutions. His colleagues, Col. Taylor and Maj. Leonard, would cheerfully vote with him. We pledge ourselves to do all in our power to induce our constituents to sustain and fully sanction the action of the Convention, believing now that Secession is the only proper and effectual mode of resistance. Our first plan being defeated, we feel bound to vote for prompt and immediate secession--that being the only effectual plan now left us by which to preserve our rights, our honor, our equality and our liberties. Let all patriotic citizens now UNITE AND RALLY, AS ONE PEOPLE, around the standard of free and independent Alabama, and all will be well.\n\nMR. CLARK, of Laurence, said:\n\nAfter having manifested by my remarks of yesterday, a more decided opposition to the passage of the Ordinance of Secession than any other member of this Convention, the observations I am about to make, I trust, may not be deemed wholly inopportune. Sir, I have loved, honored and revered the Union of our fathers. I have cherished it for the good it has accomplished--the liberty it has secured, and the public and private prosperity it has dispensed. The treasure expended in its defence, the privations patriotically\n\nPage 104\n\nendured, and the many heroic lives voluntarily sacrificed to purchase the blessings it affords, I have never forgotten, and can never forget.\n\nWhere now are Columbia's classics? What becomes of her legends and her traditions? Where are her anniversaries--her Bunker Hills, her Lexingtons, her Yorktowns? Where, her national airs--her hymns of freedom? Entombed in the storied urns and sepulchres of the Past.\n\nThese recollections will be treasured up in the hearts of our countrymen as the sacred mementoes of a dead friend. They are Liberty's bright gems, sprinkled upon the page of oblivion, which patriotism, in after years, will delight to gather and string around the neck of memory. I have opposed the Secession movement from its incipiency to its completion. Coöperative action I have thought was the better policy, and my opinion is, now, unchanged. I shall vote against the Ordinance. But when the Ordinance shall become the LAW of the State, the same reasons which have been urged with so much force against Secession, apply with equal cogency in favor of acquiescence. Resistance to this Ordinance could only result in strife and dissension among our people. If any one believes that I would be guilty of inciting hostile divisions between different sections of the State, and thus enkindle the flames of civil war throughout the borders of Alabama, he has very much mistaken his man.\n\nMR. EDWARDS said:\n\nMr. President--I have opposed the passage of the Ordinance of Secession in every honorable way that I possibly could. I am opposed to separate State action, but to carry this opposition further, is wholly unnecessary now in this Convention. I have opposed it, sir, because I believed such a course unwise on the part of Alabama. Again, I oppose its passage because in all cases where the fundamental principles of Government are to be changed, such changes should be submitted to the people for their approval or disapproval. It is contended by the friends of the Ordinance, that the majority of the people have spoken out in regard to this matter; but, sir, this is doubtful. Then, sir, as there are some doubts in regard to which way the majority stands in this particular case, I do contend, that the action of the Convention ought to be submitted to the people for their adoption or rejection at the ballot-box. Mr. President, the people whom I have the honor to represent upon this floor, did not presume to think that this Convention would pass an Ordinance of Secession without its reference to\n\nPage 105\n\nthem; but, sir, they, together with many others in Northern Alabama, will be greatly disappointed in that respect. My constituents made it obligatory upon me, to use my best exertions to have the action of the Convention referred to them. This I have done to the best of my ability. But I, together with the party with whom I have acted, have signally failed. Inasmuch, therefore, as the action of the Convention is final, I am not prepared at this time to say, whether the people of my county will acquiesce in it or not. I know, sir, they are excited to a considerable extent, and when the news reaches my county that Alabama has seceded from the Union. I anticipate the excitement will run much higher.\n\nSir, when I return home, I am in duty bound, to state to my fellow-citizens the action of this Convention, and in doing so, I will here state, that I will use no effort on my part to excite them to rebellion.\n\nMR. RALLS said:\n\nMr. President--I rise not for the purpose of making a speech, but simply a remark or two. My position as a delegate, is in some respects peculiar. I am not a coöperation secessionist.\n\nThe people who have sent me here have no demands to make of the North. One of the resolutions adopted at the meeting nominating me, was that secession was the only remedy.\n\nStraight-out, was the phrase used in the canvass, instead of separate State action; although it was explained to the people that every State must act for itself, as one State could not for another One word as to the term straight-out. At the time I was nominated, the Union was unbroken, and the subsequent action of South Carolina furnished an example of straight-out secession, as understood by my people; that is to say, secession without an assurance that any other State would assume the same attitude; and against this I was pledged.\n\nNow, what are the circumstances by which we are surrounded? South Carolina is out; so also is Florida; so also is Mississippi; and there can be no doubt that Georgia, my native State, will take the same proud position next week, and that Louisiana and Texas will follow in rapid succession. Yea, Mr. President, may I not go a step further and say, that there is good ground to hope that the border slaveholding States will wheel into line and unite their destiny with the extreme Southern or cotton States?\n\nI find then around me the coöperation that my constituents desire--that is, coöperation in seceding.\n\nPage 106\n\nThat these seceding States, impelled by a common danger, and attracted by common interests and sympathies, will unite again in the establishment of a republican form of government, thus securing the liberty and peace of the people, is in my mind, a question that admits of no doubt. This opinion has been long entertained, publicly expressed, and the developments of every day confirm me in it.\n\nThe way is clear. I shall vote for the Ordinance.\n\nMR. SHEFFIELD said:\n\nMr. President--I rise with great diffidence, on this occasion, knowing my inability to do justice to the subject before the Convention. I merely wish to state my position before the vote is taken on the Ordinance. I have known, for days, that the Ordinance would pass. I have used every exertion to prevent it, but without a hope of success. I have written home to my constituents, that such would be the case, and asking them whether, in that event, they desired me to sign it. As an individual, I will sustain the action of my State, honestly and zealously; and if war should come, I will not only counsel my people to submit to the decision of the Convention, but to maintain it with arms in the field. I have opposed secession as long as opposition was of any avail. Now that the Ordinance will pass, as a patriot, I feel bound to take the side of my native State in any contest which might grow out of it. I will vote against the Ordinance.\n\nMR. POTTER said:\n\nMr. President--Sir, as every member of this body must necessarily take position, either for or against this measure, by the vote which will very soon be cast, I feel in duty bound to offer some reasons why my vote shall be cast against the passage of this Ordinance at the present time.\n\nSir, the decision which we make to-day upon this, in all human probability, the most momentous question that shall ever be settled by the people of Alabama, may, for weal or woe, tell more potently upon all ages to come, than any which will ever claim our consideration or demand our action.\n\nNow, sir, I desire to say to the members of this honorable body, that when I first entered this Hall I came with decided convictions as to the true policy of our State, in the present emergency; and I am now prepared to state that nothing which has occurred here, nor any developments which have been made elsewhere, have at all changed my previous opinion.\n\nPage 107\n\nI maintain now, as I have maintained before, that separate State secession, if a remedy at all for our political grievances, is not the only remedy--nay, is not the best remedy. And laboring as I do under this conviction, I cannot advocate the adoption of this measure, until I become convinced of my error.\n\nSir, there are a few plain, simple propositions which should claim the serious consideration of every member of this Convention.\n\nFirst--Our grievances should be redressed. This is what we all desire, and only differ in regard to the proper method to be adopted. For one, I have not been able to see that secession is the best mode, and therefore I cannot adopt it.\n\nSecond--All our rights should be secured and maintained. It cannot be denied that our rights and interests have been disregarded and set at nought by many of our sister States. But can we come up to the full measure of duty, and secure all to which we are entitled by the act of secession? I think not; and therefore I cannot adopt it as our true policy.\n\nThird--It is very desirable to have security at home. Will secession give us this? It may, or it may not. And it really appears to me, sir, that in this respect we are about to make a very doubtful experiment, which may lead to a most disastrous result. And as there does not appear, to me, to be any positive necessity for taking this course, now, in justice to myself, and to those whom I represent, I feel called upon to oppose it.\n\nFourth--Our honor should be vindicated. Now, sir, if secession can be shown to be the best means of its vindication, then will be presented at least one powerful argument in favor of this measure. But I must confess, sir, that to my mind, the truth of this proposition has not yet been shown. There is among men a morbid sense of honor which often leads them to extremes, and involves them in disgrace while they vainly seek to maintain their false views of true honor. Against these false views and fatal extremes, it is the part of wisdom for us to be carefully guarded. Entertaining these views of propriety and prudence, I cannot do otherwise, under present circumstances, than withhold my support from a measure whose wisdom and policy are so doubtful.\n\nFifth--We ought to do ourselves justice. Now, it is apparent to me, sir, that the act of secession will cost us such a sacrifice of interest in the public property of the United States, as will do the people of Alabama great injustice. If, sir, this were the only line of policy possible to be pursued, then we should adopt it at once, let it cost what it might; but until we are fully satisfied that no better line of policy can be pursued, we should hesitate to\n\nPage 108\n\nadopt a measure so hazardous in itself, and involving so great a sacrifice.\n\nSixth--We wish to perpetuate Southern institutions. This, sir, is an imperative duty which we owe to ourselves and to posterity. And the great question for us to solve, is this: Will secession secure the perpetuity of these institutions? Sir, I am so well satisfied that there is a better way, a more certain method of securing this object, so desirable, nay, so necessary, that I cannot give my consent to the adoption of this extreme measure.\n\nSeventh--We want harmony among ourselves. This, sir, is of so much importance to our success, that, so far as possible, it ought to be secured. In view of the conflicting opinions now so prevalent, I am unable to see how it is possible to do justice to public sentiment if we now pass this Ordinance, and refuse to refer the action of this Convention to the people of the State for their ratification or rejection. And this, sir, will evidently be the result, if this measure shall be sustained by a majority of this body. For these, and other reasons not mentioned, I am constrained, sir, to act upon the principle that what my judgment condemns my hand shall not indorse. I therefore vote in the negative.\n\nMR. BULGER said:\n\nMr. President--Being as I am among the oldest, as well as the humblest of the members of this Convention, it is perhaps proper that I should be one of the last to speak on this, the most important question that has ever been debated in the State of Alabama. Sir, believing as I do, that separate State secession is unwise and impolitic, and not a remedy for any wrong of which we complain in the Union, I deem it unnecessary for me at this time to attempt an array of reasons that bring me to this conclusion. This I did before the people that sent me here. When we had an exciting contest, I told my friends that secession was a vital issue, that they should consider coolly; that if it was decided against them, it would become their duty to acquiesce; that we were all on board of a common bark--if it foundered and went down, we must all go down together; that we could not, if we would, separate our destiny from those with whom we differed. And now, sir, finding as I do, that secession, immediate and separate, without reference to the people for their ratification or rejection, is a foregone conclusion, and having voted against every proposition leading to that conclusion, except one, on which I was prevented voting by severe indisposition, I will now content myself\n\nPage 109\n\nwith recording my vote against the final act of secession. Havdone so, I will have discharged my whole duty to those whom I represent on this floor. The act of secession having been consummated by the majority of this Convention, whether rightfully or wrongfully, it becomes the action of Alabama; I feel it to be my duty to cease all opposition to that act, and coöperate with the majority, to the best of my ability, in reconstructing a Government adapted to the new state of affairs by which we are surrounded. That done, my first and paramount allegiance is due to the State of Alabama; and if an attempt be made to coerce or invade her, although I am advanced beyond the ordinary age of a soldier, I will seek some humble position in an army of defense, where I can render some service in support of the rights, the interests and the honor of my country.\n\nMR. WINSTON said, in substance:\n\nThat he would say a few words, now that the important measure for which the Convention was called, was about to be disposed of; that he was opposed to the hasty step about to be taken, and should record his vote against it; that the die was cast--it was the determination of the majority of the Convention to pass the Ordinance of Immediate Secession. That being the will of this Convention, the sovereignty of Alabama, sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish, the same destiny awaited all. He represented a constituency opposed to this hasty dissolution of the best Government the world ever knew; they were a brave and patriotic people, and notwithstanding their veneration for the Union of their Fathers, they, he had no doubt, would acquiesce in and sustain their State in this its final determination; and will rally to the standard of Alabama whenever their services shall be needed to repel Black Republican force, should the same ever be employed to subjugate them. He had contended, and so declared by his vote, that this Ordinance about to be passed, should be referred to the people for their approval or rejection, and that an effort should be made, in the Union, to adjust our existing difficulties with the North, by calling a Convention of all the slaveholding States, and proposing as an ultimatum certain concessions to be made by the Northern people, which, if not granted, then to separate. But these had been voted down by the majority of the Convention, and now the Ordinance of Immediate Secession was about to be passed by that same majority, severing the link which binds Alabama to the Federal Union, and no alternative is now left the minority but to acquiesce in that determined act of the\n\nPage 110\n\nmajority. This done, Alabama stands forth as an independent sovereignty--in anticipation of which event, he had written to his son, then a cadet at the military academy at West Point, to resign his position there and return home, that he might unite his destiny with that of his native State--that for nearly two years in that excellent school, the knowledge he had acquired of military tactics might be of some service in the approaching stormy times. He assured gentlemen that whatever glory might attach to this act of precipitation, would belong to the leaders of that movement--to all of which they were most clearly entitled.\n\nIn conclusion, he was then ready to record his vote against it.\n\nMR. DAVIS of Madison, said:\n\nMr. President--I, too, have a word to say upon this occasion. I cannot remain unmoved amid such solemn occurrences. I shall speak briefly and I hope frankly. It cannot be denied that circumstances have greatly changed since this Convention met on last Monday. We have seen State after State, in the exercise of its sovereign powers, withdrawing from the Union in the few past days. Florida has seceded; Mississippi has seceded--each by overwhelming majorities. It is now no longer a serious apprehension that Alabama will stand alone in this movement of secession. It is confidently asserted that Georgia and Louisiana and Texas will follow. Under this aspect of the case, it is not remarkable that a great change has also come over the Convention--a change clearly indicated by the speeches that have been this day delivered in this hall.\n\nI shall vote against the Ordinance. But if Alabama shall need the strong arm of her valorous sons to sustain her in any emergency which, on account of this Ordinance of Secession, may arise within her borders, by which her honor or the rights of her citizens are likely to be endangered, I say for myself and for my constituents--and I dare say for all North Alabama--that I and they will be cheerfully ready to take our part in the conflict. We may not indorse the wisdom of your resolves, but we will stand by the State of Alabama under all circumstances.\n\nMR. YANCEY said:\n\nMr. President--If no other gentleman desires to address the Convention, I will exercise the usual parliamentary privilege accorded to the Chairman of the Committee reporting a measure-- that of closing the debate by assigning a few reasons why the measure before you should be adopted. In common with all others\n\nPage 111\n\nhere, I feel that this is a solemn hour, and I congratulate the Convention that the spirit that prevails is both fraternal and patriotic--that whatever of irritation or suspicion had prevailed in the earlier hours of our session, has been, in a great degree, dissipated, and has given way to a juster appreciation of the motives and the conduct of each other. In the Committee, the majority yielded to the minority all the time that they desired for deliberation; and since the report has been made, the majority in the Convention has also yielded to the wishes of the minority in this respect, and every delegate, who desired to do so, has addressed the Convention in explanation of his vote, and has taken as much time as, in his judgment, was necessary to his purpose. If, in the earlier stages of our proceedings, it has been thought, as it has been said by some gentlemen, that an undue celerity of movement was pressed by the majority, I beg those gentlemen to believe that this conduct on our part was dictated solely by our convictions of duty, and not from any--the least desire to precipitate others into a vote, before they were prepared to give it understandingly. Time was deemed, by the friends of independent State action, to be either success or defeat in the inauguration of this great movement--success, if there was a prompt and unequivocal withdrawal from this Union--or defeat, if time was used to delay and to dishearten. You who were opposed to such action, from a sense of duty, would necessarily be for all such delays as would aid in accomplishing its defeat; we who were for it, from a like sense of duty, were necessarily in favor of a prompt decision of the question. Each has acted, doubtless, upon well-founded ideas of duty. All that was necessary to a better understanding of each other, was a belief in that fact, a belief in the good faith of each other; and I rejoice that to-day has furnished ample evidence that we now mutually entertain that belief; and, on the part of the majority, I return sincere thanks to the venerable delegate from Lauderdale, [MR. POSEY,] who, though compelled to vote against this Ordinance, yet has characterized the conduct of the majority in this matter, as giving evidence of \"wisdom, discretion, and a spirit of conciliation.\"\n\nAs to the measure itself, [the Ordinance and Resolutions,] whatever of merit it possesses, is the result of consultation between the majority and minority of the Committee. I am sure that the members of that Committee will indulge me in alluding to what passed in its sessions. The majority decidedly preferred to adopt a simple Ordinance of Secession. But determined, for the sake of harmony, to do all in their power to disarm prejudice, and to bring about a fraternal feeling, they did not hesitate to yield their\n\nPage 112\n\nown cherished desire in this particular, when my friend from Madison [Mr. Clemens] proposed to amend our proposed Ordinance by adding thereto the preamble and resolutions, which form a part of his report. It is well known that some of the people have been led to believe that the friends of secession desired to erect Alabama either into a monarchy, or into an independent State, repudiating an alliance with other States. As for myself, I can truly declare that I have never met with any friend of secession, entertaining such views. The proposition submitted by my friend from Madison, [Mr. Clemens,] being in perfect accordance with the wishes and desires of the majority, and amply refuting these misconceptions, the one which we would have preferred to have voted upon separately, was at once agreed to, and the result is, the measure now before us for consideration.\n\nOn the first day of our session a resolution was unanimously adopted, declaring that the people of this State would resist the administration of Lincoln for the causes and upon the principles there enunciated. On the question of resistance, then, there is no difference in this Body--all are for resistance. But there is a difference between members as to the mode, the manner of resistance. Some believe that when the rights of our people are denied or assailed by the parties to the Federal compact, or by the Federal Government, that secession from this compact is the rightful remedy. Others believe that secession is wrong, and that the remedy is revolution. A careful reading of the Ordinance on your table will show, that the resistance therein provided may be called revolution, disunion, or secession, as each member may desire. The caption styles it \"an Ordinance to dissolve the Union,\" &c. In the body of the Ordinance, the people of the State are \"withdrawn from the compact,\" &c. It is true, that the mode of resistance is organic; it is an organic coöperation, not of States, but of the people of this State in resistance to wrong. In this respect it harmonizes differences. Another difference, both in the popular mind and in that of delegates, is, that resistance should be by coöperation of States, and not by independent State action. That difference has been harmonized by the conjunction of the Ordinance and Resolutions, as reported by the Committee. Coöperation and separate State action, as far as they can be effected, under our obligation to the Federal compact and in harmony with the principles of State sovereignty, have been joined in this measure. It is true, there are a class of coöperationists, whose views are not met by this measure--those who have advocated coöperation to secure submission--to defeat resistance. But there are none of that character here. While the friends of independent\n\nPage 113\n\nState action in this Ordinance do obtain a declaration as to the rights of the people of Alabama; and as to our determination to sustain them, the friends of coöperation, for the purpose of effectual resistance, also obtain a declaration of our desire and purpose to unite with all of the slaveholding States who entertain a like purpose, in confederated or co&omacr;perative resistance, and in a confederated government upon the principles of the Federal Constitution.\n\nAs far as it was possible, then, to do so, without yielding principles, the friends of resistance have used every reasonable effort to meet on a common ground. And I rejoice in the belief that the effort has been successful, and that there will be a far greater unanimity manifested when the vote shall be taken on this measure, than was even hoped for, when we first met in this Hall-- From the remarks of gentlemen to-day, many will be compelled to vote against this measure by reason of instructions of their people, who otherwise would vote for it. I sincerely respect these motives, and think that those occupying such positions act correctly in their premises.\n\nMr. President, we are fortunate in having the example of our Revolutionaay fathers sustaining the plan of action here proposed --separate State action and then coöperation in confederating together. South Carolina, after several months deliberation, with a view to resisting British aggression, formed a State government early in the year 1776. Virginia did so in June, 1776, declaring her separate and independent secession from the Government of Great Britain. Afterwards, on the 4th of July, 1776, the Congress of the United States agreed upon and adopted a joint Declaration of Independence. It was after the colonies had acted separately and independently, that both the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution of the United States were severally adopted.\n\nThe friends of independent State action have also cause to congratulate themselves, that as far as the people of the Southern States have spoken, they have unanimously expressed themselves in favor of independent State action.\n\nSouth Carolina, Mississippi, and Florida, have each already acted independently. In this Convention a majority are known to be in favor of that kind of action. We have already received information that a majority of delegates in favor of such action has been elected, both in Georgia and Louisiana. I commend this significant fact to all who feel disposed to condemn an independent State movement.\n\nSome have been disposed to think that this is a movement of\n\nPage 114\n\npoliticians, and not of the people. This is a great error. Who, on a calm review of the past, and reflection upon what is daily occurring, can reasonably suppose that the people of South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana who have already elected conventions favorable to dissolution, and the people of Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia were contemplating an assembling in their several conventions, have been mere puppets in the hands of politicians? Who can for a moment thus deliberately determine that all these people, in these various States, who are so attached to their government, have so little intelligence that they can be thus blindly driven into revolution, without cause, by designing and evil minded men, against the remonstrances of conservative men? No, sir! This is a great popular movement, based upon a wide-spread, deep-seated conviction that the forms of government have fallen into the hands of a sectional majority, determined to use them for the destruction of the rights of the people of the South. This mighty flood-tide has been flowing from the popular heart for years. You, gentlemen of the minority, have not been able to repress it. We of the majority have not been able to add a particle to its momentum. We are each and all driven forward upon this irresistible tide. The rod that has smitten the rock from which this flood flows, has not been in Southern hands. The rod has been Northern and sectional aggression and wrong, and that flood-tide has grown stronger and stronger as days and years have passed away, in proportion as the people have lost all hope of a constitutional and satisfactory solution of these vexed questions. In this connection, I would say a few words upon the proposition to submit the Ordinance of Dissolution to a popular vote. This proposition is based upon the idea that there is a difference between the people and the delegate. It seems to me that this is an error. There is a difference between the representatives of the people in the law-making body and the people themselves, because there are powers reserved to the people by the Convention of Alabama, and which the General Assembly cannot exercise. But in this body is all power--no powers are reserved from it. The people are here in the persons of their deputies. Life, Liberty and Property are in our hands. Look to the Ordinance adopting the Constitution of Alabama. It states \"we the people of Alabama,\" &c., &c. All our acts are supreme, without ratification, because they are the acts of the people acting in their sovereign capacity. As a policy, submission of this Ordinance to a popular vote is wrong.\n\nIn the first place, we have gone too far to recede with dignity and self-respect. Such a submission involves delay dangerous to our safety. It could not well be effected before the 4th of March.\n\nPage 115\n\nThe policy is at war with our system of government. Ours is not a pure Democracy--that is a government by the people--though it is a government of the people. Ours is a representative government, and whatever is done by the representative in accordance with the Constitution is law; and whatever is done by the deputy in organizing government is the people's will.\n\nThe policy, too, is one of recent suggestion; if I am not mistaken, it was never proposed and acted upon previous to 1837. Certainly the Fathers did not approve it. The Constitutions of the original Thirteen States were adopted by Conventions, and were never referred"
