        "text": "Lot 5 of the Ylang Ylang Absolute is a real disappointment. First, the technical: In a straight 10% dilution, about 20-50% of the solute weight seems to be waxes or other non-soluble materials. For an absolute, I would characterize this as very poor quality, despite the varying literature out there on ylang ylang oil's sometimes persnickety temperament to dissolve. If I'm buying an absolute which is one-fifth to one-half insoluble, I don't think it deserves to be characterized as a well-made or high-quality absolute, let alone an absolute. Second, quality: In comparison to previous purchases of Ylang Absolute from Eden — in particular Lot 3, which was this brilliant peridot-green, breathlessly floral marvel — I would characterize the odor profile of Lot 5 as noticeably weak, dull, and piercing with methyl salicylate. Lot 5 does have a nice creamy element, but in terms of tenacity, strength, and character, it's quite disappointing and banal. Yes: harvests and productions change from year to year and supplier to supplier. This does not change my impression, though, that quality should have been gauged before making new lots for sale. To Eden's credit, as I am sure they will note before approving this comment, they have been in communication with me about this for the past two months; the notes cited from Guenther have since been added to this page after my communication to them. Nevertheless, having successfully diluted previous Ylang Absolutes to 10% with negligible dissolute material (e.g. Lot 3), the amount in Lot 5 really causes concern. Absolutes, by definition, are supposed to be fully soluble in alcohol. In commercial practice that might not always be the case, but in this instance, it is gravely far beyond the mean of what would constitute as a well-made, properly alcohol-washed absolute.\n\nReview by CR 1/17/2018"
