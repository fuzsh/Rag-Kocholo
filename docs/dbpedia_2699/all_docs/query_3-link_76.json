        "text": "This is the best ylang ylang i have ever tried up to now..gorgeous material..so sweet and feminine.. when i sniff it is just like i quench my thirst..amazingly good material for rose bouquet and for more heavy floral but i could not say i wouldn’t use it with amber resin notes to give it an incensy twist\n\nCharalambos\n\nIf you only ever have one ylang then this is the one! I purchased early 2019. It’s one of the few oils I keep to myself as it’s so precious to me and rare – out of all the ylangs I have and which I love all in different ways this is the ultimate.\n\nI seriously have to go and hide to a quiet space and sniff – as if sniffing is contraband! It’s like the most comforting breath / sigh.. I wore it to a yoga class and in shivasana (the bit where you lie at the end) it was a beautiful blanket of blossom kissing the window of my soul. I could have slept forever with it’s complex and subtle bouquet tickling my nose.\n\nIf you have any anxiety this will help you catch your breath and restore energy whilst you drink in it’s utter joy! I am in love!\n\nIt’s four stars because I was expecting something else than the typical ylang ylang essential oil scent. To me though it’s pretty much the same, only so much stronger! Use it sparingly case it will easily overpower almost anything. Very helpful though in creations where you would otherwise need a lot of oil because it’s so strong. I hoped ot would be sweeter, but that was just my expectation. All in all I am happy to have bought a bottle of ylang that will last me a long time. I wonder how it will age and if some extra complexities will emerge, or perhaps some aspects will mellow. I will wait a little while before using this one to see what it will become.\n\nI’ll be honest, I am not a fan (and still not quite a fan) of ylang. This is no reflection on the absolute itself, as a matter of fact this material is the finest I have tried, It’s just the Ylang profile itself I’m having difficulty enjoying. I use it in traces to add realism and narcotic-like effects. Maybe one day I’ll like it enough to showcase as a centerpiece within a fragrance, until then this is my secret additive to some floral recreations."
