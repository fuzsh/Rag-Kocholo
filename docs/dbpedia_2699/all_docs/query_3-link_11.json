        "text": "Just one sniff and you'll fall in love. This works so great with Franks. Thinking about blending it with mugwort.\n\nI've been experimenting with a dozen different myrrh essential oils and resins to use for incense. This is the most wonderful smelling myrrh I've found.\n\nNotice that this is not your standard myrrh variety. Sweet myrrh comes from a different species of tree. It is still myrrh. So look forward to being pleasantly surprised.\n\nHas a lovely smell. Was recommended to me for pain as I cannot diffuse Wintergreen or Birch. Miracle Botanicals’ version is a bit less viscous than others and it’s great in my diffuser. Also good for skin topically.\n\nI trust Miracle Botanicals quality and service. This is the best price per volume of among the EO retailers I frequent - and there is no shipping charge. Thanks."
