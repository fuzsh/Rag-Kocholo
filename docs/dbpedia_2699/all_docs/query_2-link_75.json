This disclosure is premised, in part, on the unexpected finding that chimeric terpene synthases comprising a portion of a terpene synthase sequence from at least one rare or extinct plant can be leveraged to produce a diversity of sesquiterpenes. Accordingly, provided herein are chimeric terpene synthases, methods for making chimeric terpene synthases, and methods for making terpenes using the described chimeric terpene synthases. In some embodiments, the chimeric terpene synthases are chimeric sesquiterpene synthases.\n\nThis invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the description. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways. Additionally, the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of terms such asâincluding,ââcomprising,ââhaving,â\n\nâcontaining,ââinvolving,â and/or variations thereof herein, is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items.\n\nChimeric Terpene Synthases\n\nAspects of the present disclosure relate to chimeric terpene synthases comprising fragments (e.g., sequences) from at least two terpene synthases, wherein at least one of the two or more terpene synthases is from a rare or extinct plant. For example, the sequence of a chimeric terpene synthase may comprise one or more fragments (e.g., one or more portions of the total sequence) from at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, at least six, at least seven, at least eight, at least nine or at least ten terpene synthases. It should be appreciated that chimeric terpene synthases described herein can be synthetic. Accordingly, chimeric terpene synthases, including synthetic chimeric terpene synthases, described herein comprise sequences derived from more than one terpene synthase, wherein at least one of the terpene synthases is from a rare or extinct plant. In some embodiments, the chimeric terpene synthases are chimeric sesquiterpene synthases.\n\nTerpene synthases are enzymes that catalyze the formation of terpenes from isoprenoid diphosphate substrates. At least two types of terpene synthases have been characterized: classic terpene synthases and isoprenyl diphosphate synthase-type terpene synthases. Classic terpene synthases are found in prokaryotes (e.g., bacteria) and in eukaryotes (e.g., plants, fungi and amoebae), while isoprenyl diphosphate synthase-type terpene synthases have been found in insects (see, e.g., Chen et al, Terpene synthase genes in eukaryotes beyond plants and fungi: Occurrence in social amoebae. Proc Natl Acad Sci U SA. 2016; 113(43): 12132- 12137, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for this purpose). Several highly conserved structural motifs have been reported in classic terpene synthases, including an aspartate-rich âDDxx(x)D/Eâ motif and aâNDxxSxxxD/Eâ(SEQ ID NO: 55) motif, which have both been implicated in coordinating substrate binding (see, e.g., Starks et al, Structural basis for cyclic terpene biosynthesis by tobacco 5-epi-aristolochene synthase. Science. 1997 Sep\n\n19;277(5333):1815-20; and Christianson et al, Unearthing the roots of the terpenome. Curr Opin Chem Biol. 2008 Apr;l2(2):l4l-50, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for this purpose).\n\nTerpene synthases may be classified by the type of terpenes they produce. As used herein, unless otherwise indicated, terpenes are organic compounds comprising isoprene ( i.e ., CsHs) units and derivatives thereof. For example, terpenes include pure hydrocarbons with the molecular formula (CsH8)n, in which n represents the number of isoprene subunits. Terpenes also include oxygenated compounds (often referred to as terpenoids). Terpenes are structurally diverse compounds and, for example, may be cyclic (e.g., monocyclic, multi-cyclic, homocyclic and heterocyclic compounds) or acyclic (e.g., linear and branched compounds). In some embodiments, a terpene may have an odor. As used herein, an aroma compound refers to a compound that has an odor. Any methods known in the art, including mass spectrometry (e.g., gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS, shown in Example 2 below), may be used to identify a terpene of interest. Terpene synthases may include, for example, monoterpene synthases, diterpene synthases, and sesquiterpene synthases. Certain non-limiting examples of monoterpene synthases and sesquiterpene synthases may be found, for example, in Degenhardt el al. ,\n\nMonoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases and the origin of terpene skeletal diversity in plants. Phytochemistry . 2009 Oct-Nov;70(l5-l6): 1621-37, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for this purpose.\n\nMonoterpene synthases catalyze the formation of lO-carbon monoterpenes. Generally, monoterpene synthases use geranyl diphosphate (GPP) as a substrate. Non-limiting examples of monoterpene synthases include Myrcene synthase (UniProtKb Identifier: 024474), (R)-limonene synthase (UniprotKB Identifier: Q2XSC6), (E)-beta-ocimene synthase (UniProtKB Identifier: Q5CD81) and Limonene synthase (UniProtKB Identifier: Q9FV72). Non-limiting examples of monoterpenes include, but are not limited to, limonene, sabinene, thujene, carene, borneol, eucalyptol and camphene.\n\nDiterpene synthases promote the formation of 20-carbon diterpenes. Generally, diterpene synthases use geranylgeranyl diphosphate as a substrate. Non-limiting examples of diterpene synthases include cis-abienol synthase (UniProtKB identifier: H8ZM73), sclareol synthase (UniProtKB identifier: K4HYB0) and abietadiene synthase (Q38710). See, e.g., Gong et al, Diterpene synthases and their responsible cyclic natural products. Nat Prod Bioprospect.\n\n20l4;4(2):59-72, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for this purpose. Non limiting examples of diterpenes include, but are not limited to, cembrene and sclareol.\n\nSesquiterpene synthases catalyze the formation of l5-carbon sesquiterpenes. Generally, sesquiterpene synthases convert farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) into sesquiterpenes. Non-limiting examples of sesquiterpene synthases include (-i-)-delta-cadinene synthase (UniProtKB Identifier: Q9SAN0), UniProtKB Identifier: A0A067FTE8, Beta-eudesmol synthase (UniProtKB Identifier: B1B1U4), (+)-delta-cadinene synthase isozyme XC14 (UniProtKB Identifier: Q39760), (+)- delta-cadinene synthase isozyme XC1 (UniProtKB Identifier: Q39761), (+)-delta-cadinene synthase isozyme A (UniProtKB Identifier: Q43714), Sesquiterpene synthase 2 (UniProtKB Identifier: Q9FQ26), Putative delta-guaiene synthase (UniProtKB Identifier: A0A0A0QFTT9), Delta-guaiene synthase 1 (UniProtKB Identifier: D0VMR6), Alpha-zingiberene synthase (UniProtKB Identifier: Q5SBP4), (Z)-gamma-bisabolene synthase 1 (UniProtKB Identifier: Q9T0J9), A0A067D5M4, Delta-elemene synthase (UniProtKB Identifier: A0A097ZIE0), ShoBecSQTSl, A0A068UHT0, terpene synthase (UniProtKB Identifier: G5CV47), A0A068VE40 and A0A068VI46.\n\nIn some embodiments, a sesquiterpene synthase is an alpha-guaiene synthase. As used herein, an alpha-guaiene synthase is capable of catalyzing the formation of alpha-guaiene. In some embodiments, an alpha-guaiene synthase uses (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate as a substrate. Non-limiting examples of alpha-guaiene synthases include UniProtKB Identifier: D0VMR6, UniProtKB Identifier: D0VMR7, UniProtKB Identifier: D0VMR8, UniProtKB Identifier:\n\nQ49SP3. As disclosed herein, an alpha-guaiene synthase may comprise a sequence that is at least 50% (e.g., at least 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more than 99%, including all values in between) identical to SEQ ID NO: 17, 22, or 29. In certain embodiments, an alpha-guaiene synthase comprises SEQ ID NO: 17, 22, or 29. In certain embodiments an alpha-guaiene synthase consists of SEQ ID NO: 17, 22, or 29.\n\nAs used herein, unless otherwise indicated, sesquiterpenes include sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and sesquiterpene alcohols (sesquiterpenols). Non-limiting examples of sesquiterpenes include but are not limited to, delta-cadinene, epi-cubenol, tau-cadinol, alpha- cadinol, gamma-selinene, lO-epi-gamma-eudesmol, gamma-eudesmol, alpha/beta-eudesmol, juniper camphor, 7-epi-alpha-eudesmol, cryptomeridiol isomer 1, cryptomeridiol isomer 2, cryptomeridiol isomer 3, humulene, alpha-guaiene, delta- guaiene, zingiberene, beta-bisabolene, beta-farnesene, beta-sesquiphellandrene, cubenol, alpha-bisabolol, alpha-curcumene, trans- nerolidol, gamma, bisabolene, beta-caryophyllene, trans-Sesquisabinene hydrate, delta-elemene, cis-eudesm-6-en-l l-ol, daucene, isodaucene, trans-bergamotene, alpha- zingiberene,\n\nsesquisabinene hydrate, and 8-Isopropenyl-l, 5-dimethyl- l,5-cyclodecadiene.\n\nThe present disclosure also encompasses chimeric terpene synthases that are multi functional (e.g., capable of producing more than one sesquiterpene). In some embodiments, a chimeric terpene synthase is capable of producing delta-cadinene and alpha-cadinol. In some embodiments, a chimeric terpene synthase is capable of producing delta-cadinene, tau-cadinol, and alpha-cadinol. In some embodiments, a chimeric terpene synthase is capable of producing alpha-guaiene and delta-guaiene. In some embodiments, the chimeric terpene synthase is capable of producing beta-caryophyllene and humulene. In some embodiments, a chimeric terpene synthase ( e.g ., a chimeric sesquiterpene synthase) of the present disclosure comprises an amino sequence at least 50% (e.g., at least 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more than 99%, including all values in between) identical to a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1-52. In some embodiments, the chimeric terpene synthase comprises an amino acid sequence provided in SEQ ID NOs: 1-52.\n\nIn some embodiments, a chimeric terpene synthase comprises one or more sequences provided in SEQ ID NOs: 119-357.\n\nThe termâsequence identity,â as known in the art, refers to a relationship between the sequences of two polypeptides or polynucleotides, as determined by sequence comparison (alignment). In the art, identity also means the degree of sequence relatedness between two sequences as determined by the number of matches between strings of two or more residues (e.g., nucleic acid or amino acid residues). Identity measures the percent of identical matches between the smaller of two or more sequences with gap alignments (if any) addressed by a particular mathematical model or computer program (e.g.,âalgorithmsâ).\n\nIdentity of related polypeptides can be readily calculated by any of the methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Theâpercent identityâ of two sequences (e.g., nucleic acid or amino acid sequences) may, for example, be determined using the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:2264-68, 1990, modified as in Karlin and Altschul Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-77, 1993. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLASTÂ® and XBLASTÂ® programs (version 2.0) of Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-10, 1990.\n\nBLASTÂ® protein searches can be performed, for example, with the XBLAST program, score=50, wordlength=3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to the protein molecules of the invention. Where gaps exist between two sequences, Gapped BLASTÂ® can be utilized, for example, as described in Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 25(l7):3389-3402, 1997. When utilizing BLASTÂ® and Gapped BLASTÂ® programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLASTÂ® and NBLASTÂ®) can be used, or the parameters can be adjusted appropriately as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\nAnother local alignment technique which may be used, for example, is based on the Smith- Waterman algorithm (Smith, T.L. & Waterman, M.S. (1981)âIdentification of common molecular subsequences.â J. Mol. Biol. 147:195-197). A general global alignment technique which may be used, for example, is the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman, S.B. & Wunsch, C.D. (1970)âA general method applicable to the search for similarities in the amino acid sequences of two proteins.â J. Mol. Biol. 48:443-453), which is based on dynamic programming. More recently, a Fast Optimal Global Sequence Alignment Algorithm\n\n(FOGSAA) was developed that purportedly produces global alignment of nucleic acid and amino acid sequences faster than other optimal global alignment methods, including the Needleman- Wunsch algorithm.\n\nThe present disclosure also encompasses compositions comprising one or more terpenes ( e.g ., sesquiterpenes) produced by any one of the chimeric terpene synthases (e.g., sesquiterpene synthases) described herein. In some embodiments, the composition comprises at least one terpene (e.g., sesquiterpene) that is an aroma compound. In some embodiments, the composition is a perfume (e.g., comprising a single fragrance or a mixture of fragrances). In some embodiments, the composition further comprises a fixative (i.e., stabilizer) to reduce volatility of the composition. Non-limiting examples include fixatives include resinoids (e.g., benzoin, olibanum, storax, labdanum, myrrh and tolu balsam) and benzyl benzoate. In some\n\nembodiments, the composition further comprises ethyl alcohol. In some embodiments, the composition further comprises distilled water.\n\nIn certain embodiments, a terpene synthase (e.g., sesquiterpene synthase) of the present disclosure produces a terpene (e.g., sesquiterpene) composition that comprises at least 1%, at least 2%, at least 3%, at least 4%, at least 5%, at least 6%, at least 7%, at least 8%, at least 9%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or 100% including any values in between of a particular terpene, such as a sesquiterpene. Non-limiting examples of sesquiterpenes include delta-cadinene, epi-cubenol, tau-cadinol, alpha-cadinol, gamma-selinene, lO-epi-gamma- eudesmol, gamma-eudesmol, alpha/beta-eudesmol, juniper camphor, 7-epi-alpha-eudesmol, cryptomeridiol isomer 1, cryptomeridiol isomer 2, cryptomeridiol isomer 3, humulene, alpha- guaiene, delta-guaiene, zingiberene, beta-bisabolene, beta-famesene, beta-sesquiphellandrene, cubenol, alpha-bisabolol, alpha-curcumene, trans-nerolidol, gamma, bisabolene, beta- caryophyllene, trans-Sesquisabinene hydrate, delta-elemene, cis-eudesm-6-en-l l-ol, daucene, isodaucene, trans-bergamotene, alpha-zingiberene, sesquisabinene hydrate, and 8-Isopropenyl- 1, 5-dimethyl- l,5-cyclodecadiene. As a non-limiting example, a terpene synthase may be heterologously expressed in a host cell, the sesquiterpenes produced by the recombinant host cell may be extracted, and the types of sesquiterpenes in the composition may be determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In some embodiments, a terpene synthase may be recombinantly expressed and is purified. In some embodiments, the sesquiterpenes produced by a purified terpene synthase may be extracted and the types of sesquiterpenes in the composition may be determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.\n\nIn certain embodiments, an alpha-guaiene synthase is capable of producing a\n\nsesquiterpene composition that comprises at least 1%, at least 2%, at least 3%, at least 4%, at least 5%, at least 6%, at least 7%, at least 8%, at least 9%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or 100% including any values in between of alpha-guaiene. In some embodiments, an alpha-guaiene synthase is capable of producing a sesquiterpene composition that comprises between 1% to 10%, between 5% to 20%, between 15% to 20%, between 16% and 20%, between 17% and 20%, between 18% and 20%, between 19% and 20%, between 20% and 25%, between 20% and 24%, between 20% and 23%, between 20% and 22%, between 20% and 21%, between 20% and 30%, between 30% and 40%, between 40% and 50%, between 50% and 60%, between 60% and 70%, between 70% and 80% , between 80% and 90%, or between 90% and 100%, including any values in between alpha-guaiene.\n\nRare and extinct plants\n\nAt least one portion of the sequence of the chimeric terpene synthases disclosed herein is derived from a rare or extinct plant. As used herein, the termârare plantâ orârare plantsâ encompasses plants that are uncommon, scarce, infrequently encountered, endangered (e.g., threatened), vulnerable, only available in private collections, not found in the endemic location, only available in cultivation, and/or extinct. In some embodiments, a rare plant is a plant that is infrequently encountered (e.g., only encountered in a few locations such as 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 locations). In some embodiments, a rare plant is an extinct plant. As used herein, an extinct plant refers to a species of plant: having no living members; classified as having no living members; or predicted by one of ordinary skill in the art to have no living members. As a non limiting example, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red list of Threatened Species may be used to determine the conservation status of a plant and identify rare plants. For example, plants classified as extinct, extinct in the wild, critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable, and near threatened on the IUCN Red List may be considered rare plants.\n\nNon-limiting examples of rare plants include Leucadendron grandiflorum, Shorea cuspidata, Macrostylis villosa, Orbexilum stipulatum, Myrcia skeldingii, Nesiota Elliptica, Macrostylis villosa, Wendlandia angustofola, Erica Pyramidalis, Stenocarpus dumbeenis, Pradosia glaziovii, Crassula subulata, Hibiscadelphus wilderianus, and Erica foliacea.\n\nIn some embodiments, the rare plant may be Hibiscadelphus wilderianus. The\n\nHibiscadelphus genus belongs to the tribe Hibisceae (Malvaceae) and members of the genus often have petals that form a tubular structure in which the lower petals are often shorter than the upper three petals (see, e.g., Oppenheimer el al, A new species of Hibiscadelphus Rock\n\n(Malvaceae, Hibisceae) from Maui, Hawaiian Islands; PhytoKeys, 20l4;(39):65-75, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). The Hibiscadelphus genus is endemic to Hawaii and at least eight species have been described. Four of these species are extinct\n\n(including Hibiscadelphus bombycinus, Hibiscadelphus crucibracteatus, Hibiscadelphus wilderianus, and Hibiscadelphus woodii ), two of these species only persist in cultivation\n\n( Hibiscadelphus giffardianus and Hibiscadelphus hualalaiensis ), and two are extant in the wild ( Hibiscadelphus distans and Hibiscadelphus stellatus).\n\nHibiscadelphus wilderianus is an extinct tree species last observed at an elevation of 2,600 feet in 1910 on the lava fields of Auwahi on the island of Maui in Hawaii (see, e.g., Radlkofer et al, New and Noteworthy Hawaiian Plants; Hawaiian Board of Agriculture and Forestry Botanical Bulletin, 1911 ;(l): 1- 15;âThe IUCN Red List of Threatened Species:\n\nHibiscadelphus wilderianus,â World Conservation Monitoring Centre, 1998, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). A description in Latin of Hibiscadelphus wilderianus can be found in the Radlkofer et al. original report. A photo of a tree branch with leaves and fruit was included in the original Radlkofer et al. report and is reproduced in FIG. 8A.\n\nIn some embodiments, the rare plant may be Leucadendron grandiflorum. Leucadendron is a dioecious genus that belongs to the Proteaceae family and is endemic to South Africa.\n\nSpecies in the Leucadendron genus include evergreen shrubs and often have cone-shaped infructescences (seed heads). There are at least 80 species in the Leucadendron genus including L. album, L. arcuatum, L. argenteum, L. barkerae, L. bonum, L. brunioides, L. burchellii, L. cadens, L. chamelaea, L. cinereum, L. comosum, L. concavum, L. conicum, L. coniferum, L. cordatum, L. coriaceum, L. corymbosum, L. cryptocephalum, L. daphnoides, L. diemontianum,\n\nL. discolor, L. dregei, L. dubium, L. elimense, L. ericifolium, L. eucalyptifolium, L. flexuosum, L. floridum, L. foedum, L. galpinii, L. gandogeri, L. glaberrimum, L. globosum, L. grandiflorum, L. gydoense, L. immoderatum, L. lanigerum, L. laureolum, L. laxum, L. levisanus, L. linifolium, L. loeriense, L. loranthifolium, L. macowanii, L. meridianum, L. meyerianum, L. microcephalum, L. modestum, L. muirii, L. nervosum, L. nitidum, L. nobile, L. olens, L. orientale, L. osbornei, L. platyspermum, L. pondoense, L. procerum, L. pubescens, L. pubibracteolatum, L. radiatum, L. remotum, L. roodii, L. rourkei, L. rubrum, L. salicifolium, L. salignum, L. sericeum, L. sessile, L. sheilae, L. singular, L. sorocephalodes, L. spirale, L. spissifolium, L. stellare, L. stelligerum, L. strobilinum, L. teretifolium, L. thymifolium, L. tinctum, L. tradouwense, L. uliginosum, L.\n\nverticillatum, and L. xanthoconus.\n\nLeucadendron grandiflorum is also known commonly as Wynberg Conebush and was last observed in 1806 in Clapham, South Africa. Recorded sightings of Leucadendron grandiflorum have occurred on Wynberg Mountain and this species may have existed on the south slopes of Wynberg hill on moister granite soils (see, e.g., T. Rebelo,âWynberg Conebush - extinct for 200 years,â iSpot, 25 July 2015, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Leucadendron grandiflorum has been described and depicted in Salisbury et al, The Paradisus Londinensis or Coloured Figures of Plants Cultivated in the Vicinity of the Metropolis. 1805; (Volume 1, part 2): 105; see www -dot- biodiversitylibrary.org-backslash- ia/mobot31753000575 l72#page/248/mode/lup, the contents of each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. No modem collections of Leucadendron grandiflorum have been recorded, and it is considered that this species was likely scarce or extinct by the early l800s (see, e.g., T. Rebelo,âWynberg Conebush - extinct for 200 years,â iSpot, 25 July 2015; Catalogue of Life: Leucadendron grandiflorum (Salisb.) R. Br., 20 December 2017). Sister species include L. globosum and L. elimense. FIG. 8B depicts Leucadendron grandiflorum.\n\nIn some embodiments, the rare plant may be Macrostylis villosa. The Macrostylis genus belongs to the Rutaceae family and includes at least ten species (e.g., Macrostylis barbigera, Macrostylis cassiopoides, Macrostylis cauliflora, Macrostylis crassifolia, Macrostylis decipiens, Macrostylis hirta, Macrostylis ramulosa, Macrostylis squarrosa, Macrostylis tenuis, and\n\nMacrostylis villosa).\n\nThere are two recognized subspecies of Macrostylis villosa , M. villosa (Thunb.) Sond. subsp. minor and M. villosa (Thunb.) Sond. subsp. villosa. M. villosa (Thunb.) Sond. subsp. minor is classified as extinct as its habitat was converted to agriculture and extensive searches have failed to relocate surviving plants. It was previously found on the Western Cape in South Africa and inhabited gravel and clay soil on slopes (see, e.g.,âRed List of South African Plants: Macrostylis villosa subsp. minor,â 2005, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). M. villosa (Thunb.) Sond. subsp. villosa is considered endangered due to population loss from urban expansion, foreign plant invasions and conversion of habitat to agriculture. A picture of M. villosa (Thunb.) Sond. subsp. villosa is reproduced in FIG. 8C (see, e.g.,âRed List of South African Plants: Macrostylis villosa subsp. villosa,â 2007, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).\n\nIn some embodiments, the rare plant may be Orbexilum stipulatum (Psoralea stipulata). Orbexilum belongs to the Fabaceae family and members of this genus often have characteristic pod walls that are rugose and free from hair. Orbexilum also may be distinguished by its âscarcely accrescent calyxâ (see, e.g., Turner, Revision of the genus Orbexilum (Fabaceae:\n\nPsoraleeae). Lundellia. 2008; (11): 1-7, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Orbexilum species include O. chiapasanum, O. gracile, O. lupinellum, O. macrophyllum, O. melanocarpum, O. oliganthum, O. onobrychis, O. pedunculatum, O. simplex, O. stipulatum, and O. virgatum.\n\nO. stipulatum, also known as theâLargestipule Leather-rootâ or as theâFalls-of-the- Ohio Scurfpeaâ was only found on Rock Island in Kentucky. The last recorded observation of O. stipulatum was in 1881, prior to resurfacing and flooding of this island. Despite many searches of similar habitats, including intensive searches in 1998, on both the Kentucky and Indiana shores of the Ohio River, this species has not been relocated. Therefore, this species has been classified as extinct (see, e.g., NatureServe Explorer: Orbexilum stipulatum - (Torr. &\n\nGray) Rydb., 2016 and Baskin el al. described above, which is each hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).\n\nO. stipulatum was a perennial herb and had leaves that were divided into 3 leaflets, each about 2 cm in length. The species had a persistent appendage at the base of the leaves and was also described as having a corolla tube that did not extend beyond the calyx. It is likely that this plant bloomed in late May to mid-June, but seeds have not been observed in nature (see e.g., âNatureServe Explorer: Orbexilum stipulatum - (Torr. & Gray) Rydb.,â 2016; and Raskin el al, Geographical origin of the specimens of Orbexilum stipulatum (T. & G.) Rydb. (Psoralea stipulata T. & G.). Castanea. 1986;(51): 207-210, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). A picture of O. stipulatum may be found in Short,âOrbexilum stipulatum collected at Falls of the Ohio,â 1840 from The Philadelphia Herbarium at the\n\nAcademy of Natural Sciences is reproduced in FIG. 8D.\n\nIn some embodiments, the rare plant may be Shorea cuspidata. Shorea is a genus in the Dipterocarpaceae family and includes many rainforest trees endemic to southeast Asia.\n\nMany Shorea species are angiosperms (flowering plants). Non-limiting examples of Shorea species may include Shorea affinis, Shorea congestiflora, Shorea cordifolia, Shorea disticha, Shorea megistophylla, Shorea trapezifolia, Shorea zeylanica, Shorea acuminatissima, Shorea alutacea, Shorea angustifolia, Shorea bakoensis, Shorea balanocarpoides, Shorea chaiana, Shorea collaris, Shorea cuspidata, Shorea faguetiana, Shorea faguetioides, Shorea gibbosa, Shorea hopeifolia, Shorea iliasii, Shorea induplicata, Shorea kudatensis, Shorea laxa, Shorea longiflora, Shorea longisperma, Shorea macrobalanos, Shorea mujongensis, Shorea multiflora, Shorea obovoidea, Shorea patoiensis, Shorea peltata, Shorea polyandra, Shorea richetia, Shorea subcylindrica, Shorea tenuiramulosa, and Shorea xanthophylla.\n\nS. cuspidata is a tree endemic to Malaysia that is currently classified as extinct on the IFTCN Red Fist (âThe IUCN Red Fist: Shorea cuspidata,â 1998, which is incorporated in its entirety by reference), although there have been a few recorded sightings of S. cuspidata subsequent to this classification in Bako National Park, Fambir National Park, and the\n\nSemenggoh Arboretum (Ashton, Shorea cuspidata.

In some embodiments, at least 10% (e.g., at least 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%,\n\n19%, 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, 25%, 26%, 27%, 28%, 29%, 30%, 31%, 32%, 33%, 34%, 35%, 36%, 37%, 38%, 39%, 40%, 41%, 42%, 43%, 44%, 45%, 46%, 47%, 48%, 49%, 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or more than 99%, including all values in between) of the nucleic acid molecule encoding such a chimeric terpene synthase may be derived from a rare or extinct plant.\n\nIn some instances, a nucleic acid molecule encoding a chimeric terpene synthase comprises a nucleotide sequence that is at least 50% (e.g., at least 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more than 99%, including all values in between) identical to a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 67-118. In some instances, a nucleic acid molecule encoding a chimeric terpene synthase comprises a nucleotide sequence that is identical to a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 67-118. In some instances, a nucleic acid molecule encoding a chimeric terpene synthase further comprises the nucleotide sequence TATA (TATA box sequence).

In some instances, a nucleic acid molecule encoding a chimeric terpene synthase comprises a nucleotide sequence that encodes for a sequence set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 119-357.\n\nIn some embodiments, at least 10% (e.g., at least 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, 25%, 26%, 27%, 28%, 29%, 30%, 31%, 32%, 33%,\n\n34%, 35%, 36%, 37%, 38%, 39%, 40%, 41%, 42%, 43%, 44%, 45%, 46%, 47%, 48%, 49%,\n\n50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%,\n\n66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%,\n\n82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%,\n\n98%, 99%, or more than 99%, including all values in between) of the amino acid sequence of the chimeric terpene synthase (e.g., a chimeric sesquiterpene synthase) may be derived from a rare or extinct plant. In some instances, a chimeric terpene synthase comprises one or more sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 119-357.\n\nAlso described herein are chimeric terpene synthases that are capable of producing alpha- guaiene. In some embodiments, at least 10% (e.g., at least 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, 25%, 26%, 27%, 28%, 29%, 30%, 31%, 32%,\n\n33%, 34%, 35%, 36%, 37%, 38%, 39%, 40%, 41%, 42%, 43%, 44%, 45%, 46%, 47%, 48%,\n\n49%, 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%,\n\n81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%,\n\n97%, 98%, 99%, or more than 99%, including all values in between) of the nucleic acid molecule encoding such a chimeric terpene synthase may be derived from a rare or extinct plant.\n\nIn some embodiments, at least 10% (e.g., at least 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, 25%, 26%, 27%, 28%, 29%, 30%, 31%, 32%, 33%,\n\n34%, 35%, 36%, 37%, 38%, 39%, 40%, 41%, 42%, 43%, 44%, 45%, 46%, 47%, 48%, 49%,\n\n50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%,\n\n66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%,\n\n82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%,\n\n98%, 99%, or more than 99%, including all values in between) of the amino acid sequence of the chimeric terpene synthase that is capable of producing alpha-guaiene may be derived from a rare or extinct plant.\n\nIn some instances, construction of the chimeras may include sequence (e.g., nucleic acid sequence and/or amino acid sequence) alignments between at least two terpene synthases of interest. For example, sequence alignment analysis may be used to identify fragments (e.g., domains) of a particular terpene synthase to include in a chimeric terpene synthase. In some embodiments, the chimeric terpene synthase is a chimeric sesquiterpene synthase. Non-limiting examples of analyses may include the types described in the blastn-mapdamage and tblastn pipelines described in Example 2.\n\nIn some embodiments, a chimeric terpene synthase coding sequence comprises a mutation at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more positions corresponding to a reference chimeric terpene synthase coding sequence. In some embodiments, the chimeric terpene synthase coding sequence comprises a mutation in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more codons of the coding sequence relative to a reference chimeric terpene synthase coding sequence. As will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, a mutation within a codon may or may not change the amino acid that is encoded by the codon due to degeneracy of the genetic code. In some embodiments, the one or more mutations in the coding sequence do not alter the amino acid sequence of the chimeric terpene synthase relative to the amino acid sequence of a reference chimeric terpene synthase.\n\nIn some embodiments, the one or more mutations in a chimeric terpene synthase sequence alter the amino acid sequence of the chimeric terpene synthase relative to the amino acid sequence of a reference chimeric terpene synthase. In some embodiments, the one or more mutations alter the amino acid sequence of the chimeric terpene synthase relative to the amino acid sequence of a reference chimeric terpene synthase and alter (enhance or reduce) an activity of the chimeric terpene synthase relative to the reference chimeric terpene synthase.\n\nThe skilled artisan will also realize that mutations in a chimeric terpene synthase coding sequence may result in conservative amino acid substitutions to provide functionally equivalent variants of the foregoing polypeptides, e.g., variants that retain the activities of the polypeptides. As used herein, aâconservative amino acid substitutionâ refers to an amino acid substitution that does not alter the relative charge or size characteristics or functional activity of the protein in which the amino acid substitution is made.\n\nIn some instances, an amino acid is characterized by its R group (see, e.g., Table 1). For example, an amino acid may comprise a nonpolar aliphatic R group, a positively charged R group, a negatively charged R group, a nonpolar aromatic R group, or a polar uncharged R group. Non-limiting examples of an amino acid comprising a nonpolar aliphatic R group include alanine, glycine, valine, leucine, methionine, and isoleucine. Non-limiting examples of an amino acid comprising a positively charged R group includes lysine, arginine, and histidine. Non limiting examples of an amino acid comprising a negatively charged R group include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Non-limiting examples of an amino acid comprising a nonpolar, aromatic R group include phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. Non-limiting examples of an amino acid comprising a polar uncharged R group include serine, threonine, cysteine, proline, asparagine, and glutamine.\n\nVariants can be prepared according to methods for altering polypeptide sequence known to one of ordinary skill in the art such as are found in references which compile such methods, e.g., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, J. Sambrook, et ak, eds., Fourth Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 2012, or Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, F.M. Ausubel, et ak, eds., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 2010.\n\nNon-limiting examples of functionally equivalent variants of polypeptides may include conservative amino acid substitutions in the amino acid sequences of proteins disclosed herein. Conservative substitutions of amino acids include substitutions made amongst amino acids within the following groups: (a) M, I, L, V; (b) F, Y, W; (c) K, R, H; (d) A, G; (e) S, T; (f) Q, N; and (g) E, D. In some embodiments, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 or more than 20 residues can be changed when preparing variant polypeptides. In some embodiments, amino acids are replaced by conservative amino acid substitutions.\n\nTable 1. Non-limiting Examples of Conservative Amino Acid Substitutions\n\nAmino acid substitutions in the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide to produce a chimeric terpene synthase (e.g., chimeric sesquiterpene synthase) variant having a desired property and/or activity can be made by alteration of the coding sequence of the chimeric terpene synthase (e.g., chimeric sesquiterpene synthase). Similarly, conservative amino acid\n\nsubstitutions in the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide to produce functionally equivalent variants of the polypeptide typically are made by alteration of the coding sequence of the chimeric terpene synthase (e.g., chimeric sesquiterpene synthase).\n\nMutations (e.g., substitutions) can be made in a nucleotide sequence by a variety of methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, mutations can be made by PCR- directed mutation, site-directed mutagenesis according to the method of Kunkel (Kunkel, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82: 488-492, 1985), or by chemical synthesis of a gene encoding a polypeptide.\n\nAny suitable method, including circular permutation (Yu and Lutz, Trends Biotechnol. 2011 Jan;29(l): 18-25), may be used to produce variants. In circular permutation, the linear primary sequence of a polypeptide can be circularized (e.g., by joining the N-terminal and C- terminal ends of the sequence) and the polypeptide can be severed (âbrokenâ) at a different location. Thus, the linear primary sequence of the new polypeptide may have low sequence identity (e.g., less than 80%, less than 75%, less than 70%, less than 65%, less than 60%, less than 55%, less than 50%, less than 45%, less than 40%, less than 35%, less than 30%, less than 25%, less than 20%, less than 15%, less than 10%, less or less than 5%, including all values in between) as determined by linear sequence alignment methods (e.g., Clustal Omega or BLAST). Topological analysis of the two proteins, however, may reveal that the tertiary structure of the two polypeptides is similar or dissimilar. Without being bound by a particular theory, a variant polypeptide created through circular permutation of a reference polypeptide and with a similar tertiary structure as the reference polypeptide can share similar functional characteristics (e.g., enzymatic activity, enzyme kinetics, substrate specificity or product specificity). In some instances, circular permutation may alter the secondary structure, tertiary structure or quaternary structure and produce an enzyme with different functional characteristics (e.g., increased or decreased enzymatic activity, different substrate specificity, or different product specificity).\n\nSee, e.g., Yu and Lutz, Trends Biotechnol. 2011 Jan;29(l): 18-25.\n\nIt should be appreciated that in a protein that has undergone circular permutation, the linear amino acid sequence of the protein would differ from a reference protein that has not undergone circular permutation. However, one of ordinary skill in the art would be able to readily determine which residues in the protein that has undergone circular permutation correspond to residues in the reference protein that has not undergone circular permutation by, for example, aligning the sequences and detecting conserved motifs, and/or by comparing the structures or predicted structures of the proteins, e.g., by homology modeling.\n\nAspects of the present disclosure relate to the recombinant expression of genes encoding enzymes, functional modifications and variants thereof, as well as uses relating thereto.\n\nA nucleic acid encoding any of the chimeric terpene synthases described herein may be incorporated into any appropriate vector through any method known in the art. For example, the vector may be an expression vector, including but not limited to a viral vector ( e.g ., a lentiviral, retroviral, adenoviral, or adeno-associated viral vector), any vector suitable for transient expression, or any vector for inducible expression (e.g., a galactose-inducible or doxycycline- inducible vector). A non-limiting example of a vector for expression of a chimeric terpene synthase (e.g., a chimeric sesquiterpene synthase) is described in Example 2 below.\n\nIn some embodiments, a vector replicates autonomously in the cell. A vector can contain one or more endonuclease restriction sites that are cut by a restriction endonuclease to insert and ligate a nucleic acid containing a gene described herein to produce a recombinant vector that is able to replicate in a cell. Vectors are typically composed of DNA, although RNA vectors are also available. Cloning vectors include, but are not limited to: plasmids, fosmids, phagemids, virus genomes and artificial chromosomes. As used herein, the terms \"expression vector\" or \"expression construct\" refer to a nucleic acid construct, generated recombinantly or synthetically, with a series of specified nucleic acid elements that permit transcription of a particular nucleic acid in a host cell (e.g., microbe), such as a yeast cell. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence of a gene described herein is inserted into a cloning vector such that it is operably joined to regulatory sequences and, in some embodiments, expressed as an RNA transcript. In some embodiments, the vector contains one or more markers, such as a selectable marker as described herein, to identify cells transformed or transfected with the recombinant vector.\n\nIn some embodiments, a vector is capable of integrating into the genome of a host cell.\n\nA coding sequence and a regulatory sequence are said to beâoperably joinedâ or âoperably linkedâ when the coding sequence and the regulatory sequence are covalently linked and the expression or transcription of the coding sequence is under the influence or control of the regulatory sequence. If the coding sequence is to be translated into a functional protein, the coding sequence and the regulatory sequence are said to be operably joined or linked if induction of a promoter in the 5â regulatory sequence transcribes the coding sequence and if the nature of the linkage between the coding sequence and the regulatory sequence does not (1) result in the introduction of a frame-shift mutation, (2) interfere with the ability of the promoter region to direct the transcription of the coding sequence, or (3) interfere with the ability of the\n\ncorresponding RNA transcript to be translated into a protein. Thus, a promoter region is operably joined or linked to a coding sequence if the promoter region transcribes the coding sequence and the transcript can be translated into the protein or polypeptide of interest. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid encoding any of the proteins described herein is under the control of regulatory sequences ( e.g ., enhancer sequences). In some embodiments, a nucleic acid is expressed under the control of a promoter. The promoter can be a native promoter, e.g., the promoter of the gene in its endogenous context, which provides normal regulation of expression of the gene. Alternatively, a promoter can be a promoter that is different from the native promoter of the gene, e.g., the promoter is different from the promoter of the gene in its endogenous context. As used herein, aâheterologous promoterâ or\n\nârecombinant promoterâ is a promoter that is not naturally or normally associated with or that does not naturally or normally control transcription of a DNA sequence to which it is operably joined or linked. In some embodiments, a nucleotide sequence is under the control of a heterologous promoter.\n\nIn some embodiments, the promoter is a eukaryotic promoter. Non-limiting examples of eukaryotic promoters include TDH3, PGK1, PKC1, TDH2, PYK1, TPI1, AT1, CMV, EFla, SV40, PGK1 (human or mouse), Ubc, human beta actin, CAG, TRE, UAS, Ac5, Polyhedrin, CaMKIIa, GAL1, GAL 10, TEF1, GDS, ADH1, CaMV35S, Ubi, Hl, U6, as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art (see, e.g., Addgene website: blog.addgene.org/plasmids-lOl-the- promoter-region). In some embodiments, the promoter is a prokaryotic promoter (e.g., bacteriophage or bacterial promoter). Non-limiting examples of bacteriophage promoters include Plslcon, T3, T7, SP6, and PL. Non-limiting examples of bacterial promoters include Pbad, PmgrB, Ptrc2, Plac/ara, Ptac, Pm.\n\nIn some embodiments, the promoter is an inducible promoter. As used herein, an âinducible promoterâ is a promoter controlled by the presence or absence of a molecule. Non limiting examples of inducible promoters include chemically-regulated promoters and physically-regulated promoters. For chemically-regulated promoters, the transcriptional activity can be regulated by one or more compounds, such as alcohol, tetracycline, galactose, a steroid, a metal, or other compounds. For physically-regulated promoters, transcriptional activity can be regulated by a phenomenon such as light or temperature. Non-limiting examples of tetracycline- regulated promoters include anhydrotetracycline (aTc)-responsive promoters and other tetracycline -responsive promoter systems (e.g., a tetracycline repressor protein (tetR), a tetracycline operator sequence (tetO) and a tetracycline transactivator fusion protein (tTA)). Non-limiting examples of steroid-regulated promoters include promoters based on the rat glucocorticoid receptor, human estrogen receptor, moth ecdysone receptors, and promoters from the steroid/retinoid/thyroid receptor superfamily. Non-limiting examples of metal-regulated promoters include promoters derived from metallothionein (proteins that bind and sequester metal ions) genes. Non-limiting examples of pathogenesis-regulated promoters include promoters induced by salicylic acid, ethylene or benzothiadiazole (BTH). Non-limiting examples of temperature/heat-inducible promoters include heat shock promoters. Non-limiting examples of light-regulated promoters include light responsive promoters from plant cells. In certain embodiments, the inducible promoter is a galactose-inducible promoter. In some embodiments, the inducible promoter is induced by one or more physiological conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, radiation, osmotic pressure, saline gradients, cell surface binding, or concentration of one or more extrinsic or intrinsic inducing agents). Non-limiting examples of an extrinsic inducer or inducing agent include amino acids and amino acid analogs, saccharides and polysaccharides, nucleic acids, protein transcriptional activators and repressors, cytokines, toxins, petroleum-based compounds, metal containing compounds, salts, ions, enzyme substrate analogs, hormones or any combination thereof.\n\nIn some embodiments, the promoter is a constitutive promoter. As used herein, a âconstitutive promoterâ refers to an unregulated promoter that allows continuous transcription of a gene. Non-limiting examples of a constitutive promoter includes CP1, CMV, EFla, SV40, PGK1, Ubc, human beta actin, CAG, Ac5, polyhedrin, TEF1, GDS, CaM35S, Ubi, Hl, and U6.\n\nOther inducible promoters or constitutive promoters known to one of ordinary skill in the art are also contemplated herein.\n\nThe precise nature of the regulatory sequences needed for gene expression may vary between species or cell types, but generally include, as necessary, 5â non-transcribed and 5â non- translated sequences involved with the initiation of transcription and translation respectively, such as a TATA box, capping sequence, CAAT sequence, and the like. In particular, such 5â non-transcribed regulatory sequences will include a promoter region which includes a promoter sequence for transcriptional control of the operably joined or linked gene. Regulatory sequences may also include enhancer sequences or upstream activator sequences. The vectors disclosed herein may include 5' leader or signal sequences. The regulatory sequence may also include a terminator sequence. In some embodiments, a terminator sequence marks the end of a gene in DNA during transcription. The choice and design of one or more appropriate vectors suitable for inducing expression of one or more genes described herein in a heterologous organism is within the ability and discretion of one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\nExpression vectors containing the necessary elements for expression are commercially available and known to one of ordinary skill in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook et ah, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Fourth Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2012).\n\nAny suitable host cell may be used to produce any of the chimeric terpene synthases disclosed herein, including eukaryotic cells or prokaryotic cells. Suitable host cells include fungal cells (e.g., yeast cells) and bacteria cells (e.g., E. coli cells). Non-limiting examples of genera of yeast for expression include Saccharomyces (e.g., S. cerevisiae), Pichia,\n\nKluyveromyces (e.g., K. lactis), Hansenula and Yarrowia. In some embodiments, the yeast strain is an industrial polyploid yeast strain. Other non-limiting examples of fungal cells include cells obtained from Aspergillus spp., Penicillium spp., Fusarium spp., Rhizopus spp., Acremonium spp., Neurospora spp., Sordaria spp., Magnaporthe spp., Allomyces spp., Ustilago spp., Botrytis spp., and Trichoderma spp.\n\nThe termâcell,â as used herein, may refer to a single cell or a population of cells, such as a population of cells belonging to the same cell line or strain. Use of the singular termâcellâ should not be construed to refer explicitly to a single cell rather than a population of cells.\n\nA vector encoding any of the chimeric terpene synthases (e.g., chimeric sesquiterpene synthases) described herein may be introduced into a suitable host cell using any method known in the art. Non-limiting examples of yeast transformation protocols are described in Example 2 below and in Gietz et al, Yeast transformation by the LiAc/SS Carrier DNA/PEG method.\n\nMethods Mol Biol. 2006;313:107-20, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for this purpose. Host cells may be cultured under any conditions suitable as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, any media, temperature, and incubation conditions known in the art may be used. For host cells carrying an inducible vector, cells may be cultured with an appropriate inducible agent to promote expression.\n\nAny of the cells disclosed herein can be cultured in media of any type (rich or minimal) and any composition prior to, during, and/or after contact and/or integration of a nucleic acid.\n\nThe conditions of the culture or culturing process can be optimized through routine\n\nexperimentation as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments, the selected media is supplemented with various components. In some embodiments, the concentration and amount of a supplemental component is optimized. In some embodiments, other aspects of the media and growth conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, etc.) are optimized through routine experimentation. In some embodiments, the frequency that the media is supplemented with one or more supplemental components, and the amount of time that the cell is cultured is optimized.\n\nCulturing of the cells described herein can be performed in culture vessels known and used in the art. In some embodiments, an aerated reaction vessel (e.g., a stirred tank reactor) is used to culture the cells. In some embodiments, a bioreactor or fermentor is used to culture the cell. Thus, in some embodiments, the cells are used in fermentation. As used herein, the terms âbioreactorâ andâfermentorâ are interchangeably used and refer to an enclosure, or partial enclosure, in which a biological, biochemical and/or chemical reaction takes place, involving a living organism or part of a living organism. Aâlarge-scale bioreactorâ orâindustrial-scale bioreactorâ is a bioreactor that is used to generate a product on a commercial or quasi commercial scale. Large scale bioreactors typically have volumes in the range of liters, hundreds of liters, thousands of liters, or more.\n\nIn some embodiments, a bioreactor comprises a cell (e.g., a yeast cell) or a cell culture (e.g., a yeast cell culture), such as a cell or cell culture described herein. In some embodiments, a bioreactor comprises a spore and/or a dormant cell type of an isolated microbe (e.g., a dormant cell in a dry state).\n\nNon-limiting examples of bioreactors include: stirred tank fermentors, bioreactors agitated by rotating mixing devices, chemostats, bioreactors agitated by shaking devices, airlift fermentors, packed-bed reactors, fixed-bed reactors, fluidized bed bioreactors, bioreactors employing wave induced agitation, centrifugal bioreactors, roller bottles, and hollow fiber bioreactors, roller apparatuses (for example benchtop, cart-mounted, and/or automated varieties), vertically- stacked plates, spinner flasks, stirring or rocking flasks, shaken multi-well plates, MD bottles, T-flasks, Roux bottles, multiple- surface tissue culture propagators, modified fermentors, and coated beads (e.g., beads coated with serum proteins, nitrocellulose, or carboxymethyl cellulose to prevent cell attachment).\n\nIn some embodiments, the bioreactor includes a cell culture system where the cell (e.g., yeast cell) is in contact with moving liquids and/or gas bubbles. In some embodiments, the cell or cell culture is grown in suspension. In other embodiments, the cell or cell culture is attached to a solid phase carrier. Non-limiting examples of a carrier system includes microcarriers ( e.g ., polymer spheres, microbeads, and microdisks that can be porous or non-porous), cross-linked beads (e.g., dextran) charged with specific chemical groups (e.g., tertiary amine groups), 2D microcarriers including cells trapped in nonporous polymer fibers, 3D carriers (e.g., carrier fibers, hollow fibers, multicartridge reactors, and semi-permeable membranes that can comprising porous fibers), microcarriers having reduced ion exchange capacity, encapsulation cells, capillaries, and aggregates.

Functional characterization of chimeric terpene synthases.\n\nGenomic DNA from 12 extinct plant samples were sequenced (Table 2). Sesquiterpene synthase (SQTS) fragments were recovered from seven plants (Table 11), but gaps in the sequencing prevented reconstruction of full-length genes. A library comprising 2,738 terpene synthase chimeras (containing sequence from sesquiterpene synthases from extant plants to fill the sequence gaps) was screened. The expression of 52 SQTS chimeras (sequences provided in Table 10) from six rare plants (Table 2) led to the production of sesquiterpenes in the screening strain. Methods and materials for each of the procedures described in this Example may be found in Example 2.\n\nTable 2. Rare Plants that were Sequenced (The plants from which functional sesquiterpene chimeras were reconstructed are shown bold face and underlined.)\n\nThe terpenes produced by the functional SQTS chimeras were identified initially based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) data. In some cases, authentic standards or essential oils containing characterized sesquiterpenes were available to confirm mass spectrum- and retention time-based identifications. In other cases, standards were not available and structural identifications were made based on mass spectral analysis alone. The different methods used to identify the structures are detailed in Table 3, and the specific methods used to identify each sesquiterpene are indicated in Tables 4-9. In some cases, products were identified only asâsesquiterpeneâ orâsesquiterpenol.â In one case, a mass spectrum was recovered but did not yield a match in the NIST/internal database. This sesquiterpenol was identified in the product tables as anâunidentified sesquiterpenolâ and additional characterization may be used to determine its structure.\n\nFourteen SQTS chimeras derived from Hibiscadelphus wilderianus produced 1 or more sesquiterpenes (FIG. 1, Table 3). Seven SQTS chimeras derived from Leucadendron\n\ngrandiflorum also produced sesquiterpenes (FIG. 2, Table 5), as did six SQTS chimeras from Macrostylis villosa (FIG. 3, Table 6), two from O. stipulatum (FIG. 4, Table 7), six from Shorea cuspidata (FIG. 5, Table 8), and seventeen from Wendlandia angustifolia (FIG. 6, Table 9). The SQTSs were found to produce one to nine different terpenes. The product profiles of the plant SQTS chimeras were different when the functional SQTS chimeras were grouped by the terpenes produced in highest yield (FIG. 7). Delta-cadinene synthases were the most numerous group of functional chimeras at a total of 22 and were derived from four of the plants. 10 of the 14 of the synthases from H. wilderianus were of this variety. Alpha-cadinol was frequently detected as a minor product of the delta-cadinene synthases; however, three SQTS chimeras from S. cuspidata yielded more alpha-cadinol than delta-cadinene. These six SQTS chimeras derived S. cuspidata produced a very similar product mixture (Table 8, FIG. 13).\n\nThe screening of the 2,738-member chimeric sesquiterpene synthase library resulted in the successful expression of 52 functional chimeric sesquiterpene synthases (SQTSs). Fourteen synthases were derived from H. wilderianus, a tree which went extinct in Hawaii over 100 years ago. Cadinene, cadinol, and eudesmol-type sesquiterpenes were produced by these chimeras. A few active chimeras were also generated from O. stipulatum, a plant that went extinct in\n\nKentucky in the l800s. Two guaienes and gamma-bisabolene were produced by these synthases Seven functional SQTS chimeras were constructed from L. grandiflorum, a plant that went extinct over 200 years ago. Diverse sesquiterpene and sesquiterpenol structures were produced by these chimeras, along with those derived from three other plants.\n\nTable 3.

Non-limiting examples of sequence fragment(s) derived from rare plants.\n\nExample 2. Materials and methods for construction of terpene synthase chimeras.\n\nTerpene synthases for Capture-seq and chimera scaffolding\n\nCandidate sesquiterpene synthases (SQTSs) were designed by combining sequence fragments from rare flower genomes (Table 11) withâscaffoldâ SQTSs from sources including UniProt and GenBank.\n\nFor Capture-seq (targeted sequencing of terpene synthases), a subset of 5,171 terpene synthases (TPSs) were compiled from UniProt that had nucleotide sequences in EMBL/Genbank. Oligonucleotide chips were generated for enriching the flower DNA samples for TPS- homologous sequences, and then subjected first to Illumina sequencing. The Capture-seq libraries were also sequenced a second time at higher depth.\n\nFor SQTS chimera reconstruction, sequences closer to annotated SQTSs than annotated mono-, di-, or tri-terpene synthases were selected. This set of 1,521 putative SQTSs were used (in both nucleotide and peptide form) as query sequences for blastn and tblastn in the chimera construction pipeline below.\n\nChimera reconstruction\n\nTwo methods were used for constructing chimeric SQTSs: 1) the blastn-mapDamage pipeline, and 2) the tblastn pipeline. blastn-mapdamage pipeline\n\nGenerally, the blastn-mapdamage pipeline conservatively detects fragments with high nucleotide similarity to the scaffolds resulting in chimeric terpene synthases (e.g., chimeric sesquiterpene synthases) that are likely very close to the original enzyme sequences in the rare flowers. To detect mutations that may be artifacts of stereotypical rare DNA damage, barn- formatted Illumina read alignments were inputted into mapDamage software.\n\nSpecifically, the following steps were used to generate alignments of DNA fragments from each flower to various SQTS scaffolds: 1. Illumina reads (fastq files) from genomic capture-seq runs were combined and assembled by SPADES into longer contigs.\n\n2. The l52l-set of SQTS scaffolds were used as queries in a blastn search with default parameters against the SPADES contigs. Relatively few scaffolds had hits, so all of the scaffolds with hits were chosen to serve as references for read alignment in the next step.\n\n3. Combined reads from the sequencing runs were quality-trimmed (using bbduk) and pair-merged (using bbmerge) and aligned to chosen SQTS reference sequences using bwa mem. Results were reformatted to bam, sorted, and indexed.\n\n4. mapDamage was run on the aligned reads. This resulted in a read alignment where SNPs resembling DNA damage were assigned low quality scores.\n\n5. Read alignments were processed as follows: bases with quality < 25 were masked (changed to the reference); alignments were reformatted to fasta; SNPs with counts < 6 were masked; duplicate reads were removed; SNPs with frequency < 0.1 were masked; reads that were exact subsequences of other reads were removed; reads were translated in the frame of the reference; and subsequences were removed again. The quality and SNP frequency thresholds used for masking the alignment were determined empirically by looking at distributions of quality and SNP frequency.\n\n6. Read alignments and SPADE contig alignments (after reference-frame translation) were combined and realigned using Clustal Omega. This was done because some contigs spanned regions of the scaffolds that the reads did not.\n\nThe alignments from the above steps were used to construct SQTS chimeras as follows:\n\n1. The alignment was split intoâindependent subregionsâ such that each subregion did not contain any fragment (aligned read) overlapping with and differing from a fragment from another subregion (identical overlaps were allowed between subregions).\n\n2. In each subregion, all possible combinations ofâcompatible fragmentsâ were\n\nenumerated. Compatible fragments were defined as fragments that either overlapped identically (and therefore could be merged into a longer fragment) or did not overlap at all (and, e.g., were assumed to come from the same haplotype). Fragment combinations wereâmax-coverageâ - that is, contained as many compatible fragments as possible. Each max-coverage fragment combination was considered to be a possible reconstruction of that region of the alignment, and was merged into a superfragment (which may have contained gaps) and saved.\n\n3. Superfragments from each subregion were downsampled to 90% or 95% identity using a custom, iterative algorithm, and all possible combinations of downsampled superfragments from different subregions were combined. Regions that were shorter than a certain threshold are downsampled to a single sequence. Each combination of superfragments was merged into the scaffold to generate a chimera sequence. The downsampling parameters were varied slightly varied according to the sample and scaffold to allow >1 but <100 chimeras to be constructed in each case.\n\nAfter running the above pipeline on each sample, a total of 1136 chimeras were generated. A significant fraction of the chimeras were constructed purely from aligned reads.\n\nA total of 652 sesquiterpene synthase chimeras were created using these methods. tblastn pipeline\n\nGenerally, the tblastn pipeline maximized the sensitivity of detecting fragments homologous to the SQTS scaffolds, and therefore cast a wide net for potentially usable sequences.\n\nSpecifically, the following steps were used to generate alignments of DNA fragments from each flower to various SQTS scaffolds:\n\n1. The l52l-set of SQTS scaffolds were used as protein queries to tblastn to search all frames translations of the SPADES contigs (described above).\n\n2. Hits (aligned contigs) were filtered to a minimum of 40% identity to the scaffold and a minimum length that depends on hit identity by a heuristic function. The filtering criteria were chosen by inspecting plots of hit length versus identity across all samples.\n\n3. Downsampling scaffolds was performed by hierarchically clustering the scaffolds by the number of identical residues to each hit. The scaffold in each cluster with the greatest number of identities across all of its hits was kept for chimera reconstruction. Downsampling reduced the number of scaffolds by 20-fold. This step was skipped for samples in which fewer than 10 scaffolds have hits.\n\n4. Certain scaffolds were always chosen as a cluster representation because they were previously identified as having activity and/or were known in the literature (even if another sequence had more identities to hits). These preferred scaffolds were not downsampled, and tblastn hits were kept for chimera construction.\n\n5. The aligned portions of all contigs hitting a scaffold were realigned to the scaffold using Clustal Omega. Unaligned portions of contigs were discarded as likely representing introns. This alignment was then used for chimera construction.\n\n6. Chimeras were constructed from aligned tblastn hits using the combinatorial\n\ncompatible fragments method described above without downsampling in subregions. Bothâmax-coverageâ (as many as possible compatible fragments in each set) and âmin-coverageâ (only one compatible fragment in each set) chimeras were generated. The min-coverage chimeras may avoid combining fragments from unrelated sequences.\n\nThe tblastn pipeline yielded 10,114âmax-coverageâ chimeras and 2,624âmin-coverageâ chimeras. Certain max-coverage chimeras were downsampled to 95% identity by CD-HIT. This resulted in 388 sequences (382 after removing sequences with ambiguous amino acids). Certain max coverage chimeras were filtered to a minimum rare DNA content of 60% and downsampled to 90% identity. This resulted in 1320 sequences. Certain min-coverage chimeras were filtered to a minimum rare DNA content of 10% and downsampled to 95% identity by CD-HIT.\n\nEncoding and synthesis order\n\nEach enzyme was codon-optimized twice: once using a yeast expression-weighted codon table, and once using a yeast expression- weighted codon table after removing codons with <10% frequency. A different random number was used as the seed for each encoding. Encodings for different enzymes were completely independent - no specific procedure was used to preserve codons at residues inherited by chimeras from scaffolds.\n\nSequences encoding the chimeric enzymes were cloned into the pESC-URA3 screening vector, driven by pGALl and terminated by tCYCl. Chimera reconstruction aided by extant transcriptome\n\nFor one of the extinct flower species, Shorea cuspidata, transcriptome sequencing data was available on an extant relative Shorea beccariana. This made it possible to construct chimeras using SQTS scaffolds from a related flower. This was done in a 2-step process:\n\n1. The S. beccariana (Sb) transcriptome data were assembled and mined for SQTS homologs. The data were downloaded from the data set SRR687302 from the NCBI SRA database. Assembly was done using Trinity, and ORFs were predicted via Transdecoder. BLAST was used to identify fragments homologous to a set of 1,500 curated SQTS sequences.\n\n2. The identified Sb SQTSs or SQTS fragments were used as scaffold sequences in either the tblastn or blastn-mapDamage pipelines to reconstruct chimeras. If the scaffold was a fragment itself, it was in turn merged into the closest Uniprot- sourced SQTS sequence to generate a full-length chimera.\n\nScreening Strain and Sesquiterpene Synthase Transformation\n\nThe chimeric sesquiterpene synthases were transformed into high copy pESC-URA3- derived expression vectors under the control of the galactose-inducible P(gall) promoter (Sikorski et al, A system of shuttle vectors and yeast host strains designed for efficient manipulation of DNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genetics. 1989 May;l22(l):l9-27, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for this purpose).\n\nThese vectors were transformed into a haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK2 strain (MATa ura3-52 trpl-289 leu2-3_l 12 his3Al MAL2-8C SUC2) that had been modified to increase sesquiterpene flux via integration of two copies of the catalytic region of HMG-CoA reductase 1 under control of convergent P(gall) promoters at the homothallic switching endonuclease (YDL227C) locus on chromosome 4 (see SEQ ID NO: 53 shown below). See: Entian et al, Yeast Genetic Strain and Plasmid Collections. Methods in Microbiology. 2007; (36): 629-666; tHMGl, Donald et al, Effects of overproduction of the catalytic domain of 3- hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase on squalene synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Metab Eng. 2013 Jan;l5:l74-83, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Competition for fanesyl pyrophosphate was reduced in these cells by replacing the Erg9 (Farnesyl-diphosphate famesyl transferase) promoter with the methionine-repressible Met3 promoter as shown below in SEQ ID NO: 54 and incubating in media containing methionine (see: Ro et al, Production of the antimalarial drug precursor artemisinic acid in engineered yeast. Nature. 2006 Apr l3;440(7086):940-3; and Asadollahi et al, Production of plant sesquiterpenes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: effect of ERG9 repression on sesquiterpene biosynthesis. Biotechnol Bioeng. 2008 Feb l5;99(3):666-77, each of which is hereby\n\nincorporated by reference in its entirety for this purpose). This strain with downregulated Erg9 and containing two copies of galactose-inducible tHMGl on chromosome 4 was designated 1119889.\n\nThe transformation of the chimeric sesquiterpene vectors into strain tl 19889 was performed employing the chemical transformation techniques demonstrated in Gietz et al., Yeast transformation by the LiAc/SS Carrier DNA/PEG method. Methods Mol Biol. 2006;313:107-20, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for this purpose.\n\nSesquiterpene Production and Extraction\n\nTransformant colonies were inoculated into 300 pl of SC-ura medium (Synthetic\n\nComplete with 2% dextrose, no uracil added) in 96 deep well plates. The plates were covered with Excel Scientific AeroSeal membranes (BS-25) and incubated for 48 hours at 30 Â°C in a shaking incubator. 30 mÎ of the cultures (1:15 dilution) were mixed into 420 mÎ of SC -ura induction medium containing 1.8% galactose and 0.2% raffinose as the carbon sources, yielding a starting optical density at 600 nm (ODeoo) of approximately 0.1-0.2. A 0.88% dodecane overlay (4 mÎ) was added to each well and the plates were covered with AeroSeal membranes and incubated at 30Â°C in a shaking incubator for four days. 15 mÎ of each culture was removed to measure ODeoo at the end of the four days. 350 mÎ of ethyl acetate (250 mM tridecane internal) was added to directly to each well and mixed (1:1 Extraction). The 96- well plates were then centrifuged and the ethyl acetate extractions were stored at -80 Â°C in glass vials until analysis by GC-MS.\n\nSesquiterpene structure identification Ethyl Acetate samples (l.OuL) were injected into the Agilent/Gerstel 7890B GC System, where the GC inlet was set to 250C with a split ratio of 2:1. The capillary column was an Agilent DB-5MS (20mx0.l8 mmx0.l8pm) with carrier gas (helium) flow set to l.5ml/min. The GC oven temperature was set to l00Â°C (hold for 0.10 min) with a ramp of 40Â°C/min to l55Â°C, where the ramp was then l5Â°C/min to l90Â°C and then finally the ramp was changed to 75Â°C/min to 280C (5-minute method). For a more comprehensive analysis of targets, the GC oven\n\ntemperature was set to l00Â°C (hold for 2.0 min) with a lOÂ°C/min ramp to 250Â°C (hold for 2.0 min) was utilized (20-minute method). The MS source and quadruple for both methods were set to 230Â°C and l80Â°C on the Agilent 5977B MSD (Etune), respectively. The mass scan range was set to 40-250 mz where spectra and linear retention index calculations were matched against the NIST MS database (2008 version), in addition to available standards and essential oils.\n\nPeaks present in the extracted ion chromatogram (204.2mz parent mass) were identified in one of six ways (see Table 3).
