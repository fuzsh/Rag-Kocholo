        "text": "Coumarins are secondary plant metabolites widely distributed in higher plants, bacteria, fungi, and sponges. This great structural diversity of these natural compounds and their synthesized derivatives enables their wide range of pharmacological activities, such as antioxidant; antibacterial; antifungal; anti-human immunodeficiency infection; anti-tubercular; and anti-cancer activities. There are also many reports about their effectiveness against plant pathogenic pests (phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria, nematodes, and insects)."
