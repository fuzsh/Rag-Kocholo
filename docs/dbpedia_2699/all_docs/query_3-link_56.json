        "text": "Tuberose Absolute\n\nPolianthus tuberosa\n\nIndian origin (Tamil Nadu)\n\nTuberose is one of the most intense, assertive and important florals you can find in a bottle. We’ve got two, and they are really different oils.\n\nTuberose absolute is more known, and all information regarding its use in perfumery is based on this very strong oil. This Tuberose absolute is made from the concrete. It can take 1200 kilo of tuberose flowers to make 200 grams of the absolute.\n\nSophy Chen\n\nSonnet 3 Tuberose\n\nAs I was young my mom planted some flowers\n\nIn front of our old wooden house in springs\n\nIn my memory they were peony, China rose…\n\nBut what I loved the most was the tuberose\n\nIn summer night it's a nice time to me\n\nYou could sit in yard to listen the night birds\n\nSinging on cliffs, insects singing in bushes\n\nAnd look at the moon moving in night skies\n\nHowever, while your heart was beating at pace\n\nWith insects singing and in the sudden\n\nFrom nowhere floating the rays of fragrance\n\nIn the moon a bunch of tuberose blossoms\n\nAs these flowers always bloom in moon nights\n\nYour great poem may be living in its fragrance\n\n2010 Guangzhou, China\n\nOn to Arctander:\n\nThe tuberose plant is a tender, tall, slim perennial, a native of Central America where wild growing species can be found. It’s name refers to its bulb, although it’s not really technically a tuber in botanical terms. And it has nothing to do with roses. Tuberose is related to Narcissus and Jonquil.\n\nTuberose absolute from concrete is a dark orange to brown colored, viscous liquid, with a heavy floral, almost nauseatingly sweet, heavy and somewhat spicy odor, reminiscent of honeysuckle, peru balsam, orange flower absolute, ylang ylang residue fractions, stephanotis flowers, etc. The odor also has some resemblance to longoza absolute.\n\nTuberose absolute is used in high-class floral perfumes of heaviest and sweetest types: frangipani, stephanotis, caprifolium, lilac, heliotrope, gardenia, violet, and in the heaviest oriental types, opoponax, in fantasy perfumes, etc.\n\nBattaglia says\n\nWhile Tuberose absolute is not used in aromatherapy, it has plenty of psychic and subtle energy uses. It has a definite narcotic effect, and some feel it can calm strong emotions, promote motivation and enthusiasm, and invite love into one’s life.\n\nConsider blending it with jasmine, rose and ylang ylang as well as heavy resins like peru balsam and opoponax\n\nSafety Warning"
