        "text": "Beautiful rich tea-like, sweet-herbaceous note with almost some floral qualities. It is dry tea leaves-like, but retains the fruity-bergamotish twist that clearly identifies Clary Sage from the other herb oils. You could find hay-sweet herbaceous, or even a little bit earthy-soily.\n\nIt has quite similar uses with the Carnation abs. product, i use it as a freshener agent and as sweetener. It’s light, delicate, almost watery, ethereal herb. The dryout leaves a watery-almost citrus ozonic trail.\n\nThis is nothing like any essential oil i bought for creating fougere and men cologne..this is superior than any clary sage you ever experienced..fruity, herbal and sweet..although is solid mass you can easily work with it..thank you hermitage for the experience\n\nSo I would never say it’s clary sage. I didn’t know what it was. It escapes a little more from distilled clary sage, which is sometimes unbearably strong at first. Clary sage absolutely is something completely different .. than dried herbs of all kinds in the countryside, nice sweets, rays of the summer sun, unbearable summer heat at noon .. I even feel a hint of sweet lavender there. Definitely a beautiful note that I will study a lot when I use it somewhere. I think he will be a very fair partner to many of Adam’s jewelry.\n\nAdam has sourced an incredible material here, it’s sweet, rich, warm and subtly hay-like, herbaceous, tea-like, and deceptively powerful. If your only experience is the essential oil, then you’re in for a treat with this absolute, they are worlds apart. Absolutely beautiful!\n\nAbsolute favorite! the most elegant, sophostocated herb – fresh yet substantial and well-rounded, green yet pleasantly musky – truly unique among hebrs. In therapeutic terms- true euphoric, and for some individual even ecstatic! – once in Aromatherapy class I’d witnessed a student going into uncontrollable fit of hysterical joy and rapture in front of the full class – after therapeutically inhaling a healthy dose of Clary Sage. Lends itself as a leading ingredient for all fine top easily smoothing all the sharpness and bitterness of its cousins. The Absolute also possesses alluring yet approachable sensual note that gives an aura of natural easy beauty, pleasnt both at distance and in intimate embrace, even as a light, yet sensual, perfume on its own. Playful and sophisticated with easy charm."
