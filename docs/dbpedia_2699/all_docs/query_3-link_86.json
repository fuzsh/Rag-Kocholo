        "text": "‘Habanita‘ A classic oriental-type perfume brought out by Molinard in 1924. It has a sweetly floral heart, with rose and ylang-ylang predominating. The top notes are fruity, mostly bergamot and peach, and the low notes balsamic and powdery, dominated by vanilla and a leather fragrance. This perfume was relaunched in 1988 with a revised formula by Roure, using the famous Lalique flacon known as ‘Beauty’ .\n\nHair Powder In 17th and 18th century Europe there was a widespread demand for hair powders, used for cleaning wigs and giving them a fashionable grey-white appearance. Such powders were supplied by perfumers, often being scented with musk, rose and other fragrances.\n\n‘Halston Z-14‘ A trend-setting chypre-type fragrance for men produced by Halston in 1976 for use in men’s toiletries. Its main ingredients are bergamot and lemon in the top note, jasmine and patchouli in the middle note and amber and leather fragrance in the lower note.\n\nHang Kan A woody vine (Hanghomia marseillei) native to Indonesia and Malaysia. The aromatic roots are burnt as incense in local pagodas and a liquid and a powder made from the roots are used locally in religious ceremonies.\n\nHawthorn Also called May Blossom. A hedge tree (Crataegus oxycantha) native to northern Europe and Asia with flowers having a spicy, almond-like fragrance. The hawthorn was regarded by the Greeks as a tree of fortune and by the Romans as a symbol of marriage. It is not used as a natural material in perfumery; the Hawthorn or May Blossom fragrances of the present day are made synthetically, being used in particular to provide freshness and ‘sparkle’. The fragrance appears in many modern quality perfumes (e.g. ‘Fahrenheit‘).\n\nHayfield Notes A term used in perfumery to describe fragrances, usually based on coumarin, which have an odour of new-mown hay.\n\nHazelcrottle A lichen, also called Hazelraw, Lungwort and Rage (Lobaria pulmonaria), found in sub-alpine woods of Europe. It yields an essential oil found in perfumery.\n\nHazel Nut Oil Also called Filbert Oil. An oil extracted from the fruits of the European Hazel tree (Corylus avellana), found in Europe and temperate Asia and cultivated widely. The oil has many uses, including its use in perfumery.\n\nHeavy Notes In perfumery the term ‘heavy’ denotes a fragrance in which the least volatile ingredients, such as mossy or animalic ones, are dominant, giving a very strong effect. Such fragrances are mostly used in chypre and oriental-type perfumes.\n\nHeliotrope A fragrant oil used in perfumery which is obtained from the flowers of the Heliotrope (Heliotropium peruvianum and related species), also called (because of its aroma) Cherry Pie. The plant is an annual growing up to 2 feet high which originated in Peru but was introduced into Europe in the mid-18th century and is now cultivated widely in both tropical and temperate regions. A species of the Heliotrope was used in the perfumes of ancient Egypt (see Egyptian Perfumes). Today the dried flowers are used in pot pourri, but the fragrance called Heliotrope, of which there are different varieties, is mostly produced synthetically using heliotropin, vanillin and other ingredients. Heliotrope appears in many modern quality perfumes (e.g. ‘Lou-Lou’ and ‘Chant d’Aromes’).\n\nHeliotropin A chemically produced aldehyde discovered in 1885. It is made from safrole, has the fragrance of the Heliotrope flower and is used in synthetic Heliotrope fragrances in perfumes and toiletries.\n\nHelleu, Jacques A prominent contemporary designer of perfume bottles and packaging, head of design for Parfums Chanel, who has provided designs for, among others, Bourjois, Chanel (‘Coco’) and Ungaro (‘Diva‘).\n\nHerbaceous Note A term used in perfumery to describe the characteristic general fragrance of herbs and herbal medicines. Sage, rosemary and lavender are examples. Such fragrances are widely used in masculine perfumes.\n\nHermes A distinguished French fashion house particularly associated with sporting wear and accessories. The company was originally established in 1837 by Thierry Hermes as a harness-making business, a fact now reflected in the names of some of its perfumes. The perfume division (Hermes Parfums) was set up in 1950, marketing the first Hermes perfume, the classic ‘Bel Ami‘ (86). Since 1979 the company’s fragrances have been prepared from a factory complex at Le Vaudreuil, near Rouen.\n\nHerodotus A Greek, born in Asia Minor in about 485 BC (died 425 BC), who wrote the earliest book on the history and geography of the ancient world which is still extant. Known as ‘The Histories’ and produced in about 446 BC, the work contains information about the use of perfumes at the time and in particular about the trade in cinnamon, cassia, labdanum, frankincense and myrrh from Arabia.\n\nHesperides A term used in perfumery to describe the fragrances obtained from citrus fruits.\n\nHomoranthus Oil An oil used in perfumes which is distilled from an Australian (New South Wales) shrub Homoranthus virgatus (= H. flavescens).\n\nHonesty Oil Also called Huile de Julienne and Rotrops Oil. An oil obtained from the seeds of the Damask plant (Hesperis matronalis), also called Garden Rocket, Dames’ Rocket, White Rocket, Sweet Rocket, Purple Rocket, Ruchette, Roquette, Dames’ Violet and Vesper Flower. The plant, native to central Europe but now found as far as central Asia, is a biennial growing up to 3 feet high. It emits its fragrance in the evenings, and as it has no fragrance during the daytime it is held to represent deceit. The oil is sometimes used in perfumery and the dried flowers are used in sachets and pot pourri.\n\nHoney Honey was used as an ingredient in early Arab perfumes and appears in later European ones (see, for example, Honey Water). In modern perfumery a substance providing the sweet aromatic effect of honey and known as Honey (or Miel) is manufactured synthetically.\n\nHoneysuckle Essential oils are extracted from the flowers of many species and hybrids of honeysuckle (Lonicera), including Lonicera periclymenon, the English wild honeysuckle, L. caprifolium (Europe) and L. fragrantissima (China). They have a warm, jasmine-like odour with a suggestion of vanilla, but the yield of essential oil is extremely low. Most fragrances called Honeysuckle used in perfumes are therefore compounded synthetically using a mixture of natural and chemical substances. Examples of Honeysuckle used in high-quality modern perfumes include ‘Cristalle‘. The dried flowers of honeysuckle are used in sachets and pot pourri.\n\nHoney Water A toilet water popular in France and England from the 18th century as a face lotion and known to apothecaries as Aqua Mellis. The recipe varied, but at one time the ingredients included brandy, honey, coriander, cloves, benzoin, storax, rosewater, neroli, musk and ambergris. Lemon peel, nutmeg, orange flower and saffron were also sometimes employed. The preparation was also sometimes used as a medicine.\n\nHop Oil An essential oil obtained by steam-distillation from the flower tops of the Hop plant (Humulus lupulus). It has a bitter, herbaceous odour and is occasionally used in perfumes with a herbal fragrance.\n\nHorsehair Lichen A lichen, Alectoria jujuba, which grows widely in temperate areas. It provides a dye and has occasionally been used in perfumery.\n\nHoubigant Oldest of the great French perfume houses, and pre-dated among the existing perfume houses of the world only by Floris, the firm of Houbigant was established in Paris in 1775, as ‘glovers and perfumers’ by Jean-Francois Houbigant, then aged 23. By 1782 the clientele of the House of Houbigant included Queen Marie Antoinette and the royal court and nobility, to whom it supplied toilet waters (such as Eau de Mousseline, Eau de Millefleurs and Eau de Chypre), powders and scented gloves. The firm survived the difficult years of the French Revolution and soon began to prosper again. In 1807 it passed to Houbigant’s son, and then to his partner Chardin, who became personal perfumer to Napoleon. It is recorded that Napoleon ordered perfumes, toiletries and gloves from Houbigant shortly before Waterloo, and that when he lay dying ‘two of Houbigant’s perfumed pastilles were burning in his room’. Houbigant were appointed perfumers to King Louis Phillipe’s sister, Princess Adelaide, in 1829, to Queen Victoria in 1838, to Emperor Napoleon III in 1870, and to the Tsar of Russia in 1890 (when they created a special perfume called The Czarina’s Bouquet’). In 1880 the company passed into the hands of a prominent perfumer, Paul Parquet, one of the first to use synthetics and the creator of ‘Fougere Royale’ (1882). At the turn of the century it was joined by another distinguished perfumer, Robert Bienaime, the creator of ‘Quelques Fleurs‘ (1912).\n\nAmong the many other perfumes produced by Houbigant may be cited: ‘Ideal’ (1900) (sometimes described as the first true composite perfume), ‘Parfum d’Argeville’ (13), ‘Ambre’ (19), ‘Un Parfum Precieux’ (27), ‘Essence Rare’ (30, relaunched 76) and ‘Etude’ (31), all of which appeared in notable flacons made by Baccarat. In addition to ‘Fougere Royale’ and ‘Quelques Fleurs’, recent and current Houbigant perfumes include: ‘Chantilly’ (41), ‘Ciao’ (80), ‘Raffinee’ (82), ‘Les Fleurs’ (83), ‘Lutece’ (86), ‘Demi Jour’ (87) and two men’s fragrances ‘Monsieur Houbigant’ (69) and ‘Musk Monsieur’ (77).\n\nThe company still compounds its fragrances at Grasse, and since 1880 has operated its main factory at Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris. Houmiri Also called Umari. A scented oil obtained from a fungus which attacks the bark of the Bastard Bullet tree (Houmiri floribunda) of Brazil and Guyana. It is used locally for scenting the hair and body.\n\nHudnut, Richard One of the founders of the American perfume industry. The son of a chemist and druggist, he set up a highly successful perfumery in New York, marketing his first perfume, ‘Violet Sec’, in 1896. Other well-known Hudnut perfumes included ‘Aimee’ (1902), ‘Vanity’ (10) and Three Flowers’ (15). Hudnut sold his business in 1916, but it continued to manufacture perfumes until 1946.\n\nHungary Water One of the earliest toilet waters made by distilling aromatic plants with wine alcohol. It was first produced in about 1370 AD for the Queen of Hungary and became very popular throughout Europe. It was made from the flowers of rosemary, with smaller portions of marjoram and pennyroyal, to which in later years were added citron, lavender and orris. In later times some other recipes for it also came into use. A modern version, made of rosemary with mint, lemon balm and orange peel, is marketed by Crabtree & Evelyn.\n\nHuon Pine A tall tree (Dacrydium franklinii) growing in Malaysia, Borneo, New Caledonia, Tasmania, Australia and New Zealand. Huon Pine Oil, which has a clove-like smell, is distilled from the wood for use in toilet waters and soaps.\n\nHyacinth The flowers of the Hyacinth (Hyacinthus orientalis), which is of Syrian origin but is now cultivated widely and with innumerable varieties, provide by extraction an essential oil of considerable value in perfumery. The oil is usually used as an absolute or concrete, but the yield of concrete is only about 0.01-0.02%, making it extremely expensive. The odour is powerfully floral with a suggestion of storax. A less powerful, though fresher and more flowery, perfume is obtained from the wild Blue Hyacinth (H. non scriptus = Scilla nutans). However, most of the Hyacinth oils now sold are prepared artificially. Examples of modern quality perfumes containing Hyacinth are ‘Nino Cerutti’, ‘Givenchy III’ and ‘White Linen’. Scholars now believe that H. orientalis was the plant referred to in the Bible as Lily of the Valleys. Greek legend holds that the flower grew from the blood of Hyacinthus, a youth accidentally killed by Apollo; in Greece it now signifies remembrance.\n\nHyraceum The product of the Hyrax (the Coney of the Bible), a small rabbit-like vegetarian animal of the genus Procavia which lives in rock clefts in Arabia and the Middle East. It is a digestive excretion and is found in irregular, amorphous masses which are plastic when kneaded. The odour is somewhat musky and recalls that of castoreum, for which it is sometimes used as a substitute. It has little part in western perfumery. It is probably the substance called in Arabic Ba’r tibbi (‘fragrant dung’) used as an ingredient in one of al-Kindi’s early Arab perfume recipes.\n\nHyssop Hyssop Oil is obtained by steam-distillation from the leaves, stem and flowers of hyssop, a small shrubby aromatic herb (Hyssopus officinalis) native from the Mediterranean area to Iran. Hyssop is cultivated for this oil, mainly in France and Germany, the yield being about 0.5%. The oil has a fine, warm, spicy, slightly camphorous odour and is mostly used in eau de colognes and as a flavouring (notably for liqueurs). The dried leaves are used in sachets and pot pourri.\n\nThe name Hyssop derives from the Greek azab, meaning a holy herb, because the Old Testament notes its use in cleansing temples. It was also used from early times in medicines, and is so recorded by Dioscorides. However, it is now believed that the Hyssop of the Old Testament was a different plant, a species of marjoram (Origanum maru) common in the Middle East. O. maru is also thought to have been the fragrant material used by the early Arab perfume makers under the name Marmakhuz.\n\nIceland Wintergreen A handkerchief perfume popular in the USA during the late 19th century. It was made from rose, lavender, neroli, vanilla, cassie and wintergreen.\n\nIguga A tree native to tropical Africa and known also as Mpopwa and Popioe (Fagara chalybea) from the seeds of which an oil used in local perfumes is obtained.\n\n‘Imperial Leather‘ A famous fragrance now used by Cussons in their toiletries. In 1768 Count Orloff, visiting Bayleys, the court perfumers, in London, challenged them to create a perfume which reproduced the aroma of the leather worn and favoured by the Russian nobility. The result was a new perfume, ‘Eau de Cologne Imperiale Russe’, which became the favourite fragrance of the Empress Catherine the Great. After Cussons absorbed Bayleys early in this century they adopted this fragrance, under the name ‘Imperial Russian Leather’, for their new soaps, the word ‘Russian’ being dropped in 1989.\n\nIncense A fragrant smoke produced by burning aromatic substances; also substances burned to create such smoke. Incense has been burned since earliest times in all parts of the world in religious rites, as a fumigant, and simply for the pleasure of its perfume. Fragrant plant materials such as frankincense and storax are used on their own, or incenses are compounded from a number of different resins, herbs and spices mixed together. Under the Roman Empire frankincense was the principal incense used, and enormous quantities of it were imported from South Arabia and the Horn of Africa for the purpose. The ‘holy incense’ of the Jews was compounded in the time of Exodus, and incense was burned in Christian churches from the 5th century AD. Incense tablets were used in wealthy homes in Europe to sweeten the air in the 18th century. In modern times Indian joss sticks, formed by binding a mixture of powdered resins and other aromatic materials into a paste with a gum and rolling it on to sticks, have continued to be used in Europe, while most of the great religions, except Islam, continue to use incense in their ceremonies, and it is still burned for domestic purposes in many parts of the world. In modern western perfumery the term ‘incense’ is sometimes used to signify frankincense as a perfume ingredient.\n\nIncenso Macho The local name for a resin obtained in Peru, probably from a tree Styrax ovatum, which is used as an incense and also in perfumery. Its fragrance recalls Siam benzoin or vanilla.\n\nIndole A chemical which occurs naturally in many essential oils, including jasmine, neroli, orange blossom, robinia, wallflower and some species of citrus, and is also manufactured synthetically. It is a crystalline substance with an odour which is unpleasant until greatly diluted, when it becomes agreeably fragrant with a distinct floral note of an orange blossom and jasmine type. It is used in preparing artificial jasmine and neroli perfumes.\n\n‘Infini‘ An intensely aldehydic floral perfume created by IFF perfumers for Caron, who launched it in 1970. The name was first chosen for a perfume issued in 1912 and was re-used to celebrate the advent of space flight. Green aldehydic top notes introduce a floral heart containing jasmine, jonquil, rose, lily of the valley and tuberose, on a base which is principally sandalwood. The fragrance is said to have\n\ntaken 15 years to develop. The bottle was designed by Serge Mansau.\n\nInfusion A term used in perfumery to describe the process for producing attars by extraction with a solvent solution under heat. It is also used to denote the substance so derived.\n\nInternational Flavours and Fragrances Generally abbreviated to IFF. An American company which is the largest wholesale manufacturer of flavourings and fragrances in the world (see Perfume Manufacture). Formed in the USA in the 1930s by Hank van Amerigen and a colleague, Haebler, the company was originally called Van Amerigen-Haebler and developed rapidly. In 1958 it amalgamated with Van Amerigen’s former employers, the Dutch fragrance firm Polak & Schwarz, founded at the end of the 19th century, and became IFF, with its headquarters in New York. The company sells its fragrances to makers of perfumes and cosmetics, hair and other personal care products, soaps and detergents, household and other cleaning products and area fresheners. Fragrances account for 62% (and flavours for 38%) of its sales. It has created about 16% of all the quality perfumes now on the market.\n\nIFF operates some 57 sales offices in 38 countries throughout the world, with 30 factories and about the same number of creative laboratories. It has major installations in New York, New Jersey and Hilversum, Holland and its main complex in Britain is at Haverhill, Suffolk. It has a substantial investment in research and development, maintaining a computerized ‘library’ which records over 30 000 different fragrance and flavour molecules; recent developments include living flower technology.\n\n‘Intimate‘ A classic chypre perfume brought out in 1955 by Revlon, for whom it was created by IFF perfumers. The heart is floral, chiefly jasmine and rose, with woody undertones from sandalwood and cedarwood, among others. The top notes are aldehydic, with bergamot and rose among the underlying fragrances. Amber and castoreum provide the main base notes, with hints of oak moss, civet and musk.\n\nIonone An important synthetic perfume ingredient with the scent of violets discovered by Tiemann and Kruger in 1893. It is made chemically from citral, a substance found in the oils of citrus fruits and some other plants, and by other chemical processes.\n\nIris, Yellow The Yellow Iris (Iris pseudoacorus), also called Yellow Flag,Dragon Flower, Myrtle Flower, Flower de Luce (Fleur de Lys) and Myrtle Grass, grows in watery areas such as on river banks throughout Europe and N. Africa and as far as Siberia. The powdered roots were once used to perfume linen and clothes.\n\nIsoeugenol A substance with the fragrance of carnations which is found naturally in the essential oils of nutmeg and ylang-ylang and is obtained from eugenol. It provides perfume makers with a good fixative.\n\nIva An intensely musky essential oil distilled from the leaves and flowers of the Musk Yarrow plant (Achillea moschata), which grows in Italy and Switzerland. It is principally used to manufacture liqueurs (e.g. Esprit d’lva) but is occasionally used in perfumery.\n\n‘Ivoire‘ A quality floral perfume created for Balmain in 1979 by the perfumers of Florasynth. The top notes are green with a touch of spice, containing marigold, bergamot, galbanum, wormwood and camomile. The heart is intensely floral and includes jasmine, lily of the valley, rose, orris, jonquil and neroli. Warm, woody lower notes are based on frankincense, vetivert, sandalwood and amber. The square-shaped flacon, sealed inside an ivory covering, was designed by Pierre Dinand.\n\nJacques Fath A celebrated Paris fashion house set up in 1937 by the couturier Jacques Fath (1912-1954) and closed three years after his death from leukaemia. His fragrance business still survives. Jacques Fath perfumes include ‘Ellipse’ and ‘Expression’ (1977), both coming in bottles designed by Serge Mansau, and a men’s fragrance ‘Green Water‘ (53).\n\nJapan Flowers A name given to certain types of floral bouquet perfumes which were popular early in this century.\n\nJapanese Star Anise A tree (Illicium anisatum = I. religiosum) native to China (where it is called Mang-tsao, meaning ‘the mad herb’) and Japan (where it is called Shikimi and Dai-ui-Kio). In Japan the aromatic branches are used to scent tombs, while the bark is burned in Japanese homes and in Buddhist temples as an incense. An essential oil obtained from the leaves provides a fragrance resembling lemon oil and nutmeg.\n\n‘Jardins de Bagatelle‘ A floral perfume created by Jean-Paul Guerlain and launched by Guerlain in 1984. It is sold in a flacon designed by Robert Granai. A top note of violet, with a fruity tone from bergamot, lemon and calycanthus, leads into an intensely floral heart which includes rose, jasmine, narcissus, ylang-ylang, orris, orchid and lily of the valley, with a touch of cassis. The base contains vetivert, cedarwood, patchouli, benzoin, musk and civet. The perfume is named after the chateau and gardens built in 1777 for Queen Marie Antoinette.\n\nJasmine Also called Jasmin and Jessamine. The name derives from the Arabic/Persian Yasmin. The essential oils yielded by certain species of jasmine (plants of the genus Jasminum) are among the most important of all fragrances used in perfumery. Species used in perfumery are as follows.\n\n1.Jasminum officinale, the Common White Jasmine, a native of N. India and Iran, which was introduced into Europe in the 16th century.\n\n2.J. grandiflorum, called Spanish or Catalonian Jasmine or Royal Jasmine. Native to southern Europe. This is the principal plant used in the perfumery trade, being first so used in Spain during the 16th century, and is cultivated in enormous quantity around Grasse and in Morocco, Spain, Algeria, Egypt and India.\n\n3.J. sambac, called Zambac (Arabic Zanbaq) or Arabian Jasmine, sometimes also Tuscan Jasmine. Native to tropical Asia and introduced into Britain in the 17th century. In India this jasmine is known as Chameli and the oil as Motia, the oil being used in many Indian perfumes and also in hair oils, for which it is extracted by enfleurage using sesame seeds which are then pressed to extract the perfume.\n\n4.J. odoratissimum, called Yellow or True Yellow Jasmine, a native of Madeira and the Canary Islands. The flowers remain fragrant when dried and have an odour of blended jasmine, jonquil and orange blossom.\n\n5.J. auriculatum, sometimes called Julii, found in tropical Asia, especially Sri Lanka, Mauritius and Thailand.\n\n6.J. niloticum of tropical Africa, the oil from which is used as a perfume in Sudan.\n\nArabian Jasmine was recorded in China, where it was called Mo Li, as early as the 3rd century AD, being cultivated then for the unopened buds, which were used by women to decorate their hair and were also used to give fragrance to tea. Oils of both Common Jasmine and Arabian Jasmine were being used by Arab perfume makers at least by the 9th century AD, the leaves being sometimes employed as well as the flowers.\n\nAn acre of land will yield about 500 lb of jasmine blossom (from J. grandiflorum), which is extracted by enfleurage, usually with olive oil. The yield of concrete is very small and of absolute considerably less, making the latter one of the most expensive perfume materials available. Since much of the production cost is a matter of labour charges, perfume makers now increasingly obtain their jasmine absolute from countries such as Egypt, where labour is cheaper. In the enfleurage process 3 lb of flowers are used to perfume about 1 lb of oil, an extract then being obtained by maceration in 1 pint of rectified spirit. Extraction is also undertaken by volatile solvents.\n\nJasmine has been the principal ingredient in a very large number of perfumes, including such classics as ‘Arpege’, ‘Joy’, and ‘Chanel No. 5’ and a whole range of high class modern perfumes from ‘Amouage’ through to ‘Ysatis’. It appears among the principal ingredients in 83% of all quality perfumes and 33% of all men’s fragrances. Its odour is unique and cannot be effectively imitated by synthetics.\n\n‘Jazz‘ A spicy-floral men’s fragrance launched by Yves St Laurent in 1988. In the top notes, artemisia, coriander and juniper are given a spicy touch by nutmeg, cinnamon and cardamom, leading to a floral heart of jasmine, lily of the valley and geranium, with base notes containing sandalwood, patchouli, oak moss, sage, labdanum, frankincense and opoponax.\n\n‘Je Reviens‘ A classic, trend-setting perfume created by Maurice Blanchet for Worth in 1932. One of the earliest of the floral-aldehyde perfumes, it included spicy elements. Aldehydic top notes, mainly orange blossom, give way to a spicy floral heart founded on carnation, with hyacinth, jasmine, rose, tuberose and ylang-ylang. Vetiver, tonka and musk provide the principal base notes. The principal flacon, in the shape of a star-spangled blue orb, is by Lalique.\n\n‘Jicky‘ A famous 19th century perfume created by Aime Guerlain, introduced by Guerlain in 1889 and now regarded as one of the greatest\n\nof all perfume classics. It is sometimes described as the first modern perfume. Classified as a semi-oriental fougere-type fragrance, it contains citrus top notes, mostly lemon, but with hints of mandarin, bergamot and rosewood. In the middle notes, which are floral and woody, jasmine and patchouli predominate, with rose, orris and vetivert. The base notes are led by vanilla, with balsamic undertones. The perfume is marketed in a flacon by Baccarat.\n\nJil Sander A German perfume house forming part of the Benckiser group of fragrance companies. In 1980 it launched ‘Jil Sander’, a green-fresh perfume which includes galbanum, coriander and bergamot in the head, rose, jasmine, carnation and ylang-ylang in the heart and oak moss and vetivert among the base notes. Other Sander fragrances include ‘Woman Two’ (83), ‘Woman III’ (87) and ‘Jil Sander No. 4’ (91), together with four men’s fragrances ‘Man Pure’ (81), ‘Men Two’ (83), ‘Man III’ (88) and ‘Man IV’ (91).\n\nJockey Club A name given to many perfumes in the early part of the 20th century. The original perfume of this name is said to have attempted to imitate the fragrance wafted towards Epsom race course from nearby woods during the late spring meeting.\n\n‘Joie de Vivre‘ A ‘green’ perfume (see Perfume Families) launched by Lentheric in 1985. Created by Roure perfumers, its top notes include jasmine and rose, on a heart dominated by iris, with woody notes underlined by a base mainly of amber and sandalwood.\n\nJojoba Oil An oil obtained from the seeds of a small bushy tree called the Pignut, or Goatnut, tree (Simmondsia californica = S. chinensis = S. pabulosa), native to Mexico and California. The oil, which is clear, waxy and scentless, is mostly used in aromatherapy and in cosmetic preparations, but provides a good base to which fragrant essential oils can be added when simple perfumes are being made at home\n\n‘Jolie Madame‘ A classic chypre perfume introduced by Balmain in 1953. Created by Germaine Sellier of Roure, it has an unusual top note obtained from gardenia and artemisia with a touch of neroli, bergamot and coriander. The heart is floral, mainly jasmine, with underlying touches which include jonquil, tuberose, orris and rose. The base notes are mossy and leathery, dominated by patchouli and castoreum.\n\nJonquil Also known as Rush Daffodil, Jonquille and Wild Jonquil, this plant (Narcissus jonquilla), native to S.W. Europe and N. Africa, is a species of Narcissus which has been cultivated in the south of France for its essential oil since the 18th century. The oil is the most strongly scented of the Narcissus oils (see Narcissus) and the most popular one used in perfumery, but the plant is difficult to cultivate successfully. High-quality perfumes using it include ‘Parure’ and ‘Fleurs de Rocaille’. The dried flowers are used in pot pourri.\n\nA closely related species, the Campernella Jonquil, or Campernella (N. odorus), produces a similar though less powerful oil. Although known since the 16th century, this plant appears to be a hybrid cultivated from early times and has not been found in the wild. It is grown widely and is cultivated in the south of France for its oil.\n\nThe fragrance of jonquil is often imitated synthetically.\n\n‘Joy‘ A perfume classic of great distinction, introduced by Jean Patou in 1935 as an unusually luxurious scent which became the most costly perfume on the market. It was created for Patou by Henri Almeras. Its heart is in the main a blending of rose and jasmine. The top note includes rose, tuberose and ylang-ylang. The lower note is a restrained combination of sandalwood, musk and civet. The original ‘Joy’ flacon was designed by Louis Sue; it is also now sold in a crystal flacon by Baccarat and in flacons by Brosse.\n\nJuniper Also called Common Juniper, Genevrier, Ginepro and Enebro. A small, shrub-like tree (Juniperus communis) growing to about 6 feet high and found in Europe, N. America, N. Africa and northern parts of Asia. There are other species. The berries, which take three years to ripen, each contain three seeds. From the ripe berries a colourless or pale yellow-green oil, called Juniper Oil or Juniper Berry Oil, is steam-distilled; this oil which has a fresh terebinth or turpentine-like odour is mostly used in medicines, but it also appears in perfumery, usually as a concrete or absolute (it is to be found, for example, in ‘Mystere’ and in the modern quality men’s fragrances ‘Tsar‘). The honey and pine-like aromatic scent of the plant once made it popular as a strewing herb to sweeten stale air. The leaves are still used in sachets and pot pourri.\n\nAn oil scented with juniper berries was used by the ancient Egyptians to anoint corpses during the mummification ceremony, and juniper also appears as an ingredient of the famous Kyphi incense. From early times juniper has been regarded as a magic plant, so featuring in ancient legends about evil spirits, probably because of its considerable medicinal and antiseptic properties. Juniper oil is still one of the most important oils used in aromatherapy.\n\nKabushi Oil An essential oil distilled in Japan from a small species of Magnolia tree (Magnolia kobus) native to Japan.\n\nKachi Grass Oil A spicy, slightly lemon-scented essential oil obtained from the leaves and roots of Kachi Grass (Cymbopogon caesius), native to India, where it grows mostly in Mysore and Bangalore and is also known as Inchi Grass. Kachi Grass Oil is used in soaps, cosmetics and perfumes.\n\nKalapa Tijoong A tree also known as Kannarahan (Horsfieldia irya = Myristica irya) which is found from Sri Lanka to Indonesia. It has sweet-smelling flowers which are used locally in perfumery.\n\nKamynye Oil A vanilla-like oil, used in perfumery as a fixative, which is extracted from a tropical African herb (Hoslundia opposita).\n\nKapur Kachri A fragrant perfume material obtained from the dried root of a species of Ginger-wort (Hedychium spicatum), which grows in northern India and Nepal and is used in Indian and other eastern perfumes. The roots are also burned in India as an incense. The word Hedychium comes from Greek meaning ‘sweet snow’ because of the pure white, sweetly scented flowers. The dried root has a violet-like scent. The roots are dried or powdered in India to place among clothes.\n\nKaro-Karundi A flowering shrub (Leptactinia densiflora, L. senegambica and L. manii) growing to about 6 feet high and found in tropical W. Africa. In Guinea an essential oil is distilled from the flowers and used in perfumery. The fragrance resembles jasmine with orange flower and acacia.\n\nKaraya Gum Also called Kateera Gum. A gum obtained by puncturing the bark of a tree Sterculia urens indigenous to tropical Asia. The gum appears in small irregular white or yellowish, semi-transparent tears. It provides a bonding agent useful in making incense pastes.\n\nKazanluk A town and area in the centre of the important rose-growing region of Bulgaria known as the Valley of the Roses. The region produces attar, mainly from the Damask rose, by distillation and on a large scale for the perfume industry, exporting much of it to France. Over a thousand varieties of Damask rose are now cultivated for this purpose.\n\nKerleo, Jean A distinguished French perfumer (‘nose’). Commenced his career with Helena Rubinstein in 1955, becoming their head perfumer. Joined Jean Patou in 1967 and has created all the Patou fragrances since that date. Also created ‘Lacoste’. President of the Societe Technique des Parfumeurs de France 1976- 79 and author of a book, Le Parfum.\n\nKhaluq An unguent of the early Arabs made for women and forbidden to men. The ingredients varied. One recipe, which gives a good idea of the complexity of some of the Arab perfumes, was recorded by al-Kindi. It required dried safflower, which was mixed with rose-hips, cubeb oil and pounded cardamom and then kneaded with sesame oil. Peeled mahaleb fruit, ground rose flowers and honey were added. This preparation was fumigated ‘twenty times a day for three days’ with an incense made of Indian costus, sweet hoof, sandalwood and camphor. Next it was aromatized several more times with a perfume called Muthallathah, made chiefly of rosewater and dragon’s blood. It was then mixed with saffron and camphor and kneaded with jasmine oil. Finally extra saffron was added. Exact measures for all these ingredients were prescribed by al-Kindi, who added: ‘It is quite wonderful’.\n\nal-Kindi, Yaqub An Arab savant who lived mostly in Baghdad c. 800-870 AD and is known as ‘the philosopher of the Arabs’. Wrote some 250 works on subjects as diverse as philosophy, mathematics, music and astronomy. His Book of Perfume Chemistry and Distillations contained some 107 perfume recipes and instructions, using 106 different ingredients derived from plants, 11 from animals and 9 from minerals; it is the principal source of our knowledge about early Arab perfumes (see Arab Perfumes).\n\nKiou-Nouk A clear, semi-liquid resin obtained by a special process from frankincense to provide a more aromatic, less sickly odour than that of frankincense itself. It is an excellent fixative and blends well with almost any of the essential oils.\n\nKnot Grass Oil An oil obtained from the common weed Knot Grass (Polyganum aviculare), which grows all over the world and is also known as Red Robin, Hogweed and by very many other local names. It appears mixed with other oils in sone of the early Arab perfume recipes.\n\n‘Knowing‘ A quality floral-chypre perfume launched by Estee Lauder in 1989. Created by the perfumers of Firmenich, it features an unusual floral ingredient, pittosporum, in an elaborate top note also containing rose, mimosa, tuberose, davana and fruity notes from plum and melon. The heart is mainly jasmine, lily of the valley, patchouli and orris, with a spicy touch from bay. The base notes come from oak moss, amber, sandalwood, vetivert and musk. It is sold in a lead crystal flacon, with a gold cord, which was designed by Ira Levy.\n\nKuro-moji Oil A Japanese perfume oil with a balsamic fragrance similar to myrtle which is distilled from the seeds, leaves and twigs of two related mountain shrubs, Lindera umbellata and L. fericia, native to Japan.\n\nKuchoora A perfume material derived from a species of Curcuma (Curcuma zerumbet) which grows in India; it is used in Indian perfumery. The roots are dried and powdered, when they provide a camphor-like fragrance.\n\nKyphi An oil and fat-free incense paste made by the ancient Egyptians. It was based on wine and raisins, with a number of aromatic herbs and resins added, including juniper berries, frankincense, myrrh and honey. Different recipes exist for Kyphi, including recipes inscribed on the walls of the temples at Edfu and Philae and one recorded by Dioscorides. Plutarch described it as a mixture of sixteen herbs and resins, including myrrh, henna, cardamom, juniper, saffron, honey and raisins, all steeped in wine. Democritus added spikenard among the ingredients and noted that the mixture was beaten into a paste and then allowed to solidify. Kyphi was a sacred perfume of great importance to the Egyptians, who burned it in their temples at sunset and in their homes during the night.\n\nKypros An ancient Greek perfume mentioned by Theophrastus. It contained cardamom and a sweet-scented material called Aspalathus which had first been steeped in sweet wine. It was used by men and was believed to counter lassitude.\n\nLabdanum Also called Ladanon, Ledanon, Black Balsam, Storbon and Gum Cistus. A brownish, sweet-scented oleo-resin obtained from shrubs of the genus Cistus, known as the Rock Rose, found in the Mediterranean area, N. Africa and the Middle East. The resin exudes in sticky droplets on hairs on the underside of the leaves and on the stems. It is usually extracted by volatile solvents, or sometimes just by boiling the branches, and is then purified by maceration with an alcohol, yielding 1-2% of volatile oil. Labdanum is of great importance in modern perfumery: its fragrance closely resembles ambergris; it is economic in use and mixes well with other perfumes; it is a valuable fixative in many bouquet perfumes; and it provides the main material (Ambrein) used for manufacturing synthetic ambers. It is used not only in many quality perfumes (e.g. ‘Jazz‘), but also in soaps, cosmetics, deodorants and even insecticides. Perfumers often call it Amber, and ‘Amber’ or ‘Labdanum’ appears among the main constituents of some 33% of all modern quality perfumes and 20% of all quality fragrances for men.\n\nOf some seven species of Cistus used in perfumery, the two principal ones are as follows.\n\n1. Cistus ladanifer (= C. polymorphus), a shrub growing up to 12 feet high, with white flowers, which is sometimes called Gum Cistus. It grows wild in southern France, Spain and N. Africa and is cultivated in those countries and also in Greece and Corsica. This is the main labdanum-producing species of the present time. The resin, also called Guma Labdanum and Droga de Jara, has a fragrance described as ambered, warm and leather-like.\n\n2. C. incanus (= C. incanus ssp. creticus = C. villosus ssp. creticus = C. creticus). Growing up to 3 feet high, with pink flowers, this is the plant which for the most part provided the labdanum of ancient times; it is found in eastern Mediterranean areas, particularly Crete and Cyprus, and in the Middle East, including Arabia. (The botanical names of species of Cistus have been changed in recent years following taxonomic research.)\n\nLabdanum does not appear to have been known to the Egyptians of earliest times, but was listed by Herodotus in the 5th century BC as an ingredient in many kinds of perfumes and one of the principal aromatics brought from Arabia. It was possibly the ‘myrrh’ of the oldest parts of the Old Testament (see Balm of Gilead). Herodotus observed that the Arabs combed it off the beards of goats which had browsed among the bushes; it seems probable that at this time only the Arabs had learned how to collect this gum; Dioscorides later described its gathering by drawing leather thongs over the leaves, a system still employed in Crete. Labdanum was one of the main ingredients of the original chypre perfume and a constituent of the Royal Unguent of Parthia. The early Arab perfume makers used it in their recipes, and during the Middle Ages it was an important ingredient of pomanders.\n\n‘Lace‘ A wide-selling floral-chypre perfume created for Yardley in 1964 by the perfumers of Roure. The top note, mostly provided by tangerine and ylang-ylang, gives way to a floral heart containing jasmine and rose, with musky, ambery and woody base notes.\n\nLacinaria Also called Liatris, Deer’s Tongue, Hound’s Tongue and Vanilla Trilisia. A herb (Trilisia odoratissima = Liatris odoratissima) found in the eastern USA. The dried leaves, which have an odour of coumarin and vanilla, have been used for perfuming tobacco and were for a long time a major source of coumarin for use in perfumery.\n\nLagerfeld A perfume house established in 1975 by the Swedish-German fashion designer and photographer Karl Lagerfeld (b. 1939), who in his career has designed for Balmain, Patou, House of Chloe and Chanel as well as producing collections in his own name. In 1975 he produced ‘Chloe’, to be followed by ‘K.L.’ (82) and two men’s fragrances, ‘Lagerfeld‘ (78) and ‘Photo’ (90). The company now belongs to Unilever.\n\n‘L’Aimant‘ A famous classic floral perfume introduced by Coty in 1927. Francois Coty, who was assisted by the perfumer Vincent Roubert, is said to have taken five years to perfect it. The top note contains bergamot and citrus notes, and the heart is a bouquet of jasmine, rose and geranium. The base note includes vanilla, vetivert, musk and civet.\n\n‘L’Air du Temps‘ A celebrated classic floral perfume brought out by Nina Ricci in 1948. Created for Ricci by Francis Fabron of Roure, it was designed to be a perfume which would leave a memory as the wearer passed by. Under a top note of gardenia and bergamot, the heart is a spicy floral fragrance based on carnation, jasmine, rose, ylang-ylang and orris. The base note is mainly sandalwood and musk. The perfume comes in a well-known crystal flacon, featuring doves on the stopper, which is made by Lalique, and also in flacons by Brosse.\n\nLalique Founded in 1905 by Rene Lalique (1860-1945), already at that time a leading jeweller, the firm of Lalique is now one of the world’s foremost manufacturers of high-quality glass crystal ware, being particularly noted for its Art Deco designs of the 1920s and for its own distinctive decorative style of post-war years. Approached by Francois Coty in 1905 to design perfume bottles, Rene Lalique subsequently created flacons for a number of other famous perfume houses, such as Houbigant, Worth and Roger et Gallet. The firm has continued to make such flacons until the present day. The original flacon for ‘Je Reviens’ (Worth) was produced by Lalique, and Lalique currently provides the flacons for Nina Ricci’s ‘L’Air du Temps’ and ‘Nina’ among others.\n\nLancome A company founded in Paris in 1935 by Armand Petitjean, a perfumer (d. 1981), to produce fragrances and beauty products; it entered the UK market in 1946 and is now particularly noted for its skincare products. Lancome’s first perfume, ‘Conquete’, was launched in 1935. Subsequent fragrances have included ‘Magie’ (1950, with a flacon by Lalique), ‘Balafre’ (67), ‘Climat’ (68), ‘Sikkim’ (71), ‘Tresor‘ (52 and 91). The company’s headquarters and main factory are at Chevilly Larue, near Paris, and since 1964 it has been owned by L’Oreal.\n\n‘La Nuit‘ A chypre perfume introduced in 1985 by Paco Rabanne, for whom it was created by the perfumers of Roure. It has fruity top notes of tangerine and lemon mixed with, among other ingredients, myrtle, artemisia and cardamom. The heart includes peach, rose, jasmine and a spicy effect from pepper, while the base contains oak moss, patchouli and cedar. The bottle was designed by A. Ricard.\n\nLanvin Parfums Lanvin was founded by the Paris couturier and costume designer Mme Jeanne Lanvin (1867-1946), who launched her first perfume ‘My Sin’ in 1925, following it in 1927 with the highly successful ‘Arpege’. Subsequent Lanvin perfumes include ‘Scandale’ (31), ‘Arpege‘ were created by Andre Praysse. It was once said that the volume of flowers needed each year to make Lanvin perfumes equalled in bulk the size of the Arc de Triomphe. The company is now controlled by the Vuitton family.\n\n‘Lauren‘ A ‘fruity-fresh’ floral perfume devised by Parfums Ralph Lauren (now owned by L’Oreal) in 1978 with the creative perfumers of IFF. Fruity green fragrances in the top notes give way to a cool floral heart of ylang-ylang, mimosa, orange blossom and marigold, with base notes of cedar, sandalwood and oak moss. The flacon, in the form of a crystal cube, was designed by Bernard Kotyuk.\n\nLavender There are several species of lavender, producing different types of lavender oil through steam-distillation of the freshly cut flowers and stalks, and they are grown on a considerable scale to meet the huge demands of the perfume industry. The main species are:\n\n1.Old English Lavender (also called English Lavender) (Lavandula vera =L. officinalis = L. augustifolia), which has the finest aroma. A bush some 3-5 feet high, it grows best in Britain, where it was once cultivated intensively in Surrey (providing Mitcham Lavender Oil) and is still produced in large quantity elsewhere, including Norfolk, where Yardley still have large lavender estates. Other principal areas of cultivation are Tasmania and the south of France. Examples of quality fragrances which contain Old English Lavender are ‘Blue Grass’, ‘Paco Rabanne’ and ‘Silvestre’.\n\n2.Two sub-species of L. vera, named botanically L. delphinensis (Lavender of Dauphine) and L. fragrans, are cultivated in the south of France, providing what is called French Lavender.\n\n3.Spike Lavender (L. spica = L. latifolia) a coarser variety native to mountainous areas in the Mediterranean region. Also called Lesser Lavender, Broad-leaved Lavender or Nardus Italica, this is grown in France, Spain and Yugoslavia and provides Oil of Spike (Essence\n\nd’Aspice), sometimes called Spike Lavender Oil. The quality of this oil, which has a camphorous odour, is inferior but the yield from the plant is three times that of L. vera; it is used in men’s fragrances, low-grade lavender perfumes and soaps. This lavender was mentioned by Theophrastus and some authorities believe that it was the Spikenard of the Old Testament;\n\n4.French Lavender (L. stoechas = Stoechas officinarum), also called Stoechas, Arabian Stoechas, Stichados, Stickadore, Cassidony and Candy Rosemary. A small, attractive-looking plant plentiful in France, Spain and Portugal, it provides Stoechas Oil, distilled in Spain, which has a camphorous odour more like rosemary than lavender and is used medicinally as well as in perfumes and soaps;\n\n5.Bastard Lavender, a hybrid lavender crossed between L. spica and L. fragrans. This is grown in France for an oil with a slightly camphorous fragrance known as Lavandin, mainly used in soaps but found also in some modern perfumes (e.g. ‘You’re the Fire’).\n\nThe dried stems of flowers and leaves from all these lavenders are used in sachets and pot pourri and have for long been placed among linen and clothes to scent them.\n\nLavender has been a favourite perfume material since the time of the Greeks and Romans. The Romans made much use of it (particularly of Stoechas) in their bath water, and the name ‘Lavender’ may derive from the Latin lavare – to wash. From medieval times it was used not only in pot pourri and sachets and for scenting linen and clothes but also to strew on the floors of churches and houses. In Tudor times it was also used in Britain to stuff quilted jackets and caps.\n\nUntil 1906 lavender oil was extracted by water-distillation, but in that year a more efficient technique of dry steam-distillation was introduced. An acre of ground will grow about 3500 plants of English Lavender, yielding around 151b of oil. Total world production is enormous, with the south of France alone at one time processing nearly 5000 tons of lavender flowers every year. The oil has for long also been valued medicinally because of its antiseptic and antibiotic properties, and it is highly valued in aromatherapy.\n\nLavender Cotton Oil Also called Cotton Lavender and sometimes French Lavender, the leaves of the Lavender Cotton plant (Santolina chamaecyparissus), a shrub native to the western Mediterranean area, provide an essential oil with a camphor-like fragrance. The plant is not a true lavender. The oil is occasionally used in perfumery, and the dried leaves are used in sachets and pot pourri.\n\nLavender Water A toilet water popular in England since the 17th century, when it was prepared by distilling freshly picked lavender which had been immersed for a few days in alcohol. There are now many different recipes in use, one of the simplest being made by mixing 1 oz of Lavender Oil into 1.5 pints of spirits of wine, with an added drop of musk.\n\nLawang Oil An essential oil with a clove-like fragrance distilled from a species of cinnamon tree (possibly Cinnamomum culilawan) found in Indonesia.\n\nLeather Notes A term applied in perfumery to certain fragrances which are suggestive of leather. They are popular in the composition of many masculine perfumes and some feminine ones, especially chypre-type perfumes.\n\n‘Le Dix‘ A classic aldehyde perfume by Balenciaga, for whom it was created by Roure perfumers. It was introduced in 1947. The aldehydic top notes contain suggestions of bergamot, lemon, peach and coriander and give way to a heart based principally on rose, jasmine and orris. The lower notes are woody and balsamic, with vetivert, patchouli, sandalwood, rosewood, musk and civet.\n\n‘L’Egoiste‘ Sold outside the UK as ‘Egoiste’, this woody-spicy men’s fragrance was created by Jacques Polge for Chanel, being a revised version of a fragrance they had previously marketed in Europe as ‘Bois Noir’. It was launched in 1990 with notably lavish TV advertising. On a strong base built mainly on sandalwood and ambrette, it obtains spicy notes from cinnamon and coriander, with added touches which include rosewood, mandarin, tangerine and rose.\n\n‘Le Jardin d’Amour‘ A wide-selling aldehydic floral-oriental scent launched by Max Factor in 1986. Composed of 192 ingredients, it contains rose, with orris, coriander and black pepper, in the top notes, leading into a heart which is primarily composed of neroli, tuberose, geranium and ylang-ylang, and base notes of sandalwood, vanilla, amber and musk. The flacons are made by Bermioli Luigi of Italy.\n\n‘Le Jardin de Max Factor‘ A wide-selling light floral perfume introduced by Max Factor in 1982. It was created by the perfumers of Dragoco. The top note is fruity-floral, with neroli, honeysuckle, peach and bergamot. In the floral middle note jasmine, rose, lily of the valley and magnolia predominate, while the base contains amber, cedar, myrrh and a hint of musk.\n\n‘L’Elisir d’Amore‘ A quality toilet water launched by Crabtree & Evelyn in 1989 as a fragrance in toiletries sold in conjunction with the Royal Opera House in London. It is based on a popular handkerchief perfume of the 19th century and contains a floral medley on a woody base.\n\nLelong, Lucien A leading Parisian couturier who established the Lucien Lelong perfume house with the launching of his first perfume, Tout le Long’, in 1925. There followed ‘A’ and both in 1927 and both in Lalique bottles, and a series of other fragrances which included ‘Indiscret’ (35), ‘Cachet’ (48) and ‘Editions Limitee’ (50) (his last). Lelong bottles were noted for their startling modernity.\n\nLemon Grass Oil Also called Camel Grass Oil. An essential oil obtained by steam-distillation from Lemon Grass (Cymbopogon citratus = C. schoenanthus = Andropogon schoenanthus = A. citratus), native to the Middle East and India. The plant is also known as Camel Grass, Rush, Scented Rush and Camel Rush. In western perfumery it is principally used in soaps, but in India it is found in both perfumes and medicines. It is cultivated in India, Sri Lanka, the Seychelles, the Far East, central Africa, central America and the W. Indies as a major source of citral, one of the chief constituents of the oil. In dried form the plant is also used in pot pourri and sachets. The oil is sometimes called Oil of Verbena because of its similarity with Verbena Oil. The early Arab perfume makers used it in perfumes based on sesame and cotton seed oil, recognizing, as did Dioscorides, that the best quality came from N. Arabia (until recently it was used in Arabia for scenting a bath). It is believed to be the Calamus of the Greeks and Romans.\n\nLemon Grass de Cochin Also called Oil of Inchy and Lemon Grass des Indes Orientales. An essential oil distilled from a grass, East Indian Lemon Grass (Cymbopogon flexuosus = Andropogon flexuosus), native to south India but cultivated elsewhere, including Vietnam, central America, the W. Indies and Madagascar. It has the scent of violets and lemons and is used in the perfume and soap industries. The oil from the wild plant, growing in India, is similar to Palma Rosa Oil.\n\nLemon Oil Also called Cedro Oil. An essential oil extracted by expression from the fruit peel of the Lemon tree (Citrus medica var. limonum = C. limon). The tree is believed to have originated in subtropical Asia, probably in northern India; it was introduced into Europe by the Arabs from about the 8th century AD, probably through Sicily and Spain, and is now found all round the Mediterranean, especially in Sicily and southern Italy, and in many other areas, notably California, where it was first grown in 1887. About 1000 lemons will yield 1 lb of oil. The oil is used in flavourings, liqueurs and medicines as well as in perfumery, soaps and cosmetics. Dried lemon peel is sometimes used in sachets and pot pourri. Lemon oil with an unusually delicate fragrance is obtained from the Yuzu Lemon tree of Japan. Lemon oil appears in a very large number of modern quality perfumes, giving top notes a fresh sparkle, and is particularly popular in men’s fragrances. Some examples of perfumes containing it are ‘Calandre‘.\n\nLentheric Founded in 1875 in Paris by a hairdresser, Gillaume Lentheric, who became a fashionable perfumer, the House of Lentheric is now one of the leading perfume and cosmetics companies in the world. In 1990 it was sold by the Beecham Group to its management. Its fragrances, designed for the middle market, include ‘Tweed’ (1933), ‘Just Musk’ (73), ‘Tramp’ (75), ‘Panache’ (77), ‘Mystique’ (81), ‘Joie de Vivre’ (85), ‘Style’ (87), ‘Fashion’ (89), ‘Panache Evening Edition’ (89) and ‘Fleur’ (91), together with a fragrance for men ‘Hallmark’ (86).\n\nLeonard A French fashion house which formed its own perfume company, Parfums Leonard, in 1969. It produced ‘Fashion’ in 1970, followed by ‘Eau Fraiche’ (74), Tamango’ (77), ‘Leonard pour Homme’ (80) and ‘Balahe’ (83).\n\n‘L’Heure Bleue‘ An innovative classic floral-oriental perfume by Guerlain dating from 1912 which was created by Jacques Guerlain. The effect is sweet and spicy. Bergamot, with hints of lemon, neroli, tarragon, coriander and sage, sets a fresh top note, giving way to a heart of carnation supported by jasmine, rose, orris, ylang-ylang and other fragrances on a base note principally comprising sandalwood and musk, but supported by, amongst others, St John’s wort. It is sold in a flacon by Baccarat.\n\nLight Notes The term light is used in perfumery to denote fragrances which have a fresh floral, citrus, fruity or green content without any sweet or balsamic elements.\n\nLilac A fragrant oil, also in perfumery called Syringa, which is obtained from the flowers of the Common Lilac (Syringa vulgaris) and related\n\nspecies, a shrub which originated in Iran and eastern Europe and is now grown widely in temperate regions. The oil is used in quality perfumes (e.g. ‘Chamade‘, ‘Soir de Paris’, ‘Florissa’ and ‘Tweed’).\n\nThe plant was introduced into Europe through Spain by the Arabs in about the 16th century and originally the flowers were used in pomanders. The extraction of this fragrance by volatile solvents was not possible until the discovery of carbon dioxide as a solvent (see Volatile Solvents). However, many lilac perfumes are now made synthetically from chemical substances. The dried flowers are used in sachets and pot pourri.\n\nLillie, Charles Sometimes regarded as the first professional British perfumer. He owned a shop in the Strand, London, in the early part of the 18th century and was the author of a book The British Perfumer.\n\nLily An essential oil used in perfumery is obtained from the flowers of two species of Lily: the Madonna Lily (Lilium candidum) (in the early days of Christianity it was dedicated to the Madonna as a symbol of purity), also called the Annunciation Lily and Bourbon Lily, a plant native to the Mediterranean area and S.W. Asia; and the Easter Lily (L. longiflorum), also of Mediterranean origin. Both these plants are cultivated widely, but the fragrance of lily in perfumery is nowadays mostly created synthetically, with the exception of some high-quality perfumes such as ‘Zinnia’.\n\nThe lily has been used in perfumery since ancient times. It was popular in Egypt, where a perfumed ointment was based on ‘the flowers of 2000 lilies’ (probably here the blue water lily), and the ancient Greeks used Madonna lilies to make a perfume called Susinon.\n\nLily of the Valley Also called Muguet, a perfume obtained from the highly scented flowers of Lily of the Valley (Convallaria majalis), a small plant native to Europe but now grown all over N. America and northern areas of Asia. The plant is also called May Lily, Convallaria, Our Lady’s Tears, Jacob’s Ladder and Male Lily. Country lore held that the fragrance of these flowers drew the nightingale towards his mate. There is no evidence of its use in perfumery in ancient times; the ‘Lily of the Valleys’ quoted in the Bible is thought to have been Hyacinth.\n\nIn early days Lily of the Valley fragrance could only be obtained by infusing the flowers into olive oil or sweet almond oil. In modern perfumery the perfume is extracted by volatile solvents as a concrete or absolute and no essential oil is distilled. It is usually sold with a synthetic (Hydroxy citronellal), which almost duplicates the fragrance, added up to 50%, and it is the resulting product which is properly known as Muguet. Muguet provides the most exquisite lily fragance available and is very highly regarded by perfumers. Some 14% of all modern quality perfumes contain it, for example ‘Opium’, ‘Roma‘ and ‘Florissa’, and it appears in some 10% of men’s fragrances.\n\nLime Oil An oil obtained both by expression and by distillation from the rind of the fruits of the Lime tree (Citrus medica var. acida), which is grown for this purpose principally in the W. Indies. The tree is indigenous to India. The oil, which is among those now modified for safety or environmental reasons (see Perfume Creation), is mostly used in flavouring, but it is also found in high-class perfumes (e.g. ‘Amouage’) and eau de colognes, especially those containing coriander. It is also a source of citral.\n\nLinaloe Oil Also called Rosewood Oil (q.v.), Bois de Rose Oil and Essence de Bois Rose. An essential oil with a balsamic, floral, slightly rose-like odour; it is steam-distilled from wood chips from a tree called Rose Femelle (Aniba rosaeodora = Aydendron rosaeodora), native to the lower Amazon area. It is used extensively in lily and lilac-type perfumes and in colognes.\n\nA similar oil with the same name is distilled in Mexico and the USA from the bark and fruits of the Linaloe Wood tree (Bursera delpichiana), also called the Mexican Linaloe Wood tree, native to Mexico. It is used in perfumes, soaps and cosmetics. The older trees of this species are preferred as they produce more oil.\n\nAnother form of Bois de Rose oil, also called Cayenne Linaloe Oil and Azelia Oil, is obtained from the Cayenne Linaloe tree (Aniba panurense) of Brazil.\n\nLinaloe Oil is an important source of linalol.\n\nLinalol An alcohol used in perfumery which is contained in Linaloe and some other essential oils, including linaloe wood, petitgrain, coriander and lavender. It has an attractive spicy-floral odour and is used in perfumes with honeysuckle, lilac or lily fragrances.\n\nLinear Fragrance A term which has recently come into use in perfumery to describe a new style of perfume which started to become popular in the late 1980s. Instead of the classical perfume structure of top, middle and lower notes (see Perfume Notes), linear fragrances are designed to produce a strong and instant effect which remains constant. This is mostly achieved with a floral bouquet (e.g. ‘Giorgio, Beverly Hills’, ‘Fendi’, ‘Carolina Herrera‘ and ‘C’est la Vie’), but in some cases with other effects (e.g. a spicy-fruity effect in ‘Poison’), in all cases supported by traditional woody, mossy or amber base notes.\n\nLinseed Oil Derived from the seed of Flax (Linum usitatissimum), a plant indigenous to temperate areas of Europe and Asia. In early times the oil was used as a lamp oil and in cooking. In ancient Egypt it provided a base oil for perfumes (see Egyptian Perfumes).\n\n‘L’lnterdit‘ Givenchy’s first perfume, launched in 1957 in tribute to Audrey Hepburn. A floral-aldehydic fragrance created by Roure perfumers. Top notes are pepper, clove and a touch of galbanum, amplified by aldehydes. The heart, containing mostly rose, jasmine and violet, is supported by base notes which include sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, iris, amber and frankincense.\n\nLippia Oil obtained from the leaves of several species of Lippia is used in perfumery. From Lippia citriodora comes Verbena Oil (q.v.). Of the other species the principal is Lippia dulcis, a shrub which grows up to 18 feet high in tropical America and Mexico.\n\nLitsea Cubeba Oil An essential oil with a coriander-like odour obtained by steam-distillation from the ripe fruit of a species of Litsea tree (Litsea cubeba = L. citrata = Tetranthera polyantha), native to S.E. Asia and China, where it is known as May-chang. The oil has an importance in perfumery as a raw material from which citral is obtained.\n\nLiving Flower Technology A technique recently developed by IFF which is designed to capture the exact fragrance of flowers. A single living flower is encapsulated in a vacuum for 6 to 12 hours and the fragrance emitted by it is then analysed on a gas liquid chromatograph, said to provide an exact chemical description of the aroma which can then be imitated synthetically. The technique has been used for some of the ingredients of quality perfumes (e.g. osmanthus, carnation and jasmine in ‘Red’ and others in ‘Eternity‘). It is now being extended to include herbs, spices and fruits.\n\nLlorente, Jacques A leading designer of perfume bottles. He has produced designs for, among others, Hermes, Louis Feraud, Van Cleef & Arpels and Worth.\n\nLongosa Oil An oil extracted from the fragrant flowers of a species of Hedychium (Hedychium flavum), native to N. India and cultivated for this oil on the island of Nosse Be, north of Madagascar. It has a peppery fragrance, with a background reminiscent of ylang-ylang, jasmine, orange blossom and tuberose.\n\nL’Oreal Based in Paris, L’Oreal is now the largest of all the conglomerates in the international toiletries, cosmetics and fragrances business. Its subsidiaries include Cacharel, Courreges, Giorgio Armani, Guy Laroche, Lancome, Ralph Lauren, Phas, Helena Rubinstein and Vichy.\n\n‘L’Origan’ A classic perfume introduced by Coty in 1905 which set a trend for floral perfumes of a sweet, spicy nature. The top note was chiefly bergamot, with underlying hints of mandarin, coriander, pepper and peach. The middle note containgd a blend of clove and carnation, with ylang-ylang, orchid, rose, jasmine and orris. In the woody lower notes sandalwood was supported by, among others, cedarwood, labdanum and musk.\n\nLoris Azzaro An Italian designer of fashion, fashion accessories and theatre costumes who established his business in Paris in 1965. In 1970 he marketed the perfume ‘Azzaro’, followed by ‘Azzaro 9’ (84) and a men’s fragrance ‘Azzaro pour Homme’ (78). All three are contained in bottles designed by Pierre Dinand.\n\n‘Lou-Lou’ An unusually strong oriental-floral perfume created by Jean Guichard of Roure for Cacharel, who launched it in 1987. Top notes of jasmine, orange blossom, cassie and ylang-ylang lead into a heart of heliotrope and musk, with base notes provided by tonka, vanilla, frankincense and sandalwood. The flacon, which is blue opaline, was designed by Annegret Beier.\n\nLotus A name given to perfumes with a heavy oriental-type fragrance made by compounding natural perfume materials such as patchouli, benzoin or storax with various modifying artificial ones. No perfume oil is extracted from the Lotus plant.\n\nLovage Also called Bladder Lovage, Cornish Lovage, Garden Lovage, Italian Lovage, Old English Lovage, Lovage Angelica and Sea Parsley. A perennial plant (Levisticum officinale = Angelica levisticum) growing up to 5 feet high, native to the Mediterranean area but now found widely and cultivated in England, France and elsewhere. An essential oil, known as Oil of Lovage, is distilled from the whole plant and has a limited use in perfumery as well as being used in flavouring. Its scent is spicy and persistent, reminiscent of a mixture of angelica or celery with oak moss. The dried roots and leaves, which have good fixative properties, are used in sachets and pot pourri.\n\nLovage was well known to the Greeks and Romans for its medicinal and flavouring properties and for its value in overcoming unpleasant odours.\n\nLow Note Also called Lower Note, Base Note, Back Note and Dry-off. A term used in perfumery to describe the third and last phase in the process of a perfume’s evaporation on the skin, when the most lasting ingredients, such as woody or animalic scents, become most discernible. The term also covers the ingredients which provide that effect.\n\n‘Lumiere‘ A fresh-floral quality perfume created by Nicolas Mamounas and perfumers of IFF for Rochas, who launched it in 1984. Green top notes, which include hawthorn, honeysuckle, coriander and orange flower, herald a middle note dominated by gardenia, jasmine and magnolia, with a base note built on sandalwood and ambergris. The bottle was designed by Carre Noir.\n\n‘Lutece‘ A quality floral perfume launched by Houbigant in 1986 and named after the early Roman name for Paris. The aldehydic floral top note includes rose, jasmine and lily of the valley, developing into a powdery, floral heart of rose and peony with a touch of mandarin. Amber heads the base notes.\n\n‘Macassar‘ The name of a trend-setting, spicy, leather-type fragrance for men introduced as an eau de toilette by Rochas in 1980. It was created by Nicolas Mamounas. Its main ingredients are bergamot and artemisia in the top note, jasmine, carnation, patchouli and vetivert in the middle note, and oak moss and leather-fragrance in the base.\n\nMacassar Oil An oil derived principally from the seeds of the Ceylon Oak (Schleichera trijuga), also called the Kussum tree and Malay Lacktree, of Malaysia and Indonesia, but in earlier times possibly from the seeds of safflower. It also contained ylang-ylang among its ingredients. It was widely used in Victorian times as a hair preparation, giving rise to the ‘anti-macassar’ used on chair backs, designed to protect upholstery against oily stains.\n\nMace (and Nutmeg) Mace, also called Macis and Arillus Myristicae, and Nutmeg both come from the fruit of the Nutmeg tree (Myristica fragrans =M. officinalis = M. aromatica). In French, muscadier (a name also used in English) is the nutmeg tree, muscade meaning nutmeg and also musk-like; our word nutmeg derives from an earlier word notemuge 一 early English ‘note’ = nut and early French mugue = musky. The tree, which grows to about 35 feet high, is native to the Molucca islands and is now cultivated in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Grenada, mainly for nutmeg used as a spice.\n\nNutmeg is the kernal of the fruit (or nut). Oil of Nutmeg is usually obtained from kernals unsuitable through damage etc. to be sold as a spice. The oil, expressed, steam-distilled or extracted, is used to give perfumes, colognes and lavender waters a spicy or masculine note, and it is found in many quality fragrances (e.g. ‘Blue Grass’, ‘Panthere’, ‘Sybaris’ and ‘You’re the Fire’). However, most distilled oil is used as a flavouring. The distilled oil is sometimes called Nutmeg Butter and, misleadingly, Oil of Mace. Mace is the wrapping (‘arillus’) round the kernal and provides a very similar, though less pungent, oil by distillation which is used occasionally in sandalwood-type soaps. Mace is also used dried in sachets and pot pouni. Nutmeg was known as early as Roman times, and the early Arab perfumers used both types of oil. Mace should not be confused with English Mace, a name sometimes given to costmary.\n\nMaceration Also called digestion. An ancient method of obtaining aromatic substances from flowers and other plant parts by boiling them or heating them to a high temperature in water or oil, which absorbed their aroma. It has the disadvantage that with many materials the heat will damage the fragrance. But the technique is still sometimes practiced in modern perfumery with certain materials, using oils or fats heated to about 60°-70°C, into which the materials are immersed up to 15 times for periods of an hour or two at a time, the fat then being cleansed of residue and purified. The principal materials still sometimes so treated are cassie, hyacinth, jonquil, mimosa, orange flower, rose, narcissus and violet.\n\n‘Madame Rochas‘ A classic aldehydic-floral perfume created by Guy Robert for Rochas, who first marketed it in 1960 and re-launched it in 1989. It has some 200 ingredients. The principal top notes are orange blossom, broom, honeysuckle and neroli, covering a floral heart dominated by ylang-ylang, tuberose, jasmine, orris and rose, with a woody base, chiefly sandalwood and cedar, backed by hints of musk and amber. The container is a replica of an 18th century scent bottle in crystal by Baccarat.\n\nMagalep Also called Mahaleb, Macalep, St Lucia Cherry, Hurtleberry, Austrian Cherry and Perfumed Cherry. A deciduous tree (Prunus mahaleb) growing up to 40 feet high in Europe and W. Asia and cultivated in Britain since the 17th century. The fragrant wood (called St Lucia Wood) is used for walking sticks, tobacco pipes, etc. and an essential oil is occasionally distilled from it for use in perfumery. The seeds (cherry stones) are used in sachets and pot pourri. In early times the flesh of the seeds was used in their recipes by Arab and Persian perfume makers, who knew it as mahlab. During the 17th century the seeds were threaded on cords as aromatic beads. The flesh in the seeds was at one time expressed for its juice, or ground into a pulp called Milk of Magalep, which was strained, mixed with other fragrant substances such as rosewater, and used in washballs.\n\nMagma From Greek, a thick unguent. The word was also applied to the dried dregs from old unguent bottles, which the Greeks and Romans collected and added to scented powders in order to improve their fragrance. (See Greek Perfumes.)\n\nMagnolia This name is used for many synthetic perfumes, usually containing jasmine, neroli and rose.\n\n‘Ma Griffe‘ A classic, trend-setting chypre perfume first produced by Carven in 1944. Created by Roure perfumers, the initial impact is green, with gardenia in the top notes modified by citrus, galbanum and clary sage. The floral middle notes, mostly jasmine and rose, are supplemented by, among others, sandalwood and vetivert. In the base notes, storax and oak moss predominate, with hints of cinnamon, benzoin, labdanum and musk. The cube-shaped bottle was designed by Jacques Bocquet.\n\nMalabathrum A perfume material used in unguents by the Romans (see Roman Perfumes) which was imported from N. India in considerable quantity and is referred to several times by Pliny. It is thought to have been a dried aromatic leaf from a species of cinnamon found in N. India and known as the Indian Cassia tree (Cinnamomum tamala). In Sanskrit it is called Tamala pattra, from which the word Malabathrum derives. The bark of this tree is still used as a substitute for cinnamon.\n\n‘Ma Liberte’ An unusual spicy-floral perfume created by Jean Kerleo and launched by Jean Patou in 1987. It has top notes which include lavender, clove, pepper and vanilla, leading to a heart of jasmine with cedar, vetivert and patchouli, on a powdery base note containing sandalwood, vanilla and musk.\n\nMamounas, Nicolas Chief perfumer for Rochas. His creations include ‘Mystere’, ‘Macassar’, ‘Globe‘. Founder of the School of Perfumery in Versailles.\n\nMandarin Oil An oil expressed from the fruit peel of two species of the Mandarin Orange tree (Citrus reticulata = C. nobilis and C. madurensis), which are cultivated in Italy, Sicily, Spain, Florida, Argentina and Brazil for this purpose. The oil, which has a fragrance similar to Sweet Orange Oil, is used in colognes and in some floral perfumes, including quality perfumes (e.g. ‘Mitsouko‘). The dried peel is used in sachets and pot pourri. The tree is native to Cochin-China, being brought to Europe and America in the 18th century. The leaves and twigs provide a kind of Petitgrain Oil.\n\nMansau, Serge A sculptor and prominent designer of contemporary scent bottles. He has designed, among others, for Cardin, Caron, Dior, Fath, Laroche, Leonard Molyneux, Oscar de la Renta, Patou, Revillon and Rochas.\n\nMarigold The orange-flowered Common Marigold (Calendula officinalis), native to S. Europe and the Middle East but now cultivated widely, provides from the flowers a small amount of essential oil, also called Calendula, which is produced as a concrete or absolute for use in perfumery. The dried flowers also have medicinal uses.\n\nCertain marigolds of the Tagetes genus also provide an essential oil, by steam-distillation from their seeds, called Taget or Tagetes Oil, which is used in perfumery. They include the French Marigold (Tagetes patula = T. minuta), also known as Indian Carnation, native to tropical America but now cultivated widely. Taget (or Tagette) Oil has an intense, cloying, fruity fragrance resembling apple, and is used in cosmetics and in many floral perfumes (e.g. ‘Lauren’, ‘Samba‘).\n\nMarjoram Also called Sweet Marjoram and Knotted Marjoram. A bushy annual herb (Origanum majorana = Majorana hortensis) growing to about 1 foot high, probably native to Portugal but now found throughout Europe, N. Africa and the Middle East and cultivated widely. Oil of Marjoram is steam-distilled from the leaves and used for flavouring and in perfumery. Its scent resembles a cross between mint and thyme with a trace of nutmeg. Some 150-200lb of the herb yield about lib of oil. The dried leaves are used in sachets and pot pourri. Oil of Marjoram is also distilled from the Wild Marjoram (Origanum vulgare), a perennial herb growing in Asia, Europe and N. Africa with a strong, fragrant balsamic odour. In France this oil, which too is occasionally used in perfumery, is known as ‘Marjolaine sauvage’, the oil from O. majorana being known as ‘Marjolaine douce’.\n\nThe name marjoram derives from Greek meaning ‘joy of the mountains’. The ancient Greeks, who believed that if it grew on a grave it augured happiness for the departed, used it extensively in medicines, flavouring and perfumery. It was the sampsuchum of the ancient Egyptians, who gave its name to a long-lasting unguent and a scented oil popular in classical times. Both the seeds and the leaves of marjoram were used by the early Arab perfume makers.\n\nAn oil called Oil of Marjoram is also obtained from the leaves of a small species of thyme called Mastic Thyme (Thymus mastichiana).\n\nMarsh Rosemary Oil An oil obtained from the leaves of the Marsh Rosemary (Ledum palustre), also known as Crystal Tea Ledum, one of the few plants which grows in Arctic as well as sub-Arctic regions. The leaves are also used by Eskimos as a tea. The oil has a bitter, coriander-like fragrance.\n\nThe name Marsh Rosemary is also sometimes used for American Sea Lavender (Statice caroliana), also called Ink Root, a sea-plant found on both sides of the Atlantic, from the roots of which a volatile oil is obtained for use in medicines.\n\nMary Chess A small high-quality perfume company founded in 1932 by Mrs Grace Mary Chess Robinson, an American living in London who was also known for her sculptured flowers. She created all her perfumes herself, using only natural ingredients. Her first perfume was ‘White Lilac’ (1933), followed by Tapestry’ (34), ‘Strategy’ (35), ‘Tuberose’ (37) and ‘Yram’ (38). In 1978 the company also launched ‘Chess d’Or’. The company produces a variety of other toiletries and holds royal warrants to supply the Queen Mother and other royalty. It is closely associated with the long-established fragrance firm Taylor of London, both being acquired in 1991 by The Fine Fragrances and Cosmetics Group (see also Caron).\n\nMastic Also called Gum Mastic, Sweet Assa and Resina Lentisci. A gum obtained from the bark of the Lentisk tree (Pistacia lentiscus), a small shrub-like tree growing up to 12 feet high in the Mediterranean area and parts of Asia. It was introduced into Britain in the 17th century. The main sources of commercial supply of this gum are the islands of Cyprus, Scio and, for many centuries, Chios. The fragrance is very balsamic, with a penetrating, leafy odour recalling savin and turpentine. In early times the gum was used in pomanders and the oil was used to absorb other plant fragrances in the process of enfleurage. In modern perfumery the extracted oil is used as a fixative in various perfume compounds; it appears, for example, in ‘Fahrenheit’.\n\nMate An absolute used in perfumery which is developed from oil extracted from the leaves of the Yerba Mate tree (Ilex paraguensis), also called the Paraguay Tea tree, found in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. It has a rich, tea-like fragrance. The plant has been used in S. America since ancient times as a source of tea.\n\nMatico A climbing shrub (Piper augustifolium), also called Matico Pepper and Soldier’s Herb, native to central America, Mexico and the W. Indies. The leaves provide an essential oil with an odour reminiscent of pepper, cubebs and mint. It is very powerful and hence used only in minute amounts, usually in carnation compounds. Matico was the name of a Spanish soldier who accidentally discovered the medical properties of the leaves when wounded in Peru.\n\nMattipaul A resin used for incense in Hindu temples. It is extracted from the trunk of the But tree (Ailanthus malabarica), also called the Thanh-that tree, found in India and Vietnam.\n\nMaudlin A perennial, sweet-scented yarrow (Achillea ageratum), also called Maudeline, Sweet Milfoil, Sweet Nancy, Camphor Plant, Balsamita Foemina and Sweet Yarrow. It grows up to 5 inches high and is native to Italy and Spain, being introduced into Britain from Italy in 1570 as a medicinal herb; during the 16th century it was a popular aromatic. The dried flowers and leaves are used in sachets and pot pourri to provide a balsamic note. It was at one time used with costmary to make washballs.\n\nMawah Oil The name given to a variety of rose-geranium oil obtained from Pelargonium graveolens, which is produced in Kenya.\n\nMax Factor Max Factor, a theatre wig-master and make-up artist in Tsarist Russia, emigrated to the USA in 1904, forming his company, Max Factor & Co, in 1909 to provide make-up for the Hollywood film industry. By 1930 the company was selling ‘Max Factor – the Make-up of the Stars’ in 81 countries. It was purchased by Norman Simon Inc. in 1972, became part of the International Playtex Group in 1983, merged with the Revlon Group in 1987 and was bought by Proctor & Gamble in 1991. The UK branch of the company was opened in 1935 and has its main factory in Bournemouth. In 1980 it acquired the fashion house of Mary Quant.\n\nThe principal Max Factor perfumes currently marketed are ‘Le Jardin de Max Factor’ (82) and ‘Le Jardin d’Amour’ (86). Other fragrances, sold at Eau de Toilette strength, include ‘Geminesse’ (74), ‘Blase’ (75) and ‘Epris’ (81), together with three fragrances, ‘Intuition’, ‘Charade’ and ‘Desire’, linked under the name ‘Liaisons’ and introduced in 1988.\n\nMeadowsweet Oil An oil used in perfumery which is distilled from the flower buds of the Meadowsweet plant (Filipendula ulmaria = Spiraea ulmaria), also called Queen of the Meadows, Dolloff, Bridewort and Ulmaria. It is native to temperate Europe and Asia and is also now found in N. America. The flowers have an almond-like scent. Queen Elizabeth I was particularly fond of it as a strewing herb. Gerard, writing in about 1600, observed that the smell of the leaves ‘makes the heart merry and delighteth the senses’. The dried leaves and flowers are used in sachets and pot pourri.\n\nMedici, Catherine de 1519-1589 The daughter of the Italian Duke of Urbino who in 1533 married the future King Henry II of France. She was the mother of three future kings and a powerful influence in the French court. She had a considerable interest in perfumery and brought an Italian with her who established a successful perfume-making business in Paris. She was instrumental in setting up a laboratory in Grasse for the study of perfume-making in order to rival the fashionable Arab perfumes of the time, for which she is regarded by some as the founder of the French perfume industry.\n\nMegaleion Perfume Also called Megalium. An ancient Greek perfume described by Theophrastus. It contained ‘burnt resin’ and oil of balanos (which was first boiled ‘for ten days and nights’), into which were mixed cinnamon, cassia and myrrh. A colourant was added. Theophrastus noted that this perfume and Mendesian perfume were the most troublesome to make, since they contained many costly ingredients. It was believed to be good for wounds. Being fairly heady it was, Theophrastus observed, best suited for women, especially as it was very long-lasting.\n\nThe Romans also used Megalium, which in Pliny’s time was composed of balanos oil, balsam, calamus, sweet-rush, xylobalsam, cassia and resin.\n\nMelia A species of Melia known as the Bead tree (Melia azedarach), native from N. India to Malaysia and W. China and now cultivated widely. The name derives from its pea-sized, musk-scented seeds, which are used to make rosary beads.\n\nMelilot Also called Sweet Clover. A sweetly scented, clover-like plant, growing up to 4 feet high, of the genus Melilotis, found widely in Europe and Asia, which is sometimes used in perfumery. The Common Yellow Melilot (Melilotis officinalis), also called Sweet Lucerne, Kings Clover, Wild Laburnum and Hart’s Tree, is found in Europe, temperate Asia and N. Africa and was once cultivated extensively in Britain for fodder. The White Melilot (M. alba) and Corn Melilot (M. aroensis) still grow wild in Britain but are less abundant. All three species have a sweet hay-like fragrance, remarkably attractive to bees (the name derives from ‘Mel’, meaning ‘honey’, and Lotus, hence signifying ‘honey-lotus’), due to a high content of coumarin. The dried flowers and leaves are used in sachets and pot pourri and sometimes to scent tobacco (also for flavouring cheese). A fourth species (M. bungiana = M. suavolens = M. graveolens) is found in S.E. Asia and the dried flowers are used as a source of coumarin.\n\nMelilot was known to the Romans (it is listed by Dioscorides) for its medicinal properties and was used by medieval Arab perfume makers.\n\nMelinum A perfume oil made from quince flowers which, according to Pliny, was used in unguents in conjunction with omphacium, cyprinum, sesame oil, balsam, sweet rush, cassia and southernwood.\n\nMelon A melon-like fragrance is occasionally used in modern quality perfumes (e.g. ‘Knowing‘). It is normally created with synthetics.\n\nMemecyclon The leaves of the tree Memecyclon tinctorium (= M. edule), found in regions bordering the Indian Ocean including Yemen and Ethiopia, provide a yellow dye which was held in such high esteem as a colouring agent by the early Arab perfume makers that al-Kindi even provided a recipe for imitating it.\n\nMendesian Perfume A perfume of the ancient Egyptians (see Egyptian Perfumes) originally made in the city of Mendes. It was popular also in Greece and Rome, the Greeks calling it ‘the Egyptian’. Theophrastus recorded that it contained a number of expensive ingredients, including cinnamon and myrrh, was colourless, and was one of the most long-lasting of all perfumes. He also observed that it could cause headaches, to counter which it was sometimes mixed with fragrant wine to make it sweeter. Pliny noted that it was made of ‘behen-oil, resin and myrrh’.\n\n‘Men’s Club‘ An eau de cologne introduced by Helena Rubinstein in 1966 for use by men. The fragrance is floral, with spicy aldehydes in the top note, rose and jasmine in the heart and musk and cedarwood in the base.\n\n‘Metal’ A fresh-floral perfume launched by Paco Rabanne in 1979. It was created by Firmenich perfumers. Citrus fruits in the top note introduce a floral bouquet in the heart which includes jasmine, ylang-ylang, narcissus and an unusual rose ingredient. Sandalwood provides the main base note. The perfume comes in a bottle designed by Pierre Bellereaud.\n\nMetallic Note A term used in perfumery to denote a fragrance reminiscent of metal, providing a clean, cool effect. Metallic notes are used in perfumes to assist in promoting an effect, not as main fragrances.\n\n‘Metamorphose’ A floral perfume created in 1979 by Jean Laporte, whose fragrances, which include a wide variety of quality toilet waters, soaps, burning oils, etc., are sold through his company L’Artisan Parfumeur in Paris and London. ‘Metamorphose’, a blend of 52 essences, contains top notes which include blackcurrant buds and tangerine, a heart mainly of rose, jasmine, iris and carnation, and a base dominated by sandalwood. It is sold in a flacon with an opalescent crystal stopper in the form of a butterfly.\n\nMethyl Salicylate The principal odorous constituent of Oil of Gaultheria(Wintergreen) and found in many other volatile oils. It provides a pungent, minty odour. It is now manufactured synthetically from coal tar and is much used in modern perfumery.\n\nMetopian Unguent A perfumed unguent of the ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans. It was based on oil of bitter almond and contained honey, wine, myrrh and calamus or, according to another source (Dioscorides), oil of bitter almond and unripe olives perfumed with cardamom, sweet rush, sweet flag, honey, wine, myrrh, seed of balsamum, galbanum and turpentine resin. Pliny recorded that the Roman version was pressed out of bitter almonds, with the addition of omphacium, cardamom, rush, flag, honey, wine, myrrh, seed of balsam, galbanum and terebinth-resin.\n\nMexican Mock Orange A shrub (Philadelphus mexicanus), also called Mock Orange Blossom, from the flowers and branches of which a scented water has been distilled since early times as a perfume. The fragrance resembles that of true orange blossom.\n\nMicro-fragrance Also called micro-encapsulation and ‘scratch-and-sniff’. A technique devised by the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. (3M) in 1970 by which large numbers of microscopic capsules containing a fragrance are coated on to paper, so that their odour is released when they are broken, e.g. by scratching with a fingernail. The system was first used to advertize a perfume by Coty. It has also been developed for use in a powdered form.\n\nMiddle Note Also called the Heart or Body. In perfumery this relates to the main fragrance of a perfume, which becomes dominant after the top notes have faded away on the skin. It usually consists of floral, spicy or woody components.\n\nMignonette Also called Reseda Oil. One of the principal essential oils of perfumery obtained from flowers. The plant (Reseda odorata), native of N. Africa, is an annual growing to about 2 feet high and now cultivated widely; it is grown commercially in the south of France for its oil. The oil, obtained from the flowers mainly by extraction with volatile solvents but sometimes by maceration or enfleurage, has a violet-like fragrance. While some 1200 kilos of flowers are needed to provide 1 kilo of concrete, the scent is so powerful that it can be used only in minute quantity and then at a strength of about 1 part to 500 parts of alcohol.\n\nThe name Reseda may derive from Latin resedo, meaning to heal; in Roman times the plant was regarded as a charm against various ailments. The name ‘mignonette’ signifies ‘little darling’. The plant was introduced into Britain in about 1750.\n\nThis plant should not be confused with the so-called Jamaica Mignonette, which is a variety of Henna.\n\nMilfoil Also called Yarrow, Common Yarrow, Soldier’s Wound Wort, Blood Wort, Sanguinary, Devil’s Nettle and by a number of other local names. A perennial herb (Achillea millefolium) found in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. Milfoil Oil, distilled from the leaves, is used medicinally as well as in perfumes; it has a pungent, spicy, rather medicinal fragrance. The dried flowers are used in sachets and pot pourri. In ancient times Milfoil was regarded as a plant of the Devil and used for divination in spells.\n\n‘Mille’ (‘1000’) A quality floral-woody perfume created for Jean Patou in 1972 by John Kerleo. The brand name is in the numeral form ‘1000’. Top notes of osmanthus and damask rose cover a floral heart containing jasmine, violet and rose (Centifolia), with a base of patchouli and sandalwood. The perfume is sold both in a flacon by Brosse and also in a jade green flaconette after the style of a Chinese snuff box.\n\nMimosa Oil The scent of the fragrant yellow flowers of the Mimosa tree (Acacia dealbata and A. floribunda), native to Australia but now cultivated widely, also called the Silver Wattle tree, is highly esteemed in perfumery. In the south of France, where the trees have been cultivated since about 1839, the perfume is extracted as a floral absolute by means of volatile solvents. Some 200 tons weight of mimosa flower heads were at one time being used in Grasse every year. Examples of modern quality perfumes containing mimosa are ‘Lauren’, ‘Nina’ and ‘Vanderbilt’.\n\nMint A perennial plant of many species of the genus Mentha, which grows widely. Mentha was a nymph in Greek mythology who was metamorphosed into the plant, and the name Mentha was originally used as a generic name by Theophrastus. Mints are frequently mentioned in Greek and Roman works for their value as strewing herbs and in medicines, flavourings and perfumes.\n\nOne of the most important species of mint for commercial uses at the present time is Spearmint (Mentha spicata = M. viridis), cultivated in China, Japan, Brazil and the USA for the essential oil (Spearmint Oil), obtained by steam-distillation from the flowering tops. Used mainly as a flavouring, this also helps to provide a ‘green’ note in perfumery (e.g. Turbulences’)\n\nOther mints used in perfumery are bergamot mint, pennyroyal and peppermint. The mint of the Bible was probably Horsemint (M. longifolia =M. sylvestris), found in Europe and N. Africa.\n\nMinty Note A term used in perfumery to describe a fragrance reminiscent of mint, e.g. peppermint or spearmint. Such fragances are usually used to provide a special, fresh effect in a Top Note.\n\nMirbane Essence Also called Oil of Mirbane. The first chemical perfume to be produced commercially, made from nitric acid and benzene (nitrobenzene). Devised in the 19th century, it had a fragrance crudely resembling sweet almonds, and was used for scenting soaps.\n\n‘Miss Dior’ A trend-setting chypre perfume brought out by Dior in 1947. The perfume was created for Dior by Paul Vacher. The top note is green and aldehydic, with suggestions of galbanum and bergamot. The heart is floral, with jasmine, rose and gardenia predominating. The base provides warm, woody and mossy touches, with patchouli, oak moss and ambergris the main constituents. The bottle was designed by Guericolas.\n\n‘Mitsouko’ The earliest of the chypre family of modern perfumes (see Perfume Families) after Coty’s original perfume named ‘Chypre’. ‘Mitsouko’ (the name means ‘mystery’) was created by Jacques Guerlain and brought out by Guerlain in 1919. It has fresh, fruity top notes derived from bergamot, with touches of lemon, mandarin, neroli and peach (the first use of a synthetic peach fragrance in a perfume). The heart is floral, based on jasmine, rose and ylang-ylang, but with a spicy touch derived from clove. The base notes include oak moss and benzoin, with hints of sandalwood, labdanum, myrrh, cinnamon and musk. The flacons are by Baccarat and Brosse.\n\nMock Orange Blossom Also called Mock Orange, German Jasmine, Seringa and occasionally Syringa. A shrub (Philadelphus coronarius) growing up to about 8 feet high and native to Italy and central Europe, but now grown widely (together with other related species of Philadelphus). The flowers have a strong fragrance reminiscent of the blossom of orange trees. An essential oil used in perfumery is obtained from the flowers and is used in modern quality perfumes (e.g. ‘C’est la Vie’). The flowers are also dried for inclusion in pot pourri. But the fragrance is more usually made by synthesis. This plant should not be confused with the Orange Blossom plant. The stems of both Mock Orange and Lilac are easily hollowed out by removing the pith, and they were once used for making flute-like musical instruments (Greek syrinx = a flute), giving rise to the name Syringa for both plants.\n\nMolinard A perfume house which commenced in 1849 as a small shop in Grasse selling ‘perfumed waters’; it set up its own distillery in 1894. Molinard’s prestigious clientele included Queen Victoria. In 1920 the company moved its headquarters to Paris and began to expand, but its factory remains in Grasse, where it also maintains a Museum of Perfume. Its perfume ‘Habanita’, launched in 1924, was an immediate success. Perfumes which followed included ‘Xmas Bells’ (26), ‘Calendar (29), ‘Le Baiser de Faune’ (30), ‘Les Iscles d’Or’ (30). ‘1811’ (30) and ‘Madrigal’ (35). Latterly it has produced ‘Nirmala’ (55), ‘Rafale’ (75), ‘Molinard de Molinard’ (80) and a men’s fragrance ‘Teck’ (90). Most of these were sold in flacons by Baccarat or Lalique.\n\n‘Molinard de Molinard’ A fruity green floral perfume introduced by Molinard in 1980. The top notes are dominated by galbanum and blackcurrant buds. The heart contains jasmine, rose, narcissus, ylang-ylang and lily of the valley, and the base note includes labdanum, frankincense, amber, vetivert and musk. It was presented in a flacon much sought after by collectors, known as ‘Beauty’, which features a relief decoration of water nymphs and was made by Lalique; this flacon was first used for the Molinard perfume ‘Les Iscles d’Or’ and has subsequently also been used for ‘Habanita’.\n\nMolyneux A couture house founded in Paris in 1919 by a British fashion designer Edward Molyneux (1891-1974), who won the MC during the Great War. He reopened his House in Paris after the Second World War, retiring in 1967, when his nephew assumed control of the company. It is now a part of the Sanofi group. The company launched its first perfume, ‘Vivre’, in the 1930s and this was relaunched in 1971, to be followed by ‘Quartz’ (77), ‘Gauloise’ (81), ‘Initiation’ (90), and a fragrance for men, ‘Captain’ (75).\n\n‘Mon Parfum’ A chypre perfume launched under the house name Paloma Picasso, in association with L’Oreal, in 1984. It was created by Creations Aromatiques perfumers. Top notes of ylang-ylang, lemon, bergamot, angelica and hyacinth lead into a heart mostly composed of jasmine and rose, with a woody base note obtained from oak moss, iris,sandalwood and patchouli supported by amber and musk. The flacon, an unusual design by Paloma Picasso and Bernard Kotyuk, consists of a bottle in a glass ring and is made by Brosse.\n\n‘Montana’ A quality perfume launched in 1987 by Montana Parfums, perfume house of Claude Montana, the prominent Paris fashion designer. Created by Roure perfumers and described as ‘avant garde chypre’, it contains a green, fresh, fruity and spicy mixture of top notes, including marigold, ginger, pepper, blackcurrant buds and orange flower, which herald a floral and woody heart of jasmine, rose, narcissus, patchouli, sandalwood and oak moss. Base notes include ambrein, musk, frankincense and leather-fragrance. The flacon, a design in spiral layers of frosted glass, won a French Glass Industry prize in 1988. In 1990 the company launched a spicy-woody men’s fragrance ‘Montana pour Homme’, containing tangerine, pepper and nutmeg in the top notes, geranium, nasturtium, patchouli and sandalwood in the middle notes and amber, frankincense and musk in the\n\nbase, and also ‘Parfum d’Elle’. Montana is now marketed in association with Charles of the Ritz, a part of the Revlon group.\n\nMontpellier A town in the S. of France near Marseilles which, in the 16th century, was prominent as a perfume-making centre and well known for its botanical gardens, where perfume plants were cultivated. Its importance faded as that of Grasse increased.\n\nMossy Note A term used in perfumery to describe the general odour of oils obtained from mosses and lichens (see Moss above). Such oils are used in all types of perfumes.\n\nMousseline An Indian perfume based on vetivert. The name derives from ‘muslin’, as it was once used to give Indian muslin a distinctive scent before being exported to European markets.\n\nMuscone A chemical obtained from musk and also made synthetically which has a significant value in perfumery because of its powerful properties as a fixative.\n\nMusk Probably the most powerful of all perfume fragrances, and certainly one of the most expensive. Musk comes from a preputial follicle which is removed from the abdomen of the male musk deer (Moschus moschiferus and three other species of Moschus), found in the Himalayas from Afghanistan to China. The follicle, usually known as a musk pod (or cod), is a sac about the size of a walnut and can be removed without harming the animal. The material extracted from the pod is in the form of solidified seeds (or grains). These contain the perfume in such concentrated form as to be most obnoxious unless diluted. Each pod holds less than loz of grains. The odoriferous principal in the seeds is a substance called Muscone, which forms about 2% of the whole seed. The perfume is prepared in the form of a tincture by treatment with alcohol. The best-quality musk, known as Tonquin musk, comes from China and Tibet. Other varieties bear the names Cabardine, Yunnan and Assam (or Nepal) musk. The pods are called either Blue Skin or Grain Musk, according to their appearance.\n\nMusk was unknown in classical times and reference to its use in perfumes does not appear until the 6th century, when Cosmas mentioned it as a product obtained from India. Soon afterwards both Arab and Byzantine perfume makers were employing it. There is a single and rather obscure reference to it in the Quran. Under the Abbasid Empire of the Arabs it was highly regarded, and the Caliphs of Baghdad (the ’emperors’) used it lavishly; al-Kindi (early 9th century) included it in a large number of his perfume recipes and it became one of the more important luxury items (with silk, camphor and spices) brought back by Arab ships from China. It had a reputation as an aphrodisiac. Musk has been a key constituent in very many perfumes ever since its discovery, being held to give a perfume ‘life’, and musk or synthetic musk is now found among the principal ingredients of about 35% of all quality perfumes and quality fragrances for men.\n\nSo potent is musk that it can only be used in extremely"
