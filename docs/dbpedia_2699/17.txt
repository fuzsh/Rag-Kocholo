Opoponax Essential Oil

Opoponax Essential Oil is an important aromatherapy oil for our emotional health. It is an ideal oil to use during stressful periods in our lives.

Opoponax Essential Oil is also known as Opopanax Essential Oil. But, more importantly, it is also known as Sweet Myrrh Essential Oil.

This is because Opoponax Essential Oil and Myrrh Essential Oil are both made from resin collected from Commiphora trees However, whilst they both offer a lot of similar benefits and their aroma is similar, there are differences between the two.

Aromatically, Opoponax Essential Oil is lighter and sweeter than Myrrh Essential Oil.

The reason there are some differences between the two oils is because Opoponax Essential Oil and Myrrh Essential Oil are made from the resin of two different varieties of tree within the same species.

Opoponax Essential Oil INCI: Commiphora Erythraea

Myrrh Essential Oil INCI: Commiphora myrrha oil

One of the unfortunate ways in which the two oils differ is that Opoponax Essential Oil is phototoxic and poses a moderate risk of skin sensitisation according to Robert Tisserand and Rodney Young

Myrrh Essential Oil does not have these drawbacks.
