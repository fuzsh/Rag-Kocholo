        "text": "There's quite the temptation to align this latest version of Charles Dickens' classic \"Oliver Twist\" with the other varied adaptations of literature filmed by 73-year-old Roman Polanski. Those would include \"Tess,\" \"The Pianist\" and \"Rosemary's Baby.\"\n\nBut you'd be just as correct to hand credit to 70-year-old Ronald Harwood, who adapted \"The Pianist,\" his own play of \"The Dresser\" as well as \"Being Julia,\" \"Cry, The Beloved Country\" and the classic \"High Wind in Jamaica.\"\n\nAt the very least, kudos for a first-rate adaptation should be shared by those two wily veterans, both of whom lend maturity without holding back on the spirit of outrage intended by Dickens, only 25 years old when he wrote it in 1837.\n\nCertainly, they had road maps -- \"Oliver Twist\" was staged at least 10 times before its initial appearance, in serial form, was complete; more than 20 film versions have appeared since 1906.\n\nPlaying Oliver is 12-year-old British actor Barney Clark, a lad able to convey the innocence, the wounded soul and the persistent optimism the character requires. Polanski and Harwood have Oliver define himself through action instead of dialogue, so that when he must speak -- as when he begs, \"Please, sir, may I have some more?\" -- his words pack a wallop.\n\nThe plot eliminates several Dickens subplots, focusing on Oliver's early mistreatment in the English workhouse system for managing the poor before shifting to the slums of London, where Oliver becomes a tool for Fagin and Fagin's school for underage thieves.\n\nThings get complicated when Fagin colleague Bill Sykes (Jamie Foreman) gets involved, but it's nothing a 10-year-old can't follow.\n\nIndeed, Polanski has said he made the film for his own children (look for little Elvis Polanski as \"Boy With Hoop\").\n\nAnd good triumphs over evil, in the form of Fagin, Sykes and Sykes protégé the Artful Dodger (\"Peter Pan\" veteran Harry Eden).\n\nSome controversy has arisen over Ben Kingsley's interpretation of Fagin, especially since it doesn't depart much from the anti-Semitic insinuations of Alec Guinness' Fagin in David Lean's 1948 version.\n\nThe controversy doesn't amount to much, especially since this Fagin, under a half-gallon of makeup, might just as well be played by Angelina Jolie as Kingsley. More to the point is whether this Fagin keeps the story moving, and Kingsley manages that quite well.\n\nConsidering that nobody asked for yet another version after Lean's, this remake is remarkable primarily for being another remake. It's solid, faithful and properly sentimental, and just what we'd expect from a well-experienced team of professionals adapting a well-worn classic yarn.\n\nAnd while that doesn't lend itself to surprise, it does give us another sturdy take on a timeless story. We can wait another 50 years or so until we need one again.\n\nOliver Twist Stars Ben Kingsley, Barney Clark, Jamie Foreman, Harry Eden and Edward Hardwicke. Written by Ronald Harwood. Directed by Roman Polanski. 130 min. Rated PG-13. Grade: B+\n\nREVIEW"
