        "text": "Early life\n\nKingsley was born Krishna Pandit Bhanji (Gujarati: àªà«àª·à«àª£àª¾ àªªàªàª¡àª¿àª¤ àª­àª¾àª£àªà«) on 31 December 1943, in Snainton, North Riding of Yorkshire.[4][5][6] His mother, Anna Lyna Mary (nÃ©e Goodman), was an English actress and model; she was born out of wedlock, and \"was loath to speak of her background\".[7][8][9][10] His father, Rahimtulla Harji Bhanji, was born in the East Africa Protectorate (which later became, in 1920, the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya) to a family from the Indian city of Jamnagar, of Khoja Gujarati descent.[11][12] Kingsley's paternal grandfather, Harji Bhanji, was a successful spice trader who had moved from India to the Sultanate of Zanzibar, where Kingsley's father lived until moving to the United Kingdom at the age of 14.[13][14][15] Kingsley's maternal grandfather was believed by the family to have been of Russian- or German-Jewish descent, while his maternal grandmother was English and worked in the garment district of London's East End.[16] Kingsley stated in 1994, \"I'm not Jewish, and though there might be some Russian-Jewish heritage way back on my mother's side, the thread is so fine there's no real evidence.\"[17] In a 2016 interview, he indicated that his maternal grandmother was impregnated by a Russian Jewish immigrant who later abandoned her, which led her to become a \"vile anti-Semite.\"[18]\n\nKingsley grew up in Pendlebury, Lancashire. Although Kingsley's father was a Gujarati Khoja who practiced Isma'ili Islam, Kingsley himself was not raised in his father's faith, and identifies as a Quaker.[19][18] He was educated at the Manchester Grammar School, where one of his classmates was actor Robert Powell.[20] Kingsley went on to study at De La Salle College in Salford, which later became home to The Ben Kingsley Theatre. While at college, he became involved in amateur dramatics in Manchester, making his professional stage debut on graduation, aged 23.\n\nCareer\n\n1967â1981: Stage work and early career\n\nAfter graduating, in 1966, Kingsley was approached by music producer and manager Dick James. James, who was the publisher of The Beatles, offered to mould Kingsley into a pop star. Kingsley declined James' offer, and instead chose to join the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1967 after an audition before Trevor Nunn.[21]\n\nDevoting himself almost exclusively to stage work for the next 15 years, he made his West End debut for the company at the Aldwych Theatre in 1967 in a production of As You Like It.[22] Further productions for the RSC included Much Ado About Nothing, Richard III, The Tempest, A Midsummer Night's Dream (starring in Peter Brook's acclaimed 1970 RSC production as Demetrius), Hamlet and The Merry Wives of Windsor.[22]\n\nIn the 1960s, Kingsley anglicised his name to Ben Kingsley, fearing that a foreign name would hamper his career.[23][24] He told the Radio Times, \"As soon as I changed my name, I got the jobs. I had one audition as Krishna Bhanji and they said, 'Beautiful audition but we don't quite know how to place you in our forthcoming season.' I changed my name, crossed the road, and they said when can you start?\"[25] Kingsley went on to play Mosca in Peter Hall's 1977 production of Ben Jonson's Volpone for the Royal National Theatre. He also starred in the role of Willy Loman in a 1982 Sydney production of Death of a Salesman opposite Mel Gibson.\n\n1982â1998: Transition to film and television\n\nKingsley began his transition to film roles early on, starting with Fear Is the Key in 1972. Kingsley continued to play bit parts in both film and television, including a role as Ron Jenkins on the soap opera Coronation Street from 1966 to 1967 and regular appearances as a defence counsel in the long-running British legal programme Crown Court. In 1975, he starred as Dante Gabriel Rossetti in the historical drama The Love School and appeared in the TV miniseries Dickens of London the following year.\n\nA turning point in Kingsley's career came with the biographical film Gandhi (1982), directed by Richard Attenborough, in which Kingsley played the titular role of Gandhi. The film was a critical and financial success, and Kingsley won the Academy Award for Best Actor, the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor â Motion Picture Drama for his performance.[23]\n\nThroughout the 80s, Kingsley appeared in a variety of films, including supporting roles in Turtle Diary (1985) and Maurice (1987). He played the main character of Basil Pascali in Pascali's Island (1988), and went on to portray Dr. John Watson alongside Michael Caine's Sherlock Holmes in Without a Clue that year. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of the organized crime figure Meyer Lansky in Bugsy (1991). Additional roles include the supporting character of Cosmo in the thriller film Sneakers (1992), Vice President Gary Nance in Dave (1993), and the chess teacher Bruce Pandolfini in Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993).\n\nIn Steven Spielberg's historical drama film Schindler's List (1993), Kingsley portrayed the Holocaust survivor Itzhak Stern alongside Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler. The film was a critical and commercial success, and Kingsley received a nomination for BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Further roles include the BBC adaptation of Silas Marner (1985) as the titular character. Kingsley starred alongside Sigourney Weaver in Death and the Maiden (1994), having previously acted with her in Dave.\n\nIn 1997, he provided a voice in the video game Ceremony of Innocence. In 1998, he was the head of the jury at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival and starred in the family film Spooky House, saying he had chosen a role in a lighter film after acting in roles that left him feeling traumatized.[26][27]\n\n1999âpresent: Further success\n\nKingsley took on the role of Don Logan, a violent psychopath and recruiter for London's underworld, in Jonathan Glazer's Sexy Beast (2000), a psychological black comedy crime film. Kingsley's role as Logan earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. A year later, he won a Crystal Globe award for having an outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival.[28] He earned another Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his role as Colonel Massoud Amir Behrani in House of Sand and Fog (2003), and played a supporting role as Benjamin O'Ryan in Suspect Zero (2004). Although the film received negative reviews from critics, reservations were made for Kingsley's performance.\n\nIn July 2006, Kingsley received an Emmy nomination for his performance in the made-for-TV film Mrs. Harris, in which he played famed cardiologist Herman Tarnower, who was murdered by his jilted lover, Jean Harris. Later that year, he appeared in a cameo appearance in an episode of The Sopranos. The episode, titled \"Luxury Lounge\", features Kingsley playing himself; in the episode, Chris and Little Carmine pitch the role of a mob boss in the film Cleaver to Kingsley, which he turns down. In 2007, Kingsley appeared as a Polish American mobster in the Mafia comedy You Kill Me, and a hitman in War, Inc.\n\nThe years 2010 and 2011 contained several big roles for Kingsley. In 2010, he worked voicing a character named Sabine in the Lionhead Studios game Fable III and starred alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in Shutter Island (2010), directed by Martin Scorsese. That same year, Kingsley made his Bollywood debut in the thriller Teen Patti (2010). In 2011, he appeared in Scorsese's next film, Hugo (2011), playing the French illusionist Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s. Kingsley's portrayal of MÃ©liÃ¨s also earned him a Saturn Award for Best Actor. Kingsley also signed on to the sci-fi romance feature Broken Dream. The feature, by Neil Jordan and John Boorman, was later scrapped.[29]\n\nIn 2013, Kingsley appeared as the villain Trevor Slattery in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Iron Man 3, and as the hero Mazer Rackham in Ender's Game. A year later he played the Hebrew slave Nun in Ridley Scott's Exodus: Gods and Kings and Merenkahre, a simulacrum of an Egyptian pharaoh and father of Ahkmenrah, in Shawn Levy's Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb[30] That same year, Kingsley would also reprise his role as Slattery in the direct-to-video short film All Hail the King.\n\nIn 2015, Kingsley portrayed a Sikh driving instructor in the film Learning to Drive.[31] He voiced Bagheera in the live-action adaptation of Jon Favreau's The Jungle Book (2016), a remake of the original 1967 film.[32] Kingsley also recorded Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi in book-on-tape format. In 2018, he narrated Amazon Prime's documentary All or Nothing: Manchester City which followed Manchester City's record breaking 2017â18 Premier League campaign.[33] and served as the voice of General Woundwort in the BBC adaptation of Watership Down.[34] Kingsley reprised his role as Trevor Slattery in the film Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021).[35]\n\nHonours\n\nIn 1984, Kingsley won a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word or Nonmusical Recording for The Words of Gandhi, received an honorary degree from the University of Salford,[41] and was awarded the Indian civilian honour Padma Shri.[42] He was made a Knight Bachelor in the 2002 New Year Honours for services to the British film industry.[1][43] The award was announced on 31 December 2001, which happened to be Kingsley's 58th birthday.[44] After being knighted by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, Kingsley stated:\n\nI told the Queen that winning an Oscar pales into insignificanceâthis is insurmountable. I'm fascinated by the ancient, by mythology, by these islands and their tradition of story telling. I feel that I am a story teller and to receive a knighthood is really recognition of that.[1]\n\nHis demand to be called 'Sir' in film and TV show credits was documented by the BBC, to some criticism.[45] Co-star PenÃ©lope Cruz was reportedly unsure what to call him during the filming of Elegy as someone had told her she needed to refer to him as \"Sir Ben\". One day it slipped out as such, and she called him that for the remainder of the shoot.[46] Kingsley has denied accusations that he prefers to be referred to by his title, saying, \"If I've ever insisted on being called 'Sir' by colleagues on a film set then I am profoundly sorry. I don't remember ever doing that and I tend not to forget.\"[47] In May 2010, Kingsley was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[2] In April 2013, Kingsley was honoured with the Fellowship Award at The Asian Awards in London.[48]"
