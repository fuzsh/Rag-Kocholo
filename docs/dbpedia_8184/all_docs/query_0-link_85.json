        "text": "Disney are apparently remaking Oliver Twist with a little help from Ice Cube.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the remake will be ‘a modern and musical take’ on the classic Charles Dickens tale about an orphan boy who joins a gang of pickpockets in London.\n\nSources have told the website that it will ‘cross many genres’ in terms of music, with some hip-hop thrown in courtesy of the N.W.A. rapper who is reportedly set to play Fagin, the gang leader. He is also said to be producing with his company Cube Vision.\n\nCube’s producing credits include the critically acclaimed N.W.A. biopic Straight Outta Compton, buddy comedy Ride Along 2 and comedy Fist Fight set for release next year.\n\nDisney have previous when it comes to Oliver Twist, with 1988’s animated (and awesome) adventure Oliver And Company. In that film Oliver was a cat who fell in with a group of dogs.\n\nOliver Twist was last remade in 2005 by director Roman Polanski, starring Ben Kingsley as Fagin, however the film most will remember is the 1968 musical Oliver! starring Oliver Reed and Mark Lester.\n\nMORE : We’re totally on board with this Disney and Lazy Oaf collaboration"
