        "text": "A shame so little time is spent on the mystery of Oliver's identity that hugely accentuates the pathos for his character.\n\nJuly 16, 2021\n\nPolanski's Oliver Twist is a flawed but harrowing, empathetic view of the world seen through the eyes of its most powerless and invisible citizens.\n\nJanuary 30, 2020\n\nPolanski and Harwood have streamlined the meandering narrative to Dickens' second novel, which may horrify purists, but which works well enough for the filmmakers' purposes.\n\nApril 27, 2019\n\nCertainly Polanski deserves our gratitude for obliging the cast not to sink their teeth too deep into Dickens' juicy dialogue.\n\nOctober 17, 2018\n\nA smorgasbord of urban decay, social disorder, and class conflict imbues the film with a potent sensuality\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nOliver Twist is an affecting and refreshing adaptation of Dickens seminal work from a master director.\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nPolanski has crafted something that already feels like a classic film, beautiful to look at, combining accurate period detail with a certain gothic expressionism and brimming with earthy characters and high drama.\n\nJune 21, 2017"
