Sir Ben Kingsley was born as Krishna Bhanji in England on New Year’s Eve, 1943. He began acting on film and in the theater as a young man, he changed his name to Ben Kingsley in the hopes of furthering his career.

He appeared in British movies and TV shows in the ‘70s. His big break came with the starring role in Ghandi (1982), which is quite possibly still his best-known work. He won an Academy Award for Best Actor, and was critically acclaimed for his work.

Kingsley has had a varied career. He’s played Silas Marner in Silas Marner: The Weaver of Raveloe (1985), and Dr. Watson in Without a Clue (1988), a Sherlock Holmes comedy starring Michael Caine. His role in Bugsy (1991) earned him another Academy Award nomination. In 1993 he appeared in three distinctly different films; the chess film Searching for Bobby Fischer, the presidential comedy Dave, and Steven Spielberg’s Holocaust film, Schindler’s List.

Kingsley portrayed Anne Frank’s father in Anne Frank: The Whole Story (2001). He was nominated for his third Academy Award (for Best Supporting Actor) with his role in Sexy Beast (2001). Another Academy Award nomination followed with House of Sand and Fog (2003).

Kingsley makes a great antagonist, appearing in the children’s films Tuck Everlasting (2002) as the Man in the Yellow Suit, and playing The Hood in Thunderbirds (2004). He played the leader of the pick-pocketing crew, Fagin, in the 2005 adaptation of Oliver Twist.
