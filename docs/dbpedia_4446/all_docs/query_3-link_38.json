        "text": "How we deliver our services\n\nScotland may be a small country, but it’s also diverse. We recognise that a one-size-fits-all approach to the delivery of fire and rescue provision is unlikely to meet the needs of all our communities. That’s why front-line services are delivered locally from three strategically positioned hubs based in the North, West and East of the country.\n\nAccess the Local Service Delivery maps for your area:\n\nNorth Service Delivery Area map\n\nEast Service Delivery Area map\n\nWest Service Delivery Area map\n\nLocal Enforcement Delivery Plans (LEDP)\n\nLEDPs provide information on how we are engaging with businesses in your area.\n\nThey are fundamental in delivering our risk based inspection programme and prioritising enforcement activities in accordance with the Fire Safety Enforcement (Protection) Framework for Scotland 2021.\n\nThis approach will ensure that the service we deliver is driven by consultation in line with SFRS expectations and ensures our staff safely, effectively and efficiently support the communities we serve. LEDPs are subject to regular review and are adaptable to target emerging risks and support developments in the Service’s strategy for delivering fire safety enforcement.\n\nSenior service personnel\n\nHeads of service delivery\n\nThere are three deputy assistant chief officers working as heads of service delivery across each hub. To achieve this, they work closely with local senior officers, local authorities and strategic partners to support the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service’s key objectives of creating safer communities for everyone who lives, works and travels in Scotland.\n\nLocal senior officers (LSOs)\n\nThey work hard to create strong relationships with local councils and our other community partners to continue the provision of dedicated local fire and rescue services.\n\nLSOs work with local authorities and partners to provide effective links with local communities and ensure that the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service deliver the benefits of fire reform at a local level. This includes the protection of local frontline services and a commitment to build on the positive outcomes that have already been delivered as individual fire and rescue services, for people to be safer, particularly from fire but also from other emergencies that may occur across the country.\n\nLSOs ensure that communities across Scotland have a more equitable access to the full range of specialist fire and rescue service resources including water rescue, rope rescue, Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) and the personnel, equipment, training and facilities to deal with a wide range of issues from fires, road traffic collisions, major weather related events, the potential risks from a terrorist attack, significant industrial accidents and Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) response.\n\nThey also oversee the Prevention and Protection agenda for their respective areas ensuring that the public have access to the full range of community safety support from free home fire safety visits to specialist advice for individuals and organisations."
