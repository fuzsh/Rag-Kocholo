Its principal towns include Ayr, Kilmarnock and Irvine. The town of Troon on the coast has hosted the British Open Golf Championship twice in the last seven years and eight times in total. Approximately 200,000 visitors came to Troon during the 2004 Open. It was the members of Prestwick Golf Club who first created the British Open Championship in 1860[1] with the club hosting the event twenty-four times up until 1925.\n\nAyrshire, under the name the County of Ayr, is a registration county. The electoral and valuation area named Ayrshire covers the three council areas of South Ayrshire, East Ayrshire and North Ayrshire, therefore including the Isle of Arran, Great Cumbrae and Little Cumbrae. The three islands were part of the County of Bute until 1975 and are not always included when the term Ayrshire is applied to the region. The same area is known as Ayrshire and Arran in other contexts.\n\nAyrshire is one of the most agriculturally fertile regions of Scotland. Potatoes are grown in fields near the coast, using seaweed-based fertiliser, and in addition the region produces pork products, other root vegetables, cattle (see below) and summer berries such as strawberries are grown abundantly.\n\nAyrshire shares with Dumfries and Galloway some wonderful rugged hill country known as the Galloway Hills. These hill lie to the west of the A713 (Ayr to Castle Douglas road) and they run south from the Loch Doon area almost to the Solway Firth. To the east of this route through the hills lie the Carsphairn and Scaur Hills which lie to the south east of Dalmellington and south of New Cumnock. Glen Afton runs deep into these hills.\n\nThe area used to be heavily industrialised, with steel making, coal mining and in Kilmarnock numerous examples of production-line manufacturing, most famously Johnnie Walker whisky. In more recent history, Digital Equipment had a large manufacturing plant near Ayr from about 1976 until the company was taken over by Compaq in 1998. Some supplier companies grew up to service this site and the more distant IBM plant at Greenock in Renfrewshire. Scotland's aviation industry has long been based in and around Prestwick and its international airport, and although aircraft manufacture ceased at the former British Aerospace plant in 1998, a significant number of aviation companies are still based on the Prestwick site. However, unemployment in the region (excluding the more rural South Ayrshire) remains high, above the national average.\n\nThe area became part of the kingdom of Scotland during the 11th century. In 1263, the Scots successfully drove off of the Norwegian leidang-army in a skirmish known as the Battle of Largs.\n\nA notable historic building in Ayrshire is Turnberry Castle, which dates from the 13th century or earlier, and which may have been the birthplace of Robert the Bruce.\n\nThe historic shire or sheriffdom of Ayr was divided into three districts or bailieries which later made up the county of Ayrshire. The three districts were:\n\nCarrick in the south. It was situated between the Doon and the wild district of Galloway in the adjoining Stewartries, an area that was little else than a vast tract of hills and mosses.[2]\n\nKyle in the centre, which included the royal burgh of Ayr, occupied the central district between the Irwine on the north, and the Doon on the south and south-west, an area that is partly mountainous. It was subdivided into \"Kyle Stewart\",[3] (sometimes called \"Stewart Kyle\"[2] or \"Walter's Kyle\"[4]) and \"King's Kyle,\" the former embracing the country between the Irvine and the Ayr; and the latter, the triangular portion between the Ayr and the Doon, which is honoured as the birth-place and youthful home of Robert Burns.[2]\n\nCunninghame in the north which included the royal burgh of Irvine was that part of the county which lay north of the Irvine water, and was in an area that is generally level and fertile.[2]\n\nThe Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889 established a uniform system of county councils in Scotland and realigned the boundaries of many of Scotland’s counties.\n\nGlasgow Prestwick International Airport, serving Glasgow, is located in Ayrshire. It has a niche in rock history as the only place in Britain visited by Elvis Presley, on his way home from Army service in Germany in 1960.\n\nHistory[]\n\nSee also: Local government of Scotland\n\nAyr county council was created in 1890, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889. In 1930 the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929 was implemented. This re-designated the Burghs into large burghs and Small Burghs. This new categorisation influenced the level of autonomy that the Burghs enjoyed from the county council. The act also abolished the parish as a unit of local government in Scotland. In Ayrshire in excess of 30 parishes were consolidated into ten district councils.\n\nIn May 1975 the county council was abolished and its functions transferred to Strathclyde Regional Council. The county area was divided between four new districts within the two-tier Strathclyde region: Cumnock and Doon Valley, Cunninghame, Kilmarnock and Loudoun and Kyle and Carrick. The Cunninghame district included the Isle of Arran, Great Cumbrae and Little Cumbrae, which had until then been administered as part of the County of Bute.\n\nIn 1996 the two-tier system of regions and districts was abolished and Ayrshire was divided between the unitary council areas of East Ayrshire (covering the area of the former Kilmarnock & Loudon District and Cumnock & Doon Valley District), North Ayrshire (covering the area of the former Cunninghame District Council) and South Ayrshire (covering the area of the former Kyle and Carrick District).\n\nParliamentary constituencies[]\n\nThere was an Ayrshire constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1801 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 until 1868, when the constituency was divided into Ayrshire North and Ayrshire South.\n\nDuring the whole of the 1708 to 1868 period, and until 1950, the burghs of Ayr and Irvine were parliamentary burghs, represented as components of Ayr Burghs. In 1832 Kilmarnock became a parliamentary burgh, to be represented as a component of Kilmarnock Burghs until 1918. Ayr Burghs and Kilmarnock Burghs were districts of burghs, and quite different in character from later Ayr and Kilmarnock constituencies.\n\nFrom 1918 to 1983 Ayrshire and Buteshire were treated as if a single area for purposes of parliamentary representation, with their combined area being divided into different constituencies at different times. Scottish local government counties were abolished in 1975, in favour of regions and districts, but the next reform of constituency boundaries was not until 1983.\n\nConstituencies covering Ayrshire may be listed by periods as below, but the story is somewhat more complicated than the lists may imply: until 1918, Ayr Burghs and Kilmarnock Burghs included burghs lying outside both Ayrshire and Buteshire; a particular constituency name may represent different boundaries in different periods; in 1974, there were boundary changes without the creation of any new constituency names.\n\nPeriod Constituencies 1708 to 1832 Ayrshire and Ayr Burghs 1832 to 1868 Ayrshire, Kilmarnock Burghs and Ayr Burghs 1868 to 1918 North Ayrshire, Kilmarnock Burghs, Ayr Burghs and South Ayrshire 1918 to 1950 Bute and Northern Ayrshire, Kilmarnock, Ayr Burghs and South Ayrshire 1950 to 1983 Bute and Northern Ayrshire, Central Ayrshire, Kilmarnock, Ayr and South Ayrshire\n\nTowns and villages in Ayrshire[]\n\nRivers in Ayrshire[]\n\nThe main rivers flowing to the Clyde coast are, from north to south, the following:\n\nInteresting places[]\n\nSome notable people born in Ayrshire[]\n\nHew Ainslie (1792-1878), poet[5]\n\nSir Thomas Brisbane (1773-1860), Scottish soldier and colonial administrator, after whom the city of Brisbane is named.\n\nJohn Boyd Orr (1880-1971), Nobel Peace Prize winner\n\nRobert the Bruce (1274-1329), possibly at Turnberry Castle.\n\nRobert Burns (1759-1796), poet, in Alloway;\n\nKenneth Campbell (1917-1941), RAF pilot, posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross, born in Ardrossan.\n\nRobert Craufurd (1764-1812), British Major-General;\n\nThomas Craig (1855-1900), noted professor of mathematics, editor, and author.[5]\n\nJohn Dunlop (1840-1921), Scottish inventor of the pneumatic tire, in Dreghorn.\n\nAndrew Fisher (1862-1928), 5th Prime Minister of Australia 1908-1909, 1910-1913, 1914-1915;\n\nSir Alexander Fleming (1881-1955), inventor/discoverer of penicillin, in Darvel;\n\nJohn Galt (1779-1839), author.\n\nDrew Galloway (1985-), professional wrestler on WWE's Raw brand as Drew McIntyre.\n\nAir Chief Marshal Angus Houston, current Australian Chief of Defence Force Emigrated to Australia in 1968\n\nGeorge Houston (painter) (1869-1947), landscape painter of Scottish locales;[6]\n\nTom Hunter, entrepreneur and philanthropist\n\nMacdonald Brothers, recording artists and contestants on The X Factor\n\nJohn McAdam (1756-1836), engineer, responsible for a system of road design;\n\nJames McCosh (1811-1894), noted philosopher of the Scottish School of Common Sense and president of what would be Princeton University.[5]\n\nJames McCosh Clark (1833–1898), Mayor of Auckland\n\nJai McDowall (1986-), winner of Britain's Got Talent in 2011\n\nWilliam McIlvanney, writer.\n\nSir Thomas McKillop, (1943-) CEO of AstraZeneca, born in Dreghorn\n\nJames Henry McLean (1806-1886), born in Ayrshire, physician and United States Congressman from Missouri.[5]\n\nColin Mochrie (born 1957) Scottish /Canadian Improvisational Comedian and Actor (Best known for being in Whose Line Is It Anyway?)\n\nWilliam Murdoch (1754 - 1839), Inventor of gas lighting and Engineer.\n\nSimon Neil (1979-), James Johnston, and Ben Johnston of Biffy Clyro.\n\nBill Shankly (1913-1981), successful football manager\n\nRobert Simson (1687-1768), noted mathematician and professor of mathematics for 50 years\n\nDavid Thomson (1955- ), philosopher\n\nSam Torrance (1953- ), professional golfer born in Largs.\n\nMalcolm Wallace, Father of William Wallace one of Scotland's greatest national heroes, in Riccarton, Kilmarnock.\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nSouth Ayrshire Council\n\nAyrshire & Arran Tourist Board\n\nCoordinates:"
