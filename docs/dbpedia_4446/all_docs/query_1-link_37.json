        "text": "Founded in 1962, Loganair is the longest-serving airline operating under its own name in the UK.\n\nLike many inventions and innovations before it, the airline was founded out of necessity. For as the story goes, a construction firm upon being let down by a charter airline, took things into their own hands and set up an airline. Today it’s still going strong.\n\nEver since those early days, the company’s pioneering spirit has set it on a distinct course. In this issue, Loganair’s Managing Director Jonathan Hinkles explains how they’ve changed tack over the years and where they’re setting course for next.\n\n“We have a tremendously strong and loyal customer base in the Highlands and Islands from Stornoway to Shetland. Our lifeline services are those of which I’m most proud. In 1967 we began regular flights between the Orkney Islands, then to the Shetland Isles in 1970 and we’ve never looked back.\n\n“The smallest community we serve is North Ronaldsay, with a population of 30 people to which we operate three flights a day using an eight seater plane. During the winter months, when the ferries can’t operate, we take the seats out and fill the space with essential supplies for the Islanders.\n\n“We’re very conscious that there are rural communities highly dependent on our services. Our strong social obligation is at the heart of our services and it extends from these lifeline services to all the flying we do. When we have committed to something we do it.\n\n“There’s a perception that we’re reliant on government subsidy, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. In fact, subsidy makes up just 5% of our revenue, so the airline has to work commercially to survive.\n\n“We have to stand on our own two feet and make the business viable, so in this respect, we are different from some of the ferry and train operators in Scotland. We put a lot of time and effort into getting the balance right. If we run flights with no passengers on the majority of our routes, we have no revenue.\n\n“In addition to our public services, we run charter flights for the oil and gas industry and premiership football teams, amongst other businesses. We’re also one of only two airlines operating services for the Royal Mail.\n\n“Flying four aircraft to Scotland’s Islands to deliver the post each day is a really important part of what we do. You can post a letter in Exeter which will reach Inverness later that day before being flown out to the Islands early the next morning.\n\n“We employ 800 people, the vast majority of whom are based in Scotland, including a significant number in the Highlands and Islands. As one of the largest employers in the country, we are contributing to the economy and supporting local communities.\n\n“We have pilots and engineers based in Inverness and Aberdeen and ground crew in Orkney and Shetland, all of whom go above and beyond to keep our services operating, throughout the seasons and whatever the weather. Our fantastic team is a large part of why I enjoy this job so much.\n\n“The sheer variety of my job is a joy too, as you never know what’s coming next and no two days are the same. It’s a broad-ranging role which necessitates dealing with a range of issues.\n\n“Our pioneering spirit is the thread that runs through everything we do, from those first services to the Orkney Isles to our work today around customer service. We deliver more than people typically expect from a regional airline.\n\n“Basing our customer contact centre in Scotland, in the same office as the majority of our team is crucial, so there’s no disconnect between the company and the service we deliver to our customers.\n\n“When our customers call us, they’re chatting to someone based in the area we serve, who knows our services inside and out and who is very much part of the airline.\n\n“Our entire team understands that customer service is part of their role and that they have an impact on the customer experience. Providing what they propose is legal and safe, they are empowered to take decisions on the spot if it’s in the best interests of a customer.\n\n“We’ve just had a call from a customer to say ‘thank you’ after a member of our team went out of their way to help them. The customer’s circumstances didn’t fit our compassionate fare rebooking policy, but our employee helped them anyway because it was the right thing to do and the customer was grateful.\n\n“Sometimes it’s the small things that make a big difference to customers. Amending our baggage allowance to allow for two or three smaller bags weighing up to 20 Kilos, rather than one larger bag of up to 20 kilos, has proven more convenient for a significant number of customers. Whilst allowing people to check in up to four days ahead of their flights has also been a popular move.\n\n“When it comes to staff engagement, communication is really important. Keep communicating as regularly as you can and listen to what your team are saying. Give your team a chance to draw on their experiences and provide feedback.\n\n“I wholeheartedly agree that good ideas come from every corner of the business. If the team can see that something could be improved, I want them to feel comfortable about sharing those insights.\n\n“As a business, we try to be agile and respond well to changing circumstances. We’ve faced several significant changes over the years and my advice when it comes to managing change is don’t put it off.\n\n“If change is needed, then tackle it straightway, as quickly, safely and legally as you can. Delaying change only leads to uncertainty and damages morale. Implementing change quickly minimises the uncertainty and means you reap the benefits sooner.\n\n“In September 2017, after a quarter of a century of operating under franchise agreements, we took the unusual step of breaking away and operating under our own brand name once again.\n\n“Operating independently was a huge change to make, but I’m very glad we did. People don’t tend to launch regional airlines, but we’ve always done things differently and it’s working really well.”\n\nIn the last few weeks, Loganair has faced another significant change, stepping in to provide services on five key routes following the unfortunate news about Flybmi. “In the space of a few days, we took on 115 additional staff, along with six additional aircraft from Flybmi,” explains Jonathan.\n\n“We organised a conversion course within 24 hours and two thirds of our new staff have completed this training and are flying with us, whilst another course is underway.”\n\nIn another development, Loganair has just launched services to London Southend Airport from Aberdeen, Glasgow and Stornoway, providing customers with more journey options to the City of London and beyond.\n\nWhilst looking a little ahead, the company is to begin operating flights between Glasgow and Dusseldorf, illustrating that Loganair is clearly going from strength to strength, serving more customers on more routes.\n\n“Aeroplanes have always been an interest of mine, as a young lad, whilst my siblings played sport, I liked nothing better than to visit our nearest airport to watch the planes. It’s a fascination that’s never left me.\n\n“I left school with the idea for working for an airline for a year or two before going to university, but I’ve enjoyed it so much I never made it to university.\n\n“In the intervening years I’ve had a variety of commercial and operational roles, 25 years after landing that first job, I’m still in the industry and loving it just as much.”"
