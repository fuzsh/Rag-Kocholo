        "text": "New Energy Bills Discount Scheme\n\nThe March budget saw the new âEnergy Bills Discount Schemeâ (EBDS) introduced to replace the âEnergy Bill Relief Schemeâ (EBRS) that had run until 31st March. The Energy Bills Discount Scheme will run for 12 months, from April 2023 to the end of March 2024.\n\nThe EBDS contains a baseline discount that will provide some support with energy bills for eligible non-domestic customers. This discount will be applied automatically and non-domestic users should expect to see this applied in May bills. There are also additional discounts for non-domestic users in certain sectors.\n\nFor more information on the EBRS, go to the UK Government website.\n\nReducing your energy bills\n\nIf you want to find out how to improve energy efficiency for your business and discover ways to reduce wasted energy, check out the Energy Management Plan blog by the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB).

The scheme has been designed to help tackle climate change by reducing the amount of material going to landfill, improving recycling rates and reducing litter.\n\nDrink producers, importers, wholesalers and retailers all have obligations under The Deposit and Return Scheme for Scotland Regulations 2020.\n\nZero Waste Scotland has compiled a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on the Scheme, including why Scotland is introducing it and how it actually works for businesses.\n\nRead the FAQs here: depositreturnscheme.zerowastescotland.org.uk/faqs\n\nRegional Energy Masterplan\n\nSouth Ayrshire Council, along with North and East Ayrshire Councils, have partnered with Scottish Enterprise and the University of the West of Scotland to create a Regional Energy Masterplan for Ayrshire.
