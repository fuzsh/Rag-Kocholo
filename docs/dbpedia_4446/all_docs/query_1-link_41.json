        "text": "Little snafu at boarding. Staff communicated with gate poorly. Flight attendant was rude making disembark early. This was an older mint class. Needs an overhaul for sure. Food was good. The male flight attendant was really nice.\n\nMy encounter with the entertainment services provided on board was moderate; the functionality of the Wi-Fi connection was either sluggish or nonoperational, while the display screens were antiquated and suffered from poor visibility. On the positive side, the cabin exuded a sense of expansiveness, and the crew exhibited amiable and accommodating behavior throughout the journey.\n\nEverything was great except for some reason crew and ground crew could not figure out how to deal with an electric wheelchair and it delayed us 20-30mins. Was pretty frustrating for passengers and the captain.\n\nLike the space, did not like the snack options, there was no power outlet in seats, no entertainment, no flyfi.\n\nTraveling with JetBlue from NYC was convenient as accessing JFK airport was straightforward via the LIRR to the AirTrain. Maneuvering through the terminal was hassle-free, which was a pleasant start to the journey. However, the flight experience itself left much to be desired. The seating arrangement was notably uncomfortable; despite securing a window seat, space felt cramped. This was exacerbated by the middle seat passenger encroaching on my area, which made the flight less enjoyable. Additionally, while the in-flight entertainment system initially seemed like a reprieve, the sound outlet on my seat was inoperable. This issue turned what could have been a manageable three-hour flight into a rather tedious ordeal, as I was unable to use the entertainment system effectively. While JetBlue provided a smooth process in terms of airport logistics, the on-board experience highlighted areas in need of improvement, particularly in terms of comfort and entertainment system maintenance.\n\nThe flight crew that we had in our section may have been tired or something. I asked the flight attendant about my son’s screen not working and she spoke down to me like I was stupid. He still had no working screen throughout his flight. The other members had no personality and seemed like they were annoyed when you asked them for something. Definitely took a hit for simple things on my JB experience.\n\nI volunteered to let them put my carry on suitcase in the baggage storage area. But when we landed I was told it was being unloaded IN A DIFFERENT TERMINAL! I had to walk (painful for me) a long way to retrieve my bag and my ride had to move from the waiting area they were in to a totally different one. Not happy.\n\nOver 2 hour delay for a 50-minute flight is unacceptable, especially in normal weather. Very poor communication via app\n\nIn-flight staff was very helpful and excellent. However, the flight was delayed by 90 minutes. Also the boarding process should be expedited in case of delayed flights. This will help the passengers trying to make international connections.\n\nThey delayed our flight by 45 minutes and then re-updated the departure time back to normal schedule with no notification, email, or app update causing probably 40 people to miss the flight as they left without us.\n\nAbsolute disaster. Rude, uncooperative staff. Staff ignores and pretends you don’t exist when you are asking them a question. Erroneous departure gate and baggage claim information. Equipment not working for purchase of drinks. Overly expensive baggage check-in fees. Overly crowded. Dirty airplane. Passengers coughing incessantly as if they were being gassed. Circled airport in flight several times and waited on the tarmac for 1.5 hours. The worst experience ever. Consider another industry. The travel industry is not for you.\n\nCrew went above and beyond. I was able to upgrade to United Polaris within 24 hours of my flight departure for 30,000 points. Was totally worth it.\n\nLuggage management is poor, my missing luggage is still lingering.\n\nIn this flight we had selected seating for our family in the middle of the plane in a 2x2 format. The airline changed them to the very back row of the plane and split them to 3x1. Why pay for seats that allow seat selection if the airline will just move them to the worst seats in the plane?\n\nWe had selected seats in the app that were a 2x2 format in the middle of the plane. Our seats when we got on the plane had been moved to the back rows in a 3x1 format. What’s the point of paying up for tickets that allow seat selection if the airline will just change them?\n\nShort and everyone communicated with me about the changes every step of the way.\n\nThe pairing of personal Bluetooth headset did not work, provided headset did not work, then the screen locked and therefore no in-flight entertainment was available.\n\nThe flight was bumpy. No Breakfast or coffee was served, not even a bottle of water. The food was okay but odd. Rice with peas instead of couscous with some unknown green thing. United Airlines did not tell me that there was VERY LIMITED HANDICAP SERVICE IN NAPLES. De-plane via 20 aluminum steps. Taken to Van. You must walk into the terminal, find luggage, and then walk out to the rental car pickup spot that is 1 block from the terminal.\n\nCrew did their best but the plane configuration is too tight if you're bigger than an average sardine. Controls for the entertainment system didn't all work. The aircraft hadn't been cleaned in awhile.\n\nCharging and entertainment didn't work. The meal was horrible. They only came by with the drink cart one time for the 8 hour flight. They did come by with water a couple times.\n\nDallas Hub. American taking ownership for their screwups instead of blaming their contractors and customers, trading their people, their call in service, reservation agents and their ticketing process. Make sure wheelchairs are available especially when the request is in their record.\n\nGate agents for boarding not trained. I am disabled have eyesight problems and was told “do it on line.”. Wheelchair unavailable in Dallas even though it was in my record\n\nCheck in agent was helpful and nice. Flight was OK. Our flight in Chicago was delayed 8 hours without an explination. This was our journey home. After a horrible flight experience on on the way to our vacation where our plane was diverted for an emergency medical issue, was grounded for hours, we missed our connecting flight by 25 minutes, and it took a day yo get re-booked, this was yet another bad experience that American seemed unwilling to help out with, much less compensate us for the\n\nBoarding was disorganized and delayed because they overbooked and wanted people to give up seats then further delayed due to an issue with the plane. They did not load my bag and it took a day for them to return it. Flight attendant was lovely and the only positive thing about this trip.\n\nnot enough crew for business class and not great service as a result. underwhelmed overall\n\nThe crew was very helpful and the aircraft was clean. More attentiveness to us in business class.\n\nCrew never smiled, never helped , told me to make my own bed ( in Upper class), never offered a drink\n\nInformation when booking said the flight would be with American Airlines but the flight was actualy with British Airways. Check in from Orlando was nice and quick. I agreed to put my cabin case in the checked luggage as it was a full flight. Case came back damaged (unable to put the handle down) so will have to dispose of it. Seats were quite cramped with very little leg room, even for economy. This was the experience of both the outgoing and return flight. Cabin crew were ok and flight time was punctual.\n\nMissed this flight due to the first AA flight delay\n\nMissed connection from Philadelphia to London because flight from DC was seriously delayed. Was re-routed the next day (had to pay for hotel) to Zurich and was given a main cabin middle seat while I had paid for premium. Great job AA!!!\n\nSpirit airlines flight delays caused me to miss my connecting flight. I was rebooked in a different flight that routed through Texas. The flight from LAS to Houston was miserable, the person seated next to me was visibly intoxicated, and was served more alcohol in the plane. Upon arrival in Houston nothing was open, even TSA. I had to spend 6 hours just waiting in the airport. All in all, I arrived home a full 12 hours after my originally planned travel which out my family in a bad position. Do better!!!\n\nHorrible airline with terrible customer service! I was at the Atlanta airport going to Ft Lauderdale. They delayed the takeoff time several times. We finally boarded & taxied away from the gate where they had us sit in a hot airplane for an hour & a half before cancelling the flight due to weather. They did not even offer us water. They took us back to a totally different gate where they said agents would be available to help. Instead, they dumped us out & left us to fend for ourselves. We had to go out of security to go pick up our checked luggage & wait in a long line at the ticket desk where only one agent was working & by the time we got to the front of the line over an hour later, all the flights were full for the rest of the day & only limited seat availability for the next day. If you were one of the lucky few that was able to reschedule the same day flying to the same or a different airport, you had to go back through security & ride the train to get back to the correct date which took over an hour more. A total waste of time. I will never fly Spirit Airlines again!!\n\nCrew was Awesome, especially flight attendant Blake from Fort Lauderdale! Passengers onboard were unfortunately unruly & disrespectful.\n\nEverything is an additional charge. It's bare bones, still at a high cost. Don't plan on flying Spirit again.\n\nDelayed 4 hours, the plane hot as hell. 2 passengers got sick. One of them was my wife. Airflow was very bad.\n\nSpirit literally broke parts of two of our suitcases and call it “normal wear and tear.” Not worth the low price if we have to replace bags.\n\nVery bad flight was delayed. After they boarded us kept us in plane four 4 hours because they didn’t have fuel. Very unprofessional. Plane and bathrooms were very dirty. AC was blowing very cold. After everything went very bad because od them they rebooked connection flight next day more than 12 hours. Didn’t provide hotel voucher. Never going to fly this airline\n\nIt would’ve been better if you didn’t cancel my flight and I couldn’t find another flight within 200 miles so I had to go down to Baltimore to get on a flight.\n\nTerrible. Rude flight attendants. Uncomfortable seats. Nickel and dime every service. No in flight entertainment. First and last time to fly spirit.\n\nI liked the airfare price. Seats are not very comfortable. But I would fly again with Spirit for the price.\n\nLong lines, rude staff, everything that's offered you have to pay for.\n\nAmong the worst flights I’ve taken. Never again. Staff was horrible across the entire Frontier workforce. Flight attendants were legitimately yelling at and arguing with each other while on board - toxic environment (really guys? at work and in front of customers no less?). Frontier intentionally assigned my partner and I (who booked together) to opposite ends of the plane despite plenty of seats together - straight up predatory practices to take people’s money. Seats are legit the absolute worst. Not even free coffee. Absolute garbage airline with wild hidden fees and the worst staff in the business. They will for sure have a deadly accident soon. Never again, not for any where not for any price.\n\nMy departure gate was E10 but no kiosk at E10 for check in & no one to ask. A United attendant helped direct us to E38 for check in. The kiosks at E38 were all malfunctioning. A counter agent had to check us in. We then had to walk back to E10 for boarding. E10 to E38 at DfW is not an easy trek. No where in all the info they sent us indicated there were issues to over come. They can cut only so many corners. Luckily we arrived plenty early to deal with Frontier’s inefficiency.\n\nOur flight was delayed by four hours without notice, the app for getting my boarding pass is super confusing, and I wasn’t able to check a suitcase without paying for a higher cost package\n\nFlight was cancelled and was not able to get another flight thru Frontier. Per frontier a refund was issued but I do not see a refund on my Afirm account.\n\nFirst the gate was a total nightmare-no chairs anywhere! So over crowded and only one bathroom and nightmare of food service - took forever and NOT one place to sit. No inflight entertainment and had to pay 60.00 for a small carry on. I will never fly Frontier again!\n\nLiterally everything could have been better. Why are the planes always late?\n\nWe did not get to go on this flight because it got canceled 4 hours prior to scheduled time. We received an email that it got canceled and then 10 minutes later we received another email that it got delayed. It was very confusing and the only options they gave us for return flight home were 12 to 22 hours of travel time. That was not an option for us since we were traveling with kids and school started on Monday. We ended up opting for a refund and booking a flight back with Alaska. The flight ended up costing us $1500 and we had to book a hotel for the night. We will never book with frontier again."
