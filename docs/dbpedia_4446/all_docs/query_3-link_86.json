        "text": "Can I sell a car on behalf of a family member or friend?\n\nA. Yes, but if you are selling on behalf of a relative or friend then we require a letter of authorisation from the owner.\n\nThe bank details must match the same name as the registered keeper on the V5 logbook/registration certificate.\n\nWe also need two forms of ID for the owner (one original photo ID and one proof of address items dated in the last 3 months) and two forms of ID from the person selling the vehicle on their behalf (one original photo ID and one proof of address items dated in the last 3 months).\n\nA. We realise this can be an incredibly emotional and stressful time and we can help make this process easy.\n\nTo satisfy due diligence we will require certain documents depending upon the individual circumstances.\n\nPlease contact us.\n\nA. Yes, we will need you to bring along the following:\n\nA form of photo identification for the person bringing the car.\n\nLetter signed from the company director giving authorisation for that person to sell on their behalf.\n\nCompany account details e.g. bank paying in book or company bank statement.\n\nOne form of identification for the business address.\n\nV5 logbook/registration certificate registered in the companies name and address.\n\nA. Yes, but we require a settlement letter dated within 7 days from your finance company to allow us to settle your finance agreement with your finance company with the remaining balance payable to yourself.\n\nA. We'll be happy to give you a valuation and buy your car whilst it has a personalised registration.\n\nHowever, if you want to keep your private plate it's easy to reassign it to another car or to put the registration onto a retention certificate so that it can be sold or reassigned at a later date. You would need to complete this with the DVLA prior to selling to us. You must be in receipt of your new V5 registration document.\n\nTo find out more about personalised registrations and locate your local DVLA office, visit the DVLA website.\n\nA. The V5 (log book) holds the details of the registered keeper of the vehicle. To prevent fraud, we will only purchase a vehicle from you if it is your name on the V5. If you wish to sell your car and there is a legitimate reason why you are not the registered keeper, please contact us.\n\nA. We may require from you a copy of your original purchase invoice which should be from a recognised main dealer.\n\nIf we require anything in addition to your purchase invoice, we will endeavour to advise you prior to your appointment.\n\nWe cannot accept proof of purchase from an Auction House.\n\nA. We are unable to purchase any car without the original V5 document (log book).\n\nIf you do not have one you can obtain a new document by filling in form V62 which you can download from the DVLA or pick up from any Post Office. The completed form and appropriate fee should be sent to DVLA, Swansea SA99 1AR. It normally takes 3 to 4 weeks to obtain a new V5.\n\nA. We use the most secure method possible - electronic bank transfer. We'll arrange payment direct to your bank account which takes 4 working days after the day of sale. There is no charge for this service and it protects you from the risk of carrying around large sums of cash or losing a cheque.\n\nIf you need your money quicker, we offer an optional next working day payment service at an additional cost of Â£25.00. When you choose our next working day payment service, the payment will be made directly to your bank account.\n\nA. No. We can only pay money to the legal owner of the vehicle. If you are acting as an agent on behalf of the owner then we will only make payment to the legal owner's instructed bank account."
