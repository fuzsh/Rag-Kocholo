        "text": "In a stagnant market two Scottish airports could be sold at the same time\n\nWhile airport M&A activity globally remains in the doldrums, two airports in Scotland in the United Kingdom may possibly be sold, and they are just 70 miles (112km) apart.\n\nThe airports are at: Edinburgh, the mixed business model facility serving the Scottish capital, the second most visited British city from abroad, and the sixth busiest UK airport in 2019 before the COVID pandemic; and the much smaller Glasgow Prestwick, a secondary level facility that hosts Ryanair exclusively, and is situated on the Irish Sea coast about 35 miles (56km) from Glasgow, which is Scotland's largest city.\n\nEdinburgh Airport consistently the sixth busiest in the UK\n\nEdinburgh Airport, to the west of the city centre and accessible by a tram (light rail) service from there, was purchased by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) in 2012 for GBP800 million, during the enforced break up of BAA plc.\n\nGIP is now the majority owner, together with two Australian funds.\n\nEdinburgh Airport: ownership as at 08-Jan-2024\n\nEdinburgh's passenger traffic throughput in 2019 was 14.7 million, making it the sixth busiest in the UK - as it has been consistently since 2013 and through to 2022. The airport recovered from a low of just over three million in 2021 to 11.25 million in 2022, and then to almost 11 million in the first nine months of 2023 (1-3Q2023), the latest figure available.\n\nPassenger statistics are available for almost 30 years, and they show a marked increase in growth during the five years 2015-2019 before the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was felt. Business was developed at both ends of the scale, from low cost carrier (LCC) short haul services to long haul flights.\n\nEdinburgh Airport: annual traffic, passenger numbers/growth, 1996-2023\n\nEdinburgh, like many UK airports today, sees much of its capacity on LCCs - in Edinburgh's case, 68% for the week commencing 08-Jan-2024.\n\nEdinburgh Airport: seats by business model, week commencing 08-Jan-2024\n\nBritish Airways has a large capacity share and will introduce regional European services this year\n\nMore than half (55%) of that capacity is taken up by easyJet and Ryanair, the two main airlines.\n\nHowever, British Airways has a surprisingly large share (14%) at Edinburgh, for a presence at a regional airport, mainly taken up by its flights to and from London airports, although the airline is introducing a European regional flight programme to five tourist destinations in 2024, something that other UK regional airports don't get from the London-centric airline.\n\nEdinburgh has well established and growing long haul operations, with regular or (mostly) seasonal flights to the US (seven airports), Canada (three), the Middle East (one) and China (one), which are at least partially supported by the incoming tourist business that it sustains as a major attraction to foreign visitors.\n\nEdinburgh Airport: network map for the week commencing 08-Jan-2024\n\nAlmost two thirds (60%) of capacity at Edinburgh is on international services, the vast majority to Europe, led by Spain and Ireland, but more than 74% is on unaligned airlines.\n\nEdinburgh has supposedly been 'on the market' several times previously\n\nThis is not the first time that it has been suggested that Edinburgh Airport might be sold.\n\nGIP has been winding down its UK interests, disposing of London City Airport in 2016 to a gaggle of investment, pension and sovereign wealth funds for a hefty profit. Then, in Dec-2018, minimising its equity share in London Gatwick Airport to 49.99% as part of a consortium with two existing pension and two sovereign wealth fund investors, in favour of a 50.01% share thenceforth held by VINCI Airports.\n\nGIP has since been focused on opportunities elsewhere: such as in Sydney, where it became a minority shareholder in the Kingsford Smith airport early in 2021; in Greece and the Philippines (as a prospective investor); and in the USA, where it was a bidder for the aborted St Louis Lambert Airport lease in 2019 and where it became an investor in the Paine Field Passenger Terminal at Everett Paine Field Airport (Washington state) in 2019.\n\nIn Feb-2021 GIP was part of a consortium, along with Blackstone and the Bill Gates-owned Cascade Investments, which bought the London-listed airport FBO operator Signature Aviation.\n\nOn the last occasion that Edinburgh Airport was thought to be for sale - as discussed in UK's Edinburgh Airport sale rumours emerge again - who might buy it and what would it be worth? in Oct-2022 - GIP denied any intention to sell it, as it always has.\n\nCould VINCI do a deal similar to the one at London Gatwick?\n\nCAPA - Centre for Aviation speculated at the time that VINCI would be the most likely buyer.\n\nVINCI has experience of operating primary or secondary capital city airports with a tourism bent in Lisbon, Stockholm and Phnom Penh and also in resort cities like Orlando and Acapulco in one way or another. It is a minority shareholder in Groupe ADP, the operator of the Paris airports, and it manages Belfast International Airport in the UK, amongst its 71 assets worldwide.\n\nMoreover, it has learned how to operate closely with GIP at Gatwick, indicating that another partial sale could be in the offing, with perhaps a reduced GIP shareholding wrapped up with those of the Australian investors.\n\nAnother possibility might be the Spanish company Ferrovial, which recently sold its 25% stake in London Heathrow airport but which retains its 50% interest in AGS Airports - which operates Glasgow International and Aberdeen airports in Scotland. Competition issues would undoubtedly arise if it were to declare an interest in Edinburgh.\n\nAn outsider would be IMF, the Australian fund manager that is a 35% shareholder in Manchester Airports Group and one that has been expanding in recent years.\n\nValued at GBP2.5 billion\n\nGIP has hired HSBC and JP Morgan to oversee the sale of Edinburgh Airport, and that an asking price of GBP2.5 billion has been suggested.\n\nThat is almost exactly what CAPA - Centre for Aviation valued it at in Oct-2022, based on its EBITDA in 2019 and a pre-pandemic valuation earnings multiple in the business that averaged 19 times earnings (i.e. it would take 19 years to repay the purchase out of earnings in the year before the sale).\n\nBlackRock agrees GIP purchase in USD3 billion deal\n\nGlobal Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and BlackRock Alternative Investors confirmed on 15-Jan-2024 that they have entered into an agreement for BlackRock to acquire GIP for a total consideration of USD3 billion and approximately 12 million shares of BlackRock common stock. The transaction is expected to close in 3Q2024, subject to customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.\n\nAny proposed sale of Edinburgh Airport will have been taken into account in this agreement."
