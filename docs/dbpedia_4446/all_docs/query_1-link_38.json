        "text": "Loganair is a Scottish regional airline, serving over 40 destinations across the wider UK and Europe. Since the collapse of Flybe, Loganair has become the UK's largest regional airline by both passenger numbers and fleet size. Founded in 1962 in Glasgow, Loganair operated services under franchise agreements for both British Airways and the now-defunct airline Flybe. The airline also operates under its own corporate identity operating Loganair services across the UK and Europe from 1st September 2017. Loganair has been awarded Public Service Obligation contracts from both the Scottish and UK governments to operate services to remote parts of Scotland. These routes are often subsidised by the government to allow connections to remote regions of the country. Six of the Scottish routes served by Loganair include; Glasgow to Barra, Campbeltown, Tiree, Stornoway to Benbecula, Dundee to Stansted and the Inter Orkney Isles, which are designated Public Service Obligation (PSO) routes.\n\nThe airline's main hub is at Glasgow Airport (GLA) and secondary hubs are Aberdeen Airport (ABZ), City of Derry Airport (LDY), East Midlands Airport (EMA), Edinburgh Airport (EDI), Inverness Airport (INV), Kirkwall Airport (KOI), Norwich Airport (NWI) and Newcastle Airport (NCL).\n\nA PSO, one of only two state aid mechanisms within EU legislation for air services, is imposed on routes that are not commercially viable and are essential to counter the remoteness of the regions. In February 2019, it was announced that the airline will launch three new routes from London Southend to Aberdeen, Glasgow and Stornaway. After Flybe axed its service from Southend to Glasgow, the new routes will be a welcome addition.\n\nLooking for domestic flights in the UK?\n\nCheck out our guide to domestic flights in the UK, for a full airline guide and FAQs.\n\nChecked baggage on Loganair is dependent on the fare category that is purchased. Passengers who purchased Fly Flex+ can carry up to 30kg / 66lbs in total but up to 25kg / 55lbs per piece free of charge and Fly Flex passengers can carry up to 23kg / 55lbs in a single bag free of charge. Fly customers will only get a free baggage allowance of up to 15kg / 33lbs. If you have baggage over your free allowance, it will only be accepted if space is available at a charge of a small fee. The maximum is any 1 bag at 25kgs / 55lbs. Any additional pieces of luggage will be charged £10. Charges may vary and will be applied at the prevailing rate when payment is made.\n\nEconomy Class Facilities\n\nEconomy class is currently the only class provided on this airline’s planes.

The Fly Flex and Fly Flex + fares allow passengers with hectic schedules more flexibility. If you arrive at the airport early, you may be able to hop on an earlier flight if there is availability to be able to get home earlier. In addition, the Fly Flex + fare allows you to change your flight with no additional costs from the airline.\n\nFly Flex + not only gives full flexibility to change your flight when you want, without any additional cost, but it also puts you in the fast lane by adding fast-track security and airport lounge access. So you can put your feet up, relax and enjoy the Wi-Fi, cakes and coffee!\n\nWhat are the seats like?\n\nThe seats in Business class are full of comfort, you can easily stretch those legs.\n\nGlasgow Airport (GLA)\n\nGlasgow Airport (GLA) also known as Glasgow International Airport and formerly Abbotsinch Airport is an international airport based in Glasgow, Scotland.
