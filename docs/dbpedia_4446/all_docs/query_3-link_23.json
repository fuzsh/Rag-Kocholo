        "text": "Sponsorship – why sponsor SAST?\n\nSouth Ayrshire Swim Team (SAST) is a thriving and growing swim club based in Ayr, Scotland. It was formed in 2001 when clubs from Ayr, Troon and Prestwick merged together to share resources and pool facilities to form a larger, more competitive and inclusive club which caters for young and older swimmers of all abilities. Working closely with South Ayrshire Council and Scottish Swimming, SAST is run by an elected committee of parents, coaches and volunteers.\n\nWe are keen to develop sponsorships with local businesses in order to continue expanding and providing opportunities for swimmers of all ages, stages and abilities to enjoy swimming.\n\nAs a SAST sponsor you would be helping to promote a healthy and active lifestyle, allowing local children and adults the chance to follow their aspirations and enjoy participating in a sport that they love.\n\nAs a SAST sponsor you would have a wide reaching audience; we regularly have swimmers attending local, regional and often national galas. We host our own swimming meets which are well attended and attract swimmers from various parts of Scotland.\n\nAs a SAST sponsor we would be happy to work with you, to see how best to promote your business and ensure you benefit from the relationship.\n\nWe have a variety of sponsorship packages available, these vary from simply advertising your companies name and details on our website and social media, to larger more specific sponsorship deals. Below are details of our current packages, however this list is not exhaustive – we are in the process of developing further packages for more comprehensive sponsorship options. Please feel free to enquire about other options or any of the below. As mentioned previously, all packages can be tailored to meet individual requirements."
