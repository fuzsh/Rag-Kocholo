After the launch of ConnectJet International in April 2020, Loganair came back and restarted with a flight from Glasgow Airport - Campbelltown Airport in the Twin Otter. It is now defunct.\n\nRecords[]\n\nLoganair was the only airline that had scheduled service to an airport with a beach as it's runway, Barra. It uses the Twin Otter and connects Barra to Glasgow.\n\nIt also operated the world's shortest commercial flight, between Westray and Papa Westray.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe Flybe Twin Otter in GeoFS was actually a Loganair aircraft IRL, the registration G-BVVK was in the Loganir livery IRL and in GeoFS if you go to the front of the aircrafts nose, it actually says, operated by Loganair."
