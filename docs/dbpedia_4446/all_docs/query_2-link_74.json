        "text": "Edinburgh Airport\n\nEdinburgh Airport is an airport located in the Ingliston area of Edinburgh, Scotland. It was the busiest airport in Scotland in 2019, handling over 14.7 million passengers. It was also the sixth-busiest airport in the United Kingdom by total passengers in 2019, and second-busiest outside London. It is located 5 NM west of the city centre, just off the M8 and M9 motorways. It is owned and operated by Global Infrastructure Partners, who are also a minority shareholder of Gatwick Airport. The airport has one runway and one passenger terminal and employs about 2,500 people.\n\nGlasgow Airport\n\nGlasgow Airport is an international airport in Scotland. It is located in Paisley, Renfrewshire, 8.6 nautical miles west of Glasgow city centre. In 2019, the airport handled 8.84 million passengers, an 8.4% annual decrease, making it the second-busiest in Scotland, after Edinburgh Airport, and the ninth-busiest airport in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe airport is owned and operated by AGS Airports which also owns and operates Aberdeen and Southampton airports. It was previously owned and operated by Heathrow Airport Holdings. The airport's largest tenants are British Airways, easyJet and Loganair. Other major airlines using Glasgow as a base include Jet2.com and TUI Airways.\n\nGlasgow Airport was opened in 1966 and originally flights only operated to other places in the United Kingdom and Europe. Glasgow Airport began to offer flights to other places around the world, flights which previously used Glasgow Prestwick Airport, which was subsequently relegated as the city's secondary airport catering for Ryanair, freight and charter operators.\n\nFrom the Otter pilot\n\nPilot notes: Find airport info on http://www.nats-uk.ead-it.com airport information\n\nFor Tidal info, consult the tables for \"Barra North Bay\". Generally speaking when the tide is below 3.0 meter the runways are usable. The first to be flooded is runway 29, then 33, lastly 25.\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/coast_and_sea/tide_tables/7/314\n\nThere are normally two scheduled flights a day with a turn-around time of 20-30 minutes. The twin otters will receive priority so plan a landing and departure at other times. Schedules are at irregular, but published times.\n\nIt is advisable to phone Barra airport authority before departure.\n\nIntro\n\nLearned to fly there in mid 70s. First to use first tar runway,m which we build with stones from the former railway line. Once you have soloed there no airfield will appear daunting, since the runmway is the worlds narrowest aircraft deck, which seldom points into wind. Still a great place to fly/soar/tour, all year round. Got my Gold height in Jnauary, Diamond in June, it really is all year soaring, but just a touch cool in winter\n\nA field with lots of character\n\nThis is a former RAF base from world war II which is the only one still using the original buildings. The FBO, Far North Aviation, is in the original tower. You feel very much into \"Battle of Britain\" here. Great service, very friendly, no hassles with the paperwork. A very nice place to land after or before crossing the pond. The approach is a LOC DME and the weather can be low, but even though it's called the Highlands there is nothing solid to hit near the airport. The local scotch (Old Pulteney) is excellent, as is the beer (the Real Mackay)."
