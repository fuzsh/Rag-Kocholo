        "text": "Glasgow Prestwick Airport is an international airport located 1.9km northeast of Prestwick in South Ayrshire, Scotland. Situated 32 miles from Glasgow city centre, the airport mainly serves the Greater Glasgow urban area. The airport is owned by Infratil.\n\nGlasgow Prestwick Airport is the only rail-connected airport in Scotland. It is also a hub for three major low-cost airlines, namely Ryanair, Wizz and Aer Arann. In 2010, the airport recorded 1.6 million passenger transfers, a significant decline from 1.8 million in 2009. The airport witnessed 33,087 aircraft movements in 2010.\n\nGlasgow Prestwick expansion projects\n\n\"Glasgow Prestwick Airport is the only rail-connected airport in Scotland. It is also a hub for three major low-cost airlines.\"\n\nEstablished as a training airfield in 1934, Glasgow Prestwick Airport has undergone several major expansions over the years to accommodate growing traffic. These expansions saw the addition of a new terminal building, freight building, extended runway, control tower and loop road by 1964.\n\nA £3m refurbishment of the terminal building was completed in April 2005. In February 2010, Ryanair planned to build a second maintenance hangar at a cost of £8m. The 6,000m² hangar was inaugurated in February 2011.\n\nA multimillion pound expansion is planned to double the size of the departure lounge. The construction of a new terminal building is also proposed to replace the existing arrival and departure halls. The numbers of aircraft stands are also to be increased, from six to 12. No official announcement on the commencement of this work has been made as of January 2012, however.\n\nThe car park and A79 road outside the terminal building have been redeveloped due to new rules and regulations put in place by the government after the Glasgow terrorist attack.\n\nThe airport occupies an area of 880 acres, which is sufficient for future expansion of airport facilities.\n\nTerminal facilities at the major Scottish airport\n\nThe airport has a single terminal building featuring arrival and departure halls, which can handle up to three million passengers a year. Two reserved seating areas, one next to the check-in desks and one at the departure lounge, are located in the terminal.\n\nA Travelex outlet is located near the entrance of the departure hall. A left luggage facility, baby care rooms and prayer room are available for the passengers. The Alpha retail, Peckhams and Nuance tax and duty free outlets offer gifts, snacks, newspapers, magazines and range of items for shoppers. Other terminal facilities include restaurants, internet kiosks, Bureau de Change, cash dispensers and game stations.\n\nThe airport has suites, a conference room and standard business facilities for business travellers. Wi-Fi connectivity is available throughout the airport. There are toilets, wheelchairs and designated elevators available for disabled passengers.\n\nThe freight handling facilities include a freight building, warehouses and hangars.\n\nRunways and transportation links at Glasgow’s international airport\n\nGlasgow Prestwick Airport has two runways designated, 13/31 and 03/21. Surfaced with concrete / asphalt, runway 13/31 measures 2,987m in length and 46m in width. Runway 03/21 is 1,989m long and 45m wide and is surfaced with asphalt.\n\n\"Glasgow Prestwick Airport has undergone several major expansions over the years to accommodate growing traffic.\"\n\nGlasgow Prestwick Airport railway station is located about 50m from the terminal building. It is accessed from the terminal through an enclosed walkway.\n\nFirst ScotRail operates frequent services to and from the airport at 50% off the standard adult single train fare.\n\nTerravision provides fast and direct shuttle services between airports and city centres.\n\nThe X99/X100 airport express bus runs between Edinburgh, Glasgow and the airport during public transport hours.\n\nThe X77 Express operates between the airport and Glasgow Buchanan Street Station. The Ayr Black Taxis (ABT) are available for pick up and drop off at the designated taxi area.\n\nParking facilities\n\nGlasgow Prestwick Airport has short, mid, long stay and Watsons Ayr parking areas. All the car parks at the airport have achieved Park Mark status.\n\nEach car park is served by help points. Special bays are available for disabled passengers at the car park in front of the terminal."
