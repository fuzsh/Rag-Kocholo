        "text": "SCOTLAND’S largest regional airline has introduced its first ever 35% business rate discount, offering business travellers the opportunity to fly for a fraction of the normal fare rate.\n\nLoganair has added its Aberdeen to Norwich service to its existing Business Connect programme and is offering a generous discount of 35% for those who use the scheme.\n\nLoganair’s Business Connect allows business travellers significant benefits, in addition to discounted fares, including full flight flexibility – meaning travelling on any flight with available space with no fees to change, on a selected route. Also included is airport fast track security, 23kg hold-luggage allowance and 800 points on Loganair’s loyalty scheme ‘Clan Loganair’.\n\nThe airline is predicting its new Business Connect Aberdeen to Norwich route will be popular with oil and gas workers travelling to and from Scotland’s energy capital.\n\nLuke Lovegrove, Chief Commercial Officer, Loganair said: “Our compelling Business Connect programme has been designed to support the many business travellers that fly with Loganair on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. Our aim is to make flying a stress-free, flexible and accessible way to travel, with an attractive discount on fares to ease financial pressure on the business community.\n\n“We assess market demand and local requirements on a continual basis and our Aberdeen to Norwich service was the ideal candidate for the programme. This is a popular route with oil and gas workers and connects Scotland’s energy centre with the rest of the UK allowing them to recruit and retain the best talent available.\n\n“We take our role to facilitate Scotland’s business connectivity very seriously and look forward to welcoming more business travellers onboard.”\n\nOther Business Connect flights include; Edinburgh to Southampton, City of Derry to London Heathrow, Aberdeen to Manchester and Aberdeen to Birmingham. Each of these routes are eligible for a 15% discount through the Business Connect programme.\n\nA minimum of five return flights must be booked in order to take advantage of the Business Connect programme and associated discounts."
