        "text": "1960\n\n1969\n\n25 July\n\nA voluntary Scottish Tourist Board (STB) was set up in 1946 and consisted of representatives of the main organisations in Scotland with an interest in tourism, together with four people appointed by the Secretary of State. This STB had no statutory powers and was based in a former church in Rutland Place.\n\nA recognition of the importance of tourism to the UK economy resulted in The Development of Tourism Act (1969), which came into force on 25 July 1969.\n\nThe STB’s remit was:\n\nTo promote or undertake publicity in any form\n\nTo provide advisory and information services\n\nTo promote and undertake research\n\nTo establish committees to advise the Board in the performance of its functions\n\nTo contribute to or reimburse expenditure incurred by any other person or organisation in carrying on any activity which the Board has power to carry on\n\n1969\n\nIn September, Sir Hector MacLennan (pictured middle) was appointed as Chairman of the STB on a salary of £3,000 per year. He was an eminent gynaecologist.\n\n1970\n\n1970\n\nLester Borley (pictured left) was appointed the first Chief Executive of the Scottish Tourist Board (STB) from 1 January 1970-1975.\n\n1970\n\nSeven Regional Tourist Associations were proposed; to co-operate with the STB in the interest of promoting and developing Scottish tourism and, specifically in their own area, to provide information services for visitors. They were:\n\nHighlands and Islands\n\nNorth East\n\nEast Central\n\nWest\n\nEdinburgh and Lothians\n\nBorders\n\nSouth West\n\n1970\n\nSTB’s first limited UK advertising scheme took place. It featured off-season travel ideas and appeared in January, February and March in magazines \"chosen for the effectiveness of their circulation\".\n\n1970\n\nThe 1970 Commonwealth Games was held in Edinburgh from 16 – 25 July. This was the first time metric units rather than imperial units were used in all events and was the first time the Games were held in Scotland.\n\n1970\n\nThe first international tourism figures for Scotland were released:\n\nTrips Nights Spend 0.62 million 8.5 million £262 million\n\n1972\n\nIn March, April and May, the \"A Taste of Scotland\" pilot scheme was developed to promote Scottish food, drink, products, events and attractions. A publication was produced to accompany this. Promotion was mainly via travel trade and PR to 21 cities across the US.\n\n1972\n\nIn May, the first Regional Information Centre was opened at Whitesands in Dumfries.\n\n1972\n\nThe STB main campaign \"A World of Difference\" was launched – this would continue until 1977.\n\n1972\n\nThe \"Book a Bed Ahead\" scheme (BABA) was piloted and extended in 1974.\n\n1973\n\nThe first domestic figures for Scotland were unveiled.

This suggested preliminary guidelines for tourism policy in Scotland over the next five years. The report was in two main parts.\n\nThe first part analysed the main factors influencing tourism policies and the second set out tentative policy guidelines. These included:\n\nA new emphasis on existing resorts and other centres\n\nA series of major self-catering holiday villages\n\nA series of heritage projects\n\nA second all-year resort on the scale of Aviemore\n\n1976\n\nNew Tourist Information Centre in Edinburgh opened, jointly funded by Edinburgh District Council.\n\n1978\n\nThe Association of Scotland’s Self-Caterers (ASSC) was founded as the leading source of knowledge on holiday letting and holiday homes in Scotland.\n\n1978\n\nThe STB published a strategy in which they said that future growth in Scottish tourism was dependent on three key areas:\n\nOverseas markets – priority must be given to increased information about holiday opportunities in Scotland\n\nRate of investment in tourism accommodation and facilities must be sustained and improved\n\nThe need to make Scotland more accessible\n\n1980\n\n1980\n\nIn March 1980, Alan R. Devereux was appointed as the new Scottish Tourist Board (STB) Chairman. He stayed until 1990.\n\n1980\n\nScotland’s Travel Trade Fair was held at Ingliston in Edinburgh. The event attracted 180 exhibitors and approximately 80 UK travel agents and tour operators. The British Tourist Authority (BTA) brought 120 overseas buyers to the event.\n\nRebranded in 2002 to VisitScotland Expo, the event has become Scotland’s world-class, annual travel trade showcase, attracting hundreds of buyers from across the world.\n\n1981\n\nDr David Pattison, former Head of Tourism at Highlands and Islands Development Board was appointed new Chief Executive of the STB.\n\n1981\n\nNew \"Scotland’s For Me\" campaign began - a major TV campaign aimed at boosting activity and family holidays. Larry Hagman (most known for DALLAS) and comedian Rod Hull and Emu joined the call to holiday in Scotland.\n\n1984\n\nA comprehensive Area Tourist Board (ATB) network was established with 32 ATBs. Seven districts didn't participate at the outset, and a further three district councils, including Edinburgh, chose to retain their autonomy over tourism matters in their area.\n\n1984\n\nThe Tourism (Overseas Promotion) (Scotland) Act allowed the STB direct access to overseas markets for the first time.\n\n1985\n\nA new verified classification and grading scheme was introduced by Area Operations staff for accommodation.\n\n1985\n\nWelcome to Scotland signs were erected on the main road crossings into Scotland.\n\n1986\n\nIn January, the \"Surprising Scotland\" theme was launched to 37 million. The TV, poster and advertising \"teaser\" campaign highlighted attractive aspects of holidaying linked to overcoming widely held misconceptions about Scotland.\n\n1986\n\nIn February, Geoffrey Hare (pictured left) was appointed the new STB Chief Executive.\n\n1986\n\nThe SCOTS Agents training programme was launched and originally open to travel agents in the US and Canada.

This was despite a difficult 1986, when there were panic cancellations on the back of the Libyan crisis and Chernobyl incident. Businesses recovered strongly in the following months.\n\n1987\n\nIn June, Tom M. Band was appointed as new STB Chief Executive.\n\n1987\n\n\"Scotland - A Different Holiday Every Day\" marketing slogan was launched to underline the infinite variety of activities offered by a Scottish holiday. It was aimed at 35-55 year-old married couples living in north and south-east England, holidaying with or without dependent children.\n\n1987\n\nOn behalf of the industry STB continued to campaign in key areas:\n\nDirect flights – the frequency and quality of direct services to Scotland was challenged.\n\nUnleaded petrol – high proportion of European visitors to Scotland requiring unleaded petrol prompted STB to campaign for a price differential in favour of the fuel. The Chancellor of the Exchequer introduced this in his spring Budget encouraging petrol distributors to extend the network of unleaded petrol supplies.\n\n1988\n\nThe Association of Scottish Visitor Attractions (ASVA) was established to support and inspire Scottish visitor attractions to deliver sustainable and world class experiences, through the sharing of best practice.\n\n1989\n\nIn December, Nevis Range opened to the public. The Nevis Range Mountain Gondola – the only of its kind in the UK – is a year-round visitor attraction transporting visitors to 650m on the mountain of Aonach Mor. As well as offering winter sports, the Nevis Range is an internationally acclaimed venue for mountain biking, having hosted major events such as the UCI Mountain Bike World Cup.\n\n1990\n\n1990\n\nIan Grant (pictured right) was appointed as Scottish Tourist Board (STB) Chairman.\n\n1990\n\nThe STB agreed on a strategy for improving information and facilities for disabled visitors to Scotland following the publication of the \"Tourism for All\" report.\n\n1990\n\nGlasgow became European City of Culture.

It featured a father and son pair of eagles deciding to migrate for the first time to Scotland – most shots give an “eagle-eyed” view of Scotland from above.\n\n1992\n\nFirst Scottish Thistle Awards held in Glasgow to recognise and celebrate excellence in the Scottish tourism industry. Actress Dame Diana Rigg presented future VisitScotland Chairman Mike Cantlay with Young Manager of the Year award.\n\n1992\n\nThe Fergusson Gallery opened in Perth in what was once the city’s waterworks building.

This had direct responsibility for tourism and its funding, however, there was not a Minister for Tourism – this came under the remit of the Minister of Enterprise and Lifelong Learning (Henry McLeish).\n\n2000\n\n2000\n\nThe Scottish Parliament produced \"A New Strategy for Tourism\". This set a target of 14.3 million tourist visits by 2005 with revenue from tourism of £3.1 billion. The 1990s had shown minimal growth in the numbers of tourist trips – 11.5 million in 1989 and 11.8 million in 1998. It noted that there was a growth in \"cash-rich, time-poor\" travellers resulting in more frequent, shorter holidays, especially in urban areas.\n\n2000\n\nInverness was announced as Scotland’s newest city.\n\n2000\n\nIn July, Henry McLeish, then Enterprise Minister in the Scottish Parliament instigated a management review of the Scottish Tourist Board (STB).

The campaign proved a major success, running for nine years.\n\nThree versions of the advert were produced to encourage year-round visits to Scotland from the UK market. It generated many enquiries from the public about the music featured in the advertisements.\n\n2002\n\nThe inaugural UCI Downhill Mountain Bike World Cup was held at the Nevis Range in Fort William. The multi-award winning event has gone from strength to strength and is now a firm favourite on the sporting calendar.\n\n2002\n\nLoch Lomond & The Trossachs was designated as a National Park – the first National Park in Scotland. We supported the opening by coordinating and delivering a TV advertising campaign on behalf of strategic partners.\n\n2002\n\nStirling was granted city status in an announcement coinciding with HM the Queen’s Golden Jubilee year.\n\n2002\n\nThe Falkirk Wheel opened. The world’s first revolving boat lift made it possible for visitors to take a boat trip connecting the Forth and Clyde Canal with the Union Canal using less energy than it takes to boil a kettle. We worked with Scottish Canals, Falkirk Council and other partners to promote the new attractions, including delivery of a TV advertising campaign aimed at the domestic market.\n\n2003\n\nA public private partnership (between VisitScotland and Schlumberger Sema) was set up to run visitscotland.com - initially under the trading name of eTourism Ltd.\n\n2003\n\nThe Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown was published. Seen by some as controversial, the book’s main characters find themselves at Rosslyn Chapel and, as a result, the Chapel itself came to worldwide attention.\n\n2003\n\nThe \"longest poster\" saw us take over a London Waterloo Underground station and fill every advertising slot with a single stunning panoramic image of the Highlands, with a timeline showing how you could enjoy a perfect day.\n\n2003\n\nThe Cairngorms National Park was officially opened on 1 September by Liz Hanna, the great, great granddaughter of John Muir, founder of the National Park movement.

One of its first supported events was the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards held near Ocean Terminal in Edinburgh.\n\n2004\n\nEdinburgh became the world’s first UNESCO City of Literature.

Nearly 30 cities have since been inspired by the example set by Edinburgh.\n\n2004\n\nThe \"Welcome to Our Life\" campaign launched in European markets. It spanned city breaks and touring mailers and adverts and lasted through to 2007.\n\n2004/05\n\nFollowing extensive consultation, the Tourism (Scotland) Bill Consultation Paper proposed the new VisitScotland network was established as one single national tourism network with 14 area offices, effective on 1 April 2005. VisitScotland and the 14 Area Tourist Boards (ATBs) were to merge.\n\n2005\n\nThe new VisitScotland head office opened at Ocean Point, Edinburgh.\n\n2005\n\nThe Challenge Fund (the forerunner to the current Growth Fund) was launched to encourage collaborative tourism marketing campaigns across Scotland.

Stuart Duncan was voted the Hot Scot.\n\n2007\n\nThe first \"Winter White\" campaign launched (November 2007 – March 2008) encouraging visitors to explore the beauty of Scotland during the winter months, enjoying accommodation deals, winter sports, wildlife watching and country breaks.
