        "text": "The history of aviation in Aberdeen is long and storied.\n\nAn airport has served the Granite City since 1934 and popular carriers like Loganair and Ryanair are its principal link with the world. But it is often overlooked that Aberdeen once hosted the main base of a short-lived commuter airline during the 1970s and 80s.\n\nAir Ecosse, which branded itself as 'Your Friendly Scottish Airline' and 'The Businessman's Wings', was founded in June 1977 as a subsidiary of Fairflight Charters. It got off the ground by launching flights from Aberdeen to UK destinations including Glasgow, Manchester and Wick.\n\nREAD MORE: Aberdeen councillor calls for sacking of city's education leader in teacher strike row\n\nThe 1980s saw the airline expand, taking on mail flights for the Royal Mail and offering journeys to other UK cities. Flights to Ireland, the Faroe Islands and Denmark also started.\n\nTypes of aircraft the company used included the DHC-6 Twin Otter, the Short 330-200 and the Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante. As its name suggests, Scottishness was at the centre of the airline's marketing with cabin staff proudly donning tartan and aircraft bearing Saltires.\n\nAt the height of its popularity in 1985, the company employed 165 people. However, the airline's success did not last long, and in 1987 all flights were suspended when it entered administration amid financial troubles.\n\n1988 saw it taken over by Peregrine Air Services Limited and rebranded as Aberdeen Airways. But new ownership did little to change its fortunes, and operations finally ceased in 1992.\n\nNow, the bygone airline is consigned to history like so many long-lost carriers which have disappeared from our skies. But it is still fondly remembered by many as a major Aberdeen employer and an important piece in the history of flight in the city.\n\nREAD MORE: Plans for 117 Newmachar homes lodged with Aberdeenshire Council\n\nFive rushed to hospital as two cars crash on A947 near Banff\n\nParts of north-east to be hit with snow and ice as yellow warning in force\n\nFormer Aberdeen contact lens factory to be demolished for new flats"
