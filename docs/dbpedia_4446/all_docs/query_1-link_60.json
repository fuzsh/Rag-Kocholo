Since its launch in June 2004, the airline has carried over 2.4 million customers on nearly 17,000 flights on this route.\n\nToday, United operates daily year-round flights from Edinburgh to New York/Newark, with flights doubling from once to twice daily during the peak summer season 2024, as well as daily seasonal services from Edinburgh to Washington D.C. and Chicago O’Hare. United is the only airline offering year-round service from Edinburgh to the U.S. and offers more seats and flights from Scotland to the U.S. than all other U.S. airlines combined.\n\n“We are proud to the mark the 20th anniversary of our Edinburgh to New York/Newark service, offering the only year-round service from Edinburgh to the U.S.,” said Karolien De Hertogh, Director Sales UK and Ireland, United Airlines. “Our flights from Edinburgh to three of our U.S. mainland hubs provide our customers in Scotland with extensive travel choice and the possibility to connect onwards to over 150 destinations across the Americas for summer 2024. With such an important relationship between Scotland and the U.S., this route continues to facilitate business and tourism, benefitting the economy on both sides of the Atlantic.”\n\n“It’s fantastic to see United celebrate 20 years at Edinburgh Airport and 20 years of the Edinburgh to New York/Newark route,” said Gordon Dewar, Chief Executive of Edinburgh Airport. “Over that time, the route has been incredibly successful with more than two million people flying between our two destinations, and United’s overall presence has grown with additional routes to Chicago and Washington D.C. as they have made Scotland’s capital their home. That shows the confidence in Edinburgh and a strong relationship between airline and airport. We hope there are many more anniversaries to come – and maybe even some new routes along the way.”\n\nEdinburgh (EDI) – New York/Newark (EWR)\n\nFlight From To Depart Arrive Frequency Aircraft Dates of operation UA36 EDI EWR 9:40 12:20 Daily Boeing 757-200 Year round UA161 EDI EWR 13:50 16:30 Daily Boeing 757-200 24 May – 25 Sep 2024 UA37 EWR EDI 20:15 08:05+1 Daily Boeing 757-200 Year round UA162 EWR EDI 23:55 11:40+1 Daily Boeing 757-200 23 May – 24 Sep 2024\n\nNote: Between June 24 and August 16, 2024, UA 162 will not operate on Mon/Thu and UA 161 will not operate on Tue/Fri.\n\nAll times are local and are subject to change.\n\nUnited’s year-round service from Edinburgh to New York/Newark is operated with Boeing 757-200 aircraft, featuring a total of 176 seats – 16 flat-bed seats in United PolarisSM business class, 42 Economy PlusSM seats with added legroom and increased personal space and 160 seats in economy.\n\nUnited Polaris business class is a premium travel experience that prioritises relaxation and comfort, featuring quality inflight dining, amenity products and services from Therabody and Saks Fifth Avenue and full flat-bed seats.\n\nUnited Economy Plus offers added legroom and increased personal space.
