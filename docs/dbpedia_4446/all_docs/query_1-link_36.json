Edinburgh Airport has become the first in Scotland to achieve a global carbon accreditation as it continues to build on its Greater Good sustainability strategy.

Four airports have already reached the net zero emission, Level 5, in Toulon Hy√®res in France and Beja, Madeira and Ponta Delgada in Portugal.
