It’s partly why Rabbie’s was founded in the first place. Roving over Munros, descending into glens, traversing vast lochs - it’s unbeatable. And luckily it’s easy too. There’re plenty of connecting flights and train stations in Scotland linking the country’s main cities. However, the best way to travel around Scotland is aboard a small group tour. We may be biased but come on. A comfortable mini-coach filled with new friends. Mind-bogglingly beautiful views from panoramic windows. A friendly driver-guide regaling you with local legends and myths. You simply can’t get much better than that.\n\nJoin us to tick off bucket list destinations such as Loch Ness or the Isle of Skye. Or journey off the beaten track to hidden Highland gems. From day trips to multi-day tours, we’ve got you covered. It starts with direct flights to Scotland from the USA and ends with lifelong memories and stories to make everyone back home jealous.\n\nScotland really can be all four seasons in one day, but that’s part of the country's charm. It means that even if you visit the same place twice, the experience might be completely different on each occasion. All this makes Scotland one of the best solo travel destinations.\n\nExplore Scotland and Beyond With Rabbie’s\n\nFlights to Scotland from the USA can be just the beginning of your adventure. Explore other European destinations with us from the mythical Irish coast to the awe-inspiring architecture of Italy. See film sets come to life in key Bridgerton sites, or on our Outlander tours. Imagine you’re a royal as you swan through palaces and castles. Or enjoy a proper reset in the tranquillity of the Peak District. Whatever your vacation style, we have a tour for you.
