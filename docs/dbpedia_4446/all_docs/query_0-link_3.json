This is an excellent opportunity to inspire and engage young minds in the field of aerospace, fostering a passion for these subjects and potentially sparking interest in future careers within the industry.\n\n“Community projects like the International Ayr Show – Festival of Flight not only bring people together but also contribute to the growth and development of the region. Spirit’s involvement demonstrates our responsibility to the community and the desire to make a positive impact”.\n\nThe festival, which takes place at Ayr’s shorefront from Friday, September 8 to Sunday, September 10, is packed with thrilling aerial displays, family activities and attractions.\n\nCouncillor Alec Clark, the council’s spokesperson for tourism, said: “The company [Spirit] has bases all over the world and I’m sure their support will help put South Ayrshire on the map as host to the spectacular event we’re bringing to Ayr this September.\n\n“The promotion of STEM is a key factor of the festival and Spirit is clearly dedicated to raising awareness of the benefits of studying for a future career in this field.”\n\nRead next:\n\nScots whisky giants are given green light for new distillery operation in Ayrshire\n\nEyesore site next to Ayrshire houses to be turned into car wash facility\n\nName change and £500,000 makeover for popular bar after takeover\n\nTimeline on new Ayrshire super school unveiled as pupils set for post-summer holiday entry\n\n'Negotiations' ongoing as cinema chain eyes up Ayr Odeon following shock closure"
