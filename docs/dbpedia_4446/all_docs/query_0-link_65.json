        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nThe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was created when the Kingdoms of England and Scotland -- which previously had been distinct states under a single monarchy -- were joined under the 1701 Acts of Union. The island of Ireland was incorporated under the 1800 Acts of Union, while Wales had been part of the Kingdom of England since the 16th century. The United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and science. The 18th and 19th centuries saw the rapid expansion of the British Empire despite the loss of the Thirteen Colonies, and at its zenith in the early 20th century, the British Empire stretched over one fourth of the earth's surface. The first half of the 20th century saw two World Wars seriously deplete the UK's strength and the Irish Republic withdraw from the union. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council and a founding member of NATO and the Commonwealth of Nations, the UK pursues a global approach to foreign policy. The devolved Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1998.\n\nThe UK was an active member of the EU after its accession in 1973, although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union. However, motivated in part by frustration at a remote bureaucracy in Brussels and massive migration into the country, UK citizens in 2016 voted by 52 to 48 percent to leave the EU. On 31 January 2020, the UK became the only country to depart the EU -- a move known as \"Brexit\" -- after prolonged negotiations on EU-UK economic and security relationships.\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\ntotal: 68,459,055 United Kingdom\n\nmale: 34,005,445\n\nfemale: 34,453,610 (2024 est.)\n\ncomparison rankings : female 22; male 21; total 21\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Briton(s), British (collective plural)\n\nadjective: British\n\nEthnic groups\n\nWhite 87.2%, Black/African/Caribbean/black British 3%, Asian/Asian British: Indian 2.3%, Asian/Asian British: Pakistani 1.9%, mixed 2%, other 3.7% (2011 est.)\n\nLanguages\n\nEnglish\n\nnote: the following are recognized regional languages: Scots (about 30% of the population of Scotland), Scottish Gaelic (about 60,000 speakers in Scotland), Welsh (about 20% of the population of Wales), Irish (about 10% of the population of Northern Ireland), Cornish (some 2,000 to 3,000 people in Cornwall) (2012 est.)\n\nReligions\n\nChristian (includes Anglican, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, Methodist) 59.5%, Muslim 4.4%, Hindu 1.3%, other 2%, unspecified 7.2%, none 25.7% (2011 est.)\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 16.7% (male 5,872,937/female 5,592,665)\n\n15-64 years: 63.9% (male 22,062,643/female 21,702,401)\n\n65 years and over: 19.3% (2024 est.)

the United Kingdom is currently considered a high risk to travelers for circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV); vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is a strain of the weakened poliovirus that was initially included in oral polio vaccine (OPV) and that has changed over time and behaves more like the wild or naturally occurring virus; this means it can be spread more easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a sneeze, of an âinfectedâ person who received oral polio vaccine; the CDC recommends that before any international travel, anyone unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccine series; before travel to any high-risk destination, the CDC recommends that adults who previously completed the full, routine polio vaccine series receive a single, lifetime booster dose of polio vaccine\n\nObesity - adult prevalence rate\n\n27.8% (2016)\n\ncomparison ranking : 36\n\nAlcohol consumption per capita\n\ntotal: 9.8 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nbeer: 3.53 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nwine: 3.3 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nspirits: 2.35 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nother alcohols: 0.61 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\ncomparison ranking : total 24\n\nTobacco use\n\ntotal: 15.4% (2020 est.)\n\nmale: 17.3% (2020 est.)\n\nfemale: 13.5% (2020 est.)\n\ncomparison ranking : total 102\n\nCurrently married women (ages 15-49)\n\n50.7% (2023 est.)\n\nChild marriage\n\nwomen married by age 18: 0.1% (2020 est.)\n\nEducation expenditures\n\n5.5% of GDP (2020 est.)\n\ncomparison ranking : 55\n\nLiteracy\n\ntotal population: NA\n\nmale: NA\n\nfemale: NA\n\nSchool life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)\n\ntotal: 17 years\n\nmale: 17 years\n\nfemale: 18 years (2020)\n\nGovernment\n\nCountry name\n\nconventional long form: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland;
