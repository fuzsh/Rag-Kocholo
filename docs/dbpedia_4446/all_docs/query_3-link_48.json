It encompasses communities with distinct cultural identities, as well as historic landmarks and heritage sites that need to be protected for the generations to come.\n\nThe Galloway & Southern Ayrshire Biosphere Partnership is a non-profit organisation (registered Scottish charity SC044137) working across the UNESCO region, creating and facilitating projects that support conservation, education, climate resilience, and a sustainable local economy. We collaborate with multi-sector partners in initiatives that benefit people and nature alike.\n\nFind out more"
