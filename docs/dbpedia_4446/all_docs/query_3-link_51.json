North and East are covered in seperate profiles.\n\nGeography\n\nContinent: Europe\n\nSovereign State: United Kingdom\n\nCountry: Scotland\n\nCounty: Ayrshire\n\nGPS Coordinates: 55.283333, -4.7\n\nElevation: 60.0 m or 196.9 feet\n\nArea: 472 Square Miles\n\n[1][2][3][4][5]\n\nGeology\n\nThe 472 square miles of South Ayrshire consists mostly of rolling flat ground with some minor elevation changes.\n\nThe Ayrshire coast is home to some unusual and special geology. The rocks are some of the oldest in Scotland and are evidence of a great sea which existed around 500 million years ago. Rare gemstones and fossils can be found on the beaches, while Ailsa Craig granite is still used to make curling stones. Look out for pillow lava formations, formed when there were still active volcanoes in the area.\n\nPopulation\n\nJune 2019: 112,550\n\nGovernment\n\nThere have been many area boundaries set for Ayrshire through the centuries but the latest was formulated in 1996 whereby the geographical areas of Ayrshire County were established as South, North, and East areas. Each area was to be administered by a seperate council established in each of the three.\n\nIn 2017 South Ayrshire had 8 Wards with a total of 28 members representing Troon, Prestwick, Ayr North, Ayr East, Ayr West, Kyle,Maybole & North Carrick & Coylton, Girvan & South Carrick. From these Wards, multiple political parties co-exist to represent all residents and businesses within the South Ayrshire Council, those being Scottish National Party (SNP), Labour, and Independents. The South Ayrshire Council Headquarters is located in County Buildings, Wellington Square, Ayr.\n\nOverview\n\nSouth Ayrshire has a great history to it. It was a small village which was taken over by the English twice. Both William Wallace and Robert the Bruce were here and of course Robert Burns was born here as well as many other notable persons. The following descriptions per town provide more detail for the reader.\n\nTowns\n\nSouth Ayrshire has only five major towns, those being Ayr, Girvan, Maybole, Prestwick, and Troon, all located along or near the coast of the Firth of Clyde.\n\nAyr\n\nScottish Gaelic: Inbhir Àir\n\nPopulation: Approximately 46,000 Plus\n\nAyr is the largest town in both population and area within South Ayrshire.\n\nAyr dates back to the 1100's as a village and became the Royal Burgh of Ayr in 1205 by way of a Royal Charter granted by Scottish King William The Lion (1142-1214). William had traveled through Ayrshire in the late 1100's looking for a place to call home. In 1197 he built 'Ayr Castle' just south of the harbour and east of the beach in what would be today the area behind the former Ayr Academy. The castle sat high on a mound of dirt and was made of wood. From a 1480 ordinance map it indicates that the castle was of a triangular shape with two small towers and a larger main tower at the front gate facing the River Ayr. There are no known pictures of it but it is believed that it resembles the castle depicted on the Royal Seal of the Burgh of Ayr from 1205.. Fishing and farming spurred on the towns growth going forward.\n\nAyr has a lot of history being invaded by the English twice. Oliver Cromwell's occupation established a very large citadel built near the mouth of the River Ayr. Parts of the original citadel wall can still be seen today. It had a four foot thick interior rubble wall and a one foot thick exterior cut stone wall of which was brought by ship from Ardrossan Castle.\n\nBoth William Wallace and King Robert I (aka Robert the Bruce) fought the English in Ayr.\n\nFor a more complete description please see WikiTree: Ayr, Ayrshire One Place Study\n\nAyr Landmarks\n\nAuld Brig c. 1230\n\nLocated between River Street (North) and High Street (South)\n\nThe original Auld Brig was made of wooden timbers around 1230. It was rebuilt in 1588 and restored between 1907 and 1910 for the sum of 10,000 British Pounds. It remains today as a foot bridge between Newton-On-Ayr and Ayr's High Street.\n\nAuld Kirk The (old) Burgh Kirk of St. John the Baptist, c. 1200's\n\nLocated at Bruce Crescent and Citadel Place\n\nThis former site of the original wooden Kirk of St. John the Baptist. In 1560 the Reformation made catholic worship illegal in Scotland which lead to St. John's being used as a Protestant Kirk. A stone tower was built (c. 1300's) next to it which has survived through the centuries. Nothing remains of the Kirk itself.\n\nOliver Cromwell built his large citadel around the Kirk which eventually forced the members to seek another site and rebuilt anew.\n\nThe surrounding graveyard has the grave of Elizabeth Knox, daughter of John Knox and wife of minister John Welsh. Legend also has it that there is also the grave of Maggie Osborne, the local witch (See Notable People heading).\n\nAuld Kirk The (new) Auld Kirk of St. John The Baptist) c.1655\n\nLocated through The Kirkport at #112-116 High Street\n\nThis Kirk was built Cruciform (shape of a cross in plan view) as a replacement for the original St John the Baptist Kirk off Bruce Crescent and Eglinton Place which was displaced by Cromwell's Citadel.\n\nThe (new) Kirk was built on land formerly occupied by Francisca Friars around 1560 (aka Grey Friars Monastery. Cost to build was 20,827 British Pounds (1,733 Pounds Sterling). Cromwell did pledge 1,000 Merks (Pounds Stirling) towards the new Kirk.\n\nThe Kirk was restored in 1836 by architect David Bryce (1803-1876).\n\nAyr Academy c.,1796 (now Grammar School of Ayr)\n\nLocation: Fort Street, Ayr\n\nOriginally the town's 'Grammar Schule of Air' was present in the area of #4 Sandgate and dates back to 1233. In 1502 it became the 'Burgh Schule' and later back to 'Grammar Schule'. In 1796 a shift of the way schools were defined and in pursuit of a higher level of matriculation, the Grammar Schule became Ayr Academy. In 1800 a new building was completed on Fort street. This site became the new home of Ayr Academy. That building was rebuilt in 1880.\n\nThree stone head sculptures were placed above the Rectors office, these being David Wilkie (Painter), James Watt (Engineer), and Robert Burns (Poet), all of which represent the fields of Art, Science, and Literature. Ayr Academy vacated this building in 2018 when a new academy was built on the Craigie Estate to the Northeast, and the building on Fort street became once again the (new) Grammar School of Ayr in 2020.\n\nAyr Lighthouse c.1841\n\nLocation: Esplanade end\n\nDesigned by Robert Paton.\n\nAyr Pavilion c.1911\n\nLocation: Low green across from the beach (now 'Pirate Pete's), Ayr\n\nThis building now 'Pirate Pete's, an entertainment venue. Nicknames include 'The Piv' and 'The White Elephant by the Sea'. The front balusters came from the first new brig when it was demolished.\n\nBust of Sir William Wallace c.1810\n\nLocation: Newmarket Street, Ayr\n\nA bust of Sir William sits above the first store front. Local merchant Henry Cowan paid his own money to have the statue made.\n\nBurn's Statue Square c.1891\n\nLocation: Killnoch Street and the A70, Ayr\n\nThis green space proudly displays a statue of Scotland's National Poet Robert Burns. Affectionately named 'Rabbie Burns' he is facing South towards his birthplace of Alloway.\n\nOrnate ironwork that once surrounded the square was removed during WWII for the war effort. A statue of a solder is also located here as a memorial to the Royal Scots Fusiliers who died in various campaigns from 1877-1902. Most died from diseases rather than battle.\n\nFish Cross c.1539\n\nLocation: 45-45 High Street, Ayr\n\nWhile no longer visible, this location on High Street does have a plaque on the wall denoting its location. There is also a statue of a fisherman by Malcolm Robertson nearby which symbolizes the market town location where local folk sold their fish and vegetables.\n\nLoudoun Hall c.1513\n\nLocated at Fort Street and South Harbour Street\n\nIt's the oldest building currently in Ayr and was built by James Tait. It served as residence to the many Sheriffs of Ayr through the years. in 1539 it was sold to Sir Hugh Campbell who was Sheriff at that time. Sir Hugh died without a male heir (women could not be Sheriff) and the hall was sold to the Crown for 14,000 Merks (silver coins). In 1632 the hall was sold to James Chalmers. It continued to have many owners until 1938 when it was bought by Rev. Archibald MacKenzie who conveyed it to the Marques of Bute. The Marques restored it and his son Lord David Stuart presented it to the Saltire Society.\n\nOriginally Loudoun Hall had three bedrooms and vaulted ceilings on the ground floor, the main hall on the second floor, and attic space on the third. The wall were three feet thick which provided good insulation in both winter and summer. A wing had been added in 1534 by the Campbell's which was demolished sometime after WWII. The hall itself had no running water in the old days, only an outside well. The balcony's were used to discard the rubbish and also used as a toilet.\n\nMillers Folly c.1800's\n\nLocated on part of the citadel wall which can still be seen today along South Harbour Street.\n\nThe citadel wall had one remaining bastion on it when Baron John Miller bought the citadel property. He proceeded to add an extension which is known as 'Miller's Folly' today.\n\nNew Brig Original bridge c. 1788, Present bridge c.1878\n\nLocated on New Bridge Street between River Street (North) and High Street (South)\n\nThe original New Brig was built in 1788 by Alexander Stevens to a design by Robert Adam. It was demolished and rebuilt in red sandstone in 1878. Today it serves car and foot traffic from Newton-On-Ayr on the north side of the River Ayr to the town of Ayr on the south side.\n\nSt. John's Tower c.1500's\n\nLocation: 6 Eglinton Terrace, Ayr, Scotland\n\nOn this site, the wooden St. John the Baptist Kirk was built around the late 1100's. The existing tower was built of stone in the 1300's as part Kirk and was likely used as the bell tower. Both were taken over by Oliver Cromwell when he built his citadel nearby in 1562. The fort garrison divided up the church building for use as a chapel, a mill house and a storehouse, and the tower was used as an armoury and look-out.\n\nThe good people of Ayr Burgh likely decided that being part of an English fort was not what they wanted, and they decided to look elsewhere for a new Kirk location. As luck would have it, Cromwell was willing to get rid of the Scots off the site and offered 1000 Merks (about 600 Pounds Stirling) toward the Kirks new home. They took the offer and found property over by the River Ayr.\n\nAfter the Scots were back in power about year 1660, the citadel was dismantled along with the old wooden Kirk and the land was gifted by the crown to Hugh Montgomerie (1316-1369) the 7th Earl of Eglinton who named the property 'Mongomeriestoun' after his family name. He had a plan for a new separate town which never developed. And while the property changed hands within family Mongomerie, it remained somewhat an empty site except for the tower for almost the next two hundred years. It is likely that Archibald Montgomerie (1812-1861) the 13th Earl of Eglinton had had enough of the property and put in the hands of an auction house in the mid 1800's.\n\nWealthy John Miller (1821-1910 returned to Ayr in 1852 and felt he was in a good position to buy some property when he learned that Mongomeriestoun was to be auctioned off in Edinburgh and he set out to purchase it. He arrived too late in Edinburgh for the actual auction but finding that no one had purchased the property, he made a bid of 2,560 Pounds Stirling which was readily accepted, and he bought the property of the former citadel and the Barony of Montgomerieston that went with it.\n\nThe Kirk was long gone but the stone tower remained. Miller made Gothic changes to it from plans by local architect John Murdoch and called it 'Fort Castle'. After Milller's death, John Crichton-Stuart (1881-1947) the 4th Marquess of Bute bought up the property in 1924 for 2,700 British Pounds and restored it to its former glory to plans by architect James Kennedy Hunter (1907-1956). John Crichton-Stuart (1907-1956) the 5th Marquess of Bute gifted it to the town of Ayr in 1949, and it is now in the care of South Ayrshire Council.\n\nWhile the site came with a Barony, John Miller went ahead and called himself 'Baron', which he was not of course!\n\nTam-O-Shanter Inn c.1748\n\nLocated at 236 High Street\n\nThe 'Tam' as it's referred to was first owned by James Schearer until about 1849. The property was purchased by the Magistrates and Councilers of Ayr who passed it on to the Incorporation of Weavers Society (1850-1893). Then possession went to the 'Queen's and Lord Treasuers Remembrance', and then sold to Andrew Muir, a local brewer. The property passed through many more hands throughout the years. In 1955 it became a museum. Today's it a well know restaurant and pub for both locals and visitors alike.\n\nTry the great fish and chips!\n\nTown Hall and Spire c.1830\n\nLocated at Sandgate and High Street.\n\nIt stands 225 feet high and was design by Thomas Hamilton. The building also houses the town hall which accommodate about 600 people for meetings.\n\nWallace Tower (c. Unknown for original tower) (C. 1834 current tower).\n\nLocated at 172 High Street.\n\nThe original tower was purchased in 1673 by the Ayr Town Council from Burgess Adam Richie. A bell and clock were added in 1731 in a new belfry. In 1832 a restoration started taking place by adding a stone facing. Without a proper foundation the original building could not stand the weight and started to sink. It was demolished and a new tower build built in 1834.\n\nThe (current) tower stands 113 feet high. The inset statue is said to be by self taught sculptor James Thom. Two bells are in the tower. The larger one (c.1731) is from the original tower. It was made in France. The smaller bell (c.1834) was likely the bell from the 'Laigh Tolbooth'.\n\nWellington Square\n\nLocated at Wellington Square and Fort Street.\n\nThe 'Square is actually rectangular. It's a green space in front of the Court and County Building and named after the victor of Waterloo, Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington. There are various memorials in the square honoring: 13th Earl of Eglinton (aka Archibald William Montgomerie (1812-1861)), Brigadier-General James Neill (1810-1857), Sir James Fergusson of Kilkerran (1904-1973) Journalist and Historian, Sir Goscombe John (1910-XXXX) Postmaster General, John Loudon McAdam (1756-1836) Inventor of 'Tar McAdam' for road surfacing, and Primrose William Kennedy of Drumellan (1799-1863) Ayr Provost in 1855-1861.\n\nThe government building formerly held a prison (on the South end facing the ocean) and was known as \"The Cottage by the Sea' by prisoners. The prison portion was demolished in the early 1900's in favour of more government office space. FYI - The prisoners used to provide carpet cleaning services to the local residents. Strangely enough the residents were sad to see them go.\n\nGirvan\n\nScottish Gaelic: Inbhir Gharbhain\n\nPopulation: Approximately 6,500\n\nThis seaside town is located 21 miles from Ayr and it's history dates back to 1668 as a fishing village when it became a Burgh by Royal Charter of Charles II. The busy harbour area is located at the mouth of the 'Water Girvan'. It's highest surrounding peaks are Gray Hill at 974 feet, and Byne Hill at 703 feet.\n\nGirvan Landmarks\n\nStumpy Tower (aka Auld Stumpy) - Girvan\n\nLocated between Knockcushan Street and Dalrymple Street\n\nPerhaps the most striking building in Girvan is Auld Stumpy. This attractive clock tower was erected near the town's main junction over the period 1825-7. It later formed part of the McMaster Hall, built in 1911. The hall burned down in 1939, leaving Auld Stumpy as you see it now.\n\nMcKechnie Institute\n\n40 Dalrymple Street\n\nGreat small museum with historical displays.\n\nMaybole\n\nScottish Gaelic: Miniboll\n\nPopulation: Approximately 5,000\n\nDating back to around 1100, Maybole became a Burgh by Royal Charter in 1516 and located nine miles to the South of Ayr. The actual town sits inland about five miles from the Firth of Clyde and was home to the Earls of Cassillis for many generations.\n\nMaybole Landmarks\n\nBlairquhan Castle c.1824,\n\nLocated off B741 on private road\n\nSits on 200 acres of lush gardens.

The monks who inhabited the abbey were of the Cluniac Order.\n\nCulzean Castle c.1792\n\nLocated off Silver Avenue.\n\nStarted as a small estate but added to by the 9th and 10th Earls of Cassillis to designs by Robert Adam. The castle was not built as a defensive position.\n\nThe old 'Gas House' has been restored and the managers office has a tribute to William Murdoch (1754-1839) who invented lighting by coal gas.\n\nRecords indicate that the Kennedy's at one time had a slave servant named 'Scipio' who was brought from the West indies as a child. In 1725 he was granted his freedom by the Kennedy's but Scipio decided to stay on as as servant for many years after. He eventually married and had seven children. The Kennedy's were into smuggling of spirits and Scipio knew of this, maybe even participated. See profile below under notable people heading.\n\nElectric Brae\n\nLocated along the A719\n\nA gravity defying hills that appears to pull one's car uphill without the use of a motor.\n\nMaybole Castle c.1600\n\nLocated on High Street at Culzean Road\n\nHome of John Kennedy, the 6th Earl of Cassillis\n\nSouter Johnnie's Cottage c.\n\nLocation: 35 Main Rd, Kirkoswald, Maybole\n\nHome to souter (shoemaker) John Davidson who was the inspiration for Robert Burns' poem 'Tam-O-Shanter'. John built the cottage in 1785 and entertained Robert Burn's on many occasions.\n\nPrestwick\n\nScottish Gaelic: Preastabhaig\n\nPopulation: Approximately 16,000\n\nSits just North of Ayr on the Firth of Clyde and is basically a residential town. It's claim to fame is that it has the Glasgow-Prestwick Airport, as well as three golf courses St. Cuthberts, St. Nicholas, and Prestwick Golf Club where the first British Open was played on the 'Prestwick Old Course' in 1860.\n\nPrestwick Landmarks\n\nSt Nickolas Kirk c. 1100 (Ruins)\n\nLocated at the end of Kirk Street\n\nBruce's Well c. 13th century\n\nLocated at Maryborough Rd, Prestwick\n\nThe legend is that Robert the Bruces drank from the well of St. Ninians and was cured of leporsy.\n\nTroon\n\nScottish Gaelic: An Truthail\n\nPopulation: Approximately 16,000\n\nFounded by William Cavendish Bentinck Scott (1766-1854) the 4th Duke of Portland, this small town is home to a good sized fishing fleet, and has a history of shipbuilding (1815-2000) and now accommodates only ship repairs. It's main industry is again fishing and timber imports. It has a variety of residential homes up to and including 'Millionaires Row'. Troon is home to six golf courses with 'Royal Troon' being the most notable where multiple British Opens have been played.\n\nTroon Landmarks\n\nRoyal Troon Golf Club c.1878\n\nLocated at Craigend Road and Crosbie Road\n\nTroon Town Hall. c.1932\n\nLocated at Ayr Street and Academy Street\n\nThe hall was designed by James Miller.

This impressive looking church, that is well worth a visit.\n\nLocated on St Meddans Street at Cessnock Street.\n\nAlloway\n\n(a suburb of Ayr) (Actually considered a village)\n\nOther than the fact that Scotland's national bard Robert Burns (aka Rabbie Burns) was born here, there are several 'tourist' spots of historical significance in Alloway. Originally Alloway the village became a suburb of Ayr in 1935. The 'town' if you want to call it that consists of a pharmacy, post office, flower shop, and a tea room on Monument Road (B7024) which is about a mile from Ayr. It's likely that Robert the Bruce rode through Alloway from his birthplace at Turnberry Castle down the coast on his way to Ayr.\n\nFor a more complete description please see WikiTree: Ayr, Ayrshire One Place Study\n\nAlloway Landmarks\n\nBurns Cottage\n\nLocated on Alloway Road at Doonholm Road\n\nThis well known venue was built by Robert's father William Burnes (original spelling) who married Agnes Broun in 1758 and where they raised their family for the first seven years of Robert's life.\n\nWilliam was a tenant farmer but the land in this area was 'sour' at the time and the family kept moving trying to find better soil to work. William continued to own the cottage after the family moved and sold it in 1781. It even became an ale house at one point.\n\nWilliam died in 1784. Rooms were added on over the years but in recent times the cottage has been restored back to its original configuration. It is now the main tourist attraction of Alloway which welcomes visitors from all over the world to see what life was like in the cottage many centuries past.\n\nBrig-O-Doon House\n\nLocated on Alloway road just South of the Auld Kirk\n\nNext down the road is the Brig O' Doon House, the only hotel in Alloway. It's not a large venue but its a quality one. The tea room/bar is a cozy place for a cup of tea and some fresh scones. The hot chocolate with fresh cream and coconut is a chocolate lovers dream come true. The tea room even has tartan carpet.\n\nWalk east to the newer brig (1816) where you will get some very scenic shots of the old 'Brig O' Doon' in all its glory. Walk back down into the garden of the hotel and take more up close photos of the brig. Sit on the bench and enjoy the serenity of the River Doon as it flows by with the sound of sheep grazing on the other side of the river.\n\nBrig O' Doon\n\nLocated behind the Brig-O Doon Hotel on Alloway Road\n\nTranslated it means (bridge over the River Doon) and was made famous in Robert Burns poem 'Tam O Shanter' whereby a gentleman named Tam arrived at the Auld Kirk on his horse Meg after a night of drinking in Ayr. He saw the witches dancing and called out to them in a drunken stupor. They then chased him and Meg across the brig. Is it a true story, only tam knows and he's not talking.\n\nFYI - Robert's poem 'Tam O Shanter' is classified as a 'Tale'. The brig was built sometime in the late 1400's to early 1500's and spans around seventy feet across at a height of twenty-five feet above the river. It's a pedestrian only link between the district of Kyle (Alloway side) and the district of Carrick on the east side.\n\nBurns Monument and Gardens\n\nLocated behind the Brig-O Doon Hotel on Alloway Road\n\nWas completed in 1823 for the sum of 3,200 British Pounds. It's made of sandstone and sits on a triangular base, and has a cupola supported by nine Corinthian columns representing the nine muses of Greek mythology.\n\nBack on the main road one can either walk to 'Auld Nick's View' or drive up via 'Murdoch's Lone', both of which take you to the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum and gift store. This will round out your visit to Alloway and the 'Bards' connection.\n\nKirk Alloway\n\nLocated on Alloway Road at Auld Nick's View\n\nA little ways east down the road, one will come to the Auld Kirk sitting up above street level.

The last coal mine was shut down in 2002. Transportation of coal was tough until the trains came in which allowed coal to be dispersed to more communities further afield.\n\nSources\n\n↑ South Ayrshire Council; https://www.south-ayrshire.gov.uk/\n\n↑ Love, Dane, Ayrshire - Discovering A County, Fort Publishing, 2003\n\n↑ Wikipedia; https://en.wikipedia.org\n\n↑ Britannica; https://www.britannica.com\n\n↑ St. John's Tower of Ayr; https://www.stjohnstower.com/history\n\n↑ Wikipedia; https://en.wikipedia.org\n\n↑ Britannica; https://www.britannica.com\n\n↑ Love, Dane - Ayrshire, Discovering a County, Fort Publishing, 2003\n\n↑ Wikipedia; https://en.wikipedia.org\n\n↑ Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame; https://engineeringhalloffame.org\n\n↑ National Records of Scotland; https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk\n\n↑ Lives Retold; https://livesretold.co.uk/william-arrol\n\n↑ Family Search Website; https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/9W4G-SZB\n\n↑ Wikipedia; https://en.wikipedia.org\n\n↑ Maybole; https://www.maybole.org\n\n↑ Britanniaca; https://www.britannica.com\n\n↑ Wikipedia; Wikipedia; https://en.wikipedia.org\n\n↑ Historic UK; https://www.historic-uk.com\n\n↑ Historic UK; https://www.historic-uk.com\n\n↑ Undiscovered Scotland; https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk\n\n↑ Wikipedia; https://en.wikipedia.org\n\n↑ National Records of Scotland; https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk\n\n↑ Wikipedia; https://en.wikipedia.org\n\n↑ Geni; https://www.geni.com\n\n↑ Family Search; https://www.familysearch.org\n\n↑ Wikipedia; https://en.wikipedia.org\n\n↑ Family Search; https://www.familysearch.org\n\n↑ The Scotsman; https://www.scotsman.com\n\n↑ Wikipedia; https://en.wikipedia.org\n\n↑ Christianity Today; https://www.christianitytoday.com\n\n↑ Britannica; https://www.britannica.com\n\n↑ Interesting Engineering; https://interestingengineering.com\n\n↑ South Ayr History; https://southayrshirehistory.wordpress.com\n\n↑ Daily Record; https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk\n\n↑ Presbytery of Ayr; http://www.presbyteryofayr.org.uk/stjohnstower.html\n\n↑ Wikipedia; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Murdoch\n\n↑ Robert Burns; http://www.robertburns.org/encyclopedia/MurdochJohn1747-1824\n\n↑ Dictionary of Scottish Architects; www.scottisharchitects.org\n\n↑ South Ayrshire Council; https://southayrshirehistory.wordpress.com\n\n↑ Ayr Advertiser article Dated 30, Oct 2020; https://www.ayradvertiser.com\n\n↑ Wikipedia; https://en.wikipedia.org\n\n↑ Britannica; https://www.britannica.com\n\n↑ McIntyre, Dougal, Prestwick's Pioneer, Woodfield Publishing, 2004\n\n↑ Wikipedia; https://en.wikipedia.org\n\n↑ Britannica;https://www.britannica.com\n\n↑ National Records of Scotland; https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk\n\n↑ People Pill; https://peoplepill.com\n\n↑ Wikipedia; https://en.wikipedia.org\n\n↑ Love, Dane, Ayrshire - Discovering A County, Fort Publishing, 2003\n\n↑ Love, Dane, Ayrshire - Discovering A County, Fort Publishing, 2003\n\n↑ Wikipedia; https://en.wikipedia.org\n\n↑ Britannica; https://www.britannica.com\n\n↑ Wikipedia; https://en.wikipedia.org\n\n↑ Britannica; https://www.britannica.com\n\n↑ Geni; Geni; https://www.geni.com\n\n↑ Banner of Truth Magaizine article 1978; http://www.banneroftruth.co.uk"
