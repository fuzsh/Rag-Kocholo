        "text": "For the first time in eight years, the 2024 Open Championship has returned to Royal Troon for the 10th playing of golf’s oldest major at the famed Scottish links.\n\nAt the last edition held there in 2016, Henrik Stenson and Phil Mickelson had a duel for the ages which resulted in Stenson setting the then-major-championship scoring record of 20-under 264. Troon sits in one of the most golf-rich areas in the world, but if you’re not a geography expert, don’t worry, we have you covered.\n\nWhere is Royal Troon Golf Club?\n\nLike the U.S. Open at Pinehurst, which was in the charming village of Pinehurst, the Open host, Troon, is in another cozy town: Troon, Scotland. Troon is on a seaport and in the council area of South Ayrshire, a region along the southwestern coast of Scotland.\n\nTroon is about 40 minutes from Glasgow, Scotland, the country’s biggest city and the site of its second busiest airport, making Troon a logical choice to either begin or end a linksland golf trip. But don’t confuse Glasgow Airport with Glasgow Prestwick Airport, the international airport whose runway starts just a few hundred yards from Troon’s famous “Postage Stamp” par-3 8th.\n\nRoyal Troon is home to not only the Old course that is hosting this week’s championship but also the 18-hole Portland course and a nine-hole par-3 called the Craigend course.\n\nJust a stone’s throw from the club, literally adjacent, is Prestwick Golf Club, which was the original home of the Open. Members of the two clubs have played competitions playing nine holes on one course out to the other, playing another nine to the other clubhouse, then reversing the order to head back after lunch.\n\nThe two clubs are part of a remarkable 21-mile stretch of coastline that includes St. Nicholas, Western Gailes, Dundonald Links, Gailes Links, Irvine GC and West Kilbride. All of these courses are famously adjacent to a railway, adding to the intrigue.\n\nJust 40 more minutes to the south lies Turnberry, another classic Open venue that has hosted the championship four times.\n\nHow do I watch the Open Championship on TV?\n\nUSA and NBC will air the 2024 Open Championship on TV. USA will carry the first and second rounds on Thursday and Friday, as well as early coverage on the weekend. NBC will carry the third and final rounds on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nHere’s the full TV schedule for the week (ET):\n\nThursday, July 18: 4 a.m.-3 p.m. (USA)\n\nFriday, July 19: 4 a.m.-3 p.m. (USA)\n\nSaturday, July 20: 5-7 a.m. (USA); 7 a.m.-3 p.m. (NBC)\n\nSunday, July 21: 4-7 a.m. (USA); 7 a.m.-2 p.m. (NBC)\n\nHow do I watch the Open Championship online, streaming?\n\nPeacock will be the primary streaming home for the 2024 Open Championship.\n\nSIGN UP FOR PEACOCK PREMIUM TO STREAM THE 2024 OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP\n\nHere’s the complete Open Championship streaming schedule (ET):\n\nTHURSDAY, JULY 18\n\nEarly Round 1 Coverage: 1:30-4 a.m. (Peacock)\n\nFeatured Groups, Hole: All day (Peacock)\n\nLate Round 1 Coverage: 3-4:15 p.m. (Peacock)\n\nFRIDAY, JULY 19\n\nEarly Round 2 Coverage: 1:30-4 a.m. (Peacock)\n\nFeatured Groups, Hole: All day (Peacock)\n\nLate Round 2 Coverage: 3-4:15 p.m. (Peacock)\n\nSATURDAY, JULY 20\n\nNBC Round 3 Coverage: 7 a.m.-3 p.m. (Peacock)\n\nFeatured Groups, Hole: All day (Peacock)"
