        "text": "The Scottish government has confirmed that it plans to take Glasgow Prestwick Airport into public ownership.\n\nThe step was confirmed in a statement by Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in the Scottish Parliament.\n\nThe airport, which was put up for sale last March by New Zealand-based owners Infratil, has been running annual losses of Â£2m.\n\nRyanair, which operates 27 routes from Prestwick, has welcomed the government takeover.\n\nMinisters will now enter detailed negotiations with Infratil on the terms of sale.\n\nMs Sturgeon told MSPs some private investors had expressed an interest in the airport but it had become clear none was able to commit to buying Prestwick on a timescale that was acceptable to Infratil.\n\nShe said the Infratil board had been considering its options, one of which was to seek commercial discussions with a view to public sector ownership and the other being to close the airport.\n\nMs Sturgeon said ministers had \"examined carefully\" the implications and consequences of both options before making their decision.\n\nShe argued that the closure of Prestwick would be a \"serious and unwelcome development\" for the Ayrshire and the Scottish economies, with about 1,400 jobs linked directly or indirectly with the airport.\n\nShe said: \"We believe Prestwick Airport can have a positive future.\n\n\"It will require investment and it will take time. However, we believe it can be returned to profitability.\n\n\"We also estimate that the cost of closure to the public purse would be very significant and this is an important factor in our decision.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon described public ownership of airports as \"a familiar concept\", pointing out that the Scottish government already had responsibility for 11 airports through Highlands and Islands Airports Limited.\n\nShe also argued that some other major UK airports - including Manchester, Stansted, Newcastle and Cardiff - were owned wholly or substantially by the public sector.\n\nShe added: \"I can therefore advise parliament that the Scottish government has advised the current owners of our intention to commence a process towards acquisition of Prestwick Airport.\n\n\"Following the agreement of its board earlier today in Shanghai, we are entering into negotiations with Infratil for the potential acquisition of Prestwick Aviation Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries.\n\n\"Conclusion of this process will, of course, be subject to the Scottish government carrying out confirmatory due diligence.\n\n\"The terms of sale will be on a commercial basis and in accordance with the market economy investment principle.\""
