        "text": "By Oona Patrick, Contributor (*)\n\nThe Dzanc Books/CNC DISQUIET International Literary Program, a summer program that began in 2011, finished its second two-week adventure in Lisbon, Portugal, on July 13. The program brings 60 North American and international writers to the city for workshops in fiction, nonfiction, and poetry. The program and its local sponsors also host events in which participants can meet well known writers, editors, translators, and experts on Portuguese literature. Portuguese guests have included José Luis Peixoto, Patrícia Reis, Jacinto Lucas Pires, Gonçalo M. Tavares, and António Lobo Antunes (in 2011).\n\nDISQUIET also features a multi-genre workshop called “Writing the Luso Experience” created for writers from North America who have a genealogical link to Portugal or another Lusophone country. Last year the workshop provided support and community for emerging writers, many of whom had met few, if any other Luso-American writers before. More than one participant in the 2011 program called the experience “life-changing.”\n\nThe significance of the Luso-American aspects of DISQUIET had become quite apparent by the start of the 2012 program. The Portuguese-American academic Luis Gonçalves told me in June of this year that he now sees “two eras in Portuguese-American writing: Before Disquiet and After Disquiet.” During the program orientation on July 1, I tried to summarize why this program has become so important to emerging Luso-American writers. As the program’s Luso-American Liaison, and also as a participant in the 2011 workshop, I described how DISQUIET had become something larger in our lives than a two-week seminar, and how part of its unique strength is that it includes us within a larger literary community that is already interested in Portugal.\n\nWith 14 participants plus workshop leader Frank X. Gaspar and myself, the 2011 “Writing the Luso Experience” workshop is thought to have been among the largest gatherings of Luso-American writers ever. Four writers were fully funded by scholarships from the Luso-American Development Foundation (FLAD), and a fifth received a special Canadian-Portuguese scholarship from the Instituto Camões. One of the most memorable moments occurred on the first day of workshop, when we went around introducing ourselves, and nearly every participant shared a story about beginning to write and thinking that they were the only Luso-American writer, or at least the only writer in their community. There was a sense of excitement at discovering the many experiences we had in common, and of relief that our isolation seemed to be coming to an end.\n\nFinding the Way Back to the Luso Roots\n\nThis year another full workshop met. It happened to consist entirely of women, three of them full scholarship winners funded by FLAD. Additional Luso-American participants took part in other DISQUIET workshops as well, bringing the total number of Luso-Americans to have gone through the program to 30. Once again we opened with discussions of finding our way back to our Luso roots, experiences of being misunderstood in the U.S., and how to get attention for Luso writing in the future. There were poets, fiction writers, and memoirists of all ages represented. They hailed from Boston, California, Canada, Cape Cod, Colorado, Florida, New Bedford, and New York. One had even returned for a second year.\n\nThe DISQUIET workshops meet in the headquarters of the program’s Portuguese partner, the Centro Nacional de Cultura, which has a history as a gathering place of subversive writers and intellectuals, many of whom had a hand in the Portuguese Revolution in 1974. Every few minutes, Lisbon’s famous tram number 28 squeals by in the street below, causing a pause in the conversation, a pause during which, we were told, the revolutionaries used to conspire in whispers to each other, without fear of being overheard.\n\nIn these rooms in 2011, in the breaks between workshopping pieces, Gaspar inspired the first workshop to start a literary movement for Luso-American writers, to be called Presence/Presença (after the influential 20th-century Portuguese literary journal). That group continued after DISQUIET ended, and told this new group of writers about some of its activities, although many had already become aware of them through our online discussion group. The Presence/Presença group on Facebook, begun after the 2011 DISQUIET, grew into something unexpected. I had imagined that we might find 40 or 50 additional people to join us when I first created the group page, but we have since recruited 130 members. Many new members have told the now familiar story: they had felt alone until finding us, or had never met another Luso-American writer, or had never before felt comfortable identifying as a Luso-American writer, even if they were first generation.\n\nI’ve read that the current generation of Luso-Americans is the most highly educated ever. It seems natural that this would result in this rising tide of emerging writers, many of them the first generation in their families to attend college (this is something else that a number of us at DISQUIET have had in common). Quite a few have attended MFA programs or plan to, and are looking for more of the supportive and positive environments that many MFA programs are providing for creative people. It’s important to note that most of these programs work hard to create a welcoming space for women, racial minorities, and gay people—people who may often feel that they are on the margins.\n\nConnecting Through Common Memories\n\nThe first reading in the DISQUIET program that was directly related to Luso-American writing was Frank X. Gaspar’s poetry reading at the New University of Lisbon on July 3. One of the prose poems that he read from his book Late Rapturous, which had just been published, begins in the town where we both grew up:\n\n“I was sitting up on the graves in Provincetown, my back against the old Gaspar stone, and I could feel my grandfather angry and restless and hating to be dead. He wanted to laugh and walk along the wharves and streets and be greeted and hailed and loved, and drink cheap wine again. I should have brought that other stone with me, the black lava rock from Pico Azores that I plucked from the beach outside of what is maybe the little village that all the old ones harbored from, how I could push it into the sandy earth and cover it over and something at last would be done. One day I will bear it here.”\n\nThe urge he describes here is to bring a family’s story full circle, to retrieve something from the place of origin and literally bury it in order to repair a breach or quiet a ghost. This impulse seems to be behind much of the Luso-American writing of those whose families lost touch with Portugal or avoided passing on memories of it.\n\nThe following day, DISQUIET and FLAD held a dinner in celebration of the work of Brown University Professor Onésimo Almeida at Café no Chiado, which is on the street level of the CNC’s building. Almeida told a moving story of coming to the bookstore that once filled this space, as it was one of the few places in which books banned by the dictatorship’s censors could be secretly procured. FLAD also hosted a celebration of the relaunch of Alfred Lewis’ (1902–77) Home Is an Island by Tagus Press on July 5, featuring UMass Dartmouth Professor and Tagus Press founder Frank Sousa, as well as the Portuguese writer and TV personality Rui Zink.\n\nThis republication of the first novel by a Portuguese-American immigrant to be published by a major New York publisher has been a long time coming. When I first heard about Lewis some years ago, I had to visit the rare books room of a university library to read the book in their reading room, and I felt the injustice of its obscurity. Home Is an Island gives us the perspective of a boy growing up on Flores Island in the Azores, which is not so unusual now, but it appeared at a time when there were few such voices to be found in English about the Azores. It’s important that Lewis be available for this new generation of Luso-American writers and readers. It’s both empowering to be able to point to a successful Luso-American writer who published with Random House in 1951, and it’s good to know our true history: that none of us are really the first, and we have a tradition to both follow and attempt to transcend.\n\nAnother event with some relevance to Luso-Americans who write about views of Portugal and the Portuguese in North America (and the history of discrimination) was the Roundtable on Foreign Travel Writing on Lisbon, which featured several distinguished scholars from the New University of Lisbon. The panel raised the question of why so many Anglo and Anglo-American writers had written such disparaging lines about Portugal, to the point where these attitudes became an undercurrent in some traditional Anglo views of the country.\n\nThe Luso-American participants took part in all the other events of the DISQUIET program, bonding with Lusophiles and those who were completely new to Portuguese culture alike. The program’s nonliterary events included a visit to Portuguese artist Paula Rego’s museum, Casa das Histórias, as well as a film screening, and a fado excursion. The film director Bruno Almeida screened his Art of Amália documentary, and this was followed by an evening trip to fado houses frequented by locals. This led to two unexpected encounters: a very small boy playing bits of a fado on a guitar on the sidewalk outside the restaurant with his father later went inside and played a set to an obviously adoring crowd. He turned out to be the great-nephew of the fadista Amália Rodrigues. Another man talking outside the restaurant with Almeida and other friends of the program turned out to be the famous contemporary fado singer Camané.\n\nMultiple events helped participants increase their understanding of the great poet Fernando Pessoa, including an intricately planned walking tour led by Philip Graham, the author of The Moon, Come to Earth: Dispatches from Lisbon; a workshop called “The Fernando Pessoa Game” led by poet Terri Witek; and a talk placing Pessoa in the context of other 20th-century Portuguese poets by the translator Richard Zenith, who last year treated us to a presentation of photographs and previously unpublished materials from his upcoming biography of Pessoa.\n\nOne of the biggest events toward the end of the two weeks was the reading and discussion with the writer Gonçalo M. Tavares in a beautiful room at FLAD that opens out onto a garden. While Tavares’ talk, enhanced by simultaneous translation, did not touch on Luso-American issues directly, what he spoke about was relevant for all of us as writers. He reminded us of the realities of the writing life that we were all about to return to: that it requires long periods of “silence, solitude, and immobility.”\n\nOn the last day of the Luso-American workshop, Gaspar repeated his exhortation from 2011 to do “three things differently” in our writing lives. I said a few words about Presence/Presença projects and our future in general. I repeated what is often said: that despite the important successes of writers such as Alfred Lewis, Frank X. Gaspar, Katherine Vaz, and others, Luso-Americans are still awaiting our Toni Morrison or Maya Angelou, the powerhouse writer whose success will break us out into the mainstream.\n\nAs the scholar Reinaldo Silva puts it:\n\n“Portuguese-American literature is evidently beyond an embryonic stage. It is ethnic literature in its own right. My contention is that a truly ethnic literature emerges when second or third-generation American-born voices attempt to retrieve their ancestors’ roots so as to learn more about where they came from. Such is the case with Gaspar. The great Portuguese-American ethnic novel, however, is yet to be written.”\n\nSeeking More Visibility\n\nPresence/Presença, true to its name, is insisting on more visibility in the meantime. The first group reading of Luso-American writers ever at the AWP writer’s conference (an annual conference now attended by as many as 10,000 people) took place this March in Chicago, organized by DISQUIET 2011 alum Millicent Accardi. This was followed by more readings in Portuguese communities, including a multilingual event in Montreal in June coordinated by fellow alum Richard Simas, and a reading featuring José Luis Peixoto and Portuguese-American writers in Ironbound in Newark, which was organized by Professor Luis Gonçalves and also took place in June. More are planned, including one at the Cape Cod Cultural Center on August 30 featuring Frank X. Gaspar and organized by poet and active Presence/Presença member José Gouveia, and in several other locations in the fall and spring. The new links forged between previously isolated community organizers on both coasts and in Canada are part of why these events are happening in such rapid succession.\n\nThere are also related projects ongoing in Portugal. Pen Pal in Translation, for example, is a project coordinated by Rui Azevedo and others at the University of Lisbon’s Centre for English Studies, another DISQUIET partner. It has led to university students translating into Portuguese the work of a number of emerging Luso-American writers, many of whom have attended DISQUIET.\n\nIn all, what the DISQUIET program has done, besides providing the first Luso-American workshop, giving us a place to create a community of creative people (many of whom would be marginalized in traditional environments), and connecting far-flung community leaders, is to give us a larger world of English-language readers, writers, reviewers, and publishers with whom to collaborate. DISQUIET has become an escape hatch out of isolation, insularity, and obscurity.\n\n_______________\n\n(*) Oona Patrick is a native of Provincetown, Massachusetts, who lives in Brooklyn, New York.

While many others sit around talking big about what they are going do some day, Sousa is busy taking care of business (or as Elvis called it TCB).\n\nEarly next year, Tagus Press,at UMASS/Dartmouth, will publish his first collection of stories, Almost Gone, marking a milestone in Sousa’s professional career and adding a new voice in fiction to the growing oeuvre of talented Portuguese-American writers, who are rapidly establishing a new branch of ethnic literature.\n\nThe short fiction in this upcoming collection, feature a close look Sousa says, “at a family of working-class Portuguese Americans from the inside out.” And that “In many ways, they could be any set of people facing the challenges that immigration adds to the already complicated world of human interaction — adolescence, love, relationships, loss, regret, betrayal — but in other ways, they are distinctly Portuguese.”\n\nHis work is also featured in a recent Rutgers University Press anthology Luso-American Literature: Writings by Portuguese-Speaking Authors in North America. In 2007, he was awarded a fellowship by the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, and he received an Honorable Mention, in the Titan Literary Press Award for Short Fiction.\n\nAvoiding saudade (a term difficult to translate from Portuguese but which loosely means a longing for what was lost), Sousa writes about human problems, and he does it in such a way that links together multiple generations of families, thus not only establishing a present, but also establishing a genuine past.\n\nSousa declares that he would like his writing to be “meaningful and layered; but…entertaining too.” Themes of humor, loss, love, sex, violence – are all “fair game” because as he puts it, “these are the things that make up the human experience.”\n\nSousa grew up in the Ocean State, currently lives in Boston, teaches writing at Boston College and writes music reviews for Mule Variations. He has been published in a variety of literary journals such as Babilonia, Quiddity, Gávea-Brown, and Writer Magazine. His research interests include “the ways in which we are tied to our pasts ethnically and culturally and. . .the tension between good and evil.”\n\nFor this interview for the Portuguese American Journal, Brian Sousa answers questions about being Portuguese, his writing, his music and his life.\n\nBeing Portuguese\n\nQ: Can you describe your background and family? Are you first generation PA or were you born in Portugal?\n\nA: My grandparents, on my father’s side, were born in Ribamondego, mainland Portugal, and my father was born in Providence, RI. After my father was born, the family went back to Portugal for a few years, and planned to stay there for good, but plans changed, and they returned to the States permanently. My grandparents lived in Cumberland, RI, and my father remembers growing up in what was essentially a Portuguese neighborhood; Valley Falls, where people helped each other adapt, and also maintained a strong sense of community. For example, a guy named Jack Amaral gave all new immigrants from his home town in Portugal (and nearby) food and groceries on credit until they found jobs.\n\nQ: What about being Portuguese-American informs your writing?\n\nA: For me, it is an indirect, almost evanescent thing. When I set out to write a collection of stories, the first character that appeared was Nuno, a Portuguese immigrant who would not have been out of place in Cumberland, Rhode Island; where my father grew up, and my grandfather still lives. I actually ended up with the story set in Southern RI. There was a palpable moment a few years ago — and this surfaced again at Disquiet — where I asked myself: why am I writing about this stuff? Where did it come from? Ultimately, it comes from what was an aspect of my childhood, I suppose, and an interest in the process of assimilation and adaptation that all immigrants go through. The idea of memory and tradition, and the loss of these things, really interests me as a writer and a person.\n\nQ: Who are your favorite Portuguese writers? And what do you like about their work?\n\nA: I love Frank Gaspar’s work. His poetry collection, Field Guide to the Heaven made me go back and try writing poetry again after giving it up for ten years, it’s just a magical book. He has a new book out that I just pre-ordered, I’m stoked! There were a number of writers that I was turned onto after Disquiet last year—José Luis Peixoto, for example—and of course there’s Antunes and Pessoa.\n\nQ: Is there a word or song that speaks to you, in your life, or your writing?\n\nA: My Grandfather used to say “sempre p’ra frente” to my father when he was growing up, and he, in turn, said it to me when he felt I needed to hear it. Roughly, it means “always forward.” I actually repeat that to myself now, as a reminder not to dwell on anything for too long.\n\nQ: Can you foresee Portuguese literature taught in the US as a survey course, for example, like Afro-American Literature is taught now?\n\nA: Absolutely. It’s such a rich field, and it’s both relatable and unique. The writing is charged. More people should read it.\n\nQ: Do you have family in Portugal?\n\nA: My grandfather has cousins there – some in Lisbon, some in the northern part of the country. Last time we had dinner together, in Lisbon, was during the 2008 European Cup tournament. My grandfather was arguing with his cousin about soccer, of course. It was great.\n\nLife\n\nQ: What’s your Portuguese favorite food? Drink? Ever write about these things?\n\nA: I’m still getting over the food in Lisbon last summer; it was insanely good. I loved Frank Gaspar’s story of how he sometimes writes with a cup of coffee on one side and a bourbon on the other. I’m a bourbon drinker, too, so I’ve tried it out. It’s a damn good technique.\n\nQ: What was your first job and how (if it did?) did it fortell or shape your future career choices or work ethic?\n\nA: Hmm…I’ve had a lot of odd jobs: parking lot attendant, busboy, barback, waiter, bartender, landscaper, cashier at a bookstore, snowboard instructor…I think my first job was as a busboy at an Italian restaurant. I was horrible at it–slow, distracted, confused, you name it–and if anything, it made me realize that I needed to find something else to do.\n\nWriting, Interviewing and Music\n\nQ: You interview musicians, review music. How does this “inform” or affect your fiction?\n\nA: For me, it’s all linked, for better or for worse. My teaching informs my writing; my songwriting informs my fiction and vice-versa; my poetry informs my songwriting… For better, I think this kind of openness is where new ideas come from; I hope that I’m consciously working on one thing while subconsciously working on another. For worse, I have notes to myself all over the place — post-its, scraps, in my phone, on my syllabus, on my arm…and they’re all disconnected. I’ll have a note about a song on an essay assignment, or poetry on an album review…I also tend to write all over my mail, which is strange. I love writing on full envelopes, which causes its own problems.\n\nQ: As an interviewer, what is your first priority?\n\nA: Only ever interviewed musicians, but I just want to try to make them think. That’s it. A lot of times, they’ve given a ton of interviews that day or week, and they’re just phoning it in, maybe even against their will. I want to challenge them.\n\nQ: You play in a band. What sort of music is it?\n\nA: I said I’d pay you a cool fifty bucks if you asked me this question, right? Thanks! Yeah, we’re called Ocean Transfer, been playing around Boston for a little while, and are starting to branch out now — just played NYC this Spring and are now playing our first festival. It’s kind of an Indie-Pop sound we have going, with acoustic influences and harmonies. I play guitar and sing, along with our other singer-songwriter, Josh Rollins. I write a good amount of the lyrics, but I rarely pen an entire song without the other guys helping me out. I probably get too literary. I don’t know. Josh says I’m too dark in my lyrics. Seems to be a recurring theme.\n\nQ: Can you share a memorable line from a writer you admire?\n\nA: I became obsessed with Ernest Hemingway in high school, and then did my time with Raymond Carver, Faulkner, some more of the classic American writers. But I’ll read anything, and I love contemporary stuff. I had a period of being very into Tom Robbins; I was surprised to love Steven King’s last book; I still re-read books by Bukowski and Kerouac. Based on the books I assign to read in my classes, I’m all over the place. I just read The Hunger Games — in part because I’d love to try to write a YA novel some day — and I loved it. Dellilo, TC Boyle, Rick Bass, Denis Johnson, Russel Banks, Tom Wolfe, Lise Haines, Cheryl Strayed; far too many to name.\n\nQ: Do you consider yourself a romantic and an idealist? Or something else entirely?\n\nA: Sometimes people read my work and say “Man, that’s dark…” But I’m definitely an idealist. Generally, I still have a lot of faith in people, and despite being shocked by the news sometimes, I tend to think that things will get better. I think I get that from my parents — they were always really positive, collectively, growing up. If I screwed up, I could learn from it and move on. I was taught early on that if I worked hard, I could keep my dreams big, and they’ve helped inspire me to do that. As for romantic…you’ll have to ask my girlfriend. I did buy her a plant the other day…\n\nQ: Can you describe your interests, primary and secondary?\n\nA: Hmm, I don’t know how to categorize these, but I’m interested in: all forms of writing, all forms of music (playing, listening, writing about it), sports—especially soccer and my Boston pro teams, sports that people don’t consider sports (snowboarding, skateboarding, surfing)—and travel, which is a huge interest, though I don’t get to do it as much as I’d like. I’m always amazed by how much I write while I’m traveling—how inspiring it is.\n\nQ: There is violence against women at least in the story I read of yours in Lisbon, a scene which set off flares throughout the class and a scene which was also very powerful. How do you respond to those who ask why? I studied with Hubert Selby who said the scene in Last Exit in Brooklyn with Tra La la was a love story. . . .do you feel the same way about violent scenes in your work?\n\nA: Not exactly the same, though I love that idea and sentiment. My take on it is that the best art is both about reality; the real world, and also about causing us to reconsider ourselves and the world around us. Artists can do this in all different ways, and one way is to write exciting, scary, controversial scenes that still mimic real life. The human experience can be violent and sad and also beautiful and uplifting. Life is not always what you want it to be, but it’ll always show you new things. Fiction should be the same way. I went to a reading by Junot Diaz, and he said something to the effect of — art should and can make us uncomfortable. He’s another favorite writer of mine.\n\nQ: You teach. Can you discuss the balance between teaching and writing and how one affects the other?\n\nA: I’ve been teaching college writing classes for 7 years now, altogether, and there are moments that I love it, and moments where I grow frustrated, like any job. I learn from my students on good days, and on bad days, I’ve got something funny to write about.\n\nQ: Can you tell us about your new book?\n\nA: Right now I’m calling it “The Story I Would Never Tell” but having just written that, I know that won’t be the title. What a strange title. It’s about a man who, during his boyhood in Lisbon, experiences something that he must keep secret. His future years in the US are colored by what happened, and just when he feels that he has the present under control, his world is rocked by the disappearance of his daughter. The search for her brings him face to face with his old regrets and silences, and he’s forced to make a choice between the past, the present, and the future…not to be too heavy about it, ha!\n\nQ: Can you share an excerpt of something you are writing right now?\n\nA: Sure. I’ve got some work in on this one:\n\nAll day I watch\n\nthe clock hands\n\nher fingers black\n\nresolute\n\njerking back the hours\n\nof this life.\n\nLater, your hands flutter like\n\npigeon wings after you\n\nfall asleep\n\nsifting under the covers\n\nthe muted light.\n\n…but I’m not sure where it’s going. I think it’s a poem.\n\nQ: Can you tell us about your work in Boston? What courses you teach? What research you are doing? Your scholarly interests?\n\nA: I teach various writing classes at Boston College and usually another college or university at the same time. Right now I’m much more rooted in the creative than the academic, though, so I’d say my ‘research’ is usually in the form of sitting down to write each day, and travel, if I can do it.\n\nQ: As a writer, what is your first priority?\n\nA: Write truly.\n\nQ: If there is one written passage you would like to be remembered by, what would it be?\n\nA: I don’t know about being remembered by it, but I [like a line in a poem of mine from the journal Babilonia] because of what it speaks to: the silences we keep between each other. I’m interested in those pockets of sound, of where our minds go when we’re not speaking, of the way energy is conducted between two people.\n\nso I leave my hand there\n\noutstretched\n\nwaiting for you to say something.\n\n_____________\n\n(*) Millicent Borges Accardi is a contributor to the Portuguese American Journal.

Illusory is the assertion… that the word Saudade — the melodious name that so softly issues from lusitanian lips — is unknown to the barbaric outsider (outsider and barbarian are synonyms), does not have its equivalence in any other tongue on this earthly globe or that is distinctive to this Atlantic sliver, absent even in that outer-Minho Galicia. (É inexacta a ideia que outras nações desconheçam esse sentimento. Ilusória é a afirmação… que mesmo o vocábulo Saudade — mavioso nome que tão meigo soa nos lusitanos lábios, — não seja sabido dos bárbaros estrangeiros (estrangeiro e bárbaro são sinónimos), não tenha equivalente em língua alguma do globo terráqueo e distinga unicamente a faixa atlântica, faltando mesmo na Galiza de além-Minho.)\n\nStill, pace these authorities, the notion that saudade is a distinctly Portuguese trait, even if precise definition remains elusive, persists. Consider these examples culled from the New York Times. “The quality of sensitiveness, so Portuguese that it can only be expressed by the word saudade” (“Portugal and Dom Manoel,” Aug. 2, 1932); “Coimbra, with its University and indefinable air of hopeless longing, which is the Portuguese saudade” (“Portugal: Warm Sunshine and Warm Hearts,” Oct. 26, 1937); “Saudade, the deep malaise of the spirit which expresses itself in the fados of Lisbon and Coimbra” (“Lisbon: A Capital on Many Hills,” Feb. 16, 1957); “Saudade, that sadness of being parted, that permeates the Portuguese character” (“Unknown Oporto and its Environs,” Nov. 2, 1957); “Saudade, that Portuguese feeling of melancholy and acceptance, still holds sway” (“Iberian Attitudes to the New Europe,” May 16, 1966).\n\nWhen we look back to earlier times for definitions of saudade in English-language texts, we find the eighteenth-century essayist, Joseph Addison adducing in the Spectator (No. 204) the authority of “Mr. Chalmers,” and writing: “The Portuguese word Saudades signifies the most refined, most tender and ardent desires for something absent, accompanied with a solicitude and anxious regard, which cannot be expressed by one word in any other language. … So, if a person is observed to be melancholy, and is asked ‘What ails him?’ if he answers, Tenho Saudades, it is understood to mean, ‘I am under the most refined torment for the absence of my love; or from being absent from my country’ &c.” In 1912, the Lusofile scholar Aubrey F. G. Bell offered a refinement of this definition: “The famous saudade of the Portuguese is a vague and constant desire for something that does not and probably cannot exist, for something other than the present, a turning towards the past or towards the future, not an active discontent or poignant sadness but an indolent dreaming wistfulness.”\n\nOthers, however, questioned the uniqueness of saudade (term and concept) to the Portuguese language and culture. In 1900, to a reader’s query, the Baltimore Sun replied: “Saudades is a Portuguese word derived from the Latin solitas (solitude, loneliness). Its meaning — melancholy arising from introspection and the vague yearnings of unsatisfied sentiment — is not unlike that of what the Germans call weltschmera (world-woe, pessimistic melancholy).” More acerbic is the observation made nearly a half century earlier in “Goethe and the Satanic Philosophy,” an article published in the United States Magazine in 1854: “The ‘Sorrows of Young Werther’ seem to us about as natural and admirable in prose as a string of Portuguese Saudades [in this case a sub-genre of Brazilian song] in verse, and if we knew of anything more unnatural and nauseating than these, we would put it in their place.”\n\nAn early reference to saudade in the United States occurs in the December 13, 1845 issue of the Broadway Journal, a publication edited at the time by Edgar Allan Poe. It appears in a note on the Portuguese writer-diplomat Almeida Garrett immediately following an unsigned review of Poe’s The Raven and Other Poems. Culled from Terence McMahon Hughes’s The Ocean Flower (1845), this paragraph introduces Garrett, “the most eminent living writer of Portugal, indeed the only one of any considerable eminence,” followed by a twenty-six line riff on saudade taken from his Camões, a poem published in 1828, illustrating the meaning and “beauties of a word, ‘Saudade,’ upon the exclusive possession of which the Portuguese particularly pride themselves.”\n\nOh tender yearning!

It has all the meaning of homesickness, but it also expresses a deep longing to see an absent friend, or some loved distant spot.\n\nCharles Frederick Hartt (1860)\n\nSaudade, the characteristic Brazilian longing or nostalgia, and plain homesickness appear obsessively in their poems.\n\nElizabeth Bishop and Emmanuel Brasil, An Anthology of Twentieth-Century Brazilian Poetry (1972).\n\nSaudade [is] the untranslatable title of David Rousseve’s dance-theater piece.\n\nCharles McNulty (2009)\n\nIt seeks to cure toy owners’ blues in a country that invented “saudade”—the barely translatable Portuguese term used to describe deep longing for something or someone that is lost.\n\nAndrei Khalip and Miguel Pereira, “Lisbon Doll Hospital Treats Owners’ Blues Too” (2009)\n\nAchaste, ao longe, em névoas a saudade pura…\n\nMarques da Cruz, “Língua Portuguesa”\n\nVítima talvez de um excesso de significação decorrente das alegadas intraduzibilidade do termo e ‘portugalidade’ do sentimento, a história cultural da saudade (literária, filosófica, psicológica, etc…) permanece por escrever, apesar das apostas editoriais em histórias temáticas e da existência de numerosas obras, antigas e recentes, sobre este traço supostamente constitutivo e distintivo da identidade anímico-cultural portuguesa.\n\nMiguel Alarcão, “Amor para além da Morte ou as ‘Cruzes de Leonor’” (2010)\n\n[Saudade] is that bugbear Portuguese word that once meant solitude, but which has come to mean a kind of indefinable longing — longing after the past, or even everything, or maybe nothing. People like to go on about how untranslatable it is. Maybe so, but it can be felt if one thinks of nostalgia, longing, yearning, and any number of other kindred feelings all at once. It is a synthetic concept that supposedly carried the Portuguese sailor across the sea or sat the shepherd down under a tree to contemplate and meditate.\n\nGregory Rabassa, “Fourth Person Plural” (1973)\n\nSaudades, that untranslatable sweet yearning that connoted a sense of both belonging and displacement, a tender lamentation, an almost joyful sorrow.\n\nFrank X. Gaspar, Stealing Fátima: A Novel (2009)\n\nFrom the Portuguese literary tradition, with which became enchanted as a young man, Mr. Tabucchi appears to have fully assimilated the concept of ‘saudade.’ The work embraces nostalgia, wistfulness and a yearning for what is lost, evanescent and perhaps unattainable. The idea of saudade has long been thought to suffuse Portugal’s national character.\n\nMargalit Fox, “Antonio Tabucchi, Elegiac Italian Writer, Dies at 68,” New York Times (2012)\n\nAt just about the same time that Sophia Hawthorne was explaining saudade to her son, Thomas Ewbank explained in his autobiographical account Life in Brazil (1856): “We have no word, nor half dozen words, equivalent to Saudade. It not only implies remembrances and good-will, but a doting upon and yearning after an object. It includes every thing that affection can desire for the absent, and hence is in common use in the correspondence of relatives and lovers.” Without dwelling on a definition of the term, Frances S. Dabney took over the term as the simple title of her privately printed little book of sketches and prose poems on Azorean themes, people and places in 1903—a book that has only recently, in 2005, been translated into Portuguese. Born in Fayal in 1856 into the Boston family of the Dabneys, who were prominent in business and consular matters for most of the nineteenth century on the island of Fayal, Frances Dabney offers as an epigraph to her book the following words — “D’esse tempo já passado, / D’esse tempo tão lembrado” — words for which she offers no English translation.\n\nA half a century or so later, the Southern African poet Roy Campbell, in “The Poetry of Luiz de Camões,” a piece in London Magazine in 1957, wrote: “The Portuguese are the only people to have a word which exactly hits off that sense of brooding exile, a sort of home-sickness which can even be felt at home, that otherwise indefinable fusion of yearning with satisfaction, pain with pleasure, and resignation with unattainability — which is the keynote of their poetry, and which the word saudades conveys so perfectly, as no other word in any other language.”\n\nFor a handful of English-language writers of Portuguese descent, the idea of saudade has held its remarkably varied fascinations. It is never far from Katherine Vaz’s fiction, in fact. In Saudade (1994), a first novel that evolved out of several of her previously published short stories, she provides, as an epigraph, a definition of this Portuguese word (“considered untranslatable”): “Yearning so intense for those who are missing, or for vanished times or place, that their absence is the most profound presence in one’s life. A state of being, rather than merely a sentiment.” Indeed, so essential are notions of saudade to her work overall that one senses that she too feels the sweet pain of reaching for something in the past that is not really hers, never was, and never will be — a legitimate longing for the past of a nation and a people that as often as not never took place in the terms in which it is invoked. Indeed her work, especially those stories that evoke her Azorean ancestry and adult Portuguese experiences, I would venture, is a touching instance of an author’s expression of her own saudades for saudade itself, a form of free-floating anxiety in search of a mooring available to her only in the writing of fiction. It is the force behind Vaz’s historical novel, Mariana (1997), in which she appropriates (or, a better term, aproveita) Mariana Alcoforado, the supposed author of the fictional Lettres portugaises at the end of the eighteenth century, giving the love-stricken nun an imagined daily life unvanquished by the absence of her departed French lover. One senses that for this author there is, perhaps, something of the rue (and poignancy) expressed with such sad finality in the lines from Mário de Sá-Carneiro, Fernando Pessoa’s great friend, that appear above as an epigraph to this piece, lines that provided António Ferro, another of Pessoa’s friends, with an epigraph and a title for his book of poems — Saudades de Mim (Saudades of Myself).\n\nLess personal cultural definitions of saudade appear in the work of other contemporary English-language writers of Portuguese descent. Erika D. Vasconcelos, Anthony De Sa, and Julian Silva, for example, have each had a try at defining saudade. In her first novel, My Darling Dead Ones (1997), Vasconcelos writes: “There is a type of song they still sing in the narrow streets of the Alfama, where you can touch your neighbour’s house by stretching your arm out of a window, and it is called fado. The Portuguese fado, Magdalena will tell you, originated from African slave songs that Portuguese sailors transformed to express their own longing, the loneliness of a life at sea. They call it, this longing, saudade, ‘a kind pain that you enjoy,’ she says, quoting a famous poet. ‘The Portuguese fado is saudade put to music,’ she says. But the name of the song has another meaning as well: it means fate.” In Barnacle Love (2008), Anthony De Sa, Vasconcelos’s fellow Canadian, evokes saudade right off, on the second page of the first story in his book: “The Portuguese call it saudade; a longing for something so indefinite as to be indefinable. Love affairs, miseries of life, the way things were, people already dead, those who left and the ocean that tossed them on the shores of a different land — all things born of the soul that can only be felt.” On the other hand, Julian Silva, a third-generation Portuguese-American whose principal literary roots are not Portuguese, but English — Henry James, prominently, and the Brontës — writes in The Death of Mae Ramos (2007): “Entranced by the golden shadows shimmering on the blood-red surface of his glass, he shivered again, so dizzy for an instant he feared he might faint. Saudade! It was the definitive Portuguese vice. A penchant for licking one’s wounds while longing — not without a certain degree of self-dramatization — for the impossible. Since only the impossible was ever worthy of one’s longing. What was must, by its very existence, prove inadequate.” This canny definition — and I say it with respect and admiration—evokes in me echoes of the great English Decadents, poets such as Lionel Johnson and Ernest Dowson, for example, who lived lives of saudade, though the term itself was probably unknown to them.\n\nThe word saudade has meant many things to the Portuguese people. It has even been the basis for a whole way of looking at the country and its people, a philosophy, if you will and do not insist on too precise a definition of either word — saudade or philosophy. Underlying its many meanings, however, is the prevailing impression that it is, more often than not, backward-looking. Even those projects and predictions for a better future seem to be shadowed by nostalgia for a time that is no more. It may be that “to remember is to live” (recordar é viver, as folk wisdom has it); but what is intriguing about the lives (all-too-too briefly) shown here is that those who lived them seem not to have been as dramatically burdened by saudades as, given the literature, one might have expected. As for saudades de saudade, those belong to the foreign-born, non-native descendants of Portuguese emigrants.\n\nEverybody — well, a lot of writers — take a crack at defining saudade. The Portuguese writer sees it as something of a duty, a responsibility, to trace its familiar contours is a privately public way. Non-Portuguese writers are more heuristic, wishing to convey its essence to those not in the know. Here is Roy Campbell, the English poet from South Africa, explaining his decision to entitle his translation of Joaquim Paço d’Arcos’s Poemas Imperfeitos as Nostalgia and its near-cousin saudade:\n\nThe original title of this book of lyrical memories, Poemas Imperfeitos, does not translated satisfactorily into English as “Uncompleted Poems.” “Nostalgia” comes nearer to expressing not the title but the mood of these poems since it is the nearest word we have to express “Saudades,” that blend of enjoyable melancholy with tender memory and regrets, which the Portuguese, whose home, for so many centuries, has been the wide world and the seven seas—feels for any part of that wide home in which he has sojourned. The Portuguese is at home anywhere on sea or land: he does not have to reconstruct his home-country abroad before he can feel at home in his colonies, or in foreign lands. The very ocean, as Fernando Pessoa, greatest of modern Portuguese poets, writes in Mensagem, is salt with the tears of Portuguese widows, mothers and sweethearts, who have lost their husbands, sons or lovers at sea or overseas. Far continents and the horizons of the oceans have a greater significance for the Portuguese than they have for any other European nation, for they not only mean grief, hardship, toil, and death, but livelihood, sustenance, wealth, power, and life itself. “Saudades,” however, are inherent, in varying forms, in the poetry and music of all Celtic and Celtiberian peoples, from the love-lilts of the Hebrides to the medieval barcarolas of the Portuguese and the modern fados which are so popular in Lisbon today. “Saudades” embody that wistful yet smiling melancholy with which Baudelaire sees Surgir du fond des eaux le Regret souriant.\n\nHere, on the other hand, is the English writer, John Berger’s try at defining saudade. In Here is Where We Meet (2005) he writes:\n\nLisboetas often talk of a feeling, a mood, which they call saudade, usually translated as nostalgia, which is incorrect. Nostalgia implies a comfort, even an indolence such as Lisboa has never enjoyed. Vienna is the capital of nostalgia. This city is still, and has always been, buffeted by too many winds to be nostalgic.\n\nSaudade, I decided as I drank a second coffee and watched a drunk’s hands carefully arranging the accurate story he was telling as if it were a pile of envelopes, saudade was the feeling of fury at having to hear the words too late pronounced too calmly. And Fado is its unforgettable music. Perhaps Lisboa is a special stopover for the dead, perhaps here the dead show themselves off more than in any other city. The Italian writer Antonio Tabucchi, who loves Lisboa deeply, spent a whole day with the dead here.\n\nInterestingly, Berger’s definition of saudade has nothing to do, I suspect, with any Lisboeta’s feel for the term, the concept or the emotion. The important thing is that Berger discovers in his own experience a personal objective correlative for Portuguese saudade — the persisting meaning of the term “too late” as he remembers it said by his now ten-years-dead mother.\n\nFor evidence that saudade works in ordinary, that is to say, non-literary lives, however, it is our good fortune to have Saudade (1990), an hour-long video documentary on the subject of Portuguese immigration to the United States. In this work we are made privy to a body of expressions, gestures, and signs indicative of saudade as it functions (or does not function) in the days and works of individualized human beings. Focusing on emigrants living in the New Bedford, Massachusetts, area, the Brazilian sociologist Bela Feldman-Bianco allows a small group of individuals to tell their particular stories. In the aggregate, the story told offers a valuable illustration of the way saudade has held them in a kind of consoling anxiety often leading to some creative act in their everyday lives or decision for the future.\n\nA twice-widowed Micaelense woman wants to die in her homeland and be buried with her family—parents, brother, husband—because it is her “place” or “corner.” Her notion is frugal, too, for she owns a burial plot. She visits her island annually, but, tellingly, she continues to live in America and to study English. A middle-aged clothing worker mata as saudades for his native Azores (that is, he satisfies his longing for his homeland by “killing” them) through concentrating on his garden this side of the Atlantic. Eight hours of piece-work at the shop are made tolerable by the eight hours he will spend each day working to make things grow, reproducing a little piece of his island in this less hospitable place.\n\nAn older woman recalls her youth as a striker walking picket lines, learning songs of solidarity and the ways of the labor union, and her discovery of the joys of amateur theater where, over the years, she has played dramatic roles, always dramatic roles. A fisherman, honored on Portuguese Communities Day (June 10, 1988) for his longevity, talks about his life as an emigrant. He worked in factories at first but soon went back to the sea, not because of a passion for fishing, but because the sea offered him a “freer” life. Asked if he misses the sea, he says quietly and immediately “no.” In fact, it is clear that he does not miss or have any saudades for the sea or for anything else. Fishing attracted him because there was always something to learn and something to survive, he adds later.\n\nA winemaker taps a barrel and tastes his wine. “I’m always first,” he says. “If I drink it then anybody can drink it.” Having left Madeira under false pretenses at the age of thirteen, he expresses no regrets at having done so, no sense of saudade, except, perhaps, when the camera catches him looking down as his son recites a poem about the pictures of his “family,” dispersed throughout several countries with children and relatives never seen. These pictures “sweeten” the walls of the house he has built with his own hands. But it is the wine that gladdens him; not entirely, one suspects, the drinking of it, but the recurring miracle of making it, and making it good.\n\nThere is a young woman graduate of the University of Coimbra who was denied her first job (by a Portuguese) because though an emigrant she had not “suffered” enough. The images that flash before the viewer without comment and that show the changes in her hair are indication enough of her acculturation. But, the most acculturated person in the group of seven is the son of emigrants who became the president of a national labor union. He tells of the family pressure on him and on other Portuguese boys to “marry their own kind.” Yet, neither he nor the friends who are gathered at his house on the day the film is being shot did that. They married “French,” “English,” what have you, and everything has worked out fine.\n\nThrough her choice of seven principals for her film, Feldman-Bianco is able to present not the seven ages of man, but the seven ages of immigration, and, if you will, the seven forms of acculturation. Viewers might disagree on how to describe these seven ages and seven forms, but this organization is one of the great strengths of this finely conceived and shrewdly composed film. What comes through is that these are seven “lived” lives. “Saudade” is a hook more narrowly and traditionally useful to the filmmaker (and the voice-over) than it is to the human beings whose collective sense of saudade reflects a wide range of emigrant strategies.\n\nIt is almost as if, then, that saudade has had as many meanings nearly as there have been individual beings familiar with the concept and convinced of its emotional force. Sooner or later, even those who are most skeptical seem to find in the idea of saudade either uneasiness or comfort — or, better still, simultaneously.\n\nAnd yet. And yet… If the word saudade means so many things that it takes, in English, for example, many different words, in their aggregate, to get at what saudade means to the Portuguese, might it not be a case, not of the richness of the word, but of the parsimony of Portuguese to list all those traits and emotions, etc. in a single word rather than using an umbrella term for what is, of course, felt and experienced by “others,” that is to say, other than Portuguese. Put it another way, does saudade have an integrity in itself, giving it an existence as a thing, making it different from all the feelings that, it is said, comprise it? Is saudade “the national mood,” as Peter Conrad says in a recent New Yorker essay on António Lobo Antunes, “a nostalgia for some remote, unremembered epoch during which the Portuguese were happy and their country ruled the waves”? Or is its meaning actually dictated by its immediate context, colored by it local circumstances? Or is it that what is unique about saudade, in the final analysis, is that Portuguese insistent that it is untranslatable, and as such an unmistakable and perfectly safe part of their national, if not racial, patrimony. After all, the term continues to be utterly serviceable. “Saudades (missing you),” is “a favorite Portuguese word,” one still commonly used as a complimentary close in personal letters, so explained Elizabeth Bishop, the American poet, an outsider then living in Portuguese-speaking Brazil. But maybe, after all is said and done, it is really a matter of translation (or mis-translation). After all, as Robert Frost once warned, “That’s the trouble with translations. You gotta know both languages — from — to — so’s the sense carries across.” In the particular instance of saudade, however, even knowing both languages may not be enough to carry the full sense across, especially if, as Ortega y Gasset observes, “La saudade no es um tema portugués, sino el tema portugués per excelencia.” Exactly — epitomized as saudade de saudade.\n\nImage by Sigrun Guggenberger\n\nRelated Posts\n\nBook: Jorge de Sena & João Gaspar Simões Correspondência 1943-1977 – Review\n\nBook: As Paixões de Pessoa – By George Monteiro – Review\n\nBook: Writers of the Portuguese Diaspora in the United States and Canada – Anthology\n\n———————————————–\n\nGeorge Monteiro, professor emeritus of English and of Portuguese and Brazilian Studies at Brown University, is the author or editor of books on Henry James, Henry Adams, Robert Frost, Stephen Crane, Emily Dickinson, Fernando Pessoa, and Luis de Camões, among others.

More…\n\nBy André Darlington, Contributor (*)\n\nWhen Candide and Pangloss arrive in Lisbon, the two just narrowly survive a shipwreck in the harbor. Then the city is promptly destroyed by an earthquake. During the mayhem Candide is injured, but instead of rushing to help him, Pangloss considers the finer points of their situation. Such is the vicious humor of Voltaire’s satire.\n\nIn 1755 the Earthquake of Lisbon, and the tsunami that followed, leveled the majority of the city and killed an estimated 60,000 people. The quake occurred during mass on All Saints Day, and church candles toppled by the vibrations set the city ablaze. To escape the inferno and collapsing buildings, many of Lisbon’s denizens fled down to the water and into boats, only to be engulfed by a twenty-foot ocean swell.\n\nThe event was a seminal moment in European history. At the time, the prevailing Enlightenment ideas were those of philosopher Gottfried Leibniz, whose attempts to reconcile reason with theology had famously led him to posit that “all is best in the best of all possible worlds.”\n\nBut in the face of the catastrophe in Lisbon, Voltaire was disillusioned. He wrote a poem entitled Poem on the Lisbon Disaster, or: An Examination of that Axiom ‘All is Well.’ In it, he wondered aloud how such a horror could be the act of a free and good God.\n\nVoltaire’s portrayal of miserable humanity in his poem rankled Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who responded with a nasty letter a few months later. Rousseau complained that Leibniz’s philosophy gave comfort, whereas the wealthy Voltaire couldn’t possibly sympathize with the common people’s need for hope in the face of life’s miseries.\n\nThe characters in Candide endure countless miseries—drowning, torture, rape, unrequited love, disease, eviction, slavery and the Inquisition. Voltaire’s narrative is a compounding series of misfortunes that multiply and branch out, with the recipients of abuse always bouncing back for more. Members of the book’s cast are killed off early on, and simply reappear with more stories of woe later. There is such a dizzying accumulation of misfortune that Italo Calvino suggests that it is Candide’s lightness, its velocity and vitality, that still captivates us today.\n\nThat Voltaire’s breezy, forever proliferating narrative passes through Lisbon is not accidental. Lisbon is, and has been for centuries, a city through which stories pulse. This westernmost capital in Europe, and jumping-off point for the exploration of the world, has been influenced and stimulated by the Phoenicians, the Visigoths, the Romans and the Moors. During the Age of Exploration, every ship departure was a message in a bottle, every return the importer of exotic tales.\n\nThe devastating 1755 earthquake spared Lisbon’s poor hilltop district of Alfama, a honeycomb of small squares and narrow streets near the river. Steep staircases carved between houses have created a system of secretive vertical passages. From the tight alleyways, Alfama’s lively little taverns emit their signature, melancholic music. Husky-voiced Fado singers, accompanied by a guitarist or two, bemoan harsh reality and lost love.\n\nBy full moonlight Lisbon’s labyrinthine cobbled ivory streets gleam like empty, tusk-tiled swimming pools. Ghostly figures appear along corridors and then quickly disappear as though they are characters from aborted film scenes. The intriguing, dream-like nooks and crannies create at once concentration and profusion.\n\nIt is into this world that the great Portuguese writer and flaneur, Fernando Pessoa, arrived from South Africa in 1905. Here he falls in love with the strangers he encounters on the streets, in love with the fragments of stories that occur around every bend and on every staircase. The fragment, a deplored feature of modernity for so many, becomes for Pessoa something he cultivates.\n\nThe author himself fragmented and multiple, he composes his writings under seventy-two different pen names. His passion for self-accretion and division was so great he even ghost-wrote a break-up letter to a lover. These multitudes inside Pessoa created a multiple work, The Book of Disquiet, which fittingly has no definitive edition. Assembled from pages found posthumously in a trunk, it opens out onto yet more pages, with at least four distinct translated versions in English alone.\n\nBaudelaire could have been talking about Pessoa when he calls such a man a ‘kaleidoscope equipped with consciousness.” One thinks of Edgar Allen Poe’s The Man of the Crowd, and in fact, Pessoa translated Poe– as well as O. Henry and Walt Whitman– into Portuguese.\n\nIn Poe’s short story, the narrator becomes obsessed with an old man he sees while sitting at a café, and proceeds to follow him through the streets of London, doggedly, overnight until the next day. It is a story of pursuing uniqueness within a teeming and anonymous modern city. But it is also the start of a Chinese box, or a Russian doll: the narrator of Poe’s story is, in effect, pursuing another story.\n\nIn The Thousand and One Nights, the Persian sultan Shahyrar is so disillusioned with the infidelity of women that he marries a virgin every day and then executes her in the morning. But when he marries Scheherazade, the Grand Vizier’s daughter, she begins to tell a story every night so suspenseful that the Sultan desires to hear its completion. Each night she begins a new story after telling the old one, such that every story always leads to yet more stories, with stories emerging from within one another, ad infinitum.\n\nThe collection that became The Thousand and One Nights was drawn together over centuries from multiple Asian and Middle Eastern sources. The book’s impact on European letters after it was first published in France in 1704 has been enormous. It was particularly pivotal for Marcel Proust, for instance, who mentions it as inspiration for the multiple intersecting stories found in his sprawling work, A Remembrance of Things Past.\n\nBut the book was also foundational for the Argentinian writer of accumulating and intertwining stories, Jorge Luis Borges. Borges is a master of multiplication, of stories in which unreality threatens reality through a sheer blizzard of narratives–so many interlocking that the reader experiences vertigo.\n\nWith a Portuguese great-grandfather on his paternal side, Borges played the part of a flaneur as a youth on the streets of the Italian-Portuguese neighborhoods in Buenos Aires. Characters often speak Portuguese in his stories, and he has been honored with a monolith by Federico Brook in the Arco do Cego garden in Lisbon.\n\nIn 1977 the blind author, who committed entire passages of the world’s literature to memory, discussed The Thousand and One Nights in a lecture he delivered at the Teatro Coliseo. In it, he recalls a note by the Orientalist Baron von Hammer-Purstall describing the confabulatores nocturne, men paid to tell stories during the night. He relates that as late as 1850, such storytellers were still common in Cairo. It was professional storytellers such as these that gathered the folktales and fables found in The Thousand and One Nights, and embellished them over the ages.\n\nCuriously, it was in the district of Alfama in Lisbon where Fado first appeared as a full-fledged art form sometime in the 1820 and 30s. Although its origins are a mystery, Fado is thought to have begun in this port area as a night dance among the laborers and sailors. It has Moorish roots, and Alfama was once the Moorish quarter. The name Alfama comes from the Arabic Al-hamma, meaning fountains, or baths.\n\nFado singers are Lisbon’s confabulatores nocturne, singing songs of fate, of longing, of what the Portuguese call saudade—the emotional result of irrecoverable loss.\n\nPessoa and Borges never met, although they were both in Lisbon at the same time twice during their lives. Once, in 1914 when Borges’s family was passing through on their way to Geneva. Borges was fourteen and Pessoa would have been twenty-six.\n\nIt is difficult to accept that they did not meet the second time, in 1923, when Borges spent forty-five days in Lisbon and both men were by then authors and Anglophiles with many similarities. There is even reason to believe that Borges drank coffee at Pessoa’s café, A Brasileira, which still exists.\n\nBut they did not meet, nor did they ever write.\n\nAfter Lisbon, Voltaire’s picaresque tale continues on to the New World, to Borges’ home of Buenos Aires, and then returns from across the Atlantic to England, to come to rest finally on the Ottoman coast. There, Candide receives the words of wisdom from an old Turk that free him from Leibniz’s optimism. He has the epiphany that rather than philosophize, ‘we must cultivate our garden.”\n\nWith that pronouncement, Voltaire’s little book marked the end of a world of transcendental good and evil, and the birth of a far more earthly and practical one. The disillusionment found in Candide signaled a profound shift in ethics and epistemology, making way for the storming of the Bastille thirty years later.\n\nAnd that is how, for we moderns, the story of the earthquake in Lisbon, the city of stories, is, like a tale told by Scheherazade, the beginning of our own.\n\n____________\n\n(*)André Darlington is a food, wine and travel writer based in Madison, WI.

Published by Dalkey Archive Press, the book focuses on Pessoa’s writings collected in The Book of Disquiet published posthumously.\n\nCousineau discovered Pessoa’s posthumous book after reading a review by the British novelist Paul Bailey. In his review Bailey had written, “This book has moved me more than anything I have read in years. I have rarely encountered such exhilarating lugubriousness.” After reading the Book of Disquiet, Cousineau himself was convinced that Pessoa’s work is “one of the towering masterpieces of 20th century fiction.”\n\nRichard Zenith, Pessoa’s editor and translator, has praised Cousineau’s work remarking:\n\nTom Cousineau’s An Unwritten Novel is a fine study of Pessoa’s Book of Disquiet — the first of its kind in any language, so far as I know. Cousineau does an excellent job of identifying and unraveling key strands in Pessoa’s work, which he then reweaves in various patterns to illuminate Fernando Pessoa, his semi-autobiographical persona Bernardo Soares, and their collaborative project(ion) of Disquiet. An Unwritten Novel, well-written and well-argued, is an important contribution to Pessoa studies that will be much appreciated by Pessoa scholars and by anyone who admires the work of Portugal’s great Modernist writer.\n\nThe following content is the Preface to An Unwritten Novel: Fernando Pessoa’s The Book of Disquiet provided by the author with permission by the publisher.\n\nAn Unwritten Novel offers the general reader, as well as students and teachers of modernism, an “Ariadne’s thread” that will help them to find their way through Fernando Pessoa’s labyrinthine masterpiece, The Book of Disquiet. The thread itself is woven from the double-stranded observation made by Bernardo Soares (its putative author) that “Anything and everything, depending on how one sees it, is a marvel or a hindrance, an all or a nothing, a path or a problem.”\n\nThe “marvel-hindrance” that pervades The Book from beginning to end (despite its having neither a beginning nor an end but, rather, an endlessly recurring middle) is the loss of a stable and reassuring vision of the world and of one’s place within it. Soares’s discovery that he is actually an “exile” where he had thought himself to be a “citizen” produces throughout The Book expressions of hopeless nostalgia as well as daydreams of a paradise regained. “Once upon a time” echoes repeatedly as its signature refrain, but the disquiet to which it gives expression remains as obdurate as ever.\n\nOne possible solution to this predicament is to attempt to fill the void left by the collapse of inherited beliefs with a substitute faith. This leads Soares’s contemporaries, who are incapable of worshipping the God of their ancestors, to erect a compensatory, yet bogus, “cult of humanity” and Soares himself to attempt, albeit with equally unconvincing results, to erect a cult of the “superior man,” which he readily joins. The other solution is to treat this misfortune as an opportunity to devise a new mode of writing that is not tainted with nostalgia. At first glance, Soares appears ill-suited to such an undertaking. A mere assistant bookkeeper in a commercial enterprise, he seems to lack the most rudimentary literary gifts. By his own admission, he can’t write poetry and, on the evidence of his “factless autobiography,” he can neither create believable characters nor write convincing dialogue and narration. As though that weren’t enough, his aesthetic ideal – which he can’t possibly duplicate – is found in such monumental achievements as Virgil’s Aeneid and Dante’s Divine Comedy.\n\nFortunately, however, the various “hindrances” by which Soares is beset go hand-in-hand with the “marvel” that is The Book itself. Like the “aged man” in William Butler Yeats’s “Sailing to Byzantium,” The Book is a “paltry thing” whose soul nonetheless manages to “clap its hands and sing, and louder sing/For every tatter in its mortal dress.” However, rather than finding consolation, as Yeats does, in the vision of himself as a “golden bird,” Soares, a self-described “building in ruins,” produces an incongruous masterpiece in which the diminishment that he experiences as a personal crisis coexists with an artistic achievement in the form of what he calls “greater completeness.”\n\nOrdinarily, a novelist achieves the effect of completeness by assembling the various parts of his novel so that they contribute to an organized whole. Details of place, for example, are gathered in a way that creates a setting; episodes are arranged in a logical sequence to form a plot; the protagonist is part of a larger human community; dialogue and narration each makes its distinct contribution to the novel as a whole; and the roles of the protagonist, who experiences events, and the author, who produces the work in which they are represented, are clearly distinguished as well. In The Book, however, all five of these narrative elements are “unwritten.” Lisbon is scarcely present as its setting and the three details that are mentioned—office, rented-room, and neighboring streets—are only minimally described. Plot dissolves into a series of events that do not cohere into a sustained action. Soares lives in nearly complete isolation from his fellow Lisboetas; both narration and dialogue virtually disappear, as does the distinction between the author and the protagonist.\n\nEach of these “mutilations” of a properly written novel, however, prepares the way for a compensatory form of “greater completeness.” On the level of setting, the office, the room, and the neighboring streets become gateways to the infinite. The episodic events that never cohere into a unified plot achieve the intensity of “modest apocalypses” which acquire an aura of timelessness. Soares, an undistinguished bookkeeper who records his company’s accounts in a ledger, metamorphoses into a writer through whom the works of his great predecessors—including Dante, Shakespeare, and Milton—are uncannily revived, albeit in the incongruous form of an “unwritten novel.” The eclipse of narration and dialogue leads to the emergence of a form of writing—what Soares calls “the written voice”—that hovers uncannily between speaking and silence. Finally, the blurring of the distinction between the author and his protagonist produces a hybrid, indeterminate form of authorship that has led some readers of The Book to attribute it to Pessoa/Soares.\n\nThe most intriguing aspect of the relationship between the mutilation which is, for Soares, a personal predicament and the dismemberment of inherited novelistic conventions that leads to greater completeness is that it cannot be interpreted as the expression of a conscious authorial intention. This is partly because we are not quite sure who actually wrote (or didn’t write) The Book, but also because neither Pessoa nor Soares actually wanted to produce a work that was merely a hodge-podge of fragmentary texts. Pessoa admired the architectural perfection of the great epic poems and achieved something resembling it, albeit on a much smaller scale, in his symbolist epic entitled Message. Curiously, it was when they renounced—or, more accurately, were deprived by a combination of their sheer inability to write a novel and the circumstance of Pessoa’s untimely death at age forty-seven—the brilliant mastery of one’s materials that they admired in Virgil and Dante and which Pessoa had displayed so impressively in Message, that Pessoa/Soares created—or, more accurately, had created for them—if not the most perfectly constructed of modernist masterpieces, then certainly one of the most sublime.\n\n______________\n\n(*) Thomas J.

He has done pre-doctorate studies at the Hoover Institution, CA/USA, and at Geschwister-Scholl Institut, Munich, FRG.\n\nIn this interview for the Portuguese American Journal, he reflects on contemporary Portugal, 40 years after the Carnation Revolution of 1974, on his thinking and his vision for the future.\n\nPortugal is celebrating 40 years of freedom and democracy. Looking back, was the 25th of April revolution worth it?\n\nAll indicators before and after April 25thpoint to this: the Portuguese state was perceived as being rich but we were poor and forced to migrate; the state was sovereign but we had no freedoms; we held a colonial empire but were not able to conquer the minds and hearts of those we colonized. Against this backdrop the revolution was well worth as it freed us to make new choices. What we have chosen, however, has been tested by capitalism. Capitalism is capable of creating the best life conditions when the wealth created better serves the collective welfare; or the worst when the created riches are abused by a minority, as explained by Thomas Piketty and illustrated by the Gini Coefficient about inequality. What we do in Portugal today is contingent to European and global answers. Yet, we should not accept bad policies forced on us due to the ignorance or greed of those in government.\n\nThe revolution had three objectives: decolonize, democratize and develop. From your perspective, were the ideals of the revolution achieved?\n\nThe ideals of the revolution were achieved. Yet, the world has changed greatly in the last 40 years and new challenges have emerged. Decolonization: despite the long civil wars in Angola and Mozambique, after 1974, these African nations have remained linked to Portugal by affection and economic interests. What we now call “Lusofonia” has been the appropriate answer to current challenges. Democratization: a “formal” democracy has been established and guaranteed. However, to achieve a “real” democracy we are in need of new political parties in order to counteract the oligarchic impositions that impoverished us. Development: the country was finally provided with progress tools. However, we need to support those who use these resources but have been penalized by austerity policies. I think that the civil society will produce new rulers with the ability to face our current problems. The revolution still goes on.\n\nIn 1974, Portugal was amongst the poorest countries in Western Europe in the grip of a deep crisis. Since then much has changed for the better. Yet, in 2014 Portugal remains one of the poorest countries of the Eurozone going through a deeper social and economic crisis. How would you explain the paradox?\n\nYes, we are facing a paradox inexplicable through social sciences. The explanation must be found in the contexts of history and cultural anthropology. As Jorge Dias has explained, in Os Elementos Fundamentais da Cultura Portuguesa, the Portuguese character is “a mix of a dreamer and a man of action,” or rather, “a dynamic dreamer who has a certain practical, realistic sense.” He once said, “When I stroll in Lisbon, I can see the sailors of the past; I don’t see the captains.” Without dreaming, the individual won’t thrive; without leadership, the country won’t survive. In 1974, the state was relatively rich, but the Portuguese were poor. Economic growth was one of the highest in Western Europe, with a GDP per capita of about 70 % against the European average. Following the establishment of democracy, by 2000 the GDP went up to 75-76 % against the European average. However, with the enactment of pro-cyclical economic policies, such as over construction, foreign loans and now the austerity measures, between 2001 and 2014 we have regressed to 70 %. Leadership in Portugal – or in Spain and France – has been of an unqualified parochialism. Here, leaders have been inept in sustaining the Portuguese dream. They act as administration staff, rather than being the statesmen of a country remarkably rich in values.\n\nYou have had a major role in the creation of the Instituto da Democracia Portuguesa (IDP), an alternative politics formation whose goal is to challenge the current political system in Portugal. What is the ideological precept behind the emergence of this movement?\n\nBorn in August 2007, the IDP acts as a ‘think-tank’ whose goal is to challenge the neo-liberal trend started in the 80s. Its main mission is to promote the common good and to encourage independent thinking. But change takes time. For now, the IDP offers public policy proposals and is active in supporting a political movement called Nós, Cidadãos! We reject a model of development that disregards the needs of the middle class and feeds on the complicity between the over spending state, captured by “neo-liberals” and always in debt to multinational banks, and the “neo-socialist” corporations selling consumer goods and supported by the state and the also by multinational banks. The middle class pays for most public amenities such as education, health and housing, and is left without self-sustaining means.\n\nOne of your proposals has been to bring back the monarchy. Wouldn’t it be an anachronism?\n\nDemocracy allows for the expression of public interest through political parties and elected governments. As it is the case throughout Europe, there are difficulties in balancing the uniqueness of each European country and overall European cohesion. Ronald Reagan once told D. Duarte de Bragança when receiving him at the White House “Why don’t you run for President?” I believe that a monarchy, or a “republic with a king,” would be our way to tell Europe, “Get organized as a confederation and we will contribute with our national identity.” We must balance our historical heritage with our vision of the future. Anyway, D. Duarte de Bragança has already won a place in history by preparing himself and the Royal Family for such a transition.\n\nDissatisfaction is growing in Portugal where salaries are amongst the lowest in the Eurozone. The unemployment rate is currently at 15.3%, but over 35% among the young professionals. They are leaving the country by the thousands looking for work abroad. What is your advice for them?\n\nI suggest that they remain connected to their roots. Those leaving Portugal (a country 2000 years ago once called Lusitania), will carry with them the language, traditions and tastes, together with its Mediterranean, Roman and Judeo-Christian legacy. Will this heritage all of a sudden become useless? Shouldn’t we rather stay connected and work together to keep it alive? This is a fundamental question for anyone who stays or leaves Portugal today. Being nihilistic would be to accept that our heritage is exhausted and that all revolves around individual survival. I am among those who like to think that by trying hard, and through digital networking, we can stay linked to the past and reinvent the future. I strongly believe in the benefits of diaspora – one can leave Portugal but still remain within it and, by being within, one can also be outside of it.\n\nWhat would your advice be for those who would rather stay in Portugal?\n\nMore than addressing those who “just stay,” I would rather speak to those who stay connected. We must rediscover ourselves as free citizens able to control our future. Take productivity, for instance. If a Portuguese worker in Portugal is able to produce 66 % of the European labor average and when in Luxembourg he produces 186 % of the European average – the difference lies not with him, but with governments and corporations. A renewed social pact was the idea expressed in September 15, 2012, during a demonstration of 1 million people in cities across the country. Rui Moreira, the current Mayor of Porto, referred to this movement as an ultimatum to the government. The problem facing the Portuguese people today is the lack of differences between the two right and left political forces – the socialists and the conservatives. Both run a “neo–liberal” state that favors big “neo-socialist “corporations who are disposing of our national, non-transferable assets while dependent on the government and multinational banking to survive.\n\nThroughout your career you’ve explored and written about a wide range of topics from political philosophy and ethics to history and religion. Most recently you and Nazaré Barros co-authored Olá, Consciência!, a book devoted to the philosophy of conscience as an individual and social value. Why this book now?\n\nThe book appeared as an alert for the need to make a paradigm shift from a society centered on “me” to a society focused on “we.” The shift begins with the awareness that “conscience” is not to be understood as the “I” of psychology or as an “epiphenomenon” resulting from neurological processes but rather as a relationship between the “me” and the “other.” As Viktor Frankl once said, “Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked, a formula echoed by President Kennedy’s dictum. We should start listening not to our projects but to the plans that life has for us through the encounter of the other. This clash of paradigms may be disconcerting. I believe the book first brings some discomfort to the reader, at least for those who are used to accept opinions and lifestyles without the “consciousness” of what they are doing or thinking. I should say that Olá Consciência, like Socrates and the gadfly disturbing everyone’s sleep aims to challenge many clichés and urban myths by forcing the reader to leave comfort zones where more often than not prejudices define everything.\n\nThe field of philosophy has had a reputation for being especially hostile toward women. You just co-authored a book with a female philosopher. Will you comment on your experience?\n\nPhilosophy was born as a form of dialogue through questions we ask and answers we get. We may dialogue with ourselves or with the other. In this case, the dialogue was between two people. To be more precise, the original idea of the book was only developed when Nazaré started dialoguing with me. This is how the process began and how, Olá, Consciência! justified its title which is, of course, a greeting symbolizing this encounter. The first 10 chapters are about discovering the intellectual and emotional tools that make the basis of our models of thought and the searching for “truth.” Chapters 11-21 expands the debate to human action in history, politics, religion, economics and art, seeking to reflect on what is valuable and “good.” Writing it was most pleasurable because, as many readers have pointed out, between the two of us we succeeded in achieving a perfect synthesis – like playing a piano with four hands.\n\nWhat is the role of the philosopher and of philosophy in todays’ world?\n\nPhilosophy will always try to be the synthesis of ideas that sustain what we do and what we think. These ideas are at work in art, science, law, politics, ethics and everything else that is alive. In the past, philosophers presented this synthesis as a whole to be taken or rejected as a whole. The concept has since changed. From a more conservative view, we are living within what was left of our eroded traditions which, as Alasdair McIntyre wrote, were turned into the “wasteland” that T.S. Elliot described. Here Plato and Aristotle, and even Descartes and Hegel, are seen as exotic references for mass culture. This moving away from our intellectual roots has been blamed for the so called “crisis of values.” Yet, without this “crossing of the desert,” our ideas won’t have achieved authenticity. Therefore, I believe that we are not facing a “lack of values” but rather facing an overabundance of values in the absence of ethics. Traditional ethics are no longer sufficient to confront the unknown future which, as Hans Jonas has warned us, is full of risks. The role of philosophy today is to rebuild the bridges between our intellectual roots and can only be achieved through the acknowledgement of the other.\n\nWhat do you think are the biggest philosophical issues of our time?\n\nIn the 20th century, philosophy and in particular the knowledge of the self, became no longer a concern for just a few scholars but, as Bernard Lonergan observed, has become a social issue. Therefore, we must start by saying “no” to self-centered thought. The question is: How do we connect to other? Philosophers such as Martin Buber, Franz Rosenzweig, Viktor Frankl, Emmanuel Levinas, Hans Jonas, Giusepe Zanghi, Charles Taylor and Gabriel Marcel, have demonstrated that dialogue is paramount to human existence. I think that ultimately our concerns can be summarized in just one sentence: “We want to be heard.” The world no longer wants to be explained – it wants to be heard. The people no longer want to be just represented – they want to share. At the very core of reality, a voice is claiming: “We want to be acknowledged.”\n\nIf you could choose one thing to change about the world, what would it be?\n\nIn many ways, the 20th century was the century of the “self” generating big dictator’s egos such as Hitler, Stalin and Mao Zedong who imposed their will on others by barbarian and violent means. It also generated individual selfishness common to both the producer and the consumer. I believe the 21st century will be the century of “we” where no collective act will ever replace the singular act of meeting the “other” and where we will rather acknowledge the meaning that results from our encounter with the singularity of “other.” By ignoring the other, we will open the way for acts of corruption and violence and for personal and social immorality. Dialogic thinkers are now responding to the barbarism of the 20th century by demonstrating how selfish reason has failed us. We will need to learn that to be ethical is to be able to face, not just the major social and historical deeds, but also the lesser everyday happenings which can embody inhuman and violent acts against the other, and that, because they are within historical and social frameworks, they can be considered “normal.” To be violent is to disregard the other and philosophy must reject it.\n\n___________\n\n(*) Carolina Matos, is the founder and editor of Portuguese American Journal online.

A twentieth-century American literature scholar, with an academic interest in Portuguese and Brazilian literature, Monteiro is the author of thirty-five books including poetry, scholarly studies, and English translations of Portuguese writers Fernando Pessoa, Jorge de Sena, Miguel Torga, Pedro da Silveira, and José Rodrigues Miguéis.\n\nActive in a variety of professional associations throughout his career, Monteiro served as an Executive Editor of The Explicator, is on the Advisory Board of Brasil/Brazil, and was the first Director of The Center for Portuguese and Brazilian Studies at Brown (1975-1980). He has been President of the Robert Frost Society and the Henry James Society.\n\nA Fulbright Visiting Professor of American Literature at the University of São Paulo, Brazil (1969-71), Monteiro has also been a Fulbright Lecturer in Brazil, Ecuador and Argentina. He holds an honorary L.H.D. from the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth and was awarded the Order of Prince Henry the Navigator, a distinction from the government of Portugal for achievement in scholarship in Portuguese letters and culture.\n\nHis books include The Presence of Camões (1996), The Presence of Pessoa (1998), Fernando Pessoa and Nineteenth-Century Anglo-American Literature (2000), and Paixões de Pessoa (2013).\n\nIn this interview for the Portuguese American Journal, George Monteiro addresses a series of questions on issues relating to his Portuguese heritage, his writing and academic career.\n\nWhere were you born? Did you grow up speaking Portuguese?\n\nI was born at home, at 38 School Street, in Valley Falls, the southernmost village in the town of Cumberland, Rhode Island, a son to Francisco José Monteiro and Maria Augusta Temudo. Both of them had emigrated from Portugal, he from Freixo-de-Espada-à-Cinta (Trás-os-Montes), she from Vila Ruiva da Serra (Beira Alta).\n\nI cannot remember when I did not speak both Portuguese and English. A couple of hundred feet or so down School Street–surprise–was the Valley Falls School, a four-room, four-grade primary school one always referred to–I don’t know why—as the “Chicken Coop.” Pretty much all its students were either children of emigrants or came from families having a particularly hard time surviving during the Great Depression.\n\nThe better-off families pretty much lived elsewhere in the town. In the latter half of the nineteenth century Valley Falls prospered as a healthy center of the textile industry and was an important railway stop on the way to Providence and on to Newport.\n\nMy birth coincided with the blowing up of the buildings of what had been a most prosperous mill complex in its day.\n\nCould you share a remarkable childhood memory about growing up Portuguese in America?\n\nShortly after my birth, my mother was turned into the authorities as an illegal alien–which was true. It was decided that my mother would leave the United States until it could be arranged for legal entry.\n\nThat’s how, a sort of before-the-fact anchor baby, a few months old, was sent into exile in Portugal, where I turned one before my mother was allowed to enter the U.S. legally.\n\nDid you experience discrimination against immigrants in school?\n\nThe teachers were what the Portuguese referred to as “da nação,” that is, “not-Portuguese.” In fact, there wouldn’t be a teacher with Portuguese forbears in the entire town until the late 1940’s or early 1950′s. I do not recall that I encountered any racial or ethnic discomfort during my four years at the “Chicken Coup.”\n\nMy guess is that the Depression and the early war years had something to do with that. However, after the fourth grade, when we went on to the Clark Street School, something odd happened–although no one seemed to notice it at the time. All the kids with Portuguese names ended up in the same fifth grade (although there were two fifth grades in the building), along with a few “big boys” who were just marking time until, at age sixteen, they could leave school and schooling in the dust (decades later I learned that the decisions as to who would be placed where were made by the secretary in the office of the Superintendent of Schools).\n\nThe kicker in all this is not that placement was basically discriminatory–it was, of course–but that we all–Portuguese kids and “big boys”–were sentenced to a year of schooling at the hands of a wildly erratic and more often than not an incompetent teacher who, a couple of years later, was “retired” from teaching from teaching. I shall not go into details now, but I can say that the school year my compatriots and I spent in Miss Lightbrown’s fifth-grade class deserve a full-blown treatment that I cannot go into now.\n\nWhat education did you receive later?\n\nSkipping right along, I attended the public schools in Cumberland, right on up through high school, and then, improbably and due to a bevy of fortuitous events (including the life-changing counsel of Andy Tucker, a science teacher better known as a baseball coach), I attended Brown University, located just a few miles down the road.\n\nSubsequently, I earned a master’s degree at Columbia University in New York, and some years later a doctorate from Brown. At no time, in all those years, was it my experience that the Portuguese language, and don’t even think of Portuguese Studies, was of any worth in my academic circles.\n\nIn school, did you study Portuguese?\n\nSince proficiency in Portuguese was not acceptable to fulfill the foreign languages requirement for my bachelor’s degree at Brown, I suggested to my freshman advisor that I would like to try Spanish.\n\n“Why would you do that?” he asked with disdain. “What do you want to be, a coffee salesman for the A&P in Brazil?” Well, that question and the class prophecy in my high school yearbook that I would someday be the U.S. Ambassador to Brazil, were predictive (sort of), for after ten years of teaching and shortly after being promoted to associate professor of English with tenure, through a set of odd events I found myself in Brazil as Fulbright teacher of American literature assigned to the University of São Paulo.\n\nMind you, I was an English Ph.D. with no interest in Brazil or, for that matter, Portugal.\n\nMy teaching and my scholarship was in English and American literature.
