The symposium featured talks by a number of Pessoa scholars, headed by João Gaspar Simões and Jorge de Sena. Included in this piece are the texts of the seven Jorge de Sena letters addressed to George Monteiro, leading up to the symposium and its immediate aftermath. These letters are published for the first time. RESUMO Um relato das circunstâncias em torno do primeiro Simpósio Internacional sobre Fernando Pessoa, que teve lugar na Brown University de 7 a 8 de Outubro de 1977 e cujas Actas foram publicadas na Gávea-Brown Publications em 1982. O Simpósio reuniu um número de eminentes estudiosos de Pessoa, com destaque para João Gaspar Simões e Jorge de Sena. Neste documento incluem-se os textos das sete cartas enviadas por Jorge de Sena a George Monteiro, imediatamente antes e após o Simpósio. Estas cartas, inéditas, têm agora a sua primeira publicação.\n\nFernando Pessoa as English Reader and Writer Edited by Patricio Ferrari and Jerónimo Pizarro A collection of scholarly essays dedicated to Fernando Pessoa as English reader and writer including unpublished material from the author’s archive and private library With Pessoa’s digitized private library online, the importance of English to Pessoa has become indisputable, particularly in his formative years: numerous English authors served as the bedrock from which his poetic sensibility emerged, developed and soared. In fact, a significant amount of Pessoa’s writings in English and in Portuguese (including those attributed to his heteronyms and/or to other literary personae) were greatly informed by these (his) original sources. Fernando Pessoa as English Reader and Writer provides ample evidence of his fruitful, lifelong relationship with the English language. In addition to its thematic focus, this latest volume of Portuguese Literary & Cultural Studies features sections dedicated to unpublished materials, new transcriptions of texts Pessoa originally wrote in English and verse translations by Pessoa into Portuguese. Contributors to this volume include George Monteiro, Patricia Silva McNeill, Richard Zenith, and Stefan Helgesson.\n\nThere has been substantial work done interpreting the descriptive texts from the early-modern encounters of Portuguese colonizers in Brazil. The interpretations have had major difficulty with significant elements of the texts, which the interpreters found strange from the perspective of their particular contexts. For the most part, they dismiss these elements. It is suggested here that these elements are evidence of a specific style of thinking for coming to terms with nature in the New World. The point is not that the corpus in question can be reduced to this style of thinking. There might be other styles to be identified in the corpus. But this style of thinking gives shape to the corpus to a considerable measure. Moreover, it enables one to make sense of the most strange and puzzling passages of the corpus, such as the following one, describing a \" water tree \" supposedly found at the time in Bahia: \" in its branches it has holes of the length of an arm, which are full of water… the origin of which is unknown… and it happens that 100 souls come to it, and they are all protected, [being able to] drink and wash everything they want, and there is never water shortage \" (Cardim, 1925: 67)...\n\nHow science has defined a \" region \" over time, is the main question brought forth by this article. As part of a scientific effort, orchestrated by a central, despotic Imperial Government, co opting colonial subjects into becoming scientists at the service of the Crown, who described, named and defined the various parts of the empire. Thus, the Caatinga of Northeastern Brazil has been the subject of several descriptions during the 18th Century, written by naturalists in the service of the Portuguese Crown. These men sent, over the last decades of the 18th through early 19th Century, a large number of samples of minerals, fauna and flora to be studied and described in Lisbon and other European capitals, creating the necessary environment for a scientific boom which never really took place but for the few printed and manuscript reports which were the sources for this article. RESUMO Como a ciência definiu uma \" região \" ao longo do tempo é a principal questão levantada por este artigo. Como parte de um esforço científico, orquestrado por um governo imperial central e despótico, cooptando súditos coloniais em se tornarem cientistas ao serviço da coroa, que descreveram, nomearam e definiram as várias partes do império. Assim, a Caatinga do nordeste brasileiro foi objeto de diversas descrições durante o século XVIII, escritas por naturalistas a serviço da coroa portuguesa. Estes homens, durante as últimas décadas do século XVIII e as primeiras do XIX, enviaram amostras minerais, vegetais e animais para serem estudadas e descritas em Lisboa e outras capitais europeias, criando o ambiente necessário para uma expansão científica que nunca realmente aconteceu, exceto por alguns relatos impressos e manustritos, que foram as fontes desta investigação. The many ways in which any specific \" region \" is described, analyzed, and studied has been both a question and a focus of the historiography Science and Scientific thought, and the studies of identities of the early 21st Century. This work aims to see how a \" region \"-both geographically and culturally defined-came into existence in the 18th Century Portuguese Scientific thought, seem in the works of naturalists at the service of the Portuguese Crown."
