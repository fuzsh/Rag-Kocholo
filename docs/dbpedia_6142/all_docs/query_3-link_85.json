        "text": "Follicular localization of growth differentiation factor 8 and its receptors in normal and polycystic ovary syndrome ovaries.\n\nPubMed\n\nLin, Ting-Ting; Chang, Hsun-Ming; Hu, Xiao-Ling; Leung, Peter C K; Zhu, Yi-Min\n\n2018-05-01\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age and its etiology has not been characterized. Growth differentiation factor 8 (GDF8) is a member of the transforming growth factor-Î² superfamily that plays a critical role in the regulation of ovarian functions. However, the expression pattern of GDF8 in the human ovary is not yet clear. This study examined the cellular distribution of GDF8 and its putative cellular receptors (ACVR2A, ACVR2B, and ALK5) in a series of normal (nÂ =Â 34) and PCOS ovaries (nÂ =Â 14). The immunostaining of GDF8, ACVR2A, ACVR2B, and ALK5 was detected in the oocytes regardless of the developmental stage. All these proteins were localized in antral follicles in normal and PCOS ovaries, and the expression of these proteins increased with increasing follicle diameter. A significantly higher expression of GDF8 was detected in the granulosa cells than in the matched theca cells (TCs). These proteins were also localized in the luteal cells of the corpus luteum. Granulosa cells and TCs of large antral follicles in PCOS ovaries display a higher expression of these proteins. The higher expression levels of GDF8 and its functional receptors (ACVR2A, ACVR2B, and ALK5) in antral follicles of PCOS ovaries than those in normal ovaries suggest the possible involvement of dysregulated GDF8 in the pathogenesis of PCOS.\n\nGrowth/differentiation factor-11: an evolutionary conserved growth factor in vertebrates.\n\nPubMed\n\nFunkenstein, Bruria; Olekh, Elena\n\n2010-11-01\n\nGrowth and differentiation factor-11 (GDF-11) is a member of the transforming growth factor-Î² superfamily and is thought to be derived together with myostatin (known also as GDF-8) from an ancestral gene. In the present study, we report the isolation and characterization of GDF-11 homolog from a marine teleost, the gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata, and show that this growth factor is highly conserved throughout vertebrates. Using bioinformatics, we identified GDF-11 in Tetraodon, Takifugu, medaka, and stickleback and found that they are highly conserved at the amino acid sequence as well as gene organization. Moreover, we found conservation of syntenic relationships among vertebrates in the GDF-11 locus. Transcripts for GDF-11 can be found in eggs and early embryos, albeit at low levels, while in post-hatching larvae expression levels are high and decreases as development progresses, suggesting that GDF-11 might have a role during early development of fish as found in tetrapods and zebrafish. Finally, GDF-11 is expressed in various tissues in the adult fish including muscle, brain, and eye.\n\nGrowth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) suppresses in vitro angiogenesis through a novel interaction with connective tissue growth factor (CCN2).\n\nPubMed\n\nWhitson, Ramon J; Lucia, Marshall Scott; Lambert, James R\n\n2013-06-01\n\nGrowth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) and the CCN family member, connective tissue growth factor (CCN2), are associated with cardiac disease, inflammation, and cancer. The precise role and signaling mechanism for these factors in normal and diseased tissues remains elusive. Here we demonstrate an interaction between GDF-15 and CCN2 using yeast two-hybrid assays and have mapped the domain of interaction to the von Willebrand factor type C domain of CCN2. Biochemical pull down assays using secreted GDF-15 and His-tagged CCN2 produced in PC-3 prostate cancer cells confirmed a direct interaction between these proteins. To investigate the functional consequences of this interaction, in vitro angiogenesis assays were performed. We demonstrate that GDF-15 blocks CCN2-mediated tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVEC) cells. To examine the molecular mechanism whereby GDF-15 inhibits CCN2-mediated angiogenesis, activation of Î±V Î²3 integrins and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was examined. CCN2-mediated FAK activation was inhibited by GDF-15 and was accompanied by a decrease in Î±V Î²3 integrin clustering in HUVEC cells. These results demonstrate, for the first time, a novel signaling pathway for GDF-15 through interaction with the matricellular signaling molecule CCN2. Furthermore, antagonism of CCN2 mediated angiogenesis by GDF-15 may provide insight into the functional role of GDF-15 in disease states.

The regulation of members of the TGF-Î² family is known to be complex, because many proteins able to bind the ligands and inhibit their activities have been identified. Growth and differentiation factor 11 (Gdf11) as activins belong to the TGF-Î² family. GDF11, like other members of the TGF-Î² superfamily, is produced from precursor proteins by proteolytic processing. The binding of activins to activin type IIA (ActRIIA) or type IIB (ActRIIB) receptors induces the recruitment and phosphorylation of an activin type I receptor which then phosphorylates the Smad2 and Smad3 intracellular signaling proteins. GDF11 signal through the ActRIIB pathway. Recent studies have reported that GDF11-ActRIIB-Smad2/3-dependent signaling is a key regulatory mechanism in proliferating erythroid precursors as it controls their late-stage maturation. The administration of GDF11 is effective in experimental cardiac hypertrophy, and the identification of GDF11 as a \"rejuvenating factor\" opens up perspectives for the treatment of age-related cardiac dysfunction. Recent studies of the heart indicate that exposure to young blood reverses age-related impairments. GDF11 could be one of the circulating molecules that influence the aging of different tissues.

Growth differentiation factor-15, a transforming growth factor-beta-related cytokine which is up-regulated in cardiomyocytes via multiple stress pathways, predicts mortality in patients with heart failure treated pharmacologically. Growth differentiation factor-15 was measured before and 360 days (median) after implantation in 158 patients with heart failure [age 68 +/- 11 years (mean +/- SD), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 23.1 +/- 9.8%, New York Class Association (NYHA) class III (n = 117) or IV (n = 41), and QRS 153.9 +/- 28.2 ms] undergoing CRT and followed up for a maximum of 5.4 years for events. In a stepwise Cox proportional hazards model with bootstrapping, adopting log GDF-15, log NT pro-BNP, LVEF, and NYHA class as independent variables, only log GDF-15 [hazard ratio (HR), 3.76; P = 0.0049] and log NT pro-BNP (HR, 2.12; P = 0.0171) remained in the final model. In the latter, the bias-corrected slope was 0.85, the optimism (O) was -0.06, and the c-statistic was 0.74, indicating excellent internal validity. In univariate analyses, log GDF-15 [HR, 5.31; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.31-11.9; likelihood ratio (LR) chi(2) = 14.6; P < 0.0001], NT pro-BNP (HR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.55-5.26; LR chi(2) = 10.4; P = 0.0004), and the combination of both biomarkers (HR, 7.03; 95% CI, 2.91-17.5; LR chi(2) = 19.1; P < 0.0001) emerged as significant predictors. The biomarker combination was associated with the highest LR chi(2) for all endpoints. Pre-implant GDF-15 is a strong predictor of mortality and morbidity after CRT, independent of NT pro-BNP. The predictive value of these analytes is enhanced by combined measurement.\n\nGDF15 is a heart-derived hormone that regulates body growth.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Ting; Liu, Jian; McDonald, Caitlin; Lupino, Katherine; Zhai, Xiandun; Wilkins, Benjamin J; Hakonarson, Hakon; Pei, Liming\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe endocrine system is crucial for maintaining whole-body homeostasis. Little is known regarding endocrine hormones secreted by the heart other than atrial/brain natriuretic peptides discovered over 30Â years ago. Here, we identify growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) as a heart-derived hormone that regulates body growth. We show that pediatric heart disease induces GDF15 synthesis and secretion by cardiomyocytes. Circulating GDF15 in turn acts on the liver to inhibit growth hormone (GH) signaling and body growth. We demonstrate that blocking cardiomyocyte production of GDF15 normalizes circulating GDF15 level and restores liver GH signaling, establishing GDF15 as a bona fide heart-derived hormone that regulates pediatric body growth. Importantly, plasma GDF15 is further increased in children with concomitant heart disease and failure to thrive (FTT). Together these studies reveal a new endocrine mechanism by which the heart coordinates cardiac function and body growth. Our results also provide a potential mechanism for the well-established clinical observation that children with heart diseases often develop FTT. Â© 2017 The Authors.

Yet, despite commonalities in protein sequence, receptor utilization and signaling, accumulating evidence suggests that these 2 ligands can have distinct functions in many situations. GDF11 is essential for mammalian development and has been suggested to regulate aging of multiple tissues, whereas myostatin is a well-described negative regulator of postnatal skeletal and cardiac muscle mass and modulates metabolic processes. In this review, we discuss the biochemical regulation of GDF11 and myostatin and their functions in the heart, skeletal muscle, and brain. We also highlight recent clinical findings with respect to a potential role for GDF11 and/or myostatin in humans with heart disease. Finally, we address key outstanding questions related to GDF11 and myostatin dynamics and signaling during development, growth, and aging.

Culture with recombinant human growth factors may improve the biochemical and biomechanical properties of engineered tissue. The objectives of this study were to (1) perform a high-throughput screen to assess multiple combinations of growth factors and (2) perform more detailed testing of candidates identified in part I. In part I, human nasal septal chondrocytes from three donors were expanded in monolayer with pooled human serum (HS). Cells were then embedded in alginate beads for 2 weeks of culture in medium supplemented with 2% or 10% HS and 1 of 90 different growth factor combinations. Combinations of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1), bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, BMP-7, BMP-13, growth differentiation factor-5 (GDF-5), transforming growth factor Î² (TGFÎ²)-2, insulin, and dexamethasone were evaluated. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) accumulation was measured. A combination of IGF-1 and GDF-5 was selected for further testing based on the results of part I. Chondrocytes from four donors underwent expansion followed by three-dimensional alginate culture for 2 weeks in medium supplemented with 2% or 10% HS with or without IGF-1 and GDF-5. Chondrocytes and their associated matrix were then recovered and cultured for 4 weeks in 12 mm transwells in medium supplemented with 2% or 10% HS with or without IGF-1 and GDF-5 (the same medium used for alginate culture). Biochemical and biomechanical properties of the neocartilage were measured. In part I, GAG accumulation was highest for growth factor combinations including both IGF-1 and GDF-5. In part II, the addition of IGF-1 and GDF-5 to 2% HS resulted in a 12-fold increase in construct thickness compared with 2% HS alone (p < 0.0001). GAG and type II collagen accumulation was significantly higher with IGF-1 and GDF-5.

A recent study showed that reduced GDF11 blood levels with aging was associated with pathological cardiac hypertrophy (PCH), and restoring GDF11 to normal levels in old mice rescued PCH. Objective To determine if and by what mechanism GDF11 rescues aging dependent PCH. Methods and Results 24-month-old C57BL/6 mice were given a daily injection of either recombinant (r) GDF11 at 0.1mg/kg or vehicle for 28 days. rGDF11 bioactivity was confirmed in-vitro. After treatment, rGDF11 levels were significantly increased but there was no significant effect on either heart weight (HW) or body weight (BW). HW/BW ratios of old mice were not different from 8 or 12 week-old animals, and the PCH marker ANP was not different in young versus old mice. Ejection fraction, internal ventricular dimension, and septal wall thickness were not significantly different between rGDF11 and vehicle treated animals at baseline and remained unchanged at 1, 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. There was no difference in myocyte cross-sectional area rGDF11 versus vehicle-treated old animals. In vitro studies using phenylephrine-treated neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM), to explore the putative anti-hypertrophic effects of GDF11, showed that GDF11 did not reduce NRVM hypertrophy, but instead induced hypertrophy. Conclusions Our studies show that there is no age-related PCH in disease free 24-month-old C57BL/6 mice and that restoring GDF11 in old mice has no effect on cardiac structure or function.

Progress in understanding the effects of GDF5 on dopaminergic neurones has been hindered by the use of mixed cell populations derived from primary cultures or in vivo experiments, making it difficult to differentiate between direct and indirect effects of GDF5 treatment on neurones. In an attempt to establish an useful model to study the direct neuronal influence of GDF5, we have characterised the effects of GDF5 on a human neuronal cell line, SH-SY5Y. Our results show that GDF5 has the capability to promote neuronal but not dopaminergic differentiation. We also show that it promotes neuronal survival in vitro following a 6-hydroxydopamine insult. Our results show that application of GDF5 to SH-SY5Y cultures induces the SMAD pathway which could potentially be implicated in the intracellular transmission of GDF5's neurotrophic effects. Overall, our study shows that the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line provides an excellent neuronal model to study the neurotrophic effects of GDF5.\n\nRole of growth differentiation factor 11 in development, physiology and disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhang, Yonghui; Wei, Yong; Liu, Dan; Liu, Feng; Li, Xiaoshan; Pan, Lianhong; Pang, Yi; Chen, Dilong\n\n2017-01-01\n\nGrowth differentiation factor (GDF11) is a member of TGF-Î²/BMP superfamily that activates Smad and non-Smad signaling pathways and regulates expression of its target nuclear genes. Since its discovery in 1999, studies have shown the involvement of GDF11 in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development and erythropoiesis, as well as in the pathophysiology of aging, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cancer. In addition, there are contradictory reports regarding the role of GDF11 in aging, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, osteogenesis, skeletal muscle development, and neurogenesis. In this review, we describe the GDF11 signaling pathway and its potential role in development, physiology and disease. PMID:29113418\n\nRegion-specific role of growth differentiation factor-5 in the establishment of sympathetic innervation.\n\nPubMed\n\nO'Keeffe, Gerard W; Gutierrez, Humberto; Howard, Laura; Laurie, Christopher W; Osorio, Catarina; GavaldÃ , NÃºria; Wyatt, Sean L; Davies, Alun M\n\n2016-02-15\n\nNerve growth factor (NGF) is the prototypical target-derived neurotrophic factor required for sympathetic neuron survival and for the growth and ramification of sympathetic axons within most but not all sympathetic targets. This implies the operation of additional target-derived factors for regulating terminal sympathetic axon growth and branching. Here report that growth differentiation factor 5 (GDF5), a widely expressed member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFÎ²) superfamily required for limb development, promoted axon growth from mouse superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons independently of NGF and enhanced axon growth in combination with NGF. GDF5 had no effect on neuronal survival and influenced axon growth during a narrow window of postnatal development when sympathetic axons are ramifying extensively in their targets in vivo. SCG neurons expressed all receptors capable of participating in GDF5 signaling at this stage of development. Using compartment cultures, we demonstrated that GDF5 exerted its growth promoting effect by acting directly on axons and by initiating retrograde canonical Smad signalling to the nucleus. GDF5 is synthesized in sympathetic targets, and examination of several anatomically circumscribed tissues in Gdf5 null mice revealed regional deficits in sympathetic innervation. There was a marked, highly significant reduction in the sympathetic innervation density of the iris, a smaller though significant reduction in the trachea, but no reduction in the submandibular salivary gland. There was no reduction in the number of neurons in the SCG. These findings show that GDF5 is a novel target-derived factor that promotes sympathetic axon growth and branching and makes a distinctive regional contribution to the establishment of sympathetic innervation, but unlike NGF, plays no role in regulating sympathetic neuron survival.\n\nA Prodomain Fragment from the Proteolytic Activation of Growth Differentiation Factor 11 Remains Associated with the Mature Growth Factor and Keeps It Soluble.\n\nPubMed\n\nPepinsky, Blake; Gong, Bang-Jian; Gao, Yan; Lehmann, Andreas; Ferrant, Janine; Amatucci, Joseph; Sun, Yaping; Bush, Martin; Walz, Thomas; Pederson, Nels; Cameron, Thomas; Wen, Dingyi\n\n2017-08-22\n\nGrowth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11), a member of the transforming growth factor Î² (TGF-Î²) family, plays diverse roles in mammalian development. It is synthesized as a large, inactive precursor protein containing a prodomain, pro-GDF11, and exists as a homodimer. Activation requires two proteolytic processing steps that release the prodomains and transform latent pro-GDF11 into active mature GDF11. In studying proteolytic activation in vitro, we discovered that a 6-kDa prodomain peptide containing residues 60-114, PDP 60-114 , remained associated with the mature growth factor. Whereas the full-length prodomain of GDF11 is a functional antagonist, PDP 60-114 had no impact on activity. The specific activity of the GDF11/PDP 60-114 complex (EC 50 = 1 nM) in a SMAD2/3 reporter assay was identical to that of mature GDF11 alone. PDP 60-114 improved the solubility of mature GDF11 at neutral pH. As the growth factor normally aggregates/precipitates at neutral pH, PDP 60-114 can be used as a solubility-enhancing formulation. Expression of two engineered constructs with PDP 60-114 genetically fused to the mature domain of GDF11 through a 2x or 3x G4S linker produced soluble monomeric products that could be dimerized through redox reactions. The construct with a 3x G4S linker retained 10% activity (EC 50 = 10 nM), whereas the construct connected with a 2x G4S linker could only be activated (EC 50 = 2 nM) by protease treatment. Complex formation with PDP 60-114 represents a new strategy for stabilizing GDF11 in an active state that may translate to other members of the TGF-Î² family that form latent pro/mature domain complexes.\n\nAsiaticoside hinders the invasive growth of keloid fibroblasts through inhibition of the GDF-9/MAPK/Smad pathway.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Xin; Bian, Difei; Dou, Yannong; Gong, Zhunan; Tan, Qian; Xia, Yufeng; Dai, Yue\n\n2017-08-01\n\nHigher expression of growth differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9) in keloids compared with hypertrophic scars and normal skin tissues has been reported recently. The present study was performed to investigate the role of GDF-9 in keloid pathogenesis, and to elucidate its implication for asiaticoside in the keloid management. The data showed that GDF-9 could enhance the proliferation, migration, and invasion of keloid fibroblasts (KFs), while it only slightly elevated collagen expression, indicating that the effect of GDF-9 was opposite to that of TGF-Î²1. The bioactivity difference between GDF-9 and TGF-Î²1 could be explained by the different phosphorylated sites on the downstream Smad2/3. Moreover, asiaticoside could inhibit GDF-9-induced activation of MAPKs and Smad pathway in KFs. In conclusion, GDF-9 enhanced the invasive growth of KFs, which was achieved by phosphorylation of Smad 2/3 at the linker region through activation of MAPKs pathway. Asiaticoside hindered the invasive growth of KFs by inhibiting the GDF-9/MAPK/Smad pathway.

As an oocyte-specific growth factor, GDF9 plays critical roles in controlling folliculogenesis in mammals. In the present study, we cloned a 2.1-kb cDNA of the zebrafish GDF9 homolog (Gdf9, gdf9), which shares approximately 60% homology with that of mammals in the mature region. RT-PCR analysis showed that zebrafish gdf9 expression was present only in the gonads and Northern blot analysis revealed a single transcript of about 2.0 kb in the ovary. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that gdf9 expression was highest in primary growth (PG, stage I) follicles and gradually decreased during follicular development, with the lowest level being found in fully grown (FG) follicles. The expression of gdf9 was maintained through fertilization and early embryonic development until gastrulation, at which point the expression level dramatically decreased. Expression was barely detectable after the late gastrula stage. Within the follicle, gdf9 mRNA was localized exclusively in the oocytes, as demonstrated by RT-PCR of denuded oocytes and freshly isolated follicle layers as well as by in situ hybridization. Interestingly, when amplified for high numbers of cycles, the expression of gdf9 was detected in cultured zebrafish follicular cells that were free of oocytes. The expression of gdf9 was downregulated by hCG in both ovarian fragments and isolated follicles in dose- and time-dependent manners, and this inhibition appeared to be stage-dependent, with the strongest inhibition observed for the FG follicles and no effect seen for the PG follicles. This correlates well with the expression profile of the LH receptor (lhcgr) in zebrafish follicles. In conclusion, as an oocyte-derived growth factor, GDF9 is highly conserved across vertebrates. With its biological advantages, zebrafish provides an alternative model for studying gene function and regulation.\n\nEffects of immunization against bone morphogenetic protein-15 and growth differentiation factor-9 on ovarian function in mares.\n\nPubMed\n\nDavis, Kelli A; Klohonatz, Kristin M; Mora, Darcy S O; Twenter, Hannah M; Graham, Peter E; Pinedo, Pablo; Eckery, Douglas C; Bruemmer, Jason E\n\n2018-05-01\n\nCurrently there is no contraceptive vaccine that can cause permanent sterility in mares. This study investigates the effect of vaccination against oocyte-specific growth factors, Bone Morphogenetic Protein 15 (BMP-15) and Growth Differentiation Factor 9 (GDF-9), on ovarian function of mares. It was hypothesized that immunization against these growth factors would prevent ovulation and/or accelerate depletion of the oocyte reserve. For this study, 30 mares were randomly assigned to three groups (nâ¯=â¯10/group) and vaccinated with BMP-15 or GDF-9 peptides conjugated to KLH and adjuvant, or a control of phosphate buffered saline and adjuvant. Horses received vaccinations at weeks 0, 6, 12, and 18. Ovarian activity and estrous behavior were evaluated 3 days a week via ultrasonography and interaction with a stallion. The study was initiated on March1, 2016. Upon evaluation of ovulation rate, the GDF-9 group did not have a difference (Pâ¯=â¯0.66) in ovulation rate when compared to controls (10.8 and 10.0 ovulations, respectively), but the number of ovulations in the BMP-15 group was less (Pâ¯=â¯0.02; 4.9 ovulations). Average follicle size prior to ovulation was less (Pâ¯<â¯0.0001) in both treatment groups compared to controls. Estrous behavior was altered in both the BMP-15 and GDF-9 groups compared to controls after the second vaccination (Pâ¯=â¯0.05 and 0.03, respectively). Although further research is required to determine the continued effects of vaccination against GDF-9 on ovulation rates, these results indicate that vaccination against BMP-15 and GDF-9 could serve as a contraceptive in wild horse populations.

Here, we show the involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in brown adipogenesis mediated by GDF5. Overexpression of GDF5 in cells expressing adipocyte protein-2 markedly accelerated the phosphorylationmoreÂ Â» of Smad1/5/8 and Akt in white and brown adipose tissues. In brown adipose tissue from heterozygous GDF5{sup Rgsc451} mutant mice expressing a dominant-negative (DN) GDF5 under obesogenic conditions, the basal phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and Akt was significantly attenuated. Exposure to GDF5 not only promoted the phosphorylation of both Smad1/5/8 and Akt in cultured brown pre-adipocytes, but also up-regulated Pgc1a and uncoupling protein-1 expression in a manner sensitive to the PI3K/Akt inhibitor Ly294002 as well as retroviral infection with DN-Akt. GDF5 drastically promoted BMP-responsive luciferase reporter activity in a Ly294002-sensitive fashion. Both Ly294002 and DN-Akt markedly inhibited phosphorylation of Smad5 in the nuclei of brown pre-adipocytes. These results suggest that PI3K/Akt signals play a role in the GDF5-mediated brown adipogenesis through a mechanism related to activation of the Smad pathway.Â«Â less\n\nChanges in expression and secretion patterns of fibroblast growth factor 8 and Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway molecules during murine neural stem/progenitor cell differentiation in vitroâ\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLu, Jiang; Lu, Kehuan; Li, Dongsheng\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIn the present study, we investigated the dynamic expression of fibroblast growth factor 8 and Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway related factors in the process of in vitro hippocampal neural stem/progenitor cell differentiation from embryonic Sprague-Dawley rats or embryonic Kunming species mice, using fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and western blot analyses. Results demonstrated that the dynamic expression of fibroblast growth factor 8 was similar to fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 expression but not to other fibroblast growth factor receptors. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor 8 and Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway protein factors were secreted by neural cells into the intercellular niche. Our experimental findings indicate that fibroblast growth factor 8 and Sonic Hedgehog expression may be related to the differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells.

Measurements were performed before (phase I), at the end of the race (phase II) and 48 h post-race (phase III). GDF-15 and endoglin serum concentrations were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and NT-pro-BNP plasma levels by electrochemiluminescence. GDF-15 levels were increased from phase I (563.9 +/- 57.1 pg ml(-1)) to phase II (2311.1 +/- 462.3 pg ml(-1)) and decreased at phase III (862.0 +/- 158.0 pg ml(-1)) (p < 0.0002). NT-pro-BNP levels followed a similar pattern to that of GDF-15 from 38.1 +/- 4.8 pg ml(-1) at phase I to 1280.6 +/- 259.0 pg ml(-1) at phase II and 89.8 +/- 13.6 pg ml(-1) at phase III (p < 0.0001) and at the same time points, endoglin levels were 4.7 +/- 0.2 ng ml(-1) at phase I, 5.8 +/- 0.2 ng ml(-1) at phase II and 4.3 +/- 0.2 ng ml(-1) at phase III (p < 0.002). These findings indicate that circulating GDF-15, endoglin and NT-pro-BNP levels reflect a transient endothelial dysfunction in these athletes who participated in a foot race consisting of continuous, prolonged and brisk exercise.\n\nGrowth/differentiation factor-5: pre-clinical and clinical evaluations of periodontal regeneration and alveolar augmentation--review.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Jaebum; WikesjÃ¶, Ulf M E\n\n2014-08-01\n\nGrowth/differentiation factor-5 (GDF-5) plays critical roles in mesenchymal cell differentiation and stimulates human periodontal ligament cell proliferation. Potentially, GDF-5 may also play roles in wound healing including periodontal regeneration and alveolar augmentation. The objective of this review was to provide up-to-date information from pre-clinical/clinical studies evaluating GDF-5 for these indications. A comprehensive search using PubMed and Google search engines was conducted to identify reports on GDF-5 applied to periodontal and alveolar indications. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts from a total of 479 reports. Full-length articles of 17 pre-clinical and four clinical studies were selected and reviewed. Canine-, porcine- and non-human primate-based models as well as human clinical trials were used in the evaluation of GDF-5 in support of periodontal regeneration and alveolar augmentation. An absorbable collagen sponge (ACS), Î²-tricalcium phosphate (Î²-TCP) and a poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) were evaluated as candidate carriers for GDF-5 using various dose and healing intervals demonstrating significantly enhanced periodontal regeneration/alveolar augmentation including cementum, periodontal ligament and alveolar bone with limited, if any, adverse effects. Growth/differentiation factor-5 supports periodontal regeneration/alveolar augmentation without aberrant healing events documented in qualified pre-clinical models and clinical pilot studies. In perspective, GDF-5 appears a promising technology for periodontal regeneration/alveolar augmentation. Â© 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF 15) is a protein that is highly expressed in the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells of patients with MM. This study investigated whether the clinical stage of the disease, treatment response and survival are affected by pretreatment serum GDF 15 levels. Serum GDF 15 levels were measured in 35 newly diagnosed MM patients and 27 healthy controls. The correlation between serum GDF 15 levels and various clinical and laboratory parameters was analyzed. The study demonstrated significantly higher levels of GDF 15 in MM patients. There was a negative correlation between GDF 15 levels, hemoglobin and albumin levels, and a positive correlation between GDF 15 levels, CRP, creatinine, Î²-2-microglobulin and stage. GDF 15 levels were lower in patients who could receive autologous stem cell transplantation compared to other groups, representing a statistically significant difference. However, in the survival analyses, GDF 15 level did not have an impact on survival. High serum levels of GDF 15 may indicate a poor treatment response. Our study supports the prognostic value of GDF 15 in MM. Â© 2013 S.

To explore this possibility, we queried our combined microarray database for expression of 487 growth factors and receptors. Fifty-one gene elements were overdetected on the 8C arrays relative to hES/iPS cells, including 14 detected at least 80-fold higher, which annotated to multiple pathways: six cytokine family (CSF1R, IL2RG, IL3RA, IL4, IL17B, IL23R), four transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) family (BMP6, BMP15, GDF9, ENG), one fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family [FGF14(FH4)], one epidermal growth factor member (GAB1), plus CD36, and CLEC10A. 8C-specific gene elements were enriched (73%) for reported circadian-controlled genes in mouse tissues. High-level detection of CSF1R, ENG, IL23R, and IL3RA specifically on the 8C arrays suggests the embryo plays an active role in blocking immune rejection and is poised for trophectoderm development; robust detection of NRG1, GAB1, -2, GRB7, and FGF14(FHF4) indicates novel roles in early development in addition to their known roles in later development. Forty-four gene elements were underdetected on the 8C arrays, including 11 at least 80-fold under the pluripotent cells: two cytokines (IFITM1, TNFRSF8), five TGFBs (BMP7, LEFTY1, LEFTY2, TDGF1, TDGF3), two FGFs (FGF2, FGF receptor 1), plus ING5, and WNT6. The microarray detection patterns suggest that hES/iPS cells exhibit suppressed circadian competence, underexpression of early differentiation markers, and more robust expression of generic pluripotency genes, in keeping with an artificial state of continual uncommitted cell division. In contrast, gene expression patterns of the 8C embryo suggest that\n\nGrowth differentiation factor 9 signaling requires ERK1/2 activity in mouse granulosa and cumulus cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nSasseville, Maxime; Ritter, Lesley J; Nguyen, Thao M; Liu, Fang; Mottershead, David G; Russell, Darryl L; Gilchrist, Robert B\n\n2010-09-15\n\nOvarian folliculogenesis is driven by the combined action of endocrine cues and paracrine factors. The oocyte secretes powerful mitogens, such as growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9), that regulate granulosa cell proliferation, metabolism, steroidogenesis and differentiation. This study investigated the role of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2; also known as MAPK3/1) signaling pathway on GDF9 action on granulosa cells. Results show that mitogenic action of the oocyte is prevented by pharmacological inhibition of the EGFR-ERK1/2 pathway. Importantly, EGFR-ERK1/2 activity as well as rous sarcoma oncogene family kinases (SFK) are required for signaling through SMADs, mediating GDF9, activin A and TGFbeta1 mitogenic action in granulosa cells. GDF9 could not activate ERK1/2 or affect EGF-stimulated ERK1/2 in granulosa cells. However, induction of the SMAD3-specific CAGA reporter by GDF9 in granulosa cells required active EGFR, SFKs and ERK1/2 as did GDF9-responsive gene expression. Finally, the EGFR-SFKs-ERK1/2 pathway was shown to be required for the maintenance of phosphorylation of the SMAD3 linker region. Together our results suggest that receptivity of granulosa cells to oocyte-secreted factors, including GDF9, is regulated by the level of activation of the EGFR and resulting ERK1/2 activity, through the requisite permissive phosphorylation of SMAD3 in the linker region. Our results indicate that oocyte-secreted TGFbeta-like ligands and EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling are cooperatively required for the unique granulosa cell response to the signal from oocytes mediating granulosa cell survival and proliferation and hence the promotion of follicle growth and ovulation.\n\nCirculating and Placental Growth-Differentiation Factor 15 in Preeclampsia and in Pregnancy Complicated by Diabetes Mellitus\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSugulle, Meryam; Dechend, Ralf; Herse, Florian; Weedon-Fekjaer, M. Susanne; Johnsen, Guro M.; Brosnihan, K. Bridget; Anton, Lauren; Luft, Friedrich C.; Wollert, Kai C.; Kempf, Tibor; Staff, Anne Cathrine\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAbstract Growth-differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), a stress-responsive transforming growth factor-Î²ârelated cytokine, is emerging as a new risk marker in patients with cardiovascular disease. We explored GDF-15 in preeclampsia and in diabetic pregnancies, because these conditions are associated with augmented risk for cardiovascular disease, both in mother and in offspring. Plasma from pregnant women (n=267; controls: n=59, preeclampsia: n=85, diabetes mellitus: n=112, and superimposed preeclampsia in diabetes mellitus: n=11), fetal plasma (n=72), and amniotic fluid (n=99) were analyzed by immunoassay for GDF-15. Placental GDF-15 mRNA and protein expression levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblots in 78 and 18 pregnancies, respectively. Conditioned media from preeclamptic (n=6) and control (n=6) villous placenta explants were analyzed by immunoassay for GDF-15. Median maternal GDF-15 concentration was elevated in those with diabetes mellitus, as compared with controls (91 549 versus 79 875 ng/L; P=0.02). Median GDF-15 concentration was higher in patients with preeclampsia than in controls in term maternal blood samples (127 061 versus 80 319 ng/L; P<0.001). In the fetal circulation and amniotic fluid, GDF-15 was elevated in preeclampsia and superimposed preeclampsia in diabetes mellitus, as compared with controls. GDF-15 placental mRNA expression was elevated in preeclampsia, as compared with controls (P=0.002). Placenta immunoblots confirmed a single GDF-15 protein band, and a time-dependent increase in GDF-15 protein was detected in the conditioned media. Our study is the first to show that GDF-15 is dysregulated, both in preeclampsia and in diabetic pregnancies. The mechanisms and diagnostic implications of these findings remain to be explored.

In particular, we have used this technology to study the function of multiple members of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily including inhibins, activins, and growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF-9 or Gdf9). Knockout mice lacking GDF-9 are infertile due to a block in folliculogenesis at the primary follicle stage. In addition, recombinant GDF-9 regulates multiple cumulus granulosa cell functions in the periovulatory period including hyaluronic acid synthesis and cumulus expansion. We have also cloned an oocyte-specific homolog of GDF-9 from mice and humans, which is termed bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP-15 or Bmp15). To define the function of BMP-15 in mice, we generated embryonic stem cells and knockout mice, which have a null mutation in this X-linked gene. Male chimeric and Bmp15 null mice are normal and fertile. In contrast to Bmp15 null males and Gdf9 knockout females, Bmp15 null females (Bmp15(-/-)) are subfertile and usually have minimal ovarian histopathological defects, but demonstrate decreased ovulation and fertilization rates. To further decipher possible direct or indirect genetic interactions between GDF-9 and BMP-15, we have generated double mutant mice lacking one or both alleles of these related homologs. Double homozygote females (Bmp15(-/-)Gdf9(-/-)) display oocyte loss and cysts and resemble Gdf9(-/-) mutants. In contrast, Bmp15(-/-)Gdf9(+/-) female mice have more severe fertility defects than Bmp15(-/-) females, which appear to be due to abnormalities in ovarian folliculogenesis, cumulus cell physiology, and fertilization. Thus, the dosage of intact Bmp15 and Gdf9 alleles directly influences the destiny of the oocyte during folliculogenesis and in the periovulatory period. These studies have important implications for human fertility control and the maintenance of fertility and\n\nGrowth differentiation factor 3 is induced by bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP-6) and BMP-7 and increases luteinizing hormone receptor messenger RNA expression in human granulosa cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nShi, Jia; Yoshino, Osamu; Osuga, Yutaka; Akiyama, Ikumi; Harada, Miyuki; Koga, Kaori; Fujimoto, Akihisa; Yano, Tetsu; Taketani, Yuji\n\n2012-04-01\n\nTo examine the relevance of growth differentiation factor 3 (GDF-3) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) cytokines in human ovary. Molecular studies. Research laboratory. Eight women undergoing salpingo-oophorectomy and 30 women undergoing ovarian stimulation for inÂ vitro fertilization. Localizing GDF-3 protein in human ovaries; granulosa cells (GC) cultured with GDF-3, BMP-6, or BMP-7 followed by RNA extraction. The localization of GDF-3 protein in normal human ovaries via immunohistochemical analysis, GDF-3 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression evaluation via quantitative real-time reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and evaluation of the effect of GDF-3 on leuteinizing hormone (LH) receptor mRNA expression via quantitative real-time RT-PCR. In the ovary, BMP cytokines, of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²) superfamily, are known as a luteinization inhibitor by suppressing LH receptor expression in GC. Growth differentiation factor 3, a TGF-Î² superfamily cytokine, is recognized as an inhibitor of BMP cytokines in other cells. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that GDF-3 was strongly detected in the GC of antral follicles. An inÂ vitro assay revealed that BMP-6 or BMP-7 induced GDF-3 mRNA in GC. Also, GDF-3 increased LH receptor mRNA expression and inhibited the effect of BMP-7, which suppressed the LH receptor mRNA expression in GC. GDF-3, induced with BMP-6 and BMP-7, might play a role in folliculogenesis by inhibiting the effect of BMP cytokines. Copyright Â© 2012 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

Multiple mutations in BMP15 have been identified in women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), supporting a pathogenic role; however, the underlying biological mechanism of many of these mutants remains unresolved. To determine how mutations associated with ovarian dysfunction alter the biological activity of human BMP15. The effects of 10 mutations in BMP15 on protein production, activation of granulosa cells, and synergy with GDF9 were assessed. Sequencing of 35 patients with POI identified both an unrecognized BMP15 variant (c.986G>A, R329H) and a variant (c.581T>C, F194S) previously associated with the condition. Assessing expression and activity of these and 8 other BMP15 mutants identified: (1) multiple variants, including L148P, F194S, and Y235C, with reduced mature protein production; (2) three variants (R138H, A180T, and R329H) with â¼fourfold lower activity than wild-type BMP15; and (3) 3 variants (R68W, F194S, and N196K) with a significantly reduced ability to synergize with GDF9. Mutations in BMP15 associated with POI reduce mature protein production, activity, or synergy with GDF9. The latter effect is perhaps most interesting given that interactions with GDF9 most likely underlie the physiology of BMP15 in the human ovary.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the contribution of recombinant human transforming growth factor beta 1 (rhTGF-beta1) and growth differentiation factor (GDF)-5, known for their role in connective tissue regeneration, to proliferation and matrix production by human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) cultured onto woven, bioabsorbable, 3-dimensional (3D) poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) scaffolds. Cells were cultured for 12 days in the presence or absence of these growth factors at different concentrations. Human BMSCs attached to the suture material, proliferated, and synthesized extracellular matrix rich in collagen type I and collagen III. No differentiation was demonstrated toward cartilage or bone tissue. The addition of rhTGF-beta1 (1-10 ng/mL) and GDF-5 (10-100 ng/mL) increased cell content (p < 0.05), but only TGF-beta1 also increased total collagen production (p < 0.05) and collagen production per cell, which is a parameter indicating differentiation. In conclusion, stimulation with rhTGF-beta1, and to a lesser extent with GDF-5, can modulate human BMSCs toward collagenous soft tissue when applied to a 3D hybrid construct. The use of growth factors could play an important role in the improvement of ligament tissue engineering.\n\nEvaluation of an injectable rhGDF-5/PLGA construct for minimally invasive periodontal regenerative procedures: a histological study in the dog.\n\nPubMed\n\nKwon, David H; Bennett, William; Herberg, Samuel; Bastone, Patrizia; Pippig, Susanne; Rodriguez, Nancy A; Susin, Cristiano; WikesjÃ¶, Ulf M E\n\n2010-04-01\n\nTo evaluate the injectability, biocompatibility, safety, and periodontal wound healing/regeneration following application of a novel bioresorbable recombinant human growth/differentiation factor-5 (rhGDF-5)/poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) construct. Periodontal pockets (3 x 6 mm, width x depth) were surgically created over the buccal roots of the second and fourth mandibular pre-molars in eight adult Hound Labrador mongrel dogs. Surgeries including injection of the rhGDF-5/PLGA construct into the pockets were sequenced that four animals provided 2-/4-week and four animals 6-/8-week observations of sites receiving rhGDF-5/PLGA or serving as sham-surgery control. The rhGDF-5/PLGA construct was easy to prepare and apply. Approximately 0.2 ml (93 microg rhGDF-5)/tooth was used. Clinical and radiographic healing was exemplary without adverse events. Healing was characterized by a non-specific connective tissue attachment, acellular/cellular cementum, periodontal ligament (PDL), bone regeneration, and a junctional epithelium. PLGA fragments were observed in 4/7, 2/8, and 1/8 sites at 2, 4, and 6 weeks, respectively. Associated inflammatory reactions exhibited no limiting effect on periodontal wound healing/regeneration. Root resorption/ankylosis was not observed. Bone formation showed apparent increased maturity (lamellar bone) at 6 weeks in sites receiving rhGDF-5/PLGA compared with the control. Both protocols exhibited significant increases in PDL, cementum, and bone regeneration over time, without significant differences between treatments. In time, PDL and cementum regeneration was twofold greater for the control at 4 weeks (p=0.04) while increased bone formation was observed at sites receiving rhGDF-5/PLGA (p<0.01). In conclusion, the rhGDF-5/PLGA construct appears to be a safe technology for injectable, ease-of-use application of rhGDF-5-stimulated periodontal wound healing/regeneration.

Recent work has demonstrated the potential rejuvenation impact of growth differentiation factor-11 (GDF-11) in aged mice. We carried out experiments to evaluate the impact of a single dose of recombinant (rGDF-11) on short-term visual and spatial memory in middle-aged male mice. On the novel object recognition task, we observed middle-aged mice treated rGDF-11 showed improved performance on the novel object recognition task. However, middle-aged mice did not show increased expression of phosphorylated-Smad2/3, a downstream effector of GDF-11. We noted however that the expression of the transcription factor, Sox2 was increased within the dentate gyrus. Our data suggest that a single injection of rGDF-11 contributes to improvements in cognitive function of middle-aged animals, which may be critical in the preservation of short-term memory capacity in old age.

Ca 2+ signaling modulates cardiomyocyte growth; however, the role of Ca 2+ -dependent mechanisms in mediating the effects of GDF11 remains elusive. Here, we found that GDF11 induced intracellular Ca 2+ increases in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and that this response was blocked by chelating the intracellular Ca 2+ with BAPTA-AM or by pretreatment with inhibitors of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IPâ) pathway. Moreover, GDF11 increased the phosphorylation levels and luciferase activity of Smad2/3 in a concentration-dependent manner, and the inhibition of IPâ-dependent Ca 2+ release abolished GDF11-induced Smad2/3 activity. To assess whether GDF11 exerted antihypertrophic effects by modulating Ca 2+ signaling, cardiomyocytes were exposed to hypertrophic agents (100 nM testosterone or 50 Î¼M phenylephrine) for 24 h. Both treatments increased cardiomyocyte size and [Â³H]-leucine incorporation, and these responses were significantly blunted by pretreatment with GDF11 over 24 h. Moreover, downregulation of Smad2 and Smad3 with siRNA was accompanied by inhibition of the antihypertrophic effects of GDF11. These results suggest that GDF11 modulates Ca 2+ signaling and the Smad2/3 pathway to prevent cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.\n\nGrowth differentiation factor-15 level predicts major bleeding and cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes: results from the PLATO study.\n\nPubMed\n\nHagstrÃ¶m, Emil; James, Stefan K; Bertilsson, Maria; Becker, Richard C; Himmelmann, Anders; Husted, Steen; Katus, Hugo A; Steg, Philippe Gabriel; Storey, Robert F; Siegbahn, Agneta; Wallentin, Lars\n\n2016-04-21\n\nGrowth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) predicts death and composite cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We investigated the independent associations between GDF-15 levels and major bleeding, the extent of coronary lesions and individual CV events in patients with ACS. Growth differentiation factor-15 was analysed at baseline ( ITALIC! n = 16 876) in patients with ACS randomized to ticagrelor or clopidogrel in the PLATO (PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes) trial. Growth differentiation factor-15 levels were related to extent of coronary artery disease (CAD) and to all types of non-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)-related major bleeding, spontaneous myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and death during 12-month follow-up. In Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for established risk factors for CV disease and prognostic biomarkers (N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, cystatin C, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, and high-sensitive troponin T), 1 SD increase in ln GDF-15 was associated with increased risk of major bleeding with a hazard ratio (HR) 1.37 (95% confidence interval: 1.25-1.51) and with a similar increase in risk across different bleeding locations. For the same increase in ln GDF-15, the HR for the composite of CV death, spontaneous MI, and stroke was 1.29 (1.21-1.37), CV death 1.41 (1.30-1.53), all-cause death 1.41 (1.31-1.53), spontaneous MI 1.15 (1.05-1.26), and stroke 1.19 (1.01-1.42). The ITALIC! C-statistic improved for the prediction of CV death and non-CABG-related major bleeding when adding GDF-15 to established risk factors. In patients with ACS, higher levels of GDF-15 are associated with raised risks of all types of major non-CABG-related bleeding, spontaneous MI, and stroke as well as CV and total mortality and seem to improve risk stratification for CV-mortality and major bleeding beyond established risk factors. www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT00391872.

In total, 31 patients participated in this multicenter clinical trial. They required a two-stage unilateral maxillary sinus floor augmentation (residual bone height <5 mm). According to a parallel-group design, the patients were randomized to three treatment groups: (a) augmentation with rhGDF-5/Î²-TCP and a 3-month healing period, (b) augmentation with rhGDF-5/Î²-TCP and a 4-month healing period and (c) medical device Î²-TCP mixed with autologous bone and a 4-month healing period. The primary study objective was the area of newly formed bone within the augmented area as assessed by histomorphometric evaluation of trephine bur biopsies. The osseous regeneration was similar in each treatment group; the amount of newly formed bone ranged between 28% (Â± 15.5%) and 31.8% (Â± 17.9%). Detailed analysis of histological data will be published elsewhere. As secondary efficacy variables, the augmentation height at the surgery site was measured by radiography. The largest augmentation was radiologically achieved in the rhGDF-5/Î²-TCP - 3-month and the rhGDF-5/Î²-TCP - 4-month treatment groups. As safety parameters, adverse events were recorded and anti-drug antibody levels were evaluated. Most of the adverse events were judged as unrelated to the study medication. Four out of 47 (8.5%) implants failed in patients treated with rhGDF-5/Î²-TCP, a result that is in agreement with the general implant failure rate of 5-15%. Transiently very low amounts of anti-rhGDF-5 antibodies were detected in some patients who received rhGDF-5, which was not related to the bone formation outcome. rhGDF-5/Î²-TCP was found to be effective and safe as the control treatment with autologous bone mixed Î²-TCP in sinus floor\n\nAssociations of Circulating Growth Differentiation Factor-15 and ST2 Concentrations With Subclinical Vascular Brain Injury and Incident Stroke.\n\nPubMed\n\nAndersson, Charlotte; Preis, Sarah R; Beiser, Alexa; DeCarli, Charles; Wollert, Kai C; Wang, Thomas J; Januzzi, James L; Vasan, Ramachandran S; Seshadri, Sudha\n\n2015-09-01\n\nGrowth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) and soluble (s)ST2 are markers of cardiac and vascular stress. We investigated the associations between circulating concentrations of these biomarkers and incident stroke and subclinical vascular brain injury in a sample from the Framingham Offspring cohort. We followed 3374 stroke- and dementia-free individuals (mean age, 59.0Â±9.7 years; 53% women) attending the Framingham Offspring sixth examination cycle 11.8Â±3.0 years for incident stroke. A subsample of 2463 individuals underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological testing â4.0Â±1.7 years after the sixth examination. After adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and urine albumin levels, higher stress biomarker levels were associated cross-sectionally with lower brain volumes (Î² coefficients for intracranial volume comparing fourth [Q4] versus first biomarker [Q1] quartiles: -0.71% for GDF-15; P=0.002 and 0.47% for sST2; P=0.02) and worse performance on the visual reproduction test (Î² coefficients for Q4 versus Q1: -0.62 for GDF-15; P=0.009 and -0.40 for sST2; P=0.04). Higher GDF-15 concentrations were also associated with greater log-transformed white-matter hyperintensity volumes (Î² for Q4 versus Q1=0.19; P=0.01). Prospectively, a total of 203 (6%) individuals developed incident stroke/transient ischemic attack during follow-up. After multivariable adjustment, sST2 remained significantly associated with stroke/transient ischemic attack, hazard ratio for Q4 versus Q1 of 1.76, 95% confidence interval of 1.06 to 2.92, and P=0.03. Circulating GDF-15 and sST2 are associated with subclinical brain injury and cognitive impairment. Higher sST2 concentrations are also associated with incident stroke, suggesting potential links between cardiac stress biomarkers and brain injury.

However, the effect of isolated and combined use of bFGF/GDF-5 remains still unclear. We investigated cellular proliferation and migration responding to bFGF/GDF-5 using rabbit MCL fibroblasts. Rabbit MCL injury was treated by bFGF and/or GDF-5moreÂ Â» with peptide hydrogels. Gene expression and deposition of collagens in healing tissues were evaluated. bFGF/GDF-5 treatment additively enhanced cell proliferation and migration. bFGF/GDF-5 hydrogels stimulated Col1a1 expression without increasing Col3a1 expression. Combined use of bFGF/GDF-5 stimulated type I collagen deposition and the reorganization of fiber alignment, and induced better morphology of fibroblasts in healing MCLs. Our study indicates that combined use of bFGF/GDF-5 might enhance MCL healing by increasing proliferation and migration of MCL fibroblasts, and by regulating collagen synthesis and connective fiber alignment.Â«Â less\n\nGDF10 Is a Signal for Axonal Sprouting and Functional Recovery after Stroke\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLi, S; Nie, EH; Yin, Y; Benowitz, LI; Tung, S; Vinters, HV; Bahjat, FR; Stenzel-Poore, MP; Kawaguchi, R; Coppola, G; Carmichael, ST\n\n2016-01-01\n\nStroke produces a limited process of neural repair. Axonal sprouting in cortex adjacent to the infarct is part of this recovery process, but the signal that initiates axonal sprouting is not known. Growth and Differentiation Factor 10 (GDF10) is induced in peri-infarct neurons in mouse, non-human primate and human. GDF10 promotes axonal outgrowth in vitro in mouse, rat and human neurons through TGFÎ²RI/II signaling. Using pharmacogenetic gain and loss of function studies, GDF10 produces axonal sprouting and enhanced functional recovery after stroke; knocking down GDF10 blocks axonal sprouting and reduces recovery. RNA-seq from peri-infarct cortical neurons indicates that GDF10 downregulates PTEN and upregulates PI3 kinase signaling and induces specific axonal guidance molecules. Unsupervised genome-wide association analysis of the GDF10 transcriptome shows that it is not related to neurodevelopment but may partially overlap with other CNS injury patterns. GDF10 is a stroke-induced signal for axonal sprouting and functional recovery.

In stressed or disease conditions, however, animals use alternative neuronal pathways to adapt to the metabolic challenges of altered energy demand3. Recent studies have identified brain areas outside the hypothalamus that are activated under these ânon-homeostaticâ conditions4,5,6, but the molecular nature of the peripheral signals and brain-localized receptors that activate these circuits remains elusive. Here we identify glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) receptor alpha-like (GFRAL) as a brainstem-restricted receptormoreÂ Â» for growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). GDF15 regulates food intake, energy expenditure and body weight in response to metabolic and toxin-induced stresses; we show that Gfral knockout mice are hyperphagic under stressed conditions and are resistant to chemotherapy-induced anorexia and body weight loss. GDF15 activates GFRAL-expressing neurons localized exclusively in the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarius of the mouse brainstem. It then triggers the activation of neurons localized within the parabrachial nucleus and central amygdala, which constitute part of the âemergency circuitâ that shapes feeding responses to stressful conditions7. GDF15 levels increase in response to tissue stress and injury, and elevated levels are associated with body weight loss in numerous chronic human diseases8,9. By isolating GFRAL as the receptor for GDF15-induced anorexia and weight loss, we identify a mechanistic basis for the non-homeostatic regulation of neural circuitry by a peripheral signal associated with tissue damage and stress. These findings provide opportunities to develop therapeutic agents for the treatment of disorders with altered energy demand.Â«Â less\n\nGrowth differentiation factor 15 is associated with left atrial/left atrial appendage thrombus in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.\n\nPubMed\n\nHu, Xiao Feng; Zhan, Rui; Xu, Shanhu; Wang, Junjun; Wu, Jiong; Liu, Xiaoli; Li, Yaguo; Chen, Linhui\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThere is evidence suggesting that growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) appears to be associated with stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). AF-related thromboembolic stroke is predominantly attributed to the thrombus from the left atrium (LA) or left atrial appendage (LAA). GDF-15 is related to LA/LAA thrombus in nonvalvular AF (NVAF) patients. A total of 894 patients with NVAF without anticoagulation therapy were included in this study. All patients routinely underwent transesophageal echocardiography for detection of LA/LAA thrombus. GDF-15 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Logistic regression models were used to test for association. LA/LAA thrombus was detected by transesophageal echocardiography in 69 (7.72%) patients with AF. The GDF-15 levels in the patients with LA/LAA thrombus were significantly higher than those without LA/LAA thrombus (log 10 GDF-15: 2.989âÂ±â0.023âng/L vs 2.831âÂ±â0.007âng/L; Pâ<â0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that GDF-15 was an independent risk factor for LA/LAA thrombus (odds ratio [per quarter]: 1.799, 95% confidence interval: 1.381-2.344, Pâ<â0.001) after adjusting for potential clinical risk factors. The optimal cutoff point for GDF-15 predicting LA/LAA thrombus was 809.9âng/L (sensitivity, 75.3%; specificity, 61.5%), determined by ROC curve. The area under the curve was 0.709 (95% confidence interval: 0.644-0.770, Pâ<â0.001). Elevated GDF-15 indicated a significantly increased risk for LA/LAA thrombus in NVAF patients. Thus, GDF-15 might be a potentially useful adjunct in discriminating LA/LAA thrombus in NVAF patients.

In the present study, we describe the cellular localization, the developmental profiles, and the response to unilateral ovariectomy (a procedure implying the surgical removal of one of the ovaries) of protein and mRNA steady-state levels of Bmp15 and Gdf9 in the ovary of European sea bass, an important fish species for marine aquaculture industry. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the oocyte is the main production site of Bmp15 and Gdf9 in European sea bass ovary. During oocyte development, Bmp15 protein expression started to be detected only from the lipid vesicle stage onwards but not in primary pre-vitellogenic (i.e. perinucleolar) oocytes as the bmp15 mRNA already did. Gdf9 protein and gdf9 mRNA expression were both detected in primary perinucleolar oocytes and followed similar decreasing patterns thereafter. Unilateral ovariectomy induced a full compensatory growth of the remaining ovary in the 2-month period following surgery (Ã. GarcÃ­a-LÃ³pez, M.I. SÃ¡nchez-Amaya, C.R. Tyler, F. Prat 2011). The compensatory growth elicited different changes in the expression levels of mRNA and protein of both factors, although the involvement of Bmp15 and Gdf9 in the regulatory network orchestrating such process remains unclear at present. Altogether, our results establish a solid base for further studies focused on elucidating the specific functions of Bmp15 and Gdf9 during primary and secondary oocyte growth in European sea bass.

Following our finding that fibroblast growth factor 8 mRNA expression is increased in breast cancer, we have undertaken an immunohistochemistry study of fibroblast growth factor 8 expression in a series of human breast tissues and other normal tissues. Our findings confirm increased expression of fibroblast growth factor 8 in malignant breast tissue but also show significant fibroblast growth factor 8 expression in non-malignant breast epithelial cells. No significant difference in fibroblast growth factor 8 expression was found between different grades of ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in-situ or cancer of different oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor or nodal status. The highest levels of fibroblast growth factor 8 expression were found in lactating breast tissues and fibroblast growth factor 8 was also detected in human milk. A survey of other normal tissues showed that fibroblast growth factor 8 is expressed in the proliferative cells of the dermis and epithelial cells in colon, ovary fallopian tube and uterus. Fibroblast growth factor 8 appears to be expressed in several organs in man and appears to have an importance in lactation.\n\nAdvancing osteochondral tissue engineering: bone morphogenetic protein, transforming growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor signaling drive ordered differentiation of periosteal cells resulting in stable cartilage and bone formation in vivo.\n\nPubMed\n\nMendes, L F; Katagiri, H; Tam, W L; Chai, Y C; Geris, L; Roberts, S J; Luyten, F P\n\n2018-02-21\n\nChondrogenic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have not yet been used to address the clinical demands of large osteochondral joint surface defects. In this study, self-assembling tissue intermediates (TIs) derived from human periosteum-derived stem/progenitor cells (hPDCs) were generated and validated for stable cartilage formation in vivo using two different animal models. hPDCs were aggregated and cultured in the presence of a novel growth factor (GF) cocktail comprising of transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î²1, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)2, growth differentiation factor (GDF)5, BMP6, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)2. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry were used to study in vitro differentiation. Aggregates were then implanted ectopically in nude mice and orthotopically in critical-size osteochondral defects in nude rats and evaluated by microcomputed tomographyÂ (ÂµCT) and immunohistochemistry. Gene expression analysis after 28 days of in vitro culture revealed the expression of early and late chondrogenic markers and a significant upregulation of NOGGIN as compared to human articular chondrocytes (hACs). Histological examination revealed a bilayered structure comprising of chondrocytes at different stages of maturity. Ectopically, TIs generated both bone and mineralized cartilage at 8 weeks after implantation. Osteochondral defects treated with TIs displayed glycosaminoglycan (GAG) production, type-II collagen, and lubricin expression. Immunostaining for human nuclei protein suggested that hPDCs contributed to both subchondral bone and articular cartilage repair. Our data indicate that in vitro derived osteochondral-like tissues can be generated from hPDCs, which are capable of producing bone and cartilage ectopically and behave orthotopically as osteochondral units.\n\nGrowth differentiation factor-15 promotes glutamate release in medial prefrontal cortex of mice through upregulation of T-type calcium channels.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Dong-Dong; Lu, Jun-Mei; Zhao, Qian-Ru; Hu, Changlong; Mei, Yan-Ai\n\n2016-06-29\n\nGrowth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) has been implicated in ischemic brain injury and synapse development, but its involvement in modulating neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of GDF-15 on non-evoked miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) and neurotransmitter release in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in mice. Incubation of mPFC slices with GDF-15 for 60âmin significantly increased the frequency of mEPSCs without effect on their amplitude. GDF-15 also significantly elevated presynaptic glutamate release, as shown by HPLC. These effects were blocked by dual TGF-Î² type I receptor (TÎ²RI) and TGF-Î² type II receptor (TÎ²RII) antagonists, but not by a TÎ²RI antagonist alone. Meanwhile, GDF-15 enhanced pERK level, and inhibition of MAPK/ERK activity attenuated the GDF-15-induced increases in mEPSC and glutamate release. Blocking T-type calcium channels reduced the GDF-15 induced up-regulation of synaptic transmission. Membrane-protein extraction and use of an intracellular protein-transport inhibitor showed that GDF-15 promoted CaV3.1 and CaV3.3 Î±-subunit expression by trafficking to the membrane. These results confirm previous findings in cerebellar granule neurons, in which GDF-15 induces its neurobiological effects via TÎ²RII and activation of the ERK pathway, providing novel insights into the mechanism of GDF-15 function in cortical neurons.\n\nNuclear factor-ÎºB is a common upstream signal for growth differentiation factor-5 expression in brown adipocytes exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines and palmitate\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHinoi, Eiichi; Iezaki, Takashi; Ozaki, Kakeru\n\nHighlights: â¢ GDF5 expression is up-regulated by IL-1Î², TNF-Î± and palmitate in brown pre-adipocytes. â¢ NF-ÎºB stimulates promoter activity and expression of GDF5 in brown pre-adipocytes. â¢ Recruitment of NF-ÎºB to the GDF5 promoter is facilitated in BAT from ob/ob mice. â¢ An NF-ÎºB inhibitor prevents upregulation of GDF5 expression in brown pre-adipocytes. - Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that genetic and acquired obesity similarly led to drastic upregulation in brown adipose tissue (BAT), rather than white adipose tissue, of expression of both mRNA and corresponding protein for the bone morphogenic protein/growth differentiation factor (GDF) member GDF5 capable of promotingmoreÂ Â» brown adipogenesis. In this study, we evaluated expression profiles of GDF5 in cultured murine brown pre-adipocytes exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines and free fatty acids (FFAs), which are all shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of obesity. Both interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) were effective in up-regulating GDF5 expression in a concentration-dependent manner, while similar upregulation was seen in cells exposed to the saturated FFA palmitate, but not to the unsaturated FFA oleate. In silico analysis revealed existence of the putative nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) binding site in the 5â²-flanking region of mouse GDF5, whereas introduction of NF-ÎºB subunits drastically facilitated both promoter activity and expression of GDF5 in brown pre-adipocytes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed significant facilitation of the recruitment of NF-ÎºB to the GDF5 promoter in lysed extracts of BAT from leptin-deficient ob/ob obese mice. Upregulation o GDF5 expression was invariably inhibited by an NF-ÎºB inhibitor in cultured brown pre-adipocytes exposed to IL-1Î², TNF-Î± and palmitate. These results suggest that obesity leads to upregulation of GDF5 expression responsible for the promotion of brown adipogenesis through a\n\nFibulin-1 Binds to Fibroblast Growth Factor 8 with High Affinity: EFFECTS ON EMBRYO SURVIVAL.\n\nPubMed\n\nFresco, Victor M; Kern, Christine B; Mohammadi, Moosa; Twal, Waleed O\n\n2016-09-02\n\nFibulin-1 (FBLN1) is a member of a growing family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins that includes eight members and is involved in cellular functions such as adhesion, migration, and differentiation. FBLN1 has also been implicated in embryonic heart and valve development and in the formation of neural crest-derived structures, including aortic arch, thymus, and cranial nerves. Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) is a member of a large family of growth factors, and its functions include neural crest cell (NCC) maintenance, specifically NCC migration as well as patterning of structures formed from NCC such as outflow tract and cranial nerves. In this report, we sought to investigate whether FBLN1 and FGF8 have cooperative roles in vivo given their influence on the development of the same NCC-derived structures. Surface plasmon resonance binding data showed that FBLN1 binds tightly to FGF8 and prevents its enzymatic degradation by ADAM17. Moreover, overexpression of FBLN1 up-regulates FGF8 gene expression, and down-regulation of FBLN1 by siRNA inhibits FGF8 expression. The generation of a double mutant Fbln1 and Fgf8 mice (Fbln1(-/-) and Fgf8(-/-)) showed that haplo-insufficiency (Fbln1(+/-) and Fgf8(+/-)) resulted in increased embryonic mortality compared with single heterozygote crosses. The mortality of the FGF8/Fbln1 double heterozygote embryos occurred between 14.5 and 16.5 days post-coitus. In conclusion, FBLN1/FGF8 interaction plays a role in survival of vertebrate embryos, and reduced levels of both proteins resulted in added mortality in utero The FBLN1/FGF8 interaction may also be involved in the survival of neural crest cell population during development.

DNA microarrays have previously been used to evaluate the alterations in growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) gene expression in AHH-1 human lymphoblastoid cells, following exposure to Î³-rays. The present study aimed to characterize the relationship between the dose of ionizing radiation and the produced effects in GDF-15 gene expression in AHH-1 cells and human peripheral blood lymphocytes (HPBLs). GDF-15 mRNA and protein expression levels following exposure to Î³-rays and neutron radiation were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis in AHH-1 cells. In addition, alterations in GDF-15 gene expression in HPBLs following ex vivo irradiation were evaluated. The present results demonstrated that GDF-15 mRNA and protein expression levels in AHH-1 cells were significantly upregulated following exposure to Î³-ray doses ranging between 1 and 10 Gy, regardless of the dose rate. A total of 48 h following exposure to neutron radiation, a dose-response relationship was identified in AHH-1 cells at Î³-ray doses between 0.4 and 1.6 Gy. GDF-15 mRNA levels in HPBLs were significantly upregulated following exposure to Î³-ray doses between 1 and 8 Gy, within 4â48 h following irradiation. These results suggested that significant time- and dose-dependent alterations in GDF-15 mRNA and protein expression occur in AHH-1 cells and HPBLs in the early phases following exposure to ionizing radiation. In conclusion, alterations in GDF-15 gene expression may have potential as a biomarker to evaluate radiation exposure.

Routine, bilateral, critical-size (5-mm), 1-wall, intrabony periodontal defects were surgically created in the mandibular premolar region in 10 beagle dogs. Five animals received rhGDF-5/Î²-TCP and five animals received rhGDF-5/ACS, with a total of 20 Î¼g rhGDF-5 per defect. The animals were euthanized for histologic and histometric analyses at 8 weeks postsurgery. Both rhGDF-5/ACS and rhGDF-5/Î²-TCP stimulated the formation of functionally oriented periodontal ligament, cellular mixed fiber cementum, and woven/lamellar bone. Bone regeneration (height and area) was significantly greater for the rhGDF-5/Î²-TCP construct than for the rhGDF-5/ACS (3.26 Â± 0.30 mm versus 2.22 Â± 0.82 mm, P <0.01; and 10.45 Â± 2.26 mm(2) versus 5.62 Â± 2.39 mm(2), P <0.01, respectively). Cementum formation ranged from 3.83 Â± 0.73 mm to 3.03 Â± 1.18 mm without significant differences between groups. Root resorption/ankylosis was not observed. The Î²-TCP carrier technology significantly enhanced rhGDF-5-stimulated bone formation compared with the ACS benchmark in this discriminating periodontal defect model. The structural integrity of the Î²-TCP carrier, preventing compression while providing a framework for bone ingrowth, may account for the observed results.\n\nRegulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor signalling and trafficking by Src and Eps8.\n\nPubMed\n\nAuciello, Giulio; Cunningham, Debbie L; Tatar, Tulin; Heath, John K; Rappoport, Joshua Z\n\n2013-01-15\n\nFibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) mediate a wide spectrum of cellular responses that are crucial for development and wound healing. However, aberrant FGFR activity leads to cancer. Activated growth factor receptors undergo stimulated endocytosis, but can continue to signal along the endocytic pathway. Endocytic trafficking controls the duration and intensity of signalling, and growth factor receptor signalling can lead to modifications of trafficking pathways. We have developed live-cell imaging methods for studying FGFR dynamics to investigate mechanisms that coordinate the interplay between receptor trafficking and signal transduction. Activated FGFR enters the cell following recruitment to pre-formed clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). However, FGFR activation stimulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis; FGF treatment increases the number of CCPs, including those undergoing endocytosis, and this effect is mediated by Src and its phosphorylation target Eps8. Eps8 interacts with the clathrin-mediated endocytosis machinery and depletion of Eps8 inhibits FGFR trafficking and immediate Erk signalling. Once internalized, FGFR passes through peripheral early endosomes en route to recycling and degredative compartments, through an Src- and Eps8-dependent mechanism. Thus Eps8 functions as a key coordinator in the interplay between FGFR signalling and trafficking. This work provides the first detailed mechanistic analysis of growth factor receptor clustering at the cell surface through signal transduction and endocytic trafficking. As we have characterised the Src target Eps8 as a key regulator of FGFR signalling and trafficking, and identified the early endocytic system as the site of Eps8-mediated effects, this work provides novel mechanistic insight into the reciprocal regulation of growth factor receptor signalling and trafficking.\n\nIFN Regulatory Factor 8 Represses GM-CSF Expression in T cells to Affect Myeloid Cell Lineage Differentiation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPaschall, Amy V.; Zhang, Ruihua; Qi, Chen-Feng; Bardhan, Kankana; Peng, Liang; Lu, Geming; Yang, Jianjun; Merad, Miriam; McGaha, Tracy; Zhou, Gang; Mellor, Andrew; Abrams, Scott I.; Morse, Herbert C.; Ozato, Keiko; Xiong, Huabao; Liu, Kebin\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDuring hematopoiesis, hematopoietic stem cells constantly differentiate into granulocytes and macrophages via a distinct differentiation program that is tightly controlled by myeloid lineage-specific transcription factors. Mice with a null mutation of IFN Regulatory Factor 8 (IRF8) accumulate CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid cells that phenotypically and functionally resemble tumor-induced myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), indicating an essential role of IRF8 in myeloid cell lineage differentiation. However, IRF8 is expressed in various types of immune cells and whether IRF8 functions intrinsically or extrinsically in regulation of myeloid cell lineage differentiation is not fully understood. Here we report an intriguing finding that although IRF8-deficient mice exhibit deregulated myeloid cell differentiation and resultant accumulation of CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs, surprisingly, mice with IRF8 deficiency only in myeloid cells exhibit no abnormal myeloid cell lineage differentiation. Instead, mice with IRF8 deficiency only in T cells exhibited deregulated myeloid cell differentiation and MDSC accumulation. We further demonstrated that IRF8-deficient T cells exhibit elevated GM-CSF expression and secretion. Treatment of mice with GM-CSF increased MDSC accumulation, and adoptive transfer of IRF8-deficient T cells, but not GM-CSF-deficient T cells, increased MDSC accumulation in the recipient chimeric mice. Moreover, overexpression of IRF8 decreased GM-CSF expression in T cells. Our data determine that in addition to its intrinsic function as an apoptosis regulator in myeloid cells, IRF8 also acts extrinsically to represses GM-CSF expression in T cells to control myeloid cell lineage differentiation, revealing a novel mechanism that the adaptive immune component of the immune system regulates the innate immune cell myelopoiesis in vivo.

Prospective clinical study. University hospital. Eighty-one infertile patients who underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The expression levels of the propeptide and mature forms of follicular fluid GDF9 and BMP15 were determined by western blot analysis. The levels of follicular fluid hormones (FSH, E2, and P) were measured with automated chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassays. The relationships between the levels of GDF9 and BMP15, hormones, oocyte maturation, and embryo quality. Mature GDF9 levels were significantly correlated with the nuclear maturation of oocytes. The mean mature GDF9 level was 4.87Â±0.60 in the high-embryo-quality group and 1.45Â±0.81 in the low-embryo-quality group. There were no statistically significant differences in embryo quality among the patients regarding propeptide GDF9 and BMP15 expression status. There was a negative correlation between follicular fluid levels of P and the mature form of GDF9. Higher mature GDF9 levels in the follicular fluid were significantly correlated with oocyte nuclear maturation and embryo quality. Copyright Â© 2011 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

For example, more significance is now assigned to the tumor microenvironment, especially with regard to intercellular signaling in the tumor niche which depends on many factors secreted by tumor cells. In addition, great progress has been made in understanding the influence of factors such as neurotensin, growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), and infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) on the âhallmarks of cancerâ in glioblastoma multiforme. Therefore, in the present work we describe the influence of these factors on the proliferation and apoptosis of neoplastic cells, cancer stem cells, angiogenesis, migration and invasion, and cancer immune evasion in a glioblastoma multiforme tumor. In particular, we discuss the effect of neurotensin, GDF-15, S1P (including the drug FTY720), and infection with CMV on tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), microglial cells, neutrophil and regulatory T cells (Treg), on the tumor microenvironment. In order to better understand the role of the aforementioned factors in tumoral processes, we outline the latest models of intratumoral heterogeneity in glioblastoma multiforme. Based on the most recent reports, we discuss the problems of multi-drug therapy in treating glioblastoma multiforme.

However, MFG-E8 has also gained significant attention because of its wide range of functions in autoimmunity, inflammation and tissue homeostasis. More recently, MFG-E8 has been identified as a critical regulator of bone homeostasis, being expressed in both, osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In addition, it was shown that MFG-E8 fulfils an active role in modulating inflammatory processes, suggesting an anti-inflammatory role of MFG-E8 and proposing it as a novel therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases. This concise review focusses on the expression and regulation of MFG-E8 in the context of inflammatory bone diseases, highlights its role in the pathophysiology of osteoimmune diseases and discusses the therapeutic potential of MFG-E8.
