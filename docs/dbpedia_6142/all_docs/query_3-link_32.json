Patricio Ferrari and Jeronimo Pizarro JOAO CEZAR DE CASTRO ROCHA A Note from the Editor-in-Chief “A Very Original Issue” Fernando Pessoa as English Reader and Writer. The title of this issue of Portuguese Lit- erary & Cultural Studies may intrigue the reader. Does it mean that Patricio Ferrari and Jeronimo Pizarro are concerned mainly with the reception of the Portuguese author in English-speaking countries? Does it convey the importance of litera- ture written in English in Fernando Pessoa’s own works? Does the title stress the overlapping of reading and writing as a key element in understanding the fascination provoked by Pessoa’s (as well as Jorge Luis Borges’s) literature? Indeed, Pessoa and Borges have become an authentic phenomenon as far as the contemporary breadth of their readership is concerned. The fact that they pri- marily wrote, respectively, in Portuguese and Spanish does not seem to hinder the ever-increasing impact of their unique writings, and above all the strength of their disquieting worldviews, which have bewildered readers throughout the world. Primarily, I wrote — and that makes all the difference. From their early child- hood, both authors were exposed to an English-speaking environment; there- fore, they were fluent in at least two languages, and this bilingual predicament is the circumstance brought to the fore by Ferrari and Pizarro in the organiza- tion of this issue, which certainly will become an indispensable reference in the work of Fernando Pessoa in English. The guest editors of this issue, in fact, are accomplished and well-known researchers on the work of Fernando Pessoa. In recent years, they have empha- sized Pessoa’s production written directly in English as well as in French. In the course of their groundbreaking research, they have found unpublished manu- scripts and also have broadened our understanding of the resonances of Pes- soa’s formative years in the whole of his “verse and prose” — to recall the title of one of Octavio Paz’s insightful essays. The novelty of Ferrari and Pizarro’s approach makes this a very original issue — as the reader will realize, the editors have included in their selection the disturbing short story written by the young Fernando Pessoa, that is, by Alexan- der Search, “A Very Original Dinner.” PORTUGUESE LITERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES There is, however, another reason that this issue is particularly relevant in the history of Portuguese Literary & Cultural Studies. This will be the last issue published on paper. In other words, we will begin to publish the journal as an online, open-access publication from the next issue onward. It is our hope that this decision will provide an unprecedented broadening of the community of readers of the journal. XII PATRICIO FERRARI AND JERONIMO PIZARRO Introduction More than even Conrad, Tagore, and Nabokov — to name just a few late nine- teenth-century and early twentieth-century writers who went beyond the realm of the mother tongue — Fernando Pessoa (1888-1935), from childhood on, moved with great ease between Portuguese, English, and French,1 as well as a smattering of humorous and philosophical Latin when appropriate. Publica- tions during his lifetime, along with the numerous unpublished writings in his archive housed at the Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal (National Library of Por- tugal),2 provide ample evidence of an intense engagement with all three lan- guages, at times simultaneously. Moreover, his private library, kept at the Casa Fernando Pessoa (Fernando Pessoa House),3 feels more like the study of an En- glish writer permanently residing in Lisbon, surrounded by many volumes of his favorite English authors, reading French texts only in the original, and pos- sessing a large number of Portuguese books, many signed by fellow writers.4 After Pessoa’s father — a modest employee of the secretary of state, as well as music critic of the Didrio de Noticias — died prematurely, his mother married the then Portuguese consul to South Africa. Pessoa, age seven and a half, left Lisbon to travel with her to Durban, the capital at the time of the British colony of Natal, South Africa. He would remain there for the next nine years (February, 1896- August, 1905), 5 and all his formal education would be in English. Some might say — as Eduardo Lourengo has said — that Pessoa could never have been the writer he became had he not spent his formative years undergoing what can only be de- scribed as a typical upper-middle-class education within the British Empire at the end of the Victorian era. What Pessoa gained in literary terms during those years was invaluable. He became acquainted with Milton’s Paradise Lost long before he read the Portuguese epic poem Os Lusiadas (The Lusiads) of Camoes; he admired Keats for his “love of the decorative” and “love of the natural” before coming in contact with his beloved Cesario Verde, the “poet of unpoetical things”;6 his knowledge of Shakespeare enabled him to produce a series of his own Shake- spearean sonnets in English as well as to read, appreciate, and even attempt trans- lations of Antero de Quental’s sonnets.7 In a word, what Pessoa brought back to Lisbon was something sorely needed among the Portuguese literati of the time: an 1 PORTUGUESE LITERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES informed, outsider’s literary perspective on Portugal and all things Portuguese capable of reinvigorating, or better, redefining, the country’s literary identity. Once back in the city of his birth, the young Pessoa never again set foot in an English-speaking country. Yet like the traveler who dreams about distant lands without actually venturing forth, he never ceased to dream about other places, other ways of feeling, knowing, being ... He had returned home with a mind on fire, brimming with myriad projects, both literary and commercial, often con- ceived in English, often left unfinished, as his archive reveals. In fact, many of his poems echo this sense of endless schemes and dreams without endings: Tenho ja o piano tragado; mas nao, hoje nao trago pianos . . . Amanha e o dia dos pianos. Amanha sentar-me-hei a secretaria para conquistar o mundo; Mas so conquistarei o mundo depois de amanha ... 8 (I’ve got a plan all mapped out; but no, not mapping it out today . . . Tomorrow is the day for plans. Tomorrow is the day I’ll sit at my desk and take over the world; But I’ll only take over the world the day after tomorrow . . .) Taking over the world implied an inner conquest: a verbal, dramatized shed- ding of light on some uncharted land within consciousness. His lifetime’s effort never really swerved from this serious pursuit of a language capable of express- ing the layered, highly complex answer to the always-elusive question of per- sonal identity in all its conceivable dimensions. And in this endeavor, Pessoa’s greatest compass remained, unfailingly, his private library. His voracious appe- tite for books gave him all that was necessary for his poetic voyage. It took him anywhere his precocious intellectual curiosity desired to go: across Europe and all the way to the East. Even across the Atlantic Ocean — to the companionship of Emerson, Hawthorne, and Poe. And how to forget Whitman — that “uni- versao”9 (giant universe) whose portrait Alvaro de Campos kissed and described as “Shakespeare da sensagao que comega a andar a vapor, / Milton-Shelley do horizonte da Electricidade futura!”10 (Shakespeare of the sensation on the verge of steam propulsion, / Milton-Shelley of the dawning future of Electricity!)? Rather than ply the waters in search of new lands, Pessoa’s version of the Portu- guese explorer would plumb oceanic literary depths in search of the ever-chang- ing, fathomless Self. 2 Fernando pessoa as English reader and writer Ferrari and Pizarro What initially launched Pessoa onto the world stage was his modernist epic of personal consciousness: the poetic trio of heteronyms in his “drama-em- gente” (drama-in-people).11 From this initial whirlwind of interest, curiosity led to awareness (and translations) of his other major works in Portuguese — Liuro do desassossego (The Book of Disquiet) and Mensagem (Message; the only Portuguese work published in his lifetime, a year before his death), plus the vast output of his own poetry in Portuguese (as distinct from his heteronymic poetry). Serious interest in the English side of Pessoa, on the other hand, took much longer to rouse. Only twenty years after Pessoa’s death did the focus begin to shift. The publication in 1956 of Maria da Encarnagao Monteiro’s pioneering work, In- cidencias Inglesas na Poesia de Fernando Pessoa (English Influences in the Poetry of Fernando Pessoa),12 was soon followed by a host of editions, translations, and studies by Georg Rudolf Lind, Edouard Roditi, Jorge de Sena, Jose Blanc de Portugal, Hu- bert D. Jennings, Alexandrino Severino, George Monteiro, Susan Margaret Brown, Anne Terlinder, Joao Dionfsio, Luisa Freire, and Maria Irene Ramalho de Sousa Santos, among others.13 More-recent works have been published by some of the contributors to this special issue: Richard Zenith, Mariana Gray de Castro, and Jorge Uribe on Oscar Wilde; Patricia McNeill on William Butler Yeats; Mariana Gray de Castro on Shakespeare; Jorge Uribe on Matthew Arnold; Jeronimo Pizarro on Khayyam-FitzGerald; and Patricio Ferrari on Pessoa’s English metrics.14 Studying the English literary production is pertinent for many reasons, in- cluding the way it helps contextualize Pessoa more thoroughly. It is important to know that before making his literary debut in book form with Mensagem in 1934, he had already published some of his works in English. In 1918 two chap- books came out in English: Antinous, a long poem celebrating the homoerotic love between Antinous and the Emperor Hadrian; and 35 Sonnets, a series of Shakespearean sonnets. Three years later, in 1921, Pessoa published English Poems I— II (a revised version of Antinous and Inscriptions, a series of fourteen epi- taphs inspired by The Greek Anthology, compiled and translated by W. R. Paton15) and English Poems III (Epithalamium, a twenty-one-poem series set in Rome and infused with explicit scenes of heterosexual love). These two slim volumes were published by Olisipo, a commercial agency and publishing house that Pessoa founded that same year. He also published two other poems: one in the well- known London-based journal Athenaeum, and the other in Contemporanea, a liter- ary magazine created in Lisbon. In this connection, it should be mentioned that PORTUGUESE LITERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES the letters Pessoa wrote to English critics, publishers, and editors underscore just how serious he was about his English poetry, and just how hopeful he was about making this poetry known in England.16 Especially now, with Pessoa’s digitized private library online, the importance of English in his formative years is irrefutable: Shakespeare, Milton, Chatterton, Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, and Keats, among others, were the bedrock from which his poetic sensibility emerged. The legacy of this liter- ary language provided him with a scope, the breadth and depth of which charac- terize the quality of the imagination of the true comparatist. Most of what Pessoa eventually wrote was informed by these (his) original sources. Whether his scribbled annotations in works of other authors, his own essays, poems, and fiction, or the writings attributed to his fictitious authors, the most alluring aspect of these English writings is the connections and transformations taking place within Pessoa’s mind as it migrated back and forth between two linguistic homelands. As we learn how to make these connections, we begin to find sig- nificance in what was previously of little interest. What matters is not so much that his English poems, for example, are not of the highest literary quality — one of the reasons many critics have ignored them — but rather what these poems are trying to do, what they express and how they express it, and the ways they foreshadow, in part, what would subsequently take place in Portuguese. This issue on Pessoa is divided into five themes, each of which is treated in several chapters: the Durban years; Pessoa’s short and long poems; mediating Portugal; the nineteenth century and a theoretical framework for heteronymism; and Pessoa’s archive. Additional short sections containing fiction, essays, transla- tions, an interview conducted last year, and three reviews of recent editions of Pessoa round out the volume. Because this is the first publication devoted exclusively to Pessoa as an English reader and writer, we wanted to cover a broad spectrum of topics and approaches while still maintaining cohesion. This explains our choice of contributions. We thought it pertinent to open with writings from Pessoa’s formative years in South Africa. Richard Zenith’s article deals with The Barroioboy Boys, a boy’s storybook serialized in a British magazine in 1903, which sparked enough interest in Pessoa that he wrote his own version in Portuguese. With the political poetry attributed to Charles Robert Anon/Alexander Search as a focal point, Stefan 4 Fernando pessoa as ENGLISH reader and writer Ferrari and Pizarro Helgesson discusses the contextual circumstances of Fernando Pessoa in the Natal Colony at the time of the Anglo-Boer War and its aftermath. George Monteiro opens his article with a new interpretation of Pessoa’s “O Menino da sua mae” (“His Mother’s Child”). Reading it in the light of specific war poems written by English poets Rupert Brooke and A. E. Housman, Mon- teiro offers an alternative reading to Joao Gaspar Simoes’s autobiographical in- terpretation of the poem, and in so doing grants it a greater universality. Pauly Ellen Bothe reflects on the modernist long poem as a cosmopolitan aesthetic phenomenon by examining characteristics of both T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land and Alvaro de Campos’s Ode maritima (Maritime Ode). Patricia Silva McNeill concentrates on Pessoa’s role as cultural mediator between Portugal and England. She demonstrates Pessoa’s familiarity with cul- tural magazines published in London in the first decade of the twentieth cen- tury, and she indicates the extent to which the British avant-garde most likely influenced Pessoa’s work. Jose Barreto transcribes and discusses Pessoa’s most ambitious English prose undertaking before the age of twenty-five: “History of a Dictatorship.” In the chapter on heteronymism,17 Mariana Gray de Castro examines Pessoa’s poetic engagement with Keats, both in specific lines of verse and in the gradual theoretical development concerning the formation of Pessoa’s heteronyms. Flavio Rodrigo Penteado and Caio Gagliardi use some of Pessoa’s theoretical texts in order to analyze the relationship between Robert Browning’s dramatic monologues and the heteronymic project. Finally, Jorge Uribe tracks all of Pessoa’s references to Walter Pater, shedding important light on the influence and the instrumental use of tradition. Bringing to light four unpublished English sonnets, Patricio Ferrari and Carlos Pittella- Leite lay to rest the erroneous idea that Pessoa stopped writing English verse in the early 1920s. As guest editors, we were privileged to be granted the opportunity to coor- dinate the five short final sections.18 The first section, on Pessoa’s fiction, in- cludes a brief introduction and a new transcription of Alexander Search’s “A Very Original Dinner” by Natalia Jerez Quintero. In the section on essays, Filipa de Freitas transcribes and comments on six fragments from Pessoa’s “Erostratus,” an unfinished essay in English concerning artistic fame. In the section on translation Claudia J. Fischer reveals unpublished translations of 5 PORTUGUESE LITERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES lines from Dryden, Keats, Tennyson, and Browning. Following that, Maria de Lurdes Sampaio interviews Margaret Jull Costa, joint winner of the Portuguese Translation Prize in 1992 for her translation of Pessoa’s Liuro do desassossego. The volume closes with reviews by Patricia McNeill, George Monteiro, and Susan Margaret Brown of three recent Pessoa editions. An unpublished English manuscript datable to 1904 and still extant among Pes- soa’s papers reads as follows: It has always been the custom of man to bewail the irrevocable past and look upon it as alone good, beautiful and poetic. The early Romans mourned for the Greek past, and the latter Romans in their turn sighed for the days of the birth of their State. The Middle Ages mourned the Roman days, and what they called their poetry, their loveliness and their joy. Others again did come who sighed for the times of Dante. Does not Fielding bewail days gone be- fore, and does not Dickens bewail the times of Fielding himself? And do we ourselves not wish present again the early days of the past century; should we not love to hear the rattling of a coach into an antique yard and to see strangely dressed figures descend from it? And yet this longing for the past and thinking it alone poetic is not a little caused by the strangeness of it. We have now no toga, no Forum and there- fore think it greatly poetic for a man in a toga to be strutting across a Forum. But the poetry of earth depends much also on the mind of man.19 Varied, contradictory, and rapidly changing, the twentieth century was a Pes- soa century. In The Western Canon, Harold Bloom refers to Pessoa not only as the most original poet of the past century, but as one of the twenty-six writers re- sponsible for setting the parameters of literature in the Western world.20 And Pessoa did so as an outsider, as a writer-between-languages. Bowler and top hats have gone out of fashion, black suits and bow ties no longer grace the streets of Lisbon, yet the aura of that ethereal silhouette that was Pessoa lurks around the corner, any corner . . . Great literature, just like na- ture, moves in concentric circles and is ultimately discovered. As guest editors, our ambition will be satisfied if, in these utilitarian days, we have succeeded in putting together a volume that contributes to the enjoyment of and interest in Fernando Pessoa’s bilingual output — one of the literary trea- sures of the past century that is yet to be unearthed. 6 Fernando pessoa as encush reader and writer Ferrari and Pizarro NOTES We wish to express our utmost gratitude to all the contributors of this issue, as well as to Joao Cezar de Castro Rocha, editor-in-chief; to the managing editor, Mario Pereira; to the production editor, Susan Abel; and to the copyeditor, Sara Evangelos. We also ex- tend our acknowledgments to Fatima Lopes and Ligia Maria de Azevedo Martins for al- lowing us to reproduce the images from Pessoa’s archive, and to Susan Margaret Brown for the careful editing of this introduction and the translations of the verses there cited. Last but not least, this issue would not be what it is without the precious help of other professors, friends, and colleagues with whom we share a long companionship with Fernando Pessoa’s works: Helena Buescu, Onesimo Teotonio Almeida, Patrick Quillier, Antonio Cardiello, Paulo de Medeiros, Carmo Mota, and Jose Pires Correia. 1.

Pessoa employed the terms heter- onymismo and heteronym os (without the accent) in the famous letter to Adolfo Casais Monteiro, dated January 13, 1935, in which he revealed to the critic the genesis of the heteronyms (see Espolio/15 [Casais Monteiro’s Archive held at the National Library of Portugal] ; Fernando Pessoa, Cartas entre Fernando Pessoa e os directores da presenga, ed. Enrico Martines [Lisbon: Imprensa Nacional-Casa da Moeda, 1998], 251-59). Note that these categories appeared only in 1928.

Pessoa completely changed the story, however, and partly sub- verted the genre. keywords: boys' books, Barrowby, story papers, dime novels, O Palrador, Durban Fernando Pessoa’s first sustained run of creative writing occurred during the yearlong holiday he spent in Portugal when he was thirteen and fourteen years old.1 Between March and September 1902, he produced over fifteen poems,2 most of which were included in several homemade newspapers, 0 Palrador (The Tattler) and A Palaura (The Word), whose neatly handwritten columns also pre- sented stories, anecdotes, charades, real news, and invented news. All Pessoa’s poems and other writings were in Portuguese — remarkably good Portuguese, when we consider that his schooling in Durban during the previous five and a half years had been in English. The various issues of the 1902 newspapers have been reproduced, partially transcribed, and discussed by Teresa Rita Lopes,3 Darlene Sadlier,4 and others. I will merely mention here that 0 Palrador was the more complex of the two journalistic enterprises. It entailed a large team of fic- titiously named contributors and included the names of equally fictitious editors and staff writers on its masthead. Before his trip to Portugal, Pessoa had written at least one poem in English, “Separated from Thee,”5 and after returning to Durban, in October 1902, he continued to write in English — almost exclusively. Anglophone preheteronyms6 such as David Merrick, Sidney Parkinson Stool, and Charles Robert Anon emerged in 1903. On July n, 1903, in the Natal Mercury, Pessoa published his 15 PORTUGUESE LITERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES first English poem, “The Miner’s Song,” attributed to Karl P. Effield, a preheter- onym supposedly born in Boston.7 And then, out of the blue, in that same month of July, he revived 0 Palrador, which continued to be a strictly Portuguese production, though it now resembled a magazine more than a newspaper. The masthead, in fact, advertised it as a “periodico mensal” (monthly periodical).8 Exactly one year had passed since the last issue, made in Lisbon and dated July 5, 1902, and almost everything about the new series was different. Some of the names on the masthead remained, but their titles and duties had changed. Dr. Pancracio, literary editor of the last 1902 issue, became the pseudonym of a new staff member, Francisco Pau, responsible for the humor section. Pad Ze, for- merly the pseudonym of Pedro da Silva Salles, was now the pen name of Roberto Kola, in charge of riddles. There were nine other editors and subeditors, one handling a sports section and another a short story section. The elaborate edito- rial scaffold was probably conceived with future issues in mind, but these never materialized. Volume 1, Issue 1 of the new 0 Palrador was the only issue. And Pessoa wrote virtually nothing else in Portuguese until he returned to Lisbon for good, in 1905. The Durban issue of 0 Palrador appears to be the only example of Portuguese creative writing produced by Pessoa during the years he spent in South Africa. But upon inspection, it turns out to be a conceptually English production. An introductory editor’s page, signed by Silva Salles, announces the first install- ments of Quatro romances interessantissimos (Four Fascinating Novels ), a series of “pequenos contos militares” (military short stories), and other articles “de bas- tante interesse” (of considerable interest).9 No articles and no army tales were written, and only two of the four promised serial novels commenced “publica- tion.” The most interesting one, Os Rapazes de Barroioby, subtitled Cronica Hu- moristica (Humorous Story) and signed by Adolph Moscow, is about the amusing but also violent interaction of students at a boys’ boarding school in an English town called Barrowby. The first chapter, to which I will return, describes the vil- lage and the school named after it. The second and last chapter of the install- ment narrates the rude reception that three veteran students give to several new arrivals. The story has been the object of differing critical treatments, and I will summarize some of the resulting observations and interpretations before pre- senting hypotheses and conclusions from my own research. Hubert Dudley Jennings, who revealed the existence of the Durban 0 Palra- dor,10 initially reported that the Barrowby School, although fictionally situated 16 FERNANDO PESSOA AS ENGLISH READER AND WRITER Richard Zenith in England, exactly fit the description of Durban High School (dhs), where Pessoa studied from 1899 to 1901 and again in 1904. 11 Jennings subsequently backed off on that assertion, admitting that Pessoa had changed some details and added an astronomical observatory,12 but he continued to view Os Rapazes de Barrowby as an autobiographical transposition. According to his reading, the Barrowby headmaster was a composite of the headmaster of D H s and the direc- tor of the Commercial School (where Pessoa studied in 1903), while the abuse endured by Zacharias, a new Barrowby student who is Jewish, was a caricature of what Fernando himself had endured.13 The Barrowby narrator explains, for his ideal Portuguese reader, several particulars of English boys’ schools, includ- ing the use of boxing as the only respectable form of fighting among students. Though the tradition of fagging — whereby younger schoolboys act as servants (fags) for the older boys — is not explained, it is illustrated by the authoritarian attitude of the older students toward Zacharias and other newcomers. Pessoa’s knowledge and possible firsthand experience of fagging, as revealed by his story, led Yara Frateschi Vieira to propose it as a seed for sadomasochistic scenes in poems such as Alvaro de Campos’s Ode maritima (Maritime Ode).14 Jennings also called attention to Pessoa’s ostensibly Dickensian humor,15 a point focused and expanded on by Antonio Sabler, who argued that the juvenile writer’s love of The Pickwick Papers inspired the comic descriptions of his Barrowby characters.16 Sabler also found puns at work in some of the students’ names, such as Godfrey Slater (“god free is later”) and Donald Dowson (“Donald [wi] dow son”). In the latter name, Sabler posited a linguistic projection of Pessoa’s status as the son of a mother who became a widow when he was five years old.17 In a chapter tracing the development of Pessoa’s interest in physiognomy, phrenology, and other sciences “of the minute” grouped under “microsophy” (a Pessoan coinage), Jeronimo Pizarro offers Barrowby as the first example of a lit- erary text in which the young writer mentions and exploits physiognomy.18 Adolph Moscow, the fictitious author of Barrowby, refers directly to Johann Kas- par Lavater (1741-1801), the pioneering promoter of physiognomy in modern times, in order to justify reading the personalities of the Barrowby schoolboys in their facial features. Blue eyes, for instance, are said to indicate forthright- ness.19 Moscow does not associate Zacharias’s large, stork-like nose with any personality trait, but Pizarro stresses the fact that Pessoa would become espe- cially interested in the physiognomic importance of the nose. Because Pessoa’s partly Jewish heritage was detectable in the shape of his own nose (so one of his 17 PORTUGUESE LITERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES Jewish friends told him in 1913), Pizarro allows for a possible autobiographical connection between Zacharias’s less than warm welcome by veteran Barrowby students and Fernando’s own reception at Durban High School.20 Anibal Frias, after reviewing and critiquing the contributions of the four scholars just named, remarks on the insufficient attention paid to what he con- siders the central theme: “un rituel de praxe entre collegiens” (a ritual of praxis among students).21 Praxis encompasses initiation and other student rituals practiced at Portuguese institutions of higher learning, particularly at the Uni- versity of Coimbra.22 Frias’s discussion of Barrowby is contained in an article on the relationship of Pessoa to Coimbra, but its relevance, as far as I can tell, is tangential. There is a slight connection between Coimbra and 0 Palrador, be- cause Pad Ze (a corruption of “Padre Jose”) — one of the names on the mast- head, as previously noted — was the nickname of Alberto Costa (1877-1908), a law student at the University of Coimbra who became famous for his bohemian extravagance and quick wit. He would publish a best-selling book about his uni- versity days in 1905 and become a militant republican, but he had founded a satirical student magazine, Reirista do Civil, as early as 1899 and achieved some notoriety by the time Pessoa founded 0 Palrador in Lisbon. The Durban issue of 0 Palrador had a “Director Artfstico” (artistic director) whose name, Alberto Rey da Costa, may have been derived from the real name of the Pad Ze from Coim- bra. There is no substantive link, however, between Coimbra and Os Rapazes de Barrowby. According to its fictional setting and to the explicit indications of Adolph Moscow, Barrowby is a story of social behaviors among English high school students. And Frias confirms this, pointing out that the atmosphere, rit- uals, and hierarchical relations are those of a British public school (“public” insofar as they are open to whoever can pay the tuition and fees). He suggests that Barrowby could be a hybrid name combining Harrow and Rugby, two prominent public schools.23 He notes as well that the term newbie (a “new boy” at a public school) might be encoded in the novel’s title, if we translate it into English: The Boys of Barrowby.24 Frias provides a thorough account of how all the Barrowby banter, name calling, and acts of violence fit into the institution of fagging as practiced at British pub- lic schools. He does not speculate on where Pessoa obtained his information — whether through reading or through direct experience — or on what motivated him to mold it into a story. If, as Jennings asserts, the experience was largely au- tobiographical, then that would explain both the source of Pessoa’s knowledge 18 FERNANDO PESSOA AS ENGLISH READER AND WRITER Richard Zenith and his motivation for converting it into literature. The problem is that dhs, back in those days, was a far cry from a British boys’ boarding school such as the one described by Moscow. Only a quarter of the dhs students were boarders; the system of organizing the boys into various “houses” was introduced only in 1902 (one year after Pessoa left the school for Portugal); and testimonies from the period suggest there was not yet any formalized hierarchical division of stu- dents, much less any tradition of fagging or ritualized bullying.25 The Durban 0 Palrador defined itself as a magazine rather than a newspaper, but what sort of magazine did it aim to be? Its format and planned contents — which included military short stories as well as serialized novels such as Os Rapazes de Barrowby — reminded me specifically of the “story papers” or boys’ magazines that became popular in Victorian Great Britain, spread to the United States and elsewhere, and endured until the 1960s. Further, Os Rapazes de Ba r- rotuby struck me as a Pessoan take on a typical boys’ adventure story from the period. It occurred to me that it might actually be a doctored translation from the English, particularly because The Boys o/Barroioby is a likely sounding title, as Frias noticed. On the Internet I quickly discovered a novel with that same title, published serially in forty-seven issues of The Boys’ Friend magazine, beginning in April of 1903. Because it took a month for British publications to reach Durban, Pessoa could have read no more than ten installments (the eleventh was published on June 20) when he began writing his own Portuguese version for 0 Palrador. But how much of The Boys of Barrowby , beyond its title, did Pessoa steal? None of the forty-seven issues of The Boys’ Friend where it was serialized is consultable online, but I managed to obtain a reproduction of the complete novel, published in 1908 as Volume 50 ofThe Boys’ Friend Library.26 Os Rapazes de Barrowby is not a translation or even a remake of the original The Boys o/Barrowby, which was signed by Sidney Drew, a pseudonym of Edgar Joyce Murray. Pessoa preserved the story’s title, its setting, the division of Barrowby School into two rival houses, and the names of certain characters, along with a few of their salient traits, but he radically altered its plot and literary style. Don- ald and Richard Dowson, students and identical twins in Drew’s novel, feature in Pessoa’s as Donald and Ricardo Dowson. A classmate named George Honey becomes Mel, but this is only a nickname, which Moscow explains by noting that the boy has a sweet tooth. Moscow gives Mel’s real name as Henry Ford. (This was a rather precocious nod at the carmaker, who had founded the Ford Motor Company just one month earlier, in June of 1903, and who did not come PORTUGUESE LITERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES out with the Model T until 1908. Pessoa would write about and repeatedly allude to Ford in his adult writings.) Another school chum is called Slater in both sto- ries, but Pessoa endows him with a first name, Godfrey, and a nickname: Gyp. A Chinese student christened Ching-Lung by Drew is inversely called Lung-Hi in Portuguese. He is a Chinese prince in both stories but holds center stage in The Boys of Barrowby, which is subtitled The Story of Ching Lung’s Schooldays. Adult names are also translated. A teacher named Mr. Flint becomes Senhor Pedra, and the screw in Drew’s Admiral Screwhamer is evoked in Pessoa’s Almirante Saca-rolhas (Admiral Corkscrew). The Boys ofBarrowby is full of student pranks and scuffles, with some mention of fags and fagging, but with no scenes of incoming students being subjected to hazing; quite the contrary. Drew’s story opens with the arrival of Ching-Lung, whose social acceptance and integration among his schoolmates is instanta- neous. (He is, after all, a prince.) Os Rapazes de Barroioby is a different story. The second chapter is specifically about the harassment that Mel (Henry Ford), Lung-Hi, and Gyp (Slater) mete out to the large-nosed Jewish boy, whose full name is Zacharias Phumtumpum, and to another youngster named Ralph Tig. Both boys are newcomers to the school and newcomers to the fictional cast of characters, with no corresponding prototypes in the British Ur-story. Zacharias is intimidated but not roughed up, except for a single, ritual punch in the nose; and Ralph, refusing to be intimidated, fights Gyp and gets the better of him. It is possible that Fernando, timid and not at all athletic, was teased by other stu- dents at dhs, and perhaps knocked around by older boys, in which case Ralph may have served as a vehicle for him to get at least some literary revenge. But it seems doubtful that Fernando identified with Zacharias, who is portrayed as a ridiculous specimen of a racist Jewish stereotype. The boy is covered with phony jewelry: three fake diamond and gold rings, a gold-painted tie clasp decorated with a fake emerald, and a fake silver pocket watch.27 If autobiography is at work here, then it is almost surely by way of denial, with Pessoa establishing a distance between his own, considerably diluted Jewishness (ancestors on his father’s side) and the unflattering caricature he draws of a “real” Jew. Whether Pessoa was actually a victim of intimidation and hazing — and there is no concrete evidence to that effect — he would have known about the practices at schools like Harrow and Rugby precisely through his readings of other serial- ized novels for boys. School life, in this juvenile genre, was naturally one of the major themes. And Pessoa, from early on, had the habit of schooling his read- 20 FERNANDO PESSOA AS ENGLISH READER AND WRITER Richard Zenith ers. He used his story, as Frias has pointed out, to expound on some of the tra- ditions of British public schools. Pessoa also used his reinvented Barrowby to convey, or perhaps to show off, his newly acquired awareness of physiognomy. Pizarro is surely right to reckon that this story contains Pessoa’s first reference to this technique for discovering personality. In a small memo book from his Durban years, Pessoa noted the selling price ofLavater’s Essays in Physiognomy at Adams & Co., a Durban book- store that still exists.28 That was probably in late 1903 or 1904 — judging by other notations on the same folio (including a list of characters for the story “The Case of the Science Master” and a signature for Charles Robert Anon) — but per- haps he had leafed through Essays in mid-1903, right before launching into his serial novel. Pessoa-qua-Moscow mentions not only Lavater but also a second physiognomist, an Englishman named Kisch (1821-1843), who is himself a fic- tion. Not only that, but the nonexistent Kisch gets a much more detailed foot- note than Lavater.29 Jorge Luis Borges would no doubt have approved. The first chapter of Pessoa’s serial novel, which has received less critical at- tention than the second, is just as entertaining and stylistically more character- istic. Pessoa, or Adolph Moscow, takes up several pages lamenting how much time and eyesight he has lost poring over atlases, maps, and books in an unsuc- cessful effort to discover the exact whereabouts of the “celebre aldeia de Bar- rowby” (well-known village of Barrowby).30 Not that it really matters, finally, for Moscow is completely indifferent to “se a povoagao de Barrowby se tivesse achado situada na Europa, ou na Asia, ou na Africa, ou na America, ou na Oceania, ou nas profundidades caoticas do inferno dantesco” (whether the village of Bar- rowby is located in Europe, in Asia, in Africa, in America, in Oceania, or in the chaotic depths of Dante’s inferno).31 For the sake of the story, he arbitrarily sup- poses that Barrowby is an English village not far from Brighton, being served by a port town “ao qual chamaremos Lynmouth” (that we will call Lynmouth).32 Contrary to what that “chamaremos” (we will call) suggests, Lynmouth indeed exists on the coast a little west of Brighton. Moscow invents a location for a town about which he knows only the name (Barrowby), and he pretends to invent the name and location of a town about which he knows both things (Lynmouth) . It’s as if Pessoa were already rehearsing his poetics ofjingimento (feigning), whereby even unquestionable reality is feigned or pretended. The narrator’s disdain of geographical detail is not surprising, given the scant attention Pessoa paid to the factual particulars of the many destinations PORTUGUESE LITERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES he imaginatively visited, but Pessoa must have undertaken at least some of the humorously described research to try to locate Barrowby. Without a good gazet- teer at his disposal, he failed to find the village, which is in Lincolnshire County, near Nottingham, and he apparently concluded that Sidney Drew had dreamed up the place name. And he may have concluded correctly. Or, more probably, Drew had heard the name but, like Pessoa, didn’t worry too much about exactly where it was. Drew situates Barrowby near two invented towns called Fapnell and Zetfield,33 and states, in the opening scene, that several Barrowby school- boys “could hear the musical whisper of the River Barrow as it glided towards the sea.”34 There is a River Barrow in Ireland, but none in England, and no river glides by the real village of Barrowby, which is far from the sea. Curiously, Pes- soa would commit his own Barrow error many years later, when he wrote a five-sonnet sequence titled “Barrow-on-Furness” and signed by Alvaro de Cam- pos, who is supposedly gazing at the Furness River while giving poetic expres- sion to his existential anguish. In fact, no such river exists. Furness is a penin- sula, and the correct name of the town is Barrow-in-Furness.35 In the same way that Pessoa, particularly as a developing writer, often used someone else’s poem as his starting point to produce a very different and, with luck, superior poetic composition,36 he took a preexisting serial novel and gut- ted it. He retained the title, some names, and a few structural props; but he shifted the perspective, changed the tone, added a quasi-philosophical pream- ble (if it has no other reality, “a aldeia de Barrowby existira, pelo menos, nesta cronica” [the village of Barrowby will exist at least in this story], Moscow as- sures us37), delineated the characters with the aid of physiognomy, and inserted learned footnotes about this dubious science and other matters. A simple story relying on slapstick humor acquires, in Pessoa’s transformation, an erudite narrator with vaguely sociological as well as philosophical pretensions. It is a largely tongue-in-cheek performance, however, written to entertain, and in the end it even resorts to a classic gag, with Gyp taking a calamitous slide on a ba- nana peel. Various scholars, as noted earlier, have looked at Os Rapazes de Barrowby from contrasting points of view, affording us a critical picture of reasonable complex- ity. I hope to have elucidated a few points as well, but we may all be at risk of overinterpreting. Pessoa, after all, was going for laughs, and he probably had a specific audience in mind: his immediate family. After “The Miner’s Song” was printed in early July 1903, it is likely that Pessoa’s parents, while enthusiastically 22 FERNANDO PESSOA AS ENGLISH READER AND WRITER Richard Zenith congratulating him, also encouraged him to keep up his creative writing in Portuguese, perhaps reminding him of the mock newspapers he had created in Lisbon (0 Palrador) and the Azores (A Palaura). Whatever it was that prompted Fernando to produce another issue of 0 Palrador, he must have shown it to his parents and siblings, for he used several blank pages in the middle of the in-progress periodical to keep score for a parlor game in which they all partici- pated. Called “Derby,” the game mimicked the Durban July Handicap, held on the first Saturday of that month. The July Handicap was and is South Africa’s premier horse race. “Derby,” played with dice, was Fernando’s invention.38 The family members were assigned different-colored horses, mounted by jockeys with names such as Clumsy Dick, Yreka Jim, and Tom Wallis.39 The last of these names belongs to the protagonist of Tom Wallis: A Tale of the South Seas, a boys’ adventure book published by Louis Becke in 1900. Yreka Jim is the protagonist of Yreka Jim: The Gold-Gatherer, Yreka Jim of Yuba Dam, and several other serialized boys’ books. In an autobiographical text probably written in 1907, Pessoa wrote (in Eng- lish), “The earliest literary food of my childhood was in the numerous novels of mystery and of horrible adventure. Those books which are called boys’ books and deal with exciting experiences I cared little for. With a healthy and natural life I was out of sympathy. My craving was not for the probable, but for the in- credible, not even for the impossible by degree, but for the impossible by na- ture.” Pessoa went on to say that he recognized in himself from an early age “an inborn tendency to mystification, to artistic lying.”40 This confessed tendency was acted on in the same text, because the writer falsely claims to have been uninterested in boys’ books. In fact, Sidney Drew’s The Boys of Barrowby fits squarely in the genre, and allusions to characters such as Yreka Jim and Tom Wallis suggest that he read many other similar works, both in book form and in juvenile periodicals such as The Boys’ Friend. There is no evidence that Pessoa preferred novels “of horrible adventure.” And wasn’t his favorite novel, The Pick- wick Papers, a kind of boys’ book for grown-ups? The other serial novel partially written for 0 Palrador is titled Os Milhoes dum doido (A Madman’s Millions) and signed by Marvell Kisch (a descendant of Kisch, the fictitious physiognomist?). The first and only chapter produced describes a snowy night in an aristocratic neighborhood of London, where two wealthy women — one older, one younger — exit their mansion to enter a fancy coach, at which point they are accosted by a beggar, with a baby in her arms, whom they PORTUGUESE LiTERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES haughtily rebuff. Jennings senses the influence of Bleak House in this sad wintry scene,41 but to me, the story reads suspiciously like a Portuguese translation of the opening pages of yet another English boys’ book, or possibly a girls’ book. In Os Rapazes de Barroiuby, we can feel that Pessoa’s Portuguese is occasionally contaminated by English syntax;42 in Os Milhdes we find entire sentences directly imported from English: for instance, “Eles discutiam a advisibilidade de ter bife com cebolas para a ceia”43 (They were discussing the advisability of having steak and onions for supper). It is conceivable that Pessoa was mocking the “lofty” tone found in a certain register of English speech, but it was unlike him to portray narrative scenes with so much carefully coordinated physical detail. The third and fourth novels promised by the editor in 0 Palrador’s prefatory note to readers — Em Dias de Per igo (In Days of Danger) by Gabriel Keene, and ALuta Aerea (The Aerial Fight) by Sableton Kay — may also have been inspired by British (or American) models, a supposition bolstered by the English-sounding names of their unreal authors. Despite a certain appetite for the literature of story pa- pers and dime novels (to be succeeded, in his adult years, by crime novels), Pes- soa had no interest in or talent for writing effective but commonplace descrip- tions of rich nobles in their well-cushioned coaches and poor people shivering in the cold on snowy winter nights. His inclination, conspicuous in his spin-off ofThe Barrowby Boys — and in keeping with the thesis of “adverse,” or subverted, genres recently advanced by K. David Jackson — was to transgress the traditional rules and expectations of storytelling. Fernando had no qualms about filching a few ideas, characters, and even entire sentences from British serial novels, but an aesthetic if not ethical scruple seems to have prevented him from signing his own name to the stories that re- sulted from his borrowings. Though they were written in Portuguese, he pre- ferred to attribute their authorship to Active Englishmen such as Adolph Mos- cow and Marvell Kisch. (The two first names are English, and a few Durbanites were surnamed Kisch, as I discovered by consulting The Natal Alamanac, Directory and Yearly Register for 1897 through 1905.) It was as if counterfeit authorship served, paradoxically, as a seal of authenticity for the writing itself, with Pessoa acting as the translator of what Moscow and Kisch purportedly authored. How- ever much he reworked or reinvented them, Pessoa’s serialized novels belonged to an Anglo-American genre, a fact he apparently wished to emphasize. And per- haps he did not want his own name to be associated with the tradition of boys’ 24 FERNANDO PESSOA AS ENGLISH READER AND WRITER Richard Zenith books — a tradition he seemed to disdain in the aforecited autobiographical text written just four years later, in 1907. Whatever their inspiration, Moscow and Kisch are atypical of Pessoa’s pseu- doauthors. Even though Moscow has a definite narrative posture that affects the tone and framing of his story, it is perhaps better not to count him or Kisch as heteronyms, preheteronyms, or fictitious personalities.44 They were one-offs, without biographical substance, whose narrative existence began and ended with their respective stories. NOTES 1. Pessoa arrived at Durban, South Africa, in February of 1896 with his mother, who had recently married Portugal’s consul to that city. It was there that Pessoa lived and stud- ied until July of 1901, when he embarked with his new family — which included children by the second marriage — for an extended holiday in Portugal, where they arrived in Au- gust. He returned to Durban on his own, a few months after the rest of the family, in Oc- tober of 1902, and stayed there until August of 1905 , when he made his final, month-long voyage back to Lisbon, where he enrolled in the Curso Superior de Letras. He completed his studies at Durban High School (Form VI) in December of 1904. See Alexandrino E. Severino, Fernando Pessoa na Africa do Sul (Lisbon: D. Quixote, 1983) and Jennings, Os dots exilios: Fernando Pessoa na Africa do Sul (Oporto: Centro de Estudos Pessoanos & Fundagao Eng.° Antonio de Almeida, 1984) for detailed information on Pessoa’s Durban years. 2. Eighteen poems from this period — all written in Portuguese — can be found in Pessoa, Obra essencial de Fernando Pessoa, Vol. 2, ed. R. Zenith (Lisbon: Assirio & Alvim, 2006), 455-68, but it might make more sense to classify one of them, “Enigma,” as a rhymed riddle rather than a bonafide poem.

The original manuscript of the Campos sonnets has been lost, and it is quite possible that Pessoa’s posthumous publishers (Poesias de Aluaro de Campos, Lisbon: Atica, 1944) misread “in-Furness” or miscorrected it to “on-Furness.” Indeed, “Barrow-in- Furness” is correctly spelled on a surviving publication plan drawn up by Pessoa (BNP / E3 , 87-953) as well as in an open letter (with replies to a literary survey) signed by Alvaro de Campos — who refers to the time he spent in Barrow-in-Furness — and published in A Informafao, a Lisbon newspaper, in 1926. But the geographical mistake remains. However Pessoa spelled the name of the town, references in the sonnets indicate that he believed Furness to be a river that flowed past it. See also George Monteiro, Fernando Pessoa and Nineteenth-Century Anylo-American Literature (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2000), 33-35- 36. In 1902, for instance, he wrote the sonnet “Antigona,” whose title was inspired by a letter of Shelley, and whose verses were a kind of “correction” of Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s sonnet “How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.” See Zenith, “A Sonnet from the English — Fernando Pessoa: ‘Antigona’” (2013), 169-75. 37. BNP/E3, i44R-3v; Pessoa, Cadernos, I, 72. 38. Jennings, Os dois exilios, 114-15. 39.

It is possible that the cited passage is autobiographical of Alexander Search rather than of Pessoa. Although the passage is not exactly signed by Search, his signature appears more than once in a corner of the manuscript, suggesting that Pessoa — who often practiced his heteronymic sig- natures in the margins of his texts — was in Search mode, or mood. Search’s personality traits, though based on Pessoa’s, were fewer in number and more sharply defined, more 27 PORTUGUESE LITERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES accentuated. On October 2, 1907, Search signs a pact with the devil (BNP/E3, 20-93; Pessoa, Paninas intimas, 10), something Pessoa would surely not do in his own name, and one could argue that it was he — not Pessoa himself— who claimed to be attracted to mys- tery and horror in literature. 41.

In a text datable to some time after 1923 and probably intended for a preface to his heteronymic works, Pessoa used the term “personalidades ficticias” to signify the imaginary playmates and alter egos he began inventing already as a child (BNP/E3 , 20-74; Pessoa, Teona da heterommia [Lisbon: Assirio & Alvim, 2012], 231).

Conversely, the memory and reception of Pessoa in South Africa have been slight, sustained by only a few individuals. By contextualizing Pessoa’s place- ment in the historically peculiar Natal Colony, and by reading some early work by Pessoa's English literary persona Charles Robert Anon against the backdrop of the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902), this article adds to the emergent understanding of the Durban years as deeply formative for Pessoa's work. It is here, not least, that we can trace the early formation of the imperial view of history that also becomes a strange limitation to his thinking.The “empire\" as a frame of reference, an object of desire, a cause for ridicule, and a lofty ideal, recurs repeatedly in Pessoa’s writing, and even when Anon expresses severe criticism of British imperial conduct, he re- mains beholden to an imperial optic, almost by default restricted to a white outlook on events in southern Africa. We find thereby in the early work the makings of an imperial ambivalence that is then dispersed and refracted through multiple poetic voices in Pessoa’s oeuvre. keywords: Fernando Pessoa, Charles Robert Anon, Roy Campbell, Natal Colony, Anglo-Boer War, imperialism This article is written under the shadow of a double elusiveness. One concerns the traces of Fernando Pessoa in South Africa, the other the traces of South Af- rica in Fernando Pessoa. To what extent, we must ask ourselves, do the two cross paths in a meaningful way? The external facts are familiar enough: after his mother remarried, Pessoa’s family settled in Durban, where his stepfather worked in the Portuguese consu- late. Between 1896 and 1905, young Fernando would live in this subtropical coastal town, with a population of under 30,000 at the time. He attended, fa- mously, Durban High School (dhs), a boys’ school founded in 1866. At the age 30 FERNANDO PESSOA AS ENGLISH R E ADE R A N D WR ITE R Stefan HelgeSSOH of seventeen, having failed to secure an Oxford scholarship, Pessoa returned to Portugal, where he lived for the remaining thirty years of his life.1 In other words, Pessoa the individual intersects with South Africa during the most impressionable years of any young person’s life. And yet a common im- pression has been that little remains of this experience, both in public memory in South Africa and in the work of Pessoa himself. The poet Roy Campbell (1901-1957), probably the first of the few South Africans who have publicized Pessoa’s significance as a poet to an English-speaking audience, even saw this period as completely immaterial to Pessoa’s work: “His ten years in Durban, where he learnt the English language so well, that he had no trace of a colonial accent, and where he stripped most of the school-prizes from his British colo- nial competitors, left absolutely no trace on his writings except that he corre- sponded for twenty years with his friend, Mr. Ormond.”2 Campbell was himself a Durbanite and a dhs boy, and some of the most evocative passages in his sketch ofPessoa’s life concern his own recollections of early twentieth-century Durban. He remembers that the name “F. Pessoa” was carved into the lid of his own desk at dhs, and waxes nostalgic about the city of yore: Nowhere in the world were there more beautiful gardens, though most of the houses had ugly corrugated iron roofs. In those days, each house reposed amidst several acres of fruit trees and flowers. Flowering trees, Jacaranda, Tulip-trees, Flame-trees, Golden Shower, Flamboyants, Kaffirboom (the most brilliant of all) and Mimosa succeed each other throughout the year (like phoenixes taking fire from each others ashes) to culminate in the gor- geous blaze of the winter-flowering Kaffirboom [a contentious name; now it is called “coral tree”]. As the Pessoas were neighbours of ours, on the Berea, they must have had a house and garden very much like ours.3 This is about as close as we will get to the sensuous immediacy of young Pessoa’s surroundings in Durban. In his own work, “impersonal” from the be- ginning, the city is mostly filtered out, displaced, or transcoded, hence lending credence to the perception that Durban left no, or at least very few, traces on his writing. (A rare exception would be the late poem “Un Soir a Lima,” with its powerful evocation of a domestic interior in Durban.)4 Against this, given not only our more detailed and thorough understanding ofPessoa’s oeuvre today, but also a greater preparedness to think outside the 3i PORTUGUESE LITERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES boxes of national and European literary historiography, one could list a number of general as well as specific reasons that the Durban years should be granted prominence in Pessoa scholarship. The first and most obvious is the reason men- tioned by Campbell: the persistence of the English language throughout Pes- soa’s life. He corresponded with English journals, published poetry in English, and continued above all to write and read in English. As George Monteiro and Irene Ramalho Santos, among others, have shown, the importance of English- language poetry in Pessoa’s work, from Shakespeare to Walt Whitman, can hardly be overstated.5 Even in Pessoa’s Lusophone poetry — for instance, Alvaro de Campos’s Ode maritima and “Ultimatum” — English words and phrases ap- pear. It is barely conceivable that this intellectual commerce with the Anglo- phone world would have occurred without those childhood years in Durban. In a similar vein, it may be argued that Pessoa would never have become Pessoa without the migrant experience of being a Portuguese child in exile, edu- cated in the most excessively British, colonial part of southern Africa, not just at the peak of the British high-imperial period, but also during the dramatic years of the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902). The very conservative brand of Britishness of the Natal Colony, which contrasts both with the white liberalism of the Cape Colony and the Afrikanerdom of Transvaal and the Orange Free State, should be highlighted in this context. If the colonial histories of other parts of South Africa had been rather checkered, and the boom town of Johannesburg (founded in 1886) was rapidly becoming a cosmopolitan metropolis, the Natal Colony — where segregationist policies were implemented very early — was staunchly and self-consciously a part of the British Empire.6 It is for good reason that Pieter- maritzburg, the administrative capital of Natal (and of KwaZulu-Natal today), 70 kilometers inland from Durban, bears the popular slogan “the last outpost of the empire.”7 If what passed for “English” identity in much of South Africa took shape against the Boer (or Afrikaner) other, in Natal it was mainly the Zulu na- tion that provided a foil for Englishness. Add to this the fact that South Africa was formed as a political union only in 1910, after Pessoa’s departure. In other words, it was a very specific, and specifically English, colonial African setting that Pessoa entered as a child. Here we can trace the early formation of the imperial view of history that is so prominent in his work and, in its way, also becomes a strange limitation to his thinking. The empire as a frame of reference, an object of desire, a cause for ridicule, and a lofty ideal, would recur again and again in his writing. This is 32 FERNANDO PESSOA AS ENGLISH READER AND WRITER Stefan HelgeSSOH commonly read as a poetic conceit serving to promote the notion of an “empire of culture” rather than “actual” imperialism, but the historical basis of Pessoa’s rarefied idea of empire cannot be ignored.8 In notes that he prepared for Men- sacjem (Message), for example, he states the following: “Foi a civilizagao moderna creada pela concentragao e europeizagao da alma antiga, e isso foi obra da Italia; pela abertura de todas as portas do mundo, e o descobrimento d’elle, e isso foi a obra de Portugal; e pela restituigao da idea de Grande Imperio, e isso foi obra de Inglaterra. Tudo o mais e de segunda ordem.” (Modern civilization was cre- ated by the concentration and Europeanization of the spirit of antiquity, which was the achievement of Italy; by the discovery of the world and the opening of all its harbors, which was done by Portugal; and by the restitution of the idea of the Grand Empire, which was achieved by England. Whatever remains is of a sec- ond order.)9 This emphasis on a European — and particulary English and Portuguese — imperial history as a keystone of modern civilization is foreshadowed, refracted, and reformulated across Pessoa’s unruly oeuvre. We recognize it in his mus- ings in Metisagem and elsewhere about Portugal as the “Fifth Empire” (after “Greece, Rome, Christianity and Europe”);10 but also, in Alvaro de Campos’s wild (to say the least) diatribe against all of contemporary Europe and the Amer- icas in his 1917 “Ultimatum,”11 the imperial frame of reference structures much of the poem, mainly to lament the lack of imperial grandeur in contemporary Europe: Tu, ambigao italiana, cao de collo chamado Cesar! [. • •] Tu, organizagao britannica, com Kitchener12 no fundo do mar desde o principio da guerra! [. .

[. . .] You, British organization, with Kitchener in the bottom of the sea from the beginning of the war! You, German culture, putrid Sparta with oil of Christianity and vinegar of Nietzscheanisation, tin-can beehive, imperialoid trangression of misguided servility! [...] Not a single grand idea, nor a complete notion or imperial ambition of the born emperor! Not a single idea of a structure, no sense of an Edifice, no longing for Organic-Creation! Not even a small Pitt, not even a cardboard Goethe, not even a Nuremburg Napoleon!)13 Even South Africa — through the imperial mediation of Kipling — enjoys a brief, derogatory mention in “Ultimatum”: “Fora tu, mercadoria Kipling, homem- practico do verso, imperialista das sucatas, epico para Majuba e Colenso, Empi- re-Day do calao das fardas, tramp-steamer da baixa immortalidade!” (Out with you, you merchant-like Kipling, practical-man of poetry, pig-iron imperialist, epic bard of Majuba and Colenso, Empire-Day of the slang of the uniforms, tramp-steamer of base immortality! [Majuba and Colenso were the sites of two Anglo-Boer battles]). Pessoa’s early work from his South African years helps us notice the very ma- trix of this imperial thinking. To substantiate this, let us look briefly at a small set of early texts: his 1905 letter to the Natal Mercury, the sonnets that accompa- nied this letter, and the newly discovered fragmentary poem “Steal, Steal, Steal” dated 1906. Pessoa was at this time experimenting with the literary persona Charles Robert Anon, who would later merge with Alexander Search. The latter would become Pessoa’s most prominent Anglophone persona, but critics today agree that Search emerged after the Durban years; the first evidence we have of his name dates from 1906. 14 The letter to the Natal Mercury is signed Charles Robert Anon, and although the accompanying sonnets in manuscript form ex- tant in Pessoa’s archive bear the name Alexander Search, this is a later addi- 34 FERNANDO PESSOA AS ENGLISH READER AND WRITER Stefan HelgeSSOH tion. There is another minor equivocation: in the letter, Anon says that he is attaching three sonnets, but there are four sonnets that clearly belong together thematically — two of them called “To England.” I will treat all four as connected to the concerns expressed in the letter. Despite the lack of an explicit reference to the Russo-Japanese War (1904- 1905), we can safely assume that this is what prompted Pessoa/Anon to express his dissatisfaction in July 1905: “I have been somewhat astonished, in the pe- rusal of the ‘Natal Mercury,’ and especially of your column, to perceive how meanly, and in what slavish way, sarcasm and irony are heaped on the Russians, on their army, and on their Emperor.”15 His complaint concerns, above all, the lack of tact and delicacy in the face of another’s defeat, and a concomitant refusal to realize that “grief and misery en- noble.” This compassionate and humanistic rejoinder is nonetheless combined with the Realpolitik of geopolitical considerations: “It is quite clear, I believe, that our hearty amusement may be constructed [sic], not even by one malicious, into a joy from the relief we now have from fears of an Indian disturbance. Rus- sia does not now threaten our Eastern possession; and is it therefore that we laugh?”16 It was indeed the case that Japan, which emerged victorious from the war, had been allied with Britain, and that Russia was a contender in the “Great Game” of imperial rule in Asia. Anon’s complaint is in that respect motivated and even perceptive, but what is particularly interesting is the speaking position that he constructs for himself in the letter. Anon speaks unequivocally of “us, Englishmen” and the mention of India as “our Eastern possession” is hardly ironic. The problem is certain attitudes and the conduct of the British, not the British Empire or imperial ambitions. In this respect, Pessoa/Anon seems typical of his time: another European foreigner in the British Empire, Joseph Conrad, would similarly voice criticism of colonial conduct, but without questioning the imperial system.17 More important, Pessoa, with Anon as his mouthpiece, is displaying how powerful the interpellation of British imperial subjects in Dur- ban could be. Even as a Portuguese child, Pessoa’s schooling enabled him to identify (and made him want to identify) as English. These observations are borne out by the sonnets and the poem “Steal, Steal, Steal.” As mentioned, two of the sonnets bear the title “To England”; the other two are called “Joseph Chamberlain” and “Liberty.”18 Geopolitically, only one of the “To England” sonnets concerns itself directly with the Russo-Japanese 35 PORTUGUESE LITERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES War: “Our enemies are fallen; other hands / Than ours have struck them, and our joy is great / To know that now at length our fears abate / From hint and menace on great Eastern lands.”19 The other three either speak idealistically in the abstract of the conduct of nations and men, or move closer to home by thematizing aspects of the Anglo-Boer War. In “Liberty,” we read, Oh, sacred Liberty, dear mother of Fame! What are men here that they should expel thee? What right of theirs, save power, makes others be The pawns, as if unfeeling, in their game? Ireland and the Transvaal, ye are a shame On England and a blot! Oh, shall we see For ever crushed and held who should be free By human creatures without human name?20 And “Joseph Chamberlain” begins like this: “Their blood on thy head, whom the Afric waste / Saw struggling, puppets with unwilful hand, / Brother and brother: their bought souls shall brand / Thine own with horrors. [. . .]”21 Fi- nally, the rediscovered unfinished poem is also locally inflected and no less harsh in its judgement: Steal, steal, steal Wherefore are ye strong Steal, steal, steal The weak are ever wrong Englishmen remember all The example your nation doth deal Scotland, Ireland, the Transvaal Many a land [ ] So steal, steal, steal! Wherefore strength if not to oppress Wherefore might if not to make distress Wherefore [ ] So, men of England, continue your work And steal, steal, steal! 22 36 FERNANDO PESSOA AS ENGLISH READER AND WRITER Stefan HelgeSSOH if*. . . /&\\ #• s* ..&4Ci 7&e Im A&, ^ y ' dgttr i u/l'l-A^Z^) 7%£~ A'.

How should we assess these instances of rhetorical accusatio against Britain? It is evident, first, that Pessoa/Anon is animated more by the Anglo-Boer War of 1899-1902 than the Russo-Japanese War. This is hardly surprising, given Pessoa’s geographical positioning. The Anglo-Boer had been a moment of deep crisis for the British Empire and a Pyrrhic victory — in retrospect, the first decisive turning 37 PORTUGUESE LITERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES point in the empire’s fortunes. Although it deserves repeating that Pessoa’s Dur- ban years coincided with the high point of empire, we see how the poems also register the seismic shock of this crisis. If colonial propaganda, predictably, supported the war, as the stepson of a Portuguese consul, Pessoa would also have been exposed to the more common continental European perception that this was an unjust act of aggression against a small, freedom-loving people (i.e., the Boers).23 The lines “Ireland and the Transvaal, ye are a shame / On England and a blot!” convey thereby the damage wrought by the war on the image of the British Empire. Irish volunteers had fought on the Boer side, identifying not with the Afrikaner ambition to maintain a quasi-feudal racist order, but with the nationalist David struggling against the imperialist British Goliath. There was indeed little doubt, even on the British side, that the annexation of Transvaal had to do with anything other than economic interest. The conflict had been preceded by the infamous Jameson raid, a failed attempt in 1895 to take control of Johannesburg and the Transvaal. It had not directly involved Bri- tish troops, but the scheme had been devised by a group of influential British politicians and capitalists (most prominent among them Cecil Rhodes) and was aimed at provoking an interstate conflict. We know today, of course, that not only was the raid carried out with the tacit blessing of Joseph Chamberlain — then British secretary of state for the colonies — but its ultimate outcome would be the outbreak of the war in October 1899. 24 We begin to see, in other words, how the poems draw on a web of contempo- rary political references, all of them emerging from a British imperial frame of reference, but that they do so with a critical purpose. Chamberlain is likened to a puppet-master, and British aggression is seen in terms of naked power poli- tics: “Wherefore strength if not to oppress.” Articulating such criticism while adopting a fully English persona and mastering the meters and rhythms of Eng- lish"
