        "text": "Uchechukwu started to study in sculpture in 1990 at the Art Academy of the University of Port Harcourt. He obtained his degree in 1996, and directly afterwards continued study in what is now his current profession, photography. In his work, Uchechukwu melts together the reproduction of common reality with the creative 'language' of the imagination, whereby he extends the possibilities of photography and is giving a new direction to local art.\n\nHe is cofounder of Depth of Field (DOF), a collective of photographers and artist painters. He took the initiative himself by bringing together six talented young photographers. He organized several exhibitions of their work in Nigeria as well as abroad. Furthermore he teaches photography by giving seminars and workshops.\n\nIn 2004 presented a series of award winning photo's on butcher's shops in the open air in Lagos, with the name Fire, Flesh and Blood. The photo series initially had a documentary character, but got the public's attentions as well because of its artistic m√©lange of colorful and smokey close-ups. The 2008 jury of the Prince Claus Fund describes the photo series as intense, cru, powerful and poetic."
