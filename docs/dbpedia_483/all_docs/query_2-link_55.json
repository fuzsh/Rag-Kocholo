        "text": "By\n\nStephen Forsha-sforsha@gmail.com\n\nThe 2011 NBA Draft can be summed up like this: A lot of very good to wait-and-see players, with a lot of teams making trades, mixed in with many foreign players where I'm going to need Rosetta Stone to properly pronounce their names.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers had the No. 1 pick and drafted Duke freshman Kyrie Irving, so maybe he'll help lessen the sting a former king left last offseason. Irving's a very good player, but the Cavs should have drafted Derek Williams who went No. 2 to the Minnesota Timberwolves. My prediction is Williams will be a better NBA player, maybe the best in this draft.\n\nAfter the first two picks, who were described are \"sure things,\" 58 more players were selected to NBA teams for a total of 60 new players trying to make an NBA roster next season.\n\nPlayers were drafted who I was familiar with. Players were drafted who some of us might know, maybe not all of us. Then there were players where, at least in my case, I thought \"Who in the H-E-double hockey sticks is that?\"\n\n\"How do you say his name?\"\n\n\"Where is that country?\"\n\n\"I should have paid more attention in geography.\"\n\n\"I need a globe.\"\n\nEven the commissioner and deputy commish had to look, pause and give it the ol' college try with some of the names. I kinda felt bad for them, but really I didn't.\n\nHere are some of the \"bests\" of the draft.\n\nBest Moment: Twin brothers Markieff and Marcus Morris of Kansas were drafted 13th and 14th to the Phoenix Suns and Houston Rockets, respectively. When Marcus (the younger twin by seven minutes) was asked what it will be like not playing basketball on the same team as his brother anymore, he said: \"I'll send him some flowers or some fruit.\"\n\nBest Story: Chicago drafting Jimmy Butler from Marquette. His life story resembles Michael Oher's of the movie \"The Blind Side.\" He was homeless at 13, had no family, and another family brought him in when nobody gave him a chance.\n\nThe story can be better explained by ESPN's Chad Ford. Click here to read about his life journey.\n\nBest Name: And the winner is … Chukwudiebere Maduabum from Nigeria, who was drafted by the L.A. Lakers. Ummm … I can't pronounce the name either, but ESPN got it right a couple times, and even Stuart Scott said it was a cool name.\n\nHere are the runners-up for best name, which would have the potential for massive amounts of money in the proper name category on \"Wheel of Fortune\": Jonas Valanciunas (Raptors), Bismack Biyombo (Kings), Donatas Motiejunas (Timberwolves, traded to Rockets), Bojan Bogdanovic (Heat, traded to Timberwolves) and Targuy Ngombo (Mavericks).\n\nI would like to solve the puzzle.\n\nBest Name that has already been in the NBA: This goes to Washington's Isaiah Thomas, who was drafted 60th (the last pick) by the Sacramento Kings. The original Isiah Thomas (no relation) was a two-time NBA champion with the Detroit Pistons, but an awful head coach with the New York Knicks. This Isaiah Thomas got his name because his dad lost a bet when Isaiah was born, and that is the tale on how the NBA got another Isaiah Thomas.\n\nBest Jeff Van Gundy Quote: When asked about one of the players who was drafted from overseas, the former NBA coach and current color commentator said, \"I can't help you … I've never heard of him.\"\n\nNow that is great TV. He even had his smart person glasses on. I liked the honesty because he'd be lying if he said he knew anything about him because well …. nobody did, except for maybe one person.\n\nBest Kiss: Did you see Jan Vesely get a lip lock from his lady friend? I thought for a second ESPN might have had to make the draft TV-14. But the best part was the reaction from the group of announcers, complimenting him for his choice in women. That kiss would win the best kiss award at the MTV Movie Awards if it was eligible. But it had nothing on Al and Tipper Gore's kiss from his 2000 campaign. Again, made for good TV.\n\nBest Moment for a UK Fan: When the Toronto Raptors passed on drafting Brandon Knight. If he would have gone to Toronto, I was going to have to rework my Top 3 Things/People in or from Canada list. I have a self-imposed rule about this type of thing, and I think I was going to have to say goodbye to the Mounties off my list because I can't part ways with Canadian bacon and Patrick (Roy) Waaaaaah!\n\nBy the way, Knight went to the Pistons at No. 9, so yes, to answer the question by Al Michaels from 1980 … I do believe in miracles because I don't have to change my list.\n\nBest Non-Draft NBA Story of the Day: The Los Angeles Times reported Ron Artest spent the day filing papers to change his name legally to … get this … \"Metta World Peace.\" This is real stuff, it is on the LA Times Lakers blog.\n\nThat means he could possible have \"World Peace\" on the back of his jersey next season. That makes Ochocinco seem so …. 2009.\n\nBesides the best things, here are some other moments from the draft that are Facebook status worthy.\n\nPlayer I'm Excited to Watch: Enes Kanter (Jazz). I say this because he was screwed out of playing in the NCAA this past season for Kentucky, so yes, I want to see what this 19-year-old kid is all about. He's 6-11, 260 pounds, with a 7-2 wingspan and 9-2 reach. He's said to have a high basketball IQ, good rebounding and can pass the ball.\n\nSitting here with my iced coffee at one in the morning makes me realize just how much UK lost out on by not having him on the court this past season. That team reached the Final Four … ah, what could have been … what could have been, then eventually taken away by the NCAA later on due to rules infractions.\n\nMost Intriguing Pick: That has to go to Jimmer Fredette, who was drafted at No. 10 by the Milwaukee Bucks, but was traded to the Kings in one of the 1,000 or so trades of the night.\n\nHe can shoot the ball, and I'm guessing he'll be a good role player in the NBA. He won't be a superstar, but if he can get open and shoot a three-ball, he'll be a quality player. Let's just say he'll be more productive than Adam \"I have more NBA championship rings than Karl Malone, Charles Barkley, John Stockton and Patrick Ewing combined which should make every NBA fan sick to their stomach\" Morrison and J.J. Redick.\n\nInterview I Could Have Done Without: Though there were a few, I'm picking the one with Spike Lee and his assessment on his New York Knicks draft pick. He might have front row seats to every game, be rich, own many authentic jerseys and make good movies, but the draft wasn't \"He Got Game.\"\n\nI'm even a fan of the movie, and Ray Allen, who played Jesus Shuttlesworth, should have gone to Big State. That could be my favorite basketball movie, ever. OK, list time. Here are my Top 5 basketball movies:\n\n1. \"He Got Game\"\n\n2. \"Hoosiers\"\n\n3. \"Semi-Pro\"\n\n4. \"Teen Wolf\"\n\n5. \"Space Jam.\"\n\nNever making that list will be \"Eddie,\" any \"Air Bud\" movie and \"The Air Up There.\" \"Celtic Pride\" almost made both lists.\n\nLee was right, though, the Knicks do need help on the defensive side of the ball.\n\nLate Draft Sleeper Pick: Ohio State's Jon Diebler was drafted 51st overall by the Portland Trailblazers. Since there are 60 picks, that goes into the \"should've bought a 5 Hour Energy and been more alert because he should have been in Top 45 drafted\" category. He'll be a big-time three-point threat in the NBA.\n\nSurprised Player Not Drafted: Again, let's go back to Ohio State and David Lighty. There is no way he wasn't one of the Top 60 players eligible in the draft. Right?\n\nPlayers like Ater Majok who went to the Lakers, who will probably never come to the NBA, were drafted, but a quality player in Lightly wasn't, and that just doesn't add up to me. I guess it was good for him because now he has a choice to see where he has the best opportunity to play.\n\nTrust me, I don't like defending anyone from Ohio State.\n\nPutting Words in Their Mouths: When Irving was drafted No. 1 by the Cavs, Williams gave him a hug and said something in his ear. Here is what I think happened: Williams who was probably giddy (like a kid on Christmas for dodging Cleveland) on the inside said to Irving \"Thanks, Man.\"\n\nLooks like Irving is taking his talents to Northern Ohio. Poor guy. Williams was drafted by Minnesota at No. 2, and possibly, ever so faintly I might have heard Irving (maybe it was Nelson Muntz from \"The Simpsons\") yelling \"HA! HA!\" in Williams' direction.\n\nA UFO Sighting or Rare Occurrence: Klay Thompson (Washington State) was drafted by the Golden State Warriors, and when that happened, he became the fifth player in history to be drafted in the first round where their father was a former No. 1 pick. His father, Mychal Thompson, was drafted overall No. 1 by the Blazers in 1978. He won three rings with the Lakers in the '80s.\n\nLaugh Out Loud Moment: When NBA Commissioner David Stern, who was booed every time he stepped up to the podium, told the fans the 30th and final pick of the first round, again, while being booed, he waved and said something to the effect of \"Thanks for that.\" I thought it was better than NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's response in April during the NFL Draft where he said something like \"I know, I know.\" I think he enjoys being booed.\n\nConfusing Draft: There were nine different trades made on Thursday, so yes, I'm still confused as to who went where. I'm pretty sure 18 teams were involved in the trades, with three three-team deals. Maybe we'll see if any of these guys can make an impact next season … unless there is a lockout in basketball too.\n\nI'm going to need some bolt cutters.\n\nStephen Forsha is the sports editor of The Highland County Press.
