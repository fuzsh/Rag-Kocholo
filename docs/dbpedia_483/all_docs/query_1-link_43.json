        "text": "The Management of Warri Wolves has expressed dismay with the decision of OD of the Nigeria Football Federation which ordered for a replay of the 45 minutes left in the botched match with Akwa United and has decided to appeal.\n\nBriefing Journalists in Warri after the news filtered in, the Media Officer, Moses Etu said they were not really surprised with the decision. Etu said all the Clubs were given a copy of the rules governing the League and those who have erred in the past have been punished but wondered why the OD took that decision.\n\nAccording to Etu, the game of Football is run by the rules and not sentiments all over the World.\n\n“We are aware of that decision but it did not come to us as a surprise because if you look at all those in that Committee, you will understand. However, we have paid the Five Hundred Thousand Naira for the appeal because we believe that the right thing should be done. Football should not be run by sentiments but by the rules.\n\nThe League Management Committee saddled with the responsibility of running the League gave all the Clubs a copy of the rules and as a responsible Club; we believe that all should abide by it. You cannot use the rules for some and exempt some. It will not augur well for the round leather game and we stand to condemn that decision. It is our view that it cannot stand the test of time.”\n\nEtu also used the opportunity to inform all stake holders that Warri Wolves has passed a vote of no confidence on Effiong Johnson who is supposed to be protecting the interest of Clubs in the South-South and will henceforth not recognize him.\n\n‘We have examined the actions of Mr Effiong Johnson critically especially, on this matter and we have passed a vote of no confidence on him. He ceased to represent Warri Wolves on the Board of the NFF.\n\nHe is supposed to be representing the interest of all Clubs in the South- South, but you can see that he has deviated from that and we will no longer recognize him .Anybody who transacts business with him in the name of Warri Wolves is doing so at his own risk as he is no longer our representative.”\n\nCulled from :Here\n\nIntroduction\n\nPHCN successor companies\n\nBidding and preferred bidders\n\nConditions for preferred bidders\n\nImpediments to the handover of successor companies\n\nComment\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe deterioration of Nigeria’s electricity power generation, distribution and supply has attracted much national and international criticism. The resulting negative economic and social impact has prompted various government initiatives and legislation aimed at restructuring and reviving this strategic sector, including:\n\nthe National Policy on Electric Power 2001;\n\nthe Electric Power Sector Reform Act (6/2005); and\n\nthe Roadmap for Power Sector Reform 2010.\n\nThe policy sets out the government’s objectives for the sector, including divestiture by the government of its interests in state-owned entities within the sector and the promotion of competition through the full liberalisation of the electricity market.\n\nThe act seeks to enshrine these objectives and provide a framework for their implementation. It provides for:\n\nprivatisation of the former state-owned monopoly – the National Electric Power Authority;\n\nunbundling of the National Electric Power Authority’s successor company – the Power Holding Company of Nigeria Plc (PHCN) – into distinct business units;\n\nthe subsequent transfer of PHCN’s assets, liabilities and staff to its successor companies;\n\nliberalisation of the Nigerian electricity industry to allow for private sector investment; and\n\ndetermination of market variables (eg, pricing) by market forces.\n\nThe road map indicates the government’s intention to divest from PHCN’s successor companies, other than the Transmission Company of Nigeria, which will continue to be responsible for the transmission of electricity; this is a natural monopoly for the state.\n\nPHCN successor companies\n\nFollowing the unbundling of PHCN, the following 18 successor companies have been incorporated:\n\nsix generation companies (Geregu Power Plc, Afam Power Plc, Sapele Power Plc and Ughelli Power Plc (thermal-generation companies) and Kainji Hydro Electric Plc and Shiroro Hydro Electric Plc (hydro-generation companies));\n\n11 distribution companies (Kaduna Electricity Distribution Company Plc, Enugu Electricity Distribution Company Plc, Benin Electricity Distribution Company Plc, Eko Electricity Distribution Company Plc, Kano Electricity Distribution Company Plc, Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company Plc, Abuja Electricity Distribution Company Plc, Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company Plc, Jos Electricity Distribution Company Plc, Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company Plc and Yola Electricity Distribution Company Plc); and\n\nthe Transmission Company of Nigeria.\n\nAs a first step in their privatisation, the Ministry of Finance and the Bureau of Public Enterprises have been appointed as initial shareholders of the successor companies.\n\nBidding and preferred bidders\n\nOn July 16 2012 the Bureau of Public Enterprises opened bids for the takeover of the PHCN successor companies. In addition to considering technical bids, the bureau and the National Council on Privatisation considered the highest financial bids and those bidders with the best efficiency programmes aimed at reducing the chances of aggregate technical, commercial and collection losses.\n\nOn October 29 2012 the National Council on Privatisation approved North-South Power Limited as the preferred bidder for Shiroro Hydro Power Plc and Mainstream Energy Solutions Ltd as the preferred bidder for Kainji Hydro Power Plc. Transcorp, Woodrock, Sumbion, Medea, PSL and Thomassen emerged as the preferred bidders for the sale of 100% shares in Ughelli Power Plc and CMEC/EURAFRIC Energy JV Consortium as the preferred bidder for Sapele Power Plc.\n\nAmperion Power Distribution Company Ltd was approved as the preferred bidder for the core investor sale of 51% of the shares of Geregu Power Plc. KANN Consortium Utility Company Limited and Vigeo Power Consortium were both approved as preferred bidders for the sale of 60% of the shares of Abuja Electricity Distribution Company Plc and Benin Electricity Distribution Company Plc, respectively.\n\nOther preferred bidders and the respective distribution companies sold to them are:\n\nWest Power and Gas (Eko Electricity Distribution Company Plc);\n\nNew Electricity Distribution Company (Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company Plc);\n\nIntegrated Energy Distribution Marketing Ltd (Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company Plc and Yola Electricity Distribution Company Plc);\n\nInterstate Electrics Limited (Enugu Electricity Distribution Company Plc);\n\nAura Energy Limited (Jos Electricity Distribution Company Plc);\n\nSahelian Power SPV Limited (Kano Electricity Distribution Company Plc); and\n\n4Power Consortium (Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company Plc).\n\n​Preferred bidders are yet to be approved for Afam Power Plc and Kaduna Electricity Distribution Company Plc.\n\nConditions for preferred bidders\n\nEach preferred bidder was required to provide a credit letter or bank guarantee for 15% of the transaction value within 15 business days of receiving notification from the Bureau of Public Enterprises. They were also required to make a down payment of 25% of the share purchase price within 15 days of signing the transaction documents. In addition, preferred bidders were required to pay the remaining 75% of the bid consideration in full within six months of signing the transaction documents as a condition precedent to taking over the successor companies.\n\nImpediments to the handover of successor companies\n\nAlthough the respective sale agreements between the preferred bidders and the Bureau of Public Enterprises were signed on February 21 2013 and the mandatory 25% consideration was paid by the preferred bidders, the successor companies are yet to be handed over to the preferred bidders/purchasers. This is due to:\n\nthe preferred bidders’ failure to satisfy the condition of completing payment of the outstanding 75% of the bid consideration; and\n\ndisagreements between the government and former PHCN employees over severance payments owed to them.\n\nPreferred bidders have raised concerns that they lack access to the distribution companies, and have alleged that the data made available to them following their approval as preferred bidders and the actual operational state or condition of the distribution companies failed to reflect reality.\n\nIn addition, certain bidders claim that they have not been allowed to shadow manage the distribution companies as was agreed before the signing of the transaction documents with the Bureau of Public Enterprises. In view of these challenges, it remains to be seen whether the preferred bidders will proceed with closing these transactions.\n\nRecently, and perhaps in a bid to address some of these challenges, the government inaugurated transition committees for each of the successor companies for which the mandatory 25% consideration has been paid, in order to enable the bidders/purchasers to commence the process of taking over management in line with the terms of the transaction documents. Each committee consists of representatives of the Bureau of Public Enterprises, the management of the requisite successor company and the preferred bidder. The committees are responsible for:\n\nensuring that preferred bidders/purchasers have sufficient access to their respective successor companies in order to enable them to prepare for the implementation of their approved business plans;\n\nensuring that the bidders/purchasers are allowed to monitor ongoing operations in the successor companies in order to ensure that they are carried out efficiently and in compliance with the transaction documents;\n\nproviding a platform for the preferred bidders/purchasers to interact with the management team and employees of the successor companies in order to allow for a smooth transition; and\n\nfacilitating the smooth transition of the management and operational control of the successor companies to the preferred bidders/purchasers at the appropriate time.\n\nThis privatisation exercise is an important step towards achieving the structural reforms intended by the government. It is expected that once the successor companies have finally been handed over to the respective preferred bidders/purchasers and are fully operated by them, the ensuing competition between these investors will lead to improved and more efficient electricity generation and supply throughout the country.\n\nHowever, at present, the delay in the handover of these companies appears largely to be due to the failure of the preferred bidders to complete payment for the purchase of these companies, and to the disagreements between PHCN’s former employees and the government. On June 17 2013 the government agreed to pay a N384 billion (in excess of $2 billion) severance package to the disengaged PHCN employees. It is hoped that once these entitlements have been paid and the preferred bidders complete payment of the outstanding 75% purchase price, the handover of the successor companies will be relatively seamless.\n\nFor further information on this topic please contact Aniekan George Ikott at Udo-Udoma Belo-Osagie by telephone (+234 1 263 4831), fax (+234 1 263 4541) or email (aniekan.ikott@uubo.org).

The Egbema Ijaws are now insisting that it is their turn to produce the next chairman.\n\nImpeccable sources in the LGA disclosed that several Itsekiri villages, including Gbokoda, Udo, Ajamita, Obaghoro and Ayerode-Zion on the Benin river axis, were razed down.\n\nAlthough the number of persons killed could not be ascertained as of the time of this story, some sources said at least four persons were known to have died in the violence. One other person was seriously injured and was said to be receiving treatment at a hospital in Sapele, while Itsekiris and Ijaws from neighbouring communities were said to have fled their communities for fear of being attacked.\n\nYesterday’s invasion of the Itsekiri communities is reminiscent of the fratricidal war between Ijaw and Itsekiri ethnic nationalities between 1997 and 2001.\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters, an Itsekiri who pleaded anonymity said, “The Ijaw had demanded that the chairmanship position of the council be allocated to them if peace must reign in the area. We have six electoral wards in the council and before now we have always produced the chairman while the Ijaw that have four electoral wards take the position of the vice-chairman.\n\n“But sometime ago the Ijaw protested against the whole arrangement that this was no longer acceptable to them and unless they occupy the chairmanship position heads will roll. This same Ijaw also protested against the population figure produced by the National Population Commission (NPC) as well as wards delineation done by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC that gave us the Itsekiri the upper hand over them. The Ijaws till date have regarded that exercise as fraudulent.”\n\nAs of the time of this report, the Commanding Officer of the Joint Task Force codenamed Operation Pulo Shield, had relocated to the troubled areas to maintain law and order and prevent any escalation of the crisis to other parts of the state.\n\nA source at the police headquarters in Asaba told our correspondent that the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Ikechukwu Adaba, invited some Ijaw and Itsekiri leaders to his office yesterday to deliberate on how to nip the crisis in the bud and find a lasting solution to it.\n\nIt was gathered that following a briefing on the incident, Governor Uduaghan directed security agents to fish out those behind the violence, warning that he would not fold his arms and allow some disgruntled elements to truncate his peace and security agenda.\n\nCondemning the action, Ijaw elder statesman and Egbema leader, Chief Emma Ebimami, stated that following the leadership tussle in Itsekiri communities, some aggrieved Itsekiri youths could have invited the Ijaw youths to come to their assistance. He called for a thoroughly investigation of the matter, stressing that those found wanting should be made to face the music.\n\nSource: Sahara Reporters\n\nShort URL: http://www.osundefender.org/?p=107316\n\nPosted by Felicia Ilerioluwa\n\non Jul 3 2013.

The media has played a significant role in the development of the nation and has continued to contribute its quota to the entire well being of the people.\n\nMass media which comprises of radio, television, newspapers, magazines, cable and satellite stations has over the years serve as a medium of dissemination of information to the people and keeping them abreast of the happenings around them both the good, the bad and the ugly.\n\nDespite the immense contribution of the media in sanitizing the society, the society still remain in a stagnant position that has continually hindered the progress, prosperity, unity and development of the society.\n\nSome of the weighing problems that this nation is facing is that of IMPUNITY which has become prevalent in the Nigerian society of today. Impunity has now become the order of the day in our nation as many engage in the act and throw caution to the winds and operate as if there is no law governing us as a people.\n\nTalking about impunity in Nigeria, it has assumed a worrisome state in the country, and international media reports state that Nigeria has consistently ranked low in numerous development studies by global institutions despite huge potentials. The statistic shows that the 2011 Human Development Report of UNDP ranked Nigeria 156 out of 187 countries while Transparency International’s 2012 report ranked her 139 out of 179 countries. This is not a healthy development for us as a nation.\n\nIn addition to the developmental challenges brought about by impunity, it has also fueled human rights violations, aided organized crime, contributed significantly to the spread of violence and fear across the country.\n\nImpunity continues to undermine the rule of law, allowing a class of powerful people to steal, plunder, kill, and generally behave as if they are exempted from the rules by which civilized societies are governed. In most cases, such people are not prosecuted for their criminal behaviours and when they are, it is done without rigour.\n\nLooking at the state of the nation as regards impunity, the citizenry have a whole lot of role to play in combating the scourge eating deep into the annals of the nation and her development. The media especially have a more important role to play in reducing if not totally eradicating this dreaded disease threatening to devour this nation.\n\nIn a media workshop attended by 22 journalists across the nation recently at Benizia Hotel, Off Summit Road, Asaba in Delta State the importance of using the media to fight impunity to a standstill in the nation was unveiled. Mr. Edetaen Ojo of Media Rights Agenda, Lagos was one of the facilitators at the programme and he delivered a lecture tilted “Why The Media Is a Critical Tool In Combating Impunity”.\n\nThis becomes necessary because of the power and important role of the media in developing the nation.\n\nOjo said that there was no single Institution, agency, government or indeed any single sector of the society that can successfully combat impunity on its own without a collective effort from various quarters which must importantly include the media. According to the facilitator, all hands must be on deck to halt the wide spread of impunity.\n\nFor the entire society to be involved in the campaign against impunity, a number of things need to happen. According to Ojo, people must be aware of what impunity is, as well as knows how it affects their social lives and economic well-being. They must be able to mobilized to act against impunity or insist that action be taken against impunity.\n\nHe said the media remain an important tool and instrument for combating a lot of social ills and vices in the society including impunity which has giving rise to the wave of crime in the nation. The media is important in all this due to its essential characteristics and its power to impact greatly on the citizenry.\n\nWhat is the nature of Media Power? The media has the power to create awareness. It has the great capacity to reach masses of people and provide them with reliable information about all manner of issues happening around them. Media channels are more effective than other avenues in getting reliable information into the society system quickly. They are fastest means of disseminating reliable information to a large number of the general public including the low and most powerful.\n\nThe media can be used to influence government decisions and policies on a wide variety of issues. It is equally used to set agenda for public policy-making. If properly used, it can force government to take action on a wide variety of matters which may include, economic, social, political, and cultural and the likes.\n\nThe media should be effectively used to propagate the problem of impunity in the country because it has the power to influence and shape public opinion. This is made possible because of its great capacity to reach the masses when used strategically.\n\nMedia practitioners, should remember that the media has enormous power that can be put into action to mobilize the people. With its capacity to reach masses of people and influence their thought processes and opinion, media can also be used to mobilize people around issues.\n\nPower to force government action- By setting the agenda and mobilizing public opinion around it, the media can force the government or policy makers to put in place appropriate policies and measures required to combat impunity effectively.\n\nIt is worthy of note that people who engage in acts of impunity fear exposure (especially when there are sanctions mechanisms that can be applied against them). They will only do it if they believe they can get away with it. The media is very important to stop the wide spread of this act that has continually soiled the image and name of this great country.\n\nThe media has an herculean task to carry out if this scourge must stop. The media must engage in war with this cancer worm through investigative and other forms of journalism. They can expose impunity, consistently focus the searchlight on cases of impunity and ensure that action is taken. If this is done people will begin to realize that they will be exposed and that they can no longer get away with breaking the law.\n\nCulled from :Here\n\nJETHRO IBILEKE/Asaba\n\nPolice authorities in Nigeria’s Delta state said they would demolish the home of a man accused of being an ‘informant’ to a robbery gang.\n\nThe State Commissioner for Police, Ikechukwu Aduba who made this disclosure in Asaba, the state capital Thursday, also disclosed that the 12-man armed robbery gang which attempted to rob a branch of a new generation bank in Asaba in the early hours of last Sunday came from Lagos.\n\nAduba who spoke with journalists at the end of the State Security Council meeting, said investigation revealed that the informant brought the dare-devil gang from Lagos.\n\n“The Command has also identified the informant’s residence and it would be demolished in the next few days to serve as a deterrent to others with evil intentions in the State,” Aduba said.\n\nAlthough none of the robbers has been arrested, Aduba stated that his command was on top of the situation and called on members of the public to give to the police useful information that could lead to the arrest of the fleeing bandits.\n\n“There is no state that is crime free but we foiled the robbery operation and these guys came from Lagos.
