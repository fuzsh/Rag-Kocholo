        "text": "There is a level of hatred, anger, and malcontent that has been reserved for Ater Majok in Australia.\n\nIt is quite disturbing.\n\nSome consider him a failure. Failure of what?\n\nHere is a guy that came to a new country from a war situation. He had to learn a new culture and a new language. He adapted as best he could and though it may not be \"Aussie\", I have never heard him say anything negative about other players. He has exuded a confidence that you need in hardship to get you through the hard times. He has had a belief in himself that has taken him further than any other Sudanese basketball player to date. He has even gone further than other Australians who were priviledge to have the economics to play junior representative basketball and garner a scholarship to the AIS.\n\nYes he went to the USA, played a half season at UCONN, played in the played in Europe, played in the NBL, was drafted in the 2nd round as the 2nd to last pick, and is now playing in Europe. Yes the hype machine of the US pumped him up and he bought into some of it (but remember he is navigating western culture) but never have I heard him say anything in the press that is negative towards Australian Basketball, its coaches, or its players.\n\nWhere does this hatred come from? Ater Majok has taken the road less traveled and has had success and failure along the way. This is brave on his part.\n\nThis nation has been married to the \"tall poppy\" syndrome within itself. It is time for a divorce.\n\nAter has paved the way for other African players to leave Australia without the economic means to seek scholarships overseas. The numbers are increasing. Some may fail and some may succeed but the mere attempt is a success based on the hard journey most of them have had.\n\nBest of luck Ater. For me and many others, your journey and your bravery in trying to change your life and the life of your family is valiant and a success in itself.\n\nI have to agree that it seems theres some unjustified majok hate going on here.. I mean sure, I for one admit that I havent seen majok do much that really qualifies him to be in the NBA... however, hes gone and put himself in the mix and somehow to everyones astonishment... found a way to get his foot half way in the door at very least. NBA scouts know of this guy, sure he may not be the hot topic but how many of your NBL heroes do these scouts even know about or would even be aware of there existance.. (none except Kazzouh and Bruce). Fact is, the Lakers scouts saw him in the past year... and they obviously see atleast a small nugget of potential.... I for one would say its solely in his height and athleticism... however regardless... He will find a proffessional league for himself to play some sort of role in. over the next few years.... anything can happen, players can revolutionise themselves in a matter of months... and cain consistancy within maybe just over a year. Sure the guys 24... and RAW as raw could be... but give him 2 or 3 years? maybe something clicks in his head.... He may in the not too distant future find a lowkey NBA gig... he could very well come back to the NBL and get his shit together late season then start to actually dominate.... He could potentially bring himself into boomers conention for beijing.... HOWEVER< i am not saying straight out hes gonna be a star regardless and lock him in for the boomers 12... I am just saying that the Lakers obviously saw something enough in him to give it a look, and he should atleast be given a shot in a boomers camp.. despite the things we have or have not yet seen from him.\n\nThe NBA is different in certain aspects than the NBL. One thing Ater Majok does and does well at every level is block shots. Blocking shots also encompasses changing shots and offenses.\n\nThere are guys that are paid good money to just come in for 10 mins a game to spell a starter as a defensive stopper. Given his potential to stretch the defense, he would not be offensively inept as some of the African players that have had careers as defensive players in the NBA.\n\nGiven that Brett Brown is in the NBA, I think he will keep Ater on his radar because I have not seen anybody in the NBL with that combination of length, athleticism, and defensive potential. The offense will come in time. If anyone out there has his stats in Europe this year, please post his points, rebounds, block shots, and %'s.\n\nFor the most part, I agree with paul regarding posters attitude towards Majok. Most are knowledgable fans whose opinions are based on assessments of his mostly underwhelming performances to date and the numerous controversies that have surrounded him implying a lack of professionalism that seemingly hinders his ultimate realisation of his potential.\n\nThere are however numerous examples of posters who are expressing something more than that. There is at least one anonymous troll who has blatantly hated every post with Majok's name (anonymously, of course) over the last few years. So there is some merit to the defensive posts above. I just dont think that all Hoops posters need to be tarred with the hate brush.\n\nPersonally I hope Majok has all the success in the world. If he succeeds, we gain an Australian player with physical tools unmatched by few if any Boomers in history. If he fails, well nothing lost.\n\nPaul, I did qualify my post with a strong ending giving credit to those who encompass the Aussie spirit of giving it a go (\"For me and many others, your journey and your bravery in trying to change your life and the life of your family is valiant and a success in itself.\")\n\nWhere I don't agree is where people have made baseless comments that Ater Majok does not work hard enough. From all the reports I have read, his work ethic is off the charts. Yes he did have 1 or 2 times that he missed or was late for practice and/or a weight session in Perth. Other than that, no other team in the US, Australia, or Europe have reported any issues in terms of missing practice or having a negative attitude towards an organization or its members.\n\nAussieboomers, I can't say Ater has had underwhelming performances based on the fact that we many agree that he started the game late and is raw. On the contrary, I feel this is why he has been give the opportunity rather than others who have potentially hit their ceiling. I do agree that there has been controversy surrounding Majok, but being the first Sudanese from Australia to go this far, it warrants to an extent some analysis as the data available is based only on his accomplishments.\n\nMick, the content of my post implies that I am referring to Sudanese players who have left Australia. I cannot compare his success to that of Luol Deng and Manute Bol.\n\ngood on him, i think he is improving by looking at his team position in Europe and the score he is adding to the team, apparently his one of the top 3 players on the team, all the credit goes to Australia :)\n\nHe may not been to the top player (L.James, K.Bryant) but he is something better than most Australian players :)\n\nhe started at an older age, and he learned so much, our Australian culture, our language and basketball.\n\nAter will be somewhere near the future, and yes he can the the no.1 spot, it may be not this year but near the future (1-4 years)\n\nGod bless him\n\nI am leaving because I was beginning to wade into the shallow end of the pool.\n\nYou could not seem to comprehend that if Majok were late to 1 session and missed another, it does not mean that he is not a hard worker.\n\nI am sure you are perfect and have never missed or been late to work for any circumstance.\n\nFrom Jim Calhoun in the Courant: \"You've got to play, you've got to play hard, and that's one thing Ater has always done,\" coach Jim Calhoun said. \"Full credit to him. He's always had a great engine.\n\nThis statement was made on a day that Majok did not play well and did not play up to standards. Yet Jim Calhoun recognizes the true traits of Majok.\n\nIt is propaganda when it is said that Majok does not work hard.\n\nIt is fact when he misses 1 session and is late for another (this I never disputed).\n\nFor all the people who have not missed 1 day of work or have been late for work 1 day, I applaud you. Your perfection does not mean that others are not professional because the missed 1 day of work or was late 1 day.\n\nThe \"propaganda card\" is not the same as the \"race card\". There are people who read but cannot comprehend what is fact and immediately say it is propaganda because of intellectual paucity. It was tongue in cheek when I said \"anti Majok propaganda\".\n\nI have ventured to far off the topic of the post so I am done here but I will leave on this note:\n\nAter Majok is not the #1 PF for the Boomers until he earns it. Getting drafted by the Lakers, in any round, is a great career accomplishment but playing for your country is even greater.\n\nI have known the guy for a few year, very good person and funny. majok some times has he's days but I know one thing for sure Majok is the hardest working person I know and will naver backdown.\n\nOne question: if majok is all u guys say he is he is that he is this, don't u think the lakers investigated him before drafting him. Know and reading up on the NBA draft team do background cheaks on u from birth and ask everyone about u.\n\nI know for a fact that majok was late and miss training because of the way the management Wes treating him. It was not because he was late he was trying to prove a point.\n\nIf I was in Majok' s shoes I would do what he did and by him being drafted he has nathing to loss\n\nI know for a fact that majok was late and miss training because of the way the management Wes treating him. It was not because he was late he was trying to prove a point.\n\nYou've just proved that this guy is completely unprofessional.\n\nAll his teammates are at training working hard on their games, while he is skipping sessions to \"make a point\"?\n\nFor all the people who have not missed 1 day of work or have been late for work 1 day, I applaud you. Your perfection does not mean that others are not professional because the missed 1 day of work or was late 1 day.\n\nIf I just decided to skip a day of work to \"make a point\" I would not be employed much longer. So yes, it DOES make him unprofessional! If only he worked as hard on the training track as he does apparently trying to \"make points\"!!"
