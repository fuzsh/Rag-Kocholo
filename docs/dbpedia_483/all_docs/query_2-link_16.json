        "text": "To clear the roster spot for Andersen, the Cavaliers sent center Sasha Kaun and cash to Philadelphia on Friday. The Sixers plan to waive Kaun, league sources said. Cleveland also gets a $1.33 million traded-player exception for the Kaun deal, a source said.\n\nThe 76ers acquired center Sasha Kaun and some cash consideration in exchange for the rights to Chukwudiebere Maduabum in the trade with the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday. Itâ€™s unlikely that the Sixers will keep Kaun. The cash consideration is expected to cover more than $1.3 million the Russian is scheduled to make this season. As a result, this deal was nothing more than the Cavaliers purchasing some of the Sixers cap space.\n\nStoryline: Sasha Kaun Free Agency"
