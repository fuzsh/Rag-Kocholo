        "text": "The last NBA draft had really unexpected names, like the Nigerian Chukwudiebere “Chu Chu” Maduabum and the Sudanese with an Australian passport Ater Majok, whose potential to one day play in the best league in the world is, to say the least, debatable. But, without a doubt, no name raised as much dust as Tanguy Ngombo.\n\nThe Congolese power forward, a nationalized Qatari, has signed for Girona FC, a Spanish Adecco Oro team, after spending the last six seasons at Al-Rayyan in his adopted country. The Catalan team, according to the Diari de Girona, will not pay Ngombo more than accommodation and meals, although this signing will not be made official until the FEB approves processing his file (along with that of two other Spanish players) due to the debt that Girona has acquired with the federation.\n\nA curious twist of fate for Ngombo, originally selected by the Dallas Mavericks in 57th place in the draft (as an example, Isaiah Thomas, one of the best rookies of the season with Sacramento, was chosen as 60th). The rights of the player, who stood out in the 2010 Asian Games adding 19.6 points and 6.6 rebounds with Qatar, were transferred to Minnesota, with Portland as \"intermediary.\" The cost for Timberwolves He was a future 2nd round draft pick.\n\nBut shortly afterward the scandal would break out. Ngombo, still in his native country, the Republic of Congo, played in the African Champions Cup with Inter Brazzaville, registered as being born in 1984, which would make him 27 years old at the time of being chosen in the draft. On the other hand, in official competitions he played as a Qatari and his date of birth became 1989. A controversy that ended up calling into question Ngombo's eligibility in the draft, although the NBA finally ended up accepting the documentation presented by the player, recognizing him as born in 1989.\n\nNgombo will make his debut in a European league as long as the FEB accepts his registration. It will be the first opportunity to see up close if there is NBA material in the exotic power forward, or on the contrary it will be a wasted draft choice."
