        "text": "With new lineup, Sixers fall to Pacers at home\n\nPHILADELPHIA – Tim Frazier, Robert Covington, Luc Mbah a Moute, Nerlens Noel and Jason Richardson.\n\nSixers fans, this could potentially be your new starting lineup for the remainder of the season.\n\nThat new lineup was unable to get its way against the Indiana Pacers on Friday night, as the Sixers fell 106-95 at the Wells Fargo Center.\n\nThe new faces and rotations weren't able to find their groove against a veteran Indiana team.\n\nPhiladelphia was very active Thursday at the NBA trade deadline and sent reigning Rookie of the Year Michael Carter-Williams to Milwaukee, as well as K.J. McDaniels to Houston.\n\nIn return, the Sixers received Isaiah Canaan, JaVale McGee, the rights to Chukwudiebere Maduabum and a slew of draft picks.\n\n\"My first reaction was the human reaction; I'm going to miss those guys,\" said Sixers' head coach Brett Brown. \"I appreciated the work that they put in. They gave A-plus efforts, were great teammates and showed tremendous improvement.\"\n\n\"That is my strongest comment, and the first one that comes out. The reality of the business side, and the enormous amount of work that goes into putting a program and a team together is draining. But I think it's an example of a club having the guts to make extremely difficult decisions, and try to get some place special.\"\n\nCanaan could potentially take over the point guard spot for Carter-Williams. In 25 games with nine starts for the Rockets this season, Canaan averaged 6.2 points, 1.3 rebounds and 1.2 assists in 14.8 minutes per game while shooting 40 percent from the field and 38 percent from deep.\n\nCanaan was inactive Friday night, but is looking forward to the opportunity.\n\n\"I'm a competitor, and I'm not going to back down from anybody,\" he said. \"I was born a winner, and that's how I like to be. I'm going to go out there and just leave it all out on the court and do whatever my coaches and teammates ask of me.\"\n\n\"I just want to do whatever I can to help.\"\n\nJaVale McGee, however, did make his Sixers' debut. The 7-footer backed up Noel and played 11 minutes.\n\n\"We've never been apologetic or bashful about shaking someone's hand and throwing them in a game,\" Brown said. \"I felt like, here he is, he's ours, so let's try him.\"\n\nThe Pacers were in control from the start, and even held a 25-point lead during the first half. Rodney Stuckey led all scores with 30 points. C.J. Miles had 17, and Luis Scola had 16, as Indiana improved to 22-33 on the season.\n\nThe Sixes were led by Mbah a Moute and Jerami Grant as the duo each scored 16 points. Noel almost pulled off his first career triple-double. The big man finished with 12 points, nine rebounds and nine blocks.\n\n\"How about Nerlens tonight,\" Brown said. \"Nine blocked shots, and I thought he had 11. My stat people think there were a few that should be credited.\"\n\nWith the loss, the Sixers dropped to 12-42.\n\nGame notes\n\n• As part of a three-team trade with Phoenix and Milwaukee, the Sixers acquired the L.A. Lakers' protected 2015 first-round pick held by the Suns and traded Michael Carter-Williams to the Bucks. The Sixers also acquired Isaiah Canaan and the lesser of Minnesota's or Denver's 2015 second-round pick via Houston in exchange for K.J. McDaniels. Philadelphia's final move involved acquiring a 2015 first-round pick from Oklahoma City via Denver, along with the rights to Chukwudiebere Maduabum in exchange for the rights to Cenk Akyol.\n\nHeading into the 2015 NBA Draft, the Sixers could potentially own as many as four first-round selections (their own, L.A. Lakers, Miami and Oklahoma City) and five second-round picks (lesser of Denver and Minnesota, Golden State, Houston, New Orleans and Orlando; the Sixers are not likely to retain their own second-round pick as part of a previous trade.)\n\n• Jason Richardson made his season debut for the Sixers on Friday and scored seven points. It was the first time Richardson has played in a game since Jan. 18, 2013. The last time the 34-year-old Richardson played in an NBA game, he did so as a Sixers' starter alongside Jrue Holiday, Evan Turner, Thaddeus Young and Lavoy Allen. None of the five reserves – Nick Young, Spencer Hawes, Damien Wilkins, Dorell Wright and Royal Ivey – are currently with the team. Richardson is the only Sixer on the roster from the end of the 2012-2013 regular season.\n\n• The last time the Sixers and Pacers faced each other, the Sixers came out on top 93-92 at the Wells Fargo Center on Jan. 10. In that game, Tony Wroten led the Sixers with 20 points, but Carter-Williams layup in the final seconds gave Philadelphia the win. Philadelphia leads the all-time series against the Pacers 95-68."
