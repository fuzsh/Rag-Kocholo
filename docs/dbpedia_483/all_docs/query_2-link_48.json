Today that includes two Kansas City Chiefs are opening a restaurant and staffers dress as foxes to care for orphaned fox … Here are her stories from today.\n\nTravis Kelce And Patrick Mahomes Are Opening A Steakhouse\n\nWell, they won their third Super Bowl together, so why not open a restaurant? That’s exactly what Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes are doing. They released renderings of their new steakhouse called 1587 Prime, scheduled to open in early 2025. Check the name there… 1587… Number 15 for Mahomes, number 87 for Kelce. Cute. They’re working with Las Vegas based restaurant company Noble 33 to give visitors a unique experience. With Noble 33 making most of the big decisions, however the duo have contributed their input. Both Mahomes and Kelce are said to have frequented Noble 33’s other restaurants and they look to make 1587 Prime a chain restaurant in the future.\n\n[Source – ESPN.com]\n\nStaffers At A Wildlife Center Dress Up As Foxes To Care For Orphaned Fox\n\nThis is the feel-good story of the week. A wildlife center in Virginia has gone viral with a video that shows workers dressed up as a mother fox in order to care for a small orphaned red fox. Executive Director Melissa Stanley can be seen dressed as a fox while feeding the young fox. The center has explained that it’s important to make sure that the orphaned foxes that is raised in captivity do not become imprinted upon or habituated to humans. Very Twilight, isn’t it? In seriousness, they are doing really good work here, it’s special. The orphaned fox was found in an alley in Richmond, VA and is being cared for in the hopes that the fox will be released back into its natural habitat.\n\n[Source – NY Post]\n\nA Cup of Coffee: 10 Philadelphia Sixers Players Better Known With Other Teams\n\nJen Scordo was born and raised just outside of Atlanta, Georgia but she has called the Northeast her home for over 20 years.
