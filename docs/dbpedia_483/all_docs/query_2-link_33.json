He made a tremendous impact on the court for the Canadians, by setting both scoring and shot blocking records for an individual game. However, Canada failed to qualify for the Beijing Olympics.\n\nThe following summer, Anthony participated in the 2009 FIBA Americas Championship. He helped lead Canada to a 4th-place finish, losing in the bronze medal game to Argentina.

His mother is Erene Anthony from the island of Antigua, who he listed on his biography as the person that made a difference in his life because she has been an inspiration to him. He also has a sister, Sherlette Pryce. He was able to attend Selwyn House School, a private school in Westmount, with the support of financial aid. He graduated from UNLV in December 2006 with a degree in university studies, and majoring in sociology and physical education.\n\nHe is commonly referred to as \"The Warden\" by fans. The nickname started gaining traction on Twitter after the Heat beat the Knicks in New York on December 17, 2010, and fans credited Anthony for \"locking up\" Amar'e Stoudemire. However, his teammates refer to him as \"Doc\".\n\n[]"
