Ham said in a press statement that the meeting discussed principle topics on military partnership between the two countries. He added the partnership would provide the armies in both states a framework for close collaboration in addressing the security concerns in the future.\n\nThe military official described the meeting with President Kiir as great and productive and disclosed that appropriate action resulting from the meeting will be taken soon.

Akec\n\nJuly 30, 2011 — If you think there are ethics to guide the current economic war that is taking shape between the Republic of Sudan and the newly independent South Sudan, be ready to be disappointed. As far as Sudan government is concerned, and in the words of its finance minister Ali Mahmud, his government is ready to do whatever it takes to protect North Sudan economy (Sudani, 12 July 2011, Issue 1992). Literally, that is what Sudan government has embarked on by fighting South Sudan economically hands off the glove, hitting hard under the belt, and taking no prisoners following the pattern of the 22-year war conflict that was waged against them by Sudan Liberation Army (SPLA) in the South and other areas of the North, a war that eventually led to separation of the South from the rest of the country on 9th July 2011.\n\nWhat it is that the North is doing economically to the South that can be depicted in such harsh terms? And what has the new nation done to engender such an angry response from their erstwhile protagonists? Could anything have been done differently to avoid the economic war? And what kind of loss or gains we expect each party is going to incur in this unfortunate conflict? There are no easy answers.\n\nHow North Sudan is Waging its Economic War against South Sudan?\n\nA few months in run up to South Sudan independence, the government in Khartoum stopped transportation of fuel and food items from the North to the South. Prices of the fuel rocketed in the South. People parked their cars in their homes and walked to work or risked spending long hours in queues to get a few gallons of petrol for arm and a leg. That fuel came from Kenya and Uganda. Then came the mass relief of Sudanese of Southern origin from the army and civil service in the North and ordering private sector employers to follow suite, a month ahead of declaration of South Sudan independence; a move that was roundly condemned by a wide spectrum of Northern Sudanese civil society which regarded it as inhumane and an attempt to export mass unemployment to the South.\n\nIn air travel, luck or coincidence was the ally of Khartoum government. The only 2 Fokker aircrafts owned by Feeder Airline were grounded by a manufacturer order, warning of faulty fog detection system. This is the only South Sudan based passenger-airliner connecting Khartoum and South Sudan main cities. Khartoum aviation authorities also refused to grant landing permit in Khartoum International Airport to Feeder’s new Boeing aircraft. That gave the Northern airliners a monopoly of air travel business between Khartoum and South Sudan. Airfares tripled beyond what many Southerners can afford.\n\nA few days before the declaration of South Sudan independence, all accounts of South Sudanese institutions with central bank were frozen. The electronic banking system used by the Bank of South Sudan (BOSS) and ministry of Finance in the South and the Central bank in Khartoum whose server was maintained in Khartoum was closed down, making it impossible to move funds between BOSS and its branches and between BOSS and other commercial banks in South Sudan or anywhere in the world. Then North launched its new currency barely two days after South Sudan launch of its currency and declaring as illegal tender the 2 billons worth of Sudanese pounds currently circulating in the South, a move that will cost South Sudan US$ 700 million. Finally, the Khartoum government asked Juba to pay US 32 for every barrel of crude oil transported through their pipeline, the highest ever charge in the world for rendering similar service, according to South Sudan officials.\n\nWhat has South Sudan committed against Khartoum to merit this severe punishment?\n\nAccording to leading figures in Sudan ruling party, the National Congress Party (NCP), South Sudan government is doing everything it could to politically destabilize the North, although they would rarely admit publicly that such sentiments are behind their economic furry against the world’s newest nation.\n\nPutting aside the unresolved issues over border demarcation and contested Abyei area, the government of South Sudan is being accused by Khartoum of supporting the recent armed insurgency in South Kordofan with potential rebellion in Blue Nile State, and extending help to Darfur’s armed movements. The statement by the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit, in his independence-day speech that he ’will not forget the people of South Kordofan, Blue Nile, and Darfur, was interpreted in the North as a public confession to interfere in Sudan internal affairs.\n\nWorst, South Sudan is seen by the North as the linchpin of the West in the ’war’ against Khartoum regime which the West has long accused of committing crimes against humanity in Darfur and possibly in South Kordofan. Recently, the NCP stalwart and presidential assistant, Nafi Ali Nafi, warned the South Sudan government to “distant itself from the West if they dream of building any cooperative relations with the North.” Read economic cooperation.\n\nThe Road Not Taken\n\nSouth Sudan had six years to insulate itself from impacts of North economic embargo, or at least minimize such impacts. However, it would seem that no one saw it coming, or rather there are countless things that could have been done and they haven’t. Furthermore, South Sudan should try to be seen to play positive influence in Kordofan, Blue Nile, and Darfur- difficult yet worth trying. On their part, the Khartoum government should reach a fair deal with armed movements in South Kordofan, Blue Nile and Darfur, a settlement that is not less brave than the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) that successfully brought relative peace after 22 years of conflict.\n\nFailing that, the Khartoum will continue to wage its brutal economic embargo on South Sudan, which will suffer greatly in short-term. However, in the long run, Khartoum risks provoking political uprising if it is seen to be incapable of achieving peace in the 3 areas as well as failing to forge beneficial relations with South Sudan.\n\nThe author is vice chancellor of University of Northern Bahr El Ghazal in South Sudan, and chairperson of Academics and Researchers Forum for Development, a think-tank and advocacy group formed by the South Sudanese academics and researchers.

An indication that Nuba is part forever part of south sudan as GOd have intended it and that south sudan is with them thick and throw..\n\nAfter all tradtional dance, people sit down to watch the SSTV live coverage from the actual declaration of independent in Juba the capital of the south sudan.\n\n0.000000 0.000000\n\nSeveral news agencies have reported mass poisoned and up to 100 children were found dead from different market centers\n\njournalist for Gurtong , Peter Lokale Nakimangole, based in TORIT, South sudan, reported what been\n\nDescribed by southern Sudan official as an evil proportion to Nazis gassing’… that up to Hundreds of street children from Southern Sudan or Africans stock are allegedly poisoned to death in different markets of Khartoum city between June 26th-27th,\n\nSpeaking to Peter Lokale Nakimangole, one woman that called herself Elizabeth said that There are South Sudanese street families locally known as ‘shamasin’ whose kids loiter around various towns of north Sudan, habitually sniffing glue, smoking cigarettes, and usually find nowhere to sleep in the market as days and nights pass,”\n\npurportedly, northern Sudanese traders carry-out to clear them out by placing “poison into water” along corridors adjacent to shops where these destitute groups of children drink” she explained to Gurtong news\n\nSouth Sudanese officials reacted very angrily explained gurtong news\n\n“This must have been planned basically as a part of opposing the upcoming Independence celebration for the soon to be Republic of South Sudan, on 9th July, 2011”. Said South Sudanese officials\n\nMary Aporu, a south Sudanese residing in Khartoum told Gurtong that Suk Weida where a big number of South Sudanese reside has registered the highest death toll so far and the figures are still being tallied from other markets in the city.\n\n“Now Fears have flared among Southerners, some stranded or have rescheduled flights to south sudan in the upcoming historic celebrations,” Aporu, a mother of 4 elaborated.\n\nAmong the markets where hundreds of South Sudanese street children poisoned are Suk(market) sita, Suk Omduruman, Suk Afrenji and Suk Al Harabi.\n\nThe Eastern Equatoria State Deputy Governor, Nartisio Loluke Manir who is deeply concerned over innocent South Sudanese in the north strongly condemned the move, He told Gurtong that together with the eastern equatorial State Governor Hon. Luise Lobong, are making contacts with other in the north and south to establish and investigate the matter.\n\nThe head of Khartoum State’s Criminal Police Department, Major General Mohamed Ahmed was quoted while saying in a statement that 60 homeless people between ages of 13 and 25 had died mysteriously in different parts of the North Sudanese towns, confirming that all these deaths were caused by a consumption of methanol and other toxic substances.\n\n“6 suspects accused of being dealers or suppliers have been arrested”. Declared Khartoum State’s Criminal Police Department, Major General Mohamed Ahmed\n\nGurtong news agency estimated that over 35,000 homeless south Sudanese children live in Khartoum, displaced armed conflicts from various regions in south and western Sudan\n\n0.000000 0.000000\n\n24 hours have since passed as Sudanese and Nigerians are still recovering from happiness in celebrating momentum achievements for Ater majok and Chukwudiebere Maduabum\n\nBut it is not all celebration at media dog house and with some NBA fans at the social network. They have decided not to be part of merriment of NBA 58th draft pick historical. As I wrote this article, Ater is trendy on twitter/facebook, something reserve for Hollywood celebrities on drugs and alcohol addiction or Prince William marriage to girl called Kate.\n\nApparently, media and social network are eventful discussing ater’s pick as “waste of a pick” that He’ll never play in the NBA; they say that as soon as NBA season started; lake will stash him away somewhere “like many other draft last pick.\n\n“He’d be stash in Europe or NBA D league” said ESPN commentator.\n\nMatt Charboneau, a leading columnist from Detroit, Described Ater draft as how ridiculous the NBA draft has become.\n\n“We chalk it up to the mystery of the draft…Teams and their executives must be smarter by finding the superstar nobody knew about. But when was the last time that happened? That type of thinking usually leads to colossal busts and throw-away picks” he wrote in his today column.\n\nBut all is just anger of jealousy and having non-America kids having a chance. This writer just like many other today revealing himself and why he is Angered, apparent there are many Americans kid that deserved that chance than Ater, he was very specific about a kid from Detroit called Kalin Lucas, who according to him led Michigan State to two straight Final Fours and became the Spartans’ fifth all-time leading scorer was left wondering about his future.\n\n“Why selected some dude from Sudan, who went to Australia and ended up at UConn in 2009. While there, he didn’t even average point and left after a year before apparently wowing the NBA gurus at a camp in Italy a couple week’s ago.” and he wonder?\n\nBut it wasn’t Ater alone, these guys seem to have jeaslesy problem of having Africans drafted into NBA saying “You will never hear about Maduabum, Targuy Ngombo or Ater Majok” he declared\n\nAnother sport writer Dexter Fishmore wrote “Lakers Go Obscure with 56th And 58th Picks” saying that Ater Majok Pretty much no one expected him to be taken in this year’s draft, that he’s extremely raw in almost every respect. At UConn he shot only 42 percent, and according to Draft Express he “lacks great deal of strength, balance and coordination, and possesses very little in the ways of experience or feel for the game.” In other words, don’t expect to see him in a Laker uniform soon, if ever\n\nKen Berger, a CBSSports.com Senior Writer, added that the Draft was troubled, saying reading names like Ater Majok amongst other, Known to only a handful of basketball-watching humans until Thursday made laughs and makes him wonder if and when majok ever makes it to the NBA\n\nI could go on about this, thousand other articles and numerous forums that sound exactly negatively the same. TVs like ESPN describing Ater today as unknown when they had him on their programs many time. Not even single news outlet has any prospective chance of Ater pulling on LA Laker jumper ever.\n\nBut i know these people don’t know Ater at all, two years ago, there was these countless news too, that he was deluded for declaring himself NBA draftee and contemplating an aspirations in the NBA but today he is laughing, he made his dream for being drafted.\n\nMost Sudanese do remember very well that When he signed with University of Connecticut. He was rendered something of a joke that was to be bash; all media commentator commented were never encouraging.\n\n”When he made the Boomers team for China, went to turkey to play in Europe, When he played for Perth, When he played for the Gold Coast and When he declared for the draft the 1st time and the 2nd time, he was laughs at like crazy.\n\nNow that he is drafted the negative mount to 100 time, I know one day he will make the LA laker team roster and he will be bashed saying he is never get off the bench”. And when he get off the bench, he would non-performer\n\nObviously, Media don’t know that Ater must have what it takes to be drafted in the first place! He has physical attributes and athletic abilities suited to the NBA game, and he knows very well that These attributes alone will not get him an NBA game, that why he’d solidify determination to work hard on his game to continually improve. I certainly would say to anyone that this opportunity the Lakers gave Ater will prove all his critics wrong. And within short time will he’d triumph and will star in NBA’s games\n\nHe deserves the opportunity. And for many Sudanese, Ater Majok being drafted is successes in itself. But will the media ever know that? It was almost as if it were personal. But thank coach smith and those who have been supportive and recognize the accomplishment of Ater potential (especially as a refugee making his way in a new country)\n\nBut if Ater doesn’t successes in being an NBA star, then this process was itself a success for him, he still be richer in experience and wealth\n\nHe’d be the one when the NBA draft was winding down at around midnight with only three selections remaining, and NBA second-in-command Adam Silver called out a name no one expected to hear.\n\n“With the 58th pick in the 2011 NBA Draft, the Los Angeles Lakers select … Ater Majok the third-to-last overall and also select Darius Morris of Michigan (41st overall), Andrew Goudelock of College of Charleston (46th), Chukwudiebere Maduabum of Nigeria (56th and later traded for a future draft pick)” .\n\n0.000000 0.000000\n\nYou might think I am a rebel without a cause, but you do not understand the cause.\n\nI make my own stand, weather you agree on not, but I respect you right to disagree and not your right to impose that disagreement on me.\n\nI refuse to accept this assign role – in the name of culture or a good Sudanese woman. In fact, I would make a terrible candidate for it; I lack both the qualification and most importantly, the will to accomplish its fundamental assumptions. Indeed, I plan to make no one a good wife- I just hope to be a good person. One who does not think that I have to bend over backward and forget the risk of breaking my own back.\n\nI accept that I am this woman. I refuse to struggle with it anymore. To struggle with the idea that good Sudanese women ‘shut up’ when told. That they do not speak up for what they believe in and fight for their right to live a dignified life. I refuse to relinquish my mind, to willingly be blind and to pretend to be stupid so that I can simply be ‘celebrated’ whilst I suffer in silence- tormented by the truth- if even that truth be my own. For what worth is it, to be part of a world or a culture that do not accept the ‘truth’ of your existence, except to the degree of your degradation.\n\nCall me a Kawaja, or a victim of mental colonization, go a head, that what you normally run to. The argument, that this is not our culture; that it is foreign invention invading out culture purely. But what then is Sudanese culture? Why should I refuse one master and accept another? When you tell me that Women rights are not Sudanese culture, what then is Sudanese culture? Is it, by default or outright acknowledgement, ‘wrong against ‘women? Is beating wives, and sister, and nieces to death? Is force marriage, underage marriage, rape among other? If those right and provision articulated, to prevent discrimination – some time fatale discrimination against women, are not parts of Sudanese culture? What is really left to be part of Sudanese culture? Should I even ask?\n\nIf that was to be true? If Sudanese culture does not recognize women as having rights? Then ask yourself; who in the world, if told, we will beat you, you will have no say in you life, you can be kill for making decision that are not consisted with our want and interest? Tell me, who in this world, if told that, will not reject it? Will not refuse it, rebuke it and fight for something better for themself? Does it take a Kawaja to understand that? Isn’t the pain of that reality too true to be ignored? Biologically when threatened, we fight or, flight became an option? It does not take a genius to figure that out. I need neither be Kawaja nor any other, to understand the condition of my existence- they are self evident.\n\nSo, what are you saying, when you say this is not our culture? Are you saying that we lack the intellectual capacity to see these wrongs and to create solution for them?\n\nIf what it take to be Sudanese or to be a good Sudanese woman, is to stand silent whilst I suffer – I refuse to be Sudanese\n\nIf what it means to be Sudanese is to relinquish my mind, in order to accept illogical conclusion reach by culture biases, then I refuse to be Sudanese\n\nIn fact, I accept all that I will be tag; all that I have been tag. For freedom…indeed freedom is what you are willing to give up your life for …let alone a reputation.\n\nNyadol William Nyuon."
