        "text": "In the tradition of the French Foreign Legion and the Colorado Avalanche, the Denver Nuggets continue to try to enlist young men from other countries with a certain je ne sai quoi to join their cause.\n\nOh, for the love of another Dikembe Mutombo or Nathan MacKinnon.\n\nThe Nuggets have just picked a couple of guys named Joe and Nick to become the 14th and 15th foreign-born players drafted in the franchise’s history.\n\nIf only bigs Jusuf Nurkic and Nikola Jokic can come up very big someday, they could be on a front line with Danilo Gallinari and form the best United Nations of Colorado since Joe Sakic, Peter Forsberg and Valeri Kamensky.\n\nOr they could be the next Efthimi Rentzias and Axel “Rose” Hervelle, fellows from across the sea who never played a game for the Nuggets.\n\nOr worse, Nikoloz “Tsk, tsk” Tskitishvili, the one-time fifth overall selection who did play 143 games for the Nuggets (shooting 30 percent from the field) and proved he couldn’t play, despite the scouting report: “The only way you can stop him from scoring is to take away his visa.” He couldn’t buy a basket with a Visa. The Nuggets apparently believed he had played in the state of Georgia, not the country of Georgia.\n\nAnd lest we forget Izzet Turkyilmaz, Sergio Llull, Sani Becirovic, Ousmane Cisse and Chukwudiebere Maduabum — interesting names the Nuggets owned draft rights to? Forget about them.\n\nI’ve covered 45 ABA and NBA drafts, so forgive me for being a bit cautious or callous in evaluating “talent” from the current ABA (Adriatic Basketball League) — where Nurkic and Jokic played. I watched a basketball game in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, in 1984, and it was not pretty.\n\nI did sort of like Al Cueto, a foreign-born player the old Denver Rockets chose in 1969. He was the first ex-Cuban in pro basketball, after the Rockets traded his rights to the Miami Floridians.\n\nOf course, it must be noted that the San Antonio Spurs won the NBA title with seven players from other countries (and Tim Duncan was born in the U.S. Virgin Islands). And a record 92 players representing 39 countries and territories were on opening-night rosters the past season.\n\nTwenty of the 60 players, and three of the top five, in Thursday night’s draft were born outside the United States.\n\n“The Dream Team” no longer is a European illusion. After the U.S. won the gold medal at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, while walking through a neighborhood by the area, I stopped to watch a kids game and the future of basketball.\n\nThe year before in Denver we delighted at the sight of Dikembe Mutombo, who would become the greatest finger-wagger and ball-clutcher ever in the NBA.\n\nNow, what about Nurkic and Jokic, the dva nebedera (two skyscrapers)?\n\nFirst, though, Nuggets general manager Tim Connelly must be lauded for pulling off a pair of jewel heists on draft day — re- acquiring Arron Afflalo and then getting Gary Harris at No. 19. A writer in Orlando said the Magic also should have been given Kenneth Faried in addition to Evan Fournier (the latest foreign failure in Denver). And Harris was the player the Nuggets wanted at No. 11, anyway, so they ended up with a bonus first-round choice in Nurkic.\n\nActually, Jokic may be the best of the trio when he grows up (from 6-foot-11) and arrives in a year or two.\n\nCoach Brian Shaw claims the roster is set, so Kevin Love with the Nuggets is a Pipe Dream Team. And don’t look for the Nuggets to sign other sexy free agents.\n\nHowever, assuming Gallinari and JaVale McGee — who seems as if he is from another planet, not another country — and Nate Robinson and J.J. Hickson have recovered from injuries, and with Afflalo and Harris in the backcourt with Ty Lawson, the Nuggets will be deeper and better than in years at all five starting positions. And they will “wear down, then wear out” teams at home, as Shaw belatedly figured out.\n\nThe Nuggets will be back in the playoffs, where they belong. But LeBron isn’t walking through that gym door, and Carmelo isn’t returning. The Nuggets still are two bricks shy of a load to win a championship. They can’t entice superstar free agents too dim-witted to recognize paradise.\n\nPerhaps, though, the Nuggets ultimately will win, as their cousins the Avs did, with a Colorado Foreign Legion."
