        "text": "Other than a couple kids from Kentucky (Josh Harrellson and DeAndre Liggins), the following is a comprehensive list of players selected along with their agents of record. Do not pay too much attention to the teams listed, as a lot will change based on trades. Based on the information that is listed below, BDA Sports, Octagon, and Creative Artists Agency each had 5 clients selected. Priority Sports and ASM Sports each had 4 clients selected. The real winner was Wasserman Media Group, with involvement in the representation of 7 player selected. 30 players were selected from the 6 agencies listed above, accounting for exactly half of the entire draft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst Round\n\nKyrie Irving (Cleveland Cavaliers) – Jeff Wechsler (24-7 Sports Management) – This is the first client of Wechsler’s to be drafted #1 overall. However, Wechsler is no stranger to having 1st round clients. He represents Larry Hughes, D.J. White, Quentin Richardson, Mike Sweetney, and used to represent Penny Hardaway – all of whom were selected in the 1st round.\n\nDerrick Williams (Minnesota Timberwolves) – Rob Pelinka (Landmark Sports Agency) – Pelinka has a lot of talented clients, none larger than Kobe Bryant. However, he also represents names like Carlos Boozer, Wesley Johnson, James Harden, Derek Fisher, and Andre Iguodala.\n\nEnes Kanter (Utah Jazz) – Max Ergul – Not much info on Max Ergul; however, he does represent former Milwaukee Bucks forward Ersan Ilyasova.\n\nTristan Thompson (Cleveland Cavaliers) – Leon Rose (Creative Artist Agency) – Leon Rose and CAA happen to represent another former #4 overall pick named Chris Paul. The agency also represents LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Dwyane Wade.\n\nJonas Valanciunas (Toronto Raptors) – Sarunas Broga (East Players) w/CAA – All of Broga’s clients listed on his FIBA page were born in Lithuania.\n\nJan Veseley (Washington Wizards) - Aleksandar Raskovic w/Arn Tellem – Raskovic is said to be working with Wasserman Media Group to represent Veseley in negotiations.\n\nBismack Biyombo (Charlotte Bobcats via trade) – Igor Crespo (Xpheres Basketball Management) – 6th international player taken in the 1st 7 picks of the draft.\n\nBrandon Knight (Detroit Pistons) – Arn Tellem (Wasserman Media Group) – I wonder if Knight will get along with Tracy McGrady, who is also a Tellem client.\n\nKemba Walker (Charlotte Bobcats) – Jeff Schwartz (Excel Sports Management) – This is the same company that recently hired Casey Close and is quickly developing a very powerful baseball division.\n\nJimmer Fredette (Sacramento Kings via trade) - Jeff Austin (Octagon) – The crew at Octagon did a tremendous job boosting the marketability of an already marketable Fredette. Let’s see what they can do with him once he is in the NBA.\n\nKlay Thompson (Golden State Warriors) – Bill Duffy (BDA Sports) – I had heard back in march that Thompson was a priority for BDA Sports.\n\nAlec Burks (Utah Jazz) – Andy Miller (ASM Sports) – Along with Andy Miller, Justin Zanik and Andrew Vye represent players at ASM Sports.\n\nMarkieff Morris (Phoenix Suns) – Tony Dutt (Rival Sports Group LLC) – I covered the interesting story about Markieff and his brother signing with Dutt and how a man named Jason Martin may have played a big role.\n\nMarcus Morris (Houston Rockets) - Tony Dutt (Rival Sports Group LLC) – Just read the linked story above.\n\nKawhi Leonard (San Antonio Spurs via trade) – Brian Elfus (Impact Sports Management) - Late 2010, Elfus became a part of Impact Sports Management, which has a history of representing a multitude of football players.\n\nNikola Vucevic (Philadelphia 76ers) - Rade Filipovich (BDA Sports)\n\nIman Shumpert (New York Knicks) – Happy Walters (Rogue Sports) – Shumpert joins another Happy Walters client in New York - Amar’e Stoudemire.\n\nChris Singleton (Washington Wizards) – Bill Duffy (BDA Sports) – 3 BDA Sports clients taken in the top 18 picks of the draft.\n\nTobias Harris (Milwaukee Bucks via trade) – Henry Thomas (Creative Artists Agency)\n\nDonatas Motiejunas (Houston Rockets via trade) – Herb Rudoy (Interperformances) – The agency also represents Manu Ginobili and other foreign born players in the NBA.\n\nNolan Smith (Portland Trailblazers) – Joel Bell (Bell Management International)\n\nKenneth Faried (Denver Nuggets) - Thad Foucher (Wasserman Media Group)\n\nNikola Mirotic (Chicago Bulls via trade) – Igor Crespo (Xpheres Basketball Management)\n\nReggie Jackson (Oklahoma City Thunder) - Aaron Mintz (Priority Sports)\n\nMarShon Brooks (New Jersey Nets via trade) – Seth Cohen (Original Creative Representation)\n\nJordan Hamilton (Portland Trailblazers via trade) - Lee Melchionni (Wasserman Media Group)\n\nJaJuan Johnson (Boston Celtics via trade) - Kevin Bradbury (BDA Sports)\n\nNorris Cole (Miami Heat via trade) – Joel Bell (Bell Management International)\n\nCory Joseph (San Antonio Spurs) – Leon Rose (Creative Artists Agency)\n\nJimmy Butler (Chicago Bulls) - Happy Walters (Rogue Sports)\n\nSecond Round\n\nBojan Bogdanovic (Minnesota Timberwolves via trade) – Marc Cornstein (Pinnacle Management)\n\nJustin Harper (Orlando Magic via trade) – Lance Young (Octagon)\n\nKyle Singler (Detroit Pistons) - Greg Lawrence (Wasserman Media Group)\n\nShelvin Mack (Washington Wizards) - Doug Neustadt (The Neustadt Group)\n\nTyler Honeycutt (Sacramento Kings) - Tony Dutt (Rival Sports Group LLC)\n\nJordan Williams (New Jersey Nets) - Andy Miller (ASM Sports)\n\nTrey Thompkins (Los Angeles Clippers) - Arn Tellem (Wasserman Media Group)\n\nChandler Parsons (Houston Rockets) – Mark Bartelstein (Priority Sports) – Go Gators!\n\nJeremy Tyler (Charlotte Bobcats) - Makhtar Ndiaye (Wasserman Media Group)\n\nJon Leuer (Milwaukee Bucks) – Mark Bartelstein (Priority Sports)\n\nDarius Morris (Los Angeles Lakers) – Brian Dyke (Shibumi Sports)\n\nDavis Bertans (San Antonio Spurs via trade) - Marc Fleisher (Entersport)\n\nMalcolm Lee (Chicago Bulls) - Brian Elfus (Impact Sports Management)\n\nCharles Jenkins (Golden State Warriors) – Michael Lindeman (Excel Sports Management)\n\nJosh Harrellson (New York Knicks via trade) – Unknown\n\nAndrew Goudelock (Los Angeles Lakers) – Austin Walton (Walton Sports Management Group)\n\nTravis Leslie (Los Angeles Clippers) - Andrew Vye (ASM Sports)\n\nKeith Benson (Atlanta Hawks) – Leon Rose (Creative Artists Agency)\n\nJosh Selby (Memphis Grizzlies) – Andy Miller (ASM Sports)\n\nLavoy Allen (Philadelphia 76ers) – Happy Walters (Rogue Sports)\n\nJon Diebler (Portland Trailblazers) – Lance Young (Octagon)\n\nVernon Macklin (Detroit Piston) – Lance Young (Octagon)\n\nDeAndre Liggins (Orlando Magic) - Unknown\n\nMilan Macvan (Cleveland Cavaliers) - David Bauman (DB Hoops)\n\nE’Twaun Moore (Boston Celtics) – Mark Bartelstein (Priority Sports)\n\nChukwudiebere Maduabum (Los Angeles Lakers) - Ugo Udezue (BDA Sports)\n\nTanguy Ngombo (Dallas Mavericks) - Bill McCandless (Court Side)\n\nAter Majok (Los Angeles Lakers) - Michael Lelchitski (SIG Sports)\n\nAdam Hanga (San Antonio Spurs) - Alex Saratsis (Octagon)\n\nIsaiah Thomas (Sacramento Kings) – Byron Irvin/Dan Fegan (Lagardere Unlimited)\n\n2011 NBA Draft Listing Of Players Selected And Their Agents from Sports Agent Blog - Sports Agent News, Sports Business, Sports Law, Sports Contract Negotiations, NCAA Rules and Regulations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more posts on Sports Agent Blog »\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
