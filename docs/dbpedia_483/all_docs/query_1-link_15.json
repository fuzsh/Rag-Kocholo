        "text": "Melvin Ejim selected the top Nigerian playing abroad in last week's games\n\nTraditionally, every week we bring you a list of the top performances of Nigerians who are currently playing abroad.\n\nMelvin Ejim\n\n#1. This week's number one is former international forward Melvin Ejim (201-91, agency: BeoBasket, college: Iowa St., currently plays in EuroCup). He was the major contributor in Buducnost's victory against the sixth-ranked Levallois (0-2) 89-83 in the Eurocup on Tuesday night. Ejim scored 16 points and grabbed 5 rebounds in 24 minutes on the court. KK Buducnost Voli Podgorica (2-0) is placed first in group B. But the season just started, so everything may happen. It's Ejim's first year with the team. He has individually a very good season with high stats. Ejim averages: 16.0ppg, 7.0rpg, 3FGP: 66.7% and FT: 88.9% in two games he played so far. He has a dual citizenship: Canadian and Nigerian. Ejim played for the Nigerian senior national team eight years ago.\n\nStan Okoye\n\n#2. Second place goes to an international small forward Stan Okoye (198-91, college: VMI, currently plays in EuroCup). He led his Spanish team Gran Canaria to a victory against the third-ranked JSF Nanterre (1-1) 94-82 in the Eurocup in Wednesday night's game. Okoye scored 13 points. Herbalife Gran Canaria (2-0) is placed first in group D. But the season is still in its first stage and everything can happen. Okoye has relatively good stats this season: 11.5ppg, 3.0rpg, 3FGP: 57.1%. He is another player who holds two passports: Nigerian and American. Okoye played for the Nigerian national team in 2019.\n\nMicheal Eric\n\n#3. The Nigerian player who performed third best last week abroad was an international center Micheal Eric (210-88, college: Temple, currently plays in Turkey). Eric led Turk Telekom to a victory over the 13th-ranked Dacka (0-2) 79-69 in the Turkish BSL on Wednesday night. He was MVP of the game. Eric scored 16 points and grabbed 4 rebounds. Turk Telekom Ankara (1-1) is placed ninth in the BSL. His team will play only one more game in the Regular Season. And that game will be critical. This season Eric has relatively solid stats: 12.5ppg, 5.0rpg, 2FGP: 64.7%(11-17). He played for the Nigerian national team one years ago.\n\nTonye Jekiri\n\n#4. Center Tonye Jekiri (212-94, agency: Network Sports International, college: Miami, FL, currently plays in Spain). He could not help Baskonia to beat UCAM Murcia (2-2). Jekiri recorded 6 points. His team was defeated 83-75 at home by the much lower-ranked UCAM Murcia (#9). It's Jekiri's first season with the team. He has reliable stats this year: 12.8ppg, 6.3rpg and 1.3apg. Jekiri used to play for the Nigerian national team last year.\n\nObi Emegano\n\n#5. International guard Obi Emegano (189-93, college: ORU, currently plays in Spain) was not able to help Baloncesto Fuenlabrada in their last game. Despite his very good performance his team was edged 82-81 in a derby game by the lower-ranked (#6) Movil Estudiantes. Emegano was the second best scorer with 15 points in 25 minutes. Emegano's stats this year are: 13.3ppg, 2.0rpg and 2.0spg in three games. He has both Nigerian and British nationalities. Emegano used to play for the Nigerian national team last year.\n\nAbdullahi Kuso\n\n#6. An experienced forward Abdullahi Kuso (206-84, college: Tallahassee, currently plays in Japan) was not able to secure a victory for Cyberdyne Ibaraki Robots (0-2) in their game against Gunma (2-0) in the Japanese B2 League. He cannot count Saturday's game as one of the best ones. Kuso recorded only 2 points and grabbed 7 rebounds in 21 minutes. The seventh-placed Cyberdyne Ibaraki Robots (0-2) were badly defeated 90-71 on the road by the leading Gunma in the East group. But the season is still in its first stage and everything can happen. This year Kuso's overall stats are: 1.5ppg, 5.0rpg and 1.5apg in two games. He is a former international player as he played for the Nigerian senior team thirteen years ago.\n\nThe list of other players, who all have Nigerian passport but never been selected to any of Nigerian national teams:\n\n#1. Michael Fakuade (201-F-89, agency: Slash Sports, college: UIS, currently plays in Poland) led Wilki Morskie to a victory over one of league's weakest teams Polpharma (1-5) 88-80 in the Polish EBL in Friday night's game. He was MVP of the game. Fakuade scored 24 points, grabbed 7 boards, handed out 4 passes and blocked 2 shots in 34 minutes. King Szczecin (5-2) is placed fourth in the EBL. But this is still an early stage of the season and everything may happen. It's Fakuade's first year with the team. He has individually a very good season with high stats. Fakuade averages: 15.3ppg, 6.5rpg, 2.5apg and 1.5bpg in four games he played so far. He has a dual citizenship: Nigerian and American.\n\n#2. O.D. Anosike (203-F/C-91, college: Siena, currently plays in Mexico) was the main contributor in a Fuerza Regia's victory against the leader Mineros (8-3) 79-74 in the Mexican LNBP (second division) last Saturday. Anosike was MVP of the game. He recorded a double-double by scoring 23 points and getting 13 rebounds. Fuerza Regia Monterrey (3-5) is placed fifth in East group. It was his team's third consecutive victory in a row. It's Anosike's first season with the team. This year Anosike has very high stats. He averages: 16.5ppg, 11.5rpg, 1.2apg and 1.2spg.

He scored 6 points, grabbed 6 rebounds and dished 3 assists in 25 minutes. Allianz Pallacanestro Trieste (2-1) is placed first in Group C. But the season is still in its first stage and everything can happen. It's Udanoh's first year with the team. This season Udanoh's overall stats are: 7.0ppg, 6.0rpg, 2.0apg and 1.5spg in two games. He has both American and Nigerian nationalities.\n\n#4. Christian Mekowulu (206-F-95, college: Texas A&M, currently plays in Italy) could not help Treviso (3-3) in their last game.

Mekowulu was the top scorer with 17 points (was perfect 7-for-7 from the free throw line) in 27 minutes; quite an impressive performance considering it's only his second season in pro basketball. But the season is still in its first stage and everything can happen. It's Mekowulu's first year with the team. Mekowulu has reliable stats this season: 12.5ppg and 4.5rpg in two games. Worth to mention Mekowulu played also at Eurobasket Summer League, which helped him get the job in pro basketball.\n\n#5. Derek Ogbeide (203-F-97, college: Georgia, currently plays in Cyprus) contributed to a AEK Larnaca's victory against one of league's weakest teams Keravnos (0-1) 69-65 in the Cypriot OPAP Basket League last Saturday. He was the best player in that game. Ogbeide recorded a double-double by scoring 16 points and getting 11 rebounds. It was his first game for AEK Larnaca this season; not bad, considering it's only his second season in pro basketball. His team is placed first in the OPAP Basket League. But the season is still in its first stage and everything can happen. Ogbeide also holds two passports: Canadian and Nigerian.\n\n#6. Martins Igbanu (203-F-97, college: Tulsa, currently plays in Serbia) helped Mladost ZE win their game against the 14th-ranked Kolubara 103-84 in the Serbian KLS on Sunday night.

It was his first game for Ternopil-TNEU this season.\n\n#8. Anthony Elechi (203-F-93, college: Morehead St., currently plays in Norway) helped Tromso win their game against the closely-ranked Centrum 80-74 in the Norwegian BLNO last Sunday.
