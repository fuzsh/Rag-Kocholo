        "text": "Publish date: 2024-07-18\n\nTable of Biography\n\nJaVale McGee is an amazing professional basketball player for the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). JaVale McGee also was in the game of college basketball for the Nevada Wolf Pack.\n\nEarly Life and Childhood\n\nJavale McGee was born on January 19, 1988, and his birthplace is Flint, Michigan. He is an American by nationality. Likewise, his age is 36 years old. There is no more information about his family, childhood, etc. Regarding JaVale McGeeâs education, he previously joined 2 high schools in Michigan, Detroit Country Day School, and Providence Christian, before moving to Hales Franciscan High School, Chicago. In the Hales Franciscan coach Gary Londonâs opinion, McGeeâs position in college was a little forward, and he could play 2 forward positions.\n\nHe was the beginning center for the University of Nevada. After McGeeâs sophomore campaign, in which he scored 14.3 points and 7.3 rebounds, shooting 53% from the field and 33% from the three-point range, McGee decided to recruit an agent and announce for the 2008 NBA draft.\n\nCareer and Professional Life\n\nAt first, JaVale was chosen eighteenth by the Wizards in the 2008 NBA draft. On July 9, 2008, he made a deal of 2 years, a $2.4 million contract with the Wizards. McGee had to give a fine of $10 K by the Wizards for taking part in Gilbert Arenasâ antics on January 9, 2010, before a match on January 5, 2010, in which the opposite team was the Philadelphia 76ers. On January 6, 2011, McGee again was able to take part in the 2011 NBA Slam Dunk Contest. McGee was the 1st Wizard to ever take part there. Unfortunately, he lost to Blake Griffin. McGee was also the 1st player to use three balls at the same time in a dunk contest. The Guinness World Records also was mentioning him as the most basketballs dunked in one jump.\n\nIn a 98â79 loss to the Chicago Bulls on March 15, 2011. His career-high twelve blocks were the most since Keon Clark had 12 on March 23, 2001. However, he got some disapproval for taking ill-advised shots in the 4th quarter to make sure that he would score ten points while his group was being blown out, and also got a technical foul for the excessive celebration by pulling himself on the rim after a dunk for his last points. TV commentator Kevin McHale said it was a âbad triple-doubleâ. In reply, McGee said, âI got a triple-double. Who can say they got a triple-double? Iâm not worried about itâ. At the time of the 2011 NBA lockout, NBPA leaders met with around thirty players on October 14.\n\nFurtherâ¦\n\nJaVale quit the meeting early and told reporters there were several players âsaying that theyâre ready to foldâ, but most of them were together. Later he disagreed quoting that players were ready to fold, but his comment was recorded by reporters. Derek Fisher said McGee had âno ability to make that statementâ based on the limited time he spent at the meeting. On March 15, 2012, McGee was traded to the Nuggets together with Ronny Turiaf in an exception that dispatched NenÃª to the Wizards. As a part of the Wizards, he began 40 of 41 games in which he was present; with the Nuggets, he would begin in 5 of 20 games in which he was present.

McGeeâs series-high was 21 points in Game 5 against 1st-round opposite Los Angeles Lakers. McGeeâs numbers were up and down in the series. On July 18, 2012, McGee again signed with the Nuggets on a 4-year, $44 million contract. His 2013â14 season was completed on February 20, 2014, when he had surgery to fix a stress fracture in his left tibia which he underwent on November 8, 2013.
