        "text": "Sasha Kaun made the most of his one year in the NBA.\n\nThe Russian-born Florida Air (now-Florida Prep) Academy graduate collected an NBA championship ring as a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers this past season, and now he’s decided to retire.\n\nThe 31-year-old’s trophy case is impressive.\n\nIn 2004, he led Florida Air to a high school state title, with the team finishing 23-0.\n\nHe went on to play four years of college basketball at Kansas, where he helped the Jayhawks win a national championship in 2008.\n\nKaun was drafted 56th overall in the 2008 NBA Draft by the Seattle SuperSonics. He was the final draft pick in Sonics history, before the franchise moved to Oklahoma City. His NBA draft rights were then traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers for cash considerations.\n\nHowever, he ultimately decided to sign with Russian team CSKA Moscow, where he helped the team win five VTB League championships from 2008-2015.\n\nHe also helped Russia win a bronze medal in the 2012 Olympics.\n\nIn September 2015, he signed with the Cavs and debuted on Oct. 28. He appeared in 25 games for Cleveland. While he was on the active roster during the postseason, the 6-foot-11 backup center did not play during the 2016 playoffs.\n\nRegardless, he now has an NBA championship to add to his trophy case.\n\nKaun and Cavs teammate Tomofey Mozgov became the first Russian players in NBA history to win an NBA championship.\n\nOn July 15, just four weeks after winning the title, the Cavs traded Kaun along with cash considerations to Philadelphia for the rights to forward Chukwudiebere Maduabum. However, his playing days in Philly are over before they ever got started."
