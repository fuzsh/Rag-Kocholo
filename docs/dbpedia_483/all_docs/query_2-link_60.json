        "text": "Consider this the preparation before the preparation.\n\nEventually — and we don’t have an idea of when yet — the NBA will hold the draft. The Raptors will pick somewhere late in the first round and again somewhere late in the second round. If the season is over, they’ll pick 28th and 58th, and probably not much higher even if it’s not. We might as well use the extra time afforded by the league’s hiatus to start looking at potential draft picks.\n\nAnd we’ll do that, soon. The extra downtime has allowed me, personally, to go a little deeper on draft prep than I was able to the last two years, when the Raptors either won a championship less than two weeks before the draft or didn’t have a pick to prep for at all. Before we get into individual players, though, it feels necessary to frame the process through the lens of the Raptors’ front office and general approach to roster building.\n\nThe draft has been a relative strength of the Raptors during this era, at least when they’ve had picks. Since 2015, every pick they’ve made has produced at least rotation-calibre contributions (save for injured rookie Dewan Hernandez), and the front office has supplemented those with a few key undrafted signings. The Raptors haven’t picked a lot, though, meaning we’re revisiting a deep draft preparation process for the first time in a few years. This is the first time since 2017 they own their own first-round pick and the first time since 2016 they hold multiple picks. It certainly makes for a more exciting draft prep season than in 2018 (no picks) or 2019 (the No. 59 pick).\n\nNext week, we’ll check in on the state of the franchise with former NBA executive and The Athletic’s national NBA writer John Hollinger, and then I’ll outline how I approach the draft (and how I think the Raptors will approach it). Beginning the week of May 18, we’ll start going deeper on a few prospects at a time, so that come draft time — whenever that might be — we’ve got a good base.\n\nFirst run with Raptors\n\nThe credit or blame tend to fall on the general manager and/or team president when it comes to draft picks. That’s part of the job description, and in most cases, even collaborative front offices see the final decision in the hands of their most powerful members. Still, it could be helpful to look at Ujiri’s time in the Raptors’ front office in a supporting role, in which he would have had input as a key scouting and player personnel figure. It should also be noted assistant GM and vice president of player personnel, Dan Tolzman, who came with Ujiri to Toronto from the Nuggets, has also played a significant role in the draft.\n\n2008 (director of global scouting)\n\nActivity: Traded No. 17 pick (Roy Hibbert), acquired No. 41 pick (Nathan Jawai), had previously dealt No. 45 pick\n\nAfter four years as an international scout with the Nuggets, Ujiri was hired by Bryan Colangelo in 2007 as the Raptors’ director of global scouting. While Colangelo traded away their first-round pick as part of the Jermaine O’Neal package, the Raptors received the No. 41 pick in return, which they used on Australian big man Nathan Jawai. “Aussie Shaq” only appeared in six games with the Raptors and 45 in the NBA overall but has had a solid international career, winning several European cups and spending four years at the EuroLeague level. He remains active in the Australian NBL. This is about a median outcome for a mid-second round pick in this time period, with Goran Dragic (No. 45) standing out as the only what-if player selected later.\n\n2009 (assistant general manager, player personnel)\n\nActivity: Selected DeMar DeRozan with No. 9 pick, had previously dealt No. 39 pick\n\nI’d say this pick worked out pretty well for the Raptors. Only two players selected after DeRozan have been an All-Star (Jrue Holiday and Jeff Teague), and he’s one of just four players from his class to reach All-NBA status. He became the face of the franchise and one of the Raptors’ most beloved players, and he has produced the fourth-most win shares from his class. While DeRozan proved to be the stylistic bottleneck for postseason success, he helped build the cultural foundation in Toronto and rose to high enough heights to bring back Kawhi Leonard in a trade. Not bad for a pick who wasn’t particularly well received at the time.\n\n2010 (assistant general manager, player personnel)\n\nActivity: Selected Ed Davis with No. 13 pick, acquired No. 50 pick (Solomon Alabi), had previously dealt No. 42 pick\n\nThe strange thing about the Alabi pick wasn’t that a team would roll the dice on a 7-foot-1 international player late in the second round. It was that the Raptors brought him over to the NBA immediately. The draft-and-stash was far more common at the time and the Raptors didn’t have their own D-League affiliate, meaning his development was spread across garbage time, Erie, Bakersfield and one big opportunity in The Ben Uzoh Game. Davis was just a solid pick in a thin draft — he’s produced the ninth-most win shares as the 13th pick, with only Eric Bledsoe (No. 18) and Hassan Whiteside (No. 33, and out of the league before figuring things out) outperforming him from a later draft slot.\n\nDenver Nuggets tenure\n\nOn the eve of the 2010-11 season, Ujiri was hired as the general manager and executive vice president of basketball operations for the Nuggets. Ujiri’s 2013 Executive of the Year award was built more on trade than anything, particularly with how he navigated Denver through the Carmelo Anthony trade and post-Anthony era. He supplemented those deals with some sharp drafting, too.\n\n2011\n\nActivity: Selected Kenneth Faried with No. 22 pick, acquired No. 26 pick (Jordan Hamilton), had previously dealt No. 52 pick, acquired No. 56 pick (Chukwudiebere Maduabum)\n\nAlmost immediately, a few trends emerge: Ujiri’s willingness to take late-draft fliers on international picks (Maduabaum is Nigerian) has carried over to Toronto; his willingness to give second chances gets a base (Hamilton was later brought to Toronto to compete for a roster spot); and “should the Raptors trade for Faried” is born (I, meanwhile, die a little inside). Faried’s time in the NBA might have come to a close, but only two players selected after him have produced more win shares (Jimmy Butler at No. 30 and Isaiah Thomas at No. 60) and Faried’s inability to progress his game might have cost him a spot as a top-10 pick. Hamilton stuck around the NBA for a bit, while “Chu Chu” — the third player ever to be selected out of the D-League — never progressed past that point in North America.\n\n2012\n\nActivity: Selected Evan Fournier with No. 22 pick, Quincy Miller with previously acquired No. 38 pick and Izzet Turkyilmaz with No. 50 pick\n\nThis played out almost exactly the same as 2011, with Ujiri landing a very good player in the 20s, using a mid-draft pick on a wing project who didn’t work out and stashing a late pick overseas. Landing Faried and Fournier in consecutive rounds — while adding Danilo Gallinari in the Anthony trade — set the Nuggets up well enough to land Ujiri his front office award and put him firmly on the radar of other teams. That he hadn’t had a ton of success with later picks hardly mattered to this point since he’d found a pair of lottery-level producers and because, well, most late picks don’t amount to much.\n\nThat weird 2013 draft\n\nThe Raptors hired Ujiri away from Denver on May 31, meaning he was at the head of the Raptors’ table for the draft after leading Denver through most of the process. The Raptors didn’t have any picks due to the Kyle Lowry and Rudy Gay acquisitions, while the Nuggets traded back from No. 27 to No. 46 (Erick Green) and grabbed my alleged doppelganger Joffrey Lauvergne at No. 55. It’s hard to evaluate Ujiri in a transition draft.\n\nReturn to Raptors\n\n2014\n\nActivity: Selected Bruno Caboclo with No. 20 pick, selected DeAndre Daniels with previously acquired No. 37 pick, had previously dealt No. 48 pick, sold previously acquired No. 59 pick\n\nLet it be said here first: Eric Koreen is sometimes bad and wrong. For example, he called the Caboclo pick the Raptors’ worst pick of the decade. It wasn’t even their worst pick of this draft. The timing and execution of the Caboclo pick are fair game for criticism — it likely looks better with a D-League team in place or a draft-and-stash season — but at least there was a pretty clear idea in mind for what Caboclo could be and what a long-term development project would look like in the modern NBA. And Caboclo eventually became a fringe rotation-calibre player for Memphis. The Daniels pick puzzled from the outset and he’s bounced between solid Australian leaguer to mediocre G Leaguer to second-division Italian leaguer to however we evaluate guys in Finland.\n\nThis draft stands out as particularly bad because it’s in such stark contrast to Ujiri’s history and because Rodney Hood and Clint Capela, capable rotation players, went off the board soon after each of the Raptors’ two picks, followed by Spencer Dinwiddie, Jerami Grant and Nikola Jokic.\n\n2015\n\nActivity: Selected Delon Wright with No. 20 pick, acquired No. 46 pick (Norman Powell), had previously dealt No. 50 pick\n\nWright has produced the 10th-most win shares from this class so far despite seeing ample time in the D-League, dealing with a major shoulder injury and competing with Cory Joseph and then Fred VanVleet for backup minutes behind an All-Star point guard. That he isn’t still a part of Toronto’s core speaks more to VanVleet’s ascension than anything, as Wright is a high-end backup or even a fringe starter in the right lineup. He also helped land Marc Gasol, which isn’t nothing. Powell, meanwhile, is 15th in win shares in the group but reached an offensive level this season that maybe only a half-dozen other players in this draft have. To land a pair of lottery-level producers in the same draft without a lottery pick is great work and was a sign of things to come.\n\n2016\n\nActivity: Selected Jakob Poeltl with previously acquired No. 9 pick, selected Pascal Siakam with No. 27 pick, had previously dealt No. 57 pick, signed VanVleet as undrafted free agent\n\nVanVleet throws a bit of a wrench into how we evaluate things. Do Ujiri and company get credit on their draft record because VanVleet was an undrafted free agent, or does that rely too much on the actions of others, including VanVleet himself, when second-round overtures were made? It’s the old Draymond Green/Tom Brady thing — if the teams really knew they’d be that good, why would they have waited so late to take them? I’m inclined to give the Raptors credit since they didn’t have a second-round pick and nailed their two earlier picks. VanVleet ranks seventh in the draft class in win shares and, thanks to his bet on himself, ranks fifth in career earnings to date.\n\nThe other picks are straightforward. Poeltl was viewed as a bit of a safe pick and has spent his four seasons primarily deployed as a steady backup centre. Despite that somewhat humble role definition, Poeltl’s performance — including major statistical steps forward across the board this year — rank him sixth in the class in win shares produced. That was intriguing enough to make him a key piece of the Leonard package.\n\nSiakam, meanwhile, is one of the best picks in recent NBA history. While the Raptors will admit they didn’t see a max contract player coming, they’ve encouraged his development with a growth mindset and why-not attitude. Siakam’s tireless work ethic and truly unique development curve have vaulted him to where he ranks behind only Ben Simmons in win shares from that year and will rank among the best late-first round picks ever eventually.\n\n2017\n\nActivity: Selected OG Anunoby with No. 23 pick, had previously dealt lesser of two firsts (No. 25), had previously dealt No. 54 pick\n\nThe sexy blogger pick or, depending on your feelings for me, the sexy-blogger pick. Once he slid this far, so long as there was faith in the medicals, it was very difficult to pass on the upside. Anunoby ranks sixth in his class in win shares produced and could be headed for an All-Defense nod in Year 3. What’s more, he was on the younger end of prospects in that draft despite being a sophomore, giving him plenty of runway to keep improving.\n\n2018\n\nActivity: Had previously dealt No. 29 and No. 59 picks, as well as previously acquired No. 40 pick\n\nThe cost of unloading DeMarre Carroll’s contract and landing P.J. Tucker are apparent. What’s more, the Raptors’ initial post-draft signing of the undrafted Rawle Alkins saw him back out and sign with the Bulls after a miscommunication and agent change. The Raptors’ big find was instead Chris Boucher, who fought his way to a two-way deal after being waived by the Warriors following his injury rehab rookie season.\n\n2019\n\nActivity: Had previously dealt No. 29 pick, selected Dewan Hernandez with No. 59 pick, signed Terence Davis II and Oshae Brissett as undrafted free agents\n\nWe once again get into the question of undrafted free agent success. There is obvious credit to be given to the Raptors for talent identification and player development, but it’s unclear if those finds should go in the draft column. With only the No. 59 pick, the Raptors more or less had to thrive in the undrafted pool, and that they were able to land four players they considered with the pick — Hernandez, Davis, Brissett and Shamorie Ponds — makes it feel like the entire group should be considered co-No. 59 picks. It’s much too early to make judgments, but Davis performed like a top-10 rookie and Brissett is receiving love as an under-the-radar restricted free agent target.\n\nTakeaways\n\nIt takes a pretty long run of success to definitively determine the amount of skill involved in drafting. On one extreme, there are Sam Hinkie types who (to loosely paraphrase) believe it’s inexact enough that maximizing chances is the most effective strategy. The blurring between talent identification and player development makes it even more difficult.\n\nIn Ujiri’s case, it would appear his front offices have displayed at least some ability to beat their draft slot. You just can’t hit on five quality rotation players (or better) in the 20s over the span of eight years without giving that impression. What’s more, 14 of the 21 picks made by Ujiri’s front offices have outperformed their draft slot by win shares, and of the seven who didn’t, two were low-percentage draft-and-stash types.\n\nIf you’re looking for trends, well, the samples are small, but a few things stand out. Four of the seven players who didn’t outperform their slot were long-winged forwards, but those also represent some of the successes. It seems, then, that Ujiri might just see a high value in that archetype and be willing to chase the upside. More broadly, I wouldn’t say Ujiri’s groups have had a preference for that, necessarily, but they certainly haven’t been scared off by players with lesser shooting pedigrees or overaged prospects. They also haven’t really drafted on need, with rookies often entering the season in open competition for rotation opportunities.\n\nThose are helpful things to keep in mind as we begin looking at specific prospects who will be tagged with strengths and weaknesses. The growth mindset of the Raptors’ player development process is an important one that might require us to reframe weaknesses within their developmental context, or at least approach with a longer-term lens. There’s no uniform “Ujiri player” who presents himself through 21 picks across 12 seasons, but you wouldn’t expect there to be, or the league would catch up.\n\nIt also warrants mentioning given the cap and roster uncertainty that Ujiri has not been hesitant to deal or acquire draft picks or make draft-night moves. We’ll approach the next few months looking at picks in the late 20s and late 50s, but we’ll want to keep the entire prospect pool in mind.\n\nAs a reminder, we’ll check in with Hollinger on the state of the franchise next week, and I’ll share my pre-draft process from more of a philosophical position. After that we’ll begin diving into prospect profiles group by group. Sound off in the comments if there are any specific prospects you’d like a closer look at.\n\n(Photo: Brad Penner / USA Today)"
