He played college basketball for the Nevada Wolf Pack. In the 2008 NBA Draft, he was selected eighteenth overall by the Washington Wizards. Since entering the NBA, McGee has been known for his eccentric playing style which resulted in uncommon plays. He is a three–time NBA champion, having won consecutive titles with the Golden State Warriors in 2017 and 2018 before winning a third title with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020. The son of Olympic gold medalist Pamela McGee, he won a gold medal with the 2020 U.S. Olympic team.\n\nHigh school and college career[]\n\nMcGee was born in Flint, Michigan, and attended two high schools in Michigan, Detroit Country Day School and Providence Christian, before transferring to Hales Franciscan High School in Chicago, Illinois According to Hales Franciscan coach Gary London, McGee's natural position in college was ideally Small Forward, and he could play both Forward spots. McGee was the starting Center for the University of Nevada. After his sophomore campaign, in which he averaged 14.3 points and 7.3 rebounds, shooting 53% from the field and 33% from three–point range, McGee decided to hire an agent and declare for the 2008 NBA Draft.\n\nProfessional career[]\n\nWashington Wizards (2008–2012)[]\n\nMcGee was selected 18th overall by the Wizards in the 2008 NBA Draft. On July 9, 2008, he signed a two–year, $2.4 million deal with the Wizards.\n\nOn January 9, 2010, McGee was fined $10,000 by the Wizards for participating in Gilbert Arenas' antics before a game on January 5, 2010, against the Philadelphia 76ers. Arenas was being investigated for a prior incident involving guns in the Wizards' locker room, but made light of the accusations by pointing his finger at his teammates, as if he were shooting them. His teammates were photographed smiling and laughing with him.\n\nOn January 6, 2011, McGee was chosen to participate in the 2011 NBA Slam Dunk Contest. McGee was the first Wizard to ever participate in the contest. He finished in second place, losing to Blake Griffin. McGee was the first player to use three balls at one time in a dunk contest, which was later cited by the Guinness World Records as the most basketballs dunked in a single jump. The third ball was passed to him from teammate John Wall.\n\nOn March 15, 2011, in a 98–79 loss against the Chicago Bulls, McGee notched his first career triple–double, recording 11 points, 12 rebounds, and 12 blocks. His career-high 12 blocks was the most since Keon Clark had 12 on March 23, 2001. However, he received some criticism for taking ill–advised shots in the fourth quarter to ensure he reached 10 points while his team was being blown out, and even received a technical foul for excessive celebration by pulling himself on the rim after a dunk for his final points. Television commentator Kevin McHale called it a \"bad triple–double\". In response to the criticism, McGee said, \"I got a triple–double. Who can say they got a triple–double? I'm not really worried about it.\".\n\nDuring the 2011 NBA lockout, NBPA leaders met with around 30 players on October 14 and stressed unity. McGee left the meeting early and told reporters there were some players \"saying that they're ready to fold\", but the majority was united. McGee later denied mentioning that players were ready to fold, but his comment was recorded by reporters. Derek Fisher said McGee had \"no ability to make that statement\" based on the limited time he spent at the meeting.\n\nMcGee averaged over 10 points and eight rebounds in 2010–11 and 2011–12 with the Wizards\n\nDenver Nuggets (2012–2015)[]\n\nOn March 15, 2012, McGee was traded to the Nuggets along with Ronny Turiaf in a deal that sent Nenê to the Wizards.

His minutes would also be reduced, averaging 27.4 with Washington, but 20.6 with Denver. On March 21, in his Nuggets debut, McGee made the game–winning dunk off an Arron Afflalo missed free throw with 5 seconds left on the clock. At the end of the regular season, the Nuggets earned the West's sixth seed, and McGee appeared in the 2012 NBA Playoffs, which was his first playoff appearance in his career. McGee's series–high was 21 points in Game 5 against first–round opponent Los Angeles Lakers. McGee's numbers were up and down throughout the series, including Game 7, when he scored just 6 points on 1–7 shooting in 32 minutes of floor time.

He missed seven games in December due to a respiratory infection. On March 22, 2019, he had career highs of 33 points and 20 rebounds along with six blocked shots in a 111–106 loss to the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nDuring the 2019–20 season, McGee played in 68 games and averaged 6.6 points and 5.7 rebounds in 16.6 minutes per game.

McGee played with Team USA in a scrimmage at Radio City Music Hall during the 2010 World Basketball Festival, but after an uneven performance he did not play in the team's scrimmage against China at Madison Square Garden and was cut on August 15, 2010.\n\nMcGee visited the Philippines twice during the 2011 NBA lockout, first in exhibition games with NBA stars against players from the Philippine Basketball Association and the Smart Gilas national team, and then in a basketball clinic. Later that year, he expressed his interest in playing for the Philippine national team, and in 2012, a bill was filed for his Filipino citizenship to make him eligible to play for Smart Gilas. In 2014, McGee was asked again by the Gilas Pilipinas to take part as a naturalized player for the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup in Spain. However, national teams were limited to one naturalized player apiece, and former Wizards teammate Andray Blatche made the World Cup team after he was granted citizenship.\n\nOn July 16, 2021 McGee and Forward Keldon Johnson of the San Antonio Spurs were announced as replacements for Bradley Beal and Kevin Love on the 2020 U.S. Olympic team. On August 7, he won an Olympic gold medal after United States defeated France in the final. With the medal, he and his mother, Pamela McGee, became the first mother and son to win gold medals in Olympic history.\n\nPhilanthropy[]\n\nIn 2013, McGee started Juglife Foundation, an organization that brings awareness of drinking water and hydration. He has hosted celebrity softball games involving his NBA colleagues. Juglife has partnered with Hope 4 Kids International in building wells in Uganda.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nMcGee's father, 6–foot–10–inch (2.08 m) George Montgomery, was a 1985 NBA Draft second–round selection by the Portland Trail Blazers, though he did not play for the team. His mother, 6–foot–3–inch (1.91 m) Pamela McGee, was a University of Southern California standout, playing with her twin sister, Paula, with them, joined by Cheryl Miller, winning two NCAA Division One championships, in 1983 and 1984. That had followed two Michigan State championships at Northern Flint High School. She won an Olympic gold medal in 1984. Besides playing in France, Italy and Brazil, she was drafted in the 1997 WNBA Draft by the Sacramento Monarchs. She starred for the Los Angeles Sparks and Sacramento Monarchs. McGee is the first son of a WNBA player to ever play in the NBA. His younger half-sister, Imani McGee-Stafford, also plays in the WNBA for the Atlanta Dream. His mother, with a degree in economics, balanced her international basketball career with raising both children, homeschooling, coaching, and teaching school in the offseason, though the formidable tasks were not without controversy. McGee is also cousins with former NFL defensive end Jarron Gilbert.\n\nIn 2013, it was announced that McGee would be starring in his own reality television show, Mom's Got Game, with his mother.
