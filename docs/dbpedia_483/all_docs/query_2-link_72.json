        "text": "Other than a couple kids from Kentucky (Josh Harrellson and DeAndre Liggins), the following is a comprehensive list of players selected along with their agents of record. Do not pay too much attention to the teams listed, as a lot will change based on trades. Based on the information that is listed below, BDA Sports, Octagon, and Creative Artists Agency each had 5 clients selected. Priority Sports and ASM Sports each had 4 clients selected. The real winner was Wasserman Media Group, with involvement in the representation of 7 player selected. 30 players were selected from the 6 agencies listed above, accounting for exactly half of the entire draft.\n\nFirst Round\n\nKyrie Irving (Cleveland Cavaliers) – Jeff Wechsler (24-7 Sports Management) – This is the first client of Wechsler’s to be drafted #1 overall. However, Wechsler is no stranger to having 1st round clients. He represents Larry Hughes, D.J. White, Quentin Richardson, Mike Sweetney, and used to represent Penny Hardaway – all of whom were selected in the 1st round.\n\nDerrick Williams (Minnesota Timberwolves) – Rob Pelinka (Landmark Sports Agency) – Pelinka has a lot of talented clients, none larger than Kobe Bryant. However, he also represents names like Carlos Boozer, Wesley Johnson, James Harden, Derek Fisher, and Andre Iguodala.\n\nEnes Kanter (Utah Jazz) – Max Ergul – Not much info on Max Ergul; however, he does represent former Milwaukee Bucks forward Ersan Ilyasova.\n\nTristan Thompson (Cleveland Cavaliers) – Leon Rose (Creative Artist Agency) – Leon Rose and CAA happen to represent another former #4 overall pick named Chris Paul. The agency also represents LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Dwyane Wade.\n\nJonas Valanciunas (Toronto Raptors) – Sarunas Broga (East Players) w/CAA – All of Broga’s clients listed on his FIBA page were born in Lithuania.\n\nJan Veseley (Washington Wizards) – Aleksandar Raskovic w/Arn Tellem – Raskovic is said to be working with Wasserman Media Group to represent Veseley in negotiations.\n\nBismack Biyombo (Charlotte Bobcats via trade) – Igor Crespo (Xpheres Basketball Management) – 6th international player taken in the 1st 7 picks of the draft.\n\nBrandon Knight (Detroit Pistons) – Arn Tellem (Wasserman Media Group) – I wonder if Knight will get along with Tracy McGrady, who is also a Tellem client.\n\nKemba Walker (Charlotte Bobcats) – Jeff Schwartz (Excel Sports Management) – This is the same company that recently hired Casey Close and is quickly developing a very powerful baseball division.\n\nJimmer Fredette (Sacramento Kings via trade) – Jeff Austin (Octagon) – The crew at Octagon did a tremendous job boosting the marketability of an already marketable Fredette. Let’s see what they can do with him once he is in the NBA.\n\nKlay Thompson (Golden State Warriors) – Bill Duffy (BDA Sports) – I had heard back in march that Thompson was a priority for BDA Sports.\n\nAlec Burks (Utah Jazz) – Andy Miller (ASM Sports) – Along with Andy Miller, Justin Zanik and Andrew Vye represent players at ASM Sports.\n\nMarkieff Morris (Phoenix Suns) – Tony Dutt (Rival Sports Group LLC) – I covered the interesting story about Markieff and his brother signing with Dutt and how a man named Jason Martin may have played a big role.\n\nMarcus Morris (Houston Rockets) – Tony Dutt (Rival Sports Group LLC) – Just read the linked story above.\n\nKawhi Leonard (San Antonio Spurs via trade) – Brian Elfus (Impact Sports Management) – Late 2010, Elfus became a part of Impact Sports Management, which has a history of representing a multitude of football players.\n\nNikola Vucevic (Philadelphia 76ers) – Rade Filipovich (BDA Sports)\n\nIman Shumpert (New York Knicks) – Happy Walters (Rogue Sports) – Shumpert joins another Happy Walters client in New York – Amar’e Stoudemire.\n\nChris Singleton (Washington Wizards) – Bill Duffy (BDA Sports) – 3 BDA Sports clients taken in the top 18 picks of the draft.\n\nTobias Harris (Milwaukee Bucks via trade) – Henry Thomas (Creative Artists Agency)\n\nDonatas Motiejunas (Houston Rockets via trade) – Herb Rudoy (Interperformances) – The agency also represents Manu Ginobili and other foreign born players in the NBA.\n\nNolan Smith (Portland Trailblazers) – Joel Bell (Bell Management International)\n\nKenneth Faried (Denver Nuggets) – Thad Foucher (Wasserman Media Group)\n\nNikola Mirotic (Chicago Bulls via trade) – Igor Crespo (Xpheres Basketball Management)\n\nReggie Jackson (Oklahoma City Thunder) – Aaron Mintz (Priority Sports)\n\nMarShon Brooks (New Jersey Nets via trade) – Seth Cohen (Original Creative Representation)\n\nJordan Hamilton (Portland Trailblazers via trade) – Lee Melchionni (Wasserman Media Group)\n\nJaJuan Johnson (Boston Celtics via trade) – Kevin Bradbury (BDA Sports)\n\nNorris Cole (Miami Heat via trade) – Joel Bell (Bell Management International)\n\nCory Joseph (San Antonio Spurs) – Leon Rose (Creative Artists Agency)\n\nJimmy Butler (Chicago Bulls) – Happy Walters (Rogue Sports)\n\nSecond Round\n\nBojan Bogdanovic (Minnesota Timberwolves via trade) – Marc Cornstein (Pinnacle Management)\n\nJustin Harper (Orlando Magic via trade) – Lance Young (Octagon)\n\nKyle Singler (Detroit Pistons) – Greg Lawrence (Wasserman Media Group)\n\nShelvin Mack (Washington Wizards) – Doug Neustadt (The Neustadt Group)\n\nTyler Honeycutt (Sacramento Kings) – Tony Dutt (Rival Sports Group LLC)\n\nJordan Williams (New Jersey Nets) – Andy Miller (ASM Sports)\n\nTrey Thompkins (Los Angeles Clippers) – Arn Tellem (Wasserman Media Group)\n\nChandler Parsons (Houston Rockets) – Mark Bartelstein (Priority Sports) – Go Gators!\n\nJeremy Tyler (Charlotte Bobcats) – Makhtar Ndiaye (Wasserman Media Group)\n\nJon Leuer (Milwaukee Bucks) – Mark Bartelstein (Priority Sports)\n\nDarius Morris (Los Angeles Lakers) – Brian Dyke (Shibumi Sports)\n\nDavis Bertans (San Antonio Spurs via trade) – Marc Fleisher (Entersport)\n\nMalcolm Lee (Chicago Bulls) – Brian Elfus (Impact Sports Management)\n\nCharles Jenkins (Golden State Warriors) – Michael Lindeman (Excel Sports Management)\n\nJosh Harrellson (New York Knicks via trade) – Merle Scott (United Worldwide Sports and Entertainment)\n\nAndrew Goudelock (Los Angeles Lakers) – Austin Walton (Walton Sports Management Group)\n\nTravis Leslie (Los Angeles Clippers) – Andrew Vye (ASM Sports)\n\nKeith Benson (Atlanta Hawks) – Leon Rose (Creative Artists Agency)\n\nJosh Selby (Memphis Grizzlies) – Andy Miller (ASM Sports)\n\nLavoy Allen (Philadelphia 76ers) – Happy Walters (Rogue Sports)\n\nJon Diebler (Portland Trailblazers) – Lance Young (Octagon)\n\nVernon Macklin (Detroit Piston) – Lance Young (Octagon)\n\nDeAndre Liggins (Orlando Magic) – Unknown\n\nMilan Macvan (Cleveland Cavaliers) – David Bauman (DB Hoops)\n\nE’Twaun Moore (Boston Celtics) – Mark Bartelstein (Priority Sports)\n\nChukwudiebere Maduabum (Los Angeles Lakers) – Ugo Udezue (BDA Sports)\n\nTanguy Ngombo (Dallas Mavericks) – Bill McCandless (Court Side)\n\nAter Majok (Los Angeles Lakers) – Michael Lelchitski (SIG Sports)\n\nAdam Hanga (San Antonio Spurs) – Alex Saratsis (Octagon)\n\nIsaiah Thomas (Sacramento Kings) – Byron Irvin/Dan Fegan (Lagardere Unlimited)\n\nBy Darren Heitner\n\nDarren Heitner created Sports Agent Blog as a New Year's Resolution on December 31, 2005.
