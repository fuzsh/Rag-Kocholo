        "text": "The Denver Nuggets dealt often-injured center JaVale McGee, a protected 2015 first-round pick and the draft rights for Chukwudiebere Maduabum to the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday.\n\nIn return, the Nuggets received the rights to Cenk Akyol, a 6-foot-6 guard from Turkey who plays in the Turkish Basketball League, along with financial relief from McGee's salary.\n\nThe 27-year-old Akyol was originally drafted by Atlanta in 2005.\n\nMcGee has been hobbled by a left tibia stress fracture, which has limited his production the past two seasons. He's played in 17 games for Denver this season, averaging 5.2 points.\n\nMaduabum was selected by the Los Angeles Lakers in 2011, only to have Denver later pick up his rights. He recently played in four games for Fort Wayne of the NBA Development League."
