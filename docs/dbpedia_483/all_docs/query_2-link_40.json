        "text": "JaVale Lindy McGee ( JƏ-vayl; born January 19, 1988) is an American professional basketball player for the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Nevada Wolf Pack and was selected 18th overall by the Washington Wizards in the 2008 NBA draft. McGee is a three-time NBA champion, having won consecutive titles with the Golden State Warriors in 2017 and 2018 before winning a third title with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020. The son of Olympic gold medalist Pamela McGee, he won a gold medal with the 2020 U.S. Olympic team.\n\nHigh school and college career\n\nMcGee was born in Flint, Michigan, and attended two high schools in Michigan, Detroit Country Day School and Providence Christian, before transferring to Hales Franciscan High School in Chicago, Illinois. According to Hales Franciscan coach Gary London, McGee's natural position in college was ideally small forward, and he could play both forward spots.\n\nMcGee was the starting center for the University of Nevada. After averaging 14.3 points and 7.3 rebounds and shooting 53% from the field and 33% from three-point range as a sophomore, McGee decided to hire an agent and declare for the 2008 NBA draft.\n\nProfessional career\n\nWashington Wizards (2008–2012)\n\nMcGee was selected 18th overall by the Wizards in the 2008 NBA draft. On July 9, 2008, he signed a two-year, $2.4 million deal with the Wizards.\n\nOn January 6, 2011, McGee was chosen to participate in the 2011 NBA Slam Dunk Contest. He was the first Wizard to ever participate in the contest. McGee finished in second place, losing to Blake Griffin. McGee was the first player to use three balls at one time in a dunk contest, which was later cited by the Guinness World Records as the most basketballs dunked in a single jump. The third ball was passed to him from teammate John Wall.\n\nOn March 15, 2011, in a 98–79 loss against the Chicago Bulls, McGee notched his first career triple-double, recording 11 points, 12 rebounds, and 12 blocks. His career-high 12 blocks was the most since Keon Clark had 12 on March 23, 2001. However, McGee received some criticism for taking ill-advised shots in the fourth quarter to ensure he reached 10 points while his team was being blown out, and even received a technical foul for excessive celebration by pulling himself on the rim after a dunk for his final points. Television commentator Kevin McHale called it a \"bad triple-double\". In response to the criticism, McGee said, \"I got a triple-double. Who can say they got a triple-double? I'm not really worried about it.\"\n\nDuring the 2011 NBA lockout, NBPA leaders met with around 30 players on October 14 and stressed unity. McGee left the meeting early and told reporters there were some players \"saying that they're ready to fold\", but the majority was united. McGee later denied mentioning that players were ready to fold, but his comment was recorded by reporters. Derek Fisher said McGee had \"no ability to make that statement\" based on the limited time he spent at the meeting.\n\nMcGee averaged over 10 points and eight rebounds in 2010–11 and 2011–12 with the Wizards.\n\nDenver Nuggets (2012–2015)\n\nOn March 15, 2012, McGee was traded to the Nuggets along with Ronny Turiaf in a deal that sent Nenê to the Wizards. As a member of the Wizards, he started 40 of 41 games in which he appeared; with the Nuggets, he would start in 5 of 20 games in which he appeared. His minutes would also be reduced, averaging 27.4 with Washington but 20.6 with Denver. On March 21, in his Nuggets debut, McGee made the game-winning dunk off an Arron Afflalo missed free throw with 5 seconds left on the clock. At the end of the regular season, the Nuggets earned the West's sixth seed, and McGee appeared in the 2012 NBA playoffs, which was his first playoff appearance in his career. McGee's series-high was 21 points in Game 5 against first-round opponent Los Angeles Lakers. McGee's numbers were up and down throughout the series, including Game 7, when he scored just 6 points on 1–7 shooting in 32 minutes of floor time. On July 18, 2012, McGee re-signed with the Nuggets on a four-year, $44 million contract.\n\nMcGee's 2013–14 season was ended on February 20, 2014, when he underwent surgery to repair a stress fracture in his left tibia in which he sustained on November 8, 2013.\n\nOn October 29, 2014, McGee made his return for the Nuggets, recording 2 points and 2 rebounds in the season opening 89–79 win over the Detroit Pistons.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers (2015)\n\nOn February 19, 2015, McGee was traded, along with the rights to Chukwudiebere Maduabum and a 2015 first-round pick, to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for the rights to Cenk Akyol. On March 1, 2015, he was waived by the 76ers after appearing in six games.\n\nDallas Mavericks (2015–2016)\n\nOn August 13, 2015, McGee signed with the Dallas Mavericks. He missed the team's first 13 games of the 2015–16 season due to a stress fracture in his left tibia. On November 22, 2015, he made his debut for the Mavericks, playing in just under 11 minutes off the bench, recording 8 points and 6 rebounds in a loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. On January 5, 2016, he recorded season highs of 13 points and 11 rebounds in a 117–116 double overtime win over the Sacramento Kings.\n\nOn July 8, 2016, McGee was waived by the Mavericks.\n\nGolden State Warriors (2016–2018)\n\nOn September 16, 2016, McGee signed with the Golden State Warriors. On December 15, 2016, he scored a season-high 17 points in a 103–90 victory over the New York Knicks. On March 31, 2017, McGee had 13 points and a season-best five blocked shots in a 107–98 victory over the Houston Rockets. The Warriors went on to win the 2017 NBA Finals after defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers 4–1 in five games. McGee played in 77 of 82 regular season games, with a field goal percentage of .652, and 16 of 17 playoff games, with a percentage of .732, both the best in his career. The Warriors finished the playoffs with a 16–1 record, the best postseason winning percentage in NBA history.\n\nOn August 1, 2017, McGee re-signed with the Warriors on a one-year contract. McGee's playing time increased when he was inserted into the starting lineup after the all-star break. In June 2018, McGee won his second straight championship after the Warriors defeated the Cavaliers in a four-game sweep in the NBA Finals. McGee started the final three games of the series, and averaged 8.0 points in the four games.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (2018–2020)\n\nOn July 10, 2018, McGee signed with the Los Angeles Lakers. He missed seven games in December due to a respiratory infection. On March 22, 2019, McGee had career highs of 33 points and 20 rebounds to go along with six blocked shots during a 111–106 loss to the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nDuring the 2019–20 season, McGee played in 68 games and averaged 6.6 points and 5.7 rebounds in 16.6 minutes per game. He earned his third NBA championship with the Lakers in 2020.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers (2020–2021)\n\nOn November 23, 2020, McGee was traded from the Los Angeles Lakers to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Alfonzo McKinnie and Jordan Bell. On December 23, McGee made his debut for the team in a 121–114 victory over Charlotte Hornets and recorded 13 points and seven rebounds off the bench.\n\nReturn to Denver (2021)\n\nOn March 25, 2021, McGee was traded to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for center Isaiah Hartenstein and two future second-round picks.\n\nPhoenix Suns (2021–2022)\n\nOn August 16, 2021, McGee signed with the Phoenix Suns.\n\nReturn to Dallas (2022–2023)\n\nOn July 9, 2022, McGee signed with the Dallas Mavericks. He was waived on August 29, 2023.\n\nSacramento Kings (2023–present)\n\nOn September 2, 2023, McGee signed with the Sacramento Kings. After debuting with the Kings, McGee matched his mother Pamela in playing for professional basketball franchises in Dallas, Los Angeles, and Sacramento.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high\n\nNBA\n\nRegular season\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2008–09 Washington 75 14 15.2 .494 - — .660 3.9 .3 .4 1.0 6.5 2009–10 Washington 60 19 16.1 .508 .000 .638 4.0 .2 .3 1.7 6.4 2010–11 Washington 79 75 27.8 .550 .000 .583 8.0 .5 .5 2.4 10.1 2011–12 Washington 41 40 27.4 .535 - — .500 8.8 .6 .6 2.5 11.9 Denver 20 5 20.5 .612 - — .373 5.8 .3 .5 1.6 10.3 2012–13 Denver 79 0 18.1 .575 1.000 .591 4.8 .3 .4 2.0 9.1 2013–14 Denver 5 5 15.9 .447 - — 1.000 3.4 .4 .2 1.4 7.0 2014–15 Denver 17 0 11.4 .557 - — .690 2.8 .1 .1 1.1 5.2 Philadelphia 6 0 10.2 .444 - — .500 2.2 .3 .0 .2 3.0 2015–16 Dallas 34 2 10.9 .575 .000 .500 3.9 .1 .1 .8 5.1 2016–17 Golden State 77 10 9.6 .652 .000 .505 3.2 .2 .2 .9 6.1 2017–18 Golden State 65 17 9.5 .621 .000 .731 2.6 .5 .3 .9 4.8 2018–19 L.A.

He played with Team USA in a scrimmage at Radio City Music Hall during the 2010 World Basketball Festival, but after an uneven performance, McGee did not play in the team's scrimmage against China at Madison Square Garden and was cut on August 15, 2010.\n\nMcGee visited the Philippines twice during the 2011 NBA lockout, first in exhibition games with NBA stars against players from the Philippine Basketball Association and the Smart Gilas national team, and then in a basketball clinic. Later that year, McGee expressed his interest in playing for the Philippine national team, and in 2012, a bill was filed for his Filipino citizenship to make him eligible to play for Smart Gilas. In 2014, McGee was asked again by the Gilas Pilipinas to take part as a naturalized player for the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup in Spain. However, national teams were limited to one naturalized player apiece, and former Wizards teammate Andray Blatche made the World Cup team after he was granted citizenship.\n\nMcGee and forward Keldon Johnson of the San Antonio Spurs were announced as replacements for Bradley Beal and Kevin Love on the 2020 U.S. Olympic team. On August 7, 2021, McGee won an Olympic gold medal after United States defeated France in the final. With the medal, he and his mother, Pamela McGee, became the first mother and son to win gold medals in Olympic history.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nIn 2013, McGee started Juglife Foundation, an organization that brings awareness of drinking water and hydration. He has hosted celebrity softball games involving his NBA colleagues. Juglife has partnered with Hope 4 Kids International in building wells in Uganda.\n\nPersonal life\n\nMcGee's father, 6-foot-10-inch (2.08 m) George Montgomery, was a 1985 second-round draft selection by the Portland Trail Blazers, though he did not play for the team. His mother, 6-foot-3-inch (1.91 m) Pamela McGee, was a University of Southern California standout who played with her twin sister, Paula, and Cheryl Miller, and won two NCAA Division I championships, in 1983 and 1984. Prior to that, Pamela won two Michigan state championships at Northern Flint High School. She won an Olympic gold medal in 1984. Besides playing in France, Italy and Brazil, Pamela was drafted in the 1997 WNBA draft by the Sacramento Monarchs, and played for the Monarchs and Los Angeles Sparks. McGee is the first son of a WNBA player to ever play in the NBA. His younger half-sister, Imani McGee-Stafford, is also a professional basketball player who previously played in the WNBA for both the Chicago Sky and the Atlanta Dream. His mother, with a degree in economics, balanced her international basketball career with raising both children, homeschooling, coaching and teaching school in the offseason. McGee is also cousins with former NFL defensive end Jarron Gilbert.\n\nIn 2013, it was announced that McGee would be starring in his own reality television show, Mom's Got Game, with his mother. McGee had the largest documented armspan of any current NBA player at 7 ft 6.5 in (2.30 m) until the Nuggets drafted Rudy Gobert, with an armspan at 7 ft 8.5 in (2.35 m) in the 2013 NBA draft. McGee has been featured regularly on Inside the NBA's basketball blooper feature \"Shaqtin' a Fool\", earning the nickname \"Tragic Bronson\", a play on Magic Johnson, from Shaquille O'Neal. McGee has expressed displeasure at his frequent appearance on the segment. McGee became a full-time vegan in the summer of 2017. He had dabbled with the diet for a few years, using it before each season to lose weight. McGee committed to it full-time after seeing how his body responded during the Warriors' championship season in 2016–17.\n\nMcGee is also a record producer under the moniker Pierre. He has a studio in Inglewood and released his self-titled debut album in 2018. In 2020, McGee co-produced \"Available\" with Poo Bear and Sasha Sirota on Justin Bieber's record, Changes.\n\nSee also\n\nIn Spanish: JaVale McGee para niños"
