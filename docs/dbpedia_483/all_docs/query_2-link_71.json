        "text": "Nuggets general manager Masai Ujiri would be in his native Africa this time of year anyway. He always is.\n\nBut the NBA lockout has increased the visibility of basketball’s global development, not least because international leagues are peeling off American players fearful there won’t be a 2011-12 NBA season.\n\nAlready, Nuggets guard Ty Lawson has agreed to play in Lithuania, a deal he can escape if the NBA settles its labor dispute, and forward Wilson Chandler has signed to play in China whether the NBA has a season or not.\n\nAfrica is perhaps the game’s last great untapped resource. It has exported some notable stars, including Hakeem Olajuwon, Dikembe Mutombo and Luol Deng, but from a continent of 1 billion people, the basketball exports to date are a drop in the ocean.\n\n“Being from here, you see the huge potential,” Ujiri, a native of Nigeria, said this week by phone from Madagascar, site of the African Basketball Championship. “We lack coaching, we lack infrastructure and we lack a little bit organization. But we’re working hard with the national federations and FIBA (the International Basketball Federation) and the NBA to bring everything together and develop the young kids.”\n\nThursday through Sunday, Ujiri will co-direct the annual Basketball Without Borders camp for 60 elite players ages 16-18 from all over the continent. This year, it’s in Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nIn a normal year, a number of NBA stars would be there to help. Nuggets forward Danilo Gallinari, then a member of the Knicks, participated last year when the camp was in Senegal. Because of the lockout, this year it’s all former players, including Mutombo, Patrick Ewing and Alonzo Mourning.\n\n“When you see the huge potential in the continent you wish that one day you could just open your eyes and every country has 10 gyms or 15 gyms and tons of outdoors courts where kids can just play anytime they want,” Ujiri said. “But that’s not the case now. We hope to get it there one day.”\n\nThe Basketball Without Borders African camps, which Ujiri has been directing since 2003, have already begun sending players to the NBA. The Toronto Raptors, with Ujiri then in their front office, selected 7-foot-1 Nigerian center Solomon Alabi in the second round of the 2010 draft. Alabi attended the BWB camp in 2004.\n\nIn June, 10 months after making Ujiri their GM, the Nuggets obtained a second-round draft pick from the Lakers and used it to select Chukwudiebere Maduabum, better known as Chu Chu, a 20-year-old power forward from Nigeria. He too attended the BWB camp.\n\n“All kids need here is a place to play, somewhere they could go where they’re not sharing the gym with volleyball or kickboxing or a church or tons of other activities,” Ujiri said.\n\n“Even when you do that, rims are broken, floors are bad and outdoor courts are really run- down. I can’t wait to see one day the time, I don’t know if it will be my generation, when anywhere you go the kids have a basketball and a court to just play and work on their games and get better. It’s something that we’re fighting for in Africa.”\n\nThere are times when Ujiri wishes Olajuwon and Mutombo had come along a little later, after development of the Internet and cable TV, so African kids could watch and be inspired by them.\n\n“They would have been huge now,” he said. “They still are because people still watch old films and people still see what they are doing on the continent. Mutombo with his hospital is a huge figure around the world and he’s a huge presence in Basketball Without Borders.”\n\nThe Nuggets’ top draft pick 20 years ago, Mutombo founded the Biamba Marie Mutombo Hospital and Research Center in his native Congo.\n\nThese days, a new generation of African players is emerging. Deng, who averaged 17.4 points a game for the Bulls last season, was born in the Sudan. Serge Ibaka, the Oklahoma City Thunder forward who helped dispatch the Nuggets from the playoffs last spring, was born in the Congo. Christian Eyenga, also of the Congo, just played his rookie season with the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\n“This is my continent, where I come from,” Ujiri said. “Coming back and interacting with people, you want to see how much progress has been made. It is an exciting time for me.\n\n“There’s a lot of raw potential and it’s how much we guide these kids, it’s how hard they work and what path they take. I love the potential of developing basketball in Africa.”\n\nDave Krieger: 303-954-5297, dkrieger@denverpost.com or twitter.com/DaveKrieger"
