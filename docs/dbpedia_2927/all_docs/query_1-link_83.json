        "text": "National Register #84001194\n\nGlen Canyon Covered Bridge\n\nAKA DeLaveaga Covered Bridge\n\n850 North Branciforte Drive\n\nSanta Cruz\n\nBuilt 1892\n\nDemolished Sometime After 1984\n\nThe Glen Canyon Covered Bridge was built across Branciforte Creek on Glen Canyon Road in 1892 by contractor G. McKay for Santa Cruz County. It was subsequently moved in 1939 to save it from demolition by a volunteer crew to a location one-half mile upstream in Delaveaga Park.\n\nThe bridge is 83 feet long and measures 23 feet, 1 inch in height. It is eighteen feet wide. All substructure construction is of redwood while the superstructure is made of Douglas fir with iron vertical tie rods.\n\nThe structure has been noted in a number of publications as one of significance. American Bridges and Dams by Paul Zucker illustrates this bridge as a prototypical 19th century vernacular type commenting that it would look at home in Vermont.\n\nExcerpted from the NRHP Nomination.\n\nNoeHill searched for this bridge in DeLaveaga Park, but we were unable to find it. If you have any information on the Glen Canyon Covered Bridge, we would love to hear from you.\n\nA reader, who is familiar with Santa Cruz, advised us in February 2006 that the Glen Canyon bridge no longer exists and that local lore says it was destroyed by a storm. She kindly provided a reference to a Santa Cruz Public Libraries Local History web page which confirms the loss of the bridge and states that it was \"taken down\" some time after 1984.\n\nHistoric Covered Bridges in California\n\nBridgeport\n\nCalifornia Powder Works Bridge\n\nFelton\n\nGlen Canyon\n\nHoney Run\n\nKnights Ferry\n\nOregon Creek\n\nWawona\n\nZane's Ranch\n\nHistoric Covered Bridges in Oregon\n\nAntelope Creek\n\nGrave Creek\n\nHorse Creek\n\nLittle Butte Creek\n\nLost Creek"
