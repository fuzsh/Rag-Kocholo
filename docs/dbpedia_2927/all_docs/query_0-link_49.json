The Coastal Commission's Regional Cumulative Assessment Project (ReCAP), undertaken as a pilot project in the Monterey Bay region, comprises the core of this strategy. Under ReCAP, the Commission staff assessed the cumulative impacts of development on wetlands, coastal hazards, and public access in the pilot region and developed program and policy recommendations to improve management of such impacts. The ReCAP pilot region is defined as the coastal zone extending from the Santa Cruz/San Mateo county line through Point Lobos State Park in Monterey County. Cumulative impacts are addressed and coastal resources managed primarily through three major processes under the California Coastal Management Program (CCMP): coastal development permitting and appeals, planning and implementation of local coastal plans (LCPs) and federal consistency review. However, the existing management framework makes effective management of cumulative impacts difficult. In the pilot region, seven local jurisdictions have certified LCPs and therefore issue most coastal permits, with the Commission retaining only limited permit and appeal authority. These jurisdictions are: Santa Cruz County, Santa Cruz City, Capitola, Watsonville, Monterey County, the City of Marina, and Sand City. The Commission approved amendments to these LCPs at least 58 times, many of which were project related. Four jurisdictions have yet to be certified and the Commission retains jurisdiction in these areas (the Cities of Pacific Grove, Seaside, Carmel-by-the-Sea, and Monterey). In addition to the CCMP, other state and federal agencies have regulatory authority affecting coastal resources under separate laws. Therefore, under the existing framework, multiple jurisdictions have varying policies and standards in different geographic areas. Section 3 0519.5 of the GoastalAct provides that at least once every five Recognizing these difficulties, the CCMP relies on year Is the Commission s Ih.all review: every the periodic review of LCPs, called for in Section 30519.5, certified LCP to determine whether the to help reconcile multiple policies and to ensure that program is. being effectively: implemented. policies remain effective in managing resources and in conformity with the policies of the responsive to social and cultural changes over time. Coastal Act and: submit recommendations However, this monitoring and program review has been of corrective actions, if any, to. the.local accomplished in only a few cases. In the ReCAP region, government. Santa Cruz County and Santa Cruz City completed comprehensive revisions and updates to their LCPs. Monterey County is currently revising its CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION PAGE 1 RECAP PILOT PROJECT implementation ordinances. In only one case (the City of Sand City), has the Commission itself looked at the combined, long term results of numerous individual permit decisions, and suggested improvements to the LCPs in carrying out the goals of the Coastal Act. As indicated in this report, the CCW has accomplished much in mitigating site specific impacts through its review of specific development projects. However, addressing the cumulative impacts of these combined projects is difficult without periodic reviews. The cumulative effects of individual development proposals on the resources of the region beyond the site, beyond a political jurisdiction and beyond the coastal zone are considered in only a few permit reviews; such analysis is generally limited to major projects, where cumulative impacts analysis is mandated by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The lack of a structured information exchange among agencies further makes determining the effects of a single development proposal on regional resources difficult. Regional reviews and the data collection that results can provide the catalyst for better regional resource management by: 1) helping coastal managers see beyond the routine review of individual sites; 2) linking individual sites and development proposals to the larger regional resource trends; 3) recognizing sources and impacts from both inside and outside the coastal zone; 4) developing policy and intergovernmental. tools to address cumulative and secondary impacts; and 5) helping programs realize their full potential to manage coastal resources. I 'NA K mp_ ME` 21_@ 2-0-M a Through ReCAP, the Commission seeks to develop a new framework for conducting regional periodic reviews throughout the coastal zone and to put in place information exchange mechanisms to facilitate continued monitoring of regional- effectsof individual development - proposals. As a pilot project, ReCAP identified broad coastal trends in the Monterey Bay area to evaluate cumulative impacts over time that were not otherwise evident through \"project by project\" review, analyzed the major factors contributing to the cumulative impacts, and evaluated the effectiveness of coastal policies or procedures across multiple jurisdictions in responding to cumulative impacts. The results of the ReCAP pilot project include recommendations to improve coastal policies and procedures and -to improve implementation of local coastal programs. Such improvements will enable both the C ommission and local governments to better address cumulative impacts in their management of coastal resources. The ReCAP team began the pilot project with a broad effort to identify regional aspects of wetlands, hazards, and access most important to the region. Once these were identified, the team created a framework for analyzing cumulative impacts. This framework was created by developing a matrix for the three priority issue areas. The matrix identified relevant policy questions, the methods and indicators by which the questions could be analyzed, the time frames and pilot area locations where these questions could be analyzed, data which should be used to analyze the questions, and the possible sources of data. In addition to the matrix development, the team completed a regional outreach to seek suggestions for how to measure and analyze these issues. Questionnaires were developed and sent to various regional parties, including technical experts in the areas. The team interviewed technical experts and key local government planning directors, officials and staff, and discussed issues with representatives of local environmental groups. In March, 1994, the team issued its Preli in= Report on Resource Status and Change, which described the current condition of the resource systems and changes documented over the past 10 years. Staff circulated the document to the Commission, local government and interested parties and conducted a'workshop with staff of local and regional agencies and interested public. The Commission held a public hearing on April 12, 1994. In addition, ReCAP staff convened a seminar of wetland specialists to provide early feedback on the wetland impact analysis in May, 1994. This public input helped guide the ReCAP analysis of important policy questions. In this report, the team builds upon this earlier work. PAGE 2 CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION The data used in this project came from a variety of information sources, with the major sources being Commission and local government permit actions. The ReCAP team developed a database of Commission permit activities from 1983-1993 and a database of local permits from 1986 to 1994, supplemented with detailed information on the three issues areas. The pilot project also benefited greatly from extensive and sophisticated mapping analysis developed by Santa Cruz County as part of the County's Geographic Information System. In addition, the ReCAP analysis provided some immediate assistance to Commission staff in ongoing review of LCPs and individual permits. For example, ReCAP information was used by Commission staff in working with Santa Cruz County staff on proposed revisions to the County's LCP. The ReCAP pilot area has some of the most spectacular and important resources of coastal California. These resources are also subject to increasing pressures from growth and development. Overall, from 1970 to 1995, nearly one-quarter of a million persons were added to Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties combined -- an increase of over 65%. In terms of land use in Santa Cruz County and the northern portion of Monterey County, growth contributed to a 43% increase in urban land uses over the past two decades. From 1983 to 1993, the Commission and local government approved approximately 3,005 coastal development permits in the ReCAP pilot region. Nearly one third of these (949), were issued by the Coastal Commission. These Commission issued permits approved 765 residential units, 931 lodging units and over 300 new lots. The implementation of the CCMP in this period saw major accomplishments. As noted later in this report, the total acreage of wetland resources has not declined and major new access areas and facilities were developed. However, during this time, over 2 miles of shoreline were armored, impacts to wetlands were evident through changes in hydrology and the loss of buffers and habitat, and the ability to use available public access sites became more constrained. This document contains the results of the year-long pilot project to assess cumulative impacts and to recommend improvements in coastal policy and procedures to address these impacts. The document summarizes how resources have changed over time in the pilot region and analyzes the factors contributing to these changes. It projects possible future trends given current policies. Finally, the report outlines recommendations for program improvements in the short-term and identifies longer term program opportunities in policies or procedures to better manage cumulative impacts on a regional basis. The general economic effects of the recommendations are considered. The recommendations are not presented in any priority, but rather are organized as initial steps, some of which could be taken in the next year's work program, as well as a wide range of longer term opportunities for program improvements. The Commission staff recommends that the findings and recommendations of this pilot project guide development and implementation of future specific program improvements and provide input to review of permits and LCP amendments in the pilot area. This report can be the basis for' working with local governments to develop modified policies, programs or procedures in individual LCPs to better manage cumulative impacts.

CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION PAGE 3 . . . . ........... ..... .... . . .. ...................... . Evaluating the cumulative impacts of development on coastal resources requires factoring in how the coastal zone is impacted by (and impacts) the surrounding area. While the ReCAP area is bounded by the coastal zone in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties, it is important to place it within the context of the Monterey Bay region and to consider the particular characteristics of the overall resource area of the two counties combined. In order to generate this regional perspective, this chapter presents a brief overview of population and growth trends in Monterey and Santa Cruz Counties. Clearly, these population and growth trends are prime indicators of the overall increased pressure on coastal resources -- it is this cumulative pressure over time that must be addressed within the California Coastal Management Program (CCMP). eA Monterey and Santa Cruz Counties are situated south of the San Francisco Bay area along California's central coast. The diverse geography of the region encompasses mountains, forests, rolling hills, agricultural lands, sand dunes and beaches. The range of natural resources in tandem with a mild climate, world-renowned scenic vistas, and a multifaceted cultural identity combine to make the Monterey Bay area a very desirable region in which to live and visit. The influx of people attracted by the area's special character has also brought with it extensive development and regional growth. Within the two-county region, the ReCAP area is defined by the coastal zone extending from the Santa Cruz/San Mateo county line through Point Lobos State Park in Monterey County (see Figure 2- 1). Within these borders, the ReCAP coastline stretches 83 miles and encompasses the largely undeveloped and agricultural north coast of Santa Cruz County, the beaches in and around the cities of Santa Cruz and Capitola, a nearly unbroken 25- mile stretch of dunes, and the rocky coastline of the Monterey Peninsula and Carmel.

Providing opportunities for surfers, fishermen, divers, marine researchers, kayakers, and boaters, among others, Monterey Bay has long been a focal point for area residents and visitors alike. The Bay supports an extensive population of marine species and is site to the largest submarine canyon in North America. The unique grandeur of the region and its national significance was formally recognized in 1992 when the Monterey Bay became part of the largest federally protected marine sanctuary in the nation (Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary). 2. W,015=1111W\"SW@Z ZSIMIMMP! E In analyzing the population changes impacting the project area, it would be useful to analyze both the population trends within the coastal zone and those of the region as a whole. Unfortunately, United States Census data is not kept in a manner which recognizes the coastal zone boundary. Because of this, and because population growth in a region will impact coastal resources regardless of which side of the coastal zone boundary the growth occurs, ReCAP chose to evaluate population growth in the overall two-county region. In fact, county-level population data is probably a more realistic gauge for measuring overall increased pressure on (and demand for) coastal resources in the ReCAP project area since these resources are used by more than just the coastal zone population. Monterey and Santa Cruz Counties have both experienced significant growth in population since the early 1900s.IAs shown in Figure 2-2, nearly seven times as many persons lived in Monterey and Santa Cruz Counties in 1995 as did in 19301. Clearly, this transition from small coastal counties to growing population centers has had an overall effect on resource conditions in the region. More people leads to the need for more housing, more infrastructure, and more businesses, the development of which may result in.more resource impacts. As urbanization increases, the health of natural resource systems may cumulatively decline.

While Santa Cruz County is much smaller than Monterey County, both in terms of land area and overall population, both counties have grown in population by roughly the same amount since 1970. 4 This growth represents a 65% increase in persons for the two-county region; roughly equivalent to the 62% growth in California during the same time period. This regional growth is impressive not. only because there are natural barriers to growth (such as coastal mountain ranges), but also because there have been various growth management measures put in place over the years. These restraints have ranged from legislative efforts such as Santa Cruz County's Measure J in 1978 which set annual growth limits, to low- growth community opposition groups, to efforts to limit the expansion of urban services and infrastructure. The overall population in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties declined for the first time in 1994 due to the closure of Fort Ord. However, with Fort Ord converted to the new California State University at Monterey Bay, this decline is likely to be a temporary phenomenon. In fact, according to preliminary estimates, a positive population growth rate has a< 5 been reestablished for the two county area in 1995. Projections of future population growth show that the Monterey Bay region is expected to maintain the long term growth patterns evident from the historical census figures in Figure 2- 2. The two counties should continue to maintain the 610,000 new persons a year pace with an increase of nearly 150,000 persons by the year 2010. Should these population projections hold true, Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties in 2010 would have more than double the number of people as were living there when the Coastal Act was passed. Such ongoing population growth will increase the regional need for housing, jobs, roads, urban services and infrastructure, water, parks and recreational areas, and overall community services. For coastal counties such as Monterey and Santa Cruz where the vast majority of residents live within a half-hour of the coastal zone, coastal zone resources are seen as a critical element in helping to meet these needs. Furthermore, -with coastal zone resources themselves attracting visitors into the region, an even greater demand for services and resource pressure is likely to continue along the coast; as with any finite resource, currently impacted coastal resources will likely be even more at risk in the future. Ongoing population growth in the ReCAP area has been mirrored by an increase in urbanization for the Monterey Bay area. From historical surveys, it is clear that vegetated areas and areas in agricultural production have been steadily declining in the past twenty years at the hands of an ever-expanding urban and suburban landscape. Urban and suburban land use, though still a relatively small proportion of the total land use area, has increased 43% in the greater Monterey Bay area since 1976 (see Figure 2-3 ).7 This increase has been even more pronounced in the southern portion of the greater Monterey Bay area with over three-fourths of the urban and suburban acreage increase occurring in the Monterey County segment. 8 In addition, though the offsetting decline in agricultural lands has been shared equally by the two segments the decline in vegetated area was confined almost exclusively to the Monterey County segment.4 These changes would appear to point to a more extensive urban and suburban expansion in the southern portion of the Monterey Bay region. This expansion brings with it increased impervious surfacing, increased human presence, and increased encroachment into natural resource buffer areas (e.g., wetland and dune complexes). Placing this overall urban expansion within the perspective of the CCMP and the project region, ReCAP aerial photo analysis of development patterns in the coastal zone since the 1970s confirms these overall urbanizing trends. 10 Within Santa Cruz County's coastal zone, most new development has occurred within or adjacent to the urban services line (i.e., the boundary point for such infrastructure as gas, water, and sewage hook-ups), especially in the unincorporated areas of Live Oak (the area between the cities of Santa Cruz and Capitola) and the Aptos CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION PAGE 7 RECAP PILOT PROJECT shoreline. While the Live Oak infilling occurred within an area already considerably \"urban\", the expansion in 1984 of urban services into the Aptos area led to the conversion of large belts of vegetated area into the urban landform (e.g., planned development in the Seascape area). The general development pattern in Santa Cruz County's coastal zone has been a concentrated urban band extending from the City of Santa Cruz southeast to La Selva Beach; very little new development occurred in other areas of the County's coastal zone. This pattern appears to reflect a strong adherence to Santa Cruz County's LCP goal of concentrating development in already urbanized areas and protecting agricultural lands. While concentrating new development in urban areas creates cumulative impacts on such coastal resources as urban wetlands that find themselves slowly hemmed in by increased development, infrastructure, and population, it minimizes the impacts to resources in less developed areas. Figure 2-3: Land Use Changes in the ReCAP Region, 1976-1989 % J.. 8.7% 10.8% 0 Urban MAgriculture 0 Vegetated Area 82.4% 82.4% 81.9% 72,0% 71.4% 70.0% 64.5% 63.40% 61,3% 1976 1982 1989 1976 1982 1989 1976 1982 1989 Santa Cruz Monterey* Total Land Use Assessment Area* Source: DWR Quad County Summaries See Figure 2- 1) In Monterey County, by contrast, ReCAP aerial photo analysis confirmed that while there was significant growth in such areas as Marina and Del Monte Forest, a considerable portion of new development within the coastal zone occurred in semi-rural areas of North Monterey County -- especially in the areas north and east of Elkhorn Slough. This type of seini- urban expansion into rural areas, largely outside the reach of urban services such as water and sewer service, is clearly different from the expansion taking place in Santa Cruz County that is primarily within areas that could be considered at least partially \"urban\". Although per acre densities are low in North Monterey County, the amount of new development is sufficient to warrant concern about short- and long-term cumulative affects on. nearby Elkhorn Slough. ' Sediments loosened during construction can end up as deposits in. the slough, and the increase in impervious surfaces such as roads and rooftops will cause long-term cumulative changes in the hydrology of the watershed. In addition, with most of this new development dependent on septic systems for sewage disposal, there are water quality implications for nearby wetland systems. The expansion of urban and suburban development into areas with high resource value exemplifies the type of situation in which cumulative impacts cart easily be overlooked because each individual project appears to have only minimal impacts. The land use surveys and aerial photo analysis are further supplemented by CCMP permitting information within the ReCAP study region for the past decade. The data show that while new development pressures were widespread in the region, nearly 60% of the permit activity occurred in unincorporated Santa Cruz County and the northern portion of Monterey County (Figure 2-4). With nearly 30% of all permitting activity in the region, the North jo WII-70/o 0 \"-.01 PAGES CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION CHAPTER 2 - REGIONAL OVERVIEW Monterey County LCP segment appears to have been the CCMP hotspot for development in the ReCAP study area.

With few urban uses currently allowed for vacant parcels outside of the urban services line, growth pressures should continue to be felf within the urban band extending from the City of Santa Cruz to La Selva Beach. This scenario is supported by the County's own analysis showing that primary growth 13 areas should continue to be in the Live Oak and Aptos planning areas. However, with a large amount of additional growth already approved in the Seascape area along the southern boundary of the urban services line, there is also the potential for development pressures to extend southward. In fact, ongoing pressures to develop outside the rural/urban boundary line are already evident through a number of development proposals, particularly in southern Santa Cruz County. While funneling development within the more 6urban\" areas (in Live Oak and Aptos) is more protective of rural and agricultural lands, development pressures outside the urban services line (southern Santa Cruz County) show that these less urban areas are also at risk. Overall, this planned infilling leads to the need for increased management of cumulative impacts. In urban areas, shrinking resource buffer areas, increased parking demand, and overall increased shoreline use will lead to an intensification of impacts to shoreline resources and public access. These potential impacts will require comprehensive planning efforts focusing on defined 'systems' (e.g. public access plans, wetland and watershed ecosystem planning, coastal hazard area management plans, etc.). Within Monterey County's coastal zone, while limited infilling of urban areas is expected, ReCAP's analysis of vacant lands in the region points to a number of areas with the potential for conflicts between development and natural resources. For example, much of the vacant land in the Elkhorn Slough area is zoned for residential use, albeit at low densities. With good access to the job market in the Santa Clara Valley and San Jose via Highway 10 1, demand CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION PAGE 9 RECAP PILOT PROJECT for residential development in this area is likely to continue. The Del Monte Forest LCP segment also has large vacant areas planned for residential and golf course development. The redevelopment of Fort Ord has the potential for creating resource conflicts on large remnants of native habitats as well as on beaches and bluff areas that had heretofore been closed to public access. The dune habitats of the county are also at risk, with the largest areas of undeveloped shoreline in the ReCAP region zoned for urban uses located in the shoreline dunes of the Cities of Marina and Sand City. Given the fragile nature of these resource systems, a high priority in the southern portion of the ReCAP region should be placed on developing policies that manage and/or avoid cumulative impacts within sensitive areas (e.g., refining performance criteria for particular resource systems, developing management plans for particular resource areas, directing development away from sensitive areas, etc.). \"K, @p , %,, Is- 211 - M-1-11, The population figures for the Monterey Bay region demonstrate that there has been substantial historical growth in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties with projections indicating that this growth will continue in the future. The two counties' combined population increased nearly seven-fold since the early 1900s, with an increase of nearly one-quarter of a million persons since 1970 alone. Future population projections estimate that this rate of increase of nearly 10,000 persons per year will be maintained, with nearly 150,000 new persons being added to the two county region by the year 2010. This ongoing population growth highlights the regional need for increased housing, jobs, roads, urban services and infrastructure, water, parks and recreational areas, and other community services. With coastal zone resources seen as a critical element in helping to meet these regional needs, individual LCPs must be able to address these regional, 'greater than local' needs. In terms of overall development trends, an increasing populace has contributed to a 43% increase in the urban landforTn for the greater Monterey Bay area over the past twenty years. Within the coastal zone of Santa Cruz County, this development appears to have been primarily concentrated in existing urbanized areas within the urban services line. For Monterey County's coastal zone, a considerable amount of development appears to be: due to urban expansion into semi-rural areas in and around Elkhorn Slough; CCMP permitting history shows that nearly 30% of all permits issued in the past decade in the ReCAP area were issued in the North Monterey County LCP segment. In terms of future trends, Santa Cruz County's coastal zone can expect development to be funneled to areas within the urban services lint. in the Live Oak and Aptos planning areas. For the coastal zone in Monterey County, areas of potential growth appear to be in and around areas of coastal resources such as wetlands, dunes, and forests. While there are different policy implications for these differing development trends within the two counties, incorporating management of both resource 'systems' and cumulative impacts into LCP policy is crucial for ongoing resource protection in the Monterey Bay area.

While DWR is primarily interested in water-management related land use categorizations that generally focus on agricultural breakdowns, the figures also allow for a gross characterization of the urban landform. ReCAP has chosen to analyze a land use area slightly larger than the coastal zone in Monterey and Santa Cruz Counties in order to place land use issues within the regional context. The ReCAP land use area results in a total acreage breakdown that encompasses all of Santa Cruz County and 18.5% of Monterey County (See Figure 2- 1). 8Ibid. Monterey County accounted for 16,704 (or 75-71/6) of the 22,075 acres converted to the urban landform from 1976 to 1989 in the ReCAP land use area. 9Ibid. Santa Cruz County accounted for only 1,337 (or 9.01/6) of the 14,788 acres of vegetated area lost from 1976 to 1989 in the ReCAP land use area. 10 ReCAP photo-analysis based on 1978 and 1993 aerial photographs of the coastal zone in Monterey and Santa Cruz Counties.

CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION PAGE 11 This chapter summarizes ReCAP's investigation of shoreline hazard response protection of upland development by armoring, the permitting associated with existing armoring, the impacts from armoring, the policies which address shoreline protection, and the likely changes which will happen to the shoreline in the future assuming existing trends and policies continue. A major finding of this effort is that current coastal policies support the use of public shoreline and public resources to protect private property and if the current situation continues, more and more of the public shoreline will be lost as a public resource. While only an eighth of the ReCAP coastline is now armored, over a third of the ReCAP coastline has the land use and physical characteristics which could require armoring in the future. None of this includes the shoreline already protected by groins, jetties and breakwaters. There are substantial portions of coastline which can be affected by the land use and armoring policies which are in effect. Most property owners consider shoreline armoring only after they perceive a threat to their development and believe that without annoring, their home or business will be damaged or destroyed. In many cases, the hazards posed by storms and coastal erosion can be serious. Statewide, on average, shoreline hazards cost $100 million annually, either from damage due to storms and erosion,Ior for shoreline armoring and modification designed to protect against storms and erpsion. Breakdown for the ReCAP area is not available; however, a substantial amount of public and private funds are being expended routinely to address coastal hazards. The ReCAP Coastal Hazards team examined in detail the concerns that: (1) there is no consistent regional approach to address areas prone to shoreline erosion, (2) impacts to shoreline access from armoring are often overlooked, (3) armoring is often put in place during emergency storm events which may have significant impacts to the coast but which has little overall analysis, and 4) the building setbacks for much of the shoreline development in urban portions of the ReCAP pilot area are often inadequate. Examination and analysis of these concerns led to recommendations for improvements in the procedures for developing regular permit conditions, issuing emergency permits, and establishing setbacks. Recommendations also include efforts to introduce a more regionally based plan for shoreline protection. While the recommended changes in procedures could provide some immediate improvement in the management of coastal hazards, longer-term efforts could require changes to Coastal Act policies. The hazards team identified a number of changes and revisions to the Coastal Act itself which could modify or clarify the overall direction for safe development in areas of high coastal hazards. Individually, or in combination, these recommended changes and modifications would provide coastal planners with tools and resources to plan for future shoreline hazards and safe development. Methodology Used to Addres& Coastal Hazards Coastal erosion is a natural phenomenon which occurs along much of the Santa Cruz and Monterey County shorelines. Coastal and upland erosion provides most of the current day beach materia 1.

ReCAP identified four variables to evaluate the cumulative impacts from policies designed to minimize hazards from coastal erosion: identification of changes to the natural system, recognition of the hazard, determination of responses to the hazard, and assessment of the costs and benefits of the responses including determination of changes to the natural system resulting from the response. Figure 3-1 is a conceptual model for coastal hazards which outlines many of the components of coastal hazards and identifies their interactions. Policies Governing Shoreline Armoring Activitle% The California Coastal Act (Coastal Act) is a major, state-wide law establishing a regulatory program that governs coastal hazard response, development along the shoreline, and the use of shoreline armoring. The major Coastal Act policies which address coastal hazard response are found in the following sections: Section 30253 which addresses the overall stability of new development; Section 30235 which provides for protection of existing development along the shoreline when it is threatened by shoreline erosion; and Section 30610 regarding the rebuilding of existing development that has been destroyed by a natural disaster. These three sections give somewhat conflicting direction regarding response to coastal hazards and reliance on shoreline armoring. Section 30253 sets standards that require that new development: (7) Minimize risks to life andproperty in areas of high geologic, flood, andfire hazard. (2) Assure stability and structural integrity, and neither create nor contribute significantly to erosion, geologic instability, or destruction of the site or surrounding area or in any way require the construction ofprotective devices that would substantially alter natural landforms along bluffs and cliffs. (Emphasis added) This policy has been the basis for requiring technical reports (geologic reports, wave run-up analysis, slope stability or site inundation studies, to name a few) for new development in areas of high hazard to ensure that the proposed project, as designed, can be relatively safe over its lifetime. The Coastal Commission and most of the Local Coastal Programs (LCPs) in the pilot area address the safety of new development along coastal bluffs through setbacks which require that the new structure be a sufficient distance from the edge of the coastal bluff that the structure will not be threatened by bluff retreat or natural erosion during the life of the structure. The Commission provides for use of setbacks through inclusion of suggested setbacks in the Statewide Interpretive Guidelines. At the local level, setbacks are provided by detailed discussion in the LCPs. Most LCPs in the ReCAP area require that setbacks be sufficient to protect the structure for a 50 year economic life and require a minimum setback distance based on either site-specific geology reports or use of the Area of Demonstration. 2 One requirement of Section 30253(2) is that new development should be stable without the construction of protective devices to minimize hazards. However, once a new structure has been built, it is an existing structure and Section 30235 of the Coastal Act permits existing structures to use shoreline armoring to protect against shoreline erosion. Some permits for new development have included conditions which make clear that the development was approved only with the understanding that shoreline armoring would never be needed. Section 30235, applied to most existing development, states in full: Revetments, breakwaters, groins, harbor channels, seawalls, cliff retaining walls, and other such construction that alters natural shoreline processes shall be permitted when required to serve coastal-dependent uses or to protect existing structures orpublic beaches in dangerfrom erosion, and when CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION PAGE 15 RECAP PILOT PROJECT designed to eliminate or mitigate adverse impacts on local shoreline sand supply. Existing marine structures causing water stagnation contributing to pollution problems andfish kills should be phased out or upgraded wherefeasible. (Emphasis added) All the LCPs for the pilot area, in conformance with the Coastal Act, allow shoreline armoring where it is necessary to protect existing development, coastal dependent uses or public beaches. While the pilot area LCPs all take a fairly similar regulatory approach to stability of new development, the pilot area LCPs have several different approaches to the review and regulation of protection for existing development. All LCPs require that an application for a shoreline protective device be supported by technical or geologic reports; several jurisdictions encourage the use of rip-rap whenever possible and allow vertical walls only when rip-rap cannot provide adequate protection or when there are seawalls on adjacent properties. The City of Santa Cruz allows seawalls at the toe of a seacliff only when all other alternatives are infeasible. The City of Capitola allows shoreline protective devices only if non-structural alternatives are infeasible. Other localities establish some performance standards for shoreline protection, such as minimizing impacts on sand supply or to public access, but do not provide guidance as to the preferred armoring type. The different approaches used in the LC.Ps reflect some of the differences in shoreline hazards and responses to these hazards which exist throughout the ReCAP pilot area. Section 3 0610 of the Coastal Act indirectly addresses protection of shoreline development through the reconstruction of structures that have been destroyed by natural disaster. The policy provides that if the replacement structure is in the same location as the destroyed structure and not more than 10% larger or higher than the destroyed structure, no coastal development permit (CDP) is required for the replacement structure. If the replacement structure will be further back from an eroding bluff or higher above the flood elevation than the destroyed structure, the replacement will not be exempt and a CDP must be obtained. While an intent of this policy is to prevent permit delays following a disaster event, its implementation may have cumulative impacts by precluding the examination of risk reducing alternatives. In cases where seawalls have been destroyed by natural events, this policy may perpetuate the reliance on an inadequate seawall design; in cases where bluff top structures have been destroyed by storms, this policy may perpetuate the use of inadequate setbacks. If the permit process is the only mechanism for an analysis of the stability of the replacement structure, property owners can rebuild without any analysis of the future risks of such activity. The City of Santa Cruz, the County of Santa Cruz, and the Carmel area LCPs have policies addressing reconstruction of structures destroyed by natural disaster. The other LCPs in the ReCAP area do not give any guidance on how such projects will be handled. The City of Santa Cruz and the Carmel Area LCPs follow Section 30610 completely and the County of Santa Cruz LCP bases the requirements for reconstruction on the value of the losses. If the losses exceed 50% of the value, the reconstruction is treated the same as new development, requiring a technical report and deed restriction. (Such reconstruction does riot have to demonstrate long- term stability without shoreline protection, as would be required were Coastal Act Section 30253(2) to apply). In general, the guidance provided by the Coastal Act and LCP policies relating to shoreline armoring is to try to site new development to avoid the need for any type of protective device; however, if development is threatened by erosion, shoreline armoring will be allowed to protect the development, with efforts made to minimize the impacts from the protection. In terrns of reconstruction policy, except for those areas covered by the Santa Cruz County LCP, if the hazard is sufficient to actually cause damage to the development, a similar structure can be rebuilt in the same location without a CDP; however, relocation or redesign for greater safety PAGE 16 CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION CHAPTER 3 - COASTAL HAZARDS would likely require complete review and a CDP. These policies together have established a long-term reliance on shoreline armoring to protect private and public development. Resource Conditions The pilot area, from the San Mateo/Santa Cruz county line south through Point Lobos in Monterey, offers a variety of shoreline types and is an excellent area to examine the concerns of cumulative impacts of shoreline erosion and responses to erosion. There are three separate littoral cells within the pilot region, shown in Figure 3-2. The shore characteristics range physically from beaches and dunes to lagoons and steep granite cliffs; the upland uses range from low and high density residential and commercial to parks and agricultural lands. Figure 3-3 (page 21) shows the locations of shoreline armoring throughout the ReCAP pilot area, based on a review of aerial photographs from 1978, 1986 and 1993. Due to the cost of, and impacts from, armoring, it is rarely undertaken in areas where there is not now or has not been a pressing need for protection. As can be seen from Figure 3-3, armoring has concentrated mainly in those developed areas which combine highly erosive shoreline material with a high instance of storm wave attack. The section of coast from Corcoran Lagoon to Soquel Point, for example, is completely armored except for one small lot, approximately 60 feet wide. 3 Areas where the shoreline material is very resistant to wave erosion and areas which have some natural protection from storm waves have had very little armoring activity. There has been an historic demand for shoreline protection throughout the ReCAP pilot area, beginning in Santa Cruz County. In 197 1, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) undertook an inventory of the California shoreline and found approximately three miles of armored shoreline in the ReCAP area, all located in the City of Santa Cruz from Natural Bridges to Soquel Point. Small areas south of this were armored, but the amounts were too little to tabulate.4 The ACOE did not identify any protection in Monterey County. As part of the ReCAP analysis, aerial photographs of the pilot area for 1978, 1986 and 1993 were examined for armoring. This review differed from the work done by the ACOE and, without knowledge of the techniques used by the ACOE, the results can not be compared quantitatively; nevertheless, a qualitative comparison shows substantial increases in the amount of armoring throughout the ReCAP pilot area between 1971 and 1978. As shown in Figure 3-4, by 1978, there were approximately 9.6 miles of armoring in the ReCAP area 6 miles in Santa Cruz County and 3.6 miles in the ReCAP portion of Monterey Figure 3-4: Shoreline Armoring in the ReCAP Region, 1978, 1986 and 1993 12 10 3.7 77 8 0 Monterey MILES 6 E Santa Cruz 4- 2-- 0 4- 1978 1986 1993 @m Source: Aerial Photo interpretation, Jon VanCoops, Cal ifornia Coastal Commission, 1994.

By 1986, a total of 11.9 miles were armored, with 8.2 miles in Santa Cruz County and 3.7 miles in the ReCAP portion of Monterey County. By 1993, additional armoring in Santa Cruz County increased the amounts of armored shoreline to 8.3 miles for Santa Cruz County and 12 miles for the entire ReCAP area. None of these estimates include lengths of beaches protected by breakwaters, jetties or groins, nor do the figures for length reflect the maintenance and additions of rock to existing walls. Much of the increase in armoring between 1978 and 1986 is thought to have been constructed in response to the storms in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Almost all of the shoreline protection in the ReCAP area is provided by rip-rap or rock rubble revetments, with only about 1. 1 miles of protection from concrete or timber seawalls without rock. Rock is often less expensive than a vertical wall and is considered by many to be more \"natural\" looking -- possible reasons for the preference given to rip-rap by some of the LCPs in the ReCAP pilot region. However, rock takes up much more land or beach area than a vertical wall and, when constructed on a public beach, can replace area used for access and recreation. In some locations in the ReCAP area, access to shorefront property is so difficult that the shoreline protection design is more dependent on the means of placing the structures than on the coastal characteristics.5 ReCAP staff undertook a review of aerial photographs and land use plans to identify potential areas of future growth and shoreline armoring in the pilot area. Much of the shoreline land within the urban service areas has been developed and the only areas with a significant amount of vacant urban shoreline are Sand City, Marina, and Del Monte Forest. In both southern Santa Cruz County and northern Monterey County, there are large holdings of shoreline property that are zoned agricultural. Some of the agricultural lands have levees for protection from flooding but none now have any seawalls or revetments for protection from erosion. This is likely to continue since erosion seems to be small in many of the areas of agricultural land and armoring for a large agricultural parcel would be very expensive. Unless there is major rezoning of agricultural shoreline lands, the key shoreline hazard concerns in the pilot area will come from repair and maintenance of existing armoring and new armoring to protect either existing development or new development on infill lots. From this rough review of existing land use patterns and shoreline characteristics, the ReCAP team estimated that up to a third of the entire ReCAP area shoreline, combining developed or developable land, has a significant rate of erosion. If current armoring practices continue, ultimately as much as 19.3 miles of the Santa Cruz County shoreline and 8.4 miles of the ReCAP portion of Monterey County could be armored to protect either private development or public works and infrastructure (including development immediately landward of public beaches as has happened in the Live Oak area of Santa Cruz County for protection of East Cliff Drive). This would more than double the length of armoring that exists in the ReCAP area today. Permit Activity from 1983 to 1993 Related to Shoreline Armoring. Just as the examination of the shoreline conditions over time shows increases in armoring in the pilot area, a review of the permit activity in the ReCAP area from 1983-1993 shows approval of numerous permits for shoreline protection. Many shoreline protection projects were revised during the permit review process,- and many projects had conditions attached to the approval to mitigate impacts; one project was initially denied but after several appeals was approved with conditions. One hundred shoreline protection permits were approved for the ReCAP region during this time period: 4 for beach nourishment projects and 96 for some form of seawall, bulkhead, revetment, or cave filling. All four beach nourishment projects were approved by the Commigsion and were associated with dredging projects.6 Of the 96 armoring projects, 79 were approved by the Commission and the remaining 17 were approved by ReCAP area local governments. 7 CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION PAGE 19 RECAP PILOT PROJECT Figure 3-5 shows the geographic location of the approved armoring projects. The majority of approved seawall projects from 1983-1993 have taken place in the northern portion of the ReCAP pilot region. The permit database indicates that 47 seawall projects were in the Figure 3-5: Approved Seawall Locations by LCP Jurisdiction, ReCAP Region 1983-1993 3, \"A Sand City -J, @-J A\"6 Carrnel City @q 2\"@a M, m s (M Loml government per it DA \"N 4 Capitola 6, V's Capitola CCC w\" permits '_0 \"k '0 - ''_ @' '0@ Pacific Grove e) K_\" tp@ 'A \"k, Monterey City 'o A L M Santa Cruz City Monterey County Santa Cruz County 0 6 10 is 20 26 30 35 40 46 60 S urce: RoCAP Database, Hazards :ub-module.

When the approved seawalls in the Capitola and Santa Cruz City LCP jurisdictions are summed with those in Santa Cruz County (representing all approved seawall activity along the Santa Cruz County shoreline), nearly 66% of all seawall project activity in the-ReCAP pilot area was located in the northern portion of Monterey Bay. The shoreline protection placed as a result of the 100 approved permits from 1983-1993 was primarily a response to private development interests: 59% of the approved projects were to protect private residential, commercial, or industrial development, 15% to protect institutions or harbors, 21% to protect public works or rublic recreation interests, and the remaining 5% to protect some other type of development. While 30 of the 96 armoring permits were approved for new seawalls or revetments, 63 were for some form of repair, maintenance, or expansion to an existing shoreline structure and 3 projects were unclear as to their associated activity. One reason for the high number of permits involved with modifications of existing structures is that most of the armoring in the pilot region is made up of rip-rap revetment which requires regular additions of rock for the structure to function effectively. Table 3-1 (page 23) identifies some cumulative effects of the armoring that have been permitted from 1983 to 1993 -- many of the activities that have contributed to the current 12 miles of armored shoreline. Table 3-1 also shows the lengths of the approved seawalls as well as tons of rip-rap placed over the time period of 1983-1993. Unfortunately, complete records of lengths and tonnage were not readily available. Of these 96 projects, 40 had some length recorded and 38 had some tonnage of rip-rap recorded. Using the cases where these project attributes were noted, totals and averages overall as well as for respective years are presented. It is clear that the permit activity following the 1983 storms accounts for the majority of armoring activity, making over 50% of the noted length and over 40% of the rip-rap tonnage. Overall, more than 2 miles of approved seawall activity and over 65,000 tons of approved rip-rap were identified in the ReCAP area from 1983 through 1993. (Since these values were developed from only a portion of all the permits approved from 1983 to 1993, actual lengths and tons will be higher). On average, where project attributes were noted, a typical approved ReCAP pilot area armoring project involved 345 linear feet of coastline and 1,714 tons of rip-rap; further breakdown shows that for private development in the form of residential, commercial, or industrial uses, a typical average project was slightly smaller at 227 linear feet and 1205 tons of PAGE 20 CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION Sanla Cruz Coun 7YPE, APPROXIMATE Lrxom 0977,liq86'li California Coastal Commission 1.

It is not possible to graph historic demand and extrapolate since the conditions that establish the demand will continue to change. ReCAP's predicted trend for future armoring was based on assumptions regarding the amounts of development which may be threatened in the future by erosion. In Santa Cruz County, 19.4 miles of upland shoreline are privately owned and 17.8 miles are publicly owned; in the ReCAP portion of Monterey County, approximately 16.3 miles of upland shoreline are privately owned and 24.5 are publicly owned. In the total ReCAP area, there are 3 5.7 miles of shoreline which have been or may be developed with private upland development, and much of this has required, or eventually may require, shoreline armoring. A study by the ACOE provides a second identification that new portions of shoreline may be armored in the future. As part of a. study on shoaling at Santa Cruz Harbor, 10 the ACOE studied the section of Santa Cruz coast from Seabright Beach to New Brighton State Beach for shoreline geology, status of existing protection and current hazard level from erosion. Although large stretches of this 4.8 miles of coast have been armored, the study identified several areas where continued erosion can be expected to endanger development and structures in the future. If the shoreline is unprotected or has inadequate protection and the historic erosion rate is moderate or high, the study identified the area as liable to need future protection. Based on this screening effort, 1.9 miles of coast were considered in need of future protection. Of these 1.9 miles, 0.7 miles would be required to prevent road closures or relocation of utilities and 0.4 miles would be required to protect homes or apartments from erosion; almost 0.8 miles would be to protect vacant coastal land. Some of the proposed protection were efforts to restore the functioning of the natural groins at Pleasure Point and Peeper's Beach, enhance the beach building ability of these areas, enhance recreational opportunities and add 82,500 square feet of CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION PAGE 23 RECAP PILOT PROJECT beach total;'1no estimates were made of the recreational losses which would result from the encroachment of 1.9 miles of seawalls and revetments. HAZARDS PROBLEM ONE Many coastal areas contain a variety of shoreline protective devices. There is little attempt, in most cases, to design shoreline armoring to address regional resources or constraints. Adjoining properties, with similar wave climate and geology, have a variety of protective Isolutions' all represented to be appropriate to the site. The only review for protective structures provided by the Coastal Act is that the structures be \"designed to eliminate or mitigate adverse impacts on local sand supply\" (Section 30235); no regional consistency is required. W Mr N & In the ReCAP area, the geology of certain \"regions\" varies considerably. Geologic conditions for the coast of Santa Cruz County include a moderately resistant mudstone in the northern cliffed areas and sedimentary formations of sandstone and siltstone in the southern portion. Monterey Countys north coast consists of mostly beach and dune features -- relatively young dunes such as the Marina Dune complex, as well as older.dunes such as the inland portions of the former Fort Ord military reservation. The southern portion of Monterey County's coastline consists of mostly resistant granite rock with interlying sandy pocket beaches. Generally in the Monterey Bay pilot area, with the exception of few specific localities, the coastline is eroding, losing large quantities of sand naturally to the offshore submarine canyons and some to the inland dune systems. While the ReCAP pilot area offers a variety of shoreline types, many smaller portions of the shoreline have common features. Segments of the bay's shoreline may be broken down into \"regions\" while considering such factors as geology, wave conditions, and natural sand budget, to name a few. At a large scale, the shoreline can be divided into littoral cells which share common characteristics of sediment sources and transport. On a smaller scale, there are stretches of coast bounded by lagoons or headlands which have a similar geology and wave climate. These common factors should affect the types of armoring which will be most effective for a portion of shoreline; however, in many portions of the ReCAP area, the strategies used to provide shoreline protection differ greatly from one property to the next, in spite of the apparent physical similarities between the sites. Shoreline protective measures in portions of the ReCAP pilot area generally lack any regional scheme for dealing with erosion. For example, in many coastal permits for projects within Santa Cruz County, geologic analyses often consider regional wave conditions and/or tectonics, but rarely do these reports consider sand budgets or regional sand supplies. Santa Cruz Harbor was constructed before the Coastal Act came into effect and thus it never received review through the California Coastal Management Program (CCMP); however, this project illustrates both the regional effects which can accompany a single project and the importance of a regional overview of projects which may modify shoreline processes. Since the harbor has been constructed, an expansive beach has developed upcoast of the jetties where there once had been significant erosion; downcoast areas as far as Capitola have experienced profound decreases in PAGE 24 CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION CHAPTER 3 - COASTAL HAZARDS sand supplies and increased shoreline retreat. Since construction of the harbor, there have been at least six regional studies investigating ways to address these downcoast effects. 12 The Live Oak area of Santa Cruz County illustrates a second situation which can arise when individual projects are undertaken without a regional overview to guide shoreline activity. Much of the shoreline has been armored; numerous protective efforts exist in close proximity to each other and review of permit activity shows repeated activity at some sites. Figure 3-6 shows a mosaic of permit activity for one small section of coast within Live Oak along Opal Cliffs. This plethora of armoring and permit activity makes comprehensive review difficult -- work has been done through the emergency process, through regular Commission issued permits and through local permits. Within this 3,000 foot long section of shoreline, properties have been protected with gunite, vertical walls, rip-rap and concrete cylinders. Some properties were issued two or three permits for different armoring activities, properties received permits for one type of protection and different armoring was actually constructed, new properties have been added to existing permits through the amendment process, and several properties received local permits without any conditions for access. A regional overview of this segment of coast could have identified the major factors contributing to erosion and identified an effective strategy for the \"region\" to address natural shoreline processes. Such an overview might identify recommended treatments for various areas, such as where revetments may be most effective, areas where vertical walls may be most effective, areas where surface treatment of the bluff (gunite, rock bolting, etc.) may be most effective, and finally, areas where beach nourishment or sand management may be most effective. Applicants could use this general direction to design a site-specific solution. As a second type'of regional overview, some local governments have prepared \"standard\" designs for shoreline protection which can be used in specified areas. 13 Applicants can use these designs in the specified areas or identify different efforts for protection which better suit the site-specific conditions. The existing situation in Live Oak, however, presents a piecemeal confusion of protective measures. From an engineering perspective, the weakest points in shoreline armoring are normally the ends and the junctions between different styles of protection (rock adjacent to concrete to gunite, for example). Such ends and junctions occur frequently in the Live Oak area, and while no engineering evaluation has been prepared, the potential for weaknesses in the protection would be greatly reduced by a regional approach to controlling erosion in the area. In addition, the general look and aesthetic of the area would change if adjoining properties had shoreline protection efforts with a similar visual effect. A final support for a regional overview of shoreline activity comes from an earlier analysis of coastal hazards by Gary Griggs, James Pepper and Martha Jordan, in which they find, Since these decisions are usually made on a project-hy-project basis, they tend to be evaluated independently, without any systematic consideration of the aggregate or cumulative effects either within or amongjurisdictions. Within such a decision-making context any given project can be viewed as small and thus easy to rationalize in terms of approval. Cairns (1986) calls this endemic failure to take into account the agregate effects of environmental management \"the tyranny ofsmall decisions \". A regional overview for individual shoreline activity would provide coastal planners and analysts a perspective on how an individual project would fit into the overall cumulative approach to shoreline management.

The attempt to minimize coastal hazards with various devices (seawalls and numerous rip-rap structures), combined with naturally occurring coastal processes, requires a closer examination of their cumulative impacts. Piecemeal solutions to coastal erosion problems are not generally effective and have the potential to create further problems. Often overlooked are the regional effects of such shoreline protection. Where a regional coastal erosion problem exists, a regional solution should be developed and implemented. The ReCAP pilot area has had many years of experience with a variety of armoring devices. It should be possible to study the on-site impacts, possible downcoast impacts and maintenance records for these structures and determine which types are most effective in different areas. From such information, local governments would be able to make sound decisions about the types of armoring which would be allowed in the fiiture. @7 - I MINOR, MM 17 @__b qM M _Eq N_ Program Improvements- � Develop procedural guidance for defining and delineating all areas of high coastal hazards in the pilot area coastline; these areas should then further be broken down into smaller regions that share the same geologic and ocean processes. These \"regional\" or \"sub-regional\" breakdowns of the pilot area coastline should consider, but not be limited to, such factors as geology, wave conditions, and sand budget situation. Regions would not necessarily be bounded by city or county jurisdictions, but would follow the bounds established by the physical characteristics of the coast. � Prepare procedural guidance for the development of regional shoreline erosion and bluff retreat management plans suitable for implementation by ReCAP area LCP jurisdictions that are broken down by the defined geologic sub-regions taking into account the specific geologic and geographic constraints of the subject area and incorporating concerns and regulations governing protective devices along the shoreline as well as the sand budget situation within the specified \"region\". The framework for this guidance would include, but not be limited to: 0 Standard engineering plans defining the specific types of armoring which would be acceptable for specific areas, and where appropriate, identification of the types of armoring which should never be considered for certain areas. 0 Standard alternatives feasibility analysis worksheet that would be a required element of all hazard response projects and that would require applicants to go through a series of steps to assure that hard protective devices were only created as a last resort. The analysis may require, but not be limited to, the use of technical evaluations of the site (geotechnical reports, engineering geology reports, etc.), an examination of all other options (removal, relocation, \"do nothing\", sand replenishment, etc.), and a conclusion that a shoreline protective device would be the \"best option\" (most protective of the public trust, best long term solution, etc.) for the subject site. 0 Standard conditions and monitoring requirements that may include discussion of mechanisms to ensure shoreline protection effectiveness and public safety with CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION PAGE 27 RECAP PILOT PROJECT provisions for the removal of ineffective or hazardous protective structures as well as programs to address beach replenishment and sand supply. erm. Obbortunitieis In the Loh;giRr,,T � Provide guidance for the development of regional programs for managing and expanding shoreline sand resources through such mechanisms as aggressive beach nourishment, especially for areas where beach sand loss exceeds supply. � Provide guidance for ReCAP area LCP jurisdictions to address major watershed projects -- both in and outside the coastal zone -- for impacts to shoreline sand supply issues, particularly in areas with sediment deficits. � Pursue expanding Section 30235 of the Coastal Act governing protective devices to require that protective efforts be compatible with both regional conditions and with the protective efforts used for properties in the same shoreline region. HAZARDS PROBLEM TWO Incremental impacts to beach areas, access and the general character of the shoreline have occurred from approval of permits for shoreline armoring. Over the ReCAP time period, there have been measurable losses in beach access through increases in the length and area extent of shoreline armoring, but many permits have been approved without any conditions directed at access impacts. For M 01 1 1, Public access concerns are not always addressed in permits for shoreline armoring. Review of approved shoreline armoring in the ReCAP region from 1983-1993 identified that many projects raised some access issues, such as blocking or encroaching on lateral or vertical access, but not all such permits contained access mitigation: 8 of the projects involved some type of improvement to access facilities, and no access mitigation was needed with the project; 36 projects were required, through conditions, to improve access either through an easement, dedication, or improvements to access facilities; 45 projects had no permit conditions requiring mitigation of access impacts, but the information in the ReCAP database was not of sufficient detail to determine the types or extents of access concerns which were raised by these projects. It is likely that many of these permits with no access related condition were for repair and maintenance of existing structures. For such permits, the access concerns were likely to be the perpetuation of impacts resulting from the original structures; the major impacts to access would have resulted from the initial construction and would have been addressed in the original permit action, if the structure was built during the time of the Coastal Act. However, if any of these projects were for new structures or the physical expansion of existing structures, they would have added new constraints to access which should have been considered. Since access impacts from shoreline armoring can be significant and long-term, when access issues are raised by a project involving shoreline armoring, the individual and cumulative impacts to access should always be addressed. PAGE 28 CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION CHAPTER 3 - COASTAL HAZARDS Much of the pilot area coastline has been developed and over 12 miles have been armored, as of 1993. As noted earlier in Figure 3-3, portions of this armoring occurred prior to the Coastal Act, LCP certification and the time frame for the ReCAP study. Assuming that a vertical seawall extends 4 feet onto the beach and revetments or rubble walls extend 20 feet onto the beach, the existing 12 miles of armoring occupies over I million square feet or 25 acres of beach, not including other beach level development, such as homes, which occupy the protected beach (for example, the development at Seascape). If, as projected, 35.7 miles of shoreline may eventually rely on shoreline armoring for erosion protection, the loss of beach area could increase to 65 acres. Even with the inclusion of mitigating lateral and vertical access dedications where appropriate, clearly the loss of recreational access will be severe. Shoreline armoring alters the shoreline and shoreline processes in several ways. An immediate and noticeable effect will be the physical encroachment or occupation of the shoreline as mentioned above. If a section of beach is covered by revetment rock, the beach is no longer available for beach access. A trail may be developed on top of the revetment, and while there may be great benefit from such. a trail, the access opportunity would be different than that which had been provided by the beach area. A more long-term impact from armoring will be its interference with long-term shoreline retreat. A primary function of well designed shoreline protection is that it protect upland development by halting or slowing future landward migration of the backshore. If the seaward edge of the be"
