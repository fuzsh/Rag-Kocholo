        "text": "Stretch: Boulder Creek to Ben Lomond Difficulty: Class III or IV with cement waterfalls Distance: 6.1 miles, one short winter day Flows: kayaks 300 - 1200 then harder, IK minimum 250 Gauge: estimate 3/5 of the flow at Henry Cowell park (USGS site) Gradient: 25 fpm average Put-in: on R below Fairview bridge in Boulder Creek, 440' Take-out: on R at Highlands Park in Ben Lomond, 290' Shuttle: 5 miles (15 minutes) one-way Maps: Delorme N California, AAA San Francisco Bay, Topo1, Topo2 Season: Winter, from recent rain Agency: private, city park Notes: Â© 2010 Carl Reuter, Land and Sea Solar\n\nIf you enjoy running steep drops over concrete slabs, which you might call urban waterfalls, this is the best run I know. This stretch has four or five of them depending on where you take out. Additionally this section offers some good play spots and scenery, plus many naturally occurring rapids, mostly easy. The downstream run thru Henry Cowell park is better, but boaters who live nearby should run this upper stretch at least once.\n\nThanks to Roger Schumann of Eskape Sea Kayaking and his wife for acting as models for these kayaking pictures.\n\nmile 0\n\nPut in downstream of the bridge. Boulder Creek joins the San Lorenzo a short distance upstream. At high flows the cement falls is called Spin Cycle.\n\nYou must avoid a big rock to the left View from below shows how steep it is\n\nGood pseudo-wilderness scenery below put-in.\n\n0.8\n\nSecond Thoughts, a drop with underwater rock that uncovers as flows decrease.\n\n1.7\n\nGreen Wave, a dam with several sections, the center having the deepest water.\n\nSecond Thoughts has a submerged rock Green Wave is right below someone's house\n\n2.5\n\nBubblemaker, class III or worse. To avoid the tenacious hole, go right of the mini tree. At higher flows the hole is difficult to exit and can hold swimmers for a long time.\n\n3.3\n\nLong class III- starting at a cement crossing. Especially at high flows, enter on the left to avoid the recirculation on the right,\n\nBubblemaker has this tenacious hole Cement crossing recirculates on the right\n\n3.7\n\nSticky river-wide ledge in a wooded section.\n\n3.8\n\nTight brushy rapid with main channel on the left; needs river maintenance.\n\nCarl below sticky river-wide ledge A man's castle is his home\n\n4.6\n\nAlternate take-out just upstream of the Castle. Why did guards fail to pour boiling oil on the kayakers?\n\n6.1\n\nHighlands Park take-out on the right. Yet another cement falls to run.\n\nDownstream the gradient eases. The river is not as much fun as the upstream and downstream sections. From Highlands Park to the Felton covered bridge is 3.5 miles with a gradient of 15 fpm, steepest just before reaching Felton. Below Felton is the famous Henry Cowell Park run, class III with a class IV falls.\n\nShuttle Directions\n\nTo reach take-out, drive north from Felton on Highway 9. After passing the San Lorenzo Valley high school and junior high school, the road crosses the river twice on two closely spaced bridges. Shortly thereafter turn right into Highlands Santa Cruz County Park. Pancake breakfasts are sometimes available there on weekends.\n\nTo reach put-in from there, continue north on Highway 9. In the downtown area of Boulder Creek, turn right on East Lomond St. At the intersection of Middleton Ave, this becomes Fairview Ave, and soon crosses a bridge over the San Lorenzo. Park and put in on the west side."
