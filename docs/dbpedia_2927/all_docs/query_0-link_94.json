The seat of the county government is located in the city of Santa Cruz, which is situated just 32 miles from San Jose (“the Capital of Silicon Valley”) and 75 miles from San Francisco.\n\nGiven a location less than a 40-minute drive from Silicon Valley, many tech workers with advanced skills call Santa Cruz home. Additionally, the city has also attracted a number of major technology companies, so a growing number of residents enjoy a short drive to leading-edge tech sector jobs.\n\nLess known about Santa Cruz are the outstanding educational institutions. The county’s largest employer is the University of California at Santa Cruz, but there’s another college in the county which drives employment and the need for housing: Cabrillo College, an acclaimed two-year community college with campuses in Aptos and Watsonville. What’s more, a number of the county’s K-12 schools are best-in-class for public schools in California, having earned the California Distinguished Schools designation.\n\nWhether you’re relocating to Santa Cruz for work, school, or recreation you’ll find that the county has a great deal to offer anyone – and what it lacks, you’ll usually find that whatever you’re missing is within an hour or two’s drive. Welcome to Santa Cruz – I know you’ll love it too.\n\nWho is this Guide for?\n\n(back to top)\n\nThis guide is designed for people considering making a move to and/or investing in real estate in Santa Cruz county. Many people moving to Santa Cruz are students attending the University, with parents looking for a way to house their children and make a smart investment while they attend school. If you are one of those students or parents, this guide is for you.\n\nSanta Cruz has historically been a vacation destination. Many families throughout California own second homes in Santa Cruz county which they visit throughout the year. Santa Cruz is peppered with streets bearing the names of other cities in California, especially in neighborhoods close to the beaches. If you are thinking of purchasing a second home in Santa. Cruz county, this guide will get you well acquainted with the various regions of Santa Cruz county, so you’ll be able to zero-in on the right neighborhoods and homes for you.\n\nFor the past 40 or more years, Santa Cruz has increasingly become a bedroom community for workers in nearby Silicon Valley. Many would-be Santa Clara county homebuyers are attracted to Santa Cruz for its temperate climate, pristine beaches, clean air, good school system – and prices that are 30-40% below what a similar home would cost in Silicon Valley. With more and more employees being able to work in home, or perhaps just go into the office one or two days per week, increasing numbers of Silicon Valley tech workers are considering a move to Santa Cruz. If you’re one of those people, this guide is for you too!\n\nDemographics of Santa Cruz\n\n(back to top)\n\nThe population of the county whole is estimated at 268,000 as of 2023. Santa Cruz County has a population density of 615 people per square mile (ppsm), making it the 10th most-densely populated county in California. This compares to 1,490 ppsm in Santa Clara county, and 18,553 ppsm in San Francisco.\n\nWhen choosing a city to move to, it is worth considering the demographics of people living in the area. Overall, the demographics of Santa Cruz are diverse across several dimensions, including race, religion, lifestyle, age, skill level, and sexual orientation. Therefore, if you are thinking about moving to Santa Cruz, you should carefully consider the county’s demographics as part of your research. This relocation guide will provide you with everything that you will need to know to make an informed decision about whether you would be a good fit for the area. The best place to research any area’s demographics is on https://www.census.gov/ but you can also try a commercial web site like https://www.moving.com/ which you may find easier to navigate.\n\nAge of Residents\n\n(back to top)\n\nSanta Cruz is one of the youngest cities in the U.S. and the state of California. Although just 13 percent of the city’s population is under the age of 18, 30 percent of the city’s population is 18 to 24 years of age. On the other hand, just 8 percent of the city’s residents are 65 or older. Households are also quite small with 2.39 people living in the average home. Although the city has relatively unusual demographics, the city remains almost perfectly balanced in terms of gender with 100.3 females for every 100 males. Therefore, the city remains balanced and attractive for younger generations of adults, especially those in the tech sector.\n\nAverage Income\n\n(back to top)\n\nThe median income per household in Santa Cruz county in 2021 was $96,217, and the median single family home price was $1,275,000 for all of 2023. A quick back-of-the-napkin calculation (5x yearly income = approximate maximum mortgage amount) shows that the median household has nowhere near the income required to pay for a median-price-home mortgage. Indeed, the city and county of Santa Cruz suffer from very low affordability, with only about 13% of households being able to afford a median-priced home with 20% down.\n\nHousing in Santa Cruz\n\n(back to top)\n\nThe county of Santa Cruz is an eclectic area. In no particular order, Santa Cruz is part college town, part Silicon Valley bedroom community, part second/vacation home market, part rural/mountain small town, and part agricultural community. Since Silicon Valley is situated nearby, residents have to compete for housing with many well-qualified buyers employed with some of the biggest names in tech. Nevertheless, the style of most homes is relatively modest, with most of them around 1,500 square feet on average, built in the 1950s through 1970s. As homes turn over only about once every 22 years on average, it is common to find homes that are out-of-date and with deferred maintenance.\n\nThe most popular neighborhoods tend to be those closest to the water, within walking distance of urban amenities like restaurants, coffee shops, bars and shopping, and those homes in the service area of top-rated schools. Also, homes with bay views (especially whitewater views) are highly prized. Each of the principal regions of Santa Cruz County identified in this report gives both a median home price and average price per square foot for homes in that area.\n\nSchools in Santa Cruz County\n\n(back to top)\n\nThe University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) is the largest educational institution in Santa Cruz County. The University is one of 10 institutions that are part of the higher education system used by the University of California. The county is also home to Cabrillo College (a two-year Community College with approximately 12,000 students), preparatory schools, and plenty of well-regarded and highly ranked public and private K-12 schools.\n\nThe Top Ranked Public Schools are:\n\nPacific Collegiate School (Santa Cruz, Grades 7-12, Rated 10/10)\n\nWestlake Elementary (Santa Cruz, Grades K-5, Rated 8/10)\n\nHappy Valley Elementary (Santa Cruz, Grades K-6, Rated 9/10)\n\nBrook Knoll Elementary (Scotts Valley, Grades PK-5, Rated 8/10)\n\nScotts Valley Middle School (Scotts Valley, Grades 6-8, Rated 8/10)\n\nScotts Valley High School (Scotts Valley, Grades 9-12, Rated 8/10)\n\nMountain Elementary School (Soquel, Grades K-6, Rated 7/10)\n\nRio del Mar Elementary School (Aptos, Grades K-6, Rated 8/10)\n\nAptos High School (Aptos, Grades 9-12, Rated 8/10)\n\nTierra Pacifica Charter School (Live Oak, Grades K-8, Rated 8/10)\n\nParks in Santa Cruz County\n\n(back to top)\n\nThe natural world is one of the greatest strengths of Santa Cruz. Most populated areas are in fact dotted with or surrounded by county, city, State, and neighborhood parks. In fact, Santa Cruz county boasts the highest percentage of park land and open space in all of California’s counties. Aside from the forests, all of the beaches are operated as public parks belonging to the State, County, or the cities of Santa Cruz and Capitola.\n\nCheck out these selected parks in Santa Cruz County.\n\nBeaches in Santa Cruz County\n\n(back to top)\n\nSanta Cruz County has 29 miles of coastline open to the public. People in the area use beaches for a broad range of activities, including swimming, sunbathing, surfing, sailing, fishing, and much more. Most beaches are wide and sandy, but the water tends to be colder than beaches in Southern California. You’re probably thinking that the beaches play a large role in the lives of people who live in Santa Cruz – and you’re right. Beach culture thrives in Santa Cruz, and most people who live here or want to call Santa Cruz home gravitate to neighborhoods as close to the coast as possible.\n\nSome of the popular beaches in Santa Cruz county include:\n\nCowell Beach / Santa Cruz Main Beach\n\nCapitola Beach\n\nNatural Bridges State Beach\n\nNew Brighton State Beach\n\nTwin Lakes Beach\n\nPlatforms Beach\n\nRio del Mar Beach\n\nSeacliff State Beach\n\nBonny Doon State Beach\n\nFour Mile Beach\n\nMajor Roads in Santa Cruz County\n\n(back to top)\n\nThere are only a few major roads in Santa Cruz county you need to be aware of, to help you orient yourself in the county.\n\nHighway 17\n\nThis is the winding road that connects Santa Clara county with Santa Cruz county, over the Santa Cruz mountains. The highway ends in downtown Santa Cruz on Ocean Street.\n\nHighway 9\n\nThis is another mountain road which begins near downtown Santa Cruz and becomes River Street. Highway 9 goes up through the San Lorenzo Valley and goes over the mountains to Saratoga. Nearly all of the commercial businesses in the San Lorenzo Valley towns are to be found on Highway 9.\n\nHighway 1 / Mission Street\n\nHighway 1 runs along a big chunk of California’s coast, and it passes through Santa Cruz as well, where it is called Mission Street. It is the main road which will take you from the county’s northern extreme to the southern border, and through the cities and towns of Davenport, Santa Cruz, Capitola, Live Oak, Aptos, La Selva Beach, and Watsonville. The road can be extremely congested during rush hours. It’s not uncommon to spend an hour or so, sitting on Highway 1 going from Santa Cruz to Aptos on late Friday afternoon – a distance of only about 8 miles.\n\nSoquel Avenue / Soquel Drive\n\nSoquel Avenue begins in downtown Santa Cruz and runs through the city and changes its name to Soquel Drive once you cross Highway 1. Soquel Drive runs all the way down to Freedom Boulevard at Highway 1 in Aptos, and from then on to go further to south county you’ll be taking either Freedom Blvd. or Highway 1.\n\nFreedom Boulevard\n\nFreedom Boulevard runs from Aptos, straight into the heart of Watsonville. It’s a rural road for much of its length, running through the less developed areas of Aptos and Corralitos. When it hits Watsonville, it becomes of that city’s most developed commercial streets, before terminating in the heart of town.\n\n41st Avenue\n\n41st Avenue runs from the world-famous surf spot known as “the Hook” at Pleasure Point in Live Oak, and goes on through the city of Capitola. It crosses over Highway 1 which is the edge of Capitola, and terminates on Soquel Drive in Soquel.\n\nTransportation in Santa Cruz County\n\n(back to top)\n\nTwo public highways – Highways 9 and 17, connect Santa Cruz with Santa Clara county. Highway 1 connects Santa Cruz county with San Mateo county to the north and Monterey county to the south.\n\nBus service is available between San Jose and Santa Cruz via a number of carriers including Santa Cruz METRO. There is likewise public bus service to Salinas, Monterey, and other parts south.\n\nHighway 1 runs from north to south through most of the county. Highway 1 can be extremely congested during rush hour – or almost any hour. Highway 1 has been widened to three lanes for a distance of about two miles connecting the city of Santa Cruz with Live Oak\n\nThe local public bus system is called Santa Cruz METRO. The service provided by METRO has been steadily reduced over the years, and many less-populated areas of the county no longer have any public bus service. METRO does, however, offer a ParaCruz service which is a complementary paratransit service offering accessible door-to-door shared rides for people who are not able to use the bus due to a physical, cognitive, or psychiatric disability.\n\nTaxi service is usually not readily available anywhere in the county, as there are few commercial taxis operating in the area. Fortunately, ride hailing apps such as Uber and Lyft do of course work in Santa Cruz. Santa Cruz County Measure D, passed in 2016, did allow for the creation of a number of clearly marked bike lanes throughout the county, but bicycling in Santa Cruz remains a statistically dangerous proposition.\n\nSanta Cruz is home to a mostly abandoned rail corridor, which is owned by the Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission (SCCRTC or RTC for short). The RTC is planning to establish passenger rail service alongside a pedestrian/bicycle path in the corridor. A vocal contingent of citizens is working to pull the current tracks entirely and convert it to a “trail only,” as it seems unlikely that a small community such as Santa Cruz could afford a project of that scope with such high capital and operating costs.\n\nOnline Resources for Santa Cruz County\n\n(back to top)\n\nSanta Cruz is located just the other side of the hill from Silicon Valley, so it’s perhaps not surprising that Santa Cruz has its own app: “My Santa Cruz”. This app is designed to allow County residents to report potholes, trash, dead birds, abandoned vehicle, dead deer, encampments, graffiti, illegal dumping, sewer spills, street signs down, tree trimming, standing water and environmental health complaints to local officials and track the progress. The app also enables the public to register to vote, view or pay property tax bills, explore the County’s parks system, schedule Building Inspections and conduct other county business.\n\nMy Santa Cruz County App (iOS/Android)\n\nHere are the most useful online resources for Santa Cruz county\n\nSanta Cruz County YouTube Playlist\n\nSanta Cruz Public Library – Local Information\n\nWhat’s My Parcel Number?\n\nSanta Cruz GISWeb Mapping Site\n\nParcel Information Report\n\nSanta Cruz Permit History Search\n\nSanta Cruz County Department of Environmental Health Records\n\nEvent Calendars\n\n(back to top)\n\nVisit Santa Cruz County – Upcoming Events\n\nSantaCruz.com Event Calendar\n\nGrowing up in Santa Cruz Event Calendar\n\nKZSC Event Calendar\n\nUC Santa Cruz Event Calendar\n\nOrganizations, Clubs, Associations and Communities\n\n(back to top)\n\nChapters of most major civic and service clubs can be found in Santa Cruz. The Rotary Club, Lions Club, the Elks Club, and Toastmasters all have chapters in Santa Cruz. Hundreds of additional clubs, societies, and meetup groups can be found to meet the needs of residents with almost any interests. You can find lots of groups that have interests similar to yours by searching on Meetup.com and EventBrite.com.\n\nHere are some of the larger and more popular groups in Santa Cruz County:\n\nSanta Cruz County Business Council Santa Cruz Host Lion’s Club Leadership Santa Cruz County Santa Cruz Small Business Development Council Aptos Chamber of Commerce Santa Cruz Swing Dance Club Capitola/Soquel Chamber of Commerce Ukulele Club of Santa Cruz Santa Cruz Area Chamber of Commerce Architect’s Association of Santa Cruz County San Lorenzo Valley Chamber of Commerce Santa Cruz Astronomy Club Pajaro Valley Chamber of Commerce Coastal Dog Owners Group San Lorenzo Valley Chamber of Commerce Santa Cruz Bird Club Santa Cruz County Bar Association Santa Cruz Track Club Santa Cruz County Farm Bureau Santa Cruz Yacht Club Santa Cruz SPCA Local Harvest Santa Cruz Elks Santa Cruz Art League Watsonville Elks Santa Cruz Toy Makers Santa Cruz Rotary Santa Cruz Toastmasters Santa Cruz County Association of REALTORS Insight Santa Cruz Boulder Creek Business Association Downtown Association of Santa Cruz\n\nBusiness Districts in Santa Cruz County\n\n(back to top)\n\nA variety of shopping centers, districts, and other retail establishments is available to residents of Santa Cruz. Pacific Avenue forms the heart of downtown in the city of Santa Cruz; it is usually bustling with musicians, artists, and street performers who provide entertainment outside shops and cafes. This area is well known by the name the Pacific Garden Mall and is the best-known commercial district in the county.\n\nAside from the Pacific Garden Mall, there are a few other notable commercial districts and streets in Santa Cruz County. When it comes to owning residential real estate, it’s a smart idea to buy within walking distance of a commercial district – but not so close that you’ll be overly impacted by traffic and noise. This means that homes which are a distance of about 1-6 blocks from these areas are often the most sought-after.\n\nCity of Santa Cruz\n\nPacific Avenue\n\n(aka the Pacific Garden Mall)\n\nMission Street / Highway 1\n\nWater Street\n\nOcean Street\n\nSoquel Avenue\n\nSeabright Avenue @ Murray Street\n\nCapitola\n\n41st Avenue\n\nCapitola Avenue\n\nCapitola Road\n\nCapitola Village\n\nLive Oak\n\nSoquel Avenue\n\nPortola Drive\n\nCapitola Road\n\n17th Avenue\n\n41st Avenue\n\nAptos\n\nSoquel Drive\n\nAptos Village\n\nSeascape Village\n\nSeacliff Village\n\nScotts Valley\n\nMount Hermon Road\n\nScotts Valley Drive\n\nSan Lorenzo Valley\n\nHighway 9 in Felton\n\nHighway 9 in Ben Lomond\n\nHighway 9 in Boulder Creek\n\nSoquel\n\nSoquel Village\n\n41st Avenue\n\nWatsonville\n\nMain Street\n\nFreedom Blvd\n\nEast Lake Avenue\n\nEast Beach Street\n\nLocal Trends\n\n(back to top)\n\nSanta Cruz is thought of as a progressive community, and in some respects that is true. However, there is a deep conservatism ingrained in the community: folks want to keep what remains of the old Santa Cruz. Most developments, residential or commercial, are fought tooth and nail: residents don’t want more people, more traffic, more noise.\n\nIn the late 1970s, in reaction to a boom of development in the 1960s and 1970s, the county passed Measure J, which was aimed at slowing growth through a variety of mechanisms. This antipathy towards development has ironically led to a shift in population over time. Many locals have found themselves unable to afford to live in the community, as there has been little commercial or residential development since the passage of Measure J. The population has grown, but jobs, wages, and housing construction have not kept pace.\n\nThe population has grown by new entrants into the community, many of whom have high-paying jobs in the Silicon Valley (or the University). “Outsiders” are attracted to Santa Cruz for the relatively low cost of real estate (compared with most other parts of the San Francisco Bay Area), clean air, natural beauty, and decent schools. This is leading to a change in the makeup of the community, and a growing openness to change.\n\nClimate in Santa Cruz\n\n(back to top)\n\nSanta Cruz enjoys well-deserved fame for its Mediterranean climate. The weather is generally moderate throughout the year. Average highs in Santa Cruz range from 61 degrees in December to 75 degrees in June and July. There are however vast differences in climate throughout the county: the closer you are to the beach, the cooler the temperature. The farther up in the mountains, you can expect less fog and clouds, more sun, and higher temperatures in summer but cooler (and wetter) months in the winter.\n\nFestivals, Activities and Events in Santa Cruz County\n\n(back to top)\n\nIt seems there’s always something going on in Santa Cruz. There are numerous events, expositions, festivals and fairs that go on throughout the year. They come, and they go – some have been around for years, others are new but already very popular and feel like they’re here to stay. Some of the better known are:\n\nSanta Cruz Film Festival\n\nWoodies on the Wharf\n\nWharf to Wharf Race\n\nOpen Studios Art Tour\n\nGreek Culture and Food Festival\n\nRedwood Mountain Faire\n\nSanta Cruz County Fair\n\nPleasure Point Street Fair\n\nSanta Cruz Downtown Holiday Parade\n\nHalloween in Downtown Santa Cruz\n\nWorld’s Shortest Parade for 4th of July\n\nStrawberry Festival\n\nChurch Street Fair\n\nCapitola Plein Air\n\nArt and Wine Festivals in Santa Cruz County\n\n(back to top)\n\nThere is a monthly art festival in Santa Cruz called First Friday. As its name suggests, First Friday is an art show that takes place on the first Friday of every month. Artists from throughout the local Bay Area bring their artwork to attend.\n\nThere’s also the annual Capitola Art and Wine Festival. Grape growers from throughout the greater Bay Area and even from other parts of California, such as Napa Valley, showcase their finest wines at the event.\n\nNot to be outdone, Scotts Valley hosts the Scotts Valley Art, Wine and Beer Festival at Skypark in August. The Santa Cruz Mountain Winegrowers Association has been sponsoring the Aptos Wine Wander for the past several years in the spring, and Soquel holds a Soquel Village Sip and Stroll in July.\n\nHealth Care in Santa Cruz County\n\n(back to top)\n\nThe health care options in Santa Cruz have grown considerably in the past several years. There are still only two major hospitals in the county (Dominican Hospital, located on Soquel Drive in Live Oak, and Watsonville Community Hospital).\n\nAside from the hospitals, Sutter Health (aka the Palo Alto Medical Foundation) operates a number of clinics throughout the county. Notably, they operate the Sutter Maternity and Surgical Center, across the street from Dominican Hospital.\n\nKaiser Permanente has finally made its way to Santa Cruz County as well. Kaiser has three locations in Santa Cruz: Scotts Valley, Santa Cruz, and Watsonville.\n\nSports in Santa Cruz County\n\n(back to top)\n\nSanta Cruz is home to a broad range of options for sports lovers. While the area is too small to support any major national sports franchises, there is no shortage of local recreational and competitive sporting groups, especially for soccer and baseball. The public is also welcomed to take part in activities on the city’s beaches, including jogging, volleyball, surfing, and much more. Teams are even available for children and seniors.\n\nSanta Cruz / Golden State Warriors\n\nAlthough Santa Cruz is too small to have its own major league professional basketball team, local basketball fans can watch games at the arena of the Santa Cruz Warriors in downtown Santa Cruz. The Santa Cruz Warriors are part of the NBA G League. The G League is the official minor league for the NBA, preparing players, coaches, officials, trainers, and front-office staff for the NBA while acting as the league’s research and development laboratory. The Santa Cruz Warriors are directly affiliated with the Golden State Warriors.\n\nRoller Derby\n\nSanta Cruz is home to one of the world’s most famous roller derby leagues in the world. The Santa Cruz Derby Girls is only available to females, but it offers intense full-contact fun for women who enjoy a fast-paced sport. The team is also highly competitive, so it also offers fun that local spectators can enjoy. Home games are played in the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium located in downtown Santa Cruz.\n\nMedia in Santa Cruz County\n\n(back to top)\n\nAlthough much of the local media that people in Santa Cruz consume comes from the nearby San Francisco Bay Area, there is plenty of media coverage available for residents who want to keep up with news in their local community.\n\nRadio Stations\n\nThere are a number of radio stations in Santa Cruz County. Some of the most popular include:\n\nKZSC 88.1 FM (Variety)\n\nKBCZ 90.1 FM (Boulder Creek Community Radio)\n\nKSQD 90.7 FM (Public Radio)\n\nKXZM 93.7 FM (Regional Mexican)\n\nKSQL 99.1 FM (Regional Mexican)\n\nKPIG 107.5 (Americana Music)\n\nKSCO 1080 AM (Talk)\n\nKOMY 1340 AM (Oldies)\n\nTelevision Stations in Santa Cruz County\n\nAs a small community, Santa Cruz does not have any traditional television stations. But two stations serve the Salinas, Monterey, and Santa Cruz markets:\n\nKION TV 5/46\n\nKSBW TV 8\n\nSanta Cruz does have Community Television of Santa Cruz County, which is not broadcast but available on Cable/Satellite TV and on the Internet.\n\nSanta Cruz Newspapers\n\nAlthough the traditional print newspaper industry has been in decline, many of the bigger newspapers in Santa Cruz have managed to hold on. The Santa Cruz Sentinel, Register Pajaronian, and San Jose Mercury News are the largest papers circulating in Santa Cruz County. The San Jose Mercury News covers the Bay Area as a whole, but the Register Pajaronian and Santa Cruz Sentinel focus primarily on the audience in Santa Cruz.\n\nThe Good Times is a long-standing popular weekly newspaper as well, and the Times Publishing Group puts out weekly papers Scotts Valley, Aptos, and Capitola/Soquel. The Press-Banner is a weekly newspaper serving the communities of the San Lorenzo Valley and Scotts Valley.\n\nMagazines\n\nAs an area with a lively and literate community, Santa Cruz is home to several notable magazines. Santa Cruz Waves is the biggest magazine in Santa Cruz, and it covers a broad range of topics about beaches, surfing, and the lifestyle that Santa Cruz epitomizes. The Comic News is another magazine which has been around for years. Growing up in Santa Cruz is a local monthly magazine which is tailor made for families with children (they also have a terrific events calendar).\n\nFacebook Groups\n\n(back to top)\n\nLike anywhere else, Santa Cruz county has myriad Facebook groups for people who live in (and visit) Santa Cruz County. Some of the most popular Facebook groups which you might want to check into are:\n\nSanta Cruz Housing\n\nLGBTQ Santa Cruz\n\nSanta Cruz, CA Rental Network\n\nUC Santa Cruz Unofficial Parent Group\n\nSanta Cruz Moms\n\nBoulder Creek Neighbors\n\nScotts Valley Moms\n\nMy Scotts Valley\n\nAptos Community\n\nRemembering Watsonville\n\nMeetups in Santa Cruz County\n\n(back to top)\n\nThere are a number of meetups in Santa Cruz county as well. By far, the biggest meetup is the Santa Cruz New Tech Meetup, with over 4,400 members (which should tell you a lot about what’s going on in Santa Cruz).\n\nSanta Cruz New Tech Meetup (4,400+ members)\n\nSanta Cruz Sierra Club (1,200+ members)\n\nSanta Cruz Real Estate Investment Group (380+ members)\n\nThe Friendly Vegans (1,900+ members)\n\nWestside Ladies Book Club (400+ members)\n\nSanta Cruz Bitcoin and Crytocurrency Meetup (650+ members)\n\nSanta Cruz Medicine Buddha Meditation (450+ members)\n\nSanta Cruz Hikes with Dogs (800+ members)\n\nSanta Cruz Beach/Doubles Volleyball (400+ members)\n\nUtilities in Santa Cruz County\n\n(back to top)\n\nThroughout the county, electricity service is provided by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E). However, Santa Cruz County has teamed up with Monterey and San Benito Counties to form Monterey Bay Community Power, which is used to supply the area with clean & green power generated from renewable sources, with the electricity sent to homes and businesses through PG&E transmission lines. Every household and business in Santa Cruz has access to clean, renewable energy.\n\nNatural gas is also provided by PG&E, but the service is not universally available. Natural Gas service is available throughout the “suburban” parts of Santa Cruz, including the districts of the San Lorenzo Valley on or near Highway 9. Where natural gas is not available, fuel for heating is often provided by propane. A number of propane companies service the county, but their rates can vary so it pays to shop around.\n\nIncredibly enough, many homes in the county, particularly in the wooded areas like the San Lorenzo Valley, are heated partially and even exclusively by wood stoves. Woodsmoke can hang heavy and low in the air in the San Lorenzo Valley in deep winter, so anyone sensitive to airborne particulates should be aware of this before moving to the area.\n\nWater service is provided by a mixture of public and private companies throughout the county. The city of Santa Cruz maintains a drinking water reservoir in the mountains of Felton (Loch Lomond) which is fed by rain and river water. The City of Santa Cruz and the San Lorenzo Valley Water District are the only water systems which are primarily supplied by surface water. The rest of the county’s water systems get virtually all of their water from ground sources.\n\nSanta Cruz county is the only county in California that is entirely reliant on a domestic water supply; it does not import any water from neighboring counties. Many of the county’s groundwater basins are in overdraft, which means more water is being removed than added each year. This puts them at risk for saltwater intrusion, which will result in the groundwater becoming too saline for human consumption. A number of strategies are being employed to fight this, primarily a reduction in water usage but also water recycling and desalination are either being implemented or at least explored.\n\nResidents of Santa Cruz county already have the lowest per-capita water usage in the state of California, which is driven in no small part by high water rates. Because of this, long showers and green lawns are a rarity in Santa Cruz county! The scarcity of water is also used as a frequently cited argument against further development.\n\nInternet Access in Santa Cruz County\n\n(back to top)\n\nSanta Cruz has high-speed Internet available in most parts of the county. The major ISPs (Internet Service Providers) are Comcast/Xfinity, Charter/Spectrum, AT&T, and Cruzio (our local home-town ISP). Charter is limited to the cities of Capitola and Watsonville, whereas Comcast is available in most of the rest of the county and provides speeds exceeding 200 Mbps. Cruzio also does business as Santa Cruz Fiber, which provides 1 Gbps Internet service to limited, but growing, areas of the county.\n\nRural areas of Santa Cruz county are increasingly able to access StarLink, and a company called Etheric Networks also provides access to some parts of the county.\n\nJobs in Santa Cruz\n\n(back to top)\n\nThe Santa Cruz county job market is dominated by the public sector. The largest employer in the county is the University of California at Santa Cruz, which employs about 8,600 people. Other notable public jobs are with the County of Santa Cruz and the school districts, especially the Pajaro Valley Unified School District (the largest in the county).\n\nMost private sector jobs are in low-wage industries such as agriculture, tourism, services, and retail. However, there is a growing number of large and well-paying employers. Most of the highest-earning residents, however, do work in Silicon Valley or elsewhere in the world via the miracle of telecommunication.\n\nMajor and Notable Companies in Santa Cruz\n\n(back to top)\n\nWhen you live in Santa Cruz, there are plenty of places where you can find a job (and a growing number of employers offering competitive six-figure salaries like Amazon and Google). Santa Cruz enjoys a relatively low unemployment rate, and there is a growing range of top-tier employers who are opening offices in the area. And there are many widely recognized names on the list which you will likely recognize:\n\nGoogle\n\nGoogle has been growing its presence in Santa Cruz in recent years. With Google’s headquarters situated just 40 minutes from downtown Santa Cruz, the search giant has been eyeing expansion into the city in recent years. In June 2019, Google paid $2.6 billion to acquire Santa Cruz-based Looker, and Google has since begun to repurpose many of Looker’s offices for its main business.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon has been growing its presence in Santa Cruz since fall 2017. Today, Amazon has both a warehouse and a corporate technology office in Santa Cruz. The e-commerce giant is expected to continue to expand its presence in the area because of the University of California’s research campus in the city.\n\nDriscoll’s\n\nOne of the largest U.S. berry sellers, Driscoll’s, is headquartered in Watsonville. The company has annual sales of around $2 billion (about 1/3rd of the U.S. berry market) and has over a thousand employees. While they grow or contract to grow a variety of berries in the county, much of their production is now overseas but coordinated and managed from their Watsonville headquarters.\n\nGranite Construction\n\nGranite Construction is a major general contractor in the civil construction industry. The company has annual sales of $3.3 billion and is also headquartered in Watsonville.\n\nWest Marine\n\nWest Marine is a major retail supplier of boating components. The Santa Cruz-based company has over 5,000 employees that are spread across the country. Their headquarters had been in Watsonville but they have since relocated to Florida, although they continue to have a number of employees still in the area.\n\nO’Neill\n\nO’Neill is one of the market leaders in surfing gear. In fact, Jack O’Neill, the legendary founder of the company, is credited with inventing the wetsuit. The company was sold in 2007 and is technically now headquartered in Luxembourg, but its U.S. headquarters are in Santa Cruz.\n\nPlantronics/Poly\n\nPlantronics has long been one of the leading providers of hardware and software for business communications. In fact, the words spoken by U.S. astronaut Neil Armstrong as he stepped on the moon were transmitted through a Plantronics headset. The Santa Cruz-based company is publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange and has a market valuation well over $500 million. In 2018 Plantronics purchased Polycom for $2 billion and has since changed the name of the company to Poly.\n\nMartinelli’s\n\nMartinelli’s has been making apple juice in Watsonville since 1868 – clear back to the founding of the city. Martinelli’s juice is available across the country and around the world.\n\nStartups in Santa Cruz\n\n(back to top)\n\nSanta Cruz county is also home to an increasing number of startup companies, many of which are focused on clean energy and transportation. Some of our notable startups are:\n\nAmbient Photonics\n\nImagine being able to power IoT devices using ambient light within your offices, stores, and perhaps your house. That’s just what Ambient Photonics is aiming to do. The founder – Bates Marshall – is a Santa Cruz native.\n\nCruz Foam\n\nThe death knell for Styrofoam popcorn and packaging can’t come soon enough. Cruz Foam is using chiton – shrimp shells – to replace the Styrofoam and plastics that are invading our oceans.\n\nPrometheus Fuels\n\nCreating gasoline out of thin air? Yes, Prometheus Fuels is able to convert carbon from the air into fuel for your cars. This is a carbon neutral solution.\n\nParallel Flight Technologies\n\nThey call this the Prius of air – a heavy lift drone that uses both gasoline and battery enabling flight times as long as 1.5 hours. Parallel Flight Technologies is funded in part by NASA and the National Science Foundation.\n\nClaret Bio\n\nOne of more than 12 new biotech companies in Santa Cruz, ClaretBio builds tools that empower a deeper understanding of degraded DNA molecules, with an emphasis on cell-free DNA sampling and analysis.\n\nJoby Aviation\n\nJoby Aviation is working on an electric-powered VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft, and in January 2020 received a $590 million investment from Toyota. They are creating the Air Taxi of the future.\n\nZero Motorcycles\n\nZero Motorcycles produces high performance electric motorcycles that are lightweight, efficient, fast off the line and fun to ride.\n\nAreas in Santa Cruz County\n\n(back to top)\n\nSanta Cruz is divided into about a dozen or so major areas that are each culturally, geographically, and climatologically distinct. If you are planning to move to Santa Cruz County, you should have a good understanding of each area so that you can choose the place that is right for you. In the sections that follow, therefore, this relocation guide will give you an overview of each of the principal areas in Santa Cruz County.\n\nFor each area highlighted in this Relocation Guide, a number of schools, restaurants, coffee shops, bars, markets, and the like are identified. This is by no means an exhaustive list of everything you’ll find in Santa Cruz county. Rather, we’ve chosen to highlight the most popular and best-known institutions that in many ways shape and reflect the character of the county.\n\nEach area also lists online resources for the area. You’re encouraged to explore these: homes for sale, curated YouTube video playlist for each area, and a link to a custom Google map showing all the items identified in this report for that part of the county.\n\nSan Lorenzo Valley\n\nThe northern part of Santa Cruz County is known as the San Lorenzo Valley (SLV). The SLV has four communities in it: Boulder Creek, Brookdale, Ben Lomond, and Felton. All of these communities share some commonalities, such as they are mountainous and covered in soaring redwood trees. Like the islands of Hawaii, however, each area is distinct and pulses to its own vibe.\n\nMany of the homes in the San Lorenzo Valley (and in many beach-area neighborhoods as well) began life as seasonal summer cabins but have been upgraded and pressed into year-round use over time.\n\nBoulder Creek\n\n(back to top)\n\nBoulder Creek is very much a mountain town. Most of the action is to be found on Highway 9, which runs through the heart of downtown Boulder Creek. Downtown Boulder Creek is flat, and there are some homes there too, and they are prized because they’re walking distance to amenities. Most of Boulder Creek stretches out for miles, along Big Basin Road, Highway 9, and Bear Creek Road. Virtually every part of Boulder Creek is covered in redwood forest, and many homes are on steeply sloped lots. Homes on flat, sunny land with good road access are valued at a premium.\n\nBoulder Creek is a very popular choice for young families with at least one breadwinner who works in Silicon Valley, as it is only about a 35-minute drive along Bear Creek Road to Los Gatos from many parts of Boulder Creek. The schools in the San Lorenzo Valley are well-regarded by families who send their children to them.\n\nBackground\n\nBoulder Creek is situated at the top of the San Lorenzo Valley. Boulder Creek started as a logging town in the 1870’s before the redwood forests were established as protected areas. Today, there are few jobs in town, so most residents travel south to Santa Cruz via Highway 9 or North/East to Silicon Valley via Highway 9 or Bear Creek Road for work.\n\nSchools in Boulder Creek\n\nBoulder Creek Elementary School (Grades K-5, Rated 6/10)\n\nSan Lorenzo Valley Middle School (Grades 6-8, Rated 5/10)\n\nSan Lorenzo Valley High School (Grades 9-12, Rated 9/10)\n\nOcean Grove Charter School (Grades K-12, Rated 6/10)\n\nRestaurants in Boulder Creek\n\nRed Pearl (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nTae’s Edo Sushi Bar and Grill (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nBella’s Café (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nScopazzi’s (3.8 on Yelp)\n\nBars in Boulder Creek\n\nJoe’s Bar (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nScopazzi’s (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nCoffee Shops in Boulder Creek\n\nJenna Sue’s Café (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nTreehouse Café (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nBreweries, Taprooms & Wineries in Boulder Creek\n\nByington Vineyard & Winery (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nDavid Bruce Winery (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nFood Markets\n\nWild Roots Market (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nJohnny’s Super Market (3.0 on Yelp)\n\nRecreation in Boulder Creek\n\nBig Basin Redwoods State Park\n\nBoulder Creek Recreation and Parks District\n\nBear Creek Recreation and Community Center\n\nJunction Park\n\nBoulder Creek Country Club\n\nEntertainment in Boulder Creek\n\nBrookdale Lodge\n\nAccommodations in Boulder Creek\n\nBrookdale Lodge\n\nOnline Resources for Boulder Creek\n\nHomes for sale in Boulder Creek\n\nBoulder Creek YouTube Playlist\n\nGoogle Maps Companion for Boulder Creek\n\nBen Lomond\n\n(back to top)\n\nThe town of Ben Lomond feels almost just like a wide spot in the road – but it’s actually the sweet spot of the San Lorenzo Valley. It has a tiny downtown with everything you need: a supermarket, coffee shop, bar, and public park along the river – plus a community theater, all right downtown. Henfling’s is a legendary bar/restaurant, with great live music many nights a year. Coffee Nine is a terrific coffee shop. You’ll also find a gas station and an Ace Hardware store.\n\nOn the fringes of the town center you’ll find Costa Nostra restaurant and La Placa Family Bakery, both of which have many raving local fans.\n\nBen Lomond is located in the heart of the San Lorenzo Valley. As with Boulder Creek, Ben Lomond is primarily surrounded by redwood forests. Consequently, it has a relaxed mountain town vibe much like Boulder Creek. However, the land in Ben Lomond tends to be less steep than in Boulder Creek, which makes it more desirable for day-to-day use. Overall, Ben Lomond is a good choice if you are looking to live in a seemingly remote area while still enjoying the benefit of living near Silicon Valley.\n\nBackground\n\nThe name Ben Lomond comes courtesy of one John Burns, a Scot who settled on the west side of the mountain ridge in 1851. Burns named the mountain after one in Scotland. Ben Lomond means “beacon peak” in Brittonic. Burns became one of the first vintners in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and is usually also credited with naming the community of Bonny Doon (the mountain/forest area to the north of UC Santa Cruz reached via Empire Grade Road).\n\nSchools in Ben Lomond\n\nSan Lorenzo Valley Elementary School (Grades K-5, Rated 9/10)\n\nSan Lorenzo Valley Middle School (Grades K-5, Rated 9/10)\n\nSan Lorenzo Valley High School (Grades 9-12, Rated 9/10)\n\nRestaurants in Ben Lomond\n\nTyrolean Inn Restaurant (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nLa Placa Family Bakery (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nSpanky’s (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nCasa Nostra (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nBars in Ben Lomond\n\nHenfling’s (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nCoffee Shops in Ben Lomond\n\nCoffee Nine (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nBreweries, Taprooms & Wineries\n\nNone\n\nFood Markets in Ben Lomond\n\nBen Lomond Market (3.0 on Yelp)\n\nRecreation in Ben Lomond\n\nSan Lorenzo Valley Swim Center\n\nQuail Hollow Ranch\n\nHighlands County Park\n\nBen Lomond Park\n\nEntertainment in Ben Lomond\n\nHenfling’s\n\nMountain Community Theater\n\nAccommodations in Ben Lomond\n\nQuality Inn & Suites, Santa Cruz Mountains (3.0 on Yelp)\n\nOnline Resources for Ben Lomond\n\nHomes for sale in Ben Lomond\n\nBen Lomond YouTube Playlist\n\nGoogle Maps Companion for Ben Lomond\n\nFelton\n\n(back to top)\n\nFelton is a small town but compared to the other towns in the San Lorenzo Valley, it feels big thanks to the long stretch of commercial businesses down Highway 9 and Graham Hill Road. For people who work in Santa Cruz, it’s a more affordable place to live than in the city, but it’s only a 20-minute drive to the beach down Highway 9 or via Graham Hill Road. For people who work in Silicon Valley, much of Felton is within a 30-minute drive of Los Gatos. It’s also a short hop over Mount Hermon Road to Scotts Valley with its broad range of amenities.\n\nFelton is best known for its two major attractions, the Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park, and Roaring Camp, a train-focused amusement park of sorts which also runs a standard gauge train down to the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. Also of note in Felton is the Felton Covered Bridge, constructed in 1892. It is the tallest covered bridge in the United States and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\n\nBackground\n\nFelton bears the name of John B. Felton, a former mayor of Oakland and Bay Area investor. It occupies the southern end of the San Lorenzo Valley, and the town served as the terminus of the logging flume which began in Boulder Creek in 1875. A narrow-gauge rail line opened in 1880 connecting Felton with San Jose, and a standard gauge railroad arrived in 1909, which helped move more lumber and lime out of the Felton area to rebuild San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake.\n\nSchools in Felton\n\nSan Lorenzo Valley Elementary School (Grades K-5, Rated 9/10)\n\nSan Lorenzo Valley Middle School (Grades K-5, Rated 9/10)\n\nSan Lorenzo Valley High School (Grades 9-12, Rated 9/10)\n\nRestaurants in Felton\n\nEmpire Grille (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nTaqueria Vallarta (4.0 On Yelp)\n\nRedwood Pizzeria (4.0 on Yelp\n\nBars in Felton\n\nMonty’s Log Cabin (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nCowboy Bar and Grill (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nCoffee Shops in Felton\n\nCreamer House (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nWhite Raven (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nMountain Roastings (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nBreweries, Taprooms & Wineries in Felton\n\nNone\n\nFood Markets in Felton\n\nWild Roots Market (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nFelton Farmer’s Market (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nRecreation in Felton\n\nFelton Covered Bridge County Park (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nHenry Cowell Redwoods State Park (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nLoch Lomond Recreational Area (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nEntertainment in Felton\n\nFelton Music Hall (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nRoaring Camp (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nAccommodations in Felton\n\nFern River Resort (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nOnline Resources for Felton\n\nHomes for Sale in Felton\n\nFelton YouTube Playlist\n\nGoogle Maps Companion for Felton\n\nScotts Valley\n\n(back to top)\n\nScotts Valley is the third largest city in Santa Cruz county, just edging out Capitola and is spread over 4.62 square miles. The city is renowned for its top-notch schools – which is one thing that makes it a prime choice for academically-minded parents.\n\nScotts Valley is directly east of Felton. Scotts Valley is an incorporated city with a distinctly suburban vibe; however, it is also surrounded by forest giving it a rural feel. Scotts Valley has larger residential areas and more shopping centers than most other parts of the county. California Highway 17 passes directly through Scotts Valley, so residents there can drive to Silicon Valley over Highway 17 in about 20 minutes or reach the beaches of Santa Cruz in a similar period of time. Scotts Valley is also home to some of the best public schools for miles around.\n\nBackground\n\nScotts Valley was named after Hiram Daniel Scott, who purchased Rancho San Agustin, including the valley, in 1850 from Joseph Ladd Majors. Hiram Scott built the Greek revival style Scott House in 1853. This home is today situated behind City Hall and is on the National Register of Historic Places. The city has a population of\n\nScotts Valley’s growth picked up in the 1930s, exporting peat moss for use elsewhere in the state as planting soil. Sand and gravel were also quarried and exported, but for most of the 20th century Scotts Valley remained rural with a focus on tourism, camping, and recreation. Santa’s Village, a Christmas-themed amusement park, was established in 1957, and it served millions of visitors before closing in 1979.\n\nBorland software company ended up building a large office building on much of the Santa’s Village site in the 1990s, which later became the Enterprise Tech Center. UC Santa Cruz now leases 130,000 square feet of the building for offices. Seagate Technology was founded in Scotts Valley in 1978, and their hard disc drives were originally manufactured there. Seagate moved out of Scotts Valley entirely in 2016.\n\nSchools in Scotts Valley\n\nBrook Knoll Elementary School (Grades PK-5, Rated 8/10)\n\nScotts Valley Middle School (Grades 6-8, Rated 8/10)\n\nScotts Valley High School (Grades 9-12, Rated 8/10)\n\n1440 Multiversity (Formerly Bethany College, now a Specialty School)\n\nRestaurants in Scotts Valley\n\nMalone’s Grille (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nOtoro Sushi (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nAmbrosia India Bistro (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nLos Gallos Taqueria (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nBars in Scotts Valley\n\nBruno’s Bar and Grill (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nHabanero’s Bar and Grill (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nCoffee Shops in Scotts Valley\n\nCruise Coffee Company (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nCoffee Cat (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nScotts Valley Coffee (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nBreweries, Taprooms & Wineries in Scotts Valley\n\nSteel Bonnet Brewing Company (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nFood Markets in Scotts Valley\n\nScotts Valley Market (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nScotts Valley Farmers Market (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nNob Hill Foods (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nRecreation in Scotts Valley\n\nSkypark (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nSiltanen Park (3.0 on Yelp)\n\nSiltanen Family Swim Center (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nHocus Pocus Park (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nPasatiempo Golf Course (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nLa Madrona Athletic Club (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nEntertainment in Scotts Valley\n\nCineLux Scotts Valley Café and Lounge (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nAccommodations in Scotts Valley\n\nFour Points by Sheraton (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nHilton Santa Cruz / Scotts Valley (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nOnline Resources for Scotts Valley\n\nHomes for Sale in Scotts Valley\n\nScotts Valley YouTube Playlist\n\nGoogle Maps Companion for Scotts Valley\n\nDavenport\n\n(back to top)\n\nDavenport is a small, windswept town along the northern coast of Santa Cruz county. While most of Santa Cruz County wraps around the Monterey Bay, Davenport faces directly onto the Pacific Ocean. Nowadays, Davenport is mostly a bedroom community for Santa Cruz ,and also survives on traffic on Highway 1, which passes through downtown Davenport. There are a couple of restaurants in town, and a small Catholic church and the old jail (now a museum open to the public, now and again) which hearken back to a bygone era.\n\nDavenport is the site of California’s famous Shark Tooth Rock that has been featured in many Hollywood movies. The area also features well-maintained beaches that are open to the general public.\n\nBackground\n\nThe village hugs the coastline on the far western side of Santa Cruz County. Davenport’s modern history goes way back to 1868 when Captain John Davenport, a sea-based whaler by trade, built a 450-foot wharf off what became to be known as Davenport’s Landing. However, the project proved unprofitable and was abandoned in 1880. By 1905, Davenport sprang back to life and housing was built to provide housing for workers at the new Davenport cement plant, which operated for a century until finally shutting down in 2010.\n\nSchools in Davenport\n\nPacific Elementary School (Grades K-6, Rated 7/10)\n\nMission Hill Middle School (Grades 6-8, Rated 6/10)\n\nSanta Cruz High School (Grades 9-12, Rated 9/10)\n\nRestaurants / Bars / Cafes in Davenport\n\nWhale City Bakery Bar and Grill (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nDavenport Roadhouse (3.0 on Yelp)\n\nSwanton Berry Farm (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nFood Market in Davenport\n\nArro’s Country Store (5.0 on Yelp)\n\nBreweries, Taprooms & Wineries in Davenport\n\nBonny Doon Vineyard: this isn’t technically in Davenport, but it’s not a very long drive from the coast up into the mountains where this acclaimed vineyard has been running for decades.\n\nRecreation in Davenport\n\nDavenport Beach (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nWilder Ranch State Park (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nCoast Dairies State Park (5.0 on AllTrails.com)\n\nDavenport Road House (3.0 on Yelp)\n\nEntertainment in Davenport\n\nDavenport Roadhouse\n\nAccommodations in Davenport\n\nDavenport Roadhouse Inn (3.5 on TripAdvisor)\n\nCostanoa KOA (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nOnline Resources for Davenport\n\nHomes for sale in Davenport\n\nDavenport YouTube Playlist\n\nGoogle Maps Companion for Davenport\n\nCity of Santa Cruz\n\n(back to top)\n\nThe city is perhaps best known for the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, a seaside amusement park located along the Monterey Bay shoreline. The Boardwalk is home to the iconic Giant Dipper Roller Coaster, first opened in 1924 and having served over 66 million riders. The Boardwalk has been featured in a number of Hollywood films, including the Lost Boys, Sudden Impact, Dangerous Minds, and most recently, Us.\n\nAside from the Boardwalk, Santa Cruz is also famous for the University of California at Santa Cruz which was founded in 1965. U.S. News ranks UCSC as the 84th best University in the United States, but it is ranked #2 in the USA for Social Mobility. The school is particularly strong in Marine Biology as well as astronomy, space sciences, and computer game design. Perhaps fittingly, the legendary American band The Grateful Dead has its archive located at the University’s McHenry Library.\n\nAside from the Beach Boardwalk and the University, Santa Cruz is also well-known as a surf town. The sport of surfing is deeply ingrained into the culture, with thousands of residents avidly pursuing the sport. The surf is always breaking somewhere in Santa Cruz, making it a highly sought-after area for surf aficionados.\n\nBackground\n\nThe City of Santa Cruz is the most populous area in Santa Cruz County, and was founded in 1791 as a Spanish Mission (Santa Cruz means “Holy Cross” in Spanish). The city was incorporated in 1866 and is spread out across nearly 16 square miles. Early industries included lumber, lime, gunpowder, and agriculture. Santa Cruz was home to the Santa Cruz Powder Works, which supplied gunpowder during the civil war, and was one of the largest employers in the county for many years before the facility exploded in 1898.\n\nSchools in Santa Cruz\n\nWestlake Elementary School (Grades K-5, Rated 8/10)\n\nMission Hill Middle School (Grades 6-8, Rated 6/10)\n\nSanta Cruz High School (Grades 9-12, Rated 9/10)\n\nHarbor High School (Grades 9-12, Rated 7/10)\n\nTop Restaurants in Santa Cruz\n\nLillian’s Italian Kitchen (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nLaili Restaurant (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nHula’s Island Grill (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nWest End Tap and Kitchen (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nMozaic (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nThe Crow’s Nest (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nLinda’s Seabreeze Café (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nMobo Sushi (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nThe Crepe Place (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nBars in Santa Cruz\n\nThe Redroom (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nPoet and Patriot Irish Pub (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nThe Blue Lounge (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nBlue Lagoon Cocktail Lounge (3.0 on Yelp)\n\nCoffee Shops in Santa Cruz\n\nVerve Coffee Roasters (4.0 on Yelp)\n\n11th Hour Coffee (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nCat and Cloud Coffee (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nSanta Cruz Coffee Roasting (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nThe Abbey (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nBreweries, Taprooms & Wineries in Santa Cruz\n\nShanty Shack Brewing (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nSoif (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nMJA Vineyards (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nLupulo Craft Beer House (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nSanta Cruz Pour Taproom (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nSanta Cruz Mountain Brewing (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nSante Adairius Rustic Ales (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nFood Markets in Santa Cruz\n\nSanta Cruz Farmer’s Market (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nShopper’s Corner (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nWhole Foods (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nTrader Joe’s (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nRecreation in Santa Cruz\n\nNatural Bridges State Beach (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nDeLaveaga Park\n\nMain/Cowell Beach (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nPogonip (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nHarvey West Pool (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nWest Cliff Drive Path (5.0 on Yelp)\n\nWestlake Park (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nEntertainment in Santa Cruz\n\nThe Catalyst (3.0 on Yelp)\n\nThe Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nBoardwalk Bowl (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nChardonnay Sailing Charters (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nKuumbwa Jaza Center (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nRio Theater (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nDel Mar Theater (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nSanta Cruz Museum of Art and History (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nSurf City Billiards Bar & Cafe (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nSanta Cruz Roller Palladium (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nNeptune’s Kingdom (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nDNA’s Comedy Lab (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nAccommodations in Santa Cruz\n\nThe Dream Inn (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nHyatt Place Santa Cruz (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nWest Cliff Inn (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nHotel Paradox (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nOnline Resources for Santa Cruz\n\nHomes for sale in the city of Santa Cruz\n\nCity of Santa Cruz YouTube Playlist\n\nGoogle Maps Companion for Santa Cruz\n\nLive Oak\n\n(back to top)\n\nLive Oak is an unincorporated area of Santa Cruz county encompassing about 3.42 square files. It is situated between the city of Santa Cruz, the city of Capitola, and Soquel. The town can be seen as an extension of the City of Santa Cruz, and it shares a zip code and mailing address with the east side of the city. In years gone by, Live Oak has been considered the poor stepchild of the city of Santa Cruz, however over the past decade or so the area has become much more popular, and more expensive, with new commercial and residential developments.\n\nIn fact, Live Oak boasts some of the highest home prices in the entire county, due primarily to the neighborhood known as Pleasure Point, which hugs the Monterey Bay along East Cliff Drive. Many of these homes are in close proximity to the beach and a number of them offer stunning views. Opal Cliffs is adjacent to Pleasure Point, with a number of luxurious multimillion-dollar homes, many of which are owned by the elite of Silicon Valley.\n\nBy no means is the area exclusively for the rich and famous. Live Oak contains a wide variety of housing types, including condominiums, duplexes, mobile home parks, and apartment buildings. There’s something for just about everyone in Live Oak.\n\nBackground\n\nLive Oak got its name from the evergreen live oak trees that dot the area. Europeans began to settle Live Oak in the early 1870’s, farming the land for wheat. They established a grange hall and “Live Oak School” in 1872 at what is today the corner of 17th Avenue and Capitola Road. Intensive farming depleted the soil, and people turned to poultry farming. Much of today’s residential lands were originally parceled out as “chicken farms” – long and narrow lots. Over time, these “larger” lots have been divided and sold off, as the population density of the area gradually increased.\n\nSchools in Live Oak\n\nDel Mar Elementary (Grades K-5, Rated 5/10)\n\nGreen Acres Elementary (Grades K-5, Rated 6/10)\n\nLive Oak Elementary (Grades K-5, Rated 7/10)\n\nShoreline Middle School (Grades 6-8, Rated 5/10)\n\nTierra Pacifica Charter School (Grades K-8, Rated 8/10)\n\nCypress Charter High School (Grades 9-12, Rated 7/10)\n\nRestaurants in Live Oak\n\nPono Hawaiian Kitchen (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nHarbor Café (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nZameen at the Point (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nSuda (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nStar Bene (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nHoly Smokes Country BBQ (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nBars in Live Oak\n\nOver the Hill Gang Saloon (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nThe Castaways (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nCoffee Shops in Live Oak\n\nCoffeetopia (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nCat & Cloud Coffee (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nVerve Coffee Roasters (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nBreweries, Taprooms & Wineries in Live Oak\n\nNew Bohemia Brewing Company (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nEast Cliff Brewing Co.

What’s not as well known is that it’s also a great place to live. The city is well-run and civic leaders are accessible. Even for those who don’t ever step on the sand, the Esplanade along the beach has numerous benches to sit and enjoy the sea air and mesmerizing bay view.\n\nSoquel Creek drains into the sea at Capitola, but the flow is restricted in summer to keep water in the creek along Riverview Drive, which allows for kayaking and other forms of recreation. The now-defunct Begonia Festival would parade up and down the creek. Above the creek is the iconic railroad trestle, which presently does not support any rail operations and is semi-abandoned.\n\nCapitola also is home to one of the county’s major commercial districts along 41st Avenue with a variety of shopping centers, office buildings, big box retailers, and much more. The county’s only enclosed shopping mall, the Capitola Mall, is located along 41st Avenue.\n\nBackground\n\nCapitola is a quintessential California beach town, with roots going back to 1869 when it was developed as a beach resort. Today, Capitola is still a very popular vacation destination with many homes owned as vacation or second homes. Short term vacation rentals, though, are restricted to the Capitola Village, the historical core of the city.\n\nSchools in Capitola\n\nMain Street Elementary School (Grades K-5, Rated 7/10)\n\nNew Brighton Middle School (Grades 6-8, Rated 6/10)\n\nSoquel High School (Grades 9-12, Rated 8/10)\n\nRestaurants in Capitola\n\nShadowbrook (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nCaruso’s Tuscan Cuisine (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nMargaritaville (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nSotola Bar and Grill (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nGayle’s Bakery and Rosticceria (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nRoux Dat (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nBars in Capitola\n\nThe Sand Bar (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nBrtiannia Arms (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nMargaritaville (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nAvenue Cafe (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nCoffee Shops in Capitola\n\nZizzo’s Coffeehouse & Winebar (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nMr. Toot’s Coffeehouse (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nBreweries, Taprooms & Wineries in Capitola\n\nCapitola Wine Bar\n\nSante Adairius (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nArmida Winery (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nFood Markets in Capitola\n\nWhole Foods Market (3.0 on Yelp)\n\nTrader Joe’s (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nRecreation in Capitola\n\nCapitola City Beach (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nJade Street Park (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nNew Brighton State Beach (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nEntertainment in Capitola\n\nSanta Cruz Children’s Museum of Discovery (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nCineLux Capitola Café & Lounge (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nAccommodations in Capitola\n\nFairfield Inn and Suites (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nBest Western Plus Capitola by the Sea Inn & Suites (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nMonarch Cove Inn (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nCapitola Venetian Hotel (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nInn at Depot Hill (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nOnline Resources for Capitola\n\nHomes for sale in Capitola\n\nCapitola YouTube Playlist\n\nGoogle Maps Companion for Capitola\n\nSoquel\n\n(back to top)\n\nSoquel is a small area that is tucked in between Live Oak, Capitola, and Aptos. Soquel is a very quiet town, with a quaint village along Soquel Drive and Soquel Creek. Soquel enjoys a prime mid-county location with a warm micro-climate. It’s close to multiple parks, beaches, schools, and shopping areas. It’s also got a convenient freeway onramp to take you to all points north and south, but you can also get to Silicon Valley on the mostly un-congested Old San Jose Road, which goes from Soquel Village to Summit Road, and runs for several miles along the border of Santa Cruz and Santa Clara counties.\n\nSoquel is best recognized by Soquel Village with its iconic white church with a tall steeple. There are a number of restaurants, bars, shops, and a few offices in Soquel Village.\n\nBackground\n\nRancho Soquel was granted to Martina Castro in 1833, around the same time Rancho Aptos was given to her father, Jose Castro. Soquel and nearby Capitola grew up around the same time. Today, they are more distinct communities as Highway 1 divides them. Soquel Village has been prone to flooding, the last time was in 1982 when storm debris blocked the flow of the creek.\n\nFun fact: Soquel was reportedly the site of the first “Acid Test” party in 1965.\n\nSchools in Soquel\n\nMain Street Elementary School (Grades K-5, Rated 7/10)\n\nNew Brighton Middle School (Grades 6-8, Rated 6/10)\n\nSoquel High School (Grades 9-12, Rated 8/10)\n\nMountain Elementary School (Grades K-6, Rated 7/10)\n\nRestaurants in Soquel\n\nSawasdee Thai Cuisine (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nMichael’s on Main (3.0 on Yelp)\n\nCafe Cruz (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nHome (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nGolden Fu Wah (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nThe Bagelry (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nBars in Soquel\n\nSir Froggy’s Pub (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nJJ’s Saloon (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nCoffee Shops in Soquel\n\nThe Ugly Mug (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nBreweries, Taprooms, and Wineries in Soquel\n\nDiscretion Brewing (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nBargetto Winery (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nVinocruz (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nSoquel Vineyards (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nBeer 30 (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nFood Markets in Soquel\n\nSafeway (2.5 on Yelp)\n\nRecreation in Soquel\n\nAnna Jean Cummings Park (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nWillowbrook Park (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nEntertainment in Soquel\n\nMichael’s on Main (3.0 on Yelp)\n\nAccommodations in Soquel\n\nNone\n\nOnline Resources for Soquel\n\nHomes for Sale in Soquel\n\nSoquel YouTube Playlist\n\nGoogle Maps Companion for Soquel\n\nAptos\n\n(back to top)\n\nAptos is an unincorporated area of Santa Cruz county, and is perhaps best recognized for the sunken concrete ship, the S.S. Palo Alto, which is today a twisted hulk lying offshore of Seacliff State Beach. Aptos is fairly large area and consists of several distinct neighborhoods and regions: Seacliff, Mar Vista, Rio del Mar, Seascape, the mountain forests, and the inland Day Valley and Pleasant Valley.\n\nAptos is simply a wonderful place to call home. It’s peaceful, quiet, and clean, with miles of sandy beaches and untold thousands of acres of redwood forests to explore. In the past few years, it’s really come a long way, especially since the redevelopment of Aptos Village which is attracting a number of new businesses to the area, notably Mentone restaurant by Michelin-star chef David Kinch, and Penny Ice Creamery among others.\n\nBackground\n\nThe historical core of Aptos is Aptos Village, which for decades was mostly an abandoned lot. Recently, however, Aptos Village has been rebuilt and now features a number of condominiums and townhouses in a new commercial development.\n\nThe modern era of Aptos began with the Aptos Rancho in 1833, awarded to Raphael Castro by the governor of Mexico. Within a few decades, new immigrants from Europe and the United States moved into the area and the Aptos Rancho was sold off bit by bit. The area was heavily logged for its old-growth redwoods, which were used for building and re-building San Francisco before and after the 1906 earthquake.\n\nIn the 1920s, developers attempted to create a resort community, bringing in and sinking the S.S. Palo Alto to create a seaside vacation center, along with a grand hotel, the world’s largest freshwater swimming pool, beaches, and residential parcels for sale.\n\nUnfortunately for the developers, the Great Depression came along and wiped away those plans. Over time, the cement ship cracked, and the hotel burned to the ground. Aptos remained largely undeveloped until after World War II, when it was “rediscovered.”.\n\nSchools in Aptos\n\nValencia Elementary School (Grades K-6, Rated 7/10)\n\nMar Vista Elementary (Grades K-6, Rated 5/10)\n\nRio del Mar Elementary (Grades K-6, Rated 8/10)\n\nSanta Cruz Montessori (Grades PK-9, Unrated Private School)\n\nAptos Junior High School (Grades 7-8, Rated 6/10)\n\nAptos High School (Grades 9-12, Rated 8/10)\n\nRestaurants in Aptos\n\nManuel’s Mexican Restaurant (Rated 4.0)\n\nBittersweet Bistro (3.0 on Yelp)\n\nMentone (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nAptos St. BBQ (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nBurger (3.0 on Yelp)\n\nSushi Garden (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nAmbrosia India Bistro (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nCafé Sparrow (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nPersephone (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nSanderling’s (3.0 on Yelp)\n\nBars in Aptos\n\nSeverino’s (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nParish Publick House (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nCoffee Shops in Aptos\n\nNorma Jean’s Coffee (3.5 on Yelp)\n\nPacific Coffee Roasting Co.

The area is beloved by locals for it warm, sunny climate and natural beauty. The Corralitos Market is legendary for its sausage, which they serve hot from the deli seven days a week.\n\nBackground\n\nCorralitos is in the southern part of Santa Cruz County. It is a rural, unincorporated area with a warm micro-climate and bountiful sunshine. There is a small village at is heart, but mostly it consists of farms, ranches, single family homes, and redwoods.\n\nSchools in Corralitos\n\nBradley Elementary School (Grades K-6, Rated 4/10)\n\nAptos Junior High School (Grades 7, Rated 6/10)\n\nAptos High School (Grades 9-12, Rated 8/10)\n\nRestaurants in Corralitos\n\nBig J’s Pizza (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nCadillac Café (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nBars in Corralitos\n\nFive Mile Buzz House (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nCoffee Shops in Corralitos\n\nLito’s Community Cafe (4.0 on Yelp)\n\nBreweries and Wineries in Corralitos\n\nCorralitos Brewing Company (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nAlfarro Family Vineyard and Winery (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nFood Markets in Corralitos\n\nCorralitos Market (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nFour Corners Market (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nRecreation in Corralitos\n\nAldridge Lane Park (no Yelp reviews)\n\nOnline Resources for Corralitos\n\nHomes for Sale in Corralitos\n\nCorralitos YouTube Playlist\n\nGoogle Maps Companion for Corralitos\n\nLa Selva Beach\n\n(back to top)\n\nLa Selva Beach is a hidden enclave located along the coast in the southern part of Santa Cruz County. Relatively few people live in La Selva Beach, and the area is known for its peace, quiet, pristine gated beach, and a tightly-knit community. There’s a little library downtown next to the fire station. El Patio Market is the only place in town for food and beverages.\n\nBackground\n\nIn 1925 the property was purchased by real estate developer David Batchelor who named it “Rob Roy.” It as a retreat with horse riding, cottages, bath houses, and a private beach. The name was changed to La Selva Beach in 1935. La Selva means “The Forest” in Spanish. In the 1970’s the town convinced state government to remove “Beach” from the direction signs.\n\nLegend has it that decades ago, the residents of La Selva Beach were offered to have sewer service installed, but they voted not to. Word is they felt a sewer system would allow for greater population density, so the whole area remains on septic systems to this day.\n\nSchools in La Selva Beach\n\nRio Del Mar Elementary School (Grades K-6, Rated 8/10)\n\nAptos Junior High School (Grades 7-8, Rated 6/10)\n\nAptos High School (Grades 9-12, Rated 8/10)\n\nMonterey Bay Academy (Grades 9-12, Unrated private school)\n\nRestaurants in La Selva Beach\n\nNone\n\nBars in La Selva Beach\n\nNone\n\nCoffee Shops in La Selva Beach\n\nYou can grab some coffee at El Patio Grocery (see below).\n\nBreweries and Wineries in La Selva Beach\n\nNone\n\nFood Markets in La Selva Beach\n\nEl Patio Grocery (3.0 on Yelp)\n\nRecreation in La Selva Beach\n\nLa Selva Beach (4.5 on Yelp)\n\nManresa State Beach (Rated 4.5 on Yelp)\n\nTriangle Park (not rated on Yelp)\n\nEntertainment in La Selva Beach\n\nNone\n\nAccommodations in La Selva Beach\n\nSanta Cruz KOA\n\nOnline Resources for La Selva Beach\n\nHomes for Sale in La Selva Beach\n\nLa Selva Beach YouTube Playlist\n\nGoogle Maps Companion for La Selva Beach\n\nWatsonville\n\n(back to top)\n\nWatsonville is one of the largest cities in Santa Cruz County – second largest, after the city of Santa Cruz. The city is situated just inland off the coast, and it is known for its businesses in the agriculture (especially strawberries and apples) and food processing industries. Although thought of by many as essentially a farm town, many of the county’s largest and best-known companies are headquartered here.\n\nWatsonville today is one of the most forward-looking communities in Santa Cruz county. It continues to build more housing than any other area and has an appetite for development which is lacking in most of the county.\n\nWatsonville has its own small airport, which mostly serves small propeller aircraft and helicopters. The only jet traffic there is usually from the jets owned by Granite Construction which is based in the city. Background\n\nThe first European exploration of California by land was led by Spaniard Gaspar de Portola in 1769. Their mission was to discover desirable sites for the extension of the Baja California chain of Missions into what is today the state of California. When the Europeans entered the Pajaro Valley, they crossed the river and saw a large straw-stuffed bird. They decided to name the river Rio del Pajaro, and legend has it that is how the Pajaro Valley got its name.\n\nWatsonville is located in the heart of the Pajaro Valley, and borders Monterey County at the Pajaro River. The city is renowned for a temperate climate and slower pace of life. The city was incorporated in 1868, and growth in the Pajaro Valley began to flourish when the Southern Pacific Railroad linked the area to the Santa Clara Valley in 1871.\n\nToday, the city features a charming downtown with a classic town square including a bandstand. There are a number of grand, historic Victorian-era houses in and around downtown Watsonville, monuments to some of those original European farming families. Like many other towns in Santa Cruz county, growth exploded after World War II, with most homes having been built in the 1950s through the 1970s.\n\nSchools in Watsonville\n\nMonte Vista Christian (Grades 6-12, Unrated private school)\n\nWatsonville High School (Grades 9-12, Rated 4/10)\n\nPajaro Valley High School (Grades 9-12, Rated 3/10)\n\nAlianza Charter School (Grades K-8, Rated 4/10)\n\nPacific Coast Charter School (Grades K-12, Rated 5/10)\n\nE.A.
