        "text": "Golf Club Drive Trestle\n\nThe most southern trestle on the Southern Pacific Mountain Route and also the shortest, the Golf Club Drive Trestle is located south of Golf Links and crosses over the similarly-named road that once connected Highway 9 with the old Casa del Rey Golf Club clubhouse. It is a simple redwood trestle bridging a gully that was created when the original Santa Cruz & Felton Railroad's fill was bored to create the road to the clubhouse. It was probably built around 1912 as a broad gauge trestle when Fred Swanton built his venture on the property now known as Pogonip County Park.\n\nThe trestle on a rainy day, facing under the trestle westward.\n\nThe trestle is in constant seasonal use with Roaring Camp Railroads' Santa Cruz Big Tress & Pacific Railroad diesel engines hauling excursion trains across the trestle as many as eight times a day in the summer. Because of that, and despite its age, the trestle is kept in good repair. Roaring Camp has owned the right-of-way, including the trestle, since 1985 when they purchased it from the Southern Pacific Railroad.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nTanglewood Flag-Stop\n\nLocation of Tanglewood with possible sites of flag-stop\n\n(Map courtesy Duncan Nanney; annotations mine)\n\nAt the base of San Lorenzo Avenue south of Felton, a small community developed in a clearing beside the original Santa Cruz & Felton Railroad route under the name Tanglewood. Weltha A. Bell, the wife of Thomas L. Bell, designed the subdivision using the name of Nathaniel Hawthorne's famous book, Tanglewood Tales for Boys and Girls, published in 1853. The land was purchased from Frederick Augustus Hihn, who owned the majority of property south of Felton since 1889. A map of the area was filed with the county recorder entitled \"Map of Tangle Wood, Near Felton, Cal\" on May 13th, 1907. The area was later expanded according to a map published on June 7th, 1909 called \"Bells Addition to Tanglewood\", though where it expanded to is unknown. It is likely that development simply continued up San Lorenzo Avenue as the naming scheme (roads named after US presidents) was retained.\n\nVirtually nothing is known of the train stop except that it was certainly a flag-stop, catering to the small local population located in the subdivision. The stop was operated solely by the Southern Pacific Railroad from 1907 until the line closed in 1926. No extant photographs are known to exist of the stop, though the location was undoubtedly in the clearing at the base of San Lorenzo Avenue or just to the north of that site where three houses now reside on the original right-of-way. If that latter site is to be supposed, it would have been immediately adjacent to the Highway 9 entrance to Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park (then called Big Trees County Park) at the base of Oak Avenue alongside Shingle Mill Creek.\n\nGoogle Street View of the intersection of Highway 9 (West San Lorenzo Road) and San Lorenzo Avenue.\n\nThe stone pillar that marked the Tanglewood subdivision can be seen at center-left under a tree.\n\nThe name or the community remains, though it is rarely used and no signage exists. A single cement and stone pillar sits on the north side of the bottom of San Lorenzo Avenue, a probable relic of the Tanglewood subdivision.\n\nCitations:\n\nDonald Thomas Clark, Santa Cruz Place Names: A Geographical Dictionary.

Located at the top of Los Gatos Creek, 889 feet above sea level, construction was troubled by the fact that the tunnel ran directly over two fault lines, the more dangerous of which was San Andreas Fault. The tunnel, which was originally known as Tunnel #3 then renamed Tunnel #2 before it ever opened, was over a mile long (6,200 ft.) and ended up above Burns Creek, a tributary of Soquel Creek, north of Highland, a village that would soon develop into Laurel. Because of the fault line, natural gas regularly leaked into the tunnel. During construction, a massive explosion crippled the tunnel and killed over thirty Chinese workers. The largest of the leaks was found and sealed but small leaks continued to seep into the tunnel during its entire time of operation. It is said that a small flame was left burning at all times to keep the gas levels down. Construction of the tunnel was completed in May 1880.\n\nConstruction of northern end of Summit Tunnel, c. 1879.\n\nThe broad-gauging of the Mountain Route was first foreseen by the Southern Pacific Railroad soon after it took over operation of the line in 1889. Summit Tunnel was targeted as the first tunnel to be widened to support the larger trains and construction on the tunnel and its northern portal was completed in 1893. With the new construction, a large and somewhat elegant water diversion was built to the right of the north portal, parts of which still survive today.\n\nReconstruction of the north portal, 1892-1893.\n\nNearly completed northern portal, 1893.\n\nLittle changed after the widening and expansion. The tracks north of Los Gatos were still not broad-gauged and the new tunnel remained an anomaly, with the other tunnels retaining their wooden original portals. Although there are no photos of the portal, it seems likely that even the south portal of Summit Tunnel was not upgraded. In 1903, the Cats Canyon tunnel was daylighted and Summit Tunnel was formally renamed Tunnel #1.\n\n1893 Summit Tunnel north portal with a track inspector on his tricycle. Tracks still appear to be narrow-gauged.\n\nIn April 1906, the San Francisco Earthquake utterly devastated the tunnel, cutting off service over the mountain. The 1893 portal was repaired but the narrow-gauge tracks were pulled up and replaced with new broad-gauge tracks.\n\nRepairmen inside the Summit Tunnel, probably after the 1906 Earthquake.\n\nThe south portal was completely replaced in 1908 and a brick roof was installed that went 300 ft. deep into the tunnel from the south to help protect the tunnel in case of a natural gas explosion. That portion of the tunnel still exists today, as does the portal itself.\n\nThe south portal of Summit Tunnel after 1908.\n\nFor the next thirty-two years, the town of Wrights declined slowly but surely. The tunnel remained in almost daily use, however, with Suntan Specials cruising every Sunday during the summer and freight and commuter trains using the tunnel at least twice of day even during the rest of the year. But a destructive winter in 1939-1940 sealed the fate of the tunnel.\n\nSummit Tunnel north portal in the autumn of 1937. (Courtesy Bruce McGregor)\n\nSummit Tunnel north portal in April 1940 after abandonment papers had been filed. (Courtesy Bruce McGregor)\n\nThe entire Mountain Route was abandoned due to repair and maintenance costs. In April 1942, the tunnel was dynamited at the entrances by H.A. Christie's railroad salvage company. On the north side, the dynamite was placed roughly 100 feet inside the tunnel since the forward portion was hard concrete. On the southern end, the dynamite was 300 feet inside due to a brick ceiling. Both ends can be navigated today on foot.\n\nThe eerie view inside Summit Tunnel's south portal looking south toward Laurel. Taken by\n\nBruce McGregor in 1967, this tunnel has changed little since it was abandoned in 1940.\n\nTracks have been removed and the roof has been destroyed about 150 feet behind the\n\nphotographer, but otherwise this portion of the tunnel remains completely in tact.\n\nThe heavily graffitied inside of the Summit Tunnel's north portal today. The rubble pile is directly behind me.\n\nAccess to the northern portal of Summit Tunnel is relatively easy. It can be found at the bottom of Wright Station Road just before the bridge. Look for the mailboxes, jump the fence, then turn left. The tunnel's just a bit into the overgrowth.\n\nThe north portal of Summit Tunnel today (Photo courtesy Brian Liddicot)\n\nThe southern portal has been almost completely overtaken by the surrounding foliage due to a natural spring that has degraded the cement over the past seventy years. While large portions of the portal survive, sediment has raised the floor level and collapsed the entrance. Large portions of cement lay scattered around, while the once majestic cement waterfall sits broken and unused to the right.\n\nHere is a perspective shot of the collapsed north portal of Summit Tunnel. It is still quite high, but the floor has definitely move upward toward the ceiling over the past seventy years.\n\nThe now-unused spillway beside the tunnel entrance, covered in moss and lichen and in pieces.\n\nAccess to the Summit Tunnel's southern portal is a much more difficult feat. It is located down a long and steep path off of Troy Road near Summit Road. While it can also be accessed via a long private driveway in Laurel Canyon (the driveway was once the right-of-way), this method is much more difficult. The Troy Road approach pops you right on top of the southern portal, and then you can climb your way around to the entrance via a wrap-around trail.\n\nStanding on top of the portal, looking down.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the southern portal and 300 feet of the tunnel itself still survives in nearly pristine condition, giving an eerie feeling of what it was like traveling a mile underground without natural (or artificial originally) light.\n\nSummit Tunnel's south portal today. Overgrown but otherwise intact.\n\nSummit Tunnel's south portal from the inside showing the brick ceiling and\n\nthe distant glow of the entrance to the portal.\n\nRumors and legend has it that the tunnel was only blasted at the entrance and that the interior is still mostly intact, though heavy levels of methane have leaked from the original cracks of 130 years ago. The tunnel may have been briefly opened and even explored following the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, though actual proof of such an exploration is difficult to find and Rick Hamman reports that while the plan was created, it was never implemented. Regardless, it is extremely like that this tunnel could be serviceable again given the correct circumstances. The right-of-way to and from the tunnel is largely reparable, further giving hope to this unlikely cause.\n\n↧\n\nGlenwood Tunnel\n\nMap of the route of Glenwood Tunnel. (Courtesy Duncan Nanney)\n\nNeglected and largely forgotten due to the overwhelming shadow cast by the Summit Tunnel and its history, the nearly equally-long Glenwood Tunnel, also known extensively as Laurel Tunnel, bridged a mile-long gap between Burns Creek in Laurel Canyon and Glenwood along Bean Creek. During this passage, the tunnel would rise from 885 feet above sea level at Glenwood to 910 feet at Laurel, which marked the highest point on the entire Mountain Route. Unlike its troubled cousin, the Glenwood Tunnel would never experience major problems and remained a trustworthy and stable tunnel from 1880 until its demolition in April 1942.\n\nGlenwood Tunnel's north portal visible in the background outside the town of Laurel before 1906.\n\nThe South Pacific Coast Railroad began construction of the original wood-timbered narrow-gauged tunnel around 1878 along with the other tunnels of the route. Since Glenwood Tunnel did not pass beneath any major fault line and did not include natural gas deposits, it did not experience the problems that delayed Summit Tunnel's opening until 1880. Additionally, a community already existed on one side of the tunnel at Glenwood so construction crews didn't have to create a new camp like they did at Laurel, Highland, and Wrights. Still, on the northern end of the tunnel, Laurel developed slowly from its roots as a labor camp for the northern portal of Glenwood Tunnel.\n\nWhen completed, Glenwood Tunnel was officially branded SPC Tunnel #3 and was a bore 5,792 feet long, running directly under Highway 17 today. The 1899 Station Book notes it spanning the gap between the 62 and 64 mile posts from San Francisco via Alameda Point. Early photographs of its north portal show that the tunnel had a wood-frame portal, at least on the northern side, until it was upgraded after the 1906 Earthquake. It is highly possible that the southern side, however, had a cement or stone portal early on, as Glenwood Highway, the main thoroughfare over the Santa Cruz Mountains during this period, ran directly over the tunnel's south portal.\n\nThe Southern Pacific Company purchased leasing rights to the South Pacific Coast's holdings in 1887 and began upgrading the tracks to broad gauge by the early 1890s. It is unclear if the Glenwood Tunnel was already wide enough to support broad-gauged trains but it was likely expanded during this time. In 1903, Tunnel #1 in Cats Canyon was daylighted because of this construction, and Glenwood Tunnel was renumbered Tunnel #2.\n\nThe San Francisco Earthquake of April 1906 did minor damage to the Glenwood Tunnel but timetables from 1907 show through service to Laurel via Glenwood by that year, suggesting that the damage to Glenwood Tunnel was mostly superficial and easily repaired. Upgrading of the tunnel, including the erection of large and sturdy cement portals, began in ernest in late 1908, shutting down the tunnel for at least part of the year, as timetables during this time imply. The imprints above the two portals both read 1909, suggesting that construction was completed early that year. The Glenwood Tunnel was the last tunnel along the Mountain Route to be upgraded to standard gauge.\n\nExposed wood plank imprints visible along the top of the Glenwood Tunnel's north portal at Laurel.\n\nThe \"Santa Cruz-Los Gatos Rail Corridor Feasibility Study\" adds some information relevant to Glenwood Tunnel. Despite its years of good repair, the tunnel experienced periodic internal landslides from a variety of loosely-packed sedimentary rock and shale. As is in evidence today, the tunnel exposed numerous springs that were drained through side culverts out the portals north and south of the tunnel and continue to seep out today though the portals are filled. It is possible that parts of the Glenwood Tunnel were water damaged during the 1940 storm that eventually closed the line.\n\nThe re-opening of Glenwood Highway after a major construction project, 1915. The south portal of Glenwood Tunnel cannot be seen in full, but the horses are marching over it at left. (Note the metal barricade along its top).\n\nThe Glenwood Tunnel remained in regular daily use from 1880 until 1939 with few interruptions. The storm of the winter of 1939-1940 ended that, however. As rain pummeled the right-of-way, causing slides and sinks, the last trains passed through Glenwood Tunnel. Photographs of the north portal show it in apparently good repair, though the surrounding right-of-way is heavily damaged. In April 1942, H.A. Christie's railroad salvage firm finished pulling up the tracks from inside Glenwood Tunnel and blasted the entrances very near the portal mouths. Both tunnels, being composed of light sedimentary rock, collapsed heavily and definitively. Both portals are blocked only a few feet into the tunnels. The northern portal has large rocks blocking the way while the south portal seems to have been reinforced with steel girders to ensure that the road running above the tunnel remains safe for traffic. Both portals can be easily viewed today.\n\nThe approach to Glenwood Tunnel's north portal near Laurel, February 29, 1940. Note the sand on the tracks and the debris. The portal, on the other hand, seems to be intact. (Courtesy Bruce MacGregor)\n\nGlenwood Tunnel's north portal today.\n\nThe north portal itself is actually kept in decent repair. There is little to be seen from the inside, although it is only portal that you can climb on top of and see the actual wood imprints of the planks used to build the entrance. A metal fence that dates back to at least the 1930s is on top. The portal is used today as a cistern and collection basin for water, which is then used to help maintain the few houses in the area. Prior to 1989, the tunnel provided all the water for the local residents. Unfortunately, the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake blocked the major spring that provided the cistern with purpose and it now only supplements the local populace's water supply. As a warning, you may get wet if you try to visit this tunnel. However, it and the Atomic Vault in Zayante are the most easily accessed portal on the mountain route. A simple drive down Laurel Drive off of Highway 17 will pop you out at the house that guards this tunnel.\n\nGlenwood Tunnel's south\n\nportal today.\n\nThe south portal runs immediately beneath Glenwood Drive but is actually fairly difficult to see with detail. The small spring that runs out of the portal has allowed for the growth of a vast ecological niche, turning the right-of-way into a gully. Accessing the portal requires a climb, thought the portal can be observed from a distance. Drive down Glenwood Drive from Scotts Valley and park at a driveway at right just where the large field at right narrows to a point. There should be some horse corrals immediately adjacent to the driveway. The portal is to the left under the road. There are some old metal barriers that date to at least the 1930s that block pedestrians from falling over the ledge alongside the road, marking the portal. A very steep path runs down to the portal from either side, but beware of poison oak and trash that has collected at the bottom of the gully.\n\nGlenwood Tunnel's south portal as viewed from Glenwood Drive above.\n\nGlenwood Tunnel's south portal as viewed from inside. Note the sandy fill and the major steel girders\n\nsupporting the back of the portal. The entrance of the portal is overhead.\n\nRegrettably, I have not found an known image of the Glenwood Tunnel's south portal documenting it during its many decades in use. This is not unexpected but unfortunate. It was located just around the corner from Charles Martin's Glenwood Magnetic Springs Resort and its appearance compared to other portals, especially in the years prior to 1909, would be extremely interesting to note.\n\nCitations:\n\nDe Leuw, Cather & Company, \"Santa Cruz-Los Gatos Rail Corridor Feasibility Study: Draft Final Report\" (1994).\n\nSouthern Pacific System: List of Officers, Agencies and Stations, 1899.\n\n↧\n\nJourney: Zayante to Mt. Charlie Tunnel South Portal\n\nMy journey of April 7, 2013, was between Zayante Flag-Stop and Mountain Charlie Tunnel (South Portal) and included visits to the sites of Tank Siding and Virginia as well. The following map charts this route and some of the features that will appear in the photos of this hike.\n\nChart of artifacts and locations between Zayante Flag-Stop and Mountain Charlie Tunnel (South Portal)\n\nWelcome to the lovely site of Zayante Flag-Stop. There once was a siding, spur, and small enclosed platform here.\n\nZayante Flag-Stop facing east down the right-of-way. Just a grassy clearing these days.\n\nZayante Flag-Stop facing west down the right-of-way. Some Santa Cruz Water District junk sits beside the road.\n\nAn almost completely buried culvert (reading 1912) just east of Zayante Flag-Stop. The other side could not be found and, based on the assumed perpendicular path of this culvert, has also been buried.\n\nA small wooden culvert probably dating to the same time or earlier. Located just a little east of the previous culvert.\n\nAn undated culvert that nonetheless appears to be of the same type as other ones found along the route.\n\nThe right-of-way between Zayante and Tank Siding. Still despite infrequent use.\n\nFill rubble in Mountain Charlie Gulch that has slipped out from the right-of-way due to a sink.\n\nAn old block signal foundation that has been uplifted. Found at the same sink location as the fill debris above, between Zayante and Tank Siding.\n\nA small grassy clearing along the right-of-way between Zayante and Tank Siding, facing west.\n\nThe same small grassy clearing along the right-of-way between Zayante and Tank Siding, facing east.\n\nThe most westerly of three intact telegraph poles discovered, this was the last one found on the return journey to Zayante Flag-Stop, located between Zayante and Tank Siding, to the west of the Tank Siding washout.\n\nLooking at the base of this telegraph pole found a second pole that had been cut off at the base.\n\nWeston Properties Escape Road (West), located just west of Tank Siding. This is probably the fabled \"Gibbs Station\" gate that stretches from the Weston Road properties in Scotts Valley to the right-of-way. It, unfortunately, is not located anywhere near East Creek Road where Gibbs Flag-Stop was located.\n\nTank Siding, facing east, as approaching from a washout. The right-of-way sinks and curves unnaturally in this section just before widening to support the fairly large Tank Siding sidings.\n\nThe right-of-way looking (west?) from Tank Siding. Unfortunately, I didn't take enough photographs at this site to show the scale of the location. The right-of-way is generally quite wide and there is a lot of space for the water tower and other support equipment on the sides.\n\nA random artifact of recent human interaction, a California scientific team is apparently gathering data at Tank Siding using this monitoring device that has a motion (or light) sensor on its face. It didn't seem to be doing anything.\n\nTank Siding facing west. Here the large grassy field at left (south) can be noticed.\n\nTank Siding facing east. The field is now somewhat behind me and to the right.\n\nOvergrown right-of-way east of Tank Siding, facing east.\n\nNarrow right-of-way passage between Tank Siding and Virginia, facing east.\n\nMuddy overgrown clearing between Tank Siding and Virginia, facing east. Evidence of recent vehicular use here is due to the Weston Properties Escape Road located b\n\nDiscovered on the return journey, this pole and its pair located just down the right-of-way, were both on the northern side atop a low shoulder. Apparently H.A. Christie's firm didn't find it worthwhile to remove poles on high places.\n\nA rail and a cut telegraph pole in a heap beside the right-of-way. This was the only rail that was found along this stretch of former tracks, though numerous telegraph poles remains were discovered.\n\nGrassy right-of-way between Tank Siding and Virginia, facing east.\n\nGrassy right-of-way between Tank Siding and Virginia, facing west.\n\nA narrow passage on the right-of-way between Tank Siding and Virginia, facing east.\n\nThe first pole discovered on the return journey. Between Tank Siding and Virginia.\n\nAnother culvert just before the Virginia Flag-Stop crossing. The top was not accessible to check for dates.\n\nWhy did the Wild Turkey cross the right-of-way?\n\nTo show everyone where Virginia Flag-Stop is!!! Virginia Flag-Stop still exists as a wide clearing where a private driveway crosses over the Santa Cruz Water District access road. The right-of-way continues, unmaintained, straight ahead east, above, while the driveway wraps around to the left. This driveway probably was a connecting wagon or skid road for hauling lumber around the turn of the 19th century.\n\nThe Virginia clearing looking west. The right-of-way continues behind the tractor and is blocked by a SCWD gate, though neither are visible here due to the tractor blocking the route. The driveway continues up the hill and around a turn, presumably terminating on Mountain Charlie Road which runs along the ridge.\n\nA broader view of the Virginia Flag-Stop clearing, showing the space for a short siding to hold waiting lumber loads.\n\nThe much more heavily overgrown right-of-way east of Virginia. The driveway is just visible downhill at left.\n\nThe right-of-way becomes increasingly unnavigable the further from the driveway you walk. Facing west.\n\nThe extremely overgrown right-of-way east of Virginia, facing east.\n\nThe overgrown right-of-way east of Virginia, facing west.\n\nAnother upturned block signal foundation, though the reason why this one has been pulled is unknown. I presume it has been sitting this way since it was first removed 70 years ago.\n\nLooming through the brush, an ominous monument to modernity stands abandoned. What is it?\n\nWhy, it's Mountain Charlie Tunnel's south (west) portal! And it looks as good as it probably did 71 years ago when it was first dynamited...well, except for the massive pile of sand pouring out of its mouth.\n\nClimbing up inside, here is a view of the hole through which brave explorers once were able to climb to access the hidden depths of reopened tunnel.\n\nUnfortunately, such days are over. In 2011, a shift in the sands caused the entire tunnel to collapse on itself again. There is no longer any through access. The tunnel is sealed again...\n\nA single window of light brightens the interior, a hole that long ago rotted through the ceiling just beyond the cement.\n\nBut the tunnel portal still has a lot to offer, so let's check it out some more.\n\nFirst off, here is a rotten support beam that is partially buried in the rubble near the top of the pile.\n\nA second, more intact beam sits beside an infant redwood tree outside the portal.\n\nA view from inside the portal looking out shows just how much the redwood saplings are retaking the right-of-way.\n\nIn bold print stamped at the top of the portal are the numbers \"1908\" signifying the year this portal was completed.\n\nA pair of small banana slugs chill out in front of the tunnel. They've been a constant companion on this journey.\n\nThe tiered molding on the sides of the portal are very interesting, though I don't entirely understand their purpose. I don't entirely remember seeing this style at other portals along the route, though most others have their sides buried. Both sides of this portal has its wings exposed.\n\nView from the top looking down. Not much to see except redwood saplings and moss.\n\nOn the climb up to the top of the portal, this ceramic pipe was found, apparently diverting water from a culvert.\n\nThe pipe was broken and I found this other end on the opposite side of the portal leading into...\n\n...this cistern, found above and to the right of the portal, which I believe once collected water to be redirected through the piping away from the right side of the portal, a task which it failed to accomplish...\n\n...as can be seen here, looking down on the right side of the portal, which is completely exposed.\n\nInterestingly, just above where the piping was no longer connected, the hole through the ceiling could be found.\n\nIn 2010, I explored this portal and was able to access the interior. A large area above the tunnel's right-of-way was opened up to the elements and accessible both from inside, by climbing over two debris piles, and from the outside by hiking through this. All of the brush and branches are new but the original sand hill can be seen in the background, much further back than it was three years ago adding emphasis to the fact that this tunnel most certainly collapsed again. It's a wonder that it survived daily train operation for 60 years!\n\nThat's all for this journey, but I have many more that I will be working on in coming weeks to post. Please feel free to comment and give me your input and observations.\n\nDisclaimer: The accuracy of the geographic locations on this map are estimates based on photographs taken during the hike. Specific memories or assessments may be incorrect. I apologize for any such oversights. All photographs taken by myself or my wife on April 7, 2013.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nEccles Tunnel\n\nLocation of Eccles Tunnel (Courtesy Duncan Nanney)\n\nEccles Tunnel, formally SPC Tunnel #5 then later Tunnel #4 and sometimes known as the Zayante Tunnel, is a fairly well-known and easily accessed tunnel in Zayante Creek. This is partially because, of all the tunnels over the Santa Cruz Mountains, this is the only one to survive other than the Mission Tunnel in Santa Cruz City. Located north of Kenville Flag-Stop, the tunnel was originally built using redwood beams for both the supports inside and the portals around 1879 by the South Pacific Coast Railroad. It was rebuilt in 1907 after the San Francisco Earthquake and its interior and portals still retain that material, though it has been added to in recent years.\n\nThe tunnel measures a meager 240 feet, making it the shortest tunnel along the route. It is entirely concrete-lined, probably due to its length, and it measures 22 feet high and 17 feet wide. The tunnel continued in service as a railroad tunnel until the winter of 1939-1940 closed the Mountain Route permanently.\n\nThe Atomic Vault facility on 1 February 1957\n\nThe backside of the Eccles Tunnel has seen better days,\n\nbut appears much more like a tunnel portal.\n\nWhen H.A. Christie's railroad salvage firm pulled up the tracks and dynamited the other three longer tunnels along the route, the Southern Pacific Company requested that this small tunnel be saved. For thirteen years, the SPRC maintained the tunnel as a storage unit before finally selling it to Western States Atomic Vault Company (which was later purchased by FileSafe) in 1953. Under their guidance, the tunnel was modified to serve as a storage facility able to withstand nuclear assault and was renamed the Zayante Atomic Vault. The vault opened on 2 May 1954 and has remained in use for that purpose ever since. During the height of the Cold War, some of California's most important documents were stored in this tunnel, including the original journals of the State Legislature, the State Constitution, and microfilms of Spanish archives. Rumors also state that Walk Disney kept some of his earliest works stored in this archive.\n\nToday, the tunnel can still be seen if walking along the old right-of-way north of Olympia or if one drives up Madrone Road past the Zayante Market. The entire area is surrounded by chain-linked fence but the overseer doesn't mind if people climb over the vault to get to the back end of the tunnel. The back end is also fenced off but appears much more like a railroad tunnel. The date, \"1907,\" is still stamped over the high arch above the northern portal. The right-of-way then continues northward toward Meehan.\n\nNo known photographs of this tunnel during its existence as a railroad tunnel exist.\n\nCitations:\n\nDe Leuw, Cather & Company, \"Santa Cruz-Los Gatos Rail Corridor Feasibility Study: Final Draft Report,\" prepared for the Joint Policy Board (December 1994).\n\n↧\n\nLaurel Trestle\n\nLocation of trestle at bottom. (Courtesy Duncan Nanney)\n\nSkirting Burns Creek and eventually crossing it immediately before the Summit Tunnel's south portal, the right-of-way north of Laurel supported many hillside trestles. These partial trestles, generally supported on one side by a hill and the other by redwood support beams, still remain along the right-of-way in Laurel Canyon. This region is rather unique because of these trestles. Despite sharp turns and narrow passages elsewhere along the route, the only other evidence of hillside trestles are really found along Bean Creek in Glenwood, and there they are used only sparsely and are fairly short. The hillside trestles in Laurel Canyon, on the other hand, are quite long and often completely remove the tracks from the ground, constituting a true trestle. A photograph of this route in broad gauge times demonstrates the extreme usage of these hillside trestles:\n\nHillside trestles in Laurel Canyon.\n\nSelect other locations along the Mountain Route, specifically the beautiful arched cement hillside trestle near Inspiration Point, also utilized this type of trestle, but it was relatively rare along the route.\n\nHowever, despite these trestles, it was only where the right-of-way was forced to cross Burns Creek, a tributary of Soquel Creek, that the Laurel Trestle, sometimes known as the Burns Creek Trestle, was required.\n\nLaurel Trestle soon after construction, 1882.\n\nLaurel Trestle sat directly in front of the south portal of Summit Tunnel. When it was first constructed in 1878 to allow access to the Summit Tunnel for construction, the bridge was made entirely of local redwood timbers. Burns Creek was never a very deep creek in this region and, as an early 1882 photograph shows, the creek nearly touched the bottom of the trestle. In later years, the creek was likely dredged to keep the water off of the tracks. As it sits today, in ruins, the trestle measures about 15 feet above the bottom of the creek.\n\nIt is unknown precisely when this bridge was reconstructed to support broad gauging, though it was certainly broad-gauged by 1907 when the entire line was refitted. The later design likely dates from around 1903 when preparations were being made prior to the 1906 Earthquake. Oddly, no published work seems to document the history of this trestle despite its frequent use in railroad books. It only merits a passing mention in the \"Santa Cruz-Los Gatos Rail Corridor Feasibility Study\". It's length, unfortunately, was unknown due to these oversights.\n\nLaurel Trestle and Summit Tunnel south portal, c. 1910s.\n\nWhat can be said about the trestle from documentary evidence is that it always had guard rails along its sides, though the reason for these is unknown. The trestle was a single-width trestle and, unlike most other tunnel exits, there was no siding anywhere near the tunnel's portal or the trestle. The area today is heavily wooded but during much of its existence, as evidenced above, it was in a clearing created by logging operations in the area. The underside of the trestle was made up of two rows of five redwood pillars with additional support pillars near the end foundations. No concrete was used.\n\nLaurel Trestle and surrounding area, February 29, 1940. (Courtesy Bruce MacGregor)\n\nThe trestle itself was relatively unscathed by the 1939-1940 storm season, but the surrounding area was a mess. The photograph above shows a tower of some sort beside the tunnel, though the purpose of this tower is unknown. The entire Mountain Division was shut down later in 1940 due to damage such as this along the route. The bridge was pulled in 1942 by H.A. Christie's railroad salvage firm, though the support pillars remain in Burns Creek to this day. These final two photographs are of those support pillars:\n\nNorthern support pilings for Laurel Trestle, overgrown and pushed upward by roots, 2011.\n\nBridge support beams for Laurel Trestle in Burns Creek, looking south, 2011.\n\n↧\n\nFahihn & Forest Lakes Flag-Stops\n\nLocation of Gold Gulch and its spur along the\n\nFelton Branch. (Courtesy Duncan Nanney)\n\nTwo Southern Pacific Railroad flag-stops were located near the bottom of Gold Gulch Creek south of Felton along the Felton Branch. Although one may not directly succeed the other in location, the two were and remain related. The stations catered to a region that was frequently under intense logging development by Frederick Augustus Hihn, a local entrepreneur and investor.\n\nThe location that would become Fahihn and Forest Lakes began its life, oddly enough, as a gold prospecting region. Gold was discovered on Frederick Augustus Hihn's property along a creek which quickly became named Gold Gulch around 1880.\n\nA sluice along Gold Gulch operated by C.H. Jewitt.\n\n(From Report of the State Mineralogist)\n\nF.B. Stirling was the one licensed to develop the find and his discovery of gold valued at roughly $35,000 is said to have heavily contributed to Hihn's increasing fortune during this period. Stirling followed up his discovery by boring a 900 foot hole into the mountain west of Gold Gulch, but no further major discoveries were found. The sedimentary nature of the Coast Range made it impossible to locate ore veins in the hills. C.H. Jewitt took over operations from Stirling for an additional two years, operating sluices and pumps in the creek to try and sift out gold deposits. His attempts failed, though, and Hihn closed down operations by the end of the 1880s.\n\nBy 1899, Frederick Hihn had other operations in the Gold Gulch region and the Fahihn Flag-Stop, also called Fahihn Switch, located 76 south of San Francisco via Alameda Point according to the 1899 Station Book, catered to his operations there. It hosted a B-class freight station including probably one or two sidings to hold waiting cars. A spur line (hence the \"switch\") also headed up along what is today Lakeview Drive to a spot near the top of the creek. The flag-stop was without doubt named after F.A. Hihn himself who owned most of the land in the region including a lime kiln and brick yard up Gold Gulch. His spur line most certainly catered to his lime operations in the area, though it is unclear whether it was a short-line narrow-gauge railroad or simply a ox spur. The last mention of the site is in 1908, which suggests Hihn sold his properties soon after this date to Weltha A. and Thomas L. Bell.\n\nOriginal property sign for Forest Lakes. (Courtesy Howard Rugg)\n\nThe Bells owned a property development north of Fahihn known as Tanglewood and purchased Hihn's land as well, though records of the purchase have not been found. Evidence of the relationship between the Bell's new Forest Lakes property and Tanglewood is evident from a sign posted by the Bell's property manager, Les Ashley. The property development was named after two artificial lakes that had been created along Gold Gulch Creek. Today, one of those lakes still survives as the seasonal municipal swimming hole. The other lake, located directly north of it, disappeared when developers filled the area to build a home. The Bells' vast tracks of property subdivisions by 1915 stretched from Oak Avenue near the present entrance to Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park all the way to Tollhouse Gulch Road near the San Lorenzo Road Toll House. Their home was probably off of Rincon Road near Glengarry Road.\n\nThe names of Gold Gulch and Forest Lakes both survive today along Highway 9. Forest Lakes is an insular community unified by the Forest Lakes Mutual Water Company, a remnant of the original Bell property subdivision there. It is located on the west side of Highway nine about a mile south of Henry Cowell Redwood State Park. Gold Gulch, likewise, is a private community located just south of the entrance to Forest Lakes on the east side of the road.\n\nThe location of the physical railroad stop is not entirely known. The right-of-way passed through the current Gold Gulch property but the station was likely near River Lane, where the right-of-way is fairly level with the main road. South of that location, the property of Henry Cowell prohibited a station, while any location north of that site would not have provided enough space for the Gold Gulch lime spur. Further investigation of the history of both locations is ongoing.\n\nCitations:\n\nCalifornia State Mining Bureau, Report of the State Mineralogist, Vol 17 (1921).\n\nDonald Thomas Clark, Santa Cruz Place Names: A Geographical Dictionary.

(Courtesy Duncan Nanney)\n\nAfter a number of years of service to Old Felton only via a spur at Felton Junction, the Southern Pacific Railroad decided to add the Felton Grove Trestle, or simply the Felton Trestle, as a spur off of the Boulder Creek Branch, thereby completing a loop. The Felton Grove Trestle was a standard design truss bridge, appearing so much like the current Henry Cowell (Big Trees) trestle or the double-truss trestle above the San Lorenzo River in Santa Cruz near the Boardwalk. Because of this standard design, it is likely that the bridge was only installed when the line was broad-gauged in the early 1900s. Prior to that time, service over the river was not possible except via the original Santa Cruz & Felton narrow gauge line heading north from Felton Junction. Evidence from a 1908 subdivision map of Felton Grove (below), however, suggests another bridge may have existed, which would have probably dated to around 1885 when the Boulder Creek Branch was first built. Since this would have been a South Pacific Coast design, the bridge probably would have been simple wood timbers rather than concrete and steal.\n\nExcerpt of original subdivision map of Felton Grove, focusing specifically on the Felton Trestle crossing at left, c. 1908. The dotted line above the right-of-way suggests that a narrow-gauge track and trestle originally did head to Old Felton slightly closer to the covered bridge, though no photos of this trestle are extant. (Courtesy Vicki Wees)\n\nFelton Covered Bridge, with trestle beside it, in the early 1920s. (Image from CardCow.com)\n\nThe trestle was mounted on two concrete curbs that flanked either side of the river just beside the Felton Covered Bridge. The bridge was removed and likely reused or sold for scrap metal a number of years after the Southern Pacific ended service to Old Felton, though the precise date that the bridge was removed remains uncertain. The bridge may well have remained at the site into the 1930s before it was finally removed. A 1928 map of the Felton Grove subdivision, however, showed that the rail line itself was removed by that year.\n\nFelton Trestle in the late 1920s or early 1930s after the line had ceased operation. Tracks appear to still be on the trestle, suggesting a date closer to 1926. (Courtesy Yesteryear Depot)\n\nToday, the trestle is gone but one of its curbs is easily viewed from the southward-facing windows of the Felton Covered Bridge. It sits on the west bank and can be walked upon. The eastern curb is set back from the river and sits beside a home that uses the hollowed-out curb as a fence for their dumpster. A gate has been installed on the eastern side of the curb. This, too, can be viewed from some of the windows of the bridge, though it is more difficult to discern.\n\nThe ivy-covered eastern curb of the Felton Trestle, from the Covered Bridge, 2012.\n\nThe easily viewed and exposed western curb of the Felton Trestle, from the Covered Bridge, 2012.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nJourneys: Harmony Acres to Waterman Switch\n\nAfter three emails from two colleagues praising the exploration value of the upper Dougherty Extension Railroad, I could not help but check it out. As a bit of background, the Dougherty Extension existed between 1887, when Dougherty's original mill in Zayante burned down, and 1915, when the lumbering north of Boulder Creek ended. Parts of the line remained in use until 1917 to sell land at the Riverside Grove and Wildwood subdivisions, though the tracks north of those subdivisions may have been pulled earlier. By the late 1910s and early 1920s, nature was retaking the stretch of tracks north of Boulder Creek and the tracks had been removed. The line was narrow gauged throughout its existence and when the tracks were removed, the 30-year-old ties were abandoned, maintaining a 96-year vigil to the present along parts of the right-of-way.\n\nTo get to the site, Duncan Nanney described it to me with Brian Liddicoat supporting the directions. After entering Castle Rock State Park along northbound CA Route 9, look for a sign advertising 1/4 mile to a pullout, which is immediately followed by a fire road on the right that doubles as the original Saratoga Toll Road with two mailboxes at the end of it. The pullout sign is sitting on the right-of-way and the road is roughly the site of Waterman Switch. The northbound right-of-way is obvious and easily navigable as it parallels the Saratoga Toll Road (a state park fire road and hiking trail) for some time before breaking off again (and eventually dead-ending). Southbound, though, is another story. The San Lorenzo River dives through an 8' high culvert under the highway and there is something of a trail heading down to it on the south side of the road. Once beside the burgeoning river, head up the opposite hillside. Do not cross the river, just cross the small stream bed and onto the flat clearing opposite. From there, you should be able to easily spot the slightly recessed right-of-way. Begin your journey southbound along the Boulder Creek & Pescadero Railroad!\n\nChart of artifacts and locations between \"Harmony Acres\" private drive and Waterman Switch\n\nThe right-of-way looking northbound from CA Route 9 near Saratoga Toll Road.\n\nThe right-of-way looking northbound toward CA Route 9.

Ten years later, in 1875, another venture funded primarily by Frederick Hihn completed the Santa Cruz & Felton Railroad with its northern terminus at Felton. Felton was a growing town in the 1870s and the logging industries of the northern San Lorenzo Valley were demanding freight access to the ocean. The SC&F RR in conjunction with the San Lorenzo Valley Flume & Transportation Company fulfilled that wish when together the created a network of logging flumes and railroad tracks that ran the length of the valley. The importance of Felton during this period cannot be ignored. Felton served as the switching yards where the lumber from the primary flume was disgorged and loaded onto awaiting flatcars for service via rail to Santa Cruz. These yards stretched from roughly the current site of New Leaf Market to the Quik Stop along two parallel spurs. In 1883, all that ended as the South Pacific Coast Railroad began replacing the primary flume with a track that eventually ran (via the Dougherty Extension Railway) all the way to Castle Rock State Park.\n\nThe Felton flume terminus, looking north, sometime between 1875 and 1883. Trains are parked on\n\nspurs on either side of the flume to load lumber more efficiently.\n\nIn 1879, Felton Depot was also displaced as the primary station for the town of Felton. \"New\" Felton Station sprang up beside the new South Pacific Coast tracks in the Welch Ranch on the other side of the river. The \"Old\"Felton Station remained at the terminus of a spur line that followed the original SC&F track on the west side of the river. With the coming of the SPC, passenger service began heading to Old Felton though the timetables would not list Old Felton as a stop until 1889. Service to Old Felton would continued for forty years, though the branch would remain primarily a freight line.\n\nThe Southern Pacific Railroad took over all of the SPC's operations in 1887 including the Felton Branch. By 1899, the Station Book notes that Old Felton Station was 76.5 miles south of San Francisco via Alameda Point. It had a B-class station, which included two long loading spurs, the easternmost of which eventually became the loop spur back to New Felton via a trestle built beside the Felton Covered Bridge. The purpose for the continued existence of this line was to service a few lime kilns, primarily the Holmes Kiln in downtown Felton, as well as some regional logging mills. By the 1920s, though, even those operations shuttered and on July 22, 1926, the Old Felton Station closed for good.\n\n1895 excerpt from a Sanborn Fire Insurance Company map of Felton, showing the possible site of Felton Station. Baldwin Ave is CA Route 9 and Maple is most likely Russel Ave. (Courtesy UCSC Digital Map Collection)\n\nToday, even the site of Old Felton Station is not known, with no existing photographs of the post-flume site publicly available. Speculation places the station near the Mountain Community Resources Center on the east side of the track since that is the end of the longest spur, but logic would place it much further south near the base of Laurel Street where the three major spur lines converge. Evidence from historic maps also suggest this since no station (or tracks for that matter) appear in most survey maps of downtown Felton during the years of the line's existence. One 1895 map of Felton does note a SPC warehouse and Holmes warehouse on the east side of the tracks across from Russell Ave. (then called Maple), but no station building is present.\n\nCitations:\n\nSouthern Pacific System: List of Officers, Agencies and Stations, 1899.\n\nClark, Donald Thomas.

While the day-to-day operations of this limekiln was not entirely catalogued, there are numerous images of the kiln in existence, as well as an expertly-rendered overhead sketch of the arrangement of the factory and its railroad spurs.\n\nThe history of the kiln itself is well documented. Founded in July 1876 by Henry T. Holmes, a San Francisco lime merchant, the company set up shop in a region outside the town of Felton on land sold to Holmes by Eben Bennett, who owned the Santa Cruz-Felton Toll Road. Bennett already had a small kiln on the property but it was Holmes that took it up a notch. Henry Holmes generally remained in San Francisco and his superintendent, William Russell, ran the operation in Felton for the company. During the heyday of the kiln, it, with Henry Cowell's Limeworks and the IXL Lime Company in Fall Creek, produced 95% of the lime shipped to San Francisco and 50% of the state's lime. During a two-year span, Holmes's mill produced 220,000 barrels of lime. In 1896, the IXL Lime Company went bankrupt due to a financial panic, but Cowell and Holmes survived into the 20th century. During this period, Holmes expanded his operations to Bonny Doon and into Southern California, helping to fill the increased demand caused by the 1906 Earthquake. Also sometime during this period, Henry Holmes died and a relative, W.H. Holmes, took over management of the company. In 1921, the organization was renamed the Holmes Lime & Cement Company but the enterprise was already failing as Portlant concrete was taking over the lime market, and the new factory in Davenport was exceeding demand. The Holmes Company was finally forced to shut down its Felton operations in the early 1930s, soon after the Felton Branch of the railroad had ceased.\n\n1908 Sanborn Fire Insurance Company map of H.T. Holmes Kiln.\n\nThe original right-of-way to the kiln mostly followed Laurel Drive in downtown Felton, turning at the top of the road into a private residence and following Bull Creek on its east side. The kiln sat beside and slightly below this creek in a clearing. The Google Map image above is superimposed from a 1889 surveyor map of the town of Felton.\n\nA 1908 Sanborn Fire Insurance Company map documents this lime kiln at its height, showcasing a slightly later period than the surveyor map with the two short freight spurs now connected and continuing out of the image at bottom, though its eventual destination, if any, is unknown. The primary kilns were on the left, above the rest of the operation where wagons could unload the unprocessed lime into the tops of the kilns. They were processed in the clearing below the kilns, where a pair of railroad sidings straddled the primary cooperage and freight house. Other outbuildings were littered around the area, while the tracks returning to Felton headed north.\n\nAn excellent image of the mill is below showing the mill during a busy day. A box car sits on the tracks in the distance and hundreds of bricks are stacked in the foreground. A second image similar to this is available in Lisa Robinson's Images of America: San Lorenzo Valley (Arcadia Press, 2012).

(Courtesy Anthony Tyler)\n\nRemains of this mill are said to still exist within private property west of Felton, though this author has not seen the artifacts nor heard a first-person account of them. The introduction to Lime Kiln Legacies mentions that of the five pot kilns and two continuous kilns originally present at the site, a few of the pot kilns may still be visible, though they have been repurposed. The right-of-way itself is almost entirely on private property, though it is visible in plain site on the south side of Laurel Drive until the road turns into a private driveway. One last note, the Holmes Kiln should not be confused with the Bull Creek Kilns located behind the Felton Post Office. No railroad access was ever granted to that kiln and its history is unrelated.\n\nCitations:\n\nFrank Perry, et al., \"Introduction\", Lime Kiln Legacies (Santa Cruz, CA: Museum of Art & History, 2007).\n\nRobert W.

While initially there was an appeal for the site by the railroad, other company-owned picnic areas were soon built usurping those places already established. In addition, after the 1920s, the location was borne out of a new phenomenon—the automobile—and had no reason to cater to the old. That being said, the area that Felton Grove now occupies was not always reserved for the age of the automobile. Prior to the mass usage of the cars, the area was noted as a picnic area sitting beside the east bank of the San Lorenzo River in Felton. Its location directly to the south of the Southern Pacific Felton Branch extension tracks were a fact that could not be ignored. Whether trains ever actually stopped at Felton Grove may never be known for certain, but there is direct evidence of tourists using the train to arrive at the picnic grounds and, once the Boulder Creek branch was built beside the park, logic would dictate that such a flag-stop was established, if only briefly.\n\nA mule team hauling a log alongside the tracks opposite Felton Grove, c. 1890. (Courtesy Valley Press)\n\nThe history of Felton Grove itself is interesting and increasingly being documented by Vicki Wees via her blog at www.FeltonGrove.com. According to her site and research done by Randall Brown on her behalf, the Felton Grove subdivision was first planned in 1864 by Edward Stanley, the founder of Felton town. When the town itself was constructed the next year, though, it was built at a slightly higher elevation above the river on the west bank. Felton Grove didn't seem to enter the scene until July 4th, 1873, when a large dance floor was constructed in the flats near the river and a picnic area was established. The site at this time was known as Camp Felton, though it also sometimes went by the name Maple Grove, through some confusion between sycamores and maples. From that point onward, the site of Felton Grove became an established picnicking spot for both Felton residents and visitors.\n\nAn article from the Santa Cruz Sentinel discusses the merits of Felton Grove and its early relationship with the South Pacific Coast Railroad (transcribed by Vicki Wees):\n\nWithin a few hundred yards of Felton, just across the San Lorenzo and between it and the Zayante, lies the prettiest spot for picnics and camping parties on the whole San Lorenzo. It has been used by the people of Felton to picnic at for many years, and the grove has been partially cleared of underbrush, avenues and winding walks have been cut, rustic seats put in many places, tables and benches to accommodate a great many put up, a large dancing floor laid, and many other things done to make it pleasant and comfortable, but the place has been known to few besides the Feltonites. Now that the S. P. C. R. R. is in running order, picnic parties have discovered this lovely retreat, and it is occupied from a party from San Francisco numbering some two hundred, who propose to stay some time. They are very comfortably settled, having sent down in advance three car-loads of freight, with men to put up tents and arrange things for housekeeping. They have thirty four white tents among the green trees, and the camp has a very cheerful, animated look. There is a large majority of women and children during the week, but on Saturdays the husbands and fathers come down to spend Monday with their families in the quiet shades of this most beautiful grove. They spend their time hunting, fishing, bathing, gathering ferns, flowers, etc., and in visiting the different lime kilns, mills, big trees-which are only a short mile from camp-go to Santa Cruz and take a plunge in the ocean and come back on the next train. – June 17, 1880\n\nFrederick A. Hihn's papers track the progression of ownership of the property. An early lease of the land by F.A. Hihn to Joseph Ball for one year began on 27 November 1891. On February 15, 1906, Hihn officially named the site Felton Grove & the Felton Baseball Ground and passed lease and resale rights to individuals named Glass and Draper. On June 24, 1908, he leased a remaining part of the property to C.H. Webb. On Sep. 24, 1910, Hihn formally deeded a large part of the grove to D. Goulding. From the 1910s through the 1920s, ownership of the site becomes murky. By the mid-1920s, it seems the Beaver family owned the property, and in 1940 the Wright family took over and retained ownership thereafter.\n\nIn 1922, everything changed. The Felton Grove Auto Camp embraced the new trend of people traveling the country in automobiles and visiting hard-to-reach locals to camp and enjoy nature. The area between Felton Depot and downtown Felton, today known as Felton Faire, was not yet developed. Meadows dominated the landscape where buildings were not constructed and local entrepreneurs decided that the Felton Grove picnic area beside the river was a perfect place to start a tourist resort.\n\nFelton Baseball Park, circa 1920s. The railroad tracks are just barely visible in the foreground at bottom-left. This tree still stands today within the parking lot of Felton Bible Church. (Courtesy Vicki Wees, FeltonGrove.com)\n\nAutomobiles came from all around and a summer camp was established as one of the features of the park. Visitors arriving by train were picked up at Felton Depot and driven to the nearby camp. Tennis courts, a baseball field, and the dancing pavilion were all built or maintained to increase the allure of the park. A camp headquarters building was constructed and still exists today as a run-down private residence visible straight ahead when one turns down Park Avenue behind the laundromat. The river itself, of course, was one of the primary draws to the site and a small swimming hole, created through an earthen dam, was maintained at the meeting of Zayante Creek and the San Lorenzo River. The tent cabins themselves were wooden with canvas ceilings and would be deconstructed during the winter so as not to wash away during the violent floods.\n\nFelton Grove in 1937 at the top of Park Avenue. The tracks in the foreground remain though they are no longer used, with service to Boulder Creek having ended three years prior. (Courtesy Vicki Wees, FeltonGrove.com)\n\nThe resort lasted in some form or another for over three decades but by the 1930s, the parceling out of land began. An early subdivision layout (below) shows one of the proposed plans for the site. The actual plots were much larger and the road layout much more haphazard, with Maple becoming Circle, Grove becoming River, Sylvan Way cutting down the middle, and no homes being built east of Park Avenue except directly along the river. The dream of River Park Way was probably washed away in one of the frequent and disastrous floods that were known to hit Felton Grove, such as those in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Resort features, though, such as dancing, tennis, and baseball continued through the early 1950s and perhaps later.\n\nThe legacy of the railroad at Felton Grove is shadowy and not well-documented unfortunately. While Felton Grove was bookended with trestles over Zayante Creek to the east and the river to the west, both were considered the northern boundary of the Felton Grove property. No signage regarding a stop seems to exist nor evidence that any trains stopped there specifically. Felton Grove appears on no time tables or the 1899 Station Book, and its close proximity to both Felton depots suggests it may have been a rarely-used special excursion stop rather than even an informal flag-stop.\n\nThe Felton Branch closed down around 1928 and any traffic that may have gone to Felton Grove certainly ceased at that time. The original right-of-way was parceled out to make squat wide properties that appear a part of the current Felton Grove subdivision but are not formally members. The original junction between the Boulder Creek branch and the Felton branch extension occurred at the junction of Graham Hill Road and Park Avenue, just beyond the subdivision boundaries. From there heading east, the tracks continued to serve as the northern boundary until reaching Zayante Creek. In the extremely unlikely event that railroad traffic continued to stop at Felton Grove, it would have been along this stretch between 1928 and 1934, when that branch also was discontinued.\n\nCitations:\n\nVicki Wees, www.FeltonGrove.com (2013).\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nZayante Creek Trestle\n\nMap showing location of Zayante Creek Trestle\n\nbeside Graham Hill Rd. (Courtesy Duncan Nanney)\n\nOnce prominent on the drive between Old Felton and Felton Depot along Graham Hill Road sat the Zayante Creek Trestle, located immediately west of Felton Depot beside the Felton Grove baseball park (current Felton Bible Church). The original narrow-gauged trestle was constructed probably beginning in July 1883 immediately after approval for the Boulder Creek Branch of the South Pacific Coast Railroad. The bridge crossed Zayante Creek at a point that is now immediately beside Graham Hill Road, though in 1883 Graham Hill Road does not appear to have crossed the creek, instead turning into modern-day Mount Hermon via Roaring Camp Road. Any photographs of this earlier trestle seem to have disappeared and conclusions concerning its design can only be guessed at. Considering the speed at which the original Boulder Creek Branch was built and the funds available to the South Pacific Coast Railroad, it is likely that the trestle was a simple and standard wooden design with support poles installed in the creek bed.\n\nA woman standing on the new Graham Hill Road Bridge around 1930. The trestle, raised above the\n\nlevel of the road, is clearly visible behind her with telephone wires spanning overhead.\n\nThe western cement curb with the date \"1917\" printed on both ends of it.\n\nThe Southern Pacific took over the route in 1887 but the trestle probably didn't change for another 30 years. At some point during this period, a second branch line was routed to Old Felton via a trestle built beside Felton Grove and the Felton Covered Bridge. Thus, the Zayante Creek Trestle now brought rail traffic from both branch lines. It is possible that a new trestle was installed in the mid-1900s when the line was broad-gauged, but evidence suggests otherwise. The trestle was definitely replaced in 1917, as date stamps on the surviving portions of the structure attest to that year. A cement pillar was installed in the creek for support and a cement curb was placed on the west bank. The east bank, instead of having a similar cement curb, had an extended causeway that was supported by short wooden poles until reaching a terminus at a wooden curb. Why this was done is unknown. At least two photographs of this second trestle survive.\n\nModern water conduit, looking east, over Zayante Creek, using the cement support pillar to support the pipe.\n\nAlthough service to Felton ended in the mid-1920s, the trestle remained in use until around 1934 when the Boulder Creek Branch was closed, at which point the bridge was removed.

To the east of the bridge, the remnants of the eastern wooden curb are visible across from the Mount Hermon Maintenance Shop driveway. There is a short turn off that heads into ProBuild's parking lot and the wooden curb is visible at the head of it. This turn off is, in fact, the original surviving right-of-way of the Boulder Creek and Felton branches. The right-of-way breaks off suddenly when it reaches the formal ProBuild driveway, which has been filled in over the years to decrease the grade.

(Courtesy Duncan Nanney)\n\nLocated a mile north of Felton Depot, roughly at the modern-day site of Rose Acres Daybreak Camp at the end of San Lorenzo Way, once sat the rustic flag-stop of Bonnie Brae (or alternatively, Bonny Brae). An August 19, 1923, Southern Pacific timetable notes that the site was 73.4 miles south of San Francisco via the Mayfield Cut-off, 6.3 miles south of Boulder Creek, and 0.9 miles north of Felton. It maintained no regular arrival or departure times, confirming that it was, indeed, only a flag-stop. The location does not appear in the 1899 Station Book, which doesn't seem surprising as it also does not appear on any other available timetables until 1915.\n\nDonald T. Clark first noted the site in his Santa Cruz County Place Names as appearing in internal Southern Pacific timetables in 1915. This probably coincides with the creation of the community around the flag-stop. It is likely that the flag-stop remained until the end of the line in 1934. Clark further speculates that the name was probably created by railroad builders simply to imply that the site was a \"pretty hillside\", which would be the direct translation of the name into modern English. However, this suggests also that the name predates 1915 by at least thirty years to the building of the line in 1885, which no other evidence supports. Considering the flag-stop must have catered to the small community that resided on the east bank of the San Lorenzo River along San Lorenzo Way, this author suggests that it was originally named after a small housing development that arose in the area in the late 1900s or early 1910s. Documentary evidence agrees that there was a subdivision under the name \"Bonnie Brae\" in existence until at least the 1940s. If Rick Hamman's map has any accuracy in this regard, the location of the physical flag-stop, if any existed, was near the north end of the road, which coincides with the only place where residences are on both sides of the right-of-way.\n\nModern site of Bonnie Brae, looking north. The Christmas Tree farm is at the end of this road, which was the right-of-way until 1934. The flag-stop was probably somewhere in this clearing.\n\nRegardless of the actual status of the flag-stop, it ceased functioning at latest by 1934 when the Boulder Creek Branch was removed. The right-of-way through the area became Rose Acres Lane and is still passable today. Heading south to Felton Depot, the right-of-way passes through the parking lot of Rose Acres Daybreak Camp and then continues for another half-mile before dead-ending at a fence and a hedge. Heading north, the right-of-way passes through a Christmas Tree farm before resuming on the opposite side on its journey to Brackney. Other than the paved right-of-way, no visible remnant of the railroad survives in the Bonnie Brae area.\n\nCitations:\n\nClark, Donald Thomas, Santa Cruz County Place Names: A Geographic Dictionary (Scotts Valley, CA: Kestrel Press, 2008).\n\n↧\n\nBrackney Flag-Stop\n\nLocation of Brackney station and region (Courtesy Duncan Nanney)\n\nIt is common knowledge that the narrow pair bridges along CA State Route 9 between Felton and Ben Lomond are two of the most despised heavily-trafficked bridges in the county. What many do not know, however, is that the small community located there, Brackney, was once the site of a Southern Pacific Railroad flag-stop.\n\nThe area was named after Alonzo L. Brackney, a Pennsylvanian farmer who settled in the region at some point prior to 1889. He had built a small ranch on the river's jetty and transcripts available in the UC Santa Cruz Digital Collection note that Brackney purchased the entire jetty on May 18, 1889, from Frederick A. Hihn. This purchase was later confirmed on January 1, 1898, in official court records. The location of this ranch provided a crucial link between the Zayante Rancho (Felton) and the land being developed in Glen Arbor. Brackney's land was to encompass the entirety of the river jetty all the way to the Southern Pacific Railroad's right-of-way which ran along an embankment on the eastern hillside. During this period, the small flag-stop was probably constructed to cater to Brackney's family and workers. Curiously, the location of Brackney was named \"San Lorenzo\" during this period, suggesting the hopeful establishment of a township in the area that never came to be.\n\nThe sharp turn at Brackney before heading around the bend toward Glen Arbor. A guard rail was apparently needed for trains that were not calling at Brackney. (Courtesy The Valley Press)\n\nBrackney never developed into anything more than a waypoint between Felton and Ben Lomond. A pair of bridges over the river was built in December 1897, according to the Mountain Echo, though the original bridges were placed at a much lower elevation in relation to the river. The current bridges were probably built in the 1930s, though the date boxes on the bridge were never filled in. The flag-stop itself didn't begin appearing on railroad timetables until this Southern Pacific Railroad began releasing more detailed internal timetables in the late 1910s or early 1920s. Of those timetables accessible to this author, the earliest mention of Brackney was on an August 19, 1923, timetable that placed Brackney 74.3 miles south of San Francisco via the Mayfield Cut-off. It also placed it 5.4 miles south of Boulder Creek and 0.4 miles north of Bonny Brae.\n\nA small shelter was established there similar in design to others along the route, namely those at Filbert and Newell Junction. As can be seen in the image above, the curve at Brackney was significant and required a guard rail for trains not calling at the flag-stop. The area was also much more barren than it is today, with a large field to the right of the tracks where today that area is completely overgrown. Telephone wires also followed the tracks on the river side, as can be seen above, and a cattle grate can also be seen on either side of the tracks, suggesting there were some domesticated animals in the area.\n\nThe junction where once stood Brackney flag-stop. The right-of-way continues to the left down the service road. The shelter once was just beyond the gate on the left. The right-of-way continues directly behind the photographer.\n\nBrackney went out of disuse following the closure of the Boulder Creek Branch in 1934 and the flag-stop was undoubtedly demolished. Today, the site of the flag-stop sits at the top of Brackney Road at a spilt in the road where a Santa Cruz Water District service road leads east away from the main road. A small clearing where the shelter once stood still remains, but little else does. This service road is the right-of-way and continued virtually undisturbed all the way to the Christmas Tree farm near Bonny Brae. Indeed, the top part of Brackney Road from this intersection to another service road gate located about 1/6 mile west constitutes a paved and repurposed portion of the right-of-way. It mostly follows a large hedge before the road turns toward State Route 9. From this other service gate, the right-of-way continues unobstructed until one reaches a private property built on the right-of-way near Glen Arbor. Unfortunately, all right-of-ways north of Glen Arbor are obscured by modern constructs, thus emphasizing the importance of those surviving passages in the Brackney area.\n\nCitations:\n\nClark, Donald Thomas, Santa Cruz County Place Names: A Geographic Dictionary (Scotts Valley, CA: Kestrel Press, 2008).\n\n↧\n\nRubottom's Spur\n\nRubottom—an entry in the most unfortunate surnames in America—had the added privilege of also lending its unusual family name to the Rubottom's Spur, located along the Southern Pacific Railroad's Boulder Creek Branch (formally the Felton & Pescadero Railroad) between Felton and Ben Lomond.\n\nE.J. Rubottom and Will Glass, two relatives\n\nand friends who journeyed together during\n\nthe Yukon Gold Rush. (From Ancestry.com)\n\nNamed after Emphrey Jones Rubottom, very little is known about the small spur located on the eastern side of the San Lorenzo River north of Glen Arbor. The man Rubottom was settled in the area according to F.A. Hihn records by at latest 1889 and was in partnership with John A. Rountree, who was a close half-relative. By 1890, Rubottom and Rountree were operating a shingle mill somewhere in the valley, though their earlier property was in Felton rather than the Glen Arbor area. Edward T. Rountree, in his commentary on Bruce MacGregor's South Pacific Coast, notes that Rubottom was a blacksmith and had invented a special type of plow (patented in 1904) that could be used to build roads. He also patented two random inventions related to brewing beer. Rubottom was also a member of the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors. According to Ancestry.com, he died in 1913 in San Luis Obispo, CA.\n\nAccording to the 1899 Station Book, Rubottom's Spur was found 2.1 miles north of Felton and 1.1 miles south of Newell Creek (Newell Junction). It hosted a class \"B\" freight station, meaning at least one freight siding, as well as a spur of indeterminate length heading presumably into E.J. Rubottom's property. No other services were noted at the site. Judging from the geography of the region, it is extremely likely that the spur line was on the west side of the tracks, since a continuous hillside dominates the east side.\n\nComparative data suggests that Rubottom's Spur may have been located at Brackney, prior to the development of that area by the Brackney family at the turn of the century. This theory, though, presents problems, namely that Alonzo Brackney appears to have settled in the area at approximately the same time. Alternatively, Rubottom's Spur may have been located at the extreme southern end of the Glen Arbor area above the bend in the river where today a disjointed housing community thrives. As one final possibility, though less likely, the spur may have crossed the river just north of Brackney and settled within the western loop of the San Lorenzo River. In any case, the absolute location of the site seems to have been lost. According to Donald Clark, only a single atlas pointed to the site, Crams Superior Reference Atlas of California, Nevada and the World (George Franklin Cram: Chicago, 1908). This book is not currently available to this author, though a copy resides in the UC Santa Cruz collection.\n\nCitations:\n\nClark, Donald Thomas. Santa Cruz Place Names: A Geographical Dictionary.

Located on the north-east corner of the intersection of Glen Arbor Road and Lorenzo Way, the Glen Arbor Station probably existed between August 1914 and January 1934, though service may have been discontinued to the site prior to the closure of the branch line. The name Glen Arbor is a creation of the subdivision developers who thought to describe the place as \"a shady place among the trees.\"\n\nGlen Arbor Station during the late 1910s looking toward the north-east.\n\nDespite its current notoriety, Glen Arbor was a late addition to the railroad's timetables. In fact, of those railroad timetables available to this author, Glen Arbor as a spur does not appear until August 19, 1923 in an internal Southern Pacific timetable. On that timetable, Glen Arbor is listed as being located 74.7 miles south of San Francisco via the Mayfield Cut-off, 5 mile south of Boulder Creek, and 1.2 miles south of Newell Junction. It's nearest neighbor was Brackney, located only 0.4 miles to the south. Glen Arbor appears again, this time as a stop but not a spur, in the early 1930s as the third of five formal stations on the Boulder Creek Branch. Regrettably, no further information is mentioned on this public timetable and even the dating information for it is incorrect.\n\nGlen Arbor Station hosting a passenger train, as viewed from the Coffee resident that looked directly west down Glen Arbor Drive, late 1910s (Courtesy Bruce MacGregor)\n\nThe railroad passed peacefully through the area between Rubottom's Spur and the Newell Creek Mill Junction according to the 1899 Station Book. The term \"Glen Arbor\" first appears in available public documents in 1912 in deeds issued by the F.A. Hihn Company, though word usage in those deeds suggests the subdivision was already in existence by that date. Donald Clark mentions that on August 12, 1914, a post office was established at the site, probably signaling the start of formal rail service to the area. That post office lasted barely more than a year, closing on November 30, 1915, but the station itself remained in use. As can be discerned from the two photographs above, Glen Arbor had an unusually large, though simple, station. It consisted of a plain square house-like structure with a tall peaked roof with slowly descending awnings. An extended second story allowed room for a covered porch on the track side.\n\nSite of Glen Arbor Station today. (Courtesy Google Street View)\n\nSadly, today nothing at all remains of the Glen Arbor Station or really even its right-of-way. A modern home has been built on the site of the station, located just off of Fremont Avenue and facing the opposite direction. The right-of-way through the Glen Arbor area begins above the southernmost part of Fremont Avenue and continues north through and beside private properties until crossing Glen Arbor Road at Schaaf Road, which is actually a driveway. The right-of-way then crosses the road and parallels the impassible Lorenzo Way before turning again into private properties. Interestingly, in the area near the station site, the right-of-way remains overgrown with hedges and and sits on a narrow stretch of unused land. After Lorenzo Way decisively ends about half a mile north of its crossing with Glen Arbor Road, the right-of-way makes its way back to Glen Arbor just north of its junction with Larita Drive. At this point, the right-of-way closely parallels Glen Arbor Road on the western side all the way to Love Creek.\n\nConcerning the spur line that existed at Glen Arbor, it likely became present-day Lorenzo Way for a while longer before terminating a short distance away. Other spur lines may also have been in the area, catering to local farms and related industries. The history of this area is still being researched.\n\nCitations:\n\nSouthern Pacific System: List of Officers, Agencies and Stations, 1899.\n\nClark, Donald Thomas, Santa Cruz County Place Names: A Geographic Dictionary (Scotts Valley, CA: Kestrel Press, 2008).\n\n↧\n\nNewell Junction Spur & Flag-Stop\n\nMap showing Shingle Springs & Newell Junction at the base\n\nof Newell Creek near Ben Lomond. (Courtesy Duncan Nanney)\n\nNewell Creek was named after a man from Maine named Addison Newell who established a small farm alongside the creek that later bore his name in 1867. Newell sold his ranch, which sat immediately beside the San Lorenzo Valley Flume & Transportation Company flume, in January 1875, nine years before the railroad would pass beside his property. A possible relative, F.W. Newell, was also settled alongside the creek during this time and may have stayed in the area. Addison died in 1892 and likely did not benefit from the flag-stop that later bore his name.\n\nWhen the South Pacific Coast Railroad first arrived at Newell Creek in late 1884, it established a flag-stop and a short siding at the site and named it Shingle Springs, likely for shingle mills found further up the valley. These lands may well have been owned by the Dougherty brothers and their Santa Clara Valley Mill & Lumber Company, but no significant logging operations occurred up Newell Creek during this period. When the Southern Pacific Railroad leased the South Pacific Coast in 1887, it probably changed the name to Newell Creek by 1888 to avoid confusion with another stop named Shingle Springs along the Northern Railway, which was consolidated in that year. A similar precedent in 1887 had forced Arcadia to be renamed Tuxedo along the Mountain Division to avoid confusion on the timetables. The 1899 Station Book mentions the site, stating that the flag-stop for Newell Creek was 76.6 miles south of San Francisco via Alameda Point. The only other note regarding the stop is that it had a class-B freight station, meaning that at least one siding was at the stop.\n\nIn 1904, Timothy Hopkins and A.C. Bassett's California Timber Company, incorporated the previous year from the consolidation of the Santa Clara Valley Mill & Lumber Company and Big Basin Lumber Company holdings, began operations at Newell Creek, changing the name of the flag-stop at the base of the grade to Newell Junction. Using old and new equipment, the CTC built their mill 1 1/2 miles north of the junction with the Southern Pacific line. The operations there picked up fast and up to 75,000 board feet of lumber were shipped daily during peak times. Hopkins and Bassett used their connections with Southern Pacific to convert the short siding into a full spur to the mill and beyond.\n\nLumbermen waiting on a narrow gauge flatcar for a pickup from the engine. (Courtesy Rick Hamman)\n\nThrough this, the CTC built the last industry-use narrow-gauge railroad built in the Santa Cruz Mountains, even while the main line was being broad gauged. A special switching yard was built at the mill site, which currently sits near and under the base of the Loch Lomond dam, to allow the transfer of materials from narrow- to broad-gauged cars. The right-of-way to the branch-line tracks at Newell Junction were triple railed to accommodate the gauge of the main line tracks while not abandoning the narrow gauge tracks. The railroad that ran along the spur track became known as the Newell Creek Railroad, though in reality most of the equipment was Southern Pacific Company rolling stock. North of the mill site, the narrow-gauge continued two miles into the forests of a canyon that today is Loch Lomond. For the first year, the engine Felton, popularly known as \"Dinky\", operated in Newell Creek.\n\nCalifornia Timber Company Mill alongside Newell Creek. (Courtesy Bruce MacGregor)\n\nFire struck the mill near the end of its initial season in 1905, destroying much of what was not shipped, though the logs in the mill pond were saved. Everything was rebuilt the following year and a new narrow-gauge engine was purchased just for the mill and christened Kitty. For the next eight years, the mill would log off the great redwood wealth of the Newell Creek canyon with increasing yields each year.\n\nKitty sitting on a triple-railed track in the Newell Creek property.

(Courtesy The Valley Press)\n\nThe mill itself remained in operation until 1913, though the flag-stop remained as a passenger stop until the line was discontinued in January 1934. The flag-stop that was built there was identical to the one built at Brackney. It consisted of a single wall with an open divider which spanned down the center of the structure. Wooden benches lined the wall and both sides of this center divider. A square low-peaked roof hung above the structure with a sign—\"Newell Jct.\"—mounted on it facing toward the tracks. The structure likely survived until 1937 or later. After the train was discontinued, the tracks to Newell Creek remained until the entire line was pulled in 1937. The remnant spur was popularly—and at least in one source officially—named the Old Newell Creek Branch Railroad. Newell Creek Road probably developed alongside the railroad right-of-way prior to the tracks' removal, though it is also possible that the road replaced the tracks directly.\n\nAn August 19, 1923, internal Southern Pacific timetable includes Newell Junction in its lists of stops along the branch line. Newell Junction is noted as being 75.9 miles south of San Francisco via the Mayfield Cut-Off and is noted as a spur junction still, despite the spur no longer being in use. It is also noted as being 3.8 miles south of Boulder Creek, 1.2 miles north of Glen Arbor, and 0.4 miles southeast of Ben Lomond. In addition, a Southern Pacific route map of the area from October 1922 includes Newell Junction. No other timetables in this collection currently note the site.\n\nImage of Newell Junction Flag-Stop Site.

For the first two decades of its life as a community, the area was deforested to such a point that little remained except that which was planted by visitors and residents. The town itself began its long life as Pacific Mills.\n\nNamed after the Pacific Manufacturing Company mill that was situation on the banks of the San Lorenzo River near modern-day Mill Street, the mill opened in 1879 and operated the first band saw in California at that site. The town developed quickly around this lumber mill, with hotels, saloons, and whorehouses dominating the flat beside the river. The owner of the company, James Pieronnet Pierce, was a railroader and carpenter, and he owned the Pacific Avenue Railroad Company, a streetcar company, in Santa Cruz from 1877. His primary facilities were in Santa Clara where he manufactured coffins and architectural elements such as windows and doors.\n\nPacific Manufacturing Company factory in Santa Clara, circa 1910s.\n\nOriginal town layout proposal, circa 1888, after Pacific Mills had left.\n\nBen Lomond Station, circa 1890s.

When through service to Ben Lomond was begun the next year, Pacific Mills made the timetable. It was a waypoint between Felton and Boulder Creek, located almost precisely midway between the two. In 1887, the same year that the SPCRR was leased to the Southern Pacific Railroad, Pacific Mills petitioned the United States Post Office to bring an agency to the town. The name \"Pacific Mills\" was declined due to the plethora of places with either or both of the names already in existence. Eventually, the name Ben Lomond was chosen, in recognition of the large mountain chain that separated the town from the Pacific Ocean. Over the course of the succeeding months, the Pacific Mills facility was dismantled or converted into commercial and residential buildings.\n\nPostcard showing Ben Lomond Station and Depot, circa 1890s. The San Lorenzo River is to the right.\n\nAs an aside, the name \"Ben Lomond\" is of Scottish origin and similar names appear throughout this area of the San Lorenzo Valley without any obvious reason. John Burns is the one responsible for the naming. It is said that he named the mountain range the Ben Lomond Mountains while working for a lumber company on San Vicente Creek near Davenport. A few years later, he purchased a large track of land atop the ridge and thereby founded Bonny Doon as well. Burns lived the remainder of his life on the mountain, managing a vineyard and a cattle ranch. Some of his descendants still live in the area today.\n\nPostcard of the right-of-way crossing Main Street, facing east, circa 1890s.\n\nPostcards of Hotel Rowardennan.\n\nJames Pierce remained in the area and founded the Hotel Ben Lomond, a large hotel that was soon after joined by the Hotel Rowardennan. Within two more years, the remaining lumber companies located in the town had pulled out, and Ben Lomond began its quite transition into a Victorian resort. In addition to a fairly standard station building built in the center of town, there were numerous freight spurs that continued to run to various points around the town. Most of these were probably removed by 1890, although some may have remained to support an inter-valley streetcar business that existed along the Southern Pacific right-of-way for some time using McKeen Motor Cars. The streetcars were used for a short time around 1910 but the steep grades required at points to ascend the valley between Felton and Boulder Creek proved too much for the streetcars, which were designed for flatter grounds. Additionally, a fatal accident in June 1910 which killed a mother and injured children brought great shame to the company, accelerating their demise.\n\nPostcard of the streetcar parked beside the Ben Lomond Station, circa 1910.

Although none exist in this collection, it can be supposed that Ben Lomond first appeared in timetables under that name beginning at some point in 1887. It retained that name until the route's closure in 1934. An 1889 timetable notes it as being 77 miles south of San Francisco via Alameda Point and Felton Junction. The 1899 Station Book places Ben Lomond between Newell Creek and Steens Spur, 77 miles south of San Francisco. It had a telegraph office and both a freight and passenger agency on site. It's freight station was a class-A station, meaning it had multiple sidings and spurs for freight loads, as well as facilities for freight loading. It's freight platform was on the south side of the tracks, though that is irrelevant since sidings surrounded the station. A 1908 timetable adds that it was 11 miles north of Santa Cruz Junction. It seems that Ben Lomond was dropped from some public timetables in the 1910s and possibly later, despite the town only growing during this period. A 1923 internal timetable notes it as being 76.3 miles south of San Francisco via the Mayfield Cut-Off and Felton Junction. Furthermore, it was 3.4 miles south of Boulder Creek, 0.4 miles north of Newell Junction, and 1 mile south of Phillipshurst. It remained on virtually all timetables as one of the principle five stops in the mountains alongside Felton, Glen Arbor, Brookdale, and Boulder Creek.\n\nMen and a carriage outside the Ben Lomond Station, circa 1890s. (Courtesy Bruce MacGregor)\n\nThe railroad station and its right-of-way through Ben Lomond were finally abandoned by the Southern Pacific Company in January 1934. Town planners immediately began looking at the right-of-way to build a new, modern highway through the town. Yet almost as immediately, they decided against annexing the railroad right-of-way and instead carved a roughly parallel path"
