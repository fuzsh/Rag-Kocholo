Then Santa Cruz, California is a great car free getaway choice for your summer vacation. It’s also a good choice for visitors who don’t want to drive: the Pacific Coast Highway can get quite congested. If you leave your car at home (or at your hotel), the local bus system can get you nearly anywhere in Santa Cruz County that you want to go. If you like state parks, you can visit several of these using public transportation.\n\nSay goodbye to your car (at least for this trip), and join me on a Car Free Journey to Santa Cruz.\n\nSanta Cruz, California\n\nWhat’s Special about Santa Cruz?\n\nSanta Cruz is known for the beauty of its beaches along the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.

Santa Cruz has a culture of active living: 9.9% of people walk to work, 9.5% bicycle, and 5.4% take public transit.\n\nIn Santa Cruz, you can travel from the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary to the Redwoods without a car. Spend your morning mountain biking on one of the many great trails. End your afternoon strolling along West Cliff Drive..\n\nA great way to access transportation options in Santa Cruz is to visit www.Cruz511.org.\n\nGetting Here\n\nGreyhound’s Santa Cruz bus terminal is located at the Pacific Avenue Metro Terminal: the hub of the Santa Cruz Metro bus system.

In 2013, the U.S.Census Bureau estimated Santa Cruz’s population at 62,864. Santa Cruz is a center of the organic agriculture movement, and headquarters of California Certified Organic Farmers.\n\nSanta Cruz is also known for its social activism and support of women’s issues. The Resource Center for Nonviolence, founded in 1976, is one of the oldest and most centrally located non-profit organizations committed to political and social activism in Santa Cruz County. In 1998, the Santa Cruz community declared itself a Nuclear-free zone. In 1992, local residents approved Measure A: allowing marijuana to be used for medicinal uses.\n\nNotable feminist activists Nikki Craft and Ann Simonton, both Santa Cruz residents, formed the “Praying Mantis Brigade”. This collection of activists organized the “Myth California Pageant” in the 1980s protesting “the objectification of women and the glorification of the beauty myth.” Simonton also founded and still coordinates the non-profit group “Media Watch” which monitors and critiques media images of women and ethnic minorities.\n\nA Great Place for a Vacation\n\nSanta Cruz has 11 world-class surf breaks, including the point breaks over rock bottoms near Steamer Lane and Pleasure Point, which create some of the best surfing waves in the world. The Santa Cruz Surfing Museum is staffed by docents from the Santa Cruz Surfing Club who have surfed Santa Cruz waves since the 1930s. The Santa Cruz Wharf is known for fishing, viewing marine mammals and other recreation.\n\nLocal parks offer many opportunities for birding and butterfly watching, as well as outdoor sports such as skateboarding, cycling, camping, hiking, and rock climbing. Santa Cruz Skate Park is free and open to the public seven days a week.\n\nExplore downtown Santa Cruz. In addition to its storefronts and businesses, downtown is the place to enjoy performances by street performers, musicians, and artists. Pacific Avenue is a center for Santa Cruz’ artistic and cultural scene.\n\nNo visit to Santa Cruz is complete without a visit to the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. The Boardwalk, California’s oldest amusement park (it celebrated its Centennial in 2007) is a designated State Historic Landmark. It is the home of to the iconic Giant Dipper roller coaster, which is currently the fifth oldest coaster in the United States (opening in 1924), and the Charles I. D. Looff Carousel that opened in 1911.\n\nIf you are a rail fan, enjoy an excursion on the Santa Cruz, Big Trees and Pacific Railway’s diesel-electric tourist trains between the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk and Roaring Camp in nearby Felton.

She offers these tips: “West Cliff Drive is one of my favorite places to go in Santa Cruz. Of course, you have the popular Boardwalk and wharf to check out, but there is so much more to this road! West Cliff Dr. has a wonderful and scenic walking and bike path that stretches a little over 2.5 mi. long. The path sits on top of bluffs overlooking the Monterey Bay. There are many benches and stopping points along the path where you can often see marine wildlife such as sea otters, sea lions, dolphins, and whales. Check out the Santa Cruz Surfing Museum at Lighthouse Point Park and visit one of my favorite beaches in town at Natural Bridge’s state Beach.” (If you love this area and want to stay close by, check out the West Cliff Inn, located right on West Cliff Drive: www.westcliffinn.com or call (831)457-2200.)\n\nEmily Glanville, Program Specialist at the Sustainable Transportation Group’s Ecology Action, tells us that some of her favorite walks are in three State Parks (all can be reached by METRO—see above for details).: Wilder Ranch State Park, Nisene Marks State Park, and Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park.

The Downtown and beach are within walking distance, as are the Levee Paths along the San Lorenzo River and the Seabright neighborhood. A short bike ride will get you to the Westside’s breweries, wineries, bakeries and restaurants, food or a concert in Midtown, or to Pleasure Point, a famous surf spot with a scenic ocean-view biking and walking path.\n\n“Be warned though – bike theft is common in Santa Cruz. Keep bikes in a safe place overnight, and use a sturdy U-lock instead of a cable lock, which is easy to snip.”\n\n“Santa Cruz is home to some great bike paths, notably on West Cliff and East Cliff Drive, along the San Lorenzo River and to Wilder Ranch State Park. You can also rent a mountain bike and enjoy Santa Cruz’s world-class trails. Don’t miss the Emma McCrary Trail in the Pogonip Forest and the bluff trails at Wilder Ranch. Be sure to download a copy of the Santa Cruz County bike map at: http://www.sccrtc.org/services/bike.”\n\nThe following bike shops provide bike rentals:\n\nPacific Avenue Cycles (closest to downtown, maybe a 5 minute walk from downtown towards the Boardwalk and SC Wharf area)\n\nBicycle Trip at 1001 Soquel Ave (midtown)\n\nFamily Cycling Center at 914 41st Ave—on Eastside of town near Pleasure Point and East Cliff Drive\n\nEpicenter Cycling at 1730 Mission St and Another Bike Shop at 2361 Mission St (both on the Westside of Santa Cruz near the University\n\nEmily Glanville shares these tips for mountain bikers and bicyclists who want in town biking (even though she says these are primarily for commuting, visiting bicyclists can also enjoy many of these rides):\n\nFor Mountain Bikers: “There are many legal, mountain biking trails and options for those looking for an off road cycling adventure. There are trails in the following locations: Big Basin State Park, Castle Rock State Park, DeLaveaga Park, Henry Cowell State Park, Pogonip Park, Soquel Demonstration State Forest, The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park, UCSC upper campus, and Wilder Ranch State Park. You can find details on the Mountain Bikers of Santa Cruz County website: http://www.mbosc.org/local-parks.”\n\nAround Town Bike Commuting: Glanville’s favorite in-town trails to bike on while commuting to work or across town on an errand include the Arana Gulch Multi-Use Trail that is located in a greenspace on the north end of the Santa Cruz harbor. As well as West Cliff path which follows the cliffs with a multi-use path from just above the Santa Cruz Wharf all the way to Natural Bridges State Beach and East Cliff path. The East Cliff path follows the cliffs from 30th Ave to Pleasure Point area at 41st. From there, it is an easy neighborhood bike ride to Capitola Village.\n\nClaire Fleisler: a Transportation Planner for the City of Santa Cruz, tells us, “The Santa Cruz County Cycling Club (http://www.santacruzcycling.org/content.aspx?page_id=0&club_id=575722) leads group rides several times per week. Check out their website prior to arrival to find a ride that would work for you.\n\n“I would recommend cycling West Cliff Drive, a 2.5 mile multiuse path along the ocean. West Cliff passes the Santa Cruz lighthouse, world renowned surfing locations, beautiful open space at Lighthouse Field and Natural Bridges and interesting architecture of the surrounding homes.\n\n“Another good ride is along the San Lorenzo Riverway, a 5-mile multi-use path. This facility is a north-south spine and a completely separated facility. This path travels along the San Lorenzo River, past San Lorenzo Park (playground, duck pond, lawn bowling), the Boardwalk, and along downtown. This path has easy access to neighborhoods.”\n\nAre You Hungry?\n\nThe Santa Cruz Convention and Visitors Council suggests the following downtown restaurants:\n\nLaili Restaurant: lailirestaurant.com\n\nAssembly Restaurant – assembleforfood.com\n\nThe Penny Ice Creamery – thepennyicecreamery.com\n\nSoif Wine Bar & Restaurant – soifwine.com\n\nHula’s Island Grill & Tiki Room – hulastiki.com\n\nEmily Glanville’s favorite places to eat include:\n\nThe Picnic Basket: thepicnicbasketsc.com/, on Beach St near the Santa Cruz Wharf and Beach Boardwalk.

Be careful, as there are no sidewalks here. After approximately two blocks, you will see the entrance to Roaring Camp on the right. As you walk over a covered bridge, you will see several small shops as you enter the town (a re-creation of a 1880s town).
