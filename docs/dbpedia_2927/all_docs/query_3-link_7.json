        "text": "National Register #73000451\n\nFelton Covered Bridge\n\nCovered Bridge Road and Graham Hill Road\n\nFelton\n\nBuilt 1892\n\nThe Felton Covered Bridge is one of eleven covered bridges in California. Standing thirty-five feet high, it the tallest covered span in the United States. Because of its architectural rarity, it was recognized as California Historical Landmark #583 in July of 1969.\n\nFor forty-six years, the Felton Covered Bridge was the main wagon bridge for the transport of freight between the San Lorenzo Valley and the outside world.\n\nIn 1938, the bridge was destined for destruction and replacement by a new iron structure. The citizens of Felton protested in support of its preservation and the bridge was saved. The iron structure was placed farther down the San Lorenzo River and the Felton bridge was retired from use.\n\nThis action is said to be the first western example of preserving bypassed bridges. Although this was common in the East, the preservation of the Felton Bridge was a precedent for the western United States.\n\nToday, the bridge is used only for foot traffic.\n\nAdapted from the NRHP nomination submitted in 1973.\n\nHistoric Covered Bridges in California\n\nBridgeport\n\nCalifornia Powder Works Bridge\n\nFelton\n\nGlen Canyon\n\nHoney Run\n\nKnights Ferry\n\nOregon Creek\n\nWawona\n\nZane's Ranch\n\nHistoric Covered Bridges in Oregon\n\nAntelope Creek\n\nGrave Creek\n\nHorse Creek\n\nLittle Butte Creek\n\nLost Creek"
