        "text": "Public access to the San Lorenzo River’s riparian corridor between the mountain towns of Felton and Boulder Creek is limited, but several spots are worth a look. In Felton check the area near Felton Covered Bridge Park (off Graham Hill Rd at the junction with Mt Hermon Rd). Hwy 9 leads to several areas farther upstream. Near Ben Lomond, Highlands County Park (2.1 miles north of Felton) offers a broad stretch of river frontage. In Ben Lomond itself check Mill Street Park (best from fall through early May, when the river is not dammed to form a swimming hole). In Boulder Creek, Irwin Way (intersecting Hwy 9 at 0.7 mile north of Brookdale or 2.4 miles from Ben Lomond) parallels the east side of the river for much of its 1.3 miles to Boulder Creek. Birds at these sites are much the same as described for riverside areas in Henry Cowell, and may include Wood Duck, Common and Hooded mergansers, American Dipper and Yellow Warbler (still nests at Felton Covered Bridge Park). Watch for Evening Grosbeak in winter.\n\nThis popular Felton attraction has train rides and a variety of special activities for families, but it also offers some good birding if one avoids the busy weekends and mid-day hours. A fee is charged at the main entrance on Graham Hill Rd 0.7 mile east of Hwy 9, but you may walk in for free from the main parking lot at Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park (provided you paid the day use fee there or hold an annual permit). Birding Roaring Camp combines nicely with birding at Henry Cowell. Check the ponds (near the covered bridge and behind the picnic tables) for Green Heron, Hooded Merganser, and other ducks. The surrounding forest has Pileated Woodpecker, Pygmy Nuthatch, and Brown Creeper. Wintering sparrow flocks here may have a White-throated Sparrow. An adjacent area with different habitat is along Graham Hill Rd 0.7 mile east from the entrance to Roaring Camp. Park in wide pullouts on the right (south) side, across from Ponderosa Lodge, and explore the network of unmarked trails leading south through forest of ponderosa and knobcone pines, live oaks and chaparral. This area has Pileated Woodpecker, Wrentit, California Thrasher, Pygmy Nuthatch, and nesting Black-throated Gray Warbler.\n\nThese two roads are along Hwy 9, 1.4 and 2.2 miles north of Hwy 236 at Boulder Creek, respectively. They are birdy, but have been scarcely birded. Each first passes through an area with a number of residences, but dwellings soon thin out, and both these roads eventually become well-maintained, unpaved roads bordered by natural habitat. Both roads offer access to mixed evergreen forest, redwood forest, oak woodland, and deciduous riparian forest, with the variety of species typical of such habitats. A shrewd combination of parking and walking seems most promising here. American Dipper and Common Merganser occur along Kings Creek. The section of Kings Creek Rd beginning just past the first bridge offers especially pleasant birding.\n\nA little bit of this 1,946-acre parkland, managed by the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District, lies within Santa Cruz County; the rest is in San Mateo County. Located north of Castle Rock State Park, the preserve has extensive montane grasslands at elevations to nearly 2,700 feet. There are spring wildflower displays and breathtaking views from the skyline to the sea, as well as canyon live oak and mixed evergreen forest and a small pond. Long Ridge has received surprisingly little birding coverage, but surely there are rewards in store here. Nesting species include Chipping Sparrow and Lazuli Bunting at grassland margins, and Cassin’s Vireo, Yellow-rumped and Black-throated Gray warblers, and Western Tanager in the forest. White-breasted nuthatch, rare in Santa Cruz County, has been observed here. Access to Santa Cruz County’s portion is along Skyline Blvd (Hwy 35) at the Hickory Oaks Trail head, 1.4 mile northwest of Hwy 9. Look for the trailhead and a small sign. A trail map is posted a short ways into the preserve.\n\nThis narrow 3.6-mile road runs from Scotts Valley Dr to Glenwood Rd, through redwood forest, mixed evergreen forest, oak woodland and deciduous riparian forest. It invites birding by driving and stopping to explore near the car, as well as longer strolls. From Hwy 17, take the Mt Hermon Rd exit and go west for about half a mile to Scotts Valley Drive. Turn right (north) and then left at the first signal onto Bean Creek Rd. Reset your odometer to 0.0 at the beginning of Bean Creek Rd. We suggest stops at 1.2, 1.6, 2.0, 2.3, and 2.7 to 2.9 miles from Scotts Valley Dr. The area is good for a variety of woodland and forest birds, including many Varied Thrushes in winter, and Western Screech-Owl and Northern Saw-whet Owl year round. Combine birding this road with a trip up Mountain Charlie Rd (described above), as the two sites lie a mere 0.9 mile apart along Glenwood Rd.\n\nFrom an urban area of Soquel, this 5.8 mile road runs north up a valley through rural residential development, grassland, and oak woodland, and then climbs to a ridge and into extensive forest and oak woodland with some chaparral. These habitats support a nice diversity of birds. Birding is best on weekend mornings, when traffic is light, or after commuting hours on weekdays. At all times watch out for cars. Fine panoramic views from the upper portion of the road reward the explorer. From Hwy 1 take the 41stAve exit and go north 0.3 mile to Soquel Dr. Turn left (west) on Soquel Dr and go 0.3 mile, then turn right (north) on Rodeo Gulch Rd. Reset your odometer to 0.0 here. There are few safe stops until you have gone about a mile. From there, use likely pullouts and bird from the roadside. Productive places are at 1.4, 2.0, 2.8, 3.7, 4.5 to 5.0, 5.3, and 5.7 miles. The coast live oak woodland from 4.3 to 5.3 provides fine birding in all seasons, and especially during spring migration. Fruiting madrone and toyon attract thrushes in late fall and winter. Black-throated Gray Warbler nests in interior live oaks near the upper end of the road, and Red-breasted Sapsucker is found in winter near the creek along the lower half of the road.\n\nThis quiet two-mile road, also signed as “Woodwardia Hwy,” connects Hwy 17 to Summit Rd, passing through redwood and mixed evergreen forest. It offers a nice chance for an extended walk, or one could park here and there and bird near the car. This area harbors many breeding birds, and it is birdy, as well, in late fall and winter. From Hwy 1 go north on Hwy 17 for 12.5 miles and turn right at the little sign for Woodwardia Hwy shortly before reaching the summit. Or from the summit on Hwy 17, go 1.1 miles southeast on Summit Rd and turn right on Old Santa Cruz Hwy.\n\nThis seldom-birded forest road passes through the Forest of Nisene Marks State Park (described above) and private land. Without a current map in hand, one can scarcely tell one property from the other, so discreet birders will remain on the road itself. The road is unpaved but generally in good shape for its whole length, but is muddy and should be avoided (except on foot) in the winter or anytime after rains. This is a very good route for breeding birds in spring and early summer and can be birdy in mid-autumn, too. Begin at the junction of Buzzard Lagoon Rd with Eureka Canyon Rd and Highland Way, 8.8 miles up Eureka Canyon Rd from Corralitos. Drive and park to explore along the road. After 1.0 mile Aptos Creek Fire Rd joins on the right. It leads into the main part of the Forest of Nisene Marks. Birding along Buzzard Lagoon Rd is best in areas of mixed evergreen forest and live oak woodland. Look for nesting Western Tanager, Black-throated Gray Warbler, Northern Pygmy-Owl, Hermit Thrush, and Pileated Woodpecker. Purple Martin has nested near the road and might be seen from May to July. The downhill end of Buzzard Lagoon Rd connects to Rider Rd, which goes left back to Eureka Canyon Rd 2.1 miles north of Corralitos. Rider Rd itself offers birding opportunities, especially uphill from its junction with Buzzard Lagoon Rd.\n\nThe Land Trust of Santa Cruz County owns and manages this 322-acre property north of Corralitos. Call land manager Jeff Helmer at (831) 724-5357 to arrange to visit the property. The Byrne Forest offers redwood forest, oak woodland, and scrub habitats, and it is birdy all year long. The redwood forest includes areas of second growth that are being managed to develop old-growth forest characteristics. Pileated Woodpecker occurs here, and Varied Thrush is often common in winter. A network of unsigned dirt roads and trails allows birding access on foot, some of it on moderate slopes. From Hwy 1 take Freedom Blvd east (inland). Go 4.9 miles and turn left on Corralitos Rd. Go 1.7 miles more to Corralitos and turn right on Browns Valley Rd. Follow Browns Valley Rd for 2.8 miles, then turn left at a sign for “Roses of Yesterday and Today Nursery.” Drive in past the nursery parking area and continue slowly straight ahead on a narrow, winding road marked “private drive.” Go for 0.8 mile and park in the Byrne Forest’s visitor lot on the right. A dirt road trail begins near the west side of the lot (check for a trail map in the small box near the trailhead), and leads to other trails. Bird along the entrance road, too, and along the road past the manager’s residence. In winter check the acacias near the residence for sapsuckers."
