        "text": "The Felton Covered Bridge, historically the primary entrance to the community of Felton, continues to stand adjacent to a city park bearing its name. The bridge spanning the San Lorenzo River is, at 35 feet tall, believed to be the tallest covered bridge in the country and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Though it has been closed to vehicle traffic for since the 1930s, it remains open for pedestrians to use. At the base of the bridge's western side is a California historical plaque describing the bridge's construction in the late 1800s and use.\n\nFelton Covered Bridge Park is a spacious park with picnic tables, playground, and large grass lawn. At the park's entrance is an information kiosk with pictures of a brief written history of the bridge, including cycles of storm damage to the bridge and community efforts and fundraising to repair and ultimately ensure preservation of the bridge. The kiosk lists several Hollywood movies that were filmed in part at the bridge. Park hours are 7 a.m. until sunset daily."
