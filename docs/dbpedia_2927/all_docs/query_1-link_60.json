        "text": "Santa Cruz County is well known for its abundance of artistic talent of all kinds. And in the mountains in the north of the county, nestled amongst the scenic redwoods of the San Lorenzo Valley, lies a wealth of creativity that now lies open for you to explore.\n\nDuring one weekend in May each year, you will have the opportunity to see for yourself the great array of artistry that will be on display during the 3rd annual SLV Art Tour with dozens of artists opening their studios to the public. Painters, fiber artists, ceramicists, woodworkers, photographers, glass artists and more will welcome guests into their studios. Many artists will be demonstrating their processes.\n\nThere is so much to see and do in the San Lorenzo Valley. Redwoods, wineries, babbling brooks, cycling trails, hiking trails, state and county parks, local museums all are situated near the San Lorenzo River. Once home to a bustling logging industry, the mountains now feature first and second-growth redwood trees. Henry Cowell State Park, one of the most visited state parks in California, and Fall Creek are located in Felton along with the Felton Covered Bridge, which spans 80 feet is considered to be the tallest covered bridge in the United States."
