        "text": "The Bridges\n\nNow check out three significant bridges right in town. Drive to each stop, ride a bike (you can rent a bicycle at Rainy Day Cycles) or enjoy the long walk.\n\nCentennial Covered Bridge\n\nAt the west end of Main Street in a little park is the pedestrian Centennial Covered Bridge built from the reclaimed lumber from two other historic covered bridges that were demolished. This bridge was built in Cottage Grove to commemorate the town's one hundred years. It is especially pretty in spring with flowers blooming around it, and in fall when the trees are colorful.\n\nJ. Polk Currin Swinging Bridge\n\nTurn left and follow South River Road. First, you will encounter the historic Dr. Snapp House built in 1886 for one of Cottage Grove’s first physicians. The Queen Anne-style house is used as an education center and is occasionally open to the public for special events.\n\nContinue on to J. Polk Currin Swinging Bridge. This suspension bridge was first built in 1965 and named for its original back-and-forth swinging motion. It has been rebuilt many times since and it was most recently restored to safe and useable condition in 2019. While it no longer \"swings\" it is still a delightful bridge to cross over the Coast Fork of the Willamette River.\n\nChambers Railroad Covered Bridge\n\nContinue following the river and South River Road until you reach Chambers Railroad Covered Bridge. This is thought to be one of eight remaining railroad-covered bridges in the nation, which is fitting because Buster Keaton filmed the train-action-packed \"The General\" movie here in Cottage Grove; and some railroad scenes from \"Stand By Me\" were also shot nearby.\n\nOriginally built in 1925, it was expertly restored in 2011 with beautifully installed public art and interpretive panels. Walk through it and look up—it is the tallest railroad-covered bridge in existence today."
