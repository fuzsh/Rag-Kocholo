        "text": "FELTON — The Central Coast and Bay Area awoke early Friday to a bit of a letup from the thrashing handed out by the first wave of the latest atmospheric river storm. With another one looming, Gov. Gavin Newsom did not wait.\n\nNewsom early Friday asked for a Presidential Emergency Declaration to authorize federal assistance for state and local response teams. Newsom proclaimed a state of emergency on Thursday in 21 of the state’s counties, including Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, San Mateo, San Francisco and Napa counties.\n\nA vast majority of the storm’s rain fell Thursday night and by Friday morning, freeways and main arteries to some Bay Area towns were flooded. The next atmospheric river is expected to arrive in Central California and the Bay Area early next week, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nStatewide, California Office of Emergency Services Director Nancy Ward said the agency has been challenged because of the weather. The state has opened fifteen shelters in nine counties and issued more than 9,400 evacuation orders. Two people statewide have died in the storms, she said.\n\nAt noon Friday, the National Weather Service recorded 24-hour Bay Area rainfall totals of more than 5½ inches in Ben Lomond in the Santa Cruz Mountains, 4½ in Kentfield in Marin County; 3¾ in Richmond in Contra Costa County; 2¼ in downtown Oakland and 1¾ in Castro Valley. San Jose showed an inch of rain.\n\nVirginia Wright was relieved as she and her dog, Sobaka, went for a walk on the muddy streets in her neighborhood near the San Lorenzo River and Covered Bridge in the Santa Cruz Mountains town of Felton.\n\nLike many Felton residents who live near the river, they spent the night anxiously eyeing the river gauges online, hoping to be spared the worst. County authorities had urged residents in her neighborhood to evacuate after four floods in December and January.\n\nEvidence of those floods is everywhere in Wright’s neighborhood, where waist-high piles of mud line the streets, waiting to be scooped up by county maintenance crews. The wheels of bureaucracy turn slow, and approval for the mud removal residents pay for just went through, Wright said, and they expect the crews to come Monday.\n\nOn Friday, residents caught a break when the waters crested at 4:30 a.m. at 20.3 feet, moderate flood stage and shy of the major flood stage of 21.76 feet. By 6:30 a.m. it had subsided to 18.44 feet.\n\n“I was up all night watching the river gauge,” Wright, 63, said. “I just am amazed that we didn’t get a big flood like last time. We didn’t get water in the garage. I’m just really really really grateful that we didn’t have all the mud. The mud is sticky and stinky and not very fun to deal with.”\n\nJason Dietz, 48, was hosing muddy water out of the concrete garage below the living quarters of his Felton home on Friday.\n\n“It looks like the rest of the neighborhood fared pretty good this time,” Dietz said.\n\nIt was the fourth time this year that Dietz’s garage has flooded. In early January, flood waters topped the shoulder-high shelves where he stores his tools and other equipment in the garage.\n\n“Just hosing out the muck,” Dietz said. “There was maybe a foot, foot and a half of water in here. Thankfully, it’s easy to clean when it’s wet, it just hoses right out.”\n\nA break is on the way with only light isolated showers expected through the weekend, said National Weather Service meteorologist Cindy Kobold. Approaching quickly, however, is a second atmospheric river storm that appears likely to hit Monday night into Tuesday morning.\n\n“It looks like that atmospheric river will not be as strong as the one we just experienced,” Kobold said. “But it could be more impactful, because everything is already flooded.”\n\nIn Soquel, Main Street collapsed under heavy floods. A video posted to Santa Cruz County’s Twitter feed showed a rapid band of water flowing perpendicular to the damaged roadway, prompting a closure.\n\nPolice estimated Friday morning that 1,000 residents beyond the road washout in Soquel have lost the ability to leave by road. But a small wooden bridge just downstream will allow trapped residents to leave and return, and replenish supplies, on foot, police said\n\nRoad crews on Friday morning were using a dump truck and an excavator to fill the gap in washed-out Main Street in Soquel with boulders. County road superintendent Alex Sandoval said the rock, plus industrial fabric, will be topped with steel plates for a short-term fix, possibly by early Saturday morning.\n\nThe work was complicated by a tree that fell on a gas line. That development forced Pacific Gas & Electric to shut off gas around 9 a.m. and purge the line afterward, a Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s deputy said.\n\nFlooding on residential streets in the Pajaro Village neighborhood of Watsonville forced evacuations Thursday night, which lingered into Friday. Also in Santa Cruz County, Felton Grove, Paradise Park and Soquel Village were evacuated just before midnight Thursday due to flooding concerns according to the Sheriff’s Office.\n\nHighway 129 between Murphy Crossing to Highway 101 in Santa Cruz County was closed Friday morning due to slides, as was Highway 152 at Casserly Road.\n\nAt noon Friday, the only way south from the closure on southbound 101 was taking 152 east to Hollister then south to San Juan Road. But some cars had already been lifted by flood waters on Ferguson Road behind Gilroy’s outlets and ended up in ditches, said Randy Newton, who directed lost motorists to turn around.\n\n“A lot of people have no clue where they’re going,” Newton said. “Everyone of them is just shaking their heads and trying to figure it out.”\n\nOne of the southbound lanes of Highway 101 opened by 12:30 p.m., according to Caltrans.\n\nOn Interstate 580 in the East Bay, a stretch of at least a half-mile in both directions between the 35th Avenue and High Street exits was closed. A failed water pump contributed to making the freeway a massive bathtub.\n\nThe eastbound side of the freeway re-opened at 9 a.m.; while the westbound side re-opened at 11:30 a.m., according to the California Department of Transportation.\n\nIn Contra Costa County, the rain forced a closure of a half-mile stretch of Harbor Street, a main artery in Pittsburg overnight and past 10 a.m. Friday.\n\nWinds also were at play along with the rain overnight, with some inland communities seeing wind gusts of 35 to 45 mph, while elevations above 5,000 feet saw 65-75 mph gusts, according to the weather service.\n\nThat caused power interruptions to much of the region. At 11 a.m., PG&E was working to restore electricity to about 4,500 Bay Area residents, the majority if them in the Peninsula (about 1,740); South Bay (1,260) and North Bay (1,100).\n\nThose workers were helped by a decrease in the winds. A wind advisory issued by the weather service on Thursday expired early Friday.\n\nThe high winds overnight combined with heavily saturated soils made for dangerous situations when it came to fallen trees around the region. Two passengers of a Tesla were miraculously OK after a massive tree collapsed on the vehicle in unincorporated Redwood City. Old La Honda Road and Skyline Boulevard remained closed Friday morning due to the incident.\n\nThe rain also was blamed on a horrific accident just off the Ygnacio Valley Boulevard exit on Interstate 680 in which a vehicle ended up going over a bus, according to fire officials. The driver of that car was hospitalized, officials said."
