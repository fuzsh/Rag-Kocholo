        "text": "Santa Cruz County, California Bridges: Southern Pacific Railroad Bridge across San Lorenzo River\n\nDecember 2009 (36.96582, -122.01280 Degrees) UP Railroad Bridge\n\nToday we begin studying the bridges in Santa Cruz County, southwest of the counties surrounding San Francisco Bay (see Wikepedia map below).\n\nThe San Lorenzo River is crossed by the Southern Pacific Railroad Bridge just before it empties into the Pacific Ocean. The bridge includes two six panel Warren truss spans (across the river) and a plate girder approach span on the west side of the river.\n\nThe bridge is 332 ft long with 120 ft long truss spans. The 1990 East Cliff Drive Overhead (36C0106) can be seen crossing over the track just east of the bridge in the photo below. A pedestrian walkway was built on the north side of the bridge, probably to keep people from walking on the tracks. It is supported by steel corbels extending from the floor beams.\n\nRailroads have a complicated history along California'a Coast. The tracks were built by small railroad companies who were bought by bigger companies who eventually abandoned the tracks, which were purchased again by small companies. For instance this track is now owned by the Roaring Camp Railroad, which offers scenic passenger train service along the coast.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Southern Pacific Railroad Bridge across San Lorenzo River by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: West Cliff Drive Overhead across the Southern Pacific Railroad\n\nDecember 2009 (36.96297 Degrees,-122.02510 Degrees) West Cliff Drive OH\n\nYesterday's bridge carried the SP railroad tracks across the San Lorenzo River on the east side of Santa Cruz Beach. Today's West Cliff Drive OH (36C0127) carries foot and vehicle traffic over the SP railroad tracks on the west side of the beach. Along the beach are surfing classes, a wooden wharf with sea lions lounging among the piers, and a boardwalk with an amusement park. The beach was featured in the film \"The Lost Boys\" and several other movies.\n\nThis bridge was built in 1918 with a timber trestle substructure and a Howe pony truss over the railroad tracks. In 2000 it was strengthened with steel I girders supporting the main span (see photo below). Between the trusses is a single lane road and on the outside are walkways supported by corbels extending out from the floor beams.\n\nThe bridge is 190 ft long with a 62 ft long truss span. The bridge is in 'Good' condition with a sufficiency rating of 93 and it carries about 500 vehicles a day. 'Historic Highway Bridges of California' states that this bridge was built by the Southern Pacific as a grade separation over its track. They continue '..It is the only Howe Truss on a California Highway\" although this one lane road hardly qualifies as a highway. Perhaps because of the extensive alterations it is not registered as a historic place.\n\nHowever, the Santa Cruz County Public Libraries Site states that 'the West Cliff Drive Howe Truss Bridge is the last of its kind in the state highway system. It stands where the county's first wagon bridge was constructed. The original bridge was built by town founder Elihu Anthony in 1849, so loaded wagons could climb the bluff to use his wharf at the end of Bay Street. This was reached from Washington and Second streets. In 1876, railroad tracks were built going under the bridge. Then in 1918, Southern Pacific moved the bridge's north entrance to a one-lane driveway on Blackburn Terrace, into which two lanes were later squeezed. The span was replaced with a Howe truss bridge (from the 1840 patent, which introduced wrought iron into what had been primarily a timber design.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: West Cliff Drive Overhead across the Southern Pacific Railroad by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Riverside Avenue Bridge across the San Lorenzo River\n\nDecember 2009 (36.9678 Degrees, -122.0189 Degrees) Riverside Avenue Bridge\n\nUpstream of the Southern Pacific Railroad Bridge is the Riverside Avenue Bridge (36C0099) across the San Lorenzo River. This is a cast-in-place 3-span box girder bridge that was built in 1990. The architectural details on this bridge match many of the other road bridges across San Lorenzo Creek. The antique lampposts, barrier rail, and balconies hanging out over the bents are a recurring motif along the river.\n\nThe Riverside Avenue Bridge is 282 ft long, 73 ft wide, and with a 107 ft main span. The substructure has rectangular two-column bents with 360 degree flared columns, giving it a classical appearance.\n\nThere used to be a three span deck arch bridge at this location (see photo below), but the US Corp of Engineers found that it impeded water flow and caused floods and so it was replaced with the current bridge. The photo below shows men fishing beside the bridge prior to the great flood of 1955.\n\nThis photo is the property of the Santa Cruz Public Library\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Riverside Avenue Bridge across the San Lorenzo River by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Laurel Street Bridge across the San Lorenzo River\n\nDecember 2009 (36.97000 Degrees, -122.02278 Degrees) Laurel Street Bridge\n\nThe Laurel Street Bridge (36C0102) is a 3-span bridge with a drop-in center span over the San Lorenzo River. The bridge is 335 ft long with a 170 ft main span and it's 83 ft wide. The bridge is supported on pier walls that have a latticed outside facing which flares dramatically upward to the soffit.\n\nThis bridge was built in 1968 and got a $5 million seismic retrofit in 1999. The piers and foundations were strengthened, the soil was mitigated to prevent liquefaction, and the bridge was decorated with new lampposts and railings to match the other river crossings. In fact, this bridge looks almost identical to the Water Street Bridge across the San Lorenzo River that we will be visiting shortly.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Laurel Street Bridge across the San Lorenzo River by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Soquel Avenue Bridge across the San Lorenzo River\n\nDecember 2009 (36.97333, -122.02278) Soquel Avenue Bridge\n\nContinuing up the San Lorenzo River we arrived at the Soquel Avenue Bridge (36C0105), which is a 4-span, cast-in-place, reinforced concrete box girder bridge. This bridge is 380 ft long with a 112 ft long main span and a 60 ft wide deck supported on pier wall. It is just the latest in a series of bridges that were built at this location.\n\nThe first recorded structure was a covered bridge built in 1874. In 1890 a timber trestle was added. These bridges were replaced in 1921 with a concrete and steel girder bridge. It was widened to four lanes in 1967 with a concrete precast I girder bridge on the north side. In 1982 severe flooding caused the collapse of of the old southern side of the bridge. It was repaired with an I girder bridge in 1984. In 1999 the current bridge was built at this site. It seems like the late 1990s was a time for Santa Cruz to do some flood control and refurbishing of bridges.\n\nCollapsed Soquel Avenue Bridge during 1982 flood (Photo Property of Santa Cruz Public Library).\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Soquel Avenue Bridge across the San Lorenzo River by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Water Street Bridge across the San Lorenzo River\n\nDecember 2009 (36.97778 Degrees, -122.02389 degrees) Water Street Bridge\n\nA nice thing about urban waterways is they usually have a footpath along them that makes it easier to photograph bridges. As we continued walking along the San Lorenzo River footpath we came upon a badly stained four span footbridge, and a little beyond it was the Water Street Bridge.\n\nThe Water Street Bridge (36C0089) looks almost exactly like the previously studied Laurel Street Bridge, except it doesn't have a drop-in span. Both bridges were built in the late 1960s and retrofitted and refurbished in the late 1990s.\n\nThe Water Street Bridge is a three span, 320 ft long bridge with a 170 ft main span and a 73 ft wide deck. The northern side of the bridge was two arch bridges that were built in 1908 and 1914. In 1967 the bridge was widened with a reinforced concrete box girder bridge on the south side. In 1997 the northern bridges were removed and replaced with a bridge that matched the bridge on the south side.\n\nLike most of the other bridges across the San Lorenzo River, the Water Street Bridge had several antecedents including a through timber arch bridge from 1882 shown below (photo courtesy of the Santa Cruz Public Library). Another photo in the library's collection shows an even older bridge that was the scene of a grisly lynching.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Water Street Bridge across the San Lorenzo River by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: San Lorenzo River Pedestrian Bridge\n\nSeptember 2009 (36.9844 Degrees, -122.0277 Degrees) San Lorenzo River Pedestrian Bridge\n\nThe next bridge across the San Lorenzo River is an interesting pedestrian crossing. It's a continuous three span pony truss bridge. I guess it's a Parker truss since the diagonal members slope down towards the center and top chords are rounded.\n\nThe bridge is 300 ft long, with a 130 ft long main span and 85 ft long side spans. It's made of cor-ten steel, which has a protective exterior that doesn't need painting. The superstructure sits on hammerhead bents and seat-type abutments. I would imagine it was built in sections in a factory and brought to the site to be assembled.\n\nThe bridge was in the planning from 2001 and finally got built in 2008 after a lengthy environmental approval process. It was supposed to cost $2.5 million but ended up costing a little more due to change orders. It was designed and built by a consortium of engineering firms including TRC, Syblon Reid, and Parsons Brinkerhoff. It won an award from the American Public Works Association for th Monterey Area.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: San Lorenzo River Pedestrian Bridge by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: State Route 1 Bridges across Struve Slough\n\nOctober 1989 (36.9049 Degrees, -121.7807 Degrees) Struve Slough Bridges\n\nSanta Cruz County has an interesting geography of swampy sloughs running through coastal hills. It's also a highly seismic area that sustained a lot of damage during the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake. The Struve Slough Bridges (36 0088L/R) are 21 span 'T' girder bridges on pile extensions. During the earthquake the swampy soil was so highly excited by the shaking that the top of the pile extensions were dragged out the bent caps and punctured the deck.\n\nThe bridge replacement was Caltrans first experiment with incentive/disincentive contracts where contractors bid on how many days it would take to rebuild the bridges. The job was completed in 55 days, 35 days earlier than expected and the contractor earned an additional $30,000 for every day they saved or an extra $1 million for early completion.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: State Route 1 Bridges across Struve Slough by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Big Basin Highway Bridge across Boulder Creek\n\nMarch 2014 (37.13829, -122.14333 Degrees) Boulder Creek Bridge\n\nLast week we traveled up the San Lorenzo River. We'll return to it later, but for the next few days we'll be looking at some bridges further inland.\n\nThe Big Basin Highway (State Route 236) crosses and recrosses Boulder Creek several times between Jamison Creek Road and State Route 9. All of the bridges are almost identical, an open spandrel arch bridge over the creek with short end spans.\n\nThis Boulder Creek Bridge (36 0009) is 72 ft long with a 50 ft long arch span. It was built in 1921 and carries about 4500 vehicles a day.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Big Basin Highway Bridge across Boulder Creek by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Big Basin Highway Bridge across Boulder Creek\n\nMarch 2014 (37.13197 Degrees,-122.13710 Degrees) Boulder Creek Bridge\n\nThe next Boulder Creek Bridge (36 0010) is almost identical to the previously studied bridge. However, the ground is more level under this bridge and consequently the arch supports are directly against the abutment stemwall. This bridge was also built in 1921 with a 55 ft long arch span. The bridge is 77 ft long and 21 ft wide.\n\nThis seems like an expensive bridge alternative when they could have just plopped a truss span onto the abutments. Probably concrete arch bridges were the preferred alternative for state highways in the 1920s. The concrete is green with lichen in this wet, heavily vegetated environment.\n\nState Route 236 is only 18 miles long and it's narrow to avoid the dense stands of ancient redwoods in the lowlands of the Santa Cruz Mountains.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Big Basin Highway Bridge across Boulder Creek by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: State Route 9 Bridge across Boulder Creek\n\nMarch 2014 (37.12634 Degrees,-122.12256 Degrees) Boulder Creek Bridge\n\nToday's bridge crosses Boulder Creek (in the town of Boulder Creek) just before it joins the San Lorenzo River. This bridge carries State Route 9, a heavily traveled highway, and consequently it's bigger and more imposing than the previous Boulder Creek Bridges.\n\nThe Boulder Creek Bridge (36 0051) was built in 1931, its 95 ft long, with a 61 ft long arch span. More time was taken in giving the spandrel columns, corbels, barrier rails, and other structural elements ornate architectural details.\n\nThe town of Boulder Creek was originally (in the 19th century) heavily involved in the timber industry with a logging flume and a railroad yard to carry lumber to the City of Santa Cruz. Most of the redwood forests in the area are now state and national parks and the population of 5000 supports more diverse commercial endeavors.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: State Route 9 Bridge across Boulder Creek by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Bear Creek Road across the San Lorenzo River\n\nMarch 2014 (37.12778, -122.12194) Bear Creek Road Bridge\n\nThe town of Boulder Creek is located where several tributaries join the San Lorenzo River. I stopped to look at a few of the bridges in town. Today's bridge carries Bear Creek Road across the San Lorenzo River. The Bear Creek Road Bridge (36C0084) is a 174 ft long 3-span steel stringer bridge with a 70 ft long center span. The San Lorenzo River has cut a narrow canyon at the bridge site and so the bridge is supported on tall, two column bents.\n\nThis is a county bridge, but it appears that bridge construction for both state and county bridges changed from concrete arch to steel and precast I girder bridges in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nBear Creek Road is surrounded by residences and it's so densely forested that I couldn't see the bridge on Google earth. It carries traffic between SR 9 and SR 17 through mountainous terrain.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Bear Creek Road across the San Lorenzo River by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Glen Arbor Road Bridge across the San Lorenzo River\n\nMarch 2014 (37.07427 Degrees, -122.08396 Degrees) Glen Arbor Road Bridge\n\nTraveling south on State Route 9, I stopped to look at several bridges over the San Lorenzo River but they were the usual steel stringer or precast I girder bridges. The first interesting bridge I came upon carried Glen Arbor Road over the San Lorenzo River onto SR 9 (see photo above).\n\nI had to ask a local resident's permission to enter his backyard to photograph this bridge. There was no public access available to see the San Lorenzo River at this location. The Glen Arbor Road Bridge (36C0040) turned out to be a 3-span continuous, cast-in-place, reinforced concrete box girder bridge. This bridge is 217 ft long with a 115 ft long main span and it was built in 1968.\n\nIt's an attractive modern bridge with very wide overhangs and tall single column bents. The circular columns have pinched one-way flares on top. The west abutment is considerably larger to support the widened superstructure that allows traffic to make left and right turns onto State Route 9.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Glen Arbor Road Bridge across the San Lorenzo River by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: State Route 9 Bridge across the San Lorenzo River\n\nMarch 2014 (37.06972,-122.08417 Degrees) San Lorenzo River Bridge\n\nContinuing down State Route 9 into the town of Ben Lomond, we found more open spandrel arch bridges. There must have been a rule in the 1920s and 1930s that state bridges over rivers had to be concrete arches. This policy (if it truly existed) has proven to be bad because it restricts stream flow but also good because it resulted in many long-lasting attractive bridges.\n\nThe San Lorenzo River Bridge (36 0047) carrying SR 9 in Ben Lomond is a 150 ft long bridge with a 100 ft long open spandrel arch span over the river. This bridge was built in 1933 and has two 12 ft wide lanes, no shoulders, but wide sidewalks.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: State Route 9 Bridge across the San Lorenzo River by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: State Route 9 Bridge across the San Lorenzo River\n\nMarch 2014 (37.06861, -122.08306) San Lorenzo River Bridge\n\nThe next bridge across the San Lorenzo River is another open spandrel arch. It's composed of a 135 ft arch main span and T girder approach spans. It carries State Route 9 (Br. #36 0046) and it was built in 1927. All of the arch bridges over the San Lorenzo River have very flat segmental arch shapes. What's odd about this bridge is that it looks like it's been retrofitted with steel casings at the ends of the arch ribs. However, I've never seen a seismic retrofit like that before. Also the rectangular columns supporting the approach spans have circular casings.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: State Route 9 Bridge across the San Lorenzo River by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: San Lorenzo Way Bridge across the San Lorenzo River\n\nMarch 2013 (37.05799 Degrees, -122.07588 Degrees) San Lorenzo Way Bridge\n\nToday's bridge looked exceedingly fragile but it apparently can support a 28,000 pound 3-axle vehicle! I'm surprised that such a truck could even fit between the barrier rails. However, I must say that this bridge felt rock solid as I walked across it (I left my truck behind).\n\nThe San Lorenzo Way Bridge (36C0085) is a 160 ft long steel arch truss built in 1920. The truss members are so thin that it took me several minutes to recognize it as an arch. I scrambled up and down the steep river bank trying to take a photo that would capture the bridge's form. However, the dense foliage and branch-like truss members defeated all my attempts to take a decent picture of its structure.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: San Lorenzo Way Bridge across the San Lorenzo River by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Graham Hill Road across the San Lorenzo River\n\nMarch 2014 (37.05278 Degrees, -122.07194 Degrees) Graham Hill Road Bridge\n\nJust downstream from yesterday's truss arch bridge is a three span haunched box girder bridge across the San Lorenzo River. The Graham Hill Road Bridge (36C0101) was built in 1938 and rehabilitated (widened) in 1989.\n\nWe are in the town of Felton, which like Boulder Creek has a history as a logging town during the later half of the 19th century. This is a pretty and a historic area with a variety of interesting bridges that we'll study over the next few days.\n\nThe Graham Hill Road Bridge is a 221 ft long bridge with a 116 ft long main span. The deck is now 78 ft wide and on a 40 degree skew. The bridge is in 'Good' condition, it carries over 25,000 vehicles a day, and it has a sufficiency rating of 85.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Graham Hill Road across the San Lorenzo River by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Felton Covered Bridge across the San Lorenzo River\n\nMarch 2014 (37.05081, -122.07092) Felton Covered Bridge\n\nA covered bridge across the San Lorenzo River was built in the town of Felton in 1892. It was originally built as a timber through truss but it was covered with a roof a few years later to protect the vulnerable timber deck from all the rain.\n\nThe Felton Covered Bridge is one of the newer and one of the shorter covered bridges in California. However, the addition of the roof truss also made it the tallest (at 35 ft) covered bridge in the United States. It is also one of the last covered bridges made of redwood.\n\nThe bridge was closed to traffic in 1937 and became the first bypassed bridge in the western U.S. to be restored as an historic landmark. Money was raised for the original bridge with a costume ball and the bridge continues to be maintained with an annual pancake breakfast.\n\nInformation on the Felton Covered Bridge comes from many sources. A plaque beside the bridge describes how after it became a pedestrian bridge it was used in many movies until it was damaged by a flood on the San Lorenzo River in 1962 and rebuilt by local residents in 1967. The Santa Cruz Public Library's website also contributed information about this and the other San Cruz covered bridges. Drawings and other information was provided by 'Historic Highway Bridges in California.'\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Felton Covered Bridge across the San Lorenzo River by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Conference Center Drive Bridge and Overhead over Zayante Creek\n\nMarch 2014 (37.05056 Degrees, -122.06472 Degrees) Conference Center Drive Br. and OH\n\nHalf a mile east of yesterday's bridge is the Conference Center Drive and Overhead Bridge (36C0038). This 523 ft long bridge crosses over East Zayante Road, Zayante Creek, and the South Pacific Coast Railroad (now owned by the Santa Cruz Big Trees and Pacific Railway). This bridge carries vehicle and foot traffic to the idyllic Mount Hermon Christian Conference Center.\n\nThe bridge is in surprisingly good shape for a structure built in 1930. Maybe it's maintained by the Conference Center? While I was photographing it groups of conference attendees kept strolling by on the timber sidewalk.\n\nIt's a rather odd bridge because it's composed almost entirely of steel wide flange girders. The columns are steel girders, the superstructure is steel girders, and even the timber railing is supported by steel girders. Anyway, the bridge is composed of 50 ft spans and the deck is 24 ft wide.\n\nI also wanted to photograph the Zayante Railroad Trestle Bridge but I couldn't figure out how to get down to it. The only photograph I was able to get (shown above) was from the deck of the Conference Center Bridge. Anyway, it's a steel plate girder bridge on reinforced concrete pier walls that was built in 1917.

The Big Trees Bridge (36P0013) is 143 ft long with a 75 ft main span and a 36 ft wide deck that carries Big Trees Park Road. The bridge was built in 1931 and it's owned by the State Park Service.\n\nSanta Cruz County, California Bridges: Big Trees Bridge across the San Lorenzo River by Mark Yashinsky is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\n↧"
