        "text": "FELTON — About 100 community members of all ages gathered at the Felton Community Hall on a smoky Wednesday evening in the San Lorenzo Valley to get information about the potential construction of an asphalt pump track at the Felton Covered Bridge County Park.\n\nThe meeting served as a follow-up to a community meeting in early August where the project was initially presented to the public. After some technical difficulties with a projector and a brief introduction from 5th District Supervisor Supervisor Bruce McPherson, Santa Cruz County Parks Department Deputy Director Rebecca Hurley took the stage.\n\n“We had an initial community meeting regarding the potential installation of a pump track at Felton Covered Bridge County Park and from that initial community meeting we had a lot of feedback,” said Hurley. “There was positive feedback and concerns.”\n\nHurley provided a timeline and overview for the project and addressed some of the biggest concerns voiced by community members. In regard to the timeline, Hurley said that the idea for a potential pump track was initially brought to Santa Cruz County Parks in 2022 by an unnamed constituent.\n\n“We did a renovation of the play area in 2003 and that’s really the most construction that’s occurred in the park until this potential kind of upgrade,” said Hurley. “We were first approached by a constituent with a lot of enthusiasm to bring some sort of pump track or riding trails to Felton Covered Bridge County Park in March 2022.”\n\nHurley explained that the concept was appealing to County Parks, but the organization didn’t have the funding to build a new amenity in the park and so they reached out to the local nonprofit County Park Friends.\n\n“At the time, they were working on multiple endeavors and couldn’t help out with the effort,” said Hurley. “The idea came to talk to Santa Cruz Mountain Trail Stewards about their ability to do this in other areas and if they could take this on and fund the endeavor. Again, County Parks didn’t have the funds to do this and there wasn’t a local champion to really help out with this effort.”\n\nThe local nonprofit Santa Cruz Mountains Trail Stewardship has facilitated the building of pump tracks on the Westside of Santa Cruz, in the Harvey West neighborhood, at Ramsay Park in Watsonville and in places outside of the county such as Marina and Menlo Park. The nonprofit is leading the project to design, fundraise for and install the pump track in Felton Covered Bridge County Park.\n\nA pump track is an asphalt or dirt course made for sports equipment with wheels such as bicycles, and doesn’t require pedaling, just a pumping action, which propels riders over small hills, or rollers, and around berms in a loop.\n\nHurley said that the process to reach out to the community about the pump track project was postponed by the atmospheric river storms and flooding that occurred over the winter.\n\n“It just didn’t feel appropriate to hold meetings like this when you all were dealing with the flooding in your town,” said Hurley. “If we move forward with this, the potential of taking an agreement with the Santa Cruz trail stewards for fundraising would come in October and that would go before the Board of Supervisors.”\n\nHurley then addressed numerous concerns voiced by community members about the park’s general feel, public safety, bathrooms, parking and flooding.\n\n“We consulted with county planning and because of the size of the pump track and the fact that we would make the area all self-treating, which means everything that would run off the asphalt areas would go down into a drain and would percolate and go back into the groundwater slowly,” said Hurley. “If we move forward with this, the one condition is that we’d have to get it signed off by a hydrologist.”\n\nCommunity members were then asked to comment, and about 25 people lined up to speak including a few children and teenagers.\n\nThose opposed to the track voiced concerns about the use of asphalt, parking issues, flooding, and the proposed location, among other concerns. Members of the Valley Women’s Club of San Lorenzo Valley, which penned a letter to Supervisor McPherson, also spoke at the meeting in opposition to the pump track’s proposed location.\n\n“I am on the board of the Valley Women’s Club and we did consider this project and we did vote to unanimously oppose the location of the pump track,” said Felton resident Brianna Goodman. “We are very, very supportive of a pump track. We think it’s a great idea.”\n\nMost community members spoke in favor of the pump track, including the kids and teens who spoke, and local parents with young children, many of whom pointed out that any activity that gets kids outside and away from screens is a good thing.\n\n“It seems like this a very deliberative, well thought out process,” said Felton resident Yakeen Qawasmeh, who was at the meeting with his two children. “If we have the will and we have the funding for some use that is better for our community and that will bring more families out, we should be supportive of it.”\n\nThe project will be reviewed by the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors next month before fundraising and the design process can begin."
