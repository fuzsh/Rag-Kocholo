We had reserved a compact car at National Car Rental. We completed paperwork at the counter and were told to go to the parking lot and pick out any compact. Imagine our surprise when we saw only SUVs and minivans in the \"compact\" car row. I asked a passing employee and he said that we could have a minivan or SUV at no extra charge if it was parked in the compact row. We didn't like this idea, since that would double our gas bill. Just then another employee pulled up with a Chevrolet Cobalt, fresh from the carwash. We took that one. When we returned home, I totaled our gas receipts--a little over $320. I suspect that I saved about $320 by passing on a minivan/SUV.\n\nOn Thursday the 29th, we headed north driving part of the way on the scenic coast road, California 1. The seal pictures are dated the 28th because my camera somehow lost a day and I did not discover it until about June 5. Liz now has her own digital camera, a Canon A560. At one point we passed thru a huge field of oil derricks. I thought of a herd of mechanical giraffes, with their long necks constantly dipping and rising. We also noticed tumbleweeds piled up against the fence for several miles.\n\nThe first picture is of a yearling seal coming ashore. The second is of a male and a female. The male had climbed atop the female with amorous intentions, but the female got out from under, turned around, lifted up her head and started barking at him, probably-\"Not now! I have a headache!\" These pictures are taken from the Northern Elephant Seal viewpoint, Point Piedras Blancas.\n\nThe next pictures are of the covered bridge and covered bridge sign at the Roaring Camp & Big Trees Narrow gauge RR. The RR has two trips, one to the boardwalk at Santa Cruz and the second, a trip up Bear Mountain. Both go through the Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park (see scan of steam engine). On the 30th we rode the mountain train and on the 31st we rode the boardwalk train. We also found time to walk a trail in the Henry Cowell State Park and persuaded a man to take our picture in front of the tallest tree in the park, also 5th tallest in the world.\n\nNext we visited the Felton covered bridge, the tallest in the country, according to the sign. My AAA tour book also says it is the only one in the US made of redwood. There are three pictures of the Felton bridge and one of the sign. The picture with Liz shows the barriers, blocking atvs, snowmobiles and bikes. We also visited the Paradise covered bridge, located inside Masonic Paradise Park, a private development next to the state park. We asked for permission to visit it at the office.\n\nWe used Dale Travis' covered bridge website for directions, which I found thru a link on the California tourism website, but it is also on the VCBS website.\n\nTom\n\nFelton Covered Bridge at Felton, CA\n\n05-44-02, \"the tallest bridge.\" \"The tallest bridge\" with Liz.\n\nFelton Bridge Interior Felton Bridge portal view\n\n186 feet long, it San Lorenzo R. using a Pratt variationTruss.\n\nFelton Bridge plaque at Felton Park\n\nBuilt in 1882 and believed to be the tallest covered bridge in the country it stood as the only entry to Felton for 45 years. In 1937 it was retired from active service to become a pedestrian bridge and figured prominently in many films of that period. After suffering damage in the winter storms of 1982. It was restored to its original elegance in 1987 using native materials andlocal talent.\n\nCalifornia Registered Landmark No. 583 Roaring Camp Covered Bridge 05-44-04\n\nBuilt in 1969, 36 feet in length, it crosses Roaring Creek using a Pratt truss\n\nRoaring Creek & Big Trees Narrow Guage RR Roaring Camp Sign\n\nParadise Park Bridge at Masonic Paradise Park\n\n05-44-03, 180 feet long in two spans, crossing San Lorenzo River using Smith Truss.
