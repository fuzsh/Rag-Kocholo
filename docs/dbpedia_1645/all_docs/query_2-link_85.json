Masterclasses World class conductors and teachers give guidance on technique, presentation, musical style and successful auditioning. SommersoirÃ©es BOA hosts a formal SommersoirÃ©es Series in Berlin where musicians showcase favorite works. Chamber Music Concert BOA hosts a concert series in Berlin where the orchestra can perform chamber music works of their choosing.\n\nIndividual lessons are not part of the program, but we are happy to share our extensive network of musician contacts in Berlin with students who wish to make their own arrangements.\n\nEach session is focused on the opera performances, but the week in-between is tailored to the unique needs and desires of our talented orchestra members. Through open communication with our conductors, we make sure that the program is constantly evolving to best suit the group.\n\nNext steps"
