        "text": "Mezzo Soprano, Giulia Laudano has been singing since she was eight and was a chorister with International Voices of Enfield Choir, run by June and Christopher Keyte. She was a Music Scholar at Dame Alice Owen’s School, Hertfordshire and studied concurrently at the Royal College of Music Junior Department. Her awards have included the National Association of Choirs Cup for Future Talent, the Smythe Cup for Excellence, the John Rutter Award for Superb Musicianship and the Jack Petchey Leadership Award. She is now in her third year on the BMus programme at the Royal Academy of Music studying with Catherine Wyn-Rogers and Audrey Hyland. She was selected to represent the Royal Academy of Music at the Young Singers’ Kathleen Ferrier Competition, in Blackburn, in 2015 and in May 2017, Giulia won the Elena Gerhardt Lieder Prize at the Royal Academy of Music and was Very Highly Commended in the Marjorie Thomas Art of Song Prize. During the Summer of 2016, Giulia worked on the roles of Dorabella and Meg in scenes from Mozart’s Cosí fan tutte and Verdi’s Falstaff on an Italian Intensive Opera Course run by Isabella Radcliffe and Philip Thomas. She also participated in a workshop on The Magic Flute with British Youth Opera, singing the role of Third Lady - she will return to work with British Youth Opera this summer in their production of Judith Weir’s opera, The Vanishing Bridegroom. Giulia is a member of the Royal Academy Song Circle and recently performed in a concert with them at the Austrian Cultural Forum. In 2017, Giulia has enthusiastically taken part in many projects at the Academy, singing in the chorus for the Opera School’s production of Orphée aux Enfers, the Bach Cantata chorus, and Mahler’s Resurrection Symphony at the Royal Festival Hall, conducted by Semyon Bychkov. Giulia has already gained much experience on the concert platform, at venues including Eton College Chapel, Selwyn College, Cambridge, il Duomo in Milan, and several cathedrals in the UK. Giulia will be performing as a soloist with the Enfield Chamber Orchestra in November."
