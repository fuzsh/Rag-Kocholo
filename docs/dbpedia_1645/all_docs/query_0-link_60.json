        "text": "On Feb 25, 10:38 am, Mike Scott Rohan\n\nPost by Mike Scott Rohan\n\nPost by REP\n\nI was just playing from an ancient university-copy of the Lohengrin\n\nvocal score and in the prelude, someone has circled one of the last\n\nmeasures and labeled it \"Prelude to Kunihild.\" Believing I knew\n\neverything about the operatic literature, it took me a while to accept\n\nthat \"Kunihild\" was indeed the word written and that I was not\n\nmisreading it. So I finally googled \"Kunihild\" and discovered that a\n\nGerman composer, Cyrill Kistler (1848-1907), had indeed written an\n\nopera by that name.\n\nAccording to the Wiki article, Kistler knew Wagner personally, and the\n\nelder composer \"described his friend Cyrill Kistler as his only\n\ndignified successor.\" Interesting if true.\n\nAnyways, Kistler's music appears entirely forgotten today, except by\n\nthe previous borrower of this Lohengrin vocal score and by high school\n\nbands. That's right, the Prelude to Act 3 of Kunihild is available in\n\na number of different YouTube recordings. If you know the Lohengrin\n\nprelude as well as I do, you won't need any help hearing the\n\nhttp://youtu.be/E7yhhE7b_Jg\n\nSo has anyone heard more of his stuff? And did Wagner really praise\n\nhim so highly?\n\nREP\n\nHe was undoubtedly a friend of Wagner's, a devoted Wagnerian and a\n\ntheoretician who did much to raise the technical opinion of Wagner's\n\nmusic; small wonder if Wagner thought well of him. But he can only\n\nhave heard Kistler's earliest works, so the endorsement must be more\n\nof the \"promising\" variety; he probably expected K to develop further\n\nand become less sheerly imitative. In fact he didn't; this may have\n\nbeen due to ill health, though he still wrote a great deal. It all\n\nremained rather derivative, it seems. In a music text of 1905, the\n\nyear of Kistler's quite early death, I've found that he is described\n\nas (approximately) \"formerly thought of as Wagner's successor, but now\n\nall his works have fallen into obscurity.\" As soon as that. Whereas\n\nthe same article describes the mighty post-Wagnerian charlatan of\n\nsimilar vintage August Bungert in still quite laudatory terms. Kistler\n\nwas a much finer musician, and his works on harmony are still taken\n\nvery seriously. And he does have one plus to history -- it was a\n\nperformance of his opera Eulenspiegel that inspired Richard Strauss to\n\nwrite his tone-poem.\n\nWhat I hear in that prelude, incidentally, isn't Lohengrin but Rienzi,\n\nlifted wholesale!\n\nCheers,\n\nMike\n\nBungert is another composer I'd never heard of before. An opera\n\ntetralogy based on Homer is certainly intriguing, but for recordings,\n\nall I can find is one half-assed MIDI realization of a prelude on\n\nYouTube. It would be nice to hear more, but if that MIDI realization\n\nis genuine, then there's a good reason why his music is forgotten.\n\nThe measure that this person had circled in the Lohengrin prelude, by\n\nthe way, was this one:\n\nREP\n\nMike Scott Rohan\n\nPost by REP\n\nBungert is another composer I'd never heard of before.

I haven't heard them for years, but as I remember\n\nthey don't sound like anything very special.\n\nIf classical subjects appeal, incidentally, it's isn't Homer, but have\n\nyou ever heard Taneyev's Oresteia? Another operatic trilogy, and often\n\nquite impressive, notably the rather Tannhauser-ish prelude to the\n\nApollo's temple at Delphi scene, which is the commonest excerpt. There\n\nwas an LP release on DG in the early 80s, but I haven't seen one\n\nlately; however there are some snippets, arias etc on Youtube.\n\nThere's also an \"overture\", distinct from the score, which is more a\n\ntone-poem of digested motifs, rather like Rimsky's Sadko but written\n\nbefore rather than after; that's been recorded by Ashkenazy.\n\nCheers,\n\nMike"
