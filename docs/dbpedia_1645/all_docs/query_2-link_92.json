        "text": "B\n\nBanda\n\nMusicians who perform on the stage, in addition to those in the pit. Often as military players or a small group playing in a party scene.\n\nBaritone\n\nThe middle male singing voice, higher than a Bass but lower than a Tenor.\n\nBaton\n\nThe stick held by the conductor which he uses to direct the orchestra.\n\nBel canto\n\nThe literal translation is \"Beautiful singing\". More specifically a type of Italian singing style epitomised by Donizetti and Rossini during the first half of the 19th Century.\n\nBravo\n\nAn exclamation during applause when audience members are particularly impressed and enthuised. If we’re to be fussy about the Italian: Bravo should be directed at a single male performer, Brava at a single female and Bravi at a group. However, it’s largely been adopted into English as a one size fits all so you do you.\n\nC\n\nCadenza\n\nA designated part of the music usually found towards the end of an aria where the singer can really show off. Sometimes improvised though more commonly prepared in advance, a cadenza is rhythmically free and full of ornamentation.\n\nCastrato\n\nAn adult male singer who has kept their childhood high range by being castrated before puberty. Extremely popular, many Castrati were mega stars of their era, until the end of the 18th Century when the practice was outlawed. These roles are now largely sung by female Mezzos or male Countertenors.\n\nChoreographer\n\nThe person who creates the steps for the dances within a production.\n\nChord\n\nA set of two or more notes heard together.\n\nChorus\n\nA large group of singers who sing together, portraying unnamed characters.\n\nClaque\n\nThankfully now a thing of the past. A claque was a group of audience members who would cheer or boo for money, sometimes blackmailing singers into paying.\n\nColoratura\n\nElaborate singing involving vocal runs, trills and leaps. One of the most virtuosic aspects of opera.\n\nComposer\n\nSpecifically, the person who writes all the music in an opera. More generally the composer usually provides the vision and drive behind an opera as well.\n\nConcert Master\n\nThe leader of the orchestra. Always a violinist who sits right at the front by the conductor. Plays the violin solos.\n\nContralto\n\nThe lowest female voice. True contralto roles are relatively rare in opera.\n\nCountertenor\n\nThe highest male voice, usually singing in the range of a contralto or mezzo-soprano. Achieved in most cases through the use of falsetto.\n\nCurtain Call\n\nAfter the main applause at the end of a performance, sometimes the principals and conductor will come out for a final series of bows after the curtain has fallen. These are done in front of the curtain hence the term! Less frequent than they used to be (but still wildly popular at ballet performances).\n\nD\n\nDa Capo Aria\n\nA very specific Baroque form of aria. Written in a ternary form, ABA, with the A and B sections significantly contrasting.\n\nDirector\n\nThe director is in charge of everything that happens on stage. He instructs the performers and provides the overall vision for the production. Also known as the Regisseur (in French and German houses).\n\nDress Rehearsal\n\nThe final rehearsal in which all the production elements, including orchestra, sets and costumes, come together. The aim is to have one complete, unbroken run through before the audience comes for opening night.\n\nDuet\n\nMusic written for two performers to sing together.\n\nDynamics\n\nThe musical term for volume.\n\nO\n\nOpera Buffa\n\nA \"comic\" opera. A popular genre of opera during the 18th Century. The characters were largely ordinary, contemporary people, the plots light and frothy.\n\nOpera Seria\n\nA \"serious\" opera. A popular genre of opera during the 18th Century. The characters were largely gods and ancient heros, the plots epic and formulaic.\n\nOperetta\n\nA type of light opera. Popular from the mid-19th Century until the 1930s these are generally shorter and funnier than conventional operas. There are many styles but most have spoken dialogue and dance sequences. Somewhat of a transitional form to modern musical theatre.\n\nOratorio\n\nA dramatic work for orchestra, chorus and soloists that unlike opera was principally written to be performed in concert. The genre is predominantly made up of works with serious religious themes.\n\nOrchestra\n\nThe group of musicians who perform the music of the opera. During the Baroque period they were conventionally a string and woodwind group but over the history of opera the orchestra has expanded greatly to the modern standard which includes a full complement of brass and percussion.\n\nOrnamentation\n\nDecorative additional notes such as trills and appogiaturas that enhance the basic melody.\n\nOverture\n\nThe musical introduction to the evening. The overture frequently includes elements of the score that is to follow. The German word is Vorspiel.\n\nP\n\nPatter\n\nA rapid flurry of singing, with many words crammed into the musical line.\n\nPit\n\nThe sunken area between the audience and the stage where the orchestra sits.\n\nPortamento\n\nAn italian term for the vocal technique of sliding from one pitch to another continuously, rather than jumping between the two.\n\nPrompter\n\nA person who sits in a small box at the front of the stage and gives cues to the performers. Something of a relic these days, many of the major houses no longer have a prompter, requiring the singers to actually learn their parts!\n\nProscenium\n\nAlmost all opera houses are procenium theatres. The proscenium arch is the frame around the stage (often golden) that divides the audience from the performers.\n\nT\n\nTessitura\n\nThe core range of a specific role. A soprano role might have a low tessitura, i.e. though it lies within the soprano range the majority of the part lies at the low end of the soprano range.\n\nThrough-composed opera\n\nOperas that consist of continuous music without breaks for recitive or spoken dialogue. Largely the standard from the 19th Century onwards (and popularised in 20th century musical theatre by Andrew Lloyd-Webber and Claude-Michel Schönberg).\n\nToi Toi Toi\n\nA popular operatic way of saying good luck (think 'Break A Leg' as the theatrical equivalent). The etymology of this is a bit fuzzy, possibly something to do with spitting or curses. Pronounced ‘toy toy toy’ rather than ‘twah twah twah’ as you might expect.\n\nTrouser role\n\nAlso known as a pants part, these are male roles for female singers. Came to prominence in the 19th Century with the abandonment of Castrati."
