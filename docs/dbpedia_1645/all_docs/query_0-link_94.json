Their thoughts and talk are interrupted now and again by the radio, “compelling them to pay attention to a common world of great slaughter and much sorrow.”1 The men initially think mostly of battle. The woman of a concert: “To war-­orphans and widowed ladies, Grieving in gloves.”2 The quartet of characters who people W. H. Auden’s The Age of Anxiety (1947) reflect the poet’s observation that during wartime “everybody is reduced to the anxious status of a shady character or of a displaced person.”3 That displacement need not be literal, although many—including Auden himself, who had left England for the United States in 1939—found themselves in new countries and new situations. It could also have to do with the way in which the modern world was mediated: through the disembodied voices of radio broadcasts, or the combination of mourning and musical appreciation signified by applause muted by fashion both artistic and sartorial. Amongst all that was new, there was concern for the old. This book follows the fortunes of a musical genre whose future in twentieth-­century America and Britain was also uncertain: lieder, or German art song. By the late 1930s, this small-­scale, primarily romantic form was akin to a musical refugee. Those who engaged with lieder—performers, listeners, critics, and scholars—may have been anxious about how the repertoire might survive the vicissitudes of international politics and the technologies of mass culture. Yet the mobility and 1\n\n2 I n t r od uct ion\n\nadaptability of these songs and their singers enabled them not only to survive, but to stand as symbols of hope for what the sociologist Norbert Elias termed “the civilizing process.” Anxiety and civilization run as dual themes throughout the following chapters, refracting some of the major preoccupations of the interwar period in Europe and the United States that pertain to lieder: nationalism and internationalism, and their ugly cousins xenophobia and racism; the status of high-­culture and “leisured” society and aspirations to share it with and spare it from other classes; and the impact of this “first media age” on social activities, including live music making.4 It may seem strange to claim that a book about five white, male, Austro-­German composers of the nineteenth century—Franz Schubert (1797–1828), Robert Schumann (1810–1856), Johannes Brahms (1833–1897), Hugo Wolf (1860–1903), and Richard Strauss (1864–1949)—presents a decentered account of a period in musical and cultural history. However, this is an unusual study of the interwar years in New York and London: my concern is not with large-­scale institutions—opera houses or symphony halls—nor is its focus on modernism or popular music, which receive the lion’s share of scholarly attention.5 Moreover, this is not a book about composers, nor would I like to think of it as reception history in the traditional sense, which, as Daniel Cavicchi explains, continues to privilege works as drivers of musical culture.6 Instead, this is what the historian of science David Edgerton would call a “use-­history.”7 His point is that older technologies continue to be used despite the historian’s emphasis on the new (his most often cited example is horses on battlefields alongside tanks). Along similar lines, I am writing not about new music, but about repertoire that was learned, sung, and listened to in regular concerts—about what constituted everyday concert life for members of a certain social class (and, occasionally, beyond them). I am also concerned with the ways in which new media—recordings, radio, and sound film—interacted with live performance and vice versa, rather than treating them as separate activities. This book might still be taken as a narrative about canon formation. More than that, though, it illustrates the precarious fortunes of those canons. Lieder fell out of Anglo-­American recitalists’ repertoire during the First World War, and it was not until after the Second that they came to be as respected as they are today. One of the main findings of this book is that, rather than reaching back to nineteenth-­ century practices, it was during the 1920s and ’30s that the performance culture surrounding lieder with which we are now familiar came into being. Singing in the Age of Anxiety grew out of my survey of the song cycle, from\n\nA n Anx io us Age\n\n3\n\nwhich I discovered that the interwar period was transformative for performance practices because of the spread of technology and because of tensions between what appeared to be an idiom defined to a large extent by its national identity within an international context.8 What was a paragraph or two became a project that offers insights not only about the Anglo-­ American reception of lieder, but also about musical life during the first half of the twentieth century. Within its generic, temporal, and geographic limits, this is a book about how musical performance can articulate identity, about the evolution of recording technologies and modes of listening, and about hierarchies of taste. The discussion is necessarily wide-­ranging, and an introduction to its themes and sources, as well as the book’s structure, may be helpful before delving into its main chapters, which, while arranged in loosely chronological order, concentrate on particular topics: the reintroduction of German music and musicians to New York and London after the First World War; issues of language and listening practices raised by the presentation of lieder in concerts, recordings, radio broadcasts, and films; the social standing of classical song; and attitudes to German music and musicians from the 1930s until the aftermath of the Second World War. \n\nAuden’s The Age of Anxiety, according to the literary scholar Edward Men­ delson, ends with “an almost instinctive wish for a shared community we can imagine but never achieve.”9 The notion of imagined communities has been a powerful positive concept for many scholarly accounts of the way nations are defined and culture is shared around the world.10 Anxiety about the ramifications of nation and culture being fragmented or, indeed, united was shared by many writers and commentators of the time. For example, Erich Maria Remarque left Germany in 1933, eventually making his way to the United States.11 His unfinished novel The Promised Land depicted refugees striving to make a new life in New York. One such character is Robert Hirsch, who had fought for the French resistance and now manages a small appliance shop. He takes the narrator with him to shake down another Jewish émigré for money. On being asked how it is possible to intimidate anyone now they are no longer in Nazi Germany but “the land of the free,” Hirsch responds: “Haven’t you understood yet that we are living in the age of anxiety? The age of real and imaginary fear? [. . .] And that as emigrants we’re never going to be able to shake this fear, whatever happens?”12 Yet it was not only emigrants who felt anxious. The anxiety of displacement was also existential. German philosopher Martin Heidegger, in\n\n4 I n t r od uct ion\n\nhis 1927 tract Sein und Zeit (Being and Time), described anxiety (Angst) as a state of hovering, of feeling detached from the world in the face of the infinite, of being at once nothing and nowhere. A striking aspect of the 1920s and ’30s—particularly in Europe, but also in the United States—is that the notion of this being an “interwar” period is not a retrospective construct: it was felt at the time.13 Although after 1918 many tried not to mention the war, and to distract themselves with all manner of entertainments, beneath the gaiety there was perpetual dread that the horrors might return. References to being anxious abound in texts on everything from performance nerves to music’s therapeutic properties to the perils of cosmopolitanism. There were, as the historian Richard Overy has discussed, “networks of anxiety” manifested in a preoccupation with the destruction of what was referred to as “civilization.”14 Writing in the 1920s, Norbert Elias was careful to distinguish between Kultur and Zivilisation.15 Kultur, he explained, referred to human products, such as works of arts, books, religious or philosophical systems; it was a uniquely German concept that played an important role in nation building (which had taken place relatively late in Germany), and it paid little heed to attitudes or behavior. Zivilisation, by contrast, played down national differences by emphasizing commonalities among all human beings.16 It was the purview of those people, Elias explained, “whose national boundaries and national identity have for centuries been so fully established that they have ceased to be the subject of any particular discussion, peoples which have long expanded outside their borders and colonized beyond them”: in other words, the British and French. Elias acknowledged that the function of the German concept of Kultur took on new life as the First World War raged, for the Allies fought in the name of “civilization.” It is a word that will recur throughout this book, in situations as diverse as explorations of “hotel civilization” to antifascist rhetoric, and with certain kinds of music—not always those associated with Kultur—being co-­opted as symbols of civilization. Other writers, from other countries, may have used slightly different terms from those chosen by Elias, but the polarity of national and supranational remained.17 For the English art critic and member of the Bloomsbury group Clive Bell, the meaning of civilization was social and artistic, encapsulated, after the savagery of the war, in “the artificial pleasures of a fashionable dinner party, where we can sit and rail in security against the unheroic quietude of civilized life.”18 “A man or woman entirely insensitive to all the arts can barely be deemed civilized,” Bell claimed, with all the condescen-\n\nA n Anx io us Age\n\n5\n\nsion of his class. He conceded, however, that the civilized person was not born but made. The civilizing process went hand in hand with an impulse toward arts education during the interwar period. The nurture of a civilized sensibility thereby had a conflicted relationship with what many perceived as another threat to peace and quiet: mass media.19 Arts educators would attempt to harness the forces of broadcasting and the record industry to improve the taste of the general public; at the same time, as will be seen, there was a drive to protect certain music and modes of being from the hoi polloi. Joseph Horowitz argues that the Great War shattered “the concept of civilization as pursuant to truth and beauty”; that the “rhetoric of uplift” that had accompanied classical music in America’s Gilded Age rang hollow, particularly after it was co-­opted by European dictators for a very different type of cultural, communal catharsis.20 Although repertoire was co-­ opted to political ends, it was not only by dictators. The ability of music to forge communities, to raise morale, and to bolster propaganda during wartime was recognized by both sides. However, as this book demonstrates, the ways in which classical music was used, rhetorically and affectively, during the First and Second World Wars fundamentally contrasted. That said, there were historical continuities between and beyond the outbreak of hostilities. What constitutes “between the wars,” in other words, needs to be defined loosely. Both wars were cataclysmic, but while they may have accelerated some things and curtailed others, certain practices and people remained. In order to explain attitudes and activities after 1918, it is necessary to say something about what happened beforehand; in order to comprehend the import of 1945, its aftermath needs to be acknowledged (note that Auden’s The Age of Anxiety was written not during but following the war). In terms of geographical coverage, New York and London may seem an odd couple of cities through which to consider the performance culture of German song. As wealthy metropolitan centers they were “beyond both city and nation”;21 neither can really be taken as representative of American or British attitudes, and a quite different story would be told by looking at, say, Chicago or Manchester, Atlantic City or Lyme Regis. It is worth clarifying that, within London, discussion focuses on the West End, where most venues were located; for similar reasons, in New York City attention is primarily on midtown Manhattan.22 Comparing these two centers is revealing of shared attitudes and significant differences. Both cities were known as international hubs for the performance of classical music. Both had complicated relationships with German culture: New York, because of its historically large Germanic population and the prominent role that\n\n6 I n t r od uct ion\n\ncommunity played in musical and philanthropic life; London, because its relative geographical proximity meant that it could fear German invasion of a militaristic as well as a cultural kind, and because of long-­standing connections with German society (not least the royal family). Britain and the United States were, of course, allies in both world wars and shared a common language. Yet, as the divergences in how they dealt with songs of their enemy illustrate, they defined themselves as much against each other as they did in response to the shared threat of Germany.23 New York and London were, throughout this period, important nodes on the transatlantic musical network.24 Typically, a German or Austrian singer wanting to expand his or her reputation internationally would venture from Berlin or Vienna to London and from there to New York. (There were other European nodes, of course—Paris and Amsterdam being the most obvious—but they are beyond the scope of this study.) This was not to say, however, that travel went only one way: American artists continued to visit Europe, and Europeans often returned home, so long as the political situation allowed. Thinking of the relationship between the two cities within the transatlantic unit helps nuance questions of national difference and exceptionalism: as Daniel T. Rodgers argues, the ocean functioned “less as a barrier than as a connective lifeline—a seaway for the movement of people, goods, ideas, and aspirations.”25 The transactional nature of musical life is at the heart of my first chapter, which takes as its starting point the role of the transatlantic liner as what Stephen Greenblatt would call a “contact zone,” where cultural goods are exchanged. The goods in question here were songs and their singers, who mingled at ship’s concerts with a freedom prohibited on land by wartime politics. “It is impossible to understand mobility without understanding the glacial weight of what appears bounded and static,” writes Greenblatt, and the arrivals and departures of the musicians discussed were freighted with significance.26 The contralto Ernestine Schumann-­Heink returned to New York after the First World War, determined to reintroduce the performance of songs in German; the tenor Roland Hayes arrived in London to start a long career as one of the most prominent African American classical singers of the age; the composer Richard Strauss and the soprano Elisabeth Schumann commenced an American tour that demonstrated the continuing influence and prestige of German music in New York, as well as the financial allure of “Dollarland.”27 Chapter 2 turns from studies of individual singers to questions of repertoire and the debates over which songs should be sung, by whom, and in\n\nA n Anx io us Age\n\n7\n\nwhat language. Those questions were asked not only in New York and London concert halls after 1918, when hearing the enemy’s vernacular, never mind enemy musicians, was resisted. They were also asked as lieder began to be heard on gramophone recordings and radio broadcasts, and in sound films. The plurality of media, and their points of (dis)connection, are important to take into account, not only in relation to each other but with regard to their intersections with live performance. Songs were encountered—“used,” to borrow again from Edgerton—in numerous different spaces and formats. While their message may, pace Marshall McLuhan, have been inflected by their medium, the ways in which these different versions and experiences overlapped are vital to the understanding of the significance of lieder. How to access that understanding, however, remains a challenge. Cavicchi notes that research into the aesthetic lives of listeners is rare; the reason, surely, is the limitations of available sources.28 There might be access to diaries, memoirs, and correspondence that report directly on a musical experience; these are scarce, though, and it is likely that the kinds of comments made are about practical and personal aspects such as who the writer saw or the difficulties he or she experienced in traveling, rather than about the qualities of the performance. It is rarer still to find someone describing hearing lieder on the wireless or at the cinema; yet, increasingly, music was consumed at home rather than in the concert hall, and it is evident that experience informed interpretations in other situations.29 One is left, then, with published criticism, compared with the archives of venues, management companies, and other institutions to check claims about audience sizes, financial matters, and details of programs. This is not disastrous, for the interwar period saw a flowering of arts criticism in Britain and the United States.30 As well as specialist periodicals, mainstream newspapers— broadsheet and tabloid alike—covered concerts and musical news to an extent unthinkable now. 31 In such a competitive market and a time of so much political upheaval, they were bound to be partisan. The role of big-­ name critics as gatekeepers was underscored in London by the fact that all the critics sat in the same rows at concerts: the Musical Mirror and Fanfare described them as slouching into Queen’s Hall, “looking like retired parsnips obliged to inspect the drains against their better judgement” (it has to be said that critics then were allowed much greater freedom in the excoriation of their subjects).32 Many did not limit themselves to reviewing but also wrote books: Ernest Newman, who had gained his first full-­time position as a critic at the age of fifty, after the First World War, served as the\n\n8 I n t r od uct ion\n\nObserver’s London critic before becoming chief music critic of the Sunday Times. His book length studies of the German composers Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss, and the Austrian Hugo Wolf, were hugely influential in persuading readers of their music’s merits. Richard Capell wrote for the Daily Mail for twenty years before moving to the Daily Telegraph in 1931. Despite both papers’ famously warmongering, anti-­German stance, he covered song recitals extensively and authored the first English-­language monograph on Schubert’s songs.33 Richard Aldrich presided at the New York Times from 1902 until 1923 and also wrote on Wagner, as well as working with the tetchy critic for the New York Tribune, Henry Edward Krehbiel, on the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.34 Aldrich was replaced at the New York Times by Olin Downes, who remained chief music critic until 1955 as well as chairing the Metropolitan Opera Quiz on the radio. In other words, critics were gatekeepers not only in the concert hall but of various music-­appreciation projects, be they monographs or broadcasts. The long tenures of Newman, Capell, Aldrich, and Downes also means that there is a relatively steady stream of their views through the interwar period, against which the opinions of less established voices—some of whom wrote anonymously or were only named by their initials—can be judged. The sense of there being establishment and peripheral voices within music criticism, as well as specialist and generalist ones, also applied to venues within New York and London and, in some ways, to performers. Lieder were sung in the home, by amateurs, students, and at informal musical gatherings (including high-­society “at homes”), seemingly continuing nineteenth-­century practices.35 Usually those activities can only be glimpsed in historical sources, with exceptional happenings noted more often than the day-­to-­day. More public and better documented renditions, by professional and aspiring singers, took place most regularly at moderately sized concert halls built in the early twentieth century, such as the Wigmore Hall (London) or Town Hall (New York), or at the various piano showrooms (Steinway, Aeolian) with attached recital spaces.36 Lieder also appeared, however, in huge venues such as the Royal Albert Hall in London, and Carnegie Hall and even the Hippodrome in Manhattan; then they were almost invariably sung by well-­established stars. It is worth remembering, however, that these venues were all available for hire, if one could afford it (hence Florence Foster Jenkins’s notorious Carnegie Hall recital in October 1944).37 There had been a shift, by the 1920s, away from the “hybrid” recital—\n\nA n Anx io us Age\n\n9\n\nwhich presented a mixture of genres and ensembles—toward the “group” recital, which divided the program into sections according to historical period and place. (Occasionally singers still shared programs with an instrumentalist, usually a violinist or pianist.) Typically, that meant that a recital began with “early” music (Italian arias, Handel, Bach), followed by a group of lieder, then a group of songs from another country, and finally something lighter: popular airs, folk songs, or spirituals. The geographical range was often determined by the singer’s ethnic background, although demonstrating mastery of different languages increasingly was thought to be a sign of good training. Very few singers gave dedicated lieder recitals. On the one hand, this type of programming meant that when German song fell out of favor, during the First World War, it was easily replaced. On the other hand, it also meant that it was rare for larger-­scale works to be performed onstage. Only with the celebrations around Beethoven’s and Schubert’s centenaries in 1927 and 1928 respectively did the marketing strategies of gramophone companies, the educational projects of broadcasters, the proliferation of music journalism, and willing singers converge to foster a receptive audience for complete song cycles. As chapter 3 explores, another important environment for the performance and consumption of lieder in Manhattan were clubs and societies dedicated either to music or to a particular social group. These semi-­private affairs—accessible by invitation or subscription—were often hosted by another phenomenon of the early twentieth century, which transformed definitions of public space: the luxury hotel. Several of the clubs, such as the Bagby Musical Mornings, had been founded before the war and might have been expected to have died out in the Jazz Age; their persistence illuminates both historical continuities and the influence of especially the women of “old” New York within the modern city. Clubs and hotels also hosted concerts in London. The London Lieder Club, for example, was founded in 1933 as “back-­up” to a new recording venture, the subscription-­based Hugo Wolf Society. The series exemplified the complex ways in which live and recorded music intersected, and how what might be thought of as older practices were shaped, indeed in many ways created, by new media. Projects to re­cord the collected works of composers, sung in the original language, encouraged the type of dedicated recital promoted by the London Lieder Club. The texts around these recordings—program notes and criticism—put forward a particular kind of informed, attentive listening as desirable, which transferred to the concert hall. The notion of what now seems to be the traditional approach to lieder\n\n10 I n t r od uct ion\n\nperformance—in concert dress, in the original language—arguably resulted from new technologies and the proliferation of writing about music in the interwar period. The influx of German and Austrian musicians arriving in London in the 1930s was still more influential, for they brought with them performance practices from Vienna and Berlin; notably, the model of the dedicated lieder recital or Liederabend.38 It was the best of these performers who were hired to re­cord for the Hugo Wolf Society and to sing at the London Lieder Club. Around them grew a culture of specialist interpretation. There was, inevitably, an explicitly political angle, for many of these musicians stayed in the country as refugees from the Nazi regime. Chapter 4 explains how, while lieder continued to be associated with Germanic culture, in contrast to British and American attitudes during the First World War, they were no longer approached as songs of the enemy. Instead, the songs of Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, Wolf, and even, up to a point, Strauss became symbols of a civilization in danger of being destroyed by fascism. Throughout the course of the Second World War, classical music was mobilized as a vehicle for cultural uplift and morale boosting. Twenty years earlier it would have been unthinkable for lieder to have been on wartime concert programs in London and New York, particularly sung in German. This time round, though, they were heard at flagship series such as the National Gallery concerts. There were objections to particular performers—Kirsten Flagstad’s return to New York after the war, for instance, was greeted with protests because her husband had been a member of Norway’s Nazi party—but attitudes to repertoire generally were more open. One further case study in this concluding chapter, though, serves as a reminder that while lieder may have become an accepted part of musical life, prejudices against performers were prompted not only by war: Marian Anderson gave a concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1939, in effect protesting racial segregation; while she was heard by millions over the radio and received enthusiastically in New York shortly afterward, it was not until 1955 that she appeared as the first African American singer to be hired by the Metropolitan Opera.39 The contrast between what could be achieved in recital and what might be acceptable on the operatic stage points to the myriad ways in which lieder were used between the wars and the “songwork,” to borrow Gary Tomlinson’s term, that they executed.40 Modest in scale, they slipped between private and public spheres and between categories of high-­, low-­,\n\nA n Anx io us Age\n\n11\n\nand—a term invented in the interwar period—middlebrow. Part of the challenge of this project has been trying to account for the multiple identities in whose name lieder were sung and for the many ways in which they were heard and interpreted. The sounds of the singers discussed in these pages are likewise elusive: although many were captured on record, listening to them now is desperately compromised by the limitations of technology and current tastes.41 For that reason, their aesthetic qualities are rarely described in what follows; but I hope that readers may be encouraged to seek out some of the recordings—many of which are now available as reissues or online—and to listen, if not quite with a period ear, then with a richer understanding of their motivations and contingencies.42 Recordings and, with them, radio and film promised to expand markets for lieder nationally and internationally. Their increased dissemination boosted postwar claims for the “universal” qualities of classical music. The centrality within that universe of the Austro-­German tradition is surprising only in that there might have been expected to be continued resistance to the music of those who had been the enemy (as there was, of course, from some factions).43 Nationalism was a powerful and increasingly aggressive force during the interwar period. However, it was challenged by the self-­conscious development of internationalist projects that, Akira Iriye argues, strove to achieve peace through political, economic, and cultural exchange.44 A term often associated with the latter was “cosmopolitanism,” which surfaces occasionally in the following chapters as a description of activities with an international aspect that may also imply something about the outlook of those involved.45 Quite what that outlook was is sometimes ambiguous. Cosmopolitanism might have been egalitarian in principle but in practice typically has depended on the social, economic, and cultural mobility of the elite.46 It has, according to Amanda Anderson, articulated intellectual and ethical “ideals for the cultivation of character and for negotiating the experience of otherness.”47 The performance culture of lieder in London and New York during the interwar period was in many ways inherently cosmopolitan, for it enmeshed ideas about cultural and social improvement within what was often an international environment. However, this was an age acutely aware—anxious, even—about national identity and difference. Civilization did not mean the erasure or leveling of those identities, but respect for and engagement with other nations. “Auch kleine Dinge können teuer sein”—even little things can be precious—the poet Paul Heyse reminds us in the first song of Hugo Wolf ’s\n\n12 I nt r od uct ion\n\nItalienisches Liederbuch. The story of transatlantic musical life during the interwar years, as told through the performance and reception of lieder, yields no grand, overarching narrative. It does, however, intersect with concerns about the importance of art and culture, within and beyond an individual’s own nation and social group, which remain key to evaluating what might be meant by civilization today.\n\nOne\n\nTransatlantic Arrivals\n\n“The boat has not only been for our civilization [. . .] the great instrument of economic development [. . .] but has been simultaneously the greatest reserve of the imagination.” —Michel Foucault, “Of Other Spaces” (1986)\n\nB\n\netween the world wars, transatlantic travel between Europe and the United States held a special place in the imagination of the cultural elite. It represented a temporal rift, both between old and new worlds, and because—before flight became routine—it took on average six days to make the journey by steam ship.1 Time, then, to dream and to be bored; time to be entertained. Music played a significant role on board.2 There were hired orchestras and dance bands, and it was customary for cabin and first-­class passengers to give a concert, typically for nautically themed charities. The diary that the German soprano Elisabeth Schumann kept during her American tour with Richard Strauss—of which more later—conveys the voyage’s tedium and its potential for discomfort or luxury, depending on one’s class of ticket. On their first evening aboard the SS Adriatic (19 October 1921) she recorded: “I am lying in a narrow, wobbly cabin.” Franz Strauss came by to say that the Russian bass Fyodor Chaliapin was on board, sharing a bottle of wine with his father and offering to find them better quarters. After two 13\n\n14\n\nC h apt er One\n\ndays of fatigue and headaches, Schumann was finally able to enjoy herself: “Wonderful day, sunshine, completely calm sea, great boredom. I completely forgot to mention that we already met [Lucrezia] Bori on the train from Paris to Cherbourg. We don’t see much of Chaliapin; he sits all morning in the Turkish bath, and unfortunately only speaks French, not English.”3 Despite, or perhaps because of, the language barrier the musicians seem to have spent the remainder of their journey playing poker together. On the penultimate evening, 25 October, they gave a charity concert for the widows and orphans of sailors. Schumann recorded that she “had a great success with three Strauss songs. Chaliapin also sang. Wonderful artist. Unfortunately not quite on top form any more. Then a lady played a violin sonata by Strauss too.” Few transatlantic passengers were treated to such impressive programs; the musicians on board were more often amateurs or less well-­known professionals, and those instances when an opera company or famous soloists were on board were noted as significant (the German soprano Frieda Hempel recalled in her memoirs that on a 1922 trip to New York the passengers of the SS Olympic heard the three Hs: herself, the pianist Josef Hofmann, and the violinist Bronislaw Huberman, who, together with—yet again—Chaliapin, raised an unprecedented $3000 for the Seamen’s Fund).4 Whoever performed, the concerts were striking for their wide-­ranging programs: in the cabin dining saloon of Cunard’s R.M.S. Alaunia on 20 March 1934, the program was light and varied: the ship’s orchestra played Franz von Suppé’s Poet and Peasant overture and “Capstan and Windlass,” a medley of sea shanties by Ernest Reeves; there were solos on the musical saw, cello, and Hawaiian guitar; turns by comedians and a dancer; a recitation; and “O, Donna Clara” and “You’re Gonna Lose Your Girl,” sung in German by a Miss Gerda Drebing.5 In October 1938 Lisa Reitler, the wife of a Viennese Jewish banker and a friend of Elisabeth Schumann, fled Nazi-­occupied Austria for New York. She described the concert during her voyage as “just like being in Paris”: she was accompanied by the “wonderful pianist” Myra Hess; there were a tenor and a lyric soprano from the Chicago Opera; “and afterwards cabaret artists, a banjo player who’s just done a big tour of Africa, then a pair who did some apache dances.”6 It is apparent from such lists that, while liners may have reinforced social boundaries according to the different classes of passengers, they were ideal spaces for chance meetings between nations and cultures. Although inherently cosmopolitan, the entertainments available were also intended to introduce passengers to their destinations, for instance\n\nTrans atl an t ic A r r i va l s\n\n15\n\nthrough special restaurant menus that offered either a taste of home or an indication of unknown pleasures to come. An advertisement for United States Lines described their ships as “America Afloat”: All bound for America and already in America—afloat. Going home and already home. They find themselves each other’s friends—fellow citizens of a floating city. Their club is the smoking room. Their sports grounds: the great decks, the swimming pool and gymnasium. They go on shopping expeditions—there are fine shops on board. They dance, dine, go to film shows. They live on board a few full memorable days— and then they reach New York.\n\nThat life on board might replicate and perhaps exceed what would be offered on arrival encourages us to view these ships as what Michel Foucault would call heterotopic spaces: sites that, unlike utopias, actually exist, but that represent, contest, and invert reality, primarily through juxtaposing incompatible elements. Indeed, Foucault cites the boat—“a floating piece of space, a place without a place”—as the “heterotopia par excellence.”7 Hans-­Ulrich Gumbrecht argues that transatlantic travel during the 1920s (particularly from the United States to Europe) signified “ultimate refinement in lifestyle and culture,” with ocean liners becoming opportunities for displays of cultural capital and technological advancements.8 Theatrical entertainments and concerts on board—despite or even because of their class associations—were an integral part of this imaginary civilized cosmopolitanism.9 But all ships return to port eventually, and, particularly during times of conflict, their arrivals could be sharply political. Each of the next three sections takes as its starting point the disembarkation of musicians in New York or London as a means of illustrating the ways in which the First World War impacted musical life on both sides of the Atlantic. Their organization is loosely chronological. First, I consider American attitudes toward German music and musicians during the hostilities, through the examples of the German-­American contralto Ernestine Schumann-­Heink, the Irish-­American tenor John McCormack, and the multiple identities of Louis Graveure. Second, I illustrate how similar attitudes influenced approaches to repertoire and performance in London in the immediate aftermath of the war, taking as my guide the African American tenor Roland Hayes. The final chapter examines responses to the return of two German musicians, the composer Richard Strauss and the soprano Elisabeth Schumann, to New York in the early 1920s.\n\n16\n\nC h apt er One\n\n“The Time to Sing German Songs” (Ernestine Schumann-­Heink) The Dutch accompanist Coenraad Bos recalled traveling by steamship to New York from Europe shortly after the First World War. The famous contralto Ernestine Schumann-­Heink was also on board and, as was the custom on transatlantic trips, they planned a concert. Among their fellow travelers was a Swiss choral group. Bos was horrified to discover the titles of the songs they proposed to sing: “Du, deutscher Rhein,” “Mein Vaterland,” and so on. At that time, he explained, “the performance of music with German text, and frequently of German composers,” was out of favor. He asked Schumann-­Heink what to do: she told him not to print the titles on the program; she would handle it. (She herself, “realizing the delicacy of the situation,” had planned to sing an Italian aria and some English songs.) At the concert Schumann-­Heink said to the audience: “You are going to hear a group of songs by the Swiss Singing Society. The language in which they sing sounds like German. But it is not German! Please don’t shoot them! ” Whereupon they sang, “in the plainest German,” “Mein Vaterland” and “Du, deutscher Rhein,” and, commented Bos, it “was a great success: if anyone was the wiser, nothing was said.” “Shortly after this,” Bos continued, Schumann-­Heink sang in Newark, New Jersey. For the first time, after the war, she included German lieder by Brahms, purposely as a final group on the program. The audience numbered some 4000 people. Just prior to beginning the closing group, Schumann-­Heink announced: “The war is over. The time to sing German songs is here. If there are any in the audience who do not wish to hear them, they may leave now.”\n\nAnd quietly, without demonstration, about two hundred people left the auditorium.10 These anecdotes illustrate the complex cultural negotiations musicians undertook in order to reestablish themselves after the war. Schumann-­ Heink’s willingness to pretend that the language in which the Swiss choir sang was not German was in keeping with the knowing playfulness of the performance situation.11 It seems that the degree to which the ship’s audience cared about the “politics” of the music they heard was negligible, as if while on board they were subsumed by the transatlantic rather than beholden to any particular place. It also demonstrates a determination on Schumann-­Heink’s part to continue as best she could, whatever the cir-\n\nTrans atl an t ic A r r i va l s\n\n17\n\ncumstances; an attribute well borne out by other incidents in her long and varied career. The large audience that welcomed her onshore in Newark was not unusual for a singer of her stature. However, it is striking that many listeners were not prepared to accept all the repertoire she offered because they still felt offended by the prospect of hearing the German language. The United States may not have been threatened by military attack at home to the same degree as her allies, but there had been the enemy within: the large Germanic populations of metropolitan centers such as New York and Chicago, whose cultural authority was established through money, language, and music. German immigration to the United States peaked in the mid-­nineteenth century, spurred by economic depression and political uncertainty in central Europe and the promise of fresh opportunities in the New World (after all, the most famous dynasties in New York, the Astors and the Waldorfs, were of German heritage). By 1910 New York was, next to Berlin, the largest German city in the world, even if midwestern cities such as Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Chicago had higher per capita German immigrant populations.12 There was a seemingly separate German world in New York, divided into neighborhoods according to when residents had arrived, or their religion (a large proportion of the German community was Jewish, for they hoped to find greater tolerance across the Atlantic; Brahms’s collaborator George Henschel explained that he decided in part to settle in London to escape Prussian anti-­Semitism).13 Before the war, many second-­generation Germans lived in Harlem. After the war, one commentator complained: Harlem! The old Harlem is dead. [. . .] All the Gemütlichkeit of it is gone. Gone are the comfortable Weinstüben where one could smoke his pipe and peacefully drink his Rhein wine. Gone is the old Liedertafel and the hundred-­and-­one social organizations, and the Turnvereins and the singing clubs where one could pass the evening peacefully. They have all moved elsewhere, and the new places do not have the atmosphere of the old ones. It used to be so pleasant to pass a Harlem street on a summer evening. The young ladies were accompanying their Lieder with the twanging of the soft zither, and the stirring robust melodies from the Lutheran churches used to fill the air on a Sunday. It is all gone now.14\n\nThe account is implicitly racist: Harlem has become black, noisy, and selfish.15 It is the nostalgic description of German identity within the city that\n\n18\n\nC h apt er One\n\nis of interest, however. There is an emphasis on socializing, be it through wine bars or societies and clubs, and on musicality—communal and individual. Finally, there is the sprinkling of German terms, marked as other by the use of italics but not translated or explained. Migrants had come from many different German-­speaking lands; language—in the city of New York, Hochdeutsch, not dialect—was their most obvious commonality and so became “the major indicator of ethnic belonging.”16 Language and, evidently, music. The majority of studies of German-­ American musical identities have focused on folk and choral singing, which helped to maintain the coherence of immigrant communities.17 Classical music was part of that continuum of music making, but complicated categorization by ethnic identity because of the core role German and Austrian repertoire had long played in transatlantic concert life. Neither the United States nor Britain was known as a musical nation, although they were major importers (to the consternation of those who favored the aesthetic and economic development of home-­grown talent). Germans were not the only nationalities who took advantage of Anglo-­American markets—Italians and Russians were also prominent, particularly in opera—but they dominated the classical music scene in many American cities, particularly where there were large German populations.18 A few conductors were particularly influential in terms of repertoire and infrastructure. Leopold Damrosch, once Liszt’s concertmaster at Weimar, arrived in New York in 1871 to take over the Arion Society’s male chorus; he soon founded the New York Oratorio Society and the New York Symphony. On his death in 1885 his son Walter literally took up his baton; he would prove one of the most influential musicians in the city, not least because of his ability to befriend wealthy patrons such as Andrew Carnegie, whom he would persuade to build a concert hall.19 Another German-­trained conductor, Anton Seidl, like Damrosch, promoted the operas of Richard Wagner at the socially exclusive Metropolitan Opera House and through populist concerts on Coney Island. Even those orchestras not conducted by Germans were substantially peopled by musicians of German origin: by 1890 they constituted 90 percent of the New York Philharmonic. German musicians were visible not only as performers: instrument makers, such as the Steinway piano company, were well established, and there were countless music teachers who advertised that they were of German extraction or had trained abroad.20 The historian Jessica Gienow-­Hecht claims that five thousand Americans studied music in Germany between 1850 and 1900; the New York Times calculated that be-\n\nTrans atl an t ic A r r i va l s\n\n19\n\nfore the First World War American families paid about $15 million annually to foreign countries (primarily Germany and Austria) for musical tuition.21 What distinguished German classical music making from that of other immigrant groups in the city was the seriousness with which it was taken. In the nineteenth-­century “sacralization” of high culture, it was not Verdi and Tchaikovsky but Beethoven and Wagner who were musical idols, to be revered in silence.22 The degree to which this new type of attentive (or at least reverent) listening was a form of social control will be discussed in a later chapter; here, the point is simply that these were German composers. They represented their nation’s Kultur, the singularity of which was emphasized in the anglophone press by the word’s remaining italicized and untranslated. The superiority accorded Kultur was evident throughout music criticism, and especially in German commentaries about American, typically popular, culture: for example, Wilhelm von Polenz criticized the so-­ called Land of the Future as trivial, stupefying, and mechanical.23 However, such voices were increasingly drowned out by the rapid spread of mass entertainment, the majority of New York’s German population proving no less susceptible than their American counterparts to the charms of baseball, vaudeville, and amusement parks. According to the literary historian Peter Conolly-­Smith, for Americans the First World War “sealed the tomb of Kultur.”24 German-­language theaters closed, German-­language newspapers folded (there were 488 in New York City in 1910, just 152 in 1920), and Germans endeavored to make themselves indistinguishable from “real” Americans. They signaled their assimilation, as they had flagged their difference, in no small part through language: sauerkraut became “liberty cabbage,” German measles (probably to the bemusement of the afflicted) became “liberty measles,” Coney Island’s Kaisergarten—a replica of the one in Munich—was renamed, and many Germans applied to alter their surnames ( just as the British royal family changed Saxe-­Coburg to Windsor). Several states prohibited German instruction in schools; California even ordered the removal of German folk songs from children’s music books.25 The power and influence of German musicians was also diminished by the United States’ entry into the war. In the eyes of many scholars, war was no watershed; rather, it simply sped up a process of assimilation begun by the spread of mass media, through which popular culture asserted its hegemony. Kultur’s tomb, however, was not sealed as tightly as some suggest. As we shall see, after the hiatus imposed by the war, Germans and musi-\n\n20\n\nC h a pt er One\n\ncians of German origin came once more to play a prominent role in Anglo-­ American concert life.26 The musical world certainly changed during the subsequent period, in response to the growth of the recording, radio, and film industries, which encouraged new modes of consumption and listening, and had the potential to broaden the dissemination of different repertoires. It was also, and again, impacted by global politics, as musicians dealt with economic crises and then the rise of fascism. Despite all this, German music somehow retained its central position in the Anglo-­American classical canon. Few artists were as adept at negotiating German-­American identities as Schumann-­Heink, whose career and family—were already transatlantic and for whom lieder remained a staple of her repertoire, no matter where she traveled or to whom she sang. Born Ernestine Rössler in 1861 to a German-­speaking family living near Prague, she met her first husband, Ernst Heink, when he was secretary of the Semperoper Dresden, where she had made her debut in 1878; they had four children before divorcing in 1893, after which she married Paul Schumann, with whom she had three more children. An actor and director at the Thalia Theater in Hamburg, he was credited with improving her dramatic delivery. Schumann-­Heink’s career had taken off at the Hamburg Opera in 1889, when she replaced the prima donna Maria Götze at the last minute (as Carmen, Fidès, and Ortrud on consecutive nights); she performed at the Bayreuth Festival between 1896 and 1914 and in 1899 made her first appearance at the Metropolitan (her last would be in 1932). Paul Schumann died in 1904; the following year Schumann-­Heink married her American manager, Paul Rapp. The couple lived together in New Jersey as Schumann-­Heink pursued a lengthy court case to try to reclaim some of her savings from Germany, which she had forfeited when she married a foreigner. She left her two oldest children, August and Charlotte, in Germany and became a naturalized American citizen in 1908. She and Rapp divorced in 1915 (fourteen years her junior, he was apparently jealous of the attention she paid her offspring), by which time she had settled in San Diego. Despite her new passport, there could be no doubt about Schumann-­ Heink’s German heritage. She was strongly associated with the music of Wagner and performed lieder on her extensive concert tours. Yet she was also keen to cultivate a popular following, and, while this partly concerned, as promotional materials put it, “arousing a love for classical songs among the masses,” she was—unlike some of her colleagues—willing to appear in less elevated venues. There she often played up her Germanness\n\nTrans atl an t ic A r r i va l s\n\n21\n\nto humorous effect: on Broadway, appearing in Julian Edwards’s operetta Love’s Lottery (1904), she broke off to ask the audience whether her English was satisfactory, and she hammed up her accent in later vaudeville appearances. Much has been written about the use of comedy as a means by which immigrant communities could assimilate, according to which the presentation of negative stereotypes enabled a disavowal of ethnic identity. Classical musicians could play a prominent part in this “community of laughter,” either by lampooning themselves or by being mimicked by others.27 So far as Schumann-­Heink and other native German speakers were concerned, humor seemed to derive from careless or unidiomatic English and—­particularly for listeners today—musical delivery. For example, at a concert in June 1915 Schumann-­Heink performed Mendelssohn, Schubert, Brahms, Wolf, Bizet, and Saint-­Saëns before ending with “The Star-­ Spangled Banner.” She had not, however, learned the words to the latter, which caused “some of her hearers to wonder in what language she was singing.”28 Listening to her recordings of the anthem we might wonder at the way her words are, at any rate, lost in her formidable vibrato, as well as her extensive use of rubato toward the climactic final note of the line “O’er the land of the free.” Schumann-­Heink saved face with regard to “The Star-­Spangled Banner” by claiming that she was eventually taught the words by an army captain. Still, her German-­American identity became more problematic as the war continued in Europe and threatened to cross the Atlantic; the way she navigated her career during this period illuminates the potential conflicts between the political situation and the musical community. As someone with family in Germany and the United States, she had sons fighting on both sides. The diary of her accompanist, Edith Evans Braun (1887–1976), reveals both the energy the singer devoted to looking after her family and career and the extent to which America’s entry into the war affected musical life.29 Schumann-­Heink’s fourth son, Hans, died of pneumonia in San Diego in early January 1916; by February she and Evans Braun were on a tour of the East Coast. On arriving in Washington, D.C., Schumann-­ Heink visited the German embassy to discuss her son August, who was serving in the navy (he died in his U-­boat in December 1918). The next day she sang for President Woodrow Wilson and his new wife at the White House; the duo then moved on to Atlantic City, where Schumann-­Heink wanted to meet a Judge Jerome to discuss the fortunes of another of her sons. Although Schumann-­Heink sometimes found it hard to perform— “I think memories proved too much for her and her grief is still too fresh,”\n\n22\n\nC h apt er One\n\nEvans Braun recorded of a morning concert on 14 February—she had a busy schedule. She sang Erda in Wagner’s Siegfried at the Metropolitan that month, as well as appearing at benefit concerts at the Ritz and the Hotel Astor and giving recitals in Connecticut, Atlantic City, and Philadelphia. The Astor benefit, Evans Braun noted, was a “real German fest” in which the Met stars Otto Goritz, Johanna Gadski, Johannes Sembach, Albert Reiss, and Carl Braun also participated. (Their sense of humor can be gleaned from a play they put on alongside the musical performances, which featured Goritz “dressed as [the cartoon character] Buster Brown with a pink suit and yellow wig and eyes made to look cross-­eyed. It was a scream!”)30 By March Schumann-­Heink was hoarse, but she continued concertizing at a similar rate. Although she was received enthusiastically at New York State’s Auburn correctional facility on 25 April, the organizers were said to be worried that her program contained too much German repertoire. In early May she thought, wrongly as it turned out, that war had been declared; to soothe her nerves she and Evans Braun went to the singer’s favorite spot, on the pier across from Maison de Paris in Atlantic City: “We sat there for a long time watching the ocean.” Schumann-­Heink may well have contemplated her peculiar personal and professional situation with regard to transatlantic politics as the tide went out. After Congress declared the United States’ entry into the war, on 6 April 1917, those concerns about performing German music proved well founded. German artists at the Met were fired because they were now enemy aliens (Gadski announced her retirement rather than be dismissed);31 Schumann-­Heink would not perform there again until the mid-­ 1920s. To avoid paying royalties to enemy countries, the music of living composers such as Engelbert Humperdinck and Richard Strauss was cut from programs. Even opera repertoire by dead composers, including the ever-­popular Wagner, was canceled.32 The problem, as the critic Krehbiel pointed out, was not the composer, but that the works were in the enemy’s vernacular. Thus, while instrumental music by Beethoven and Brahms continued to be performed (a brief hiatus had proved untenable), singers had either to choose politically acceptable repertoire—that is, music by the United States and its allies—or to start using translations, decisions with implications beyond wartime politics. In a speech made to the Republican Party Convention on 31 May 1916, Theodore Roosevelt spoke out against “hyphenated citizens”: “There can be no fifty-­fifty Americanism,” he exhorted, echoing President Woodrow Wilson’s 1915 State of the Union message but now with the added po-\n\nTrans atl an t ic A r r i va l s\n\n23\n\nlitical weight of war.33 Like many others, Schumann-­Heink reformulated her German-­American identity into something more patriotic. She announced that she would sever her relationship with Wolfsohn’s Musical Bureau, the longest-­established agency in New York City, who had paid her the princely sum of $500 for her first American concert tour back in 1892 (indeed, the founder, Henry Wolfsohn, claimed that his clients the heroic tenor Albert Niemann, Marcella Sembrich, and Schumann-­Heink had helped to popularize the song recital). Not only would that distance her from association with a German firm (although Wolfsohn, who had died in 1909, had moved to the United States as a child, and his firm was now run by an American, A. F. Adams), it meant that she could donate the proceeds from her concerts to charitable organizations such as the Red Cross and Jewish War Relief. Schumann-­Heink was far from the only artist to undertake such fund-­raising, and although performers in legitimate concerts and opera were exempted from the draft after 1 July 1918, artists were expected to contribute to the war effort in other ways (including a 10 percent tax implemented on concert tickets).34 Many adapted their concert programs to incorporate fund-­raising and appropriately rousing repertoire and speeches. For instance, Margaret Matzenauer, another contralto born in the Austro-­Hungarian empire, who had previously sung German and Italian repertoire at the Met, now programmed songs in English, French, Italian, Russian, and Norwegian, breaking off a Carnegie Hall recital for a “patriotic interruption” of “Dear Lord of Mine” and “The Star-­Spangled Banner” and a “stirring speech” by Mrs. Slade of the Women’s Committee. It was a presentational strategy shared by other singers of Germanic origin and, no less, by those representing the nations of the Triple Entente—France, Russia, and Britain—or who had been born in the United States. The New York Times noted that for the Matzenauer concert the hall was decorated with banners and posters for the national war savings campaign (war stamps were sold during the intermission): one read, “Joan of Arc saved France—Women of America, save your country.” Over the stage hung a battle picture inscribed “These boys are giving their lives will you lend your quarters?”35 Other singers with German backgrounds appeared at military bases, such as soprano Frieda Hempel, shown entertaining the troops in figure 1.1. But whereas Hempel wore a gown, as if giving a conventional concert, Schumann-­Heink entered more fully into the spirit of war. Many performers were photographed with soldiers or banners as backdrops, but the image of Schumann-­Heink at a Wall Street rally, draped in the American flag with her arms around two doughboys, encouraged\n\n24\n\nC h a pt er One\n\n1.1 Frieda Hempel singing to soldiers.

She attempted to distract attention from her Germanic identity by constantly emphasizing her understanding of military life—her autobiography begins, “I am a soldier’s daughter”—and she gained great fame and popularity for performing, as it seemed, tirelessly, for the troops, for “her boys.”36 Her repertoire consisted of American songs and spirituals, as well as Italian and French numbers. A description of the setting for one of her performances at Camp Dix, the army’s training and staging ground in New Jersey, is evocative: There were no lofty cathedral arches lost in misty shadows; no air heavy with long said, passionate prayers and burning incense. Only a vast, sandy plain, and a red sunset slowly fading into ghostly dusk. It meant war; it meant heroic, inescapable resolve: it meant bloody battlefields to come, and the bringing to many of an eternal dusk. [. . .] Against this setting Madame Schumann-­Heink sang with her soul in songs of home, of mother, and of cheer [. . .] it was the words of “mother” songs which sank the deepest. Many a boy, as he listened there, brushed away tears sneakingly with a grimy hand.37\n\nTrans atl an t ic A r r i va l s\n\n25\n\n1.2 Ernestine Schumann-­Heink at war rally. Music Division, The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations.\n\nSchumann-­Heink’s reputation as a mother was unrivaled: earlier in her career stories had circulated of her acting as a wet nurse, so full was she of milk from her seven children; in the 1930s she would host a radio show sponsored by a baby food company. Her image served to promote the maternal values considered vital to the war effort;38 her songs helped to universalize the conflict by reminding her audience that every soldier—­\n\n26\n\nC h a pt er One\n\neverywhere—was somebody’s son. But her appearances were also promoted as “her tribute of love, devotion and gratitude to the people of the United States, to whom she freely admits she owes everything she possesses”— a marked change of tune from statements made before the United States’ entry into the war, which revealed her sympathy for the German cause.39 Popular music and group singing were often used as means of fostering camaraderie during wartime,40 but classical repertoire played a slightly different role. As will be discussed at length in the next chapter, it is important to distinguish here between instrumental and texted music—the latter considered more politically suspect, because it could carry clearer messages from the enemy. It is also worth distinguishing between music experienced as a performer and that consumed more passively as a listener: there was safety in numbers, in all singing together, but attending to one voice alone meant that the listener risked falling prey to demagoguery. These different modes of performance and listening are evident in a report from an American singer who spent the First World War touring army hospitals and whom, in general, the wounded soldiers liked: “the sort of thing they can’t sing themselves. One young vaudeville singer, Gretchen Morris, was told by her soldier audience when she started ‘Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning,’ ‘we’ll show you how to sing that; sing us something else.’ So she did some concert ballads and they were delighted.”41 As was apparent in the popularity of Schumann-­Heink’s songs for her boys, there was a marked preference among the troops for nostalgic topics, such as songs about home, school, or nature: the Irish-­American tenor John McCormack—another hyphenated citizen who proved his newly minted American citizenship through endless wartime concertizing for the Red Cross— was said to endear himself to audiences through his “heart songs more than in his art songs.” He, like Schumann-­Heink, was adept at devising a multifaceted performing identity, forged through an assumed nationality, and by musical genre (at other points in his career McCormack would stress his Irishness, or—after the war—announce an intention to study German pronunciation). Such malleability raises questions about authenticity that would become heated through the interwar period, and which are latent in many discussions of vocal performance today. A further, colorful example of the potential slipperiness of a singer’s persona, which casts a slightly different light on political allegiances versus commercial gain, was the arrival in New York—apparently from Western Canada—of the Belgian baritone Louis Graveure in autumn 1915. His Aeolian Hall debut revealed a powerful and virile voice; the program\n\nTrans atl an t ic A r r i va l s\n\n1.3.1 Wilfrid Douthitt, English baritone. © Look and Learn / Rosenberg Collection.\n\n27\n\n1.3.2 Louis Graveure, between ca. 1915 and ca. 1920. George Grantham Bain Collection, Library of Congress.\n\nwas reported by the New York Times to have consisted of a group of Schubert lieder, some old English songs, three French numbers by Argentinian Herman Bemberg, and Alexander von Feilitz’s song cycle Eliland, “concluding, as is the custom of Belgian baritones, with a group of modern English ballads.” “His German diction was good, his French excellent, his English unimpeachable” the critic concluded somewhat ironically, as Graveure was widely recognized to be Wilfrid Douthitt, an Englishman who had appeared in musical comedy the previous season (figure 1.3.1).42 Graveure’s concert was a marked improvement on Douthitt’s one recital, the Times acknowledged; indeed, commentators implied that it was because of the resounding silence that had met his previous appearance that he had decided to adopt an alternative, foreign guise (further confirmation, some might say, of American preference for “exotic” musicians).43 Although Douthitt’s decision to redefine himself as Belgian might have suggested an affinity with plucky resistance to the Germans, another motivation might have been that he thereby avoided serving in the British Armed Forces; what’s more, claiming Belgian nationality in the United States prevented\n\n28\n\nC h apt er One\n\n1.3.3 Louis Graveure, German postcard from the 1930s, collection of Paul van Yperen.\n\nhis having to return home to fight.44 Tellingly, Graveure refused to confirm or deny rumors about his true identity, admitting that either way the publicity was too good to pass up, and he continued giving song recitals through the 1920s, to acclaim in both the United States and Germany (figure 1.3.2). He made many recordings for Columbia, taught singing, and wrote a performance treatise, Super-­Diction.45 But name and nationality were not the last migrations in Graveure’s career.46 In 1928 he shaved off his goatee and announced that he would no longer perform as a baritone but as a tenor;47 subsequently he decided to give up singing songs to concentrate on opera. In 1931 Graveure moved to Berlin, where he appeared regularly at the Deutsche Oper (as Faust, Rodolfo, Tonio, Don José, and Lohengrin). He also starred in four musical films made under the Nazi regime. Ich sehne mich nach dir (1934) was directed by a Party member, Johannes Riemann (who later made Ave Maria, starring Beniamino Gigli). It was about a sports teacher who finds fame as a singer but, probably inevitably, his marriage suffers. The title song was newly composed by Willy Engel-­Berger, as were most of the other numbers, but in one scene Graveure performed a lied: while his wife, played by Camilla Horn, smoked a cigarette on the balcony\n\nTrans atl an t ic A r r i va l s\n\n29\n\nwith another man, he sang Schubert’s “Ständchen” (“Leise flehen meine Lieder”). The camera pans around the audience in the marbled atrium, revealing the singer’s face only at the end. The rendition is slow and rubato-­ rich, a serenade more melancholic than seductive. Although the inclusion of Schubert confirms that lieder had a place in the cinema (there is more on appearances of “Ständchen” in films in chapter 2) as diegetic song, presented in concert it suggests that Schubert deserves to be taken more seriously than the other music in Ich sehne mich nach dir, even if the performer remains the same. In 1938 Graveure fled Germany—and Horn, with whom he had been in a relationship since they met on the set of Ein Walzer für Euch (1934, directed by Georg Zoch)—for unoccupied France. Accused by the Germans of espionage, he eventually made his way to England, returning to the United States with a new wife and child in 1947. He ended his career teaching singing in Hollywood. The many voices of Schumann-­Heink, McCormack, and Graveure— from vaudeville and musical comedy to concert singing, from opera to film—serve as a reminder of the flexibility with which performers approached high- and lowbrow registers during the interwar period. Money, inevitably, played an important part in determining what roles they chose to play: Schumann-­Heink returned to vaudeville after she lost most of her savings in 1929, and Graveure’s move to Germany was also said to have been prompted by the economic downturn. Before that happened, though, in the intervening years between the end of the war and the Depression, German vocal music had been reestablished in opera houses on concert programs. It was a slow process, entangled with what to some degree proved to be thwarted hopes for the future of anglophone repertoire.\n\nAn American in London (Roland Hayes) One of the first American classical singers to appear in London after the war was the tenor Roland Hayes. He and his accompanist, Lawrence Brown, arrived in 1920, intending—if all went well—to stay for a few years.48 He became one of the most successful recitalists in the city, regularly attracting large audiences in a variety of venues. Hayes had already gained some recognition in the States; he had toured with the a cappella group the Fisk Jubilee Singers and as a recitalist sold out Boston’s Symphony Hall in 1917. But his American career was limited by his race: even after his success in Boston Hayes could not find a manager, nor would all concert halls—­ particularly in the segregated South—book a black singer. Attitudes in\n\n30\n\nC h a pt er One\n\nLondon were somewhat different, and, while it could not be said that white audiences and reviewers were necessarily less prejudiced, the city’s mix of African Americans, Africans, and long-­established black British communities promised a fertile environment in which Hayes could explore his racial identity. In many ways the singer exemplified what the sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois, earlier in the century, had characterized as the “double consciousness” of the African American, torn into parts by issues such as awareness of his African heritage and the influence of his European upbringing and education.49 By moving to London he was able to confront both aspects: the city served as a staging point for the European continent and, potentially, for Africa.50 Discussions of Hayes’s African American identity intersected with questions about who had the right to sing certain repertoires, and how they should do so. His reception in England, it seems, was thus shaped by both his race and his eventual mastery of German song.51 Early in his career Hayes had decided to dedicate himself to standard European repertoire, and he was recognized as a particularly versatile performer: one critic described him as “downright Italianate in ‘Vesti la giubba’ and Irish as Paddy in ‘I hear you calling me.’ ” That versatility served him well when he tried to establish himself in London. Sampling what was happening, musically, in the week of Hayes’s 1920 debut illustrates the preoccupations of postwar concert life. Foreign instrumentalists were prominent, as was homegrown talent. There was a great deal of opera to be had, with the seasons of both Covent Garden and the Lyceum underway, as well as a glut of old and new English works presented by the Carl Rosa company, the Glastonbury Company at the Old Vic, and The Beggar’s Opera at the Lyric Theatre Hammersmith.52 There were seemingly few orchestral concerts— the Times lists only Frank Lafitte playing the Schumann and Rachmaninoff Piano Concertos with the Albert Hall orchestra, and a choral-­orchestral concert of Delius’s The Song of the High Hills, Holst’s Hymn of Jesus, and Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. Chamber music was fairly well represented, with recitals by the violinists Jascha Heifetz and Isolde Menges; the Flonzalay String Quartet playing Mozart, Smetana, and Loeffler; and piano recitals concentrating on Scriabin and on Norwegian and Czechoslovakian repertoire. Vocalists included the English tenors John Coates and Gervase Elwes (Coates singing French and English love songs at the Queen’s Hall, and Elwes contributing to a concert of music by Rebecca Clarke at the Aeolian Hall); the English soprano Dorothy Silk mixing Schütz, Bach, and modern works (Wigmore Hall); and the returning American Reinhold Werrenrath, who sang music by living English, French, and American composers\n\nTrans atl an t ic A r r i va l s\n\n31\n\n(Queen’s Hall).53 More information about singers’ programming strategies are provided in the second and third chapters. Here it is worth noting that most vocal recitals—like Hayes’s—took place in the mid-­afternoon (the exceptions here were the better-­known Coates and Clarke), which limited the available audience to the leisured classes. All the same, Hayes’s London debut at 3:15 P.M. at the Aeolian Hall, on 31 May 1920, was said to be well attended by his compatriots. There were few reviews of that first concert. The Daily Mail judged Hayes to “be more suited by the less sophisticated music” of his program, but noted that his diction in English and French was good, and that he had “natural vocal gifts and temperament,” predicting that he would be able to command that holy grail of song, the mezza voce or half voice.54 (The rise of this type of singing in vocal recitals would become particularly significant for lieder, because it encouraged the view that this was a quiet art, meant for intimate performance in small halls or, indeed, for listening to at home on headphones.) Gradually, his reputation grew, and there was less equivocation: in April 1921 the Times declared Hayes exceptional, a first-­class musician, with an impeccable sense of rhythm and excellent taste (despite allowing himself one “final high note for the groundlings”). Moreover, he had personality, said to be evident in his renditions of the songs from his own country, spirituals. It is here that the Times review invokes some significant tropes for the interpretation of vocal recitals: that the best renditions are when the performers are completely absorbed in their material, and that that absorption is connected with their singing repertoire with which they have a strong personal connection.“He meant them,” wrote the reviewer, “whereas some other people who undertake them sing them because they are ‘quaint.’ That practice ruins the song and stamps the singer; whoever cannot get inside a song makes it a sham and the singing a pose.” Brown’s devised accompaniments were apt—“the simple treated simply”— and at the end of the recital “a curious thing happened. Nobody moved or took his eyes off the platform. They had had reality before them, and it had gone.”55 Arguably, the quality of a singer’s voice is always a prime concern of critics, and their background was often an important factor in assessing their performances, be it through discussions of their diction or their renditions of repertoire in their mother tongue. It will come as little surprise, then, that the vocabulary used to describe Hayes’s voice frequently reflected his race. Many British reviews emphasized the singer’s “natural” gifts. Ezra Pound, writing for the New Age, explained: “I can at the moment think\n\n32\n\nC h apt er One\n\nof no singer who employs so many different qualities of voice, from operatic delivery to a singing which is almost speech [. . .] Hayes’s great advantage over the remaining ‘white hopes’ is in his splendid grip on the rhythm-­sweep.” He conceded, however, that Hayes’s rendition of Hebridean songs was “given with vigour but not quite assimilated.”56 By 1924 Richard Capell felt able to explain that the secret to Hayes’s art was that it was never forced.57 Americans tended to be more explicit: for example, Musical America reported that critics “found his voice big in power, beautiful in quality, saturated with the racial color belonging alone to the Negro voice.” 58 Hayes came to agree that “even the voice I was born with was colored” but also pointed out that when he started listening closely to white singers, “to my amazement I discovered that their voices were as white their skin.”59 He decided to exploit his “unique” tone more explicitly and, while he continued to perform European classics, embarked on a project to reclaim African American spirituals (or “Aframerican spirituals,” as he came to call them) from their association with the comic antics of minstrels that would become increasingly politicized through his career.60 Spirituals enjoyed great popularity in London during the 1920s; they were performed by singers both black and white, visiting and local.61 Their inclusion on regular concert programs signaled a desire for this repertoire to be taken seriously—to stand shoulder to shoulder with the songs of other nations, rather than being presented as something of a novelty act.62 Hayes encouraged a distinction to be made between spirituals and the other music associated with African Americans, jazz. Ahead of his debut, the “Negro Caruso,” as the Daily Express characterized him, expounded: “My people are a race of singers. Every thought and sentiment finds expression in song. I want to convince the white man that we have a contribution to give to the world of music beyond that of jazz bands and banjos on the beach.”63 Hayes, perhaps remarkably, later found sympathizers among the British right-­wing press: in 1926 Charles B. Cochran wrote in the Daily Mail that the American Negro should not be blamed for jazz, which in fact was “an international product,” influenced by those who, for Cochran, were the greater threat: Jews. The spiritual, as sung by Hayes, Robeson, and the songwriting duo Layton and Johnstone, however, had been shown to be “an artistic achievement of great expressiveness, poignancy, humor, and profound religious sentiment.”64 Not that all reviewers were comfortable with the transplantation of such repertoire to the concert hall. Hayes’s performance of spirituals in the Savoy Chapel Royal was decreed—again by the Daily Mail—to have\n\nTrans atl an t ic A r r i va l s\n\n33\n\nbeen the strangest service the four-­hundred-­year-­old church had ever witnessed. It is unclear from the report whether the strangeness stemmed from the repertoire, the musicians’ race, or simply the presentation of a voice-­ and-­piano recital in a chapel overshadowed by a hotel, but for the Mail “nothing could have been further from the conventional Anglican music of a Lent service.”65 The presentation of spirituals in church and in concert halls bolstered claims for the status of a genre some still characterized, disparagingly, as slave music. Importantly, it was not necessarily white audiences who thought in those terms: members of the African American middle classes during the 1920s, as author Zora Neale Hurston observed, preferred to distance themselves from spirituals, considering them a form of retrogressive “niggerism.”66 Only after Hayes was accepted by white audiences, according to Hurston, were they willing to change their mind, leading to Hayes’s concerts’ being recognized as “tremendous propaganda” for racial equality by bringing together white and black audiences.67 Importantly, Hayes’s ability to sing everything well, from Italian opera to Nigerian folk songs, not only was significant racially, but also served to highlight the inadequacies of London’s own: his versatility was recognized by the Daily Telegraph as being “beyond the scope of our own singers,” suggesting, among other things, a frustration with available recital repertoire that would cause a change from wartime practices.68 Hayes became one of the most popular recitalists at the Wigmore Hall in the early 1920s; the financial records document that his audiences grew with each season.69 One major step forward in terms of his British reception was recognized in the press as being a successful visit to Buckingham Palace on 23 April 1921.70 By 1923 he had attained a remarkably high profile for any singer in London: for example, he was said to be the “chief attraction” at a concert arranged by Lady Leconfield and Countess Hochberg for St. George’s Home for Friendless Girls (a charitable institution founded in 1836 to assist poor and destitute girls of good character by finding them situations).71 The well-­attended event took place at 25 Park Lane, the vast and extravagantly decorated London town house of Sir Philip Sassoon, a scion of the Rothschild family and a prominent British politician, art collector, and host. The event’s patrons included royalty—Princesses Helena and Mary—and aristocrats with political connections, such as the Dowager Duchess of Abercorn, the Marchioness of Salisbury, and the Countess of Shaftesbury (all married to conservative Members of Parliament, and all of whom served as ladies-­in-­waiting at Court). Some had belonged to the so-­called Marlborough House set, which had gathered around the Prince\n\n34\n\nC h apt er One\n\nof Wales at his residence on Pall Mall at the end of the nineteenth century. While often characterized as louche and extravagant by the standards of the day, the Marlborough set invested heavily in cultural life and philanthropy, as evidenced by their continued involvement in concerts such as this. Their patronage was a crucial means of support for artists trying to make their name on the London concert scene and could even extend across the Atlantic (other members of the Marlborough set, such as the Lister-­Kayes and Naticia Consuelo, will reappear as participants in New York’s Bagby Musical Mornings).72 What is particularly interesting is that, as Hayes’s audiences expanded— or, one might say, became more elevated—so did his repertoire. Specifically, he began to include more highbrow, and even some German, music.73 West Africa had reported of a concert that took place on 24 September 1921: The programme [at the Wigmore Hall], on the whole, was more worthy of Mr Hayes than some of his former ones. Although his renditions of Afro-­American folksongs are artistic to a degree, it is in composers like Schubert, Handel, Scarlatti etc., that he shows the power of his voice and his perfect training. What can be more delightful than to hear Handel’s “Where’er you walk’ ” or Schubert’s “Du bist die Ruh’,” that gem amongst this great composer’s songs, as Mr Hayes sings them?74\n\nThe remarkable aspect of Hayes’s program here was less his race or training than that this was the first Schubert he had sung in London. That he now braved “ ‘Du bist die Ruh’ ” suggests, as well as his growing professional surety, that postwar attitudes toward German repertoire were gradually changing. As outlined in further detail in chapter 2, just as in New York, there had been resistance to hearing lieder in London during and for some years after the war; when the songs were reintroduced, they were usually sung in English rather than the original language. The transition to singing lieder in German, whatever one’s nationality, occurred slightly later in the 1920s. It was partly brought about by the lifting of immigration restrictions so that German singers could return to British and American stages. Such eminent interpreters as the mezzo-­soprano Elena Gerhardt and the composer-­conductor Richard Strauss (discussed in the next section) took up their careers more or less where they had left them before the war, reengaging with their previous audience and introducing a younger generation to lieder repertoire in German.75 As touched\n\nTrans atl an t ic A r r i va l s\n\n35\n\non already in regard to the reception of Schumann-­Heink and Hayes, as a German-­American and an African American respectively, a singer’s race or ethnicity was often taken into account when evaluating whether his or her take on a particular musical repertoire might be considered authentic. A similar essentialism transferred to the interpretation of lieder as works, in that it was argued that to fully appreciate the poems and their musical setting, one must pre­sent the songs in their original language. Before the war young American and British musicians had studied in Europe, and they began to do so again, despite efforts to encourage them to study closer to home (interestingly, language tuition at institutions such as New York’s Juilliard School increased dramatically through the 1920s). Several singers made a point of their linguistic abilities as a means to prove their intellect and cosmopolitanism.76 Such qualities encouraged the view of lieder as a highbrow genre, to be appreciated by the cultural elite. It was in part because of this association that figures such as Hayes and John McCormack became keen to sing lieder; their fame for singing spirituals and Irish ballads meant that they were not always taken seriously by certain critics and audiences, but including a group of Schubert or Wolf could prove their musical mastery across genres and brows.77 The classical vocal recital, in other words, became a performative nexus for identifying as belonging to a certain race or nation while simultaneously demonstrating one’s command over a number of different languages and styles.78 Such displays of cultural internationalism also opened up new markets for singers such as McCormack and Hayes in central Europe. Having studied with George Henschel and Amanda Ira Alridge in London, Hayes traveled to Vienna in 1923 to work with the Polish-­Austrian tenor and renowned teacher Theodor Lierhammer.79 His concert debut in the city was greeted with expressions of surprise that an African American could show such mastery over Schubert. The Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung stated: “Do not imagine that it is sufficient to be white to become an artist. Try first to sing as well as this black man did.”80 Yet the announcement the following year that Hayes would perform in Berlin (as McCormack had just done, to some acclaim) provoked an outcry in the city’s press and complaints to the American ambassador.81 Time magazine reported that Berliners were against “the ‘impertinence’ of permitting a Negro to be heard on the concert stage, against the lèst majesté [sic] of offering musically scrupulous Berlin the tunes of the Georgia cotton-­pickers.”82 Hayes was greeted at the Beethovensaal with boos and hisses. He recalled:\n\n36\n\nC h a pt er One\n\nI found myself standing in a flood of light; in front of me, a black-­out audience sat unquietly. From the rear there rolled out a great volley of hisses, which seemed to fill the hall entirely. I was terribly apprehensive, but I took my place in the curve of the piano, closed my eyes, lifted my head into singing position, and stood still as a statue. I waited moment after moment, perhaps for five or ten minutes altogether, listening to the ebb and flow of antagonistic sound. [. . .] When the silence came, as it absolutely did at length, the hall was more still than any I had ever sung in. It was so quiet that the hush began to hurt. I conveyed my readiness to my accompanist with the slightest movement of my lips, without turning my head or my body, and began to sing Schubert’s “Du bist die ruh’,” which otherwise would have occurred later in the program. The entry to that song is almost as silent as silence itself. The German text, stealing out of my mouth in sustained pianissimo, seemed to win my hostile audience over.83\n\nAccording to Hayes’s daughter, “the greatest sign of approval at that time was the pounding of walking sticks, which all the gentlemen carried, on the floor. So halfway through the song, the pounding of the sticks started. There was so much noise, that by the time he reached the last note, it couldn’t even be heard, because the audience was up on their feet already. And after that, he quietly continued with the rest of the program.”84 Critics subsequently were generous in their praise: according to the right-­ leaning national newspaper Deutsche Tageszeitung, Hayes showed his dedication to Schubert and Brahms by singing in the German language, while the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung declared him to be “a real artist, not just a singer but a musician.”85 Siegmund Piesling, writing for the Berliner Börsen-­Zeitung, again compared Hayes favorably to his white competitors: “A Moor, who sings Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, and Hugo Wolf in German without much of an accent, is worth listening to if he can feel the spirit of the German lied. And Hayes gets it. How he sings Schumann’s ‘Ich hab’ im Traum geweinet’! A black man! A couple of white singers could learn a lesson from him.”86 Kira Thurman points out that when he returned to Vienna, Hayes was described as “a black [Franz] Steiner,” suggesting that the singer was evaluated as a native German despite being foreign.87 Hayes’s mastery over musical expression and technique, as well as over the German language, was reported back by critics to London and New York.88 It was a significant message that elided racial and sonic identities: if an African American singer could undertake what Kathrin Sieg\n\nTrans atl an t ic A r r i va l s\n\n37\n\ncalls “ethnic drag” to the extent of being judged convincingly German in his performance of lieder, so too could—and should—white anglophone musicians.89 The transatlantic circuit for musicians was expanding, and it never went in just one direction.\n\nGermans in New York (Elisabeth Schumann and Richard Strauss) On his return to New York City in October 1921, after an absence of almost twenty years, Richard Strauss was greeted as a celebrity. “Twenty reporters and photographers rushed towards us like wild animals,” exclaimed Elisabeth Schumann in her diary; “we were even filmed—that sort of thing doesn’t happen every day.” A police cavalcade escorted the musicians from the Hotel St. Regis to a reception at City Hall, prior to a concert at Carnegie Hall that, according to Schumann, was “like a victor’s triumph.” Strauss was one of the first prominent European composers to return to the United States after the war. He did so primarily for financial reasons: he had been unable to claim copyright fees during the hostilities.90 His visit also marked a turning point in the fortunes of German music and musicians in New York. By 1921 German opera, sung in the original language, had just been reinstated at the Metropolitan.91 German songs, however, were only beginning to reappear on concert programs. In this New York trailed behind London; however, German musicians had not yet returned in person to British stages.92 Part of the pomp surrounding Strauss’s arrival, therefore, was to help prove New York’s international status as a cultural hub.93 Strauss’s presence had further significance in that, despite still being alive, his lieder were grouped among the “classics,” with Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, and Wolf: he was the embodiment of the great German tradition. His visit was thus taken as an opportunity for elite German musicians to publicly reassert themselves in the city. Crowds and photographers lined the streets of Manhattan to watch the arrival of Strauss at City Hall. The dozen or so municipal taxis following the composer’s car contained representatives of the main classical-­music institutions—orchestras, opera houses, and conservatories—all of whom had Central European connections. They included the conductors Artur Bodansky, Walter Damrosch, Leopold Stokowski (whose Philadelphia Orchestra Strauss used throughout his tour), and Josef Stránský (despite Strauss’s disparaging remarks about his replacing Mahler at the New York Philharmonic); Beethoven Association bigwigs, the pianist Harold Bauer and the composer Rubin Gold-\n\n38\n\nC h apt er One\n\nmark (nephew of Viennese composer Karl Goldmark); the violinist Franz Kneisel, the singer Herbert Witherspoon, and the composers Leo Ornstein and Hugo Riesenfeld. The Polish soprano Claire Dux, about to embark on a career in Chicago, and the German pianist Elly Ney also attended. Mayor John F. Hylan was lauded by the Bavarian-­born City Chamberlain Philip Berolzheimer (himself a notable supporter of music in the city) as a patron of the arts and for promoting free concerts for the poor. Goldmark introduced Strauss, the “greatest living composer,” to what had, since his last visit in 1904, become “one of the great musical centers of the world.” In response, Strauss—speaking in German, with a translator to hand— thanked his hosts for their “new and generous welcome to German music” and expressed hope for true peace, which would “bring together the United States of America and my fatherland in closer and closer friendship and labor for that culture which is the property of all peoples.”94 The notion that culture belonged to all peoples was in keeping with the internationalist rhetoric of the postwar period. Strauss was no doubt also anxious to smooth over a minor scandal that had erupted before his arrival, caused by an interview with the Nation, in which he was reported to have said that “culture will always come from Europe,” and that “Europe does not need America— only her dollars.”95 The composer was quick to fight back, claiming that his comments had been “maliciously garbled” and that the interviewer was an amateur who did not speak German.96 He subsequently remarked positively on the influence of jazz and the potential for the United States to develop her own culture, along similar lines to his speech at City Hall. Strauss’s position as “greatest living composer” was, however, contentious.97 The vocal recitals he gave on tour included some Schubert but were predominantly of his own lieder. Few were convinced that he now had much to offer creatively, and even his new songs—several of which would be sung on the 1921 tour—were received with only muted respect. Richard Aldrich reported that there was only “a very moderately sized audience” at the Town Hall and that Strauss was an “indifferent” accompanist, in both manner and quality. Schumann apparently sang with “intelligent phrasing and an excellent German enunciation; and presumably interprets Dr. Strauss’s songs as Dr. Strauss wishes them sung,” but Aldrich said he had heard them sung “with more spirit, more variety of expression, and deeper reach into their emotional significance.”98 A report of Strauss’s appearances in London, on the heels of his American tour, suggested that even the composer’s biographer, Ernest Newman, seemed bored by hearing works that were over thirty years old.99\n\nTrans atl an t ic A r r i va l s\n\n39\n\nThe composer’s New York concerts, however, attracted an audience that had not been seen since before the war. According to the New York Tribune critic Henry Krehbiel, those at his first Carnegie Hall concert were “seemingly wholly German,” with few familiar faces from the regular symphony orchestra series.100 A similar sense that Strauss attracted a predominantly German audience can be gathered from Schumann’s diary; in Baltimore she received comments such as “Yes, that is how we sing in Germany!” while she was surprised by the warmth with which they were greeted in Boston, supposed to have been the most “anti-­German” town.101 By this stage, opined the Boston Daily Globe, Strauss’s nationality “is comparatively unimportant [. . .] German citizens who perform in our concert halls should be judged on the musical value of their work, and by that alone.”102 Strauss’s eminence did not prevent several halls on the tour being barely full (there were many empty seats in Brooklyn, and a concert in Duluth was canceled because of poor sales) and there were negative reviews, some reflecting the persistent anti-­German sentiment of newspapers such as the New York Times. Strauss’s reputation was confirmed by his social engagements during the 1921 tour, which were undeniably Germanic. He and his entourage were entertained in style by wealthy New Yorkers typically of German Jewish descent. At the Hudson estate of the lawyer Samuel Untermyer, they met the banker and art collector Henry Goldman; he and his wife were friends of the mezzo-­soprano Elena Gerhardt. They attended the premiere of Erich Wolfgang Korngold’s Die tote Stadt at the Metropolitan with the opera house’s manager, Otto H. Kahn, and lunched with the financier and philanthropist Sir Edgar Speyer and his wife, Lady Leonora. On the surface it might seem as if the financial and charitable networks that had supported the arts were just as they were before the war, but note that Henry Goldman had resigned from his family’s firm, Goldman Sachs, because of its support for the Allies, and that Sir Edgar’s naturalization as a British citizen had been revoked in response to accusations that he had traded with the enemy. They may still have been gatekeepers of certain kinds of culture, but were also somewhat tarnished remnants of the Gilded Age. The musicians appreciated being wined and dined (Strauss devised a new nickname for Schumann: Elobsterbeth) but, as usual, their status was kept in check. Schumann occasionally resented being asked to sing at social gatherings—after an evening at the Speyers with Mrs. Untermyer and the Bodanskys, she noted in her diary, “I did not sing—I don’t see why I always should. These people sit on their pots of money and never hand out fees or\n\n40\n\nC h a pt er One\n\npresents.”103 Despite her complaints, and halls not being sold out, the tour was financially lucrative. Strauss was reported to have made $50,000— a magnificent sum in German marks, the New York Times pointed out, and an even more magnificent sum in Austrian kroner (Strauss was then director of the Vienna State Opera).104 He had also collected $500 to support musicians from Central Europe still suffering the effects of the war. The more helpful action, critics claimed, would be for Strauss to promote American culture. Apparently Europeans still considered the United States “ ‘the land of the dollar,’ peopled by crass materialists, ignorant of the finer things of art and without sympathy for the aspirations and achievements of artists.”105 Strauss’s willingness to work with American artists, such as the tenor George Meader, was taken to signal his high regard for the quality of music making in New York (although, of course, Meader was German trained).
