        "text": "So one of the things that’s been sucking away at my time for blog-writing these last couple months is that I’ve been organizing and programming a benefit concert. While hunting for pieces related to the concert themes, it occurred to me to share some of the Google-fu that I use for finding music. I’m sure these tips are old hat to some of you tech-savvy singers, but others might find them useful.\n\nSo, one of my objectives was to find vocal solo or small ensemble pieces from the opera, art song, musical theater, or popular genres on the theme of “gold” or “golden”, since the concert benefits an organization celebrating its golden anniversary season. I did this by using keyword searches on the following websites:\n\nThe Lied, Art Song, and Choral Texts Archive – for art song and other musical poem/text settings\n\nAria Database (aria-database.com) – for aria texts\n\nOpera Guide / Opernführer and OperaGlass (opera.stanford.edu) – for opera libretti, to get ideas for duets/trios/ensembles\n\nAllMusicals.com – lyrics from musicals\n\nChoral Public Domain Library (CPDL) – texts of choral works in the public domain\n\nSpotify – all genres including popular\n\niTunes – search my own music collection or the iTunes store for ideas\n\nSeveral of these sites contain texts in various translations, so I made sure to search for translated versions of my keywords, too. E.g., in addition to searching for “gold” I would also search for terms “oro”, “d’or”, etc. (It had to be “d’or” for French since “or” would yield too many search results in English texts!) Translating the search terms is less necessary for some of the sites, like The Lied, Art Song, and Choral Texts Archive and Aria Database because they have English translations of many texts, so my keyword search for “gold” will still yield songs in other languages. Other sites like Opernführer might only have the libretto in the original language or in German, for example, so translating the search keywords is a definite help there.\n\nAs for search engines – some of the sites above have a very good site search feature, e.g. The Lied, Art Song, and Choral Texts Archive and AllMusicals.com, so you can just go directly to their website and enter the keywords into the search form there. But sometimes a website doesn’t have a site search feature (e.g. OperaGlass), the site search feature is too specialized for a general text search (Aria Database), or the site search does not return results of sufficient quantity or quality. In this case, you can do a Google search with the following syntax in order to narrow your search results to a particular site – just include “site:” followed by the domain name of the website to search, with no space in-between:\n\ngold site:opera.stanford.edu\n\nOnce I found song texts that fit my programming theme, I was able to track down scores for songs through online sheet music sellers, IMSLP, CPDL, or by using WorldCat to find scores in libraries local to me.\n\n8/26/13 UPDATE 1: Fellow techie singer Katia H. has created a search tool that searches all of the websites mentioned above, in one fell swoop! It’s over at classicalsongsearch.com – check it out!\n\n8/26/13 UPDATE 2: Glendower Jones contributed this very useful info in the comments for this post:\n\nThis is great advice. Many folks may not know of the many massive reference books on vocal repertoire that were written by Sergius Kagen, Noni Espina, Michael Pilkington, Judith Carman, Graham Johnson, Shirley Emmons and Carol Kimball. A very useful reference is Pazdirek, the BBC Song Catalogue and Classical Vocal Music in Print and of course Groves and MGG. I don’t know, but possibly some of these books may now be on Google books.\n\nThese are some of the major references but still only a drop in the bucket. Pazdirek, Universal-Handbuch der Musikliteratur was produced in Vienna from 1904-1910 and contained the compilation of practically every music publisher active at the time. This was reprinted in 1967 in the Netherlands and is now free online. Few musicians know of this amazing work. http://archive.org/details/universalhandboo01pazd\n\nAlso, in a Facebook comment, Nicholas Perna adds:\n\nAs a shameless plug, I can also recommend readers search for Britten’s entire output using The Comprehensive Britten Song Database! www.brittensongdatabase.com\n\nRelated Posts:\n\nClassicalSongSearch.com: A search engine for vocal repertoire\n\nWorking with music texts, Part 1: Find the text online, then sync it to the cloud!\n\nWorking with music texts, Part 2: Translate the text\n\nIPA dictionaries on the web\n\nRussian Art Song website & free download: “A Guide to Russian Diction”\n\nItalianMadrigal.com: The Italian Madrigal Resource Center – Scores, texts, translations, and more\n\nItalian resources for stage pronunciation, common word endings, & dictionary apps [via @DictionPolice]\n\nApp Review: Collins Italian/English dictionary for iOS [via Ellen Rissinger/@DictionPolice]\n\nDigital dictionaries for translating archaic words and spellings\n\nLast Thursday I had the pleasure of meeting for coffee with Dan Molkentin, co-founder and co-artistic director of SingersBabel, the subscription-based website with lyric diction resources. He happened to be in town for the Music Library Association conference, so we took the opportunity to get together and talk shop. I knew at once that he was a kindred spirit when our conversation ranged from web technology stacks, media workflows, and website project management, to textual discrepancies in different composers’ setting of the same poems, Italianate vs. German Latin, and whether we should be rolling or vanishing our final R’s in German.\n\nOne piece of SingersBabel news that Dan shared was that they will be introducing Russian resources to the website in coming weeks. The resources will include multimedia guides for learning the basic sounds of the language, as well as guides for specific texts and repertoire. Speaking of repertoire, Dan tells me that the repertoire guides on the site will focus on choral works and oratorio, with a bit of art song to boot. (Although I REALLLLY hope – pretty please – that they’ll consider bringing some opera people on board to produce diction resources for the operatic repertoire and Italian. There’s an untapped market there, and even if they just did the arias from those ubiquitous Larsen anthologies, I bet they’d get business from a bunch of vocal performance majors and the like.)\n\nWe also talked about the recent SingersBabel website testing program, which I participated in. One thing that I discovered in the course of testing is that the website has many more resources than I thought; it’s just that they’re hard to find (and the SingersBabel team is working to rectify that). A sampling of notable resources:\n\nAudio comparison of vowel and consonant sounds in different languages (subscription required) – with special attention given to vowels that are transcribed with the same IPA symbol but have slightly different shadings in the various languages\n\nSingersBabel YouTube channel – song texts, IPA introduction, and more\n\nDan’s YouTube channel – including his 35-minute Introduction to Lyric German Diction video\n\nAnd I really like this video on how to prepare a song text and really break down the text and diction components:\n\nDan shared some other online music resources with me as well. One of them, Peachnote, is something I’ve been meaning to check out for a while. From what I’ve gathered, Peachnote is a provider of a number of interesting music technologies, but one that particularly attracted Dan’s interest was Peachnote’s platform for collaborative online multimedia annotation of music scores. In plain English, that means that you can use Peachnote’s score viewer to annotate the score with your own text, audio, or video notes and also view annotations that others have added. Here’s a screen capture of Peachnote’s score viewer with annotations:\n\nPeachnote also makes it possible to embed the score viewer in your own website, and in fact the viewer is already in use over at IMSLP with a number of scores. For example, you can go to the IMSLP page for Le nozze di Figaro, navigate to the full score for the overture, and click the “View” button:\n\nThe Peachnote viewer then displays the score, which someone has annotated with a YouTube video recording of a performance of the overture:\n\nDan also tipped me off to the Sparks and Wiry Cries blog and e-zine about art song. (I can’t believe I’ve never stumbled upon this.) From their masthead: “Our mission is to provide a virtual home for the art song community: performers, students, scholars and fans. We endeavor to provoke thoughtful discussion about the extraordinary art of song.” One of their contributors is Emily Ezust, creator and maintainer of The Lied, Art Song, and Choral Texts Archive, and they have a number of other notable contributors as well.\n\nLastly, Dan mentioned Medici TV, a French website which offers free live broadcasting of concerts, operas, and ballets along with video on demand from their catalog of concerts and classical music documentaries.\n\nThank you, Dan, for our engaging and enlightening conversation, and best of luck with the SingersBabel venture!\n\nRelated Posts:\n\nPodcast: The Diction Police\n\nDiction, music history, and tech for choral conductors on SlideShare [via Philip Copeland]\n\nMore posts tagged “diction”\n\nMore posts tagged “IPA”\n\nMore posts tagged “art song”\n\nNow that my music performance commitments for the holidays and the fall are behind me, I’m coming up for air and for a report on how things went from a technology perspective. (This is part 2 of a two-part post. Read part 1 here.)\n\n3. Messiah duet + choral gig + more\n\nMy duet partner and my pianist colleague and I rehearsed and performed some duets for fall and winter shows, namely, the Barcarolle from Les contes d’Hoffmann and also “He shall feed his flock” from Handel’s Messiah. IMSLP was definitely my friend when it came to downloading sheet music for those pieces. During our rehearsals, I mused on how I might like to get a more compact portable music stand for my iPad. I like the combination of the CrisKenna Xclip2 mount and Mic Stand Concertino plus gooseneck extension, recommended by flutist Sharyn Byer when she was profiled on Going Digital for Musicians:\n\nHere’s another photo from that blog post that shows a dramatic difference between the space taken up by Sharyn’s music stand, versus her colleague’s more traditional stand. To be fair, though, her colleague probably gets to view more pages of music at a time, and perhaps in a larger size, too!\n\nTheGigEasy mic stand mount for iPad also looks good for my purposes, and a new, thinner, lighter version will be released in January 2013. The iKlip mic stand mount is worth a look too. Honestly, my current portable setup of a wire stand plus my iPad case with its securing strap is not bad, but I wouldn’t mind something with a sturdier build and slimmer profile. I’d feel less worried about knocking it over.\n\nI also had a Messiah chorus gig this past Christmas. Unlike my regular choir, I was the only tablet-wielding singer there. The soprano seated beside me showed a great deal of interest in my iPad sheet music. She was considering a Kindle purchase and was wondering about using it for sheet music. Of course I directed her to this blog so she can check out a few different options 🙂 About the Kindle specifically, I am leery of it for sheet music at this time. A friend once showed me a music score on his Kindle DX e-reader. I liked the screen size and resolution, but we found the page loading and page turns to be slower than on my iPad, and I also thought the music was difficult to see on the non-backlit display. Perhaps the newer Kindle models perform better, though – I haven’t tried them so I don’t know.\n\nEarlier I had asked the conductor for the Messiah performance whether it was ok for me to use my iPad for the music. Fortunately, she was cool with it (not all conductors are, so it’s not a bad idea to ask first). I used my black silicone iPad skin as the “black folder” for holding the music during the performance (same as I do with my regular choir) and no one voiced any concerns. But it did get me to thinking about having an iPad case that looks more like a traditional black choral folder for those times when a music director insists on it, or if I’m doing one of those Victorian period-costume caroling gigs where it would look anachronistic and silly to be obviously holding an iPad. And I’m tired of waiting for MUSICFOLDER.com to design such a case. Blog reader Loren F. recommends the DODOcase for this purpose, and blog reader Dick H. gave some tips on modding the DODOcase for use as a choral folder. However, the price of the DODOcase is a bit steep for me, so I’m probably going to roll my own and make an iPad choral folder out of an inexpensive folio case as a do-it-yourself project – stay tuned for details.\n\nBy the way, in the course of doing this Messiah chorus gig, I was informed that you can download PDFs of the choral movements from the Schirmer edition of the Messiah vocal score at this site (although I haven’t verified that all the page numbers, etc. match up with my printed Schirmer score, so caveat downloader). Schirmer is not the most scholarly edition of Messiah ever, but an awful lot of typical local Messiah performances use it, so it can be handy to have. (The Schirmer score on my iPad is one that I scanned previously from the printed score that I own.)\n\n4. Preparing for the St. Matthew Passion\n\nMy choir is performing Bach’s St. Matthew Passion this coming spring. I bought a score and had the spine sliced off and then our de facto e-music librarian, Steve, scanned it into a nice slim 7MB PDF file for use with forScore. I ordered a CD of one of the recordings that the conductor recommended (I couldn’t find it as a download or in streaming format) and I also procured a different recording on iTunes. I found some excellent free diction/IPA resources for the St. Matthew Passion online that will be a useful learning aid. I also want to check out SingersBabel to see what diction resources they have for this work. I just got a Belkin YourType Folio + Keyboard for my iPad (more on that later) and I think that its Bluetooth keyboard will come in handy for typing the translation into my score. The Great Books Tutorial website has the text and translation of the St. Matthew Passion in PDF format, laid out nicely for either printing or viewing on a tablet. There are also some interesting background pieces and listening guides online: Bach 101: St. Matthew Passion from the Bach Choir of Bethlehem’s website, an introduction and annotated text/translation from Minnesota Public Radio, and A Visitor’s Guide to the St. Matthew Passion by NPR.\n\nThis is part 2 of the Tech tools for working with music texts series.\n\nStep 2: Translate the text\n\nMy next step is to translate the text I’m singing. I like to do a word-for-word translation and write it into my score. If I’m short on time, or if I have difficulty translating the text myself, I’ll look for a translation from one of these sources. Some of them have literal translations, some have poetic translations, and some have both. I generally double-check the translations I find online, as they occasionally contain mistakes.\n\nIf I’m doing the translation myself, these are the main tech tools and references I use:\n\nWordReference is my workhorse dictionary for French and Italian and they have many other languages as well as verb conjugations. They have a website as well as a free iPhone app and Android app (which I use on my Android phone, and like). No iPad-specific app, but the regular website works fine on an iPad. The smartphone apps require an internet connection.\n\nI like BEOLINGUS for German (although I use WordReference for German as well). BEOLINGUS has many useful search options as well as sound clips of word pronunciations by native speakers. I also find it easier to stumble across idiomatic usages in BEOLINGUS. In addition to the regular website, there is a mobile-friendly website as well as free third-party Android apps that use BEOLINGUS as the translation engine (Quickdic Offline Dictionary and Emilio’s Dictionary, both of which work offline).\n\nLatin is a tough one for me – I don’t know enough of how the language works to get very far doing my own word-for-word translation from reference materials. I usually go to CPDL and hope that it’s a commonly-set text that I can look up. Otherwise if it’s some oddball text and I have to attempt the translation myself, I’ll try these dictionaries: University of Notre Dame’s Latin Dictionary and Grammar Aid, William Whitaker’s Words (mobile-friendly-ish version here), or the Latin dictionary from the Perseus Digital Library at Tufts University.\n\nGoogle Translate is a catch-all tool; copy and paste your text and watch Google do its magic. Results are decent-to-good but occasionally wacky. Mouse over the translated phrases to see alternate translations. There is an Android app and and iPhone/iPad app.\n\nNico Castel libretti books – the footnotes are great for untangling idiomatic or archaic usages, cultural/historic references, and similar translation challenges.\n\nIf I end up heading to the library and hitting the stacks, these lists of printed references are helpful: Translations & Song Texts, Finding Translations and Phonetic Readings of Vocal Music Texts, Finding Translations of Vocal Music\n\nIf I got really stuck on a translation problem, another option would be to post the translation work I have done so far on a forum like ChoralNet, the New Forum for Classical Singers, or a language-learning forum and ask the community for help.\n\nAs I work, I like to type my translation into the Evernote or Dropbox document I created earlier that contains the original text. Once my translation is done, I can write it into my score on my iPad with the forScore app’s annotation feature. I can either use the “Draw” option and write it in freehand with my stylus (zooming in if there’s limited space to write in) or the “Type” option and type it in, adding extra spaces between words so that my word-for-word translation lines up properly with each word of the original text. I may also write in a paraphrase or poetic translation, in a different color than the literal translation just so my eye can distinguish. If there’s some pesky, godawful singing translation already printed in the score, I can erase it first using forScore’s “Whiteout Pen” option.\n\nIt’s during these kinds of tasks that I really appreciate having a tablet. I like having the equivalent of a big, heavy bookshelf full of dictionaries and reference books and scores all on this slim little tablet that I can take anywhere. The information is accessible to me at any time and place, so I can work on the translation wherever I happen to be. With my translation document stored in the cloud using Evernote or Dropbox, I can read it or work on it regardless of whether I have my laptop, iPad, or phone with me.\n\nThere are some other kinds of translation tech resources that I haven’t looked into yet but would like to, for example, translation-related iPad apps (myLanguage Translator Pro looks interesting and has good reviews) and also dictionaries/references in app or ebook format that work offline. But I will have to save that for a future blog post.\n\nRelated Posts:\n\nComing up: Tech tools for working with music texts\n\nWorking with music texts, Part 1: Find the text online, then sync it to the cloud!\n\nDigital dictionaries for translating archaic words and spellings\n\nThe Diction Police podcast is, in my humble opinion, a must-have resource for every singer. The host, Ellen Rissinger, is a coach on the music staff of the Semperoper in Dresden. She invites native speakers who are singers, conductors, or coaches to read aloud the texts of arias or art songs in the standard repertoire (and sometimes not-so-standard repertoire). Then they have a discussion about the basic pronunciation rules, the finer points of diction, the most common mistakes non-native speakers make, and diction issues where experts may have differing opinions.\n\nThe podcast covers the standard languages of Italian, German, and French and has also ventured into Russian, Czech, Hungarian, Swedish, Norwegian, Spanish, and British and American English.\n\nThe podcast’s website has several useful indexes–you can browse episodes by language as well as by aria/song title, and there is an episode guide. It’s really useful for both general language/diction learning as well as polishing specific arias.\n\nOne thing I really like about the podcast is that Ms. Rissinger starts off most episodes with a short segment featuring study tips and career/life advice for musicians. It’s delivered in a friendly, non-preachy way and is usually accompanied by personal anecdotes of her own successes and screw-ups(!)–kind of like “things I wish I’d known when I started out.”\n\nAlso, her Seven Steps to Learn Music are my gold standard for learning repertoire.\n\nThe Diction Police podcast is an incredibly rich resource, and I think it speaks to Ms. Rissinger’s expertise, love of lifelong learning, and generosity of spirit that she produces it and makes it available for FREE. It is a great gift to the world of singers.\n\nYou can subscribe to The Diction Police through iTunes or with your favorite podcatcher app (I use DoggCatcher on my Android phone)."
