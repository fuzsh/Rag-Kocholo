He received a knighthood in 1977.\n\nPears studied at the University of Oxford, at the Royal College of Music, and then with Elena Gerhardt and Dawson Freer. In 1936 he met Britten, and in 1938 he gave the first of many song recitals with Britten as accompanist. The two men became lifelong companions. In 1942 Pears made his opera debut in London in Jacques Offenbach’s Tales of Hoffmann. He then joined the Sadler’s Wells Opera, where he created the title role in Britten’s Peter Grimes (1945). In 1946 Pears helped Britten found the English Opera Group, and in 1947 they were instrumental in founding the Aldeburgh Festival.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz"
