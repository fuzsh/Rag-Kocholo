        "text": "Hailed as “the world’s greatest tenor” by The Telegraph, superstar German tenor Jonas Kaufmann returns to Carnegie Hall’s Stern Auditorium / Perelman Stage on Friday, October 5 at 8:00 p.m. for a special one-night-only performance of hits from his bestselling album You Mean the World to Me.\n\nAccompanied by Orchestra of St. Luke’s, under the direction of conductor Jochen Rieder, this concert features hits from Germany’s Golden Era—a time when operetta and popular song were flourishing—ranging from the unbeatable hits of the “Golden 20s” to the songs of the new “talkie” era.\n\n“Tenors were superstars and were number one in the entertainment industry,” explained Kaufmann. “All of the composers were trying to compete with each other to give them the most beautiful melodies to sing and among them were famous opera singers like Richard Tauber, Joseph Schmidt, and Jan Kiepura, who had the pleasure of becoming film stars because of the ‘talkie’… so songs were composed, especially for these movies, and became hits all over the world.”\n\nReleased in 2014 on Sony Classical, Du bist die Welt für mich (You Mean the World to Me) became an instant bestseller on the German and Austrian classical music charts and even enjoyed unparalleled success on the pop album charts in these countries.\n\nSince his sensational debut at New York’s Metropolitan Opera in Verdi’s La traviata in 2006, Kaufmann has numbered among the top stars on the operatic horizon.\n\nKaufmann comes from Munich, where he completed his vocal studies at the Music Academy. He began his career at the opera houses of Saarbrücken and Stuttgart, and later became a member of the Zürich Opera. He now performs at the world’s leading opera houses, including the Paris Opera, La Scala, Vienna State Opera, Bavarian State Opera, and Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.\n\nAs much in demand for Italian and French repertoire as he is for German opera, Mr. Kaufmann’s intense characterizations of Don José in Bizet’s Carmen and the title role in Massenet’s Werther took opera fans by storm. Past performances in New York and London, and his highly acclaimed Puccini recital at La Scala, were broadcast in cinemas worldwide, as was his long-awaited role debut as Otello in Verdi’s opera of the same name at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in June 2017.\n\nOrchestra of St. Luke’s (OSL) began in 1974 as a group of virtuoso musicians performing chamber music concerts at Greenwich Village’s Church of St. Luke in the Fields. Now in its 44th season, the Orchestra performs diverse musical genres at New York’s major concert venues and has collaborated with artists ranging from Renée Fleming and Joshua Bell to Bono and Metallica. In fall 2018, celebrated expert in 18th- century music Bernard Labadie will begin his tenure as the Orchestra’s fifth Principal Conductor.\n\nOSL’s signature programming includes a subscription series presented by Carnegie Hall, now in its 32nd season; an annual multi–week collaboration with Paul Taylor American Modern Dance at Lincoln Center; an annual summer residency at Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts; and a chamber music festival featuring appearances at The Morgan Library & Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, and Merkin Concert Hall at Kaufman Music Center. The Orchestra has participated in 118 recordings, four of which have won Grammy Awards, has commissioned more than 50 new works, and has given more than 175 world, U.S., and New York City premieres. Nearly half of OSL’s performances each year are presented free of charge through its education and community programs, reaching over 10,000 New York City public school students. Additionally, OSL provides free instrumental coaching and presents student performances through its Youth Orchestra of St. Luke’s and its Mentorship Program for Pre-Professional Musicians."
