        "text": "What the others have already told you about \"classical\" and \"opera\" singers is accurate. Opera singers are classical singers--not all of them are sopranos. After all, operas are meant to be performed as staged, costumed musical plays (but with more difficult or sophisticated music compared to a real musical like \"Phantom of the Opera\" which is NOT an opera despite it's name). The opera \"Carmen\" is written for mezzo-soprano, and her rival suitors include a tenor and a baritone. There are also a number of sopranos who use a head voice (which people automatically label as \"opera singing\") that sing pop, Celtic, crossover type of music--but not opera. Sissel from Norway is one such singer; Enya is another, and Hayley Westenra, a child singer who has managed to preserve her voice into an adult career (mainly because she didn't try to push her voice like Charlotte Church). They are all fine singers, but not opera singers.\n\nTheoretically, any classical singer can be trained to sing opera. They would need training to sing classical music properly anyway, and anyone taking formal, traditional voice lessons would be given more than a few arias (those are songs from operas) to sing. However, since opera singers do need to have voices that project over a full orchestra, not all classical singers become professional opera singers. A certain \"size\" of voice is usually required, especially with roles in most Wagner and some Verdi operas. However as they have already pointed out, simply being loud isn't enough. A singer can't just stand there and literally push their voices so they sound like they are trying to shout or scream the music. There are many opera singers with smaller voices that do well in smaller venues (not all opera houses, especially those in smaller cities, are huge), or as recording artists. Certain timbres of voices also carry well, such as very high coloratura sopranos, After all, there is usually only one piccolo in a marching band.\n\nOpera singers usually do sing other types of classical music. A few of them will venture into non-classical music such as Broadway tunes or pop and even jazz. Opera singer Rene Fleming is one such singer who recently recorded albums of both jazz and rock music (soft rock, but rock).\n\nThey also quite frequently include in their recitals or as part of recordings, folk songs and other types of \"lighter music\". Usually in regard to folk songs, if a singer belongs to a certain ethnic background, they like to pick songs reflecting that heritage. African-American opera singers might include spirituals, Italian singers often do Neapolitan folk music (\"O Sole Mio\" is one frequent favorite), Irish tenors might include a rousing drinking song. Placido Domingo, the Spanish tenor raised mostly in Mexico, is fond of zarzuela which is a traditional Spanish entertainment that is very close to operetta and German singspiels (you can google these--basically they generally have more dialogue, and while considered classical, they are somewhat \"lighter\" entertainment reminiscent of musicals).\n\nAs for as taking many years of practice to learn to sing opera (or any classical music), let me clarify that a person can't just practice on their own. They have to take voice lessons. There are actual college degrees in opera performance.\n\nWhat is NOT true opera or true classical are those singers you see on popular talent shows. No little girls flapping their arms meaninglessly about as they try to sound like grown women while their wobbling chins betray their age and poor technique. No emo-goth kids who demonstrates an astounding falsetto range, but can only sing one or two arias that they managed to learn by mimicking others. Andrea Bocelli--that would take several pages to explain why he isn't consider a true opera singer by anyone who really knows and enjoys opera. Suffice it to say, that people are afraid to criticize someone blind, but he did get a degree---in law. Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins has a lovely voice and actual operatic training (she has a music degree and taught singing of all things) so it's surprising she isn't better--her pop music isn't much better than the opera. Maybe she focused more on her looks than her technique, who knows?\n\nPeople were actually outraged when they discovered that Britain's Got Talent winner Paul Potts actually had operatic TRAINING and had sung with several small opera companies. They thought this was \"cheating\".\n\nI notice also the attitude of people who feel that any singer or musician who has any sort of lessons--who isn't entirely self-taught--is somehow \"fake\". They feel that true talent should be completely \"natural\", but while you have to be born with a certain kind of voice for opera, you have to be trained to use it. Athletes have coaches too, and no one accuses a gymnast, a ball player, or even a runner as being \"fake\" because they receive training."
