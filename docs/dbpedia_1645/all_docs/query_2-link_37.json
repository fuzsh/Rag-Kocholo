        "text": "Act\n\nA portion of an opera with its own dramatic structure. Some operas have two acts, some have three or more, and there are also short, hard-hitting one act operas like Leoncavallo’s Pagliacci (Clowns).\n\nAria\n\nA section of music for one solo voice, during which the plot usually pauses and a character expresses their thoughts and feelings.\n\nBaritone\n\nLower male voice type between tenor and bass. In many Italian operas, this is the baddie – George Bernard Shaw wrote: “Opera is when a tenor and soprano want to make love, but are prevented from doing so by a baritone”!\n\nBass\n\nThe very lowest male voice type. These can be kings, philosophers, super villains, comic characters (like Don Basilio in Rossini’s The Barber of Seville) and more.\n\nBel canto\n\nItalian for ‘beautiful singing’ and name of a style of opera that dominated in the 18th/early 19th Centuries (most associated with composers Rossini, Bellini and Donizetti), where the emphasis was on vocal beauty and virtuosity rather than the drama.\n\nBizet, Georges\n\nFrench composer (1838-1875) who penned one of the most famous operas: Carmen.\n\nBravo\n\nWhat you call out (if you want!) after a particularly impressive aria. Remember it’s ‘Brava’ for a woman and ‘Bravi’ for more than one person.\n\nBritten, Benjamin\n\nEnglish composer (1913-1976) and central figure of 20th Century classical music. Recurring themes in his operas: an outsider versus a hostile society, and the corruption of innocence.\n\nChorus\n\nGroup of singers who form an onstage community of people. The Chorus of Opera North has 36 full time members, but this is often expanded, depending on the opera. Our production of Martinů’s The Greek Passion featured a chorus of 48, creating a powerful wall of sound.\n\nColoratura\n\nElaborate ornamentation of a vocal melody with lots of runs, leaps and trills.\n\nConcert staging\n\nPerformance where the orchestra is also on stage, visible to the audience, but there’s no less drama than a fully staged performance! See ‘What is a Concert Staging?’\n\nConductor\n\nIn overall charge of shaping the musical interpretation. Leads the orchestra and singers from the front, keeping everyone together.\n\nCountertenor\n\nMale voice type that sings in falsetto, with a range equivalent to a mezzo-soprano. Found a lot in early operas, where the roles would have originally been sung by ‘castrati’ (it’s what it sounds like), but also some more modern works, including Oberon in A Midsummer Night’s Dream by Britten.\n\nDirector\n\nPerson in charge of everything on stage, from the overall vision of the production, to the way the opera singers perform.\n\nDesigners\n\nThe people responsible for creating the look of the costumes, set and lighting. Often the same person designs both set and costumes.\n\nDress rehearsal\n\nFinal rehearsal before opening night in full costume etc. If you’d like to experience our dress rehearsals, you can join the Friends of Opera North.\n\nDuet\n\nSection of music for two singers, such as the passionate duet from the very end of Andrea Chénier, as he and lover Maddalena resolve go to the guillotine together…\n\nMozart, Wolfgang Amadeus\n\nComposer born in Salzburg (1756-1791), and one of the most famous of all time! He wrote 21 operas in total, the best known being The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni , Così fan tutte and The Magic Flute.\n\nMezzo-soprano\n\nLiterally ‘half soprano’, female voice type with a slightly lower range. Often plays older women, seductresses and young boys (‘witches, bitches and britches’) – except in Rossini operas, where the mezzo is often the heroine, such as Angelina in La Cenerentola (Cinderella).\n\nMonteverdi, Claudio\n\nItalian composer (1567-1643) who in 1607 wrote the first opera still regularly performed today, Orfeo.\n\nOperetta\n\nSub-genre of opera, usually comic, that contains dialogue and dance as well as singing. The most well-known English operettas are by the Victorian duo Gilbert & Sullivan, including the short Trial by Jury…\n\nOrchestra\n\nInstrumental ensemble that accompanies the singers. This can vary hugely in size depending on the opera and composer – a Handel opera might call for an orchestra of 24, while some Wagner operas are written for over 100 players.\n\nOverture\n\nOrchestral piece at the beginning of an opera, sometimes before curtain up, but often nowadays staged. Can also be called a ‘Prelude’. Hear the popular overture to Mozart’s Così fan tutte.\n\nPit\n\nA sunken area in front of and slightly under the stage in which the orchestra plays.\n\nProps\n\nSmall items that the performers carry with them or use on stage – handbags, daggers, wine glasses, iPhones, you name it.\n\nProgramme\n\nA booklet you can buy before the performance to find out more about the cast, story, and the production.\n\nPuccini, Giacomo\n\nItalian composer (1858-1924) behind some of the best-loved operas of all time: Madama Butterfly, Tosca and La bohème. Puccini’s output was almost solely opera – he wrote that God had commanded him to write only for the theatre!\n\nScore\n\nWhat we call the full composition, either referring to the music itself or the physical book! The conductor uses the ‘full score’, which includes every instrumental part.\n\nSet\n\nThe background/walls/furniture/setting in which the singers perform.\n\nSitzprobe\n\nLiterally means ‘seated rehearsal’ in German, this is often the first time the orchestra and singers rehearse together.\n\nSoprano\n\nHighest female voice type, often the leading lady. Here’s the soprano aria ‘O mio babbino caro’ from Puccini’s Gianni Schicchi.\n\nStrauss, Richard\n\nGerman composer (1864-1949) who pushed the boundaries of what opera could be! His first major success Salome featured a single chord so unorthodox and dissonant, it has been described as ‘epoch-making’…\n\nSurtitles\n\nThe words of the libretto (or English translation if the opera is in another language) are displayed on screens either side of the stage, so you’ll always know what’s going on!\n\nVerdi, Giuseppe\n\nComposer (1813–1901), often referred to as the father of Italian opera. He wrote some of the world’s most popular operas including La traviata, Aida and Rigoletto, and had a knack for taking figures marginalised by society and telling their stories.\n\nVerismo\n\nItalian for ‘realism’, a style of opera popular in the late 19th/early 20th Centuries depicting the gritty lives of ordinary people as opposed to kings and queens etc. Usually ends in violent death…\n\nVibrato\n\nComes from the Italian ‘to vibrate’, this is a wavering of the voice between two notes used by opera singers to create a richer sound.\n\nWagner, Richard\n\nGerman composer (1813-1883) who wrote operas of epic proportions often based on mythology, for orchestras (and voices!) much larger than ever before. His opera The Mastersingers of Nuremberg is the longest commonly performed opera at well over five hours.\n\nWigs\n\nKey part of a character’s costume. A production can feature a great number of different wigs, but these are kept and re-used, and if looked after properly can last for many years."
