        "text": "Over the centuries Germany has produced some of the greatest composers ever, from the 12th-century nun Hildegard von Bingen to the Baroque Bach and even the 21st-century film composer Hans Zimmer. These are true masters who have graced every period and era of classical music. From the earliest days of music to the present day, German composers have always stood out as the very best in class.\n\nundefined\n\nWho are the greatest German composers of all time?\n\nCPE Bach (1714-1788)\n\nJS Bach's son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach certainly inherited his father's genius. Bridging the gap between the Baroque period of his father and the start of Classical period, he proved to be one of the pioneers of this burgeoning music style. Just as his father was one of the greats of the Baroque era, his son would reign over the early days of the Classical period, when instrumental music was on the rise and the piano sonata was growing in popularity.\n\nCPE Bach was also a key figure of the Sturm und Drang movement\n\nJS Bach (1685-1750)\n\nWe named JS Bach one of the best Baroque composers ever and the greatest composer of all time. He is, unsurprisingly, a bit of a shoo-in to our list of best German composers. Born in 1685 into a prodigiously gifted musical family, Bach spent most of his career as an organist for churches and royal courts.\n\nGreatest French composers\n\nThe best Italian composers of all time\n\nTen of the best: Czech composers\n\nThrough his lifetime Bach produced countless masterpieces, including solo keyboard works, cantatas, concertos, oratorios, and solo and orchestral suites and his greatest composition is widely believed to be the St Matthew Passion. His keyboard works are particularly revered, particularly the Brandenburg Concertos and The Well-Tempered Clavier.\n\nLudwig van Beethoven (1770-1827)\n\nBeethoven needs little introduction and is one of the most famous composers ever. Born in 1770, he straddled both the Classical and Romantic eras, and his wide-ranging music dominated the musical landscape at the time. He is the composer credited with reinventing classical music and developing the symphony, bringing revolutionary new ideas to composition. Like Bach, Beethoven's stature goes way beyond one of the best German composers: he had a simply colossal impact on the history of classical music.\n\nThe 20 greatest symphonies of all time\n\nWhere would we be without Beethoven's Fifth Symphony...?\n\nJohannes Brahms (1833-1897)\n\nWhile Brahms's music had elements familiar to those from the Classical era, it had a Romantic spirit and much of it was composed in Vienna. When growing up in Hamburg, he was fascinated by folk tales and songs and his music is famous for being intensely dark – and is notoriously difficult to play. He was influenced Beethoven, Schubert and Schumann.\n\nComposer Mark Simpson says: 'The best of Brahms exists in the moments when he transcends his grounded, earthy sense of being and take us to a higher state of spiritual awareness – the passage between the human and the spiritual world. He was in essence deeply human but also had a developed spiritual side that he had access to. It’s this striving for a higher state of expressive consciousness that I take most from his work.'\n\nMore of the best German composers\n\nChristoph Willibald Gluck (1714-1787)\n\nOpera composer Gluck was a powerful music dramatist and crucial operatic innovator. This widely travelled and cosmopolitan composer spanned the early Classical period and his determination to make opera simpler and free of frills would reform the art form far beyond his own works.\n\nMax Lompert says: 'Gluck at the time of his death perhaps the world’s most famous opera composer, and now (I believe) opera’s most neglected and misunderstood creator of front-rank importance, has since 1787 been ignored in Britain neither more nor less than elsewhere.'\n\nThe greatest operas of all time\n\nGeorge Frideric Handel (1685-1759)\n\nHandel was given British civilian status by George II and lived much of his life in London. But he was born in Germany. It's thus only right that such an eminent composer belongs on this list of best German composers. He was a master of opera and oratorio and one of the greatest opera composers ever, whose psychological insight and deep humanity, together with his genius as a composer and outstanding gift as a melodist resulted in works which in no essential respect are bound just to their own time.\n\nHandel's most famous pieces include Messiah, the Water Music, his Keyboard suites, and Dixit Dominus. And, of course, 'Zadok The Priest’, played at every coronation.\n\nWhen was Handel's coronation anthem Zadok the Priest first performed?\n\nHildegard von Bingen (1098-1179)\n\nLittle is known about the life of 12th-century composing nun Hildegard von Bingen. But her music provides the bedrock for many vocal composition techniques and is still featured on concert programmes around the world.\n\nBorn in Rheinhessen, Hildegard von Bingen composed more than 80 spiritual pieces of choral music, including Symphony of the Harmony of Heavenly Revelations. She was one of the pioneers of the Early Music period, when the voice was massively important and the instrument of choice for many.\n\nThe Music of Hildegard von Bingen\n\nWe have named her one of the most famous female composers ever\n\nPaul Hindemith (1895-1963)\n\nThe Nazi party not only banned his Mathis der Maler Symphony but also condemned his music for being 'degenerate' and 'Jewish connected.' Hindemith was a prolific German composer, who spent much of his career falling in and out of favour with the Nazi party. He came to prominence in the 1920s with works such as. During his early years as a composer he was influenced by the Romantics, before moving to Expressionism. By the 1920s he had become a major advocate of the Neue Sachlichkeit (new objectivity) style of music.\n\nBest German composers: Felix and Fanny Mendelssohn\n\nFelix Mendelssohn (1809-1847)\n\nMendelssohn was the most talented child prodigy of all time. At 15, his teacher claimed Mendelssohn’s talents were equal to those of Bach, Haydn and Mozart. His music incorporates the elegance and balance of the Classical era, while still evoking the fantasy of the Romantic.\n\nHis most famous pieces include his Piano Concerto No. 1 and Midsummer Night’s Dream Overture.\n\nThe greatest piano concertos of all time\n\nWe named Mendelssohn one of the greatest Romantic composers of all time\n\nFanny Mendelssohn (1805-1847)\n\nThe daughter of a bourgeois German family, Fanny Mendelssohn displayed great musical talent from a young age. Although she was encouraged to write and to play, her family did not believe music was a respectable career for a young woman. So, while her brother Felix travelled Europe with his compositions, Fanny stayed at home.\n\nHowever, she didn't allow this to discourage her. Over her lifetime Fanny Mendelssohn penned 460 pieces, including the Piano Trio in D, Quartet in E flat and a Piano Sonata in G minor, as well as many exquisite songs and a piano cycle, Das Jahr. She is certainly one of the greatest female composers of all time.\n\nJohann Pachelbel (1653-1706)\n\nBorn in 1653, Pachelbel is particularly known for his organ music. With over 200 pieces to his name, he played a significant part in developing the chorale prelude and fugue. His influences include composers Johann Jakob Froberger, Johann Caspar Kerll, Girolamo Frescobaldi and Alessandro Poglietti, and his music enjoyed great popularity during his lifetime.\n\nBest German composers: Robert and Clara Schumann\n\nRobert Schumann (1810-1856)\n\nRobert Schumann was not only a turbulent genius. He was a forward-thinking intellectual, wielding a literary pen as sharp as his musical one. He championed younger composers, especially Brahms, and helped the reputation of others such as Chopin and Mozart. Fusing literary and musical thinking was central to his philosophy.\n\nRobert Schumann was best known for his piano music, Lieder and orchestral works. Much of his music is inspired by literature and poems.\n\nClara Schumann (1819-1896)\n\nChild prodigy, sought-after concert pianist, mother of seven surviving children, Clara Schumann was also a burgeoning composer in a male-dominated musical world and was often seen more as her husband’s helper than a composer in her own right. Learning to compose in childhood she went on to write a wide range of music. This ranged from Lieder and fugues to chamber and orchestral works, each expressing her distinctive style of composition.\n\nHowever sadly most of her work was never played by anyone other than Schumann herself. Clara remained in the shadows until her music was rediscovered in the 1970s.\n\nKarlheinz Stockhausen (1928-2007)\n\nKarlheinz Stockhausen was a seminal figure in post-1945 Modernism and one of the most experimental and progressive composers of the 20th century. He redefined notions of what types of sound could be deemed acceptable in composition. He also took a pioneering approach with his use of electronics in art music.\n\nRichard Strauss (1864-1849)\n\nThis late-Romantic composer was particularly famous for his richly scored tone poems and heady operas. He composed almost right up to his death, completing his final masterpiece Four Last Songs in 1949 aged 85.\n\nComposer Colin Matthews says: 'It is all too easy to overlook Richard Strauss’s significance, but in the remarkable sequence of tone poems spanning 25 years, from Don Juan to the Alpine Symphony, he showed both an orchestral mastery and a remarkable capacity for invention and structural innovation.'\n\nOne of the best Romantics, and one of the best German composers.\n\nRichard Wagner (1813-1883)\n\nRichard Wagner truly was opera’s colossus, revolutionising the form and popularising the use of Leitmotifs – musical phrases corresponding to specific characters – in operas of the 19th century.\n\nComposer Jonathan Dove says: 'The scale of Wagner’s imagination is overwhelming. He created spectacular musical imagery of unsurpassed vividness, and had a revolutionary approach to memory and time. Whether you find his music toxic or intoxicating, you can’t ignore it.'\n\nWeber (1786-1826)\n\nThe premiere of Weber's first opera Der Freischütz not only announced his arrival as a great opera composer. It also marked the arrival of German Romanticism in music as a force to be reckoned with. It was a medium where previously Italy and French had reigned supreme. German-language works had hitherto been regarded as nothing more than provincial curiosities.\n\nWeber would go onto be a pioneer of German Romantic opera. He would pave the way for other German opera composers such as Marschner, Meyerbeer and, perhaps the most famous opera composer of them all, Wagner.\n\nHans Zimmer (b. 1957)\n\nZimmer is undisputed king of Hollywood film scores. One of the greatest film composers in the world, he is particularly known for composing the film scores for Pirates of the Caribbean series. But his CV also includes The Dark Knight, Inception and even the Lion King, for which he won an Oscar."
