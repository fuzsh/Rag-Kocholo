Contrary to the name, opera singers do more than sing; just as opera combines music and theater, opera singers merge their astounding musical skill with impressive acting and movement ability in order to bring the work of librettists and composers to life.\n\nWhen not in rehearsal for a show or during the off-season, opera singers spend much of their time learning new material.\n\nWhether cast as a soloist or a chorus member, an opera singer's work on a production begins with theatrical rehearsals, in which performers focus on reading and interpreting the text almost as if it were a play. Concurrently, soloists, chorus members, and the orchestra gather for separate musical rehearsals under the direction of the conductor, who is frequently also the production's music director. In the final weeks leading up to opening night, opera singers may spend as many as six hours each day in rehearsals, with soloists often receiving additional one-on-one instruction from a vocal coach or répétiteur."
