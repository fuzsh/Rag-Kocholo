        "text": "Transcript\n\nWhen you hear the phrase “German music,” you might immediately think of “oom-pah” folk music playing during an Oktoberfest celebration. But German music is much more than that — in fact, Germany has produced some of the greatest musicians in history across a stunning variety of genres. From classical and baroque compositions to electronic dance music and industrial rock, here’s a timeline of Germany’s many musical achievements.\n\nThe most famous German musicians may be the so-called “three Bs” of German music — Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms.\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach was born in 1685 and worked in the Baroque era of music and is considered one of the greatest composers of all time.\n\nA century later, in 1770, Ludwig van Beethoven was born. A towering figure in classical music, Beethoven is responsible for some of the most recognizable music in the world.\n\nJohannes Brahms was a classical composer born in 1833, carrying the tradition of classical music through into the Romantic era.\n\nIn the 20th century, the influence of classical music began to wane, and music was played in clubs and dance halls. Cabaret music spread through Europe from France, and Germany was an important part of that tradition.\n\nGerman American actress Marlene Dietrich became a musical sensation after portraying a cabaret singer in The Blue Angel in 1930.\n\nAnd of course, the famous musical Cabaret is set in a Berlin nightclub in 1931.\n\nWhen modern pop and rock music swept the world, Germany was no exception. The influence of electronic music contributed to the rise of the so-called krautrock genre.\n\nA broad term applied to a number of German bands in the 1970s, krautrock included electronic music pioneers Tangerine Dream, whose first album dropped in 1970.\n\nKraftwerk, who premiered in 1971, were another influential electronic music act.\n\nThe 1980s saw a new wave of music sweep across Germany — and part of that was, well, New Wave.\n\nNeue Deutsche Welle, or German New Wave, produced international hits like Nena’s “99 Luftballons” in 1983.\n\nGermany’s schlager pop music can seem sickly sweet to many.\n\nBut artists like Andrea Berg, who released her first album in 1992, have strings of number one hits across the German-speaking world.\n\nIn much of the world, Germany may be best known today for more aggressive rock music. 1984 saw two important debut albums.\n\nPunk rockers Die Toten Hosen came onto the scene with Unter Falscher Flagge.\n\nAnd influential industrial rock band KMFDM premiered their first record, Opium.\n\nAnd in the 90s, Germany experienced another new wave — this time Neue Deutsche Härte, or “New German Hardness”, a phrase coined to describe the hammering heavy metal of Rammstein.\n\nRammstein’s 1997 single “Du Hast” made them international rock stars.\n\nToday, the most popular German music, as in much of Europe, tends to be a mix of techno, pop, and hip-hop. These are just a few 21st-century artists to watch.\n\nTechno-rave band Scooter is one of the top-selling German acts of the 21st century.\n\nRapper Bonez MC is one of Germany’s most successful artists,and has collaborated with other famous acts to great acclaim.\n\nAnd Dance group Cascada has sold over 30 million albums since their 2006 debut.\n\nSo, dig deeper into Germany’s rich musical culture. Whether you like classical, EDM, hip-hop, or heavy metal, there’s something there you’ll love."
