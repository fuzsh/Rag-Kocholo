        "text": "One of Schubert's greatest works, that he barely finished before his death at age 31, was Winterreise. A song cycle based on the poems of the poems of Wilhelm Muller, Winterreise is a musical voyage for solo voice and piano that deals with the dark themes of rejection, sorrow, loneliness, and death. The paper analyzes the 24 songs of the cycle, demonstrating the powerful relationship between text and music, and between voice and piano, in this great vocal work.\n\nThis article traces the concert performance history of Schubert’s song cycle Winterreise, D. 911, during the second half of the nineteenth century. It begins by presenting a two-part theoretical framework, according to which the songs are understood as ontologically related to Friedrich Schlegel’s idea of the fragment, while the theoretical and practical treatments by musicians, critics, and scholars are viewed in relation to Walter Benjamin’s contrasting ideas of the “collector” and the “allegorist.” It then examines the practices of key figures such as the baritone Julius Stockhausen, a pioneer in lieder performance, and his circle, including Clara Schumann and Johannes Brahms. Their performance and programming strategies are then contextualized against a larger statistical survey of the Winterreise songs in public concerts within the Austro-German realm, drawing on surviving concert programs and press reports. This shows that, in performance, individual songs were treated as fragments to be reassembled in many ways, inviting fresh interpretive possibilities on the part of listeners. Further contextualization is provided by a brief survey of Winterreise in print and as discussed in critical writing, revealing that here too there existed different approaches to the work as “whole” and “fragment.” Ultimately, I argue that the coherence of such cycles is not intrinsic but constructed over time by multiple actors—performers, listeners, publishers, and critics—and that an awareness of this creates new possibilities for the understanding and performance of multipart works.\n\nOver the past several decades, professional organizations like the American Choral Directors Association and International Federation of Choral Music have had significant impact on promoting choral music in universities, colleges, and public schools. The explosion of professional choral ensembles and extensive discography of recordings that these elite groups produce has exponentially raised the bar of choral excellence. As a result, choral culture—in both the United States and abroad—is thriving in the twenty-first century. The rich catalog of works produced by the women composers introduced in this article deserve to be explored, programmed, sung, and celebrated on a regular basis. If we do not actively engage in this effort, think of the magnificent choral repertoire that we, and future generations, will never have the privilege of hearing or singing.\n\nThe activity of song translation is not only of scholarly interest in the field of musicology, but also informs translation studies due to the focus it places on the relationship between linguistic content and form. Moreover, translating canonical works like Schubert’s Lieder provides a rich, multidimensional perspective on such secondary topics as cultural history, comparative literature and even international relations. While choices faced by poetic translators typically involve an unavoidable trade-off between faithfulness to the semantic content of the source and preservation of its poetic form, translators who want their texts to be sung must resolve this trade-off according to the primary criterion of singability. In this paper, a discussion of the choices faced by a contemporary English translator of Müller-Schubert’s Winterreise song cycle is presented in terms of singability and intelligibility.\n\nThis exploratory study focuses on the relationship between vocal expression, musical structure, and emotion in recorded performances by famous singers of three Schubert songs. Measurement of variations in tempo, dynamics, and pitch showed highly systematic relationships with the music&#39;s structural and emotional characteristics, particularly as regards emotional activity and valence. Relationships with emotional activity were consistent across both singers and musical pieces, while relationships with emotional valence were piece-specific. Clear changes in performing style over the twentieth century were observed, including diminishing rubato, an increase followed by a decrease of the use of pitch glides, and a widening and slowing of vibrato. These systematic changes over time concern only the style of performance, not the strategies deployed to express the structural and emotional aspects of the music."
