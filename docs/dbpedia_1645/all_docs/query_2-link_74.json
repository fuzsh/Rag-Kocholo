        "text": "Germany is, on statistical grounds, the most operatic country on earth. The Bundesrepublik has more than eighty permanent opera houses, which in a typical season present seven or eight thousand performances—about a third of the global total, according to the Web site Operabase. By contrast, Italy, the birthplace of the art, manages fewer than two thousand. As opportunities elsewhere dwindle, the German system has become a crucial mechanism by which opera careers are made. Countless younger singers from around the world have undergone the ritual of a Festvertrag—a fixed-term contract to sing a variety of roles at a single German house. With so many productions, directors feel free to try out new ideas, some outlandish and some revelatory. New works surface regularly; forgotten scores are given a second chance. Public funding makes this quasi-utopia possible: before the pandemic, federal, state, and local entities were spending 2.7 billion euros each year on theatre.\n\nFor years, I had read stories about the German opera industry without really having experienced it firsthand. I’d visited the celebrated companies of Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, and Dresden but not the dozens of smaller houses that flesh out the network. So, on a recent trip to Germany, I ignored the metropolitan centers and took fresh exits off the Autobahn. The array of offerings available during a four-day stretch was staggering. Beyond the usual surfeit of Mozart, Verdi, Wagner, and Puccini, I could have seen Martinů’s “The Greek Passion,” in Osnabrück; Auber’s “La Muette de Portici,” in Kassel; Glass’s “In the Penal Colony,” in Gera; or three different stagings of “Der Rosenkavalier,” in Dessau, Nuremberg, and Trier. I settled on an itinerary in central and eastern Germany: “Aida” in Chemnitz, “The Marriage of Figaro” in Erfurt, and “Die Walküre” in Coburg. The combined population of the three cities adds up to half a million—less than Kansas City’s.\n\nWhat’s most striking to an American opera tourist is how cheap tickets are. At the stops on my trip, prices ranged from fifteen to fifty-two euros, with further discounts for students. In many places, people with limited resources can get in for free. How long these lavish subsidies can persist is an open question: fears of cutbacks are always circulating, and studies indicate a gradual erosion of interest in classical music. For now, though, the system seems secure, with the performing arts widely considered a form of Lebensmittel—basic nourishment. The German minister of culture, Claudia Roth, who once served as a dramaturge in Dortmund and also managed a rock band, recently announced a seven-per-cent increase in arts funding.\n\nThe old industrial city of Chemnitz bore the name Karl-Marx-Stadt during the East German period. A gigantic bust of Marx remains the city’s chief landmark; dour Warsaw Pact architecture still predominates. Leftist Chemnitz takes pride in its Communist heritage, although the far right has an ominous presence, as violent anti-immigrant demonstrations in 2018 made plain. The operatic arm of Theater Chemnitz, which also presents ballet, plays, and concerts, makes use of an imposing neo-Baroque theatre that was opened in 1909, destroyed in 1945, rebuilt by 1951, and modernized in the late eighties and early nineties. The auditorium seats seven hundred and twenty; the acoustics are dry but clear.\n\nTheater Chemnitz is noted for its adventurous repertory, having exhumed such rarities as Meyerbeer’s “Vasco da Gama,” Pfitzner’s “Die Rose vom Liebesgarten,” and Kienzl’s “Der Evangelimann.” The company has also offered a feminist take on Wagner’s “Ring,” with four women directing. The “Aida,” the brainchild of the producing team of Renaud Doucet and André Barbe, mixed novelty and familiarity. It is the year 1870, and we are at the Paris villa of the Egyptologist Auguste Mariette, who had the initial idea for “Aida” and who supervised sets and costumes for the opera’s première, in Cairo, in 1871. Trapped at home by the Franco-Prussian War, Mariette oversees a rehearsal of the work, with friends, servants, soldiers, and two mischievous children joining in. You have the sense that Mariette—a silent role, played by Rolf Germeroth—is defying the chaos of war by escaping into an aesthetic sphere. In later acts, the framing device recedes and the central drama takes over. The final tableau is entrancing and haunting: as Aida and Radamès die in isolation, Mariette and the rest of the motley company from the villa come back into view, staring into historical oblivion. Ingeniously, the staging gestures toward scenic grandeur without actually needing elaborate sets.\n\nA committed cast of singers adroitly negotiated this tricky layering of identities. The Russian soprano Olga Shurshina, as Aida, showed a big, opulent voice, typically Slavic in its quick vibrato and chesty timbre. Aided by deep breath support, she spun out generous legato phrases and structured her major arias confidently. Hector Sandoval, as Radamès, lacked ringing tone but created a rapt, affecting aura in his “Celeste Aida.” Most crucial to the evening’s success was Diego Martin-Etxebarria, Chemnitz’s principal resident conductor, who expertly marshalled Verdi’s marches and choruses while highlighting subtleties of orchestration in between. The Met’s monumental, literal-minded “Aida” has accustomed me not to think too much about Verdi’s final grand opera; the team in Chemnitz goes considerably deeper.\n\nErfurt’s operatic topography is, in a way, the reverse of Chemnitz’s. Where the Chemnitz theatre is a relic of a largely destroyed prewar cityscape, Theater Erfurt resides in a sleek modern structure surrounded by an unusually well-preserved medieval city. From the upper lobby, you can see the spires of Erfurt’s immense Gothic cathedral, glowing at sunset. In this case, newer is better. The theatre, designed by Jörg Friedrich and opened in 2003, is not just a chic place to spend an evening but a thoroughly satisfying venue in which to hear opera. The acoustics are warm and bright; voices project without effort; sight lines throughout the eight-hundred-seat auditorium are good. (In the wake of Germany’s Omicron wave, attendance lagged, and I was able to move around at will.)\n\nThe “Figaro” staging, a collaboration between the director Martina Veh and the set designer Momme Hinrichs, recalls one of those saucy TV shows, like “Bridgerton” and “The Great,” which mash together period settings and modern manners. Rococo costumes are done up in garish colors; courtly gestures go hand in hand with libertinage. Everyone is sleeping with everyone else; at one point, Susanna and the Countess paw at Cherubino’s crotch. The promiscuity had the unfortunate effect of lowering the stakes of the drama: the lofty heartbreak of the Countess’s “Dove sono” makes less sense if she has a horny page at her disposal. Still, Veh carries off her vision with comic flair and a sharply unified style.\n\nI’ve seldom seen a “Figaro” cast that had such a spirited sense of ensemble. It helped that, as at so many German houses, the singers truly are an ensemble: working together season after season, they develop keen theatrical rapport. Shenanigans involving trapdoors and pullout beds went off with Lubitschean precision. Vocal standouts included Máté Sólyom-Nagy’s rugged Figaro, Florence Losseau’s spicy Cherubino, and Kakhaber Shavidze’s stentorian Bartolo. Samuel Bächli, who recently retired as Erfurt’s general music director, propelled the action with elegant, spry conducting. Each act seemed to dance by in a matter of minutes.\n\nCoburg, with a population of forty-one thousand, is by far the smallest of the cities I visited. American municipalities of equivalent size are Manassas, Virginia, and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Neither has lately staged Wagner. Coburg is, however, no ordinary town; the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha possessed inordinate influence in the nineteenth century, not least as a gene pool for the British Royal Family. Queen Victoria’s husband, Prince Albert, and her mother, Princess Victoria, were both born in Coburg. The Landestheater, a handsome neoclassical pile with four hundred and ninety-one seats, was built at the behest of Ernst I, Albert’s father. Schloss Ehrenburg, the ducal residence, is across the plaza. Beforehand, I made sure to sample the famous Coburger bratwurst, which is grilled over a pinecone fire.\n\nThe Coburg “Walküre,” directed by Alexander Müller-Elmau, is the second installment of a “Ring” cycle in progress. The concept mixes mythic and contemporary elements: fur garments over tank tops, punk Valkyries on swings, a television broadcasting the company’s production of “Das Rheingold.” There are a few too many reminiscences of past “Ring”s—the fateful pendulum from Patrice Chéreau’s 1976 staging at Bayreuth makes a pointless appearance—but Wagner’s sublime tangle of politics and emotion comes across.\n\nBecause a full-sized Wagner orchestra wouldn’t fit into Coburg’s pit, the company made do with a reduced complement of fifty-eight players. The conductor was Daniel Carter, Coburg’s young, Australian-born music director. Although the ensemble sounded scrappy in places, I found it refreshing to hear Wagner on intimate terms, with psychology trumping spectacle. The vocal discovery of the night was the young Swedish soprano Åsa Jäger, who sang Brünnhilde with clarion tone, crisp diction, and infectious zest. This run of performances marks not only Jäger’s German début but also her début in any Wagner role. I suspect that later in her career she will look back fondly on Coburg, where her ascent began. The ultimate appeal of operagoing in Germany is to see a venerable art form experiencing continuous rebirth. ♦"
