        "text": "Sapphic Opera & Classical Music\n\nGrowing up as a preppy punk > indie > new order > trip hop kid, forgive me, I had a great distain for opera and classical music! Through my love of cinema, my heart missed-a-beat to my introduction of opera arias via:\n\nDiva, directed by Jean-Jacques Beineix which featured Wilhelmenia Fernandez performing \"La Wally\" composed by Alfredo Catalani, to a libretto by Luigi Illica.\n\nClassical Music via\n\nThe Hunger, directed by Tony Scott which featured LÃ©o Delibes' LakmÃ©: The Flower Duet and, Franz Schubert's Piano Trio No. 2 in E-flat major.\n\nWow - a lovely flash back now, to cruising down Princess Street, Edinburgh, with my so missed Mummy and my gorgeous two dackles in the back, listening to my mixtapes of classical music / opera ...\n\nThough I researched hard, this section of lesbian opera singers & lesbian classical musicians, proved surpringsly hard to find lesbians to girly salute to. Even my best cake boy friend, Baroque Boy (a professional baroque flautist), found it hard to suggest some stellar lesbian opera singers and classical musicians.\n\nI can only assume that there is not enough documentation on the internet of lesbian opera singers and classical musicians and, like many work sectors there is still sadly a taboo about being out. To the lesbian (ladies) of opera and classical music, which I have documented on this page, I thank you for having the courage to be out and, be an inspiration to aspiring opera singers, classical musicians.\n\nDuring my research on lesbian opera singers I came across two terms, that surprised me:\n\nTravesti\n\nTravesti (meaning \"disguised\" in French) which I had not come across before though I could suss the meaning. Travesti was a theatrical term referring to the portrayal of a character in a ballet, opera or play, by a performer of the opposite sex. Because the presence of actual women on stage was considered immoral (seriously?), until the late 17th century (covering Shakespearian plays) in England and the late 18th century in the Papal States, women were portrayed by male actors in drag.\n\nOn the English stage, with the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, women started performing, both in the female roles and, in male roles. Of the 375 plays produced in London, between 1660 and 1700, it has been estimated that nearly a quarter contained one or more roles performed by actresses dressed as men.\n\nUranian\n\nOpera Singer Felicita Vestvali was bizarrely described as being \"Uranian\" by Rosa von Braunschweig, a longtime friend who wrote in the Yearbook of Intermediate Sexual Types (1903). I had never come across the term \"Uranian\".\n\nThe term \"Uranian\" was first published by Karl Heinrich Ulrichs (1825 â 95) in a series of five booklets (1864â65) collected under the title \"Forschungen Ã¼ber das RÃ¤thsel der mannmÃ¤nnlichen Liebe\" (Research into the Riddle of ManâMale Love). Ulrichs derived the term \"Uranian\" (Urning in German) from the Greek goddess Aphrodite Urania, who was created out of the god Uranus'... testicles. \"Uranian\" represented the homosexual gender.\n\nThe term \"Dionian\" (Dioning) represented the heterosexual gender and was derived from Aphrodite Dionea. Apparently, Ulrichs developed his terminology before the first public use of the term homosexual, which appeared in 1869 in a pamphlet published anonymously by Karl-Maria Kertbeny.\n\nAt first I thought how could Rosa von Braunschweig label her friend, popular Opera Singer Felicita Vestvali, so disturbingly as \"Uranian\"? On further investigation I discovered, that I think she was defending homosexuality. To be honest, I am worried to qoute it here as it is published as a \"Google book\" and I dont want Google to de-index this page. I am already dicing with de-indexation fire due to possible copyright infringement of images. Search for Rosa von Braunschweig on \"Women as Hamlet: Performance and Interpretation in Theatre, Film and Fiction\" by Tony Howard\n\nCheck out more delightful Lesbian terms through history.\n\nP.S. Translation of Lakme:\n\n\"Sous le dÃ´me Ã©pais, OÃ¹ le blanc jasmin, Ã la rose sâassemble, Sur la rive en fleurs, Riant au matin, Viens, descendons ensemble\".\n\n\"Under the thick dome where the white jasmine, with the roses entwined together. On the river bank covered with flowers laughing in the morning, let us descend together!\"\n\nHenriÃ«tte Bosmans\n\nDutch-Jewish composer and pianist: 1895 â 1952\n\nHenriÃ«tte Bosmans was a well-established Dutch composer and pianist whose oeuvre includes chamber music, orchestral works, and many songs ... more\n\n... Aged 20, HenriÃ«tte made her debut as a concert pianist in 1915, in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Between 1929 and 1949 she gave over 22 concerts with the Concertgebouw Orchestra and performed throughout Europe with leading conductors as Ernest Ansermet (Swiss), Pierre Monteux (French) and Willem Mengelberg (Dutch). In America, violinist Ruth Posselt performed HenriÃ«tte's compositions with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra (1940) and the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1941).\n\nHenriÃ«tte's mother, pianist Sarah Bosmans nee Benedicts, was a Jew. During WW2 and the German occupation of the Netherlands, HenriÃ«tte and her mother were (as were the circa 140,000 Dutch Jews in the Netherlands) under the scrutiny of the Dutch authorities. By 1942, HenriÃ«tte was not allowed to perform on public stages in the Netherlands and had to support herself and her mother, with underground house concerts (\"Black Evenings\"). Her mother, aged 83, was arrested in 1944 and deported to Westerbork Transit Camp, but HenriÃ«tte and others intervened to rescue her mother from further detention. One of her songs \"became an anthem of liberation\" as the war ended, and Allied soldiers arrived in the Netherlands. HenriÃ«tte's mother survived the war but her Aunt was murdered at Auschwitz and her cousin was killed with his wife and daughter at Sobibor.\n\nAfter the war, HenriÃ«tte published her compositions and between 1949 and 1952, wrote a series of songs for her close friend, French mezzo-soprano NoÃ©mie PÃ©rugia.\n\nHenriÃ«tte swung for both teams - she had relationships with both men and women, with whom she often also collaborated musically. Between 1920 â 1927 she had a relationship with Dutch cellist and conductor Frieda Belinfante who became a Dutch Resistance hero. In 1923, Frieda premiered HenriÃ«tte' Second Cello Concerto.\n\nHenriÃ«tte Bosmans was knighted in the Royal Order of Orange Nassau, in 1951. Posthumously, the Society of Dutch Composers began offering a $3,500 HenriÃ«tte Bosmans Prize from 1994, onwards. Her oeuvre is still admired and in 2020, North American musicians Leah Plave and Dan Sato made a new recording of the complete works of Bosmans for cello and piano. An extensive list of her works can be found at forbiddenmusicregained.org\n\nFYI = The Netherlands was invaded by the German Reich on the 10 May 1940. In January 1941, the German authorities required all Jews to register themselves as Jews. A total of 159,806 persons registered, including 19,561 persons born of mixed marriages and circa 25,000 Jewish refugees who had fled from the German Reich and Nazi persecution / deportation.\n\nDeportations of Jews from the Netherlands began in the summer of 1942. The last train left Westerbork Transit Camp for Auschwitz Concentration Camp on September 3, 1944. During these two years, the Germans and their Dutch collaborators deported some 107,000 Jews, mostly to Auschwitz and Sobibor Extermination Camp, where they were murdered. Only 5,200 Dutch Jews survived.\n\nMore than 75% of Dutch Jews were murdered in the Holocaust. Source: The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\n\nless\n\nFrieda Belinfante\n\nDutch philharmonic Conductor & Cellist: 1904 â 1995\n\nFrieda Belinfante was a talented Dutch-Jewish cellist, one of the first female conductors, a hero of the Dutch resistance and victim of American homophobia ... more\n\n... Frieda father, Aron Belinfante, was a prominent pianist and music teacher in Amsterdam who was the first pianist to present the entire cycle of Beethoven piano sonatas during a single (in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw - one of the finest concert halls in the world due to it's superb acoustics). Aged 17, she made her debut, playing the cello at the Concertgebouw . Frieda's repertoire spanned all periods including works from the Baroque to contemporary living composers of the period. As a guest conductor, she made weekly appearances on the Dutch National Radio, and conducted orchestras across the Netherlands and in Northern Europe. In 1937, the Het Klein Orkest, a chamber orchestra, was formed which she was the artistic director and conductor, making her the first woman in Europe to be artistic director and conductor of an ongoing professional orchestral ensemble.\n\nDespite the Netherlands being neutral, at the start of WW2, Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940. Frieda managed to hold her position at the Het Klein Orkest until 1941 but she was target for the Nazis - she was half-Jewish, and... gay. During the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, Frieda joined a Dutch resistance group. She helped arrange hiding places for those who were sought by the Nazis and forged identity documents for people hiding from the Nazis and their collaborators. In March 1943, she helped plan an attack to blow up the Amsterdam Population Registry - to prevent the Nazis from discovering which documents were forged. The operation was declared a partial success and the explosion led to the destruction of 800,000 Jewish IDs (15% of those kept there). After many other members of the Netherlands-based gay resistance group were executed in 1943 by occupying Nazi authorities, she was driven to hide herself.\n\nTo hide from Nazi authorities: âFor three months I was disguised as a man, and very successfullyâ¦ I passed my mother several times â¦ she never recognized me.â\n\nIn December 1943, Frieda escaped to Switzerland staying in a Swiss refuge camp and four years later immigrated to the United States (in 1947).\n\nFrida had a seven year relationship (1920 â 1927) with Dutch Jewish composer HenriÃ«tte Bosmans and in 1923, Frida premiered HenriÃ«tte' Second Cello Concerto. The relationship dissolved when Frida got married to a flute player but the marriage only lasted five years. Thereafter, Frida stayed swung back to girls.\n\nIncredulously, while living in America, Frida was fired, in 1962, from being the manager of Orange Countyâs Philharmonic (the first woman in this position) for being a lesbian. A man who coveted her position, informed the board of directors regarding her sexual orientation, and she was fired. The humiliation of being fired for her sexual orientation made Frieda sadly choose not to return to a public position, and she spent the rest of her life as a private cello teacher. How utterly unjust and robbed. Imagine the beautiful music she would have shared with the public and they would have enjoyed. And the bitterest pill... she survived Nazi persecution (and fought back) but, as such, didn't survive American homophobia.\n\nFrieda's recorded output was sparse and poorly maintained. Though none of the pre-war recorded radio performances survive, critical reviews exist internationally that document Frieda's musical talent.\n\nFrieda Belinfante's life is the subject of two documentaries But I Was a Girl (1998) and Willem & Frieda - Defying Nazis (2023) by Stephen Fry. Watch Frieda Belinfante's interview, for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, recorded sadly, nine months before she passed away when she was aged ninety.\n\nless"
