        "text": "Elena Gerhardt was one of the greatest lieder singers of the 20th century. She was unique in that she appeared in both opera and lieder recitals. This is not usually the case. I have been very particular about the lieder that I have chosen. There are many postings on youtube, where the material dates from about 1925-1930. These recordings have been remastered to remove the surface noise. Unfortunately, unless you know what you’re doing, removing the surface noise also removes half the voice. I have selected Japanese reissues of vinyl records that have not been cleaned up. You will hear surface noise but you will also hear Elena Gerhardt’s voice.\n\nThere are several things that I would like to point out. There is no pressure on this voice. In her later recordings, there might be problems with pitch, but the voice production is spectacular. Also, the last recording, Mariä Wiegenlied was made on a wax cylinder around 1907 and was later transferred to vinyl. This recording is 20 years earlier that all the other recordings selected, and you can hear Gerhardt’s voice when she was young.\n\nSacred Lullaby\n\nYou who hover\n\nAround these palms\n\nIn night and wind,\n\nYou holy angels,\n\nSilence the tree-tops!\n\nMy child is sleeping.\n\nYou palms of Bethlehem\n\nIn the raging wind,\n\nWhy do you bluster\n\nSo angrily today!\n\nO roar not so!\n\nBe still, lean\n\nCalmly and gently over us;\n\nSilence the tree-tops!\n\nMy child is sleeping.\n\nThe heavenly babe\n\nSuffers distress,\n\nOh, how weary He has grown\n\nWith the sorrows of this world.\n\nAh, now that in sleep\n\nHis pains\n\nAre gently eased,\n\nSilence the treetops!\n\nMy child is sleeping.\n\nFierce cold\n\nBlows down on us,\n\nWith what shall I cover\n\nMy little child’s limbs?\n\nO all you angels,\n\nWho wing your way\n\nOn the winds,\n\nSilence the tree-tops!\n\nMy child is sleeping.\n\nIn Spring\n\nI sit silently on the hillside.\n\nThe sky is so clear,\n\nthe breezes play in the green valley\n\nwhere once, in the first rays of spring,\n\nI was, oh, so happy.\n\nWhere I walked by her side,\n\nso tender, so close,\n\nand saw deep in the dark rocky stream\n\nthe fair sky, blue and bright,\n\nand her reflected in that sky.\n\nSee how the colorful spring\n\nalready peeps from bud and blossom.\n\nNot all the blossoms are the same to me:\n\nI like most of all to pluck them from the branch\n\nfrom which she has plucked.\n\nFor all is still as it was then,\n\nthe flowers, the fields;\n\nthe sun shines no less brightly,\n\nand no less cheerfully,\n\nthe sky’s blue image bathes in the stream.\n\nOnly will and delusion change,\n\nand joy alternates with strife;\n\nthe happiness of love flies past,\n\nand only love remains;\n\nlove and, alas, sorrow.\n\nOh, if only I were a bird,\n\nthere on the sloping meadow!\n\nThen I would stay on these branches here,\n\nand sing a sweet song about her\n\nall summer long.\n\nSecrecy\n\nLet me go, O world, O let me be!\n\nDo not tempt with gifts of love,\n\nLet this heart keep to itself\n\nIts rapture, its pain!\n\nI do not know why I grieve,\n\nIt is unknown sorrow;\n\nAlways through a veil of tears\n\nI see the sun’s beloved light.\n\nOften, I am lost in thought,\n\nAnd bright joy flashes\n\nThrough the oppressive gloom,\n\nBringing rapture to my breast.\n\nLet me go, O world, O let me be!\n\nDo not tempt with gifts of love,\n\nLet this heart keep to itself\n\nIts rapture, its pain!\n\nHomesickness\n\nHe who would journey abroad\n\nMust go with his beloved,\n\nOthers, in their joy, leave\n\nThe stranger all alone.\n\nWhat do you know, dark summits,\n\nOf these happy days now past?\n\nAh, my homeland beyond the mountains,\n\nHow far it lies from here.\n\nI love best to watch the stars\n\nThat shone as I went to her,\n\nI love to hear the nightingale\n\nThat sang at my loved one’s door.\n\nThe morning is my delight!\n\nAt that peaceful hour I climb\n\nThe highest mountain far and wide,\n\nAnd greet you, Germany,\n\nfrom the depth of my heart!\n\nElena Gerhardt\n\nElena Gerhardt was born on November 11, 1988, and she died on January 11, 1961. Gerhardt was one of the greatest singers of the twentieth century. She was a German dramatic mezzo-soprano and was best known for her interpretations of the masterworks of Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, and Wolf. Her earliest recordings from 1908 display the full beauty of her voice. Later recording sessions displayed more unique aspects of her art. Her most important recordings are those found in the first volume of discs issued by the Hugo Wolf Society. Most likely, without her participation in this project, it would not have gained publication. She championed the music of Wolf from her earliest recitals and she almost single-handedly brought his songs to the general public.\n\nGerhardt began her musical studies at the Leipzig Conservatory at the age of 16, studying with Marie Hedmont. She displayed such promise that the great conductor Artur Nikisch accompanied her in her first public recital which was given on her 20th birthday. In 1903 she made her debut at the Leipzig Opera as Mignon in Thomas’ opera and later sang Charlotte in Massenet’s Werther. However, she quickly abandoned the opera stage and concentrated her performances on recitals and concerts. A “Liederabend” with Gerhardt and Nikisch, who was often her partner in recital, became an important event. In June 1906 she sang her first London recital and became one of the first singers to make a successful career in England without the benefit of important operatic productions. Gerhardt made Leipzig her home while continuing to sing around the world. Her New York debut came on January 9, 1912, as part of her North American tour which again featured Artur Nikisch as her partner. Her other tours included visits to Spain, Russia, Holland, and Belgium. In 1932, she married Fritz Kohl, the director of the Leipzig Radio. When the Nazis came to power, Kohl, along with most radio directors, was arrested. When he was finally released, he and Gerhardt made the decision to make London their permanent residence. From 1934 on, London became the center of her musical activities. Her principal partners at the piano were Artur Nikisch, Coenraad Bos, and Gerald Moore, a formidable group of pianists. All true partners in bringing song to life. She continued to give recitals until 1953, but also became very well-known as a teacher. Her most famous pupil was Flora Nielsen. In 1953 she wrote her autobiography entitled Recital which has a preface written by the great pianist Dame Myra Hess. She also sang with Hess at several of Hess’s National Gallery concerts in London during World War II. She emigrated to London in 1934."
