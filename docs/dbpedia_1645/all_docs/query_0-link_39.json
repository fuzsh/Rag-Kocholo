        "text": "Like so many other forms of serious music, the German Lied—a musical setting of a short poem, often about love or suffering and their various combinations—can now be seen as having a completed history. Originating in the tentative, if touching, efforts of Mozart and Beethoven, the Lied as we know it found its first full artistic expression and its greatest fame in Schubert’s unsurpassed outpouring of pure melody. The works of Schumann and Brahms, though distinguished and beautiful, neither rivaled Schubert’s lyricism nor occupied as central a place in each composer’s oeuvre, and by the time of even such a master as Richard Strauss, the Lied seemed to display restrospection and nostalgia rather than its original freshness.\n\nFor all these composers the beginning was not the word, but the melody. The greatness of their songs was in the music and was often unrelated either for better or worse to the value of the words being set. There was, however, one 19th-century composer of whom this was not the case. For Hugo Wolf, in the beginning was the poem, and the poem dictated its own treatment. The result was a music different for each poet and for each song. The transcendence which was achieved—as it must be in all successful works of art of mixed origins—was not of the poetry but of the music. At their greatest Wolf’s songs are poems enriched and writ large.\n\n_____________\n\nThe gods who are thought to grant happiness scattered as little of it on Hugo Wolf as they did on any other major musical figure of the Romantic era. He was born in 1860 in Windischgraz—a small bastion of German culture then part of Austria but now in Yugoslavia—the son of an impecunious petit-bourgeois family. His leather-merchant father was something of an amateur musician, and he saw to it that his son received music lessons. The boy, though obviously gifted, was hardly a prodigy, and nothing suggested that he possessed preternatural ability. Indeed, the young Wolf was expelled from the Vienna Conservatory on a (presumably unfounded) charge that he had threatened the life of its director. He did contrive a personal contact with Richard Wagner, who was at the time taking Viennese musical life—or at least that part of it not committed to his great rival and antagonist Brahms—by storm. But Wagner put Wolf off with personal kindness and an evident lack of musical interest.\n\nThe elder Wolf was clearly in no position to do more than send his son the barest minimum of financial support; even this insufficiency was accompanied by doleful letters which now, a century later, still seem heartrending. Yet during this period of poverty and ignominy, a peculiar combination of musical talent, nervous intensity, heightened enthusiasm, and self-absorption brought the budding composer a small but devoted circle of friends and patrons. Together they found him a few piano pupils, in whom Wolf took only a desultory interest. More helpful to his income was the interest of the Köchert family, court jewelers in Vienna and important advertisers in a prominent local society weekly.\n\nThat paper, needing a music critic, was induced to try Wolf. For three years he thus joined the ranks of such composer-critics as Berlioz and Debussy. What his criticism lacked in breadth and objectivity—he was by now a confirmed member of the anti-Brahms faction—it made up in Wagnerian fire and brimstone. Not surprisingly, the enemies he made in his writing continued to oppose him and his music for the rest of his life.\n\nAs a composer, his career was starting to assume its lifelong character of small successes and large failures. He had a burning desire to write for a large orchestra, and his main effort along this line was a symphonic poem (1883-85), titled after Heinrich von Kleist’s Penthesilea. Its preliminary reading by the Vienna Philharmonic, which Wolf had reason to hope would end in a performance, instead resulted in public embarrassment and rejection. His incidental music to Ibsen’s The Feast at Solhaug (1890-91), performed under unsatisfactory circumstances, fizzled. And his lifelong search for a viable opera libretto, though it produced Der Corregidor (1895), a setting of Alarcón’s The Three-Cornered Hat, brought him neither the fame nor the profit of which he had dreamed.\n\nThe fate of his songs was, on the whole, happier. Thanks to the efforts of his friends and also two powerful Wagner Clubs, then flourishing in Austria and Germany, the songs began to be performed even during his short lifetime. He wrote them in spurts, long fallow periods being followed by intense creative activity. By the time he died in 1903, he had composed close to three hundred songs, almost all of them to good poetry and some, indeed, to the greatest masterpieces of German literature.\n\n_____________\n\nIn 1888 Wolf set 53 poems of the then little-known Eduard Mörike; these appeared the next year, along with settings of twenty poems by Joseph von Eichendorff. Fifty-one Goethe settings were published in 1890, followed by the 44 songs of the Spanisches Liederbuch, written to poems and folksongs translated from the Spanish by Emanuel Geibel and Paul Heyse. The same year he started the Italienisches Liederbuch, settings of Heyse’s translations of short Italian lyrics. He finished 22 of these by 1891 and another 24 in 1896. His last three works were written in 1897 to poems by Michelangelo. The title of the second of these, Alles endet, was entstehet (“All Things Created Come to Dust”), serves fittingly to express not only the despair which marked so much of Wolf’s life but also the wisdom he was able to extract from his suffering.\n\nThis suffering was at once physical and mental. What could only be hinted at in Ernest Newman’s 1907 biography was made fully clear in Frank Walker’s 1951 extended study: Wolf’s death was due to syphilis marked, in its final form, by six years of insanity and progressive paralysis.\n\nThe circumstances of venereal infection are hardly the ordinary stuff of music criticism. Yet Wolf’s case is of great interest to students of both music and fin-de-siècle culture. Such evidence as we have about how Wolf contracted syphilis comes from the writings of Alma Mahler, the composer’s widow. Alma Mahler is not always reliable, but what she says about the matter in the 1940 edition of her reminiscences has special force because Mahler had been a fellow student of Wolf at the Conservatory, shared an apartment with him, disagreed with him on an abortive opera project, and then became a major character in his psychotic fantasies. According to Alma:\n\nHugo Wolf as a very young man was taken by Adalbert von Goldschmidt into the so-called Lehmgrube (a brothel) where Goldschmidt played dance music, for which he received each time a young woman without charge. He presented his honorarium once to his friend Wolf, and Wolf took away with him “the wound that will never heal.”\n\nWhether or not this lurid anecdote is literally true, it has the ring of symbolic truth. The dark side of the Romantic era was an obsessive concern with disease and death, and in particular with tuberculosis and syphilis, both of which were believed to have some connection with creativity. Among musicians Chopin, with his pallor and evident physical weakness, was the very model of the consumptive artist. Schubert and Schumann—and even Beethoven—were widely thought to belong to the ranks of the syphilitic.\n\nThe idea that sensual indulgence brings both the punishment of insanity and demonic insight survived into the 20th century with Brunold Springer’s Die genialen Syphilitiker (“The Inspired Syphilitics,” among whom he of course includes Nietzsche, but also Wood-row Wilson and Mussolini). Indeed, Thomas Mann’s great novel Doctor Faustus is about just such a diseased composer; significantly, Mann uses material from the life and letters of Wolf to flesh out the figure of his own fictional Leverkühn.\n\n_____________\n\nThe relationship between an artist’s life and his work is never easy to understand. In Wolf’s particular case the facts of his biography have had a strong influence on how his art has been perceived and performed. The morbid psychological pathology and physical disease from which he suffered have served both as a key to the understanding of his art and, perhaps, as a bar to a surer appreciation of his achievement.\n\nTo see why, we must first examine the breadth and depth of Wolf’s musical output. At an initial glance, these hundreds of short vocal compositions, all save one performed with piano rather than orchestral accompaniment, express a wide range of human emotions and make significantly varied demands on both performers and listeners. There are, in Wolf, simple songs and charming ones, light pieces and witty conceits. Some songs take an Olympian view of the universe and some indulge in a kind of publicly proclaimed emotion verging on what can only be called bathos.\n\nAs pure music—melody, harmony, and rhythm considered without any reference to the text—Wolf’s songs seem highly competent without at the same time possessing immortal distinction. The overall musical impression is of melodic shortwindedness, of tunes which begin promisingly and lack either continuation or conclusion, of brief motives reiterated countless times. Thus unlike the great songs of Schubert—among them the Erlkönig, Gretchen am Spinnrade, and Ungeduld— which have been widely played in beloved piano transcriptions, the songs of Wolf are unknown in any other than their original, vocal, form.\n\nBut to treat Wolf’s songs as pure music is to miss the core of his achievement. That achievement—based technically on the careful and felicitous matching of word to note—was the projection of text and music as a unity, a unity in which the text, not the music, was primus inter pares. Had his music been, by itself, more memorable, that unity would have suffered; had his melodies, carried by a consistent and distinctive style, been able to survive in our collective musical consciousness, his name would have been vastly more famous, and his achievement less remarkable. For it is the very plainness of his music that enables the words to be heard not only as the vowels and consonants necessary to clothe the vocal line, but also as the bearers of detailed and connected meaning.\n\nAccording to current received opinion, whatever emotion Wolf expressed he caught deep and whole. Such an attribution of universality seems unfounded. A coy note of preciosity is often present in the smaller songs; Wolf’s treatment of love and passion seems all too stylized, all too dependent upon the artificial elements of jealousy and scorn associated in the popular mind with Mediterranean forms of courtship. Where Wolf’s greatness cannot be questioned, however, is in his many settings of poems which deal with human suffering, the urge for deliverance, and man’s drive to be as a god himself.\n\nAt the head of these stand the Harfenspieler-Lieder, settings of the verse in Goethe’s Wilhelm Meister given to the pathetic old harp player. The three songs—Wer sich der Einsamkeit ergibt (“He Who Gives Himself to Solitude”), An die Thüren will ich schleichen (“To the Doors Will I Creep”), and Wer nie sein Brot mit Tränen ass (“He Who Has Never Eaten His Bread with Tears”) are adequately summed up in Carlyle’s free rendering of the final poem:\n\nWho never ate his bread in sor-\n\nrow,\n\nWho never spent the darksome\n\nhours\n\nWeeping and watching for the\n\nmorrow,\n\nHe knows ye not, ye gloomy\n\npowers.\n\nTo earth, this weary earth, ye\n\nbring us,\n\nTo guilt ye let us heedless go,\n\nThen leave repentance fierce to\n\nwring us;\n\nA moment’s guilt, an age of\n\nwoe!\n\nWolf’s music to these gloomy words serves as frame and background, support and wrapping. Though the content is the poet’s, the total effect is heightened and made permanent as much by the music’s restraint as by its presence.\n\nWolf’s directly religious songs are concerned with the figure of Christ as evoked by the two powerful images of birth and crucifixion. The songs describing the infant Jesus are immensely appealing, whether the words being set are from the Spanish Songbook or from Mörike. Here the simplicity of the music evokes something of the simplicity of childhood, and the attitude of the composer is one of rapt wonder.\n\nGripping indeed is his larger-scaled treatment of verse describing Christ as the comforter. In Herr, was trägt der Boden hier (“Lord What Will the Soil Bring Forth”), one of Wolf’s most starkly powerful songs, the poem from the Spanish asks whether the fate of the sinner is thorns; it ends with Christ taking the thorns and giving the sinner flowers in their place. Here the music is stark and sometimes brutal; the same simplicity which for Wolf enhances a childlike religiosity now emphasizes human nakedness before God.\n\n_____________\n\nPerhaps the two greatest songs Wolf ever wrote—settings of Goethe’s masterpieces Ganymed and Prometheus— are both about man’s arrogance in thinking himself divine, and the punishment for such hubris. In Ganymed, Goethe describes the unashamed love of a beautiful youth for Zeus, and Wolf’s repetitious, almost monotonous, chromaticism achieves an ineffable ecstasy by its very incessance.\n\nGanymed is, of course, about a quasi-human love. By contrast, Prometheus deals with a Titan’s defiance of Zeus himself. Goethe’s poem describes in symbolic terms man’s grudge against heaven and ends with a pledge of eternal defiance regardless of the penalty. To clothe these words Wolf has written a dramatic scene resembling in all ways but one Wagner’s very similar treatment in the Ring of Wotan. In Wolf’s song—brilliantly orchestrated by the composer and thus capable of even greater impact than in the original piano version—all Wagner’s gestures of fist-shaking and thunderclaps are present; only lacking is the independent power of the music which incorporated Wagner’s metaphysical flights, profound and windy alike. As he consistently does, Wolf finds motives which he states in the piano (or the orchestra), and arrays these short groups of notes against the declamatory line in the voice. The total result is again the triumph of the poetry, a triumph which the music supports and perhaps even makes possible, but hardly shares. Here as elsewhere in Wolf there is a kind of denial, at once extended both to the audience and to himself. It is as if the composer, in his greatest songs, were reminding his listeners that they had not come to him for pleasure.\n\n_____________\n\nThe singing of Wolf has always been a great specialty, a gift possessed by few. In Schubert, the demands are simple, albeit difficult to satisfy: a beautiful voice, musical phrasing, and a talent on the part of the singer for ingratiating himself with the audience. In Wolf, on the other hand, the problems to be solved and the talents needed belong to the domain of the speaker—and possibly even to that of the sage.\n\nWhile a few of Wolf’s songs have always found their way into Lieder recitals, they have mainly been heard through phonograph recordings made by those dedicated to this recherché art. Indeed, Wolf’s reputation today is largely due to the pioneering efforts, extending throughout the 1930’s, of the late Walter Legge, the English record producer who was responsible for getting His Master’s Voice to record large chunks of the then unrecorded musical repertory. Legge also developed the concept of selling records through subscriptions pledged in advance, rather than through the more normal method of over-the-counter purchase. The most successful of these ventures were the Schnabel performances of the complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas and the Glyndebourne recordings of Mozart operas.\n\nAlready by 1931 Legge had put forward the idea of a Hugo Wolf Society, to record (on 78 RPM discs) large numbers of the songs, most of them still unknown and certainly unrecorded. He received powerful public help from Ernest Newman, not only a Wolf biographer but also one of the most prestigious English music critics of the day. (To make his scheme commercially viable, Legge needed only 500 subscribers; though they were slow coming in, he was able to go ahead with a scant 470.)\n\nThe singers Legge garnered for his records were among the leading—and also the most intelligent—Lieder interpreters of the period. Almost all of them were either German or German-speaking. They included the historic figure Elena Gerhardt, who had recorded some Lieder as early as the first decade of the century with the great conductor Artur Nikisch at the piano. Gerhardt did the first album of the six which ultimately appeared. She was followed by such important singers as Herbert Janssen (a Wagnerian baritone with a distinguished career at Bayreuth and later, after Hitler, at the Metropolitan), and the tenor Karl Erb. Another historic figure included in the project by Legge was Elisabeth Rethberg, the creator of the title role in Strauss’s Die ägyptische Helena (1928). Still another was the Russian-Jewish bass Alexander Kipnis, a unique artist with a rock-solid voice and a radiant musical intelligence. Legge also arranged the participation for one song only—Prometheus—of the great Wagnerian bass Friedrich Schorr (famous for his portrayals of Hans Sachs and Wotan). An equally important catch for two songs—including Ganymed—was the celebrated Irish tenor John McCormack.\n\nWhile the other artists participating in the Wolf Society records may not be on quite this distinguished level, the whole set has stood up amazingly well, and fully deserves the honor of its recent LP transfer and reissue in England.1 In this reissue, the original six 78 RPM albums, each now with an LP record to itself, have been joined by a seventh LP composed mostly of performances unissued upon the outbreak of war in 1939.\n\nThe importance of Walter Legge in establishing the songs of Hugo Wolf hardly ends here. He continued his work for EMI, the parent company of HMV, after the war, now producing records also for Columbia (England), another branch of the conglomerate. Here, in addition to sponsoring the international career of the conductor Herbert von Karajan, he oversaw the work on records of the then young soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, whom he later married. In his capacity first as record producer and finally as husband, he not only supervised her career but also formed her vocal and musical personality.\n\nJust how he went about being a musical Svengali (the term is Schwarzkopf’s own) is clear from an article he wrote about his wife:\n\nFirst I set out to widen by recorded examples her imaginative concept of the possibilities of vocal sound. Rosa Ponselle’s vintage port and thick cream timbre and noble line; the Slavic brilliance of Nina Koshetz; a few phrases from Farrar’s Carmen . . . one word only from Melba . . . some Rethberg and large doses of Meta Seinemeyer to show how essentially Teutonic voices can produce brilliant Italianate sound. Then Lehmann’s all-embracing generosity, Schumann’s charm and lightness, McCormack’s incredible octave leap in “Care Selve,” Frida Leider’s dramatic tension. . . . From the analysis of what we found most admirable in these diverse models we made our own synthesis. . . .2\n\nThe result of all this picking and choosing in the cafeteria of vocal success was Schwarzkopf’s career, fabled not only in opera and recorded operetta, but also in Lieder.\n\nOf the work of Hugo Wolf in particular she has made numerous recordings, including a two-record set of the Goethe songs with pianist Gerald Moore, and one record, from the 1953 Salzburg Festival, with Wilhelm Furtwängler as keyboard partner. A famous vocal colleague on her Wolf records has been the German baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau; with him she has recorded the complete Italian and Spanish Songbooks, dividing the individual songs according to their appropriateness for a specific vocal gender. Together, they have Legge’s imprimatur: they are, for him, “Wolf’s greatest living interpreters.”\n\nFischer-Dieskau is himself the most recorded singer of Wolf—and for that matter of almost everything else—to emerge since 1945. His discs are numberless, and it appears to be his conscious ambition to record every serious work, whether classical, Romantic, or contemporary, which can be sung by the male voice. Of Wolf alone he has recorded (in addition to those with Schwarzkopf) three sets of three records each with Daniel Barenboim at the piano for Deutsche Grammophon; on HMV there is a seven-LP set with Gerald Moore.\n\nIf Schwarzkopf and Fischer-Dieskau may be taken as the new wave of Wolf singing, and the Wolf Society recordings as the older tradition, what can be said about the character of each approach? And just as important, what can the answer to this question tell us about the course of vocal and musical performance in this refined part of the repertory during the last half-century?\n\n_____________\n\nIn listening to all these records, it immediately becomes evident that the older and newer styles, despite their both being linked by the figure of Walter Legge, are quite different.\n\nThe best of the older performances give an impression of simplicity combined with grandeur, of sensitivity to each poem’s mood combined with a clear, unforced, and restrained projection of the individual words. Among countless examples must be mentioned Gerhardt’s searing cry on the first word of Herr, was trägi der Boden hier, a cry all the more terrifying for the self-control guarding its expression. Similarly, Schorr’s performance of Prometheus manages always to be sung rather than barked—even during the moments of the poem’s greatest stress. John McCormack’s Ganymed is neither effeminate nor sentimental, neither cloying nor piteous; even the final astounding falsetto slide upward on the word “father” never loses either the integrity of the character or the detachment with which Goethe could view the extremities of feeling. In Herbert Janssen’s singing of the overtly Christological Schlafendes Jesuskind and Auf ein Altes Bild, the straightforward character of both poetry and music is never sacrificed for momentary effects of dramatic virtuosity. And the same holds true in the Harfenspieler-Lieder, where Janssen expresses utter desolation without any show of special pleading.\n\nTo go from this to Schwarzkopf and Fischer-Dieskau is to leave an atmosphere of what now seem like classical limits and to enter a world of blossoming details, of an infinite series of dramatic takes dwarfing their wider contexts, of feeling chosen over understanding, of turns of phrase emphasized at the expense of the orderly progression of the poetic idea. Here, it seems fair to say, is a vulgar rather than a refined art.\n\nIn the case of Schwarzkopf, it is difficult not to feel that, in this repertory, she is simply overmatched as an artist. However magnetic her stage personality may have been in opera and on the concert platform, the evidence of these recordings is that she has little to bring to the performance of the most profound works of Wolf other than a coyness more at home in Der Rosenkavalier and a crooning more suitable for the singing of lullabies. And even there, in Wiegenlied in Sommer (“Summer Lullaby”), one of Wolf’s best non-weighty songs, her preciosity destroys the necessary feeling of tenderness so marvelously conveyed by Tiana Lemnitz in the Society recording.\n\nElsewhere, where the great emotional chips are down, Schwarzkopf proves entirely inadequate. In her performance of Anakreons Grab (“Anacreon’s Grave”), a setting of Goethe’s poem about the final, protected resting place of the Greek poet, vocal imitations of turtledoves cooing and grasshoppers jumping only detract from the idea of a divine reward for one fortunate artist. In Schlafendes Jesus-kind, what is for Janssen a picture of wonderment becomes for Schwarzkopf merely another lullaby. Her Herr, was trägt der Boden hier communicates, instead of Gerhardt’s nobility under suffering, nervousness and self-pity. Ganymed, under Schwarzkopf’s ministrations, fares as badly; the beautiful, doomed youth of Goethe’s poem emerges rather as a sophisticated lady quite conscious of her own attractiveness.\n\nWith Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, we face an artist at once more penetrating and more troubling. By no means as vocally gifted as Schwarzkopf—or as most of the singers on the Wolf Society discs—he has made a career out of substituting guileful thought for physical strength. It is an important part of his achievement that when he sings, no word goes unillustrated by a twist of vocal color, dynamics, or phrasing; it is as if he had developed some special gift for musical onomatopoeia, enabling him to act out the words rather than merely deliver them.\n\nThe effect of all this artfulness is an overwrought absorption in the material. Everything seems to verge on the hysterical, an impression unavoidably heightened by Fischer-Dieskau’s lack of vocal amplitude which frequently—and in Prometheus unpleasantly—reduces him to a mere shout. In quieter moments, he too, like Schwarzkopf, croons; indeed, both singers often seem all too aware of the potential of the microphone as an aid to vocal color and contrast.\n\nFischer-Dieskau’s recordings of the Harfenspieler-Lieder are, it must be said, attractive on first hearing. Together with pianist Barenboim, he projects a concern with each note and each word; here, one feels, are performers who really care. Compared to Fischer-Dieskau and Barenboim, Janssen and his pianist, Coenraad Bos, seem at first—but only at first—a bit cautious and unbending. Then, as the second song follows the first, and the third the second, the plenitude of Fischer-Dieskau’s emotion becomes a surfeit, and Janssen’s restraint can be experienced as a form of wisdom.\n\nIn other songs, too, the contrast is unfavorable to the younger singer. In Anakreons Grab, Fischer-Dieskau seems uncertain as to whether he is expressing Goethe’s view of life or singing about the dissolute minor poet of the title; Ganymed is tortured and mannered, verging occasionally on rhythmic unsteadiness; Auch kleine Dinge (“Even Little Things”), another of Wolf’s most successful lighter songs, is done in the stylized manner of the best cabaret singers with no trace of the gentility which marks the performance of Gerhardt.\n\n_____________\n\nSuch a negative judgment of perhaps the two most highly regarded German singers of the post-World War II era cannot fail to provoke objections in general and a particular question concerning their performance of Wolf. How can anything vital be lacking in artists who have sung Wolf’s songs in concert or on records so successfully to an audience vastly larger than any who heard this music in the preceding fifty years?\n\nThe answer, I believe, is that a basic constituent in the success of these artists in this repertory is precisely the flaws in their approach to it—the charming shallowness of Schwarzkopf and the overwrought, fussy delivery of Fischer-Dieskau.\n\nDescribing Hugo Wolf’s audience, Walter Legge himself has written:\n\nNowhere today is there a society like that Wolf moved in. His Vienna circle was a mixture of up-and-coming conductors, writers, doctors, university professors, government officials, and fairly rich business people all interested in the arts—particularly music—and nearly all of them capable amateur performers.\n\nIt goes without saying that this audience was German-speaking, not only able to understand the words being sung and the musical idiom in which the songs were written, but also alive to the literary nuances and context of the poetry Wolf was setting.\n\nIn important ways this enclosed cultural milieu lasted well into our century. But the past 35 years have seen the rise of a new kind of audience for high culture—wider, thinner, less knowledgeable, less discriminating. To please such an audience performers must become more approachable and more immediately comprehensible. Legge himself admits as much in speaking of Schwarzkopf (though he draws a different conclusion):\n\nAt performances I sat whenever possible in a stage box to watch both what she was doing and how the audience reacted—the exact moment when women fumbled in their handbags for handkerchiefs and men tugged them from their breast pockets. This is not calculation; it is in my view obedience to composers’ intentions, to involve the audience in the action.\n\nWith Schwarzkopf, this emphasis on manipulating the audience’s emotions results in the charm and coquetry that mar her performances of Wolf. With Fischer-Dieskau, a more intelligent performer in command of great histrionic gifts, playing to the audience has involved fastening on the one part of Wolf’s art that is most readily accessible to the contemporary listener—the pathology which so marked the composer as a man. But the hysteria and instability that Fischer-Dieskau thus communicates is not all, or even the best part, of what Hugo Wolf’s art is about. At their greatest, Wolf’s songs are about the victory of Wolf as an artist over his madness as a man, not about his capture by it. Wolf is so important because in some obscure way—made even more enigmatic by the sparse nature of his music—he sublimated his madness in his songs, just as he sublimated his despair, his suffering, and his hope. This miracle produced, in the end, a detached wisdom, gloriously exemplified in the Michelangelo Lieder.\n\nKipnis on the Society records could communicate this spirit because he had confidence in the ability of his audience to understand and appreciate it. Fischer-Dieskau lacks such an audience and such confidence, and therefore his art is lacking as well.\n\n1 His Master's Voice (England) RLS 759."
