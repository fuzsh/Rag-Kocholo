        "text": "The soprano and vocal coach Winifred Cecil of Manhattan died Friday at Roosevelt Hospital of cardiopulmonary complications. She was 78 years old.\n\nWinifred Cecil was born on Staten Island, and studied singing as a child with Marcella Sembrich and the lieder singer Elena Gerhardt. In the early 1930's, she sang on the ''Showboat Hour,'' opposite Lanny Ross, and on other radio programs before her New York recital debut in 1933 at Town Hall; the New York Times reviewer praised her for a ''delivery so flexible and precisely true as to pitch that the voice never slurred from note to note.''\n\nThe singer made several concert tours, appearing with symphony orchestras, and then went to Italy in 1937 to sing opera. She appeared at La Scala in Milan, the San Carlo Opera in Naples, and other European houses, appearing notably in Italian and German operas.\n\nThe outbreak of World War II prevented Miss Cecil from returning to the United States for her scheduled Metropolitan Opera debut. She stayed in Italy, and married Baron Paolo Mazzonis di Pralafera. At the end of the war, she acted as a liaison between American troops, supporting services and the Italians, for which she was made an Honorary Dame of the Order of Malta.\n\nMiss Cecil returned to the United States after the death of her husband in 1949, and resumed a career as recitalist and soloist. She began teaching at the Juilliard School and the University of Buffalo, and started Joy in Singing, a series of public master classes that provided debut recitals for outstanding young singers. She also continued to coach singers privately, among them the pop singer Roberta Flack.\n\nMiss Cecil, who married Henry Blanchard in 1954, is survived by a nephew, Devin Garrity of New York, and by her stepchildren, Eric Blanchard of Philadelphia and Karen Blanchard Kramer of Litchfield Park, Ariz."
