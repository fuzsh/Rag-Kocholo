        "text": "1 - River created an environmental preservation ONG few months before he died.\n\n''More than 18 years after his death in Hollywood at age 23, actor River Phoenix's family has turned a nonprofit organization he started nine months before he died into a Gainesville center to promote peace in his name.\n\nWhile family members had valued their privacy about River, his mother, Heart Phoenix, said they wanted to \"create the continuing story of who River really was, not how he died.\"\n\n2 - River inspired the character of a book, ''Pink'', written by Gus Van Sant and dedicated to him.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Van Sant wrote a novel, ''Pink'', about a director obsessed with the gorgeous boy star of his infomercials who has recently died - not-so-loosely based on Phoenix, who died after overdosing on drugs. It's dedicated to Phoenix and reads like a love letter to him.\n\nVan Sant was distraught after his death: \"It was really like the wrong person to have died ... because, of all the people that you know, there are some people who are very charmed. He was like the favourite person of a lot of people, and when he died it was, like, ''Why couldn't I die? Why couldn't that other person have died? Why would it have to be him?''\n\nUntil a couple of years ago, Van Sant lived next door to the Phoenix family in New York. Was he in love with River? \"No. We were just really good friends and collaborators.\" He sits so still, his arms wrapped protectively around himself. He says that they were always looking forward to doing their next movie together and never got the chance.\n\n3 - River was the one who gave the idea of Joaquin returns with his real name.\n\n''River was really who insisted that I changed back. He just thought it was a great name and then I said ''OK'', said Joaquin.\n\n4 - River served anonymously as the band's roadie of Beastie Boys.\n\n''River appeared for a few days in Florida. He was doing the roadie work for them. I remember him wearing checkered pants short-legged'', said Ricky Powell, the photographer who accompanied the band.\n\n5 - River was good peace, but knew how to fight if necessary.\n\n''We always had each other'', said Joaquin, as when a neighborhood kid stole his bike and River undertook to punch the guy in an alley and get it back.\n\n6 - River was nominated for his role in all years, from 1981 to 1992, except for 1990.\n\n1981-1982 - ''Best Young Actor in a new television series'' in the Fourth Annual Youth in Film Awards'' for Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.\n\n1982-83 - ''Best Young Actor in a Drama Series'' for Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.\n\n1983-84 - ''Best Young Actor in a Family Film Made for Television'' for Backwards: The Riddle of Dyslexia.\n\n1984-85 - ''Best Young Actor Starring in a Television Special or Mini-Series'' for Surviving.\n\n1985 - ''Young Artist Award for Exceptional Performance by a Young Actor'' for Explorers.\n\n1985-86 - ''Jackie Coogan Award'' shared with Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell.\n\n1986 - ''Best Supporting Actor - Drama'' for Stand By Me and The Mosquito Coast.\n\n1986 - ''Best action youth under 18'' for The Mosquito Coast.\n\n1986-87 - ''Best Young Male Superstar in Motion Pictures'' for The Mosquito Coast.\n\n1988 - ''Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor'', ''National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor'', ''Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture'' and ''Best Actor'' in the 8th Annual Fennecus Awards and in the 8th Annual Apex Award, for Running On Empty.\n\n1989 - ''Best Actor in a limited Role'' for Indiana Jones.\n\n1991-92 - Five times nominated for ''Best actor'' for My Own Private Idaho.\n\n7 - The protagonist of the game ''Final Fantasy VIII'' was inspired by him.\n\nSquall was inspired by Phoenix. The reason? As Tetsuya Nomura noted \"nobody understood it\".\n\n8 - River was diagnosed with amblyopia.\n\nAlso known as lazy eye, is an eye disorder characterized by an impaired vision in an eye that otherwise appears normal, or out of proportion to associated structural abnormalities of the eye.\n\n''His eyes became the focus of energy in each scene, a centrifugal force so strong that I did not even try to duel him for control'', said Dermot Mulroney, who co-starred with River in Silent Tongue and The Thing Called Love.\n\n9 - Adam Horovitz, from the Beastie Boys band, hit the cameraman who tried to film the memorial of River.\n\nThe delegate Theodore Loewen asked Judge Jeffrey L. Wiatt's conviction Horovitz to 30 days in jail. He said Horovitz and an unidentified man confronted Goebert and beat him when he refused to hand them the videotape he had made of people who came to the funeral of Phoenix.\n\n10 - The nephew of River, Indigo, son of Liberty, died at two years old.\n\nLiberty had a healthy pregnancy of him, at 24 and he was her 2nd child. Very early contracted several infections and allergies due to the release of toxic gases present in your carpet, which made her very short life suffered. At two years, Indigo contracted ''hemofilus influenza'' and died.\n\nShe created the INDIGOGreen, a shop of ecological construction material.\n\n''At the time, I had a 5 year old son and a daughter with only 5 months. I had to be strong and move on but then I took a break from it all to be with my kids and that's when I decided that no other person in the world should go through what I went through ... and decided that if I could do something to prevent this, it would be the greatest legacy of my child on this planet, and somehow, he would live.''"
