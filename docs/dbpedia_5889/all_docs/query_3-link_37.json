        "text": "The Halloween night of 1993 will always be in the memory of Hollywood and especially of the actor Joaquin Phoenix. On October 31 of that year, after a party in a well-known local, River Phoenix died of an overdose before the eyes of all those present, among whom was the star of films such as 'Gladiator' or 'Napoleon'.\n\nOutlet 'Cuarto Milenio' reviewed the shocking emergency call made by Joaquin to the emergency services.\n\nOn the program, with the help of Carmen Porter in the 'Stars of Mystery' section, they commented on the unusual childhood of Joaquin Phoenix, who was born in Puerto Rico and joined the 'Children of God' sect with his family at a very young age.\n\nAfter several years and an accusation of pederasty for the leader, the family moved to Los Angeles and the mother changed her children's last name to Los Angeles.\n\nFame tormented River Phoenix\n\nOnce they settled in the city, the mother began casting both River and Joaquin, with the elder being the first to achieve fame.\n\nHowever, that derived in a dark side, and it is that River began to consume drugs habitually. Until the night of October 31, 1993, in a local West Hollywood, the actor then only 23 years old collapsed and began to convulse, while those present did not know what to do and Joaquin made a call that to this day is still shocking.\n\n\"You have to come now, please,\" an upset Joaquin, then 19 years old, repeats several times. The emergency services try to calm the actor, who explains what happened: \"Okay, I think he took Valium or something else. I don't know, you have to get here, please\".\n\nAfter that, Phoenix sees the worst coming, with his brother already dying in the street. \"Please, he's dying.... Please!\" he cries out in desperation.\n\nHowever, nothing could be done for the young man, who had already died of an overdose by the time the paramedics arrived."
