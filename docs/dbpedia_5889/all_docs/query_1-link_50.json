        "text": "Phoenix acted in some of the most iconic films in the 1980s and got a cult following for his views on fame, shunning the spotlight, being vegetarian and connecting with an audience. Although it was common knowledge that he took drugs, the overdose was still a shock as Phoenix was just 23 at the time.\n\nMeet the man whose legacy forever lives on …\n\nAn unusual childhood\n\nAccording to The Guardian, his parents John and Arlyn, were travelling hippies who joined a cult, the Children of God, when River was three years old. According to the publication, the family travelled extensively and some of their beliefs included sex without boundaries as being a form of love. Apparently as a child, River was sent to busk for money as the family needed cash for food.\n\nAt the time, their surname was Bottom. Digital Spy reported that Arlyn and John changed the family’s name to Phoenix as a moniker to symbolised their rebirth. According to The Guardian, River said he was sexually abused when he was four years old and his father John had a problem with alcohol. As a result, River felt obliged to look after the family.\n\nA rising star\n\nPhoenix and his siblings all began acting as children, reveals entertainment website Gold Derby. His first TV job was on the set of Seven Brides for Seven Brothers in 1982, reports the publication.\n\nIn 1985, his breakout role in TV film, Surviving, put him on the acting map. In 1988, he received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor for the film Running On Empty. He was soon called the James Dean of the 80s and with his blonde hair, blue eyes, bad boy habits and vegetarianism, he quickly had a loyal fan following.\n\nThe following he never wanted\n\nAlthough he was a cultural icon when he was alive – his death further cementing his place in Hollywood – he shunned the spotlight. The Guardian reports that after his impressive performance in Stand By Me, he simply wanted to be anonymous. He also starred in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade in 1989.\n\nFame was not an ideal that he had sought out. His mother told Esquire that she believed her son was going to be the cult’s missionary in order to change the world through the mass media appeal.\n\nHis shocking death\n\nMathis says he was dead 45 minutes after they got to the club. She said he started convulsing and by the time he was taken to the hospital, he was pronounced dead. The official cause of death was an overdose.\n\nCeleb friendships\n\nIn an interview with Esquire, Keanu Reeves, 58, said he hated talking about Phoenix in the past and he felt “you gotta keep it present”. The actors starred together in My Own Private Idaho in 1991. Reeves said his friend was “fiercely creative, thoughtful and brave”.\n\nIn another interview with People, Michael J. Fox, 61, described how when on set for 1991’s Doc Hollywood, which was being shot in a small town, Phoenix would invite him over to his house for some family time as he lived in the area."
