        "text": "A few days ago Anderson Cooper did an insightful interview with Joaquin Phoenix and his family. Anderson said with a humbleness that they didn't know whether Phoenix would go through with it considering in the past he has rejected many if not all interviews. His nature of closing off the media into his life can be seen as an anomaly. Most actors and actresses thrive on fame. They bask in the attention and crave social approval from millions. Joaquin, on the other hand, finds this whole celebrity thing to be some sort of a joke. After a few obligatory superficial questions from Cooper, Joaquin would charmingly end with “ Who gives a f**k”. To see such a vibrant lack of desire when it relates to the myth that is Hollywood seep out of Phoenix with every response just made people love him more.\n\nRelated:\n\nHow Did Andy Cohen and Anderson Cooper Do as CNN New Year's Eve Hosts?\n\nAnderson Cooper's Face After His First Jäger Shot Is The Greatest New Year's Eve Moment EVER!\n\nSupport For Anderson Cooper Floods In After His On-Air Eulogy Of His Mother, Gloria Vanderbilt\n\nAnderson Cooper & Andy Cohen Can't Hide Laughter During NYE 'C**k' Drop\n\nAnderson Cooper Splits From Longtime Partner\n\nThe Anti Celebrity\n\nIt was a wonder that Anderson got the whole family to sit down with him and discuss the death of their legendary broth River Phoenix. Before Joaquin became a household name himself everyone knew of the genius that was River. He was a teen idol that transformed into a respected actor. His talent was unmatched and his care for things that were seen as taboo like promoting a Vegan lifestyle and being environmentally conscious are now all mainstream. Anderson asked the family how they take on the grieving process since he himself had a brother who committed suicide right in front of his mother.\n\nPrivate and Introverted\n\nIt was a wonder that Anderson got the whole family to sit down with him and discuss the death of their legendary broth River Phoenix.

He also said River told him that he would be a better actor than he was, and helped him to fall in love with acting after showing him the masterpiece “Raging Bull”. He said after watching it that he saw acting through Rivers eyes. When Anderson brought that tough question to their mother, she said it comes in waves. One day she could be driving and it just hits her. Thankfully they all try to keep Rivers legacy alive, and it looks like they are doing a fantastic job at it."
