        "text": "Joaquin Phoenix hopes his son River will grow up vegan – but says he won’t “force” the lifestyle upon him.\n\nThe acclaimed actor and passionate vegan advocate made the comments in a recent interview with Sunday Times.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix’s son River\n\n“Well, certainly I would hope that [he will be vegan]. But, I’m not going to impose my belief on my child,” Phoenix told the publication.\n\n“I don’t think that’s right; I’m going to educate him about the reality.\n\n“I’m not going to indoctrinate him with the idea that McDonald’s has a Happy Meal because there’s nothing f***ing happy about that meal.”\n\nThe Joker star added that while he will not “force” his son – named after his late brother River – he will not “perpetuate the lie.”\n\n“I’m not going to tell him it’s ok to read books about all the wonderful little farm animals… And then not tell him that’s what a hamburger is,” he concluded.\n\nVegan charity work\n\nPhoenix regularly uses his platform to speak out against animal agriculture and promote veganism.\n\nEarlier this year, he joined Billie Eilish and her family – alongside partner Rooney Mara – to donate plant-based meals to LGBTQ+ youth organization My Friend’s Place.\n\nThe celeb celebrated the first anniversary, Support + Feed: an initiative spearheaded by Eilish’s mom Maggie Baird last year to help those “greatly impacted” by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to support vegan restaurants in the Los Angeles area.\n\nMara and Phoenix said: “At a time when most people were worried about their own health and security, Maggie dreamed up and implemented a plan to get nourishing food to people who needed it most.\n\n“We were honored to celebrate Support + Feed’s first anniversary at such an important institution like My Friend’s Place.”"
