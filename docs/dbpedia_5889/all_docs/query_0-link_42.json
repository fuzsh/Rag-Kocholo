        "text": "When Joaquin Phoenix welcomed his first child with fianc√©e Rooney Mara, it offered him the perfect chance to pay a lasting tribute to his late brother River.\n\nThe actor tragically lost his older brother when he died of a drug overdose in October of 1993, at the age of 23, but has reportedly named his newborn son River in his honour.\n\nRiver was one of the most celebrated young actors of the time, starring in iconic movies such as Stand By Me, as well as earning an Oscar nomination in 1988 for Best Supporting Actor while still in his teens, but with his rising star extinguished too soon, many who don't remember him might be asking just who was River Phoenix and why was he so special?\n\nRiver was a dedicated vegan from age 7, and was the eldest of the talented Phoenix siblings. Rain, Liberty and Summer also followed their brothers into music and acting.\n\nHowever, the original family name 'Bottom' definitely didn't have the same Hollywood ring as Phoenix does.\n\nRiver described his parents, Arlyn and John Lee, in an interview with People magazine as 'hippie-ish' and his family were part of the religious cult, The Children Of God. This meant that the children, particularly River, didn't receive any formal schooling, which made his instinctive talent for playing the guitar and acting all the more special.\n\nIn the late 70s, his parents became disillusioned with the cult and moved to Florida, where they changed their family name to Phoenix, after the mythical bird that rises from the ashes.\n\nUsing his talents, River would play on street corners, with his siblings singing, to collect money to support their family. This was where they were spotted by a talent agent who signed them all.\n\nHis family maintained that music was always his true passion and he dreamed of becoming a recording artist. One of the first things he bought with the earnings from his film career was a $650 guitar which was his prized possession.\n\nPhoenix began doing commercials aged 10, and after a couple of small parts in TV shows and TV movies, he finally landed a part in a TV movie called Surviving: A Family in Crisis where he was to star alongside Molly Ringwald, another 80s movie icon.\n\nNext came a role as a geeky boy scientist alongside Ethan Hawke in big budget sci-fi movie Explorers. But it was his role in coming-of age movie Stand By Me at 15 which propelled him to become a household name.\n\nNext came a role in Peter Weir's The Mosquito Coast in which he played the child of A-listers Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren, and the director earmarked him for stardom. Around this time, he started a band called Aleka's Attic which included his sister Rain.\n\nIn 1988, he did Little Nikita next to Academy Award-winner Sidney Poitier, and then came Running on Empty for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He then starred as a young Indiana Jones in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\n\nKnown for embodying the characters he played, the indie flick Dogfight was where his troubles with addiction really began to surface. River played a young US marine the night before he is shipped off to Vietnam. His co-star Lili Taylor remarked afterwards that the role caused Phoenix some discomfort and that while he wasn't doing drugs, he was drinking at the time.\n\nShe remarked: 'That was actually a hard part for him, because it was so radically different from who he was. He was such a hippie, and here he was playing this marine. It actually caused him a lot of discomfort.'\n\nRiver met Keanu Reeves while Reeves was filming Parenthood, and actually auditioned for the role of Bill in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. However, the two did star together, alongside Kevin Kline, in 90s black comedy I Love You To Death. They again starred opposite each other in indie pic My Own Private Idaho, which was loosely based on Shakespeare's Henry IV. The movie also featured a song, Too Many Colours by Aleka's Attic.\n\nIn 1992, Aleka's Attic disbanded and River teamed up with Sidney Poitier again and Robert Redford for spy thriller Sneakers. He was fast becoming the secured go-to actor when you needed a young, edgy leading man.\n\nThis year he also won PETA's Humanitarian Award for his fund-raising efforts as a dedicated animal rights and environmental activist. In 1994, he was beaten to the role of Paul in a River Runs Through It by Brad Pitt.\n\nHis last movie before his death was country music-themed film, The Thing Called Love. Following a performance with his friends, the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, he died of an overdose outside The Viper Room, a Hollywood nightclub.\n\nThe star went down in front of his brother Joaquin, his then girlfriend Samantha Mathis, and his sister Rain who tried to give him CPR, and though brought to hospital alive, never regained consciousness and was declared dead at 1.51 am on October 31.\n\nEvery year on October 31, fans pay tribute to River by posting his famous quote: 'Acting is like a Halloween mask that you put on.'\n\nOther actors who have credited Phoenix as a major influence include Leonardo DiCaprio, Jared Leto, James Franco and in 2020, Joaquin honoured him during his acceptance speech for Best Actor with another quote from him: 'Run to the rescue with love and peace will follow.'"
