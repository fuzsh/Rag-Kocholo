        "text": "OSCAR nominee Joaquin Phoenix opened up about the tragic death of his brother River in rare candid interview.\n\nThe Stand By Me actor died from a drug overdose outside the Viper Room club in 1993 aged 23, with Joaquin at his side.\n\nThe notoriously private 45-year-old rarely discusses his brother's passing but opened up to Anderson Cooper on 60 Minutes about how much River meant to him.\n\nHe said: \"I feel like in virtually every movie that I made, there was a connection to River in some way.\n\n\"And I think that we've all felt his presence and guidance in our lives in numerous ways.\"\n\nAt the time of River's untimely death, he had earned critically acclaim for his performances in My Own Private Idaho, The Mosquito Coast and Running on Empty, for which he was nominated for an Oscar.\n\nYet, Joker star Joaquin, who is nominated for Best Actor at the 92nd Academy Awards, explained how his brother tragic passing in the public eye impacted their family.\n\nHe continued: \"You know, River was a really substantial actor and movie star and we didn't really know it.\n\n\"And having the passing be so public crippled the family in a way they found too challenging.\n\n\"During that time in which you're most vulnerable, there are helicopters flying over, there are people that are trying to sneak onto your land,\" he added.\n\n\"Certainly, for me, it felt like it impeded on the mourning process.\"\n\nJoaquin also discussed how River inspired him to pursue acting after introducing him to Martin Scorsese's cinematic classic Raging Bull starring Robert De Niro.\n\n\"He came home and very excitedly say, here’s this movie,\" said the star. \"I think it just… awakened something in me.\"\n\nJoaquin's candid interview comes a day after he took home the Best Actor award at the Critics' Choice Awards.\n\nHis win comes a week after he walked away with the gong for Best Actor in a drama film at the Golden Globes awards.\n\nThe Walk The Line actor attended the event alongside his long-term love Rooney Mara, who he has been dating for three years."
