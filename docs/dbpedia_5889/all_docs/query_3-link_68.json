        "text": "Joaquin and Mara weren't the ones to announce the news of their son's birth in 2020. According to the Los Angeles Times, Victor Kossakovsky, a Russian filmmaker that worked with Joaquin on the 2020 documentary film \"Gunda,\" revealed the news at the Zurich Film Festival in September 2020, telling the crowd, \"[Phoenix] just got a baby, by the way...A beautiful son called River.\"\n\nThe couple haven't publicly shared photos of River, and keep their son out of the spotlight. Since becoming a mom, however, Mara shared an open letter as part of Farm Sanctuary's Mother's Day campaign (via People), writing in part, \"Raising our baby, River, has opened my heart to a whole new life filled with hope and more determination than ever to create a kinder and more sustainable world.\""
