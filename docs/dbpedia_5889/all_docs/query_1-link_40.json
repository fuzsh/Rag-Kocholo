        "text": "River Phoenix was one of Hollywood's most promising young talents when his life was cut tragically short exactly 30 years ago in 1993.\n\nThe older brother of Oscar-winning actor Joaquin Phoenix was one of the lost stars of the '90s. He was an immense talent, having shot to fame in the 1986 film Stand By Me and My Own Private Idaho in 1991.\n\nHe was only in his early 20s, but River was at the peak of his career. It all ended, however, when he walked into an infamous Los Angeles nightclub in the early hours of October 31, 1993.\n\nThis week marks 30 years since Phoenix died, and the devastating moment remains sharp as ever in the minds of fans after his friend and co-star Matthew Perry's premature death on October 28, 2023.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Three unthinkable words made everyone cry': Chandler Bing's best moments\n\nPerry and Phoenix met on the set of the 1988 coming-of-age film A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon and quickly became \"firm friends\", as the late sitcom star described in his memoir Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing.\n\nIn the book, Perry recalled filming the movie in Chicago and being swept away by Phoenix's raw and unmatched talent.\n\nJust five years later, Phoenix died of a drug overdose and Perry spoke about his struggle, grief and how it compounded his battle with addiction in an eerily prophetic tone in the memoir.\n\nREAD MORE: 'When I die, I don't want that': Perry's wish revealed in interview\n\n\"River was a beautiful man inside and out – too beautiful for this world, it turned out,\" the Friends star wrote.\n\n\"It always seems to be the really talented guys who go down.\"\n\nPerry said he \"heard the screaming\" from outside the Viper Room from his apartment in Los Angeles the night Phoenix died. \"Went back to bed; woke up to the news,\" he added.\n\nRiver attended the Viper Room, a club owned by actor Johnny Depp, the night before Halloween with his girlfriend Samantha Mathis. He wasn't supposed to go out clubbing that night, Mathis later told The Guardian.\n\nThe couple had originally intended to just drop off River's siblings, Joaquin (then known as Leaf) and Rain.\n\n\"But when we arrived he said to me: 'Oh, there are some people playing music tonight in the club who want me to play with them – that's OK, right?'\" she told the publication in 2018.\n\nMatthew Perry's life and career in pictures\n\nThe exclusive Viper Room was established that same year and was a regular haunt for some of Hollywood's biggest names. Michael Hutchence of INXS played his last gig there in 1997 and some artists fled there to escape paparazzi.\n\nSadly, it was also renowned for its drug scene.\n\nThat night, River had planned on performing with the band P, a combination of Flea and John Frusciante from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Johnny Depp and several others.\n\nREAD MORE: 'I'd see him on TV': Perry didn't know famous dad until he was 15\n\nDuring the performance, according to friend Bob Forrest, River said he was feeling unwell.\n\nForrest wrote in his book Running with Monsters that the actor had been doing drugs all day and was concerned he was in the midst of an overdose.\n\nJust 45 minutes later, River stumbled outside The Viper Room and collapsed onto the sidewalk.\n\n\"Whenever his brother's name is mentioned, Joaquin's face goes far-away looking. You can visibly see the pain.\"\n\nMathis, Rain, Flea and Forrest all attempted to help revive their dying brother and friend, while Joaquin called 911 from a payphone. River was suffering from cardiac arrest and was soon rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre.\n\n\"He's having seizures,\" Joaquin said on the phone in audio of the 911 call. \"Get over here please, please, cause he's dying, please.\"\n\nEarly on Halloween morning, River was pronounced dead at the age of 23.\n\nThe death of River, a precocious force within Hollywood, sent a ripple effect of grief throughout the celebrity scene in Los Angeles.\n\nThe young actor was a friend to many big name stars, including Perry, Keanu Reeves, Michael J. Fox and Ethan Hawke.\n\nBut none could understand the pain River's younger brother, Joaquin, was feeling.\n\nJoaquin and River shared a remarkably close bond, having grown up in the same bizarre household and raised by their travelling hippy parents.\n\nA famous 1985 photo of the pair, cooking at a stovetop, is remembered as a symbol of their unbreakable bond, even in death.\n\nJoaquin was only 19 when River overdosed outside The Viper Room. The memory of seeing his beloved sibling dying on the sidewalk never truly left the Joker actor.\n\n\"River is the largest influence, to this day, on Joaquin's life,\" an anonymous Hollywood casting director told Page Six in 2020.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here.\n\n\"Whenever his brother's name is mentioned, Joaquin's face goes far-away looking. You can visibly see the pain. Still. It's always there.\"\n\nJoaquin and his wife, actress Rooney Mara, even named their son River after the actor's dearly departed brother.\n\nDuring his acceptance speech for his Best Actor Oscar in 2020, Joaquin also made a rare public statement about River.\n\nCelebrity deaths of 2023\n\nHe credited the late star for steering him onto the path of becoming a famous actor.\n\n\"When he was 17, my brother wrote this lyric, 'Run to the rescue with love, and peace will follow',\" Joaquin said, as the crowd of Oscar attendees cheered.\n\n\"The night River died is forever burned into Joaquin's consciousness,\" another film producer told Page Six of Joaquin.\n\n\"It has a lot to do with how intensely private he is and how he tries to keep every aspect of his personal life secret. He's just always afraid of revealing his hurt.\""
