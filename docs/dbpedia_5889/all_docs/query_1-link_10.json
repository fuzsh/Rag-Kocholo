        "text": "R24 Joaquin was too weird and too much of a fragile needy creep for Liv Tyler, who grew up around junkies & egomaniacal rockstars & ex-hippie operatives & sex freaks and also had a groupie Queen for a mother. That tells us all we have to know.\n\n[quote] Anyone remember the rumour that Joaquin had a kid with his sister?\n\nR15 I just fell back down a rabbit hole of reading about the Phoenix Family skeletons again and remembered this rumor thinking I was crazy, so I'm glad someone else can confirm it has been said before and wasn't just my imagination filling in blanks.\n\nIt's fascinating. If you search 'does Rain Phoenix have kids/any children' or 'is Rain Phoenix a mother' on any search engine, the results return many pages including her official IMDB profile detailing a son named Winter Phoenix - or alternatively Jonas Winter Phoenix - who was allegedly born February 7th 1993 (making said son 26 going on 27 years old, now) of a mysterious \"past relationship\" Rain had with an unnamed father. This man Winter/Jonas, if he exists, would have been born in secret when Rain was just 20 and starting her career which of course is not a good look for an aspiring waif ingenue songwriter whose imperilled family are famous yet still can't make ends meet. The early '90s was still a fairly unforgiving time for young unmarried mothers and for young female artists in the public eye, so it's perfectly believable that Rain could have got pregnant and aborted or could have taken 9 months off and quietly left a baby boy with a more stable safe family in obscurity (Gods know that would have been the most humane thing to do, and she's all about the power of humanitarianism apparently). If this supposed son was got by her dear younger brother as the rumors all agree is likely? Well, even more reason to keep it hush.\n\nHowever, looking deeper at the same search results, the more obscure and more recent returns show threads & articles debunking this claim, saying that Rain has never had a child and that the story was just a salacious concoction of press and/or something one of the Phoenix siblings made up to spook their friends as part of druggy rambling monologues out in the Hollywood Hills. From my research there are no photos & images or active social media accounts available online showing a man in his 20s going by the name 'Jonas/Winter Phoenix' nor any pictures of a pregnant younger Rain, and there is no trace of official public documents backing up the mystery child story either. Even Wiki doesn't list a son for Rain, for what it's worth as a source (which admittedly is not a lot). Rain has never been seen with a younger boy who could plausibly be a son of this age, and yet she has been photographed with her nephews & nieces (Liberty's passel of kids) before - surely any son of hers would want to spend time and be seen with his cousins?\n\nMy conclusions run thus - a) Winter/Jonas was born to Rain (and possibly/probably Joaquin) then given up for adoption and today lives under a different name with a different family, hopefully clueless about his true parentage & origin, or b) Winter/Jonas was born to Rain (and possibly/probably Joaquin) and died very young or was aborted which is something the family don't like to bring up and tried to cover up, but they couldn't completely clear all trace about him, or c) Winter/Jonas never did exist, and the media or River made up the story out of spite (or maybe to spook her out of dating her brother?).\n\nI'm so intrigued. I just want to know the truth."
