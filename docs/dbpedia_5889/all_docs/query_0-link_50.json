        "text": "There are plenty of âwhat could have beenâ stories in Hollywood history, many of them focused on casting what-ifs, but some of them are based around a tragedy.\n\nWhat could have been if Heath Ledger, after his iconic performance as the Joker, hadnât accidentally overdosed? What could have been if James Dean hadnât died in a car crash after starring in a mere three movies?\n\nWhat could have been if River Phoenix, one of the most promising young actors of his generation, hadnât died at the Viper Room at the age of 23? Maybe his career wouldnât have been similar to the one his little brother Joaquin has made for himself. Unfortunately, weâll never find out.\n\nOver the weekend, Joaquin and his partner Rooney Mara welcomed their first child and named him River. Director Victor Kossakovvksy revealed the name after a screening of his documentary Gunda, which Phoenix produced, telling the crowd, âHe just got a baby by the way â¦ A beautiful son called River.â\n\nItâs clear Joaquin had much admiration for his older brother, and naming his first-born after him is a touching tribute to a talented young actor who never had the chance to have a full career. Perhaps it wouldnât have been all that unlike Joaquinâs impressive resume.\n\nJoaquin won an Oscar for his role as the Joker in last yearâs Todd Phillips movie, and heâs consistently been one of the most interesting and acclaimed actors of the decade. His older brother died before he had a chance to win an Academy Award, but his performances in Stand By Me, Running on Empty, and My Own Private Idaho suggest it wouldnât have been long.\n\nHe may have never won an Oscar, but his memory lives on.\n\nGaming and music go hand-in-hand, and Spotify hosts over two million gaming-related playlists. This makes their jump into the so-called metaverse a no-brainer, since itâs apparently real, and we will, in fact, have to deal with it. But when Spotify invited The Dad to take a first-hand look at their partnership with Roblox, I was excited to ask the hard-hitting questions dads need to know. Questions like âWhat is Roblox?â and âNo, really, is it likeâ¦like what is it?â\n\nOkay, most of us have at least heard of Roblox and perhaps even used it as a motivating tool for chores or good grades or being left alone for an hour. Despite the surging popularity of feel-good, low lift video games like Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley, however, Iâve never actually played the game. But Spotify recognizes the fantastic potential of video games to connect people and has created a space within the game world for users to connect through a love of music. I was given a chance to explore âSpotify Island,â a unique little sanctuary within Roblox, and play around with the features. While itâs not exactly Elden Ring in terms of gameplay nuance, itâs an early look at the merging of all our digital spheres, and certainly a first step toward how entertainment will start to feel in the coming years.\n\nSidenote: I have to say, the Spotify office is pretty rad. When I arrived, there was a full coffee bar in the lobby, complete with a barista who was very unimpressed by my order of regular black coffee. Look, Spotify, you know me, you know how many times a week I listen to Bruce Springsteenâs Darkness on the Edge of Town; what kind of coffee did you expect me to order?\n\nAnyway, the Roblox thing. The game allows players to engage with user-generated content, mainly in the form of mini-games players can create and share. The basic gameplay of Spotify Island is to parkour your way around a digital island paradise, collecting heart-shaped tokens, finding hidden easter eggs, and interacting with other players at beat-making stations. The tokens you collect can be exchanged for in-game content, such as emotes and cosmetic changes to your avatar. Thatâs all pretty familiar territory to online gamers, but the hook is how Spotify will use this space to host unique moments between artists and fans.\n\nIn-game, Spotify will host mini-quests, virtual meet-and-greets, and other interactive experiences with artists, including, obviously, selling MERCH! Yes, what kid hasnât begged for some extra virtual dollars to spend on a virtual t-shirt for their virtual person. As someone who spent money on multiple skins for the various Avengers in a game I donât even like, I have no commentary on this. But while itâs Dad Law to roll your eyes and act like your wallet is welded shut in these scenarios, Spotify made clear that in-game merch proceeds go directly to the artist. The artists are also as involved with the creative process as theyâd like to be. Collectables and achievements are nothing new in video games â or, as weâve seen with NFTs in the last year, real life for that matter. Considering the gameâs been around since 2006, many artists will have grown up on Roblox themselves. Iâm sure some young popstars will be thrilled to design in-game swag to share with fans. And Iâm doubly sure preteens will lose their mind for it.\n\nSpotfiy Island is a video game, but itâs more like a virtual lounge. Iâm told there will be multiple islands added to the game world, with different themes and genres for each.This allows players to find their own little place in the metaverse based on their taste and creativity. Notably, the island features a large stage central to the action. While itâs not mentioned as part of an official release, itâs easy to see virtual events down the line, like how Fortnite has been used as a digital venue for concerts, movie trailers, and other #trending #things.\n\nThey announced they were starting partnerships with K-Pop icons Sunmi and Stray Kids, and I politely pretended to know who they were. Iâm sure the kids will be excited.\n\nDads love history, monuments, and museums. In one of natureâs cruelest twists, kids are, historically, not huge fans.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my dad LOOOVED taking us to the Wright Patterson Air Force Museum. He was unphased by our groans and complaints, in fact he may have been fueled by them, as dads often are. Itâs not that he didnât care that we didnât like it. Now that Iâm a dad I realize he took ambivalence as a challenge, that he would be able to convince us of how fascinating it all really was.\n\nâ â â â â â\n\nMy family just got back from a trip to Washington DC for the White House Easter Egg Roll. The last time I was in DC was 30 years ago. I was 10. Coincidentally my son is now 10 (and my daughter is 12). So while we were sightseeing, I constantly compared it with what it must have been like when my dad took me there in 1993.\n\nâ â â â â â\n\nOur flight left Cincinnati at 6:30am. We left our house at 3am, because dads love arriving super early for flights. Dads love to beat the rush and dads love early flights because the airport is less crowded. Etc etc etc. Some cliches are true.\n\nOne of the first things we did was walk by the White House. DC was eerily empty Saturday morning but walking along the north side of the White House a Secret Service SUV suddenly stopped and rolled down its window. âHEY!â Uh ohâ¦ âTHE DAD!â Uh ohhhhhh.\n\nLet me pause and say that my kids do not think Iâm cool. Partly because nobodyâs kids think their parents are cool but mostly because I am 100% absolutely positively NOT COOL. Their assessment is spot on. But this was as if I scripted a scene that attempted to convince them I am cool.\n\nAn impressive Secret Service Officer got out of the car and shook my hand. He said âWe see celebrities a lot but I donât normally stop. But THE DAD? I love your guysâ stuff.â (As contractually required I assured him our content is made by a team of talented creators and Iâm basically a boring business guy at this point.)\n\nHe got his police dog out of the car and let the kids pet him, even though heâs a highly trained combat doggo.\n\nMy son told him his goal was to play Joe Biden in basketball. The guy said, âWellll I donât know how athletic he is.â (Leaned closer and lowered voice.) âWell, actually I do but Iâm not allowed to say.â\n\nAs he went back to patrolling, I gave my kids a knowing glance that asked, âNow do you think Iâm cool?â\n\nThey responded with a glance back that unequivocally said, âStill nope. But the dog was cool.â Nonetheless, I am so grateful to that guy for stopping and raising my cool score from -1 to, perhaps, 0.\n\nDid anything similar happen on my previous trip to DC in 1993? No because my dadâs meme game was trash due to memes not existing yet.\n\nâ â â â â â\n\nThe rest of the day was quintessential DC tourist stuff. So go ahead and play some montage background music in your head while you glance at pics. (Star Spangled Banner is a timeless choice but Iâll also accept My Country âTis of Thee.)\n\nCliche right? We even did the âPretend to lean on the Washington Monumentâ pic.\n\nâ â â â â â\n\nDid I appreciate DC more as a dad than as a 10-year-old kid? In ways words canât describe. I stood in front of the Lincoln Memorial realizing this is the spot where Martin Luther King Jr gave the I Have a Dream Speech. I imagined throngs of people gathered. So much happened RIGHT HERE.\n\nWe went to Fordâs Theater, where Abraham Lincoln was shot. I imagined the what ifs. What if John Wilkes Booth DIDNâT do that? What if the gun jammed?\n\nLife is tenuous. All of the moments that happened, both good and bad, celebratory and tragic, have led to the present and made our reality what it is. Historic spots, monuments, museumsâ¦ they are documentation of the most important moments that got us here. Theyâre the inspiration for living a better life and making our childrenâs realities more rich and full.\n\nI looked at my kids. Did they realize the enormity? Did they appreciate the history? My daughter said something so profound. (This is an exact quote. I wrote it down in my phone so I could get it just right.) She said, âYou should be grateful to have kids like us. Weâve been up since 3am doing your crap.â\n\nI think she gets it.\n\nâ â â â â â\n\nIn 2.5 days we walked over 60,000 steps. When weâd stop Iâd say âI need to rest the ole gams.â (Gams being a funny word for legs.) This became our running joke. Because what is a family trip if not a series of inside jokes you can look back on later in life. So the theme of this trip was not historical reflection as intended, but rather âresting the gams.â When we walked through White House security for the Easter Egg Roll on our last day in DC, my son asked the Secret Service Officer, âIs this the gam resting station?â\n\nIn 1993, we toured the inside of the White House. We couldnât do that on this trip. Best I could offer was the South Lawn. What an amazing experience to walk the grounds. We saw the President, First Lady, the Easter Bunny, and Jimmy Fallon.\n\nMy son shouted for the dancing duck to âhit the griddy!â What would the 1993 equivalent of this be? âDo the Macarena!â? Kids, hitting the griddy is just a modern version of the Macarena. Ruined the griddy. Youâre welcome.\n\n@thedad\n\nAn attempt was made @thejoelwillis #hitthegriddy\n\nâ¬ original sound â The Dad\n\nA guy in the VIP section saw a friend near us and came over to shake his hand. My son said, âHey dude can I get one of those too?â (a handshake). The guy shook my sonâs hand and said, âNice to meet you. Iâm Hunter.â\n\nTrue parenting media brand aficionados will appreciate this: I got to hang with Micaela Birmingham and Alison Bucalo from Scary Mommy!\n\nMy kidsâ favorite part? A pop up concert from Sofia Carson. In true dad fashion, I didnât know who she was (despite her 16.3M IG followers) until my daughter told me she was Evie in The Descendents. Ah yes! Chillin Like a Villain! Historic.\n\n@thedad\n\nWe were at the White House yesterday for the Easter Egg Roll. @Joel Willisâs son got a selfie with @SofiaCarson and his reaction (and the pic) are killing me ð¤£\n\nâ¬ original sound â The Dad\n\nâ â â â â â\n\nIâve exaggerated for comedic effect. My kids appreciated the history more than most would. Certainly more than I did in 1993.\n\nAs parents, we need to remind ourselves: the point of historic sightseeing with your kids is not to induce some epiphany about their unique place in history and the world; the point is to create memories with your kids that theyâll look back on and appreciate when theyâre older.\n\nâ â â â â â\n\nAfter I became a dad, when my kids were little, we invited my dad to go with us to the Wright Patterson Air Force Museum. I hadnât been since I was a kid. Ya know what? Through adult eyes it really was fascinating. My dad won the challenge after all.\n\nMy kids humored us and were as interested as kids can get. But they got to spend time with their grandpa. Thatâs what it was about all along.\n\nHe passed away a few weeks later and that was one of the last times we saw him. Iâll be forever grateful that we took that last trip to the museum.\n\nHistory isnât only boring museums, statues, and lengthy esoteric plaques. History is personal: our family, memories, shared experiences, and inside jokes. Some fascinating, some boring. Some heroic, some tragic. Thatâs the stuff life is made of.\n\nThe idea of unleashing your child into the digital world gives parents the same trepidation traditionally reserved for teaching a hormone-crazed teenager how to merge into rush hour traffic. Sure, the World Wide Web can be a scary place, but in a lot of ways, the experience is better than when we were kids. What weâve lost in dial-up noises, weâve gained in parental controls and strategies to make the online world a healthier environment for our kids.\n\nYou Control the World They Play In\n\nThere arenât many phrases scarier for a parent than âin-app purchases available.â Thankfully, you can add layers of purchasing restrictions to make sure your kid doesnât convert your life savings into video game currency.\n\nOnce you have your pocketbook protected, most apps and services also have filters you can apply to serve up only age-appropriate content. Video platforms get better every day at creating a digital world with training wheels for pre-teens. Most games restrict chat functions for younger kids so you donât have to worry about strangers trying to make small talk with your second grader who simply wants to feed a pretend horse in an open-world environment.\n\nMost importantly, keeping kids aware of your screen time rules â and enforcing them â will go a long way to keeping their digital habit a healthy one.\n\nTodayâs Parental Supervision Tools Are Next Level\n\nJust as you want to know who your kidâs in-person friends are, you can monitor their early digital interactions to make sure theyâre using the internet for good. Apps like Messenger Kids create a safer environment where kids can interact and play with their buddies while parents keep an eye on their whole experience.\n\nMessaging apps are not only a great way for kids to stay connected with buddies outside of a classroom or play date, but theyâre a solid introduction for kids to the digital world. They foster creativity by giving kids freedom in how they play and connect, while also aiding social and emotional development by helping kids stay in touch with friends and family members.\n\nWith Messenger Kids, you have your own separate Parent Dashboard that allows you to manage your kidâs contact list, set âoff timesâ to enforce screen time limits, and check in on your childâs conversations, which is especially helpful with younger kids.\n\nYouâre Already Teaching Them What They Need To Know\n\nIsolation and bullying are among the biggest dangers for teenagers growing up digitally. Actually, theyâre some of the biggest problems of being a kid, period. But just as the digital world can intensify some of those issues, smart digital tools can also be part of the solution.\n\nMany apps and platforms are joining the mission to educate and encourage positive behaviors in the digital realm. The Messenger Kids Pledge echoes the attitudes we want our kids to exhibit in real life: Be Kind, Be Respectful, Be Safe, and Have Fun. To help kids learn these behaviors and put them into practice, Messenger Kidsâ new interactive Pledge Planets activity puts kids in charge of helping characters navigate social situations by using their digital citizenship skills. Messenger Kidsâ interactive games also have report functions to help dramatically limit in-game bullying, while parental supervision tools let you monitor your kidâs online play.\n\nFortunately, there has never been more education and awareness in schools to combat issues like bullying. Those are the same values and lessons youâre instilling in your kids at home, both in-person and online.\n\nSpending Time Online With Your Kid Can Be an Incredible Bonding Experience\n\nHaving an online kid doesnât have to be scary â it can actually enhance your relationship. Itâs something fun to do together. You donât have to wait to throw a ball around the yard, you can destroy your fourth-grader in your favorite racing game. Meeting your kid on their level and gaming together, whether itâs a world-building game or a team-up-to-defend-the-world-from-zombies game, are memories theyâll carry forever. And it gives you a chance to model the behavior you expect from them online.\n\nAlso, an ongoing messaging relationship with your kid can bring you closer. Nothing cheers up the final quarter of your workday like your kid sending a GIF on Messenger Kids after they get home from school. Ask a child how school was, and they listlessly respond, âFine.â Ask via text, and they might give you a whole breakdown of whatâs going on â though it might be communicated with memes and emojis. Still, it adds a whole new dimension to your relationship. And you canât ask for much more than that.\n\nMessenger Kids is the video, voice, and messaging app designed for kids to connect with family and friends.

Even the Fast and the Furious family.\n\nThatâs what happened with Vin Diesel and The Rock, who very publicly dislike each other and stopped teaming up on Fast movies. The Rock showed up for Fast 5, 6, 7, and 8, then had enough, did his Diesel-free Hobbs and Shaw spinoff movie, and said sayonara. But Diesel, perhaps after Fast 8 and Fast 9 werenât quite as furious as heâd hoped, finally saw the light and asked The Rock to return for Fast 10 to wrap up the series. To which The Rock said: Nah.\n\nA few months ago, Diesel posted to Instagram:\n\nâThe world awaits the finale of âFast 10,ââ Diesel wrote. âAs you know, my children refer to you as Uncle Dwayne in my house. There is not a holiday that goes by that they and you donât send well wishesâ¦ but the time has come. Legacy awaits. I told you years ago that I was going to fulfill my promise to Pablo. I swore that we would reach and manifest the best Fast in the finale that is 10!â\n\nDiesel took to Instagram to essentially beg The Rock to return. The Rock has finally responded. Not in the way Vin Diesel wanted.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, the DCâs Black Adam laid it all out:\n\nâI told [Diesel] directly that I would not be returning to the franchise. I was firm yet cordial with my words and said that I would always be supportive of the cast and always root for the franchise to be successful, but that there was no chance I would return.â\n\nHe directly addressed Dieselâs social media post asking him back: âVinâs recent public post was an example of his manipulation. I didnât like that he brought up his children in the post, as well as Paul Walkerâs death. Leave them out of it. We had spoken months ago about this and came to a clear understanding.â\n\nThere are no hard feelings, of course.\n\nâMy goal all along was to end my amazing journey with this incredible franchise with gratitude and grace. Itâs unfortunate that this public dialogue has muddied the waters. Regardless, Iâm confident in the âFastâ universe and its ability to consistently deliver for the audienceâ¦ I truly wish my former co-stars and crew members the best of luck and success in the next chapter.â\n\nAnd thatâs that."
