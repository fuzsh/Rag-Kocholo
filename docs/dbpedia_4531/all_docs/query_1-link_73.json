In 1950 the Belgian Gladio was set up with the help of the CIA and British Agents. Organisation: Gladio was coordinated by NATO and run by the military secret service in close cooperation with the CIA and British MI6 (Wikipedia). Gladio was ultimately answerable to the NATO-CIA command and could initiate anti-communist operations by themselves, although they needed sanction and funds from the existing “official” Gladio column. In Belgium, the only elected representatives who knew about its existence were the prime ministers and defence ministers."
