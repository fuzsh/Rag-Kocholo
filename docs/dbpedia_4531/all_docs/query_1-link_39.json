        "text": "Both US journalist Nebojsa Malic and HabertÃ¼rk reporter Ozcan Tikit have referenced Operation Gladio in connection with the assassination attempt on Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico on 15 May. Additionally, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan convened an emergency meeting on the night of 14-15 May, responding to warnings of a coup attempt similar to the one in 2016. This has suddenly sparked global interest in the NATO-CIA secret terror army.\n\nOrigins and purpose of Operation Gladio\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOperation Gladio was a clandestine operation involving a network of “stay-behind” armies established in Europe during the Cold War. These paramilitary groups were organised by NATO and the CIA with the cooperation of European intelligence agencies to prepare for a potential Soviet invasion.\n\nThe operation was conceived during the early Cold War period when Western powers were deeply concerned about the spread of communism and a potential Soviet invasion of Western Europe. NATO played a central role in coordinating these secret armies aiming to ensure that resistance would continue even if the official military forces were defeated or occupied.\n\nPublic exposure and political outcry\n\nThe existence of Gladio in Italy came to light in the early 1990s when Italian prime minister Giulio Andreotti disclosed its activities. It was revealed that the network had been involved in several violent incidents including bombings and assassinations to destabilise the political situation and prevent left-wing parties from gaining power.\n\nThe revelations about Gladio caused significant public and political outcry in several countries. Parliamentary inquiries were held in Italy, Belgium and other nations raising numerous questions about the legality and ethical implications of such operations. The secretive nature of Gladio has led to numerous conspiracy theories suggesting deeper and more widespread covert operations influencing European politics during the Cold War.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVincenzo Vinciguerra, who received a life sentence for his involvement in a car bombing in Italy, shed light on the insidious tactics employed by Gladio operatives. In 1992, he revealed that he and his fellow Gladio guerrillas were instructed to carry out attacks targetting civilians, including women and children. They aimed to sow fear and panic among the population, thereby justifying increased state control. This chilling revelation underscores the ruthless nature of Gladio’s operations and its disregard for the lives of innocent individuals., according to Sputnik.\n\nManipulating European political affairs\n\nThe Sputnik report said that the CIA and NATO manipulated European political affairs through Gladio. One declassified Gladio operation, “Piano Solo” (1964), envisaged kidnapping Italian prime minister Aldo Moro to prevent the formation of a left-leaning coalition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGladio terror armies have reportedly been discovered in Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, Austria, Greece and Turkey. It has been revealed that Gladio forces operated at least 139 clandestine weapons depots throughout Europe.\n\nThese units were composed of right-wing and anti-communist elements often including former soldiers, intelligence agents and sometimes individuals with fascist sympathies. Gladio also recruited ordinary civilians. According to declassified UK documents, recruits were chosen to avoid suspicion “by virtue of their age, sex, and activities.” Members received training in guerrilla warfare, sabotage, and intelligence gathering. They were supplied with weapons and other resources, which were often hidden in secret caches across Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom defence to political manipulation\n\nWhile initially intended as a defensive measure against a Soviet invasion, some of these groups became involved in internal political activities including influencing elections, engaging in acts of terrorism and manipulating political processes to counteract left-wing movements and parties.\n\nAlthough much of the detailed information about Operation Gladio remains classified the revelations in the 1990s forced many Western governments to acknowledge and, to some extent, account for their involvement in such covert activities. Gladio’s legacy is a testament to the lengths Cold War powers were willing to go to maintain influence and control often blurring the lines between legitimate defence and undemocratic manipulation."
