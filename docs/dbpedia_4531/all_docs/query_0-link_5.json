        "text": "Operation Gladio (Italian: Operazione Gladio) is the codename for a clandestine NATO \"stay-behind\" operation in Italy after World War II[1]. Its purpose was to continue anti-communist actions in the event of a shift to a Communist party led government. Although Gladio specifically refers to the Italian branch of the NATO stay-behind organizations, \"Operation Gladio\" is used as an informal name for all stay-behind organizations, sometimes called \"Super NATO\". The name Gladio is the Italian form of gladius, a type of Roman shortsword.\n\nMentioned by Malory Archer on the episode \"Lo Scandalo ,\" where she admits to participating in it. Lana describes it as turning into a \"weird crypto-fascist CIA shitshow, starring Allen Dulles and a bunch of former Nazis.\""
