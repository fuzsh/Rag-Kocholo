Comment It is suspected that the Pattern 1 button was used on horsecar crew greatcoats, though this is by no means proven.

The stylised shield is a cut down version of the arms of the City of Derby, the so-called 'buck in the park'. This actually depicts a stag at rest within palings and is supposedly derived from the badge of Richard II. The absence of the stag supporters, as well as the city's motto 'Industria Virtus et Fortitudo' (diligence, courage and strength), is explained by the fact that these were only granted in 1939, five years after the demise of the tramway.

It is unclear when the corporation undertaking was renamed 'Derby Corporation Transport', but probably after the demise of the trams. Trams, buses and trolleybuses simply carried 'Derby Corporation' rather than 'Tramways', 'Transport' or 'Motors'.
