        "text": "They would be at home in Game of Thrones, where each great house famously has its own words to rally its troops behind.\n\nBut long before the TV fantasy epic took over our screens, the historic counties of the UK each had their own motto as well.\n\nFrom the religious to the fearsome, the inspiring to the just plain weird, most areas of the country would once have had a common saying designed to unite their people.\n\nWhile the land was originally divided into administrative areas by the Romans, over time these artificial borders have come to represent the best and worst of regional pride – particularly over centuries of foreign invasion and civil war.\n\nToday, these mottoes are mostly hushed-up in favour of county slogans – the more modern, publicity department-generated captions you see on ‘Welcome To…’ signs.\n\nCounty slogans are designed to entice tourists, whereas mottoes are often fear-inducing statements designed to warn outsiders of a region’s ferocious might and superiority.\n\nOnStride.co.uk has rounded up all of the known county mottos, to create a unique map of the county's history.\n\nDerbyshire's motto\n\nOur county's own Latin motto is Bene Consulendo or By Good Counsel , meaning wise deliberation.\n\nThe motto appears on the county coat of arms, which depicts a stag and a ram alongside a shield depicting the Tudor Rose and three stag's heads.\n\nThe motto of every country in England\n\nThe county mottoes of England are particularly insular.\n\nTake the motto of Sussex: “We Wunt be Druv.” While it may sound like a line from EastEnders, in fact, the phrase is in the Sussex dialect and means “we will not be driven.”\n\nIn other words, people from Sussex will not be told what to do.\n\nOthers are more explicitly martial in tone. “No retreat” (Buckinghamshire), “By the right and dignity of the sword” (Cheshire), and Kent's “Invicta” – Latin for ‘unconquered’ – sound particularly fearsome.\n\nHowever, the county of Cumbria was established as late as 1974, and the picturesque region is spared the fighting talk: the coat of arms borrows a line from the Bible, “I shall lift up mine eyes unto the hills.”\n\nThe motto of every country in Scotland\n\nThe Scots are known for their smart turn of phrase when a limited number of characters are available.\n\nClackmannanshire boasts the supremely Scottish motto “Leuk Aboot Ye,” for example.\n\nMeaning, ‘Look around you’ the motto is in reference to an ancient story about King Robert and his squire searching for a lost glove.\n\nOther counties mottoes are simpler favouring “Vigilance” (Lanarkshire), hope (“In hope,” Morayshire), or “law and liberty” (Perthshire).\n\nRoxburghshire’s super-precise piece of advice (Ne Cede Malis Sed Contra Audentior Ito/Yield not to evil things but rather go on more boldly) shows how well-read the locals are – it’s a line from Virgil’s epic poem The Aeneid.\n\nThe motto of every country in Wales\n\nAll the mottoes of Wales are in Gaelic, an older or newer form of Welsh, or Latin.\n\nAnd Welsh motto-makers seem particularly keen on two values: freedom and prosperity.\n\n“Undeb Hedd Llwyddiant/Unity, peace, prosperity,” says Brecknockshire.\n\n“Golud Gwlad Rhyddid/A nation’s wealth is freedom,” claims Cardiganshire.\n\n“Rhyddid gwerin ffyniant gwlad/A free people, a prosperous country,” states Carmarthenshire.\n\nBut there are a couple of counties keen on defining their place within the country.\n\nAnglesey’s motto is “Môn Mam Cymru” (the mother of Wales) due to the capacity of its fertile land to provide for the nation.\n\nPowys rather boldly claims to be the paradise of Wales (“Powys paradwys Cymru”) and with its rolling mountains, valleys, and farmlands, it’s hard to disagree.\n\nThe motto of every country in Northern Ireland\n\nThe six counties of Northern Ireland seem to differ on the secret to success.\n\nTheir mostly Latin mottoes favour, amongst other things, teamwork (County Armagh’s “In Concilio Consilium”), hard work (Down’s “Absque labore nihil”), wisdom and prudence (Tyrone’s “Consilio et Prudentia”), or failing that, God (Londonderry’s “Auxilium a Domino” – “Help comes from the Lord”).\n\nThe exception is County Fermanagh, whose motto – “Feor Magh Eanagh” – is what the ancient Irish used to call the region.\n\nIt translates as “country of the lakes.” Which sounds altogether more welcoming than the counties mottoes of England!\n\nWhat about the missing counties?\n\nA handful of counties such as Aberdeenshire in Scotland and Berkshire in England have elected not to have a motto – and those are shown in grey on the maps.\n\nHampshire, for example, has had its present coat of arms since as recently as 1992, and the only words it bears are ‘Hampshire County Council’.\n\nOn promotional literature the county takes for its slogan a statement of local attractions, presented with unromantic minimalism: City – Coast – Country. Okay, so they’ve got it all – but a bit of poetry would have been nice!\n\nIn Scotland, Dumfriesshire, Kirkcudbrightshire, and Wigtownshire are all without mottoes.\n\nHowever, these counties are collected together under one ‘council area,’ Dumfries and Galloway – which boasts the slogan ‘Naturally Inspiring.\""
