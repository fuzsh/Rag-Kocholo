At ﬁrst this question might seem rather pedantic. Most historians have come to accept that it is legitimate to ask questions derived from modern social theory about societies which could not have asked them about themselves. Nonetheless, in the emerging ﬁeld of the history of masculinity, now some twenty years old, the problem of reconciling modern concepts with the thought-worlds of past societies has proved particularly troublesome.¹ Historians of masculinity have tended either to apply modern theories concerning male behaviour and identity to past societies, or else to focus on the analysis of past cultures and symbolic structures, but they have seldom combined the two approaches. Recent commentators have argued that this failure to pursue an ‘integrated approach’ to the history of masculinity is ﬁrst and foremost the result of methodological choices made by historians.² Yet, in fact, this is not quite the whole problem. In order to reconcile modern social theory and past culture, such an approach must ﬁrst overcome another difﬁculty inherent in the study of pre-modern masculinity, namely the lack of ﬁt between the analytical categories of historians and the cultural categories of their object of study. It is sometimes noted that before the mid-eighteenth century the word ‘masculinity’ was not in common usage, whereas ‘manhood’ was. It is less often observed that even on the level of its apparently simplest meaning, manhood is not quite the same thing as masculinity. A ‘man’ could be a human in contrast to an animal or a god, or an adult as opposed to child, as well as a male in contrast to a female. Yet manhood was not a simple, ungendered marker of maturity or personhood either. Although an awareness that gender is not independent of other factors shaping social identity has been central to the project of gender history from the beginning, the recognition of such interlinkage does not in itself offer any easy way out for historians who would like to ¹ The beginnings of the history of masculinity might be dated to Brod 1987, although see also the foundational contributions made by Scott 1986, Connell 1987, and Tosh 1994. ² Harvey and Shepard 2005: 276.\n\nvi\n\nPreface\n\ndistinguish ‘masculinity’ as one factor interacting with others in human action and social organization.³ Manhood and its cognates have their own characteristics, their own associations and internal logic, which sometimes almost correspond with modern concepts of masculinity, and sometimes seem quite different. I ﬁrst came up against these problems whilst trying to interpret the use of the themes of manhood and youth in the political controversies of the reign of Richard II. This king came to the throne at the age of 10. At the time of his deposition at the age of 32, it was argued by the archbishop of Canterbury that Richard was a ‘boy’, whereas his supplanter was a ‘man’. One writer presented him as feminine in appearance. A number of monastic chroniclers and contemporary poets portrayed him as a dissolute youth who was led away from the path of reason by youthful counsel. Sometimes they digressed from this picture to suggest that Richard had been ineffective in war. How should these themes be understood? Did they relate to what we would today mean by masculinity, or something else, perhaps something like adulthood? Is it possible to ﬁnd another approach, one which neither denies the gendered undercurrents in these texts, nor reduces everything to gender? And in what way, if at all, were these themes important to the political struggles of these years? The research project which ultimately led to the present book thus began with an analysis of certain political texts taken as instances of rhetoric. The initial aim was to understand the import of the themes which they manipulated in the context of both late medieval culture and the politics of this reign. It soon became clear that the conclusions which many had drawn from these texts—that Richard was somehow observably unmasculine or effeminate—did not stand up to an analysis of the complex discourses which his critics deployed. The ﬁrst result of this inquiry was thus to put into question accepted accounts of the king’s personality. As the project progressed, however, it took on a further dimension, as the focus moved from rhetoric to practice. The analysis of texts in terms of commonplace ideas of manhood and youth suggested new lines of inquiry concerning late fourteenth-century politics. If these terms were not selected by Richard’s critics purely because they ﬁtted the reality of his character, then why were they chosen? It increasingly ³ Scott 1986: 1067–9; Bloch 1989: 15–16. Such an approach is anticipated by the work of anthropologists, see e.g. Bourdieu 1972: 35; Ortner and Whitehead 1981: 6–9, 16–17.\n\nPreface\n\nvii\n\nseemed possible to go beyond a mere deconstruction of the accepted account of the character of the king, and to argue that commonplace ideas underlying the language of manhood had not just been chanced upon arbitrarily at the moment of his deposition, but had come to hand because of the rather different role they had played in the politics of the king’s earlier reign. Such a perspective offered a number of attractions, both in terms of what it could contribute to understanding Richard II’s reign, and in its possible contribution to debates taking place in gender history. First, the analysis of contemporary assumptions about manhood and youth opened up a lateral approach to accepted accounts of the reign, making it possible to put together a new picture of the events of 1377–99. Second, the politics of Richard II’s reign offered the chance to develop a detailed case study which would combine an inquiry into concepts such as manhood and youth with an analysis of one particular instance of social practice. The focus on one particular case might make it possible to proceed without suppressing the non-correspondence between modern categories and past cultural assumptions, since it would always be possible to appeal to the test: ‘How did this work in practice?’ Finally, such a study presented an opportunity to take up the challenge laid down by Joan Scott some twenty years ago, to explore the role of ideas associated with gender even in the realm of high politics. Notwithstanding these broader ambitions, however, this project would always be focused on Richard II. It is hoped that, in the coming pages, he will remain at the forefront of the reader’s mind even as the broader associations of his unmanly reputation are explored in detail. It is also hoped that the reader who is ﬁrst and foremost interested in the operation of gender in human action will bear with me as the focus on one particular instance of social practice takes the analysis away from gender alone. This book has been ten years in the making and during this period my intellectual debts have not ceased to accumulate. The suggestion that I might like to look at the history of masculinity is only the ﬁrst of my debts to Miri Rubin; since then she has been a constant source of inspiration and advice. The direction of that project towards Richard II, and the careful supervision of its ﬁrst steps as a Masters thesis—these debts are owed to Rosemary Horrox. After that, from the start of my doctoral thesis, John Watts took over the responsibility for trying to direct my youthful vigour and inconstancy into proﬁtable and reasonable channels. He has stuck with it ever since. How much I owe to\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\nhim will be obvious to anyone who reads this book. Perhaps less obvious, but no less palpable for that, are the contributions of my contemporaries as graduate students, many of whom are still trying to make their way in a system which often seems unconcerned with promoting the potential of youth, even of youths in their 30s. Chris Briggs, Ian Forrest, Leonie Hicks, Jenni Nuttall, Catherine Rider, James Ross, Dorthea Sartain, Sethina Watson, and especially Ewan Johnson deserve more than a mention. All sorts of conference and seminar audiences in Canterbury, Leeds, London, Oxford, Cambridge, and Norwich have been submitted to various drafts of various parts of what follows. They have duly pointed out my more glaring errors and given me material for further reﬂection. Caroline Barron, Paul Brand, David Carpenter, Anne Curry, Rees Davies, Cliff Davies, David d’Avray, Chris Given-Wilson, Steve Gunn, Ralph Hanna, Michael Hicks, Maurice Keen, Katherine Lewis, Sheila Lindenbaum, Mark Ormrod, Lyndal Roper, Nigel Saul, George Stow, Jenny Stratford, and Paul Strohm were all generous in their comments either in the ﬂesh or in reply to unsolicited offprints. More recently, I have had the good fortune to beneﬁt from the advice and conversation of John Arnold, Richard Partington, Magnus Ryan, and Alex Shepard, all of whom have had their inﬂuence on my thinking. I have beneﬁted from the unearned indulgence of many scholars who have made space in their overloaded schedules to read chapters in draft. Mark Ormrod and Rosemary Horrox kindly looked through and criticized much of the material which now makes up chapters 8 to 11. John Arnold, Catherine Rider, Steve Rigby, and John Watts made the ultimate sacriﬁce and generously read through and commented in detail on the typescript in its entirety—to them in particular I am indebted, and to Seth Cayley, Ceri Warner, and Kate Walker at Oxford University Press, for guiding this book through the last steps to publication. Finally, I owe much to my D.Phil. examiners, Simon Walker and Felicity Riddy, whose comments provided the blueprint following which the thesis was expanded, compressed, rewritten and transformed into the present book. It is a matter of great regret to me that neither Simon nor Rees Davies saw this book completed. The improvements which their conversation and criticism would have brought are the least loss caused by their passing. The practical conditions for researching this book were eased immeasurably by the staff of Cambridge University Library, the Bodleian and Taylorian Libraries in Oxford, the British Library, the National Archive, the Archives Nationales, Paris, the Bibliothèque Nationale\n\nPreface\n\nix\n\nFranc¸aise, and the Bibliothèque Municipale, Bordeaux. A scholarship from the Arts and Humanities Research Board funded my doctoral work; the post of Lecteur at the University of Bordeaux, and a spell as a lecturer at Queen Mary, University of London created the conditions for its continuation. A Drapers’ Company Research Fellowship at Pembroke College, Cambridge enabled me to complete the book within convenient reach of Derby Stores. Without the inspirational teaching of John Roebuck, when I was at school, and of all who supervised me as an undergraduate at Cambridge, I would never have thought of embarking on this project in the ﬁrst place. Without the support and encouragement of Helen, David, and Tony Fletcher it would never have reached completion. Without Frédérique Parrad, I would have gone a lot madder in the process. I can only hope that all those who have been dragged in to be acknowledged for this book’s merits can ﬁnd any worthy of mention; the responsibility for what remains, of course, is entirely my own.

The Lords and Commons, who had been summoned to parliament in the name of Richard II, had just approved the king’s deposition and had accepted Henry, duke of Lancaster as his replacement.¹ The archbishop gave an address in which he portrayed Richard as a ‘boy’ (puer), whereas Henry was a ‘man’ (vir). Beginning with a slight misquotation of the biblical passage in which God identiﬁed Saul as the future king of Israel, declaring that ‘A man will rule the people’,² Arundel went on to assert that God no longer threatened the English as he had threatened the people of Israel saying, after Isaiah, ‘I shall give you boys (pueros) to be your princes’.³ It must have seemed strange to contrast the deposed monarch and his usurper in this way, since Richard was at that time some 32 years old, and Henry was more or less the same age.⁴ This curious contrast between a ‘boy’ and a ‘man’ who were of the same chronological age was not the only striking aspect of the archbishop’s address. The elaboration of the faults of boys and the ¹ RP, iii. 415–53; Annales, 252–87; Usk, 62–71; HVRS, 157–160. ² ‘Vir dominabitur populo.’ Cf. I Samuel 9:17. The Vulgate actually gives ‘Ecce vir quem dixeram tibi; iste dominabitur populo meo’ (‘Behold the man whom I told you of; this one shall rule my people’). ³ RP, iii. 423. ⁴ Richard was born at Bordeaux on 6 January 1367 (ODNB, ‘Richard II’). The accepted dating of Henry’s birth to April 1366 does not seem to be correct (Kirby 1970: 11; GEC, vii. 417). This date is based on gifts of sovereigns to the poor on Maundy Thursday, traditionally one for each year of his life. This evidence is contradictory, however, suggesting both a birthday between 4 and 11 April 1366 and between 9 April 1367 and 8 April 1368. The Issue Roll for 1367 records a payment on 1 June to the messenger who brought news of Henry’s birth to Edward III. It seems reasonable to accept 16 March 1367, the date given by a late ﬁfteenth-century redaction of John Somer’s chronicle. See Issues of the Exchequer, ed. F. Devon (London, 1837), 191; Somer, 275.\n\n2\n\nRichard II\n\nvirtues of men led Thomas Arundel to a set of associations which might surprise a modern reader. The archbishop subdivided his theme using a passage from St Paul’s ﬁrst letter to the Corinthians: ‘When I was a child I used to speak as a child, understand (sapiebam) as a child, think as a child.’⁵ He expanded the three parts of this text to show just what he meant when he said that Richard was a boy, whereas Henry was a man.⁶ First, Arundel asserted that a child was inconstant in speech, easily saying true things and easily saying false things. A child easily promised with a word, but what was promised was quickly forgotten. Under the rule of Richard II, these things had been very irksome to the kingdom. It was not possible for the realm to stand easily where such circumstances reigned. The archbishop then claimed that ‘the kingdom is liberated from these weaknesses when a man (vir) rules, for it pertains to a man to keep guard on his tongue.’ Now it was not a boy who ruled but a man. Then, as his second distinction, Arundel considered the passage ‘sapiebam ut parvulus’ (‘I understood as a child’), using ‘sapere’ in the sense in which it invokes taste and discernment as well as ‘understanding’. He argued that Richard had a taste for, or understood (sapit), only pleasing things and ﬂattery. The child hated the one who reveals truth. This was how Richard had ruled, having no taste for wisdom. Henry, on the other hand, held like a man to truth. Finally, the archbishop asserted that Richard had ruled wilfully, which he opposed to the rule of reason: ‘For the child alone takes care to do all things wilfully, not out of reason. So when a boy rules, will alone rules, reason is an exile.’ From the lack of reason and the rule of wilfulness, Arundel proceeded to constancy, asserting that: ‘Truly where will reigns and reason has withdrawn, constancy (constantia) has ﬂed, and so great peril threatens.’ Now, though, a man had arrived, who had been completed by reason, who said ‘I came not to do my will but that of he who sent me, namely God.’ This man not only lived in wisdom and reﬂected in his understanding ‘as a man not a boy’, but also looked for the will of God in everything rather than his own will. ‘And so in the place of the playful will of the boy a man now rules the people.’ ⁵ I Cor xiii.11: ‘Cum essem parvulus loquebar ut parvulus, sapiebam ut parvulus, cogitabam ut parvulus.’ ⁶ It is clear that these faults are ascribed to Richard, not the earl of March, one of Henry’s other potential rivals who really was a child, as suggested by e.g. Keen 2003: 242. Archbishop Arundel locates the faults of youthful government in Richard’s reign, from which the kingdom is delivered by Henry’s arrival.\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nThomas Arundel’s sermon was to be tremendously inﬂuential in establishing the future reputation of Richard II.⁷ Its notoriety was immediate. The chronicles of St Albans abbey, Adam of Usk, and the Eulogium continuator all mention it, citing the archbishop’s scriptural theme although not giving the full text.⁸ The document known as ‘The Manner of King Richard’s Renunciation’ states that it concerned ‘the way in which a king ought to live and govern his people and kingdom, and upon what pertained to the government (governaile) of a king.’⁹ The archbishop himself repeated it in summarized form a week later, at the opening of Henry IV’s ﬁrst parliament. On that occasion, Arundel asserted that he had earlier shown how England had been the most prosperous corner of riches in all the world; but then it was ‘for a long time directed, ruled and governed by children, and by the counsel of widows’. He said that the kingdom would have been lost, had not God in his wisdom placed ‘a wise and prudent man for the governance of the same kingdom’ who knew how to be governed and counselled.¹⁰ Similar themes were invoked around the same time in a number of texts to which we shall return below, notably a revised version of John Gower’s Vox Clamantis, an obituary of the king in the chronicle of Evesham abbey, and an alliterative poem criticizing the mores of the political class in general and of Richard II in particular, known today as Richard the Redeless. These texts argued with varying emphases that Richard was inconstant in speech; that he was wilful, which meant that he followed worldly pleasures and his own impulses instead of reason and the will of God; that he followed the counsel of youths; and that he himself was either unmanly or (in one case) feminine in physical appearance and morality. Whether or not these works were directly inspired by Thomas Arundel’s sermon, they nonetheless demonstrate the resonance of his words for his contemporaries. What was it that made these themes so powerful? It would be unwise to assume that Archbishop Arundel chose these themes simply because they seemed a fair description of the character of the king. That we cannot take the archbishop’s remarks at face value has been made clear in recent years by literary scholars who have begun to explore some of the complex gendered undercurrents of this text.¹¹ ⁷ ⁸ ⁹ ¹¹\n\nFor this reputation from the Tudor period, see Aston 1971. Annales, 281; Usk, 68; Eulogium, 384. Sayles 1981: 266–70. ¹⁰ RP, iii. 415. Rubey 1998; Goldberg, Riddy, and Tyler 2004.\n\n4\n\nRichard II\n\nDiscussing Arundel’s portrayal of Richard II as a boy, Felicity Riddy notes how ‘inconstancy and deceit are tropes of misogynistic discourse’ and argues that ‘in the archbishop’s sermon ‘‘boy’’ and ‘‘woman’’ are explicitly conﬂated and are together opposed to manliness’. She goes on to suggest that this is an attack on ‘the style of the court—what might be termed its ‘‘youth culture’’ ’, which involved ‘extravagant spending on fashion and luxury items, as well as what looked to outsiders like outrageous sexual mores’.¹² She argues that this court style need not be portrayed negatively, and picks out the Wilton Diptych, which was created for the king in the mid-1390s, as an alternative, positive portrayal of courtly youth and magniﬁcence.¹³ In a separate analysis, Daniel Rubey has argued that the archbishop’s remarks are an attempt to use ‘the language of gender and antifeminism to attack [Richard’s] masculinity and that of his court’.¹⁴ For Rubey, it is primarily ‘Richard’s new peace policy’ which motivated this attack, not the ‘supposedly unmilitary, pleasure-seeking behaviour’ of the court.¹⁵ The ‘attack by his enemies on Richard’s manhood’ is a means to resist ‘a shift away from the feudal politics of the Appellants [Richard’s noble opponents] to a more diplomatically-based and sophisticated international policy’ and to ‘greater centralization of political and economic power’. Rubey interprets Arundel’s sermon primarily in terms of patriarchy and the transmission of inheritance. He reads it as an older generation which favoured war and the vigorous pursuit of the king’s claims in France ‘punishing the bad son who had not submitted to the law of the father and had not become a man according to their rules’. He in turn relates this to the clash—which he ﬁnds also in Chaucer’s Tale of Melibee —between two different conceptions of masculinity: ‘an aristocratic patriarchal masculinity involving the production of children and heirs, and a celibate clerical masculinity’.¹⁶ In presenting these analyses, Riddy and Rubey develop themes which have attracted increasing scholarly attention as part of the emerging ﬁeld of the history of masculinity. An expanding body of work has developed in recent years around the fundamental insight that masculinity or manhood is never a simple given—the automatic concomitant of the possession of male sex—but a culturally constructed status which may be distributed in greater and lesser degree amongst different men. So far, ¹² Rubey 1998; Goldberg, Riddy, and Tyler 2004: 5. ¹³ For the Wilton Diptych, see below, Ch. 12, ﬁg. 1 and discussion, pp. 258–262. ¹⁴ Rubey 1998: 167. ¹⁵ Ibid., 161, 164. ¹⁶ Ibid., 165–6.\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nresearch has tended to cluster around three broad approaches. The ﬁrst of these draws more or less directly on the psychoanalytic proposition that adult males need to engage in sexual activity in order to demonstrate that they are indeed men. Following this approach, a number of writers have considered the social and psychological consequences of celibacy for the clergy,¹⁷ whilst others have emphasized particular moments at which clerical and lay ideals of male behaviour produced tension.¹⁸ The second approach draws less on psychoanalysis than on the work of the sociologist R. W. Connell.¹⁹ It makes use of her suggestion that it might be possible to analyse men, just as Simone de Beauvoir did with women, in terms of certain gendered ‘types’, male ‘ways of life’, or even speciﬁcally male ‘cultures’.²⁰ This has enabled writers to develop the feminist notion of patriarchy in historical context, considering the differing forms that paternal authority took in varying social circumstances, and how it was reproduced from generation to generation.²¹ Drawing on the work of anthropologist David Gilmore, historians have turned to the processes by which young males might be admitted to the full status of a ‘man’ within their social group, and how socio-economic or political circumstances might block that progression, creating eternal ‘youths’.²² Finally, a third pole of research has developed around the analysis of gendered ideologies and symbolic structures. Ideologies of sex difference found in medical theory, for example, have come in for detailed and revealing analysis, and literary critics and historians have produced a mountain of work which elucidates gendered discourses in particular medieval texts and genres.²³ ¹⁷ e.g. McNamara 1994: 8; McNamara 1999; Swanson 1999. ¹⁸ Nelson 1999; Leyser 1999: esp. 104–5; Balzaretti 1999: esp. 145; Coakley 1994. ¹⁹ Connell 1995; Connell 1987: 175–88. See also Tosh 1994. Medievalists have not made as much use as writers on later periods of Connell’s argument that one such masculinity can be seen as ‘hegemonic’, that it dominates and subjects the others, perhaps because of the development of research in terms of an opposition between two culturally valued masculinities, the clerical and the lay aristocratic. See esp. Cullum and Lewis 2004. ²⁰ M. Bennett 1999; Dunlop 2001; Karras 1997; Karras 2003. ²¹ Stuard 1994; Chojnacki 1994. ²² Gilmore 1990. Cf. Goldberg 1999; Aird 1999. ²³ On the medical theory of manhood, see Bullough 1994; Cadden 1993; Jacquart and Thomasset 1988, and below, Ch. 4. The work of literary critics on such themes has been vast, but see e.g. Bloch 1991; Clover 1993; Kay 1995; Gaunt 1995; Blamires 2003, and the essays in Beidler 1998; Cohen and Wheeler 1997; the essays by Kinney, Lees, Baswell, and Mirrer in Lees 1994; and by Chinca, Ailes, and Haseldine in Hadley 1999.\n\n6\n\nRichard II\n\nCombining these three approaches, Felicity Riddy and Daniel Rubey interpret Thomas Arundel’s sermon as an attack on the alternative male subculture of Richard II and his court. They see this as a clash of generations, a negotiation over the transference of patriarchal power from the old to the young in which the former seek to deﬁne what proper masculinity ought to be. In the process, Riddy and Rubey draw welcome attention to the gendered dimension of Arundel’s rhetoric, the way it related to broader structures of ideas which opposed manhood not only to boyhood but also to femininity. But their analyses also suffer from a number of important drawbacks. To begin with, interpreting Archbishop Arundel’s sermon as part of a conﬂict between competing masculinities seems to place undue stress on certain aspects of his attack on the king at the expense of wider associations which seem more prominent. Although some of the characteristics which Arundel ascribes to boys were also ascribed to women in misogynist discourse, women and effeminacy at ﬁrst seem largely peripheral to a central attack in terms of Richard’s alleged failure to pass from the status of a ‘boy’ to that of a ‘man’. Although Arundel undoubtedly makes use of gendered themes, his conﬂation of youth and women is an implicit one whose origins and internal logic invite further investigation. Moreover, it is far from clear on the basis of this text alone that the archbishop was attacking those aspects of Richard’s rule—especially in foreign policy and the character of his court—which Riddy and Rubey see invoked by his references to boyhood and manhood. The archbishop makes no mention of war, nor of conspicuous expenditure, and not even of inheritance. Although it would seem correct to say that many of the issues which scholars have begun to analyse as part of the history of masculinity are relevant to this text, and behind it to the politics of Richard II’s reign, it remains to be established whether these are the most important aspects of either Arundel’s sermon or the political situation on which it draws. This leads on to a second set of problems related to the question of determining why exactly the archbishop chose to make use of the rhetorical themes of manhood and youth. Taking a gendered approach, although it helps to reveal the complexity of the themes which Richard’s critics used, still does not resolve the problem of ascertaining whether the king really did behave in the way that his enemies suggested that he did. The tendency is simply to place a positive interpretation on Richard’s unmanliness, reclaiming it in the name of a subversive masculinity or\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nan alternative youth culture. This begs a number of questions about the relationship of these texts to reality. Was it because there were aspects of Richard’s comportment which could easily be portrayed in this way that his critics chose to attack him in these terms? Or were these strategies just convenient slurs, happened upon opportunistically at the moment of his deposition? Or, again, was there something else going on in the politics of these years which made these themes seem relevant? To be able to discover what the relationship was between Richard’s unmanly reputation and the realities of late fourteenth century politics, we need to establish which aspects of the former are the simple product of rhetorical attacks upon him and which are plausible interpretations of real contemporary controversies. Did Richard’s critics judge harshly his foreign policy, for example, or his courtly style, because these did not correspond with their own ideas of appropriate adult male behaviour? Or was the ‘language of gender and antifeminism’ only mobilized ‘to attack [Richard’s] masculinity and that of his court’ after the king had been judged wanting for other reasons? Was Richard’s masculinity really at issue, or was it simply a rhetoric mobilized in disputes with different origins? For answers to these questions, it at ﬁrst seems natural to turn to the writings of historians on the politics of this period, to ﬁnd out what exactly lay behind these accusations in the political controversies of the late fourteenth century. Unfortunately, this method of proceeding soon reveals its own drawbacks, and above all a risk of circularity. Historical interpretations of the reign of Richard II have for centuries been more or less consciously inﬂuenced by this king’s unmanly reputation. Since at least the sixteenth century, he has habitually been associated with lavish courtly expenditure, absolutist ideas, Francophile tendencies, and a principled love of peace, all of which were, until relatively recently, unselfconsciously linked to the king’s observable unmanliness. Before the late 1960s and early 1970s, when a number of writers sounded the alarm, historians had no doubt that the signiﬁcance of manhood, boyhood, and youth at Richard’s deposition arose from the objective reality of the effeminate character of the king.²⁴ Each new account of the reign adapted the king’s established legend to the historical ²⁴ For comment, see Aston 1971, 310; Jones 1968: 113–18. For a sympathetic version of this view of Richard II in the eighteenth century see e.g. Historia vitae et regni Ricardi II, ed. T. Hearne (London, 1729), vii; Fisher 1965: 23. For negative ninteenthcentury views, see e.g. Webb 1824: 101–2; Satirical Poems and Songs on Costume, ed. F. W. Fairholt (London, 1849), 43–8; Stubbs 1883: ii. 498, 508–9, 512, 484.\n\n8\n\nRichard II\n\napproach in vogue at the time of writing. Anthony Steel, for example, in his 1941 biography of the king, ﬁtted Richard’s accepted character into the emerging psychological theories of his own day. Steel explained the events of Richard’s reign in terms of his inability to live up to the demands of noble male behaviour in general and of knighthood in particular.²⁵ Physically unable to follow the manly example of his father and grandfather, the king instead retreated from his subjects, compensating for his feelings of inferiority by violently asserting his regality.²⁶ Although this view did not go unchallenged, its critics shared many of Steel’s assumptions. Whilst V. H. Galbraith doubted the evidence for Richard’s physical incapacity, he nonetheless regarded the king as a ‘misﬁt in his own class’ whose ‘nice personal habits’ classed him as an outsider in the boys’ school of the historian’s imagination: ‘the non-cooperator, who hates rugger and cricket and refuses to shout on the touchline’.²⁷ Even in the revisionist accounts of Richard II’s reign which began to appear from the 1960s, scepticism about the origins of his reputation never quite led to its total abandonment. Instead a pattern was established in which certain aspects of the king’s traditional character were rejected, whilst those which corresponded better with the interpretation being advanced were retained. This tendency can be detected even in those accounts of the reign which attempted to present the king in a positive light. Gervase Mathew, for example, who portrayed the king in more approving terms than Steel had done, nonetheless thought of Richard’s court as marking a fundamental break with ‘the masculinity of the earlier Curia Regis’, believing it to be characterized by an ideal court manhood which was ‘perpetually adolescent and perhaps slightly epicene’.²⁸ Although, in another revisionist work, R. H. Jones preferred to dismiss the foppish aspects of Richard’s reputation whilst retaining his association with absolutist ideas, his objections to the accepted picture were soon lost in the process of reception. In the end, most historians discarded Jones’s objections to Steel whilst adopting his comments on Richard’s ‘high royalist notions’ and the inﬂuence of the De Regimine Principum of Giles of Rome.²⁹ It was still normal to assert that ‘[b]y inclination [Richard] was an artist rather than a warrior’,³⁰ or that ‘with his highly developed aesthetic sense and love of reﬁnement’ he could ²⁵ Steel 1941: 8. ²⁶ Ibid., 41–2, 113, 174–5, 225, 252, 278–9. ²⁷ Galbraith 1942: 227, 226. ²⁸ Mathew 1968: 1–3, 11–12, 25. ²⁹ Jones 1968: 113–18, 128–43, 155. ³⁰ Hollister 1992: 227.\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nnot share his interests with his barons.³¹ The rupture between Richard and his nobility continued to be seen as the rejection of a reﬁned courtly effeminate by a warlike nobility who thirsted for a renewal of the glories of Edward III’s day. Despite the warnings of Margaret Aston against accepting in ‘attenuated form’ the Tudor portrayal of Richard II as an eternally youthful, courtly fop,³² and despite the optimism of G. O. Sayles that archival research would serve to dispel this well-established picture,³³ the publication of a raft of empirical studies in the early 1970s did surprisingly little to disturb received ideas about the king’s character and preferences. Although studies by J. J. N. Palmer, Anthony Goodman, and Anthony Tuck moved the centre of debate away from the character of the king and towards foreign policy and the king’s relations with his nobility, they nonetheless continued to make use of central aspects of Richard’s long-accepted reputation to support their innovative theses. Although Palmer began his work on Anglo-French diplomacy partly in order to dislodge the view of Richard II as a craven Francophile, and to re-evaluate the peace policies of his reign as a rational response to contemporary circumstances, he continued to regard the king’s enthusiasm for peace as ‘too well-known to require comment’.³⁴ Although Goodman’s research focused on the material interests of particular nobles, he was ultimately obliged to explain their resistance to Richard’s rule by their revulsion to his pursuit of peace, since their ﬁnancial circumstances were too varied to fully account for their discontent.³⁵ Even as Anthony Tuck constructed a new interpretation of the reign which was focused on patronage, he, too, continued to draw on Richard’s reputation for an aversion to warfare and an obsession with courtly culture. The accepted character of the Ricardian court could be used to explain repeated requests for war taxation as rhetorical gambits to secure resources for other ends, such as the expansion of the royal household and the promotion of the king’s associates.³⁶ The grant to Robert de Vere of the duchy of Ireland, for example, or the promotion of Sir Simon Burley’s position ³¹ Barber 1978: 238. ³² Aston 1971: 316–17. ³³ For this hope see Sayles 1971; Sayles 1979. ³⁴ Palmer 1971b; Palmer 1971c; Palmer 1972.

For their supposedly shared distaste for the king’s alleged policy of peace, see ibid., 77, 87–90, 94, 104, 105, 114, 121. ³⁶ Tuck 1973: 61–2, 63–5, 90–1, 99, 102, 104–5. Although cf. ibid., 73, in which Tuck notes Richard’s use of his own estates as military recruiting grounds.\n\n10\n\nRichard II\n\nin Kent, could be portrayed simply as proﬂigate patronage to favourites, rather than as the distribution of resources needed to fulﬁl particular military and administrative functions.³⁷ Finally, the persistence of instability after the problems of patronage had been resolved in the late 1380s could be explained by the king’s peaceful instincts, which aroused the opposition of a warlike nobility and gentry.³⁸ Each of these new accounts of Richard II’s reign thus drew on different aspects of the time-honoured model of the king’s character even as they challenged particular elements of it. The traditional model of Richard’s character and preferences has not been displaced by work which stresses the king’s attitude to the property rights of his subjects,³⁹ nor by accounts of this reign which locate his faults in his retaining policies, his intervention in the localities or his attitude to the nobility.⁴⁰ In these accounts, it is still necessary to explain why Richard behaved in the disruptive way that he did, how he came to maintain and to pursue with such vigour the ‘misconceptions about the crown’s authority and his own role in the polity’ which led him to undermine the natural consensus between the king and nobility.⁴¹ A crisis at the centre is required not only to explain the misuse of royal authority in local affairs but also to provide the occasion for the accumulation of local grievances to be expressed on the national stage. So far, no better explanation has been found than the king’s perverse political ideas and a fundamental clash between the personalities and values of the nobility and the personality and priorities of the king. Once again, these accounts draw more or less directly on the tradition of the fundamentally unsympathetic and unmilitary character of a courtly and absolutist king. Recent work on the Ricardian court has returned with some enthusiasm to R. H. Jones’s views of Richard II’s ideas of kingship and to Gervase Mathew’s picture of his court. Many writers still draw a strong link between the king’s courtly character—the picture of a wilful, despotic, unchivalric Richard II—and his attitude to his subjects’ ³⁷ Tuck 1973: 74–86, esp. 75, 82. ³⁸ Ibid., ch. 6. Although both Tuck and Goodman are aware of the limitations of the continental sources which portray Richard as a martyr king and those who displaced him as unprincipled warmongers, they accept them nonetheless. See ibid., 155–86; Goodman 1971: 74–86. A similar approach is taken by Saul 1997a: 370–3.

The image of the king’s absolutism remains so tied up with his unusual love of clothes and ceremonial that his absolutist views of kingship have been associated with such disparate aspects of courtly culture as the clothing of his courtiers or his use of handkerchiefs.⁴² Even those historians who view Richard in a sympathetic light still retain the traditional picture of a king who was unusually attached to clothing, art, and ceremonial, temperamentally opposed to war with France and committed to extreme views of his ofﬁce.⁴³ It is thus in keeping with the dominant thrust of writing on Richard II in the late twentieth century that the most recent full-scale work on his reign should strongly link the king’s physical unmanliness with his courtly self-presentation, his ideas of kingship, his foreign policy, and his eventual downfall. Nigel Saul’s 1997 biography deals in its concluding chapter with Richard’s alleged effeminacy in the course of an examination of his courtly ideals. Saul tentatively suggests that the reason behind the apparent opinion of contemporaries that the king was ‘slightly epicene’ might have been ‘that the chroniclers were measuring him against the manliness of his father, who, in his prime, had been an exceptionally vigorous man’.⁴⁴ For Saul, this view ﬁts well with the adoption of ideas similar to those of R. H. Jones. In the use of terms such as ‘majesty’ and ‘prince’ in petitions addressed to the king, Saul detects a concern with ‘sovereignty’, ‘distance’, and ‘obedience’ derived from civil law and Giles of Rome.⁴⁵ Saul also adopts the picture of a fundamentally unmilitary king, who preferred to observe the tourney at a distance rather than get his hands dirty, as it were, as his father or grandfather had done.⁴⁶ This, as in the work of Steel, is attached to a full psychological diagnosis. Richard II’s failure is explained by a ‘narcissistic’ personality which craved praise and attention, and ended by becoming totally detached from reality.⁴⁷ His fall is still the removal by a warlike political class of a wanton young effeminate who combined unmanly courtly interests with disturbing absolutist principles to an extent which bordered on madness.⁴⁸ ⁴² Eberle 1985; Stow 1995. ⁴³ Barron 1985: 36; Barron 1990: 132–49; Barron, 1993: 16. ⁴⁴ Saul, 1997a: 452. ⁴⁵ Saul 1995; Saul 1997a: 93, 119, 248–50, 384–388, 441–5, 453; Saul 1999a.

McHardy 2000: 19.\n\n12\n\nRichard II\n\nOver the years, Richard II’s unmanly character has provided the cement with which historians have ﬁlled the gaps in their interpretations of his reign. It has rarely been the central means of explaining events, but it has almost always made some sort of contribution. It has provided a way of making the king seem more real, more concrete as a personality, explaining his actions in a satisfyingly straightforward fashion. In a period where it is rarely possible to know what exactly anyone was thinking, in the absence of informal letter collections or autobiographic writing, this picture of the king provides a way of giving life to chronicle accounts and documentary sources, and of making the king come alive, a familiar ﬁgure whose actions can be readily understood. Yet even before the contemporary evidence for Richard’s reputation is considered in detail, there is reason to doubt the validity of this familiar picture. For example, how unusual were Richard II’s ideas of kingship? The work of Simon Walker has suggested that the king’s political ideas lay within the broad spread of contemporary orthodoxy, even if he subscribed to an extreme interpretation of widely held ideals.⁴⁹ It is increasingly clear that the ideas of Giles of Rome were as widely spread and as subject to varying interpretations in late medieval England, as were the maxims of Roman law.⁵⁰ The Appellant duke of Gloucester, as much as Richard’s tutor, Sir Simon Burley, possessed a copy of De Regimine Principum, the wide circulation of which is evidenced today by an exceptionally large number of manuscript survivals.⁵¹ Nor is this tract any longer regarded as straightforwardly absolutist. Recent studies of Giles’s work have stressed how the doctrines of counsel, and of the subjugation of the king’s aims to the common good, are to be found alongside his insistence on obedience to the king—itself scarcely a controversial doctrine in a monarchical society.⁵² The second touchstone of ‘Ricardian kingship’, meanwhile, the unusual splendour and extravagance of his court, has also been subject to re-assessment. Since the 1980s, scholars have revealed that Richard II’s predecessors were at least his equals in their performance of the kingly virtue ⁴⁹ Walker 1995: 50–7, 60–2. ⁵⁰ Briggs 1999, 3 and appendix A. On civil law in England see e.g. Bellamy 1970: 6–7; Plucknett 1939. ⁵¹ Dillon and St John Hope 1897: 302; Scattergood 1968; Jones 1968: 143; Goodman 1971: 81. ⁵² Contrast the views of Giles presented by Berges 1938: 211–28; Jones 1968: 142–3, 155–6 with the reading of Kempshall 1999: ch. 5.\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nof ‘magniﬁcence’.⁵³ It has become clear that complaints about the household were not proportional to absolute expenditure, but to the king’s ability to meet his debts.⁵⁴ Indeed, complaints came thickest during the 1380s, when expenditure was restrained, and then faded away even as wardrobe expenditure increased from the early 1390s.⁵⁵ Finally, even the question of the king’s attitude to war and chivalric activity has come under renewed examination. G. B. Stow’s archival work has shown that accusations of the king’s distaste for hunting, for example, are unfounded.⁵⁶ A number of writers, notably J. L. Gillespie and Anne Curry, have drawn attention to Richard’s enthusiasm for warfare in Scotland in 1385 and in Ireland in the 1390s,⁵⁷ and others, including Anthony Tuck, have come to doubt that he was committed to peace with France for its own sake.⁵⁸ One historian of Anglo-French foreign policy has even suggested that the abandonment of a plan for a ﬁnal peace with France was the result of Richard becoming interested in diplomacy for the ﬁrst time, after about 1392, at the very time when a ﬁnal settlement began to seem less likely.⁵⁹ Evidence of purchases of armour for the king’s participation in tourney or on campaign seem difﬁcult to square with Nigel Saul’s view of Richard’s desire for ‘distance’, as do chronicle references to the king winning tournament honours.⁶⁰ What then are we to make of Richard II’s unmanly reputation, so often contested and yet never entirely superseded? Although a body of research has accumulated over the past forty years or so which ought to give serious cause for concern about the established reputation of Richard II, it has nonetheless proved surprisingly resistant to attack. Perhaps the most important reason for this state of affairs is that Richard’s unmanly reputation is not simply the product of each age projecting onto him whatever faults they wished to condemn in their own time, nor is it solely a testament to the seductive power of a well-established orthodoxy. Richard’s reputation does have a certain kind of basis in late fourteenth-century texts and images, although ⁵³ Sherborne 1983: 182–4; Staniland 1997.

We can form a clearer impression of the issues which Richard’s critics found the most important by turning to a number of texts, brieﬂy alluded to above, which invoke both Thomas Arundel’s concerns, and certain overlapping issues which he does not directly discuss. After setting out the full range of the themes they invoked—from the king’s inconstant complexion to his susceptibility to youthful advice—it should be possible to begin to assess what lay behind these themes in the politics of Richard II’s reign. ∗ The only contemporary writer who describes Richard II as feminine is the chronicler of Evesham abbey. The passage in question must date from after the king’s fall, since it takes the form of an obituary. The chronicler begins by noting that King Richard was of common stature.⁶¹ This is not an altogether propitious start, given that the excavation of his bones in the nineteenth century revealed him to have been a tall man for his day, perhaps some six foot tall.⁶² The chronicler then states that the king ‘had fair hair, a white, rounded and feminine face, occasionally corrupted with phlegmatic humour’.⁶³ At ﬁrst this appears to be a physical judgement, a conﬁrmation of the objective reality of Richard’s effeminacy. However, it is soon clear that there is more to it than that, since the colourless lack of form of the king’s face allows it to be corrupted by the arrival of phlegmatic (that is, cold and wet) humour. This passage has been translated in the past as ‘a rounded feminine face which sometimes ﬂushed’.⁶⁴ For contemporaries, however, there was far more to a man’s ‘complexion’ than his skin colour, since it indicated also his personality and bodily constitution.⁶⁵ This description raises the possibility of an inconstant and wilful personality, not just red cheeks. This suspicion is conﬁrmed when the chronicler goes on to note that the king’s tongue was ‘short and stuttering’, that he was ‘inconstant in ⁶¹ HVRS, 166. ⁶² Stanley 1880: 323; Galbraith 1942: 226. ⁶³ HVRS, 166: ‘Inerant enim ei crines glauci facies alba et rotunda et feminia, interdum sanguinis ﬂeumatice uiciata . . .’. ⁶⁴ Chronicles, 241. ⁶⁵ See Rigby 1996: 7–9 and below, Ch. 4.\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nhis mores’ and that this was because ‘scorning the counsel of the old nobles, he adhered to young men’.⁶⁶ The consequences of this bad counsel become clear as the chronicler relates how the king was ‘extravagant in his gifts, splendid beyond measure (ultra modum) in entertainments and garments’. This seems to lead naturally to the remark that Richard was ‘luckless and timid in wars against enemies, directing his anger against his own people (domesticos)’.⁶⁷ Haughty in pride, occupied by cupidity, he was much devoted to the sin of intemperance, of luxuria. He sometimes stayed up until the night sometimes until the morning, ‘in drinking and in other unmentionable things’. In the passage which follows this description, the consequences for the kingdom are made clear, for Richard’s sins led him to impose crushing taxes on the people throughout the reign, ‘yet when, under the pretext of defeating the enemy, he had acquired enormous wealth to the crown, it was all spent on his foolish wantonness’.⁶⁸ Thus from a ‘feminine’ appearance the chronicler passes on to the youthful, inconstant mores of the king which meant that heavy taxes were not translated into military victory. Some commentators have located the origins of this portrayal of Richard II in the king’s physical constitution, whilst others have doubted the truth of this account of his bodily capacities.⁶⁹ This makes it important to consider whether the Evesham chronicler’s description of the king as ‘feminine’ in appearance was a simple observation of fact, or at least a fair comment on his observable appearance. In his recent biography of the king, Nigel Saul usefully brings together much of the visual material which has contributed to the king’s reputation, and which provide the source for Richard’s physical incapacity cited by Steel.⁷⁰ Saul begins by suggesting that in Richard’s funeral efﬁgy he is depicted with ‘striking, but slightly feminine, features’.⁷¹ He notes the high cheekbones; the long, straight nose; the large, heavy-lidded eyes; and the suggestion of a goatee beard. Saul ﬁnds ‘the same youthful-looking but slightly feminine features’ in a portrait in Westminster Abbey.⁷² Finally, in a number of ⁶⁶ HVRS, 166: ‘lingua breuis et balbuciens, moribus inconstans, quia, spreto antiquorum procerum consilio, iuuenibus adherebat, magis eorum quam illorum consilium sequens.’ ⁶⁷ Ibid.: ‘. . . ad bella contra hostes infortunatus et timidus, in domesticos iram multum attendens . . .’. ⁶⁸ Ibid., 167. ⁶⁹ See e.g. Steel 1941: 41; Galbraith 1942: 226. ⁷⁰ Saul 1997a: 449–453. Cf. Steel 1941: 41. ⁷¹ Saul 1997a: 450. Cf. ibid., plate 20. ⁷² Saul 1997a: 451.\n\n16\n\nRichard II\n\nmanuscript illuminations, Saul notes the same long nose and large eyelids, and the fact that Richard’s hair is shown as much longer, although he does not make any reference to ‘feminine’ characteristics.⁷³ Moving on to the Wilton Diptych, which was probably completed in the mid1390s, Saul ascribes Richard’s lack of a beard to ‘an idealized likeness’, perhaps aiming to gloss over the age difference involved in his forthcoming marriage to Isabel of France by depicting him with ‘boyish looks’.⁷⁴ Yet the conclusion drawn—that Richard was considered to be ‘slightly epicene’ by his contemporaries—provides no evidence of Richard II’s ‘feminine’ appearance as judged at the time, based as it is solely on a modern historian’s standards as to what constitutes a feminine appearance.⁷⁵ Indeed, even within the limits imposed by this impressionistic method, only two out of seven representations are found to be ‘slightly feminine’, although it might be assumed that the Wilton Diptych would share in this categorization if it were admitted as evidence. The assessment of Richard’s ‘feminine’ appearance is made all the more insecure by the fact that one of these representations—the Westminster portrait—has itself been subjected to centuries of insensitive restoration.⁷⁶ As a photograph taken at the time of one major restoration in 1866 makes clear, the portrait was by then very indistinct.⁷⁷ In completing their work, the restorers gave the king red cheeks, full lips, and a ﬁne, pointed beard. Yet when the present portrait is viewed under infra-red reﬂectography, it becomes clear that although the thin nose and heavy-lidded eyes were indeed present in the original portrait, the king’s beard covered both chin and cheeks, not just the edge of the chin. It was altogether fuller than the goatee now in evidence. The line of the king’s jaw is more deﬁned, the lips are less full, and there is no particular reason to believe that the cheeks would have been red. Successive restorers have, in effect, corrected the portrait to ﬁt the established reputation of the king. Contemporary portraits of Richard II do not make it possible to assert that the king’s physical appearance made it self-evident to his contemporaries that he was something less than a man. The impression that the origins of this accusation lie somewhere quite different is reinforced by a number of texts which ascribe him youthful mores, or allege a love of ﬂeshly pleasure and youthful counsel, but do not link these troublesome tendencies to any physical attribute. Richard ⁷³ Saul 1997a: 451 and plates 12, 15. ⁷⁴ Ibid., 451 and below, Ch. 12, nn. 51–2. ⁷⁵ Saul 1997a: 450–1. ⁷⁶ Alexander 1997: 197–206. ⁷⁷ Ibid., image 16.\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nthe Redeless, another work produced just after Richard’s fall, berates the faults of youthful counsel with an eye to instructing the king’s successors.⁷⁸ This text attacks wilfulness and the love of the ﬂesh which guides men away from reason in their youth, and causes them to value outward appearances, showy dress, and pleasing words more than the truth.⁷⁹ The way to avoid these errors, and the addiction to the world which leads a king to attempt to rule by might when he should only rule by love, is to take good counsel: not, that is, the ‘foure score and odde’ faults that youth ‘weneth alwey that it be witt euere’, but rather the counsel of mature men, who carefully consider each matter to construe its truth.⁸⁰ Clearly, the accusation runs, Richard failed to do this. The pleasure-obsessed wilfulness of his courtiers’ clothing is but a function of the king’s own unruliness (‘Now Richard the redeless reweth on you-self,/That lawlesse leddyn youre lyf and youre peple bothe . . .’).⁸¹ His reign was the rule of riotous, uncontrolled young men, or men spoiled in their youth, who concern themselves only with their clothes in order to attract political favour, along with the favours of ladies.⁸² Reading Richard the Redeless strengthens the impression that the king’s critics associated him with the faults of youth, not because he had a particularly youthful appearance or bearing, but because youth invoked a certain set of political vices which his enemies wished to ascribe to him. Similar themes were also invoked by the poet and moralist John Gower in certain modiﬁcations which he made to his complaint work Vox Clamantis to express displeasure with Richard’s rule. There are a number of reasons for dating these revisions, also, to around Richard’s deposition, rather than to about 1393 as previously believed.⁸³ Gower ⁷⁸ RR, I. 43–6. For readings of Richard the Redeless which see it as a critique of real excesses in clothing at Richard’s court, see Stow 1995: 235; Eberle 1985. Castor 2000: 9–15 focuses on the attack on livery and retaining. For accounts which concentrate on the poem’s general lessons about kingship, see Barr 1992; Middleton 1978; Ferguson 1955; Mohl 1944. ⁷⁹ RR, I. 50–2, 83, 87, 92, 101; II. 112–18; III. 116–25, 173–81; Fletcher 2005: 6; Fletcher 2006: 36. ⁸⁰ RR, I. 66–9. ⁸¹ Ibid., 88–9. ⁸² RR, III. 156–9. ⁸³ The interpolation ends by declaring that Richard’s fate arises out of wrongdoing, and although a remarkable prescience on Gower’s part is not impossible, it seems likely that he was availing himself of a convenient tactic for a political prophet, conﬁdently predicting events which had already come to pass. Moreover, in all four manuscripts where the revisions have been made, the Vox Clamantis has appended to it the Cronica Tripertita, Gower’s vitriolic attack on Richard II’s rule and justiﬁcation of the 1399 coup, together with a number of other poems in favour of Henry IV’s regime. One of these manuscripts was even given, after 1399, to Archbishop Arundel, with an epistle\n\n18\n\nRichard II\n\nbegins his interpolation by asserting that the king ‘an undisciplined boy, neglects the moral behaviour by which a man might grow up from a boy’.⁸⁴ He proclaims that ‘youthful company (iuuenilis concio) so guides the boy (puerum) that he has taste (sapit) for nothing useful, unless it be his whim’.⁸⁵ It seems likely that Gower is explicitly drawing on Thomas Arundel’s sermon in this passage. He seems to elaborate upon it, declaring that the youths (iuuenes) associated with the king simply follow any course of action that he chooses.⁸⁶ These vain youths cultivate vain honour.⁸⁷ They abet the king in his boyish mores, whereby he wields the authority of virtue the less.⁸⁸ Even older men tolerate many scandals ‘at the boy’s pleasure’ (pueri placitum) on account of their cupidity.⁸⁹ The virtuous withdraw, and the vicious come in, and the king’s court teems with vice.⁹⁰ Sin springs up on every side of the boy, and he, who is easily led, takes on every evil.⁹¹ To boys this is simply glorious sport, not wrongdoing, ‘but his fate does arise out of wrongdoing’.⁹² Thus Gower alleges that the boy king’s refusal to follow moral behaviour prevents him growing into a man. This extended boyish morality is, according to Gower, the consequence of the king’s wilfulness. Once again, the fault of the king is to mistake worldly goods for the highest good, vain honour for true honour. The atmosphere of sin and vice presages the fall of the ludic boy king. Once again, it is the moral faults associated with youth which take centre stage, to such an extent that the king’s youthfulness is extended beyond its normal term. It seems that whatever the real character of Richard’s court, Gower is not so much describing a youth culture he found disreputable as using youth to organize a political critique, the origins of which are, as yet, unclear. Richard the Redeless and the revised Vox Clamantis were not the only post-deposition commentaries on the reign of Richard II to ascribe the king’s faults to his youth or his youthful counsellors. Recounting of dedication. See Gower, VC, lx–lxiv, 1–2. The 1393 date is only a suggestion on the basis of modiﬁcations omitting praise of Richard II which Gower explicitly dated to that year in some manuscripts of his Confessio Amantis. See e.g. The Major Latin Works of John Gower, trans. E. W. Stockton (Seattle, 1962), 13; Ferster 1996: 111. ⁸⁴ Gower, VC, bk. vi, ll. 555–6: ‘Rex, puer indoctus, morales negligit actus,/In quibus a puero crescere possit homo.’ ⁸⁵ Ibid., ll. 557–8: ‘Sic etenim puerum iuuenilis concio ducit,/Quod nichil expediens, sit nisi velle, sapit.’ ⁸⁶ Ibid., ll. 559–60. ⁸⁷ Ibid., ll. 561–2. ⁸⁸ Ibid., ll. 563–4. ⁸⁹ Ibid., ll. 565–6. ⁹⁰ Ibid., ll. 567–8. ⁹¹ Ibid., ll. 569–70. ⁹² Ibid., ll. 570–1: ‘set ei sors stat aborta doli.’\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nthe events of Henry IV’s coronation, Adam of Usk tells a fabulous story of how Richard had planned to raise the young earl of Kent to be king of Ireland on that very day, putting to death several of the leading men of the kingdom.⁹³ This leads him to reﬂect that Richard ‘with his youthful counsellors’ should be ﬁttingly compared to Rehoboam, son of Solomon, ‘who because he followed the counsel of youths, lost the kingdom of Israel’.⁹⁴ In a similar fashion, the St Albans chronicle, in his account of the parliament of September 1397, describes the Speaker, John Bussy, heaping excessive praise upon the king, showing ‘not human honours to the king, but divine ones’.⁹⁵ The ‘youthful king’ (rex iuvenis) does not repress these words as he should, but instead, ‘embracing honours and loving adulation’, he proceeds to seek vengeance against his enemies.⁹⁶ In these texts, the vices which Richard’s youthful counsellors promoted are focused on the vanity and susceptibility to ﬂattery which lead to pride, tyranny, and hence self-destruction. All of them allude to the faults of youth, not in order to attack an alternative masculinity or youth culture characteristic of the Ricardian court, but because youth’s associations served both to condemn certain political faults, and to present a satisfying moral story of how Richard’s fall came about through pride and evil counsel. It is perhaps worth pausing for a moment to consider how this broadening of focus beyond Thomas Arundel’s sermon has affected our perspective on the themes he deployed. Certainly, it seems fair to note that one writer at least found in the contrast between youth and manhood an occasion to remark on the former king’s timidity in war. Others, too, saw the allegedly youthful nature of his court as a reason to dwell on excesses of courtly display and expenditure. Yet, having admitted all that, these themes still seem largely peripheral to texts whose focus lies elsewhere. Instead, the central elements of these texts are the ethical and political faults which they ascribe to Richard and his court through the associations of youth. Youth brings susceptibility to bad counsel, which seems ﬁrst of all to be moral counsel, leading to sin. But in the end, this counsel is of a practical kind also, for sin, especially pride, leads to unwise decisions which bring the king’s downfall in ⁹³ Usk, 74. ⁹⁴ Ibid. ⁹⁵ Taken an observation of normal practice at Richard’s court by Saul 1995: 854–5; Saul 1997a: 239. ⁹⁶ Annales, 210.\n\n20\n\nRichard II\n\ntheir train. Bad counsel and wilfulness are not only sinful, leading to damnation, they also show a lack of prudence, leading to worldly failures. Of course, this focus might be a result of the particular concerns of the clerical, or lay clerkly, authors of these texts. But it certainly seems that the themes which boyhood, youth, and manhood invoked were more complex than is suggested by an interpretation of these texts purely in terms of the unmilitary tendencies or courtly non-conformism of the court of Richard II. The importance in these texts of the susceptibility of youth to bad counsel, and of the dangerous consequences of youthful counsel, might suggest another possible reason why the king’s enemies attacked him in these terms: that he really did surround himself with youthful advisers. This initially promising trail soon runs cold, however, for as R. H. Jones long ago pointed out, Richard’s advisers were never exclusively youthful.⁹⁷ The king’s chamberlain, Sir Simon Burley, was around 52 years of age when he met his death in the Merciless Parliament of 1388.⁹⁸ Burley was at least two years older than the oldest Appellant, Thomas Beauchamp, earl of Warwick.⁹⁹ Chancellor Michael de la Pole, meanwhile, would have been in his mid-50s when he was impeached in 1386.¹⁰⁰ Amongst the king’s sometime opponents, Richard’s uncle, Thomas of Woodstock, duke of Gloucester, was aged 33 at the time of the Merciless Parliament.¹⁰¹ Gloucester was some thirteen years younger than the next youngest son of Edward III, Edmund, duke of York, who remained loyal to the king until his deposition.¹⁰² Moreover, Thomas of Woodstock was only seven years older than the king’s close friend and ally, Robert de Vere, earl of Oxford.¹⁰³ Thomas Arundel, the future archbishop of Canterbury, was less than two years older than Gloucester, and he would have been 33 at the time of his ﬁrst intervention in politics in 1386.¹⁰⁴ Although Gloucester’s fellow Appellant, Richard Fitzalan, earl of Arundel, would have turned 40 in 1386, and had passed 50 by the time of his execution in 1397, he was two years younger than one of the king’s most trusted ofﬁcers in his later years, Edmund Stafford, bishop of Exeter.¹⁰⁵ Sir John Bussy and Sir William Bagot, notorious associates of Richard II in the late 1390s, were active in the service of John of Gaunt in the late 1370s, and so were probably in their 40s or ⁹⁷ ¹⁰⁰ ¹⁰² ¹⁰⁴\n\nJones 1968: 93. ⁹⁸ Leland 2006. ⁹⁹ GEC, vol. xii, pt. ii, 375.

Indeed, this is not even quite what is alleged by Archbishop Arundel, John Gower, and Richard the Redeless. Gower, in particular, condemned the wilful, sinful, youthful counsel which predominated at the court to such an extent that even older men acquiesced in it. His accusation was less that his counsellors were exclusively youthful than that the courses of action followed by the king were those characteristic of youths. What was it, then, which made so resonant the themes of the inconstancy of youth, of youthful counsel, and of the unmanly mores of the king and his court? It cannot be said that the signiﬁcance of youth and manhood derives straightforwardly from either the physical attributes of the king, or from the age of his counsellors. Some doubts have already been raised as to how they relate to Richard’s traditional reputation for a love of courtly culture, absolutist ideas and peace with France. It will be the work of the bulk of this book to investigate what lay behind the use of these themes by returning in detail to the politics of the late fourteenth century. Yet, before we do so, there is one further issue which needs to be addressed. We cannot hope to understand how the attacks of Richard’s critics related to the political controversies of these years without ﬁrst inquiring into the broader cultural context in which they staged their rhetoric. It remains to determine how exactly these themes relate to late medieval concepts of manhood and youth, to reveal which received ideas they invoked, and which they left to one side. Even at ﬁrst glance, Richard’s critics seem to present a very particular version of manhood, in which youthful, boyish, or feminine mores are characterized by inconstancy in speech and inconstancy in morals, and a taste for bad counsel, which is in turn a result of a preference for worldly pleasure and individual will instead of the circumspect pursuit of reason and salvation. We have already suggested that this might have something to do with the clerical or clerkly perspective of these writers of monastic chronicles, sermons, and politico-moral treatises. Was this the only way of seeing manhood in late medieval England? Were there manly attributes which they put to one side, but which their contemporaries might have placed centre stage? One way to approach these questions is to broaden the inquiry to consider the full range of meanings of manhood and youth in late ¹⁰⁶ Gillespie 2004; Clark 2004.\n\n22\n\nRichard II\n\nfourteenth-century England. One initially promising approach to this task is to turn to theoretical texts available in the late fourteenth century for ready deﬁnitions of ‘manhood’, ‘youth’, and related terms, an account of their properties and an explanation of their interrelationship. Medical, theological, didactic, and encyclopaedic texts do indeed provide such an account.¹⁰⁷ Much useful work has been done on these texts, both by gender historians and as part of research into the ‘ages of man’.¹⁰⁸ Yet from the point of view of an historian interested in the practice of politics, an inquiry into these theoretical writings, although essential, is not in itself sufﬁcient. Ideally, it would be desirable to ﬁnd some way of discovering what happened to academic medical ideas when they were removed from a technical context, and what impact (if any) the didactic norms presented in sermons and encyclopaedia had at the level of the late fourteenth-century English gentry and nobility, or of civic and ecclesiastical elites. Even if Archbishop Arundel, John Gower, and the rest could be shown to have used the same elaborate theoretical ideas of manhood, it needs to be established whether this was merely a matter of blinding their audience with authority, or whether their arguments might have been expected to strike a genuine chord. One possible approach to this problem is to begin by investigating the use of language, as a source of clues to the unspoken, commonplace ideas of a society.¹⁰⁹ Language is one set of social practices which is neither wholly reducible to society (it is not a ‘reﬂection’ of society) nor totally independent of it (it is not an immobile structure uninﬂuenced by the society in which it is used).¹¹⁰ The fact that these social practices are shared to some extent amongst those who are competent to speak a language makes it a valuable counterweight to the evidence of texts which set out to deﬁne norms of manhood and youth. Although the evidence of language is no panacea, no superior collection of abstract ideals which straightforwardly encodes the assumptions of an entire society, it does provide a valuable and necessary additional source to be placed alongside more self-conscious writing. Once this approach has been selected, it remains to determine which language should be studied, since England in the late fourteenth-century ¹⁰⁷ See below, Ch. 4. ¹⁰⁸ e.g. Cadden 1993; Bullough 1973; Bullough 1994; Burrow 1986; Sears 1986. ¹⁰⁹ See also Watts 1996: 53–4; Fletcher 2005: 9–16. ¹¹⁰ Cameron 1990.\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\nwas at least a trilingual society. Focused as it is on the ‘centre’ of politics, this study is concerned ﬁrst and foremost with English, as the lingua franca shared by the political classes, from the nobility and ecclesiastical hierarchy to gentry and civic elites. Nonetheless, Latin and AngloFrench texts used or composed in England will be used to provide an extra sidelight on insular usage. Tellingly, Latin or French texts produced in England in the fourteenth century often have the feel of having been translated from English.¹¹¹ It is often possible to show that they are using a semantic logic which would not be accepted in non-insular versions of those languages. That said, if a usage is found only in Latin or French, it cannot be assumed that it was current in English too. Sermons delivered to clerical audiences, for example, might make use of Latin wordplay which would not have worked in English.¹¹² If an English usage is found in Latin or French texts written in England, however, it is clearly of interest to an inquiry into the commonplace assumptions which language can encode and help to reproduce. The next two chapters will consider the language of manhood in detail, in particular in those aspects which seem to draw it away from the implicit account of manhood given by Richard’s critics. Chapter 2 focuses on the association of manhood with physical strength and, more particularly, with the constancy and courage in battle which led to the accumulation of honour. It considers the involvement of manhood in a system of honour in which the status of manhood had to be constantly defended by a consistent response to each potentially shaming challenge. Chapter 3 turns from this material to consider the interaction between charitable ‘humanitas’ and ‘manly’ action as magniﬁcent action, including largesse, appropriate to maintain a certain rank. It suggests that the critics of Richard II, and moralists as a whole, pushed to one side the problem that expenditure in accordance with one’s means did not necessarily correspond with the requirements of one’s ‘estate’. Chapter 4 then returns to medieval theoretical texts, the terms of reference of which lie closer to those of Richard’s critics. These medical and didactic texts used the inconstancy which youths share with women to distance them from manhood, and to put forward certain moral standpoints on correct masculinity. Once this cultural ¹¹¹ On the use of French in England from the thirteenth century, see Wilson 1943; Rothwell 1968; Rothwell 1978; Short 1979–80; Kennedy 1998; Trotter 2000. ¹¹² e.g. Brinton, Sermons, 7–8.\n\n24\n\nRichard II\n\nbackground has been ﬁlled in, it will be possible to return to the politics of Richard II’s reign with a better knowledge of the variable meanings of manhood and youth available to his opponents, to his allies and to the king himself, and to start to uncover how these became such potent themes in the ﬁnal decades of the fourteenth century.\n\n2 The Language of Manhood I: Strength, Violence, and Honour It is clear that Richard II’s unmanly reputation is not simply an invention of later historians. The king’s youth and changeability, his vanity and susceptibility to bad counsel, his vulnerability to the evils of a decadent court and his taste for pleasing appearances—all of these themes are to be found in a group of contemporary texts, some of which invoke youth, others manhood and boyhood, and one of which asserts that the king was feminine in appearance. It remains to be seen, however, how exactly these themes relate to late medieval concepts of manhood, so that we can determine which received ideas they invoked, and which they left to one side. The present chapter begins the work of sketching out fourteenthcentury commonplace ideas through a study of words, in particular how Middle English speakers ordinarily used words like ‘manhood’, ‘manly’, and expressions like ‘as a man’. It focuses in particular on one strand of the language of manhood, whose underlying values were surprisingly neglected by Richard’s post-deposition critics, and whose associations were organized around strength, physical courage, honour, and vengeance. Before the language of manhood can be used as evidence for commonplace assumptions current in late medieval England, one fundamental question must be raised. What, if anything, was the ‘man’ in Middle English uses of ‘manhood’, ‘manly’, and their cognates? Was it a human being, an adult, an adult-male or something else? This deceptively simple question cannot always be met with a simple answer. It is important to bear in mind the limitations of an intuitive model of language as a system for assigning names to things.¹ What matters in much of language is not the mental recognition of the link between a word and ¹ Wittgenstein 1958; Fogelin 1976: ch. 10.\n\n26\n\nRichard II\n\na thing, but the mastery of the rules governing the correct use of a particular word.² It would thus be wrong to imagine that every time Middle English users said that a particular action displayed ‘manhood’ or that a particular act was performed ‘manly’ they summoned up in their minds an image of a ‘man’ who possessed these qualities. That said, ‘manhood’, ‘manly’, and their cognates might be said to be referential in a way that not all words are, since they can be deﬁned by reference to ‘the qualities of a man’. ‘Manhood’ sometimes seems to behave in a similar fashion to, say, ‘childish’ in modern English, in which a symbol is invoked (a child), along with a series of associations particular to the use of that word. It is not self-evident that a particular child is necessarily childish, but nor would it be correct to say that there is no symbolic association between children and childishness. Only by looking closely at language in use does it become possible to determine if the same can be said for ‘manly’ and ‘manhood’ in any particular instance, and what a ‘man’ might be in these differing contexts. Whilst it is clear that ‘man’ and ‘manhood’ could be used quite neutrally in certain circumstances to denote, for example, ‘humanity’, the broader connotations of these words, including gendered ones, often come into play even in relatively straightforward instances of usage. Certainly, writers could refer to the ‘manhede’ of Christ simply in contrast to his ‘godhede’, ³ or note that Merlin, too, had some ‘godhede’ mixed in with his manhood.⁴ ‘Manhood’ could denote human ﬂesh—as in the ‘manhede’ that Christ took on for us,⁵ that Mary passed on to Christ,⁶ or that Adam, Eve, and Abel had in common.⁷ All this could be done without invoking the qualities associated with an adult male, ² Austin 1975; Fodor, Bever, and Garrett 1974: ch. 4. ³ e.g. Seinte Katerine, ed. S. R. T. O. d’Ardenne and E. J.

Yet on other occasions, wider associations are invoked even where they are not, strictly speaking, relevant. Thus in the section of the Middle English Dictionary which lists uses of the word ‘man’ ‘with emphasis on adulthood’, most of the examples cited stress not just adulthood, but adult-maleness. True, when in Chaucer’s Knight’s Tale, after the death of Arcite, ‘ther wepeth both child and man’, the public referred to does indeed include both men and women.⁸ But, by contrast, in the Pardoner’s Tale, when the taverner reports that Death has in this last year slain ‘Bothe man and womman, child, and hyne, and page’, ‘man’ seems to be ﬁrst of all contrasted with ‘woman’, secondly with ‘child’, and ﬁnally with those with the status of a labourer (hyne) or a page.⁹ The ‘man’ seems to be an adult male, not just an adult, and a high status one at that. Middle English use of ‘man’ often slips into referring exclusively to males, forgetting that women might also be covered by that term.¹⁰ The examples given by the MED of individuals growing to reach ‘mannes state’ or ‘mannes might’ all explicitly concern males. Growing or being made a ‘man’, meanwhile, seems to involve rather more than just passing into adult age. Translations of I Corinthians 13:11, for example, do have the potential to be gender neutral, involving an opposition only with ‘child’ (‘whanne I was maad man [var: a man], I auoydide tho thingis that weren of a litil child’).¹¹ However, as the example of Archbishop Arundel’s sermon has already demonstrated, this text could equally well invoke wider, gendered connotations. The use of expressions such as ‘he shall be a man’, speaking of a male child, could also bring in broader associations than adulthood alone. Thus in the devotional tract known as the Book to a Mother, composed towards the end of the fourteenth century, the writer condemns parents who do not raise their children in virtue.¹² If their child follows God’s commandments they are sorry and say ‘He schal neuere be man’, but if he is a great swearer and bragger, they say ‘He schal be a man, for he liche his fadur is.’¹³ To argue that being ‘a man’ is gender-neutral in this passage would involve putting ⁸ Riverside Chaucer, ‘Canterbury Tales’, fragment I, l. 2830. ⁹ Ibid., fragment VI, l. 687. ¹⁰ As with the formally gender-neutral use of the Latin ‘homo’ as distinct from ‘vir’. See Clark 1998: 15–16. ¹¹ The Holy Bible . . . by John Wycliffe and his Followers, eds. J. Forshall and F. Madden (Oxford, 1850), iv. 363 [c.1384]. ¹² Book to a Mother: An Edition with Commentary, ed. A. J. McCarthy (Salzburg, 1981), iii. ¹³ Ibid., 78–9.\n\n28\n\nRichard II\n\naside not just the sex of the child under discussion (‘for he like his father is’) but also a number of far more elaborate, if dimly perceived, associations attached to being ‘a man’, notably vigorous oath-swearing and verbal aggression. When we move away from the use of the word ‘man’ to consider the use of ‘manly’ (which is often an adverb in Middle English) and ‘manhood’, this particular set of associations comes into sharper focus. The most general use of the word ‘manly’ is to describe vigorous or speedy activities or individuals. Thus in the opening scenes of the alliterative romance William of Palerne,¹⁴ the emperor of Rome rides so ‘manly’ (as an adverb) that he loses his way.¹⁵ Later, the emperor sends messengers ‘manly’ to his daughter to let her know that he is coming with his company, and so they speed ‘manly’ to her.¹⁶ This use of ‘manly’ to denote speed alone is, however, relatively rare. The fondness for this usage shown by the author of William of Palerne is perhaps not unrelated to its convenience for making up alliterative lines. It may be that this use drew on the associations of the Middle English ‘wight’, which could be a human being or any living creature, and whose primary characteristic was life, or energy, and which seems to have been more gender neutral than ‘man’.¹⁷ Strength and energy in battle are the most common qualities with which ‘manly’ and ‘manhood’ are associated. These connotations emerge most straightforwardly in situations of physical ﬁghting, which are found frequently, although far from exclusively, in the Middle English romances which were composed, translated, re-copied, and re-adapted throughout the fourteenth and ﬁfteenth centuries.¹⁸ Thus, in one episode in Of Arthour and of Merlin,¹⁹ in which Gawain and his fellows resist ¹⁴ The English William of Palerne was commissioned by Humphrey de Bohun, earl of Hereford, 1335/6–1361, and so was probably composed sometime in the 1340s or 1350s. See William, 14–15. ¹⁵ William, ll. 207–8. ¹⁶ William, ll. 1330–3. Cf. William, ll. 2690, 4185. ¹⁷ MED, ‘wight’ (noun), ‘wight’ (adjective), ‘wighti’ or ‘wightili’ (adverb). ¹⁸ For a discussion of the ‘popularity’ of these texts in the fourteenth and ﬁfteenth centuries, see Fletcher 2004: 330–1 and works cited there, nn. 31–7. ¹⁹ Of Arthour and of Merlin is an adaptation of that part of the French prose Arthurian cycle known as Merlin. See Arthour, ii, 2. It exists in two distinct versions, one found in the Auchinlech MS of c.1330, the other in two MSS dating from the late fourteenth or ﬁfteenth century. See Orfeo, ix–x; Arthour, ii, 1–2, 40–2; Guddat-Figge 1976: 228, 264.\n\nStrength, Violence, and Honour\n\n29\n\nthe invading pagans, he scatters all his enemies, ﬁghting ‘so manlich’, that of the thirty thousand pagans, only twenty escape.²⁰ Or, in Richard Coer de Lyon,²¹ the hero king shows might and energy in battle when he assaults a Sicilian town, ﬁghting ‘so manly’ that none of his men perish.²² This manly vigour, courage, and strength can sometimes be seen in just the appearance of a ﬁghting man. Thus in William of Palerne, when the hero ﬁrst rides out to ﬁght the Spanish army, all in the city of Palermo are amazed ‘at so courageous a countenance’, and then, when he comes to the barons, knights, and nobles, they rejoice ‘that so manly a man would ﬁght on their side’.²³ In the battle which follows, another warrior is distinguished by being manly, the young nephew of the king of Spain’s steward, ‘the manlokest man that men schold of heren [i.e. hear about]’.²⁴ Clearly, however, he is not the ‘manlokest’ man of all, for William soon kills him, sending his horse and that of the steward to his own lover. Although the language of manhood appears in a variety of battle situations, it is strongly associated with physical courage shown in adversity. When in Guy of Warwick, the hero ﬁghts the dragon of Northumberland, he shatters his lance on the creature’s hide, before it fells him from his horse.²⁵ His sword does no damage, and the dragon soon encircles him with its tail and breaks three of his ribs. Guy does not give in, however, but instead delivers himself ‘manliche’: & Gij with strengthe smot him tho: Atvo he him karf smartliche, ²⁰ Arthour, ll. 4839–4849. Cf.

See Zupitza 1873: 623–4; Guddat-Figge 1976: 73, 144, 213; Fragments of an Early-Fourteenth Century Guy of Warwick, ed. M. Mills and D. Huws (Oxford, 1974).

An appeal to ‘manship’ or ‘manly’ behaviour is often used in speeches designed to ﬁre up the troops when this kind of energetic behaviour in adversity is called for. At one point in William of Palerne, the queen of Sicily implores her barons not to surrender to the approaching Spanish, but to maintain ‘youre manchip manlie a while’ until God should send them good tidings.²⁷ Similar sentiments are invoked in King Alisaunder, when Tholomeus rallies his troops telling them to ‘smite manlich’ on their enemies when the time comes,²⁸ and in Richard Coer de Lyon, when the king addresses his mariners before a battle, urging them on with a play on words, saying: Maryners, arme wele your shyppes, And holde vp your manshyppes, By the water-halfe ye than assayle And we by the londe saunce fayle. (‘Mariners, arm well your ships, and hold up your manships, then attack by water, and we will attack by land without fail.’)²⁹\n\nSometimes, part of the meaning of ‘manship’ seems to be the duty owed to a lord by his ‘men’. ‘Don manhood’ denotes ‘doing homage’ in a ²⁶ C14 Guy (Auchinleck), ll. 7256–7258.
