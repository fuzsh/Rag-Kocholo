        "text": "Derby History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nThe origins of the Derby name lie with England's ancient Anglo-Saxon culture. It comes from when the family lived in the county of Derbyshire. The place-name was originally derived from the Old English word Doer-by or Derby which was listed in the Domesday Book and literally meant a \"farmstead or village where deer are kept.\" 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Derby family\n\nThe surname Derby was first found in Derbyshire where the \"surname is derived from a geographical locality. 'of Derby,' the capital of the county of that name.\" 2 Thus the name originated in the county of Derbyshire (pronounced Dar-bi-sher), and indicated a person who came from Derby (pronounced Darby.)\n\nThe first recorded instance of the family was Roger de Derby who held estates in the year 1160. The Hundredorum Rolls of 1278 list Edelota Darby in Oxfordshire and later the Assize Rolls of Essex listed Simon Derby in 1377. 3\n\nAs far as the Derbyshire variant, Geoffrey de Derbesire was the first record found in the Assize Rolls of Staffordshire in 1203. Later, in 1307, the Assize Rolls listed Henry and Richard de Derbyshire as holding lands there at that time. 3\n\nOver in Lancashire, the Lay Subsidy Rolls of 1332 listed Robert de Derby as living there and later the Yorkshire Poll Tax Rolls of 1379 listed: Robertas de Derby; Johannes Derby; and Nicholaos de Derby. 2\n\n\"Darby and Joan\" is a proverbial phrase for a loving married couple in England that was inspired by John Darby (died 1730) and his wife Joan. They were first mentioned in a poem published in The Gentleman's Magazine by Henry Woodfall in 1735. Woodfall was in fact, an apprentice to John Darby, a printer in Bartholomew Close, London. This first poem inspired others by St. John Honeywood and Frederic Edward Weatherly and the characters are referenced in works by Robert Louis Stevenson and Lord Byron.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Derby family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Derby research.

For that reason, spelling variations are commonly found in early Anglo-Saxon surnames. Over the years, many variations of the name Derby were recorded, including Darby, Derby, Darbyshire, Derbyshire, Darbie, Darbey, Derbie, Derbey, Darbishire and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Derby family\n\nNotables of the family at this time include Abraham Darby I (1678-1717), an English Quaker ironmaster & pioneer of coke-fired smelting, the first and most well known of three generations of people who held the same name.

In droves people migrated to the many British colonies, those in North America in particular, paying high rates for passages in cramped, unsafe ships. Although many of the settlers did not make the long passage alive, those who did see the shores of North America perceived great opportunities before them. Many of the families that came from England went on to make essential contributions to the emerging nations of Canada and the United States. Research into various historical records revealed some of first members of the Derby family emigrate to North America:\n\nDerby Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nJohn Derby, who settled in New England in 1630\n\nEdward Derby, who settled in Massachusetts in 1630\n\nRobert Derby, who arrived in Virginia in 1648 5\n\nAnn Derby, who arrived in Maryland in 1656 5\n\nThomas Derby, who arrived in Maryland in 1669 5\n\n...

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Utcunque placuerit Deo\n\nMotto Translation: Howsoever it shall have pleased God.\n\nCitations +\n\nMills, A.D., Dictionary of English Place-Names.
