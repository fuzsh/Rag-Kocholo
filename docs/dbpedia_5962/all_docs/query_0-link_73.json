The book had long ago established itself as a recognised work of reference, and as an indispensable adjunct to every library ; and being suitable to the needs and purposes of jewellers and engravers, it had also from its first publication been adopted and accepted as the standard work of reference for business and trade purposes. By far the larger proportion of armorial orders placed in the hands of tradesmen for execution are carried out with the assistance of \" Fairbairn.\" The ever-increasing number of new families and new grants of arms, and the constant immigration of families of foreign origin using crests hitherto found in no English book of reference, c.-eate from time to time the necessity of extensive additions to the eatries which the text contains. The large edition which we published in 1892 having been entirely exhausted, we availed ourselves of the opportunity afforded by the necessity of reprinting the volumf: us again submit the work to such revision as was required to bring it up to the present date. This, we believe, will enable the book to maintain fully its old position and reputation as the only authoritative and the most complete collection of Crests and Mottoes in use in this country, a position in which it has hitherto had no rival. The question of the right of any particular person to the crest to which a claim is made depends upon proof of descent from the original grantee. Such proof often amounts to a highly controversial discussion, and it has seemed to us that we were not called upon for the purposes of the present work to adopt any such standard ; rather otherwise, because the omission of a crest in consequence of a lack of proof of pedigree would create a hindrance to the use of the book by those handicraftsmen who need to refer to its pages. PREFACE TO THE PRESENT EDITION We therefore can give no guarantee of the official accuracy on the point of rightful inheritance. The existence of the original corpus of the book, which, when compiled, was never based upon the requirement of an official imprimatur for each crest, precludes therein any adoption of the official standard. The additions to the text in the present edition have been considerable, but the overwhelming bulk of these additions has been obtained from sources not in themselves official, certainly, but purporting to be based upon information having a more or less official character. Such being the case, we can unhesitatingly assert that in the present edition the proportion of officially authorized crests is infinitely higher than in any previous edition of the work, not even excepting the edition of 1892. As to the remainder, the position is now as it was then; we have no exact knowledge, and the crests may or may not be authoritative. THE PUBLISHERS. EXTRACT FROM THE EDITOR'S PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION OF 1892. HE origin of Heraldry has puzzled wiser and abler heads than mine ; indeed, it would be folly to attempt, in the Preface to a Work of this character, to discuss the matter at all ; but the whole subject may be said to resolve itself into the query, \" Where does mere ornamentation end, and where does Heraldry ' aswe know it' begin ?\" The generally received opinion seems to be that the Crusades were coeval with, if, indeed, they were not the cause of, the birth of Heraldry, its laws, and its emblems. Undoubtedly Arms — i.e., the charges and field depicted upon the escutcheon — were of prior origin to crests. Consequently there are many Coats-of-Arms to which no Crest has ever been assigned, and which have no such ornament attached or belonging to them, but I have only come across one solitary Crest which possessed a legitimate existence without a corresponding and complementary Coat-of-Arms pertaining to it. This one (borne by a family of Duckworth) arose through a peculiar combination of circumstances, and has been rectified nearly a century. The Crest is that part of the complete achievement which is placed upon and surmounts the coronet, wreath, or chapeau, which in its turn is above the mantling or lambrequin which it is supposed to attach to the helmet. Anciently, whilst the coronets and chapeaux were reserved for the rank to which they appertaina.d, none below the rank of the knightly families were permitted to place their Crest upon a wreath. But both these laws- and mare, is *hc p'ity — have long been relegated to*-oblivion ; and at the present day, unless the Crest be speciall}' blazoned, as upon a chapeau, or issuing from a coronet (as to the different forms of which refer to the Glossary), both of which are required to be mentioned in its Blazon, it must always be placed upon a wreath or torse. This is supposed to be a skein of coloured silk and a gold or silver cord twisted together, and at the present day is always of the principal — i.e., the first- mentioned in the Blazon— colour and metal of the Arms, of which six alternate \"twists\" must be visible, the metal occurring first at the dexter end (see Plate i, No. 2). When a \" fur \" occurs upon the Arms instead of either metal or colour, the ground tincture of the fur should be taken. In the next place, I wish to explain the laws governing the usage and adoption of Crests. It is not, as I have often been solemnly assured, \" simply a matter of choice \" and personal fad or fancy upon the part of the bearer, and the sooner it is fully understood the better it will be PREFACE that His Majesty's College of Arms in Queen Victoria Street, London ; Lyon Office, in the New General Register House in Edinburgh ; and Ulster's Office, in the Record Tower of Dublin Castle, are absolutely the only legitimate or authoritative Offices of Arms within His Majesty's Dominions. So recently as 1804 the Law Offices of the Crown reported to H.M. King George HI. that \"the Heralds have the original cognizance of Pedigrees and Coat-Armour.\" Who, then, has the right to display Armorial Bearings ? That it is a matter of the Law of the Land, in addition to conformity to Heraldic regulations, may not be generally known, but in the Warrants directing the Visitations of the various counties and districts during the si.xteenth and seventeenth centuries, to be made in obedience to the Royal Commissions, the right is clearly laid down, and at the present day exists under as well defined limits as those which govern and regulate the Peerage. In England — for in the three countries the laws are not the same — direct legitimate male descent is required to be proved from some person to whom Armorial Bearings were recorded and allowed at the Visitations, or to whom Arms have since been granted or exemplified, and, failing such descent, it is necessary to petition for the favour of the Earl Marshal's Warrant to the Kings of Arms that a Patent of Armorial Bearings shall be issued to you, if it be so desired. In Ireland, the same qualifications are necessary to inherit Armorial Bearings ; but in addition, and in Ireland only, it is within the power and authority of Ulster King of Arms, in cases where a Coat-of-Arms has been borne continuously by a family for four or more generations, but without lawful authority, according to his discretion, to confirm those Arms and their usage within specified limitations, with the addition of some mark which shall be readily recognisable as a sign of confirmation. In Scotland, the right to bear the Arms or Crest of a family is absolutely confined to the heir male only. All younger sons are required to matriculate their Arms and Crests in Lyon Court, when some mark of cadency is added, and their younger sons again in their turn must do likewise, and have a further and additional sign of cadency added to the Bearings. Though not a regulation, it appears to have been a very frequent practice upon each occasion of such matriculation to entirely alter the Crest, which accounts for the very large number of utterly different Crests in existence for the same famJUy amongst the Scottish Ordinaries of Arms. Tii .;'^,'=; \"'^•-'■uch thing as the \" prescriptive right to Arms,\" as to which some people talk glibly. Others of their persuasion have other little plausibilities, equally corrupt, which they bring into prominence. And it is a fairly safe plan to pursue to reject as bogus all Arms and Crests which boast no other origin than the heraldic stationer who, for a trifling fee, professes, on receipt of \" name and county,\" to find armorial bearings for any applicant. Mottoes in England and Ireland are not necessarily hereditary, and unless attached to, or in any way forming a part of, the Arms or Crest, may be altered, assumed, or discarded at the will of the bearer, and borne in any position in relation to his Arms or Crest that he may fancy ; but in Scotland the Motto forms a part of the grant, and is unchangeable, and is also usually required to be borne upon an escroll above the Crest. A practice has lately very extensively arisen of using with a single surname two or more Crests. With a very few exceptions, it is only allowable so to do in cases where one of these be of honourable augmentation, or where one or both be governed by some special grant ; and in cases where, by the assumption of one or more additional surnames, or by a change of surname, such additional Crests — usually one for each surname — have been exemplified in accordance with the terms of the Royal License. No Lady whatsoever is allowed by the Laws of Heraldry to in any way bear or use, in her own right, either Crest or Motto ; and Arms only in a special and distinctive manner. The collection of Mottoes, with their Translations, which must of necessity form one of the features of the Book, it has been thought well to submit to the revision of the Rev. James Wood (Editor of \" Nuttall's Dictionary,\" New Edition), though, in justice to the erudition of this gentleman and his scholarly attainments, it should be known that I have throughout insisted upon the various Mottoes being spelt in the manner and retained in the actual form in which I have understood them to be used, even at the expense of accurate and scholastic spelling. Our ancestors had their own ideas — frequently peculiar — as to the method of spelling, and he would need be a Vandal who would cause unnecessary alterations in their quaint conceptions. And in addition, in some half-dozen cases, in order to preserve some pun — no doubt atrocious — I have asked for some translation to be allowed to stand which has not always been as literal a rendering as was possible of the foreign tongue, for we of the ancient and honourable Science and Brotherhood of Armory dearly love a pun. The Key to the Plates has been done in the offices of my Publishers, and in many other matters connected with the revision and publication of this Edition of ' Fairbairn ' I have ex perienced much kindness consideration, and assistance at their hands. The whole of the Illustrations of the last Edition have been carefully examined. Some have been altered and some rejected, and over One Thousand New Crests have been added to those previously appearing. It has been one great anxiety that the Illustrations, however slightly they might differ, should not be quoted as correct unless they actually were so, and this will account for the large proportion of the references being mentioned as only for purposes of comparison. The Book was (jriginally Compiled and Engraved in Scotland, by a Scotsman, and it is a well-known fact that both Scotch blazonry and emblazonment are far freer and \" looser\" than when controlled by the \"garrulous minuteness \" of the English school of Arms. This matter has been ably argued out (but, methinks, to a wrong conclusion), and explained in the latest book upon the subject which has left the press (Woodward & Burnett's \" Treatise of Heraldry \"). One sentence will explain my views. When a Blazon can be otherwise correctly depicted in two or more separate ways (and here I am not referring to mediaeval or antique styles of draughtmanship), and further, when one of those ways only is painted upon the Grant or Exemplification, why should it be open to discussion as to the possible accuracy of any other form ? If one form be rigi^t. why is not any other shape or position wrong ? For example, the term wliich, more than any other, has given me trouble on this score is one applied to birds — to wit, \" rising.\" My own idea is that this should be as upon Plate 88, No. 2. Plate 77, No. 5, is the other extreme, and is an accepted interpretation of the term in Scotland ; but I have seen in the Offices and College of Arms authoritative paintings of every other possible position of the wings, short of their being \" close,\" occurring in Coats-of-Arms or Crests, and blazoned simply as \" rising.\" A little uniformity upon this and other points in the Heraldry of the Three Kingdoms might be desirable. \" Fairbairn's Book of Crests,\" first published in the year 1859, was originally compiled by a certain -James Fairbairn, and was revised by Lawrence Butters, Seal Engraver in Ordinary to Her Majesty for Scotland. Its sale hitherto has been chiefly amongst Jewellers and Seal Engravers. Perhaps this accounts for the lamentable fact that many Crests have crept within its pages which can but be described as bogus. To have deliberately and in cold blood verified the thirty or forty thousand Crests which the Book in its previous Editions made mention of would have been a work of so many years' duration, and of so vast an expense, that it could by no possibility have ever repaid such expenditure. I have not attempted to do this, and consequently I do not pretend that this Edition is absolutely \" sans peur et sans reproche,\" but I have detected and discarded a vast quantity that were without authority, as a moment's comparison between the two Editions will readily show.

As some assistance to engravers, and rather than leave a larger proportion than was otherwise inevitable of the crests without any reference to an illustration, the term c/. (compare) has been used, and means that the reference is given only for comparative purposes, the plate not corresponding precisely with the blazon ; this term, however, being only used where the difference is but slight. It will be noticed that in the illustrations of many of the new crests the colour-lines appear in the form in which they are usually used in heraldic engraving, in order to render such illustrations perfectly correct renderings of particular crests. In cases where the same engraving would be correct if of another colour, it has been thought better to use the term \" compare \" (c/.) to prevent such illustrations being considered absolutely accurate.
