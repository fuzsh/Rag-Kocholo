Appears in SCP-4029, SCP-2728, SCP-2856, and URA-1902.\n\nAccelerate the Future (ATF): A very loosely structured organization which targets niche markets to turn a quick profit.

As a rule, they are not aware of any other anomalous group, but that doesn't mean secret interactions can't exist. Appear in SCP-3840, Masquerade's End, and Skunk Ape.\n\nPentagram: The United States Department of Defense's anomalous counterpart. They exist as a reflection and parody of the vicious and cold cruelty that the military industrial complex is.

Appears in Letters to a Prophet, SCP-1710, and SCP-2710.\n\nScarlet King: A mysterious god of immense power, often bringing out and representing blind rage, savageness, and the worst of humankind.
