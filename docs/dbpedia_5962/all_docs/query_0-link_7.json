        "text": "Derby Corporation Tramways\n\nOwner Derby Corporation\n\nTook over 1st January 1899 (Derby Tramways Company [horse])\n\nOperator Derby Tramways Company\n\nTook over (operation) 1st November 1899 (horse tramway)\n\nFirst electric route 27th July 1904\n\nLast horse service 1st June 1907\n\nClosed 2nd July 1934\n\nLength 13.96 miles\n\nGauge 4ft 0ins\n\nButton description (Pattern 1) The municipal device (a shield bearing a stag between two trees, all within palings), within a raised rim\n\nMaterials known Brass (2-piece, open-backed construction)\n\nButton Line reference [None]\n\nButton description (Pattern 2) Title (‘DERBY CORPORATION TRAMWAYS’) within a raised rim, surrounding the municipal arms (a stylised shield bearing a stag within palings)\n\nMaterials known Nickel; black horn\n\nButton Line reference [113/25]\n\nComment It is suspected that the Pattern 1 button was used on horsecar crew greatcoats, though this is by no means proven.\n\nThe stylised shield is a cut down version of the arms of the City of Derby, the so-called 'buck in the park'. This actually depicts a stag at rest within palings and is supposedly derived from the badge of Richard II. The absence of the stag supporters, as well as the city's motto 'Industria Virtus et Fortitudo' (diligence, courage and strength), is explained by the fact that these were only granted in 1939, five years after the demise of the tramway.\n\nIt is unclear when the corporation undertaking was renamed 'Derby Corporation Transport', but probably after the demise of the trams. Trams, buses and trolleybuses simply carried 'Derby Corporation' rather than 'Tramways', 'Transport' or 'Motors'."
