Derby and I even began sporting the same sunglasses and we both got matching blue mohawks!\n\nLife was good - in fact it was “all good, all the time” which became a motto we live by.\n\nThere was something missing though. For anyone living here in Southern California you know that when the sun goes down people and dogs alike can use a good hoodie! Finding a hoodie for me was pretty easy, but getting one for Derby was difficult with only limited choices."
