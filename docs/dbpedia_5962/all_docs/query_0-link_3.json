        "text": "Derby City Logo\n\nThe logo of Derby City Council looks quite abstract and modern. I wonder what's the meaning of it? The lower-left part of the logo looks like a snail (or the initial letter D in Derby?), the upper-right part seems a river, (Derwent river?) these two parts are connected by a straight line at the bottom.\n\nI did some searches on the web trying to find out the true meaning of Derby City Council logo, but without success. So, I wrote to tourist information, and got the answer from Michael:\n\nThe Logo is a representation of two of Derby's oldest emblems, one being a ram the other a buck (deer). Obviously the logo is a modern interpretation of these two figures so it is not obvious unless you know what to look for. Most people do seem to agree with you that it looks like a snail however.\n\nRam! the curly horn of ram looks like a snail indeed. The ram and the deer are from coat of arms of City of Derby,\n\nIn this coats of arms, we can see the deers both in shield (arms) and supporter, but the Arms represents a stag reposing between two oak trees in fruit, while the Supporters which are on either side of the coat of arms, represented by two bucks with a sprig of broom placed on the shoulder of each animal.\n\nWe can find the ram in the Crest, which represents a ram walking between two sprigs of broom and there is a golden collar or ring about its neck. This golden collar is to distinguish it from any other used in any other known crest.\n\nIt is interesting that the Motto are written in Latin, “Industria, Virtus, et Fortitudo” means “Diligence, Courage, Strength”.\n\nLabels\n\nHeraldry probably began with the knights in armour. When wearing a helmet in battle or in tournaments a knight could not be recognised; so he used symbols to decorate his shield and surcoat. The surcoat was the loose garment worn over the armour to protect it from rain or hot sun and actually was the \"coat-of-arms\"; it was decorated on the front and back with the same device as on the shield. The correct expression for entire design is an achievement . An achievement consists of the shield, helmet, rest, wreath, mantling and motto. These are the main parts. To them can be added supporters and a compartment. In the centre is the most important part, the shield . The surface of the shield is called the field and on it the colourful charges are placed. The shield is called the arms or coat-of-arms and can be drawn in any shape - in an upright position or slanting, which is the position it would fall into if hung on a peg. In Heraldry it slants to dexter. The helmet denot\n\nWe have a new netbook computer, and don't know where to find network key, which is needed to setup wireless connection. A network key may also be called WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) key or WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) key. A wireless network key is a security feature that prevents unauthorized users from accessing a wireless network. An unprotected network is an unlocked virtual door, anybody within range can piggyback on the network undetected. I use Virgin media broadband with a Virgin media wireless router, this router has a WPA key taped on the router, that WPA key is an English word consisting of 10 letters. To tape network key on the router is a good idea, because we may never lose or forget a wireless network key as long as we possess the router."
