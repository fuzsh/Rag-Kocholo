        "text": "The International Soap Box Derby (ISBD) serves as the official sanctioning body of Soap Box Derby racing, boasting exclusive licensing partnerships with over 100 race cities worldwide. These cities organize sanctioned Soap Box Derby races, where champions qualify for the annual FirstEnergy All-American Soap Box Derby® World Championship race. We proudly continue the Soap Box Derby tradition, hosting this eagerly awaited Championship race and other events year-round at our headquarters, the world-famous Derby Downs Track, located in Akron, Ohio.\n\nOur Soap Box Derby STEM-Based Education Program exemplifies our dedication to youth education and leadership development. It encompasses a STEM curriculum, the Gravity Racing Challenge® STEM Team Competition, the Mini-Car Program, and STEM Summer Camps. These initiatives reflect our commitment to our core values and mission.\n\nDid you know that the idea of the Soap Box Derby® grew out of a photographic assignment? A Dayton, Ohio newsman named Myron Scott was inspired by local kids and created a proposal for a local youth gravity race that was picked up by Chevrolet. Chevrolet then sponsored the first official All-American Soap Box Derby® in 1934! Learn more about the roots of this organization, the generations of Champions we’ve inspired, and view the Soap Box Derby Hall of Fame."
