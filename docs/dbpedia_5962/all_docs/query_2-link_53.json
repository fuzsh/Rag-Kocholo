        "text": "Welcome\n\nMy name is Victoria Gowan. I am very privileged to be the Headteacher of Lord Derby Academy. Lord Derby Academy is part of the Multi-Academy Dean Trust. All schools across the Dean Trust embrace the Trust motto ‘Believe, Achieve, Succeed’. Lord Derby Academy caters to approximately 1100 pupils, aged 11-16.\n\nAt Lord Derby Academy we uphold the highest of standards. Our ethos is built on care and aspiration for our whole school community. We are fully inclusive in our outlook and we have robust pastoral systems in place. We strive to develop the character of our pupils and so we offer a wide range of enrichment opportunities, both inside and outside the classroom. Our House System and our Pupil Parliament are developing pupil leadership at all levels. We encourage our pupils to become responsible citizens, ready for life in the wider society. Our traditional curriculum has been carefully designed to match the abilities, interests and aspirations of pupils and to meet with the requirements of further education providers and employers. We operate a three- year Key Stage 3 and a two- year Key Stage 4. Pupils enjoy a wide range of subjects across both Key Stages and the majority of our pupils access the full suite of English Baccalaureate subjects at Key Stage Four. Pupils across the Dean Trust follow common learning pathways. Teaching practice at the school is founded on the pedagogical principles of Dr. Doug Lemov. At Lord Derby Academy we are unwavering in our belief in every pupil and we work tirelessly to ensure each individual child receives a quality educational experience and is set on a personal pathway to success."
