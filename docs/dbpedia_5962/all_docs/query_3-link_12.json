        "text": "Bliss History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nThe ancestors of the Bliss family brought their name to England in the wave of migration after the Norman Conquest of 1066. They lived in Leicestershire and Worcestershire. The family name, however, is not a reference to either of those locations, but to the area of the family's residence prior to the Norman Conquest, Blois, in the Loir-et-Cher region of France. 1\n\nAnother source claims that the \"name seems to be connected with the Anglo-Saxon verb blissian, laetificare, to make glad or joyous.\" 2\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Bliss family\n\nThe surname Bliss was first found in Leicestershire and Worcestershire. The Hundredorum Rolls of 1273 had two early entries for the family: John Blisse, Buckinghamshire; and John Blisse, Kent. 3\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Bliss family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Bliss research. Another 124 words (9 lines of text) covering the years 1119, 1525, 1530, 1647, 1698, 1702, 1704, 1708 and 1721 are included under the topic Early Bliss History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nBliss Spelling Variations\n\nBefore the last few hundred years the English language had no fixed system of spelling rules. For that reason, spelling variations occurred commonly in Anglo Norman surnames. Over the years, many variations of the name Bliss were recorded, including Bliss, Bleys, Blois, Bloys, Bloiss and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Bliss family\n\nOutstanding amongst the family at this time was\n\nThomas Bliss (ca. 1647-1721), was an English Tory politician, Member of Parliament for Maidstone (1698-1702) and (1704-1708); and Reverend Phillip Bliss, hailed from Oxford University\n\nBliss Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Bliss is the 1,942nd most popular surname with an estimated 17,409 people with that name. 4\n\nLoading...\n\nBliss migration to the United States +\n\nThe unstable environment in England at this time caused numerous families to board ships and leave in search of opportunity and freedom from persecution abroad in places like Ireland, Australia, and particularly the New World. The voyage was extremely difficult, however, and only taken at great expense. The cramped conditions and unsanitary nature of the vessels caused many to arrive diseased and starving, not to mention destitute from the enormous cost. Still opportunity in the emerging nations of Canada and the United States was far greater than at home and many went on to make important contributions to the cultures of their adopted countries. An examination of many early immigration records reveals that people bearing the name Bliss arrived in North America very early:\n\nBliss Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nThomas Bliss, who settled in Boston Massachusetts in 1620\n\nThomas Bliss, who landed in Braintree, Massachusetts in 1635 5\n\nGeorge Bliss, who landed in Lynn, Massachusetts in 1637 5\n\nThomas Bliss, who arrived in New England in 1642 5\n\nJohn Bliss, who arrived in Northampton, Massachusetts in 1658 5\n\n...

By 1838, the British New Zealand Company had begun buying land from the Maori tribes, and selling it to settlers, and, after the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, many British families set out on the arduous six month journey from Britain to Aotearoa to start a new life.

They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 12\n\nBliss Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nOwen Bliss, aged 30, who landed in Barbados in 1635 aboard the ship \"Falcon\" 5\n\nWilliam Bliss, who settled in Jamaica in 1684\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Bliss (post 1700) +\n\nSir Arthur Edward Drummond Bliss CH KCVO (1891-1975), British composer and conductor from Barnes, a London suburb\n\nJohn William Michael Bliss OC FRSC (1941-2017), Canadian historian and award-winning author\n\nMajor-General Raymond Whitcomb Bliss (1888-1965), American Surgeon-General of the Army (1947-1951) 13\n\nRobert Bliss (b. 1921), American architect, educator and furniture designer, Associate Professor at the University of Minnesota (1958-1963)\n\nMichael Bliss (b. 1941), Canadian historian, Professor at the University of Toronto\n\nKathleen Bliss, American lawyer with the U.S Attorneys Office in New Mexico and Nevada (1997-)\n\nDr. Joseph M Bliss, Researcher With the Center of Biomedical Research Excellence, Brown University\n\nDouglas Percy Bliss (1900-1984), Scottish painter and art conservationist\n\nGilbert Ames Bliss (1876-1951), American mathematician and educator, Professor at several universities\n\nTasker Howard Bliss, American Army officer and statesman, chief of staff and General of the U.S. army (1917-)\n\n...

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Virtus sola felicitas\n\nMotto Translation: Virtue is the only happiness\n\nSuggested Readings for the name Bliss +\n\nGenealogy of the Bliss Family in America by Aaron Tyler Bliss.\n\nGenealogy of the Bliss Family in America, From About the Year 1550 to 1880 by John Homer Bliss.\n\nCitations +\n\nThe Norman People and Their Existing Descendants in the British Dominions and the United States Of America.
