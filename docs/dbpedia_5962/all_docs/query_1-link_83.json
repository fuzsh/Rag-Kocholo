        "text": "FSG Day 4! üá©üá™ The 4th day at FSG started with the last static event, the Business Plan Presentation, where the team presents a business plan revolving around the URE18. The presentation went very well. Yesterday, we had our first attempt of the Emergency Brake System Test. Unfortunately, we did not pass. However, the problems were revolved at night and we started queuing from 6 in the morning to ensure we were the first in line, and the test was completed successfully! We also did the Driverless Skidpad. Our first attempt was very successful, and we managed to get a great time of 5.69 seconds. However, when we wanted to improve the time set in the second attempt, we unfortunately went off track and had to abort the attempt. Nevertheless, the team can be proud of the time achieved during the first dynamic event of the race! Tomorrow, we will proceed with four dynamic events: EV Skidpad, DV Acceleration, EV Acceleration, and DV Autocross. A big thanks to UFe for sponsoring our trip to FSG! #Eindhoven #TUEindhoven #EngineeringStudent #StudentTeam #RacingTeam #formulastudent #FormulaStudentGermany #fsg\n\nFSG Day 3! üá©üá™ FSG Day 3 started with two static events: the Cost & Manufacturing and Engineering Design event. Both events went well, and we are waiting on the results and feedback which we will get on day 4. Quickly after the static events, we went to dynamic scrutineering. We passed the Tilt-, Rain-, and Brake test very quickly and headed to the Emergency Brake System Test. Unfortunately, we did not pass the EBS Test because we had some minor problems with the steering actuator. These will be resolved tonight, meaning we will queue again first thing tomorrow morning, as we did not have time left to re-try today. Tomorrow, we will re-do the EBS Test, and proceed with the Business Plan Presentation and Driverless Skidpad. A big thanks to UFe for sponsoring our trip to FSG! #Eindhoven #TUEindhoven #EngineeringStudent #StudentTeam #RacingTeam #formulastudent #FormulaStudentGermany #FSG\n\nFSG Day 1 & 2! üá©üá™ On Monday the team arrived at Formula Student Germany We set up camp and had our first event, Accumulator Scrutineering, which we managed to pass it on our first try! This meant that we could fully focus on the next scrutineering session, Mechanical Scrutineering. Unfortunately, we still had one small thing that was left to resolve. This was continued on Tuesday morning, after which we passed Mechanical Scrutineering as well! On Tuesday morning, we had our drivers perform an Egress. All drivers passed this swiftly, and the preliminary inspection took place. For Electrical Scrutineering, we had a few things that needed to be altered and the pit-crew worked hard to fix them as soon as possible. Therefore, we managed to pass Electrical Scrutineering aswel. Whilst we were there, we also got the Driverless Systems checked and passed Driverless Scrutineering at the same time. These days were a successful beginning to the Formula Student Germany competition! Tomorrow we will have the Rain-, Tilt- and Brake Test. A big thanks to UFe for sponsoring our trip to FSG!

For both the Engineering design and Business plan presentation we reached the top 10! This is a very good result and gave us a big start with the number of points on the static side. Furthermore, we did even better at the Cost and Manufacturing event, since we are in the top 3! Results will be released at the ceremony coming Thursday evening. Skidpad: In the early morning, we went to skidpad to give our second driver his 2 shots at setting a time. The times were very good and constant! Since we had only driven one time the day before the first driver was able to do another run today where he set another faster time! A 5,021!! This secured our third place for the skidpad event. Very good performance by the skidpad drivers! Acceleration event: Here the goal is to drive 75m as fast as possible. URE set a new personal record, 3.640! This is the fastest time we have ever done an acceleration event. We are very proud to have achieved this. Autocross: At autocross the same issues with the transponder occurred. The timing did not work, and we had to get it fixed. Eventually we were able to do 2 solid runs. Our best time was a 1:06:12. Very good time, we are awaiting the results! Day 6: Tomorrow is the day of the endurance where 22km will be driven by all teams.\n\nDay 4 at FSN üá≥üá± It was a busy day today consisting of scrutineering, static and multiple dynamic events. Through planning and good coordination we got through all of these. We successfully passed all scrutineering sessions and were able to continue on to the dynamics of the competition! Cost and manufacturing event: The cost department was up for judgement and was thoroughly questioned about the cost and manufacturing of our car. They had to explain why and how every part is manufactured. This went good and after an hour of questioning they finished and we had to go to the next thing on the agenda! Electrical scrutineering: After the Cost and Manufacturing event. The team quickly went to the electrical re scrutineering where they had to tick of some final points on the car. The electrical team had worked hard to resolve all points the day before. E-gress, Tilt test, Rain test and Brake test: Our 5 drivers needed to perform an e-gress, this meant the needed to get out of the car within 5 seconds while being in a seated position. They all passed on the first try! Next up was the tilt test. This is a test to check the center of gravity of the car. Furthermore we passed the brake test and the rain test on our first attempt. Skidpad: We were one of the earlier teams to perform a skidpad this day. Unfortunately the transponder on our car, the timing piece from the competitions, appeared to malfunction. The timings were not showing up and this meant we needed to retry it a couple of times. Eventually the transponder ended up working. We were able to set the last time of the day that consisted of a wet skidpad time of 5.017. At the time the third best time of the session. Tomorrow we will go back as early as possible trying to get the Day 5: Tomorrow we will have our second attempt on the skidpad and we will be driving the acceleration and autocross! #FSN #Engineering #Teamwork #Innovation #Scrutineering #Mechanical #Electrical #Design #RaceDay #Egress #Skidpad #RainTest #Braketest\n\nDay 3 at FSN üá≥üá± Electrical Scrutineering: Our first session took place this morning, and it went smoothly! While we had a few minor issues to address, there were no major problems. Our electrical team worked hard to complete the necessary changes. We plan to return on Tuesday for final approval. Mechanical Scrutineering: We also went through mechanical re-scrutineering. It was a productive day, and by the afternoon, we got the green light! Our only remaining task is to demonstrate the strength of a the brake pedal. With no further mechanical modifications needed, we completed the final computations this evening and are ready to present them to a scrutineer tomorrow. Engineering Design: In the afternoon, our engineering design team was judged. After days of preparation, we were ready! The session was intense, with many questions about our car, but the team handled it brilliantly and was pleased with the outcome. Team Pictures: At the end of the day, all teams gathered on the main straight of the circuit for group photos. #FSN #Engineering #Teamwork #Innovation #Scrutineering #Mechanical #Electrical #Design #engineering"
