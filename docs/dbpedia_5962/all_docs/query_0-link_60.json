Anna Markowska\n\nThe most important goal of the congress is to determine the current state of the discipline: where does art history stand in the year 2022, not only in Switzerland but also internationally? And what are its perspectives for the future? To this end, we have put together a threeday program consisting of a total of eleven sessions and two round table discussions. With over 100 speakers and session leaders, the congress reflects the breadth and diversity of art historical approaches and interests. Two topics will be our particular focus in 2022: the first of these is the Junior Researchers’ Forum, where doctoral students will have the chance to present their research in the new format of a “science slam”. A second focus is the guest country Japan, for which a dedicated session has been organized. We are delighted that this congress will take place in Zurich, a city distinguished by its many and diverse art institutions. https://www.vkks.ch/de/aktivitaeten/kongresse\n\npp. 128–29, 133: Leonardo da Vinci in the City Hall of Florence: Art and Politics; pp. 134–35, 139: Printing in Light and Dark: Chiaroscuro Woodcuts; pp. 148–49: Dürer and Raimondi: Chronicle of a Fictive Lawsuit; pp. 156–57: Artworks for Everyday Use: The Ephemeral Art of the Renaissance; pp. 166–67, 169: Raphael: Art in Collaboration; 186–87: Schema and Correction: Creative Copies in the Renaissance; 194–95, 201: Depicting the Human Body: In the Shadow of Michelangelo; pp. 202–3: Mythology Reloaded: Profane Love in Renaissance Art; pp. 230–31: At the Service of the Church: The Birth of the Italian Baroque"
