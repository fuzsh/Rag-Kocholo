ZZQ in Richmond was born as a pop-up in 2014. Just a few years before, Texas native Chris Fultz tempted Alex Graf out of vegetarianism with a brisket he’d smoked, and now they’re partners in life and business. Their pit room is equipped with smokers from Austin Smoke Works. Fultz spritzing the black bark of the briskets and wrapping them in butcher paper looks like a scene out of a Texas pit room. The smoked sausages are excellent, and even the chicken quarters stay juicy into the afternoon hours when the ribs are already sold out. For the smoked burger you’ll have to go next door to their new concept, Eazzy Burger, for the Big Iron burger with smoked cheddar, bacon, and a smoked tomato jam.\n\ntexas monthly\n\n14 Best BBQ Restaurants In The U.S.\n\nMay 28, 2023: Despite being located far from the Lone Star State, ZZQ Texas Craft Barbeque in Richmond, Virginia, has mastered the art of Texas-style barbecue.

All the familiar tropes are here, like the line that forms well before opening, the butcher paper plates, ordering by the pound, and plenty of stickers and memorabilia from other Texas-style joints (I spotted stickers from Jon G’s and Interstellar – let me know if you spot any of your faves!). You know the drill: order your favorite side of the brisket and find a table to indulge. It takes hours to make but disappears in moments…\n\nwayward blog\n\nThe 13 Best Restaurants in Richmond, Virginia\n\nNovember 3, 2022: If you can actually get your hands on some of the more popular entrees and cuts of meat from ZZQ, then count yourself lucky. The joint has been a staple in the brewery-heavy neighborhood of Scott's Addition for almost five years and consistently sells out of its perfectly smoked and seasoned brisket, pulled pork and ribs. Order up a sandwich or some meat (sold by the pound) as well as sides like the jalapeño macaroni and cheese and greens, frequently found on the plates of regular diners. The long lines can feel intimidating, but ZZQ founders Chris Fultz and Alex Graf lead a team that's got the flow down to a science. Patrons say they understand the hype and that the long lines are worth it for the delicious food and generous portions…\n\nU.S. News & World Report\n\nThe Best Barbecue in Every State\n\nAugust 24, 2022: The casual disinterest in the specifics of American barbecue's origins is perhaps one of the most American things about barbecue culture. Who cares, you're thinking—where's the beef? Joe Haynes' 2016 book Virginia Barbecue: A History makes the fact-based case, rather ardently, for the cradle of modern American civilization (you know, Jamestown, 1634, and all that) as the birthplace of Southern barbecue, back before it splintered, like so many Baptist denominations, into an array of regional styles…\n\nfood & wine\n\nRichmond Writes Its Next Chapter\n\nJuly 21, 2022: Richmond's vast brewery scene is an incubator for great food concepts, and my lunch stop was birthed at Ardent Craft Ales before opening its full-fledged restaurant in the Scott's Addition neighborhood.

The thoughtfully brewed stouts and saisons at Ardent Craft Ales (3200 W. Leigh St.) are best enjoyed in its beer garden, which overlooks the Texas-inspired barbecue oasis ZZQ (3201 W. Moore St.).

Smoked over white oak, the brisket is coated in salt, pepper, and a few other herbs and spices. Still, this is Virginia, so the pulled pork shoulder is finished with an Eastern North Carolina/Southern Virginia vinegar sauce, and sides that use produce from nearby farms, which might be a tomato pie or Cajun creamed corn…\n\nTHRILLEST\n\n30 Best Things to Do in Richmond, VA (for First-Timers)\n\nFebruary 1, 2022: You’ll find plenty of amazing BBQ joints in Richmond, and one of the most famous is ZZQ Texas Craft Barbeque on W.

The voice on the other end informed Graf that she, out of over 100 applicants across the country, had been chosen as one of 21 women to participate in the James Beard Foundation’s Women’s Entrepreneurial Leadership program. Offered in conjunction with Cornell University, the 10-week program offers continued training and educational opportunities for women business owners in the hospitality industry.

Focused on the Texas trinity of 'cue — brisket, ribs and sausage links — here the meat can be bought by the pound or stuffed into over-the-top sandwiches. Hungry loners can tackle The Tres Hombres sandwich, a one-pound behemoth made with brisket, pork shoulder and beef sausage.

But try to save a little room for the classic banana pudding, too.\n\nEATER WASHINGTON DC\n\nSpotlight: Alex Graf\n\nJune 18, 2021: A 25-year RVA resident, the pitmistress and co-owner of ZZQ unearths her adoration for everything from roller derby to local institutions\n\nrichmond magazine\n\nThe 41 American Barbecue Joints You Need to Try Right Now\n\nMay 27, 2021: You know the old saying: You can take the Texan out of Texas... The Lone Star State’s barbecue style is perhaps the most exported of any region so it’s natural to be skeptical of imitators, but Richmond’s ZZQ is the real deal, started by a native Austinite (raised in Mesquite), who honors his home state by cooking some of the best brisket you’ll find outside its boundaries. The three, 1,000-gallon offset pits are imported from Austin Smoke Works and burn local white oak (traditional post oak would be “inauthentic to the region”). The brisket rub is spiked with a few other herbs, but it doesn’t deviate too far from the coarse black pepper and salt standard. Still, this is Virginia, so the pulled pork shoulder is finished with an Eastern North Carolina/Southern Virginia vinegar sauce, and sides include tomato pie and Cajun creamed corn that use produce from nearby farms.\n\nTHRILLIST\n\n7 Best Day Trips From Washington, D.C.\n\nMay 16, 2021: It might sound odd to escape from one city just to go to another one, but Richmond feels a world away from D.C., even though it’s just 100 miles south. Visiting Richmond feels like being transported to the South: Everything moves just a little bit slower, people smile more easily, and the main thoroughfare through the city, Monument Avenue, is framed by elaborate homes with wide front porches and rows of stately shade trees. You’ll find Southern classics from fried chicken and grits to sweet tea as options at both casual and fancy restaurants throughout town. (My favorite: Lillie Pearl, a modern Southern spot in Richmond’s downtown.) Those aren’t the only culinary options, though. Richmond has recently gained a reputation as a foodie destination, with top spots such as Longoven, which Food & Wine named the best restaurant in the South, and ZZQ, with its award-winning smoked meats…\n\ntravel awaits\n\nThe Best Barbecue Place in Each State\n\nMay 07, 2021: ZZQ started life as an upstart backyard operation but they've grown into the pride and joy of the Richmond BBQ scene. Steadfastly dedicated to combining the best of Central Texas and Central Virginia, they are famed for their divine beef brisket and a prime rib that will change everything you thought you knew about prime rib. Yes, you may be in RVA but your taste buds will be in CTX.\n\nTRAVEL PULSE\n\n10 Reasons Why Richmond, Virginia Is A Hidden Culinary Gem\n\nMarch 16, 2021: This casual joint is proof positive you don’t have to be in Texas to score some seriously solid barbeque. Because at ZZQ, it isn’t just about tender, dry-rubbed brisket. There’s also racks of peppery ribs, and smoky, spicy sausages. (Fun fact: the three meats are widely known as the Texas Trinity.) And the side dishes, like the collards cooked with blackstrap molasses, hot sauce, and bacon, are so flavorful they stand out on their own.\n\nFORBES\n\nThe 50 Best Barbecue Joints In America\n\nMarch 14, 2021: ZZQ combines the classic Texan flavors with influences from central Virginia, to produce and authentic barbecue experience. Pit masters Chris Fultz and Alex Graf founded ZZQ Texas Craft Barbeque in 2013.

Even though the owner here is a Texas-native, they add a Virginian spin to all of their BBQ, creating one of the most unique, superb tastes in BBQ at the moment.\n\nbigseventraveL.com\n\nThe 15 Best Restaurants in Richmond\n\nNovember 11, 2020: Texas native Chris Fultz opened this barbecue hotspot in 2018 to immediate acclaim from smoked meat connoisseurs across the south. While traditional Carolinean pulled pork is on the menu, brisket is the star of the show here, and the “Texas trinity” of brisket, a half a rack of spare ribs and several links of house-made sausages tends to sell out fast. Meats are sold by the pound, alongside a few sandwich options, side dishes like jalapeño mac and cheese, and a daily selection of desserts. And yes, the restaurant’s name pays homage to legendary Texas rock band ZZ Top.\n\ntripsavvy.com\n\nFood & Wine: The Best Barbecue in Every State\n\nWhile this year has been devastating for restaurants, American barbecue remains as resilient and exciting as ever. We're celebrating the people and places that are hanging on, spectacularly… Whether it’s confidence or ambivalence, who knows, but this casual relationship with tradition has left classic Virginia barbecue (pork, pork, and more pork) to fade into the background somewhat, leaving newer arrivals to the state with plenty of room to create a new kind of barbecue culture altogether. This explains how Richmond fell in love with Chris Fultz and Alex Graf, the husband and wife team behind ZZQ, which began as a backyard pop-up in 2011, growing up to become a pinch-me-am-I-dreaming temple to the Central Texas style, open for just over two years now, and already an absolute Virginia essential. All the standards are well up to speed, starting with some of the finest brisket on the Eastern Seaboard, but Austin native Fultz, using local oak, smokes up some transcendent beef ribs, and prime rib, as well.\n\nfood & wine\n\n20 Essential Restaurants for Takeout and Delivery in Richmond\n\nAugust 28, 2020: Richmond is a city in the midst of change.

People line up here for good reason—this barbecue is among the best you’ll find anywhere. Meats, sold by the pound in a cafeteria-like line, are smoked in a 1,000-gallon smoker with white oak. Create your own combo by asking the slicers for some brisket, a sausage link, a pork rib, turkey breast and some pulled pork shoulder.

Bringing Texas BBQ to the state of Virginia is a blessing and now you can take advantage yourselves. These folks are always in the top list of the best BBQ not just in the city but across the USA and we wholeheartedly agree! Chris Fultz is the self taught pit master that truly puts his heart and soul in to his craft. With the team of Alex Graf, they really make BBQ what it has always meant to be…an art that melts in your mouth. In 2013, ZZQ was born after years of testing their methods with friends and family and now everyone has a chance to have a taste. All the food here is phenomenal, you really won't go wrong with anything you choose. They also have a full allergen menu so those including vegans and gluten free can have a bite too. On weekends, the lines are often out the door but that just shows that it's the best place in town and it's ALWAYS worth the wait to go get it. Also, the staff here is super friendly which is always a plus as most pits tend to be robotic and lack that customer service.
