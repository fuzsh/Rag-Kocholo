        "text": "Overview\n\nAll individuals, groups, and societies have to come to terms with the reality of the suffering of life. How we do that has profound implications for the kind of individuals we become and the social communities we create. The basis of our suffering is well known: that all of us have just found ourselves here with a genetically built body and brain we never chose that is vulnerable to disease and injury, lives for a short time before decaying and dying (Dawkins, 1976). Along this journey we will experience the grief of losses of loved ones, conflicts and life setbacks and for some, be in chronic pain and disability. We have minds full of many potential emotions both helpful and harmful (Gilbert, 2018; Nesse, 2019). Our environments make many of us unable to access to clean water, vulnerable to starvation, and diseases that with sufficient resources would be preventable and curable. And one of our (and other animals) greatest sources of suffering is other human beings that go to war, torture and turn other human beings (and animals) into slaves and resources to exploit.\n\nThere are three potential responses to suffering that can be referred to as the big three C’s (Gilbert, 2005, 2018; Gilbert and Mascaro, 2017): Compassion is ‘a sensitivity to suffering in self and others with a commitment to try to alleviate and prevent it’ (Gilbert, 2020a). Callousness, is an insensitivity, lack of concern and indifference to suffering sometimes associated with helping being seen as too costly. Cruelty, is a deliberate causing of suffering for pleasure or sense of power. This shows up in repressive regimes and our entertainments far more than we would like to admit.\n\nThis paper highlights that the evolution of caring behavior, through parent–infant investment, was a template for many forms of caring. Hormones such as oxytocin and vasopressin and a range of physiological changes such as to the autonomic nervous system and frontal cortex evolved with, and tune us into caring behavior (Porges, 2007, 2017; Mayseless, 2016; Carter et al., 2017). There is now considerable evidence that from the day we are born to the day we die the caring and sharing relationships we have with others around us effect our epigenetics, cardiovascular, immune and autonomic nervous systems, and multiple neural circuits underpinning health, prosocial behavior and happiness (for reviews Brown and Brown, 2015, 2017; Ricard, 2015; Seppälä et al., 2017). In addition, caring and sharing became the central social discourse in hunter-gatherer societies as a resource distribution strategy. In this social environment the phenotype for caring possibly became more flexible and variable and extended to the wider social relationships in which individuals matured (Spikins, 2015, 2017). Evidence for this is the fact that most forms of caring and compassionate behavior, be it toward kin, friends or strangers or even animals operate through the same physiological mechanisms (for reviews see Mayseless, 2016; Seppälä et al., 2017). If caring and sharing can be viewed as a phenotype(s) that varies in different contexts, can be linked to a particular resource distribution strategy, and impacts physiological systems, then we should see variations in the psychological and physiological manifestations of this strategy in different environments. To put this another way, some contexts will make us more oriented to caring and sharing and others more orientated to some forms of callousness, and this will show up in physiological as well as psychological processes. The evidence for this is growing as reviewed below.\n\nThe advent of COVID-19, and our local responses to it, have illuminated an outpouring of compassionate courage, a sense of interdependence, self-sacrifice and helpfulness. In addition, it has raised the issue again that many of us want a more compassionate, cooperative world, whilst recognizing the means to achieve this is unclear and fraught with problems, one being callousness. This paper will use an evolution informed, biopsychosocial lens to explore why moving to a more compassionate society would be beneficial for our physical and mental health, social justice, productivity, and prosocial behavior (Staub, 2003; Gilbert, 2009; Harari, 2014; Keltner et al., 2014; Kasser, 2016; Ekman and Ekman, 2017; Haslam et al., 2018; Piff et al., 2018; Ryan, 2019; Wilson, 2019; Biglan, 2020; Becker et al., 2021), but also the serious inhibitors to that movement (Gilbert and Mascaro, 2017; Wilson, 2019). These are partly in our evolution and partly in our cultures and history of agricultural societies.\n\nThe Challenges\n\nTo pursue caring and sharing, rooted in compassion as a public good, it is helpful to understand its facilitators and its inhibitors, which are many and various. Among the most daunting inhibitors include the facts that:\n\n1. The human brain has been rather cobbled together over a long evolutionary timeframe with various trade-offs and compromises plugged in along the way (Gilbert, 1998; Nesse, 2019; Workman et al., 2020). Much of our decision-making and “urges” are not based on rational choices, but the pursuit of life tasks evolved over millions of years with deeply ingrained, socially trained motives and emotions (Keltner et al., 2018). This means that:\n\n2. We are a species of extremes (Gilbert, 1989/2016, 2018; Marsh, 2019) with evolved strategies and potentials for helpful and prosocial behavior (Gilbert, 2009, 2020a; Keltner et al., 2014; Mayseless, 2016; Seppälä et al., 2017) but also extremely harmful, cruel, callous, and destructive behavior to self and others (Gilbert, 1989/2016, 1998, 2009; Black, 2016; Eisler and Fry, 2019; Zimbardo, 2008; Hobfoll, 2018; Nesse, 2019). If we consider our dispositions for war, slavery, torture, domestic violence, and violence as entertainment, and the ease by which we see other humans (and animals and nature) simply as a resource to be exploited, then with some exceptions, the last 5,000 years or more have been anything but compassionate (Rummel, 2002; Van Vugt and Park, 2009; Glover, 2012; Black, 2016).\n\n3. Since the advent of agriculture and expanding wealth and group size, we have created social contexts that are punitive, intimidating and often threatening with aggressive dominant males (and their small, immediate support networks) subjugating, exploiting, suppressing subordinates, and waging wars, along with colonial exploitation of other societies and cultures (Black, 2016).\n\n4. As part of that legacy, the creation of storable resources and wealth expansion generated by agriculture created intense competition resulting in huge disparities in wealth distribution and social power which today is extreme and damaging (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2010; Stiglitz, 2012; Harari, 2014).\n\n5. Since all dominant elites seek to protect their privilege and advantage, we also live in a world where today, the powerful and wealthy elites have disproportionate political power that has allowed them to undermine democracies and movements to social justice and fairness (Chomsky, 1992; Lipman-Blumen, 2005; Gilligan, 2011; MacLean, 2017) with continued use of violence and the threat of violence to maintain power, and exploit natural resources in extremely harmful ways (Pilger, 2007; Gilligan, 2011; MacLean, 2017; Hickle, 2018; Piff et al., 2018).\n\n6. As people become wealthier, they become less compassionate not more (Van Kleef et al., 2008; Piff et al., 2018). After a certain point, wealth changes us psychologically and physiologically such that our feelings of compassion and empathy go down (in other words we become more callous). At the same time we shift to a sense of entitlement, deservingness, and self-interest competitiveness and promote control and hold (not care and share) attitudes to resources. Wealthier individuals are more likely to cheat and deceive (Piff et al., 2018). In fact, the cheating and manipulation of the wealthy (e.g., tax avoidance and back room deals, use of the media) is a serious issue for compassion. We are becoming more narcissist and self-focused, not less (Twenge and Campbell, 2009) and our orientations to compassion (at least before COVID-19) are reducing, not increasing (Trzeciak and Mazzarelli, 2019; Harvard Graduate School of Education, 2020).\n\n7. Because our society needs to promote the production of goods and services as a source of employment and wealth creation we need to consume them and have become more materialistic. Materialism clearly supports the control and hold strategies to resource seeking and distribution but not without personal and social cost. Kasser (2016) points out “that people who place a relatively high priority on materialistic values/goals consume more products and incur more debt, have lower-quality interpersonal relationships, act in more ecologically destructive ways, have adverse work and educational motivation, and report lower personal and physical well-being. Experimentally activating materialistic aims causes similar outcomes” (p.489).\n\n8. In a recent major meta-analysis of a large number of personality traits linked to happiness and well-being, Thielmann et al. (2020) found the top traits were: trust, social value orientation, guilt-proneness (being sensitive to hurting others), honesty-humility, pro environmentalism, and concern for others. The traits that were least associated with happiness were those typically linked into the competitive orientation to life. These were: narcissism, envy, social dominance orientation (SDO), competitiveness, greed, psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and sadism. Given that the dark triad traits of Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and narcissism are overrepresented in the higher-levels of politics and business, one can see the social-wide problems we need to deal with (Furtner et al., 2017; Peterson and Palmer, 2019).\n\n9. While many espouse compassion as a moral value, individuals can also be fearful of it, resistant and block it (Gilbert et al., 2011; Gilbert and Mascaro, 2017; Kirby et al., 2019). Those with ruthless ambition, narcissistic traits and are hyper-competitive are particularly resistant to having compassion for others (Basran et al., 2019).\n\n10. We remain uncertain how to address the disproportionate power of the few who have tendencies to drive the serious dark side of humanity (Bakan, 2012; Black, 2016; Gilbert, 2018; Wilson, 2019). At an evolutionary strategic level, our brains are the battle grounds for two very different reproductive and resource distribution strategies which are caring and sharing versus controlling and holding and even our phenotypes may be different according to which of those gains ascendancy (Lepage et al., 2020).\n\nThe bottom line is that our extraordinary potential to be a caring species (Keltner et al., 2014; Ricard, 2015; Narvaez, 2017, 2020; Spikins, 2015, 2017) evolved in small groups where everybody knew everybody, resources were relatively scarce, and caring and sharing those resources was essential for survival and cementing affiliative relationships (Fry and Söderberg, 2014; Lavi and Friesem, 2019; Wilson, 2019). There is now considerable evidence that our brains and bodies “work best” in environments where we feel cared for and about, and feel we can make a contribution that others value (Gilbert, 2009; Brown and Brown, 2015, 2017, Seppälä et al., 2017). Nothing prepared us to deal with the consequences of developing agriculture and creating environments of expanding groups, the need to work long hours tending fields and farms, and opportunities to acquire, accumulate and store vast resources. Overtime we drifted into a very different type of resource regulation strategy, giving up a caring sharing lifestyle and replacing it with a resource owning, accumulating and power seeking, hierarchical one (Harari, 2014). Tragically for our species, this facilitated the re-emergence of the aggressive dominant male hierarchies who were able to stimulate highly destructive competitive behaviors, increased dispositions to callousness and cruelty, and maintain power through threats and terrors.\n\nIf we are to create a more compassionate world, that serves the common good (Ekman and Ekman, 2017), then much depends on how we formulate, contextualize and think about two issues. (1) Be much more engaged with the suffering in the world and how to address it, and as part of this (2) Address the challenges of “resource caring and sharing” versus “competitive controlling and holding” (Piff et al., 2018). We will need new ways to think about how we can create social contexts that fit our needs for cooperation, caring and sharing to address many of the serious problems we face; climate breakdown, disease control, economic inequality and the need for social, gender, and racial justice (Helliwell et al., 2012; Wilson, 2019). We vote for leaders who appeal to our own desires to control and hold rather than care and share and therein lies one of our difficulties (Lipman-Blumen, 2005; Mols and Jetten, 2020). Compassion, caring and sharing will require sacrifice of some of our personal material wealth for social wealth and health. To pursue this endeavor we can explore the evolution and dynamics of caring, sharing, and compassion, how we evolved the potential to be a compassionate and courageous species but also the nastiest, vicious and cruel (Gilbert, 2005, 2018; Black, 2016).\n\nOrigins and Flows of Caring and Compassion\n\nResearch in the field of prosocial behavior and compassion has accelerated greatly in the last 10 years (for reviews see Seppälä et al., 2017). As a result Mascaro et al. (2020) highlight the fact that there are now slightly different conceptions of compassion and different ways of measuring it. Nonetheless, all recognize compassion is about our orientation to be helpful rather than harmful, and empathically engaged rather than callously indifferent to the pain and suffering of self and others. One evolved route to our motives and competencies to be compassionate is from phylogenetically ancient forms of caring for offspring (Gilbert, 1989/2016; Geary, 2000; Gilbert, 2005, 2020a,b, Goetz et al., 2010; Brown and Brown, 2015, 2017; Mayseless, 2016; Carter et al., 2017). One function of parental caring is to be sensitive to distress and needs of offspring and try to address them. Hence, we can define one function of caring and its “derivative” compassion quite simply in terms of its underlying motivation and “if A then do B” algorithm where “A” would be some signal of distress, suffering or need and B would be the response and actions to address them (Gilbert, 2020a,b). This gives rise to defining care and compassion as “a sensitivity to suffering in self and others with a commitment to try to alleviate and prevent it” (Gilbert, 2017b,c). Needs are important in compassion because if they are not addressed suffering will clearly follow (Gilbert and Choden, 2013).\n\nLike compassion, callousness can have slightly different definitions and is used in slightly different ways (e.g., in forensic settings) but here I define it as the opposite of compassion; as an insensitivity to suffering and an indifference to its alleviation or prevention (Gilbert, 2005, 2018). In addition, we can see these as dimensions and contextually influenced. We can be compassionate in some contexts but callous in others and the degree and intensity of compassion and callousness can vary too. Poulin (2017) also reviews evidence where we can be very sensitive to suffering but actually not do anything about it. How that falls on the compassion callous dimension is unclear.\n\nAs a motive, compassion is not dependent on emotion. Whether you are an anxious firefighter risking your life to save others, an angry fighter of injustice or experiencing sadness as you counsel the bereaved, all these have one motive in common: the motive to turn toward suffering or need, be prepared to develop the courage to experience the threat, distress or pain involved, and develop the wisdom of working out what would be helpful. Sometimes compassion can be a logical or moral choice as much as an emotional one (Loewenstein and Small, 2007). And our reasons for behaving compassionately may have multiple sources both conscious and unconscious (Böckler et al., 2016; Bargh, 2017). Despite these complexities core processes of compassion show up in physiological and psychological domains.\n\nPhysiologies of Caring\n\nOver millions of years, in many species, care given and received evolved to have major impacts on the functioning of the autonomic nervous system, the immune and cardiovascular system, and neurophysiological (brain) circuits that play fundamental roles in self-identity and self-experience, emotion regulation, and prosocial or anti-social behavior (Gilbert, 1989/2016, 2017c; Keltner et al., 2014; Music, 2014, 2017; Brown and Brown, 2015, 2017; Mayseless, 2016; Carter et al., 2017; Porges, 2017; Seppälä et al., 2017; Stevens and Woodruff, 2018; Di Bello et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020a,b). Relationships are physiological regulators (Hofer, 1984, 1994). Changes to the autonomic nervous system, particularly the myelination of the 10th cranial nerve of the parasympathetic system to become the vagus nerve, played a major role in how the caring relationship came to regulate threat processing (Porges and Furman, 2011; Porges, 2017). It now looks as if the parasympathetic rest and digest system, which regulates (sympathetic) threat and drive states, was incorporated into the systems for close-relating thereby enabling the signals emanating from a parent (caring other, close friend) to have soothing, vagal-mediated qualities on an infant (Porges, 2017). One measure of the efficiency of the vagus nerve is called heart rate variability. There is good evidence that the functioning of parasympathetic system as measured by heart rate variability plays a major role in prosocial behavior and caring and compassion in general (Keltner et al., 2014; Petrocchi and Cheli, 2019). In contrast poorer functioning of the vagus nerve and balancing of the autonomic nervous system, as measured with lower heart rate variability, is associated with less cortical control over basic emotions increased vigilance to threat, aggressiveness and decreased prosocial behavior (Lepage et al., 2020). As noted below these distinctions are important when we come to explore variations between sharing and caring strategies and controlling and holding ones.\n\nPorges (2007, 2017) has written extensively of how the vagus nerve became part of a circuit that was very sensitive to facial expressions and voice tones, particularly those indicating friendliness and safeness. Indeed, today, the way we look at, share facial expressions and play with children all indicate our intuitive understanding of how our voices and facial expressions impact on them. We change these signals when we are engaged with adults, but nonetheless, we intuitively understand that friendship signals (and lack of it) are conveyed through voice tones and facial expressions.\n\nThe hormones oxytocin and vasopressin also played a crucial role in the evolution of caring behavior for infants, pair bonding and close friendships (Carter et al., 2017). In fact, there is now considerable evidence that kindness and compassion from others, when we are under stress or experiencing losses have significant emotional and physiological regulating effects (Steinbeis et al., 2015; Cassidy and Shaver, 2016; Mayseless, 2016; Seppälä et al., 2017). Rockliff et al. (2011) found the nasal oxytocin made it easier for people to imagine a caring other being caring of them. Morhenn et al. (2012) found that receiving touching massage reduced stress hormones and increased oxytocin. In social mentality theory (Gilbert, 2017a), both the giving and receiving of signals impact similar systems. Hence we are biologically set up with systems designed for the giving and receiving of care.\n\nIn addition, priming people with memories of caring others or seeing caring behavior can impact on physiological systems involved with stress and the way people cope with stressful events (Norman et al., 2015). Individuals who sense themselves as living in supportive, caring communities are in different physiological states than individuals who are in threat-focused communities or see the world as “a dog eat dog” place where you cannot trust or rely on others to help you (Perry et al., 2013). The general sense of being contextualized in caring and socially safe versus socially unsafe environments may well be crucial for many psychological processes (Kelly et al., 2012; Armstrong et al., 2020). Variations in the oxytocin gene may also link to variations in compassion and prosocial behavior versus callousness (e.g., Tost et al., 2010; Marsh, 2019). If watching others being caring or being harmful has such powerful effects on us, then we really do need to take another look at our entertainments that more commonly depict characters as narcissistic, argumentative and aggressive rather than fun, loving and friendly.\n\nThe Phenotypic and Epigenetic Effects of Caring\n\nEpigenetic science is important because it helps us understand how different contexts result in different trait phenotypes. For example, all humans are motivated to form some kind of attachment with their caregiving figures early in life. However, the way they experience them e.g., as caring, neglectful, or abusive has profound effects on the attachment phenotype(s). Some will grow to be trusting and secure in their attachments, others are anxious and vigilant to rejection; yet others become dismissive and avoidant of close interdependent relationships. In other words, social experiences shape phenotypes via epigenetic effects which in turn impacts the maturation of numerous physiological systems (Cowan et al., 2016; Slavich, 2020). So important is received caring behavior that it actually impacts epigenetic profiles even in fish. McGhee and Bell (2014) studied three-spined sticklebacks where fathers provide the care and protection. They note that:\n\nDuring the approximately two weeks that fathers provide care, they defend their nest from predators, fan the nest with their pectoral fins to provide fresh oxygen to the embryos and once the embryos hatch, retrieve fry that stray from the nest. During this period, offspring rely on yolk reserves provisioned by their mother prior to fertilization. Fathers do not feed offspring, but there is evidence that offspring antipredator behavior …., mate preference …. and morphology …. can be sensitive to the effects of fathers. (p. 2)\n\nThey go onto discuss how paternal caring influences traits, such as anxiety in offspring, that impact on their survival and how paternal caring influences the epigenetics of their offspring. Indeed, it is now known that across many different species the quality of parental caring impacts epigenetics and can attenuate or amplify vulnerabilities to threat sensitivity and sociality (Cowan et al., 2016; Music, 2017; O’Donnell and Meaney, 2020; Slavich, 2020). But it is not just the care received in the parent infant dyad. There is also increasing evidence that social contexts, particularly contexts of poverty and stress, can have long-terms epigenetic effects (McDade et al., 2019). Rightly or wrongly those favoring intense lockdowns have paid little attention to the epigenetic effects on children growing up in stressed families, social disengagement, and lacking education. Concerning too is increasing evidence that epigenetic changes can be inherited and passed to subsequent generations (Cowan et al., 2016; O’Donnell and Meaney, 2020). The implications of this are profound and still to be fully acknowledged because it means that the societies that we have been creating since agriculture may well have been affecting our epigenetic profiles. We are faced with the possibility that different cultures create different phenotypic patterns in the individuals living within them. Hence, for example, it is possible that Roman societies that accepted gladiatorial games and the harsh use of slaves were indeed phenotypically different to us.\n\nA Challenge: The Expense\n\nThere is however, a rather a big hitch to the evolution of caring and sharing. They work well in reciprocating groups of familiar others but did not evolve as a general giveaway. The problem with all motives, including caring motives, is that they are “energy” expensive and costly. Evolution has therefore built in its own criteria for dispensing it, sometimes referred to as different forms of altruism (Burnstein et al., 1994) and reciprocal altruism (Gintis et al., 2003; Colqhoun et al., 2020). Mothers of most species will only care for their own infants, not for others. In the case of sheep, for example, it can be very difficult to get a mother to adopt an orphan. While adoption does occur in mammalian species, it is rare; humans, who foster and carry out other forms of caring, are exceptional in this regard (Spikins, 2015). The evolution of the genetics of caring predisposes us to focus on those closest to us. For example, imagine we go to maternity to have our baby delivered and they take our baby away to weigh it and come back and say, “we have some good news and some bad news.” The bad news is we have lost the name tags and are not sure whose baby belongs to which parents. But the good news is the babies born this morning are in perfect health, so please feel free to choose the one you fancy.” Clearly, this would be a source of immense distress because we are programmed to care for our own genes, not strangers. Furthermore, if we have an opportunity to save our own children or 40 children down the road, who are we going to save? Also if we have opportunities to lavish vast resources on our own children at Christmas or send that money to children who are starving or lack clean water, who are we going to choose? It is not impossible for us to overrule these evolutionary preferences, but we need to understand them and what we need to do if we want to overcome them (Geary, 2000).\n\nAlthough oxytocin is often regarded as a hormone important for bonding, it is also a hormone that makes mothers aggressive to potential threats to their offspring (Carter et al., 2017) and can power outgroup (defensive) aggression too (De Dreu et al., 2011). Evolution has built-in tendencies for us to be interested in caring and sharing with those that we are likely to know and have a reciprocal relationship with, those we like or trust, rather than those we do not. In addition, oxytocin can make us more sensitive to suffering for in-group members, but this has a potentially tragic downside. It can also make us more vengeful to those who have harmed our group (Han et al., 2020), and group vengeance is responsible for considerable violence. Physiologies do not point to simple solutions.\n\nIf we are going to create a more sharing, caring and compassionate world, we need to understand these inhibitors blocking our orientation to compassion (Gilbert and Mascaro, 2017). This is where we need to use our intelligence and override emotional dispositions or prejudices. Loewenstein and Small (2007) argue that if we rely solely on our emotions of sympathy and ability to empathize, we will exercise only limited compassion. Compassion has to be powered in part by moral values and understanding its value, not just our innate reactions. It also has to be socially valued and socially reinforced through cultural norms and expectations. Just as we can have a sense of biological kinship, so we can have a sense of psychological kinship. We are more likely to be caring to those who we see in that category. Importantly, as some spiritual traditions encourage, we can train our brains to conceptualize humanity as part of our “kin group” (Bailey, 2002). Right wing politicians however are more interested in splitting and setting one group up against another.\n\nAnother aspect of compassion is that it is linked to altruism. Altruism requires individuals to be prepared to make sacrifices to help people. Helping people that does not have a cost or can benefit you in the long term is questionable as to how altruistic it is (Colqhoun et al., 2020). Interestingly, therefore although helpful behavior has been observed repeatedly in young children Green et al. (2018) investigated how helpful they would be if there were a cost. They found that children would help a hand puppet achieve a goal of completing a task (e.g., puzzle) if there was no cost to them, but helping fell away significantly when they had to give up something to help the puppet. Even when the puppet made appeals and was clearly distressed, the child still would not give up their own resources or rewards to help the distressed puppet.\n\nThe Psychological Functions of Caring\n\nHaving looked at the physiological and epigenetic effects linked to evolved caring motives, we can now turn to the psychological functions of caring. Parents provide many resources to their infants including food, thermoregulation and protection. In addition, they offer major psychological supports. One of the major models for understanding these supports has been attachment theory (Bowlby, 1969, 1973, 1980, Cassidy and Shaver, 2016; Music, 2017). This describes how parents provide their offspring with a secure base from which the young can begin to play, explore, and return to for guidance and support. Second, they provide a safe haven acting as soothing and comforting stimuli when the young are distressed or needy, thus helping to regulate the infant’s need/frustrations, arousal and emotions. Third, the child and parent seek to maintain proximity to each other and when separated become concerned and seek each other out (Cassidy and Shaver, 2016). As noted, these experiences can also profoundly influence the maturation of physiologies and epigenetic profiles.\n\nEvery time the child experiences others as caring, encouraging or soothing to them, they learn to turn to others when in distress. The regular experience of these means that children develop trust in others and an interest in relating to others. In addition, when caring parents show pleasure and joyfulness in their child, the child experiences themselves existing positively in the mind of others and becomes attuned to the environments their parents provide. These processes carry powerful epigenetic and physiological effects as noted above (Cozolino, 2014; Music, 2014, 2017). To put this another way, evolution has created organisms, such as ourselves, who fine tune their epigenetics and physiologies (phenotypes) according to the niche they are going to have to operate within. Put crudely, developing affiliative, trust, and dispositions to be sharing will not be helpful if the environment is going to be competitive, callous, full of down rank threats, and cheats.\n\nTragically when these important brain nutrients of care, compassion, and love are not received, and children are on the receiving end of low warmth, neglect, or abuse, it has devastating impacts on the brain, epigenetics, and subsequent development (Lippard and Nemeroff, 2020). The suffering of the Romanian children in orphanages tragically brought home just how important affectionate caring was to the development of the brain (Chugani et al., 2001). In fact, there is now considerable evidence that our basic strategic orientation (particularly on the dimensions of “helping and concern for others” versus “lack of concern for others”) is partly set in our life histories (Del Giudice, 2016). This is set out in Figure 1.\n\nFIGURE 1\n\nFigure 1 is referring to dimensions, not absolutes which can be fluid and change over a person’s life or from situation to situation. On the left-hand side, cared for children experience their brains and minds developing and orientating to a range of motives, emotion, dispositions, and competencies to pursue a caring and sharing lifestyle. On the right hand are children growing up under threat (lacking a secure base and safe haven). They find their minds developing strategies for a very different type of life and social niche; for a more “hard fought” life; a competitive lifestyle where one is wary of people and certainly cannot trust others to be helpful, sharing or caring. In this social niche, there are two strategic options (Del Giudice, 2016). Many primates (although much less so bonobos) living in hierarchical groups show that under competitive pressure there is a branching into two different strategies. One is to adopt a ‘damage limitation, lower risk of injurious conflict, better safe than sorry, a down rank type strategy of submissiveness, and lack of confidence.’ This increases the risk of depression and anxiety. It may fluctuate somewhat depending on how secure and safe subsequent relationships are, but these individuals can be very sensitive to feeling failures and inferior compared to others, socially marginalized and often carry a sense of loneliness and disconnection (Gilbert, 2000, 2020a). These individuals can be caring, but this can be because they want to be liked and avoid rejection (Catarino et al., 2014; Böckler et al., 2016).\n\nThe other strategy in contexts of low care is a riskier up rank strategy, to really push one’s luck, display confidence (perhaps even grandiose), seek power and accumulate resources, foregoing sharing caring strategies. These are linked to certain types of narcissism and psychopathy both of which involve toning down caring and sharing motives (Del Giudice, 2016). One version links to a sense of entitlement to treat others as a resource, and in the extreme regulate their relationships through fear. Many of the people in our prisons did not have good starts and their capacities for empathic connectedness to others is limited. It is also the same for some of our politicians and the higher up you go in business, the more you will find the rank focused callous folk who can be superficially charming, but have little interest in caring and sharing (Furtner et al., 2017; Peterson and Palmer, 2019). Can these individuals be turned to change these fundamental evolved strategies that are running their show? It is unclear, but there are glimmers that compassion training, which involves specific techniques to stimulate care-focused social mentalities, by helping people process some of the neglect and harshness they themselves experienced, is proving an exciting potential intervention for forensic youth (e.g., Ribeiro da Silva et al., 2019, 2020). Shirtcliff et al. (2009) show that individuals who are callous are not emotionally in tune or physiologically responsive with their own emotional pain. Hence, physiological systems involved with “sensitivity to emotional suffering” are “offline,” meaning that because they are not in tune with or responsive to their own emotional suffering they unable to be sensitive to any signals of pain including those they cause others. However, keep in mind that mentalities are co-regulating and therefore if individuals can start to process their own pain and their unmet needs to have been cared for, this might open up that social mentality. It does not open up unless those inner care receiving systems are worked with; trying to help them feel a sense of remorse or guilt when their own emotional pain systems are closed down may fail. Indeed Compassion Focused Therapy (Gilbert, 2010, 2020a), is less focused on changing basic beliefs and much more interested in motivational and phenotypic switching, along with building physiological pathways and networks that facilitate the caring social mentalities (Gilbert, 2017a, 2020a,b). The degree to which that is possible is the next major challenge in psychotherapy development and research (Cozolino, 2017; Gilbert, 2019b,c, 2020a).\n\nThere is however a twist to this and that is that being born into wealthy parents is also associated with the forms of narcissism that can make individuals unsuited as leaders (Martin et al., 2016). It is unclear if this is a direct effect of wealth or the fact that wealthy parents have different types of relationships with their children. There is some evidence to suggest that wealthy parents find parenting less meaningful and maybe less emotionally engaged with it preferring money making (Kushlev et al., 2012). Wealthy parents are more likely to send their children to boarding schools with negative consequences (Schaverien, 2015). Parental emotional distancing maybe the issue. Then there is the well-known narcissism that comes from simply being spoilt and having few boundaries put on them; growing up completely disengaged from the experiences and the realities of poorer people for example. Living in a world of plenty may not support developing empathy for suffering because one rarely encounters it; or if one does, it tends to be trivial, like having a tantrum because one cannot have the size of birthday party one wanted. Wealth may be a hindrance to developing empathy for suffering (Piff et al., 2018).\n\nWhatever the origins of narcissism, the human brain needs considerable stimulation of feeling safe and cared for along with developing respect and concern for others to mature into the kind of ethical caring and sharing individual we so need as a species (Gilbert, 1989/2016; Slavich, 2020). Nothing is inevitable and of course people from difficult backgrounds can become wonderful examples of compassion and people from good backgrounds can become villains. Nonetheless, the extraordinary way in which our bodies, genetic profiles and minds are so linked to our environments is a message that politicians are still ignoring probably because the cost of really taking this on board is evaluated by them to be high. Tax cuts rather than children’s brains are more important. Prosocial and antisocial tendencies are potentials within all humans to some degree or other, give or take a little genetic variation here and there. Individuals simply find themselves maturing into these strategies in response to the relationships in which they are embedded. Children do not wake up one Saturday morning and choose which one they are going live by; that they could be an altruist but then think “that is boring I will train to be a narcissist.” It is all about how our brains and epigenetic profiles automatically pattern themselves in different environments (Del Giudice, 2016).\n\nFrom Caring to Compassion\n\nSpecies with high levels of parental caring evolve complex cognitive competencies, whereas those that do not, do not (Uomini et al., 2020). Over time, these cognitive competencies change the way basic motivations are experienced and expressed. Certainly, by the time of homo sapiens, the potential to use our reasoning minds for inhibiting or accentuating a motive is extraordinary (Byrne, 1995; DeFelipe, 2011). We become capable of orientating caring toward medicine, developing anesthetics, antibiotics, ridding the world of smallpox, and extraordinary keyhole surgery. Unfortunately, the same competencies can be used for planning wars, building nuclear weapons and designing new tortures.\n\nWe have at least three different types of cognitive competencies that give rise to different insights and wisdoms (Gilbert, 2019a, 2020a).\n\n1. Reasoning insights: First, we have certain types of reasoning that enable us to understand and have insights into complex causalities, system relations and ‘how things work.’ We can imagine and run what if… and suppose/imagine that… simulations in our mind. We can think about the past and future and plan, not just days, but years ahead (Suddendorf, 2018; Baron-Cohen, 2020). And we accumulate knowledge at an increasingly exponential speed so that we can anticipate that our science will be very different in 100 years to what it is now. This is the basis of the scientific mind that put people on the moon.\n\n2. Empathic insights: Empathy is a competency, not a motive (Gilbert, 1989/2016; Decety and Ickes, 2009; Baron-Cohen, 2011). It can be used by any motive. If you want to manipulate somebody, if you want to be good at developing new relationships or dating, you are much more likely to be successful if you are empathic, than if you are not. While empathy certainly helps caring behaviors we may not need to understand the exact nature of somebody’s suffering to want to help them. Whether men and women can understand what it is like to be the other gender (e.g., have a baby) is uncertain; the degree to which white middle class people understand experiences of racism is also uncertain; the degree to which white middle and upper class politicians understand the real daily struggles, fears and despairs of the poor is uncertain. Nonetheless, in these situations we can be empathic to the fact that we might struggle with empathy and therefore we need to listen and learn and not make assumptions about our understanding. It is the motivation to be caring that is crucial. Without a caring motive empathy can be used for selfish, deceptive, and manipulative goals (Bloom, 2017).\n\n3. Consciousness of consciousness insights: Third, we have a new type of consciousness of consciousness: we can be aware and know that we are aware. This facilitates extensive self-awareness and opportunities to become mindful and observant of our own minds (Gilbert and Choden, 2013; Brown et al., 2015). Learning to pay attention to what is going on in our minds, so that we can gain more control over its outputs is one of the great challenges of humanity. Unfortunately, without care, self-awareness can also be a curse and the source of egoism, shame, depression and narcissism and considerable harmfulness to ourselves and others (Leary, 2007).\n\nPeople can be good at some of these competencies, but not others. For example, some individuals are brilliant scientists, but are very poor at empathy. Indeed, talented scientists or business people can also be somewhat lacking in empathy or be on what is called the Asperger’s spectrum, which has implications for how they understand social needs (Baron-Cohen, 2011, 2020). Some politicians may have these tendencies too. Others can have excellent empathy skills, but they will never be able to win a Nobel Prize for physics, be entrepreneurs or make good politicians. Some individuals can be very bright, but not have much insight into their own minds or an ability to be mindful; whereas mindful people are not necessarily the most empathic, intelligent or caring. Indeed, recent research has shown that mindfulness, empathy and compassion skills can be trained differently and influence different brain systems (Singer and Engert, 2019). Training our minds for global compassion, therefore, is going to be a multi-focused task (Dalai Lama, 1995; Ekman and Ekman, 2017).\n\nCollectively these competencies give rise to what we can call knowing intentionality (Gilbert, 2018, 2020a). It is doubtful whether any other species can engage motives knowingly in this way. Lions clearly intend to hunt and kill their prey, but not with self-aware knowing awareness. They cannot suddenly decide not to do it, become vegetarians or to lose weight. Knowing intentionality has probably been one of the most important human competencies that have powered science and built the cultures we have. It is knowing intentionality and the use of these human cognitive competencies that turns basic caring motives into compassion. This is depicted in Figure 2.\n\nFIGURE 2\n\nThe domain of knowing intentionality, however, is also tricky because many of the reasons we behave in the ways that we do are partly unconscious (Huang and Bargh, 2014; Bargh, 2017). Nonetheless, humans do have opportunities to gain insight into the nature of “mind” (Baron-Cohen, 2011; Siegel, 2016) and then choose to develop compassion motives and a compassionate identity; to live to be helpful, not harmful (Dalai Lama, 1995; Gilbert, 2009; Ricard, 2015).\n\nA further distinction should be made. Caring can be used for many non-sentient objects and beings, whereas compassion cannot. For example, we can talk about caring for our gardens, homes, cars or prized possessions, or our planet, but we do not use the term compassion for that type of caring because these are not sentient and do not experience suffering. Hence, the root of compassion is in the caring motives, textured by our unique minds (DeFelipe, 2011) and awareness of suffering (Gilbert, 2009). So, this brings us back to the fact that compassion is the intentional desire to be “sensitive to suffering in self and others with a commitment to try to alleviate and prevent it” (Gilbert, 2017a). Many animals may care for their young or others, and ants may carry their injured colleagues back to the nest (Kessler, 2020), but only humans as far as we know have this knowing intentional awareness and can develop deep wisdom of how to be helpful – can develop science and medicine or seek the politics of caring. This is profoundly important because it means that compassion is an intentional desire to bring caring into our relationships, into our world, into our politics, into our businesses, and we can use science and research of how best to do those. Using our new intelligence can change our social discourses and thereby over time change our phenotypes.\n\nThe Flows of Compassion\n\nImportantly too compassion has a three-way orientation. In addition to giving care to others, being compassionate with oneself and being the recipient of compassionate care, resource sharing and support has many profound impacts on us psychologically, physiologically and our social behavior. The quality of caring we receive, from the day we are born to the day that we die, has a huge impact on many indicators of physical and mental health, longevity, and prosocial behavior (for major reviews see Thayer et al., 2012; Seppälä et al., 2017). Being the recipient of, and open to, emotional and compassionate support from others has long been linked to a buffer against mental health problems (Hermanto et al., 2016). Remembering or bringing to mind individuals who are caring and supportive helps people cope with stress (for review see Norman et al., 2015; Gilbert, 2020a). Although there are different definitions of self-compassion there is now substantial evidence that self-compassion and self-reassurance buffer against depression and facilitate coping with setbacks and life difficulties and promote wellbeing. In contrast, harsh self-criticism, fears of being self-compassionate and fear of accepting compassion are associated with increased mental and physical health problems (Kirby et al., 2019).\n\nLast but not least, as emphasized repeatedly in Buddhist teachings (Ricard, 2015), and confirmed by considerable research, the more we orientate ourselves to be helpful to others rather than self-focused, the happier and healthier we are (see Crocker et al., 2017; Seppälä et al., 2017). In addition, general fears and resistances to being compassionate to others is associated with hyper competitiveness, narcissism and ruthless self-ambition (Basran et al., 2019); traits not untypical of power seekers (Peterson and Palmer, 2019). In a major review on what they call motivated “otherness” or “selfishness” Crocker et al. (2017) highlight how being compassionate to others, and feeling one has a contribution to make, has major emotional and physical benefits in comparison to self-focused competitiveness. Hence, the evidence for all three flows of compassion is that they are profoundly important for our physical, mental and social well-being.\n\nDespite this, many individuals perceive compassion as a weakness or softness and rather than promote compassionate values for society, promote competitive self-interest (Sachs, 2012). We are at a point now where it is not a matter of political opinion or preference but creating our societies for the common good should be based upon the science of what creates it. One of the problems with understanding compassion and how we miss its fundamental attributes of complex variations according to context, and the central role of courage and wisdom is that it is often confused with other prosocial behaviors. For example, compassion is not the same as kindness because compassion involves degrees of courage and wisdom in ways that kindness does not; the emotions associated with kindness tend to be positive whereas those associated with compassion are more difficult; and compassion often involves sacrifice (Ricard, 2015). For example, this is not a religious point but we talk about the compassion of Christ not the kindness of Christ (Gilbert et al., 2019). Nor is compassion the same as the western concept of love with which it is sometimes confused. The strongest forms of compassion are for people we do not love or even like. And compassion is sometimes confused with submissiveness that we simply have to accept or give in to harmful behavior. Nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, in a well-functioning society one would have a well-functioning “compassionate” police force and an agreed set of laws. Without agreement on what we mean by compassion it is going to be tricky to have it widely adopted particularly for those individuals who think it is somehow a costly nicety, soft or weak when in reality it is the most morally wise and courageous of all of our motives (Lampert, 2005).\n\nSummary\n\nWith these insights and concepts on compassion we can see how compassion is profoundly important to so many aspects of our lives; texturing epigenetic profiles, multiple physiological systems and psychological values plus how we relate to each other. Consider the passions of people engaged in charity work all over the world, building wells for freshwater, making medicines available to the poor, or in international peace efforts trying to end the conflict and release perhaps millions of people from the intense suffering of the conflict. Consider a recent movement of “compassion in politics” which seeks to stop politicians passing laws that are known to cause suffering to the least able to cope (see below). Note too that some people can be very impassioned for some domains of caring and compassion but not all; motives can be specific. And some people can be very good in some aspects of compassion but not others. Our courageous firefighter might not make the most empathic partner or parent and an empathic counselor may not make the best firefighter or international negotiator. Many different talents therefore can be utilized to work in different contexts and with different types of suffering.\n\nA Multi-Mind of Conflict and Uncertainties\n\nMotives, Emotions, and Algorithms\n\nOne theme of this paper is that to understand and promote compassion requires us to step back in time, look into how the brain evolved and gain insight into its multiple motives and algorithms that can conflict and be difficult to regulate in the modern world. We can start by noting that organisms evolve because they confront and adapt to the two challenges of life of survival and reproduction (Buss, 2019; Workman et al., 2020). These challenges give rise to all living things that face three basic life tasks. They have to be able to identify and defend themselves against threats in their domain of existence. They have to be able to seek out the resources that will sustain them and help them to reproduce. Third, they have to be able to identify when they are not under threat and have sufficient resources to allow them to rest and digest. Ways of building a compassionate society will have to address how we go about all three basic life tasks and motives because they are the ones that are involved in both control and hold and care and share. To state it briefly and somewhat simply, control and hold have both elevated threat linked to losing control over resources and elevated drive to obtain them putting their own security in their own hands. Care and share are seeking a more hunter gatherer lifestyle where the joys of life and security are in the hands of others. Especially important will be helping people experience emotional states of contentment and connectedness rather than feeing a need for ‘more and more’ (Naish, 2008). We can look at each of these in turn.\n\nThreat, protection/defense motives are run by threat based algorithms of, if a threat is detected then (for example) stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, increase heart rate, focus attention and then run like hell (or perhaps engage in a fight). We now know quite a lot about the physiology of the threat algorithms and how they can be primed, textured and regulated through early life experience and social context. In addition, there are specific emotions that support this motive. These are: anger (fight), fear/anxiety (flight), and disgust (expel). When threats are overwhelming and cannot be controlled animals and humans can go into shutdown depressed states (Gilbert, 1992/2016, 2020c). Our thoughts, beliefs and values can also regulate our sensitivity to threats and the actions we take. We can greatly amplify, ruminate and stimulate our threat systems by what we think but we can also attenuate and override them. We might feel very anxious taking a driving test, but we overrule that anxiety and take it because we have a high motive/desire to drive. Indeed, the regulation of emotion, particularly potentially harmful emotions, is crucial to maturation and wellbeing. So we might feel desires to be selfish or even harmful but we can override them with sufficient insight and compassionate intention (Loewenstein and Small, 2007; Ricard, 2015).\n\nOne of our most important insights is that the threats we are faced with today are very different from the hunter-gatherer threats. Those threats, of having sufficient to eat for example, were solved with caring and sharing. Today however, we are unable to hunt and gather and are totally dependent on work, the making of objects and things that may have very little personal relevance only to provide money to gain access to resources. And we have to work to please our bosses or to meet the requirements of the job (deadlines and work flows) which puts us under constant vigilance of judgment by others who may deem us worthy of promotion or demotion. Agriculture increased the amount of time spent in work (Harari, 2014) and so today we have far less time for family and socializing than working (Bunting, 2004). So today our lives are considerably more chronically stressful and threat focused but in very different ways to a hunter gatherer lifestyle. For many centuries the threat and stress of trying to survive in these artificial environments has been intense and we now know that these types of stresses had major impacts on physiological systems. In addition they make us less charitable, less compassionate and more self-focused with group favoritism and aggressive defenses (Steinbeis et al., 2015).\n\nIndeed, there is increasing evidence that those on the right wing of the political spectrum see the world through the lens of the threat system. Right wing authoritarianism (RWA) is associated with highly threat sensitive perception of the world even a slightly paranoid view (Wodak, 2015). We have not the space to review this literature here but can refer to one study that captures important themes of this threat. Shaffer and Duckitt (2013) found that an exploratory factors analysis identified five distinct fear–threat factors linked to RWA. These were:\n\nHarm to Self, Child, or Country; Personal and Relationship Failures; Environmental and Economic Fears; Political and Personal Uncertainties; and Threats to Ingroup. All the fear–threat factors were correlated with RWA, with the strongest correlations being for Threats to Ingroup, and with stronger effects for social than for personal fears (p. 6).\n\nAlthough the data on early attachment experiences and these fear based orientations to the world is a little thin, it is probable that some of them were set up for this fear-focused phenotypic orientation because of problematic backgrounds. One of the most salient dimensions underpinning shifts into control and hold (and away from share and care, in both the poor and the wealthy but for different reasons) is the perception of threat. In the wealthy it is the threat of losing what they have, and in the poor is the threat of not having enough. Both types of threat sensitivity can make us manipulable to threat messages and tribal aggression (Hobfoll, 2018). Many authors have also highlighted how both politicians and the media seek to stimulate these threats as the sea for them to sail into power and create complex interactions between the minds of leaders and the minds of those supporting them (Mols and Jetten, 2020).\n\nCompetitive resource seeking motives focus on obtaining and gaining resources conducive to flourishing, survival and reproduction. The orientation is approach rather than avoidance and the associated emotions tend to be positive with the desire to repeat the actions. Fredrickson (2013) suggests the evolved function of positive emotions is to broaden and build one’s resource base. Given that, then positive drive emotions will work quite differently in hunter-gatherer societies compared to western, high resource, competitive societies. Most animals and early humans do not store or accumulate resources. Hence drive emotions were very much to secure resources for immediate use and therefore “turn off” when what is needed is obtained. The level of need was the regulator of drive and once basic needs had been met one could then focus on other rest and digest activities, play, creativity and socializing (Lavi and Friesem, 2019). Today we are still very motivated to socialize and to share positive (smiles and jokes) emotion, be at parties, celebrations, and to come together for joint tasks (e.g., as observers of sport, music, cinema, and so forth; hence the tragedies of lockdown). However, we are also very preoccupied with our access to wealth and resources.\n\nThe general consensus is that unlike us today, stressed out by work and the need to maintain ourselves in work, hunter-gatherers worked less, spent more time socializing, were relatively peaceful and affiliative in their relationships and more likely to experience contentment (Fry and Söderberg, 2014; Harari, 2014; Ryan, 2019; Hunt, 2020). These living styles have their own physiological profiles and supports health (Cordaro et al., 2016). In these states, the body is able to repair itself, and long term is associated with health (Thayer et al., 2009) and prosocial “care and share” behavior (Keltner et al., 2014). Agriculture however was to change all this because it introduced storage and that meant that there was no limit to drive behaviors because there is no limit to how much one could store and gain control over; “working to acquire” took on a whole new time consuming process (Bunting, 2004). And it was not long before more dominant individuals enticed more subordinate individuals to work for them. We were on an exponential curve to resource accumulation and the beginnings of the hierarchies of wealth and power. Overtime, the wealthy turned other human beings into slaves and continually drove down ‘wages’ to ensure dependency, but also excessive hours of toil to survive. Nothing like this existed before agriculture. Last but not least some of this excessive pursuit of resources is threat based, the fear of losing or falling behind (Basran et al., 2019; Jetten et al., 2020).\n\nSocial Mentalities, Caring and the Conflicts of the Mind\n\nIt is clear that caring behavior is only one basic social motive amongst many others. Social motives have been called social mentalities because they are different to non-social motives, and can only be satisfied within an interaction; that is you need a partner to co-create them with you (Gilbert, 1989/2016, 2017a). This means they have to co-evolve. Now, of course, much in evolution is actually a process of co-evolution, such as predator-prey, disease-host. However, for social behavior, co-evolution occurs because there are benefits to that interaction for both parties. Sexual behavior can only evolve if individuals can both send signals and be responders to signals sent to them. There is not much point of male Robins evolving a red breast if the females are more interested in shades of purple. Sending a signal and receiving a signal in a specific mentality, in this case sexuality, stimulates the reciprocal physiological systems in participants whether the individual was first a receiver or sender. This is not to deny that nature also has a lot of coercive sex. Dominant subordinate behaviors can only evolve if dominant individuals threaten in a particular kind of way and subordinates have evolved the inner algorithms for submissive behavior, which when expressed turns off the attack in the dominant. Indeed, it is generally accepted now that it is the subordinates that regulate the hierarchies through their preparedness to submit under threat (Gilbert, 2000). Importantly, animals do not learn how to submit, that is part of their algorithm, but as they grow, they test the waters and increasingly, as they get stronger and bigger, fight back and challenge for resources.\n\nAn evolved social mentality that can block caring, and pattern the mind in a completely different way in terms of what it pays attention to, what it aspires to, what activates positive emotions and turns off empathy and concern for others, is self-focused competitiveness. This is particularly the case because part of the competitive algorithm is to suppress and inhibit the competitive behavior and claims (resource seeking, and needs) of others. Competitive behaviors vary according to whether contestants are in-group or out-group. When many primate groups meet, they can engage in war like behavior and injure each other (Bonobos are different, Tan et al., 2017). In intergroup violence submissive behavior is not that effective. We see this in humans as well. We can be vicious to out-group members regardless of whether they are showing signs of submission or not (Staub, 2003; Zimbardo, 2008). In centuries past, the vanquished were executed sometimes brutally or sold into slavery; they become an enemy to be removed or a resource to be used. As noted below, competitive behavior has that disposition to turn any other lifeforms including humans into resources to be used and exploited.\n\nAlong with care and share another counter to unregulated competitiveness is cooperative behavior, something humans excel at Wilson (2019), but there are different dimensions to it (Gilbert, 1989/2016). For example, the way we cooperate in our intimate relationships utilizes different physiological systems than when cooperating with strangers to produce a particular outcome or to regulate a conflict. In humans, cooperation also emerges out of an empathic understanding of intentionalities linked to intersubjectivity and trust. I climb the tree to bend the branch so you can get the apples but trust you not to “cheat” and run off with all of them! The issue of cheating where individuals take far more than their fair share of resources in the pursuit of control and hold would have been a major problem in hunter-gatherers and was very definitely shunned. However, it is quite the opposite in capitalist societies where not only is there no criteria for deciding “fairness” because that has been abandoned as a human endeavor in capitalist societies, but wealth differentials are actually status symbols and aspired to Wilkinson and Pickett (2010); Wilson (2019). Indeed, the legitimization and justification for taking far more than one’s fair share is a hallmark of capitalist societies (Sachs, 2012).\n\nWhat is common to all these processes is that when we engage in social behavior, we are engaging in reciprocal, dynamic dances that are physiologically powerful and regulating, and stimulating different evolved algorithms in the mind. These “dances of our physiologies,” choreographed through our verbal and non-verbal expressions and communications, are regulated by different processing systems with different feature detectors. As we will note later, these dances are also socially contextualized and choreographed.\n\nFigure 3 gives a brief overview of one way to conceptualize social mentalities. Each social mentality has specialist feature detectors to attend to different arrays of stimuli, picking up cues that are important and relevant to that particular motive and social mentality. For example, for sexual behavior we need specific sexual detectors, but for food, we need specific food detectors. We are not necessarily conscious of how our feature detectors are attuned to the environment (Bargh, 2017). Hence, each motivational system has its own algorithm with feature detectors that links into both specific and general physiological patterns. These are not Lego-like, but pertain to different combinations of different neurotransmitters, hormones, brain circuits and so on; different patterns of activation. For example, imagine your child is distressed and you are engaging caring behavior. Consider how your mind is patterning itself: what you are paying attention to, what you are rehearsing and imagining (what could the distress be?), what your impulses for actions are, what is happening in your body, to your heart rate, and are you remembering ways to be helpful? You would also be monitoring the degree to which what you are doing is addressing your child’s distress/need. If, on the other hand, you are the child, so you are the one distressed or needing and seeking care, then those processes will be different. For the moment by moment dance of your interactions to have an impact, there will be an attunement of interactions such that the caring behavior given is appropriate and the child physiologically responds in a way that is helpful to the child. Some of these co-regulating interactions of physiological systems are microseconds. Because of the way the human face has evolved, even an eye flash or slight smile can have quite a profound effect on an individual’s perception of friendliness or not. In fact, there is now a growing and fascinating literature on what is called interpersonal synchrony and this synchrony emerges out of the dances of communications and are physiologically synchronous. Child parent synchrony predicts altruistic behavior later in life (Cirelli et al., 2014).\n\nFIGURE 3\n\nEssentially then, social mentalities have co-evolved such that individuals can be receptive to the signals indicating a person’s motivation intent and then respond appropriately. This is the basis of role-sensitive empathy (Liotti and Gilbert, 2011). Some individuals can be very sensitive to say critical or hostile cues, but do not pick up particularly on emotional distress in others, whereas some people are the other way around. While social mentalities evolved for direct interactions, humans have also adapted them for use in wider groups including with strangers. The issue then becomes the degree to which a stranger is perceived as irrelevant, a threat, a potential resource, co-operator or requiring assistance.\n\nThese interactions are contextualized in social and cultural patterns that impact in complex ways on these interpersonal interactions and have a major influence on the manifestation of different social mentalities. At its simplest, in caring and sharing environments, individuals are orientated toward friendly, caring and sharing interactions, whereas in competitive environments the way we pay attention in our social milieu, how we reason, the way we wish to present ourselves to others, and the fear of how other people may see us, will be quite different (Gilbert, 2018). These concepts enable us to see how different social mentalities, that form the basis of interpersonal dances, and thereby physiological regulation, are culturally contextualized. Indeed, one of the major choreographers of the kinds of interpersonal dances created by our social environment in general is linked to the resource competition strategies that promote or demote either control and hold strategies or caring and sharing ones.\n\nConflicts\n\nA central driving process of evolution is conflict (Buss, 2019; Wilson, 2019; Workman et al., 2020). Right now, many species are in conflict with us because of how we use them for food, experiment on them, even deliberately altering their genes, and driving others to extinction. Whether it be it in parent–child, romantic partners, friendship hierarchies, and groups, it is the handling of conflicts of interest and conflicts of desires that is essential for how that relationship works. Here the quality of the relationship is important. For example, the way we care for our own children is quite different from how we care for the children of strangers. How we compete with our friends will be quite different to how we compete with those seen as competitors or enemies. Crucially then, the major sources of conflict throughout evolution are over resources and resource availability and access. Here, social contexts play a huge role. How conflicts of self-interest are dealt with in hunter-gatherer societies is very different from how they are dealt with in highly competitive, hierarchical, resource-rich societies such as ours (Ryan, 2019; Wilson, 2019). The ancient care and share versus control and hold strategies not only create different contexts for conflict but also indicate the means of resolving them. Put crudely, in caring and sharing environments it is to reach an equitable arrangement, in a hierarchical environment it is “the most powerful wins” and suppresses the needs of the subordinates.\n\nImportantly too, in order to deal with conflict, different strategies have to turn on some motives, algorithms and emotions and turn off others. For example, if we want to go to war, then we have to turn off caring motivation and concern with the suffering toward these other human beings seen as a threat or the enemy we want to kill and maim. We can actually be pleasured and excited by their pain; have a rush of dopamine when we “take them out.” Clearly, in contrast to everyday forms of relating or with friends, if we are in a caring social mentality and saw that we had caused pain to another, that would be distressing. Generally speaking, much is done to stop us becoming aware of the intense misery we cause others in our wars, callous competitive behaviors, in sweatshops in far off countries and factory farms. Highly competitive motives tone down caring social mentalities (Piff et al., 2018; Basran et al., 2019). In addition, they inhibit empathy and being distress sensitive and steer us toward callousness, becoming insensitive to the suffering of others or even seeing them more as a resource to be exploited than to be nurtured or empathically connected to.\n\nEven before Freud, we knew that the mind was riddled with conflict, with some motives and emotions able to suppress others. This is because different motives have different priorities and different physiological systems of activation (Ornstein, 1986; Huang and Bargh, 2014). Importantly then, motives and social mentalities can conflict and inhibit each other. This is important when we think about the social contexts that suppresses compassionate motivation and create brain states in interacting individuals that tone compassion down.\n\nSummary\n\nThe essence of the story so far then is that we are biologically designed with a whole suite of potential motives and social mentalities which organize our minds and bodies. We think these are all under our control, but in reality, they have been designed and evolved to be sensitive to the social contexts and niches we grow up in and have to function in Wilson (2019). While we are hard-wired for caring and sharing (Keltner, 2009; Ricard, 2015; Narvaez, 2017, 2020), we are also hard-wired with potentials to be a much nastier species. We now have insight that a major choreographer of these potentials that affect us all, right down to our epigenetic profiles and physiological organization, is resource allocation strategies and the management of the conflicts of interest. Just as we know we have phenotypic plasticity in the sense that any evolved motive can manifest in different ways, we know that cultures can have phenotypic variation too. While some cultures can support caring and sharing, others clearly do not (Black, 2016).\n\nHunter-Gatherers and the Emergence of the Caring and Sharing Lifestyles\n\nThe caring social mentality (to provide care and support and be responsive to the needs of others) has been evolving over hundreds of millions of years, traceable in many ancient species and with the lineage of physiological processes increasingly well understood. The next piece in the puzzle, of how we became potentially one of the most compassionate species that have ever existed, and became highly regulated through our social relationships and need for connectedness, is the emergence of the hunter-gatherer group (Harari, 2014; Spikins, 2015; Lavi and Friesem, 2019). How the caring social mentality became recruited as a social focus and a basic cultural form for interactions, resulting in elevating sharing and caring relating, and offsetting earlier dominant male and aggressive hierarchies as ways of distributing and gaining control over resources, is one of our salient questions (Boehm, 1999; Lavi and Friesem, 2019). Not only that, but compassion was very much part of this with the archeological record showing that early humans were very concerned with the suffering of others and cared for the sick and injured (Spikins, 2015, 2017). It seems there were many factors that came together that shifted us into a caring sharing species and for the most part suppressing aggressive competitiveness. Below are some of them.\n\nChildcare\n\nThe way in which the caring social mentalities became a prominent form of social relating in humans occurred in various and curious ways. One of our human adaptions was upright walking, but this was to narrow the birth canal right at the time when the baby’s head was evolving to get bigger. Two things happened. One was that birth became dangerous and painful, and indeed hunter-gatherers had/have high mortality. Second, human infants require considerably longer parenting and socially interactive parenting that facilitates huge transformations during development. The way we adapted to these realities played a role in the shift toward our caring and sharing style of living. Narvaez (2017, 2020) has written extensively on how the social contexts of human parenting and provisions of parents to their children are very different from today (see also Hrdy, 2009; Music, 2014; Ryan, 2019). Although hunter-gatherers parenting styles differed, there is general agreement what the common characteristics were.\n\nCare of the Mother and Alloparenting\n\nUnlike any other animal, a woman trying to give birth by herself could easily run into problems. In parts of the world where medical services are scant, infant mortality can be tragically high, and indeed was high in hunter-gatherers. Birthing and subsequent caring, therefore, requires extensive support, commonly given by female relatives (Hrdy, 2009). Mothers would exist in these supportive networks of kin relatives before and after pregnancy.\n\nNetworks of women would also act as protectors and infants were passed around between grandparents, aunts and sisters, thus, the infants’ brain was responding to multiple social interactions; seeing many smiling faces and hearing kind voices. These would all be stimulating care focused physiologies (Porges, 2017). Throughout the child’s life many individuals would be a source of comfort and guidance. This is called alloparenting which is defined by parental functions (care, protection, provision of food, comfort play) as provided by those other than parents (Hrdy, 2009). Indeed, it is possible for children to seek out others in preference to their own parents if the parent relationship is not such a good one. Alloparenting is not unique to humans, but it was during our hunter gatherer stage that it became a highly adapted, even essential trait (Narvaez, 2017). Not only did it provide the infant/child with multiple interactions that facilitates complex social learning, a sense of social safeness and social engagement, but it provided resources to the parents particularly the mother, giving her time to pursue social activities and rest. A less stressed mother will have better interactions with her offspring than a stressed ‘coping alone’ mother. In essence the basis of our social brain would have been highly supported through the ecology’s of hunter gatherer alloarenting.\n\nContrast Alloparenting With Today\n\nMany women today do not have access to these important kin/community supportive networks that would have been available 24/7. They are more likely to have midwives that visit them occasionally or deliver their children in impersonal hospitals by strangers. After birth if there is no close family nearby, women will lack extensive female support and may spend many hours alone waiting for partners to return from work; and not all partners are that supportive or adequate replacement for female kin networks. This is grossly abnormal and robs both infant and mother of important, multiple sources of support (providing both with a secure base and safe haven).\n\nMother and infant should be seen as a co-regulating couple who both require care in contextualized supported networks. Depression among mothers is much lower in societies that operate strong kin supportive networks (Hagen, 1999). To put it in another way, isolation and lack of caring support increases risk of depression. A depressed mother, coupled with a lack of alternative sources of care and stimulation, can have serious consequences for her maturing infant. To build a society focused on the common good would prioritize childcare as fundamental to our societies to cultivate prosocial minds. It is truly a tragedy that so many children grow up, trapped in homes with frightened, frightening and disengaged parents that will profoundly affect the maturation of their brains. COVID lock downs have made this much worse, the consequences of which will not be known for some years and probably never fully will.\n\nExtensive Breastfeeding and Cohabiting\n\nIn hunter-gatherer societies, infant mortality was high, but those who survived childbirth would then experience extensive breastfeeding for up to 5 years. They would be carried – having skin-to-skin contact with the mother – and sleep with or close to the parents. The key issue is the caring physical contact that impacts physiologies (Mayseless, 2016).\n\nThe Importance of Touch\n\nFor many primates, touch, particularly in the form of grooming, has soothing effects (Dunbar, 2014). Indeed, touching massage impacts on oxytocin and reduces stress hormones (Morhenn et al., 2012). For the most part, close physical contact with mothers is common, but for humans, so too was contact with other members of the group (Hrdy, 2009). This meant a child had multiple sources of joy, physical comfort, and play. For infants, children, and adults, physical contact from trusted and loving others is one of the most important sources of soothing (Carter et al., 2017). Sadly, in modern society, teachers are warned off physical contact for comforting children for fear of prosecution – to the extent that they cannot even rub in protective sun cream or hug them when they are distressed. The fear of pedophilia is shocking and tragic. Western society has become almost touch averse. When my wife had our daughter Hannah 38 years ago (unfortunately by cesarean because of a breech) she would lie on the bed with Hannah on her chest. On a number of occasions, the nurse warned us not to do that because Hannah would “get used to it” and “become demanding.”\n\nPaternal Behaviors\n\nIn birds, both parents often co-operate and take on the task of feeding and protecting. Not so with primates. For most primates, males play very little role in the care of offspring and do not know who theirs are. However, humans are a notable exception. Changes in the facial morphology of evolving humans suggest a trend toward feminization, and a changing role of testosterone, associated with increased caring and social affiliation behavior within groups (Cieri et al., 2014). Muller et al. (2009) compared two African groups showing that high and low parental investment groups differed in testosterone levels in predicted directions. Laboratory studies of human fathers have also shown complex relationships between oxytocin, testosterone and paternal caring (Weisman et al., 2014). Crucially the way testosterone affects male behavior and status seeking is linked to context. In some contexts, testosterone is linked to status by aggression, but in others, by altruistic caring (Sapolsky, 2017). Varela et al. (2018) found that skin to skin contact with their newborn babies significantly reduced stress hormones in fathers. While avian species share parental caring and therefore are likely to be mutually physiologically influenced by contact with their infants, this is not the case for primates and is probably a specific human adaptation. Indeed primate mothers will not allow any other to hold their infants and in this regard humans are unique (Hrdy, 2009).\n\nOne obvious implication is that human males evolved to interact with infants and children differently to other primates. Therefore men should be provided greater opportunity to care and interact with their children and other children and interact with supportive female networks, as would have been typical for many hunter-gather groups. Pair bonding in hunter-gather society is uncertain and males would often not know who their children were (Diogo, 2019; Ryan, 2019), but many showed high interest in and care for children, although the ecology influences this (Gilmore, 1990). Today, we are still exploring the important role fathers have on child maturation. The same goes for siblings, aunts, and uncles. The idea that a male should be absent for most of a child’s upbringing, returning home from an office tired and grumpy to an isolated mother and child, is a gross abnormality (Narvaez, 2020). For some fathers, COVID lockdown has given them new opportunities to interact with children and discover new ways of relating.\n\nLack of Harsh Punishment\n\nIndividuals are socialized according to the demands of the ecology. In dangerous ecologies, where men have to be relatively fearless, the social organization tends to be harsh, including to children (Gilmore, 1990). However, when in a benign environment, it is a different story. Many anthropologists believe that hunter-gatherers were averse to physically punishing or threatening children (Music, 2014; Narvaez, 2017, 2020; Ryan, 2019). Yet in post hunter-gatherer societies, and not very long ago, slave, wife and child-beating were allowed and legitimized and even promoted as a method for control (Gilbert, 2018). Even today, corporal punishment is still allowed in some countries. Caning was a regular practice in my boarding school of the 1960s.\n\nCooperation and Sharing and Caring\n\nCooperation makes hunting more efficient and this is true for various predators such as wolves, hyenas, monkeys and dolphins as well as humans. Humans extended cooperation into many domains of activity including cooking, building and making, and sharing of knowledge, which were facilitated through language. The most important driving force for language would be the sharing of information and knowledge. Indeed, teaching, which language facilitates extraordinary well, is phenomenally important to humans (Gilbert, 1989/2016). As noted below, status was not given to narcissistic self-accumulations, but altruistic sharing. What stands out too is the enjoyment of shared activities such as cooking and eating, which remains one of our greatest joys. In fact, hunter-gatherers worked far less than we do now and had happier lives (Ryan, 2019; Hunt, 2020).\n\nIn general, early human egalitarian behavior seems to have evolved under a number of conditions (Lavi and Friesem, 2019). First, rather small groups (150 or less that advantages reciprocity and other social processes; Dunbar, 2014). Second, a relative absence of storing, holding and controlling resources in favor of mobility and obtaining and sharing resource for immediate use (Lavi and Friesem, 2019; Ryan, 2019). Third, a sense of social belonging and social safeness was linked to displays of altruism, caring and sharing. Status was gained by being useful to others. Narcissistic, aggressive and exploitive forms of competitiveness were shunned. What became important was competing for attractiveness – to have a reputation as an altruist. This would make you attractive to others as a friend, ally, reciprocating partner and desired sexual mate. It is the domain of audience choice (Barkow, 1989; Gilbert, 1997, 2007). Fourth, as noted above, evolved changes to the birth canal from upright walking meant human birthing necessitated help and care through pregnancy and beyond (Hrdy, 2009). There was a significant shift in child-caring practises. Child care was highly interactive, non hostile, gave children a sense of interpersonal security and taught respectfulness, emotion regulation skills and the ‘joys’ of sharing.\n\nIt was the extensive kin networks that provided for children the opportunities to grow up with a secure base and safe haven, rather than being dependent on single parents that was crucial and different to other primates (Hrdy, 2009). Tragically today, many children are growing up bereft of these extended caring social contexts and indeed can be subjected to their polar opposites: neglect, hostility, criticism, and abuse (Lippard and Nemeroff, 2020). It is well known that many people who go on to have mental health problems and/or become power-seekers, anti-social or criminal often come from troubled and non-supportive or threatening backgrounds. Given that we have known about this for so long why, we might ask, have we allowed this pandemic of poor caring that generates millions of damaged minds to continue to operate? One reason (as we will see) is because control and hold strategies focus on individuals as “units unto themselves” who have to look after themselves and cannot turn to the community for support. It is a tragedy and a disaster because frankly, the world has been and is being run by quite damaged minds (Green, 2005; Lipman-Blumen, 2005; Owen, 2008, 2020; Black, 2016).\n\nSumming Up\n\nEvidence suggests that humans adapted their physiological and cognitive systems for extended and extensive parent-infant caring (Hrdy, 2009) and these became a template for a range of social relationships, particularly in small groups. While caring and sharing in hunter-gatherer societies had a number of sources including conflict resolution and prevention, compassion as “the desire to intentionally help others in need and care for them” was certainly one of them (Spikins, 2015, 2017; Kessler, 2020). The basis of this is partly because the same hormones and patterns in the autonomic system underpin all forms of caring. Indeed, many argue that we are hard-wired for caring and sharing even, in certain contexts, with strangers (Keltner et al., 2014); that our basic nature is caring and sharing (Ricard, 2015). This was partly honed in hunter-gatherer groups where it works well and is a source of joy, social safeness and meaning. We can plot the genetics, epigenetics, physiologies, and brain patterns of caring and how caring became the rich textures for compassion. Indeed, if you think of how compassion can operate to steer us to risk our lives to save others, it is probably one of the most courageous and potentially wise of motives. Caring and sharing has a phenotypic profile that is choreographed in caring environments. In non-caring environments however the caring and sharing phenotypes are very different Here phenotypes orientate the brain toward the opposite of sharing caring and compassion that is callousness and the dark side. One note of caution should be added here. This is that we have been talking about the biological evolution of caring, but when the Buddhists talk about ‘compassion as our basic nature’ they are much more into the nature of consciousness itself and transpersonal realities rather than biological ones.\n\nParadise Lost: Contest Competition and the Pursuit of Power\n\nThe Development of the Terrorist State and Hierarchical Societies\n\nMany researchers recognize that we have created social and ecological contexts that are very different to those in which we evolved, and in many ways we are quite mismatched to our new environments with unfortunate costs (Li et al., 2017). The more laidback and socially integrative lifestyle of the hunter gatherers can be very tragically contrasted with the 10,000 years or so which have not gone so well (Glover, 2012; Harari, 2014; Black, 2016). Armed with our amazing cognitive competencies and intelligences, that we honed in hunter-gatherer, caring and sharing environments, we turned these against ourselves to become the nastiest, most vicious, cruel and violent species to have ever existed on this planet. One of the great challenges for compassion is not to be naive about humanity and to recognize that we have a truly terrifying dark side. Hence, we need to keep in mind the challenges we face in turning our societies around and recognizing just where they have come from.\n\nThe basic story is relatively straight forward and one that many researchers agree on; it was the advent of agriculture that drove us a little crazy (Harari, 2014; Black, 2016; Gilbert, 2018). Our intelligence allowed us to recognize that rather than eat all our seeds, we could plant and cultivate them and could herd and cage animals. Resource availability spiraled but also, we became locked into areas of pasture, reliant on grown crops not gathered ones, letting go of the mobility and immediate use lifestyle. One of the most salient issues was that we went from an immediate use to a storage way of living and that changed the drive system as well as raised issues of who controlled what was stored. And if I can store things for myself then maybe I do not need to rely on reciprocation quite so much. So, agriculture changed our hunter-gathering lifestyles of relative immediate consumption, reciprocity and status via altruism into stay put, create and store surplus and enable power hierarchies to control surplus. Humans themselves become trapped in completely new social ecologies (Mann, 1986), which in many ways have driven us a little crazy and we do not really know how to get out of the trap our minds are now caught in Gilbert (2018). The work-time demands of agriculture and the social consequences of it almost certainly changed our bodies, brains and phenotypes. One of the major consequences was to promote the emergence of intense callousness and cruelty, as outlined below.\n\nTerrorism as Means of Control\n\nAs group size and resource value expanded, there was a re-emergence of aggressive, dominant (mostly) male hierarchies, the suppression of subordinates, and at times the vicious suppression of subordinate alliances against the hierarchy. The elites increasingly devised terror to suppress opposition internally and to terrorize enemies. Many leaders have left the defeated vanquished, tortured, executed, raped, and sold into slavery. The Geneva Convention is recent and sadly as conflicts in Syria and other places have shown rarely followed! Today we think that terrorism is relatively new, but throughout a lot of our history we have been ruled by terrorists and terrorism. Consider the Roman Empire. If you were born a slave, your life was horrendous and certain crimes were punishable by crucifixion, forced to fight in the “games” or torture. Around 72–71 BC Spartacus, who had been sold into slavery, instigated a slave revolt. Although the historical record is understandably hazy, it is generally believed that a particularly vicious and psychopathic Roman commander one Marcus Licinius Crassus defeated Spartacus and crucified all 6000 combatants lining the road with their crosses. He would often utilize a typical terror tactic within the army, such that soldiers seen as cowards or who had committed some other crimes would be beaten to death by their colleagues. Julius Caesar, another rather unpleasant character, instigated basic genocide throughout Europe. Indeed, the history of the Roman Empire is riddled with leaders and political schemers who were bad and mad. However, many European countries have been the same. Many Kings and Queens of England have been tyrants (Green, 2005). It was only a few hundred years ago that, you could be picked up off the streets and chain ganged into the Navy and if you committed a crime, you could be forced to make your own cat-o-nine tails that would be used to flay you, often to death, or Keelhauled (Rogers, 2007). Just two months earlier, you were with your family in Plymouth! There was also a time when you could be hung for simply stealing food. Over the centuries, vast numbers of people were hung for relatively minor crimes (Gilbert, 2018). The history of slavery is a vicious and callous one; perpetrated by minds that saw another human being as nothing other than a resource. Tragically, there are still many humans that view other humans like this. Today, we have discourses on colonialism and patriarchy, but these pale in comparison to human institutionalized terrorism, which up until recently has been endemic and in some states still exists; in governments and criminal gangs alike. There are still far too many governments with leaders who find it acceptable to lock up, torture and make political opponents disappear and the numbers are sometimes terrifying.\n\nMany leaders have had quite serious mental health problems and personality disorders that have had major consequences for their leadership and what they enticed countries to do (Green, 2005). This is true for modern leaders as well (Freeman, 1991; Owen, 2008). Today too, there are powerful leaders showing signs of serious personality and mental health problems (Owen, 2020). Individuals who come from brutal backgrounds engage in control and hold strategies in very brutal ways and have changed the course of history and even the genetic complexion of humanity. Genghis Khan (1155–1227), who became the leader of the Mongol Empire was one such. He had a cruel and particularly brutal upbringing that filled him with rage and vengeance and would have left his phenotype for caring and sharing severely undeveloped. He became one of the most ruthless, vicious, sadistic leaders in history; responsible for the most horrendous deaths and rapes of many millions. His primary motivation was vengeance and absolute power so that no one could ever threaten or hurt him again. “Hurt people hurt people” as they say and he and many like him show that on a grand scale. However, as an evolutionary strategy, he was a success. He sired many children, quite possibly thousands by his many wives and others he raped. Such activity may well have affected gene frequencies in populations today. Consider one study by genetic researchers (Zerjal et al., 2003):\n\nThe Y chromosome of a single individual has spread rapidly and is now found in ∼8% of the males throughout a large part of Asia. Indeed, if our sample is representative, this chromosome will be present in about 16 million men, ∼0.5% of the world’s total. The available evidence suggests that it was carried by Genghis Khan. (p. 720)\n\nNow, I am not a geneticist and this is an extremely complex area, but again, we need to take seriously the possibility that since the advent of agriculture and the rise of aggressive males (and their kin) who came to dominate resource holding strategies, certain alleles have been spreading through human populations. What, one wonders, has the history of wars done to our phenotypes given that so many with gentler temperaments, suited for hunter gatherer groups, were frequently slaughtered by invading armies. As just one example, for hundreds of years, the Romans regularly engaged in genocide wiping out many peaceful groups. Does this increase the frequency of potentially ruthless ambitious phenotypes getting control of power and then causing havoc, which they have throughout history and are now still doing (Wrangham and Peterson, 1996)? Groups that adopt control and hold strategies and competition for control are ideal breeding grounds for psychopathic tendencies (Black, 2016). We need to come to terms with the fact that there have been many leaders in history that have changed the world (and us) for the worst and still are.\n\nWe often draw our thoughts of terrorism quite narrowly but actually terrorism can be defined as the way power is used to frighten, intimidate, bully, hurt, even torture others to control them. Abusive parents can terrorise their children, abusive religions can terrorise their followers with threats of punishment in hell or other nasties; burning heretics etc. Terror using states allow leaders to imprison and at times torture political opponents. Stalin was an obvious recent example who did this on a huge scale, but tragically there are many states in the world today where leaders use terror tactics to control the population and quell opposition. The freedom to control and hold can create problems, but the freedom of free speech is essential to promote a compassionate world. Once again compassion has to address the dark side of humanity and recognise how closely it stalks us.\n\nGroup Violence\n\nMuch has been written on group violence and the nature and origins of war (Black, 2016; Sidanius et al., 2017; Hobfoll, 2018). In many primate groups (but not Bonobos; Tan et al., 2017), aggressive clashes occur at the boundaries, so group on group violence is relatively endemic in primate groups where they meet each other. Humans have been different, to the extent that hunter-gatherers developed networks over large geographical areas. In addition, rather than being aggressive and war like, before the advent of agriculture, for the most part the evidence suggests that hunter-gatherers did not encounter each other that often and when they did preferred peaceful coexistence with each other (Fry and Söderberg, 2014). It used to be thought that we exterminated Neanderthals, but now it turns out we have got Neanderthal DNA (apparently 4% of mine is Neanderthal) meaning that we engaged them sexually and part of their demise was possibly climate change,\n\nAgain, many researchers suggest that it was expanding group size (facilitated by agriculture) that created large(r) tribes who in turn began to encounter one another and covet each other’s land and resources; or at least their dominant elites did. Group on group violence has been the source of some of the worst atrocities and most extraordinary cruelties, particularly in how the vanquished are treated (Black, 2016; Hobfoll, 2018). It is also the source of what may eventually extinguish humanity if we do not control it. Today, truly vast resources are spent on maintaining and building local and national armies, weapons, and weapon research (including the horrific prospect of robot armies), far more than on medicine. Some countries literally bankrupt their country in the pursuit of arms! Margaret Thatcher an archetypal ‘hold and control’ politician was a great "
