        "text": "City in Connecticut, United States\n\nCity in Connecticut, United States\n\nDerby is a city in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States, approximately 8 miles (13 km) west-northwest of New Haven. It is located in southwest Connecticut at the confluence of the Housatonic and Naugatuck rivers. It shares borders with the cities of Ansonia to the north and Shelton to the southwest, and the towns of Orange to the south, Seymour to the northwest, and Woodbridge to the east. The city is part of the Naugatuck Valley Planning Region. The population was 12,325 at the 2020 census.[3] It is the smallest city in Connecticut by area, at 5.3 square miles (14 km2).[4]\n\nDerby was settled in 1642 as an Indian trading post under the name Paugasset. It was named after Derby, England, in 1675.[5][6] It included what are now Ansonia, Seymour, Oxford, and parts of Beacon Falls.\n\nDerby is home to the first electric trolley system in New England, only the second in the United States. It is also home to the first electric locomotive in U.S. history to be built and successfully used commercially for hauling freight. The locomotive, built in 1888, is still kept in running condition by the Shore Line Trolley Museum.[7][8]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nColonial and Revolutionary era\n\n[edit]\n\nDerby was settled in 1642 as an Indian trading post under the name Paugasset by John Wakeman of New Haven, though fur traders had been in the area before and Native Americans had lived there for centuries. In 1651, the first year-round houses were completed, at which time the New Haven Colony had recognized Paugasset as a town. The residents of the town of Milford protested Paugasset's recognition as an independent town and, as a result, the order was rescinded and Paugasset returned to the Milford jurisdiction. In 1675, the former plantation of Paugasset was admitted as the township of Derby by the state legislature, named after Derby, England.[9] Derby was incorporated on May 13, 1775.[10]\n\n1800s\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1836, the Colman brothers began the Birmingham Iron Foundry on the corner of Main Street and Water Street. It employed between 100 and 125 people, and was one of the many manufacturing businesses thriving in the city in the 1800s. In 1927, the company merged with Farrel Corporation of nearby Ansonia and was renamed Farrel-Birmingham Corporation. The Derby facility closed and was razed in 2000 to make way for a Home Depot. The Ansonia division is still in business, and opened their new plant in the Fountain Lake Commerce Park in 2017.[11][12]\n\nIn the 19th century, corsets and hoop skirts were manufactured in the city. The Kraus Corset Factory is the oldest major factory building to survive from Derby's corset manufacturing period. It was built by Sidney A. Downs, opened in 1879, and expanded in 1910. In 1987 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In the 1990s it was converted to apartments and underwent a second addition; a first floor parking garage and three stories of apartments were added on the north side along Roosevelt Drive (Connecticut Route 34).[13]\n\nIn 1872, the Derby Silver Company began production. In 1898, the company became a division of the International Silver Company headquartered in Meriden, but continued making silver with its brand name until 1933.[14][15][16]\n\n1900s\n\n[edit]\n\nCharlton Comics, a comic book publishing company that existed from 1944 to 1986, was based in Derby.\n\nTowns created from Derby\n\n[edit]\n\nOxford in 1798\n\nSeymour in 1850\n\nBeacon Falls in 1871 (also partly from neighboring towns)\n\nAnsonia in 1889\n\nNeighborhoods\n\n[edit]\n\nDowntown\n\nWest Derby\n\nDerby Neck\n\nEast Derby\n\nHilltop\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 5.4 square miles (8.7 km2), of which, 5.0 square miles (13 km2) is land and 0.4 square miles (1.0 km2) (7.41%) is water. The city is home to the 417 acres (0.652 sq mi) Osbornedale State Park. Derby is divided into two main sections by the Naugatuck River: East Derby and Derby Center (Birmingham). The center of Derby is approximately 66 miles (106 km) from New York City. The lowest elevation is 3 ft (1m) and the highest elevation is 466 ft (142m) above sea level.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe climate in the area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Derby has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \"Cfa\" on climate maps. January is on average the coolest month and July is on average the warmest month.[17]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 17902,994—18001,878−37.3%18102,0519.2%18202,0881.8%18302,2537.9%18402,85126.5%18503,82434.1%18605,44342.3%18708,02047.3%188011,65045.3%18905,969−48.8%19007,93032.9%19108,99113.4%192011,23825.0%193010,788−4.0%194010,287−4.6%195010,259−0.3%196012,13218.3%197012,5993.8%198012,346−2.0%199012,199−1.2%200012,3911.6%201012,9024.1%202012,325−4.5%\n\nAs of the census[21] of 2010, there were 12,902 people, 5,388 households, and 3,241 families residing in the town.

Derby is located in New Haven County, which has one of the highest percentages of Italian-Americans in the United States.[citation needed]\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nAnnual events\n\n[edit]\n\nDerby Day\n\nConcert on the Green\n\nDerby Green Farmers' Market\n\nDerby/Shelton Memorial Day Parade\n\nHead of the Housatonic Regatta\n\nValley New Year\n\nDerby/Shelton Fourth of July fireworks\n\nEaster Egg Hunt\n\nSummerfest on the Green\n\nMuseums\n\n[edit]\n\nOsborne Homestead Museum\n\nGeneral David Humphreys House Museum, Derby Historical Society headquarters (located in Ansonia)\n\nCuisine and nightlife\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city is home to 27 food establishments[26] from fast food to sit-down dining.\n\nConnecticut Magazine, the New Haven Register, and the Hartford Courant named the Dew Drop Inn \"Best Chicken Wings in Connecticut, 2018\", \"Best in New Haven County, 2019\" and \"Statewide Runner-up for best Chicken Wings, 2019\", trailing only J5's Air Fryer Wings of Southington. Archie Moore's Bar & Restaurant received \"Statewide Winner for Best Nachos, 2019\" from Connecticut Magazine.[27][28] Zuppardi's Apizza, a prominent New Haven-style pizza restaurant, has a satellite location on the property. For three consecutive years (2017–2019), the venue was named the \"Best Beer Garden\" in Connecticut by Connecticut Magazine.[29][30]\n\nIn 2017, BADSONS Beer Company, a craft brewery, purchased the former Manger Die Company on Roosevelt Drive to begin production. The name of the brewery is an acronym for the towns the comprise the Naugatuck River Valley: Beacon Falls, Ansonia, Derby, Seymour, Oxford, Naugatuck, and Shelton.[31][32]\n\nEconomics\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2017, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the city's bond rating from AA to AA−, citing \"weak budgetary performance\" in 2016.[33]\n\nGrand list[34]\n\n2016 – $1,028,072,826.82\n\n2010 – $1,091,576,401.00\n\nMill rate[35]\n\nFiscal Year (FY) 2019 – 39.37\n\nFiscal Year (FY) 2010 – 26.40\n\nNotable businesses\n\nAqua Vim (future) – aquarium manufacturer undergoing move from Queens, New York to Derby[36]\n\nCharlton Comics (1944–1986) – comic book company based in Derby\n\nCurved Glass Distributors (1970–present) – glass manufacturer based in Derby\n\nDerby Silver Company (1872–1933) – international silver company based in Derby\n\nGriffin Hospital (1909–present) – community hospital, largest employer in Derby, with 1,357 employees (2010)[37]\n\nTHC – The Hops Company (2015–present) – voted Connecticut Magazine's best Beer Garden in Connecticut 2017 and Best Beer Bar in Connecticut 2017–2018[38]\n\nRedevelopment projects\n\n[edit]\n\nFactory Street Square\n\nIn 2018, a development group working with the owners of the Baretta Landscaping property submitted a conceptual design to the planning and zoning commission for a four-phase 400-unit high density residential and commercial development on Factory Street in downtown Derby. The project, called Factory Street Square, was to be built in four phases over the next four to six years on unused light industrial property. The proposed buildings would sit on five acres of near-vacant land, and would be four stories high with first floor retail shops and restaurants, with residential space above. The project, tailored toward attracting Millennials and empty nesters to the area, will offer amenities not seen in other residential complexes in the city, including a health club; indoor golf simulator; rooftop garden; dog-sitting, walking, and grooming service; and an in-complex library. The site is located one block from rail and bus lines that meet at the Derby-Shelton Railroad Station, making the project a transit-oriented development. The project was expected to begin in late 2019 to early 2020.[39][40]\n\nSouth side of Main Street\n\nSince 2003, the city and state have been demolishing buildings on the south side of Main Street (Connecticut Route 34) in order to widen the roadway from two to four lanes divided by a median. Multiple development projects have been proposed, from high density mixed use to big-box retail plazas, but none have been successful. In 2019, the last four buildings on the south side of Main Street were demolished; following delays, the widening project had a tentative construction start date of early 2020. The Factory Street Square project is the most recent proposal. Rather than attempting to redevelop the entire 23-acre parcel, the proposal only encompasses five acres.[41][42]\n\nPershing Square Shopping Center\n\nIn 2014, Valley Bowl, a popular local bowling alley, was razed to erect a modern shopping plaza and realign an offset intersection. The realignment of the entrance was a joint venture between the Pershing Square developers and the developers of the adjacent property, Red Raider Plaza. Shortly after the completion of the plaza, it was purchased by Greenwich-based Urstadlt Biddle Properties Inc. for $9 million.[43][44][45]\n\nRed Raider Plaza\n\nIn 2011, Walgreen Company, a national retail pharmacy chain, purchased Red Raider Plaza for $7.15 million with plans to remodel one of the buildings and demolish the other to make room for a Walgreens Pharmacy. Following the announcement that Walgreens would acquire Rite Aid in 2015, Walgreens froze the construction of all new stores, including the Derby store. Walgreens maintains building ownership, and continued the redevelopment with some changes. The plaza received a significant renovation, parking lot improvements, and realignment of one of the entrances.[46][47][48]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nLocal\n\n[edit]\n\nCity government\n\nThe city government consists of a nine-member board of aldermen and alderwomen, board of education, board of finance, planning and zoning commission, and many other appointed boards and commissions. The current mayor is Joseph DiMartino (D), who has served since 2023.[49]\n\nThe board of aldermen and alderwomenfor the 2023-2025 Term is separated into three districts within the city and headed by Sarah Widomski, President of the Board.[50]\n\nList of aldermen and alderwomen 1st Ward 2nd Ward 3rd Ward Arthur Newberg (D) Jessica Barrios-Perez (D) David Chevarella (D) Amy Pettinichi (D) George F.

There is no fee for parking, and the park is open from sunrise to sunset.[78]\n\nPFC Frank P. Witek Memorial Park\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Frank P. Witek Memorial Park is a 144-acre park on the east side of the city dedicated to Medal of Honor recipient Frank P. Witek, who was born in Derby on December 10, 1921. The property, formerly a reservoir, dates back to 1859 when the burgeoning Borough of Birmingham (present-day Downtown Derby)[79] needed a stable water supply. The newly established Birmingham Water Company bought the area, which was mostly meadows and farmland, to create two reservoirs by damming area brooks. The land was purchased by the city in 1997 and dedicated on May 29, 1999. In addition to the two ponds (former reservoirs), there are hiking/walking trails and two soccer fields which the city built in 2006.[80]\n\nLandmarks and monuments\n\n[edit]\n\nNational Register of Historic Places\n\n[edit]\n\nBirmingham Green Historic District – A total of 10 buildings, three of which are churches, and four monuments encompass the district. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000 as a good example of privately organized 19th-century urban planning.\n\nJohn I. Howe House – Built in 1845, it was built for John Ireland Howe, pin manufacturing pioneer of the Howe Pin Company. In 1838, Howe moved his business from New York to Derby. The Howe House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.\n\nKraus Corset Factory – Historic corset manufacturer, now the Sterling Rowe Apartment House on the corner of Roosevelt Drive and Third Street.\n\nOsborne Homestead – Historic nineteenth-century farmhouse. Today, the state operates it as the Osborne Homestead Museum. The land surrounding it is Osbornedale State Park.\n\nSterling Opera House – Amelia Earhart, John L. Sullivan, Harry Houdini, George Burns, Lionel Barrymore, Ethel Barrymore, Red Skelton, and John Philip Sousa appeared on this stage. It was the first building in Connecticut to be added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1968.\n\nHarcourt Wood Memorial Library – Built in 1902 with Ansonia marble, the library was founded as a free reading room in 1868. The land was provided by the Sarah Riggs Humphreys Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, on the condition that the building would always have a room the chapter could use.\n\nLandmarks\n\n[edit]\n\nNational Humane Alliance fountain\n\nThe city has resurrected its National Humane Alliance fountain—a century-old granite structure with lion-head spigots—as part of a gateway entrance plaza at the Division Street entrance to the Derby Greenway. The fountain was given to the city in 1906 by the National Humane Alliance, and was erected at the intersection of Seymour and Atwater Avenues. The water was first turned on on June 1, 1906. Years later it was moved to Founders Commons when traffic patterns made its original location a problem. It fell into disrepair and was not used as a fountain while on Founders Commons. When the Derby Greenway was built, the fountain was moved to its new location on June 22, 2006, fully restored with new plumbing and new lions' heads, and was formally dedicated with the surrounding Derby Hall of Fame Plaza on September 1, 2007.[81] The fountain has three levels: the top level contains spigots in the shape of lion's heads for humans, below is a large circular bowl for horses, and at the base are smaller bowls for dogs and cats.\n\nCivil War Monument\n\nIn 1875, the Elisha S. Kellogg Post of the Grand Party of the Republic raised $1,475 to erect a statue to honor the soldiers of Derby and Huntington (now Shelton) who served in the Union forces. In 1878, an unknown person made a donation of $1,500 for the statue base, which made it possible to proceed with erecting the statue. The base was dedicated on July 4, 1877. Several years later, $3,200 was pledged for a remodel of the existing base and the addition of an upper base and a 7 ft bronze statue, bringing the total height of the monument to 21 ft 4in. The remodel and addition were constructed by Maurice J. Power of New York City; the sculptor of the bronze statue is unknown. The dedication of the remodel/addition was held on July 4, 1883, and was attended by approximately 8,000 people.[82] The monument was restored in 2018 at a cost of $75,000.[83]\n\nOld Derby Uptown Burial Ground (Colonial Cemetery)\n\nThe city was one of, if not the first in the country, to create a public burial ground not affiliated with a church. The first known burial is that of Reverend John Bowers, in 1687, the first minister of Derby. There is a period of 241 years between the first and last stones placed in the cemetery.[84][85] The cemetery is open to the public, and is located at the intersection of Derby Avenue and Academy Hill Road.\n\nNotable events\n\n[edit]\n\n2001 anthrax attacks\n\n[edit]\n\nOn November 16, 2001, 94 year-old Ottilie Lundgren of Oxford was brought to Griffin Hospital in Derby, experiencing difficulty breathing and cold-like symptoms. Based on her symptoms and rapidly deteriorating condition, doctors suspected and began testing for anthrax. A response was made to the hospital from the FBI, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Connecticut State Police, Connecticut State Health Department, and Derby Fire Department HAZ-MAT team. The test was confirmed and treatment began, but was unsuccessful, and Lundgren died on November 22, 2001, making her the fifth and final victim of the 2001 anthrax attacks.\n\nDerby and Griffin Hospital made worldwide news for days following the incident, and most major news outlets provided 24-hour news coverage for updates on Lundgren's condition. Investigators thought that the anthrax was delivered in a letter via the United States Postal Service to her home in Oxford, but no suspicious letters were found, and the exact route of exposure was never determined. Post offices in Seymour and Wallingford were investigated, as they were the only two post offices that sent mail to Lundgren's home; however, both facilities were determined to be clean. Lundgren's home in Oxford was quarantined and searched by the FBI and Connecticut State Police, but nothing was found that indicated how she had been exposed.[86][87][88]\n\nIn 2008, following a lengthy investigation that repeatedly came up empty, the FBI's primary suspect was Bruce Edwards Ivins, a microbiologist, vaccinologist, and senior biodefense researcher at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick, Maryland. However, Irvins took his own life shortly after the FBI named him as the primary suspect, and no formal charges or direct evidence has been found to substantiate these accusations. In 2010, the FBI closed the investigation into the attacks.[89]\n\nRiver Restaurant explosion\n\n[edit]\n\nOn December 6, 1985, at approximately 3:45pm EST, a three-story brick building, located at 268 Main Street in Derby, collapsed following a natural gas explosion, killing six people and injuring dozens. Natural gas had seeped into the sewer line following construction in the area. The River Restaurant located on the main level of the building had 18 customers and employees inside when the explosion occurred. Residents and businesses within a ten-block radius were evacuated as a precaution while firefighters worked to find those trapped in the debris. The Connecticut Fire Marshal's Office, Connecticut State Police, and National Transportation Safety Board investigated and found a crack in a four-inch cast iron pipe near the explosion site. Connecticut's \"Call Before You Dig\" program is a direct response to this incident.[90][91]\n\nCaroline Street fire\n\n[edit]\n\nOn August 12, 1991, at approximately 6:56pm EST, a fire broke out in the basement of a three-story, six-family home located at 269 Caroline Street. First arriving units found heavy fire in the nearly 100-year-old building along with reports of multiple trapped residents. The fire department rapidly struck a second and third alarm for additional resources from the surrounding area, including Ansonia, Shelton, Seymour, and Orange. In total, 18 people escaped or were rescued from the building, but a mother and her two children were killed in the fire. The Fire Marshal's Office investigated and determined the cause of the fire was accidental.[92][93]\n\nFlood of 1955\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 1955 Connecticut floods\n\nAugust 10–12, 1955 brought heavy rain to the east coast from Hurricane Connie, saturating the ground. A week later when Hurricane Diane passed through, the rain water had nowhere to go. As a result, the Housatonic and Naugatuck Rivers over flowed their banks and devastated the Housatonic and Naugatuck River Valley areas.[94] The crest of the Naugatuck River reached 25.70 ft above flood stage, the highest in recorded history, which it still maintains to this day.[95] Low-lying cities in the area, such as Derby, Shelton, Ansonia, Seymour, Beacon Falls, and Oxford all suffered impacts from the flood. In total, 87 people were killed and an estimated $200 million (1955) or $1.8 billion (2018) in damage was reported.\n\nInfrastructure\n\n[edit]\n\nGreen energy\n\n[edit]\n\nSolar power\n\nIn 2015, the city entered into an agreement with BQ Energy Inc. of Poughkeepsie, NY which allowed them to install nearly 3,000 solar panels on the city's former landfill, generating approximately 840 megawatts of power annually. The panels are used to offset the cost of powering municipal buildings and are expected to save the city 15–20 percent in energy costs over the next 20 years. The project was funded by United Illuminating through state bidding.[96][97]\n\nHydrogen fuel cell energy\n\nIn 2018, the cities of Derby and Hartford were selected to be the home to two new hydrogen fuel cell plants through a bid process with the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. Fuel Cell Energy Inc., of Danbury, was selected to construct and operate these fuel cells, totaling 22.2 megawatts of power. Once constructed, the Derby facility would generate 14.8 megawatts of power, and the Hartford facility will generate 7.4 megawatts. The Derby facility is being constructed on a vacant parcel of land along Roosevelt Drive (Route 34), and construction was expected to begin in the summer of 2019.[98][99]\n\nSinger Village zero energy sub-division\n\nThe Singer Estate was built in 1927 by relatives of Isaac Singer, of Singer sewing machines. Most of the original 200 acres of property was subdivided off into homes and businesses. As of 2011, when it was donated to the Valley Community Foundation, the estate was approximately six acres in size. That same year it was purchased by Brookside Development LLC., to be further subdivided into Connecticut's first zero-energy subdivision. The development group built seven homes on the remaining six acres, and the historic Singer mansion sits at the end of the newly constructed dead-end street. In 2016, the development was named the \"Best Green Energy Single Family Development\" and the \"Best Green Energy Efficient Home\" by the Home Builders and Remodelers Association of Connecticut.[100][101]\n\nUtilities\n\n[edit]\n\nElectric utilities are provided by the United Illuminating Company; gas service is provided by the Eversource Energy. Kinder Morgan Inc. operates the Tennessee Gas Pipeline that runs partly through the city. Municipal water is supplied by the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority; wastewater services are provided by the city through the Water Pollution Control Authority (WPCA).[102]\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nRail\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city has a Metro-North Railroad station called Derby–Shelton. The station is located at 1 Main Street and serves the residents of Derby and Shelton. Derby-Shelton is the last regular stop on the Waterbury Branch before it joins the Northeast Corridor. The station is 69.5 miles from Grand Central Terminal, with travel time being an average of one hour, 54 minutes, depending on transfer time at Bridgeport. Travel time to New Haven is an average of one hour, two minutes, depending on transfer time.[103]\n\nBus\n\n[edit]\n\nAll bus routes meet at the Derby–Shelton station. The Valley Transit facility is next to the train station on adjoining property.\n\nConnecticut Transit – Route F6\n\nGreater Bridgeport Transit Authority – Routes 15 & 23\n\nValley Transit – Regional public bus service by reservation only, serving the residents of Ansonia, Derby, Shelton, and Seymour[104]\n\nAirports\n\n[edit]\n\nLocal\n\nWaterbury–Oxford Airport (13 mi)\n\nSikorsky Memorial Airport (14 mi)\n\nRegional\n\nTweed New Haven Airport (15 mi)\n\nWestchester County Airport (41 mi)\n\nInternational\n\nBradley International Airport (58 mi)\n\nLaGuardia Airport (66 mi)\n\nJohn F.
