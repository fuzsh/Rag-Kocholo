        "text": "Hey,\n\nThis phrase \"In ardua virtus\" is apparently a family motto. Unfortunately when using the god awful computer translations I cant seem to find out what it actually means, or if this is even correct. (Was told by a now passed family member). As far as I know its something along the lines of virtue and something about difficulty, that's just from rough guesses about what I know of Latin.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks\n\nJack\n\n\"in ardua vitus\" is my family motto, its translation is \"virtue against difficulties\". it is above our family crest which hangs in our family church in oxford, also on my gate.\n\nits translation is \"virtue against difficulties\".\n\nTranslating virtus as virtue doesn't make for a very good translation.\n\nETA: My apologies, Pacis. I didn't see your post. Possibly you too would favour \"courage\" over \"virtue\".\n\nTranslating virtus as virtue doesn't make for a very good translation.\n\nWell, it depends, it can be an acceptable translation. But its meaning is indeed often broader than the English \"virtue\", though it can include it. It's a hard word to translate, actually, no exact English equivalent that I know of.\n\nETA: My apologies, Pacis. I didn't see your post. Possibly you too would favour \"courage\" over \"virtue\".\n\nI'm not too sure, but in this particular context (with \"difficulties\" being mentioned) I probably would. Though I feel \"courage\" is imperfect as well, which must be what prompted me to give both translation, as if to convey a mix of both..."
