        "text": "The White Peak Distillery is based in Ambergate, Derbyshire, 12 miles North of Derby city centre. It was founded by Max and Claire Vaughan in 2016, following a dream for years of producing a single malt whisky in Derbyshire, despite no previous experience in the drinks industry. The distillery is sited in a 24km stretch of the Derwent Valley that was awarded UNESCO World Heritage status in 2001, within the old Maintenance and Store Sheds of the Johnson & Nephew wire works that date back to 1876 and lasted for 120 years, which itself was rebuilt from a family owned iron forge from the early 1800s. The motto for the distillery is taken from that of the wire works – Virtus Patienta Veritus, the virtue of patience and truth.\n\nInitial releases from White Peak include a range of gins and a Cask Aged Rum, with their first Single Malt Whisky release initially scheduled for launch in November of 2021. However, supply issues with the distinctive bottle that pays homage to the wire and cable produced by the old factory meant the first release was delayed to February 2022.\n\nThe team employ a long fermentation and use two copper pot stills of 3,000 and 2,100 litres in volume. Water is sourced from the River Derwent immediately adjacent to the distillery, utilising some of the old pumping infrastructure for their condenser cooling system. English barley is used, and when I visited a couple of days before the launch of their First Release the team had begun a run of spirit that was using barley taken purely from Derbyshire.\n\nNamed atfer a global cable brand that was produced at the old J&N factory, Caduro is a new release for 2023 that is the first to be considered an ongoing 'core' bottling. While we may see some evolution over time as stock ages, Caduro will represent the house style of Wire Works with other limited edition releases taking it in various directions.\n\nThe batch is a marriage of French and American oak casks that were either first-fill ex-Bourbon or STR - the increased use of French oak and a larger proportion of STR introduces a more fruity style against the already classic lightly peated character. There's higher notes of green apple and soft spices alongside deeper red berry and gentle bonfire smoke, creating an approachable complexity with an almost juicy finish.\n\nDELIVERY CHARGES:\n\nShipping rates are based on WEIGHT of goods - the total weight of your order will determine the cost of the shipping charge due to price banding imposed by Royal Mail.
