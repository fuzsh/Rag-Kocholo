        "text": "In honor of Rosalind Waters\n\nMrs. Waters was my art teacher in pre-K/kindergarten/connecting class and in 7th-9th grades. I'll always remember her drawing and sculpting classes. She also supervised the design and painting of the sets for our Upper School musical, The Wiz, and guided the 9th grade through the process of designing the yearbook.\n\nIn honor of Ivy Butterworth\n\nIvy Butterworth was the most influential teacher I ever had (and this includes graduate school!). She made history interesting and fun and that's something that has stuck with me throughout my life.\n\nWe are so proud to be part of the Derby Community. Thank you to the faculty and administration for making this a special place for our kids!\n\nIn honor of Jane, Wendy, Sally, Andrea and Gordon Carr\n\nThe First Family of Derby !!! Thank you Family Carr for all you do and have done (known and unknown) to support the Derby Community these last many decades !!\n\nIn memory of Alan G. Carr - Trustee\n\nMr Carr was an amazing force for GOOD at Derby for so many years ! He was incredibly generous with his time & treasure ! He inspired so many others to participate in \"whatever it was\" that excited them ! He must be so proud of Jane and their kids as he watches from above the full and happy lives they are living and their contributions to society. And he so enjoyed a wonderful sail out of his beloved Hingham Harbor. Fair winds and following seas !"
