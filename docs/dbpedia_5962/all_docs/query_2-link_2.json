        "text": "On April 6, 1791, The Derby School opened its doors in Hingham Massachusetts, founded by Sarah Langley Hersey Derby on many of the same guiding principles that Derby values today: the idea of providing education through partnerships (first with the town leaders, and gradually with its parent community, alumni and faculty), the goal of being an inclusive community committed to providing the means for financial assistance, and the vision of providing the most up-to-date education available to meet the needs of the day.\n\nSarah Langley was born in 1714, the daughter of a Hingham innkeeper. With her first marriage to Dr. Ezekiel Hersey, Sarah Langley Hersey rose to a position of prominence. She ran the family farm while her husband attended to his medical practice. Although she had no formal education, Sarah took particular interest in the educational systems of her times. She engaged in frequent discussions with community leaders about the inadequacies of schooling, particularly for girls, and the general lack of an arts education. After Dr. Hersey’s early death, Sarah met another accomplished man from Salem, Massachusetts, an active, prosperous seaport of the day. Sarah married Captain Richard Derby and continued her position of importance.\n\nIn 1772, twice widowed and childless at the age of 58, Sarah Derby worked with the leading men of Hingham to address her educational concerns and deeded a parcel of land on the Main Street of Hingham for the location of a coeducational school. Six years later, in 1784, this partnership, by Act 0032, set forth the rules for the Trustees for the Derby School in order to assure the desired oversight of the school. Ten leading male citizens of the day were selected to sit on the first board."
