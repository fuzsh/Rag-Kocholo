Not living ones but the dead. When I was researching other stuﬀ, they’d wander into the texts I was reading, true to the troublemakers they were when they were alive a millennium and a half ago. Eventually they got me here, to this book, which is about the ecologies of the early medieval West and what they meant to the people who were part of them. Pigs are at its center because they were critical members of those ecologies and also because they deeply aﬀected the ways that humans experienced and thought about the physical world. Even today we are living with some of the legacies of those human-pig relationships. It’s not just me. Pigs are fascinating subjects, and they, like humans, have histories. But they can also help us make up a deﬁcit in the way we’ve thought about the human past. We don’t often ask what the early Middle Ages had to say about nature (let alone about pigs). Maybe that’s because we think we know the answer—that humans in these centuries, especially Christians, saw themselves as superior to everything else that God had created; that they were incurious about the world; that in the wake of the Roman Empire their only concern was survival. But in this book I suggest a diﬀerent situation. Early medieval communities were thinking seriously about their environments. They saw themselves as part of a complex and dynamic universe that was propelled by interconnected organisms and forces. In that system, even the smallest creatures or events could have far-reaching consequences. The big picture was tied to hyperlocal circumstances. The people who lived in the early medieval West—in what is now northwest Africa and Europe—brought these perspectives to bear on their farming, policy making, and philosophizing. And pigs were both a means and a\n\nix\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb ix\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\nx\n\np r e face\n\nmotivation for doing this. They were a ﬂexible species that could handle a diversity of ecologies. They illustrated the beneﬁts of being adaptable. But they were also a constant reminder that humans had to adapt to their animals and landscapes: total control or assimilation was unthinkable. In this book I track the interlocking relationships between pigs and humans and the ecologies that interwove them by drawing on texts and images, bioarchaeology, settlement archaeology, and mammal biology. I wrote it with diﬀerent groups of readers in mind: historians of the early Middle Ages, obviously, but also scholars and general readers who are interested in animals, agriculture, environmental history, religion, and the history of science. These might be separate categories of thinking today, but they were intuitively linked in the early Middle Ages. And I have tried to make these centuries accessible to readers who do not have a background in early medieval history. As I worked on this project, my book was parasitic on three people especially: Chris Shannon, because we talk about trees a lot, and because we tried to be good to two raucous monk parrots as long as they lived. Henry Cowles, because he’s the best writing and reading partner a person could have. Bill Jordan, because he made the medieval history of rural Europe something to love. I am grateful to Umberto Albarella, Kim Bowes, Pam Crabtree, Caroline Goodson, and Jean-Hervé Yvinec, as well as to the many other archaeologists whose work and images appear here. Helmut Reimitz and Marios Costambeys were always happy to talk pig. Jean Thomson Black “got” this book right away and has been a truly invested editor. Susan Laity edited this manuscript masterfully. Lindsay Holman of the Ancient World Mapping Center made the maps. Many friends and colleagues passed along references and tips over the past decade, but I’d like to single out Brent Shaw for his enthusiasm. I’m also grateful to audiences at the University of Georgia, Princeton University, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Northern Illinois University, the University of Liverpool, New York University, Yale University, the University of Michigan, and the medievalist group at the Institute for Advanced Study (especially Cecily Hillsdale, who read more of this book than she had to, and Adam Izdebski, who shared research in advance of its publication). And Leah Wolfe, butcher at the Meat Hook, in Brooklyn, showed me how a pig’s meat and bones ﬁt together. I want to thank that pig, too, even though she is dead.

About the trouble a certain pig caused, or the smart thing it did, or the personality it had, or the weird stuﬀ it ate, or the large litter it reared, or the delicious meat it eventually became. But this book does not start with anything like that. This is partly because the stories that people must have told each other about their pigs in the early Middle Ages, let alone the everyday shoptalk about them, were hardly ever written down. It is also because pigs were a sort of anti-synecdoche when it came to the way people thought about the world. No single pig could stand for the whole. Instead, pigs called attention to the particularity of things. Every pig was diﬀerent, every farm and landscape and community through which pigs moved was diﬀerent, and what pigs often forced humans to see was that a world in ﬂux required ﬂexibility rather than formulas. The rhetoric of ecology is very unlike the rhetoric of the archetype and the anecdote. The details make all the diﬀerence. In the early Middle Ages, thinking big meant thinking small. Take the city of Meninx. It lay on the southern coast of the island of Jerba, which itself sat about 2.5 miles (4 km) oﬀ the coast of mainland Tunisia. There were not many pigs in Meninx. Their bones amount to about 5.5 percent of all the animal remains found in a sixth-century sample there, and this ﬁgure is similar to what we ﬁnd in cities that more properly belonged to the pre-desert and desert of Libya, such as the Roman city of Leptis Magna and the Garamantian city of Garama (today Jarma), the capital of Fazzān. But pig statistics aside, there was no place quite like Meninx. Trade from both the Mediterranean and the Sahara converged there, and its prosperity made it one of the standout towns of late antique North Africa. The heartbeat of its economy was the production of purple dye and cloth, which relied on mollusks of the genus 1\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 1\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\n2\n\nin t roduc t ion\n\nMurex. If visitors had somehow overlooked the huge industrial zones dedicated to murex processing that ringed the city with their dunes of discarded shells, they would probably still have gotten the idea from the purple and red limestone that adorned the public spaces at the urban core: a wink to its leading export. The dye industry was knitted together with the ﬁshing industry for obvious reasons, and also with salt production (because murex had to be macerated with salt for three days) and sheep husbandry, because the salt ﬂats along the island’s coasts became grasslands for grazing in the rainy season, and because sheep provided wool for what would eventually become purple fabric. Not surprisingly, sheep outnumbered pigs in Meninx.1 What do the pigs of this panorama tell us? Only that the panorama is incomplete, not simply because other communities raised proportionally more pigs than Meninx did, but also because the environmental and economic matrices of other settlements—even the ones nearby, even the ones with comparable pig populations—would have been qualitatively diﬀerent. A snapshot like Meninx is precious because it is irreducible, a case that does not quite encapsulate. There can be exemplarity here, but it is not all-encompassing. Speciﬁc pigs and places are not stand-ins for the whole of the early Middle Ages. Instead, they move us from one scale to another, from the pigs that fed a murex workshop to the salt ﬂats of Jerba to the Gulf of Gabès to the cross-imperial trading networks running from Sicily to the Saharan wadis of Fazzān. They are our guides to an extensive ecological gearwork. And that is how they struck their caretakers in the early Middle Ages. So let’s start small, even though it might seem that the subject of premodern pigs is a very small matter. Technically, this is true: in early medieval legalese, pigs fell into the category of “minor” or “lesser” livestock. If a person was giving away a piece of land, the animals usually went with it, and they were mentioned in passing, in the appurtenance clauses of the contracts that recorded the transaction. Individual species, let alone individual animals, were not often singled out in these documents. Instead animals usually appear in aggregate, ﬂocked together, as “beasts of burden and livestock of both sexes, great and small.”2 Beneath this sort of legal boilerplate, which purported to describe a property in full, was a teeming world of animal life that humans thought about deeply, much more deeply than even their charters made of skin would suggest. And although pigs counted as lesser livestock—which put them in the company of goats, sheep, chickens, and geese, and set them against larger and pricier animals such as oxen, bulls, cows, horses, and donkeys—they occupied an outsized presence in the lives and minds of early medieval communities.\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 2\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\nin t roduc t ion\n\n3\n\nPigs had carved out some of that space for themselves, but their inﬂuence also resonated because the littlest things mattered in Christian theology at this time. All creation was part of the divine jigsaw that God encouraged humans to piece together intellectually for the beneﬁt of their own spiritual growth. This was one of the reasons people paid attention to their animals: they had implications for the cosmic order. Augustine of Hippo had insisted in the early ﬁfth century that just because something was inferior to something else did not mean that it was worthless or even replaceable. To think diﬀerently would be akin to saying that because sight surpasses hearing, there should be four eyes and no ears for every human body. One of the special things about the universe was that good things were not equivalent. The presence of diﬀerently good things, the fact that the cosmos was so varied, meant that there were more kinds of good in total. If good things were truly equal and substitutable, the world—and, by extension, human understanding—would be impossibly narrowed.3 Pigs (sometimes “good,” sometimes not) were small in one sense and large in many others; they were a species that challenges our sense of scale. This book is about the relationship between humans and pigs in agrarian life in the early medieval West, but it is also about the practices and ideas that humans developed about their lived environments as a result of their interactions with these animals. The idea that emerged most conspicuously was an “ecological” ethic that restructured policies from local to imperial levels. Centuries before the rise of environmentalism, animal-rights activism, and local-farm advocacy, early medieval societies were embracing their own distinctive interest in anchoring human perspectives to things that were smaller and greater than them. This is not to say that the “ecological ethic” of the early Middle Ages resembles modern Western ideas of environmental protectionism or animal rights. It doesn’t. But the early medieval consideration of humans’ position in the world was informed by how other beings worked.4 Even in a culture in which humans alone were said to be created in the image of God, ethics was fundamentally a form of ecological thinking. The things that humans paid attention to, evaluated, and worried about were supposed to reckon with the whole connective tissue of creation, and pigs are both a general and a particular case for understanding this. General, because pigs give us one of many possible opportunities for understanding the ways early medieval societies approached their lived environments. Particular, because they made a unique impression on early medieval culture. After all, humans are not the only species to have histories. Other animals can also develop new forms of knowledge, new habits, and new patterns of\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 3\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\n4\n\nin t roduc t ion\n\nsociability which make their lives diﬀerent from the lives of their ancestors. In a suburb of Seattle, for example, more than thirty Brewer’s blackbirds show up at a local Costco just before it opens, waiting along with human customers to enter the store, where they can pick up crumbs oﬀ the ﬂoor of the café or simply get out of the rain! They know the store’s hours and have ﬁgured out how to exploit it. John Marzluﬀ, the urban ecologist who observed them, sees this case as one of countless changes that resilient avian species are making all the time in response to the shifting environments they share with humans. Across the Paciﬁc, a community of Octopus tetricus has settled oﬀ the east coast of Australia, ﬁfty feet down, in a place that researchers call Octopolis. Although octopuses are typically solitary animals, this “village” coalesced around the remains of what probably used to be a boat, and now it is buried in scallop shells that the octopuses have discarded after eating their soft insides. Through a mix of improvisation and learning—and probably also a biological disposition to communication that researchers had overlooked until recently—the residents of Octopolis have ﬁgured out how to live in a group.5 The pigs that lived and died one thousand to ﬁfteen hundred years ago are even more elusive than a community of octopuses in the deep, but it is possible to track elements of their histories, too. Pigs were found nearly everywhere in the early medieval West. They were the only livestock that did not produce “secondary” products in addition to meat, but they were highly adaptive to diﬀerent circumstances, willing to eat almost anything, and fertile, all of which made them inexpensive to raise. In that sense they were ideal commodities. But they were also smart and delinquent animals that scrambled the plans humans set for them. They escaped from their pens and herders, destroyed crops, raided stores of food, injured people, and deﬁled corpses. And yet, despite their costs, most people were still willing to keep pigs, and they made continuous adjustments to accommodate them. Medieval communities’ interactions with their animals also inspired new ways of managing the economies and cultures of the farm, forest, city, and court. The history of pigs in this period is also a history of the counterintuitive connections that developed between the micro-universes of pig husbandry and early medieval institutions and ideas on a wider scale. The period I focus on used to be called the “Dark Ages” or the age of the “barbarian” kingdoms. But the early medieval West is a classic case of mistaken identity. The fracturing of the western Roman Empire did not leave an impoverished and simple society in its wake. Instead, what scholars of the\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 4\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\nin t roduc t ion\n\n5\n\nearly Middle Ages have found, from North Africa to the British Isles, are thousands of communities that developed ways of working and living that were speciﬁc to their local environments. Both the politics and the ecologies of this period were fragmented—though not entirely detached from one another— and the humans who moved within them were experimental, inventive, and more sensitive to the scales of the possible.6 So this history begins with the ﬁssure of the Roman West in the course of the ﬁfth century, and it ends around the year 1000. My focus is on the communities and small kingdoms that succeeded the empire in Europe and North Africa (the Maghreb), with comparative attention to adjacent areas the Roman emperors never controlled, including the Libyan Sahara, Europe east of the Rhine, Ireland, and Scandinavia. This half-millennium saw the survival of the eastern wing of the Roman Empire, which today we call Byzantium. It saw the ﬂourishing of rabbinic culture and the compilation of the Babylonian Talmud at the western edge of Sasanian Persia. It saw the birth and maturation of Islam. It saw the creation of punctuation, the invention of musical notation, and the codiﬁcation of Roman law. In these centuries, the conquests of the Arab, Syrian, and Berber armies produced a caliphate stretching from Transoxania at the edge of the Eurasian steppe to the Iberian Atlantic in the west. At the same time, hundreds of monasteries were founded where no monasteries had existed before. The inhabitants of Britain began to speak Old English, and Latin slowly evolved into the proto-Romance languages. Trading networks began cropping up in the North Sea and Baltic, and through them Scandinavian entrepreneurs got wind of wealth farther south: they raided and sometimes settled in western Europe, set up settlements and trading depots in eastern Europe and Rus’, and colonized Iceland and Greenland. They even ventured out to North America. Paris ﬁrst became a capital in the sixth century. Baghdad was built from nothing in the eighth, and Cairo was created in the tenth. These were the centuries of the golden basilicas of Ravenna, the magniﬁcent mosques at Damascus and Córdoba, the Lindisfarne Gospels, the Shahnameh, and the translations and commentaries of Greek philosophy into Syriac and Arabic. They were the prime years and the ﬁnal years for the kingdoms of the Ostrogoths, the Sueves, the Burgundians, the Sasanians, the Visigoths, the Merovingians, the Lombards, the Saxons, the Avars, the Carolingians, Essex, Kent, Sussex, East Anglia, Mercia, Northumbria, Wessex, the Ottonians, the Umayyads, and (by some measures) the ‘Abbāsids—to give only a very partial list.7 But this book is not a political history in the traditional sense. Instead I offer a diﬀerent kind of narrative about inﬂuence that works from the ground\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 5\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\n6\n\nin t roduc t ion\n\nup. Across the early medieval West, pig husbandry thrived in a wide range of environmental and social conditions. And the core argument of the book is that pigs’ great ﬂexibility and intelligence, and medieval communities’ engagement with those capabilities, resulted in new approaches to environments, economies, and culture that can be fairly characterized as ecological. Farmers, consumers, policy makers, and philosophers noticed that they were part of a world whose countless biotic inhabitants, inorganic features, and human institutions were ﬂuctuating and interdependent. And what pigs in particular taught humans was that it was worth accommodating this multivariable, dynamic system—to try to be as versatile as pigs were in order to thrive. So although the pig may seem marginal or even cartoonish to us today, it was a signiﬁcant player in the early Middle Ages, and the working relationships between humans and pigs came to shape not only patterns of farming and eating but also regional economies, legal culture, ﬁscal policies, identities, and philosophies of the cosmos. The term ecology entered the English language in the last quarter of the nineteenth century as a loanword from German, and German biologists and advocates of science for the general public had coined and popularized it only a short while previously, starting in the middle of the nineteenth century. As the historian of science Lynn Nyhart has shown, ﬁn-de-siècle Germans looked to the biological society (which they called a Gesellschaft) as a remedy for the social one (also a Gesellschaft). They ﬁgured that acting with an ecological sensibility would counteract the ruptures that industrialization had created within human communities. They insisted that human society was supposed to be true to its own nature by acknowledging its embeddedness in the world and by working “to interact successfully with both its physical environment and the other organisms around it.”8 So on one hand, the concept of ecology is speciﬁc to a particular historical context, and it postdates the early Middle Ages by eight hundred–plus years. But on the other, it is not totally alien to early medieval sensibilities. Most basically, an ecology is a system of constant energy transfer, of contingent and changing relationships between diﬀerent organisms and between organisms and nonliving things, and this sort of dynamic was certainly characteristic of rural and urban communities in the early Middle Ages. Human communities were embedded in environments that created opportunities and constraints on their lives and their work. And the exploitation of certain resources—say, the choice to fell oaks for fuel and timber, or to harvest murex for its color— had consequences for other entities and organisms. Just as signiﬁcant, early\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 6\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\nin t roduc t ion\n\n7\n\nmedieval farmers and lawmakers knew this. They approached their lived environments as overlapping and interrelated systems. They developed practices and policies to accommodate regional variations, ﬂuctuations in resources, and multifocal interests. They were not simply involved in shifts in scale. They were also thinking about scale and why it mattered. In other words, when we think ecologically it becomes easier to notice that communities in the early medieval West were also thinking ecologically, even though they would not have used this term and even though their views were not identical to ours. As an analytic, ecology helps make sense of a world that was both variable and contingent, and it helps make sense of societies that saw themselves as variable and contingent. So although the ﬁeld of ecocriticism— the study of critical perspectives toward nature and culture—is fairly new, the ideas ecocritics examine are not. Ancient and medieval thinkers were fascinated by the interdependency of physical and cosmic systems, and sometimes their sense of humanity itself became more porous as they thought about the nature of nature.9 Such a view was even characteristic of the intellectual circles of the early Middle Ages that were deeply committed to Christianity. And yet the early Middle Ages is often skipped over in more sweeping intellectual histories, environmental histories, and histories of science.10 That neglect has a lot to do with the fact that early medieval writers were not interested in writing what modern writers consider science and philosophy. Instead they enthusiastically produced biblical commentaries, histories, hagiographies, liturgical poetry, monastic Rules, sermons, and curated anthologies of older works. Modern readers have mostly neglected those materials on the mistaken assumption that they would not contain much worth reading, because (so the supposition goes) Christianity automatically instilled in its believers a sense of contempt for nature—or at least made them uninterested in it. But early medieval Christians would have been shocked to hear this. They saw the study of nature as something that enriched their faith. And because they were attentive to the complexity of the universe, the Christian ethics they formulated (about their sense of cosmic hierarchies, or about the soul’s salvation) were deeply relational. They took for granted that humans were part of an interactive universe of endlessly divergent perspectives. Curiosity and constant reference to other points of view were essential. To unearth this history, then, some of the richest sources include exegeses of the creation stories in Genesis and other texts that were invested in natural history and philosophy; early medieval legal and administrative documents\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 7\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\n8\n\nin t roduc t ion\n\n(law codes, decrees, charters, and property inventories); and bioarchaeology— in particular the analysis of bones, pollen, seeds, and charcoal. Because paleobotany and osteoarchaeology have made tremendous advances in recent decades, this book could not have been written twenty years ago. Now large-scale ﬁeld surveys and rescue archaeology are giving us glimpses of the plant and animal life on early medieval sites, and they are illuminating the early medieval landscape. They also make clear that it was not a world of interchangeable farms and farmers, and that the concept of the “average person” of the early Middle Ages (which one ﬁnds in many academic and popular histories) does not actually make much sense. Not only are early medieval farmers mistakenly presumed to have led miserable lives, they are also treated as a uniform bloc. But the diﬀerent opportunities and challenges that early medieval communities faced, and the ways they responded to them, suggest that rural communities were diverse, adaptive, and thoughtful. Pigs are not the only possible entry point into these agrarian cultures, but they are an especially good focal point for investigating how early medieval communities thought about their lived environments. There are several reasons for this. First, pigs loomed disproportionately large in ancient and medieval imaginations. People wrote and presumably talked about them more than other livestock and even more than most other animals, although they were rarely the commonest on a farm. In addition, pigs routinely forced humans to appreciate that they were dealing with interlocking, ﬂuctuating, and variable resources that required a correspondingly ﬂexible approach to handling them. And they were adaptive, most noticeably in their diet but also in their behaviors, which enabled their owners to take advantage of diﬀerent ecologies. Finally, unlike other livestock, pigs were consistently diﬃcult to manage, so their caretakers could not help but notice that domestication did not fully transform animals into commodities. Humans made tradeoﬀs and sacriﬁces in order to keep raising and eating pigs, and that, more than any other animal-human relationship in this period, attests to a long-term process of coevolution. The main pig “breed” in the early Middle Ages was a long-legged, hairy animal whose back usually rose to about 30 inches (or about mid-thigh on a 5′6″ human). Because pigs were partly free-ranging animals, they sometimes interbred with wild boars, which in this period still roamed the woodlands of North Africa and Europe. They favored acorns, beech mast, grubs, worms, and summer-autumn crops like legumes and grains, but (like pigs now) they would eat nearly anything else besides. Their diets were not the only adaptable thing\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 8\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\nin t roduc t ion\n\n9\n\nabout them. As modern biobehavioral research on industrial, free-range, and wild pig populations attests, pigs are social and responsive animals. They have good memories, can learn quickly, and practice what could fairly be called analytical decision making: they make eﬀective choices by selectively applying what they have learned about past situations to new scenarios. These qualities mean that not only single pigs but whole herds of pigs can have individual characteristics and abilities, can learn new things, and can change. The inhabitants of the early medieval West had their own insights about pigs’ abilities. They knew that a simple designation like species did not do justice to the range of abilities that animals of the same kind could exhibit depending on their individual aptitudes and circumstances. And they were acutely aware that pigs were ingenious escape artists and food ﬁnders, so much so that early medieval societies developed extensive legislation to manage the damage pigs caused in the course of escaping from their pens, uprooting neighbors’ crops, and attacking human beings. There is no better sign of how greatly communities valued their pigs than the enormous eﬀort that they put into accommodating these tricky animals, rather than ditch pig husbandry entirely. Early medieval kingdoms throughout the West developed new protocols of legal behavior on the logic that, because pigs would inevitably get loose and do damage, the best thing for humans to do would be to take more responsibility in the aftermath. They issued laws about the measures farmers should take when they found animals in their ﬁelds, how to deal eﬃciently with the animals and their owner in order to reach a nonviolent solution, and how to handle the situation if it happened a second or third time. There were times when both pigs and humans misbehaved, and these incidents sometimes show up in court records. But whether or not laws were broken, pigs were clearly shaping human institutions, even though they were ostensibly the ones under domestication. Farmers and lawmakers were not the only people paying attention to the grit of rural life. Natural philosophers and theologians were interested in the details, too, but for diﬀerent reasons. The book of Genesis narrated the origin of the universe as a six-day event in which God created everything out of shapelessness and darkness. This account fascinated and perplexed the people who read it in Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages. It had the effect of infusing the physical world with divine signiﬁcance, but it also raised countless questions that intellectuals energetically tried to answer. What did it mean that birds were created from water, for instance? When were the grubs that fed on corpses brought into being? Were the stars hot or cold?\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 9\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\n10\n\nin t roduc t ion\n\nTo investigate questions like these, Christian naturalists looked beyond the Bible. They consulted scientiﬁc, poetic, and philosophical sources. They made their own observations and studies of physical phenomena. And they spoke to specialized experts, not only elites such as physicians but also farmers, ﬁshermen, arborists, distillers, ditchdiggers, and even old men who could remember when their environments looked a little bit diﬀerent. One of their main conclusions was that the world was a highly complex system of interrelated but constantly changing parts. This meant that although certain features of the universe seemed cyclical—the seasonal winds, the celestial orbits, the growth of plants in the spring—it also contained enormous geographical diversity, and the state of any particular organism, geomorphic feature, or atmospheric phenomenon would change over time because it was connected to so many other forces. This ecological perspective also led its analysts to conclude that although humans were near the top of the hierarchy of creation, any given perspective or conclusion they formed about the world was inescapably partial. Even animals saw the world in diﬀerent ways, and thinking about what their views might be could help humans piece together a more comprehensive picture of the cosmos and in the process get another step closer to the divine power that had created it. So although we might assume that pigs matter only to agrarian history, early medieval philosophers would have set us straight: they were one of many keys to a complex and spiritually charged universe. It is not so hard to see why intellectuals in this period emphasized the intricacy of the physical world. The landscapes they lived in were a kaleidoscope of micro-ecologies, settlement types, and farming systems. Rural life was strikingly diverse. Some contrasts are obvious to us today. The vibrant oasis villages of the Libyan desert that cultivated dates and traﬃcked in Saharan gold and Mediterranean glass were a far cry from the settlements in Greenland that depended almost entirely on walrus hunting. But even within a single region—such as the plains and coasts of Apulia or the massif of central Spain—forms of life were so variable that it is neither helpful nor interesting to generalize about them. Communities also adopted forms of resource management that treated their ecologies systemically. Generically speaking, this was an age of agropastoralism: early medieval settlements mixed the cultivation of grains and other plants with animal husbandry, foraging, and hunting. They also worked with pottery, metals, textiles, and glass. But each farm or village calibrated\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 10\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\nin t roduc t ion\n\n11\n\nits forms of farming and craftworking to its surroundings. Whereas Meninx took advantage of its coasts and salt ﬂats to pasture sheep in order to complement its economy of purple dye, the Libyan city of Leptis Magna was catching barbary sheep, gazelles, and Saharan striped polecats, and a royal ringfort in Ireland was taking advantage of the plovers, water rails, corncrakes, herons, snipes, ducks, and geese that frequented the nearby Boyne River.11 Pigs were part of nearly all of those micro-ecologies because they were versatile animals. But pig husbandry can tell modern researchers more than the ways communities ﬁt a particular commodity into larger systems of survival. The work that humans did with pigs also transformed their sense of the ecologies they inhabited. Pigs helped settlements in a wide swathe of ecological niches “salvage” their environments, to borrow a term from the anthropologist Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing.12 They enabled humans to proﬁt from resources they did not produce (acorns, grubs, ﬁsh bones . . . the list is nearly endless), while also teaching them that these resources depended on far-reaching ecological forces. Some early medieval communities, in particular the ones that relied heavily on acorn-rich woodlands, developed economic strategies and ﬁscal policies that took these ecologies into consideration. Even in the upper echelons of early medieval society, kings and their advisers were trying to orient themselves to local perspectives, and the pig was one of their guides. Thinking about geographies and economies oﬀers a large-scale view of how important pigs were in the early medieval West, but on a more local level, humans’ interactions with pigs also transformed their personal lives and even their identities. Anthropologists and biologists now describe domestication and evolution as multi-vectored processes. Humans may bring about changes in other animals, but in the course of things they are transformed as well. We can also see this happening on a conceptual level, not just a physical one. Humans’ perceptions of the world and their ideas about themselves were in part shaped by their engagement with animals. Swineherds are especially conspicuous for the partnerships they formed with pigs. Most of the people who herded pigs professionally in the early Middle Ages were unfree or enslaved workers. They were responsible for supervising the animals, especially in the interest of preventing escapees from damaging crops. But they also needed to manage pigs’ breeding cycles, become intimately familiar with open-ﬁeld and woodland topography, herd animals that were not easy to herd, and even perform basic veterinary care. As a result, like the animals they cared for, swineherds acquired a kind of double status.\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 11\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\n12\n\nin t roduc t ion\n\nThey were low ranking by virtue of their legal status and by association with a dirty profession, but they were treated with respect in recognition of their skilled approach to work that was notoriously diﬃcult. Soldiers and states also became intertwined with pigs. In Late Antiquity, Roman soldiers had tended to eat more pork than local inhabitants wherever they were stationed, and the government even incorporated pigs into its tax system. Along with grain and wine, pigs were paid to the city of Rome and to military camps at the empire’s borders. When the western half of the empire began to fracture in the ﬁfth century, the role of pigs changed in tandem with politics. Most striking, one of the earliest law codes issued in the post-imperial West, the Lex Salica, which was issued in what is now northeast France, made pigs into a manifesto for its vision of a post-imperial kingdom. Its authors opened the code with an elaborate set of terms about pig theft, not so much to make clear that these acts were illegal—everyone would have already known that—but more to suggest that even pigs had consequences for the public order. Another group of people who participated in mutual interactions with pigs were a looser category of pork eaters. A majority of people in the early medieval West ate at least a little pork, with the exception of Jews, Muslims, and Greenlanders. But a few groups focused on pork as a key part of their identity: landed elites above all, and to a lesser extent all Christians. Pigs were a transformative force even in the form of food. Pork was not an inactive substance as medieval eaters saw it. Meat was capable of interacting with live bodies in ways that inﬂuenced and changed them. Taste was the only sensory process that dissolved the boundary between subject and object. It was an intermixing of living and posthumous organisms, and in late antique and early medieval epistemologies, the things people tasted and digested also acted upon them. Because Jews and Muslims do not eat pork, it might seem as if the pig has always been a touchstone for the diﬀerences between the monotheistic religions. But historically, in Late Antiquity and for most of the early Middle Ages, this was not the case. Rabbinic commentators saw the pig as a distinctly Roman animal, and even into the early Middle Ages, when the western empire had faded, the Romanness of the pig was its prevailing cultural identity. It was probably ﬁrst in the Visigothic kingdom of Iberia that the idea was ﬂoated that pigs were essential to Christian identity. Not all Christians ate pork, and not all pork-eating Christians thought that eating pork was necessary for being a Christian, but there were debates about the relationship all the same. (This is even more striking because Iberians were eating signiﬁcantly\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 12\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\nin t roduc t ion\n\n13\n\nless pork than people in any other part of western Christendom.) But generally speaking, Christians in the early medieval West were more likely to be arguing with each other about the risks or reasons for eating pork and other meats than thinking about pigs as a measure of diﬀerence between Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. Closer to the turn of the millennium, Christians increasingly used the metaphor of meat to think about a range of complicated and sometimes contradictory issues, and because pork was seen as the quintessential meat, pigs became entangled in Christian culture through this imagery. One way of thinking about meat was to see it as a deadly distraction. Flesh, carnis, evoked carnality: meat stood for a world of physical weakness and decay in contrast to the eternal life of the soul. But meat could also help Christians think about the dizzying notion of sacriﬁce. Meditating about more familiar forms of energy transfer, like slaughtering and eating pigs, was a way to appreciate how Jesus had sacriﬁced himself and in the process saved humankind. And by way of the analogies of meat and slaughter to salvation, Christians thought more about how animal bodies, especially pigs’ bodies, constituted a kind of sacriﬁce for humanity, too. In Christian theology, pigs were helping people transfer between spatial and temporal scales once again, from single acts of eating to a vision of paradise and eternity. The paradox of meat as simultaneously salviﬁc and deﬁcient swung into vicious forms of anti-Semitism in the late Middle Ages and early modern period. At the same time pigs became Christianized, they also became Judaized. They came to represent the Christian caricature of Judaism as a literal reading of scripture, in contrast to Christianity’s spiritual understanding of its true messages. But if pigs came to be seen as analogous to Jews, they were also viewed as representatives and conduits of the very ﬂesh that made Christian salvation possible. In the process, the species became central to the ways that monotheists identiﬁed themselves against one another, though this understanding came to the fore only in the eleventh or twelfth century. But the mixed and intense meanings of pigs in Christian culture that emerged after the year 1000 or so were rooted in the early medieval world’s long-standing knowledge of the animals’ complexity and versatility and ability to recast speciﬁc environments into something new. In short, pigs enrich our sense of early medieval human history because they are historical subjects themselves. It might seem strange to suggest such a thing: pigs have been tagged to certain symbols for such a long stretch of time that they seem timeless. Even their ancient persona still makes an\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 13\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\n14\n\nin t roduc t ion\n\nimmediate, rough sense to us: in three of the four Gospels, a demon that Jesus exorcized was driven straight into a herd of pigs, and the story would seem stranger today if those pigs had been horses, say, or bees or peacocks.13 But there was another side to these animals. In the early Middle Ages they were seen as more than ciphers for greed and contamination. Before Jesus drove out that demon, he asked it who it was. “My name is Legion, for we are many”: the pigs might as well have said the same thing. The herds and hordes of pigs that actually existed, and the communities they possessed, were many. And their stories were never exactly the same.\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 14\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\n1 • A Singular and Plural Beast\n\n“Three deaths are better than life,” an Old Irish riddle runs: “the death of a salmon, the death of a fat pig, the death of a robber.”1 Of these three deaths, the fat pigs fell the most frequently: across the early medieval West, they were ubiquitous. Pigs were the consummate meat of the early Middle Ages. Horses and oxen have pulling power, cows and goats and sheep make milk and manure (and skin for parchment and packaging), sheep grow wool, and poultry lay eggs.2 But domesticated pigs were only destined to be butchered. It took them less than two years to reach their maximum weight, so eﬃcient were they in converting whatever they found or were fed into meat. The osteoarchaeological record shows that farmers slaughtered almost all their pigs before they reached their third birthday, and many of them much earlier, with the exception of breeding sows and stud boars.3 But pork was not the meat that everyone ate most. That distinction, as we will see in Chapter 3, generally went either to beef or to mutton. Some people did not keep pigs at all: Greenlanders, for instance, and Jews and Muslims, as far as we can tell. There were also some Christians who did not own pigs—or at least, there were Christians who drew up wills that listed their livestock but did not mention any pigs.4 But because pigs were only ever raised for their ﬂesh, they were a kind of metonym for meat more generally. Pork inspired rhapsodies, and even miracles; in Saint Brigit’s Ireland, tree bark was turned not into ﬁshes and loaves but bacon in order to feed a crowd. And when the scholar al-Jāh.iz. wrote a massive collection about animals at the ‘Abbāsid court in Baghdad, he had plenty of faults to ﬁnd with pigs, both as a Muslim and as a naturalist. But he had also heard so many paeans to pork that he was fascinated by what it might taste like.5\n\n15\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 15\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\n16\n\na sing ul a r a nd p lur a l b e a s t\n\nEven the Christians who loved to eat pigs viliﬁed them as greedy, dirty, destructive animals. This reputation was woven into the scriptures that early medieval readers studied and quoted and incorporated into their own stories and texts. We have already seen that in the Synoptic Gospels’ account of the exorcism of Legion the demons were driven into pigs—not chickens or sheep or ﬁsh. Elsewhere in the Bible, the Prodigal Son hits rock bottom when, after spending his way through his inheritance, he is forced to take employment as a swineherd and eat what his pigs eat (Luke 15:11–32). In 2 Peter 2:22, building on one of the Proverbs (26:11), heretics are described as dogs who return to their vomit, and as clean pigs who turn right back to the mud. And the Gospel of Matthew (7:6) captures the concept of squandered resources with the image of casting pearls before swine. Augustine winked at this passage in his infamous story in the Confessions about stealing pears as a boy in North Africa—his second delinquent act was to waste what he had stolen by tossing most of his haul to a herd of pigs.6 The pig makes what is probably its most prominent appearance in the Judeo-Christian tradition in Psalm 80 in the Hebrew Bible (Psalm 79 in the Septuagint and Vulgate). In this psalm, the people of Israel ask God to show them favor again because they believe he has turned away from them. They compare themselves to a great vine that he has transplanted from Egypt. He has cleared the soil for them by removing other peoples from it, and the vine has grown so large and strong that it has come to cast shadows on the mountains and the great cedars, and it stretches from the river to the sea. But now, the Israelites lament, the vast vineyard is under siege. God has knocked down the wall that protected it, and its grapes are being harvested by passersby. Insects are swarming it. And the boar of the forest is destroying and devouring it (ﬁg. 1.1).7 In Hebrew, only the animal itself is mentioned—h.azir mi-ya‘ar—but in Greek and Latin, the boar gets an additional epithet: it is not only the aper de silva but also the singularis ferus, the singular beast. These are ancient texts, but the pig’s characterization as a ravenous and dirty animal has transcended particular historical moments. Christians in early medieval Europe made the same associations, and so do we. More than one historian has pointed this out over the years, partly with the goal of rehabilitating the animals’ reputation.8 But this ﬂat stereotype, this singular beast, was not the only proﬁle a pig could have, even in the past: “premodern” views were subtler than the shorthand symbolism suggests. In Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages, farmers, policy makers, and philosophers\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 16\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\na sing ul a r a nd p lur a l b e a s t\n\n17\n\nFig. 1.1. Psalm 79[80]:13: “The boar from the woods has destroyed [the vine] and the singular beast has devoured it.” This illustrated psalter, known as the Stuttgart Psalter after its current home, was made at the monastery of Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris in 820–830. The monk who illuminated this passage would have known both boars and vines well: in the same decade that the monastery produced this book, it also drew up a polyptych that attests to widespread viticulture on its tenancies and to extensive woodlands that were capable of feeding more than eight thousand pigs. (Stuttgart, Württembergische Landesbibliothek, Cod. bibl. 23, fol. 96v.)\n\nwere perfectly capable of holding multiple views of pigs simultaneously, of playing into a familiar caricature but also of homing in on the complexities of the species. They saw that pigs were not merely commodities that provided humans with meat, or symbols that worked as handy metaphors. They were also creatures that were capable of adapting to and altering their environments, including the human environments that only partially constrained them. Pigs were diﬃcult to fully domesticate, both physically and conceptually. They called attention to themselves and required some engagement with their complex lives. As a result, in these centuries pigs had both singular and plural meanings. “The” pig was a category of human understanding. It was a shorthand for thinking about a species that humans manipulated and evaluated. But early medieval societies also engaged with pluralized pigs, with speciﬁc and various individual pigs that had some control over the worlds they inhabited. In short, the history of the pig or pigs is a contrapuntal one.\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 17\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\n18\n\na sing ul a r a nd p lur a l b e a s t\n\nIdentifying the Animals Genesis credits Adam with naming the animals, and in the seventh century Isidore of Seville would say that the names Adam had bestowed reﬂected something about each species’ nature. And although Adam spoke Hebrew, Isidore was certain that his own native Latin still captured an essence of the things it named, too.9 But pigs went by many names in the Latin-speaking West, and in a way this capacious lexicon is symptomatic of something we will see again and again: where there were pigs in the early Middle Ages, there was diversity. Porcus and sus were the most common terms; sus shares an IndoEuropean root with English “swine” (Old English: swyn). Porcellus was a piglet, verres a boar.10 An adult pig—or more properly, a hog—could also be called maialis and sualis (or soalis or sogalis). A very little piglet could be a nefrens or lactans (literally “toothless” or “milking,” a suckling piglet), and a piglet up to a year old or so could be a bevralis, genalis, or friskinga. (In modern terminology these might be “gilts” or “barrows,” except that a bevralis in particular does not seem to have been castrated.)11 A sow could simply be a sus, but sometimes she was a troia, scrofa, or ductrix, literally a “leader” or “deliverer.” And then there was the burly beast known as the sonorpair: according to a massive law code issued by the Lombard king Rothari in 643, this was a boar (verres) that had fought and defeated all the other boars in a herd. No matter how large the herd, Rothari noted, there would only ever be one sonorpair—unless the herd had fewer than thirty pigs, in which case there would be no sonorpair at all. This word and this concept are not attested anywhere else, so it is hard to be sure what exactly Rothari meant. He may have been stressing the breeding value of an animal that had proven itself to be this tough: hence the penalty of twelve gold solidi, plus damages and replacement costs, owed by anyone who killed it.12 Nobody would have used all these words personally. The varieties reﬂect the fact that farming vocabularies were localized. Maialis tended to occur most on the Italian peninsula, for example, which is why maiale made it into modern Italian but not into Spanish, Catalan, French, German, or English. Sualis and its variants, and bevralis, genalis, and friskinga, were concentrated in the heartlands of Carolingian Francia (what is now northern France, northern Switzerland, and western Germany). In northern Iberia in the ninth and tenth centuries, porca was almost as likely to appear in a document as porcus—even though in classical Latin, porca usually designated the ridge that was formed between plowed furrows and only rarely pointed to a pig. And Ireland, which\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 18\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\na sing ul a r a nd p lur a l b e a s t\n\n19\n\nhad never been part of the Roman Empire and so never took up Latin as a native language, had its own set of terms, including mucc (pig), cráin (sow), céis (gilt) torc (boar), orc (piglet), and comlachtaid (suckling piglet). More obscure terms for pigs could be found in books. In the eighth century, a well-connected monk and scholar named Paul the Deacon produced an abridged version of a second-century dictionary that included words such as cicur (the hybrid oﬀspring of a wild boar and domesticated sow), colluviaris (a pig that ate both regular food and swill), and dissulcus (a pig whose bristles parted at its neck).13 And then there was aper: wild boar. In the early ﬁfth century Augustine of Hippo noted that wild boars were an in-between kind of animal: they were obviously not livestock (pecora) like oxen, horses, sheep, and pigs, but they also did not seem to count as wild animals (bestiae) in the same way that lions and tigers and snakes did. This was an unusually moderate position. For most ancient and medieval writers, the wild boar was unambiguously, thrillingly wild, something whose “whole body had the force of a lightning bolt,” as Apuleius had put it in the second century.14 It was typically seen to be an entirely separate animal from the pig—and very much a wild beast. This distinction may not come as a surprise. Our own taxonomies allow us to diﬀerentiate today between Sus scrofa and Sus domesticus. But before stall raising and industrialized farming became the norm, wild and domesticated pigs had been crossing their genes for about ten thousand years, and they can still interbreed today. Even though medieval farmers would not have known that deeper history, they must have been aware that wild boars sometimes mated with domesticated pigs, because most of them lived in partial or fully free-range conditions, which meant foraging in open spaces and woods. Occasionally zooarchaeologists will ﬁnd the bones of animals that are manifestly larger than those of the other domesticated pigs in a group, but smaller than those of a typical wild boar: these were plausibly hybrid oﬀspring.15 Pigs were not the only domesticated mammal to have wild counterparts roaming the early medieval landscape. The aurochs, a species of wild cattle, could be found in Europe until the seventeenth century (although it has only left trace signs on early medieval sites). In North Africa, both aurochs and Barbary sheep were eaten alongside their domesticated relatives.16 But for many people, the wild boar was far more captivating. This was because across Eurasia throughout antiquity and for most of the Middle Ages poets and hunters celebrated the wild boar as a premier big-game animal. They admired and feared it for its strength and fury. Boars could easily kill men; more than one medieval king died trying to hunt them. And even the men who killed their\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 19\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\n20\n\na sing ul a r a nd p lur a l b e a s t\n\nboars usually sustained some kind of injury in the close combat that the ﬁnal kill required. Only in the fourteenth century would the deer surpass the boar as the favorite aristocratic game in Europe.17 As a result, wild boars were asymmetrically gendered in medieval culture. People obviously knew that there were wild pigs of both sexes, but the subspecies as a whole was always thought of as masculine: the animals were boars, never sows. The Latin terms that writers used also tended to conﬂate species and gender in this way. Their terms for wild boar (aper) and the domesticated male pig (verres) were sometimes used interchangeably. So were the terms for domesticated pig (porcus) and sow (sus). But nobody ever called a wild pig a sow. Because of its masculine overtones, the Germanic name element *ebur-, “Boar,” was seen to be a respectable one to bestow on a boy, from tenant farmers to royal oﬃcials. Occasionally we meet an Ebretrudis, Ebrehildis, or Ebreverta—these were women’s names—but on the whole, *ebur- was much likelier to be attached to a man.18 Class distinction was another force splitting wild and domesticated pigs from each other. Among medievalists it is fairly well known that wild boars were a favored insignia for military gear among so-called Germanic peoples in antiquity and the early Middle Ages (so-called because “Germanic” is an agglomeration of the non- or pre-Roman societies of northern and eastern Europe that ﬂattens their engagement with Roman culture and also their diﬀerences from one another).19 But Romans celebrated the wild boar in the same spirit of martial elitism. The animal was the emblem of three legions (I Italica in Italy, X Fretensis in Jerusalem, XX Valeria Victrix in Pannonia and Illyricum, Germania, and ﬁnally Britain), and so it appeared on their equipment, too, not to mention their coinage and even their building materials.20 And when imperial aristocrats decorated their rural villas and urban homes in Late Antiquity, they so frequently commissioned mosaics depicting wild boar hunts that art historians have warned us not to take these as straightforward signs of actual hunting on the premises. Instead such scenes were strategically placed in receiving rooms as images of pure masculine power, or virtus. The hunters may even have been Christian ﬁgures: although the mosaics often incorporate themes from ancient mythology—which was part of the shared culture of the Mediterranean world—they were also compatible with a sense of Christian triumphalism over death. A similar idea was at play on Roman sarcophagi that featured boar hunts. The hunters’ courage spoke to the resolve of the occupants of the tombs, who were invariably men and boys.21 The more formidable the boar, the more admirable the hunter and patron, and so the boars on these pieces are colossal and savage (ﬁgs. 1.2–1.5): barreled bodies,\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 20\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\nFig. 1.2.

This scene is part of a mosaic called “Small Hunt” (Piccola Caccia), which ﬁlls the ﬂoor of a large receiving room that measures about 26 × 33 ft. (8 × 10 m). The Small Hunt depicts a lively, loose narrative of hunts and of sacriﬁces to Diana, the goddess of hunting. This particular episode spans about 8 × 5 ft. (2.6 × 1.6 m).

This mosaic was installed in the late fourth century in the central reception space (oecus) of the villa of Carranque, near Toledo. Its owner was Maternus, probably the same Maternus who served as pretorian prefect of the East during the reign of Theodosius. The scene alludes to the myth of Adonis, a human lover of Venus who was gored to death by a wild boar. Mars and Venus stand in the left corner, and the protagonist appears in the guise of heroic nude hunter. But the battle is not going well: one spear has already snapped, and (following the myth) an anemone by Adonis’s left foot sprouts up where his blood has spilled. There are also two injured hunting dogs, which the mosaic was careful to identify as Leander and Titurus. These names are drawn from ancient myth and literature, but they may have been Maternus’s actual dogs. Other hunting mosaics around the empire also labeled their dogs, and the names are always diﬀerent. Note the boar in the lower-right corner who is getting away: another win for the pigs.

So when the North African poet Luxorius spoke of a “wild boar of Mars” eating fodder from the hand of its master in the marbled rooms of a villa, both his Vandal and his Roman (and Roman-Vandal) audiences would have easily understood the message. This pig might act like an aristocrat, but it had gone soft.22 Anyone was allowed to hunt wild boar in the early Middle Ages, and it is not unusual to ﬁnd a few wild mammals, sometimes even wild boar, in\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 22\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\na sing ul a r a nd p lur a l b e a s t\n\n23\n\nsettlements that were not populated by conspicuous consumers. But elites so greatly prized big game animals that in the course of the Middle Ages, European governments, starting with the Merovingians in the seventh century, increasingly cordoned oﬀ speciﬁc tracts of woodland as “forests.” Doing so made them special legal spaces in which only kings and their friends could hunt—although this right was transferable to private landowners when rulers gave forests away as gifts, and sometimes elites tried to create their own private hunting parks by monopolizing woodlands for themselves.23 In the ninth century, the Carolingian court in Francia became ﬁxated on hunting as both a metaphor and a proof-test for military and imperial exercise. In the process, forest rights became such a vital form of political legitimacy that Charles the Bald would restrict his own son’s access to key hunting grounds while Charles was away in Italy, to forestall the possibility of a usurpation. (In the same pronouncement Charles also restricted his son’s ability to “receive pigs,” porcos accipere. That might have meant picking oﬀ domesticated pigs\n\nFig. 1.5. This colossal wild boar appears as part of a panorama of animal hunts on a Roman sarcophagus dating to ca. 370–380. This portion of the scene runs about a third the length of the sarcophagus (which measures 6.8 ft. [2.08 m] in all). (Rome, Musei Capitolini, Centrale Montemartini, inv. MC 837/S.

If so, Charles was also restricting his son’s ability to collect the ﬁscal revenue the king was expecting in late fall, about ﬁve months after this capitulary was issued.)24 In the high Middle Ages the kings of England would eventually designate wild boars, regardless of their haunts, as oﬀ-limits to all but the court. There were probably not very many wild pigs around in England by the thirteenth century, when those laws were ﬁrst issued. This is what the bone records suggest, at least: wild boars disappear from the animal remains on medieval settlements. Perhaps as far as the kings saw it, it would be unconscionable for the few that were left to end up in the hands of peasants.25 But even before wild boars became a legal entitlement, elites hunted them almost monomaniacally—or at least this is how such hunts were characterized by the people who watched from the sidelines. A hagiographical text written in the mid-sixth century about the bishop Caesarius of Arles complained that when wild boars ﬁlled the cultivated ﬁelds of a monastery, on an island just outside the city, the farmers working the ﬁelds tried to drive them away. But more powerful men (the counts of Arles, some Visigothic administrators, and their hunting buddies) had forced the farmers, sometimes brutally, to leave the animals alone, so they could hunt them for sport. This sort of physical abuse was probably rare, or so the hagiographers’ outrage implies, but hunters were known to let their enthusiasm run wild. They made target practice of eagles and other scavengers, even when the birds were perched on human corpses. And well into the high Middle Ages, it was not unusual for hunting parties to trample through crops in the heat of a chase. Although hunters were obligated to compensate farmers for their losses, their privilege of right-of-way was nevertheless plain and sometimes legally mandated.26 So there was an imaginative chasm between wild boars and pigs, even though wild and domesticated pigs shared land and sometimes even bloodlines in common. And to an extent, the iconography hints at this relationship. From the ﬁfth to the ﬁfteenth century, the image of “the” pig was fairly consistent, from the few representations of pigs that survive in late antique and early medieval mosaics and manuscripts (ﬁgs. 1.6, 1.7, 1.8; see also ﬁg. 4.3) to the windfall of images in the high Middle Ages in sculptures and manuscript paintings of the agricultural calendar. These are not pigs as they are commonly sketched today. These pigs are leggy, long-snouted, thickly bristled, curly tailed, and slender but brawny. Sometimes they have tusks. Often they have short manes limning the length of their spines.27\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 24\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\nFig. 1.6.

Most adult humans would have barely needed to bend over to touch an adult pig’s head, so the artist has depicted a fairly large but realistically sized specimen here. (Copyright © Österreichische Nationalbibliothek Vienna, Cod. 387, fol. 90v.)\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 25\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\n26\n\na sing ul a r a nd p lur a l b e a s t\n\nFig. 1.8. A pair of pigs appears among the “wild beasts and cattle, creeping things and winged” of Psalm 148. The drawing appears in the Utrecht Psalter, which was made at Reims between 816 and 823. (Utrecht University Library, Ms. 32, fol. 82v.)\n\nThere are some variations within this iconography that might point to actual diﬀerences in pig populations—though formal and rhetorical choices were also behind every artist’s work, which is crucial to keep in mind.28 Most of the time artists painted brown or red-brown pigs, but the leaf of an English gospel lectionary painted around the turn of the millennium shows pigs in an array of colors (ﬁg. 5.8), which are quite similar to the coat colors of pigs mentioned in the Middle Irish Bríatharogam (white, gray, black, reddish brown, and blue-black). The pigs in the British Isles were not the only multicolored herds around the turn of the millennium: a charter drawn up in the kingdom of León in 1001 mentions the countergift of one white sow (pork[a], per color[e] alba) as part of a land transaction—the implication being that there were other colors of pigs to choose from.29 And by the fourteenth century we ﬁnd images of black-and-white-spotted pigs, which is a sign of particular patterns of crossbreeding between domesticated and wild lineages, and pigs with single white stripes circling their bellies, which seems to have been characteristic of pigs that were bred especially for truﬄe hunting.30 But it is hard to tell what pig breeds were around in the early Middle Ages— what colors they came in, their postures, their dispositions, and the qualities of their meat and fat. None of these details is recoverable from their bones.31 It is hard enough to know how tall they were. By the time a cache of early medieval animal bones is excavated, a millennium or more after they were butchered, cooked, chewed, and thrown away, they are in a highly fragmentary state. It is not uncommon for pig bones to be so broken up that archaeologists have to estimate the animals’ heights—when it is possible at all—on the basis of the bones in their feet. The ﬁgures we do have suggest that a pig’s withers or shoulder height could range from about 21 to 32 inches (53–82 cm), with a rough mode of 29 inches (74 cm). A withers height of 32 inches or more was the sign of a very large pig, a wild boar, or the hybrid oﬀspring of both. In central Europe, where the woodlands were deep and full of wild boars, the pigs\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 26\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\na sing ul a r a nd p lur a l b e a s t\n\n27\n\nseem to have run larger. Thirty-two and a half inches was actually the average height at the Carolingian fortress of Roßtal in northern Bavaria, and pigs on some settlements in Poland were so massive, topping out at 40 inches or so (99–104 cm), that they may have been regularly rather than intermittently breeding with their wild neighbors. This was the case with several individuals at the hillfort and hinterland of Sypniewo, for instance, in Mazovia in the tenth and eleventh centuries.32 So in a rare Carolingian illustration of the agricultural cycle, the size of a pig held fast between a swineherd and butcher is on the larger side, but it’s still entirely realistic (see ﬁg. 1.7). The situation had been diﬀerent in antiquity. The archaeologist Michael MacKinnon discovered that Italians in the Roman Empire had bred two distinct types of pigs: a free-ranging breed that looked a lot like its early medieval successors, and a fat, smooth-skinned, short-nosed, ﬂoppy-eared pig that was fattened on the farm. Each breed had a diﬀerent purpose. The hairier, slenderer ones were for everyday eating, and the big pinkish ones were slated for sacriﬁces. Italians may not have been the only farmers doing this. In addition to the textual and visual evidence that pointed to the existence of two pig breeds, MacKinnon took the wide range of withers heights as another indication of the split. In Italy pigs’ heights ran from roughly 22 to 34 inches (57–86 cm)—which might not seem much diﬀerent from the early medieval ﬁgures were it not that the maximum sizes in the early Middle Ages are outliers rather than clusters (this is why they are likelier to represent wild animals than a diﬀerent breed, unlike the Roman pigs). We ﬁnd similar ranges in the western provinces, coinciding with the empire’s colonization of these territories. In Iberia, pig sizes ranged from roughly 23 to 32 inches (59–81 cm) in the Middle Iron Age and expanded to 25.5 to 36.5 inches (65–93 cm) after the conquest. In Gaul in the ﬁrst century CE, the size of pigs “rapidly” increased while also growing increasingly diverse up to the third century. The Romans also seem to have introduced a larger pig breed to Britain.33 After the Roman emperors lost control over the western provinces, livestock throughout these regions tended to get smaller—cattle, most noticeably, but also sheep, goats, and pigs. This was not necessarily a sign of a civilization in decline. Larger cattle are good for plowing, but they tend to produce less milk, fat, and protein. Bigger livestock also require more fodder and water. So there are advantages to smaller animals.34 And in the case of pigs, the disappearance of the fat stall-fed variety could reﬂect a change in religious practice more than anything else. Historians are starting to ﬁnd that in the third century animal sacriﬁce began to wane across the empire. (Or as the art historian Jás Elsner\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 27\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\n28\n\na sing ul a r a nd p lur a l b e a s t\n\nput it, ritual sacriﬁce “became signiﬁcantly more vegetarian.”) By the time a stream of Christian emperors began legislating against animal sacriﬁce in the fourth and ﬁfth centuries, they were condemning rituals that had mostly fallen out of style in the civic and religious life of the empire, even among polytheists. (“Mostly,” because this trend was not uniform across the provinces. An inscription from one of the cemeteries of the large Roman-Libyan settlement of Ghirza, for example, attests to a sacriﬁce of ﬁfty-one bulls and thirty-eight pigs in a single day, probably in the fourth century, as part of the ancestral celebration of Parentalia. Then again, such a spectacular slaughter would not have been commemorated in stone if it were routine.)35 So although the research on pig biometrics in Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages is still very much in progress, for now it seems plausible that farmers across the Roman West (not just Italians) were originally breeding fat, pink pigs, and then stopped—in large part because there were no longer political and religious reasons to do so.\n\nThe Spaciousness of Species Generalizing about pig breeds will get us only so far, though, because even pigs of a similar phenotype lived in vastly diﬀerent circumstances across the post-imperial West. They were able to do this because they were, and are, a ﬂexible species. Pigs were individual, social, and adaptable creatures that changed according to their contexts. Every pig needs to eat, for example, but what it eats and how it eats depends on the situation. Pigs’ diets are notoriously ecumenical. They seem to prefer acorns, beech mast, grubs, worms, summer-autumn crops like legumes and grains, and chocolate-covered raisins. (The last is speciﬁc to modern pigs: researchers use this treat as a reward.) But depending on the season and where they are raised, they will also eat other nuts, roots, rhizomes, fruits, mushrooms, sedges, grasses, arthropods, amphibians, reptiles, eggs, rodents, mollusks, ﬁsh, whey, kitchen slops of all kinds, and, if necessary, carrion and feces, including human carrion and human feces. They will chew on the bones of other livestock, including pig bones, if they come across them in the trash. According to ancient and late antique authors of agrarian manuals, sows would even eat their own piglets if no other food could be found.36 Tenants of the Rhineland monasteries of Wissembourg and Prüm were obligated to feed oats to the monks’ pigs in the winter. Millers seem to have routinely raised pigs—they often owed fattened pigs as part of their annual rent pay-\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 28\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\na sing ul a r a nd p lur a l b e a s t\n\n29\n\nments—and probably fed them grain waste at least part of the year, in addition to sending them out to the woods to feed near their riverine properties. Pigs in Ireland gorged on dandelion roots. On the Faroes it was the roots of buttercup and tormentil. In Iceland and the Scottish Isles, the Norse (that is, Viking) colonists fed their pigs mostly ﬁsh or mostly plants, depending on the farm.37 The thing was, a pig could be happy almost anywhere, even in environments that were relatively new to it. In 2005 the New Yorker’s Ian Frazier took a long look at feral hogs in the U.S. South and reported that they root up rare and diverse species of plants all over, and contribute to the replacement of those plants by weedy, invasive species, and promote erosion, and undermine roadbeds and bridges with their rooting, . . . and root up the hurricane levee in Bayou Sauvage, Louisiana, that kept Lake Pontchartrain from ﬂooding the eastern part of New Orleans, and . . . root up American Indian historic sites and burial grounds, and root up a replanting of native vegetation along the banks of the Sacramento River, and root up peanut ﬁelds in Georgia, and root up sweet-potato ﬁelds in Texas, and dig big holes by rooting in wheat ﬁelds irrigated by motorized central-pivot irrigation pipes, and, as the nine-hundred-foot-long pipe advances automatically on its wheeled supports, one set of wheels hangs up in a hog-rooted hole, and meanwhile the rest of the pipe keeps on going and begins to pivot around the stuck wheels, and it continues and continues on its hog-altered course until the whole seventy-ﬁvethousand-dollar system is hopelessly pretzeled and ruined.38 The despoliation that wild pigs have wrought on the U.S. South and Texas is the sign of a relative newcomer. These pigs are mostly the descendants of Eurasian wild boars that hunters imported in the late nineteenth century, prowling areas where human and nonhuman environments have not adapted to or learned to control them, at overpopulated levels. But although the scale of this problem is a consequence of colonialism and global trade, and therefore not representative of the early medieval situation, it speaks to the talent that all pigs have for trying, and eating, new things.39 What a pig decides to do depends on the landscape, then, but also on the pig. Pigs have demonstrably personal preferences when it comes to the ways they explore, socialize, and respond to change.40 And their habits can change, too, because pigs are strategic improvisers. They make on-the-spot choices based not only on what they already like but also on calculations that account for predators, seasons, landscapes, and the food supply relative to\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 29\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\n30\n\na sing ul a r a nd p lur a l b e a s t\n\ntheir population. All mother sows, for instance, will try to conserve resources by reducing the frequency of their nursing sessions after their piglets are two days old. Sows in industrial crates, who cannot actually move away from their litters, will instead try to sit or stand or rest on their sternums to cover their teats. (This helps, but the piglets still manage to suckle more than in the wild and in the process reduce their mother’s weight more than she would like.)41 A study that compared wild pigs living in the primeval forest of Białowieża, in Poland, to a population of wild pigs living on the edges of Kraków, found pigs’ capacities to be similarly plastic. The forest-dwelling pigs ranged farther in old-growth forests largely undisturbed by human activity, switching between eating and napping day and night. The pigs who lived in the green spaces of Kraków established a smaller home range, but they walked twice as many miles per day and restricted their movements to nighttime.42 Pigs also respond to one another, especially the pigs they know personally, by smell, sound, and sight. They have a vocal repertory of diﬀerent grunts, squeals, “grunt-squeals,” and trumpeting calls that humans are only just beginning to decode. Pigs are highly social animals in captivity (when they are permitted to socialize), as are females and their young, and groups of males, in the wild. They tend to adopt the behavior of other pigs in their group when they forage, with some variation according to their social rank, individuality, and environment.43 A miracle story recorded in the ninth century by Walahfrid Strabo, a monk and Carolingian courtier, mentions the unmiraculous fact that the herd of pigs belonging to the monks of the monastery of Saint Gall always followed one particular sow around, “as if she were their leader.” Some groups might opt for a division of labor: in late summer and early fall, in the large herds that congregate today in forested areas of Italy and Bulgaria, males and young pigs will be the ﬁrst to explore an area for food, and once they ﬁnd a safe and nutritious place the females and subadults will join them. (Wild pig societies also tend to be matriarchal.)44 So it should not be surprising that in the lab, pigs are less anxious in new places if they have another pig alongside them, and they are motivated to solve puzzles more quickly when they are rewarded with a shortcut back to their friends.45 Every pig’s capacities and choices are substantially aﬀected by its history, too, which is another reason why pigs are both highly capable and highly variable. A pig’s experiences shape its nonconscious or implicit memories, which enable the pig to acquire skills and improve its performance in familiar activities. But it also deliberately retrieves memories of its experiences to solve new problems, and it can “reverse-learn” those patterns—meaning that a pig will\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 30\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\na sing ul a r a nd p lur a l b e a s t\n\n31\n\nundo prior associations it has made when it realizes that a cause-and-eﬀect relationship no longer holds.46 Pigs’ spatial memories are complex and constructive. As wild animals they can ﬁnd food in new locations by drawing on their memories of food ﬁnding in the past to make new inferences and conclusions—although we still have a lot to learn about what kinds of comparisons and connections pigs make when they navigate.47 And as lab animals, they have proved that they like to explore and learn, not only in pursuit of a goal but also for curiosity’s sake. They prefer new objects to old ones. They prefer mazes to “environmentally impoverished” places in which there is nothing for them to do.48 This single species was therefore capable of generating many conceivable scenarios that could count as “typical” or “natural,” not only because the world itself was a vast and variable place but also because pigs responded to that dynamism with intelligence and versatility. This observation is the fruit of years of biobehavioral research, but its insights are not exclusively modern. Late antique and early medieval observers employed the idea of “species,” too—or what they usually called genus in Latin—and they also saw that these generalizations fell short. In the ﬁfth century Augustine of Hippo proposed one working deﬁnition of species that was based on sociability. He argued that all animals, including humans, naturally seek peace among their own kind (genus). That is obvious in the case of gregarious animals like sheep, starlings, or bees. But it is also true of inveterate loners. Even tigers will come together to mate, and the female will pacify her own ﬁerceness to nurture her cubs when it is time.49 But Augustine also ventured this theory of species in order to point out, as part of a larger argument he was making in City of God, that humans were not particularly adroit in thinking about larger scales and structures. Any given person’s plans for a social order might suit that person and a handful of other people, but that ostensible peace would never work for everyone. Part of the problem was that an individual’s perspective was inescapably limited. Another handicap was the fact that humans are inherently self-serving. So although we should reach conclusions and make policies only after considering multiple perspectives and acknowledging that our sense of justice is necessarily provisional and imperfect, we instead favor snap judgments that dismiss tigers as ferocious or other human beings as monstrous. Species-ness is hard to recognize and even harder to respect. Another taxonomic approach to the concept of species is perhaps more familiar to us. Species could also be deﬁned by the unique forms and behaviors\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 31\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\n32\n\na sing ul a r a nd p lur a l b e a s t\n\nthat a set of organisms shared and reproduced in their oﬀspring.50 One wellknown adoption of such a classiﬁcation system was Isidore’s encyclopedic Etymologies, which the bishop compiled in the seventh century and Europeans enthusiastically read, copied, excerpted, and rewrote throughout the Middle Ages: The pig/sow (sus) is so called because she roots up (subigat) pasture, that is, she searches for food by rooting the earth up. The boar (verres) [is called that] because he has great strength (vires). The pig (porcus) [is named] as if he were dirty (spurcus), for he gorges himself on ﬁlth, immerses himself in mud, and smears himself with slime. Horace says: “And the sow is a friend to mud.” This is also the source of the terms for “uncleanness” (spurcitia) and “illegitimate children” (spurii).51 Isidore’s characterizations here were obviously guided by lexicon as much as by nature, because his Etymologies was predicated on the idea that sign and signiﬁed had a meaningful rather than arbitrary relationship. But although we should not treat this as a straightforwardly naturalistic text, it was nevertheless the case that pigs’ familiar behaviors helped Isidore and his readers triangulate the everyday world and the Latin language to get closer to the ideas that Adam had intended to inscribe. Animals and words together were a key to divine taxonomies. Identifying species as a set of organisms with reproducible traits was analytically useful, but in Late Antiquity critics had already begun to be troubled by the limitations of this approach. According to the ﬁrst creation story in Genesis, God had made all things that would ever exist “according to its kind (or species)”—or in the language of the Vulgate, secundum genus (Gen. 1:21). But it was not clear how the intangible properties of an animal species were reproduced generation after generation. Basil of Caesarea’s explanation to his own congregation in Cappadocia in the late fourth century was that God had assigned a single soul to every species of land animal. It was because of a shared soul, for example, that all lions were courageous, solitary, proud, terrifying, and picky about their meat. All bears were lazy and secretive for the same reason. Each species’ soul determined its unique mix of sense perceptions, memories, and emotions. So although animals were not capable of reason (or education, as Basil’s Latin translator would add), they were sensitive to their environments and knew what was good for themselves, thanks to the soul that God had given them.52 Basil’s language of animal souls drew on the Aristotelian tradition of thinking about the “soul” as a life-giving force that enabled a living thing to fulﬁll\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 32\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\na sing ul a r a nd p lur a l b e a s t\n\n33\n\nits purpose, but it was not explored extensively in the Latin West. His own translator tended to blunt the force of the Greek psyche by waﬄing between anima and animus, the second of which reduced the “soul” to something more mental and metaphorical. Other Christians did not hesitate to say that animals had souls, but their interests usually lay elsewhere, and, again, their language was somewhat slippery. When Gregory the Great explained in the late sixth century that animals had souls, his preferred word was “vital-” or “lifespirit,” vitalis spiritus, a lexical choice that one of his later readers noticed was an equally polysemic term. (This reader was Dhuoda, an elite woman living in Francia in the ninth century, who discussed the passage in a book of advice for her son.) But Gregory was very much talking about souls here: he was arguing that the diﬀerence between human and animal souls was that animal souls died when their bodies did—a point that Basil had also made—whereas human souls were immortal. It was actually this latter claim that was more hotly contested in Gregory’s day. The bishop of Rome was writing to rebut Aristotelian circles across the Mediterranean who were skeptical about the afterlife of human souls. But later readers would take issue with the ﬁrst assumption as well. John Scottus Eriugena, who had read the work of both Basil and Gregory and wrote his own natural-philosophical texts in Francia in the ninth century, was not so sure that animal souls were mortal, either.53 The language of the soul aside, other accounts of species generation still shared Basil’s conviction that God had set something in motion that could continue to reproduce itself down to the very mental activities of individual animals. But this proposition provoked an additional criticism, which was that individual creatures varied considerably even within a single species. For Boethius, an aristocrat and a politician writing in the Ostrogothic kingdom of Italy in the early sixth century, this taxonomical problem was unavoidable because this was how categorical thinking worked. In his commentary on Porphyry’s Isagoge, which was itself a third-century commentary on Aristotle’s Categories, the concepts of genus and species were not absolute or ﬁne-grained. They were only meant to describe relationships between things. If you asked a man what he was, he would never say he was an animal—that’s not how conversations usually go!—but if you asked him what he and a horse and an ox were, you would get the category you were looking for. The same is true for things grouped together as a species (species: Boethius is not leaning on the genus-language of the Bible here). Members of a species have a form in common, but even then their shared taxon is a conceptual distinction that is not attached to any individual’s actual existence (natura). Humans were capable of laughter, for instance, but some people never thought anything was funny.\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 33\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\n34\n\na sing ul a r a nd p lur a l b e a s t\n\nThe only time it was possible to generalize while also being fully speciﬁc was when you were talking about a “grouping” or category that consisted of lone representatives—such as the phoenix or the moon. Otherwise, when you described a species you would only ever be approximating.54 Variation was not simply a problem with humans and their uniquely willful behavior. It was also observable in nonhuman animals. An animal might be said to act “unnaturally” and therefore hint at the presence of the supernatural, but even the “natural” order itself encompassed a great variety of possibilities.55 Augustine’s response to this in his own commentary on Genesis was that although God had established a set of ﬁnite possibilities or termini for every species, those parameters did not conﬁne any individual creature to a single trajectory. Members of a species could diﬀer noticeably from one another. They might even resemble members of another species in some ways. But crucially from Augustine’s point of view, they never became so diﬀerent as to transgress the species boundary. And it is striking that one of the species Augustine singles out in this discussion was the pig: a pig, he insisted, would never be more like a human than a pig.56 He was making his argument to a culture that was all too familiar with pigs’ many possible behaviors. These were all ways of thinking about pigs categorically, as “the” pig in the singular, whether pigs were joined by their sociability or reproducible likeness or even their iconography. But these writers and their contemporaries were also aware that such taxonomies had certain explanatory and predictive limitations—that they were inexact sciences, in other words. Such shortcomings would have been especially obvious to them in the case of animals they knew well, including pigs, and it was even more common to ﬁnd medieval societies seeing pigs in the plural, rather than generalizing about them. The animals’ changeability, and their sheer numbers, mattered. Although pigs were very nearly everywhere in the early medieval West, if you’d seen one, you hadn’t seen them all.\n\nUnruly Commodities Because pigs were able to change in response to other pigs and to their surroundings, we cannot capture precisely what any given group of pigs was like or what it was like to work with them. But the early medieval evidence we have conﬁrms that the cognitive and behavioral capacities of modern populations of domesticated and wild pigs do have striking parallels to those of pigs in the past, even though their contexts and histories are not identical. Early medieval\n\nY7714-Kreiner.indb 34\n\n5/20/20 10:36 AM\n\na sing ul a r a nd p lur a l b e a s t\n\n35\n\npigs also had a knack for learning, exploring, and taking advantage of new situations—and early medieval humans knew this, because those behaviors were taxing. But people were willing to work with pigs anyway, and their own ideas and behaviors changed in the process. Incidentally, pigs’ health was almost never a concern for the humans who raised and ate them.57 Not only were pigs generally slaughtered before the aging process set in, with all its attendant injuries and ailments. Pigs were also raised in low-density and outdoor environments that did not make them highly vulnerable to illness, in contrast to the industrial conditions they endure today.58 Sometimes pigs did get sick. Columella and Palladius, Italians who wrote farming handbooks in the ﬁrst and later fourth or ﬁfth centuries, respectively, mentioned that pigs could experience fevers, dizziness, vomiting, engorged spleens, tumors, and lung problems. Pliny the Elder, who wrote his massive Natural History in the ﬁrst century, added that they were also susceptible to madness and sore throats. Early medieval encyclopedic and legal texts identiﬁed rabies, contraction of the leg tendons, and blisters (caused by the bites of a parasite called the usia) as additional risks.59 And osteoarchaeologists occasionally ﬁnd evidence of pig pathologies in the animals’ bones: an intestinal parasite (Trichuris suis), a broken bone here and there, a diseased bone with abnormal growth, sets of crowded teeth, and cases of linear enamel hypoplasia—a deﬁciency in the calcium development of teeth that indicates stress on a pig’s diet and health.
