By far the larger proportion\n\nof armorial orders placed in the hands of tradesmen for execution are carried\n\nout with the assistance of \" Fairbairn.\"\n\nThe ever-increasing number of new families and new grants of arms, and\n\nthe constant immigration of families of foreign origin using crests hitherto found\n\nin no English book of reference, c.-eate from time to time the necessity of\n\nextensive additions to the eatries which the text contains. The large edition\n\nwhich we published in 1892 having been entirely exhausted, we availed ourselves\n\nof the opportunity afforded by the necessity of reprinting the volumf: us again submit\n\nthe work to such revision as was required to bring it up to the present date.\n\nThis, we believe, will enable the book to maintain fully its old position\n\nand reputation as the only authoritative and the most complete collection of\n\nCrests and Mottoes in use in this country, a position in which it has hitherto\n\nhad no rival. The question of the right of any particular person to the crest\n\nto which a claim is made depends upon proof of descent from the original\n\ngrantee. Such proof often amounts to a highly controversial discussion, and\n\nit has seemed to us that we were not called upon for the purposes of the present\n\nwork to adopt any such standard ; rather otherwise, because the omission of\n\na crest in consequence of a lack of proof of pedigree would create a hindrance\n\nto the use of the book by those handicraftsmen who need to refer to its pages.\n\nPREFACE TO THE PRESENT EDITION\n\nWe therefore can give no guarantee of the official accuracy on the point of\n\nrightful inheritance. The existence of the original corpus of the book, which,\n\nwhen compiled, was never based upon the requirement of an official imprimatur\n\nfor each crest, precludes therein any adoption of the official standard.\n\nThe additions to the text in the present edition have been considerable, but\n\nthe overwhelming bulk of these additions has been obtained from sources\n\nnot in themselves official, certainly, but purporting to be based upon information\n\nhaving a more or less official character. Such being the case, we can unhesitatingly\n\nassert that in the present edition the proportion of officially authorized crests is\n\ninfinitely higher than in any previous edition of the work, not even excepting\n\nthe edition of 1892. As to the remainder, the position is now as it was then;\n\nwe have no exact knowledge, and the crests may or may not be authoritative.\n\nTHE PUBLISHERS.\n\n— ——\n\nEXTRACT FROM THE EDITOR'S PREFACE TO THE REVISED\n\nEDITION OF 1892.\n\nHE origin of Heraldry has puzzled wiser and abler heads than mine ; indeed, it\n\nwould be folly to attempt, in the Preface to a Work of this character, to\n\ndiscuss the matter at all ; but the whole subject may be said to resolve itself\n\ninto the query, \" Where does mere ornamentation end, and where does\n\nHeraldry ' aswe know it' begin ?\" The generally received opinion seems to\n\nbe that the Crusades were coeval with, if, indeed, they were not the cause of,\n\nthe birth of Heraldry, its laws, and its emblems.\n\n—Undoubtedly Arms i.e., the charges and field depicted upon the escutcheon were of prior\n\norigin to crests. Consequently there are many Coats-of-Arms to which no Crest has ever been\n\nassigned, and which have no such ornament attached or belonging to them, but I have only\n\ncome across one solitary Crest which possessed a legitimate existence without a corresponding\n\nand complementary Coat-of-Arms pertaining to it. This one (borne by a family of Duckworth)\n\narose through a peculiar combination of circumstances, and has been rectified nearly a century.\n\nThe Crest is that part of the complete achievement which is placed upon and surmounts the\n\ncoronet, wreath, or chapeau, which in its turn is above the mantling or lambrequin which it is\n\nsupposed to attach to the helmet. Anciently, whilst the coronets and chapeaux were reserved\n\nfor the rank to which they appertaina.d, none below the rank of the knightly families were\n\npermitted to place their Crest upon a wreath. But both these laws- and mare, is *hc p'ity\n\nhave long been relegated to*-oblivion and at the present day, unless the Crest be speciall}'\n\n;\n\nblazoned, as upon a chapeau, or issuing from a coronet (as to the different forms of which refer\n\nto the Glossary), both of which are required to be mentioned in its Blazon, it must always be\n\nplaced upon a wreath or torse. This is supposed to be a skein of coloured silk and a gold or\n\nsilver cord twisted together, and at the present day is always of the principal i.e., the first-\n\nmentioned in the Blazon—colour and metal of the Arms, of which six alternate \"twists\" must\n\nWhenbe visible, the metal occurring first at the dexter end (see Plate i, No. 2). a \" \"\n\nfur\n\noccurs upon the Arms instead of either metal or colour, the ground tincture of the fur should\n\nbe taken.\n\nIn the next place, I wish to explain the laws governing the usage and adoption of Crests. It\n\nis not, as I have often been solemnly assured, \" simply a matter of choice \" and personal fad or\n\nfancy upon the part of the bearer, and the sooner it is fully understood the better it will be\n\n;\n\nPREFACE\n\nthat His Majesty's College of Arms in Queen Victoria Street, London ; Lyon Office, in the\n\nNew General Register House in Edinburgh and Ulster's Office, in the Record Tower of\n\n;\n\nDublin Castle, are absolutely the only legitimate or authoritative Offices of Arms within His\n\nMajesty's Dominions. So recently as 1804 the Law Offices of the Crown reported to H.M.\n\nKing George HI. that \"the Heralds have the original cognizance of Pedigrees and Coat-Armour.\"\n\nWho, then, has the right to display Armorial Bearings ? That it is a matter of the Law of the\n\nLand, in addition to conformity to Heraldic regulations, may not be generally known, but in\n\nthe Warrants directing the Visitations of the various counties and districts during the si.xteenth\n\nand seventeenth centuries, to be made in obedience to the Royal Commissions, the right is\n\nclearly laid down, and at the present day exists under as well defined limits as those which\n\n—govern and regulate the Peerage. In England for in the three countries the laws are not the\n\n—same direct legitimate male descent is required to be proved from some person to whom\n\nArmorial Bearings were recorded and allowed at the Visitations, or to whom Arms have since\n\nbeen granted or exemplified, and, failing such descent, it is necessary to petition for the favour\n\nof the Earl Marshal's Warrant to the Kings of Arms that a Patent of Armorial Bearings shall\n\nbe issued to you, if it be so desired. In Ireland, the same qualifications are necessary to inherit\n\nArmorial Bearings ; but in addition, and in Ireland only, it is within the power and authority\n\nof Ulster King of Arms, in cases where a Coat-of-Arms has been borne continuously by a\n\nfamily for four or more generations, but without lawful authority, according to his discretion,\n\nto confirm those Arms and their usage within specified limitations, with the addition of some\n\nmark which shall be readily recognisable as a sign of confirmation. In Scotland, the right to\n\nbear the Arms or Crest of a family is absolutely confined to the heir male only. All younger\n\nsons are required to matriculate their Arms and Crests in Lyon Court, when some mark of\n\ncadency is added, and their younger sons again in their turn must do likewise, and have a\n\nfurther and additional sign of cadency added to the Bearings. Though not a regulation, it\n\nappears to have been a very frequent practice upon each occasion of such matriculation to\n\nentirely alter the Crest, which accounts for the very large number of utterly different Crests in\n\nexistence for the same famJUy amongst the Scottish Ordinaries of Arms.\n\nTii .;'^,'=; \"'^•-'uch thing as the \" prescriptive right to Arms,\" as to which some people talk\n\nglibly. Others of their persuasion have other little plausibilities, equally corrupt, which they\n\nbring into prominence. And it is a fairly safe plan to pursue to reject as bogus all Arms and\n\nCrests which boast no other origin than the heraldic stationer who, for a trifling fee, professes,\n\non receipt of \" name and county,\" to find armorial bearings for any applicant.\n\nMottoes in England and Ireland are not necessarily hereditary, and unless attached to, or in\n\nany way forming a part of, the Arms or Crest, may be altered, assumed, or discarded at the will\n\nof the bearer, and borne in any position in relation to his Arms or Crest that he may fancy\n\nbut in Scotland the Motto forms a part of the grant, and is unchangeable, and is also usually\n\nrequired to be borne upon an escroll above the Crest. A practice has lately very extensively\n\narisen of using with a single surname two or more Crests. With a very few exceptions, it is\n\nonly allowable so to do in cases where one of these be of honourable augmentation, or where\n\none or both be governed by some special grant ; and in cases where, by the assumption of one\n\n—or more additional surnames, or by a change of surname, such additional Crests usually one\n\n—for each surname have been exemplified in accordance with the terms of the Royal License.\n\nNo Lady whatsoever is allowed by the Laws of Heraldry to in any way bear or use, in her\n\nown right, either Crest or Motto ; and Arms only in a special and distinctive manner.\n\nThe collection of Mottoes, with their Translations, which must of necessity form one of the\n\nfeatures of the Book, it has been thought well to submit to the revision of the Rev. James\n\nWood (Editor of \" Nuttall's Dictionary,\" New Edition), though, in justice to the erudition of\n\nthis gentleman and his scholarly attainments, it should be known that I have throughout\n\ninsisted upon the various Mottoes being spelt in the manner and retained in the actual form in\n\nwhich I have understood them to be used, even at the expense of accurate and scholastic\n\n— —spelling. Our ancestors had their own ideas frequently peculiar as to the method of spelling,\n\nand he would need be a Vandal who would cause unnecessary alterations in their quaint\n\n—conceptions. And in addition, in some half-dozen cases, in order to preserve some pun no\n\n—doubt atrocious I have asked for some translation to be allowed to stand which has not\n\nalways been as literal a rendering as was possible of the foreign tongue, for we of the ancient\n\nand honourable Science and Brotherhood of Armory dearly love a pun. The Key to the Plates\n\nhas been done in the offices of my Publishers, and in many other matters connected with the\n\nrevision and publication of this Edition of ' Fairbairn ' I have ex perienced much kindness\n\nconsideration, and assistance at their hands.\n\nThe whole of the Illustrations of the last Edition have been carefully examined. Some have\n\nbeen altered and some rejected, and over One Thousand New Crests have been added to those\n\npreviously appearing. It has been one great anxiety that the Illustrations, however slightly\n\nthey might differ, should not be quoted as correct unless they actually were so, and this will\n\naccount for the large proportion of the references being mentioned as only for purposes of\n\ncomparison. The Book was (jriginally Compiled and Engraved in Scotland, by a Scotsman,\n\nand it is a well-known fact that both Scotch blazonry and emblazonment are far freer and\n\n\" looser\" than when controlled by the \"garrulous minuteness \" of the English school of Arms.\n\nThis matter has been ably argued out (but, methinks, to a wrong conclusion), and explained in\n\nthe latest book upon the subject which has left the press (Woodward & Burnett's \" Treatise of\n\nHeraldry \"). One sentence will explain my views. When a Blazon can be otherwise correctly\n\ndepicted in two or more separate ways (and here I am not referring to mediaeval or antique\n\nstyles of draughtmanship), and further, when one of those ways only is painted upon the Grant\n\nor Exemplification, why should it be open to discussion as to the possible accuracy of any other\n\nform ? If one form be rigi^t. why is not any other shape or position wrong ?\n\nFor example, the term wliich, more than any other, has given me trouble on this score is\n\n— Myone applied to birds to wit, \" rising.\" own idea is that this should be as upon Plate 88,\n\nNo. 2. Plate 77, No. 5, is the other extreme, and is an accepted interpretation of the term in\n\nScotland ; but I have seen in the Offices and College of Arms authoritative paintings of every\n\nother possible position of the wings, short of their being \" close,\" occurring in Coats-of-Arms\n\nor Crests, and blazoned simply as \" rising.\" A little uniformity upon this and other points in\n\nthe Heraldry of the Three Kingdoms might be desirable.\n\n\" Fairbairn's Book of Crests,\" first published in the year 1859, was originally compiled\n\nby a certain -James Fairbairn, and was revised by Lawrence Butters, Seal Engraver in\n\nOrdinary to Her Majesty for Scotland. Its sale hitherto has been chiefly amongst Jewellers\n\nand Seal Engravers. Perhaps this accounts for the lamentable fact that many Crests have\n\ncrept within its pages which can but be described as bogus. To have deliberately and in cold\n\nblood verified the thirty or forty thousand Crests which the Book in its previous Editions\n\nmade mention of would have been a work of so many years' duration, and of so vast an\n\nexpense, that it could by no possibility have ever repaid such expenditure. I have not\n\nattempted to do this, and consequently I do not pretend that this Edition is absolutely\n\n\" sans peur et sans reproche,\" but I have detected and discarded a vast quantity that were\n\nwithout authority, as a moment's comparison between the two Editions will readily show.\n\nLondon, is/ October, 1892.\n\nCONTENTS OF VOL.

As some assistance to engravers, and rather than leave\n\na larger proportion than was otherwise inevitable of the crests without any reference to an illustration, the term c/. (compare)\n\nhas been used, and means that the reference is given only for comparative purposes, the plate not corresponding precisely with\n\nthe blazon ; this term, however, being only used where the difference is but slight. It will be noticed that in the illustrations\n\nof many of the new crests the colour-lines appear in the form in which they are usually used in heraldic engraving, in order\n\nto render such illustrations perfectly correct renderings of particular crests. In cases where the same engraving would be correct\n\nif of another colour, it has been thought better to use the term \" compare \" (c/.) to prevent such illustrations being considered\n\nabsolutely accurate.\n\nAAR ABE\n\nAaron, Aarons, and Aaroons, a lady's Abbot, Henry Napier, M.A., solicitor, of a ducal coronet a unicorn's head or,\n\narm from the elbow in pale ppr. 222. 3 5, Downside Road, Clifton, Bristol, between two ostrich-feathers arg.\n\nAbadain or Abaudain, a savage wxeathed a demi-unicoru erm., armed and Deo patrie amicis.\n\nabout the head and loins with laurel nianed arg., gorged with a collar az., Abbs, Durh., the sun in splendour.
