        "text": "Green History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nScotland\n\nThe name Green is an old Anglo-Saxon name. It comes from when a family lived in the village greene which was the center or main square of each region. It is derived from the Old English \"grene,\" meaning \"green,\" and was most likely first borne by a family who lived in the village greene, the center or main square of a region. Alternatively, it may have been bestowed as a nickname on someone who was particularly fond of dressing in green. 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Green family\n\nThe surname Green was first found in Kent, where the earliest record of the name was Geoffrey Greene who was recorded in a Poll Tax in 1188. As every early English village had a green, the surname Green emerged independently in many different places during the Middle Ages, thus creating several early branches of the Green family. Richard de la Grene was listed in the Pipe Rolls of Norfolk in 1200 and Geoffrey Attegrene was listed in the Assize Rolls of Lancashire in 1206. 2 The prefix \"atte\" was a popular namesake which meant in this case \"at the green.\" 1\n\nYears later, the Hundredorum Rolls of 1273 list Deonisia ate Grene and Warin de la Grene; while the Yorkshire Poll Tax Rolls of 1379 list Petnis del Grene and Adam del Grene, as holding lands there at that time. 3\n\nRecords in Scotland were very scarce, but we did find \"Roger del ('of the') Grene in Roxburghshire [who] rendered homage in 1296 [to King Edward I of England]. Master John Grene, [was] Chancellor of Moray, 1463.\" 4\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Green family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Green research. Another 84 words (6 lines of text) covering the years 1221, 1461, 1462, 1506, 1558, 1592, 1614, 1620, 1630, 1636, 1679, 1685, 1690, 1700, 1702, 1705, 1708 and 1890 are included under the topic Early Green History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nGreen Spelling Variations\n\nBefore the last few hundred years, the English language had no fast system of spelling rules. For that reason, spelling variations are commonly found in early Anglo-Saxon surnames. Over the years, many variations of the name Green were recorded, including Greene, Green, Grene, Grean and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Green family\n\nNotables of this surname at this time include:\n\nSir Thomas de Green (c.1461-1506), Lord of Greens Norton, received Boughton, Greens Norton, and large monetary grants through his inheritance upon the death of his father in 1462\n\nDr. John Green, the Bishop of Lincoln\n\nSir William Greene of Oxford, Alderman Greene of Chester\n\nRobert Greene (1558-1592), English dramatist\n\nJohn Henry Green (1636-1685), an English physician and philanthropist from London\n\nJohn Greene Jr. (1620-1708), English-born, American deputy governor of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (1690-1700)\n\nSamuel Green (c.1614-1702), English immigrant to America with John Winthrop in 1630 to become an American printer and progenitor of the Green family of printers\n\nGreen World Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Green is the 35th most popular surname with an estimated 455,121 people with that name. 5 However, in Canada, the name Green is ranked the 75th most popular surname with an estimated 32,252 people with that name. 6 And in Newfoundland, Canada, the name Green is the 34th popular surname with an estimated 618 people with that name. 7 Australia ranks Green as 39th with 45,340 people. 8 New Zealand ranks Green as 59th with 5,037 people. 9 The United Kingdom ranks Green as 19th with 120,596 people. 10 South Africa ranks Green as 470th with 15,171 people. 11\n\nMigration of the Green family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Green family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 123 words (9 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nGreen migration to the United States +\n\nTo escape oppression and starvation at that time, many English families left for the \"open frontiers\" of the New World with all its perceived opportunities. In droves people migrated to the many British colonies, those in North America in particular, paying high rates for passages in cramped, unsafe ships. Although many of the settlers did not make the long passage alive, those who did see the shores of North America perceived great opportunities before them. Many of the families that came from England went on to make essential contributions to the emerging nations of Canada and the United States. Research into various historical records revealed some of first members of the Green family emigrate to North America:\n\nGreen Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nMr. Bartholomew Green, who arrived in Boston aboard the ship \"Griffin\", bound for Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1633 12\n\nMrs. Elizabeth Green, who arrived in Boston aboard the ship \"Griffin\", bound for Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1633 13\n\nMr. Nathaniel Green, who arrived in Boston aboard the ship \"Griffin\", bound for Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1633 13\n\nSarah Green, who arrived in Boston aboard the ship \"Griffin\", bound for Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1633 13\n\nPhebe Green, who arrived in Boston aboard the ship \"Griffin\", bound for Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1633 13\n\n...

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Virtus semper viridis\n\nMotto Translation: Virtue is always flourishing.\n\nSuggested Readings for the name Green +\n\nA Branch from the Green Tree by Robert M.
