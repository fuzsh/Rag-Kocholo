        "text": "The Three main Parish Churches in Dorchester are\n\nSt Peter's, (See below) Holy Trinity & All Saints\n\nThey are of very ancient foundation being as old as the introduction of Christianity in the Kingdom of the West Saxons in the 7th Century. Further more detailed background is freely available from the book 'The History of Dorchester' by James Savage which was published in 1837. A full transcription can be viewed at google books. Most of the text given below however has been transcribed from John Hutchins book 'The History and Antiquities of the County of Dorset'. I have taken the liberty of adding some pictures which relate to the text and cross referencing to other information on this site. Though St Peter's is the largest and the principal church in the town, it is only a chapel to Holy Trinity church, and has been since 1303, and perhaps even before that; yet there are two instances in the Sarum Registers when the king presented this as a distinct Rectory. From the municipal records of Dorchester in 1657, and a legal case that arose in 1826, it is clear that the two churches were united and this for example was why the Rev. John White was appointed by the King to Holy Trinity in 1606 but often preached from the pulpit and, was eventually buried in the south porch of St Peters church in 1648. Michael Russell OPC for Dorchester\n\nThe History and Antiquities of the County of Dorset\n\n(3rd Edition published 1868 - pages 334 to 409)\n\nby John Hutchins -- Pages 379-389\n\nPart 24\n\n(3rd Edition published 1868)\n\nTranscribed by Michael Russell OPC for Dorchester - October 2016\n\nSt Peter's Church\n\nThe Parish of St Peter's is a distinct and independent one, has its own parish officers, maintains its own poor, and repairs its own church. It composes the middle part of town, and contains part of East Street, from the western bounds of All Saints' Parish to the church of Holy Trinity, and the houses lately built on the site of the old 'Crown Inn', opposite to it; also the South Street; a little square called 'Bull Stake'; the north part of Priory Lane and the Priory.\n\nSaint PETERS CHURCH stands in the centre of the town, at the higher end of the Corn Market. It is large, ancient, and well built, consisting of a chancel, body, and chancel. The north aisle is plain, its east end raised considerably higher than the rest, and embattled; and was built or rebuilt by some of the family of 'WILLIAMS' of Herringstone whose burial place is there. The south aisle is embattled, and its east end also raised. The east ends of both aisles were probably chapels or chantries. The body is compass-roofed supported by five pillars but has no windows over the arches. The tower is very neat adorned with pinnacles and battlements and is 90 feet high. There were formerly five bells which in 1734 were re-cast and augmented to eight, chiefly at the expense of the representatives [of the borough]. Here is a clock and chimes. The whole fabric is tiled.\n\nThis church is one of the principal architectural ornaments of the High street of Dorchester. It stands on the north side of the street, nearly opposite the end od South street; and besides the parts mentioned above by Hutchins has a south porch and an organ chapel, which later was added when the edifice was restored and some portions rebuilt in 1857. The aisles are about 46ft in length by 43 ft in width, the chancel about 23½ft in length by 19½ft in width. The work done at this date comprised the rebuilding of the east end in a style in accordance with the other characteristics of the edifice. A gallery which formerly spanned the west end of the nave was taken down, and the organ, which stood under the tower arch, was removed to a chapel on the north side of the north chancel aisle, built for its reception at the expense of Herbert and Robert WILLIAMS Esq'rs. This organ is a fine instrument by Bishop, was erected in 1824. A new roof was placed upon the chancel, and the church was newly floored and furnished with appropriate fittings, including a handsome reading desk and lectern, carved in old oak. A reredos of Caen stone, consisting of a succession of panels in carved and sunk work, was erected under the east window of the chancel. The arcades of the nave are composed of four pointed arches on each side, of uniform design. The pillars have an attached shaft on each cardinal face with a moulded space between, and the shafts have circular capitals with octagonal bases and plinths. The arch between the nave and chancel is of similar character. The arch at the west end of the nave into the tower has also attached shafts with capitals and bases, and a bold wave moulding and fillets between. All the arches are about the same date, namely the early part of the fifteenth century. The side chapels of the chance are connected both with the chancel and aisles by wide and lofty pointed arches, which have the soffits paneled like those of the nave of Sherborne abbey, and are of the latter part of the fifteenth century. In the south pier of one of these arches opening into the north aisle are the remains of the stairs to the rood-loft, a doorway having been formed in the paneling. This was subsequently adopted as the approach to the pulpit, which is a good example of Jacobean character, standing in the nave close to the north side of the chancel arch (picture right taken by myself 2012)\n\nThe east window of the chancel has five lights and is of modern construction, but corresponds in character with the ancient work. It is filled with stained glass, and a brass plate in the cill bears the inscription:\n\nThis window was erected AD MDCCCLVI (i.e. 1856) to the memory of Thomas COOMBS of this town who died xiiith May MDCCCLII (i.e. 13th May 1852) aged lxxv (i.e. 75) by Emma his wife who died iind Novr MDCCCIXI (i.e. 2nd Nov 1861) aged IXIV (i.e. 64) In remembrance of whom this tablet is placed here by their affectionate children [Note:- Link to more information about Thomas COOMBS(1777-1852) Attorney of Dorchester. Tablet erected by his surviving children Henrietta and Arthur Coombs]\n\nThe old east end had a projecting window of a debased style, which was surmounted by an ugly elliptical window of wood.\n\nThe windows of the aisles and chapels are of three lights, with cinquefoil heads, with trefoil abatement lights and quatrefoil at the apex, under a pointed arch.\n\nThe south door under the porch is a curious example of Transition-Norman, the arch pointed and richly ornamented with mouldings of a purely Norman character. The jambs are champhered, and the arch-mouldings stopped by small carved brackets of Early-English character.\n\nThe roof of the nave is of a form very commonly occurring in this country. It is cylindrical with arched and horizontal ribs, dividing the surface of the vault into panels. Carved bosses ornament the intersections. The compartments are now plastered, covering the carved rafters which were probably shown when first constructed.\n\nExteriorly the aisles have buttresses with two moulded sets off and small pinnacles, between the windows; at the angles are double buttresses. The parapets are embattled, with the moulding continued round the embrasures, and below the string-course of the parapet, and over each buttress are boldly carved gargoyles, grotesques representations of birds and animals.\n\nThe Tower is 90ft in height and 15ft square; it has clustered pinnacles, embattled parapet, &c. The west door has a pointed arch with good mouldings, and over this a large three-light window, with transom and cinquefoil heads to the lights above and below.\n\nThe Bells bear the following inscriptions:\n\n1.

After speaking of the north aisle, Hutchins says, \"Below in the fourth window of the aisle, lies on a stone coffin the effigy of a man cross-legged, completely armed in a coat of mail and helmet which covers the greater part of the face, and resembles those which Speed, in his chronicle, represents on the seals of Henry II and Richard I. He has a belt, spurs, sword, and shield, on which last are no arms. His head rests on a cushion, his feet on a lion or a dog. If this represents a crusader who either vowed or actually made an expedition to the Holy Land, it must be ancient. The first crusade was published by Pope Urban II. at the Council of Clermont in Auvergne, 1095. Ptolemais was taken by the Sultan of Egypt 1291, with which ended the Holy War.\n\n\"In the south window is another effigy in all respects like the former. Mr COKER says that the monuments in the windows of this church belonged to the Chidiocks, founders of the priory, and were removed with others hither as he had heard, when the priory church was pulled down. That these effigys are cross-legged, is no objection to their representing some of the Chidiock family, whose pedigree, given before p 257, goes back to the beginning of the reign of Edward I. One of these figures is said by tradition to be founder of the church, and vulgarly called Geffery VANN, or rather ANN, for about 1680 was dug up in a garden in this town a seal, and round it 'Sigillum Galfridi de Ann'. It was in the possession of the late Colonel Michel A family of this name was anciently seated at Winterbourne-Faringdon.\n\n(2) Effigy of a medieval knight - St Peter's church, Dorchester\n\n© Copyright Mike Searle and licensed for reuse under this Creative Commons Licence\n\nAs will be seen by the succeeding description, this account of our author's includes many serious errors. The monuments are not in the same position as when he wrote, but the tombs on which they originally rested were probably destroyed before his time. There is a tradition that the effigies have been removed from some other locality, but it is unknown whether it rests upon any authority of value. The figures resemble each other in almost every respect, the difference between them consisting only of a few trifling details. They are both executed in stone, are cross-legged, the armour of plate, with the usual exception of the mail gorget or camail and gussets. The helmets or basinets are conical, and the features strongly marked. The heads rest on helmets, lions are at the feet, and shields are suspended from the left arms. The top of one of these latter is cut in a fashion which gives it a resemblance to an heraldic \"chief\". Round the basinet of one of the figures is an ornamental wreath, which in the other is wanting, and round the bodies, above the hips, are ornamental belts. The heads are raised unusually high, and the bodies, which exhibit in a slight degree the forms of the muscles, rest partly on one side. The hands are covered with gauntlets, the right one holding the belt, and the left one laying on the body. The principal difference is in the ornaments round the basinets and the covering of the feet, being in the one case plate, in the other scale armour. The heels of one are armed with spurs having large rowles. The most remarkable circumstance, however, connected with the effigies, is the fact of their being represented cross-legged, as at this date, judging from all other circumstances of detail, belongs to the end of the fourteenth or beginning of the fifteenth century, probably the former, thereby establishing the fact that their position, which has generally been supposed to represent a crusader or knight templar, has nothing to do exclusively either with one or the other, although no doubt during the period antecedent to the dissolution of the society of the Templar's they were so represented on their tombs.\n\nThere are no remains of painting on any part of the effigies, but there can be no doubt that many of the details which no longer appear were exhibited in colour, such as the bearings on the shields, &c., the loss of which renders it extremely difficult to identify them with the family or individuals they were intended to represent. The bodies are covered with a close fitting surcoat, which is finished below the belt with an ornamental scallop, leaving about two inches of the chainwork of the haulberk exposed below it. Monument to Sir John WILLIAMS:\n\nMonument to Sir John WILLIAMS in St Peters Church Dorchester\n\nAt the end of the north chapel, on a platform of masonry raised about 10ft from the floor, is an ornamental altar tomb and arched canopy, erected for Sir John WILLIAMS of Herringston, knight and his lady. it formerly stood on a raised tomb or mausoleum, which contained coffins, under the paneled arch which opens into the chancel, where it was a conspicuous and handsome object. Unfortunately however, it was found to interfere with the convenience of the congregation making use of this part of the aisle, as it obstructed both sight and sound, and, when, the church was restored and renewed in 1857, it was deemed expedient to remove it. It was then placed in its present awkward and incongruous position, where it is seen to great disadvantage, and its whole character is seriously impaired; whilst it blocks up the lower portion of the handsome east window, the effect of its heraldic decoration and other coloured ornaments is marred by the brighter hues of the stained glass immediately behind it. The monument consists of a central altar-tomb having square canopies on the same level at each end, respectively supported by four circular pillars with foliated capitals, and from the inner side of these canopies springs a massive circular arch with highly ornamented soffit and architrave, the whole surmounted by a sculptured and painted shield of arms, with the crest of Williams. As it stood under the arch, it was of course formerly visible on all sides, but one side which was ornamented similarly to the other with the exception of some of the coats of arms is now entirely hidden by the position it at present occupies. As remarked by Hutchins \"it is adorned with painting, guilding and carved work\", and is as rich a heraldic tinctures and devices combined with quaint sculptured ornamentation can make it. Under the respective canopies are the life size figures of Sir John and Lady WILLIAMS kneeling with the hands joined and upraised in the posture of prayer, and the eyes directed upon an open book which lies before each of the figures on the sloping ends of the altar-tomb. The knight is represented in full armour, bareheaded, with profuse moustache and pointed beard; the lady is in the well known costume of the period, and conspicuous in the habits of both, are the large stiff collars or ruffs then worn. The sides of the altar-tomb are divided into three compartments or panels, the central one containing the inscription hereafter given, and in each of the others is a sculptured and painted shield, one of which bears the arms of Williams, the other those of Uvedale, with their respective quarterings. The same arms are also impaled on the shield which surmounts the arch, viz Baron, Quarterly of six, 1. Argent, within a bordure engrailed gules, charged with crosses patée or and bezants, a greyhound courant in fess between three Cornish choughs proper, Williams. 2.

On the lady's canopy, \"TAVNT QUE JE PVIS, 1628,\" and over that, on a chapeau gules, turned up ermine, an ostrich feather argent; the cest of Uvedale.\n\nThe covering of the altar-tomb is about two feet in height, of a pyramidal form, with the apex cut off, on the top of which are carved and painted crests of Uvedale and Williams, standing on each side of an object which has a sun in glory painted on its circular disc, and the words \"Fugit hora\". At intervals, on the architrave of the arch, eleven shields are sculptured, with arms painted on them, and there are also painted shields on the frieze of the cornice over the canopies. These are arranged by Hutchins, in his description, as folloows, but some of the shields seem to have been transposed when the monument was removed to its present site.\n\nOn the front of the Cornice of Sir John's canopy, these coats from east to west (north side) -\n\nI.

All that Denzil's wit or courage, probity or industry, presaged in his youth he made good and exceeded when a grown man, for, as his excellent endowments and abilities made him early known to his prince and country, so he could, by his eloquence and valour, intrepidly defend the liberty of the last without refusing the obedience that was due to the former. When the rights of the nation were barbarously invaded by that army which the Parliament levied to secure them, he bore the violence and injustice of his enemies as it became a finished hero. Nor could losses, exile, or his hatred to the factious make him forget the love that he owed to England. After the restoration of the Monarchy he was created Baron of Ifield by King Charles the Second, and had the honour or representing him in two extraordinary embassies, the one to Lewis the French King, who no less admired the generosity whereby he maintained so high a character than he dreaded that virtue he was not able to corrupt by his magnificent presents, which were more princely refused than offered. No part of his reputation was diminished when he went afterward as plenipotentiary to the treaty at Breda. His learning was unaffected, useful, and general; but not to be exceeded by any in the knowledge of the ancient records of the kingdom, and the distinct powers of the several parts of the administration. So true a friend, HE was as great a patron to religious as to civil liberty, which made him universally beloved and lamented, when he peaceably ended a long and glorious life the 17th February, in the year of Christ 1679(1), in the eighty-second year of his age. This monument is therefore dedicated to his memory for the honour of the present age as well as an example to posterity by his nephew's son and heir, John Duke of Newcastle. \"MDCXCIX\"\n\nDenzil HOLLES 1st Baron Holles of Ifield\n\nAt the restoration of the church in 1857 his monument was removed to the west end of the north aisle.\n\nLord Orford describes Denzil Lord Holies as:-\n\n\"A character very unlike the Earl of Bristol's; the one embraced a party with levity and pursued it with passion; the other took his part on reflection, and yet could waive it, though his passions were concerned. The courage of Digby blazed by choice, that of Holles burned by necessity. Through their lives, the former acted from the impulse of great parts, the latter of common sense; and in both, the event was what in those cases it generally is. Digby was unfortunate and admired; Holles was successful and less renowned. On a strict disquisition into the character of the latter, he seems to have been a patriot both by principle and behaviour, and to have thoroughly understood the state of his country, and its relations with Europe; its dangers from royal power, from usurpation, from anarchy, from popery, from the increase of the French empire: on every crisis I have mentioned he acted an honest and careful part. He early opposed the enormous exertion of the prerogative by Charles I. and his ministers, carrying up the impeachment against Laud, suffering a severe imprisonment from his public spirit, and being marked by the King in that wild attempt of accusing the five members. Yet he seems to have been one of the first alarmed at the temper of those who proposed to chastise as well as correct, and who meant to retain the power as well as the office of punishment.\n\nAt the treaty at Oxford, where he was one of the commissioners from the Parliament, he ventured, in hopes of healing the distractions, to advise the King what to answer, an employment that clashed a little with his trust, and in which his sagacity did not shine; for, though the King followed his advice, it had no effect. However, the intention seemed upright, and his so easily forgetting the personal injuries he had received reflects great honour on his memory. He refused to act in the prosecution of Lord Strafford, who was his brother-in-law, and against the bishops, yet he was esteemed the head of the Presbyterian party; and, in the Isle of Wight, advised his Majesty to give up episcopacy.\n\nThe defects of his character seem to have been, that his principles were aristocratic,(a) demonstrated by experience to be the most tyrannical species of government, and never imbibed but by proud and self-interested men; that his opposition to the army was too much founded on a personal enmity to Cromwell; and that he sat on the trials of the regicides, who at worst but chastised the faults which his lordship pointed out. Lord Holles acted zealously for the Restoration, and, while the dawn of the King's reign was unclouded, accepted employments and embassies from the crown consistent with his honour and duty to his country. As soon as the Catholic rudder was uncovered, he again reverted to patriot opposition. When Sir William Temple's privy council was established, Lord Holles, though 82 years of age, yet never thinking himself past serving his country, accepted a place in it, but died soon after. His memoirs, which he wrote while in exile in France, are little more than the apology for his own conduct, and a virulent satire on his adversaries. The extraordinary wording of the dedication takes off all hopes of impartiality. It is addressed \" To the un paralleled couple, Mr. Oliver St. John, his Majesty's solicitor-general, and Mr. Oliver Cromwell, the Parliament's lieutenant-general, two grand designers of the ruin of three kingdoms.\" Much temper was not to be expected from an exile in a religious and civil war. From the extreme good sense of his lordship's speeches and letters one should not have expected that weak attempt to blast Cromwell for a coward. How a judicatory\n\nin a Temple of Fame would laugh at such witnesses as a Major-general Crawford and a Colonel Dalbiao ! Caesar and Cromwell are not amenable to a commission of Oyer and Terminer.(b) \"\n\nHutchins page footnotes:-\n\n(a) Yt has been objected to me that Lord Holles's writings seem to argue for democracy, but it is certain that the tenor of his conduct and of his \"Memoirs\" was to oppose and revile the low born and popular leaders as soon as they had deprived his lordship and his associates of their ascendance in the commonwealth. It is in vain for a man to pretend to democratic principles who prefers monarchy to the constitutional, natural, and necessary consequences of democracy. --Royal and Noble Authors, vol.ii.pp28-32.\n\n(b) From Appe4ndix in last edition of this work.\n\nHutchins continues, \" In a vault near this lies Sir Francis Ashley, knt. and his lady, eldest daughter and co-heir of Bernard Samwayes, esq. of Toller Fratrum.(c ) \" In another his sole heiress and daughter, wife to Lord Holles, and one of their children. He was descended from the Ashleys of Wimborne St. Giles, and was of the Middle Temple, and reader there 1610. In 1615 he was made serjeant-at-law, and knighted 1618; was appointed steward of the Marshalsea of the king's household, 1 Car. 1625; king's serjeant, and recorder of this borough. He died at Serjeants' inn, Meet street, Nov. 28, 1635. \"\n\nJust below the step by which you descend from the chancel into the nave is this inscription on a plate of brass, in very old characters :\n\nHic jacent Will'us Sillon et Johanna ux ej [Here lie William SILLON and Johanna his wife - Hutchins also states in his notes \" This brass is not found in 1865\"]\n\n\" On a grave-stone near the former, in capitals:\n\nGILBERTUS EDWARDUS ARCHER, M.D. - OB.

Here was one chalice ; the revenue employed to repair the church. The RECTORY\n\nThe return to the commission, 1650, for St Peter's, was, they had no parsonage or vicarage till after the expiration of a lease for two years yet to come, and then there is payable £80 per annum to the minister out of the impropriate parsonage of Fordington. Mr Stanley GOWER is minister. No chapel, nor is the church to be united. No nee4d for a new church or chapel, or of a division of the parish.\n\nAlthough independent of any other church or chapel, fromthe smallness of its revenues, it seems to have been frequently held in connection with the rectory of Holy Trinity.\n\nJune 26, 1657\n\nWhereas by the charter or ordinance of Parliament for the impropriate parsonage of Fordington there is provision made of eightie pounds a yeare for the minister of Peters in Dorchester, Wee the Mayor, Bailiffs, Aldermen and capital Burgesses of Dorchester aforesayed, by whose sole procurement the said charter or ordinance was obtayned, do hereby declare that our intention thereby wasnot to make Peter's a distinct parish from TRinity, but for the enabling of the Rector of Trinityto keepe and mayntayne an assistant for the better supply of the two churches of Trinity and Perter's, which time out of mind beyond the memory of man have always bin held and supplyed by the Rector of Trinity and his curate or assistants; and whereas by reason of some expressionsin the sayed charter or ordinance some question hath arisen about the manner of bringing in the sayd assistant to cleare up our meaning and intentions therein we have thought fitt to declare, and wee do hereby declare Mr. Stanley GOWER minister of Trinity and Peter's, as Mr WHITE and his predecessors have formerly bin, and that the sayd eightee pounds per annum is vested in him for the benefit of an assistant, hereby desiring Mr GOWER to assign the payment thereof to such assistant minister as the sayd mayor signifie his consent under his hand that the arrears of the sayd eighteie pounds per annum during the vacancy of an assistant already due together with whatsoever profits shall arise by reason of any future vacancy shall be proportioned and disposed of by the sayd mayor and corporation as they in their judgements shall judge most agreeable to the ends for which it was obtayned. In Witness whereof wee have hereunto sett our hands, Thomas SYMONDS Maior, &c\n\nI do willingly consent to this order,\n\nStanley GOWER, Minister of Trinity and Peter's in Dorchester\n\nThe Testa de Neville shows that in time of King John it was a distinct rectory:-\n\nThe church of Saint Peter, in thr free borough of Dorchester, is in the gift of the King, of which one moiety is vacant, value 30s., and the other moiety is held by Master Alexander de Dorset of the gift of King John, value 30s.\n\nHutchins says, \"Through it is the largest, best, and principal church of the town, it is only a chapel to the Holy Trinity, and has been so since 1303, and perhapsbefore; yet there are two instances in the Sarum registers of institution wherein the King presented, as a distinct rectory, viz Galfrid de Hardwick, presented by the King to this rectory, inst. Nov.1350, on the resignation of Simon Macy. John ROLAND was presented by the King to this rectory on the death of John ROPKYN inst. 27 April 1379. But it is to be observed that Macy, Roland, and ROPKYN were also rectors of the Holy Trinity. In the Valor 1291 it is joined with the Holy Trinity; but it is not mentioned in the modern Valor.\"\n\nIn Jan 1752, on the death of Dr.Leigh, the Rev John HUBBOCK received a sequestration authorising him to take the profits of St. Peter's.\n\nIn 1781 the Rev N.TEMPLEMAN succeeded to it in the same manner, and in 1813 the Rev H.J.RICHMAN also obtained a sequestration. In August 1821 the Rev.John Morton COLSON, LLB was presented by the Lord Chancellor in right of the Crown, and in Oct 1822 instituted and inducted. In 1830 Mr COLSON vacated, and was agaion presented by the Lord Chancellor. The income os St Peter's upon Mr. COLSON's first institution consisted only of £15 per annum, arising from surplus fees and Easter offerings, with a moiety of some tithes of gardens in the parish ; but, upon a representation made to the Governor of Queen Anne's Bounty, they endowed the Rectory with £2000, and further private benefactions were then bestowed £200 by the Earl of Shatesbury, £500 by Francis John BROWNE, and £500 by Robert WILLIAMS Esq M.P. Upon this the Governors of Queen Anne's Bounty were pleased to contribute a further sum of £1500 out of Parliamentary-grant funds. All these sums with the exception of £750, disbursed in the purchase of a parsonage house in the adjoining parish of Fordington, are invested in the Three per Cent Annuities. Mr Colson died Sep 14th 1863 and in the following yearthe Rev Edmund Ward PEARS MA of Magdalen College Oxford and formerly curate of Stoke Goldington Beds was instituted on the presentation of the Lord Chanc, and is the present incumbant.ellor Genealogical Notes:-\n\n(1). Although the memorial states Lord Holles date of death to be 17th February 1679 his burial took place at St Peters church in Dorchester on 10th April 1680. If he was 82 he was born in 1598. 1680 has been accepted as the year of his death in the Dictionary of National Biography\n\n(2). There is an earlier Charter in the Municipal Records of Dorchester (not listed by Hutchins) which refers to the Fraternity of the Blessed Mary which is Charter No. 22 dated in 1396. [Follow link]\n\n(3). The 21st year of the reign of Richard II ran from 22nd June 1397 to 21st June 1398\n\n(4). John HUTCHINS quoted Charter is also in the Municipal Records being Charter 31 and is recorded on page 127. It is an abbreviated entry and if you follow the link provided it is evident that it was John BRAY not John GRAY as recorded\n\n(5). Thomas WOLPENNE painter of Dorchester then sold the property to Thomas BAKER in Charter 33 which is dated 1397 and again refers to the Fraternity of the Blessed Mary . The following year in 1398 Thomas BAKER in turn sells the property on to John PAYL [PAIL] of Fordington in Charter 35\n\n(6). The 3rd year of the reign of Edward IV ran from 4th March 1462/3 to 3rd March 1463/4. The Charter referred to is well out of date order being recorded in the Municipal Records of Dorchester as Charter 560"
