        "text": "Derby Academy, a Pre-Kindergarten through Grade 8 coeducational day school located in Hingham, Massachusetts, seeks an Upper School (Grades 6-8) History Teacher. This full-time position begins in August 2024.\n\nRooted in the school’s motto, “ Improve Both Mind and Heart ,” Derby provides students with a joyful and rigorous academic environment. The Derby Academy History Department values the role of history in educating the whole child, focusing on themes of identity, diversity, inspiration and empathy. The formal history curriculum begins in Grade 6 with a multiple perspective exploration of the theme of American identity. The theme of identity is continued in Grades 7 and 8, broadening to the Atlantic World and non-Western societies. Students are encouraged to explore their own identity as they also learn about the complicated interaction between history and identity in various societies. Using identity as the overarching framework gives students the “glue” necessary to branch out and explore a diverse, sophisticated set of historical events and themes.\n\nThrough a focus on primary sources, our history curriculum removes the passive nature of “learning the facts” of the past from textbooks. Students will come to understand the process of interpretation by which history is created. They will be challenged to think, analyze and write as professional historians. Students will learn the historical thinking skills needed to successfully reconstruct the past: sourcing, bias awareness, contextualization and corroboration.\n\nAn Upper School teacher (Grades 6-8) will work with the History department and grade-level colleagues for planning. In addition, the teacher will serve as an advisor responsible for the social emotional health and development of their students. Derby offers a variety of electives and teachers are expected to teach an elective either in a passion area or an area the teacher is interested in exploring. Athletics is an important component of our program and all students in grades 6-8 are required to play sports, therefore coaching a sport is also required. Applicants for this position may also be considered for History Department Chair.\n\nThe ideal candidate will demonstrate:\n\na deep understanding of middle childhood;\n\nmiddle school teaching experience;\n\nenthusiasm, flexibility, and a desire to collaborate with colleagues on a grade level, department level and across disciplines;\n\ndesire to develop curriculum that focuses on authentic, real-world application of learning;\n\nexperience with and commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion practices and the impact they have on the curriculum and the community;\n\nsuccessful experience developing active and inclusive learning spaces in which students feel safe, honored, appreciated, and respected for who they are;\n\nthe ability to create activities and opportunities that encourage curiosity, exploration, innovation, problem-solving, and the use of technology;\n\nsuccess in creating a supportive classroom environment in which students can learn and interact positively with one another through student-centered instruction, collaboration and authentic assessment;\n\nsuccess in communicating with parents to provide timely and appropriate feedback regarding student progress;\n\na growth mindset when it comes to engaging with relevant and mission-driven professional learning to grow their practice;\n\ndesire to be involved in the school outside of the classroom;\n\nthe ability to consistently exercise discretion and good judgment;\n\nthe leadership qualities to inspire, motivate, and develop students;\n\nthe ability to nurture a deep feeling of community through actions and attitudes;\n\nstrong planning, problem-solving, and communication skills along with exceptional written, oral, interpersonal, and presentation skills;\n\nBachelor’s or Master’s degree in education and previous teaching experience; teacher certification preferred.\n\nA competitive salary and benefits package includes generous funding of professional development.\n\nDerby Academy is committed to building a diverse, equitable and inclusive educational community and does not discriminate on the basis of age, race, religion, gender, color, veteran status, physical ability, sexual orientation, national or ethnic origin or any other state or federally protected classifications.
