        "text": "ARMS: Or a Rose Gules surmounted by another Argent both barbed and seeded proper on a Chief Sable three Stags' Heads caboshed of the third.\n\n*CREST: Out of a Mural Crown Or a Dragon wings elevated Sable holding in the dexter claw a Pick Or and collared Argent.\n\n*SUPPORTERS: On the dexter side a Stag and on the sinister side a Ram both proper each gorged with a Chain Or pendent therefrom a Rose Gules surmounted by another Argent both barbed and seeded proper.\n\nMotto 'BENE CONSULENDO' - By good counsel.\n\nArms granted 17th September 1937. Arms re-granted and crest and supporters granted 1975.\n\nThe Tudor rose has been an emblem of the County for many years, having appeared on an unofficial device which preceded the the grant of arms. The stags' heads are from the Cavendish arms of the Duke of Devonshire.\n\nThe dragon crest, with metal collar and pick, symbolises the county's foundation by Danes, men of dragon ships, and the county's mining and engineering enterprise. Dragons traditionally amass underground and guard great mineral wealth.\n\nThe stag and ram have special significance for Derbyshire. Deer are closely associated with the county, founded by Danish invaders of the ninth century, who named their first fort, Derby, for the wild deer that were so abundant in the area. Sheep were introduced in the New Stone Age. They were the foundation of local farming, and later provided raw materials of early cloth and leather industry on which the county's towns were based. The ram is also the county's regimental mascot.\n\nThe arms incorporate elements from the heraldry of four important County families, three of whom became Earls of Leicester.\n\nThe ermine cinquefoil is that of the Beaumont family, in 1103 Robert de Beaumont was made the first Earl of Leicester. The Earldom eventually passed through the sister of the fourth Earl (FitzParnel) to her husband Simon de Montfort (1206-1264), from whose arms the white doubled tailed lion on red is taken. Simon also held the Honour of Hinckley, to which appertained arms consisting of a shield parted palewise indented silver and red, from which is derived the fessewise indentation in these arms. The ermine plume is the badge of John of Gaunt (another Earl of Leicester) and the black sleeve is the badge of the Hastings family, who built castles at Kirby Muxloe and Ashby-de-la-Zouch.\n\nThe running fox refers to fox hunting, which first originated in an organised form in Leicestershire in the 1690's.\n\nThe bull and ram symbolise the County's original major industries, grazing and wool. The bull's coronet represents the link with the Duchy of Lancaster, several Earls of Leicester were also Dukes of Lancaster.\n\nThe motto again refers to fox hunting, it is placed between a hazel leaf and a red martlet, which refer to Lord Hazlerigg, Lord-Lieutenant of Leicestershire from 1925 to 1949 and Lieutenant Colnel Sir Robert Martin, Chairman of the County Council from 1924 to 1960.\n\nThe silver and blue wavy band indicates the coast line and the inland waterways network of the County and the ermine band symbolises Ermine Street, the Roman road which serves the length of the County. The four gold fleur-de-lys are taken from the arms of the City of Lincoln.\n\nThe Lapwing indicates the natural fauna of the County between two silver feathers recording the confirmation by Charter of the granting by Eaward I of the title of Prince of Wales to his son on 7 February 1301 at Nettleham, near Lincoln.\n\nThe supporters are Officers of the 10th Regiment of Foot - the Lincolnshire \"Yellowbellies\" (now incorporated in the Royal Anglian Regiment) - with drawn swords and in the uniform of 1795.\n\nThe green background represents the extensive verdure of the County and the blue and white waves the River Trent, which flows through the southern and eastern parts of the County. The golden oak tree bearing acorns recalls the ancient Queen or Major Oak (reputed to be the largest in England) in the Royal Forest of Sherwood, which in olden times extended over a large part of the western half of the County and was the traditional haunt of the legendary Robin Hood.\n\nThe mural crown is a common symbol of civic government and the sheaf of corn and the miner's shovel blade represent agriculture and coal mining respectively - these being the major industries of the County.\n\nThe black lion with double tail is from the heraldry of the Dukes of Portland and the white greyhound from that of the Dukes of Newcastle and commemorate the fact that a member of one or other of these ducal families has for generations most frequently held the Office of Lord Lieutenant of the County. The Saxon Crowns are indicative of ancient Royal connections with Nottinghamshire.\n\n*ARMS: Vert a Pale wavy Or a Bordure Argent charged with five Horseshoes Sable on a Chief of the second between two Lozenges a Cresset Sable fired proper.\n\n*CREST: On a Wreath of the Colours the Battlements of a Tower proper issuant therefrom between two Abbatical Crosiers Or an Oak Tree proper fructed and ensigned by a Crown of Fleurs-de-Lys Gold.\n\n*SUPPORTERS: On the dexter side a Unicorn Argent armed and crined Or gorged with a Collar pendent therefrom a Cross flory Gules and on the sinister side a Leopard proper gorged with a Collar Gules pendent therefrom a Fleur-de-Lys Or.\n\nMotto 'PER LABOREM PROGREDIMUR' - We make progress through hard work.\n\nGranted 18th October 1989.\n\nThe Borough of Amber Valley was formed by the amalgamation of the Alfreton Urban District, the Belper Urban District, the Heanor Urban District, the Ripley Urban District and the Belper Rural District.\n\nThe gold wave on the green background represents the River Amber in its valley within a white border, like the arms of the Ripley UDC, charged with five of the six horseshoes from the arms of the de Ferrers family, founders of Darley Abbey which bore the Ferrers arms and owned much of the present borough area. The two black diamonds and flaming cresset or fire-basket, like those in the arms of Alfreton UDC, indicate the coal and iron mining industries so important in the development of the area.\n\nThe tower battlements, like that in the crest of Belper RDC, refers to Codnor and other local castles and strongholds. The oak tree recalls Duffield Forest, with gold acorns an allusion also to the Oakes family prominent in Alfreton's industrial history. The tree is topped by an ancient crown of fleurs-de-lys similar to that of Henry III who often hunted in the 'Frith' Forest and had numerous possessions therein. The two gold abbatial crosiers are for Darley and Beauchief Abbeys. The mantling also refers to Heanor's textile Industry.\n\nThe unicorn is derived from the unicorn's head in the crest of Ripley. This in turn is from the crest of the Wright family, used by the Butterley Company of which John Wright was a co-founder in 1790. It wears the red collar from the neck of the popinjays or parrots of the Curzons of Kedleston; hanging from this is a red 'cross flory' from the arms of the Outrams of Butterley, co-founders of the Butterley engineering firm. The leopard is one of the supporters of the arms of the Strutts. Jedediah Strutt was the founder of the textile industry of Belper, from which Edward, his grandson, took his title as the tirst Baron Belper. The leopard also wears the Curzon collar, from which depends a gold fleur-de-lys from the arms of John of Gaunt, used by the former Belper UDC. He had a residence and hunting-lodge at Belper. The fleur-de-lys is also an emblem of St.Mary, patron saint of Crich. The whole stands on a grassy base divided by blue and white waves representing the River Derwent and other rivers in the district.\n\nThe motto is one used by the former Heanor UDC.\n\nThe green and black divisions of the field represent the green fields of agriculture and the black rich earth. The black points may be taken to represent the stone quarrying industry and the granite outcropping at several points in the District. They can also allude to the original ridge and furrow treatment of the land for natural drainage. The gold saltire is from the arms attributed to the ancient Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Mercia, and refers to the many remains found in the District from that era. The purple saltire represents the two great Roman roads, Fosse Way running from the South West to the North East and Watling Street, running from the South East to the North West, which cross the District at High Cross. Purple is the colour of Imperial Rome. The ermine chief is from the arms of Ralph, Lord Bassett (1368-1390), one of the founder Knights of the Garter, who had a castle at Sapcote. The black maunche or sleeve is from the heraldry of the Hastings family. William, Lord Hastings (1430-1485) built Kirby Muxloe Castle, which is now an ancient monument. The shoed legs refer to the two main industries of the area, hosiery and knitwear, and boot and shoe manufacture.\n\nThe tower represents the tunnel and ventilating tower at Glenfield, built in 1832 by Robert Stephenson for the Leicester-Swannington Railway. The golden eagle, from the head of a centurion's standard upon the purple cross is a further reference to High Cross, where the Roman Station of Venonae formerly stood.\n\nThe three princes coronets were transferred from the arms of the former Borough of Boston, their origin is not definately know, but it is said they represent the Dukes of Brittany, Richmond and Suffolk. The gold field and wheatsheaf represent the arable fenland and the windmill sails, like those in the arms of the Boston RDC, refer to the characteristic Dutch-type drainage of the area.\n\nThe woolpack and ram are an indication that Boston was a staple town for wool. The lion relates to King John and alludes to his journey to Swineshead after losing his treasure in the Wash.\n\nThe two mermaids are also derived from the supporters of the former Borough, and emphasise Boston's importance as a port both in medieval times and the present day. Tradition has it the two mermaids signify the connection between the Borough and two women of note in the reign of Henry VIII, namely Anne Boleyn and Princess Mary, Duchess of Suffolk. Anne Boleyn was related to the Tilney family, who held lands in Boston from the 13th to 15th centuries. The Duke of Suffolk, husband of Princess Mary, was the brother-in-law of Henry VIII and was granted land in Boston by him.\n\nThe arms are derived from the design of the Borough's Common Seal, which bears a pomegranate tree decoratively treated. This emblem was in use by Chesterfield in the reign of Elizabeth I, and may have been derived from the pomegranate of Granada which Henry VIII had adopted as a badge on his marriage with Katherine of Aragon. It has however been claimed that the pomegranate was in use by Chesterfield long before Tudor times. For some unknown reason in the 17th century the pomegranate was discarded in favour of arms - Gules on a gold fess a lozenge azure - but the pomegranate was restored to the Seal in 1893.\n\nThe mural crown is a common symbol of civic government and the ram links the arms with the County.\n\nThe supporters each with a ducal crown commemorate the Revolution plot of 1688 at the Cock and Pynot Inn (now the Revolution House) at Old Whittington and the association of the Earl of Devonshire and other with that plot. The supporters are depicted on a base representing the rocks and moorland around the Town. The motto is both encouraging and refers to the famous \"crooked spire\" of the Parish Church.\n\nARMS: Argent three Bends wavy Azure overall between three Astronomical Signs of Mars Or a Chevron Gules thereon a Fleur de Lys also Or on a Chief dovetailed Gules a Garb of Wheat between two Hanks of Cotton Gold.\n\nCREST: On a Wreath Or Gules and Azure out of a Mural Crown Or masoned Gules charged with four Annulets Sable and between two Torches issuing Azure enflamed proper a Stag rampant Gules and gorged with Lace proper attired and unguled Gold.\n\nBADGE: A Stag's Head caboshed Gules attired Or in the mouth an Astronomical Sign of Mars Or and between the attires a Rose Gules barbed proper thereon another Argent barbed and seeded also proper.\n\nMotto 'PER SAPIENTIAM CONSTANTIAMQUE VICTORIA' - Triumph through wisdom and endeavour.\n\nGranted 1983.\n\nThe Borough of Erewash was formed by the amalgamation of the Borough of Ilkeston, the Long Eaton Urban District and part of the South East Derbyshire Rural District.\n\nThe three wavy blue bands symbolise the three rivers - Trent, Derwent and Erewash. The chevron was common to the arms of Long Eaton UDC and South East Derbyshire RDC and the fleur-de-lys, emblem of St. Mary, recalls St.Mary's Abbey. The signs of Mars, prominent in the arms of the Borough of Ilkeston, represent the iron and steel industry at Stanton Ironworks and the heavy engineering aspects of the Borough. The hanks of yarn symbolise the past and present textile manufacturing trades and the wheatsheaf represents the different parishes in the Borough. The dovetailed edge of the chief symbolises the woodworking and furniture making industries.\n\nThe mural crown is a frequent symbol of civic government and the black annulets or rings, from the South East Derbyshire arms, symbolise steel-making and engineering. The torches, like that in the crest of Long Eaton, represents industry and the stag commmon to the arms of both Nottingham and Derby indicates the general geographical location of Erewash. The stag's lace collar, again common to the arms of Ilkeston and Long Eaton, represents the lace-making industry.\n\nThe black points, similar to those in the arms of the Chapel-en-le-Frith RDC, represent the high peaks in the north of the district and the green base symbolises the green lowlands. The heraldic fountain refers to the lakes, reservoirs and natural mineral springs.\n\nThe chevron continues the peak motif of the arms, but here it is a single peak at the highest point of the achievement of arms, being a specific reference to the name of the Borough. The piece of Blue John is shown as if in a cave and recalls the mineral, which is a special feature of the district and known worldwide.\n\nThe stag or buck is found in the heraldry of the entire district. The stags represent the Cavendish stag, the stag of Downs, Lords of the Manor of Whaley Bridge, the buck seen in the crest of the Borough of Buxton and the stags that once roamed over the whole area.\n\nThe zigzag division of the shield into silver and red, as in the arms of the Hinckley UDC, represents the banner of Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, thought to have been borne by later Earls of Leicester in connection with their Honour of Hinckley. The gold chief comes from the arms of the Dixie family of Market Bosworth. The red roundels are from the arms of the de Grey family, the gold mascles from those of the Ferrers and the ermine cinquefoil from those of Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester. All these families were prominent in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe crest refers to the Battle of Bosworth Field, symbolising the defeat of the white boar (Richard III) by the red dragon (Henry VII). The white boar featured in the crest of the Market Bosworth RDC.\n\nThe black rams, suggested by the crest of the Hinckley UDC, commemorate the woollen industry upon which Hinckley's staple trade of hosiery manufacture was originally founded. The sheep's skin can also be taken as a reference to the important local industry of boot and shoe manufacture. The motto is that previously used by the Market Bosworth RDC.\n\nARMS: Quarterly Or and Azure in dexter chief and in sinister chief a Roman Helmet proper lined Gules and in base the Attires of a Stag conjoined at their burrs proper over all a Cross flory per cross counterchanged of the Field.\n\nCREST: On a Wreath Or and Azure on a Mount Vert an Oak Tree proper between two Lions rampant combatant Or armed and langued Gules the dexter lion supporting by its sinister paw a Pickaxe passing behind the tree in bend the Haft Or the sinister lion supporting by its sinister paw a Pickaxe passing in front of the tree in bend sinister its Haft also Or and the blades of both sable resting upon the ground; Mantled Azure doubled Or.\n\nSUPPORTERS: On the dexter side a Stag per fesse Verte and Or semÃ©e of Oak Leaves counterchanged attired and unguled Gold langued Gules and gorged with a Duke's Coronet Or and on the sinister side a Lion per fesse Verte and Or semÃ©e of Oak Leaves counterchanged armed and langued Gules and gorged with a Duke's Coronet Gold.\n\nBADGE: The Attires of a Stag conjoined at their burrs proper braced at their beams with a Cross flory per cross Azure and Or.\n\nMotto 'SICUT QUERCUS VIRESCIT INDUSTRIA' - Industry flourishes like the oak.\n\nGranted 10th June 1987\n\nThe Mansfield District was formed by the amalgamation of the Borough of Mansfield, the Mansfield Woodhouse Urban District and the Warsop Urban District.\n\nThe quartered field and cross flory are derived from the arms of the Borough of Mansfield and the two Roman helmets are from the device used by the Mansfield Woodhouse UDC. The pair of antlers allude to the deer in Sherwood Forest.\n\nThe crest incorporates a Sherwood Forest oak tree, like the crest used by the Borough of Mansfield, except that the small crosses have been replaced by pickaxes associated with the mining industry. The two lions are derived from the device of the Warsop UDC.\n\nThe dexter supporter is a Sherwood Forest stag with distinctive colouring patterned with oak leaves from the same forest and the sinister supporter is a lion. Both are gorged with a golden crown fashioned in the manner of a Duke's Coronet, alluding to the unofficial term \"Dukeries\" associated with the area.\n\nThe motto repeats that of the Borough of Mansfield.\n\n*ARMS: Quarterly Gules and Vert in the first and fourth quarters a Tower and in the second and third quarters a Garb Or over all a Lion rampant Argent.\n\n*CREST: On a Wreath Argent and Gules a Lion rampant quarterly Argent and Gules holding in the dexter claw a Latin Cross Or and in the sinister claw a Roll of Parchment proper.\n\n*SUPPORTERS: On the dexter side a Bull Sable armed Or and gorged with a Collar dancetty of two points upward Argent and on the sinister side a Horse Argent gorged with a like Collar Gules each resting the interior hoof on a Tower Or, the whole upon a grassy Compartment divided per pale by furrows.\n\nMotto 'UNITY WITH DIVERSITY'.\n\nGranted 17th December 1986.\n\nThe Borough of Melton was formed by the amalgamation of the Melton Mowbray Urban District and the Melton and Belvoir Rural District.\n\nPicture used with permission, do not reproduce.\n\nThe white lion is from the arms of the Mowbray family, Lords of Melton for over 300 years, whose arms (a white lion rampant on a red field) was used without authority by the former Melton Mowbray UDC. The towers on red allude to the district's borough status and the ancient castles of Belvoir, Melton Mowbray and Thorpe Arnold. The wheat sheaves on green refer to agriculture.\n\nThe lion in the crest bears the Mowbray colours of white and red. The gold cross symbolises the district's ecclesiastical heritage - fine parish churches of Melton and Bottesford and the medieval importance of Croxton Abbey, Belvoir Priory and Burton Lazars Leper Hospital. The scroll refers to the indentures associated with Melton Town Estate and to the Borough Charter.\n\nThe black bull is similar to that of the Leicestershire County Council and alludes to Melton Cattle Market. The white horse refers to field sports and farming. Their collars form the letter M, and the compartment conveys the Borough's town and country aspects.\n\nThe green background, two white waves, and the top half of the golden eagle in the upper portion of the shield are from the arms of the North Kesteven RDC from which the present District takes its name. The waves denote the rivers Witham and Brant in the agricultural countryside. The eagle refers to the numerous Roman associations of the area - the Fosse Way, Fosse Dyke and Ermine Street, which for part of its length formed the common boundary of North and East Kesteven. The lower part of the shield is taken from the arms of the East Kesteven RDC - a gold oak tree ultimately taken from the arms of the Kesteven County Council, representing the forests, remnants of which still survive in the south of the old county. The gold chevron with three black stars from the arms of the Sleaford UDC, which are taken from those of the distinguished Carre family. The three stars also indicate the union of the three former authorities in one edifice, suggested by the gable-end shape of the chevron.\n\nThe wreath is in green and white - the liveries of Kesteven County Council. The crane from the East Kesteven crest represents the important R.A.F. College at Cranwell (also commemorated in the Sleaford crest by an eagle). The crane stands within the battlements of a tower alluding to Somerton Castle, a 13th century residence of the Bishops of Lincoln, and rests a claw on a cross combining the red Maltese Cross of the Knights Templars and the white cross of the Knights Hospitallers, who had establishments at Mere in the North, Temple Bruer in the East and Eagle in the North. The crest thus combines influential institutions in the life of the area in both ancient and modern times.\n\nThe motto is that of the previous North Kesteven Rural District Council, a quotation from Cicero. It may be translated 'To follow the right road' and also 'To follow the straight road', the latter giving a reference to the Roman roads of the area.\n\n*ARMS: Or on a Fess arched Vert between three Fleurs-de-Lis Gules a like number of Cornucopias proper all within a Bordure engrailed Azure.\n\n*CREST: On a Wreath Argent and Azure upon a Mural Crown Vert the Top of a Blast-Furnace issuant therefrom Flames supported by a Lincolnshire Red Shorthorn Bull all proper.\n\n*SUPPORTERS: On the dexter an Angel winged Or and habited Argent wreathed about the temples Argent and Azure a rope tied around the waist proper and holding in the exterior hand a Horn Or on the sinister side a figure representing John Wesley proper holding in the holding in the exterior hand a closed book Gold and in the interior hand a Chain of five links proper.\n\nGranted ?\n\nThe Borough of North Lincolnshire formed on 1st April 1996, by a merger of the Boroughs of Glanford and Scunthorpe, and southern Boothferry. These areas where previously in the abolished County of Humberside.\n\nThe three red fleurs-de-lis are in recognition of the area as part of historic Lincolnshire and the three cornucopias on a green background, are an unambiguous reminder of the area's fertility and vitality. North Lincolnshire's wharves and waterways are represented by a blue border - the border which also creates the effect of an island to denote the Isle of Axholme. To represent industry and commerce and to reflect the modern age of the coat of arms, two important economic landmarks are included - the Humber Bridge and Humberside International Airport. The bridge is symbolised by the enarched bar and the airport is represented by the wings of the angel.\n\nThe mural crown, a symbol of civic government, provides the base on which the blast furnace and the Lincolnshire Red Shorthorn Bull are placed, adopted from the Scunthorpe BC and Glanford BC crests, respectively.\n\nThe angel on the right was chosen for its significance in the birth of the new authority, with the restored Angel Hotel in Brigg, the first administrative HQ based in a market town with a long association with local government. The rope around the angel's waist represents the town of Barton and its history of rope-making. To the left, John Wesley, founder of Methodism, with his roots in Epworth, was chosen to demonstrate the importance the new authority attaches to the Isle of Axholme. In Wesley's right hand are five links, each representing one of the five villages - Ashby, Brumby, Crosby, Frodingham and Scunthorpe - which comprise the industrial garden town of Scunthorpe.\n\nARMS: Per chevron Argent and Sable in chief two Ash Trees couped and in base on a Granite Rock issuant proper a Castle of three towers Argent on a Chief Vert between two Garbs a Mitre affrontÃ©e Or charged with two Crosses formy Gules.\n\nCREST: On a Wreath Argent Sable and Vert, within a Circlet of six Lozenges conjoined Sable Flames proper issuant therefrom a demi-Lion Or gorged with a Collar Gules bezanty and holding a Hexagon Argent charged with a Maunch Sable.\n\nMotto 'EX TERRA OPES' - From the earth wealth.\n\nGranted 30th October 1974.\n\nThe North West Leicestershire District was formed by the amalgamation of the Ashby de la Zouch Urban District, the Ashby Wolds Urban District, the Coalville Urban District, the Ashby de la Zouch Rural District, the Castle Donnington Rural District and the Parish of Ibstock from the Market Bosworth Rural District.\n\nPicture used with permission, do not reproduce.\n\nThe green, white and black background suggests agriculture and coal mining. The two sheaves, like those in the arms of Coalville UDC and Ashby de la Zouch RDC, emphasise further the agriculture of the rural areas. The gold mitre with two red crosses is from the arms of Archbishop Laud, an historical reference to Ibstock with which he was associated. The two ash trees refer to the Ashby districts. The white castle was common to the arms of Ashby de la Zouch UDC and Castle Donnington RDC, the rock upon which it stands suggests Charnwood (\"rock forest\").\n\nThe black diamonds, like those in the crest of Coalville UDC, refer to coal mining and the flames to the fire-clay working and brick-making industries. The gold lion, also from the Coalville crest, is that of the Beaumont family and its collar is formed by the gold roundels on red of the Lords Zouch, seen in the arms of Ashby de la Zouch RDC. The black maunch or sleeve, common to the arms of Coalville UDC, Ashby de la Zouch RDC and Castle Donnington RDC, is from the heraldry of the Hastings family. The hexagon suggests the union of six authorities. The motto is that used by the Coalville UDC.\n\nThe lion's leg, like that in the arms of the Oadby UDC, represents the Oadby Brabazon and Powys-Keck families. The two cinquefoils are taken from the arms of the Leicestershire County Council. The narrow gold bars symbolise the former railway industry at Wigston and the two white triangles, like those in the arms of the Wigston UDC, recall the town's former name of 'Wigston Two Steeples'.\n\nThe owl, the bird of wisdom emphasises the motto. The pelt, as in the crest of the Oadby UDC, refers to the footwear industry and the shuttle, from the crest of the Wigston UDC, represents the hosiery industry.\n\nThe lamb suggested by the Oadby crest refers again to woollen and hosiery manufacture, and the tiger from the Wigston crest recalls that town's association with the Royal Leicestershire Regiment.\n\nThe black and green background is indicative of coalmining and agriculture. On the black are two of the three gold bears from the arms of the Basford family, contained in the seal of the Basford RDC and on the green is the Butter Cross which was the emblem on the seal of the Bingham RDC. The blue wave is for the River Trent, over which stands a conventionalised Trent Bridge of three arches, for West Bridgford.\n\nThe gold mural crown is a familiar civic symbol, charged with three visible oak leaves from the tree in the County arms, denoting three Nottinghamshire communities combined in one authority. The rest of the crest refers to the name Rushcliffe, in typical heraldic allusive fashion, depicted by a cliff rising from rushes.\n\nThe Motto is a quotation from Cicero.\n\nThe basic pattern of the shield is that of the South East Derbyshire RDC, a green background with two gold sheaves and a gold chevron with three black rings. These represent agriculture and the iron pipe industry, three rings rather than the original four are shown here for aesthetic reasons and to emphasise the combination of three areas. The gold chevron is masoned with black to suggest the yellow brick industry denoted by the single brick in the Swadlincote UDC crest. The third wheatsheaf represents the former Repton RDC, and this gives the three wheatsheaves of Ranulph de Blunderville, Earl of Chester, whose widow Matilda moved his Priory at Calke to Repton in the late 12th century. The ermine and red chief, like the border of the Swadlincote arms, is from the arms of the Gresley family.\n\nThe black mound with flames issuing denotes coalmining and the fireclay industry. The tower, suggested by that of the Stanhope Earls of Harrington in the South East Derbyshire crest. Here it is white and shaped so as to suggest the cooling towers of Drakelow Power Station, with white clouds issuing symbolising steam.\n\nThe ermine lion is derived from the Gresley' s crest. He wears adistinctive collar showing one row of the ermine and red pieces from the Gresley arms. The wolf is derived from the supporter of the Stanhope Earls of Harrington, he is of gold with black ermine tails, and wears a collar quartered like the Stanhope's shield in ermine and red. Each beast is charged on the shoulder with a Tudor rose from the County arms.\n\nThe motto refers to the coal, fireclay and yellow brick industries and agriculture, all symbolised in the arms.\n\nThe background of blue and white waves is like those in the arms of the Spalding RDC and the East Elloe RDC, they represent the waterways of the area. On these lie two crossed crosiers for the monastic foundations of, Castle Acre Priory, Spalding Priory and Crowland Abbey, and the Elloe Stone, also from the East Elloe arms, which marked the site of the Hundred Court of Elloe, the 'local government unit' of mediaeval times which governed most of the South Holland area. The gold chief and book represents the Spalding Gentlemens' Society, a pioneer in local culture, and two tulip heads, all from the arms of the Spalding UDC, the tulips also featured in the arms of the Holland County Council.\n\nThe wreath and mantling are in the basic blue and white of the shield. The heron from the arms of the Holland County Council, symbolizes the characteristic local fauna, it supports a gold cornucopia from the Spalding RDC arms, and indicates the flora and rich produce of South Holland.\n\nThe motto is that of the Spalding Rural District Council.\n\nThe background of gold and blue chequers, common to the arms of the Borough of Stamford and the Borough of Grantham, are from the arms of the great Norman family of de Warenne, who held both manors. The green of the chevron, is like the background of the device of the West Kesteven RDC and the two sheaves of wheat, representing agriculture, are also from this device and the arms of the South Kesteven RDC. The gold knot, the badge of the Wakes, is taken from the arms of the Bourne UDC, of which they were lords in medieval times. At the head of the shield is one of the Royal Lions of England, which formed part of the arms of Stamford.\n\nARMS: Vert a Fess Ermine of five Spots between in chief the head of a Roman Legionary Standard between two Garbs of Barley or and in base on Water barry wavy of four Argent and Azure a Viking Ship Or the sail set Argent.\n\nCREST On a Wreath Argent and Vert on a Mount an Oak Tree proper fructed Or bound thereto by a circular Steel Chain proper two Anchors in saltire Or.\n\n*SUPPORTERS: On the dexter side a Lincolnshire Red Shorthorn Bull and on the sinister side a Lincoln Longwool Ram both guardant proper each supporting a Crosier Or.\n\nBADGE: A Pentagon per pale barry wavy of six Argent and Azure and Vert over all a Pallet Ermine of five Spots the Pentagon fimbriated Or.\n\nMotto 'STRIVE FOR THE GAIN OF ALL'.\n\nGranted 15th November 1974.\n\nThe West Lindsey District was formed by the amalgamation of the Gainsborough Urban District, the Market Rasen Urban District, the Caistor Rural Dristrict, the Gainsborough Rural District and the Welton Rural District.\n\nThe green background, like that of the Gainsborough UDC and the Caistor RDC, suggests the predominantly rural character of the area. The ermine 'fess' represents, as in the arms of the Gainsborough RDC and the Welton RDC, the Roman Ermine Street. The Roman legionary standard-head in gold is from the arms of the Caistor RDC and emphasizes the Roman associations of that part of Lindsey, this is flanked by two golden sheaves in the same position as in the arms of the Gainsborough UDC and the former Lindsey County Council. The sheaves in the former arms, though not so specified are shown as wheat, while those in the County arms are depicted as barley. The latter is preferred in the new arms as being the more general crop over the whole region, and as having particular reference to the malting industry of Market Rasen. The gold Viking Ship is from the Lindsey arms and the white and blue waves where common to the arms of both the Gainsborough UDC and RDC. Like the dragon ship in the latter's crest, the vessel refers to the Scandinavian incursions into the area by way of the Trent and the settlement under Swein or Sweyn at Gainsborough.\n\nThe grassy mound, represents the Lincolnshire Heights and the Wolds. The oak tree with gold acorns, refers to the woodlands, such as Willingham Forest, and particularly the timber park at Brocklesby Woods, where the Earls of Yarborough have established scientific forestry as one of the district's most notable features. The gold crossed anchors from the crest of the Gainsborough UDC, recall the importance to the economic life of the area of the Trent Navigation. The circular steel chain, securing the anchors to the tree are reminder of the allusive 'links' from the Lindsey crest and of the engineering industry of the Gainsborough area.\n\nThe Lincolnshire Red Shorthorn bull and the Lincoln Longwool ram, are characteristic Lincolnshire beasts, and represent the dairying activities of the western side of the district and the extensive sheep farming of the middle and eastern parts. The gold crosiers suggests the many historical links of the district with the Bishops of Lincoln, the ancient See of Lindsey, and with Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, half-brother of William the Conqueror and holder of the Manor of Market Rasen in Norman times.\n\n*ARMS: Vert on a Bend wavy on the upper edge Or four Roses Gules barbed and seeded proper between a Lion's Face and a Garb Or banded Gules.\n\nCREST *On a Wreath Or and Vert in front of a Mount Vert thereon a Tower triple-towered Argent the portcullis raised Or three Garbs banded and two Roses Gules barbed and seeded proper.\n\n*SUPPORTERS: On the dexter side a Lion guardant Or resting the interior hindpaw on an Escallop Argent and on the sinister side a Bull guardant Sable gorged with a Collar and Line reflexed over the back Or and resting the interior hindleg on a Horseshoe Argent.\n\n*BADGE: A Lion sejant guardant supporting a Garb Or thereon four Roses palewise Gules barbed and seeded proper.\n\nMotto 'AMBITION PRIDE UNITY PROSPERITY'.\n\nGranted 2023.\n\nWest Northamptonshire was formed on 1 April 2021 through the merger of the three non-metropolitan districts of Daventry, Northampton, and South Northamptonshire, it absorbed the functions of these districts, plus those of the abolished Northamptonshire County Council.\n\nThe design has been drawn to reflect and represent West Northamptonshire's proud history and heritage, taking a number of elements from the arms of the former Northampton Borough, Daventry and South Northamptonshire districts and Northamptonshire County Council.\n\nThe roses have traditionally been associated with the County, the four here represent the main towns of Daventry, Brackley, Towcester and Northampton. The lion's face reacalls the lions in the arms of the Borough of Northampton and South Northamptonshire DC and the common seal of Brackley and the gold wheatsheaf recalls the area's rich agricultural heritage. The edges of the diagonal bend across the shield represent Watling Street (straight) and Grand Union Canal (wavy).\n\nThe crest features the white triple-towered castle from the arms of Northampton, on a ring of red roses symbolising county history and gold wheatsheaves representing the area's many rural settlements and agricultural heritage.\n\nThe golden Lion is again taken from the arms of Northampton, with an escallop shell on its foot in reference to the arms of the Spencer family who have owned Althorp for 500 years. The black Bull is from the County Council arms, signifying Edward IV's historic marriage at Grafton, with an iron collar representing agriculture, leatherwork and shoemaking and a horseshoe at its foot in reference to the area's history of metalworking, horseracing at Towcester and horsepower of the motorcars at Silverstone.\n\nThe motto represents the Council's ambition for West Northamptonshire to be a great place to live and work and provide families with a safe place to grow up in and thrive. Encouraging residents to take pride in the area, it's history and great prospects for the future. Inspires residents across West Northants to come together in unity and prosperity, promoting West Northamptonshire as a thriving place with a rich history and ambitions.\n\nThe shield is a modification of the arms of the Wakes previously used by the Council. The three red roundels on gold remain, and the characteristic knot, a badge of the Wakes, which surmounted the previous design is now in the base of the shield. The blue and white waves replace the two red bars from the Wake arms, and represent the historic Carr Dyke and the Bourne Eau.\n\nThe red battlements represent the Castle and the Ermine lion is from the arms of the Cecils, of which family was Elizabeth I's famous Treasurer Lord Burleigh, and the Marquesses of Exeter who have owned the market rights since 1564. The shield held by the lion, shows the arms of the Digby family of the Red Hall.\n\nThe shield contains references to various landowning families connected to Braunstone. The red field derives from the arms of the Peverel, De Grentsmainel, De La Zouch, Herle, De Ferrars, Cantelupe, Slorry, Vaux and Harcourt families. The Shoveller ducks, are from the Herle family who intermarried with the Hastings. The blue fess is from the arms of Burdets the first known family in Braunstone, and also the Grey, Erdington, Camville and Anstey families. The gold roundels are from the arms of de La Zouch who intermarried with the Burdets. The white cross, refers to the families of Peverel, Slorry and Winstanley, the latter family residing in Braunstone from 1651 to 1925. The Sleeve or maunch, refers to the Hastings family who held much land locally from 1367 to 1650. The gold wavy lines, allude to the Drummond Family who held much land to the south east of Braunstone and considerable land in Lubbesthorpe.\n\nThe mound of brown stones refers to the name of the town.\n\nThe black diamonds represent coal mining. The annulet is from the hearldry of the Plumtree family and the red roundels are from the arms of the Grey family of Codnor. They may also be seen as representing cricket balls, in allusion to the fact that several well-know cricketers have come from the district.\n\nThe flames rising from the black diamonds depict the energy derived from coal, and appearing out of the flames is a Phoenix, the mythical bird which the author D. H. Lawrence (1885-1930) adopted as his emblem. This serves as a reminder that Eastwood was Lawrence's birthplace and his early home. Behind the Phoenix, a railway wheel signifies the Town's role in the development of Britain's railways, for it was at the 'Sun Inn' in 1832 that steps were taken to create the Midland Counties Railway, a major constituent of the Midland Railway.\n\nThe background colours are appropriate to a seaside resort - blue for the sea and gold for the sands. The embattled line suggests the great sea wall built after the flood disaster of 1953. The top of the shield shows the emblems of three patron saints - lilies for St. Mary the Virgin, keys for St. Peter and an anchor for St. Clement. They are interlaced to represent the union of the parishes of Mablethorpe, Trusthorpe and Sutton-on-Sea. The three dolphins suggest the pleasures of the three resorts\n\nThe crest represents the early manorial history of the district. The mural crown is a common civic emblem and bears the crosslets from the arms of the de Mablethorpe family. The red lion is that of the de Montalts, and his collar bears the lozenge pattern of the Fitzwilliams.\n\nThe motto is based on a quotation from Tacitus.\n\nThe wavy bars, crest, and supporters refer to Newark's riverside position. The fleur-de-lis and lion are royal emblems. Local opinion takes the bird as the symbol of pride.\n\nSeveral variations of the crest have been quoted. The bird has been described as a morfex, a seagull, and a martlet; and the eel has been called a snake. In the above description I have followed the original blazon - \"Barre wave of Six peces silver and azure a chefe goules therein a peakocke displayed proper colour betwene a flowre de luce and a lyon passant regardant, golde on the helmet on a wreath silver and azure a morfex silver, beaked sable, therein holding a Ele in proper collor mantled gules doubled silver bottoned golde, the said Armes assisted betweene two supporters A Otter and a Beaver both in proper coller The beaver langued gules.\"\n\nThe motto was added in 1912 and is a translation of the valiant words of the Mayor, to Lord Bellasyse, during the siege of Newark by the Parliamentarians in 1646.\n\nThe green background of the shield refers to the Royal Forest of Duffield which gives the ancient background of the district. The stags' heads, another reference to the Forest, are also from the arms of the Cavendish Dukes of Devonshire who came into possession of Ripley after the Dissolution. The chevron is for Heage or \"Highedge\" and also for the hilly character of the situation of Ripley. The black thinner chevron represents the coal seam lying beneath, and the Tudor rose, from the County arms, also refers to Coronation year, in which the grant of arms was sought. The fleur de lys is from a seal attributed to Darley Abbey, and is also the emblem of St. Mary patron of Crich, part of which is in the District. As the whole area was formerly in the protection of Darley Abbey, the arms are surrounded by a white border with six black horseshoes from the arms of its founders, the Ferrers family.\n\nThe black mural crown denotes a mining town, and the unicorn's head, adapted from the Wright crest which is used by the Butterley Company, rises from the flames suggesting the local heavy industries.\n\nThe motto can also be translated as \"Character thrives on hard work\" or \"Ability thrives on industry\" and is a quotation from Cicero."
