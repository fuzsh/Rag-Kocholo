        "text": "Everywhere around the world, peopleâs needs and aspirations are changing, fast. That brings increasing challenge for you, our clients, as you seek to satisfy your stakeholders, tackle societal issues and deliver your business strategy.\n\nOur global network of experts looks at problems from fresh angles and finds opportunities in complexity. They bring together diverse skills, experience and insight, to turn obstacles into elegant, sustainable solutions. Our aim: to add value at every stage, for you and the lives you touch every day.\n\nWeâre very aware of the lasting and potentially far-reaching impacts of the work we do. So we set out to identify, highlight and address ripple effects, eliminating negative ones and pursuing the positive. As a matter of principle, nobody should be disadvantaged. And we know from experience that inclusive projects deliver the best results for everyone, our clients too. That is why social outcomes â accessibility, inclusion, empowerment, resilience and wellbeing â are at the heart of our purpose.\n\nTo maximise benefit for all and protect against harm we keep alert to connections, dependencies and influences between the projects weâre helping deliver and the world around them â infrastructure, services, the natural environment, businesses and people.\n\nThis is where digital innovation comes to the fore. In harness with our colleaguesâ deep subject knowledge and technical excellence, our digital skillset helps us, our clients and partners to address old challenges better and solve new ones â seeing problems and possibilities more clearly, and being more agile, efficient and effective.\n\nOur clients say weâre at our best when we collaborate in trust-based relationships to define and solve challenges, establish the steps for meeting their strategic ambitions, and provide the skills to help fund, plan, design, deliver and sustain their goals.\n\nImprovement is front and centre of what we offer as we work with you towards a more inclusive and resilient society that allows people to live well in a healthy environment, enabled by economic development, vibrant businesses and fair return on investment.\n\nWe call it opening opportunities with connected thinking.\n\nAdvice that adds advantage\n\nProjects to improve health, education and life chances, and to recover from natural disasters such as earthquakes and flooding are all in our portfolio, and always will be. But the potential for contributing to better social outcomes extends far wider.\n\nWith you, weâre focused on combating the causes and effects of climate change, managing the coronavirus pandemic, seizing opportunities in digital transformation, and creating and caring for the infrastructure that society depends on.\n\nOur people have taken lead roles in the worldâs highest profile infrastructure and development projects. Working with us you have access to the vast knowledge of internationally recognised engineers, project and programme managers, environmentalists, planners, economists, data scientists, app developers, modellers, social scientists, project finance advisors and more. On one hand you get the advantages of size and stability that come from a US$2bn organisation â there are 16,000 of us, delivering projects in Africa, Asia Pacific and Australasia, Europe, the Middle East, North and South America, and South Asia. On the other youâll get the kind of openness, friendliness and personal commitment you might expect from a much smaller business.\n\nOur universe of creative thinkers is centred around you. Weâre joined-up across sectors and geographies, meaning that whatever your needs and wherever you are in the world, we will align the right combination of subject and digital expertise to creatively and efficiently meet your ambitions.\n\nDoing what is right\n\nWeâre the largest wholly employee-owned firm of our kind. There are no external shareholder priorities to influence our decision making, meaning we can choose the work we take on and focus on the issues that are important to you â and us.\n\nBeing independent in thought and action, weâll advise what is genuinely right for your business. Youâll get the very best from us because we want to do a great job â the right job.\n\nWe insist on the highest standards of integrity in all we do. We were the first consultancy firm to be certified to BS 10500, now ISO 37001, the international anti-bribery management standard. This assurance of fairness, openness and honesty applies to all our employees, subconsultants and suppliers everywhere we work. The result is that we are trusted and respected for our integrity and the high quality of everything we do.\n\nExcellence at your service\n\nWe employ the people everyone else wants to know.\n\nOur people stay with us because they have a stake in the company â we have a retention rate of over 90% for senior staff. So if you like working with someone itâs likely they will be with us for your next job, and the one after that.\n\nStronger retention gives depth of experience, skills and knowledge. Our ownership model also empowers us to invest in all the core ingredients of excellence: excellent people, supported by industry-leading systems and technology. Professional networks, regular âexcellence weeksâ and webinars drive learning, fresh ideas and digital innovation throughout the company.\n\nDigitalisation has dissolved physical boundaries, enabling us to create networks and virtual teams worldwide that are as close-knit and effective as the best physically co-located ones. These enable our global sector and practice leaders to provide expertise, share knowledge, spread best practice, collaborate, problem solve and communicate â with the aim of bringing you and all project stakeholders greater benefits, sooner.\n\nWhen you work with us anywhere in the world you have instant access to our entire network of brilliant people."
