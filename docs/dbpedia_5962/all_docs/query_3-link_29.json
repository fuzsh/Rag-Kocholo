        "text": "The University of Alberta takes pride in its traditions and hallmarks. The Office of the Chancellor and Senate strives to honour and maintain these traditions.\n\nUniversity of Alberta Chairs\n\nThe Chancellor's Chair (far left) was presented to the University of Alberta as a gift from the 1922 graduating class. It is made of solid oak with a padded leather back and seat. Above the padded leather back is carved the University motto Quaecumque Vera (see below) together with the class year, 1922, and the University emblem.\n\nIn 1987, the family and friends of Dr. Charles Malcolm Macleod, Chair of the Board of Governors from 1950-1966, presented a memorial gift to the University of an oak stand for the University of Alberta Mace (see below) and two additional chairs for use by the President (far right) and the Chair of the Board of Governors (right) at Convocation.\n\nIn 2006, a fourth chair (left) was donated in memory and honour of Lois Elsa Hole, beloved Chancellor (1998 - 2000) and Lieutenant Governor (2000 - 2005), by Earl Evaniew, Sandra Kereliuk and their daughter Jennifer. This chair becomes part of the seating arrangements on stage, when the Lieutenant Governor or other high profile dignitaries attend the convocation ceremonies.\n\nConvocation Honouring by an Elder Ceremony\n\nIn the Spring of 1996, Chancellor Lou Hyndman agreed to the First Peoples' House (formerly Aboriginal Students Services Centre) request to have an Elder on stage during convocation to recognize and honour each First Nation, Métis, and Inuit graduate, along with the opportunity to wear traditional regalia when they cross the stage.\n\nWe congratulate and want to acknowledge the dedication and accomplishments of our First Nation, Métis, and Inuit students on their academic accomplishments by offering each Indigenous graduating student to be part of an Honouring Ceremony. In preparation for the Honoring Ceremony for our First Nations, Métis, and Inuit graduates, we would like for each of our graduates to come into the First Peoples' House (2-400 SUB) or contact us at fph@ualberta.ca to complete the required Convocation Honoring by an Elder Ceremony Form.\n\nUniversity of Alberta Cheer Song\n\nWith words written by undergraduates Chet Lambertson and Bob (R.K.) Michaels, the University of Alberta Cheer Song was created in 1935 thanks to a contest put on by the Students' Union. The music was later arranged in the 1950s by Professor Richard Eaton.\n\nUniversity of Alberta Coat of Arms\n\nIn June 1994, His Excellency the Right Honourable Ramon John Hnatyshyn, Governor General of Canada, presented the University of Alberta with its Coat of Arms. The full Coat of Arms is displayed at ceremonial occasions such as Convocation, and is used by the Chancellor, the titular head of the University.\n\nThe symbolism of the University's Armorial Bearings (Coat of Arms) is:\n\nShield (centre) A representation of the topography of Alberta rendered in the colours of the University. At the base is a prairie wheat field symbolizing Alberta's agricultural industry. The wavy gold line above suggests the hills and rivers of Alberta and, in particular, the setting of the University campus. The top of the shield is in gold and separated from the rest of the shield by a line suggesting the Rocky Mountains. The book of learning dominates the design.\n\nCrest (top) A Grand-Duc d'Amerique, or Great Horned Owl, the provincial bird and an accepted symbol of knowledge.\n\nSupporters (left and right, respectively) The Pronghorn, taken from the Provincial Coat of Arms, and the golden bear, mascot of the University. Both wear collars of the University colours, as does the owl.\n\nCompartment (base)A grassy mound with wild roses, the floral emblem of Alberta.\n\nMotto (below base) 'Quaecumque vera' - whatsoever things are true (Phil 4:8).\n\nGreen and Gold - University of Alberta Colours\n\nUniversity of Alberta Flag\n\nUniversity of Alberta Grace\n\nHoc convivio firmati,\n\npraecepto nostrae universitatis parentes,\n\nconstantius sequamur quaecumque vera.\n\nTranslation:\n\nRefreshed by this meal and fellowship,\n\nobeying the precept of this our University,\n\nlet us pursue more steadfastly whatsoever things are true.\n\n----------------------\n\nLatin Pronunciation Guide: The general rule in Latin is to pronounce every letter. 'C' is always hard like 'k', never like 's'. 'V' can be pronounced either as a 'w' (Classical pronunciation) or as the English 'v' (Medieval and Church pronunciation).\n\n----------------------\n\nThe University Grace was originally composed by Dr. William Hardy Alexander and every student and staff member in the early days of the University could recite the grace. It was said prior to meals in dining halls and was meant to convey a sense of civility during meal times.\n\nThe Grace has undergone a number of revisions over the University's history to help it embrace the secular nature of the U of A. The Grace is used before formal University meals and its current text was rewritten by former President Myer Horowitz, with the help of former Dean of Education, Herbert Coutts.\n\nUniversity Mace\n\nThe University of Alberta Mace was designed and crafted specifically for the University as a gift from Dr. Francis Phillip Galbraith, Chancellor of the University of Alberta from 1964-1970. It was presented by his son, Michael Galbraith, on behalf of his father on 26 May 1970.\n\nAmong its elements are:\n\nthe Star of Saint Thomas Aquinas, the Patron Saint of Scholars;\n\nthe Wild Rose of Alberta;\n\nthe Maple Leaf;\n\nand the separate charges which make up the University's Coat of Arms.\n\nThe University motto encircles the staff. The Mace is made of sterling silver which was rhodium plated after the insertion of the various enamelled shields which make up its elements. A special electro-plate process was used to apply 24 carat gold to other parts of the Mace.\n\nThe ceremonial stand for the Mace was donated in 1987 as a memorial gift by family and friends of Dr. Charles Malcolm Macleod, Chair of the Board of Governors 1950-66, together with two ceremonial chairs for use by the President and the Chair of the Board of Governors at Convocation.\n\nIt was intended that the Mace should be modern in appearance but with medieval origins. The preponderance of visual weight at the top of the staff and the rather complex section through the metalwork at this point are reminiscent of the use of the mace as a weapon, defensive or aggressive.\n\nThe Mace is carried before the Chancellor, or Vice-Chancellor, in procession and rests on its stand in full view of the assembly during Convocation. Centuries ago the Mace was a symbol of authority over life and death. Today it represents power - but the power of knowledge and the importance of the University in the community.\n\nQuaecumque vera - The University's Motto\n\nThe University Motto, Quaecumque vera, is taken from the Latin Vulgate version of the Bible, the Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians, Chapter 4, Verse 8:\n\nDe cetero, fratres, quaecumque sunt vera,\n\nquaecumque pudica, quaecumque justa,\n\nquaecumque sancta, quaecumque amabilia,\n\nquaecumque bonae famae,\n\nsi qua virtus, si qua laus disciplinae, haec cogitate.\n\nThe same passage from the King James version is:\n\nFinally, brethren, whatsoever things are true,\n\nwhatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just,\n\nwhatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely,\n\nwhatsoever things are of good report;\n\nif there be any virtue, and there be any praise, think on these things.\n\nSenate Chamber\n\nBook the Senate Chamber\n\nLocated in 326 Arts and Convocation Hall, the Senate Chamber is the original oval-shaped room used for Senate meetings. The floor is hardwood and the original wainscotting is oak. The moulded ceiling needed little or no repair when the room was upgraded as part of the remodelling of the Arts Building in 1988.\n\nAlthough the present-day Senate is too large to meet in the Chamber for its plenary sessions, members decided to raise money at the time of the remodelling, to ensure that the room would be appropriately furnished. An oval table, 20 leather chairs, a podium, a Wilton carpet and two modern sculptures were purchased, and the \"Tory Desk\" refurbished and placed in the room (and was later removed).\n\nCurrently, it is used for seminars and small meetings as part of academic programs, and Senate also uses it for a committee meetings.\n\nWhat We Do\n\nSenate Strategic Plan\n\nChancellor's Forum\n\nCommittees\n\nTask Forces\n\nHonorary Degrees\n\nBook the Senate Chamber\n\nEmil Skarin Fund\n\nRepresentatives, Liaisons & Lay Observers\n\nContact Us\n\nOffice of the Chancellor & Senate\n\n322 Arts & Convocation Hall\n\nUniversity of Alberta\n\nEdmonton, AB T6G 2E6\n\nsenate@ualberta.ca\n\n780.492.2268"
