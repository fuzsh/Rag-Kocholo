        "text": "<strong>The</strong> <strong>Seaxe</strong> Newsletter of the <strong>Middlesex</strong> <strong>Heraldry</strong> <strong>Society</strong>. Joint Editors - Don & Marjorie Kirby, 2 Jamnagar Close, Staines, <strong>Middlesex</strong> TW18 2JT (Ph 01784 456049 - e-mail = seaxe@tinyworld.co.uk) No.42 (Founded 1976) September 2002 Derby Celebrates Four Jubilees by Ray Smith <strong>The</strong> arms of Derby were granted on 12 May 1939. Arms:- Argent, on a mount vert within park palings, a stag lodged between two oak-trees, all proper. (Locally known as 'the buck in the Park\" it has been a badge of the corporation from time immemorial.) Crest:- on a wreath argent and vert a ram passant proper with a gold collar, between two sprigs of broom proper (<strong>The</strong> ram comes from an early 19th century anonymous poem of a beast of prodigious proportions. It is the nickname of Derby County Football Club and the Sherwood Foresters, now the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment, have a ram as their mascot. <strong>The</strong> broom (planta genista) represents the Plantagenet King Henry II. from whom Derby received one of its earliest charters.) Supporters:- two stags, each charged on the shoulder with a sprig of broom proper. Motto:- Industria, virtus et fortitudo (Industry, valour and fortitude). This year Derby is celebrating Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee. <strong>The</strong> Derbyshire Life and Countryside for June has a list of over a hundred Jubilee Events. On August 1st the Queen visits Pride Park where she can expect a rapturous welcome. Pride Park which replaced the better known Baseball Ground is the home of Derby County Football Club (sadly now relegated from the Premier Division). At the Queen's Silver Jubilee, 25 years ago, Derby 1 was raised to the dignity of a City, so is now celebrating 25 years as the Jubilee City - the coat of arms remains the same. (Derby has, however, missed out on being given a Lord Mayor this year). Derby is also celebrating the 75th Anniversary of All Saints' Church having been consecrated as Derby Cathedral. In addition Derby is celebrating the 25th Anniversary of the Dean of Derby's ordination as a priest (as a new cathedral, Derby previously had Provosts). (Ray Smith is a retired GP who considers that, as it so long since he practised, he would rather not use the \"handle\" to which he is entitled. He is a member of the East Midlands <strong>Heraldry</strong> <strong>Society</strong> and a Country member of our own <strong>Society</strong>. Ray has been a great source of encouragement to your editors and has now burst into print for a second time.) + + + + + Did You Know On 6 th August 1762 the first formally acknowledged \"sandwich\" composed of slices of beef and cheese and served with sliced and toasted bread on top and bottom, was apparently devised by - or for - John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, (1718-92) at that time 1st Lord of the Admiralty. It seems that the earl was a compulsive gambler who could spend up to 24hours at the gaming tables without interruption and therefore needed a convenient form of sustenance that left one hand free for dice and cards! <strong>The</strong> arms are:- Quarterly 1st and 4th Argent three fusils conjoined in fesse Gules within a bordure Sable (Montagu) 2nd and 3rd Or an eagle displayed Vert beaked and membered Gules (Monthermer)."
