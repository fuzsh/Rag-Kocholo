        "text": "(1887–1975). French poet Saint-John Perse received the Nobel prize for literature in 1960 “for the soaring flight and evocative imagery of his poetry.” He also had a long, distinguished diplomatic career, in which he was known by his given name, Aléxis Saint-Léger Léger.\n\nMarie-René-Auguste-Aléxis Saint-Léger Léger was born on May 31, 1887, on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe. He studied in France at the universities of Bordeaux and Paris. In 1914 he entered the French diplomatic service, serving first in China, then as secretary to the statesman Aristide Briand, and in 1933 achieving the rank of ambassador with the French Foreign Ministry. In 1940, when the pro-Nazi Vichy government dismissed him from office and deprived him of French citizenship, he went to the United States. There he worked as consultant on French literature in the Library of Congress. He returned to France in 1957."
