        "text": "Saint-John Perse\n\nAKA Marie René Auguste Alexis Léger\n\nBorn: 31-May-1887\n\nBirthplace: Saint-Léger-les-Feuilles, Guadeloupe, France\n\nDied: 20-Sep-1975\n\nLocation of death: Giens, France\n\nCause of death: unspecified\n\nRemains: Buried, Seaside Cemetery, Giens, France\n\nGender: Male\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Poet\n\nNationality: France\n\nExecutive summary: Exile\n\nAlexis Léger's first published work was a French translation of Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, and his early Anabasis was translated into English by T. S. Eliot. For many years he wrote as an after-hours diversion while pursuing his career as a diplomat, and his poetry, revered for its cosmic vision and lofty rhetoric, often appeared under the pen name Saint-John Perse.\n\nIn 1940, after his refusal to collaborate with the German-controlled French government, he was stripped of his French citizenship, and manuscripts reflecting more than a decade of his work were seized and destroyed by the secret police. He fled first to England, then the United States, where he worked for Archibald Macleish at the Library of Congress, and published some of his best work. He returned to France in 1957, and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1960. Born in the French territory of Guadeloupe, he was the first Caribbean-born writer to win this honor.\n\nFather: Amédée Léger (attorney)\n\nMother: Francoise Renee Dormoy\n\nWife: Diane St Léger Léger\n\nWife: Dorothy Milburn Russell (m. 1940)\n\nUniversity: BA (1904)\n\nLaw School: JD, University of Bordeaux (1910)\n\nScholar: Literary advisor, Library of Congress (1941-45)\n\nFrench Legion of Honor (revoked 1940, and later restored)\n\nNobel Prize for Literature 1960\n\nCitizenship Revoked 1940 (French, later restored)\n\nOfficial Website:\n\nhttp://www.fondationsaintjohnperse.fr/\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nÉloges (Eulogies, and Other Poems) (1910)\n\nAnabase (Anabasis) (1924, epic poem)\n\nExil (Exile) (1942)\n\nPoème l'Etrangère (Poem to a Foreign Lady) (1943)\n\nPluies (Rains) (1943)\n\nNeiges (Snows) (1944)\n\nVents (Winds) (1946)\n\nAmers (Seamarks) (1957)\n\nChronique (Chronicle) (1960)\n\nThe Poet and the Diplomat: Peace and Conflict Resolution (2001, letters to and from Dag Hammarskjold, published posthumously)\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
