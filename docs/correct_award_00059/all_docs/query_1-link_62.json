        "text": "André Breton once called Saint-John Perse, “The man of my epoch most tirelessly in search of all men.”\n\nÉdouard Glissant gave him the title, “The last herald of a systematic universe.”\n\nBreton, Glissant, Perse: All three are poets of the Francophone world. Breton, most associated with French surrealism, was born in Normandy in 1896. Glissant, the great theorist of creolization and of Caribbean poetics, was born on the island of Martinique in 1928. Perse, a diplomat by profession who was also awarded the Nobel Prize for his poetry in 1960, was born on the island of Guadeloupe in 1887. I have placed the two quotes above one after another because, without additional context, Breton and Glissant seem to be saying the same thing, or at least something similar, about Saint-John Perse: that his poetry is expansive, that he is the seeker of a universal Humanity. But there are opposite values attached to what Breton and Glissant see in Perse. Breton means to praise his work. Glissant is highlighting a limitation.\n\nWhat accounts for these opposite values that Glissant and Breton bring to their readings of Perse? Is it generational difference? Is it cultural difference? Breton is speaking of a contemporary whereas Glissant is speaking of an antecedent. Breton is rooted in metropolitan France. Glissant is an Antillean poet. Perse, for what it’s worth, was the first Caribbean-born writer to be awarded the Nobel, although his literary persona is that of the eternal exile and the wanderer, which is what is really at the heart of what Glissant has to say about him. Glissant does not, he can not in the same way that Breton does, see any heroism in Perse’s insistence on being unencumbered by particularity, traveling the world in search of Truth. He sees this tendency in Perse but urges us not to accept it blindly. Glissant himself hesitates in the face of Perse’s wanderings. Something is not right. And what has really troubled Glissant is that Perse’s background overlaps in too many places with his own, and not because of any “universality” on the part of his poetry. No, Glissant recognizes, maybe with some unease, things about Perse that only one Creole can know about another.\n\nAndré Breton’s praise of Perse, in the meantime, has become anachronistic. The “search for all men” is mostly abandoned now; we can be thankful for that. Contemporary readers will likely be in sympathy with Glissant when he writes, in his 1976 article on Saint-John Perse, that “the world can no longer be shaped into a system. Too many Others and elsewheres disturb the fragile surface.” Strip away all of the false universality from Perse and the interesting thing that is left is the part of himself he tries so urgently to hide. We are left to puzzle over his Caribbean background, the roots that were no roots at all because they sent him soaring into the endless voyages known as the pure state of exile.\n\n“Perse both turns his back on us, and is one of us,” writes Glissant, and he is not the only French West Indian poet for whom Saint-John Perse is a lingering presence, a source of uncertainty, sometimes a target, and occasionally a brother. Consider Aimé Césaire’s poem, “Voodoo Ceremony for Saint-John Perse”, written shortly after Perse’s death. Césaire’s ambivalence in this poem is a magnificent, troubled, celebratory, angry ambivalence and his ability to express this complex feeling is what separates Césaire from lesser poets. Here are the final verses:\n\n“(and did he see it did the stranger see it\n\nRedder still than the blood of Tammuz\n\nThan our Decebalian faces\n\nDid he see it did the stranger see it?)\n\nFlegreian\n\nBirds profound\n\nTurledoves of darkness and resentment\n\nand may the arch catch fire\n\nAnd from one ocean to another\n\nMay the sumptuous magmas in volcanoes answer each other\n\nTo honor, with all muzzles all portholes smoking,\n\nUnder sail towards the high seas,\n\nThe ultimate Conquistador on his last voyage”\n\nThere is something tortured here, as there often is in Cesaire’s poetry. The source of the anguish in this case is this “stranger” and whether he “saw it” (saw what? Something that to Césaire is of unspeakable importance. Is it “Did he see me?”). What Césaire is essentially asking is whether the stranger is a stranger at all. He seems unsure. His reaction is to claim Perse (to celebrate him) while simultaneously keeping his distance.\n\nGlissant, without making any reference to Césaire’s poem, notices the same two reactions in himself, and notices also that these contradictory feelings leave an ambiguous aftertaste:\n\n“these two reactions are liable to leave something unexplained in Perse: the reaction that makes us want to drag him back forcefully to his Caribbean roots (him, the inveterate wanderer); the other one that makes us eager to whiten him as a French Creole, with that twisted legacy from which he secretly suffered.”\n\nThis is, I think, exactly to the point. It relieves Perse of his universality while explaining his thirst for it. Perse, it seems is a product of history after all – and a particular Antillean one at that. Césaire and Glissant, linked to him by that history, are uncertain of him, uncertain of his Caribbean whiteness, “a fragile Caribbean-ness” Glissant calls it in Perse’s case. On the other side of the uncertainty is insight, the sort of insight about Perse that Glissant summons easily and naturally, and which a Frenchman like Breton would probably not necessarily have access to. Perse, Glissant writes, is:\n\n“Reliving the dilemma of the White Creole, caught between a metropolitan history that does not include him (and that he, in reaction, claims meticulously and energetically as his legitimate ancestry) and the natural world of the Caribbean which engenders new points of growth that he must perhaps deny.”\n\nThere it is: The roots of Perse’s poetic sensibilty, if not of his cultural belonging. The alienation that is sometimes the product of a Caribbean whiteness (I do not think Glissant means Caucasians only. He is not speaking of sinister things like racial essences). The alienation that sometimes leads to the sensibility of the wanderer. Constant travel can soothe the pain of homelessness. This seems to be Perse’s response.\n\nAnd yet Glissant is still cautious. Perse’s wandering is his freedom and also his privilege. “He is not involved in this history, as he was free to walk away from it,” writes Glissant. Whether we agree or not, it is true that Perse’s wanderings did not lead him back to the source, but ever onwards and outwards.\n\nIncreasingly these days Perse is mentioned as an influential Caribbean poet. One only has to read his poem “To Celebrate a Childhood” with its images of “cows smelling of cane syrup”, and “mute faces the color of papayas and boredom”, to get a sense of the images that he carried with him his whole life. Perhaps they are the images that also sustained him. What’s remarkable about this poem is that its tone is both nostalgic and ecstatic, not a usual combination. A celebration of loss? His remembrance is not a melancholic remembrance. It is the memory of an island he left behind, a landscape within him that no amount of wandering into the universal heart of mankind could erase or blur.\n\nA few samples from Saint-John Perse’s “To Celebrate a Childhood”:\n\n“Palms…!\n\nIn those days they bathed you in water-of-green-leaves; and the water\n\nWas of green sun too; and your mother’s maids, tall glistening girls,\n\nMoved their warm legs near you who trembled…\n\n(I speak of a high condition, in those days, among the dresses, in\n\nThe dominion of revolving lights.)”\n\n“…O! I have cause for Praise!\n\nMy forehead under yellow hands,\n\nMy forehead, do you remember the night sweats?\n\nMidnight unreal with fever and the taste of cisterns?\n\nAnd the flowers of blue dawn dancing on the bays of morning\n\nAnd the hour of noon more sonorous than a mosquito, and arrows\n\nShot out by the sea of colors…”\n\nAt the 2011 Hay Literary Festival in Britain, Sir Vidia Naipaul and Paul Theroux shook hands. The gesture made news. Bad blood had been assumed ever since Theroux’s memoir, Sir Vidia’s Shadow, had painted Naipaul as a cruel and self-involved crank. “Vidia was the neediest person I had ever known,” wrote Theroux in 1998, sounding like a wronged spouse. “He fretted incessantly, couldn’t cook, never cleaned, wouldn’t drive, demanded help, had to be the center of attention.” Naipaul has been condescending towards Theroux’s travel writing in return. “Travel has become a plebeian, everyday matter, it has become lower-class adventure, and there are books now written for lower class travelers. I think Theroux belongs to that category: he wrote tourist books for the lower classes.”\n\nIt’s easy to laugh off Naipaul for being a snob, but his insult is still more stinging than Theroux’s entire memoir. It takes a lot of effort to write 364 pages about someone else’s character flaws. Naipaul found Theroux worthy of only a few sentences and the brutal kiss-off, “Take it on the chin, and move on.” Even in Theroux’s “tell-all” memoir about Naipaul’s monstrous behavior, he seems reluctant to savage his former hero, prefacing his criticisms with the assurance that he still thinks Naipaul is brilliant.\n\nAside from Sir Vidia’s peculiar 19th-century elitism, it’s hard to disagree completely with his harsh take on Theroux’s writing. If both men are known for their explorations of empire’s aftermath, Theroux is the tourist – a label that has a kind of nastiness to it all on its own. It isn’t at all surprising that a Caribbean writer would look down on Theroux’s Massachusetts upbringing, his Peace Corps earnestness, his adventuring across Africa, his Hawaiian retirement.\n\nIt is not Theroux’s fault that his quarrels with the world are less interesting than Naipaul’s. Both men do embody something essential about the immediate aftermath of empire, even if Theroux does not have access to Naipaul’s pain. Both writers can be exasperating. Naipaul’s torment – the torment of the migrant and the colonial – can completely shut him off from questioning his own judgments. Theroux is rarely in the position to have to try. At various times in Sir Vidia’s Shadow, Theroux notes that Naipaul often fell into sour moods, complaining of “having no country” and “being placeless.” “Out of politeness, I did not mention that he was the one with the British passport, while I carried an Alien registration card,” Theroux writes, missing the point. In another dubious moment, Theroux, having spent a few years teaching in Uganda, attributes his alienation on a visit to Oxford to his African-ness. “Places like this reminded me that I was in many respects an African. I needed a simpler and less demanding world.” This is a strange statement for a lecturer at the University of Makrere in Kampala to make.\n\nWhat’s at issue here is not only two writers’ very different assumptions about travel and identity, but their completely opposed views on the activity of writing. Theroux and Naipaul conceive of their vocations in inverse ways. Naipaul, running from what he perceives as a provincial place in the world, sees himself, whether rightly or not, as a solitary genius struggling under the weight of history. As absurd as this makes some of his pronouncements, it is what gives his writing its intensity. Theroux, on the other hand, has a much more democratic view of what it means to be a writer. There is something both admirable and irritating about the fact that Theroux’s huge success has come to him despite the fact that he is a good, not a great, writer. By most accounts, his gifts are his determination to live a writer’s life, his confidence and ease around people, and his discipline. In this formula, the key ingredient to achieving success as a writer is not having a unique vision, as Naipaul might say, but wanting it bad enough.\n\nIt’s puzzling that Naipaul and Theroux were able to sustain a thirty year friendship on the basis of writing and travel, two things they agreed so little about. To what extent was Naipaul stringing Theroux along when he praised his books? Was it a cruel game at the expense of Theroux’s naivety? And how appeasing must Theroux have been to not agitate the famously prickly Naipaul for so many years? What do these former friends truly think of each others’ work? A handshake says so little.\n\nIt feels strange, here, surrounded by bay trees, to be thinking about the presidential election. On the other side of my window’s rusting frame, raindrops are running down the giant philodendron leaves. Tree frogs are chanting. Moths brush the ceiling beams; Suriname hardwood. The books on my desk are beginning to warp, their covers curling in the humidity. This mountain, marked by abandoned charcoal pits, can seem remote even now with its paved road, its incongruous joggers and dog-walking neighbors; hallucinations.\n\nWires and waves carry the news of national politics from the U.S. mainland to this mountain on which I was raised. Do islands still exist in an age of connectivity, or do we exist everywhere at once beyond any possibility of isolation? The current presidential campaign, Barack Obama vs. Mitt Romney, is accessible here, as it is across the nation, on monitors and television sets – and many of us follow it intently, although here we cannot vote. Here in the U.S. Virgin Islands we remain unincorporated, in limbo, and full of contradictory desires.\n\nDespite the pride of t-shirts emblazoned with the face of the President, despite the absurdity of campaign bumper stickers, we remain outsiders to presidential politics. But who is more preoccupied with what happens “on the inside” than the outsider? We look on from a distance — sometimes filled with bitterness, sometimes filled with relief. We spend a lot of hours with our own discomfort.\n\nQuestions of identity can buzz unpleasantly inside the minds of those without clear ethnic or national attachments. But these questions are social not natural; they are a response to a world that demands categorization with one hand and refuses it with the other. It is not always easy to pick and choose our commitments; humanity is filled to the brim with complexities and permutations. Why is this fact so seldom reflected, or even acknowledged, in our institutions and leaders? But Barack Obama, a man who has written books about the complexities of cultural identity, appeared to many as a harbinger of change.\n\nThe President’s most vocal opponents speak in small, shrill voices about birth certificates and other symbols of “the intolerant root.” They say he is unknowable — an essentially mysterious person. They say he shifts in and out of affected political stances. This has been most recently argued by Dinesh D’souza’s propagandist documentary, 2016: Obama’s America, which has been breaking box office records in the States. The off-key argument that D’Souza continues to make to whoever will listen — many people it seems — is that Obama is to be feared, above all because he is “anti-colonial.” And D’souza bizarrely tells us that he himself is an authority on anti-colonialism, because he “grew up in India in the decades after that country gained its independence from Britain.” Given the amount of people who share those credentials, and the diversity of opinion bred by that experience, I find the intensity and narrowness of D’Souza’s argument puzzling.\n\nNeurosis over anti-colonialism, too, seems mysterious in the United States, a nation born of anti-colonial revolution. Is this response simply the narcissism of some Caucasians who hear the term “anti-colonial” and interpret it as “anti-white?” Is it as simple as this conflation of anti-colonialism, a broad discourse on power, with the related but superficial sideshow of race?\n\nIt is at the most conservative end of the American political spectrum that we mostly find those arguing that Obama is a shadowy outsider. But this position can be messy and unconstrained. It can spill over the indistinct borders that separate ideologies.\n\nIn a recent issue of The New Republic, a center-left American political magazine (the center-left American political magazine), Nicholas Lehmann reviews the most recent biography of the President, a book blandly entitled Barack Obama: The Story. Lehmann’s analysis, though more favorable to Obama than D’souza’s obsessive editorials, sometimes falls into the flawed, common thinking in which the President’s complex background is seen as a natural source of anxiety. We are supposed to believe that Obama himself is confused by his own upbringing, which was “all over the cultural, geographic, and political map.” I believe this is misguided; There are a lot of people in the world today with fragmented, international identities: migrants, refugees, colonials and ex-colonials, global creoles of various kinds – people who can’t go home, people who have never been home. The mistake is to believe that their complexity necessarily leads to confusion. There is nothing inevitable about the ways in which people whose experience lies outside of so-called “master-narrratives” (half-Kenyan Hawaiians raised in Indonesia for instance) are made to feel they should be confused by those who are more rooted in their own ethnic/national traditions. This is nothing but a condemnable turn-of-the-century form of cruelty.\n\nBut Lehmann is also sensitive to some things about Obama that aren’t often mentioned in the American media. Obama’s response to the overdetermined racial thinking that is such an ingrained part of American culture – his close identification with the main line of African-American historical narrative that stretches from the Southern plantation to the Civil Rights Movement, a history which he is only ambiguously attached to – may deserve more attention. Some Americans experience no cognitive dissonance on this issue. For instance, Jelani Cobb’s recent piece in the New Yorker tries very hard to place Obama within this narrative, and Cobb’s writing is so good that he almost convinced me, but I could not finally ignore the contradictions. If that is other peoples’ truth, so be it, but mine lies elsewhere. Lehmann, for one, is asking useful questions:\n\n“One can’t gainsay the genuineness of the feeling of homecoming Obama got from finding his way into the heart of the African American experience, most notably through his marriage, from a point completely outside it. But it is also a sign of the weirdness of America’s racial customs—most whites assume that anybody who has dark skin also has a set of identical, deeply ingrained experiences and attitudes that just weren’t part of Obama’s life growing up—that Obama has been able to sell this version of himself so successfully.”\n\nThat’s a thoughtful way to put it. Identity is always in formation, and is largely voluntary, but one can’t help but wonder about American racial myopia in relation to the President’s identity. He is, interestingly, descended from American slaves, but only on the “white-ish” side of his family, not the black African side.\n\nAnd here is where Lehmann’s analysis – opposite but symmetrical to D’souza’s focus on the politics of colonialism – really caught my interest:\n\n“If there is a politically applicable impression that emerges from the great mass of material [in Barack Obama: The Story], it is how much Obama is a child of the postcolonial era. Hawaii, Kenya, and Indonesia were all former colonies or possessions of the West, one of which was absorbed into a larger democratic nation, the other two of which became independent. The careers of Obama’s grandparents, his parents, and his stepfather all can be seen as workings out of the ways in which post-colonialism plays itself out in individual lives. And though the term “post-colonial” reads as “left,” both of Obama’s parents, though they probably would have been comfortable with that equation as applying to them politically, chose to work not as lifelong rebels but in the sorts of establishment roles that the end of colonialism opened up: his mother, in Indonesia, at the Ford Foundation; his father, in Kenya, at Shell Oil and then in a government bureau meant to promote the tourist business.”\n\nThis rings true to me, and is far more natural than D’souza’s hysteria over a threatening “anti-colonialism.” Fanon reminds us that colonial society is a Manichean society. Part of rejecting it must be learning, despite the pain, to recognize a more full sense of our societies and ourselves. It is difficult for all involved. But postcoloniality must not become a slogan. It must be a sensibility. A young Obama, writing in a letter to a college girlfriend (a letter which Barack Obama: The Story mines for insights), expresses one of the most characteristic features of the postcolonial condition: a sense of disconnection from the past:\n\n“Caught without a class, a structure, or tradition to support me, in a sense the choice to take a different path is made for me….”\n\nFor many of us, the path that Obama takes is not as important as the fact that it is different, and somehow reflects this postcolonial understanding of the world — one in which, in the words of a great poet, “everything and its absolute opposite are true.” Those who label this as confusion will soon find that the doors to the future are sealed by singularity.\n\n“We have enough,” Sam Carter concludes in a review of Woes of the True Policeman, the latest of Roberto Bolaño’s unfinished works to be published posthumously in the United States. Forceful words, but Carter doesn’t doubt Bolaño’s talent. He thinks that the late Chilean writer’s publishers are damaging his legacy:\n\n“The continued publication and popular packaging of [Bolaño’s] incomplete work may actually be diluting his reputation as a writer of varied talents and fearless ambition.”\n\nThe way Bolaño’s body of work has been handled in the U.S. has sometimes been confusing, and people are noticing. One commenter on a recent review over at lit-blog The Millions sums up this confusion well:\n\n“… The past 4 or 5 years has seen so many posthumously released Bolaño works that I sort of feel exhausted by them all. So much after the fact praise that I sometimes wonder if much of it is just hype and/or a fad.”\n\nIn 2012, Bolaño’s “myth” may be larger than his books. He is more than just a writer. He is the new face of Latin American literature in the United States, where a new generation of allegedly post-national readers are bored with the obstinate regionalism and unfashionable Marxism of the old Magical Realists. Some critics haven’t been so happy with this turn of events, and maybe they’re right. Maybe it’s wise to be suspicious of men who appear to answer so completely the desires of their times.\n\nIn a 2009 article entitled “Bolaño Inc.”, Salvadoran writer Horacio Castellanos Moya notes with suspicion that a distorted version of Bolaño’s life story has often been as important to his excited reception in North America as his writing. Castellanos Moya concludes that those who work in the shady realm where marketing and literature meet must be responsible for this villainy. Afterall, Bolaño has been dead for years and, if he is being exploited by large publishing conglomerates, can’t complain.\n\nCastellanos Moya argues that a market-ready image of the late Chilean writer as a down-and-out rebel, a social drop-out and failed revolutionary, has been created to sell his books to young and cynical cosmopolitans in the United States (he points out that Paste magazine even gave him the ridiculous title of “The Kurt Cobain of Latin American Literature”). Castellanos Moya is disgusted that the life of a talented writer, and a personal friend, could be fashioned by marketing teams into whatever they felt would compliment a particularly edgy-looking bookjacket photo. He writes:\n\n“The market has its landlords, like everything on this infected planet, and it’s the landlords of the market who decide the mambo that you dance, whether it’s selling cheap condoms or Latin American novels in the U.S.”\n\nThis is a cynical view, but the inflation of Bolaño’s time in prison facing down Chilean fascism, and the fabrication of his apparently non-existent heroin addiction do look pretty damning in this light. Castellanos Moya assures us, with evident joy at disappointing those who believe that Bolaño was a cross between Che Guevara and a junkie poet, that the writer died a committed family man living a middle-class suburban life and that he spent most of his time writing.\n\nAs a concerned friend of Bolaño, Castellanos Moya’s argument has a lot of force. But then the essay takes a turn. Out of duty or habit he polishes off dusty terms like “The U.S. Culture Industry” and the “North American Imagination” to argue that U.S. readers are also using a false image of Bolaño to confirm their stereotypes about their southern neighbors. If the entire canon of Latin American literature can no longer be reduced to García Márquez, then it can now be reduced to this new discovery: a prickly former Trotskyite/anarchist who wrote huge, labyrinthine postmodern novels, and — did you hear? — was a drug-addict (he wasn’t) and served time in a dictator’s prison (a little over one week).\n\nCastellanos Moya’s complaints are part of the inevitable debates over cultural ownership that arise every time an artist becomes an international phenomenon and the meaning of his or her work becomes, again, inevitably complicated. It’s fine to question what happens to a writer when he or she gets lifted out of his or her cultural context. But there are other related questions that Castellanos Moya doesn’t ask that may be more interesting. Why is Bolaño marketed as an opponent of the neoliberal global order (he fought against Pinochet!), when at the same time he can be interpreted as a defender of its core values (“Nationalism is a statue of shit slowly sinking in the desert”)? This leads to contradictions that may open the door to a more radical critique of his work — and also his “myth” — for those, like Castellanos Moya, who are suspicious of his sudden rise to fame among the powerful.\n\nThere is at least one glaring hole in the argument that the “Bolaño Myth” has been constructed by greedy capitalists and ugly Americans engaged in cultural tourism though. Many of Bolaño’s books, most obviously the semi-autobiographical The Savage Detectives, are elaborate works of self-mythology. When asked in his final interview in the Mexico edition of Playboy Magazine what it was like to be regarded as the Latin American writer with the most promising future, a terminally-ill Bolaño responded with the amusement that only a stoic can muster:\n\n“It must be a joke. I am the Latin American writer with the least promising future. But on that point, I am the type with the most past, which is what matters anyway.”\n\nIn other words, Bolaño knew what he was doing. That’s not the same as saying that even during his lifetime his narrative wasn’t starting to get away from him. Here are his own words on book publishers’ (and not just U.S.-based ones) fascination with his detainment by the Pinochet government:\n\n“…I was detained for eight days, although a little while ago in Italy, I was asked, ‘what happened to you? Can you tell us a little bit about your half a year in prison?’ That’s due to a misunderstanding in a German book where they had me in prison for half a year. At first they sentenced me to less time. It’s the typical Latin American tango. In the first book edited for me in Germany, they give me one month in prison; in the second book – seeing that the first one had sold so well – they raise it to three month; in the third book I’m up to four months; in the fourth book it’s five. The way it’s going, I should still be a prisoner now.”\n\nIt’s true: Bolaño did see an economic angle to the way publishers occasionally mishandled his life story (point one for Castellanos Moya and “Bolaño Inc.”). It seems that he also felt that he was, at least on some level, being stereotyped based on international views of Latin America as a land of dictatorship and revolutionary fervor (point two for Castellanos Moya, although Bolaño refers to Germany; he did not live to see his widespread success in the United States).\n\nBut the final sentence of Bolaño’s response — and also the general tone of his many interviews — suggests that he didn’t take any of this too seriously. What he took seriously were books, first other writers’ and then, by extension, his own. It’s that sensibility that may allow Bolaño to outlast not only inferior posthumous cash-ins, but also his own mythology.\n\n“[The Virgin Islands], in brief, has not been an isolated and inward-turned community slowly and imperceptibly building up a powerful sense of meaningful communality on the twin pillars of stability and continuity, but rather an outward-confronting, tropical state of nature successively shaken by the rude, elemental force of invading immigrant peoples bound together, at best, by fragile and tenuous relationships.”\n\n– Gordon K. Lewis, The Virgin Islands: A Caribbean Lilliput, (1972).\n\nThe problem of colonial education is a well-worn issue in Caribbean social criticism. Every major Caribbean thinker has had something to say about pedagogy. Frantz Fanon’s exasperation is memorable when he noted that school children in his native Martinique were learning their history from books that began with the words, “Our ancestors the Gauls…”, the problem being that the majority of “ancestors” to Martinican people were not Gauls at all.\n\nAnd it is not just education in the Caribbean that may have damaging effects on local students. It is also the education that Caribbean people receive abroad. One of my favorite passages from George Lamming’s The Pleasures of Exile argues that British Caribbeans should not attend University in England:\n\n“…Not because England is a bad place for studying, but because the students whole development as a person is thwarted by the memory, the accumulated stuff of childhood and adolescence which has been maintained and fertilized by England’s historic ties with the West Indies. It would have been better, perhaps, if he had gone to study in France or Germany, to mention countries with a different language; any place where his adjustments would have to take the form of understanding the inhabitants from scratch.”\n\nI can’t help but think of this when I see school children walking around my home island of St. John carrying worn and outdated copies of textbooks entitled These United States. I couldn’t help but be reminded of it last year when I substituted for an elementary school class and was left a lesson plan to teach the students that autumn arrives with the changing of the leaves. This is I think what Édouard Glissant means when he refers to societies that “little by little get lost in the unreal, and so irresponsible, use of language.”\n\nAddressing these issues requires consensus, and that is something that Caribbean societies — including my own — are not known for. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, where immigration has been emphatic and forceful, the present can seem under-determined. In America’s Virgin Islands: A History of Human Rights and Wrongs, historian William Boyer writes:\n\n“No other locale in the Caribbean […] or elsewhere in the world for that matter – had undergone such radical and rapid ethnic and economic change in the 1960′s than that experienced by America’s Virgin Islands.”‘\n\nIf our present isn’t neat, pure, or singular, the urge is to go looking for those qualities in the past. But since the past is often just a projection of our current anxieties and desires, our dilemma is never resolved. Yes, the pluralism that is often said to be an admirable quality of Caribbean islands is a gift; but it can also be experienced as a lack when we are feeling frustrated and cynical.\n\nDuring the “development decade”, the era beginning in the early 1960s, the modern USVI economy was born, and along with it the demand for labor that would be met primarily by men and women from other Caribbean Islands. Thanks to the booming economy, more people from the mainland United States also chose to make the Virgin Islands their home during this period. Suddenly three major contradictory narratives existed side by side each other in the territory. Some Virgin Islanders had become Americans by the purchase of their home. Some had become Americans by choice, seeking economic opportunity in the USVI. And for some, habitation in the Virgin Islands was a half-hearted escape from America without the disruptions of a forfeited citizenship. These narratives — each saying something about our relationship to the United States — do not seem to be reconcilable\n\nThose of us who grew up in the Virgin Islands from the 1960s onward are the heirs to the aspirations and degradations of the development decade, its successes and its failures. So why is this recent past so often invisible to us? The fluctuating world in which we were born has the illusion of permanence. But the development decade was nothing if not an abrupt rift in the past separating forever two eras, the time before and the time after.\n\nWithin the shifting realities of the U.S. Virgin Islands, the youth are the wildcard. Their memories are still fresh and untainted by nostalgia. They have no world but the one that is in the process of being born. How can educators in the Virgin Islands, responsible for helping the young develop, understand the nuances of the new world that their students belong to?\n\nIn 1983, Commissioner of Education and future Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands Dr. Charles W. Turnbull contributed an article to Volume I, No. 8 of VI Education Review, entitled “Migration and Educational Disequilibrium.” In it he charts the challenges faced by the Virgin Islands education system in the wake of the development decade. He puts some things in clear perspective. Here are the astonishing numbers:\n\n“In the period 1960 – 1975 the population of the U.S. Virgin Islands almost tripled, increasing by 188 percent [!!!]. The fastest growing state in the United States in the same period was Nevada whose population increased by 103 percent. It should be noted that the change in population per square mile on St. Thomas increased from 506 in 1960 to 1,372 in 1975. This placed St. Thomas second only to Barbados in the Caribbean and higher by far than any state in the Union.”\n\nThe children of non-citizen residents were at first excluded from the USVI public school system on the basis that the schools were already overburdened, but when the courts ruled that all children be given access to public education, the Virgin Islands public school district became one of the largest under the U.S. flag (188th out of 11,000 districts by the late 1970s). Dr. Turnbull notes that public school enrollment in the USVI in 1968 was 11,497 students. By 1981 it was 25,585 students.\n\nAnd the educators? Many teachers, too, during this period were recent arrivals to the U.S. Virgin Islands. Turnbull writes:\n\n“Particularly challenging and critical was the dilemma of the many non-Virgin Islands and non-West Indian teachers, most from the continental United States…who faced the awesome task of assimilating the immigrant child into a new and different school system. Very little in their background and training had prepared them for this. Not to be forgotten was the fact that the continental teachers faced assimilation problems themselves in some ways, not unlike the very immigrant children they were recruited to serve.”\n\nI think this is Turnbull’s very polite way of saying that many well-intentioned people may have in fact only added to the confusion of young Virgin Islanders of the late-20th century.\n\nSuch an enormous increase in enrollment would naturally put strains on any school system, but this was an influx of students into schools which already, according to Dr. Turnbull’s article, “routinely held thirty, forty, and even fifty children per class.” Virgin Islanders made great sacrifices in this era, but sometimes the challenges were daunting enough to create strains within the community, or as Turnbull writes of the conflict over limited public education resources:\n\n“Manifestations of this conflict were vividly evident at P.T.A meetings, school registrations and on radio talk shows. This had the effect of straining the chords of unity and tolerance in the multiracial, multicultural Virgin Islands.”\n\nThis sort of conflict, born of mass-immigration, is not at all unique to the USVI. The Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes wrote of the hypocrisies of our age that, “We celebrate the so-called globalization process because it facilitates the movement of goods, services, and securities around the world in a truly extraordinary manner. Things are free to circulate. But workers, human beings, are not.”\n\nThe equation, everywhere in the world, even in very generous communities (which I believe the U.S. Virgin Islands to be), is that an overcrowding of the commons creates conflict. This is only interesting insofar as these conflicts shape societies, and that they also can produce the conditions for healing.\n\nMore than these conflicts, I am interested in the idea of education itself, and what it means to a culturally-diverse community. Do educators have some obligation to put us all on the same page? What about the erasure of difference that this entails? I think this is where the idiosyncratic USVI dynamic I have just described may resonate beyond our shores. What path should schools take when faced with an influx of students (and teachers!) labeled by society as “alien” or foreign? Isn’t the language surrounding assimilation a bit frightening? But at the same time, raising a generation of outsiders also seems problematic. Today all teachers in the USVI are required to take a course in local history, but is that enough? Dr. Turnbull makes his opinion on the role of education clear at the end of the article when he writes:\n\n“..as a result of institutional stress, the role of the school as transmitter of traditional social values became blurred and defused.”\n\nI did not attend public school in the USVI. Others must speak to that experience. I was a student at private schools on both St. John and St. Thomas, and as a result of this, I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of teachers I had who even identified as Virgin Islanders. Many would say this shouldn’t matter. In part, I agree. All human hearts have the same capacity for understanding others. Falling into a myopic nationalism is useless, even when we are faced with confusing times.\n\nBut there is another side to this story as well. What do private school students in the U.S. Virgin Islands lose by being educated in what are essentially mainland-oriented institutions? Does it matter that many of these students come from families who have arrived in the Virgin Islands relatively recently? If they choose to integrate into the mosaic that is the Caribbean – their home – they will not learn how to do so at school.\n\nFollowing this line of thought can lead to distressing comparisons to an era in the Caribbean that we like to believe is over. There is a long tradition in the region of education serving the sinister – at least, to local people – purpose of creating good British, French, Spanish, Danish and Dutch citizens.\n\nShouldn’t local knowledge be given precedence in our schools over classes in U.S. Civics and U.S. History? Shouldn’t all children raised in the USVI be given the knowledge to place themselves in the context of their society, and indeed, the broader world? A very wise man once said that “national consciousness, which is not the same as nationalism, is the only thing that can give us an international dimension.”\n\nOne of the legacies of the USVI’s development decade is an education system that has frequently given young Virgin Islanders a conflicted sense of national consciousness. As for those educators who do their best to instill in their students the sort of generous global sensibility that can only come from a strong pride in place, I can only hope they know what a difference they make.\n\nFrom 2009 until 2011, I worked as a custom art framer in Portland, Maine. I never imagined that during this time in New England I would frame so many photos of the Caribbean. During long winters, pictures of the tropics were often dropped off at my workshop, and the idealized images of palm-lined beaches made me homesick for the Virgin Islands, even if their airbrushed vision of the Antilles was far from my own.\n\nImages are powerful. Even something as superficial as tourist art can be relentless when it presents itself as truth. The landscapes found on posters and in glossy photographs felt bludgeoning to me during those years; sometimes they even threatened to become more real than my memories. Everyone has a home. And whether we like it or not, the images of our homes that confront us shape our identity.\n\nFor Mainers, it must be the paintings of Andrew Wyeth that seem inescapable. During my time working in Portland, I framed hundreds of his prints. Wyeth, the second generation of a dynasty of American artists, spent his summers in Maine, and his work has become strongly attached to the state. His most famous painting, “Christina’s World”, is a symbol of New England to many people around the globe. Despite being made into an icon, the painting can still seem eerie. Is the subject a young girl daydreaming in the fields of her family farm? No, the woman is Christina Olson, crippled by polio, the isolated heir of a family of puritanical North Atlantic sailors, dragging herself back home after visiting her family cemetery plot. I stood in that same cemetery plot in Cushing, Maine in 2009. There was a fresh burial, a mound of dirt marked by a single yellow daffodil. I knew, although the headstone had not yet been placed, that the grave was Andrew Wyeth’s.\n\n“Christina’s World”, 1948. (Courtesy of Museum of Modern Art)\n\nIn the context of contemporary art, Andrew Wyeth can seem like the defender of an unfashionable realism. A painter of solemn rural scenes, Wyeth’s apparent nationalist streak has made his work sit uncomfortably with those critics who are curious about his ideological judgements. When art historian Robert Rosenblum was asked in 1977 to name the most underrated and overrated artists of the 20th-century, he mentioned only Andrew Wyeth.\n\nWhat Rosenblum meant by this is that Wyeth is popularly overrated — by the kind of people who trained art historians probably believe don’t “understand” art — and critically underrated, maybe for the same reason. Wyeth’s designation in the United States, “The People’s Painter”, was always an insult in avant-garde circles, meant to categorize Wyeth as a reactionary painter and a defender of mainstream Anglo-American values.\n\nBut what exactly are the politics of Andrew Wyeth’s paintings? His aristocratic bearing, his attachment to realism, and his disdain for most of the bohemian art of his era say enough about his cultural conservatism. But I doubt that Wyeth is described accurately as a defender of mainstream Anglo-American values. As far as I can see his values are the values of an outsider.\n\nWyeth’s vision of a desolate and decrepit America is not the vision of a man at ease. His biographers often emphasize the frail health and isolation of his childhood. Andrew was frequently ill and home-schooled, not allowed much contact with people outside the family compound. His father, the famous (and famously intense) illustrator N.C. Wyeth, was his only teacher. The Wyeths were an old New England family (the first Wyeth to arrive in the United States was Nicholas Wyeth, who settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1645), but more recent immigrants had also influenced Andrew’s branch of the Wyeth clan. His father, in his twenties, wrote about this lineage:\n\n“My grandmother was born in the mountains of Switzerland. When twenty-three years of age she tore herself away from all her people and the quiet romantic little dairy home to follow my grandfather to America. Dropped into the heart of Cambridge, Mass., among strange people, unable even to speak a word of their tongue, she lived for three years. Then it was, in 1867, that my grandfather purchased a lonesome bit of land in the outskirts of Needham and on the Charles River, and here my dear old grandmother almost pined her heart away for her home and people in the Swiss mountains…. [this nostalgia] has always impressed me profoundly, and I in turn have inherited that strange love for things remote, things delicately perfumed with that sadness that is so exquisitely beautiful.”\n\nN.C.’s nostalgia isn’t surprising when taken alongside his work; melancholy currents run deep through his famous “blood and thunder” illustrations.\n\nWhat’s more interesting than his sentimentality is that he finds the source of his own pathos in the inherited dispossession of a “self-exiled” ancestor. Maybe it is partly this dispossession, passed down another generation, that gives his son Andrew, whose best-known portraits are of loners and exiles, his outsider’s edge.\n\nAndrew’s America is an austere, wintry world populated with people whose surnames are not exactly associated with the Anglo-Yankeedom that has sometimes championed his work. The Olsons, Kuerners, and Testorfs who wander Wyeth’s bleak countryside are strangers. “I pick out models who are misfits. And I’m a misfit,” he said.\n\nAside from the warmth and identification with which he portrayed a few of his “misfit” models, Wyeth is best known for coldness and alienation. In 1945, Andrew’s father, N.C., was killed when his car stalled at a railroad crossing, an event that was the catalyst for Andrew’s maturation as an artist and his subsequent obsession with death and loss. Every landscape that Wyeth painted after that year was, by his own admission, a portrait of his father – severe, imposing, and possessing the qualities of an eroding memory.\n\nIt’s bizarre that Andrew Wyeth, an artist of obvious eccentricity and some might say opacity, became so beloved in the United States as a national painter. To this day, his vision of New England, so clearly his own harrowing psychological landscape, is often read as conventional American realism by those who hang his prints above their fireplaces. Frank Fowler, a dealer of Andrew Wyeth’s work, is on to something when he argues that Wyeth is, despite his ties to the realist tradition, better thought of as an abstractionist since:\n\n“…his trees, birds, and kitchen stoves, which look precisely like trees, birds, and kitchen stoves are likely to be metaphors for loneliness, violence or decay.”\n\nIs there anything more death-haunted and despairing in 20th-century American art than the solitary cresting wave in “Adrift”? Or the long shadows in “Young Bull”?\n\nIf Wyeth’s paintings are deceptively quiet, it is only to make the violence they conceal more unnerving. Karl Keurner, one of the his frequent models, was a former German soldier during World War I, and a neighbor of the Wyeths in Pennsylvania. Andrew spent years painting the Keurner farm, which he once noted in an interview did not interest him in any picturesque way. Instead, he was impressed by the place abstractly and emotionally, noting its utilitarian, nearly militaristic nature. He once said of Karl Keurner that “[his eyes] have looked down a machine-gun barrel, squinted great distances… those are my father’s lips – cruel.” Rarely does Keurner appear in Wyeth’s world without also the suggestion of violence, as in the painting entitled “Karl” with its meat hooks and cracking ceiling.\n\nEven the serenity of “Groundhog Day”, otherwise be a tranquil rendering of Karl’s kitchen, is interrupted by the menace of jagged saw cuts in the logs outside Keurner’s window.\n\nAs for Maine, Wyeth was not a native of that state, but in many ways it has adopted him, and his choice of a final resting place suggests that he found this fitting. His paintings have become a part of Maine’s mythology.\n\nAn insular state that depends heavily on tourism for its revenue, Maine is another place where images threaten to become more real than reality. I sometimes wonder if it’s right that the state’s most familiar aesthetic was born in the tortured, anti-modern imagination of Andrew Wyeth. I wonder, at least, how native Mainers experience this. What is their truth?\n\nWyeth described Maine as “spidery, light in color, windy perhaps, sometimes foggy, giving the impression sometimes of crackling skeletons rattling in the attic.” It’s a romantic description, and with the same Gothic sentimentality found in his father’s illustrations. But maybe every place deserves its romance as long as it doesn’t thrash the inner-landscapes of those who live there. I admit that, years from now, when I think of my time in Maine, I will partly think of Andrew Wyeth and his battered vision of New England: a place forceful enough to be bruising, yet brittle enough to appear fragile."
