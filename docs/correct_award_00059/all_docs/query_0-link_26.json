According to him, a poet is more than just an artist who weaves words together, but a wanderer who embarks on a profound journey to uncover the uncharted territories of the heart. The poet ventures into realms of raw emotions, unspoken desires, and intricate thoughts that often remain concealed. It is through this exploration of the innermost depths of the human experience that the poet brings to life the unseen, the intangible, and the sublime. Like a courageous explorer, the poet fearlessly delves into the vast expanse of emotions and experiences, unafraid to face the unknown and to reveal the hidden truths that lie within our hearts.",
