        "text": "Before I set out on my rant against cantankerous old codgers with whom I disagree, full disclosure is necessary.\n\nI haven’t yet reached the point of yelling at kids to get off my lawn, but I confess it sometimes feels like the universe has stacked the odds against me. For example, I have a deck overlooking an expansive backyard. It’s a perfect place to read the books I review for modest remuneration.\n\nIt seems each time I pour myself an ice-cold iced tea and remove myself to my favorite chair on the deck, one of my neighbors fires up their lawnmower or lets their yip yap outside to yippy yappy at the guy who’s just minding his own beeswax. It doesn’t matter what time of day it is – Sunday at 7 p.m. or Saturday at 7 a.m.\n\nNo more than 10 minutes after I finished my day’s work and opened my book last night, my lawncare service decided to show up at 5:30 p.m. instead of their usual 11 a.m. Seriously?\n\nIt’s enough to make a guy go all Basil Fawlty or repeat Jean-Paul Sartre’s dictum that hell is other people.\n\nSo, yeah, I understand cantankerous enough to call it out in others. Who better to address another cantankerous cuss than this nearly old but still crotchety cootie-coot? The guy for whom it’s not enough to alphabetize his albums but arrange them chronologically by genre?\n\nOut of convenience, I arrange all my Bob Dylan together in my rock section, even though one would be hard-pressed to categorize all of Mr. Zimmerman’s releases as rock. But organizing it under folk makes no more sense than including Sonny Terry and Brownie McGee, who will always be associated, to me, at least, with blues music.\n\nFor better or worse, the Nobel Prize for Literature folks categorized Dylan with the literary likes of William Butler Yeats, Thomas Mann, Saint-John Perse, William Faulkner, T.S. Eliot, Ernest Hemingway, Herman Hesse, and Seamus Heaney. I registered my reservations regarding Dylan’s inclusion at length in this real estate back in 2016 but shrugged my shoulders that it was their prize, and they could give it to anyone they pleased.\n\nOthers took it upon themselves to either praise Dylan to the heavens or prematurely spit on his legacy. Still, I was firmly committed to remaining uncommitted about the wisdom of granting him a Nobel. Nothing could take away the thrills and pleasures of reading Robert Shelton’s Dylan biography in high school and calling the WMHW-FM Sunday afternoon deejays to request my favorite Dylan tracks. I was also helped along by a girlfriend’s extensive Dylan vinyl catalog and my purchase on the same day of Bruce Springsteen’s Born to Run and Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks in 1975. I even stuck with him during his 1980s creative drought, relieved temporarily by his 1986 tour with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers (a terrific show, by the way, featuring Bob Seger on the “Knocking on Heaven’s Door”).\n\nLast weekend’s Wall Street Journal included an essay by Joseph Epstein, a knowledgeable and erudite scholar if ever there was one, in which he claimed the Dylan Nobel devalued the award: “If Bob Dylan deserves a Nobel Prize in Literature, the award doesn’t deserve the respect of anyone.”\n\nAlthough I’ll trust Epstein’s opinion on most anything literary, his take on Dylan’s music is nothing more than a cheap caricature: “His songs have nothing to do with literature, and most, in any case, are derived from Woody Guthrie.” Ugh. I guess Epstein’s unfamiliar with the Bible, Paul Verlaine, and Arthur Rimbaud, not to mention classic Japanese theater. More likely, he’s simply unfamiliar with the entirety of Dylan’s oeuvre.\n\nI’m still neutral over whether the Bard of Hibbing deserves his Nobel, but at least this iconoclast knows his music.\n\nBruce Edward Walker (walker.editorial@gmail.com) is a Morning Sun columnist."
