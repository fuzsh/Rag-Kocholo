He was the son of a bookseller who became a French poet, journalist, and librarian.\n\n(5) In 1927, Henri Bergson, a French philosopher, won the prize.\n\n(6) A French novelist, Roger Martin du Gard, was given the prize in 1937.\n\n(7) André Gide was awarded the prize in 1947. He is known as a French writer of many different genres and styles.\n\n(8) French novelist, journalist, critic, journalist, and poet François Mauriac was given the Nobel Prize in 1952.\n\n(9) Albert Camus, a French philosopher, won the prize in 1957.
