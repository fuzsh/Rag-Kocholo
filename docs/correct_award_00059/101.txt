Saint-John Perse.

Saint-John Persepseudonym of Marie-Rene-Auguste-Alexis Saint-Leger Leger(b. May 31, 1887, Saint-Leger-les-Feuilles, Guadeloupe--d. Sept. 20, 1975, Presqu'ile-de-Giens, Fr.)

French poet and diplomat who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1960 "for the soaring flight and evocative imagery of his poetry."

In 1914 Leger entered the diplomatic service. He went to China and was successively consul at Shanghai and secretary at Beijing. He was later secretary (1921-32) to the French statesman Aristide Briand, and in 1933 he was appointed secretary-general at the Foreign Ministry, with the rank of ambassador. Dismissed from office in 1940 and deprived of French citizenship by the collaborationist Vichy government, he went to the United States. He returned to France in 1957.

His early poetry includes Eloges (1911; Eloges, and Other Poems), which shows the influence of Symbolism; he later developed a more personal style. The language of his poetry, admired especially by poets for its precision and purity, is difficult, and he made little appeal to the general public. The best-known early work is Anabase (1924; Anabasis , translated by T.S. Eliot). In the poems written in exile--Exile (1942; Exile, and Other Poems), Vents (1946; Winds), Amers (1957; Seamarks), Chronique (1960), and Oiseaux (1962; Birds)--he achieved a deeply personal note. For some, Saint-John Perse is the embodiment of the French national spirit--intellectual yet passionate, deeply conscious of the tragedy of life, a man of affairs with an artist's feeling for perfection and symmetry.
