When it comes to a potential Kroger and Albertsons merger, Gurdgiev believes the action would have an adverse effect on consumer choice, local purchasing and small businesses within communities.\n\n“Socio-economic costs of such mergers are far outweighing any claimed benefits to shareholders and the Wall Street,” Gurdgiev said.\n\nMilan Larson, Ph.D.\n\nManagement, Associate Professor\n\nMilan Larson, Ph.D., focuses his research on company culture, HR departments and managing the workforce. While the impact such a merger can have on the market is important, Larson can speak to the effect on employees at both grocery companies. Larson has found that merger failure rate is often due to the inability to merge the company cultures."
