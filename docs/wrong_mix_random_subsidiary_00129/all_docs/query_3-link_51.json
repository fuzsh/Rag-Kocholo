The movie tells the story of a broken-hearted Erica (Christina Milian), who is an aspiring pop star searching for her big break. She takes a job singing at weddings on a distant island in order to revive her floundering career.\n\nAs fate would have it, the wedding she is assigned to is none other than her ex-fiancÃ© Jason's (Jay Pharoah). What happens next is an unpredictable blend of hilarity and heartwarming scenes, all set against the splendid backdrop of Mauritius, where the movie is said to take place.\n\nDirected by Steven K. Tsuchida, who is also behind other successful projects such as On My Block, Cobra Kai, Haters Back Off, Grown-ish, and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Resort to Love was produced by Alicia Keys, Jeremy Kipp Walker, and Maggie Malina.\n\nAccording to Rotten Tomatoes, Resort To Love earned an average rating of 5.80/10 with a score of 59% based on 17 reviews. Metacritic gave the series a weighted average grade of 46 out of 100, taking into account five critics' opinions-signifying \"mixed or average\" feedback overall. Variety's Lisa Kennedy commented: \"Resort to Love is slight...but why would you want to deny your friend her pleasure while she reads and drinks a margarita on the beach? It's summer, after all.\"\n\nResort to Love Locations\n\nThe slate went down on the Resort to Love production in October 2020, and filming concluded later that December. It was undoubtedly a great time to visit the island, although it could be argued that there's never a bad time for some sun, sand, and sea.\n\nFilming took place on the island of Mauritius, and now fans of the movie can treat themselves to the same experience by staying at the Constance Prince Maurice Resort. It so happens that the cast and crew also lodged at the very same resort during production.\n\nSituated off the coast of Africa, Mauritius is virtually paradise, with its temperate climate throughout the year, offering an abundance of cities, beaches, jungles, and exclusive resorts. Even scenes intended to be filmed in New York City and snowy environments were shot on-location on the island. Producers were determined to give Mauritius the northern-city feel, and their efforts paid off.\n\nAfter her music producer fails to show up to the album release party that would've launched Erica Wilson's (Christina Milian) pop star dreams, she and her best friend Amber (Tymberlee Hill) find themselves crying in despair on the streets. Hearing Alicia Keys' song \"No One\" from nearby buskers reminds Erica of when her relationship with her ex-fiancÃ© Jason (Jay Pharoah) ended abruptly before their wedding.\n\nThe song stirs up her emotions because it was supposed to be the track playing during their first dance. Unable to watch her friend let go of both love and career, Amber, who is a social media influencer, books Erica an entertainer gig at an upscale resort in Mauritius. It takes some persuading, but Erica decides to take the job.\n\nPort Louis, located in the southwestern portion of Mauritius, is a lively city and an important port. With an estimated population of 137,000 individuals, it serves as the nation's capital. Its cultural diversity makes it one of the most unique cities in the Indian Ocean, with a community of people with both African and Indian backgrounds.\n\nThe city is also known for its colonial-style architecture that can be seen throughout many of its bustling streets as well as its museums and markets like Blue Penny, which features rare historical coins. There are also multiple attractions, including the picturesque Citadel Fort and numerous beaches on nearby coastal resorts.\n\nTourists flock to Port Louis so that they can immerse themselves in this cosmopolitan city; with its variety of experiences, Port Louis will surely provide an unforgettable visit. Getting to Port Louis, Mauritius is most convenient by air.\n\nThe city's Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport, located approximately 25 km from Port Louis, is the main gateway to the country and provides direct or connecting flights from several major airports around the world. You can easily reach downtown Port Louis via car or taxi from the airport, which will take about half an hour depending on traffic.\n\nOnce in the city, there is an excellent modern public transport system with buses that allow passengers to pay in cash as they board. There is also a fairly extensive network of car rental companies offering good rates as well as daily and monthly packages for those wishing to explore Mauritius independently at their own pace.\n\nUpon arriving at the resort, Erica is welcomed by Barrington (TJ Power), a jack-of-all-trades, who is also a member of her band. Initially, she expected paradise and a chance to leave her worries behind but quickly realizes she has been hired as a wedding singer.\n\nHer initial performance isn't up to par and she begins to doubt herself. Taking Barrington's advice, she decides to put her heart into it by singing Gloria Gaynor's \"I Will Survive,â and an uplifting montage follows showing her making the most out of her stay on the island and embracing its beauty.\n\nConstance Prince Maurice is a luxurious, five-star resort situated on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius. This glamorous tropical oasis offers its exclusive guests decadent spa experiences, exquisite gourmet restaurants, and spectacular nature views. Bedecked in lush foliage and well-appointed villas with butler service, the exotic getaway offers a unique experience like none other.\n\nGuests have access to world-class amenities such as private beaches, an array of engaging water sports activities along with personalized wellness packages catered exclusively for them. With its pristine scenery and abundant natural beauty surrounding you throughout your stay, Constance Prince Maurice promotes peace, relaxation, and utter bliss for everyone who visits.\n\nOne way of getting there is by flying directly into Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport located in Plaisance, where you can take a complimentary transfer shuttle provided by Constance Prince Maurice. Alternatively, if you're already in Mauritius, you can take advantage of their ferry service and explore the beautiful sea views along the way."
