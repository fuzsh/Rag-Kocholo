        "text": "Dexter: Original Sin has cast four new series regulars to join previously announced Patrick Gibson, who is taking over the titular serial killer role (in his younger years) made famous by Michael C. Hall in Showtime’s Dexter.\n\nAs production kicks off today in Miami with Clyde Phillips at the helm, James Martinez (Love, Victor), Christina Milian (Falling Inn Love) and Alex Shimizu (The Blacklist) have joined the series portraying younger versions of OG characters.\n\nMartinez plays Angel Batista (originally portrayed by David Zayas), an up-and-coming homicide detective who leads with his heart; Milian plays Maria LaGuerta (Luna Lauren Velez), Miami Metro’s first female homicide detective; and Shimizu plays Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee), a forensic analyst who eagerly shares his expertise while relishing the chance to boss around his new intern, Dexter Morgan.\n\nWilson also joins the cast as a new character, Bobby Watt, the longtime partner and confidant of Dexter’s adopted dad, who is played by Christian Slater in Dexter: Original Sin.\n\nThe 10-episode original drama series from Paramount+ with Showtime follows Dexter (Gibson) in 1991 Miami, a student transitioning into a serial killer in training. When his bloodthirsty urges can no longer be ignored, Dexter finds solace and understanding in Harry. As his only confidant, he teaches Dexter a Code that’s designed to help him find and kill people who deserve to die—all while avoiding getting caught by law enforcement. This is a particular challenge for young Dexter as he begins a forensics internship at the Miami Metro Police Department.\n\nMolly Brown also stars as a young Debra Morgan, Dexter’s sister.\n\nDexter: Original Sin is executive produced by Clyde Phillips and produced by Showtime Studios and Counterpart Studios. Scott Reynolds also EPs alongside, Michael C. Hall, Mary Leah Sutton, Tony Hernandez, Lilly Burns, with Robert Lloyd Lewis producing. Michael Lehmann will serve as directing executive producer.\n\nMartinez was most recently seen on Hulu’s Love, Victor and Wolf Pack from Paramount+. His past roles include Netflix’s House of Cards and One Day at a Time, Tell Me a Story, CSI, Unforgettable and Elementary for CBS. He is repped by Sweet 180 and Artists and Representatives.\n\nMilian’s past credits include Netflix’s Resort to Love, Step Up: High Water for YouTube Red/Starz, Netflix’s Falling Inn Love and Soundtrack, Crackle’s The Oath, Bring It On: Fight to the Finish, Fox’s Family Guy and Grandfathered, Be Cool, to name a few. Next up, she will star in Meet Me Next Christmas and Body Language, both feature films she stars in and produced. Milian is repped by Neon Kite, Milian Management and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman, Smelkinson & Christopher.\n\nShimizu is best known for his recurring role on the hit NBC series The Blacklist and will be featured in Taika Waititi’s upcoming series Interior Chinatown. Other notable credits include AMC’s The Terror, CBS’ S.W.A.T. and the 2017 film The Outcasts. He is repped by Rosenzweig Group and the Alexander White Agency.\n\nWilson made his television debut on The Cosby Show and has since starred in a slew of television series including NBC’s Good Girls, CBS’ Mike & Molly, Netflix’s Heist, ABC’s Blind Justice, the Paramount+ miniseries Fatal Attraction and Peacock’s Bel-Air. He is repped by Buchwald and More Medavoy."
