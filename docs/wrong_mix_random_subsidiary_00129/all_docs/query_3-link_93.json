Best known for her hit singles \"Dip It Low\" and \"AM To PM\" she's also starred in films as Love Don't Cost a Thing and Be Cool as well as various TV productions.\n\nPost by CTE on\n\nHer album has been revamped. She will only have songs produced by Tricky & Dream. \"Diamonds\" has been given to Teairra Mari.\n\nPost by discoloser on\n\nDo you think UATW will be on it? 'Cause i love it and i hope we can get hard copies of this cd! lol\n\nPost by Gray. on\n\n^If it is, it'll probably be a bonus track at the very end of the album.\n\nPost by Linnethia Monique on\n\nIts been confirmed that UATW will be the only track on the album not produced by The-Dream/Tricky Stewart/LOS combo.\n\nPost by The Northern Star⭐ on\n\nI need the full song of Zipper now.\n\nPost by tamed09 on\n\nIs that a new Promo pic?\n\nPost by **βécky**™ on\n\nIs that a new Promo pic?\n\nYes, shot by Mike Ruiz.\n\nwww.christinamilianphotos.com/thumbnails.php?album=1047\n\nPost by theprophet on\n\nIt's not a promo pic, it's from her YRB shoot\n\nPost by #MusicMan on\n\nI need the full song of Zipper now.\n\nPost by OH SNAP! on\n\nThis song is the SHIT! The best song of the year so far!\n\nPost by Sir Benji on\n\nit probably is but \"Zipper\" is staright up HOTNESS idk how she's gonna top it\n\nPost by MaterialGirl on\n\nI'm so excited for this album now. \"Zipper\" needs to be released ASAP! That song should be huge.\n\nPost by XXIX on\n\nHer album has been revamped. She will only have songs produced by Tricky & Dream. \"Diamonds\" has been given to Teairra Mari.\n\nI like that song.. She should've kept it... I'd also like to hear her version of \"Punch You In Your Sleep\".. if that is still around for her..\n\nPost by Gray. on\n\nit probably is but \"Zipper\" is staright up HOTNESS idk how she's gonna top it\n\nShe just needs to release it as the single!\n\nPost by MaterialGirl on\n\nI wonder did ever shoot the videos like they planned a few weeks ago.\n\nPost by CTE on\n\nSMH I thought the song leaked. I'm not going to keep playing with this bish. She better GONE!\n\nPost by Kishi KCM on\n\nI like Zipper a lot!\n\nPost by OH SNAP! on\n\nI wonder did ever shoot the videos like they planned a few weeks ago.\n\nI don't know what the bitch is waiting for. She's too busy spending The Dream's money.\n\nPost by COW COW COW COW COW COW COW on\n\n'Zipper' is great...Is it reallt produced by the Dream? And if the entire album is produced by the Dream, it will be one of the worst albums ever...\n\nSeriously, the Dream did like four songs on Ciara's album...and they were all straight-up mid-tempo filler.\n\nPost by d.t.m on\n\nZipper has grown on me. Interesting album title.\n\nPost by XXIX on\n\n\"Zipper\" grew on me... I like her voice on the song, but the chorus is still a little too all over the place for me.\n\nPost by MaterialGirl on\n\nA snippet of her version of \"Diamonds\" leaked. It's FAR better than Teairra Mari's, I hated her version. Christina's snippet actually sounds HOT.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nI like zipper.. buuutt.. she could do better."
