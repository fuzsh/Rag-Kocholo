        "text": "Listen to the full\n\nShannon’s Scoop Here!\n\nI’m Shannon Renee and here’s your Scoop!\n\nThe Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus Revamped\n\nThe Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus had to take down their tents a while ago. They had declining ticket sales because of people’s changing views on the treatment of animals. So, they’ve had to reimagine what the circus looks like. The circus is such a staple, especially back in the day for families and stuff to go to. Now it’s going to be like high-wire tricks, trapeze artists, bicycle acts, skateboarders and more. The new setup looks pretty cool! So, if that is your thing they will be at the Little Caesar’s Arena for six performances on November 17th through the 19th!\n\nNick Cannon Wishes He Had a Baby with Christina Milian\n\nWell, Nick Cannon, Nick Cannon, as though he hasn’t already populated half the earth, sat down for an interview recently and was asked about who he wish he could have had a baby with. His answer? Christina Milian. He basically said when he found out she was pregnant he said, ‘that could have been me’. Do you think Christina Milian is sitting there looking at all his baby mamas saying, ‘that could have been me’? No. I’m sure she’s like, ‘I’m glad that’s not me!’ It’s just amazing to me the stuff that he doesn’t care talking about. Who answers that question? That’s so weird.\n\nJ. Cole Admits To Smoking at Very Early Age\n\nJ. Cole was on the “Lead by Example” podcast and made an interesting confession. He said he started smoking cigarettes with some older kids in his neighborhood when he was just 6-years-old! J. said when he got busted by his mother it was actually a life changing moment because he saw the look on her face and realized, “oh, my actions can hurt someone else.” Now, times were different back then. I would ride to the store when I was a kid and my mom used to write a little note for me to buy her cigarettes! So, it was a different time and a different world at that point. Personally, I don’t know how much he actually has learned about how his actions affect other people. I was at a show once where he was like three hours late for a meet-and-greet! I guess I’m still holding a grudge.\n\nI’m Shannon Renee and that’s your Scoop!\n\nShannon Renee is the morning show co-host on “The Morning Bounce” on 105.1 The Bounce.
