She made her television debut in the ITV adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma before transitioning to film roles, marking an early divergence from academia towards a flourishing career in the arts. Beckinsale rapidly gained international recognition through her compelling performance in the war film Pearl Harbor, showcasing not only her versatility but also her dedication to character development. This was followed by another major breakthrough with the action horror film Underworld, where she masterfully portrayed Selene, a vampire warrior - a role which thereafter became synonymous with Beckinsale's name. The movie subsequently spawned several sequels and firmly established Beckinsale as an action heroine. Outside of her professional life, Beckinsale is known for being multilingual due to her educational background. Her philanthropic endeavors are also noteworthy; she has been involved with various charitable organizations over time. Despite facing personal challenges including health issues and navigating life under public scrutiny, Kate Beckinsale has proven herself both resilient and inspirational – traits that have seen her evolve into one of Hollywood's most respected figures.\n\nAge : 34\n\nBirthplace : France, Paris\n\nEmma Watson, known for her exemplary talent and commitment to social activism, is one of the most influential figures in contemporary cinema.

Watson's breakthrough came at a young age when she was cast as Hermione Granger in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter film series. This role catapulted her into international fame and earned her several accolades for a performance that spanned all eight films from 2001 until 2011. Outside of Harry Potter, Watson has demonstrated versatility taking on roles across genres including period dramas like Little Women, thrillers such as The Bling Ring, and fairy-tale fantasies exemplified by Disney's live-action adaptation of Beauty and The Beast. Apart from acting, Emma Watson has been equally passionate about social issues particularly gender equality which led to an appointment as UN Women Goodwill Ambassador in July 2014. She launched the HeForShe campaign advocating for men's involvement towards achieving gender equality worldwide later that year - an initiative that gained global attention and praise.\n\nIllustrator, Poet, Songwriter\n\nAge : Dec. at 87 (1904-1991)\n\nBirthplace : Springfield, Massachusetts\n\nTheodor Seuss Geisel ( or (listen); March 2, 1904 – September 24, 1991) was an American children's author, political cartoonist, illustrator, poet, animator, screenwriter, and filmmaker. He is known for his work writing and illustrating more than 60 books under the pen name Doctor Seuss ( or abbreviated Dr. Seuss). His work includes many of the most popular children's books of all time, selling over 600 million copies and being translated into more than 20 languages by the time of his death.Geisel adopted the name \"Dr. Seuss\" as an undergraduate at Dartmouth College and as a graduate student at Lincoln College, Oxford. He left Oxford in 1927 to begin his career as an illustrator and cartoonist for Vanity Fair, Life, and various other publications. He also worked as an illustrator for advertising campaigns, most notably for FLIT and Standard Oil, and as a political cartoonist for the New York newspaper PM. He published his first children's book And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street in 1937. During World War II, he took a brief hiatus from children's literature to illustrate political cartoons, and he also worked in the animation and film department of the United States Army where he wrote, produced or animated many productions – both live-action and animated – including Design for Death, which later won the 1947 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.After the war, Geisel returned to writing children's books, writing classics like If I Ran the Zoo (1950), Horton Hears a Who! (1955), If I Ran the Circus (1956), The Cat in the Hat (1957), How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (1957), and Green Eggs and Ham (1960). He published over 60 books during his career, which have spawned numerous adaptations, including 11 television specials, five feature films, a Broadway musical, and four television series. Geisel won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1958 for Horton Hatches the Egg and again in 1961 for And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street. Geisel's birthday, March 2, has been adopted as the annual date for National Read Across America Day, an initiative on reading created by the National Education Association.\n\nAge : 66\n\nBirthplace : Iowa\n\nJohn E. Osborn is an American lawyer, life sciences and healthcare industry executive, and former diplomat who has served in the United States Department of State and as a member of the United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy.\n\nMathematician, Physicist, Professor\n\nAge : Dec. at 76 (1942-2018)\n\nBirthplace : Oxford, Oxfordshire, England, UK\n\nStephen Hawking was a world-renowned physicist and cosmologist known for his ground-breaking work in theoretical physics. Born on January 8, 1942, in Oxford, England, he displayed a keen interest in science from a young age. Despite being diagnosed with a rare early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease that gradually paralyzed him over the decades, Hawking pursued his education at both Oxford and Cambridge, earning distinctions in Natural Science and a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, specializing in general relativity and cosmology. Hawking's contributions to the field of theoretical physics are countless. His work on singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation, catapulted him to global recognition. He also collaborated with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems, providing a set of conditions under which a singularity would occur in nature. He further developed a mathematical proof for black holes, and his research on quantum mechanics and thermal properties of light in the early 1970s led to his discovery that black holes could theoretically leak energy and particles into space, and eventually explode‚ an astonishing revelation in the field of astrophysics. Beyond the sphere of academia, Stephen Hawking became a household name through his best-selling books, most notably A Brief History of Time which sold over 25 million copies worldwide. Despite the progressive nature of his disease which resulted in his reliance on a speech-generating device for communication, Hawking continued to lecture, write, and inspire millions around the world until his death on March 14, 2018. In life and after, Hawking remains an indomitable figure in the realm of science, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, and an embodiment of the quest for knowledge."
