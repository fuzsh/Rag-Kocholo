Both the scientiﬁc method and the communication of science are narrative processes. Yet the power and structure of story are neither widely taught nor openly advocated. Science is now facing signiﬁcant problems stemming from this oversight, from the proliferation of false positives within the ﬁeld to a growing antiscience sentiment outside the ﬁeld. Help is needed, but the experts in the humanities who ought to provide assistance are buried in their own problems and lack a practical perspective. I argue that science should turn to the people who have spent a century learning and applying the real world power of narrative—­the writers, directors, actors, editors and other veterans of Hollywood. There is nothing to be feared from narrative. It pervades all aspects of human culture. Scientists must realize that science is a narrative process, that narrative is story, therefore science needs story.\n\nvii\n\nI INTRODUCTION WHY SCIENCE NEEDS STORY\n\nHouston, We Have a Narrative\n\n“How would you like to share your communication ideas with an audience of 1,000 eager minds?” That was my friend Megan’s invitation, asking me to take part in a panel discussion at a 2013 meeting of ocean scientists in San Diego. It’s the sort of activity I do these days. I used to be a scien­ tist, I became a ﬁlmmaker, and now I work with scientists help­ ing them communicate more effectively with the public. I could hear the excitement in her voice—­it was a chance to present my work on communication and storytelling to a large and interested crowd. It sounded good, so I agreed. As the summer went by I didn’t give it much thought, then about six weeks before the event I looked at the meeting web­ site to see what I had signed up for. There were two other panel­ ists, both of whom I know and who are more than ten years my senior. But more importantly, they are two of the world’s top experts on the subject of sea level rise—­something I know virtually nothing about. Furthermore, looking at the title of the panel, “Responding to Sea Level Rise,” there was no clue where I, the scientist-­turned-­ ﬁlmmaker, ﬁt in. The event felt like “Two Great Scientists (plus this other guy).”\n\n2\n\nIN T ROD U C T ION : W HY SC IEN C E N EEDS S TO RY\n\nI said to myself, “Houston, we have a problem.” I called Megan and asked if there was a reason why she had put me on a panel for something I know so little about. She said, “Yes, yes, yes—­these guys are dying to work with you. They want you to use your storytelling knowledge to do makeovers on their presentations.” We talked it through. By the end I understood her idea and it sounded cool—­a chance to implement the teachings of my books and workshops on the need to tell better stories. Great! I set to work writing an email to the four of us, laying out my initial ideas. I would reshape the scientists’ material into a set of stories they and I would tell, taking turns presenting different parts. It seemed perfect . . . until the scientists replied. There was immediate pushback. One of them said that his presentation was already set—­he had been giving it for over a year—­everyone loves it. Basically, it’s not broken, no need to ﬁx it, thanks. The other was in Europe and said he didn’t have the time for changes. I pushed a little harder, explaining my ideas further, including how the team presentation style would add energy to the normally dull panel format. They didn’t seem to like my labeling things as “normally dull.” And did I mention they were ages 68 and 70? “We just don’t need it,” one of them wrote. But of course I ig­ nored that. I was still sold on Megan’s enthusiasm, so I did what I always do—­I kept pushing. Finally the truth started coming out. “Look,” one of them replied, “both of us are known as good speakers. We’re very busy. We’ll show up and give our standard talks. It will be ﬁne.” I shot back, “I know, but what I want is more than ‘ﬁne.’ With the power of narrative we can reach a higher level and give the crowd an event to remember.” “I just don’t see how it’s going to work,” his next email said. “You’re talking about us taking repeated turns speaking. We’ll be\n\n3\n\nPART I\n\ngetting up and sitting down, bumping into each other—­it sounds like a mess.” I replied, “No, trust me, the audience will appreciate the energy of the team effort. It shows we’re listening to each other.” And then . . . well, there were a couple more exchanges, until one of them ﬁnally said, “Randy, all of us have given countless numbers of these talks. We all know how they work. We all have the same amount of experience. There’s just no need for what you’re describing.” And that was it. A moment of realization for me. Presentations given by scientists, administrators, students—­ pretty much anyone—­are very, very personal. They are an exten­ sion of the speaker’s inner being, an expression of the ego. In this age of TED Talks, everyone is working on their presentations—­ running them by their friends and family, honing and shaping them. My asking to get in and mess with others’ presentations is like asking to come over and reorganize their underwear drawers. It really is that personal. I could sense I had hit the limit. An eruption was approaching. Which meant it was time to end it by showing how hopeless the predicament was. I did this by tossing a hand grenade into the dis­ cussion so there would be no lingering doubts. Drawing on my most condescending tone, I replied, “Eh hem . . . only one of us has over two decades of mass communica­ tions experience . . .” I hit SEND and waited less than two minutes for the nuclear missile I knew would come back, which it did, in the form of a short email that began, “Well, Randy . . . . . . . . . . aren’t we special. I suggest you check your­ self before this entire event unravels.”\n\nThere was more to it that was even worse. I sat there looking at my computer screen thinking, “Whoa . . . , ” and ﬁgured that was 4\n\nIN T ROD U C T ION : W HY SC IEN C E N EEDS S TO RY\n\nenough. I didn’t reply. Instead I was breathing deeply as I headed out the door for a cooling-­off jog. I thought about what I was trying to do. These two guys were the sources of knowledge—­they were the ones who actually knew something truthful about the real world. I was this horrible agent of conformity wanting to reshape their words and information, to transform the real world into the narrative world. This same shaping process happened with the iconic quote from the Apollo 13 mission to the moon. The original words spoken by astronaut Jack Swigert in 1970 when an oxygen tank exploded on board were “Houston, we’ve had a problem here.” But 25 years later, when Tom Hanks delivered the line in the movie version of the events, the words were “Houston, we have a problem.” What changed and why? Two things. The Hollywood folks made the line more concise (fewer words) and they made it more compel­ ling (present tense makes it more urgent). I wanted to do this with the scientists—­keep things accurate yet make them conform better to the constraints of the narrative world in which we live. But this sort of text manipulation worries scientists. They want people to know how things are in the real world, and they dream of simply being able to “see it, say it.” They want to tell you the truth, exactly as they see it, without having to rearrange anything, because the rearranging process can be dangerous. Rearranging things comes with risks—­at the mildest just getting it wrong, at worst deceiving people. But the problem is, “see it, say it” doesn’t work. Not even in the world of science, as Nobel laureate P. B. Medawar ﬁrst addressed in the 1960s with his essay “Is the Scientiﬁc Paper a Fraud?” He ago­ nized over the transition that must take place, where scientists have to give in to a third step, ending up with “see it, shape it, say it.” This is what scientists do every day in the process of editing their scientiﬁc papers. Yet the strange thing is that, despite having made major conces­ sions over the past century to this need to shape things, scientists 5\n\nPART I\n\nstill have little awareness of it. Let me tell you about a little experi­ ment I’ve run to demonstrate this lack of awareness. IMRADical\n\nI like to ask a question of large audiences of scientists. I ask if they know the meaning of a certain acronym. The acronym underpins the narrative structure to which almost all scientiﬁc journals con­ form. It is a piece of knowledge that is as central to the lives of sci­ entists as the names on their driver’s licenses are to their daily lives. Speaking to a group of more than 800 scientists at the annual meeting of the American Society of Agronomy, I asked for a show of hands: “Who knows what this acronym means?” I then put up a slide that said simply “IMRAD.” No hands went up. I chuckled, pulled out my cell phone and took a photo of 800 pairs of unraised hands to document the moment for posterity (as well as for any disbelieving scientists, of which I’m sure there are plenty). Then I asked a second question: “How many of you have ever read a scientiﬁc paper that was broken into four sections labeled Introduction (I), Methods (M), Results (R), and (A) Discussion (D)?” By the time I reached the “R,” you could hear the chuckles and com­ ments of “Ah, ya got us!” They have all read hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of papers that conform to this structure. IMRAD, as I will tell later, was hammered out a century ago and eventually accepted as the standardized structure for how a scientiﬁc report is best presented. It is simple in form and essentially identical to the three-­act struc­ ture that is at the heart of virtually every movie or play written today. It is the structure of a story, which has a beginning (I), mid­ dle (M&R), and end (D). Yet there were no hands raised. And as if to show that it is the exception that proves the rule, it turned out there actually was one\n\n6\n\nIN T ROD U C T ION : W HY SC IEN C E N EEDS S TO RY\n\nFigure 1. The gradual adoption of the IMRAD Template in biomedicine. We all know today it was the deﬁnition of a good idea, and yet . . . look how long it took for the IMRAD form to be adopted completely in the four top medical journals (from Sollaci and Pereira 2004).\n\nhand, way to my left, that was raised, which I noticed only after the second question. Everyone on that side was pointing to him saying, “Here’s one!” I called on him. It was Josh Schimel, author of the popular book Writing Science Papers: How to Write Papers That Get Cited and Proposals That Get Funded.” He knew the acronym, of course—­his book has an entire section on it. But he was the only one. I did the same stunt with about 200 doctors and students at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. Same result. Zero hands raised. I’ve also run the acronym by all of my scientist friends. Nobody has ever heard it, even though there is an entire body of literature around things like the history of IMRAD, the power of IMRAD, the uniformity of IMRAD, and so on. I myself was a scientist for 20 years yet only learned in the past year that there is a formal label for this text structure. IMRAD: So What?\n\nOkay, big deal, so a bunch of scientists didn’t know the acronym that describes the structure of their papers—­knowing the IMRAD label is not necessary in order to use it. But what matters is what\n\n7\n\nPART I\n\nthis reﬂects. Science is a profession that is permeated with narra­ tive structure and process, yet scientists are so blind to the impor­ tance of narrative that they don’t even make use of this established label. If narrative were held up as important, all science courses from the ﬁrst day would say, “Our profession is so completely built around narrative dynamics, we even force scientists to comply with a nar­ rative template known as IMRAD, which you need to learn about.” They might even go on to say, “Narrative and story are pretty much the same thing, which means over a century ago scientists accepted that story is at the heart of their profession. Which means there is no reason for you to have any irrational fear of story.” (This last bit might help with the problem of “storyphobia” I discuss in chap­ ter 11.) But none of this happens. Now you might ask, “So what is at stake if the science world isn’t aware of how ubiquitous narrative is and how it works?” The answer is, everything. Problem 1: Exaggeration Nation\n\nI’m going to use the term “narrative deﬁciency” to refer to the general problem this book addresses: not enough comprehension of narrative and how it works. Narrative deﬁciency might not be much of a problem to a plumber or an air trafﬁc controller, but in science, narrative is everywhere. If you don’t understand narrative, you don’t fully understand science. Let’s look at how pervasive it is. Science consists of two major parts: the doing of science (research using the scientiﬁc method) and the dissemination of information about what was done (communication). Both suffer the conse­ quences of narrative deﬁciency. On the research side, there are only two outcomes to scientiﬁc studies. Either they produce positive results (we saw a pattern), or\n\n8\n\nIN T ROD U C T ION : W HY SC IEN C E N EEDS S TO RY\n\nthey produce null results (we didn’t see any pattern). The positive result is the same as telling a good story (we saw something!); the null result is equal to telling a boring story (sorry, we didn’t see any­thing, zzz . . .). The problem these days is that everyone wants to tell good stories while nobody wants to tell boring stories. The journals want to tell good stories, the scientists want to tell good stories, the outreach staff want to tell good stories, and the journalists want to tell good stories. It ends up being a conspiracy of good storytelling. Which can be bad. In 2014 Petroc Sumner and his colleagues demonstrated the seri­ ousness of this problem for health sciences. They examined biomed­ ical press releases from 20 major UK universities versus the pub­ lished research papers upon which the releases were based. They found that 40 percent of the press releases contained exaggerated advice, 33 percent contained exaggerated causal claims, and 36 per­ cent contained exaggerated inference. That’s a whole lot of exaggeration, leading to the telling of big­ ger and more exciting stories than what actually exist in the real world. This is bad news for science, which seeks to document the real world, regardless of how good the story. This is where I need to be clear on what I’m advocating with this book. It is essential that every scientist understand what makes for a good story. A lot of what I will be presenting will help you achieve that goal. But advocating this understanding is not the same as say­ ing you should necessarily tell only “good” stories. The problem of good storytelling run amok crops up in the form of what are called “false positives”—­seeing a pattern when there isn’t one. For example, let’s say you announce to the world that ice cream causes cancer when in fact it doesn’t (a false positive result). Such a report would probably put you on the front page of news­ papers everywhere. People would be excited—­the journal in which\n\n9\n\nPART I\n\nyou report it, the outreach folks at your university, the journal­ ists who shape your work into a form for the general public—­all revved up. It is enticing and will bolster your career. But what if it’s not true? What if it’s a false positive and ice cream doesn’t cause cancer? In contrast, if your study concludes from the start that ice cream does not cause cancer, about all you’ll get from the newspapers will be a big “duh.” This sounds silly, but it’s the state of the world in science today. The proliferation of false positives is anywhere from a signiﬁcant concern in some ﬁelds to out of control in others. Speciﬁcally, the ﬁeld of biomedical research knows it has serious problems. In 2013 John Ioannidis, MD, of Stanford University, who has become famous as the chronicler of the current false positive plague in the biomedical world, announced, “Most of the claimed statistically signiﬁcant effects in traditional medical research are false positives or substantially exaggerated.” Notice he didn’t say “some.” He said “most.” On a similar note, a prominent geneticist I spoke with recently said, “Pretty much all the papers published these days in Science and Nature in my ﬁeld are overstated.” Randy Schekman of the University of California, Berkeley, in his acceptance speech for his 2013 Nobel Prize, even went so far as to announce his own personal boycott of the top journals, say­ ing that he and members of his laboratory would no longer submit their papers to the three most important scientiﬁc journals, Science, Nature and Cell. He did this because he feels the criteria for acceptance has been based on “signiﬁcance” (how big is the story the paper tells?) rather than “soundness” (how well done is the research?). Is the proliferation of false positives a disaster? Probably not. But it is deﬁnitely a signiﬁcant problem and, according to every scien­ tist I spoke with in the writing of this book, one that is growing.\n\n10\n\nIN T ROD U C T ION : W HY SC IEN C E N EEDS S TO RY\n\nFurthermore, it has become increasingly clear that, at the same time scientists are reaching for big headlines, scientiﬁc journals are less interested in publishing research that doesn’t produce big headlines. In 2014 Annie Franco and colleagues published a paper in Science titled “Publication Bias in the Social Sciences: Unlocking the File Drawer.” They showed how extensive the discrimination against null papers is in at least one ﬁeld. They found that for the social sciences, null studies had a 40 percent lower chance of being accepted for publication, which in turn translated into a 60 percent lesser chance that the investigators would even bother sending them in to be published—­thus their reference to “the ﬁle drawer,” which is where so many null studies end up languishing. The bottom line is that positive studies tell big stories and get published; null studies tell small stories and have a hard time get­ ting published. This is all a function of narrative dynamics, mean­ ing how stories are told. It’s all the same thing. One would hope the world of science is accurate, but unfortu­ nately the scientiﬁc literature gets pulled away from accuracy by the allure of prominent positive results and discrimination against null results, both of which affect narrative dynamics. (By the way, note the second word in “scientiﬁc literature.”) Problem 2: Numbed Down\n\nFor the other half of science—­the communication of research ﬁndings both among scientists and to the general public—­the prob­ lems are age-­old. It’s the struggle of connecting with an increas­ ingly numbed populace. Scientists are famous for being bad com­ municators. I documented this in 2009 with my ﬁrst book, Don’t Be Such a Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style. I pointed out the difﬁculties of communicating information-­heavy material. The book was well received, along with several other similar books such as Am I Making Myself Clear? by Cornelia Dean, Escape from the Ivory\n\n11\n\nFI G U R E 2: T HE N A R R AT I V E S P E C T R UM\n\nPART I\n\nBORING\n\nINTERESTING\n\nNon-Narrative\n\nNarrative\n\nCONFUSING\n\nOverly Narrative\n\nFigure 2. The Narrative Spectrum. Too little narrative content, you’re boring; too much, you’re confusing. But there’s an optimum where you achieve the goal of effective communication.\n\nTower by Nancy Baron, and Unscientiﬁc America by Chris Mooney and Sheril Kirshenbaum. The general reception from the scientiﬁc community was a collective response of “We know, we’re working on it.” The costs of poor communication range from students getting bored with their science classes to the inability of the scientiﬁc com­ munity to deal with the growing antiscience movements for sub­ jects such as climate science, evolution and vaccination policy. More analytically, we can look at the communication problems in terms of narrative structure. Eventually I’m going to get into plenty of detail on this, but for now let me just offer it in simple terms. There is an optimum for narrative in communication. There is a certain amount of story complexity that is enough to be engaging, but not so much as to be confusing. It’s pretty much that simple. The same sort of optimum exists for Hollywood movies. Just look at a hugely successful recent movie like Gravity. The movie had one main character (Ryan Stone, portrayed by Sandra Bullock), one main incident (the debris cluster damaged her spacecraft), and one clear goal (to get home alive). It didn’t have 15 stories happening at once, but just the same, it deﬁnitely had one very good story hap­ pening. The basic elements were simple, but out of her simple pre­ dicament arose all sorts of story complexity. The same dynamic is ideal for both scientiﬁc research and science communication. Figure 2 shows this in terms of a spectrum. Some people don’t have enough narrative content in what they are saying and they\n\n12\n\nIN T ROD U C T ION : W HY SC IEN C E N EEDS S TO RY\n\nget boring. Other people are trying to tell you multiple stories at once and you can’t follow them, making them confusing. And then there are some people . . . they just have a sense for the right amount of narrative. That intuition in Hollywood is referred to as “story sense.” For our purposes, I’m calling it “narrative intuition.” Developing this intuition needs to be the ultimate objective for the science world. I titled the most important chapter of Don’t Be Such a Scientist “Don’t Be Such a Poor Storyteller.” I ended the book by pointing in the direction of narrative as the way to address these problems, but I had little speciﬁc advice because I had not done that much work on narrative myself. I followed that book by recruiting two veteran actor friends, Dorie Barton and Brian Palermo, to create a workshop to address this challenge. Over the next four years we taught our Connection Storymaker workshop to a variety of science and environmental organizations, eventually culminating in 2013 with our book Connection: Hollywood Storytelling Meets Critical Thinking. The work­ shops led me to the speciﬁc tools and advice I’m presenting here. My overall conclusion is that the world of science, although steeped in narrative, is largely oblivious to the power and impor­ tance of it. This needs to change. And I know who has the knowl­ edge to make the change possible. Hollywood: Savior of Science?\n\nRight now countless scientists are suppressing their gag reﬂex after reading this heading. You might be one of them. In general, Hollywood is anathema to science. Scientists hold the truth as their highest aspiration. Hollywood views the truth as an optional add-­on that can be fun if it’s convenient. Hollywood’s general attitude is reﬂected by one of the greatest screenwriters\n\n13\n\nPART I\n\nof today, Aaron Sorkin. Commenting on his movie The Social Network, he seemed to be speaking for the entire industry when he said, “I don’t want my ﬁdelity to be to the truth; I want it to be to storytelling.” That is so beautifully put. And I guarantee you it produces every­ thing from shivers to rage in scientists. Actor/director Ben Afﬂeck put a ﬁner (and even laughable) point on it when he defended his movie Argo, which was based on histori­ cal events, as having “a spirit of truth.” And that’s about where you completely lose the entire science community. There is no “spirit of truth.” Either something is true or it isn’t. Ah, Hollywood. I share some of this revulsion. I was a scientist. I still have 49 per­ cent of my brain that is programmed like a scientist’s. I feel their pain. And yet, there comes a time . . . Science now needs something that Hollywood has. It’s not the ability to make large glitzy action movies that use science to titillate while distorting all the good work of so many humble people. I have little use for those big dumb movies, and I don’t think the science world should hold out too much hope for them. I’m talking about something much deeper. Not the output of Hol­ lywood (what they produce) but rather the process (how they cre­ ate it). It’s the power of narrative. Hollywood is the place that has ﬁgured out how narrative works in the real world. Lots of humani­ ties scholars can babble on endlessly about their theories of narra­ tive, but most couldn’t spot the basic principles at work in our lives. It’s the people in Hollywood who have cracked the code of narrative over the past century, thanks to the driving force of ﬁnancial proﬁt. Science now needs their help. Think about it in Silence of the Lambs terms. Science, in the form of Agent Clarice Starling, needs to slowly, apprehensively walk down the long, dark basement hallway lined with maximum security prison cells. In the distance is Hollywood, in the form of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, locked up in his cell, glaring insanely through\n\n14\n\nIN T ROD U C T ION : W HY SC IEN C E N EEDS S TO RY\n\nhis mask, eyes twitching right and left. Clarice may despise Lecter, but the fact is, she needs his help. He has the knowledge. The time has come to set the prejudices aside—­the problems are now far more important than worrying about where the solutions come from. This is the conclusion I have come to at the end of a 40-­year jour­ ney. I began my professional life as a scientist. I achieved tenure as a professor of marine biology. But then I changed worlds. I moved to Hollywood, attended ﬁlm school, worked on movies, made movies, and eventually premiered my movies at the Telluride and Tribeca ﬁlm festivals, among others. The journey has led me to focus on the narrative problems of the science world. I ﬁrmly believe Hollywood holds the great knowl­ edge that science needs to master. It’s time to talk to Hannibal Lecter. Or if not him, then at least Eric Cartman. Eric Cartman to the Rescue?\n\nThe need to address the problem of narrative deﬁciency was my big revelation. And who exactly, you might ask, brought me around to this? The answer is simple—­Eric Cartman of the animated show South Park. Yes, it’s true. Actually, not Cartman himself but his co-­creator, Trey Parker. I, like millions of wise Americans, am a devoted fan of South Park. So in the fall of 2011, when Comedy Central ran an excellent half-­hour documentary about the making of the show, titled Six Days to Air, I tuned in. In the middle of the show there was a scene that changed my life. It was extraordinarily profound, and I believe it can transform the entire world of science. The scene featured Trey Parker talking about his technique for editing the ﬁrst draft of each show’s script. He said,\n\n15\n\nPART I\n\nI sort of always call it the rule of replacing and’s with either but’s or therefore. And so it’s always like, this happens, and then this hap­ pens, and then this happens—­whenever I can go back in the writ­ ing and change that to this happens, THEREFORE this happens, BUT this happens—­whenever you can exchange your and’s with but’s or therefore’s, it makes for better writing.\n\nHis words hit me like a bolt of lightning. So clear. So clean. I had never heard such a simple rule for storytelling. I wrote it down immediately. I’ve now spent three years researching it, going all the way back to Aristotle (Trey Parker didn’t invent the idea). I’ve given a TEDMED talk on it, published a letter in Science about it, and used it nonstop in my workshops. I’ve developed it into a simple one-­sentence, ﬁll-­in-­the-­blanks template called the ABT (meaning “And, But, Therefore”). The tem­ plate is this: _________ and _________, but _________, therefore _________.\n\nEvery story can be reduced to this single structure. I can tell you the story of a little girl living on a farm in Kansas AND her life is boring, BUT one day a tornado sweeps her away to the land of Oz, THEREFORE she must undertake a journey to ﬁnd her way home. That is the ABT at work. In a more practical way, a scientist could say, for example, “I can tell you that in my laboratory we study physiology AND biochem­ istry, BUT in recent years we’ve realized the important questions are at the molecular level, THEREFORE we are now investigating the following molecular questions . . .” That would be the narrative of that particular research program. You can do the same for whatever you are working on. The ABT is also a tool for creating an “elevator pitch” (a concise explanation of a project) in a way that draws on the power of narra­ tive structure. We will get into this in great detail in part 3. 16\n\nIN T ROD U C T ION : W HY SC IEN C E N EEDS S TO RY\n\nThe Hegelian Way\n\n“The ABT is the DNA of story.” That is what Park Howell, a profes­ sor who teaches storytelling in the business school at Arizona State University wrote to me recently. I believe this is correct and is not an exaggeration. The ABT really is that powerful and profound. But then guess what I discovered as soon as I started talking in terms of DNA. Two other authors think they’ve discovered the DNA of a similar skill—­argumentation—­in the form of their own template. In the enormously popular textbook They Say, I Say (it has sold over a million copies since publication in 2006), Gerald Graff and Cathy Birkenstein help you ﬁnd the structure of your argument using templates. They start with the simple idea of presenting what your opponents say ﬁrst, then what you have to say, before reconcil­ ing the two. At the start of their book they say, “The central rhetorical move that we focus on in this book is the ‘they say/I say’ template that represents the deep, underlying structure, the internal DNA as it were, of all effective argumentation.” There you have it—­t wo skills—­storytelling and argumentation. Traditionally they have been seen as polar opposites—­one has fun with the truth, the other tries to ﬁnd the truth. And yet, there is a similarity of structure. Look at the two templates—­the ABT and “they say, I say.” See any similarities? Both begin with the setup (a few facts in the ABT, what others say for argumentation), then establish a problem (using “but” in the ABT, telling what I have to say for argumentation), then the resolution of the two parts. It’s no coincidence that the templates are so similar. They are derived from what is really the true DNA of just about all interest­ ing thought. It’s called the Hegelian Triad or the Hegelian Dialectic. It was ﬁrst identiﬁed by Georg Hegel, the great philosopher of the late 1700s and early 1800s. It has three parts—­thesis, antithesis, 17\n\nPART I\n\nsynthesis—­just like these templates. It underpins pretty much every­ thing from logic to reasoning to argumentation to storytelling. And guess what it also underpins—­the scientiﬁc method. So there’s your real DNA. The Hegelian Triad is so powerful and universal that I’ve broken this book into the same three elements. My concern is the need for more awareness of narrative in the science world. I begin the book with “Thesis,” where I describe the state of the science world today with its deﬁcient awareness of nar­ rative despite the ubiquity of narrative within it. Then I present “Antithesis,” where I lay out a set of tools that could remedy this problem yet are not widely in use. Finally I pull it all together with “Synthesis,” where I tell of the effectiveness of the tools and offer up my prescription of Story Circles as a means of propagating this knowledge. I’ve also used another element of structuring. The ﬁrst and third sections (Thesis and Synthesis) follow the ABT Template. Together these give the book narrative structure at multiple levels—­just like a fractal pattern, which repeats itself at all scales (more to come on this). In fact, I like to say that the three letters should also stand for “Always Be Telling stories.” We’ll get much deeper into that, but let me now say the same thing in a different, perhaps more shocking, way . . . Science Needs to Emulate Trey Parker\n\nNow you’re thinking I’ve totally lost my mind. I’m recommending the entire science world become more like Trey Parker. How in the world can I be saying this? Have my years of living and working in Hollywood made me into one of the lunatics in the asylum? Possi­ bly. But ﬁrst, hear me out. In Don’t Be Such a Scientist I looked at knowledge in terms of the cerebral versus the visceral. Academia with all its information is the place for the cerebral, while Hollywood—­the land of emo­\n\n18\n\nFIGURE 3: CE R E BR A L VERSU S VISC ERA L IN T ROD U C T ION : W HY SC IEN C E N EEDS S TO RY\n\nCEREBRAL\n\nInformational, Literal, Analytical, Scientific, Academic\n\nVISCERAL\n\nFeeling, Non-literal, Intuitive, Artistic, Hollywood\n\nFigure 3. Cerebral versus visceral. Academia is the master of the cerebral, but Hollywood wins when it comes to the visceral. For success with narrative, you need both.\n\ntion—­is more about the visceral. College professors are masters of the cerebral but not that great when it comes to the visceral. Holly­ wood is the opposite—­populated by plenty of bean brains but own­ ing the visceral end of the spectrum, able to arouse the masses like no other force. So let’s look at Trey Parker. When it comes to storytelling, he is a 500-­pound visceral gorilla. He has no graduate degrees. He’s no scholar (and I’m sure he would be the ﬁrst to admit this). He got his undergraduate degree at the University of Colorado then moved to the “storytelling gym” (Hollywood) and began lifting storytelling weights nonstop, day in and day out. He put the burn on his storytelling biceps, starting in 1997, by telling stories, week after week, which had to work. He wasn’t given the basic academic luxury of living a life of three options (yes, no or later). He and Matt Stone were put into the pressure cooker of story­ telling with their animated series South Park—­either ﬁgure out how to tell stories that work, or fail and go home. Do or die. By 2011, when they shot the Comedy Central documentary, Parker had become narratively muscle-­bound. South Park was by then the greatest hit in the history of Comedy Central, and Parker and Stone’s musical, The Book of Mormon, had taken Broadway by\n\n19\n\nPART I\n\nstorm, winning nine Tony Awards. Parker’s brain had become buff with narrative muscle. With that strength he was able to distill much of the whole story development process down to his simple rule of replacing and’s with but’s and therefore’s (which, as I will explain later, he picked up in college and which probably originated with one of the greatest screenwriting instructors of all time). The Goals: Narrative Intuition and Narrative Culture\n\nTrey Parker and many of my USC ﬁlm school classmates possess what scientists need—­narrative intuition. Narrative intuition is the ability not just to know the basic rules of narrative but to have absorbed and assimilated them so thoroughly you can actually sense them. In essence, to be like Trey Parker. I have seen narrative intuition in action over the years with vet­ eran screenwriters. They have two abilities. First, they can create stories that are concise and compelling, and second, they can listen to stories that are not concise and compelling and quickly ﬁgure out how to ﬁx them. They have an ability to hear a story and immedi­ ately pinpoint why the story is boring or confusing. If scientists had this trait at a deep level, it would enable them to ﬁx or avoid many if not most of the problems I identiﬁed earlier. They would be more sensitized to the dark sides of storytelling. They would be less inclined to unknowingly make the mistake of false positives. If they understood and prioritized narrative, they would reduce the publication bias against null results. And if they had an intuitive feel for narrative, they would write and speak in a manner that was less boring, and not as frequently confusing. It is the change that is needed for the entire profession. No, narrative intuition is not a panacea (always, the science-­minded will set to work picking holes in any proposition by taking it to the extreme), but it is a means of addressing a source of many problems.\n\n20\n\nIN T ROD U C T ION : W HY SC IEN C E N EEDS S TO RY\n\nNarrative is incredibly powerful, not just as a tool for the work­ place but for making sense of the world. My purpose for writing this book is to urge scientists to put narrative on the score sheet. It should be one, if not the highest, priority for all science programs and agendas. Achieving this intuition in a profession that is so steeped in nar­ rative is the only long-­term hope for combatting the problems fac­ ing scientiﬁc research and science communication. Instruction in narrative dynamics needs to happen at all levels, and especially at the very beginning of science education, so that recognizing and creating narrative can become intuitive. If multiple individuals within an organization achieve narrative intuition, a “narrative culture” can develop. This culture can estab­ lish expectations and standards for a minimum level of narrative quality. Norms can change when everyone is expected to have a certain level of familiarity and competence with narrative dynam­ ics. Once this happens, the secondary effect of “entrainment”—­ where people are swept along with the ﬂow—­can occur, making the new norms self-­perpetuating. This is not an unrealistic hope. The necessary tools are in this book. It’s just a matter of embarking on the mission to make it hap­ pen, so let’s get going. The journey starts now.\n\n21\n\nAren’t We Special\n\nAh, email. The crazy thing about it is there’s no inﬂection. At least with handwritten communication the writer can bear down, draw the letters erratically, and add underscores and scribbles to convey rage or affection. But with email, there’s nothing but electronic letters and maybe a few annoying emoticons. The result is often the worst possible interpretation. Such was the case as I headed out the door for my “cooling-­ off jog” after receiving the shocking email that opened with, “Well, Randy . . . aren’t we special.” I read the worst possible sentiments into it. Actually, it was kind of hard not to, given the buildup. The next morning I called Megan, poured out a string of heartfelt apologies, then said I was withdrawing from the event. I told her how much respect I have for the two scientists and how I never wanted to get into such a war of words. She not only accepted my withdrawal, she overrode my apologies with her own, saying she had no idea how personal this stuff could get. She originally thought they would be thrilled to have my assistance. It never dawned on her it would turn so hurtful, but now that things had gone wrong she understood my decision.\n\n24\n\nT HESIS\n\nWe reached the end of our apologies, she accepted my withdrawal, and I was in that ﬁnal singsong stage you enter as a phone call is wrapping up. But then an email appeared in my inbox from one of the two scientists. I read it aloud to her. He and the other scientist had talked the night before. He said, “We decided we’re senior enough and we’ve given enough successful presentations that we can afford one complete debacle, so we’re gonna go ahead and roll with your crazy ideas—­nothing ventured, nothing gained.” Well . . . . . . . . . . aren’t we really special. Deep inside I knew these two guys were amazing and that’s why I had offered to withdraw—­you don’t want to end up in disagreements with people you have such respect for. So I was instantly psyched. I uncanceled things with Megan and within minutes was on a Skype chat with him. Houston, we had lift-­off. Whew. And now we’re ready for lift-­off in our journey into the world of narrative, so let me begin by introducing your host, me, in a little more depth. I have a unique background that is central to my message. I spent half my career as a scientist, the other half as a ﬁlmmaker. I am bilingual in the languages of “academic science” and “working Hollywood.” So here I am. Randysseus\n\nPeople like to have fun with my ﬁrst name, calling me everything from Rrrrranders to Randymon, Randosius, Randcho, Randango, Randitola, the Rand Man, and . . . you get the idea. I think it’s a pretty dumb name, more ﬁtting of the Randy character on South Park, but what can you do? So now I am presenting my own version of my name, which is Randysseus. I offer this name because I, much like the legendary ﬁgure Odysseus (well, okay, not that much, in fact hardly at all, but\n\n25\n\nPART II\n\nroll with me on this one), have been a sojourner of great distances. At least psychologically. I lived my early life as a scientist. I earned my PhD in biology at Harvard, spent a year living on an island on the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, went diving under the ice in Antarctica, dove a half-­ mile down into the deep sea, lived in an undersea habitat at a depth of 60 feet for a week, and did pretty much every other exciting and interesting thing in the ocean I ever yearned to do. Eventually I became a professor of marine biology, I had graduate students, scored major research grants including a signiﬁcant one from the National Science Foundation, published 20 peer-­reviewed research papers including one in Nature, and ﬁnally was awarded tenure at the University of New Hampshire. All of which meant I had succeeded as a scientist and was set for life. I had hit that point most academics dream of where you have achieved a “guaranteed job” no matter what happens to you (short of major felony charges—­ about the only thing that will get you ﬁred from a tenured position). BUT then . . . (now the actual story begins—­a key point of structure, as we’ll discuss in detail later) I departed from the comfort of my Ordinary World (another term to come) and set out on a journey (which is what a story is—­ah, so much for us to cover!). From the Land of Science in the East, I headed west to California. It was 1994. Things were primitive in America—­Friendster, Auto-­ Tune and Crocs had yet to be invented. As much as I loved doing science, I had developed an even greater interest in the communication of science. I resigned from my professorship with a big vision in mind. I fully intended to return one day to the world of science and share what I had learned. I let my friends have fun viewing this as an impulsive move. Rumors went around of my having had an identity crisis or a psychological meltdown. A friend sent me a cartoon of two middle-­ aged men at a bus stop, one dressed as a pirate, the other dressed as a cowboy and saying, “Midlife crisis?” as the ﬁrst nods in agreement.\n\n26\n\nT HESIS\n\nFigure 4. Hollywood agent cyclops.\n\nBut my closest friends knew I had a clear purpose and would return some day. Feeling like Odysseus, I set out for the Sea of Hollywood, ready to confront the Cyclops agents and lawyers, hoping to avoid being seduced by the Lotus Eaters of Malibu and of course determined to steer clear of the Sirens that lurk at every nightclub and Hollywood party. Just like Odysseus, I pulled it off—­nobody destroyed me. I survived it all and I, Randysseus, am now returning to the science world—­back from my 20-­year journey (twice as long as Odysseus!)\n\n27\n\nPART II\n\nand ready to share the knowledge gained. And here’s one of my ﬁrst realizations in looking at the world of science from outside . . . Scientists Love Complexity\n\nStory dynamics, which thrive on simplicity, don’t mesh well with science, where complexity is the norm. I know this well from my cross-­cultural journey. I have experienced the challenges ﬁrsthand. In Don’t Be Such a Scientist, I shared a number of classic moments where my “scienceness” stuck out in Hollywood in comically embarrassing ways. Here’s one I left out—­yet another tale from my early days in Hollywood, the former professor of marine biology making his way in Tinseltown. This particular story brings to life the complexity/simplicity divide. At USC ﬁlm school I was chosen for one of the four director positions in my class. I was given the equivalent of a $50,000 budget to make a short ﬁlm from a script I had written for a wild and outlandish musical comedy. It was the story of a woman in law school who gets electrocuted in her kitchen while angrily making dinner for her husband and his business partners the night before her big law exam. Her ghost comes back for revenge in the ﬁnal scene, teaming up with the secretaries from her husband’s ofﬁce to perform a song-­and-­dance number about castration. Sufﬁce it to say, the ﬁlm was a little out of the ordinary in the reﬁned atmosphere of the USC School of Cinematic Arts. (I was eventually accused of being a misogynist, even though the guy got the punishment—­such are the politics of ﬁlm school.) For the dance scenes I managed to recruit a wonderful choreographer named Lance MacDonald who, the next year, became the assistant choreographer on a little movie called Titanic. On our ﬁrst day working together, I showed him a set of diagrams of the dance scenes I had diligently created.\n\n28\n\nT HESIS\n\nThey looked like football plays as I laid them out on a table for Lance to examine. The diagrams were ﬁlled with X’s and O’s for the dancers, with arrows for who should go where at each moment, then a bunch of V’s that marked where the camera should be placed at different points along the way. The diagrams looked so precisely drawn, and yet . . . I didn’t know the ﬁrst thing about choreography, and it had only been a year and a half since I was a scientist laboring away in a laboratory. The diagrams were the picture of an analytical mind at work. Lance studied them for a while in fascination. Then he got up, picked up the diagrams and walked to the other side of the room saying, “Wow, these are really, really great—­I’m so impressed with the work you’ve done,” as he dropped them into a trash can. “But we won’t be needing them—­you’ll see.” I was stunned, but with time I came to realize what he meant. Stupid me. Stupid, stupid me. The scientist, mired in his complex, complicated charts, thinking I could plan out every detail. I would come to learn that choreography is about art, and at the core of art is simplicity. Lance set to work, hiring the dancers, beginning rehearsals in a studio, and then after a couple weeks he invited the cameraman to a session for the next step. He ran the dancers through their moves. He had them freeze at various moments while he and the cameraman looked at them from all angles and ﬁgured out where they would put the camera. Instead of having them dance for the camera, he had them dance for themselves while the camera documented it. And I just sat and observed—­the misguided novice. Had I insisted on forcing my diagrams on the production, we would have had a clunky mess of dancers bumping into each other and trying to ﬁnd their way to key points at exact times to line up with the camera angles. Instead Lance produced a smooth, ﬂowing, organic, fun performance that ended up being shot ﬂawlessly. So simple. So perfect. So sophisticated.\n\n29\n\nPART II\n\nIt was the embodiment of a famous quote usually attributed to Da Vinci . . . “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”\n\nI tell this little tale because it strikes at the heart of this book. It also gets at what I think is the problem with a lot of today’s books and workshops addressing this suddenly ubiquitous topic of story and storytelling. Most of them are as mired in complexity as I was with my diagrams. I see books that are packed with charts and graphs and section after section about protagonists, antagonists, sequences, culminations, narrative arcs, tropes, themes and . . . it’s all so exciting and stimulating with the complexity, but in the end, is it effective and necessary? That’s the problem with complexity. It can be so overstimulating that the net result is zero, as the recipient can’t ever lock onto one thing to retain. It’s like standing on a cliff above a city, taking in the stunning view. It may be magniﬁcent, but you will probably walk away with little to say other than, “Wow, that was awesome!” You saw it all but retained virtually nothing. In contrast, I take a sort of fractal approach to the entire concept of story. At the core of fractal design is the basic idea that “out of simplicity can arise complexity.” It’s just like an ice crystal, which looks amazingly complicated at ﬁrst glance, but on closer inspection is just a single pattern that has been replicated over and over. A pattern like the ABT. I ﬁrmly believe this is the case for all storytelling, and I’m not alone. John Yorke, in his wonderful book Into the Woods: How Stories Work and Why We Tell Them, addresses the fractal nature of stories in detail. He writes, “Stories are built from acts, acts are built from scenes and scenes are built from even smaller units called beats. All these units are constructed in three parts: fractal versions of the\n\n30\n\nT HESIS\n\nthree-­act whole.” Out of that singular, simple structure can arise endless complexity. Complexity is fun, exciting, and stimulating and can be nonrepetitive, which is a central element of entertainment. But I am advocating for simplicity—­just a few basic tools, used over and over again as you develop an intuitive feel for how narrative works. If your attention span is so short that you can’t bear the thought of repeated actions, then I’m not sure you’re ever going to develop much of a feel for narrative. Narrative is about simplicity and repetition. I will come back to this theme repeatedly. Scientists like to attack things for being “dumbed down,” which is at times a fair criticism, but you can’t afford to let “dumbed down” get confused with simplicity. There is a difference. As Da Vinci pointed out, simplicity is about sophistication. Now let’s begin considering the world of science, and the larger world of narrative into which it arose.\n\n31\n\n1 Science is stuck living in a narrative world . . . The Long History of Narrative: Gilgawho?\n\nRaise your hand if you know who Gilgamesh was. This is another demonstration I do with groups of scientists, and again, I’m no better than any of them. I had no clue who Gilgamesh was until a few months ago when I began writing this book—­such are the holes in my humanities education. Gilgamesh is pretty much where the entire concept of narrative begins. His story is humanity’s ﬁrst story, and is the birth of literature. He was a great and mighty leader 4,000 years ago who supposedly ruled Mesopotamia for 126 years. Early storytellers carved his epic tale on stone tablets. After Gilgamesh, the rest is literally history as we became a “storytelling animal,” which happens to be the title of a nice book by Jonathan Gottschall published in 2013. Gottschall makes the point that story (or narrative if you prefer) pervades every aspect of our lives today. From Gilgamesh we jump 2,000 years to the next major story milestone, namely, Aristotle and the Greeks. Aristotle realized that stories have a distinct structure. In the Poetics he talked about the structure of plays and stories. He broke them into ﬁve basic parts. The opening he called prologue, the ending he called exodus,\n\n33\n\nF I GURE 5: DUD E , IT’S AL L THE SAME STO RY C HAPT ER 1\n\nDRAMA\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nEXODUS\n\nTENSION\n\nREPEATED: PAR ADOS-EPISODE-STASIMON\n\nSCIENCE\n\nPOSING THE QUESTION\n\nDISCUSSION REPEATED: HYPOTHESIS-EXPERIMENT-RESULTS\n\nFigure 5. Dude, it’s all the same story. The top diagram is how Aristotle, 2,000 years ago, described the structure of a story. The bottom diagram is how a scientist conducts a research project. See any similarity?\n\nTIME\n\nand in the middle he described a series of repeating cycles, each consisting of three parts—­parados, episode and stasimon. Even today, when we think of a story, we often talk about the middle part being “episodic.” Now here is the major revelation in thinking about storytelling in science. What are the major parts of a scientiﬁc project? You start by gathering background knowledge (introduction), then you repeat cycles of posing and testing hypotheses (methods and results), until ﬁnally you discover an answer. At that point you pull it all together with a discussion. Take a look at those two structures side by side in ﬁgure 5. This is the ﬁrst example of the point I will hit on repeatedly: “Dude, it’s all the same story”—­which is what my Connection coauthor Dorie\n\n34\n\nSC IEN C E IS ST U C K IN A N ARRAT IV E W O R LD . . .\n\nBarton began saying to me in our workshops as we discussed story structure. Initially the scientist in me bristled at this suggestion—­ surely there are many, many types of stories. But these days I ﬁnd myself pretty much in agreement with her and hope you will as well. This stuff really does come down to the same core structure. The structure that underpins a story, of course, radiated into all sorts of variations over time. There are so many seemingly different types of stories—­romance, horror, comedy, fantasy and more. If you choose to do so you can get lost in the inﬁnite complexity of them. Similarly, you can get lost in the inﬁnite complexity of biological diversity—­marveling at everything from the bizarre shape of a guitarﬁsh to the roiling, hydra-­like living ball of spaghetti that is a basket starﬁsh. You can sit there and marvel, saying, “Wow, each creature is so different from the next—­there is so much complexity in the various species of life!” And yet . . . dude, at the core, their DNA is telling the same story. Their genomes track back to the same original primal sequences of base pairs. You can choose to focus on the mesmerizing complexity, or you can seek the simplicity at the center of it all. Finding the simple core allows you to say, “I see how all these various forms branched off from the one original type.” The former is exciting but ultimately directionless. The latter makes sense of the world. It’s the same with stories—­all variations track back to a common heritage. This is what anthropologist Joseph Campbell realized in the ﬁrst half of the last century. He brought an analytical perspective—­essentially the mind of a scientist—­to the traditionally nonanalytical world of storytelling. Just as an evolutionary biologist looks for common descent among organisms, he looked for common structure among stories told by different cultures and religions around the world. In 1949 he wrote his landmark book The Hero with a Thousand Faces, which he opened by saying, “There are of course differences between the numerous mythologies and religions of mankind, but\n\n35\n\nC HAPT ER 1\n\nthis is a book about the similarities.” That was the prelude to his eventual message: “Dude, it’s all the same story.” Campbell saw a single, common structure underlying storytelling around the world. He named this structure the monomyth. And guess how many major parts there are to it—­three. Beginning, middle, end. Just as Hegel would have predicted. Speaking of the number three, guess what else emerged over the centuries in the world of storytelling—­the basic structure of plays, novels and eventually movies known as the three-­act structure. Today it is at the core of just about every movie you watch—­the same tripartite structure, deeply embedded in the programming of the brain. So deep that you can’t escape it. The Short History of Science\n\nNow it’s time to think about the history of science. If we know humans have been telling written stories for at least 4,000 years, how long have we been writing scientiﬁc papers? The answer is less than 10 percent of that—­or about 400 years. There were scientists long ago. There was Ptolemy in Egypt just 100 years after the time of Christ and the amazing Ibn al-­Haytham (nicknamed Ptolemy the Second) in Mesopotamia who, almost 1,000 years later, pioneered optics and experimental physics. But the reporting of scientiﬁc research in formal journals began in 1665 with the ﬁrst volume of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. The early reports of scientiﬁc research were written very much in the “literary” style—­not broken into sections, but more of a single essay, often written in the third person, along the lines of “Recently Robert Boyle conducted a demonstration in which he . . .” Within 50 years the articles moved from largely descriptive pieces to a form that was beginning to take the shape of reports of experiments written by the investigator. By the late 1800s a clear structure had emerged around the pattern of theory, experi-\n\n36\n\n4000 years ago\n\nGilgamesh\n\n2000 years ago\n\nPresent\n\n1000 years ago\n\nRenaissance\n\nAristotle\n\nIMRAD\n\nSCIENCE\n\nTrans.

The humanities are at least 4,000 years old. Science is a much more recent arrival.\n\nment, discussion (hmm . . . three parts, what a coincidence). This eventually gave way in the 1900s to the almost universally agreed upon scientiﬁc paper template of today that I mentioned back at the start—­the mighty IMRAD. (Please tell me you will never forget that term from here on.) And though there are four sections to the IMRAD, the Methods and Results sections are often combined, reﬂecting the fact they are, after all, just the middle of the story. Science is a newly arrived guest in an ancient narrative world. This is the challenge scientists face. Scientists might dream of communicating in a nonnarrative form, where all you do is list information, but ultimately that doesn’t work. As I pointed out with the “see it, say it” conundrum, it just isn’t that easy. Let me take this a little deeper. The Programming of the Brain Is Defective\n\nPeople can listen to a few facts, but not many. After a while their narrative need kicks in. You can give a lecture that is pure information with no narrative structure, and a nontechnical audience might be able to endure a half-­hour or so before walking out, but that same audience will listen to hours and hours of good stories.\n\n37\n\nFIGURE 7: THE HUM AN B RAI N C HAPT ER 1\n\nNfGthis: I N R WA ming o d. ram P ro g n is fl awe o rga\n\nFigure 7. The human brain. If it were for sale it would have been recalled by now.\n\nYou could show them a Breaking Bad marathon, and they would have no trouble sitting through lots of episodes. Such is the power of narrative. So that’s your ﬁrst “faulty programming” aspect of the brain. Scientists wish they could just pour out facts, untouched, for consumption. But they can’t. The brain needs information packaged in speciﬁc ways. This leads to all sorts of distortions that can confound even the best intentions. New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof points this out quite clearly in a classic article that I encourage my workshop participants to read over and over again. Nicholas Kristof Warns the World about Storytelling\n\nNicholas Kristof is a two-­time Pulitzer Prize winner who wrote an amazingly short, simple (my favorite attribute!) and broadly practical article about the power of story in mass communication. I’m not sure he would approve of my calling his article an essay full of warnings about storytelling, but that’s pretty much what it is. The somewhat surprising thing about the article is that he published it, not in an academic journal or as a New York Times feature,\n\n38\n\nSC IEN C E IS ST U C K IN A N ARRAT IV E W O R LD . . .\n\nbut in the November 2009 issue of Outside. The title, very ﬁttingly, is “Nicholas Kristof ’s Advice for Saving the World.” If I were to summarize the message of the article in one sentence, I would say, “You should realize how faulty the programming of the human brain is before you set about trying to alter other people’s brains.” His point is that communication is not about telling people what you think they need to hear or know; it’s about ﬁguring out your goals then working backward, mindful of how the brain works, to successfully convey your message. You need to shape your information into the right form for it to work properly when it enters people’s brains. Another way to say this is by dismissing the Golden Rule. I was raised in Kansas with the charge “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” Kristof ’s point is, who cares how you want people to do unto you? What you need to ﬁgure out is how people want to be done unto, then work within those constraints. This is a fundamental problem scientists run into. When they can’t ﬁgure out why people aren’t interested in what they have to say, they get frustrated. They say things like “people need to know this” as they talk about things like the need for greater “science literacy.” Of course I agree with their intentions, but before you get angry at “people,” you really need to have a basic understanding of how people think. Singularity: The Power of Storytelling Rests in the Speciﬁcs\n\nThe most important dynamic Kristof presents, in all its frustrating injustice, is the “power of one” in storytelling, or what we could call the power of the singular narrative. Here’s basically (in my paraphrasing) what he says: If I tell you the story of one little girl in Africa who is going to die next year from a disease, you are going to get upset by exactly X number of “units of upset.” But if I tell you the\n\n39\n\nC HAPT ER 1\n\nstory of two little girls in Africa who will die from the disease next year, wouldn’t you think you would get twice as upset? That’s twice as many people who are going to die. Think of all the pain you will feel for the ﬁrst girl’s family. Then think about that same pain for the second girl’s family. One plus one should equal two, right? It makes sense that you would get twice as upset. But you already know that’s not the case. How could it be? You would run out of upset units pretty quickly as the number of victims grows. This is the sad, illogical, counterintuitive, even dangerous nature of storytelling. Kristof points to the famous saying that “the death of one individual is a tragedy, the death of a million is a statistic.” Therein lies the frustration for scientists—­how can it not be as simple as just numbers? A million is so much greater a number than one. Isn’t it the same as “sample size,” which you always want to maximize? I’m sorry, but it just isn’t about the numbers alone. People care about things that move them, touch them, reach inside them, connect with them—­all of those things. The story of one person can do all that to you, very powerfully. But it’s harder for ﬁve people to do it to you, really hard for one hundred, and for a million . . . the people just become a statistic from which you are detached. Which is kind of like what I was saying about taking in the view of a city—­so much, and yet so little that will last. This is a core principle of narrative that you need to commit to heart, and even if you do, you’ll still probably make mistakes with it at times. If you don’t grasp it, you will be one of those speakers who talks about the 18 different things going on in your lab, all of which you feel passionate about but none of which end up making enough impact for anyone to remember the next day. It’s the “less is more” thing. And it’s really, really hard for scientists to grasp. How do I know? Because I used to be a scientist, and\n\n40\n\nSC IEN C E IS ST U C K IN A N ARRAT IV E W O R LD . . .\n\nI gave the sort of talks that involved 73 slides in 12 minutes. And in fact I still do it sometimes—­what can I say, the wiring of my brain is faulty. But at least I’ve developed a little bit of awareness. So I present this just to make the initial point that narrative dynamics can be ﬁckle. And dangerous. And underlying this is one of the most important rules in narrative, which is that the power of storytelling rests in the speciﬁcs. A story that lacks speciﬁcs is not powerful. Politicians often give boring speeches because they don’t want to get locked into speciﬁcs if they get elected. They say, “If you elect me I will improve our community.” The crowd asks how. The politician replies, “In all the ways it needs improvement.” The crowd gets bored. They need speciﬁcs to stay interested. If you think about this phenomenon, you see how it applies here. The quantity of one is as speciﬁc as things get. Two is less speciﬁc. One is where the power is at a maximum. And guess what this rule also reﬂects—­simplicity. The story of one person is simpler than the story of two people. “People like a simple story.” You hear this refrain all the time and it’s true in many ways. It’s very frustrating to people who want to communicate the truth, which can be complex, but it’s what works. And that becomes the challenge—­communicating complicated things in simple ways. Think of what this means. If you go to Africa and get to know three little girls in a village who are dying from a disease and you want to motivate people in America to donate money to save them, your ﬁrst instinct might be to tell the more complicated story of all three little girls. It’s only natural that you’ll want to be “inclusive” and mention all three in equal measure. But the sad truth is, if you really want to help them all, you should pick one and tell her singular story in as much depth, power and detail as possible. You will have a higher chance of actually motivating people. All three\n\n41\n\nC HAPT ER 1\n\nwill beneﬁt the most by your making that decision, as difﬁcult as it might be. Please note, I am not advocating that you present the research project you conducted with three colleagues as just your story alone. Sometimes it doesn’t matter that the story of just one person is more compelling to the broad audience—­you don’t want to cheat your colleagues. The only thing I am saying is, it’s crucial that you understand these fundamental narrative dynamics and use them to your advantage when appropriate. Telling a simple story can be frustrating, but it may be the single most important challenge for all scientists. The tendency of scientists to present endless piles of facts, unable to ﬁnd the singular narrative on which everyone can focus, has been a reason many important science stories, including that of global warming, fail to resonate with the public. Why So Keen on Narrative?\n\nSo what’s the big deal about narrative? Why is everyone talking about it? Let me address the power of narrative more scientiﬁcally by looking at how it works and why it is so beneﬁcial. Just as one small but robust example, let’s take a look at a neurophysiology project addressing the effects of narrative. In 2008, Uri Hasson and colleagues developed the ﬁeld of neurocinematics. They used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the brain activity of people viewing ﬁlm clips with and without narrative structure. Now let me make clear, I am skeptical about today’s popular neurophysiology stories. I loved Adam Gopnik’s 2013 New Yorker article, “Mindless: The New Neuro-­skeptics,” and I’m a fan of the British blog Neurobollocks: Debunking Pseudo-­Neuroscience So You Don’t Have To, which hits the same notes of skepticism. In light of this, I was\n\n42\n\nSC IEN C E IS ST U C K IN A N ARRAT IV E W O R LD . . .\n\nimpressed that when I spoke with Hasson about his work, he was quick to emphasize its limitations. I tried to ask whether they had measured brain response to all kinds of tiny subtleties. He shuddered and warned me repeatedly about the limitations of fMRI. What I’m presenting of his work here is, as you will see, pretty simple in terms of interpretation. Hasson’s group looked at narrative structure as being the same sort of continuum I laid out in the introduction. At one end of the continuum are clips from suspense ﬁlms by Alfred Hitchcock (highly narrative). At the other end are clips of people walking idly around Washington Square Park (nonnarrative). The fMRI reveals two main things: 1. ��������� ��������� ��� �����. People watching narrative clips had much greater overall brain activity than those watching nonnarrative clips. 2. ��������� ������� ��� �������� �� � �����. Yes, I know “group think” can be a bad thing, but this effect is not the same as group think. When a group of individuals are being told the same story and it has a strong narrative, their brains will show similar patterns of activity. When people watch clips with strong narrative (Hitchcock), the pattern of brain activity from one individual to the next is much more similar than when there is little narrative (Washington Square Park). Hasson’s group calculated an index of similarity (termed Inter-­Subject Correlation, or ISC) across subjects and found an ISC of 70 percent for narrative results versus 10–­20 percent for nonnarrative.\n\nNone of this is particularly surprising. All you have to do is look at the audience during a suspenseful movie scene—­say, a man has a gun pointed at him. Pretty much everyone is thinking the same thought: “Is he going to get shot?” In contrast, if you show people\n\n43\n\nC HAPT ER 1\n\nFigure 8. Neurocinematics. Using fMRI, Hasson and colleagues record the brain activity of subjects viewing ﬁlm clips that have strong narrative structure (such as a suspenseful scene from an Alfred Hitchcock ﬁlm) and no narrative structure (people wandering aimlessly in Washington Square Park). Their index of similarity in brain activity across viewers (termed Inter-­Subject Correlation, or ISC) shows that strong narrative content results in much greater similarity in brain activity across individuals. Used with permission.\n\nnonnarrative clips, their minds will start to wander. What this means is that everyone walks away from the Hitchcock scene thinking the guy is going to get shot, but people viewing the Washington Square Park footage will have much more varied experiences—­ some saying the clip was about pigeons, others saying it was about people sitting on park benches, and so on. This then becomes a signiﬁcant distinction between when and where you use the power of narrative in the writing of a scientiﬁc paper. Science advances through the hypothetico-­deductive approach. Once the data are in and you have presented them to us,\n\n44\n\nSC IEN C E IS ST U C K IN A N ARRAT IV E W O R LD . . .\n\nyour audience, for our own interpretation, we do indeed look to you to draw on all your experience and knowledge to tell us what you think it all means. That’s the entire idea of “discussion.” For effective communication, what you want is focus—­everyone thinking the same thoughts and presumably using large amounts of their brains. (We’re going to assume the amount of the brain that is active is proportional to the quality of thinking.) Such is the power of narrative: it enables you to pull everyone together. And that, of course, is what clear and obvious problems do—­they unify people in their thinking. The United States of Problem Solvers\n\nHow unifying is narrative? Just look at World War II—­perhaps the greatest unifying exercise in the history of humanity. Everyone in the United States faced the same problem—­how to win World War II. Everyone joined together with every ounce of their strength and eventually succeeded. Most of those people ended up with one thing in common after the war—­it turned out to be the most important experience of their lives. This is the subject of the classic book The Good War, by Studs Terkel, winner of the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for nonﬁction. Terkel tells all about how WWII was the most meaningful experience in the lives of an entire generation. Even people who never came close to the war—­who spent the war working in a bakery—­during those years felt their job baking bread was important as part of the overall war effort. Once the problem was solved (the war was won), most of them said their lives never again felt as meaningful. (Note: keep this term meaningful in mind for later when we get to the Dobzhansky Template.) Recognizing the problem-­solution dynamic at the core of narrative is the starting point for many people who come to me with stories they can’t make work. I begin by just asking, “What’s\n\n45\n\nC HAPT ER 1\n\nthe problem at the core of this material?” And they reply, “Well, we’re wanting to tell the public about our wetlands management program.” And I say, “Right, so what’s the problem at the center of your program?” And they reply, “We’ve destroyed too much of our wetlands.” And I say, “There you go, we’re starting to get somewhere. You’ve identiﬁed a central problem that you’re trying to solve: How do we stop destroying so much of our wetlands? Now you can tell a story around that problem.” Storytelling is about identifying the problem being addressed. It’s about knowing Scarlett O’Hara’s problem at Tara, Rick Blaine’s problem in Casablanca, E.T.’s problem on Earth, Luke Sky­ walker’s problem in a galaxy far, far away. On and on and on. It’s all about prob­lems and solutions, which is what science is also about, so you’d think scientists would be better with narrative. Why aren’t they? Sprinting Past the Humanities\n\nAs a scientist I never quite knew what I had missed in my education, but when I left the comfort of the Biology Department at the University of New Hampshire and moved to the intensely narrative world of Hollywood, it became clear what had happened. I thought I knew so much as a tenured professor. I fully expected Hollywood to be challenging, but I wasn’t aware of how much my sprint to become a scientist had left me ill-­equipped to deal with other aspects of life. It took only a week of ﬁlm school for the shortcomings to become obvious. Almost all of the 50 students in my entering class had undergraduate degrees from a humanities discipline—­English, history, art, music. I was the only scientist. They understood narrative at a fairly intuitive level; I didn’t. This was a handicap that showed in my musical comedy short ﬁlm, despite the awards I received for it. It was a wacky, wild ﬁlm that audiences enjoyed, but it didn’t tell much of a story. And yet\n\n46\n\nSC IEN C E IS ST U C K IN A N ARRAT IV E W O R LD . . .\n\ndespite this hole in my background, the overall experience of entering the ﬁlm world from science wasn’t all that alien. The characters and setting deﬁnitely were different, but there was a similar feel to the process. So many people ask me about how weird it must have been to go from science to cinema. I always reply that I have been much more impressed by the similarities in the two worlds than by the differences. So, at the start of my journey, at age 38, I knew not the ﬁrst thing about stories or how important and pervasive they are. Why should I have known anything? I was trained as a scientist. And there you have it. The basic problem. Scientists are trained only as scientists—­meaning they sprint past the humanities to the best of their ability when they are undergraduates. I certainly did this, and I know I’m not alone. A couple years ago I was talking about this with a group at the American Association of the Advancement of Science—­the world’s largest science organization. The head of AAAS at the time, Alan Leshner, broke in to say, “Same with me—­when I got to college, all I wanted to study was science, so I bypassed almost all of the humanities courses.” Is that just a thing of the past? Hardly. I spoke with Stephanie Yin, who worked as one of my assistants right after she graduated from Brown University. At Brown they let you design your own curriculum (no surprise for the uber-­progressive Brown). Guess what she did—­same thing. She arrived at college, knew she wanted to be a scientist, and went straight for the science courses. She took a creative nonﬁction class, a graphic novels course, a history seminar on Chinese Americans and a few semesters of Hindi. That was it. No History of American Literature, no Western Civilization, no Shakespeare—­pretty much nothing that didn’t have science in it. At one of my workshops with postdocs of National Institutes of Health I asked a more important question. How many of them had received some sort of training in basic narrative principles\n\n47\n\nC HAPT ER 1\n\nsomewhere along the way in their educations? The answer was none. Of course, scientists are trained to be critical and pick holes in everything you say, so at this point I’m sure many readers are thinking, “That’s not a data set, and I have lots of scientist friends who took plenty of courses in the humanities.” Yes, I do too. But trust me, overall, the majority of science students bypass the humanities and I don’t blame them. Science is fun. Why waste time reading Dickens and Chaucer when you can search for the deﬁnition of life itself? So why does this matter? Let me start by mentioning a few famous scientists you’ll hear more about later in this book. First off, James Watson. Not only did he co-­discover the structure of DNA, he also wrote a magniﬁcent book about his experiences that has stood the test of time. We will break down the narrative structure of that book in part 3. (And yes, I am fully aware of the claims against Watson for failing to cite people who deserved shared credit in this discovery. But think about that in the context of what I said about the power of singular narrative. He knew it well and used it to his own advantage as a communicator. No, I am not suggesting that you emulate Watson. He used these principles in the wrong way, to the detriment of others. But I am advocating that you, like Watson, develop a deep understanding of how narrative works and use it to your advantage when appropriate.) Guess what Watson’s undergraduate education was like. In his autobiography, with the delightfully curmudgeonly title Avoid Boring People: Lessons from a Life in Science, he tells of his greatest teachers as an undergraduate, saying, “Particularly moving was Green’s Humanities II lecture on the grand inquisitor of Dostoevsky’s Brothers Karamazov and the choice between freedom and security offered by adherence to religious authority.” Guess how many lectures on Dostoevsky I had as an undergraduate. In later chapters you will see how Watson nailed near-­perfect narrative structure in writing what might be the most important\n\n48\n\nSC IEN C E IS ST U C K IN A N ARRAT IV E W O R LD . . .\n\nresearch paper in the history of science, then eventually did the same with The Double Helix. It’s not a coincidence—­his level of success in science and the strength of his grounding in the humanities. He clearly has this powerful attribute of narrative intuition. In graduate school I had two lecturers whom I idolized for their communications skills, Stephen Jay Gould and E. O. Wilson. Both legendary biologists. Both tremendous lecturers. Both thoroughly steeped in the humanities. I think part of my intrigue with them was just realizing what they possessed that I had failed to get in my training. And let me tell you how long it took me to make up for this shortcoming. During orientation week at ﬁlm school in 1994, three “older” graduate students (who were all probably ten years younger than me) spoke to us, giving us long-­term advice about the program. They made it clear: when you graduate, the only thing Hollywood will value you for is your writing skill. They won’t care if you’ve directed a great ﬁlm—­if movie companies want movie directors they generally look to music video and commercial directors who have intensively honed their visual skills. Film schools are the breeding ground for the more cerebral elements of ﬁlmmaking, namely, writing. So you’d better get to work writing three great screenplays that you can sell when you graduate because that is your only hope. At that point in life, I was still a scientist, so I did what scientists generally do—­I didn’t listen. (Oh, whoa, no he didn’t—­did he just insult the entire profession of science? Actually, I defer on this note to the chief scientist of the Nature Conservancy and a member of the National Academy of Science, Peter Karieva, who, in reviewing Don’t Be Such a Scientist for Science, said, “The failure of scientists as communicators is that they do not know how to listen, especially when it comes to the ‘uneducated public.’”) I ignored this ﬁlm school advice about the importance of learning to write, which basically means learning how to tell stories.\n\n49\n\nC HAPT ER 1\n\nTelling stories requires that you have what I have labeled narrative intuition. All my classmates had already consumed mountains of novels as undergrads. They had the narrative templates imprinted on their brains. In contrast, I had consumed books about the phylogenetic tree. I could tell them more things about the difference between onychophorans and tardigrades than they could ever know . . . or, um, probably care to know. But I didn’t have the same background in narrative. So wouldn’t you think that after three years of ﬁlm school and ﬁve writing classes I would catch up with them? Nope. What about after writing and directing an entire comedy feature ﬁlm after ﬁlm school, writing screenplays that were represented by one of the top three talent agencies in Hollywood, and making short ﬁlms about the oceans that were broadly popular (my public service announcement with comic actor Jack Black scored over $10 million in free air time). Still nope. The entire process, from my start in making ﬁlms to my ﬁnal realization at a somewhat deep and intuitive level of the importance of narrative, would end up taking 16 years. It ﬁnally hit me in 2005 when I was making my documentary feature Flock of Dodos, a story I tell in Don’t Be Such a Scientist. That is how difﬁcult and challenging this stuff is. Especially if you’ve already started molding your brain into the form of a scientist’s. Is it hopeless? No. You just have to accept that it will take plenty of time and effort. The good news is, this narrative training is worth it because in today’s increasingly communications-­driven world, it’s essential. It’s a Narrative World: Deal with It\n\nThere are many other basic rules about storytelling that can be counterintuitive and thus difﬁcult to grasp. We’ll get to more of them, but for now let me go back to the main point—­that science\n\n50\n\nFIGU R E 9: A G O O G LE N -GRA M FOR THE WORD “N A RRAT I VE.”\n\nSC IEN C E IS ST U C K IN A N ARRAT IV E W O R LD . . .\n\n0.00500% NARR ATIVE 0.00450% 0.00400% 0.00350% 0.00300% 0.00250% 0.00200% 0.00150% 0.00100% 0.00050% 0.00000% 1960\n\n1980\n\n2000\n\nFigure 9.

This search result shows that, as information exploded in the 1980s, so did the use of the word narrative.\n\nis stuck in a narrative world. As a result, scientists did not come up with their own unique mode of communication. Instead, they molded their language to that of the existing world. Even though there has arisen an entire discipline called “science communication,” I would argue that there is nothing unique to the way science is communicated. In fact, I fear that label actually sends the wrong message. I meet people who say, “I’m a science communicator,” as if it were somehow unique. It’s like saying you’re a “baseball runner,” or “soccer runner”—­r unning is pretty much the same from one sport to the next. Same with communication from one discipline to the next. So as I said, scientiﬁc journals began in 1665 with their own literary form, but eventually the Hegelian Triad took over and the\n\n51\n\nC HAPT ER 1\n\nstructure of scientiﬁc papers adapted to it. Perhaps someday science will develop its own new template that does not conform to narrative and Hegelian dynamics, but for now there are no signs of that happening. Nor are there any signs of narrative playing a lesser role in our society. Just look at ﬁgure 9, which shows the frequency of the word narrative across recently published books. Use of the word narrative erupted over the past couple decades, right in stride with the information explosion that took place in our society. Nowadays you hear it used constantly by news pundits, politicians, journalists, historians, economists—­pretty much everyone who is trying to make sense of today’s noise-­ﬁlled world. On The Daily Show, Jon Stewart asked President Obama, “Do you buy into the Democratic party narrative?” But it wasn’t always that way. I guarantee if you were to watch all the broadcasts of famed television news anchor Walter Cronkite, you would never hear him talking about the Vietnam narrative, or the space race narrative, or the China narrative. The word just wasn’t used. Today it is everywhere. Why is it so ubiquitous? I think the cause is information saturation. Narratives are stories that connect a series of events over time, creating large-­scale patterns. When information becomes superabundant, it’s only logical that people will look for higher-­level patterns. So if we accept that scientists are stuck in this narrative world and could use some help, then whom should they turn to for assistance?\n\n52\n\n2 AND the humanities ought to help . . .\n\nHere’s a cool idea. You’re a scientist on a college campus. You’ve realized you need help with narrative. You’ve also realized that over on the other side of campus are all these folks in the humanities who work with narrative all day long. Why not seek their help? Before I tell you why not, let me ﬁrst explain why, in a perfect world, seeking the help of humanities folks would be the perfect idea. Science actually has a lot in common with what “those people” do. Here’s how. Dude, It Really Is All the Same Story\n\nLet’s talk about “problem-­solution” for both science and the humanities. It’s pretty obvious that the scientiﬁc method is an exercise in problem solving. Here’s a deﬁnition for the scientiﬁc method from a popular dictionary website: A method of investigation in which a problem is ﬁrst identiﬁed and observations, experiments, or other relevant data are then used to construct and test hypotheses that purport to solve it.\n\n53\n\nF I GURE 1 0: THE STO RY C IR C L E\n\nC HAPT ER 2\n\nEND\n\nSTART\n\nORDINARY WORLD SOLUTION\n\nPROBLEM\n\nSPECIAL WORLD\n\nFigure 10. The story circle. It doesn’t get much simpler than this. Ever heard the expression “come full circle”? It’s part of our narrative nature.\n\nNotice the words problem and solve. You address a problem in the form of a question, then you seek the answer. That’s what scientists do all day, every day. Now let’s go back to story structure and Joseph Campbell—­the guy with the mind of a scientist who crashed the story party in the 1940s. I mentioned that he identiﬁed a universal structure to stories, which he termed the monomyth. He also described the structure of a story as a circle. In Campbell’s wonderfully simple conception, a story begins at a point in time (could be physical, could be mental) from which we head out, do some stuff, and eventually ﬁnd our way back—­essentially “coming full circle.” This is the ﬁrst point for grasping how a story works—­one big circular journey. In the case of The Wizard of Oz (which I hold up as a model for broad storytelling), Dorothy leaves Kansas, goes to Oz, then eventually ﬁnds her way back home to Kansas—­coming full circle. The second starting point for grasping how a story works is to view a story as a journey between two worlds—­the everyday world and the exceptional world. Campbell called these the Ordinary World and the Special World (as you see in ﬁgure 10).\n\n54\n\nAN D T HE HU M AN IT IES OU G HT T O H E LP . . .\n\nThe Ordinary World is where you, deep inside, yearn to live your entire life. It is your place of complete comfort, safety and security. You really never want to leave it. But things happen in life that throw you out of your Ordinary World (like getting yanked up by a tornado). Once you’re taken out of your Ordinary World, you have only one major thing on your mind and one goal in life, which is to ﬁnd your way back to that world of comfort. What’s the very ﬁrst thing Dorothy wants when she lands in Oz? To go home—­back to her Ordinary World. All of which means that as soon as you leave your Ordinary World, you automatically have a problem (how to get back), which means you need to undergo a journey in search of a solution. And there’s your story—­one big exercise in problem-­solution. Same as science. Dude, same story. When you begin to process this way of looking at a story, you also see that it’s what you experience every day of your life. You start your day at home (your Ordinary World), you venture out to somewhere (the Special World), then eventually make your way back home—­hopefully a little better for the journey. Then at night you go to the pub and tell your friends the “story” of your day. So it seems obvious to head over to your university’s English Department and shout out, “Can anybody here help us with our narrative problems?” But I don’t really recommend it. I’ll tell you why.\n\n55\n\n3 BUT the humanities are useless for this . . .\n\nOkay, before I get lynched by a mob of professors in tweed jackets with elbow patches, let me hide behind my friend Jerry Graff. In addition to writing the hyperpopular textbook on argumentation They Say, I Say with his wife, Cathy Birkenstein, he has made a habit of tweaking the noses of academics. In particular, with his book Clueless in Academe, he pretty much slaps academia in the face with language far more harsh than I would ever use. His ﬁrst chapter is titled “In the Dark All Eggheads Are Gray.” Wow. How much do I love Jerry Graff, my hero? I so thoroughly admire people who are well into their 70s yet still have as much ﬁre burning in them as a young radical. It is possible to keep the mojo alive, and he’s one of several septuagenarians I know who exemplify this. His book is an indictment of what everyone pretty much knows about academia. The place is a refuge for culturally detached blowhards, some of whom are good for teaching and research but often limited in their ability to function outside the ivory tower. Not all of them, but many. The humanities in general have all sorts of unhealthy problems. For the last few decades there has been what is often labeled as the\n\n57\n\nC HAPT ER 3\n\n“humanities crisis.” Benjamin Winterhalter addressed this problem nicely in a 2014 article in the Atlantic titled “The Morbid Fascination with the Death of the Humanities.” In the article, Winterhalter examines the trend of bemoaning the humanities’ sad decline. I ﬁrst recall reading about this decline in the 1980s social crisis book Cultural Literacy, by E. D. Hirsch. It was an early cry of “What’s this world coming to?” as college campuses in the new information era began to see the humanities displaced by the hegemony of science and technology. All across America students were replacing literature classes with computer science courses—­t rading one language for another. Winterhalter tells of the predictability of New York Times op-­ed pieces agonizing over the trend. The New Republic created the article tag “Humanities Deathwatch.” In 2009 Mark Slouka unleashed a cry in the dark in Harper’s titled “Dehumanized: When Math and Science Rule the School.” (Note: I wrote to Slouka in 2009 about my ﬁrst book. He rather grouchily assumed I was part of the science offensive and basically told me to get lost.) In fact, the politicization of humanities programs is felt by many to be out of control. In Clueless in Academe, Graff talks about how the divide between traditionalists and progressives has widened to the point where even the individual programs are divided in philosophy. In the late 1990s in one of the all-­time great academic pranks, Alan Sokal, a physicist at New York University, submitted a phony paper to Social Text, an academic journal of postmodern cultural studies, just to show what a politicized mess the humanities are. Titled “Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity,” the article was intentionally a bunch of mumbo jumbo written to play to the politics of the editors. (In my head I can hear Butthead saying, “Heh, heh—­he said hermeneutics.”) After Social Text published the article in 1996, Sokal revealed in\n\n58\n\nB U T T HE HU M AN IT IES ARE U SEL ESS F O R T H I S . . .\n\nanother journal, Lingua Franca, that the article was a hoax. He referred to it as “a pastiche of left-­wing cant, fawning references, grandiose quotations, and outright nonsense.” As you can imagine, the humanities folks didn’t take kindly to Sokal’s prank. It picked open the scab of the longstanding concern about “The Two Cultures,” which was the title of a 1959 essay by literary ﬁgure/ physicist C. P. Snow calling attention to the divide that had already arisen between the humanities and science. Outrage over the Sokal Hoax sparked a 1997 symposium about the “culture wars,” which was summarized in the 2001 book The One Culture? But by the admission of most of the participants, the debates largely involved academics blowing smoke past each other with little application to the real world. It’s sad really. Even great scientists don’t seem to be able to effectively bridge the divide. During my ﬁrst year of graduate school at Harvard, I was a teaching fellow for E. O. Wilson, one of the greatest biologists ever. He is widely known as “the father of entomology” as well as “the father of biodiversity” and has won two Pulitzer Prizes for his popular writing (though a lot of his popular writing is still on a fairly high cultural plane). He is a magniﬁcent lecturer who, along with Steve Gould, made Harvard a dazzling place to study ecology and evolution in the late 1970s. In 1998 he threw himself into this divide between the humanities and the sciences with his book Consilience—­a word that means convergence of evidence. He called for the two cultures to converge. It was a great and mighty essay, which I read when it came out. But, the only reason I read it was money. At the time I was working for National Geographic’s feature ﬁlm ofﬁce in Hollywood, reading material for potential as movies. They paid me, and I plowed through it. Otherwise I never would have made it more than 20 pages. As I say, it was a great and incredibly erudite essay about bringing the humanities and sciences together, but it was written in the language of intellectuals, for intellectuals. Which in the end is\n\n59\n\nC HAPT ER 3\n\nmostly what academics do—­they talk to each other. That’s ﬁne for academia but is of limited practicality for society. This brings us back to the humanities. I’m afraid they’re a bit of a write-­off for the sciences when it comes to addressing this serious, and I think urgent, problem of narrative deﬁciency. Scientists need help, but they must get it from people who go beyond theorizing and work in the real world. Which is what leads me to my overall recommendation . . .\n\n60\n\n4 THEREFORE Hollywood to the rescue\n\nHow’s that for a shocker? The land that gives you zombies, vampires and Transformers also has what the science world needs. This is what I have learned in my 20-­year excursion away from academia. Jerry Graff provides the core of my argument when he says in his book Clueless in Academe, “An old saying has it that academic disputes are especially vicious because so little is at stake in them.” That’s the problem. There’s never been that much at stake for academics once they have tenure. But in Hollywood, everything is at stake at almost every hour of the day. There’s a common expression in Hollywood that is absolutely true and mentioned every day: “You’re only as good as your last movie.” Doesn’t matter how esteemed you are—­one stinker and you’re cooked for a long time to come. Let’s look at this in scientiﬁc terms—­speciﬁcally, evolution by means of natural selection. In nature, some environments provide harsh conditions, which are believed to cause natural selection to operate very quickly, while other environments are not as severe and therefore present weaker selective regimes. We can say that academics live in a “weak selective environment.” Universities can be wonderfully inspiring and fun places to be, but they tend to suffer\n\n61\n\nC HAPT ER 4\n\nnot just from detachment from the real world but also a willingness to nurture the weak and feeble. I saw it as a professor. It was kind of beyond belief what some of the tenured professors in my department were allowed to get away with. One old guy was a hardcore alcoholic who literally—­and I mean literally, like, this is the truth—­canceled every other lecture in his animal biology course. He would show up and say, “It’s a nice day. Everyone get outside and enjoy the weather.” All the faculty knew he did this. There was nothing that could be done—­he had tenure. Which is no big deal. It’s part of what goes on in academia, and there are great beneﬁts that come at the cost of the occasional instances of tenure abuse. But overall, academia is simply detached from the real world and not the sort of incubator that is likely to help science with this very practical problem. It is a nurturing environment, but it is also the ivory tower and everyone knows what that means—­this is nothing shocking I’m saying here. Hollywood is a very different story, as I have witnessed ﬁrsthand over the past two decades. Hollywood is a brutal, rotten, vicious, heartless place. One of my favorite memories of the place is of a friend from acting class who did a movie with comed"
