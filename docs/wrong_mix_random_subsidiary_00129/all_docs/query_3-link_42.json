He is already a fighter,” she wrote.\n\nWednesday night, alongside a photo of the baby’s foot, Christina Milian wrote on Facebook, in part, “Our family was blessed to have met our little Angel Baby Richie. We were fighting for him and with him the whole way and are now coping with the direction in which fate took. I ask that you keep him and our entire family in your prayers– Especially Danielle, Richard, Naomi & Dj and know that we’ve all been touched by our little Guardian Angel. His memory will forever live on in our thoughts and our hearts. May he now rest in peace in the arms of our Heavenly Father . stay blessed.”"
