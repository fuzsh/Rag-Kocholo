Today, I’m diving into Christina Milian’s skincare routine, and while it’s mostly fab, due to time constraints, I’ll focus on 2 major no-nos! 🚫\n\n1. Makeup Wipes: 🚫\nThese aren’t gentle enough for regular use, especially for sensitive skin. \n➡️They don’t effectively remove all makeup remnants and can tug at your skin, leading to irritation and premature aging (aka signs of #inflammaging). \n⭐️Instead, opt for a gel cleanser or a balm/oil-based cleanser suited to your skin type. 🚿✨ \n⛔️Makeup wipes are a NO in my book for good cleansing.\n\n2. Sugar Scrub: 🚫\nThis is a big no-no, much like the infamous walnut or apricot scrubs. \n➡️ The rough texture of sugar can damage your skin barrier and cause more problems down the road, like irritation and sensitivities. 😱I made the mistake of using it as a teenager, and trust me, the aftermath was not pretty. \n💚Instead, choose a soft exfoliator tailored to your skin type. 🧖‍♀️🌸 \n⛔️So sugar scrubs (or walnut or apricot scrubs) are another BIG NO in my book. \n⭐️Use gentle exfoliants suitable to your skin type.\n\nYou can find the original video for Christina Milian on @HarpersBazaar! 🌿✨\n\n#SkincareTips #ChristinaMilian #NighttimeRoutine #SkincareNoNos #BusyMums #HealthySkin #DrEbruexplains #inflammaging #aveseena #skincareroutine #sugarscrub #harpersbazaargotobedwithme\".",
