out\n\nTill the end of the song\n\n[Christina:]\n\nYou're feelin' me,\n\nAnd it's got you all fired up\n\nTryin' to walk away\n\nCause you don't want your heart tied up\n\n[Bridge:]\n\nBut I can feel the proof when your holdin' me\n\nLike to let you think your controlin' me\n\nEven thought that ain't the deal\n\nWhen I want I take the wheel, and I know\n\nCan't hide that your really into me\n\nHold is so tight I can barely breathe\n\nCause you know I keep it real\n\nGiving you what you can feel\n\n[Hook:]\n\nWhatever you want I got it\n\nWhatever you need that's me\n\nFeelin' the flow, don't stop it\n\nWhatever you need I'll be\n\nWhatever you want I got it\n\nWhatever you need that's me\n\nFeelin' the flow, don't stop it\n\nWhatever you need I'll be\n\n[Christina:]\n\nYour frontin' like\n\nYou don't want no one to know\n\nBut it's in your eyes\n\nThat you don't want me to know\n\n[Bridge:]\n\nBut I can feel the proof when your holdin' me\n\nLike to let you think your controlin' me\n\nEven thought that ain't the deal\n\nWhen I want I take the wheel, cause I know\n\nCan't hide that your really into me,\n\nHold is so tight I can barely breathe\n\nCause you know I

crunk it like me\n\nLotta of guys here but none is like me\n\nThough some could try to be\n\nWith two or three chains up under the white tee\n\nAnd i got two or three dames thats comin' tonight\n\nSee em, done tonight leave\n\nLike one, aight peace\n\nOnly Mike puts up numbers like these\n\nAnd he's no longer playin\n\nBut neither am I, so\n\nWhat i'm sayin is hop in the deuce seater with I\n\nCause you know with them boots\n\nAnd that beater you fly\n\nOther dudes act to cheap with the pie,\n\nWon't drop a few pennies\n\nOr cop you a guinea, but I'll cop you as many\n\nToast till the
