        "text": "Original air date: October 29th, 1997\n\nUsually, the B plot is reserved for silly nonsense that has little to do with the A plot, which is driving the story. To me, a B plot just gives a side character something to do for about 7-10 minutes of screentime. But this time, Yvette is being used to show viewers a very common dilemma when dating, at least for women anyway. If the genders were reversed, it would probably be treated as normal.\n\nYvette is doing her normal maternal routine of entertaining TJ's outlandish ideas about an upcoming video project when she runs into her episode-appointed white friend. She has a few of these who we'll never see again but Nina manages to stick around the longest. This one is joining Yvette while she tears down another woman for being dumber than her. No, just kidding. She's tearing her down for being dumber than her AND snagging an intellectual hottie.\n\nLiterally the minute Yvette finishes her rant, she bumps into a sexy tall guy and proceeds to malfunction. She can't even tell him where chemistry class is because she was too busy soaking her panties. TJ smirks at the camera, realizing his sister is just like the boys she was complaining about no less than a minute ago. Thanks for the thumbnail shot, Teej!\n\nRemember that video project? Mackie is about to get a shitty grade because all he did was film his alcoholic dad sleeping. TJ informs yet another teacher we'll never see again that his group has chosen to use historical Washington D.C. buildings as the backdrop of their project for this juxtaposition narrative. Of course, TJ is a control freak and has not bothered to mention this to his group members, one of which, includes Taraji P. Henson, who would go on to also play an Yvette herself.\n\nWhen TJ chastises them for being too lazy to come up with ideas, Mo offers one. Because it's Mo, we already know it's not going to work. He reiterates the plot of \"Do the Right Thing.\" Teacher lady tells him to sit his ass down. Marcus actually offers an idea that makes sense and one I don't know why he didn't just offer earlier? A music video with his band!\n\nTJ immediately shuts it down because it wasn't his idea, although this underpaid teacher is on board. This is one of the things I really despise about TJ. If it wasn't his idea, he's immediately against it. I see a little narcissist in the making.\n\nBack at the Henderson crib, Yvette is gushing about Xavier's swim meet. Just as she's clearly about to take him upstairs so he can do a different version of diving, Floyd comes in and totally cockblocks. He demands Xavier sit down although Yvette tells him not to. He does anyway. You better listen to Papa Floyd!\n\nOnce Xavier starts talking, we see why Yvette probably wanted to dodge her father in the first place. Xavier begs to leave once Floyd, just by asking a couple of questions, has already deemed this man a complete moron. Welp, at least he has goals and will end up at the Olympics one day! Just don't ask him where they'll take place. Although, to be fair, he could have just been anxious here. Hot people get nervous too!\n\nYvette lets Xavier dip out even though I'm sure they had \"other\" plans. She says she'll see him tomorrow and he actually asks \"where?\" After he leaves, Yvette starts to feel bad because she knows she's a hypocrite. Who is she to judge other women for being dumb and dating smart guys when she's smart and is dating this dumb guy just because he's tall and hot and has abs? After Yvette leaves, unfairly comparing him to TJ, Floyd then insults Marcus and Mo by saying Xavier is not even as smart as them. Another unfair comparison as Marcus and Mo are just lazy, if anything. We see in a later episode that Mo can get good grades as long as he thinks he's on drugs. And we all know Marcus only applies himself when it comes to music.\n\nWhen Marcus and TJ come home, they're arguing about the project. TJ thinks Marcus should be happy with just having his music playing but Marcus wants his band in the video. Eventually, Floyd steps in to remind his son that he needs to consider everyone's opinion. Right. The next scene is TJ going over the storyboards for the video. Instead of actually listening to the gang's stupid ideas, TJ just goes with the automated response of \"I'll think about it” which usually means no. However, it's better than TJ unfairly flexing his power or trying to jump start his brother's nervous breakdown so I guess we should be happy.\n\nNot for too long, though! When TJ gets home, he sees that Marcus has gone and held a damn casting session for the video. TJ is understandably annoyed because the only thing more powerful than TJ's high IQ and manipulation skills is a teenage boy's hormones.\n\nYvette lauds TJ for not succumbing to the perils of superficiality until Xavier starts posing, reducing himself to what Yvette was just talking against. Marcus calls her out because he sees Yvette is finally doing what he's been doing: treating the opposite sex like a carbon meat popsicle. He even calls him Flipper and Yvette accidentally repeats it. When Yvette retreats into the house, TJ announces that he's the director and asks if anyone has a problem with it.\n\nGilligan cut to TJ talking to his episode-appointed teacher telling him that people have smoke with him for being a control freak. His teacher threatens to replace him unless he tightens up and begins collaborating with his teammates. TJ pleads with his teacher and pretends to enjoy receiving criticism. I low-key want to make a .gif of him going, \"I'm listening to criticism and I'm liking it!\"\n\nThe next day, Yvette is spoiling her man with gifts at school. I'm assuming the sex is good because they have to have only been dating a few days. Weeks maybe? I assume episodes are usually on a day-by-day timeframe. Anyways, dumb ass Xavier is literally trying to find his gift by pulling the gifts out of the bag. See, he's not bright, so he doesn't realize that the books are the gift. He actually thinks Yvette is pissed at him. I would love guys who get that pissed off at me.\n\nYvette becomes exasperated at the thought that yes, sweetie, you're dating an aquatic dumb jock. A nice one, but still. Yvette confesses to her episode-appointed white bestie that she feels bad because she's willingly decided to date someone who doesn't challenge her intellectually.\n\nWe cut to TJ and the gang chatting in Mr. Feeny's classroom about their video project, TJ's effort to be more collaborative. First, Monique, AKA Taraji, vetoes the leather hats idea because she is a vegetarian, I assume. As everyone begins putting their two cents in, we see that TJ is now equating collaboration with giving in to all of their ideas. But remember, TJ is a control freak, so he can only stand listening to someone else's ideas for so long. He hides behind Mr. Feeny's desk and sulks.\n\nMeanwhile, Yvette attempts to dump Xavier with her friend--apparently her name is Tammy--in tow. She literally admits to Yvette that the moment he's back on the market, she's shooting her shot because she knows most successful Black athletes don't believe in condoms. Now I see why she only lasted one episode. When Xavier comes out of the locker room, body glistening, Yvette obviously can't even continue with the dumping. She says she'll see him later, fully clothed, and drags her drooling soon-to-be-ex-friend away with her.\n\nCut to the filming of the video. I actually did like this concept and the song choice does illustrate the nature of America, pimping people out, \"dogging them\" if you will, but asking its victims not to hate them, as it is the nature of the game. Everything is going well until the slides are projected and literally everyone has a problem with each one. The only one that made sense to me was one of the dancers saying to remove the Jefferson memorial, as he owned slaves. The dancers + Monique begin arguing about imperialism! We love to see it. TJ leaves. He's over this shit.\n\nWe cut back to the Henderson crib where Yvette is about to dump Xavier. But this fool can't hear her because he has his earplugs in. Poor Yvette. She's just been yapping and yapping and he's just staring at her, watching her mouth move but not putting two and two together. She's exasperated but Xavier sees nothing wrong with what they have. TJ barges in and starts whining about his group, demanding an audience. In the midst of his rant, he says that everyone is always overthinking everything and won't just let things be. This is what makes Yvette decide to continue seeing Xavier because although he's a dumb jock, he is sweet. He even admits to her that he likes how intellectual she is. Aww. We'll never see him again. Guess Yvette got sick of reading him those books she gifted.\n\nTJ is now whining to his long-suffering father who is about to help him see the faults in his approach and suggests that TJ find a happy middle ground where he isn't a tyrant nor a pushover. He returns to school two hours later--I guess they're within walking distance because they literally come and go as they please--and sees the group is now arguing over what to order. None of them noticed TJ left but he is about to assert his presence for sure. He finally asks each member what they want to contribute and they all have a level-headed discussion. TJ turns on the camera and then presents this whole conversation as his video project. I personally would have gone with the music video idea, but the episode-appointed teacher liked it so, whatever. Roll cred--I mean, the video!\n\nThings I Noticed:\n\n- TJ agrees to cut the hats because he doesn't want Monique to wear a \"face on her head.\" That line still cracks me up."
