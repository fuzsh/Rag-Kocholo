Event description via Institute's website: Love letters almost came between Marie Curie and her second Nobel Prize. In the spring of 1910, several years after her husband’s death, Marie Curie began an affair with the married French physicist Paul Langevin. Just days before the Nobel Committee announced her second Nobel, Langevin’s wife made their love letters public. This scandal threatened Curie’s prize and inspired men to fight multiple duels over her honor. Join us as we dig into the two love affairs that shaped Curie’s personal life—with Pierre Curie, her husband and scientific partner who died an early and tragic death, and Paul Langevin. Since letters were so important in both courtships, we’ll also look at some postage stamps featuring Marie Curie; her husband, Pierre; and Paul Langevin. Afterward, nerd out over treasures from our Othmer Library, and create a Valentine using historic inks.\n\nRelated slideshows\n\nRandall Hardy20080604\n\nRandall Hardy20080604\n\nWomen scientists brief biographies\n\nWomen scientists brief biographies\n\nCdl2010fringe\n\nCdl2010fringe\n\nLove, Stamps, Science, & Scandal\n\n1.

I noticed the grave and gentle expression of his face, as well as a certain abandon in his attitude, suggesting the dream absorbed in his reflections.” ~Marie Curie on Pierre, 1923 Pierre Curie ImageviatheNobelFoundation\n\n9. “It would… be a fine thing..

Tragedy “His body passed between the feet of the horses without even being touched, and then between the two front wheels of the wagon. A miracle was possible. But the enormous mass… continued for several yards more. The left back wheel encountered a feeble obstacle which it crushed in passing: a forehead, a human head. The cranium was shattered and a red, viscous matter trickled in all directions in the mud: the brain of Pierre Curie.” ~Eve Curie, Marie and Pierre’s daughter, 1937 Image via the Bibliothèque nationale de France\n\n16.

Still I see your eyes, kind and tender, and your warm smile and I can only dream of the moment that I find again the sweetness of your presence.” ~Marie Curie to Paul Langevin, 1911\n\n19. Exposed!

Marie defends herself “In fact, the prize has been awarded for the discovery of Radium and Polonium. I believe that there is no connection between my scientific work and the facts of private life… I cannot accept the idea in principle that the appreciation of the value of scientific work should be influenced by libel and slander concerning private life.” ~Marie Curie to the Nobel Committee, 5 December 1911 HenriManuel,portraitofMarieCurie,ca.1920,viaChristie’s.\n\n24.
