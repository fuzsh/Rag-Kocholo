Joe Budden\n\nOnce again it's on\n\nAnd we gonna ride out\n\nOnce again till dawn\n\nCut the lights out\n\nOnce again till morn\n\nKeep the lights out\n\nTill the end of the song\n\nYour feelin' me,\n\nAnd it's got you all fired up,\n\nTryin' to walk away\n\nCause you don't want your heart tied up\n\nBut I can feel the proof when your holdin' me\n\nLike to let you think your controlin' me,\n\nEven thought that ain't the deal,\n\nWhen I want I take the wheel, and I know\n\nCan't hide that your really into me,\n\nHold is so tight I can barely breathe\n\nCause you know I keep it real\n\nGiving you what you can feel\n\nWhatever u want I got it,\n\nWhatever u need that's me\n\nFeelin' the flow, don't stop it\n\nWhatever u need i'll be\n\nWhatever u want I got it,\n\nWhatever u need that's me\n\nFeelin' the flow, don't stop it\n\nWhatever u need i'll be\n\nYour frontin' like,\n\nYou don't want no one to know\n\nBut it's in your eyes\n\nThat you don't want me to go\n\nBut I can feel the proof when your holdin' me\n\nLike to let you think your controlin' me,\n\nEven thought that ain't the deal,\n\nWhen I want I take the wheel, cause I know\n\nCan't hide that your really into me,\n\nHold is so tight I can barely breathe\n\nCause you know I keep it real\n\nGiving you what you can feel\n\nWhatever u want I got it,\n\nWhatever u need that's me\n\nFeelin' the flow, don't stop it\n\nWhatever u need i'll be\n\nWhatever u want I got it,\n\nWhatever u need that's me\n\nFeelin' the flow, don't stop it\n\nWhatever u need i'll be\n\nWe gonna get it started, OK\n\nNow go get the party jumpin' like me,\n\nWho crunk it like me,\n\nLotta of guys here but none is like me\n\nThough some could try to be\n\nWith two or three chains up under the white tee\n\nAnd i got two or three dames that's comin' tonight,\n\nSee em, done tonight leave,\n\nLike one, aight peace\n\nOnly Mike puts up numbers like these,\n\nAnd he's no longer playin,\n\nBut neither am I, so\n\nWhat i'm sayin is hop in the deuce seater with I\n\nCause you know with them boots\n\nAnd that beater you fly,\n\nOther dudes act to cheap with the pie,\n\nWon't drop a few pennies,\n\nOr cop you a guinea, but i'll cop you as many,\n\nToast till the bottles all empty,\n\nLike pardon the Bravado in me\n\nUs two that's a plan somehow,\n\nGet to know each other later,\n\nLet's dance for now, c'mon\n\nWhatever u want I got it,\n\nWhatever u need that's me\n\nFeelin' the flow, don't stop it\n\nWhatever u need i'll be\n\nWhatever u want I got it,\n\nWhatever u need that's me\n\nFeelin' the flow, don't stop it\n\nWhatever u need i'll be\n\nWhatever u want I got it,\n\nWhatever u need that's me\n\nFeelin' the flow, don't stop it\n\nWhatever u need i'll be\n\nWhatever u want I got it,\n\nWhatever u need that's me\n\nFeelin' the flow, don't stop it\n\nWhatever u need i'll be\n\nWhatever u want I got it,\n\nWhatever u need that's me\n\nWhatever u want I got it,\n\nWhatever u need that... that's me\n\nLyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
