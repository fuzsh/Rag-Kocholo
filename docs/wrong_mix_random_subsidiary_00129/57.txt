Christina Milian

Whatever U Want

Ft. Joe Budden

Once again it's on

And we gonna ride out

Once again till dawn

Cut the lights out

Once again till morn

Keep the lights out

Till the end of the song

Your feelin' me,

And it's got you all fired up,

Tryin' to walk away

Cause you don't want your heart tied up

But I can feel the proof when your holdin' me

Like to let you think your controlin' me,

Even thought that ain't the deal,

When I want I take the wheel, and I know

Can't hide that your really into me,

Hold is so tight I can barely breathe

Cause you know I keep it real

Giving you what you can feel

Whatever u want I got it,

Whatever u need that's me

Feelin' the flow, don't stop it

Whatever u need i'll be

Whatever u want I got it,

Whatever u need that's me

Feelin' the flow, don't stop it

Whatever u need i'll be

Your frontin' like,

You don't want no one to know

But it's in your eyes

That you don't want me to go

But I can feel the proof when your holdin' me

Like to let you think your controlin' me,

Even thought that ain't the deal,

When I want I take the wheel, cause I know

Can't hide that your really into me,

Hold is so tight I can barely breathe

Cause you know I keep it real

Giving you what you can feel

Whatever u want I got it,

Whatever u need that's me

Feelin' the flow, don't stop it

Whatever u need i'll be

Whatever u want I got it,

Whatever u need that's me

Feelin' the flow, don't stop it

Whatever u need i'll be

We gonna get it started, OK

Now go get the party jumpin' like me,

Who crunk it like me,

Lotta of guys here but none is like me

Though some could try to be

With two or three chains up under the white tee

And i got two or three dames that's comin' tonight,

See em, done tonight leave,

Like one, aight peace

Only Mike puts up numbers like these,

And he's no longer playin,

But neither am I, so

What i'm sayin is hop in the deuce seater with I

Cause you know with them boots

And that beater you fly,

Other dudes act to cheap with the pie,

Won't drop a few pennies,

Or cop you a guinea, but i'll cop you as many,

Toast till the bottles all empty,

Like pardon the Bravado in me

Us two that's a plan somehow,

Get to know each other later,

Let's dance for now, c'mon

Whatever u want I got it,

Whatever u need that's me

Feelin' the flow, don't stop it

Whatever u need i'll be

Whatever u want I got it,

Whatever u need that's me

Feelin' the flow, don't stop it

Whatever u need i'll be

Whatever u want I got it,

Whatever u need that's me

Feelin' the flow, don't stop it

Whatever u need i'll be

Whatever u want I got it,

Whatever u need that's me

Feelin' the flow, don't stop it

Whatever u need i'll be

Whatever u want I got it,

Whatever u need that's me

Whatever u want I got it,

Whatever u need that... that's me
