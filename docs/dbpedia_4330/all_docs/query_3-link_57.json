        "text": "Mouse-loving mamas, you’ve been waiting for this moment: A baby is on the way, and the decorating can begin. There is something about Disney that helps make everything a little more magical and fun...or sparks cherished memories from our own childhoods. So why not infuse all of those good feelings into your baby’s room with a Disney themed nursery?\n\nThere are many ways to bring your most beloved movies, characters, and stories to life with a Disney nursery... and trust us, a Disney-themed nursery does not have to be cheesy or over-the-top. Here are some of our favorites Disney nursery ideas for your future House-of-Mouse devotee.\n\nBoho Minnie Mouse Art Disney Nursery Idea\n\nPhoto: @castleboundsupplyco\n\nThis feminine-bohemian Disney nursery decor is pointed, yet not over-the-top. The floral Mouse ear wall hanging and simple framed prints are super-sweet touches that bring the Disney theme home without being cheesy.\n\nDisney Nursery Mural\n\nPhoto: @laylakaristattoo\n\nThere’s nothing low-key about this splashy wall art, but if you’re ready to go big, you can’t go wrong with a Disney World or Land inspired mural. This is such a magical fixture, you could do very little else and still create so much wonder in the baby's room.\n\nClassic Disney Nursery Decor\n\nPhoto: @acozyhome\n\nYou can’t go wrong with old-school Mickey Mouse and friends, and this Disney baby room ties the theme in flawlessly. The Mickey varsity jacket and simple throw pillows give a nod to the Mouse without anything too showy.\n\nDisney Nursery Small World Sign Accessory\n\nPhoto: @heylindsaymichelle\n\nA swoon-worthy Small World sign would be the perfect touch in your modern Disney inspired nursery. Support small shop artisans on Etsy or Instagram, or try making one yourself!\n\nMickey Ears Disney Nursery Decor\n\nPhoto: @mallory.erin.makes\n\nInclude those famous ears in surprising ways for a whimsical take on a Disney nursery. This rainbow Mickey ear shelf is a great example of a subtle way you can weave the magic into your baby girl or boy’s room.\n\nDisney Nursery Castle Pillow\n\nPhoto: @disney_glitter_and_bow\n\nHere’s proof that a little detail can go a long way. This “HOME” pillow with Cinderella’s castle in the “O” spot is an adorable idea for a classy Disney nursery.\n\n\"Minnie Me\" Disney Nursery Bedding\n\nPhoto: @officialfreyja\n\nWe’re loving this Minnie Mouse-inspired crib mobile and bedding set for the sweetest little Disney baby girl nursery inspiration. (Of course, pillows and blankets should be kept out of your baby’s bed until they’re at least a year old).\n\nToy Story Mobile Disney Nursery Idea\n\nPhoto: @beemboland\n\nYou don’t have to decorate the whole room in these bold colors, but a fun and quirky mobile or over-the-crib art is a cool idea for a Toy Story nursery.\n\nComic Strip Wallpaper Disney Themed Nursery\n\nPhoto: @polinnnnnnn\n\nAnother take on Classic Mickey, these walls do all the talking so the rest of your decor can be simple, subtle, and monochrome. Perfect for a gender-neutral or boy’s nursery.\n\nDisney Nursery Art Ideas\n\nPhoto: @magicallyakSweet little pops of pretty in the form of tiny framed art and artifacts are a great route to take if you want to create a Disney baby room without erring on the side of corny. This little one’s decor is eclectic and chic with plenty of that Disney magic peppered in.\n\nPop Some Poppins Into Your Disney Nursery\n\nPhoto: @cadyhearn\n\nIt doesn’t take a spoonful of sugar to make a sweet nursery...artsy throw pillows make the Mary Poppins theme in this little girl’s nursery feel complete.\n\nDisney Nursery Wall Paint\n\nPhoto: Project Nursery\n\nBring home the fun of the Small World with an all-out accent wall like this one in your Disney nursery!\n\nPrincess Dress Disney Nursery Decor\n\nPhoto & Where to Buy: PrettyLittleInvite via Etsy\n\nDeck out your little princess’s room with prints of iconic Disney gowns! These Etsy prints are a darling find for a Cinderella baby room—and they’re customizable!\n\nFind Nemo in Your Disney Nursery\n\nPhoto & Where to Buy: Pottery Barn Kids\n\nAdd a fishy friend to your Disney-themed nursery, and your baby will grow up remembering to “just keep swimming!” Pottery Barn Kids has tons of Disney collaborations to outfit the perfect Disney nursery for your little one, and this decorative Finding Nemo pillow is no exception.\n\nDisney Nursery Fit for a Princess\n\nPhoto: @katyskingdom\n\nThat sweet smile says it all! Growing up in a grand room decked out in pale pink, white, and gold—with that sweet princess-themed mobile? A definite YES from this little princess.\n\nDisney Nursery Gallery Wall\n\nPhoto: @jadedaisy\n\nGallery walls are always a good idea, and in a nursery they’re a great way to bring in the Disney theme of your choice without going all-out throughout the space. Also, you can easily switch out prints as Baby grows and his or her tastes change.\n\nPeter Pan Disney Nursery Theme\n\nPhoto: @pirates_and_pixie\n\nWant a little one who never never grows up? A subtle Peter Pan theme is easily pulled off with details like the little clock, pirate pillows, and messages in a bottle this Mom infused into the decor for her baby boy.\n\nDisney Nursery Toy Story Wallpaper\n\nPhoto: @happylittlethought\n\nThose iconic Toy Story walls would be absolutely adorable in your tiny human’s first room.\n\nOnce Upon a Time… Disney Nursery Decor\n\nPhoto & Where to Buy: WonderWireDesign via Etsy\n\nAdd a storytelling vibe with a beautiful handmade sign like this one; it would look gorgeous above the baby’s crib or changing station.\n\nStained Glass Disney Nursery Art\n\nPhoto: @lifewiththewerdekkers\n\nA Beauty and the Beast nursery deserves some classic touches, like these stained-glass effect movie portraits. White finishings and simple wallpaper keep the space from feeling too Disney-fied, but the roses along the curtain rod and Chip figurine sitting on the window sill are other nods to the theme.\n\nLook Up! Disney Nursery Idea\n\nPhoto: @mydisneyfinds\n\nThis ceiling mural is an absolutely brilliant way to spread a little Disney magic in Baby’s room. The adjacent hot air balloons are a further nod to one of the modern Pixar classics, Up.\n\nWhat Always Goes With Disney…\n\nNo matter if you go all out with Mickey and Minnie every which way or keep it subtle with a boho-meets-Nemo, the SNOO Smart Sleeper will seamlessly blend...with style to spare! Bonus: SNOO has been shown to add 1 to 2 hours of sleep a night for babies...and their tired parents!\n\nMore Nursery Ideas:\n\nSafari Nursery Ideas\n\nBoy Nursery Ideas\n\nGirl Nursery Ideas\n\nPink Nursery Ideas\n\nNursery Wallpaper\n\nView more posts tagged, nursery themes\n\nDisclaimer: The information on our site is NOT medical advice for any specific person or condition.
