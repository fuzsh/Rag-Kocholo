        "text": "Image Notes\n\nOutside my back door growing up was literally hundreds of miles of what some people would call “a whole lot of nothing”. It felt like I lived on the edge of the frontier because, well, we did. Miles and miles of unexplored rocks and hills, cliffs and ravines with animals as dangerous and scary as the stories we heard. Wyoming was still considered “The Wild Frontier”. So of course we had to go exploring. Taking our best friends and heading out on a great adventure was how we passed the time.\n\nExploring the wild jungle with Mickey and friends is meant to bring back those thrills of knowing mischief is around every corner followed by certain danger with a dash of doom and just enough hope to know that everybody’s going to be OK. Mickey and friends show that If you can laugh, be daring and trust in each other, life can be a great adventure.\n\nKey Points\n\nEyes peer out of the temple ruins in the background. How many sets of eyes do you see?\n\nThe lush jungle vegetation supports a variety of creatures great and small, including a chameleon, a variety of insects, a snake, birds, monkeys, and even a leopard and an elephant!\n\nDonning classic safari gear, Mickey and Minnie, Goofy, Pluto, and Donald Duck and Daisy Duck take in the bold and awe-inspiring sights of the jungle.\n\nHow many monkeys can you find?\n\nWhimsical details hide throughout the painting, including a beetle grasping onto a soccer ball, a leopard taking a cat nap, and toucan listening to his favorite tunes.\n\nFeatures"
