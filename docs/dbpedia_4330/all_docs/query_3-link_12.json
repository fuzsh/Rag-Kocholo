        "text": "Today is Mickey Mouse’s 91st birthday, and even after all those years he remains the most iconic Disney character for generations of fans. Over the years, Mickey has inspired a wide variety of artists to create their own interpretations of his iconic appearance, ranging from official Disney fine art pieces to the amateur and often off-model murals that appear on walls and building the world over. It is the later type of artwork that inspired the Imagineers behind Disney’s Animal Kingdom to create their own, which can be found near the entrance to “Harambe Market.” Given that this area of the park is meant to feel like a modern African town, this unique mural serves as a more authentic way of incorporating Disney’s biggest star into its design without being intrusive to the story.\n\nIn addition to a picture of Mickey Mouse, the wall is also decorated with the phrase “Fichwa! Fellow,” which is a subtle reference to a signature Disney Parks Easter egg. The word “fichwa” in Swahili means “hidden,” as a nod to the tradition of Imagineers hiding Hidden Mickeys throughout Walt Disney World and the other Disney Destinations as a way of recognizing that it was all started by a mouse. The “Fichwa Fellow” wall has also garnered extra attention as a favorite backdrop for Instagramers, much like Magic Kingdom’s Purple Wall and Epcot’s Bubblegum Wall. Given that it has become an attraction unto itself for a subset of Disney guests, it would be not entirely accurate to call this Mickey hidden, but it’s still a great reminder of the worldwide appeal of this beloved character."
