        "text": "There are some new construction walls in the Morocco Pavilion as Disney continues to put their own touch on the pavilion after a third-party operator lost control after financial woes. Disney has made some wonderful updates to the pavilion and new construction walls signal that the work isn’t over yet.\n\nAs you can see in the photos below, the back third of the pavilion is walled off to guests, but doesn’t impact any current offerings as Restaurant Marrakesh was already closed due to COVID-19.\n\nWhile the construction and investment is certainly exciting to see, it might just come at the expense of what Disney fans consider to be a suggestive chimney. Here’s a look at the area before construction walls were installed.\n\nAs you can see in the photos below, the chimney is the only portion of the construction area that currently has scaffolding. At this point, it’s too early in the project to know what Disney’s plans are, but it’s possible that Disney could be looking to remove the structure…or even modify or repaint it. It is attached to the existing building, and scaffolding likely signals that whatever work is taking place will likely require access to the full chimney."
