        "text": "Who will ever forget Pete from the Disney Mickey Mouse Clubhouse? His famous line, \"No one messes with the mighty Pete!\" is certainly one to remember.\n\nHe's the one responsible for making the entire Disney Mickey Mouse Universe series more lively and exciting with his signature antics.\n\nIf you're wondering exactly what is Pete from Mickey Mouse, check out this in-depth guide we've prepared for you.\n\nWhat Kind Of Animal Is Pete From Mickey Mouse?\n\nIn Disney Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, Pete is an anthropomorphic cat, and he was created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks [1].\n\nHe is also considered the vile villain and arch-nemesis in the series.\n\nDespite being a feline character, Pete is mistaken for a dog most of the time due to his massive size.\n\nAdditionally, he has gone by several names like Big Bad Pete, Black Pete, Terrible Tom, and the infamous Peg Leg Pete.\n\nWho Is Pete From Mickey Mouse?\n\nHistory\n\nDid you know Pete is one of the oldest continuing Walt Disney characters [2]?\n\nPete made his first appearance in the cartoon Alice Solves the Puzzle (1925) and in the Disney show Steamboat Willie.\n\nAdditionally, Pete from the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse was first designed by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston as a bullish strongman with a wooden leg inspired by pirate iconography.\n\nHe has received his own Bad Guy Song (Hall of the Mountain King) and is usually mistaken for being a dog due to his massive body size and strong personality.\n\nPeteâ€™s Relationship With Mickey Mouse\n\nPete (another name, Peg Leg Pete) of the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse is Mickey Mouse's arch nemesis in the Disney show Steamboat Willie, who is often mistaken for a dog.\n\nPete, along with other villains like Big Bad Wolf, The Phantom Blot, Dangerous Dan, and Idgit the Midget, made the series exciting and crackling as they taunted Mickey's family members.\n\nAge\n\nBelieve it or not, Pete may be way older than you. He has been on the air since the 1920s until today, making him one of the oldest classic cartoon characters of all time.\n\nSince Pete debuted three years earlier than Mickey (1925), we can conclude that he is way older than him.\n\nAs of today, Mickey is 95 years old. Hence, Pete is 98 years old, making him the oldest character in Disney.\n\nYou may want to check out some of our favorite Mickey Mouse gifts here.\n\nPersonality\n\nPete Disney is a villainous cat character created by Disney and Ub Iwerks, particularly in Steamboat Willie.\n\nHe has a brutal, ruthless, and tyrannical personality and is commonly known as a cigar-smoking thug that makes him look like a dog (which he is not).\n\nAside from that, his frequent scheme involves kidnapping Minnie Mouse but his other crimes and victims vary throughout the years.\n\nPhysical Description\n\nPete is an obese black cat (again, not a dog) having a cream-shaven muzzle, pointed ears, black nose, square teeth, double chin, and black fur.\n\nAside from that, he's always seen wearing a light blue shirt with rolled-up sleeves, blue overalls with white buttons, white gloves, and brown shoes.\n\nAppearances\n\nTV Series\n\nPete appeared in some TV series, including DuckTales, Goof Troop, House of Mouse, and Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.\n\nPete also appeared in a short film that includes The Prince and the Pauper and Get a Horse!\n\nRead: Our Top Minnie Mouse Gift Ideas\n\nMovies\n\nPete has made appearances in more than 40 animated short films. He has also been featured in the Alice Comedies and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons.\n\nHe also appeared in movies like A Goofy Movie, An Extremely Goofy Movie, Mickey's Once Upon A Christmas, Mickey's House of Villains, and The Three Musketeers.\n\nWe can say for certain that he's an in-demand Disney character.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat kind of cat is Pete from Mickey Mouse?\n\nPete from Disney Mickey Mouse is an anthropomorphic cat who has been a villainous character since his debut in Alice Solves the Puzzle.\n\nThroughout the Disney Mickey Mouse Clubhouse series and other animated movies from Disney, Pete lived up to his character as a ruthless tyrant and was always up for trouble.\n\nAdditionally, his descendants were criminals; even Zeke (Pete's cousin) supports and partners with him in his crimes.\n\nWho is the voice behind Pete from Mickey Mouse?\n\nMany actors lent their voices to Pete, including Pinto Colvig (Cactus Kid), Billy Bletcher, John McLeish (Bellboy Donald), Jim Cummings, and Katsuhiro Kitagawa (Japanese).\n\nIn the 80s, Will Ryan supplied Pete's voice in Disney projects like Mickey's Christmas Carol, Down and Out with Donald Duck, and DuckTales.\n\nThis was until Jimmy Cummings became the official voice actor of Pete.\n\nIn Summary\n\nPete is not a new character from Disney, as he made his first appearance in Alice Solves the Puzzle in 1925.\n\nAlthough he was often mistaken for a dog, Pete from the Disney Mickey Mouse Clubhouse is actually a cat.\n\nDisney introduced him as a dominating character to make him appear the bad guy throughout the series, but don't you deny it - he left you crackling and pissed off at the same time.\n\nIf you're looking for a gift for a Mickey Mouse fan, check out this adorable mood light featuring Mickey.\n\nToynk offers free shipping within the U.S. (not including Hawaii and Alaska) and hassle-free payment methods.\n\nReferences:"
