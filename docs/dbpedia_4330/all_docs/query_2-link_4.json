        "text": "\"Racing Rivals\" is the first segment of the thirtieth episode of Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures. It premiered on June 22, 2018 alongside \"The Hapless Helpers\", and is the first segment of the fourth episode in the second season.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nMinnie comes up with a special non-roadster race involving the racers' Daily Drivers, which includes her visiting childhood friend Maggie (Jennifer Cody). If the Daily Driver is turned into a Roadster, the racer is out of the race. However, Daisy is worried that Minnie and Maggie will compete with each other when situations force the other racers to use the Roadsters to get out of a situation.\n\nGoofs[]\n\nIt is shown that Donald's daily driver can't float in the water when he ended up driving into the lake. But in \"Hot Dog Daze Afternoon\", Donald's daily driver was able to float in the water without sinking."
