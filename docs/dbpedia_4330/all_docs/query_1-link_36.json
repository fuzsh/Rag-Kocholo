        "text": "Chicago apartment renters don't just lease an apartment — they lease a neighborhood. So Domu has compiled this list of famous Chicago restaurants operating in Chicago's neighborhoods for 50 years or longer. It's part of our ongoing effort to educate our Chicago tenants about the neighborhoods in which they live. We figure if you can keep it going for 50 years, you must be doing something right, even if, as in the case of Jimmy's Red Hots (founded 1954), the entire menu consists of Polish sausage, a hot dog, a tamale, french fries, and soda.\n\nSo have a look, take a bite (or several), and then let us know if these classic Chicago restaurants still have the magic after half a century of doing business in Chicago apartments.\n\n1892 — Daley's Restaurant\n\nEnglewood\n\nJohn Daley moved from Ireland to Chicago and found a job working on constructing the elevated train lines developed for the Columbian Exposition, among other things. The young ironworker decided that the Woodlawn neighborhood needed a dining establishment to feed his fellow workers, so in 1892, he opened Daley's Restaurant at 803 East 63rd Street in the Englewood neighborhood. In 1918, he sold the business to two young Greek immigrants, Tom Kyros and Paul Emmanuel (which explains why the sign outside the restaurant says \"since 1918\").\n\nTom worked as a waiter and Paul as the cook. Together, they operated the restaurant until 1932, when they demolished the building, intending to construct a more extensive, better Daley's Restaurant. Unfortunately, their bank failed in the middle of the construction, leaving nothing but a big hole in the ground. By 1937, Tom and Paul had accumulated enough money from other jobs to complete the long-stalled project, and the eatery returned as the \"New Daley's Restaurant.\"\n\nThe business remained in the family even after Tom and Paul retired, and the restaurant went through a series of expansions in the 1960s that returned it to its original size. Today, it's the oldest restaurant in Chicago. Trivia buffs will be happy to know that Muhammad Ali frequently ate here between training sessions at any one of many local gyms.\n\n1898 — The Berghoff\n\nChicago Loop\n\nHerman Joseph Berghoff founded a brewery in Indiana and sold his beer at the Columbian Exposition (otherwise known as the World's Fair) in 1893. He opened a men's-only salon at 17 West Adams Street and served free corned beef sandwiches to patrons who purchased a stein of beer. Upon the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, the Berghoff was awarded Chicago's first two liquor licenses, one for the bar and one for the restaurant, and each is hanging on the wall in the dining room today. It wasn't until the repeal of Prohibition that the Berghoff became a \"full restaurant.\" The bar (as opposed to the restaurant) remained a men's-only hangout until 1969 when seven members of the National Organization of Women (Gloria Steinem included) sat down at the counter and demanded service. At the time, Herman Berghoff (from the third generation of the family) was allegedly so fearful of an encounter with the women that he spent the entire time hiding in his office. He did, however, consent to their being served.\n\nThe restaurant is now in its fourth generation of family ownership and is operated by Carlyn Berghoff. It is the second-oldest restaurant in the city. Diners enjoy traditional German and modern American fare, and root beer has always been a favorite (a tradition dating back to the Prohibition era).\n\nBy the way, movie buffs will be glad to know that Gotham cops arrested many gangsters inside the Berghoff in The Dark Knight.\n\n1907 — The Walnut Room\n\nChicago Loop\n\nThe Walnut Room at 111 North State Street has served hungry shoppers at Marshall Field's (and now Macy's) since 1907. Back then, there were no local dining options for women, so one of the clerks in the millinery department, a certain \"Mrs. Hering,\" baked homemade chicken pot pies and brought them in to keep her clientele from defecting when suffering from hunger pangs. These same chicken pot pies remain on the menu today. The cavernous 17,000 square-foot, seventh-floor restaurant features walls constructed with Circassian wood imported from Russia and chandeliers fabricated with original Austrian crystal. During the holidays, the Great Tree is a monumental attraction. It approaches 50 feet in height and contains about 19,000 lights. Dining under the Great Tree has been a longtime Chicago tradition, and some groups have been coming for 60 or more years in a row. The annual spring flower show is another major attraction in the Walnut Room.\n\n1908 — Cafe Brauer\n\nLincoln Park\n\nCafe Brauer at 2021 North Stockton Drive (also known as the South Pond Refectory) has served Chicagoans for over 50 years, though not consecutively. It was perched along the edge of the South Pond in Lincoln Park, on the grounds of the Lincoln Park Zoo; the cafe initially opened in 1908 in a classic, elegant, highly acclaimed, prairie-style building designed by Dwight H. Perkins. Originally commissioned by the Brauer family, the restaurant was one of the most popular eateries in Chicago in the early twentieth century. It gradually declined following the repeal of Prohibition, partly because state law forbids the service of alcoholic beverages in public parks. Cafe Brauer ultimately closed in 1941 and remained dormant for nearly 50 years while the building served as a storage facility for the zoo. After years of community efforts to revive it, a renovated Cafe Brauer reopened in January 1990. Its stunning, expansive reception hall has become popular as an event space and has served as a beautiful backdrop to exchanging many vows. In the summer, zoogoers and other passersby can enjoy a nice meal on the patio adjacent to the cafe, at the brink of the recently restored lagoon.\n\n1909 — Pompei Bakery\n\nUniversity Village\n\nLuigi Davino established Pompei Bakery back in 1909 at 1531 West Taylor Street. He named his restaurant \"Pompei\" because of its proximity to the Our Lady of Pompeii Church (which, like the bakery, remains active today). Luigi, his wife, his four sons, and his daughter lived above the bakery, and the entire family participated in the pizza-making operations. (In the early years, they exclusively served cheese pizza.)\n\nAfter the Davino boys returned from the Second World War in 1944, they helped Luigi run the business. Today, members of the fourth generation of the Davino family are involved in running the operation, which has since expanded to include several locations in the Chicagoland area.\n\n1921 — Margie's Candies\n\nHumboldt Park\n\nThe \"Security Sweet Shop\" was founded in 1921 by a Greek immigrant named Peter George Poulos. Peter soon handed off the operations to his son George, who renamed the confectionery \"Margie's Candies\" in honor of his wife, whom he met at the store during his youth. Margie managed the shop at 1960 North Western Avenue in Humboldt Park during the Second World War while George served in the armed forces.\n\nShe ultimately assumed complete control in 1954 after George passed away from an ulcer. A widow for the next four decades, Margie ran the legendary local restaurant and candy shop until she died in 1995 when her son Peter assumed complete control of the business. Al Capone is said to have been a frequent patron, although Margie's \"fab\" moment arrived in 1965 when the Beatles dropped in with five girls after a concert at Comiskey Park and ordered several six-scoop \"Atomic Sundaes.\"\n\nSince then, the interior has been abundantly adorned with Beatles memorabilia, which complements the original Tiffany lamps, the marble soda fountain, and the old-fashioned booths with miniature jukeboxes. (By the way, the Rolling Stones have been here too.) In 2005, Margie's son Peter opened a second location in the North Center neighborhood.\n\n1921 — Valois\n\nHyde Park\n\nValois (pronounced \"Valleys\" by the locals) has been serving up heaping portions for bargain prices since 1921. The cafeteria-style eatery was initially opened at 55th Street and Harper Avenue by William Valois, who previously worked as the chef at the Chicago Beach Hotel. Valois sold the business to Walter Allman in 1957, when the building was slated for demolition, and Allman kept hope alive by moving the restaurant to its present location at 1518 East 53rd Street.\n\nIn 1969, the restaurant changed hands again after Allman had a sudden heart attack and died. Open for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, Valois most recently achieved notoriety for being a favorite local destination of President Barack Obama, although Harold Washington was a regular too. The book \"slim's table: race, respectability, and masculinity,\" authored by Mitchell Duneier and published in 1992, chronicled African-American life in Chicago and was modeled on customers that Duneier encountered nearly every day over four years of eating at the restaurant.\n\nAs in yesteryear, patrons still grab trays and move down the cafeteria line where you can \"See Your Food\" (as the awning has proclaimed since Walter Allman first hung it in the late 1950s). Valois continues to serve meals to the entire Hyde Park demographic, from pensioners to professionals, but remember cash only.\n\n1921 — The Green Door Tavern\n\nRiver North\n\nAfter the Great Fire incinerated most of Chicago in 1871, a local engineer named James McCole built a two-story, balloon-frame wooden structure with a detached garage at the southwest corner of Huron and Orleans. A few months later, the city council passed an ordinance prohibiting the construction of wooden buildings in the downtown district, making McCole's structure one of the few remaining wooden structures built before the \"new\" law.\n\nIn 1921, Vito Giacomo opened a restaurant on the first floor, replacing a grocery store that had operated there for the preceding 49 years. The restaurant, known as \"The Green Door,\" snuck through the Prohibition era as a speakeasy (which explains its name). The building tilts slightly toward the north because it began to settle into the Earth in the early 1900s.\n\nThe tavern has changed very little through the years and is peppered with \"bric-a-brac\" as antique signs, posters, photographs, and other nostalgia. The soapbox car hanging from the ceiling was once used in a race in which Illinois native and former United States President Ronald Reagan participated. Harry Caray was a frequent visitor, and one of his Budweiser commercials was filmed at 678 North Orleans Street.\n\n1923 — Lou Mitchell's\n\nChicago Loop\n\nWilliam Mitchell entered the restaurant business in 1923 by opening a diner named after his son, Lou. The entire Mitchell family was involved in the operation, and in 1949, the thriving eatery moved directly across the street to 565 West Jackson Street in the Loop, which continues to serve hungry patrons today.\n\nThe restaurant looks the same now as it did at its inception, both inside and out, and a neon sign trumpeting the \"world's best coffee\" remains in place from the beginning. Travel and trivia buffs may know that its proximity to the starting point of Route 66 caused it to be known as \"the first stop on the Mother Road.\" In 1958, Lou Mitchell, who had assumed control from his father, initiated the restaurant's signature tradition of serving donut holes and Milk Duds to waiting customers.\n\nLou continued to run the business until he was in his seventies, but as of 1992, his niece, Katherine Thanas, has overseen the operations. The restaurant claims Presidents Carter, Reagan, Bush (41), Clinton, Bush (43), and Obama have all eaten there.\n\n1924 — Lindy's Chili\n\nMcKinley Park\n\nLindy's Chili has been dishing it out to hungry Chicagoans at 3685 South Archer Avenue in McKinley Park since 1924. In 1974, Joe and John Yesutis purchased Lindy's Chili and Gertie's Ice Cream Company (a Chicago institution since 1901) and combined them into a single enterprise. They franchised the business in the 1980s but still hold the franchise rights.\n\nDiners have the luxury of a full menu, including sandwiches and burgers of all types, although Lindy's is renowned for its chili. As of this writing, there are ten Lindy's Chili and Gertie's Ice Cream locations in the Chicagoland area.\n\n1924 — Orange Garden\n\nNorth Center\n\nAt 1942 West Irving Park Avenue in North Center, Orange Garden is the oldest Chinese restaurant in Chicago. It opened for business in 1924, nearly a quarter of a century older than the People's Republic of China. However, it didn't adopt \"Orange Garden\" until 1932. The sign that hangs outside is the oldest neon light in the city. The clock that hangs inside has been on the wall since 1932. The frescoes were painted in 1944, and the restaurant, to preserve its heritage, follows a simple rule: \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" Ownership has changed hands only once, and the current owner was a family friend of the original owners.\n\nThough the online reviews tend to be all over the map, it's not easy to stay in business for nearly 100 years without doing something right, and there's no shortage of locals who swear by the food.\n\n1927 — Italian Village\n\nChicago Loop\n\nAlfredo Capitani was born in Sao Paolo, Brazil, but moved to Florence, Italy as a child. After serving in the Italian Army during the First World War, he emigrated to the United States in 1924 to escape Benito Mussolini's fascist regime. He settled in Chicago and found work as a dishwasher before opening the Italian Village restaurant at 71 West Monroe Street in the Loop neighborhood of Chicago in 1927. His authentic Italian eatery is now the oldest Italian restaurant in the city.\n\nCapitanini's kitchen was trendy among performers at the Lyric Opera, which counted Alfredo's wife, Ada, among its loyal patrons. Therefore, it should be no surprise that Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo have dined here. Of course, the restaurant has also been immensely popular with other celebrities over the years, as the wall photographs demonstrate.\n\nFrank Sinatra held his wedding reception here. Al Capone (a celebrity of sorts) was a frequent diner. Barbra Streisand took her first meal in Chicago here, and such rock 'n' rollers as Bon Jovi and the band \"Kiss\" have been known to eat here. And, yes, local Chicago politicians have always been all over this place.\n\nThe Italian Village continues to be renowned for its extensive wine list, and the restaurant's design remains unchanged. The booths are named after different places in the \"village,\" including the library, the convent, the hospital, and the jail. The rotating water wheel and twinkling lights on the ceiling are still here.\n\nIn 1955, Alfredo Capitanini opened La Cantina (a steak and seafood house) on the lower level, notable for its long, dark, narrow wine cellar decor and cozy booths. He passed away in 1988, but the restaurant remains in the third generation of his family today.\n\n1931 — Tufano's Vernon Park Tap\n\nUniversity Village\n\nJoseph and Theresa (Tufano) DiBuono opened Tufano's Vernon Park Tap in 1931 at 1073 West Vernon Park Place in the heart of Little Italy's golden age, long before the University of Illinois crashed the neighborhood. Theresa, the family matriarch, used to live right next door. She would cook the meals from her kitchen and then pass the plates through an interior window connected to the restaurant. That tiny opening still exists today.\n\nThroughout the years, Tufano's has been a favorite dining spot for celebrities of Italian origin, such as Frank Sinatra (would you have guessed anyone else?), although Chicagoans of all ethnicities have enjoyed this classic red-sauce experience, including, most notably, novelist and northside Nelson Algren, who made the joint a habit before White Sox games.\n\nThe James Beard Foundation designated Tufano's one of \"America's classic restaurants\" in 2008. Today, it's owned and operated by Joey DiBuono, grandson of the founders, although many other family members continue to work there. Joey says he recognizes most of his customers, an added touch that contributes significantly to its ambiance and success.\n\n1932 — Twin Anchors\n\nOld Town\n\nTwin Anchors arguably enjoys more notoriety than any other restaurant in Chicago. Since 1932, it has served its famous brand of baby back ribs to everyone from humble neighbors to international celebrities, including its most famous \"regular,\" Frank Sinatra. With its nautical theme and cozy decor, the restaurant has been cooking ribs from the same building since its inception: a three-story brick edifice built in 1881 and served as a brewery for some time before the First World War at 1655 North Sedgwick Street.\n\nTwo major motion pictures captured the ambiance of the restaurant (\"Return To Me\" and \"The Dark Knight\"); Conan O'Brien listed the restaurant as one of his ten \"must-haves;\" the HBO drama \"Boardwalk Empire\" selected the Twin Anchors for its \"Speakeasy Tour\" documentary, and Emeril Lagasse showcased the restaurant on his television show \"The Originals With Emeril.\"\n\n1932 — Vito & Nick's Pizzeria\n\nAshburn\n\nVito and Mary Barraco, natives of Sicily, opened a small tavern near downtown Chicago in 1923. They opened \"Vito's Tavern\" nine years later at 80th and Halsted. In 1939, they moved the tavern to 79th and Carpenter, adding table service and a menu of Italian-style sandwiches. After their son, Nick, returned from the Army at the end of the Second World War, they added cracker-thin pizza and a wider variety of home-cooked meals.\n\nThe restaurant was now known as \"Vito and Nick's,\" and the pizza soon became a Southside Chicago sensation. On June 25, 1965, Vito and Nick's moved to 84th and Pulaski, at 8433 South Pulaski, in the Ashburn neighborhood of Chicago, where it remains today. In its third generation, the Chicago restaurant remains famous for its crunchy, thin-crust pizza, featuring popular toppings such as Italian beef or eggs with deep-fried pepperoni and other traditional Italian fare.\n\nLocated in a nondescript brick building with an Italian tricolor awning, the pizzeria retains its authentic family feel with plenty of tables and ample seating at the bar. Nick passed away in 2002, and his daughter, Rosemary George, runs the show today. Rosemary's brother Nick now operates Vito & Nick II, although the pizzerias are no longer related\n\n1933 — Bruna's\n\nPilsen\n\nBruna Cani, also known as \"Bella Bruna,\" opened this restaurant in 1933 in a neighborhood rich with immigrants from the Tuscany region of Italy. Bruna, who would dance at the bar to delight her hungry patrons, continued to dish out Italian fare until illness forced her to retire in 1981.\n\nAt that time, she sold the restaurant to Luciano Silvestri, a fellow native of Tuscany who, like Bruna, specializes in northern Italian cuisine. Since it first opened, the restaurant has been operating in the same location, at 2424 South Oakley Avenue in Pilsen.\n\nOver the years, many celebrities and dignitaries had dined here, including Harrison Ford, Richard Gere, Tommy Lasorda, Cardinal Bernadine, all the Daley brothers, and Dennis Farina. As of February 2012, Bruna's 93-year-old daughter was still the landlord of the building. He lived a few blocks away while still a police detective.\n\n1934 –– The Burwood Tap\n\nLincoln Park\n\nThe Burwood Tap is a historic bar located in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago. Known for its friendly atmosphere, classic dive bar charm, and deep ties to the local community, the Burwood Tap has been a beloved watering hole for generations of Chicagoans.\n\nThe Burwood Tap was established in 1933, the same year Prohibition ended in the United States. Located at 724 West Wrightwood Avenue, the bar was originally known as Burwood Bar, named after its proximity to Burwood Avenue, a street that no longer exists in Chicago. The bar quickly became a local favorite, offering a welcoming environment where patrons could enjoy a drink and socialize.\n\nIn recent years, the Burwood Tap has continued to thrive, adapting to the changing landscape of the bar and restaurant industry while maintaining its classic appeal. The bar offers a selection of beers, cocktails, and bar food, including burgers, wings, and other pub favorites. The addition of modern amenities, such as flat-screen TVs for watching sports, has helped attract a diverse crowd while keeping loyal regulars coming back.\n\n1934 –– Kelly's Pub\n\nLincoln Park\n\nKelly's Pub, a historic bar in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood, has been a beloved fixture since it opened in 1933. Known for its friendly atmosphere, rich history, and strong ties to the local community, Kelly's Pub has become an iconic destination for locals and visitors alike.\n\nKelly's Pub was established in 1933, coinciding with the end of Prohibition in the United States. The bar was opened by James \"Jimmy\" Kelly, an Irish immigrant who saw an opportunity to create a welcoming neighborhood pub. Located at 949 West Webster Avenue, Kelly's Pub quickly became a popular spot for local residents, offering a friendly environment where patrons could enjoy a drink and socialize.\n\nKelly's Pub is known for its warm, inviting atmosphere and classic Irish pub decor. The interior features dark wood paneling, vintage memorabilia, and a cozy fireplace, creating a nostalgic and comfortable setting. The bar's unpretentious vibe and friendly staff have made it a popular spot for a diverse clientele, including local residents, college students, and tourists.\n\nIn recent years, Kelly's Pub has continued to thrive, adapting to the changing landscape of the bar and restaurant industry while maintaining its classic appeal. The pub has embraced modern amenities, such as flat-screen TVs for watching sports, and has expanded its drink menu to include craft beers and contemporary cocktails. These updates have helped attract new patrons while keeping loyal regulars returning.\n\n1934 –– Coq d'Or\n\nGold Coast\n\nCoq d'Or, a historic bar and restaurant in The Drake Hotel in Chicago, has been a beloved fixture of the city's Gold Coast neighborhood since it opened in 1933. Known for its rich history, elegant ambiance, and classic cocktails, Coq d'Or has long been a favorite destination for both locals and visitors seeking a taste of Chicago's storied past.\n\nCoq d'Or opened its doors on December 6, 1933, the day after Prohibition was repealed in the United States. The bar was among the first in Chicago to receive a liquor license, and it quickly became a popular spot for those eager to celebrate the end of Prohibition. Located within The Drake Hotel at 140 East Walton Place, Coq d'Or offered an elegant and inviting setting for patrons to enjoy their newfound freedom to drink legally.\n\nThe ambiance of Coq d'Or is one of timeless elegance and sophistication. The bar's interior features dark wood paneling, leather banquettes, and brass accents, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The dim lighting and live piano music add to the bar's nostalgic charm, making it an ideal spot for intimate gatherings and special occasions.\n\nWhile Coq d'Or has maintained much of its original charm, it has also adapted to modern times. The bar attracts a diverse clientele, from longtime patrons to curious newcomers. In recent years, Coq d'Or has updated its menu and drink offerings to include contemporary options while preserving its classic favorites.\n\n1934 –– Jake's Pub\n\nLakeview\n\nJake's Pub, a classic dive bar in Chicago's Lakeview neighborhood, has been a beloved local watering hole since it opened its doors in 1933. Known for its friendly atmosphere, extensive beer selection, and rich history, Jake's Pub has become a staple for both locals and visitors looking for an authentic Chicago bar experience.\n\nJake's Pub was established in 1933, the same year Prohibition ended in the United States. Located at 2932 North Clark Street, the bar quickly became a popular spot for those eager to enjoy a drink legally for the first time in over a decade. The founder, Jake Klonowski, aimed to create a welcoming and unpretentious environment where patrons could relax, socialize, and enjoy good drinks.\n\nJake's Pub has always been more than just a place to drink; it has been an integral part of the Lakeview community. The bar regularly hosts events, fundraisers, and parties, reinforcing its role as a neighborhood hub. Its proximity to DePaul University has also made it a popular spot for students and alumni, fostering a strong connection with the university community.\n\nLike many long-standing establishments, Jake's Pub has faced its share of challenges, including economic downturns and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these obstacles, the bar has remained resilient, thanks to its loyal customer base and dedicated staff. The sense of community and continuity that Jake's Pub offers has been a key factor in its enduring success.\n\n1934 — The Billy Goat Tavern\n\nRiver North\n\nThe Billy Goat Tavern has easily achieved more notoriety than any burger joint in Chicago history. Initially opened in the shadow of the old Chicago Stadium by the eccentric William (Billy) Sianis in either 1934 or 1937, it gained its first blast of publicity in 1944 when Billy hung a sign saying, \"No Republicans Allowed\" during the Republican National Convention. The following year, the Billy Goat Tavern became indelibly and supernaturally entangled in the city's sports history. Before the fourth game of the 1945 World Series, with the Cubs leading the Detroit Tigers two games to one, Sianis attempted to bring his pet billy goat into Wrigley Field but was turned away, allegedly by William Wrigley himself and allegedly because the goat smelled terrible.\n\nSianis, angry and upset, retaliated by purporting to place a curse on the Cubs, vowing they would never return to the World Series again. The hapless northsiders lost the 1945 affair and, ostensibly because of the \"Curse of the Billy Goat,\" have not returned since, despite being painfully close on several occasions. Some observers of paranormal activity insist that the curse reared its ugly head in the form of a black cat tiptoeing past Hall-Of-Famer Ron Santo at Shea Stadium shortly before the Cubs blew a monumental first-place lead during the 1969 season. Other mediums of the supernatural claim that the curse caused a routine ground ball to pass unobstructed through Leon Durham's legs in the 1984 National League Championship Series.\n\nStill, other psychic observers assert that the curse reappeared as Steve Bartman in 2003. The Billy Goat Tavern relocated to 430 North Michigan Avenue (Lower Level) of Michigan Avenue in 1964. It soon became a favorite lunching spot for journalists at the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times, most notably Mike Royko. Bill Murray, a frequent diner, made the Billy Goat Tavern the subject of a famous Saturday Night Live sketch in which the proprietors famously shouted, \"Cheezborger, cheezborger, cheezborger!\" and replied, \"No Coke. Pepsi.\" (Or \"No Fries. Chips.\") Today, several additional BIlly Goat locations around the city, \"No Pepsi. Coke.\"\n\n1935 — Miller's Pub\n\nChicago Loop\n\nIn 1950, Miller's Pub was a dark, no-frills saloon and a reputed front for a mob-run bookmaking operation, so naturally, it fell on hard times following a police raid. The Miller brothers, who originally opened the dusty joint in 1935, were looking to sell when Pete, Nick, and Jimmy Gallios emerged to create a lively eatery from a dreary pub.\n\nSons of working-class Greek immigrants, the Gallios brothers, couldn't afford to commission a new sign after sinking their life savings into the acquisition, so the name \"Miller's Pub\" remained on the door. The brothers were not strangers to the restaurant business, having all worked for Gus Sianis at the original Billy Goat Tavern on Madison Street.\n\nLocated (back then) at 23 East Adams, Miller's Pub gradually expanded, even taking in a fourth Gallios brother, Vannie, as a partner. Soon, it became a popular celebrity hangout, catering to all entertainers and ballplayers, White Sox and Cubs alike. Bill Veeck became a close friend of the Gallios family, and there were occasions when practically all of the White Sox could be found at the restaurant. Veeck remarked that Miller's Pub is \"one of the four or five best saloons I've ever been in, and I have spent a great deal of my life in saloons.\"\n\nPhotographs of the many celebrity regulars through the years, including Jimmy Durante, Tony Bennett, George Burns, Jack Benny, and Rocky Marciano, continue to adorn the walls. Following a kitchen fire, the restaurant moved to 134 South Wabash, just around the block, in 1989, where it remains a Chicago Loop institution.\n\n1938 — Al's No. 1 Italian Beef\n\nTri-Taylor\n\nIn 1938, a first-generation Italian-American named Albert Ferrerri opened an outdoor stand at Laflin and Harrison Streets and began serving Italian beef and sausages cooked over a charcoal grill. It was largely a front for a horse racing and baseball bookmaking business, but after the cops busted up the gambling ring, the sandwich-making operations continued unabated.\n\nIn 1963, Albert and his brother-in-law Christopher Pacelli split the business in two and opened their own separate \"Al's Barbeque\" restaurants in the neighborhood. Pacelli's joint opened at 1079 West Taylor Street in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago, and in the 1980's it was renamed \"Al's No. 1 Italian Beef.\" Meanwhile, Albert Ferrerri, who remained a gambler and a hustler his whole life, passed away in 2001 at 90.\n\n1938 — Frances' Deli\n\nLincoln Park\n\nAs the deco sign says outside the restaurant, Frances' Deli has been serving meals to hungry diners since 1938. Now located a few blocks north of its original hole-in-the-wall location at 2552 North Clark Street, Frances fancies herself a delicatessen. Yes, there are heaping, traditional deli-type sandwiches, and such ethnic delights as fried matzoh and matzoh-ball soup.\n\nDespite the challenges many small businesses face, Frances' Deli has remained resilient. It continues to be family-operated, focusing on preserving the traditions and recipes that have made it a beloved institution. The deli has adapted over the years, embracing changes while maintaining the core values that customers have come to love. However, a New York-style delicatessen atmosphere is not the schtick here—still, the menu veers profoundly into modern American fare.\n\nWith its rich history, delicious food, and strong community ties, it remains a cherished part of Chicago's culinary landscape. Whether you're a longtime local or a visitor looking for an authentic deli experience, Frances' Deli offers a warm welcome and a taste of history in every bite.\n\n1939 — Blackie's Restaurant & Tavern\n\nPrinter's Row\n\nNo, Blackie's Restaurant & Tavern at 755 South Clark Street has absolutely no relation to, or affiliation with, the bankrupt \"Boston Blackie's,\" a burger joint of far more recent vintage whose owner was apprehended while fleeing the country in the wake of a two million dollar check-kiting scheme. This particular Blackie's has been around since 1939 and has no apparent history of dust-ups with the law.\n\nAs the story goes, Alex Dimilio opened the restaurant and asked his friend, bandleader Jimmy Dorsey, to help him make it a destination for Hollywood stars arriving at Dearborn Station across the street. Dorsey agreed on the condition that Dimilio would hire a kid whose nickname was \"Blackie\" (because the irises of his eyes were pitch black). Dimilio obliged, even naming the restaurant after the guy and making him the maitre d'. Over the course of the ensuing decades, Blackie's served meals to luminaries such as Tony Bennett, Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, Frank Sinatra, Elizabeth Taylor, Betty Gable, the Marx Brothers, and the Three Stooges.\n\nDuring a whistle-stop on his 1948 presidential campaign, Harry S. Truman reportedly stopped by and sang \"The Missouri Waltz.\" Even after Dearborn Station closed, St. Peter's Church was demolished, and many of the nearby printing companies fled the neighborhood, the restaurant forged on, seemingly nonplussed. Sometime in the 1970s, Dimilio's grandson, Jeffrey Thomas, acquired and rehabbed the place, and, today, in a revitalized Printer's Row, it is still going strong.\n\n1939 — White Palace Grill\n\nSouth Loop\n\nSince 1939, the White Palace Grill at 1159 South Canal Street in Chicago's South Loop neighborhood has been dishing out down-home, diner-style food 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. When the restaurant was featured on \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives,\" owner George Liakopolous told Guy Fieri that the front doors have locks only because city code requires it. He never obtained a key when he purchased the diner several years earlier.\n\nLike many long-standing businesses, White Palace Grill has faced challenges over the years, including economic downturns and changes in the dining industry. Despite these challenges, the diner has remained resilient, continuously adapting while staying true to its roots. The diner maintains its classic decor, featuring vintage booths, a long counter, and an old-school vibe that evokes a sense of nostalgia.\n\nThe menu remains the same throughout the day: eggs for dinner and short ribs for breakfast (if that's what tickles your fancy). The patrons represent every conceivable demographic, and the food (including the sauces) is prepared by hand at the restaurant.\n\n1939 – Jim's Original\n\nUniversity Village\n\nFrom 1939 to 2001, Jim's Original was a mainstay at the once-bustling corner of Maxwell and Halsted Streets. Still, the expansion of the University of Illinois-Chicago ultimately pushed it out of the rapidly-changing neighborhood. A purveyor of juicy and delicious Polish sausage sandwiches (served by default with grilled onions and mustard only), it was opened by the eponymous \"Jimmy,\" who originally acquired the location from his aunt.\n\nThe business flourished even after the Maxwell Street neighborhood descended into a patch of urban blight. Jimmy, who apparently escaped both the Bolshevik Revolution and the rise of Nazism, died in 1976 but passed the business off to Gus Christopoulos, who passed it down to his son, conveniently named Jim. Although Jim's Original can now be found along the west side of the Dan Ryan Expressway at 1250 South Union Avenue, the original can still be nostalgically admired in the background of the \"Blues Brothers\" movie. (And, no, Jim's Original is unrelated to Jimmy's Red Hots. That's why Jim likes to remind everyone that he's \"Jim's Original.\") Customers are known for being \"regulars,\" including Ernie Banks and Lovie Smith.\n\n1939 — Hackney's\n\nGlenview\n\nHackney's story begins in 1939, when Jim and Kitz Masterson opened the first Hackney's location in a small house on Harms Road in Glenview, Illinois. The name \"Hackney's\" was chosen after a town in England where Jim had spent some time. The restaurant quickly gained a reputation for its warm, welcoming atmosphere and delicious homemade food, particularly burgers.\n\nAs Hackney's popularity grew, so did the number of locations. In the 1940s and 1950s, additional Hackney's restaurants were opened, including the notable Hackney's on Lake in Glenview, which became a favorite for its spacious outdoor seating and family-friendly environment. With its big white columns and charming patio, this location became the perfect place for large gatherings and celebrations.\n\nToday, Hackney's operates multiple locations, including Hackney's on Harms, Hackney's on Lake in Glenview, and Hackney's in Palos Park. While some locations have closed over the years, the remaining restaurants continue to uphold the traditions that have made Hackney's a beloved institution. The menu has evolved to include a variety of contemporary dishes, but the classic burgers and onion loaf remain as popular as ever.\n\n1940 — Marie's Pizza & Liquors\n\nMayfair\n\nMarie's Pizza & Liquors at 4127 West Lawrence Avenue has been serving it up at Mayfair Street corner since 1940. In its third generation of ownership, this \"old school\" Chicago institution has more than a fair share of groupies claiming this is the best destination for thin crust pizza in the city. The decor hasn't changed (ever), the waitstaff has been fixtures for decades, and live music can still be heard several days a week.\n\nThe success of Marie's Pizza & Liquors can be largely attributed to the Accardi family's dedication to quality and tradition. The business remained family-owned and operated, with each generation upholding the values and recipes that Ed and Marie established. This commitment to family and tradition has fostered a sense of continuity and community among the restaurant's patrons.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Marie's is its nostalgic, old-school ambiance. The decor has remained unchanged since the restaurant's early days, featuring vintage furnishings, cozy booths, and retro signage. This timeless atmosphere has become a significant draw for customers, providing a charming escape from the hustle and bustle of modern life.\n\nMarie's becomes more famous for its decorations than its food during Christmas. The lights, the elves, the train tracks, and the festivity all create a magical atmosphere. Oddly enough, the restaurant is joined at the hip by a liquor store selling thousands of bottles of wine, among other spirits.\n\n1941 — Gene & Georgetti\n\nRiver North\n\nGene & Georgetti, Chicago's oldest steakhouse, has served prime cuts from the same historic location since 1941 at 500 North Franklin in River North. Gene Michelotti, an Italian emigre and avuncular host, and his chef friend, Alfredo Federighi (nicknamed \"Georgetti\" after a famed Italian cyclist), breathed life into their American dream in this wooden building, erected in 1872 shortly after the Great Fire.\n\nOver the decades, Gene & Georgetti became a favorite haunt for celebrities, politicians, and athletes. The restaurant's cozy, old-school atmosphere and consistent quality made it a go-to spot for high-profile patrons. Notable visitors have included Frank Sinatra, Lucille Ball, Bob Hope, and many others. The restaurant's walls are adorned with photographs of the many famous faces that have dined there, adding to its historic charm.\n\nToday, this Chicago institution, a longtime haven for celebrity diners, is operated by Tony Durpetti, who grew up a few doors down from the restaurant and married Gene's daughter, Marion. The chef, the bartender, and many of the waitstaff have been the restaurant's mainstays, many having worked there for several decades.\n\n1942 — Manny's\n\nSouth Loop\n\nManny's Cafeteria and Delicatessen, more commonly known simply as Manny's, is a Chicago institution with a rich history dating back to 1942. Located at 1141 South Jefferson Street in the South Loop, Manny's is renowned for its hearty, Jewish-style comfort food in a classic cafeteria setting. Over the decades, Manny's has become a destination for locals and visitors seeking an authentic taste of Chicago's culinary heritage.\n\nThe story of Manny's begins with Jack Raskin, who, along with his brother Charlie, opened a cafeteria that served Jewish food using recipes from their childhood in Russia. Initially, the business was located in the Maxwell Street Market area, a bustling center of commerce and culture for Chicago's immigrant communities.\n\nJack Raskin named the cafeteria after his son, Manny. Legend has it that there was already a sign for a restaurant called \"Sunny's\" where they set up shop, and by changing only two letters, they saved on the cost of a new sign. Thus, Manny's was born. This frugal and practical approach would become part of the restaurant's charm and ethos.\n\nIn 1964, Manny's moved to its current location on South Jefferson Street. This move allowed the restaurant to expand and serve its growing customer base better. The new location continued the tradition of serving generous portions of traditional Jewish deli fare in a cafeteria-style setting, where customers could see and choose their food as they moved through the line.\n\nWhile Manny's remains deeply rooted in tradition, it has adapted to changing times. The restaurant embraced technology and social media to reach new customers and stay connected with long-time patrons. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Manny's pivoted to offer takeout and delivery services, ensuring that customers could still enjoy their favorite meals safely.\n\n1943 — Pizzeria Uno\n\nRiver North\n\nPizzeria Uno, often referred to simply as Uno's, is a famous pizzeria located in Chicago, Illinois. It is credited with being the birthplace of the deep-dish pizza, a style of pizza characterized by its deep crust, which allows for generous toppings and cheese. Uno's opened its doors in 1943, founded by Ike Sewell and Ric Riccardo. They aimed to offer a unique and hearty pizza that stood out from the thin-crust pizzas commonly found in the region at the time.\n\nPizzeria Uno's deep-dish pizza typically features a thick, buttery crust, followed by layers of cheese, toppings such as sausage, pepperoni, vegetables, and then topped with a chunky tomato sauce. The pizza is baked in a deep, round pan, giving it its characteristic shape and allowing for the ample ingredients to meld together into a satisfyingly rich and hearty pie.\n\nOver the years, Pizzeria Uno has expanded, and its success led to the creation of a sister restaurant, Pizzeria Due, located nearby. Today, Uno's is part of a larger chain of restaurants known as Uno Chicago Grill or Uno Pizzeria & Grill, with locations across the United States.\n\n1945 — Ann Sather's\n\nLakeview\n\nAnn Sather's, a beloved restaurant in Chicago, has been serving hearty Swedish and American fare since it opened its doors in 1945. Located originally on Belmont Avenue and later expanding to multiple locations, Ann Sather's is renowned for its warm hospitality, generous portions, and legendary cinnamon rolls. The restaurant has become a cherished institution in the city, known for its comfort food and welcoming atmosphere.\n\nAnn Sather, a Swedish immigrant, founded the restaurant in 1945 at 929 West Belmont Avenue in Chicago's Lakeview neighborhood. Sather, passionate about cooking and baking, aimed to create a place where patrons could enjoy traditional Swedish dishes in a homey setting. The restaurant quickly gained popularity for its delicious food and friendly service, becoming a neighborhood favorite.\n\nAnn Sather's continues to thrive today, serving delicious food to longtime patrons and new customers. The restaurant has adapted to changing times by embracing modern technology and offering catering services, but it has always stayed true to its roots. The cinnamon rolls, Swedish pancakes, and other classic dishes remain as popular as ever, drawing crowds from all over the city.\n\n1946 — Coletti's\n\nJefferson Park\n\nColetti's, a family-owned restaurant in Chicago, has been serving Italian favorites and American comfort food since it opened in 1946. Located at 5707 North Central Avenue in the Jefferson Park neighborhood, Coletti's has built a reputation for its delicious meals, welcoming atmosphere, and strong ties to the local community.\n\nColetti's was originally known as \"El Centro\" when it was established in 1946. It was founded by an Italian immigrant family who wanted to bring the flavors of their homeland to the growing Italian-American community in Chicago. The restaurant quickly became a neighborhood favorite, known for its hearty Italian dishes and friendly, family-oriented service.\n\nColetti's has remained a family-owned and operated business throughout its history. The restaurant is now in its fourth generation of family ownership, with each generation committed to maintaining the quality and traditions that have made Coletti's a success. This continuity has helped the restaurant build a loyal customer base, with many patrons returning year after year.\n\nWhile Coletti's remains deeply rooted in tradition, it has also adapted to modern times. The restaurant has embraced new technologies and platforms to reach a broader audience, including social media and online ordering. Despite these changes, the core values of quality food, family tradition, and community involvement remain steadfast.\n\n1947 — Home Run Inn\n\nLittle Village\n\nVincent and Mary Grittani opened a tavern here in 1923 and named it the \"Home Run Inn\" because baseballs had a way of flying out of the park across the street and shattering their front window at 4254 West 31st Street in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago.\n\nVincent and Mary had a daughter, Loretta, who married an Italian immigrant named Nick Perrino. Nick moved to the United States at the age of 17 and served in the armed forces during the Second World War. After hostilities, he returned home looking for a job. Meanwhile, his father-in-law Vincent had passed away in 1943, and Mary needed help running the business. Nick, a former mess sergeant, went to work at the Home Run Inn and began baking breadsticks for the bar patrons. The breadsticks were a big hit, so Nick and Mary experimented with pizza. After settling on a recipe, they began cutting up square slices of hot pizza and giving them away to the customers. The pizza, which debuted in 1947, was an instant sensation, and before long, the Home Run Inn became a pizza parlor. Over the ensuing six decades, and primarily under the stewardship of Nick's son Joe, the Home Run Inn began selling frozen pizzas to local grocers, expanding to new retail locations, and increasing the size of its original location (it now accommodates 600 people), and creating new facilities to manage the frozen pizza distribution demand.\n\nToday, consumers in 20 states enjoy Home Run Inn's famous thin-crust pizza. Incidentally, Mary Grittani passed away in 1970, and Nick Perrino passed away in 1990. The business remains in the family today.\n\n1947 — Italian Fiesta Pizzeria\n\nHyde Park\n\nPhillip and Connie DeCarlo started the first Italian Fiesta Pizzeria in the late 1940s. Originally located at 67th and Dorchester in Chicago, the restaurant moved to 71st and Euclid in the 1950s. Their son, Frank DeCarlo, worked in the restaurant from a young age, where he met Joan, a waitress at the pizzeria who eventually became his wife. The DeCarlos had three daughters, Patti, Connie, and Kathy, who were all involved in the family business.\n\nAfter his dad passed away, Frank DeCarlo worked with his mother in the original pizzeria. He had the idea to open additional restaurants, two more in Chicago and another in Dolton. After Frank DeCarlo passed away in 1993, the business continued through the efforts of his wife Joan and daughter Patti.\n\nToday, the business is still family-owned and –operated by the DeCarlo daughters, along with their sons Steven Harris and Chris King, the fourth generation of the DeCarlo family. The fifth pizzeria opened in New Lenox in 2007.\n\n1948 — The Woodlawn Tap (Jimmy's)\n\nHyde Park\n\nIt's marginally a restaurant, but it's been around so long and enjoyed so much notoriety that it simply can't be ignored. At 1172 East 55th Street, the Woodlawn Tap was one of many bars and taverns along a lively strip of 55th Street in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago when Jimmy Wilson, a famous local bartender, acquired the business in 1948 and made it his own.\n\nFor the ensuing 51 years, he poured drinks and served cheap bar food to citizens from all stations in life, from the blue-collar crowd to Nobel laureates and other professors at the nearby University of Chicago. Patrons have reportedly included Saul Bellow, Margaret Mead, and Dylan Thomas. The Woodlawn Tap became so closely associated with Jimmy Wilson that it became known as \"Jimmy's,\" although \"Jimmy's\" was never part of its actual name.\n\nIn 1982, on Jimmy's 70th birthday, the President of the University of Chicago recognized his contribution to the neighborhood, its students, and its faculty with a proclamation declaring him an honorary post-doctoral alumnus. In 1999, after Jimmy Wilson passed away, the Woodlawn Tap was purchased by bar manager Bill Callahan, who was forced to fight tooth-and-nail to retain the liquor license, denied initially because the bar was allegedly within 100 feet of a church (89 to be exact).\n\nA petition bearing thousands of signatures was soon presented to Richard M. Daley. The denial was reversed on appeal, and Jimmy's Woodlawn Tap, now renovated but closely resembling the original, remains open today, serving drinks and cheeseburgers, hot dogs, Italian beef, Polish sausage, roast beef, and other finger food favorites.\n\n1948 — Superdawg\n\nNorwood Park\n\nSuperdawg at 6363 North Milwaukee Avenue is one of the few remaining drive-in restaurants in the country and the last one in Chicago. It was first opened in 1948 by Maurie and Flaurie Berman, and it remains a family business today. Maurie and Flaurie are depicted as hot dogs on the roof of the building, and, last we checked, both remain alive and well.\n\nCustomers drive up and order through a metallic speaker box. Carhops deliver the food on a tray that attaches to the front window (although there's limited counter seating inside and a few patio tables outside). By the way, it's a \"Superdawg,\" not a hot dog. It's bigger than most Chicago hot dogs and loaded with condiments, including mustard, relish, chopped onions, and a giant green pickle. All sandwiches are served with crinkle-cut french fries and green tomatoes in distinctive heat-preserving boxes.\n\nAll sandwiches are served with crinkle-cut french fries and green tomatoes in distinctive heat-preserving boxes. Order a \"hot dog,\" and you'll get an icy stare, as any loyal Superdawg customer can attest. Oh, and no ketchup. Do you want ketchup? Then put it on yourself.\n\n1948 — Calumet Fisheries\n\nSouth Deering\n\nBrothers-in-law Sid Kotlick and Len Toll purchased the Calumet Fisheries in 1948. They created a restaurant that became famous for its oak-smoked seafood (salmon steaks, trout, chubs, and shrimp), cured in a tiny smokehouse outback. Calumet Fisheries is located at 3259 East 95th Street in the South Deering neighborhood of Chicago.\n\nIt's strictly a carry-out operation, with the smoked shrimp and the smoked salmon being the biggest sellers. There's no seating, bathroom, or parking, and credit cards are not accepted. In 2010, Calumet Fisheries (still owned by the Kotlick and Toll families) was one of five restaurants the James Beard Foundation honored as an American classic. To earn the award, the South Side eatery demonstrated a timeless appeal and quality food reflecting the character of its community.\n\nIncidentally, fans of the Blues Brothers may know that Jake and Elwood Blues, driving their second-hand police cruiser, pass directly in front of Calumet Fisheries as they accelerate and then hurdle the drawbridge over the Calumet River. At the same time, \"She Caught The Katy\" blares in the background. Photographs of the movie sequence are displayed inside the red-roofed shack and other memorabilia.\n\n1949 — Charcoal Oven\n\nSkokie\n\nThe Charcoal Oven, a renowned dining establishment in Skokie, Illinois, just outside Chicago, has been a beloved institution for decades. Known for its unique blend of Greek and American cuisine, the Charcoal Oven has maintained a reputation for quality food and a warm, inviting atmosphere since its opening in 1949.\n\nThe Charcoal Oven was founded by Phillip Georgouses, a Northwestern University student and World War II veteran, who took over a popular local spot known as The Little Club. Phillip reimagined the restaurant, renaming it the Charcoal Oven and introducing a menu that combined his Greek heritage with classic American dishes.\n\nPhillip Georgouses ran the Charcoal Oven with passion and dedication, creating a legacy his family would carry on. His daughter, Maria, and her husband, Rich, took over the restaurant's management, continuing the traditions and high standards set by Phillip. Under their stewardship, the Charcoal Oven has maintained its reputation for excellent food and service.\n\nOver the decades, the Charcoal Oven has celebrated numerous milestones, including anniversaries and special events. These celebrations have been opportunities to reflect on the restaurant's rich history and to thank the loyal customers who have supported it through the years.\n\n1950 — The Bagel\n\nLakeview\n\nIn 1950 (or 5710 on the Hebrew calendar), two Holocaust survivors opened a 34-seat delicatessen at the corner of Lawrence and Kedzie Avenues in a space formerly known as \"the Bagel Bakery.\" Too thinly capitalized to afford a new sign, they altered the existing one and named their new business \"The Bagel Restaurant.\"\n\nFrom its inception, they served \"shtetl\" food, including kreplach, potato pancakes, beef brisket, and a highly popular matzo ball soup. The restaurant ultimately moved into bigger quarters on Devon Avenue and then, in 1992 (or 5772), to its present location at 3107 North Broadway. In 1987 (or 5767), a second location opened at Old Orchard Mall in Skokie. The Bagel is operated today by two original owners' descendants, Danny Wolf and his uncle Michael Golenzer.\n\nThe Bagel resembles something you might find tucked into a sidestreet near Times Square in Manhattan and has served meals to many celebrities over the years, including former President Bill Clinton, former Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg, and comedian Jackie Mason.\n\n1950 — Podhalanka Polska\n\nNoble Square\n\nPodhalanka Polska, often called Podhalanka, is a cherished Polish restaurant in Chicago's Noble Square neighborhood. Since its founding around 1980, it has served traditional Polish comfort food to the local community and visitors, becoming a beloved institution for its authentic cuisine and warm, welcoming atmosphere.\n\nPodhalanka Polska was established in the early 1980s in a small, nondescript two-story brown brick building at 1549 West Division Street, at the six-corner intersection of Division, Milwaukee, and Ashland. The restaurant was named after the Podhale region in southern Poland, known for its rich culinary traditions and hearty dishes.\n\nPodhalanka has long been a gathering place for the Polish community in Chicago, as well as for anyone seeking a taste of authentic Polish cuisine. It serves as a cultural hub where patrons can experience traditional Polish food and hospitality. The restaurant's proximity to the historic Polish Triangle—a significant cultural and commercial center for Polish immigrants in Chicago—further cements its role in the community.\n\nToday, Podhalanka serves delicious, authentic Polish food to a diverse clientele. The restaurant remains a family-run operation with the same dedication to quality and tradition that has defined it since its inception. While the restaurant may not have changed much over the years, its enduring charm and the comfort of its food continue to draw in patrons.\n\n1950 — Candlelite Chicago\n\nRogers Park\n\nCandlelite Chicago, often called Candlelite, is a cherished pizzeria and restaurant in the Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago. Since its establishment in 1950, Candlelite has been known for its delicious thin-crust pizza, friendly atmosphere, and long-standing presence in the community.\n\nCandlelite was founded in 1950 and quickly became a neighborhood favorite. The restaurant was established to serve high-quality, thin-crust pizza, a style that has become synonymous with Chicago. The name \"Candlelite\" is a nod to the cozy and inviting ambiance the restaurant sought to create from its inception.\n\nThe hallmark of Candlelite is its iconic thin-crust pizza, known for its perfectly crisp crust, tangy tomato sauce, and generous toppings. Over the years, the menu has expanded to include a variety of toppings and specialty pizzas, catering to both traditionalists and those seeking more innovative flavors.\n\nCandlelite thrives today, offering a blend of classic and contemporary dishes that appeal to a wide audience. The restaurant has embraced new technologies and platforms, such as online ordering and delivery services, to reach a broader customer base. Despite these modern touches, Candlelite retains its nostalgic charm and commitment to quality.\n\n1950 — Pat's Pizza\n\nSouth Loop\n\nPat's Pizza, a beloved institution in Chicago, has been serving delicious, authentic Italian thin-crust pies since it opened in 1950. At 2679 North Lincoln Avenue in the Lincoln Park neighborhood, Pat's Pizza has built a reputation for its crispy, flavorful pizzas and welcoming, family-friendly atmosphere.\n\nPat's Pizza was founded in 1950 by Pat and Rose Chiappetta. The Chiappettas, Italian immigrants, wanted to bring a taste of their homeland to Chicago. They chose to focus on thin-crust pizza, a style that was relatively new to the Chicago area at the time. The original location was a small, cozy spot that quickly became popular among locals for its delicious, hand-crafted pizzas.\n\nPat's Pizza is best known for its thin-crust pizza with a perfectly crisp crust, a tangy tomato sauce, and various fresh toppings. The pizzas are baked in a traditional pizza oven, giving them distinctive flavor and texture. Some of the most popular toppings include Italian sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, and green peppers.\n\nIn recent years, Pat's Pizza has embraced new technologies and platforms to reach a broader audience. The restaurant offers online ordering and delivery services, making it easier for customers to enjoy their favorite dishes at home. Despite these modern touches, Pat's Pizza prioritizes quality and tradition.\n\n1952 — Club Lago\n\nRiver North\n\nClub Lago, a venerable Italian restaurant in Chicago's River North neighborhood, has been serving hearty Italian cuisine and providing a welcoming atmosphere since it opened its doors in 1952. Known for its traditional dishes, vintage charm, and deep-rooted family ownership, Club Lago has become a cherished institution in the city.\n\nClub Lago was founded in 1952 by Gus and Ida Lazzerini. Originally from Lucca, Italy, the Lazzerinis wanted to bring authentic Northern Italian cuisine to Chicago. They chose a location at 331 West Superior Street, in what was then a heavily industrial area filled with printing companies and warehouses. The restaurant was named \"Lago\" after Lake Como, reflecting the Lazzerinis' connection to Italy.\n\nDespite the changes in the surrounding neighborhood, which has transformed from an industrial hub to a bustling area filled with art galleries, condos, and tech companies, Club Lago has remained true to its roots. The restaurant has adapted by updating its menu and embracing new technologies, such as online reservations and social media engagement while maintaining its classic appeal.\n\nLike many long-standing businesses, Club Lago has faced its share of challenges, including economic downturns and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Nardini family's resilience and commitment to their customers have allowed the restaurant to persevere. They have continued to provide takeout and delivery services, ensuring their loyal patrons can still enjoy their favorite dishes.\n\n1954 — Jimmy's Red Hots\n\nHumboldt Park\n\nJimmy's Red Hots has been at the corner of Grand and Pulaski Streets, 4000 West Grand Avenue, since 1954. The hot dogs are renowned. The decor is not. But we're not talking haute cuisine here, so the only thing that matters is a clean kitchen and a friendly staff. There's no seating -- just a narrow passage allowing a few customers to stand and gaze out the window while they eat.\n\nThe menu can aptly be described as minimalist: A Polish sausage, a hot dog, a tamale, and twice-sizzled french fries. Unlike most Chicago-style rivals, Jimmy's red hots can be seen and tasted. They are not so overly smothered with toppings that you need to turn a bounty hunter loose to find the beef. But take note: Jimmy's does not tolerate ketchup. Not on the side, not in a bottle, not in a packet, not in a house, not with a mouse. Ketchup is sacrilege. As they say at Jimmy's Red Hots: Don't even think about it.\n\nFrank Farrguia, the patriarch of this Chicago institution, says, \"If you're not going to eat it yourself, then don't dare serve it.\" Frank is understandably proud of his red hots but prefers to boast of his obstetric accomplishments: He has twice delivered babies at the restaurant. On one occasion, the customers came and went by, stepping over a woman lying in the doorway, suffering through painful contractions.\n\n1954 — Mario's Italian Lemonade\n\nUniversity Village\n\nMario's Italian Lemonade is a beloved Chicago institution known for its refreshing and delicious Italian lemonade.

The couple set up a small stand on Taylor Street, right in the heart of Chicago's Little Italy, an area known for its rich Italian-American culture and cuisine. Mario, who was passionate about creating refreshing and flavorful frozen treats, developed his recipe for Italian lemonade, which quickly gained popularity among locals.\n\nItalian lemonade served at Mario's is a unique variation of Italian ice. It is a semi-frozen dessert made from fresh lemons, sugar, and water, with added chunks of lemon zest and fruit for extra flavor and texture. Each batch is made fresh daily, ensuring the highest quality and taste. Adding real fruit pieces sets Mario's Italian Lemonade apart from other frozen treats, providing a refreshing and authentic flavor experience.\n\nDespite the changes in the surrounding neighborhood and the broader food industry, Mario's Italian Lemonade has remained true to its roots.

Sewell and Riccardo decided to open a second location to accommodate the growing demand. In 1955, they opened Pizzeria Due in a historic mansion just a block away from the original Pizzeria Uno.\n\nToday, Pizzeria Due remains a beloved institution in Chicago. While the restaurant has embraced some modern conveniences, such as online ordering and delivery services, it has steadfastly maintained its commitment to the traditional methods and high standards that have defined it for decades.\n\n1955 — Pete's Pizza\n\nRoscoe Village\n\nPete's Pizza, a long-standing establishment in Chicago, has been serving its famous thin-crust pizza and Italian-American dishes since it first opened its doors in the 1950s. Located at 3737 North Western Avenue in the Roscoe Village neighborhood, Pete's Pizza has become a beloved spot for locals seeking delicious, authentic pizza and a warm, family-friendly atmosphere.\n\nPete's Pizza was founded in the 1950s by Biagio and Guiseppina Cirrincione, Italian immigrants who brought their culinary traditions and passion for cooking to Chicago.

The original location was in Old Town, but Kahoun moved the pub to a new location on Larrabee Street as rents escalated. Unfortunately, a fire destroyed this incarnation of Moody's, prompting another move. In 1969, Moody's Pub found its current home at 5910 North Broadway in the Edgewater neighborhood.\n\nOne of the defining features of Moody's Pub is its unique atmosphere. The interior is designed to feel cozy and rustic, with dark wood paneling, a stone fireplace, and vintage decor that give it a welcoming and nostalgic charm. The pub has a bit of a dive bar aesthetic, adding to its appeal for many patrons.\n\nDuring winter, the fireplaces scattered throughout the pub keep customers warm and toasty.

Though Mickey suspected that Jimmy had lost his marbles, he soon found himself eyeing the shell of a defunct A&W restaurant sitting on a used car lot in Bellwood.\n\nJimmy suggested he buy it and convert it into a hot dog stand, an idea that appealed strongly to Mickey's wife, Ann. Jimmy and Ann (who instantly become the moving force behind the concept) convinced Mickey to realize the vision. Ann named the joint \"Mickey's Drive-In\" and recruited her teenage kids to help run the show. Naturally, she benefited under the tutelage of Jimmy Faruggia, whose legendary red hots are still the talk of Humboldt Park.\n\nIn the beginning, a metal can served as the cash register, and a hot dog, fries, and drink would set you back just 37 cents. The Sangiacomo family still runs the business today at 635 Mannheim Road, and Mickey's Drive-In, like Jimmy's Red Hots, is one of just 22 restaurants inducted into the Vienna Beef hall-of-fame. Strangely, they've also had success as matchmakers: They know of 21 married couples who met at Mickey's Drive-In. On their 30th anniversary, they sold hot dogs at their original price and moved 14,000 franks in a single day, during which they had a line that stretched a block-and-a-half long for eleven straight hours.\n\nMickey and Ann's daughter, Annette, persuaded her husband to open a \"Mickey's\" in Villa Park in 1979, but they sold out to their longtime business manager, Dave Bruder, in 2011.\n\n1959 — Aurelio's Pizza Of Homewood\n\nAurelio's Pizza, a renowned name in the Chicago pizza scene, has served its beloved thin-crust, square-cut pizzas since it was founded in Homewood, Illinois in 1959.
