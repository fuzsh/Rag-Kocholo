        "text": "After dark, Animal Kingdom is a must-see park – from Dinosaur lounges to a spectacular nighttime show, to an entire world that glows!\n\nFloating jellyfish, elephants at sunset, Primordial Booze, and glowing animals dancing on a tree. All things you will find when you brave Animal Kingdom at night.\n\nA Nighttime Transformation\n\nEvery Disney Park changes from night to day. The castle lights up and tells stories of Happily Ever After. EPCOT shines with lights from around the world. A life-size Millennium Falcon lights up the sky at Hollywood Studios. But at Animal Kingdom, the hours after dark are even more magical. The park is transformed. Worlds start glowing. A tree awakens. Animals gallop.\n\nBack in the days of Tarzan Rocks! And Mickey’s Jammin’ Jungle Parade, there really wasn’t much to do after dark at Animal Kingdom. But now, as the sun sets, a wholly different Animal Kingdom comes alive!\n\n1. The Bioluminescent World of Avatar\n\nIf there is one land/world in all of Disney World that you must visit both day and night, it’s Pandora– The World of Avatar. Pandora is totally immersive during the day– with the sounds, sights, and smells of a different world. It’s larger than life, and when you’re right in the middle of it, you really feel like you’re in another world.\n\nBut at night, Pandora really comes alive. SPOILER ALERT: the entire world glows. All of it. The ground, the plants, the animals, the rock… the Magic Shots.\n\nLook at the hanging plant. They’re impressive during the day, but at night, they seem to come alive! Make sure to look up, down, in the water, and even peek through the leaves of all the lush plants.\n\nWhat’s the best way to experience this? First, visit Pandora during the day. Try to get on the rides if you can. Then, go play and have adventures in other areas of the park. Once it starts to get dark, explore Pandora again. Whether you get there right at sunset when the night world starts to come alive or when it’s already completely dark, you’ll want to spend time just exploring.\n\n2. The Tree of Life Awakens\n\nFor years, Animal Kingdom didn’t have a nighttime show. Then, Rivers of Light started changing the view that Animal Kingdom was just for the daytime. Sadly Rivers of Light is no longer, but the even-better Tree of Life Awakenings is still lighting up the night.\n\nTree of Life Awakenings starts happening as the sun is setting. No matter where you are in the park, look over at the tree, and you will see it start to light up with different colors and sparkling branches.\n\nTypically, there are four different 5-minute-or-so shows in Awakenings. One of these is called Disney Medley and features music and friends from some of the most famous Disney animal films.\n\nThe best view is right in front of the tree on Discovery Island with the park exit behind you.\n\nSongs and visuals inspired by Bambi, Pocahontas, Finding Nemo, Tarzan, and even DINOSAUR dance across the tree.\n\nOne of my favorite scenes is from Lion King. Can you spot the giraffes and other animals in the circle of life with the sun glowing behind them?\n\n3. Animals at Sunset\n\nThe lions may be sleeping, but at night, the other animals really show their personalities on Kilimanjaro Safari.\n\nThe animals are always more active when it rains, when the weather is cooler, and at sunset. We did the safari right at sunset and saw hyenas fighting.\n\ngiraffes galloping, a baby elephant with the sunset in the distance\n\nAnd these two doing whatever this is! (Pictured above.)\n\n4. Mountain Views\n\nExpedition Everest is an epic coaster any time of day, but at night the mountain glows in the moonlight. But before you even board Expedition Everest, make sure you check out the illuminated signs promoting all the local businesses. As the train is turning that first dark corner, look ahead for an amazing view of the peaks you’re about to climb.\n\nMaking your way up the mountain, you’ll see glowing art on the inside of the arches and caves. Time it right, and you may even see fireworks in the distance on the broken track.\n\n5. Drinking Dinosaurs\n\nLounges are a great place to fuel up for an evening in a Disney Park. In 2018, Animal Kingdom brought Dino lovers a place to chill their bones at Restaurantosaurus Lounge. As the sun goes down, the lounge side of Restaurantosaurus comes out with candles on the tables, a pub style menu, and Jurassic-themed cocktails like Primordial Booze, Carnotaurus Metoritis and Fermented Fossil.\n\n6. Light Up Drinks\n\nJust before you cross the bridge to Pandora, get a light-up flower you can take home at Nomad Lounge with the Annapurna Zing cocktail. It’s typically served with a softly lit lotus flower floating on the top of a fizzy cocktail of passion fruit puree, gin, mint and an effervescent splash of ginger beer.\n\n7. Glowing Magic Shots\n\nI’m a big fan of Disney PhotoPass Magic Shots. They are really a super fun way to get a pic with rare characters you can’t typically meet. Over at EPCOT it’s Mushu, Figaro, and Sven. But only in Pandora will phosphorescent jellyfish-like creatures float into the picture.\n\n8. The Lights of a Continent\n\nWhile Pandora is all aglow, across the park, the lights in Asia at Animal Kingdom have a more realistic feel. There are café lights strung along the walkways connecting Yak and Yeti restaurant to the trees along the waterfront.Buddhas and statues are illuminated while colorful prayer flags sway in the cool evening breeze with the snowy peaks of Everest providing a dramatic backdrop\n\n9. After Dark Animal Encounters\n\nPack your night goggles for some unique and special animal experiences. Currently, most tours and special events are on hold during revised park operations. When they return, Animal Kingdom After Hours is a special ticketed event perfect for you night owls.\n\nYou will get 4+ hours to brave Everest, search for active animals on the safari, and have the best view for Tree of Life Awakenings. If you want to get up close and personal with the animals and have some tasty safari sips and snacks, try Savor the Savanna. This tour requires pre-booking and is an additional cost to your park ticket.\n\nThis experience usually starts around 4 PM. Depending on the time of year, you may be visiting the jungle right at that golden hour when the sun starts to set, the air cools down, and the animals burn off some energy before bed.\n\n10. Your Festive Adventures Await!\n\nIn 2019 Animal Kingdom added a variety of holiday activities and decorations. This is more than just giant Christmas Trees and twinkly lights. Tree of Life Awakenings takes the holiday tree to a new level with a special show that can make even the warmest Florida night feel festive.\n\nYou can also find colorful twinkly lights are in the shape of a larger-than-life Dinosaur, and an entire festival of lights with the Diwali lanterns dotted around Asia. So get that Park Hopper, make a later reservation at Disney Springs, and make the trek over to see all that Animal Kingdom after dark has to offer.\n\nExplore your wild side and love all things nature with our April edition of WDW Magazine.
