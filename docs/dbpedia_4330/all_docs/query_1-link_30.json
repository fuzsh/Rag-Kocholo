        "text": "I keep five glues in my studio right now. If I experiment with more I will add them to this guide. Without further ado, here they are. Reviews, notes, and more are below.\n\nLocTite Gel\n\nBioQuip Insect Repair Adhesive\n\nLineco Methyl Cellulose\n\nElmer’s\n\nE6000\n\nNow for the reviews!\n\nGlue type: LocTite Gel, a brand of super glue (cyanoacrylate glue)\n\nConsistency: Gel toothpaste, under eye cream\n\nOdor: Acrid chemical smell\n\nApplication type: Comes in a squeeze bottle with a tiny applicator tip\n\nColor when dry: Mostly clear with a whitish cast depending on the thickness\n\nReversible: No\n\nWhere to buy: Amazon, Michaels, hardware stores\n\nNotes: Super glue comes in a number of consistencies but I always buy the gel kind so that I have control over the flow. This is the most caustic of any glues I will mention here and it dries very very brittle — so if you repair something but it gets bumped, it will snap again in the same spot but with the addition of dried glue. If you repair it a second time with super glue, it may be very noticeable. I would only use this glue for non-visible repairs, like attaching a head back onto a body. It works great for securing pins into shadow boxes but if I had the choice between this and E6000, even just for shadow boxes, I would choose E6000 every time. More on that below.\n\nSuper glue from any brand gives off fumes for a long while after application. Ensure that it has dried for quite a few days before sealing it under glass, because the fumes can bloom and create a dirty-looking cast on the inside of your glass. It’s easy to remove but wouldn’t it just be better to not have to do that in the first place?\n\nOverall rating: 3/5\n\nGlue type: BioQuip Insect Repair Adhesive\n\nConsistency: Liquid, like watered-down dish soap. Just slightly more viscous than plain water.\n\nOdor: Knocks your socks off, acrid chemical smell\n\nApplication type: Comes in a vial with a glass rod attached to the lid, the rod is the applicator\n\nColor when dry: Clear and shiny\n\nReversible: No\n\nWhere to buy: BioQuip\n\nNotes: This repair adhesive is PERFECT for small repairs. Torn wings? Yes. Detached antennae? Yes. Gotta fix some cilia? Yes. Use very sparingly. What I like to do is let most of the glue drip off the glass rod back into the vial and dab the tip of the applicator along the edges that need to be repaired until I can just barely see the adhesive. I use tweezers or forceps to replace the missing part in its correct position and blow very, very gently until the glue seems to hold on its own. It dries quite fast. This is a nice glue to have on hand for minor repairs of small invertebrates, but I would not recommend it for very large repairs because of the consistency. A more gel-like glue works better for large repairs because it has the volume to fill up cavities and stay in place, rather than dripping out. I would also not use this glue to secure any insects in their shadow boxes.\n\nOverall rating: 5/5, will always stock this in my studio\n\nGlue type: Lineco Methyl Cellulose\n\nConsistency: Initially, powder. Once mixed, chocolate mousse, complete with airiness\n\nOdor: Not noticeable at all\n\nApplication type: Brush\n\nColor when dry: Clear\n\nReversible: Yes\n\nWhere to buy: Amazon\n\nNotes: This is a very interesting adhesive. The container contains cellulose-based powder, which you mix with water according to the package instructions in a separate container. A little powder goes a long way so this glue is worth the investment. Leave for one hour or overnight and it magically turns into glue! This adhesive is acid-free and archival, originally formulated for creating and repairing books. Once mixed and left to set, the glue can be lifted out of the container on your brush in small pieces and pushed into the areas where you need it. It does not flow and does not have a liquid consistency at all. In my experience this is best used for larger repairs (missing heads, fallen legs from larger insects) rather than very tiny repairs given that it stays in place and will not flow smoothly to fill in gaps for repairs like antennae or small tarsi. I do like this adhesive a lot and it dries quite nicely, but remember the consistency of the original powder and keep in mind that this type of adhesive does not have shock absorbing qualities — I do not use this glue to secure insects in their shadow boxes.\n\nLineco Methyl Cellulose is reversible with water.\n\nOverall rating: 4/5\n\nGlue type: Elmer’s School Glue or Elmer’s Glue-All. See also: Aleene’s Tacky Glue.\n\nConsistency: Runny, like melting ice cream\n\nOdor: Old milk\n\nApplication type: Cap pops up, squeeze from the bottle\n\nColor when dry: It says it dries clear, but it’s more like a milky color. There’s a milk theme here with this glue and if that grosses you out, I’m so sorry. To be fair it does have a drawing of a cow on the label (a variant of the character Elsie, because Elmer’s used to be owned by Borden) and used to be made from bovine and equine (cattle and horse) parts. You can read all about the strange history of Elmer’s here. Today it is made of PVA (polyvinyl acetate) and no animals are used in its production.\n\nReversible: Maybe, with water. The glue will soften and you could peel your parts away from each other and reattach if necessary. Keep in mind that this could become extremely messy.\n\nWhere to buy: Amazon, Michaels, and basically everywhere else in America. Even your grocery store probably sells Elmer’s in the office supply section near the paper towels, etc. so it’s easy to find in a pinch.\n\nNotes: Elmer’s is an easy to find glue that is “good enough” to get the job done but it’s not amazing. As mentioned above, it does dry clear-ish with a white cast. This means you need to be quite sparing with it when it’s being used in a visible spot. It dries slightly flexible but still brittle. For the most success, squeeze out a “baby dot” of glue (the size of the head of a pin) and apply more only as needed. Wipe away excess before it dries if possible. I do not usually use Elmer’s for repairs unless literally nothing else is available. I do use it for securing pins into shadow boxes. If you do like the texture and are looking for an archival version, try finding rabbit skin glue made for bookbinding. Yes, it’s made from real rabbit skin.\n\nOverall rating: 2/5\n\nGlue type: E6000\n\nConsistency: Thick gel, like silicone caulking or Vaseline\n\nOdor: Mild chemical odor\n\nApplication type: Tube\n\nColor when dry: Clear\n\nReversible: Not really, but you could try with acetone. Keep in mind the effect acetone may have on your specimen.\n\nWhere to buy: Amazon, Michaels\n\nNotes: E6000 is my favorite glue and I have a lot of thoughts about it. While not considered to be archival, it is my favorite and I use it the most often out of all of my adhesives. It is very useful for making larger repairs such as attaching a head back onto a beetle or reattaching a cicada leg. It is not very useful for reattaching very small parts like antennae or mouth parts. The texture when it dries is somewhat soft, flexible, and rubbery. This is a positive attribute because this glue is shock absorbent compared to other adhesives — so if you ship your insects, or you move homes, insects repaired this way are much more likely to “survive” (that’s a joke because the bugs are dead) being jostled around on the journey.\n\nE6000 comes in many sizes. At first glance, buying many small tubes seems more wasteful and less economical. However, this adhesive has a relatively short shelf life once opened. Even if you seal the cap completely, eventually the entire tube will harden into a weird gummy bear consistency which can still be squeezed out of the tube, it is slightly sticky but will no longer operate as an actual adhesive. For this reason, I choose to purchase the small tube sets and open one at a time. To create a very small opening, when I remove the cap I poke a tiny hole in the seal so only a small amount comes out at once. If I don’t use the whole tube immediately and it does the weird gel thing, I can just toss it and open a new small tube. If I did this with the large tubes I would be spending a lot more overall because I’d end up throwing away much more.\n\nE6000 is easy to remove if you get it on your hands, just let it dry until it is tacky and then rub your hands together to get the glue off before washing. If you get E6000 on other surfaces and don’t notice until it dries, it can be cleaned off with acetone (check that acetone is safe to use on the surface you are trying to clean).\n\nOnce again, I repeat that this is not archival but will definitely last your entire lifetime. If I only have to fix something once, but there’s a slight chance it will erode from acid in 200 years, does it really matter if a piece of art I made for myself has a tiny bit of non-archival adhesive on it? I don’t think so. Long live E6000!\n\nOverall rating: 5/5, will always stock this in my studio\n\nDo you have an insect repair adhesive you like using that wasn’t mentioned here? Let me know in the comments, I would love to buy it and try it!\n\n\"ETHICAL\" TAXIDERMY - A (REALLY LONG) DISCUSSION\n\nPREVENTION OF COMMODIFYING PROTECTED ANIMALS\n\nAs far as procuring specimens, if you don’t already have a particular item in your freezer, there are a variety of ways to get your hands on something. People constantly accuse me of killing animals for my work but reality is that all living things die eventually. I never have and never would kill something just to stick it in a jar. Anywhere you can imagine animals die, they do… farms, breeders, getting hit by cars, hunting, trapping, pet stores, you name it. Once you find a connection with someone who works in a related field, you’ll soon have your hands on a specimen. If you’re looking for something just to practice on, I would recommend contacting someone who breeds small mammals for snake food. If one of those mammals (like a mouse) dies of unknown causes, it’s unsafe to feed to a snake (if it died from illness, it could make the snake sick) and will usually just be thrown out. This is your chance to give “life” to something that would otherwise be discarded.\n\nMake sure what you are doing is LEGAL. I can’t stress this enough. Research wildlife parts laws in your area and DO NOT, under any circumstances, violate bird law. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 goes hand in hand with bird protection laws in many other countries up and down the path where most North and South American birds migrate, and you could end up in big trouble if you possess so much as a feather from any protected species. In a majority of U.S. states it’s not legal to collect roadkill without a special educational permit, and you can’t hunt without a license either. Each city, state or province, and country has its own laws governing the possession and use of wildlife and their parts, so bone up on that legal knowledge to make sure you aren’t in violation of anything.\n\nNow that you’ve procured a specimen safely and legally, let’s talk about the steps of preservation.\n\nSAFETY PRECAUTION ALERT!!!\n\nYou will be using formalin for this project. Formalin is an aqueous solution (meaning that particles have been dissolved in water) consisting of formaldehyde and water. FORMALDEHYDE IS FLAMMABLE AND CARCINOGENIC. I do not recommend that you work on this project without wearing a respirator. Do not work on this project in the vicinity of anyone not wearing a respirator who has not consented, and never do this type of work around any children or living animals. This is best completed in a room which you can close off, complete your project, and ventilate after leaving. For instance, I wear a formaldehyde-safe respirator mask and work in my studio. I lock my pets out, complete my projects, and open the window before leaving the room for several hours to allow everything to air out.\n\nOSHA guidelines state that it is safe to have up to 15 minutes of unprotected exposure to formaldehyde per day. I do teach this method in my classes but I adhere to these guidelines and try to keep it to 5 minutes or less just to err on the side of caution. Formaldehyde can cause cancer and birth defects. DO NOT WORK ON ANY FORMALDEHYDE-RELATED PROJECTS IF YOU ARE PREGNANT OR TRYING TO BECOME PREGNANT. Your baby will be born with deformities and illnesses. This is not a joke.\n\nSo long as you take safety precautions, you’ll be fine.\n\nWear a respirator with fresh filters and a pair of safety goggles (not glasses, you want them to seal to your face and protect your eyes from the gas). Always wear gloves and always get fresh gloves if you need to de-glove for any reason."
