        "text": "With the rise of Instagram over the past few years, there’s been a growing Disney trend on the rise and that is finding the most interesting, colorful backdrops for your theme park photos. As a result, there are several Instagram-worthy walls that have become go-to destinations in themselves for those looking to show their Disney side. If you’d like to incorporate a bit of Instagram fun into your next Walt Disney World vacation you’ll want to start with a few of the backdrops on our top 10 list.\n\nThe Purple Wall – Tomorrowland – Magic Kingdom\n\nWe’ll kick off our list with the wall that started it all. The Purple Wall is located next to Monsters, Inc Laugh Floor near the entrance of Tomorrowland in Magic Kingdom. As a matter of fact, this area is so popular with Instagram fans that it has its own Instagram account! The Purple Wall was also the recipient of a makeover last year. Fans will still find the solid purple wall but are a portion of this much-loved backdrop also sports a fun geometric design (pictured top). Check out some snaps at this location at #purplewall.\n\n2. Bubblegum Wall – Epcot\n\nNext time you’re at Epcot, be on the lookout for one of our favorite Instagram-worthy backdrops. The Bubblegum Wall is located near the exit doors to Spaceship Earth. We can’t get enough of its pink, fuschia and blue hues! Check out #bubblegumwall for a little inspiration!\n\n3. The Toothpaste Wall – Epcot\n\nIf blue hues are more your thing than be on the lookout for this colorful wall located at The Seas with Nemo and Friends! You’ll find the Toothpaste Wall as you exit the pavilion! Check out some snaps at the wall at #ToothPasteWall.\n\n4. Moss Wall – Animal Kingdom\n\nThere’s so much to explore at the visually stunning Pandora-The World of Avatar in Disney’s Animal Kingdom theme park. As you embark on your adventure to this bioluminescent land be on the lookout for the Moss Wall. You’ll find it near Satu’li Canteen. It’s green, purple and blue hues serve as the perfect backdrop for your Avatar-themed adventures. Check out some of the amazing images at #MossWall.\n\n5. “You Are Most Beautiful” Wall – Animal Kingdom\n\nThe Harambe Marketplace section of Disney’s Animal Kingdom theme park is absolutely brimming with fantastic details. From rum infused dole whips to amazing street performers there’s something to behold around every corner. This includes fantastic spots for your Instagram photos. Our first noteworthy location is the “You Are Most Beautiful” graffiti wall which you’ll find on the park-side of one of the cast member-only doorways. Be sure to have those cameras at the ready!\n\n6. Mickey Mouse Wall – Animal Kingdom\n\nIn the same area as the “You are Most Beautiful” wall you’ll also find this awesome backdrop featuring Mickey himself! Be on the look as you stroll around the Harambe Marketplace area of Animal Kingdom.\n\n7. Carousel of Progress Wall – Magic Kingdom\n\nThe name of the wall gives it’s location away. You’ll find this bright backdrop at the Carousel of Progress in Tomorrowland. However, since it’s part of the exterior of the ride it does have railing blocking its way. That being said, it can still make for a fantastic image as evidenced above!\n\n8. The Land Wall – Epcot\n\nWe’ve often paused on our way into The Land Pavilion in Epcot’s Future World to take in the amazing mosaic that greets visitors. With its intricate design and wide range of colors we think it also makes for an interesting Instagram shot. Its perfect for those who prefer a more rustic artsy vibe!\n\n9. The Blueberry Wall – Epcot\n\nEpcot is definitely an Instagram-lovers haven. Mere steps away from the Bubblegum wall you’ll find this blue variation. Just head to the right. #BlueberryWall.\n\n10. Block Wall – Disney’s Hollywood Studios\n\nWe round out our list with one of the brand new walls you’ll find at Toy Story Land at Disney’s Hollywood Studios. From checkerboards to popsicle sticks this area of the park is filled with Instagram-inspiration so bring your cameras and a playful attitude!\n\nOther Notable Walls:\n\nMuppet Wall – Disney’s Hollywood Studios – On Grand Avenue\n\nNeon Mickey Wall – Disney’s Contemporary Resort\n\nFlower Power Wall – Disney’s Pop Century Resort\n\nRose Gold Wall – Epcot – Mission: Space\n\nGalaxy Wall – Epcot – Construction Walls in location of upcoming Guardians of the Galaxy attraction\n\nThe Candy Stripe Wall – Magic Kingdom- Inside Main Street Confectionary\n\nDid your favorite Instagram walls make the cut?
