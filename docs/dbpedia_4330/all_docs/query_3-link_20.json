        "text": "Mickey the pit bull stares at me from behind the bars of his cage at Maricopa County's Animal Care and Control quarantine unit on south 27th Avenue.\n\nDeath row for dogs.\n\nThe recorded sounds of a classical violin resonate from overhead speakers and echo off the block walls of the enclosure. The music is said to calm the dogs.\n\nMickey warily sniffs the back of my hand. His big head is tilted down. He's shaking, frightened, although in the past week or so he's grown comfortable enough with his surroundings to take a dog treat from between the bars.\n\nHe has put on some weight since he was locked up, but you can still see his ribs.\n\nHe glances at me and turns away, unable to stop quivering, not unusual for a dog unfamiliar with people. He spent much of his time chained in a yard. He is not trained or neutered. He was underfed.\n\nYou'd feel sorry for Mickey if you didn't know he had attacked and disfigured a 4-year-old boy.\n\nYou'd feel sorry for him until you found out that people from Arizona and all over the world seem to be more concerned for Mickey than for little Kevin Vicente, who required 5 ½ hours of surgery to stitch the gashes in his face and to mend his broken eye socket, detached tear ducts and a fractured jaw.\n\nYou'd have every reason to be outraged by that, and maybe you are.\n\nIn which case … you'd be wrong.\n\nThe fact that some people are clamoring to save Mickey's life – including a lawyer now representing the dog – does not mean those same people don't also care about children.\n\nJust as it would be ridiculous to assume that the people speaking out on behalf of the injured boy don't care about dogs.\n\nIt's not an either/or proposition.\n\nEach of us is capable of being concerned about little boys and dogs.\n\nWe should care about little boys and dogs.\n\nIf anything the story of Mickey and Kevin is a tragic reminder that there are a lot of little boys and a lot of dogs who need our help.\n\nYou could start with Kevin. His family isn't granting interviews. But there is a Help Kevin with His Recovery fund available at maricopahealthfoundation.org. The street address for the foundation is 2910 E Camelback Road, Suite 180, Phoenix, Arizona 85016. The phone number is 602-687-9031.\n\nIf you want to help children in addition to Kevin you could make a general donation to the foundation, which assists with health care costs for our needy neighbors.\n\nAs for Mickey there is a hearing set for Mar. 25 that will determine his fate. He could be euthanized, but at least he will have an attorney at the hearing to make the case for finding a place for him where he can be trained and the public kept safe.\n\nThere is a \"Save Mickey\" Facebook page, which is approaching 40,000 \"likes.\"\n\nCommenting on a website isn't really doing something though, is it?\n\nI visited Mickey with Melissa Gable of Animal Care and Control. She said, \"It's great people want to save Mickey. But there are hundreds, thousands, of dogs who have done no harm and that also need to be saved. There's a lot of name-calling going on between the Save Mickey people and the anti-Save Mickey people and that's just sad. This little boy and this dog are caught in the middle of a big argument.\"\n\nAnd bigger problem.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to help needy children and families right here in Phoenix: Crisis Nursery. Big Brothers and Big Sisters. The Salvation Army. The St. Vincent de Paul Society. The list goes on and on.\n\nAs for animals, it is estimated that Maricopa County Animal Care and Control and the Arizona Humane Society take in somewhere around 90,000 dogs and cats each year and that about half of them are euthanized.\n\nWhat happened to young Kevin was awful.\n\nBut there are things we can do to prevent it from happening to other children.\n\nDonate to Kevin or to a charity in Kevin's name.\n\nAdopt a dog in Mickey's name.\n\nStop calling each other names.\n\n(Column for Mar. 14, 2014, Arizona Republic)"
