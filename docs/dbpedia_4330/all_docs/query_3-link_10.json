        "text": "Walk to the first pathway that branches from the main walkway into Pandora. Find a dead tree jutting up above the fence along the right side of the path. Two clusters of mushrooms and fungi sit on the far side of this tree. Halfway up the left cluster (as you face the tree from the far side), three small round mushrooms are grouped as a classic Mickey. (The Hidden Mickey mushrooms are near the middle of the photo).\n\nSubmitted by: Matt Mellarkey"
