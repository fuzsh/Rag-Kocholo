        "text": "HOUSTON (Gray News) - A 2-year-old girl in Texas was mauled to death by three Rottweilers while at her babysitter’s house, according to authorities.\n\nHouston police were called to a home around 12:20 p.m. for a vicious animal. When officers arrived, they found A’Daya Rain Fisher suffering from injuries after being attacked by three Rottweilers, KRIV reported.\n\nOfficials took the 2-year-old to a hospital where she was pronounced dead.\n\nKRIV reports that the dogs attacked A’Daya while inside the home where she was in child care. The dogs were euthanized and their specimens were sent to a lab to be tested for rabies.\n\nAccording to a GoFundMe page, A’Daya brought joy to everyone with her playful spirit and loving nature.\n\nA’Daya’s mother, Daja Pringle told KRIV that she remembers how every night before bed, the little girl would say, “Mom kiss. Mom hug.”\n\n“She was a light to everybody, my family, to everyone that met her, she was a gift. She was a temporary gift,” Pringle told the outlet.\n\nPringle is also planning to launch a nonprofit in A’Daya’s honor to increase awareness and support other families to prevent similar tragedies.\n\nThe outlet reports that authorities will not press charges."
