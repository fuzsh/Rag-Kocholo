His sire was Woodman, a Champion 2-year-old colt in Ireland who was a son of the influential American Champion sire, Mr. Prospector. Woodman also sired Preakness and Belmont Stakes winner Hansel as well as Breeders' Cup Juvenile and Preakness Stakes winner, Timber Country.[2]\n\nTrained and ridden by future Hall of Fame inductees, Woodcarver was race conditioned by Michael Keogh and had Mickey Walls aboard for his wins in the Queenston Stakes and the Queen's Plate.[3]\n\nOn September 10, 1999, Woodcarver had to be humanely euthanized after taking a misstep during a morning workout which resulted in a badly broken leg.[4]\n\nPedigree\n\n[edit]\n\nPedigree of Woodcarver, gray colt, 1996 Sire\n\nWoodman Mr. Prospector Raise a Native Native Dancer Raise You Gold Digger Nashua Sequence Playmate Buckpasser Tom Fool Busanda Intriguing Swaps Glamour Dam\n\nSharpening Up Sharpen Up Atan Native Dancer Mixed Marriage Rocchetta Rockefella Chambiges Twisp Dancer's Image Native Dancer Noor's Image Junonia Sun Again Pavonia (family: 1-h)"
