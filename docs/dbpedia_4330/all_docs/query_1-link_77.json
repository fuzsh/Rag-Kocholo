Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll-Star Sports is great for large groups, but the rooms are my least favorite.\n\nLevel: Value\n\nStarting room rate: $128\n\nDisney's All-Star Sports is affordable, and sports fans will probably love the decor. Due to the size of the resort, large tour groups, dance teams, and families often stay here.\n\nBut the biggest drawback is its unrenovated rooms. Compared to the other value resorts on the property, these rooms look and feel pretty dated.\n\nPlus having so many larger groups around can create more noise and increased wait times for the complimentary buses to the theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoronado Springs has good dining options, but transportation can be inconvenient.\n\nLevel: Moderate\n\nStarting room rate: $250\n\nThe biggest pro to Disney's Coronado Springs Resort is its beautiful theme celebrating Spanish, Mexican, and Southwest American cultures. It's even home to a gorgeous pool area with a 50-foot replica of a Mayan pyramid.\n\nThere are also plenty of table-service dining options at Gran Destino Tower, including Toledo, Three Bridges Bar & Grill, and Dahlia Lounge.\n\nAlthough the rooms are spacious, their theming is a bit bland compared to the rest of Coronado Springs. They don't have that magical touch I like and expect from a Disney resort room.\n\nThe bus system can also be inconvenient. With four bus stops within the resort and lots of people getting on at each one, I usually have a hard time finding a seat.\n\nFurthermore, the resort is divided into multiple sections, so you may have a pretty long walk to your room.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Dolphin is nice for rope-dropping at Epcot and Hollywood Studios.\n\nLevel: Deluxe\n\nStarting room rate: $220\n\nThe Dolphin is within walking distance of both Epcot and Hollywood Studios, which is beneficial if you're trying to rope-drop (get to the parks right when they open).\n\nMy room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable, which I'm always grateful for after a long day in the parks.\n\nAlthough the Swan and Dolphin resort area sits on Disney World property, it's actually a Marriott hotel. As a result, the rooms aren't really themed\n\nIt's not the best option if you're looking for a hotel with Disney \"magic.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI love the theming at All-Star Music.\n\nLevel: Value\n\nStarting room rate: $128\n\nAs a music lover, All-Star Music has stellar theming. If you're a Selena Gomez fan like me, you'll especially appreciate the display in the lobby.\n\nThe rooms are on the smaller side, but the Murphy beds are a great addition. They provide more living space during the day and can easily be pulled down at night.\n\nBut be prepared for a long walk to and from the lobby, food court, and bus area if you're not staying in a preferred room.\n\nAlthough this is more of a general con for all of the value and some of the moderate resorts, whenever I stay at All-Star Music, my room tends to be very far from the central building. This can be a bother after walking 12+ miles at a theme park.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe savanna view at Animal Kingdom Lodge never gets old.\n\nLevel: Deluxe\n\nStarting room rate: $470\n\nAnimal Kingdom Lodge has views of four savannas with more than 200 animals and birds. I was fortunate enough to stay in a savanna-view room, and it's truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience to wake up to wildlife outside your window.\n\nThe rooms themselves are also beautiful and contain stunning pieces of wooden furniture.\n\nThe resort is home to one of my favorite restaurants on the property: Sanaa. If you haven't dined there yet, make a reservation to try the Indian-style bread service. The Mara, the resort's quick-service dining location, also sells zebra domes, a fan-favorite dessert.\n\nOn the other hand, the resort is far from all the other theme parks except for Animal Kingdom. Furthermore, for a deluxe resort, the only mode of complimentary transportation offered is buses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPort Orleans – French Quarter has fantastic theming (and food).\n\nLevel: Moderate\n\nStarting room rate: $280\n\nThe theming and amenities at Port Orleans – French Quarter are outstanding for the price. I've never personally been to New Orleans, but staying here made me feel as though I have.\n\nThe theming doesn't stop with the Mardi Gras characters and decor — the dining options are equally as festive. The quick-service location, Sassagoula Floatworks and Food Factory, serves amazing dishes like jambalaya and gumbo.\n\nThe Mickey-shaped beignets are a bonus since it's one of the only places you can find them on Disney World property.\n\nBut I'm not a big fan of the rooms at the resort. Although they're nice, I find them to be a bit too simplistic.\n\nPort Orleans is also located in the Disney Springs resort area, which is a little far from the theme parks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArt of Animation is beautiful, but I think it's a little overpriced.\n\nLevel: Value\n\nStarting room rate: $200\n\nWhen I first stepped into Art of Animation, I was blown away by its colors, theming, and character statues.\n\nCompared to other value resorts, it has some of the best food options with Landscape of Flavors. The plant-based Mickey frittata is delicious.\n\nThe rooms also have impeccable theming. When I stayed in a \"Little Mermaid\"-themed room, I was amazed by the amount of detail — even the chairs resembled seashells.\n\nBut even though Art of Animation is technically classified as a value resort, its price point doesn't really reflect that title, in my opinion.\n\nThe \"Little Mermaid\" section, where I stayed, is the only one that's remotely close to a value-resort price. Otherwise, the \"Finding Nemo,\" \"Cars,\" and \"Lion King\" family suites average around $460 to $500 a night. That's more expensive than rooms at some deluxe resorts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe BoardWalk Inn transports guests back in time.\n\nLevel: Deluxe\n\nStarting room rate: $597\n\nMy favorite part of the BoardWalk Inn is the magicians and acrobats that frequent the nearby BoardWalk in the evening. The resort is also a quick walk to the International Gateway entrance at Epcot and a quick boat ride or walk to Hollywood Studios.\n\nThe rooms have tiny but mighty details that resemble an old-timey boardwalk. My favorite is the shower curtain decorated with Ferris wheels.\n\nBut in comparison to the other deluxe resorts in the Epcot area, this one is not nearly as fancy.\n\nI've stayed here twice. During my most recent stay, I was in a Disney Vacation Club room, which was very nice. But I found it to be a little bit more underwhelming than a standard room.\n\nThe BoardWalk Inn also lacks variety in the quick-service-dining department. The Boardwalk Bakery menu is limited, and it's one of the only places to grab a quick breakfast before heading to the theme parks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPop Century is a value resort that feels more expensive.\n\nLevel: Value\n\nStarting room rate: $175\n\nThe renovated rooms are beautiful and modern looking, and I think the rates offer a better value than the All-Star Resorts. The resort is also great for taking photos with its Disney character statues and groovy walls.\n\nThe only real con is that I find the Skyliner (Disney's free gondola transportation system) to be an inefficient way of getting around the property. I usually have to wait a while, especially if I'm trying to rope-drop Epcot or Hollywood Studios.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilderness Lodge has one of the nicest lobbies on the property.\n\nLevel: Deluxe\n\nStarting room rate: $460\n\nI love Wilderness Lodge and its theming — even though it's very outdoorsy and far from what I'm used to as a native New Yorker.\n\nIt's also home to one of my favorite character-dining locations on the property: Story Book Dining at Artist Point With Snow White.\n\nBut the rooms here don't wow me. Although mine was spacious, it was nowhere near as aesthetically pleasing as the rest of the resort.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Grand Floridian is so elegant.\n\nLevel: Deluxe\n\nStarting room rate: $795\n\nIf you're looking to experience luxury and elegance, Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa is the place for you. There aren't usually hundreds of children running around, and when I am on vacation, I like to get away from the crowds and spend time relaxing.\n\nThe resort has several transportation options. Guests can walk or take a boat or monorail to Magic Kingdom, and there are buses available to the other theme parks.\n\nGrand Floridian is also home to the \"Beauty and the Beast\"-themed lounge, Enchanted Rose, which serves my favorite mocktail on the property, the Rosemary Cooler.\n\nThe rooms are very spacious, and I love the attached patios overlooking the lagoon, garden, or Magic Kingdom.\n\nAlthough this resort is elegant, it doesn't have as much of the homey feel I get from many other Disney resorts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Contemporary Resort has so many great photo ops.\n\nLevel: Deluxe\n\nStarting room rate: $550\n\nDisney's Contemporary Resort is very close to Magic Kingdom — the convenient walkway allows me to get to the park in about eight minutes. That's super helpful when I'm trying to rope-drop and avoid early morning crowds.\n\nThe resort is home to many cute walls and structures that make for great photo ops. Some of my favorites include the metal Mickey Mouse structure located outside near the pool area, the four neon Mickeys on the wall on the fourth floor, and the store sign of the Fantasia gift shop.\n\nBut the Contemporary can be a bit confusing for first-time visitors as things aren't centrally located. For example, the lobby is on a different floor from the gift shops and restaurants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI'm in love with the pool at Yacht Club.\n\nLevel: Deluxe\n\nStarting room rate: $545\n\nYacht Club and Beach Club share what is arguably the best aquatic area on the property: Stormalong Bay. I've spent hours in the pool area, and it even has a lazy river.\n\nThe resort is a quick walk away from both Epcot and Hollywood Studios. And the rooms are spacious — out of all of the resorts I've stayed in, this room was the biggest.\n\nThe hefty price is definitely a con, and the quick-service dining options are lacking. Its Market at Ale & Compass largely serves sandwiches and salads.\n\nIf you're paying more than $500 a night, I think there should be more food options available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeach Club is home to my favorite ice-cream sundae.\n\nLevel: Deluxe\n\nStarting room rate: $545\n\nThe Beach Club is similar in style to the Yacht Club, but I prefer this one because I feel more at home here. I like the blue-and-white color scheme throughout the resort.\n\nLike its neighboring resorts, it's a quick walk away from Epcot and Hollywood Studios. It's also home to Beaches & Cream Soda Shop, which offers my favorite ice-cream sundae on the property: the Kitchen Sink.\n\nWith that in mind, I tend to have to wait a long time for the buses back to the resort from the theme parks, especially when I'm taking a midday break. I've waited over 45 minutes before, which can be extremely frustrating when paying top dollar for a deluxe resort.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolynesian Village will always be my favorite resort at Disney World.\n\nLevel: Deluxe\n\nStarting room rate: $662\n\nThe rooms at the Polynesian are beautifully themed. I recently stayed in a Disney Vacation Club studio room and had a great experience.\n\nBut my favorite part about this resort is the variety of dining options — you can spend a whole day trying all the unique treats and beverages. The dinner at 'Ohana is one of my favorite meals at Disney World.\n\nThe resort also serves pineapple, orange, guava, or POG, juice, which is my favorite.\n\nThe main Lava pool is gorgeous, with a towering volcano structure and a water slide. Plus, my favorite place to watch Magic Kingdom's fireworks is on the beach outside the Polynesian. The music is even piped into the area.\n\nOn the flip side, due to the popular restaurants, there are often guests from other resorts visiting the Polynesian, which can make it kind of loud and chaotic.\n\nRead next\n\nTravel Disney Disney World\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement"
