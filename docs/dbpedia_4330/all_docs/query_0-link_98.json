        "text": "If anyone is looking to name a racehorse the ever-increasing list of possible names is free to all. My only request is that a donation of £25 is made to any racehorse rehabilitation Charity.\n\nI was once told by someone from the B.H.A. that it was not as easy I believed to name a Racehorse. I beg to differ. The English language alone is as vast as the Cosmos. It has now, I admit, become an Obsession. I see potential names for racehorses in books, house-names, streets, films, you name it, horses names leap out at me.\n\nObviously I would like to own horses myself and to give them what I consider to be sensible names. This will never happen. I think the knowledge I will never own a racehorse is the cause for my obsession. I do not make the claim that every name listed below will be accepted by the B.H.A., nor do I claim that every name is original. What I do claim is no great horse of the past has carried any name I place on the list. Thank you.\n\n​Running Head Lion Passant Quarterings Blackwall Hitch Half Hitch Stevedore's Knot Poniard Collier\n\nEscort Carrier Retiarius Testudo Mauser Guddling Fancy Fly Hackle Fly Intercut Terry
