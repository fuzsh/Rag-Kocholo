My parents would take me and my brothers to see them all the time. Even now as an adult, I still love going to see them.\n\nMy favorites include Frozen and Toy Story. I could watch them over and over again and never get tired of them. Disney movies are some of the most popular movies of all time. They are loved by people of all ages and have been entertaining audiences for decades.\n\nIf you’re like me you might want to name your next pet after a character from your favorite Disney movie.\n\nDisney Names for Pets\n\nIf you’re choosing a Disney character name for a pet, there are a few things you need to keep in mind.\n\nFirst, make sure the name is easy to say and spell. You also want to choose a name that fits the personality of your pet. Finally, make sure the name isn’t already similar to another pet in your household.\n\nAssuming you have a dog, some good Disney character names for them might be Goofy, Pluto, or Pongo.\n\nIf you have a cat, characters like Simba, Oliver, or Duchess might be a good fit.\n\nAnd if you have another type of pet, there are still plenty of great Disney options to choose from, like Mushu, Stitch, or Thumper.\n\nThe House of Mouse\n\nA list of characters associated with Mickey Mouse.\n\nNameDescriptionGenderMickeyMouseMaleMinnieMouseFemaleGoofyDogMalePlutoMickey’s dogMaleDonaldDuckMaleDaisyDuckFemaleHueyDonald’s NephewMaleDeweyDonald’s NephewMaleLouieDonald’s NephewMaleChipChipmunkMaleDaleChipmunkMale\n\nCute Disney Names for a Pair of Pets\n\nIf you have a pair of new pets then maybe you could name them after a famous Disney pairing such as:\n\nMickey & Minnie\n\nDonald & Daisy\n\nChip & Dale\n\nIf you’re looking for a pair of name’s from a Disney movie then there are:\n\nLilo & Stitch (Lilo & Stitch)\n\nPeter & Wendy (Peter Pan)\n\nWoody & Buzz (Toy Story)\n\nLuca & Alberto (Luca)\n\nTimon & Pumbaa (The Lion King)\n\nOf course if you have a trio of new pets in your life why not go with Donald Duck’s mischievous nephews – Huey, Dewey & Louie.\n\nDisney Animal Names\n\nDisney has made dozens of movies over the years and many of them have become part of pop culture.\n\nDisney has created some of the most famous animal characters in movie history.
