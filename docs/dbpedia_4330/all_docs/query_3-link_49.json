This mural has a forest with various animals. If you look at the leaves of a certain tree, you will find that they form a sideways Hidden Mickey. (Inside The Mara Restaurant, what do you think about this group of green tree leaves? Find them in the middle of the rear wall of the seating area. A sideways – to the left – classic Hidden Mickey?)"
