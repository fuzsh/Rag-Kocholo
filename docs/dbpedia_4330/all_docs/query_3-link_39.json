        "text": "1 / 13\n\nAdrian Coleman/Getty Images\n\nWhat Are Rodents?\n\nIf you hear scuttling in the attic or scurrying in the basement, you likely have one of the most common uninvited houseguests in America: rodents. According to Jim Fredericks, Ph.D., chief entomologist for the National Pest Management Association, “Every winter, 21 million homes are invaded by mice and rats, posing a major health and property threat to homeowners.” Learn how to recognize different types of mice.\n\nRodents — that vast class of mammals characterized by prominent front incisors, perfectly evolved for gnawing to get at food and shelter — are a particularly destructive pest.\n\n“Known for their ability to squeeze through tight spaces,” says Fredericks, “these pests are capable of transmitting over 35 diseases to humans, triggering asthma and allergy symptoms, and causing serious structural damage due to their propensity to chew through electrical wiring, plastic and drywall. Because of rodents’ ability to reproduce quickly, infestations can rapidly get out of hand, making proper prevention crucial.”\n\nAct quickly once you spot signs of infestation. A DIY solution is fine for mice, but you’ll need a professional pest control expert for larger and more aggressive rodents. First, though, determine what type of rodent you’re dealing with. Here’s a list of the most common and how to identify them.\n\nⓘ\n\n2 / 13\n\nicefront/Getty Images\n\nHouse Mouse (Mus domesticus)\n\nSmall, gray or light brown, and topped by Mickey-size ears, the house mouse is the most common invasive rodent found across the U.S. Although it rarely grows longer than four inches, don’t let its small size fool you. These incessant gnawers can wreak havoc on your home, and their rapid reproduction leads to a full-blown infestation in just weeks.\n\nCheck common nesting spots like attics or suspended ceilings, wall cavities, crawlspaces and kitchen areas (behind refrigerators, under stoves and inside cabinets and pantries). Look for telltale signs like gnawing marks, 1/4-in. droppings that are smooth with pointed ends, ammonia-like urine odor and tracks.\n\nPrevention is the key to deterring these little pests, which can squeeze through an opening the width of a pencil. So regularly check and seal all gaps and cracks, from basement to rooftop.\n\n3 / 13\n\nKarel Bock/Getty Images\n\nDeer Mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus)\n\nThis small brown rodent lives outside in rural areas most of the year but often takes shelter inside country houses and vacation homes when temperatures drop. Growing no longer than eight inches, deer mice can pass through a hole as small as a dime. They settle in attics or basements by gnawing nests into boxes or drawers, cushions and stuffed furniture, and wall voids.\n\nDeer mice are common carriers of the hantavirus, which can cause Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome for those who come into contact with their urine or carcasses. Be sure to properly seal your home before winter and use heavy gloves and a mask when setting and emptying traps.\n\n4 / 13\n\nRobert Pickett/Getty Images\n\nNorway Rat (Rattus norvegicus)\n\nGrowing up to 10 inches long, with another 10 inches of tail, this brown rodent commonly known as a sewer rat is startling to come across indoors and out. These formidable pests can chew through almost any material — including PVC and metal pipes — and fit through a hole as small as a quarter. They nest in ground-level areas like basements, crawlspaces, garbage cans and woodpiles.\n\nNorway rats live across the U.S. and are known to be social animals, so if you find one nest there are likely to be others nearby. They also reproduce rapidly, giving birth to a litter every two months.\n\nThese rodents bring with them serious health threats, as carriers of trichinosis, salmonellosis, rat-bite fever, jaundice and other diseases. To prevent attracting them near or into your home, place woodpiles or other debris far away and carefully seal all holes and crevices along the foundation.\n\n5 / 13\n\nGlobalP/Getty Images\n\nRoof Rat (Rattus rattus)\n\nSmaller and darker than ground-dwelling Norway rats, roof rats (also known as black rats, house rats, ship rats or fruit rats) tend to nest in attics or upper parts of buildings. Found primarily in the coastal and southern states, these dark-brown or black rodents generally grow no larger than about eight inches long and have a thinner, more elongated body than their heftier Norway cousins.\n\nThe most common signs of roof rat infestation? Shiny black droppings that are soft and moist if fresh or hard and dried if old. as well as scurrying noises from the attic or walls, gnawed furnishings or wiring and tracks or grease marks along the lower walls or baseboards. Like Norway rats, roof rats live in colonies, reproduce rapidly, and carry parasites and diseases, including the bubonic plague.\n\nPrevent infestations by carefully sealing crevices and holes as small as a nickel on the roof and upper parts of your home.\n\n6 / 13\n\nJuerg Schreiter/Shutterstock\n\nSquirrel (Sciuridae)\n\nThe squirrel family comprises tree squirrels, ground squirrels and flying squirrels, as well as chipmunks and prairie dogs. The most common culprit in home infestations is the tree squirrel, found throughout the U.S. and recognizable by its gray or tan fur and signature bushy tail.\n\nAgile acrobats, squirrels can easily jump from tree limb to rooftop. So if you hear scurrying noises, come across droppings or notice chewed and damaged entry points, you may have a squirrel nest in your attic.\n\nKeep tree limbs trimmed far from your roof and seal holes and crevices to keep the neighborhood squirrels out. These skilled gnawers can compromise heating and air conditioning systems, wiring, insulation, roofing, fascia, soffits and storage boxes. Never trap an animal and let it die in your attic. The carcass poses significant health and hygiene risks.\n\n8 / 13\n\nStan Tekiela Author / Naturalist / Wildlife Photographer/Getty Images\n\nPrairie Dog (Cynomys ludovicianus)\n\nNative to the Great Plains, this member of the squirrel family is unlikely to damage your home but can devastate your yard and garden. Light brown with a white belly and black-tipped tail, prairie dogs burrow underground in colonies. A single animal can consume up to two pounds of grass, flowers, shoots, roots and seeds a day, making short work of your lawn and vegetable garden.\n\nInstalling fences and hay bales that impede the animals’ view of their surroundings discourages prairie dog infestations. But keep watch for signs like a clutch of small holes in the ground, mounds of dirt and clipped vegetation.\n\n9 / 13\n\nRudmer Zwerver/Shutterstock\n\nVole (Microtus spp.)\n\nLike prairie dogs, voles compromise your yard and garden by burrowing extensive tunnel systems beneath the ground and feeding on roots, bulbs and small plants. Also known as meadow mice or field mice, these small brown or gray rodents have a long mouse-like tail, but small eyes and ears, and grow up to eight inches long.\n\nThere are dozens of species of voles across the U.S. Their rapid reproduction can quickly lead to an infestation that spells trouble for your property. Keep your lawn and outdoor plants well trimmed and limit weeds and other wild vegetation to discourage voles. Learn the difference between voles versus moles.\n\n10 / 13\n\nArt-Benco/Getty Images\n\nGopher (Geomyidae)\n\nIf crescent- or horseshoe-shaped mounds of soil with small circular holes start showing up in your yard, you probably have a resident gopher. Common in most of the U.S., this small rodent can be black to light brown in color and is often called a pocket gopher, due to its fur-lined cheek pouches.\n\nGophers live in underground burrows made of connecting tunnels. They eat roots, bulbs and tree bark, all of which spells trouble for your lawn and garden. Gophers can have litters every few weeks, leading to a population boom that can quickly devastate your property.\n\n11 / 13\n\nJeff Clow / EyeEm/Getty Images\n\nGroundhog (Marmota monax)\n\nHow much wood could a woodchuck chuck? Enough to make a serious dent in your trees and plants, if left to its own devices.\n\nGroundhogs, also known as woodchucks, are found in most states. Often mistaken for gophers, they are significantly larger and heavier than their fellow burrowing rodents. Their chunky bodies are covered in grizzled brown fur and they can grow up to two feet long. Their front paws have long, curved claws for digging.\n\nAlthough groundhogs can sometimes take shelter in crawl spaces and may gnaw through electrical lines while tunneling, the more common threat they pose is to your lawn and landscaping."
