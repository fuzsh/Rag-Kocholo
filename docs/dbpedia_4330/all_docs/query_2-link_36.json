        "text": "Murals and Visual Art\n\nOutside museum walls, sculpture art adorns parks, plazas and walkways. The sculptures of nationally known artists David Cargill and Ron Petitt grace Beaumont and Southeast Texas. Murals welcome visitors to downtown Beaumont and at the Jack Brooks Regional Airport (BPT). Take an architectural walking tour of the Beaumont Commercial District. The entire district is considered a U.S. Historic District on the National Register - one of the few areas like it in the country.\n\nThe Beaumont/Port Arthur area has always been a hotbed for creative talent, home to famed visual artists like Robert Rauschenberg, whose colorful mixed media works have served as inspiration for decades. Over the past few years, murals have become a big part of the landscape with the CVB investing thousands upon thousands of dollars into beautifying the city through colorful art. Whether you're looking to brighten up your Instagram feed or are merely in need of some inspiration, here are Beaumont's best murals to seek out."
