        "text": "Now that the holiday season has rolled around, both parents and kids have one main thing on their minds: Toys!\n\nBut while kids spend most of that time excitedly counting down the days until they get to open their presents, parents have the tough job of finding the toys that they’ll actually love. And that’s why every year, plenty of gift-givers turn to The Toy Insider’s annual toy lists to help guide their decision.\n\nFor those who are looking to get that tough job over with as early as possible this year, we have some exciting news: Laurie Schacht, President and Chief Toy Officer at the Toy Insider, stopped by TODAY to share some of the best last-minute holiday toys to shop now. In her product lineup are mini collectables, coloring books, and other interactive options that suit a variety of age groups.\n\nBest holiday toys seen on TODAY | More toys seen on TODAY | Previously seen on TODAY | Hot 20 | 12 Under $20 | STEM 10\n\nTo create the list each year, The Toy Insider team starts testing the toys in October of the year prior — and they try out thousands before narrowing it down to the final ones. When analyzing toys for the list, the team reviews them based on five different criteria points — skill building, play value (how much playtime kids can get out of a toy when compared to its cost), originality, product integrity (\"does the toy do what it's supposed to do, what kids expect it to do?\") and, finally, fun factor. They also make sure the list feels balanced across price points and interests.\n\nThe hottest and most popular items are then broken down into three lists: Hot 20, 12 Under $20 and STEM 10. Picks on the list range from affordable stocking stuffers to sought-after finds from brands like Pokémon, Lego, Barbie, L.O.L. Surprise! and more.\n\nRegardless of their age, there’s something in this list for every stage they’re in. Below are the most popular toys to shop during the holidays, according to the Toy Insider.\n\nLet Shop TODAY find discounts and rewards for you! Download the free Shop TODAY Savings browser extension and automatically save at over 40,000 retailers.\n\nBest holiday toys to shop now, as seen on TODAY\n\nVTech Marble Rush Sky Elevator Set\n\nThis elevator set allows them to explore their imagination with curved tracks and slides that can connect in various ways. With over 150 pieces, the max height that the elevator can reach is an impressive three feet, indicating that parents can also tag along with building. Once the structure is set, place the marbles wherever you desire to watch them go. Six AAA batteries are required.\n\nMGA’s Miniverse Entertainment Make It Mini Food Diner Series\n\nAccording to the brand, there are only three steps to this collectable: set, prep and display. Each mini ball comes with a set of tiny ingredients and kitchen accessories to replicate their favorite treats. Once the ingredients are set in place, the instructions suggest placing it under UV light so that the resin can harden, and then the mini dish can be played with or displayed.
