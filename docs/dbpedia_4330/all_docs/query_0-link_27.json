Governor of Ontario\n\nDateline: 6/27/1999\n\nA full field of 17 went to the post in the 140th renewal of Canada's premier race for 3 year olds, the Queen's Plate. Gustav Schickedanz stole the show by winning not only the Queen's Plate with Woodcarver but also the Grade 2 Nearctic Stakes with the long shot Clever Response. The victory was the first Queen's Plate win for local top rider Mickey Walls. Long shot Gandria came back from a fourth place finish in the Canadian Oaks to rally for second. Frank Stronach sent a 3 horse entry including his second place finisher from the Canadian Oaks but the best he could manage was third with the Bobby Frankel trained Euchre.\n\nThe day was marred by a nasty breakdown in the 10th race. Receive the King was to be Mickey Walls next mount but he took off to attend to the post Queen's Plate interviews and Emile Ramsammy picked up the mount. He was near the lead when he broke down, unseating Ramsammy and sending him for a nasty spill. Receive the King had to be euthanized and Ramsammy was listed in stable condition with a broken collar bone and fractured right knee.\n\n3 Woodcarver 9.30 6.40 4.50 11 Gandria 44.60 17.20 2B Euchre 2.90 $2 Exactor $561.60 $2 Triactor $2,094.40 Final Time: 2:03.13\n\nFull Chart\n\nWoodcarver in the post parade.\n\nThe horses break from the gate in the 140th Queen's Plate.\n\nThe horses pass the post for the first time with Great Defender on the lead and eventual winner Woodcarver on the rail.\n\nWoodcarver drawing off to win by 5 lengths in 2:03.13\n\nThe happy connections with their winner.\n\nThe trophy presentation for the 140th Queen's Plate\n\nClever Response winning the Grade 2 Nearctic Stakes earlier in the card.
