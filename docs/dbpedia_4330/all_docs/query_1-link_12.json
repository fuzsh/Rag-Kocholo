        "text": "The Purple Wall: A Disney World icon that has grown as Instagram-famous as Spaceship Earth and Cinderella Castle. But where is the Purple Wall, and why is everyone so fascinated with it?\n\n“Meet me at the Purple Wall.” It’s an expression that’s become as common as “Meet me in the hub” when texting friends your whereabouts or agreeing on a meet-up place with a fracturing family. But the Purple Wall has only been an iconic part of the now 50-year-old Magic Kingdom for roughly the last half a decade.\n\nSo where is the purple wall, what does it look like, and how did it suddenly land on every Millennial’s and Gen Z’s bucket list at Disney World?\n\n[metaslider id=”50088″]\n\nWhere Is the Purple Wall? In Tomorrowland … Barely\n\nThe Purple Wall at Disney World is located just at the entrance of Tomorrowland in Magic Kingdom, tucked away to the side on a little-used walkway that connects to Main Street. If you weren’t explicitly searching for this specific wall, it’s likely you’d never even pass it, even if you spent all week at Magic Kingdom.\n\nThat’s because the Purple Wall is smack dab in between Monsters, Inc, Laugh Floor and Tomorrowland Terrace Restaurant. Forget that Tomorrowland Terrace Restaurant is not very popular and closed often; even if you were dining here, the only reason you’d see the special wall is if you were fixated on hitting up Mike and Scully immediately after.\n\nOr, if after burning off too many calories laughing with your favorite monsters, you decided you wanted a Lobster Roll from Tomorrowland Terrace, you might zip by the wall on your way to the restaurant.\n\nOtherwise, the Purple Wall would stand unpassed.\n\nThat was until 2015, when Instagrammers found the iconic wall that always seems to have nice lighting.\n\nPsst … Follow us on Instagram!\n\nHow to Find the Purple Wall on a Disney World Map\n\nThe History of the Purple Wall\n\nFor about three years, the Purple Wall was famous, a nice shade of lilac that served as a good backdrop for social media photos. You know, because if you didn’t take a picture at Disney World and post it online, were you even really there?\n\nBut then, in 2018, Disney did the unthinkable. They painted the wall. Blasphemy!\n\nLuckily, the geometric design of the repainted Purple Wall sat well with selfie-takers (and it’s still purple, phew). In fact, the new wall was even more appealing to the eye and has encouraged even more photography.\n\nThere’s nothing noteworthy over this way, but without fail, if you’re heading into Tomorrowland from the hub and look right, you’ll likely see someone posing for pictures—and on busy days, a line of others waiting for their turn.\n\nI wouldn’t be surprised if the Purple Wall didn’t get its own Lightning Lane here soon.\n\nNo, seriously. Disney has leaned into the Purple Wall craze with its own Purple Wall merch, including ballcaps and even MagicBands.\n\nWant to take a ride even further back in Disney history?
