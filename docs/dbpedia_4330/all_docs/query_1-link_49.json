        "text": "America’s favorite mouse, Mickey, is all grown up, thanks to Ethan Allen, which Nov. 18, on the famous rodent’s 88th birthday, launched the 500-plus piece Ethan Allen/Disney Collection.\n\nGiven that Ethan Allen is putting its imprint on the series, this is serious fun.\n\n“Ethan Allen | Disney is like nothing we’ve ever done, and nothing you’ve ever seen,” says Ethan Allen chairman, president and CEO Farooq Kathwari, whose interest in a Disney line was sparked by a trip to Disney World for his granddaughter’s fifth birthday.\n\n“Combining our core strengths of craftsmanship, style, and quality with Disney’s rich storytelling, we’ve created an experience that kids and parents will truly love and appreciate.”\n\nDon’t tell the kids, but the Ethan Allen’s take on Disney is not just kid stuff. This is the stuff of dreams for any Mousekeeter of any age, and given the Space Coast’s fascination with Mouse magic, the new line should prove very popular in Brevard.\n\n“The interest is definitely there,” says Carol Chatel, a design consultant with Ethan Allen at the Avenue Viera.\n\n“It was created with the whole family in mind. The company has taken great pains with the design.”\n\nThe new line is all about Mickey and his lady, Minnie, so don’t expect many other Disney characters to muscle in on the sophisticated yet fun pieces that range in price from $19 to upwards of $1,500.\n\n“It’s real quality, with lots of options,” adds Chatel.\n\nDesigned for every room in the house and for everyone in the home, Ethan Allen | Disney struts happily from the nurseries and kids’ rooms, spilling onto the rest of the house with accessories that include art and wall décor, rugs, lighting, bedding and chic storage pieces such as Chatel’s personal favorite, the nailhead-trimmed, pink Tuft Love Sofette.\n\n“I could see that working well at the foot of the bed in a master bedroom,” says Chatel.\n\n“Its smaller scale makes it perfect for apartment or condo living.”\n\nMany styles feature cool nods to retro Disney designs, playful shapes, and signature Mickey and Minnie details. The Modern Spindle Floor Lamp($599), for example, is an eye magnet in Mickey Mouse shorts red and a stacked graduated spool design.\n\nFor the living room, the collection offers sectionals, as well as unique coffee tables such as the Mickey-eared It All Started with a Mouse. Inspired by the “Hidden Mickeys” with which Disney loves to mesmerize theme park visitors, the $1,299 table is actually a trio of oak nesting tables. When not in use, the two smaller tables fit nearly under the larger one. Take them out and voila! It’s Mickey silhouette hidden in plain sight.\n\nThe Comic Play Table ($399) nods to mid-century design with minimalist hairpin legs. Its top features vintage black-and-white comic strip panels of America’s favorite mouse and his buddies.\n\nAlso sporting vintage comic strips, the Big Moment Comic Pendant ($129) would look nicely at home as a trio over an island or as an collection of five hung at different heights throughout the family hub, the area of the home where everyone tends to gravitate.\n\nMinnie’s Beaded Wall Sconce ($169) is all about super-bling every princess needs. Translucent beads make up the Minnie silhouette design on the polished nickel frame.\n\nThose who just can’t get enough of Mickey will certainly gravitate to the Mickey Everywhere chair ($719) with its iconic mouse ears and chic saber legs. Use them in the dining room, as a desk or accent chair or in front of a vanity.\n\nFor the entryway, there’s the Character Chest ($1,599), finished in matte black matched with the contemporary vibe of a sleek brushed nickel base. The three-drawer chest sports a vintage black-and-white cartoon of Mickey with his pup, Pluto, taking a selfie with an old bellows camera, no less.\n\nSome of the pieces, such as the Not Your Traditional Rug ($1,099) are subtle in their nod to Disney, but it’s there if you look hard enough. The pretty, patterned rug, inspired by classic, hand-knotted designs, may look formal, but there are some hidden Minnie Mouses for you to discover.\n\nThe most whimsical and iconic piece in the collection may well be the Bravo Chair($1,479) a showstopper with a sweeping wingchair silhouette hand upholstered with striking Mr. Mouse fabric.\n\nMickey, the eternally happy fellow, is ready to lift moods, wall to wall and floor to ceiling, with his new Ethan Allen foray into high end furnishings.\n\n“It brings a little bit of magic wherever you put it,” says Jim DeBernardo, Ethan Allen vice president of style in a video Disney Style uses to promote the new collection.\n\nEthan Allen in Brevard"
