        "text": "Finding hidden Mickeys is something of an art form in Disney World.\n\nWe’ve seen some super tricky hidden Mickeys, some that you can’t even see from the ground, and even one that will probably never reappear in the parks again. But there’s one very famous Hidden Mickey that can only be seen for a little while once per YEAR.\n\nWhen Imagineers created the queue area for the Journey of the Little Mermaid attraction in the Magic Kingdom, they slipped in a couple of amazing details that guests can find, if they know where to look.\n\nNo, we’re not talking about the hidden Steamboat Willie that you can see in the rocks at the exit queue (though this one can be VERY difficult to see).\n\nThere’s actually a hidden Mickey in the queue before you get to the ride that only appears once a year! On Mickey Mouse’s birthday — November 18th — around noon you can try to find this detail. We were waiting in the queue for 12PM to hit in an attempt to catch a glimpse!\n\nAnd we weren’t the only ones there, either. This is a really cool hidden detail, and it seems like a few more people were in on the secret.\n\nWant in on it too? If you’re in the queue, look up at the rocks above you. There’s one area where sunlight comes through a hole. If you look carefully at the rock edges around the hole, you’ll see a couple of edges that look something like Mickey — or at least part of his head.\n\nAt noon on November 18th, if the sun shines perfectly through those rocks, it’ll create a sunny Mickey shape on a nearby wall area in the queue. The only problem? It was cloudy today! We were all ready to see this exciting detail, but the sun wasn’t shining enough, which meant no Mickey for us.\n\nBut if you happen to be in the Magic Kingdom on November 18th around noon next year, be sure to look out for this incredible Imagineering detail. And keep following DFB for more tips as you plan your upcoming trip!\n\nClick Here to Learn 30 Hidden Secrets About the Magic Kingdom"
