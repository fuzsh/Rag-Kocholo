        "text": "Every August, teachers decorate classrooms and prepare for students to return to school. As a rite of passage for the new year, teachers create lists of items they'd like to get to enhance and nurture students.\n\nMost of the time, wish list expenses end up coming out of pocket and can be expensive, said Lesa Wrinkle, a 10-year teacher at Springwood Elementary School, who said she has spent a large amount of money in her classroom over the years.\n\nMarcy Grauer, a 20-year veteran teacher at Killearn Lakes who is currently fighting stage 4 colon cancer, is hoping to get fun and cool new gear for her new students.

As a result, teachers are calling out to the community for help.\n\nIn collaboration with the Leon Classroom Teachers Association, the Tallahassee Democrat has identified Amazon wish lists from teachers like Wrinkle and Grauer so residents can help support teachers and students.\n\nIf you are a local teacher with an Amazon wish list, email information to abrown@tallahassee.com for it to be featured in this rolling list:\n\nHere's a list of teachers' needs\n\nTo buy items off of a wish list, go to the online version of this story on tallahassee.com and click on the teacher's name.\n\nAlaina Davis is a fourth-grade teacher of \"reading superheroes\" at Bond Elementary.
