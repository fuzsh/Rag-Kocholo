        "text": "While visiting EPCOT earlier today, we noticed that construction walls have been expanded for work related to a walkway that passes by CommuniCore Hall. The walkway in question is the one that was recently closed that goes from the World Celebration Gardens area toward the Imagination Pavilion.\n\nNow, construction walls have expanded toward a nearby planter. Here’s a look around from this morning. We’ll start with a look at the construction walls from the southernmost point of the World Celebration Gardens, looking toward World Showcase.\n\nHere’s a look from the opposite side of the walls. That is, from the southern side of the planter, looking north toward Spaceship Earth. This planter used to have the Disney100 photo op, but it was removed overnight like the other Disney100 displays at the Walt Disney World theme parks.\n\nHopefully, the work in this area doesn’t take too long considering a lot of construction walls were just removed which also removed the bottlenecks that this now creates.\n\nFor a recent look at the work taking place on CommuniCore Hall, check out our article below!"
