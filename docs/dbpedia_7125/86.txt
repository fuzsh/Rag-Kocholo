1976-1985

In the years 1976/1977 the hotel as we know it today was built for the workers involved in the construction of drinking water reservoir. From 1978 to 1983, the building was used as a workers' accommodation.

The dam of Eibenstock is the 2nd largest drinking water reservoir of East Germany covering an area of 324 hectares with a maximum length of 7 km, a maximum width of 1 km and a maximum depth of 55 meters.

In 1985, then the inauguration of the dam Eibenstock took place. In the same year the workers' accommodation was turned into a FDGB - holiday home and continued to operate.

1989 - 1997

When the wall came down in 1989 the property was passed into the hands of “Treuhand”, which continued running it as a hotel until 1991.

In 1991 the town of Eibenstock took over the hotel. In 1995 it changed hands on last time. It is now owed by and consortium of local companies.

In January 1996, the hotel was closed in order to carry out some major refurbishment and redecoration. After months and months of work the hotel “Hotel am Bühl- das blaue Wunder” was reopened on 12 July 1997.
