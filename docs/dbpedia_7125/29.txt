The dam was built between 1949 and 1952 in the Höllengrund near Eibenstock in the Ore Mountains and taken into service in 1952. The dam itself is a crooked gravity dam made of quarrystone. It is the last dam of this type that was built in Germany. The impounded stream is the Kleine Bockau.

In addition the waters of the Große Bockau are diverted along a hillside channel west of the Auersberg from Oberwildenthal via Wildenthal to the reservoir.
