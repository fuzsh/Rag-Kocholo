Dedicated to St. Oswald, the church tower is quite noteworthy and stands at a height of 64 meters (209.74 feet). The marble and sandstone altar is beautifully decorated and the baptismal font dates back to the 19th Century. The majestic 36-registers organ was built by Richard Bach Kreutz in 1868.",
