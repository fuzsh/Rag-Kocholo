        "text": "The Christmas decorations were truly amazing and gave me a true festive experience. the hotel was in a great location that perfectly contributes to a quiet and secluded holiday.\n\nThe room was small and not very clean. the bathroom was tiny and the bed was quite uncomfortable.\n\nThe hotel was in a prime location, with the shops and town center just a short walk away. The view from the room was stunning and the decor was charming. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the restaurant served excellent cuisine. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable with free Wi-Fi, satellite TV and toiletries. The breakfast offered a good selection of cheese and ham, but could have benefitted from fresh vegetables.\n\nThe single room was slightly small and not ideal for larger guests.\n\nThe location was great, surrounded by nature. The bed was comfy and the room spacious. The restaurant had delicious food and a beautiful outside area to enjoy a coffee or lunch. The staff was friendly and helpful, making us feel at home. a warm and welcoming atmosphere.\n\nThe breakfast lacked fresh vegetables, which was a downside for me. The shower enclosure was quite small, making it difficult to move around in.\n\nWe had a great time at this hotel. Best aspects were the comfortable bed, spacious room, and excellent restaurant. We also loved the beautiful outside space for lunch and coffee. Staff were friendly and helpful, and the location was perfect with easy parking.\n\nNo issues."
