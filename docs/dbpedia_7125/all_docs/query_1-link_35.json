        "text": "The Filzteich (pond) is one of the earliest and largest reservoirs in the Schneeberg mining district. Its geographical position enabled water to be supplied both directly and indirectly to most of the mines. Together with its branched water inlets, it forms the western border of the Schneeberg-Neustädtler mining landscape. The Filzteich takes its name from the peat bogs in the catchment area, which were known as “Filz” (felt) in the local jargon. It was formed by damming the Seifenbach and Filzbach streams. The former of these streams was named after the placer tin deposits, which used to be extracted here. The excess water found its way via the Filzbach through the town of Zschorlau, then on to Aue and finally flowed (as the Zschorlaubach stream) into the Zwickauer Mulde river. A dam breach in 1783 led to the devastation of large areas in the downstream valleys, resulting in the death of 18 people. As a result of the dam breach, a new kind of water control system was subsequently built, which provided the pond with a new spillway on its completion in 1786. The extended supplying and water gathering ditches are situated in the Hartmannsdorfer Forst (forest) area west of the Filzteich (pond). Traces of old mining have been preserved in this area, for example Raithalden (heaps of the tin placer mining). The Filzteich possesses an earth dam, loam sealed on the water side, and a terrace wall. The dam, formed in the shape of an arch and adapted to the geographical environment, features a release and spill mechanism. There is no wave-breaking wall to protect the dam crest."
