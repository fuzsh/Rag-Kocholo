        "text": "^ How do those work? Do you have the Micromot system?\n\nitÂ´s just a tool holder with a little screw on top so you can attach cutting discs or grinding wheels.\n\nI own the Micromot 50/E die grinder but i usually use the Proxxon IBS/E die grinder which i own too because it has more power and because i can directly plug it into a 230 volt power outlet.\n\nMy vintage socket set and ratchet. Accles & Pollock, Oldbury, England.\n\nwow cool ! Do you know the age ?\n\nChristmas present from my father, a Makita G5030:\n\nMade in Romania.\n\npic with coo please if possible\n\nPajarito putty knife\n\nwww.pajarito.de\n\nSome porn.... pardon the 'murican vise grips.\n\nMore pics: http://clients.zacharyemerick.biz/Misc-ShotsTesting/Tools/n-Q77kx/\n\nA quick break down and description of what I like/use more frequently:\n\nLeft drawer:\n\n*Large 225 Knipex Combo Pliers / Lineman Pliers: Beefiest pliers I own and use these for the jobs requiring the most strength.\n\n*165 chrome Knipex Pliers & 180 NWS Silver/yellow Pliers: Love these two and usually one or the other is in my pocket at all times.\n\n*Knipex 6-in-1 is great and has its place when I need multiple tools in one--no kidding!\n\nRight drawer:\n\n*The hose cutters in the rear are absolutely amazing and I wish I bought these long ago. They cut like a hot knife through butter!\n\n*2 x Knipex plain red handle dykes and end nippers are great for tight spots\n\n*The fantastico dyke has to be MY FAV tool in the entire box. This thing will cut nearly anything and if it can't I bump things up to the angled cobolt cutter. Job done.\n\n*Front section you've got your standard grippers of various sizes all which have their purpose.\n\nVery disappointing to see Metabo score so low. And for the price Fein thinks they can ask it's also a shame they only came in second.\n\nIs Kress very common in Europe now? What's the COO? EDIT: Oh made in Germany.\n\nThey also have some sweet looking cordless tools. Are they any good?\n\nThe Metabo couldnÂ´t make a hole with the 35mm forstner bit and couldnÂ´t drive \"longer screws\". The Fein couldnÂ´t drive the 5x100mm test screw into oak, and had problems with the forstner bit. Both drills run 4000rpm while the others are slower and/or have a more powerful motor so they have more torque. If they would test a different drill e.g. the Metabo BE4010 with 2850rpm or the new BE 500/10 then the result would be probably different. For drilling applications with twist drill bits they should work fine\n\nDonÂ´t know of Europe but here in Germany theyÂ´re not that common anymore since the 2 big box stores who offered Kress dropped them a while ago and because of the \"big box image\" the professional retailers dropped them too (at least in my city, there is only 1 retailer left) . So you can buy them only in the internet.....theyÂ´re more common as a OEM for other companies like Wurth, Flex, Eibenstock, Protool,Mafell, Spit etc....\n\nThe cordless drills usually receive good reviews in forums and at Amazon:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.de/dp/B0044YOSN8/\n\ntheir other tools too:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.de/dp/B0028S19X4/\n\nSo it seems good quality at a good price.\n\nSome PB Swiss purchases from the ubiquitous U.S. Back Friday sales. Or for all you foreign devils: Schwarze Freitag. Or Viernes Negro. Or Vendredi Noir.\n\nnice PB haul\n\nSome porn.... pardon the 'murican vise grips.\n\nwhen I need multiple tools in one--no kidding!\n\nawesome pliers drawers !\n\nNews from Bosch: 2.5AH 10,8/12 Volt batteries....\n\nWhere?\n\nAnd are they still offering it, or did I miss the boat again?\n\nNot the whole boat. They don't have 30% off anymore but I think you can still get 20% or so till the end of the year. Check their U.S web site\n\nhttp://www.garagejournal.com/forum/showthread.php?t=269546\n\nThe Metabo couldnÂ´t make a hole with the 35mm forstner bit and couldnÂ´t drive \"longer screws\".
