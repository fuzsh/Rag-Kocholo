        "text": "Vereinsbrauerei Greiz is backed by 140 years of experience in brewing making it one of the most revered places of its kind in the region. Ingredients sourced from local vendors, water from rivers flowing nearby and a traditional brewing process all come together to present connoisseurs with beers that reflect the essence of Greiz. This is an expansive facility offering beer tours for groups of 20. They also have an elaborate tour experience that's spread across three days. Aged to perfection, their Schloßpils perfectly complements seafood while the Export must be tried with some Goulash. Fürstengold is a beer commemorating Greiz and Urbräu has been around since the brewery first started production.\n\nThe Eibenstock Dam lies in the state of Saxony in Germany. It is the largest dam in this region and was built around 1984. It serves the purpose of supplying water to the regions of Chemnitz, Zwickau and also protects from floods. It impounds waters of the Zwickauer Mulde and provides extra water during times of drought. It also helps generate electricity from hydropower.\n\nOsterstein Castle (Schloss Osterstein) dates back to the Middle Ages where according to records was known as Castrum Czwickaw. However it was razed down in 1407 after a fire nearly destroyed it in 1403. It was reconstructed as a Renaissance castle in the 16th Century. This castle was used as a prison when the Zwickau Prison was formed in the 18th Century and as a World War II concentration camp. Over the several decades it fell into disrepair. It was rebuilt without any major structural changes in 2007. It is now a nursing home. Tours are available by the tourist information center however you will have to register for it."
