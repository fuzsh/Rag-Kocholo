        "text": "Both the storage capacity (75 million mÂ³), and the height of the dam (65 m) make this the largest dam in the Free State of Saxony. This dam is on the Mulde River which joins the Elbe which flows through Hamburg to empty into the North Sea. Eibenstock Dam supplies drinking water and flood control. With this volume of water, it is the second largest drinking water reservoir in the new states of eastern Germany.\n\nConstruction time: 1978 - 1984\n\nCarlsfeld Dam holds the record for the highest drinking water reservoir in Germany at 905 meters above sea level. It is also called \"Weiterswiese Dam\" after the small settlement that was flooded. The top of the dam wall can be crossed in any season. Bikers and cyclists and skiers can enjoy a very nice track around the dam.\n\nConstruction time: 1926 - 1929\n\nThe dam wall of the Sosa dam is the last stone wall that was built in Germany. In the former GDR their construction was realized shortly after their founding as a so-called youth object and thereby experienced a strong political ideology. Hence its name \"dam of peace\".\n\nConstruction time: 1949 - 1952\n\nYou can recognise family-friendly establishments at first glance by the \"family badge\". It stands for tested quality, e.g. for child-friendly leisure activities, space to play in the hotel or children's meals in the restaurant."
