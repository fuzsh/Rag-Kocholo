        "text": "The Sosa Dam (German:Talsperre Sosa) is a dam in the Free State of Saxony in East Germany. It supplies drinking water to the Western Ore Mountains as well as acting as flood protection.\n\nHistory\n\nThe dam was built between 1949 and 1952 in the Höllengrund near Eibenstock in the Ore Mountains and taken into service in 1952. The dam itself is a crooked gravity dam made of quarrystone. It is the last dam of this type that was built in Germany. The impounded stream is the Kleine Bockau.\n\nHillside channel at Wildenthal\n\nIn addition the waters of the Große Bockau are diverted along a hillside channel west of the Auersberg from Oberwildenthal via Wildenthal to the reservoir.\n\nFollowing the foundation of the state of East Germany, the construction of the dam was turned over to the Free German Youth as the first central youth objective within the first two-year plan. In view of the simple materials used for ist construction it remains even today as technically impressive. Ist realisation as a youth objective took on a strong ideological slant in the years that followed. The facility was given the sobriquet \"Dam of Peace\" (Talsperre des Friedens) and was mentioned in the Song of the Youth Brigades (Lied der Jugendbrigaden: \"We provided water in Sosa…).\n\nLeisure use\n\nNo public ways run over the dam. Bathing, angling and leisure sports are not permitted, but there is a public footpath around the reservoir. There is a car park near the dam that can be accessed by road from Sosa."
