The dam was built between 1949 and 1952 in Höllengrund south of Sosa, a district of the town of Eibenstock since 2011, in the Ore Mountains and finally put into operation in 1952. The dam is a curved gravity dam made of rubble masonry. It is the last dam of this type to be built in Germany. A mixed binder (Sosa binder) manufactured by Maxhütte Unterwellenborn with special properties in terms of strength, setting time and heat generation was used specifically for its construction. The dammed body of water is the Kleine Bockau. In addition, water from the Große Bockau is fed to the dam via the slope ditch west of the Auersberg from Oberwildenthal via Wildenthal.
