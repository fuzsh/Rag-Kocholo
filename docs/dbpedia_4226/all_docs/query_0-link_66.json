FACULTY COMMITTEES 1966-67\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n\nHISTORICAL SKETCH In 1906 \"The Fisherman's Club,\" which combined Bible study and soul winning, was organized for the young men of the Im­ manuel Presbyterian Church by Rev. T. C. Horton, assistant pastor. The following year, Mr. D. H. Steele, an elder of the same church and manager of a department store, requested Mrs. Horton to open a Bible class for the young women employed in his store, offering a large room for the purpose. The group was named \"The Lyceum Club\" and grew to include other young women besides the employees of the one store. These two groups of young people presented the challenge of further study and training. The Bible Institute idea was not en­ tirely new; as early as 1901 Mr. Lyman Stewart, a Christian lay­ man with a zeal for the Lord's service and an almost prophetic eye to the future, had planned for such a school in Los Angeles. Now, in response to an immediate need, Mr. Stewart and Mr. Horton became co-founders of the Bible Institute of Los Angeles. In the fall of 1907, through the cooperation of Rev. · A. B. Pritchard, pastor of Central Presbyterian Church, some classes which were the forerunner of the Bible Institute, were held in the lecture room of that church. On February 25, 1908, a meeting was called to effect a per­ manent organization. At this meeting the following persons were elected as officers: Lyman Stewart, President; A. B. Pritchard, Vice-President; T. C. Horton, Superintendent; R. A. Hadden, Asso­ ciate Superintendent; B. C. Atterbury, Secretary; and Leon V. Shaw, Treasurer. Messrs. Horton, Hadden, and Pritchard formed the faculty. There was rapid development of the school. From the beginning its outreach was evangelistic. Shop meetings were taken over and conducted. Bible Women's work was organized, a work among Jews was commenced, as was also Spanish Mission work and work among the men of the oil fields. Extension classes were organized in the city and in surrounding towns. Within three years the school had well outgrown the experi­ mental stage, and a forward educational step was, taken with the calling of Dr. Reuben A. Torrey to be Dean. On January 1, 1912, Dr. Torrey began his twelve-year period of service in this office. In order to meet the enlarging needs and to provide a suitable and permanent home for the school, a new site was purchased at Sixth and Hope Streets and a new building erected, ground for which was broken on June 22, 1912. This building, dedicated the following year, reflected the builders' hopes and faith for future growth.\n\nG EN E RA L 13 The next two decades witnessed the growing prestige of the school. Following this, academically, four distinct forward steps were taken in the field of Christian education. I N FO RM A T I O N / In 1936 the Institute applied for and received State authoriza­ tion for the conferring of certain degrees. Three four-year courses were then organized, leading to the degrees of Bachelor of Theo­ logy, Bachelor of Christian Education, and Bachelor of Sacred Music. In 1945, in an effort to extend the missionary training program of the Bible Institute, the School of Missionary Medicine was brought into being. This postgraduate year is planned as supple­ mentary training for missionary work and is open to graduates of any school who qualify in the spiritual, intellectual, and missionary requirements that are outlined. In the summer of 1949 another forward step was taken when, in response to repeatedly stated needs of mission boards and other Christian leaders, the school increased its faculty and enlarged its curriculum to include a Bible College with courses leading to a Bachelor of Arts degree. This school is now known academically as Biola College. The most recent expansion occurred in 1952 when, to keep Christian education in step with world missionary and evangelistic demands, the Bible Institute of Los Angeles, Incorporated, inaugu­ rated a standard three-year Theological Seminary with courses leading to a Bachelor of Divinity degree. This school was named Talbot Seminary in honor of Dr. Louis T. Talbot, who held the office of President from 1938 to 1952 and who still serves the school in the capacity of Chancellor. To meet the demands imposed by the growing student body and the enlarged curriculum a campus site of seventy acres was pur­ chased in La Mirada, twenty-two miles east of Los Angeles civic center. From the small beginning of one course of study to four distinct but related schools on an enlarged campus, the story is one of steady growth and expansion. The present organization provides for a President over the whole, with a Dean over each of the four schools, one of which, Biola College, presents this catalog. THE COMMUNITY OF LA MIRADA The community of La Mirada is in Los Angeles County, twenty­ two miles south-east of the city of Los Angeles. It lies near the center of Southern California's fastest growing area, surrounded by such cities as Whittier, Norwalk, Buena Park, Anaheim, and Fullerton. La Mirada is a planned residential community with a present population of approximately 25,000. Included within the community are two major shopping centers in addition to many other business establishments scattered throughout the area.\n\n14 /\n\nG EN E RA L I N F O RM AT I ON Visible from La Mirada are such outstanding Southern Cali­ fornia landmarks as Mount Wilson, Mount Baldy, Signal Hill, Palos Verdes, and Santa Catalina Island. Famed Knott's Berry Farm is six miles away while equally famous Disneyland is ap­ proximately twelve miles to the southeast. Within an hour's drive are such popular ocean resorts as Long Beach, Newport, Balboa, and Laguna Beach. While located sufficiently far from Los Angeles to escape its noise and congestion, La Mirada is close enough to enjoy the many cultural advantages offered by a major metropolis. Points of his­ torical interest in the form of some of California's most famous missions lie within an hour and a half's drive. Recreational facili­ ties lie close at hand. Within La Mirada will soon be created a public park comprising more than one hundred acres with hiking trails and picnic and play areas and an eighteen hole golf course. In winter, an hour's drive will take one into the nearby mountains where winter sports are available. THE BIOLA CAMPUS The campus is bounded on the West by Biola Avenue and on the East by Luitwieler. It is located midway between the large East­ West thoroughfares of Rosecrans Avenue and Imperial Highway. Approximately three miles to the south is the Santa Ana Freeway. Students coming to the campus by automobile should follow these directions: coming from the West leave the Santa Ana Free­ way at Rosecrans and travel east on the street to Biola Avenue; coming from the South-east leave the Santa Ana Freeway at Valley View and travel north on that street to Rosecrans where you turn right to Biola Avenue; coming from the East via San Bernardino Freeway (U.S. highway 60, 70, 99), turn south on California High­ way 39 to Imperial Highway, and right on Imperial to Biola Avenue. The campus, lying on gently rolling ground, is approximately seventy acres in extent. The buildings in use include Sutherland Hall (classrooms and auditorium), the science building, Rose Me­ morial Library, the music building, the commons, Pierce-Hunt Me­ morial Infirmary, three residence halls for women, a residence hall and cottages for men, the gymnasium, and the Rose of Sharon prayer chapel. Other buildings to be erected as soon as funds permit are the administration building, the student union building, the main auditorium, and additional residence halls. On the eastern side of the campus lie the athletic fields. One has an oval quarter mile track with a 220-yard straightaway and the other the baseball diamond. Outdoor basketball, badminton, tennis, and volleyball courts are available for use.\n\n15\n\nG EN E R A L I N F O R M A T I O N /\n\nTHE NATURE AND STANDARDS OF BIOLA COLLEGE Biola College is an interdenominational school of college rank emphasizing thorough scholarship and is committed to the evan­ gelical doctrines of the Christian Church. It earnestly endeavors to make these historic doctrines a vital reality in the spiritual life of this present generation. In view of the fact that founders of Biola desired to serve the Christian public, the conduct of a Biola College student is expected to conform to the highest Christian standard. The rule by which he lives is the earnest striving for God's approval and the con­ scious protection of his Christian testimony. Specifically, there are certain practices which are contrary to the standards of Biola College and from which, therefore, all stu­ dents are to refrain as long as they are in school: the use of alcoholic beverages or tobacco, attendance at commercial theatres, dancing, the use of playing cards, and gambling in any form. Since the College is interdenominational and yet theologically conservative, the Articles of Incorporation contain a doctrinal statement, an abridgement of which is given below: \"The Bible, consisting of all the books of the Old and New Testaments, is the Word of God, a supernaturally given revelation without error or misstatement in moral and spiritual teachings and record of historical facts. \"There is one God, eternally existing and manifesting Himself to us in three Persons-Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. \"Our Lord Jesus Christ was supernaturally conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit, born of a virgin, lived and taught and wrought mighty works and wonders and signs exactly as is recorded in the four Gospels, was put to death by crucifixion under Pontius Pilate, was raised from the dead in the body that had been nailed to the cross, now sits at the Father's right hand from whence He is coming again personally, bodily, and visibly to this earth to inaugurate His millennial reign. In His pre-existent state He was with God, and of His own choice laid aside His divine glory and took upon Himself the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men. He became in every respect a real man, possessed of all the essential characteristics of human nature. By His death upon the cross, the Lord Jesus Christ made a perfect atonement for sin, redeeming us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse in our place. \"The Holy Spirit is a Person, is God, and is possessed of all the distinctively divine attributes; He indwells all believers, having baptized them into the body of Christ at the time of regeneration. \"Man was created in the image of God, but the whole human race fell in the sin of the first Adam, and apart from Christ is spiritually dead and lost. Men are justified on the simple and single ground of the shed blood of Christ and upon the simple and single\n\n16 /\n\nG EN E RA L I N F O R M AT I ON condition of faith in Him who shed the blood, and are born again by the Holy Spirit, through the instrumentality of the Word of God. All those who receive Jesus Christ as their Saviour and their Lord, and who confess Him as such before their fellow men become heirs of God and joint-heirs with Jesus Christ and at death their spirits depart to be with Christ in conscious blessedness, and at the second coming of Christ their bodies shall be raised and trans­ formed into the likeness of the body of His glory. All those who persistently reject Jesus Christ in the present life shall be raised from the dead and throughout eternity exist in a state of con- scious and end less torment. · \"The Church consists of all those who, in this present dispensa­ tion, truly believe on Jesus Christ and is the body and bride of Christ, which Christ loves and for which He has given Himself. \"There is a personal devil, a being of great cunning who can exert vast power on ly so far as God suffers him to do so, and who shall ultimately be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone.\"\n\nTHE OBJECTIVES OF THE COLLEGE Accidernic Obj ectives:\n\nThe College seeks to provide thorough training and sound scholarship in all of the areas of study which are provided in its curriculum. It further seeks to create in the students a thirst for knowledge and to teach effective methods of investigation whereby such knowledge may be obtained during the course of study and in the years following their formal period of training.

The program is further designed to de­ velop and maintain high moral standards in the lives of the stu-\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION / 17 dents, for their own benefit and in order that they might serve as wholesome examples and leaders wherever they may live and work. Spiritual Obf ectives: The College aims to send forth men and women who express through their lives a complete and valid commitment to the claims of Christ; a comprehensive knowledge of the Word of God, with ability to use it in all walks of life in leading men to Christ and, with wisdom, to teach it to believers that they may grow in grace; and an enduement with power by the infilling of the Holy Spirit, expressing itself in Christian love for all men and a desire for their salvation. Vocat'ional Obfectives: The College seeks to provide thorough preparatory training in those areas of its curriculum in which students may desire to pur­ sue graduate work leading to a profession. It seeks also to provide adequate terminal training in those areas of its curriculum which are designed to prepare students for their life work.
