My great grandparents were Heinrich (Thersa Boltz). They were married in Lebanon, Wi. in 1890. They settled in that area after immigrating from Germany. But some of the family stayed living there and some moved up to Taylor County. Also, there was another family in the same church in December 5,1885 when Johanna was married to Albert Schulz. The 2 witnesses were Herman Raasch and Franz Dobbratz. They were Carl Raasch- Friederike Seidel. Their kids were Caroline, August, Albertine, Herman, Heinrich. I feel that this Carl Raasch and my Agust Carl may have been brothers, but have not made the connection yet.

I have run into a big wall with my Great Grandfather. He is George Riddell and his name appears in the 1855 Wisconsin State Census as a resident of Palmyra in Jefferson County. By extrapolation, I think he was born in the year 1822, probably in New York.I have been to the local Family History Center and in spite of their wealth of resources, have been unable to find any information about George Riddell. I would greatly appreciate any help at this point and I would gladly pay whatever fees are required to do a search of Jefferson County records. George moved from Palmyra to Chippewa Falls sometime after 1855 because in the 1880 census, he is listed as a resident of Chippewa Falls. According to the Genealogical Society in Chippewa Falls, George Riddell was a physician. He was married to a \"Sybil\" and as of 1880, had four children as follows: Lilly, age 20, Mabel, age 13, George (Jr.) age 9 and John (my Grandfather), age 6.\n\nI am trying to find out who his parents are and where they came from, when, etc. Any light you can help me shed on this would be tremendously appreciated!\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn P.

November 5, 1871, he was married at Fussville, Waukesha County, to Miss Eva Michaels (as spelled in book), a native of Washington County, Wisconsin; born September 9, 1847. They removed to Jefferson, Jefferson County, Wisconsin; engaged in farming for a year, then settled in the village of Jefferson, and kept a confectionary store for about a year, after which he traveled for a year or two, selling medicines; he then resumed the study of dentistry with Dr. Townsend, at Jefferson, and remained with him two and one-half years, then pursued his studies and practice with Dr. Crandall, at Fort Atkinson, for six months; returning then to Jefferson he disposed of his effects and came to Oconomowoc, where he has since practiced his profession since August 1870. Their children are as follows: George, born Sept 19, 1863, died Sept 19, 1863; George Jr. born November 18, 1864, died February 20, 1870; Matthias, born November 8, 1867, died March 13, 1870; Lizzie, born October 9, 1869; Joseph, born November 10, 1871; Henry, born October 20, 1873; Anna C., born February 5,1875, died March 5, 1878; Christiana G., born June 13, 1876, died September 3, 1877; Michael J., born August 22, 1878, died September 8, 1878; Maggie M., born February 1, 1880.
