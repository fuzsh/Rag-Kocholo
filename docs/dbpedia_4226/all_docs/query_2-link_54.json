On November 10, 1997, this history of scientific progress at Penn opens a new chapter with The Roy & Diana Vagelos Laboratories of the Institute for Advanced Science and Technology.\n\nThe Vagelos Laboratories provide Penn with 102,000 square feet of new,\n\ncritically needed space for cutting-edge research in bioengineering, chemistry, chemical engineering, and medicine. The facility will house two interdisciplinary research centers: The Institute for Medicine and Engineering on the lower level and the first floor, and The Center for Excellence in Chemistry and Chemical Engineering on the second through fifth floors. The infrastructure of the Vagelos Laboratories has been designed to adapt to fast-changing technologies: It features modular lab units within large open spaces and the capacity to easily reconfigure services, systems, and equipment as knowledge and technology advance.\n\nThe Institute for Advanced Science and Technology (IAST) embodies Penn's\n\nambitious strategy to maintain unparalleled leadership in scientific and technological research in the next century. The IAST is an invaluable resource for the nation and the world, speeding the pace of scientific and technological discovery and the conversion of new knowledge to practical use.\n\nPostdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students will have expanded interdisciplinary research opportunities in these new laboratories. They will work with state-of-the-art equipment using the most modern methods and techniques.They will also have greater access to the senior researchers who manage the major research projects in the IAST. As a training ground for young scientists, health researchers, and engineers, the IAST begin--through The Roy & Diana Vagelos Laboratories--to launch tomorrow's research today.\n\n--from the souvenir invitation to the University community\n\nMonday, November 10\n\n34th Street and Smith Walk\n\n8:30 a.m.-5 p.m.\n\nSymposia in Honor of the Dedication\n\n5-6:30 p.m.\n\nReception and Open House\n\nRemarks, 5:30 p.m.\n\nMorning Symposium\n\nBasic Science Contributions to World Health: A Case Study at Merck\n\n8:30 a.m.-12:45 p.m.\n\nChemistry Lecture Hall, Room 102, Chemistry Building\n\nModerated by Ralph F.
