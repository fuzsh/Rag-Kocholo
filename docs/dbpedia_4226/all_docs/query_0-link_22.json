        "text": "Joaquin Phoenix was born Joaquin Rafael Bottom in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Arlyn (Dunetz) and John Bottom, and is the middle child in a brood of five. His parents, from the continental United States, were then serving as Children of God missionaries. His mother is from a Jewish family from New York, while his father, from California, is of mostly British Isles descent. As a youngster, Joaquin took his cues from older siblings River Phoenix and Rain Phoenix, changing his name to Leaf to match their earthier monikers. When the children were encouraged to develop their creative instincts, he followed their lead into acting. Younger sisters Liberty Phoenix and Summer Phoenix rounded out the talented troupe.\n\nThe family moved often, traveling through Central and South America (and adopting the surname \"Phoenix\" to celebrate their new beginnings) but, by the time Joaquin was age 6, they had more or less settled in the Los Angeles area. Arlyn found work as a secretary at NBC, and John turned his talents to landscaping. They eventually found an agent who was willing to represent all five children, and the younger generation dove into television work. Commercials for meat, milk, and junk food were off-limits (the kids were all raised as strict vegans), but they managed to find plenty of work pushing other products. Joaquin's first real acting gig was a guest appearance on River's sitcom, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1982).\n\nHe worked with his brother again on the afterschool special Backwards: The Riddle of Dyslexia (1984), then struck out on his own in other made-for-TV productions. He made his big-screen debut as the youngest crew member in the interstellar romp Space Camp (1986), then won his first starring turn in the Cold War-era drama Russkies (1987). In the late '80s, the Phoenix clan decided to pull up stakes and relocate again--this time to Florida. River's film career had enough momentum to sustain the move, but Joaquin wasn't sure what lay in store for him in the Sunshine State. As it happened, Universal Pictures had just opened a new studio in the area and he was cast almost immediately as an angst-ridden adolescent in Eine Wahnsinnsfamilie (1989). His performance was very well-received, but Joaquin decided to withdraw from acting for a while--he was frustrated with the dearth of interesting roles for actors his age, and he wanted to see more of the world.\n\nHis parents were in the process of separating, so he struck out for Mexico with his father. Joaquin returned to the public eye three years later under tragic circumstances. On October 31, 1993, he was at The Viper Room (a Los Angeles nightclub partly-owned by Johnny Depp) when his brother River collapsed from a drug overdose and later died. Joaquin made the call to 911, which was rebroadcast on radio and television the world over. Months later, at the insistence of friends and colleagues, Joaquin began reading through scripts again, but he was reluctant to re-enter the acting life until he found just the right part. He finally signed up to work with Gus Van Sant (who had directed River in My Private Idaho (1991) and Cowgirl Blues (1993)) to star as Nicole Kidman's obsessive devotee in To Die For (1995). The performance made Joaquin (who had dropped Leaf and reverted to his birth name) a critics' darling in his own right.\n\nHis follow-up turn in Die Abbotts - Wenn Haß die Liebe tötet (1997) scored more critical kudos and, perhaps more importantly, introduced him to his one-time fiancée Liv Tyler. (The pair dated for almost three years.) He returned to the big screen later that year with a supporting role in Oliver Stone's U-Turn - Kein Weg zurück (1997), then played a locked-up drug scapegoat in Für das Leben eines Freundes (1998). He and \"Paradise\" co-star Vince Vaughn re-teamed almost immediately for the small-town murder caper Lebende Ziele (1998), which Joaquin followed with a turn as a porn store clerk in 8mm: Acht Millimeter (1999). The film that confirmed Phoenix as a star was the historical epic Gladiator (2000). The Roman epic cast him as the selfish, paranoid young emperor Commodus opposite Russell Crowe's swarthy hero. Determined to make his character as real as possible, Phoenix gained weight and cultivated a pasty complexion during the shoot. He received international attention and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for that role.\n\nLater that year, he appeared in two indies, playing a dock worker in The Yards - Im Hinterhof der Macht (2000) (which he counts among his favorite experiences--and one of the only films of his that he can sit through) and the priest in charge of the Marquis de Sade's asylum in Quills - Macht der Besessenheit (2000). He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor as the legendary musician Johnny Cash in the biography Walk the Line (2005). He also recorded an album, the film's soundtrack, for which he received the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media.\n\nAxel Kuschevatzky is a veteran movie producer with more than 80 feature credits.\n\nIn November 2019 he teamed with producers Phin Glynn and Cindy Teperman to launch L.A, London and Buenos Aires-based company Infinity Hill to develop and produce both feature films and TV series. Among their first projects are \"The Doorman,\" starring Ruby Rose and Jean Reno, directed by Ryûhei Kitamura; the Berlin Film Festival contender \"The Intruder\" and the hit TV series \"Staged\", for BBC One starring David Tennant and Michael Sheen.\n\nKuschevatzky has an extensive background in film journalism, TV production and scriptwriting. He was associate producer of Juan José Campanella's acclaimed feature \"The Secret in Their Eyes\" (El Secreto de sus ojos, 2009), Oscar-winner picture in the of Best Foreign language category in 2010. \"The Secret in Their Eyes\" sold more than 2.500.000 tickets in Argentina (breaking a 35 year old record) and 1.000.000 admissions in Spain. It also won two Goya awards; Best Latin-American Picture and Best Newcomer actress (Soledad Villamil), with seven other nominations including Best Picture and Best Director. Among other previous awards were nine Clarín(including Best Picture), thirteen Sur awards from the Argentinean's Academy of Motion Pictures, five awards at La Habana Film Festival (including the Audience Award), and a nomination an Ariel as Best Spanish-Speaking feature from Academia Mexicana de Artes y Ciencias Cinematográficas. The film was released in the US by Sony Pictures and it was sold to more than 15 countries including UK, Germany, Taiwan, Brazil, Mexico, France and Italy.\n\nHe was also associate producer of \"The Widows of Thursdays\" (Las Viudas de Los Jueves, 2009), Marcelo Piñeyro's thriller based on the best seller written by Claudia Piñeiro and starring Pablo Echarri, Leonardo Sbaraglia and Ernesto Alterio; and also produced the animated movie \"Plumíferos - Aventuras Voladores\" (2010), the first feature made with open source software featuring the voices of Luisana Lopilato and Mariano Martínez.\n\nIn March 2009 he became head of film production at Telefé, Argentina's biggest TV network.\n\nSince 2004 Axel has been the co-host of CNN/TNT's Latin-American Oscar preshow along Ana Maria Montero. CNN/TNT's Latin-American Oscar preshow is seen by more than 120 million people in the region, from Puerto Rico to Tierra del Fuego.\n\nAxel Kuschevatzky was born in the Almagro neighborhood in Buenos Aires in October 1972. His mother is a child psychologist and his father a pediatrician and piano player.\n\nHe studied copywriting and did appear as a teenager on TV answering about Horror Movies in a Quiz Show.\n\nAfter that he was the host of a weekly movie series, Cine Bizarro in the local cable network CV 5, and was part of the prestigious interview show \"Los Hacedores\", focused on performing and visual arts.\n\nAxel defines himself as a movie reporter and not as a film critic, more of a movie buff.\n\nHe also hosted movie shows in Argentina like \"Alucine\" (América TV), \"Cinescape\" (CVN), \"Apasionados: El especial\" (2002), \"Telefé Cortos\", and presented weekly series \"Terrormania\" (Telefé), and \"Nosotros También Nos Equivocamos\" (Telefé), two Oscar specials for Canal 9, and movie features in \"América Noticias\", \"Telefé Noticias\", \"Zoo\" (América TV), and \"Maru a la Tarde\" (Telefé), besides doing interviews and TV specials.\n\nHe also interviewed filmmakers like Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Clint Eastwood, James Cameron, George Lucas, Sam Raimi, M.

He started his professional life as a low-level worker at the local municipal utility. His hobby was motorcycles. He learned to repair them self-taught. Later he bought defective machines, which he repaired and sold again. With these skills and initial savings, Ecclestone became a partner with Fred Compton, who ran a motorcycle business. After Fred Compton left in the early 1950s, Ecclestone turned the business into one of the largest service and parts suppliers for foreign brands in England in just a few years. During this time, Ecclestone also started as a driver in the young Formula 1 series with Brands-Hatch. However, success did not materialize and he had to withdraw from active racing after a serious accident. In 1957, Juan Manuel Fangio became Formula 1 world champion with Maserati for the fifth time and fourth time in a row, making the sporting event very popular. Ecclestone also continued to develop his passion for motorsport: In the same year he took on his first manager position for Stuart Lewis-Evans.\n\nAfter Stuart Lewis-Evans had an accident at the 1958 Moroccan Grand Prix, he died a few days later as a result of severe burns. From 1965, Ecclestone became manager of the Austrian racing driver Jochen Rindt, who moved to Formula 1 for Cooper. Through Ecclestone's management, Rindt came to Brabham in 1968 and to the top team Lotus in 1969, with whom he had a fatal accident at the 1970 Monza Grand Prix. Jack Brabham, however, retired from active racing in 1967 as a three-time world champion, but initially remained boss of the team of the same name. When Brabham resigned from this position in 1972, Ecclestone bought the team. The year before, 1971, he became the founder of the Formula One Constructors Association \"FOCA\" (association of all Formula 1 teams). This constructors' association had the goal of asserting its interests against the Formula 1 superordinate \"FIA\" in order to achieve a stronger negotiating position. Ecclestone himself chaired the association. However, there were no successes as a team manager. He had a daughter with his first wife Ivy.\n\nIn 1977 he acquired the advertising rights on the Grand Prix circuits and in 1978 the television rights on the Grand Prix circuits. Despite numerous interesting marketing ideas, the public had too little interest in international motorsport, which meant that no contracts were concluded. In addition, the entire series suffered from a sharp decline in visitor numbers. Ecclestone responded to the crisis with the concept of breathing a form of exclusivity into the sport. He achieved this by not only inviting prominent people to races. Rather, he founded the \"Paddock Club\" in 1978, which allowed wealthy guests to show off in an elite circle in the middle of the race track. The concept worked and Ecclestone made a fortune by acting as an intermediary between Formula 1 and marketing. The income was now distributed to the teams using a sophisticated key. With his new management concept, Ecclestone achieved his breakthrough as the manager of Formula 1 in the early 1980s. In addition, his Brabham team, which was equipped with BMW engines, won the 1983 World Championship with Nelson Piquet as the driver.\n\nIn 1985, Ecclestone married Croatian model Slavica, (née Radi?) in London. This relationship resulted in their daughters Tamara (1984) and Petra (1988). When his Brabham racing team failed to achieve further success in the following years, he sold the team to FIAT in 1988. In 1991, his childhood friend and best man, Max Mosley, became President of the FIA. With the marketing company SLEC Holding Ltd. In 1997, Ecclestone became the sole marketer of all Formula 1 rights. In 2000 he sold 75% of the rights to the company EM-TV, Munich. Meanwhile, he campaigned energetically to ensure that Formula 1 continues to be shown on free TV. In 2001, he acquired the \"Paul Ricard High Tech Test Track\" near the wine-growing town of Bandol in the Var department in the south of France, just a few kilometers from the French company Excelis S.A., which is part of Ecclestone's APM 1 family trust French Riviera. The complex is also known as Le Castellet because it is located in the municipality of the same name. The Toyota Formula 1 team used the circuit as a home test track from 2002. The area has its own airport and the five-star hotel and spa \"Hôtel du Castellet\".\n\nIn September 2007 he took over the English second division club \"Queens Park Rangers\" with Flavio Briatore for 1.5 million euros. Liabilities amounting to 19.5 million euros were paid off. His marriage to Slavica ended in divorce on March 11, 2009. In August 2012, Ecclestone announced that he had married Fabiana Flosi. The entrepreneur became one of the richest people in the country. In 2014, his fortune was estimated at £2.2 billion on the Sundy Times' Richest Brits List (13th place). In August 2014, Ecclestone had to appear in court in Germany. In June 2013, the public prosecutor's office at the Munich Regional Court accused him of bribing Gerhard Gribkowsky, former board member of BayernLB, with $44 million in order to achieve a favorable sale of BayernLB's shares in Formula 1. The proceedings were discontinued on August 5, 2014 against payment of a fine of 100 million US dollars (approx. 75 million euros)."
