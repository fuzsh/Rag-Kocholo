        "text": "The Peanut Butter Falcon (On Netflix in the UK)\n\nGuy with Downs Syndrome escapes from his carehome to pursue his dream of becoming a professional wrestler. Teams up with an out of work and on the run fisherman and they travel to Florida to get to a wrestling school.\n\nI know it sounds ridiculous but I genuinely loved it - heartwarming stuff and I'd recommend it to anyone. Oh, and Bruce Dern in a small part and he's always awesome.\n\nTo view this content we will need your consent to set third party cookies.\n\nFor more detailed information, see our cookies page.\n\nThe Last Days on Mars 7.1/10\n\nSci-Fi/Thriller\n\nAbout a group (first manned crew) who finds a crazy discovery on Mars, right as they are set to return to Earth.\n\nI spent all of October watching horror/suspense/thriller movies. Continuing that into November.\n\nI liked this one. Nothing amazing, not gonna knock your socks off. But an enjoyable thriller if you're into Mars and/or horror movies.\n\nHow many times have you guys watched Wild Geese?\n\nTo view this content we will need your consent to set third party cookies.\n\nFor more detailed information, see our cookies page.\n\nAll too often. All too often. Loved the movie as a kid. Rewatched it recently, only to find myself counting cringeworthy moments (like Roger Moore's character popping tangoes with a silenced pistol from the hip, smoking a cigar and not even looking to aim.)\n\nModern Hollywood is a mess, but I don't mind the surge in realism since the 1990s (however slight it actually is).\n\nRegarding modern-day Hollywood, isn't it funny how inclusive that movie was, like fourty years ago? Heck, the gay medic was a bigger badass and more likable than all those woke heroes they try to shove down our throats today!\n\nHave not seen it yet, but this is the Slovak submission to the Oscars for foreign film: the Auschwitz report, based on a true story narrated in the book \"What Dante did not see\". Two Slovak Jews escape from Auschwitz and report the atrocities to the allies.\n\nIt´s not going to be for children given the trailer:\n\nTo view this content we will need your consent to set third party cookies.\n\nFor more detailed information, see our cookies page.\n\n'Silent'\n\nwith Joachim Król, Christian Berkel, Nadja Uhl et.al.\n\nWith his mentor dying from cancer, the mind of hitman Viktor (Król) begins to unravel. While waiting for a chance to kill a witness (Uhl) he'd let live during his last hit, he watches her try to commit suicide and instinctively rescues her, revealing to him a painful truth about himself. But their plan to begin a new life together is put at risk when Viktor is given one last assignment that attracts the attention of eccentric profiler Lang (Berkel).\n\nGerman movies are often terribly conventional cliché-fests. 'Silent', however, is not only a nuanced thriller – it's also a perfect take on the hitman-genre, second only to 'Collateral' in my opinion. The visuals, the plot, the dialogues are terrific. I was especially impressed with how the screenplay manages to avoid so many genre-typical conflicts, e.g. why a supposedly good human being turns professional murderer.\n\nThe romance is subtle and doesn't distract from the story, which is also a nice change. But my personal highlight in 'Silent' is Berkel's Lang (known to an international audience from 'Valkyrie' and 'Downfall'), playing the brilliant but weird profiler without ever becoming a caricature of his role like so many of his fictional colleagues. Distributed by Warner Brothers, 'Silent' is also available in English if you're interested.\n\n★★★★★★★☆☆☆ 7/10\n\nDon't know what to make of Tenet.\n\nIt fits well in Nolan's affinity with stories dealing with \"time\" (as a malleable and non-linear occurrence) and his idea behind Tenet is an interesting experiment. On paper that is.\n\nIn movies like Inception, Interstellar or Dunkirk, the way \"time\" was used clever and relatively easy to grasp in the confine of the movie.\n\nInception: different levels of \"reality\" > \"time\" does not behave the same way from one level to another > behavior remains gradual though > the deeper you go the faster things go.\n\nInterstellar: time, physics and astronomy, with black-holes and such.\n\nDunkirk: three different timelines happening \"at the same time\".\n\nTenet takes the concept \"slightly\" farther but does not explain it well enough. Or takes it too far for the amount of explanation provided.\n\nAnyway, some interesting things happen on screen."
