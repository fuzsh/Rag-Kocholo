        "text": "I’m Dr. Sandra Cohen. Below you will find a detailed list of my appearances, syndications, and publications over the last few years. If you are looking for a guest article or speaker, my clinical expertise is the effects of childhood trauma as they persist into adulthood. An example of a possible topic is: “I was traumatized as a child. I healed. Why do I still have symptoms, especially since COVID-19?”\n\nIf you need an expert opinion or your organization would like me to speak about this and any other topic I’ve written about below or in my Moving Forward Blog posts, please call at 310-273-4827 or email me at sandracohenphd@gmail.com. I’m happy to discuss your interests and requests.\n\n2020: Rage: The Trauma of Having No Voice: Written for and read as a part of Library Girl’s series, “The Band song, Tears of Rage,” posted on Library Girl’s Facebook Page, November, 12, 2020.\n\n“Rage is necessary. Grief is not enough. Rage heals. Rage frees creativity from its prison of silence. Having no voice against abusers or repressors, no voice for anger, sadness, or for all of the things that have hurt – is soul crushing. Of course, that brings rage. Rage that’s often hidden inside. Hidden in symptoms. Misdirected. Misunderstood.\n\nWe need rage to find our voices.” LISTEN TO READING\n\n2019: Phantom Thread: What Is Reynolds & Alma’s Perverse Feeding Game Really All About? Discussion of Paul Thomas Anderson’s 2018 film, at The Psychoanalytic Center of California’s Third Annual Saturday Cinema, May 18, 2019.\n\n“Still shaking your head over 2018’s Phantom Thread? Paul Thomas Anderson has done it again. He’s a master at exploring the various kinds of perverse power games involved in problems with dependency and love. Anderson’s new film, Phantom Thread, is another brilliant character study to add to Boogie Nights, Magnolia, The Master, and Inherent Vice (to name a notable few). In Phantom Thread, burning at the heart of the sick game Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day Lewis) and his Alma (Vicky Krieps) play, we wonder once again: who’s the one in power? And what is the need for it? Plus, we also can’t escape asking: what exactly is the phantom thread woven into all Reynolds’s garments, but most particularly, into the dangerous game Reynolds and Alma play? If you’d like to know what was going on between Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day Lewis) and his wife Alma (Vicky Krieps), Dr, Sandra Cohen has some answers for you.” READ MORE\n\n2018: Lady Bird: Critical Mothers & Provocative Daughters How History Plays Its Part in Problems Loving & Letting Go. Discussion of Greta Gerwig’s film at The Psychoanalytic Center of California’s Second Annual Saturday Cinema, March 3, 2018.\n\n“Lady Bird begins with a Joan Didion quote splashed across the screen: Anyone who talks about California hedonism has never spent Christmas in Sacramento. Christmas is mostly for children or, at least, the child part of us. And, few come through childhood unscathed. Greta Gerwig’s charming, brilliantly written, funny, and often psychologically painful film has a lot to say about mothers and daughters. Being a mother certainly has its challenges. Being a daughter means separating to have your own life. That has its difficulties too, especially when your mom has a hard time letting go. For Christine “Lady Bird” McPherson (Saoirise Ronan) and her tirelessly opinionated, strong-willed, but (somewhere buried inside) loving mom Marion (Laurie Metcalf), separation is no easy task. To understand the all too upsetting struggles between them, we must turn to certain clues in Marion’s historical and psychological realties. What else can a psychoanalyst do?” READ MORE\n\n2017: Elle: What Does Triumph Have to Do with It? Discussion of Paul Verhoeven’s film at The Psychoanalytic Center of California’s First Saturday Cinema, April 18, 2017.\n\n“Trauma. We know it. We experience it. We’re left with its aftermath – when Director Paul Verhoeven’s “noir thriller,” Elle, careens to its conclusion. Leaving the theater, my mind was spinning. As Verhoeven says, the film has: “an enormous amount of ambiguity, gaps that are in the narrative on purpose for the audience to fill in.” He didn’t want to fill them in: “in a Freudian way.” As far as I’m concerned, the film is much too disturbing to be left without an understanding of exactly what transpired on the screen. That’s what I’m here to do. Elle begins with a brutal rape. Why is Michele so apparently unfazed by the attack (systematically getting rid of reminders, even throwing out her dress), soldiering on as Robert (Christian Berkel), her best friend Anna’s (Anne Consigny) husband and sometimes lover, puts it? The rape scene is repeated several times in the film. Each subsequent time, we witness a woman fighting, not as cold and detached as our first introduction. Yet, as soon as each rape is over, Michele quickly returns to a cold, unfeeling state of being. Dissociation is symptomatic of trauma and all that must be pushed away to survive it. Rape isn’t the only trauma in Michele Leblanc’s life.” READ MORE\n\n2016: Exploring How Words Weave Skin Around the Otherwise Unspeakable, The Unknown. Paper presented with Holaday Mason, M.A. at the IFPE “Skin” Conference, Pasadena, CA, October 28, 2016.\n\n“Holaday Mason’s long fable poem, The Red Bowl, speaks deeply to trauma and unresolved sorrow. I will show how her book bears witness to what I’ve seen in my work with traumatized patients as well as the need to create a skin to hold difficult feelings as they surface. This internal skin is created by the mother’s early empathic attentions, or later in therapy and love, as well as in the kind of writing Holaday does. Trauma tears away skin. If the trauma is early, the kind of internal skin needed does not have a chance to develop. Holaday’s complete fable is to be read or listened to again and again. I have. We will give you a taste, as I focus on one of many things The Red Bowl evoked for me, the aftermath of trauma. It breaks a heart.”\n\nThe Dangers Of Revenge Obsession In ‘Promising Young Woman.’ Written for charactersonthecouch.com and re-published on YourTango.com, June 5, 2021.\n\nWhere does revenge obsession take you? In Emerald Fennell’s brilliantly disturbing and evocative Promising Young Woman, Cassie (played by Carey Mulligan) lost Nina, her very best friend — and only true soulmate — to suicide. Why? A violent and repeated rape seriously traumatized Nina and she couldn’t go on. And no one listened. No one saw the rape as rape and no one blamed the rapist. It makes sense, doesn’t it? That Cassie can think of nothing else but getting revenge for Nina’s rape and death. The film shows the audience just where trauma-driven obsession can take you — and it’s neither pretty nor healing.

No one becomes a heroin addict unless there’s something too painful inside him to stop for even a moment to hear or feel. So, Ruben runs — with drugs, frantic hard metal drumming, and his desperate love for his singer-girlfriend, Lou (played by Olivia Cooke). Darius Marder’s Sound of Metal, with Riz Ahmed in the lead role of Ruben, takes us on a journey like no other. It’s the journey of a man who’s faced with finding the silence inside, a silence that might take him to his real self — if he can let it happen. READ MORE\n\nDementia & The Fight To Hold Onto Who He Was In The Film ‘The Father.’ Written for charactersonthecouch.com and re-published on YourTango.com, May 11, 2021.\n\nThe brilliance — and terror — of Florian Zeller’s The Father is that we’re living inside the mind of an aging man losing his identity to dementia. To watch it from the outside is bad enough. I know. I was that daughter, too. But to be the one losing his grip on who he was is truly heartbreaking. Reality’s blurred, time’s not static, past and present are mixed up with each other, and people are not who they seem; confused with memory, fantasy, and warring parts of The Father, himself.

Written for charactersonthecouch.com and re-published on YourTango.com, May 2, 2021.\n\nThe horror of Bobby Seale’s gagging by Judge Julius Hoffman in Aaron Sorkin’s timely and Oscar-nominated film, The Trial of the Chicago 7, is an image of what Black Lives Matter is fighting against. It’s an image of how being silenced provokes rage. The history and trial speak for themselves. As a psychoanalyst, I can talk about how personal historical forces in your mind sometimes create violent opposition to speaking out, thinking for yourself, and being who you are. You — anyone, really — can feel like you’re “on trial” for your thoughts if you go against what you’ve been taught that you “should” — or “should not” — think and believe. So, how do you ensure that you can speak out?

You’ve lost the home you know, with a person that you love. There’s sadness, anger, memories — as you grapple with the challenges of an uprooted life. Chloé Zhao’s Oscar-winning film for Best Picture, Nomadland, takes us there, with Frances McDormand’s Fern leading the way through the open expanses of loss. Loss is a journey, not unlike the one Fern takes in her trusty van, Vanguard. And, in the film’s hopeful story of Fern and other nomads she meets, what do we learn about grief?

Written for charactersonthecouch.com and re-published on YourTango.com, April 27, 2021.\n\nHerman Mankiewicz was a tragic figure — in 1940s Hollywood and in David Fincher’s Oscar-winning film for Best Cinematography and Production Design, Mank. Sure, Mank stood up for what was right and against what was wrong at MGM and in the political world of the times. He had his principles, expressed too often in self-destructive ways. He was equally hurtful towards those who loved him. In fact, he turned away from love as he drank himself to death. Why couldn’t Mank get out of his “self-created trap?” Why does such a talented man not love himself?

Lonesome Rhodes (played by Andy Griffith), a brash, charming drunken drifter, is turned into a radio personality by Marcia Jeffries (played by Patricia Neal) in Elia Kazan’s 1957 classic, A Face in The Crowd. Perhaps the real question lies in why a woman like Marcia falls for such a man. Yes, “sexy sells” to some women. But, aside from the sex appeal of narcissistic bad boys, why does Marcia fall so hard? What draws her in? And what fateful mistakes does she make in loving the wrong man? READ MORE\n\n2020: ‘My Octopus Teacher’ & Why Healing Means Returning to The Same Place. Written for charactersonthecouch.com and re-published on YourTango.com, December 30, 2020.\n\nWhy return to the same place over and over? Because it can sometimes be healing. Documentary filmmaker, editor, and cameraman Craig Foster says it best in his moving, life-altering, love-story, My Octopus Teacher. “That’s when you see the subtle differences. That’s when you get to know the wild.” Going through a wildly tumultuous emotional time is not so different from the Cape of Storms. The more you go deep inside, over and over, to look at the tangled underwater terrain of your feelings, the more you see the nuances that can set you free. READ MORE\n\n2020: 5 Suggestions for Coping with Prolonged Pandemic Grief. Written for Moving Forward Blog on sandracohenphd.com and re-published on YourTango.com on December 28, 2020.\n\nDoes your sadness not stop? Do you feel trapped in a cycle of despair? You’re not alone. Almost one year of a global pandemic is enough to put anyone in a state of prolonged grief. But there are things you can do to cope. It might be hard to believe that. With all the losses: Life as you knew it, grieving a job or loved one who passed, the sadness and grief can feel like too much to bear. How do you go on? What can you do?

My great uncle, Leo Hurwitz’s film, Strange Victory, tried to do the same in 1948, after we collectively won the war against Hitler but came home to racism here in the US. It’s now 72 years later and there’s still too much to be scared of when it comes to racial tension in this country. Peele says he made Get Out to face his fears of “… Human beings. What people can do in conjunction with other people is exponentially worse than what they can do alone. Society is the scariest monster.” READ MORE\n\n2020: How to Date in A Pandemic: Why Slow & Steady Is The ‘New Normal,’ Written for Moving Forward Blog on sandracohenphd.com and re-published on YourTango.com, October 29, 2020.\n\n“These times are unprecedented, and you’re likely wondering how to date in a pandemic when the end isn’t in sight. You might be asking yourself: “What can I do about it? How do I date safely?” You don’t want to be alone. Maybe you haven’t been in a relationship since COVID-19 forced you into isolation. Or perhaps you broke up with someone during this stressful time. Either way, you want to date! But how?” READ MORE\n\n2020: If You Were A Victim of Child Sexual Abuse, You Need to Read This, Written for Moving Forward Blog on sandracohenphd.com and re-published on YourTango.com, October 28, 2020.\n\n“The list of negative effects of child sexual abuse is long. But if you want to learn how to love yourself and build self-esteem after trauma, you certainly can. Sexual abuse is one of the most traumatic things that can happen to a child. If it happened to you, you live with one of its worst after-effects: low self-esteem. Feeling bad about yourself is a terrible thing to live with. When you’ve been sexually abused, this feeling might be with you constantly along with the trauma and low sense of self-worth. There are endless ways to feel worthless. A voice in your head keeps finding fault with you. Self-doubt, even self-hate, is the albatross you wear around your heart.” READ MORE\n\n2020: 4 Ways Narcissistic Relationships Hurt Your Self-Esteem, Written for Moving Forward Blog on sandracohenphd.com and re-published on YourTango.com, October 5, 2020.\n\n“Narcissists draw you in with their charm and compliments. You needed love. But your partner didn’t give it. Now, you’re suffering, whether you’re in or you’re out. And, you’re reeling from the confusion and hurt of being engaged in a narcissistic relationship. They seemed so into you, all those promises and adoration. Then things changed, maybe subtly at first. They got more distant and critical. What happened? They’re a narcissist who used you for your love.” READ MORE\n\n2020: How to Find Your Voice When You’re Scared to Speak for Yourself. Written for Moving Forward Blog on sandracohenphd.com and re-published on YourTango.com, September 20, 2020.\n\n“Are you scared to speak for yourself? Right now, people all over the country are speaking out and protesting. Maybe you wish you could be like them, but you can’t say what’s on your mind. Ever. How do you stop being scared and start speaking for yourself? The question is: What or who has silenced you? This isn’t an uncommon problem. But it’s a very painful one when it’s yours, and it can come up in many different situations. You have things to say in a meeting or in class, but you hold back. Someone else says it first. You try to say how you feel, but you’re told, “You’re too sensitive,” or some other criticism. You have an opinion, but you can’t voice it because you’re afraid it’s wrong … Everyone has the right to a voice. Everyone needs to be heard. So, where do you start? Here are 4 steps to find your voice and speak for yourself.” READ MORE\n\n2020: 6 Ways Childhood Abandonment Issues Affects You into Adulthood. Written for Moving Forward Blog on sandracohenphd.com and re-published on YourTango.com, September 16, 2020.\n\nDid you suffer abandonment as a child? Were you neglected? Perhaps you were a child of divorce, in foster care, or left to figure things out on your own. If so, you may still be suffering the effects of abandonment issues. It’s never too late for help or healing. But that often takes a kind of trust that’s hard to come by if your childhood was hard. And it also means being able to grieve. Yet, sadness can seem immense, like you might drown in it. It’s hard to grieve alone.” READ MORE\n\n2020: How to Heal A Broken Heart When Breaking Up Feels Like the End of The World.

Sometimes, the heartbreak is so painful that breaking up feels like the end of the world. You might feel like your life is over. You may have no idea how to go on. Yes, breaking up with someone you love often feels like the end of the world. Overwhelming loss and sadness seem insurmountable. Your plans for the future have come crashing to a halt.

Are you feeling trapped in quarantine due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic? Fortunately, you can outwit despair. Even if you see no clear way out, don’t think it’s dangerous to hope. It’s not.

That’s why you should watch The Shawshank Redemption more today than ever. Yes, I mean today, because quarantine can seem just as much a prison sentence, like the one Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and Ellis Boyd “Red” Redding (Morgan Freeman) found themselves in at Shawshank prison. Especially Andy, as innocent of any wrong-doing as we are. Even if you see no clear way out, don’t think it’s dangerous to hope. It’s not. Hope is a necessary thing.

When fears of COVID-19 layer on top of old traumas, worries, and sadness, they can prey upon you like the gang of teenage bullies in the film. They won’t leave you alone until you find a way to safely feel and face them. In a world that seems like an unending place of sorrow where it’s hard to see a way out, having a strong friendship helps. A good friend reminds you that there’s someone who stands by you, emotionally, because at this time, most of us have to say, “Don’t stand by me! At least, not closer than six feet.” And that’s lonely.” READ MORE\n\n2020: 4 Ways Childhood Loss Makes You Afraid to Love — And How to Break Free from It, Written for Moving Forward Blog on sandracohenphd.com and re-published on YourTango.com, August 17, 2020.\n\n“Are you afraid to love?

Written for Moving Forward Blog on sandracohenphd.com and re-published on YourTango.com, August 21, 2019.\n\n“You might be wondering: Why is anxiety so often a part of an eating disorder and a negative body image? What is the anxiety in eating disorders really all about? What are the underlying causes of eating disorders — and can they actually be considered anxiety disorders? Those are all good questions. And the simple answer is no, eating disorders aren’t specifically anxiety disorders. But anxiety symptoms often co-exist with problems in eating. The more complicated questions are “why” and “what’s anxiety all about?” The answers are very individual and best explored in therapy with an expert.

Self-esteem is vital to your personal self-image, so if you’re constantly dealing with criticism from other people (or a criticizing voice in your head), you’re likely suffering from some low self-esteem issues. People don’t realize how easy it is to criticize yourself for mistakes large or small, which is why you can end up with a “bully” sitting on your shoulder that’s criticizing you at all hours of the day. It can lead to signs of low self-esteem and even creative blocks. Do you hear a voice in your head criticizing everything you think? Every idea you have? Or anything you’ve already tried?

In Pedro Almodovar: A Cinema of Desire, Passion and Compulsion. Edited by Arlene Kramer Richards and Lucille Spira with Merle Molofsky. International Psychoanalytic Books, New York.\n\nThis chapter retells this 2009 film in light of unresolved infantile Oedipal complexes still living in the adult minds of Broken Embraces’s troubled, traumatized, and terrified souls. Dr. Cohen focuses on the problem for the baby of being the excluded one in an Oedipal triangle, with all the dark urges and unmanageable feelings that exclusion brings. She concentrates her discussion on Ernesto Martel, Sr., who is of central importance in Almodovar’s devastating but poignant story of jealousy, lust, obsession, love, revenge, and very likely murder. And, she shows what happens when, faced with being the “wronged party” in a love triangle, the most destructive urges are unleashed. In Martel’s violent determination to break the couple’s embraces, we witness one of the most pathological versions of the Oedipal situation. This chapter illustrates what happens in an Oedipal story gone terribly, terribly wrong.
