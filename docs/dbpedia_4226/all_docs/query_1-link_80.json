        "text": "Life and career\n\nBerkel was born in Berlin, Germany. His father had been a military doctor in World War II. His mother came from a Jewish German family.[1][2]\n\nFrom the age of 14 he lived in Paris where he took drama lessons with Jean-Louis Barrault and Pierre Berlin. He then trained at the German Film and Television Academy in Berlin and appeared on stage in Augsburg, DÃ¼sseldorf, Munich, Vienna and at the Schiller Theatre, Berlin.\n\nHe has appeared in many German television productions and secured a major role in the Academy Award-nominated film Downfall as Dr. Ernst-GÃ¼nther Schenck. He has followed this with significant roles in the Paul Verhoeven-directed Dutch movie Black Book and the big-budget American movies Flightplan, Valkyrie (in which he portrayed Colonel Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim) and Quentin Tarantino's Academy Award-nominated Inglourious Basterds. In addition to his native German, Berkel speaks fluent English and French."
