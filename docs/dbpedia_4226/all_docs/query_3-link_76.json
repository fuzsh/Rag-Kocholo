I began this web page by scanning the CD for ships carrying passengers with surnames that indicate their origin might be the village of Soufflenheim or Stundwiller, and over time I have added other passengers as well. The CD does not identify the hometown of the passengers. But it seemed to me that if a ship contains a cluster of passengers with surnames like Ball, Dentinger, Philipps, Staebell, and Strasser, these people might be from the Stundwiller area. Likewise, surnames like Daul, Bitschy, Haberkorn, Kieffer, and Messner suggest people from Soufflenheim. This surmise has turned out to be true, and I have found it to be a very effective way to identify immigrants.\n\nTo be certain that the people named in the lists below are from the Soufflenheim or Stundwiller area, their names and ages must be compared with Soufflenheim and Stundwiller birth records. I have done that for only a couple people. Researchers such as Lynda Goldman, Nancy Archdekin, and Charles Sheridan have contributed information about matches from their family histories. Our findings are on a separate web page, \"Matches and Possible Matches\".\n\nIf you can match people in these passenger lists to people in your family history, please contact me (Brian Smith) using the link at the bottom of this page. I will add your findings to this page for the benefit of others.\n\nIn the passenger lists below, I do not list here every passenger for any ship. Each ship as many as a couple hundred passengers, from many places in Europe. I have only listed passengers who I believe might be connected to my own family tree. I have sorted each list by \"family number\" if present, a code on the CD which I believe indicates the order in which the passengers appear in the original ship passenger list. I have inserted \"...\" to indicate the presence of other passengers who appear on the CD but whose names I have not transcribed. For some ships, family number was not given, in which case I sorted the names alphabetically.\n\nThe original passenger lists for these ships are probably available on microfilm through the Family History Library. (Both the index and and the images of the original lists are also available online at Ancestry.com.) I have compared the CD listings to the microfilm images for several of these ships, and many errors were made in transcribing the information onto the CD -- in fact, the poor quality of the transcription is disappointing. So if you find something on this page that interests you, I recommend that you look at the microfilm version, where you will probably find more accurate information.\n\nIf you are looking for immigrants who are not listed on this page, but who might have arrived through New York Harbor between 1820 and 1850, they might be on the CD. Unfortunately, because the CD is cumbersome and time-consuming to use, I cannot make an offer to perform lookup requests. However, if you are interesting in acquiring or getting access to this CD to search your own, please click here for more information.\n\nThe Ships\n\nShip: American, 1827\n\nShip Name: American\n\nPort of Departure: Havre\n\nPort of Arrival: New York\n\nArrival Date: 27-Aug-1827\n\nThese are some of the passengers:\n\nPFEFFIN or PLIFFIN: Jacob G 39, Gertrude 41, Dominique 14, Catherine 11, George 8, John G 5, Maria Ursulla 1; from France\n\nVELDIN: John 28; from France\n\nRUSCH or RUCH: Sebastian 46, Catherine 38, Joseph 17, Sebastian 15, Ann Marie 11, John 6, Marian 4, Casper 1; from France -- Matches...\n\nFELLMAN: John 29; from France\n\nSCHINDLER: Peter 42, Maria A 52, John 16, Joseph 15, Catherine 16, Peter 13; from France\n\nCONTISS: Francis 23; from France\n\nRAYOT or REYOT: Frederick 29; from France\n\nGENTIL: Susanah 31; from France\n\n...\n\nMONIN: Nicholas 42, Catherine 42, Charles 18, Francis 17, John Peter 6; from France -- Matches...\n\nBEDRAND or BEDEAND: Silvester 45, Maria 45, Simon 20, Jacob 18, Francis 16, Justiania 2; from France\n\nCOUFERL or COUPEL: Sewis(?) or Srois(?)
