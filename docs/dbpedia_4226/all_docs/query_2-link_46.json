        "text": "\"The UNStudio Burnham Pavilion relates to diverse city contexts, program and scales. It invites people to gather, walk around and through and to explore and observe. The pavilion is sculptural, highly accessible and functions as an urban activator.\"\n\n-Ben van Berkel\n\nJust as movie camera attempts to frame and capture one story out of a choice of many, so the Burnham Pavilion by UNStudio seeks to surprise us with various views of the Chicago skyline. The openings in the Pavilion roof function as frames that direct our attention outward, toward the texture and cinematic character of the city.\n\nUNStudio principal architect Ben van Berkel says the design of the pavilion was influenced by a trip to Chicago as a teenager, where he observed the cantilevered ceiling and roof eaves of Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House. The two horizontal planes of the pavilion show this influence. The edges of the lower of the two planes - the pavilion's floor - act as benches, inviting rest and interaction.\n\nTo emphasize the geometry of the building at night, a sophisticated, interactive lighting system is built into the floor. In response to the level of visitor activity the light varies in intensity and color. Chicago artist Daniel Sauter chose the color scheme for his lighting design from the color palette used in the beautiful water colors that illustrated the original Plan, and Dear Productions created the effects.\n\nThough the structure appears light and airy, the frame of the UNStudio Burnham Pavilion receives its support and shape from a strong skeleton of steel. The steel was sponsored by ArcelorMittal, the world's leading steel producer, which has facilities in more than 60 countries and its North American headquarters in Chicago. The pavilion's steel foundation sustains intricately designed plywood ribs which are covered with plywood skin and coated with reflective paint. The steel in this pavilion will be recycled at the end of the pavilion exhibition. Steel is the most recycled material in the world, with more than 250 million tons recycled each year.
