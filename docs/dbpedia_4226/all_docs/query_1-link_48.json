        "text": "There is one building that is very special to Ben van Berkel, and that building is the Katsura Imperial Villa in Kyoto. In the late 1970s, when he was taking evening courses in interior design and graphic design at the Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam, the Dutch architect was also working in the office of a Japanese-born graphic and exhibition designer during the day. It was his employer who sparked van Berkel’s interest in Japanese culture, spurring him to visit Japan at the age of 21. In our recent conversation, the architect told me, “Visiting Katsura was an intensely emotional experience. I never thought architecture could communicate so beautifully. It was like listening to a symphony by Beethoven or reading one of Edgar Allan Poe’s poems.” Standing in front of the imperial villa, he thought, “If this is what architecture can do, I want to become an architect!”\n\nBen van Berkel was born in 1957 in Utrecht, Netherlands. His mother was a soprano singer and his father a sergeant major in a military hospital. Van Berkel was already 25 when he finally committed to studying architecture; he applied to the Architectural Association in London in 1982. Zaha Hadid was his professor in his final year and they got along very well. He even worked for her then-small practice both as a student and for a few months after his graduation in 1987. He subsequently spent one year at the office of Santiago Calatrava in Zurich, where he was particularly involved in the design of the Stadelhofen Station in Zurich, completed in 1990.\n\nThe architect founded his practice, Berkel & Bos, in Amsterdam in 1988 in partnership with his wife, Caroline Bos. A decade later they relaunched it under its current name, UNStudio, which is now a 300-member office operating out of six cities: Amsterdam, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Frankfurt, Dubai, and Melbourne. Among the firm’s most celebrated buildings are Erasmus Bridge in Rotterdam (1996), Möbius House on the outskirts of Amsterdam (1998), Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart (2001), Ardmore Residence in Singapore (2013) and Arnhem Central Transfer Hall in the Netherlands (2015).\n\nVladimir Belogolovsky: How would you sum up the influence of both Hadid and Calatrava on your practice?\n\nCould you expand on this? You took their ideas and you tried to move in your own direction, right?\n\nYou are saying that first, there is a particular organizational concept and then architecture comes out of that; architecture finds its appearance, not the other way around. It is not image-driven. In a way, it is diagrammatic thinking, right?\n\nYou compare your Möbius House to a landscape; it’s also been described as a fluid collision of different zones to suit two work-at-home parents and their two teenage children. In the brief, your clients said: “We want to see our kids but we don’t want to hear them.” How did that request manifest in your design?\n\nWhen you talk about your architecture you use such words and phrases as non-linear, continuity, a continuous line, a line turning into a surface, complexity, the idea of a twist, like a flower, data-driven, liberating, learning from the building process, disciplined geometry, visual flow, and space-time condition. How else would you describe your work and the kind of architecture that you try to achieve?\n\nSpeaking about your design process you have said, “It’s like mixing music.” How so?\n\nWhen and how did the idea of fluid geometry first occur in your work?"
