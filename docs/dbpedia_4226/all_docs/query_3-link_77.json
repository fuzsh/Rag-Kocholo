        "text": "This bulletin board allows Budde researchers to communicate with each other.\n\nVarensell, Westphalia\n\nI am desperately trying to find out what became of my grandmother’s step-brother, Arnold Budde, who emigrated from Varensell, Westphalia, Germany, to Atlanta, Georgia in 1888 (maybe 1891), accompanied by his uncle Arnold Kerstingtombroke. Can anyone help? I can provide his father’s family tree (Budde) back to the 17th century. In this context.\n\nYours sincerely Joachim Sanner, Troisdorf, Germany.\n\njoachim_sanner@web.de – Phone: 00492241403741\n\nDinklage\n\nMy husband’s grandfather was Joseph Budde, son of Gerhard Budde and Catherine Borgerding. We are planning on going to Dinklage this summer and wondered if there are any Buddes still there. If people are interested, I can post information about Joseph and his descendants.\n\nHe had 2 wives; the first died shortly after childbirth. They had 10 children. His sister had emigrated to Hamilton, OH, and that’s where Joseph first settled. Then, when the railroad was selling land in Minnesota, he bought a farm in Melrose, MN. The farm is still owned by one of his descendants. I am SO excited to see all this information, but I’m not sure how Gerhard fits into all the genealogy you have listed. And what about Catherine?\n\nJo Ann Budde jab@buddefamily.com\n\nPrussia\n\nSomehow my family relates too Prime Minister Of Prussia Hermann Von Budde born in Bensberg Castle brother of theologian Karl Budde. i have traced back as far as George Budde WWI hero died in action. Having trouble linking between America and Germany.\n\nHermann Von Budde married Helene Heyland children of them are unknown but great grand daughter is Gevinon baroness Bussche and great grandson Alexander Freiherr Von Medem or Meden.\n\nHermann was born November of 1851 and died 4-28-1906 and his wife was born 5-11-1871 and died 2-23-1916. Karl’s full name is Karl Ferdinand Reinhard Budde.\n\nBobbie Jo Budde\n\nSchlangen – Nordrhein Westfalen\n\nI am trying to find information on the Budde families from Schlangen, Germany. I have found Henrich Herman Budde b. 1728 m. Anne Marie Elisabeth Schloemer(s) 31 Jan 1766. Henrich’s father was Johan Henrich Budde m. Catharina Ilseben Ploeger of Nienhagen but have no birth/death/ancestry information for Johan or Ploeger. The FHC church films from Schlangen do not date back any further. I would appreciate any information or help you may be able to offer.\n\nThank you. –Dianne email: de30107@windstream.net\n\nBaden-Württemberg\n\nMy name is Joy Budde. I have been trying to find information on my grandfather and great grandparents in Germany.\n\nMy grandfather was Otto Budde, born 06 april 1877 in Germany to Fredrick Budde and Anna Weimner. I believe that Fredrick was born around 1848 and died 1878 in Germany. Anna was born around 1848 and died in 1890 in Germany. My grandfather, Otto Budde, came to the U.S. in 1891 as an orphan. My father also indicated that Otto said he came from Baden-Baden, Germany.\n\nCan you give me any tips on trying to locate information about my roots in Germany? I would appreciate any help.

Unfortunatelay, she was not named Budde but her last name was Heimans or Heumans.\n\nHowever, in the village of Füchtorf there was (or still is) a farm called Budde and there were many people with that name.

The one I have found is of Lt Hans Von Budde who was one of the commanding officers of Jasta 15, a German fighter squadron on the Western Front during World War One. I was hoping you might be able to tell me more about him, as it is always nice to have some idea about the stories behind the plane.\n\nThank you in advance,\n\nRob Bullion\n\nplease reply to rob_bullion@hotmail.com\n\nJohann Bernhard * 20.3.1842 in Varrelgraben (Bremen)\n\nI thought I had made a connection when I came across an entry, namely “Budde, Johann Bernhard * 20.3.1842 in Varrelgraben”.\n\nJohn Bernhard Budde was my father’s name and Johann Bernhard was his father, both hailing from Bremen. Alas, the dates were wrong: My grandfather’s (Johann Bernhard) dates were from 31 March 1850 to 11 March 1923 – born and died in Bremen with a one generation sojourn in the US. His father was Carl Heinrich August Budde, again born (Bremen) 14 Nov 1822, died (Bremen)\n\n17 Feb 1911. Next generation was a Johann Berend Budde, born in Sonneborn 19 Dec 1788, died Bremen 22 June 1861.\n\nAfter that, the dates get skinny. Does this help you?

Jones-nee-Budde. My great grandparents came from Germany. My grandfather went by the name of Harry until he wanted to retire and there was no record of a Harry- according to the Church Baptisimal records there was a Henry born to his parents that they assume was him. My great grandmothers’ name was Caroline Brinkman born in Klopinburg, Germany on Sept. 25, 1863 and she died on Feb. 3, 1905 in St. Marys, Ohio. I do not know my great grandfathers first name. It may have been Henry. My grandfather left home at a very early age. If this helps you in any way I’m glad. If you can help me in any way it would be greatly appreciated. I was also born in 1950. I was born and raised in Muskegon, Michigan. I hope to hear from you. Sincerely, Marcia Clop\n\nMarcia, I have Budde ancestors near St. Mary’s, too. Contact me at mwilson1@prodigy.net. maybe there are clues. Marilyn Wilson\n\nJohann Heinrich Budde – Herford\n\nHello Paul, I am Suzanne Budde Campbell of Tucson AZ USA. I am researching my Budde lineage, and have hit a wall with my great-grandfather, Johann Heinrich Budde. He was born October 16. 1846 in Herford, and came to the US in September 1882 with his wife, Marie(Weidkamp) and five children. They settled in Quincy, IL, where he died Dec. 13, 1930. I obtained the above information from death certificates of Johann, his wife and children , while visiting Quincy this summer. I obtained Johann’s death cetificate, but his parentage was not noted thereon. I am wondering if you have any information or links to this lineage? I am the youngest grandchild of one of his youngest children, and have no access or knowledge of any other family, such as brothers or sisters, or any written record of this man. There is a old “story” that I remember hearing of when I was young, that Johann had been ‘given’ to a Budde family to be raised…perhaps an illegitimate child? He was said to have been a member of the Prussian Guard when he was a young man Perhaps a family ‘tall tale’? Thank you for your time….any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nSuzanne Budde Campbell suzebc@webtv.net\n\nMore…\n\nMy son Ryan has lead me to your website and in reading the material I noted my paternal Aunt had written to you giving information about my great-great grandfather, Johann Heinrich Budde born Oct 16,1846 <Where? in germany?> came to the USA in Sept 1882 with wife Marie <Weidkamp> and five children. Joseph <My great grandfather was one of these five children> Johann died 12/13/30 in Quincy Ill. Where you able to find any information that would lead us back further?? I’m interested to find the birthplace of Johann.\n\nThank you,\n\nMichelle Budde-Surdell msurdell@comcast.net\n\nBuddes emigrating from Bunde Germany to USA in 1850’s\n\nI’ve just joined the Budde group a couple of weeks ago. Paul Budde sent me some information about Buddes in Westfallen. In the section “Bunde” was a mention of a Hermann Heinrich Budde born 27 May 1830 (who emigrated to America in 1854) Hermann was my mothers, fathers, mothers fathers brother. It also mentioned a Caspar Heinrich Budde which was also the name of Herman’s brother.\n\nI asked a newsgroup (alt.genealogy) if they could help with information about emigration in 1854 of Wilhelm and Caspar.\n\nOne very kind person wrote back with the following:-\n\nNew York Passenger Lists, 1851-1891\n\nName: Hermann Budde\n\nArrival Date: 19 Oct 1855 Age: 24 Port of Departure: Bremen, Germany\n\nDestination: New York\n\nPlace of Origin: Germany\n\nShip Name: Blucher\n\nPort of Arrival: New York\n\nLine: 22\n\nMicrofilm Roll: 157\n\nList Number: 1025\n\nHe also included a ships manifest. (included as attachment)\n\n(Also big error, as manifest above states 1855 when document clearly shows 1853)\n\nThe problem I have with this is that Hermann was the wrong age. At 19 Oct 1953 he should be 23 years old not 24 as stated in the manifest.\n\nSeeing that Hermann Budde was a very common name, maybe it is not the person I’m looking for.\n\nAlso sent was the following :-\n\nName: Caspar Heinrich Budde\n\nYear: 1852\n\nPlace: Illinois\n\nSource Publication Code: 8368\n\nPrimary Immigrant: Budde, Caspar Heinrich\n\nAnnotation: Entries located in the Introduction are indicated in this\n\nindex by the code I.\n\nSource Bibliography: SHELLEY, JANE, and ELSIE M.

Farmington Hills, MI: Gale Research, 2003.\n\nUnfortunately I’m sure the Herman Heinrich Budde that I’m looking did not have a sister named Hanne Wilhelmine Budde.\n\nAfter a couple of hours looking at the LDS web site I found two families with brother and sisters named Herman Heinrich Budde and Hanne Wilhelmine Budde.\n\nThere parents were:-\n\n1) Christoph Budde and Kathrine Luise Lessmann from Oerlinghausen, Lippe, Germany.\n\n2) Toens Henrich Budde and Anne Marie Luise Kopp from Oerlinghausen, Lippe, Germany.\n\nLDS , obviously, do not have complete records of all Buddes in the World.\n\nSo, most provably, I haven’t found the correct family to which Hermann and Hanne belong.\n\nUnfortunately Paul Budde didn’t have any Emigration records from the Lippe area.\n\nI don’t think the above people are the ones I’m looking.\n\nMaybe the above information can assist someone else in their family history search.\n\nPeter Dypoldt\n\nMy name is Peter Dypoldt. I am also a Budde descendant. In fact I have two Budde ancestors. My mothers (Sigrid Kuhweide) mother was Emilia Budde 15 Feb 1892 to 19 Dec 1928 (brother Wilhelm). Emilia Budde father was Dietrich Budde, mother was Wilhelmine Wisselmann. My mothers father was Otto Kuhweide 24 Feb 1884 to 29 Feb 1948. Otto’s mother was Karoline Budde 5 April 1854 to 17 may 1935 Karolines father was Friedrich Wilhelm Budde 26 Apr 1827 to 21 Dec 1906.\n\nFriedrich has siblings Herman Henrich Budde born 1830, Anna Marie Budde born 1834 and Casper Heinrich Budde born 1837. They all were christened Evangelish Buende Westfalen, Preussen. Their father was Herman Heinrich Budde married 30 July 1826 to Anne Marie Kamphoefener. Married at Evangelish Buende Westfalen, Preussen. That is the only information I have (except that my mother remembers letters from America when she was young. I.E. one, some? of the Budde family emergrated to the USA.) Does that help you in any way, Are we, closely, related. (or maybe just 50th cousins?) Good luck with your family treeing.\n\nPeter Dypoldt. peter.dypoldt@ntlworld.com\n\nHeinrich Budde West Prussia\n\nHello Paul,\n\nMy husbands family is from Westphalia, W.Prussia Allen Co.\n\nThe Head of this line is Heinrick Budde and his wife Elinor Bohn.\n\nThey had 2 Sons and 5 Girls. the first son, Frederick H. Budde came here with his wife Christine Weise. This was in 1885. It is not known for sure just when Heinrick came or the daughters but the second son came at age 16 in 1886 aboard the “Fulda” Frederick and Christine arrived aboard the “Main”. We feel that Heinrick came in 1885 or 1886. His daughters, Louise, Sophia, Christine, Marie, and Elenore came about the same time.Frederick lived in Indianaapolis, Indiana and Christ and the rest of the family lived in Chicago, Illinois. Heinrick and Elinor owned and operated a Laundry with Christian.\n\nDo you have any knowledge of this family? According to folk lore, they were Von Budde for some deed one of the past members did for royality.\n\nTrue or not, we don’t know.\n\nI do have this one family pretty well documented but when Fred and Christ was in Indianapolis, there was also a Fritz Budde living in the same apartment. He was only in the one Census. I think I have found him and Fritz is a nickname. His name would have been Friedrich Carl Budde and his Parents were Johan Friedrich Budde and Caroline Sophie Schaeferfranz. I do have this history also. Do you think that you would have any information that would help in tying these two families together and why they left Westphalia, W. Prussia? Thank You\n\nDoris Budde brbudde1@juno.com\n\nMore info added in November 2004\n\nHello Paul,\n\nIt has been a long time since we last talked. I have never been able to find anything on my Husbands branch of the Budde’s of Westfalia.\n\nOnly that Heinrich and Elinor (Bohn) Budde were here in Chicago. When they came and on what ship is a mystery. It is believed that 2 of their 5 daughters came alone on a ship, perhaps the “Ems” and the other 3 must have come with them. Their one son, Frederick came with his wife, Christine on either the ‘Main” or the “Fulda” and their second son, Christian came on one of these at age 16. According to Frederick, the name used to be Von Budde. Perhaps he meant Vom Budde, who knows.\n\nI do have their history on this side of the ocean but nothing on the Prussian side.\n\nYou and I have talked about this before and you knew nothing about them either, so I guess there is no way of learning. I also think I have found the Fritz Budde that stayed a year with Frederick and Christ in Indianapolis. But this is not for sure.\n\nSo you see, I am still in the same place as when we talked about this. Thank You for letting me know the new address. I wish you well\n\nDoris\n\nWilliam Alfred Budde/Toronto -Germany\n\nHi, Paul my name is Jeremy Budde I am currently living in Grande Prairie Alberta, Canada. I have no idea if we are the slightest bit related but I figured I would give it a shot. I’m just trying to trace my family’s background. My Oma and my dad and two aunties, moved to Toronto from Germany. My Opa died after the war, his name was William Alfred Budde. If you know anything write back.Its a long shot but I figured I would try. jeremybudde@hotmail.com\n\nBuddes in Osnabruck?\n\nDear Paul\n\nFound your site when I was doing one of my periodic trawls for Povels. Very impressive. And I hadn’t known that Sophia Bruck was a godmother to a Budde child, so that was good – thanks. I am one of the myriads of descendants of Sophia’s sister, Frederica Clara Bruck.\n\nHaving read your site, I appreciate that there are rather a lot of Buddes and that they are all over the place. Nevertheless, I was wondering if you could help me identify two, particularly Dorothea Elisabeth Budde who was one of the godmothers of Anna Elisabeth Dorothea Brickwedde, born/christened 2 April 1745, Osnabruck. The child’s parents were Johann “Assuer” Brickwedde, c1707-1787, and Anna Elisabeth Sprenger, ??-1776. Ms Budde is recorded in the baptismal register as “Dorothea Elisabeth Budde, Frau Witt Heystermans”.\n\nI’ve also got an Anna Maria Budde, c1720-1796, who I think married Johann Herman Wegmann in Herbern in 1743. In 1773 in Herbern, she was godmother to Johann Herman Henric van Lohe, whose mother was a Povel.\n\nAny chance you know anything about these people? Please let me know, either yea or nay\n\nLook forward to hearing from you\n\nRegards, franciscaccooper@franciscacooper.screaming.net\n\nBuddes in Witten/Ruhr\n\nHi Paul,\n\nich stehe ganz am Anfang die Geschichte meiner Familie zu erforschen.

We live in Cincinnati, Ohio in the USA. I came by your Internet Page “Family Tree Budde Family” through a relative of mine living in Wietmarschen – Wilma (Forsting) Lockhorn.\n\nUnfortunately, I know very little about the Budde heritage. My wife’s father’s name was (deceased in l985) Norbert. His father’s name was George W. His father (George W.’s) supposedly came from Europe. That’s all I know at this time.\n\nI have been working on the Sillies Family most recently but, intend to start looking into the Budde family in the near future. As I learn more, I’ll let you know.\n\nSincerely, Donald G. Sillies Dons4golf@AOL.com\n\nBuddes in Brechten\n\nI saw your Budde genealogy Web page. Then I looked at your picture and you look a little like my uncle Edmund Walter Budde III. So I thought I’d send you what little I’d found on Buddes. I emailed a guy I found on the Internet (W. Jürgen Budde) about the history of the Budde family and here’s what he had to report. The original German that he sent back is at the bottom; my translation is at the top. (see below)\n\nMy own Budde connection was Frank Budde who came to New York from Berlin in the late 1800s. I suspect he was originally from the Osnabrück branch, but was one of the workers, rather than the wealthy landowners. Family legend has it that our branch were stained glass craftsmen traveling around from church to church… Frank’s sons all became plumbers in New York City around the turn of the century. Does this fit in with anything you’ve uncovered?\n\nThanks, Tara F. Chace chace@seanet.com http://www.seanet.com/~macki/chace\n\nIn our family history search I have come accross a Buddenhof in Brechten. The Buddes were listed to be living in Brechten since the 12/13 century and de Buddenhof was still in Brechten early in the last century (1920s?).\n\nI came across Thomas Hoeckmann in Brechten who provided me pictures and maps of Brechten and the Buddenhof.\n\nHe also provided this info:\n\nDear Paul,\n\nyes there are quite a few people named Budde in Brechten. And there are very many all over Germany. If you are very sure, that your ancestors do come from Brechten, they might be coming from the Haus marked on the map as Budde. As far as I know there is no Budde living in it any more. In the old days the younger sons had to leave the farm of the parents, because only one could be the heir. So they got a small piece of land somewhere in the village to buill a small house and have some garden land.So your direct ancestors could be also from one of those “koetter”-houses as we call them.If you want to get in contact with one of the Buddes, check the german telephone directory: www.teleauskunft.de an look for budde in Dortmund. Numbers starting with 80 are in Brechten. The next time I go to the cemetery I will take a photo of the house.\n\nDo you have any detailed information about somebody from Brechten? Let me know and I can check it out on this side. Regards Thomas Hoeckmann\n\nWilhelm Carl Budde Nordhorn 1892\n\nPaul,\n\nMy name is Gregor G. Santel and I am living in Paderborn, in Germany. I personally have Budde ancestors (Maria Adelheid Budde, * May 13, 1811 in Wietmarschen is my Old Grandmother) but this is not the reason I write to you. I have got a reference to your website from Rolf Suewolto in Paderborn/Salzkotten, Germany, and I have seen and down loaded your excellent history of the Budde family.\n\nI asked Rolf Suewolto about a Wilhelm Carl Budde from Nordhorn, but he could not help. I hope you can help me to get some information about his Budde family. He gave me the tip to ask you.\n\nThe parents of Wilhelm Carl are Johann Wilhelm Budde and Euphemia Maria Büscher. Wilhelm Carl was christened on Tuesday, April 12, 1892 in the Catholic Church of Nordhorn. The family lived in Frensdorf near Nordhorn and the occupation of his father was “Steinschläger”, stonecutter.\n\nThe next known fact is his emigration to the United States (see Ellis Island record: http://www.ellisislandrecords.org/). On July 15, 1911 he started his trip with the steamship Noordam I at the harbor of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Wilhelm Carl Budde arrived at the port of New York on July 24, 1911.\n\nFrom the “List or Manifest of Alien Passengers for the United States Immigration Officer at Port of Arrival” I have got some more information about the person Wilhelm Carl Budde. His occupation in Germany was “clerk”. His “final destination” was indicated with Indianapolis in Indiana. He wants to visit his “friend” Anton Teipen in 209 Bakemeyer Street in Indianapolis. But both of these entries are changed. The first mention of the “final destination” was “New York”. The crossed out entry in the column: “Whether going to join a relative or friend, …” is unreadable. This correction should be done during the journey. Nobody knows the reason.\n\nOn page 129 of the ship list, I found the “friends” of Wilhelm Carl Budde. Here is listed Anton Teipen and his wife Rika. They were “Going Home” after a visit of their home country. Rika, the spouse of Anton Teipen, is a sister of the grandfather of my wife.\n\nThe “nearest relative or friend in country whence alien came” was his uncle H[einrich] Schomakers. He was the owner of a “Cafe & Restaurant” in Nordhorn. This restaurant was called “Burgschenke” in the middle of the 20th century. Today the inn is called “Domspatz” (see Paul Budde history).\n\nAt the moment I can not get a connection from the parents of Wilhelm Carl Budde to one of the Budde families. Do you know something about the parents of Wilhelm Carl Budde?\n\nMembers of the Teipen family in Indianapolis asked me, to find out more about Wilhelm Carl Budde.\n\nThanks in advance for your help.\n\nGregor\n\nGregor G.

Christian Wilhelm Budde in Hanover 1835\n\nWilliam Budde was born in Hanover, Germany Dec. 5, 1835, and died from apoplexy, Dec. 29, 1913. When he was about 9 years old, he came with his parents to America and settled in Cook Co., Illinois Soon, however, his father died, after which the family moved to Chicago. After his marriage in 1855, he moved to Wheeling, Ill., and in 1879 came to Minnesota and settled in Nicollet Co. About 14 years later, he moved with his family to Mankato, Minn., where he resided until his death. Brother Budde was converted in his youth under the influence of the Evangelical Association and tried to live a Christian life and serve God. His wife died in 1911. He leaves 2 sons and 3 daughters, besides many other friends. A. A. SCHENDEL. (Newspaper obituary)\n\nMy mother found this obituary after her mother died. Until that time she had been told he had been born in Alsace-Lorraine.\n\nI would like to know of any links to Buddes in the Hanover area. His wife was Anna Maria Wolf b.

If so, we may be able to help each other.\n\nAncestral families I am researching in Ostfriesen are:\n\nBATTERMANN, TIMMER, GARRELS, BEHRENS, GNÄPHÄUS, REINTS, ARENDS, GEERTS, JÜRGEN all in the Leer district,\n\nand\n\nBUDDE, ÖTTKEN /OELTJEN, SCHÖDER, SCHWARTING in the Bremen-Bardewisch-Lemwerder area.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes from\n\nALAN LÜDEKE\n\nEUROA, VICTORIA, OZ\n\nbapl@iprimus.com.au\n\nBuddes in Pommern\n\nmy Name is Alexandros Musewald, I’m researching the Family Musewald.

Although I have only gone back to Ernest Budde, who came from the area of Westphalia, Eikhorst and listed in the Berghirchen Church records. My Great-Grandfather was Ernest Heinrich Budde, born in 1822, being the illegetimate son of Karl Frederich Budde, a farmhand in Eikhorst and the mother is Eliz. Hartman born 1797 in Eikhorst. If you know of this family, I would love to hear from you.\n\nArnetia Osborn\n\narnetia@effingham.net\n\nBudde’s from Hannover\n\nHello Paul, I found your Budde website. My grandmother was Theresia Agnes Budde, b: 1899 in Furstenau, Hannover, Germany. I recently travelled there to visit relatives and do a little genealogy research. As far as I went back, the Budde’s were in Furstenau. Johann Albert was born there in 1813 and his father’s name was Georg (or Jurgen). It was listed either way in a ‘history of the house’ it mentions that the family may have come from Brockhausen Kreis Lingen. I’m not familiar with that location but I’m still hoping for to find more information on the Budde’s. If any of this is interesting to you, please let me know and I’ll send more details.\n\nJulie Randolph\n\njarandolph@email.msn.com\n\nBudde Bavaria\n\nMy great grandfather Henerick Budde Came to America in April22,1857 from Bavaria.
