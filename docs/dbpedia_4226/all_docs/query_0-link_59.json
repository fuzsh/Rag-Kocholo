Created in-house by the firms, the albums are generally annual compilations of clippings taken from newspapers and magazines, many gathered by a clipping service. These clippings, which range in date from 1945 to 1986, are notable for their broad range of sources, drawing from specialized architectural periodicals, shelter and lifestyle magazines and obscure trade publications, in addition to newspapers. The initial albums are comprised almost exclusively of clippings, but as they move through time, the scrapbooks also include limited amounts of other materials, such as photographs, letters and ephemera. In addition to this chronological record of the firms, a final scrapbook focuses more specifically on the career of MacDonald Becket.The archive also includes promotional brochures and employee newletters created by the firms, as well as miscellaneous materials. The various promotional brochures range from the mid 1950s presentation of Welton Becket and Associates work, \"Vision...Through Supervision,\" to one marking the Ellerbe Becket merger in the late 1980s. An incomplete set of the \"Reporter,\" the employee newsletter, presents highlights of architectural projects and awards, as well as profiles of staff. A small number of miscellaneous items, primarily articles and brochures, relating to MacDonald Becket and his interests complete the collection.\n\nSummary: A broadly representative selection of drawings and 21 estimates for building and manufacture of designs, representing the various types of commissions Butterfield received and illustrating his work in promoting Gothic Revival design. Also included are record drawings (measured drawings) of buildings not designed by Butterfield.Series I.

[Digitized]\n\nSummary: Major portion of the surviving correspondence and papers (but excluding many records of his practice, especially plans and drawings) of Max Cetto. Primarily professional correspondence of Cetto during his German career (1925-1938). With some postwar correspondence relating to CIAM and with Walter and Ise Gropius; one manuscript from his period in Mexico; miscellaneous personal papers; vertical file material; and three examples of his drawings and models.Series I. General correspondence, 1925-1938, arranged in chronological order (folder 1-10). The correspondence is mostly of a professional and business nature and relates to Cetto's professional advancement, projects, competitions and exhibitions, and the publication of articles and reviews. Part of the correspondence is devoted to Cetto's membership and participation in the CIAM. His correspondence with Walter Gropius concerns the economic hardships Cetto faced in being a member of CIAM. Most notable among the correspondents are: H. de Fries, Hermann Loeb, Siegfried Giedion, Hans Poelzig, Mart Stam, Roger Poulain, J.J.P. Oud, Bruno Taut, Richard I. Neutra, Quik Waehlin, Mies van der Rohe, Lili Reich and Walter Gropius.In a letter from H. de Fries, 1927 May 17, there is a critical discussion of Cetto's \"Voelkerbundpalais Genf\" project, which is also commented on by S. Giedion, 1927 Aug. 19, and defended by Cetto, 1927 Sept. 19. In these letters there is also a brief discussion of Richard Neutra's, Le Corbusier's and Hannes Meyer's entries to the same competition. An exchange of letters between Cetto and his brother Friedrich, 1932 April 11-23, reflects Cetto's view of Communism and discuss his attempts to find work in Russia. Of interest are further several letters from Max Cetto, 1933-1936, which reflect his attempts to adapt to the political changes in Germany without compromising his architectural ideals and his relationship to emigrated collegues. In 1938 Sept. 10, a cover letter from Eugene Masselink, Frank Lloyd Wright's secretary, announces a letter of recommendation on Cetto's behalf, to secure him an American visa; this letter is annotated in an unknown hand.Most notable is a letter to his cousin Alice Day, 1927 Nov. 17, in which Cetto discusses in detail his own views on modern architecture. In an attempt to briefly outline the historical evolution of modern European architecture, he mentions as predecessors and exemplary models Berlage, van der Velde, Loos, Wagner, Poelzig, Le Corbusier and Gropius and comments on the importance of the Bauhaus, the \"Werkbundausstellung 'Die Wohnung,' Stuttgart 1927,\" the \"Genfer Voelkerbundwettbewerb\" and the \"Staedtische Hochbauamt Frankfurt.\" Cetto distances himself from the \"emotional\" tendencies of Expressionism and proclaims himself an avid follower of the \"rational\" \"Neue Sachlichkeit,\" whose basic artistic and architectural principles he tries to define.Series II. General correspondence, 1947-1949, arranged in chronological order (folder 11). The correspondence in this series mostly discusses attempts to form a Mexican delegation to the post-war congresses of the CIAM in 1948-1949. In his letters to Jose Luis Sert and Stamo Papadaki Cetto stresses repeatedly his reservations concerning the formation of such a delegation, citing the pseudo-modernistic tendencies of many popular Mexican architects.Series III. Correspondence with Walter and Ise Gropius, 1947 to 1970, arranged in chronological order (folder 12). The correspondence in this series is mostly of a personal nature, discussing vacation plans and family matters. Cetto repeatedly asks for recommendations and work. Some letters discuss specific projects by Gropius such as \"Grand Central City\" and the \"Gropius Stadt\" in Berlin. Also mentioned are several individual members of the The Architects' Collaborative (TAC). After the death of Walter Gropius in 1969, his wife discusses exhibitions and the secondary material in preparation by different institutions and scholars.Series IV. Manuscript writings, arranged in chronological order (folder 13). This series contains a number of typescripts of articles and reviews written by Cetto, predominantly before 1933. Most notably \"Glas und Gesundheit\" (1930) and \"Das Entwerfen an den technischen Lehranstalten Offenbach\" (1930) as well as critical reports on various competitions, with photographic materials used by Cetto to illustrate the articles. Also, this series contains an undated manuscript (with a French translation), discussing various modern industrial, public and private architectural projects, partly designed by Cetto and constructed from 1929 to 1939 in Frankfurt and California.Series V. Printed writings, arranged in chronological order (folder 14). Twelve articles and reviews published by Cetto, 1925-1932, on competitions, books, exhibitions and various architectural projects and topics.Series VI. Assorted printed materials, arranged in chronological order (folder 15). This series contains printed materials and newspaper clippings, 1926-1970, pertaining to various topics of architectural interest, most notable clippings discussing Cetto's prize winning entry to the competition \"Hauptzollamt,\" 1926. Also, various programs of and invitations to CIAM meetings and congresses, 1933-1935, and to a congress of the \"Union Internationale des Architectes,\" 1948. Folder 15a contains printed matter mostly relating to the Bauhaus, 1926-1931.Series VII. Printed materials on Walter and Ise Gropius, arranged in chronological order (folder 16). Eight articles and newspaper clippings discussing the work and life of Walter and Ise Gropius, dated 1949-1970.Series VIII. Personal papers, arranged in chronological order (folder 17). Assorted personal papers, 1917-1959. Most notable among them are various evaluations by other architects, grade reports, membership cards, teaching schedules and contracts.Series IX. Drawings and models. One original drawing, dated 1928 May 8, and 2 photographs of models for the \"Genfer Voelkerpalais\" project, 1927.Series X. Group photograph, 1927 (folder 19). A group photograph of Hans Poelzig, Cetto and others, dated 1927 Sept. 14.\n\nSummary: Preliminary designs for a house in Vienna for Margarethe Stonborough, sister of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, with letters to and from Engelmann. The album of sketches was prepared by Engelmann in 1926 as a present to Frau Stonborough. It is entitled \"Skizzenbuch/April-Mai 1926,\" with an inscription on the title page, \"Frau Margarete Stonborough zu Weihnachten 1926 von P. E.\" The sketchbook contains 79 drawings glued on the album pages. All sketches are in pencil with the exception of two ink drawings. The drawings consist of plans, including one measured plan (scale 1:100) dated 18 May 1926, elevations, and interior and exterior perspectives. The form of the house changed dramatically from its initial conception to the adopted plan.The collection includes 4 original letters and 7 photocopies of letters, the originals of which are not owned by the repository. Each of the 4 original letters are written by Engelmann: one appears to be addressed to Margarete Stonborough's sister, Hermine Wittgenstein (1932), thanking her for photographs and praising the achievement of her brother. Two are written to Friedrich Hayek (1953), and discuss, among other things, Ludwig Wittgenstein's role in the design of his sister's house. Engelmann credits Wittgenstein with the final design, although important elements of the initial design made by Engelmann were retained, especially in the plan. The fourth letter (1962) is addressed to Thomas Stonborough (Margarethe's son) and discusses the house. In addition 7 photocopied letters have been added to the collection; 5 are written to Engelmann by Hayek and dated 1953, 2 are written by Engelmann to Hayek, also in 1953.\n\nSummary: The Frank Brothers records contain material from the Frank Brothers furniture company. With its retail store and related services and its furniture importing company, Frank Brothers is credited with defining and promoting mid-century modern furniture design on the West Coast. The company provided, marketed, and sold the furnishings for many of the innovative homes featured in Arts and Architecture magazine's Case Study House Program. It also introduced many of Charles and Ray Eames' revolutionary furniture pieces.Documentation of the Frank Brothers retail store comprises Series I and forms the bulk of the archive. It covers the entire range of operations of the retail aspect of the business. This documentation is primarily visual, including photographs, slides, trade catalogs, scrapbooks and various printed material, and Frank Brothers' commitment to design in all its aspects is overwhelmingly evident, in the furnishing they sold, the ways in which they marketed them, and even in the store itself. The materials included here demonstrate the productive and close relationship Frank Brothers had with a number of designers, especially Charles and Ray Eames; documents the creation of a West coast contemporary aesthetic by the store's interior design service and reveals the striking graphic design of Frank Brothers' print advertising and direct mail campaigns.Two smaller groups of material round out the archive. Series II contains documentation of Moreddi, the wholesale, import division of the family business, run by Ed Frank, which supplied furnishings for the Frank Brothers store and other retailers. Personal material relating to family members, especially Ed and Ron Frank, comprises Series III. Of particular interest is the documentation of Ed Frank's home, Case Study House #25, designed by Ed Killingsworth.\n\nSummary: The MOD-X Building System records document the brief life of this product as its creators sought to find a niche for it in the post World War II efforts to industrialize building design and construction through prefabrication. Consisting primarily of legal and financial records and correspondence among the various stakeholders, as well as drawings and photographs, the archive provides insight into one of the most critical issues that the architectural profession faced during the period spanning the second half of the 1940s until well into the 1960s: how to design buildings that could be mass produced by big construction companies while at the same time maintaining sufficient artistic freedom to make the buildings interesting and attractive.The material preserved in the archive falls into two main groups: design records, and legal and financial records. The design records provide documentation of the system itself. Notes, sketches, architectural drawings, structural calculations and testing reports, and materials sourcing information, as well as photographs, trace the development of the MOD-X Building System. The photographs show multiple aspects of the system, from the prototype bungalow erected in Kidbrooke to marketing campaigns such as the MOD-X stand at the British Industries Fair or the display of a mocked-up hospital treatment room.The legal and financial records document the attempt to bring this new building system to market and turn it into a viable business enterprise. Documentation created by Dex Harrison, the firm of Harrison & Seel and the two companies formed specifically to implement the system, MOD-X Holdings Ltd. and Dex (Prefabrications) Ltd., comprises this section of the archive. Deeds of trust, account statements, corporate minutes, contracts and correspondence with patent agents, solicitors and accountants write the history and ultimate failure of this modular construction system.A third, very small group of materials belonging to Dex Harrison, but unrelated to the MOD-X system, completes the archive.\n\nSummary: Collection contains a minor portion of Hassenpflug’s correspondence, 1945-1963, manuscript writings on the Bauhaus (illustrated with 40 pictures), his architectural work in the Soviet Union and Soviet land use. Collection also contains some printed material, mostly relating to the Bauhaus and Hassenpflug's architectural work, ca. 100 photographs of wood and steel furniture and architectural drawings, partially designed in collaboration with Marcel Breuer and ca 60 drawings and blueprints of buildings and furniture designed by Hassenpflug, 1934-1935.Organization: I. Correspondence, 1945-1963, arranged in chronological order (folders 1-4); II. Manuscript writings (folders 5-7); III. Printed material (folders 8-9); IV. Photographs (box 2); V. Drawings and blueprints (870030* and 870030**)Series I. A minor portion of Hassenpflug's correspondence, 1945-1963, documents Hassenpflugs professional activities during the postwar period, his attempts to organize a Bauhaus exhibition, his teaching as a professor at the Bauhochschule in Weimar and later as the director of the Landeskunstschule Hamburg, his role in the reconstruction of Berlin and his efforts to establish new German contacts with the CIAM. Most notable are two letters from Marcel Breuer, 1947 June 24 and 1961 May 5, commenting on Breuer’s professional activities and personal life during his exile in America and on Hassenpflug's history of steel furniture. Among the other correspondents are: Fred Frobat, Max Bill, Gabriel Guevresian, Herbert Bayer, Siegfried Gideon, Martin Wagner, Embru-Werke (Switzerland), Gio Ponti and Marianne Brandt.Series II. A typescript copy of an expert opinion, \"Konsultationen \"uber grossblockige Typenwohnungen fur die Stadt Chabarowsk\", rendered by Hassenpflug in 1932 on prefabricated housing for the town of Khabarovsk (folder 5). A postwar typescript copy of a land use study, 1932-1934, for the development of the southern shore of the Crimea (folder 6). A retrospective 14 page history of the Bauhaus, 1919-1933, illustrated with 40 photographs, with some miscellaneous material on the Bauhaus, most notably an accomanying lecture by Karl-Anton Frühauf on the same topic, excerpts from postwar letters by Joost Schmidt and Walter Gropius relating to a Baushaus exhibition and some annotated statements concerning Hassenpflug's education at the Bauhaus and Hannes Meyer's role as its director (folder 7).III. Printed material. Miscellaneous articles and newspaper clippings mostly related to the Bauhaus and Hassenpflug's architectural work. With the 1937 Nov. issue of the \"Nachrichten der deutschen Linoleumwerke A.-G.\" with an article on Hassenpflugs's interior design of two showrooms of a textile company; a Soviet travel brochure titled \"Der transsibirische Express\" and the 1930 edition of N.A. Miliutin's book \"Problema stroitel stva sotsialisticheskikh gorodov.\"IV. Photographs. Ca. 100 photographs, 1925-1953, of houses, furniture and architectural drawings by Hassenpflug, some of which were produced in collaboration with Marcel Breuer (box 2).V. Forty-five drawings and blueprints for the showrooms Rummeng, Berlin (870030* and 870030**); 27 blueprints of metal furniture designs for the Swiss company Embru (870030* and 870030**); 2 drawings for a house Worbes (870030*); 4 blueprints of wood furniture designs (870030*); 8 blueprints of steel furniture designs (870030*); 10 drawings and blueprints for a house Winsch (870030* and 870030**); one folder with 4 miscellaneous drawings and blueprints (870030*).\n\nSummary: The papers of Carl Ernst Hinkefuss comprise original trade mark and poster designs, mounted graphic designs, print blocks, printed ephemera, photographs, postcards, correspondence, books, and related papers. Working both independently and with his business partner Wilhelm Deffke in the firm Wilhelmwerk, Carl Ernst Hinkefuss was among the early commercial graphic designers in the field of advertising, who specialized in trademark and logo design. Linked philosophically and aesthetically to the ideas of the German Werkbund and subsequently the Bauhaus, Hinkefuss developed a very simple style that sought to integrate the worlds of commerce and design. Hinkefuss and Deffke did not draw or paint their designs, but created images in the form of figurative, abstract, or typological cut-outs in colored paper mounted on a background sheet. These images were so visually powerful that they could either be reduced to a small logo or enlarged to a full-page brochure. Using these defining images, Hinkefuss created what we now call \"brand identities,\" designing not only the stationery for businesses, but also the invoices, envelopes, packaging, and advertising.Materials relating to Hinkefuss's professional career comprise Series I of the archive. Examples of his graphic design work form the majority of the material and include assembled sample portfolios, hundreds of loose original designs, and letterpress print blocks. Aside from his commercial brand identity work, Hinkefuss also produced two significant publications for the world of graphic arts. He published and edited Qualität, a journal promoting industrial and graphic design, which became more and more modern, especially after Hinkefuss began working with a printing house in Dessau, shortly after the Bauhaus had moved to that city as well. Das Vogelparadies (1929), a modern children's book showing birds rendered in simple but bright, colorful forms on a black background, is often incorrectly associated with the Bauhaus. The archive includes a photocopy of the complete run of Qualität, as well as ephemera and proofs relating to this and other publications to which Hinkefuss contributed. Of particular interest are two wooden Bauhaus-style toys, reproductions of the pelican from Mein Vogelparadies, which served as exemplars and promotional items for the book. A small selection of professional correspondence, photographs of Hinkefuss's studio and displays of his work, and miscellaneous materials round out the series.A limited quantity of photographs and other personal material forms Series II. Of particular interest in this series is the documentation of Hinkefuss's trip to the United States in 1913. In part a vacation, the trip's professional research component is shown by the extensive series of postcards documenting the facilities of the Curtis Publishing Company of Philadelphia.\n\nSummary: The collection contains material from several stages in Hofman's career and includes published articles, letters and postcards, catalogs, awards, curricula vitae, and material relating to conferences and exhibitions. The photo archive contains biographical photographs and photographs of set designs for the theater, costume designs for film and theater, realized sets and performances, decorative arts designs, and paintings. The collection also includes original architectural drawings and decorative arts designs.Hofman's views on contemporary trends in art and the theater are represented in a large number of articles published in several well-known avant-garde Czech periodicals, primarily of the 1910s and 1920s. An extensive collection of letters and postcards (ca. 360 items), many from prominent figures in the Czech avant-garde movement, provides a glimpse of the Czech intellectual debate surrounding art in the first decades of the 20th century. Correspondence includes 65 letters (1916-1918) from the writer Jan Bartoš, 2 letters from the poet Stanislav Neumann, 14 letters from Josef and Karel Čapek to Hofman recounting their observations of French art and culture. Other letters and postcards include 10 from the artist Pavel Janák, and 2 from the painter Bohumil Kubišta. Miroslav Ponc sent Hofman two original scores, dated 1961, 1962. Three postcards were sent from Paris by Otakar Kubín to Josef Čapek (ca. 1913). Several letters from Lee Simonson document Hofman's participation in an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1934. Printed material and correspondence regarding exhibitions and Hofman's participation in the 4th Volta Conference, an international theater conference in Rome in 1934, attest to the international recognition Hofman received, primarily for his work in the decorative arts and the theater. Among the ca. 25 items relating to the conference, which was led by Pirandello, are photographs of the conferees and a signed photographic portrait of Pirandello. In addition to reviews, 7 posters (dating from ca. 1951-1984) document exhibitions of Hofman's designs.Hofman has been credited with an enormous contribution to Czech theater, in a career which spanned over forty years. His involvement in the theater is documented in this collection with several volumes of photographs of sets, costumes and production designs. One volume is devoted to costume designs for the 1951 film \"Ana proletářka.\" Photographs also document Hofman's work in the decorative arts, including realized furniture projects and ceramic designs representative of his Cubo-expressionism. Original drawings for architectural sketches, entries for design competitions, and projects in the decorative arts are from the early years of Hofman's career. The photo archive also contains images of Hofman, his family and friends, including some well-known Czech artists and writers.\n\nSummary: A broad range of manuscript writings drawn from Hoffmann's personal papers, 1898-1938 but especially strong in his writings for public presentations, 1924-1932. The material documents the concepts Hoffmann developed in dealing with the \". . . conflicting impulses of his time: tradition and innovation, conservatism and progress, the countryside and the city, craftsmanship and industrialization, decoration and functionalism\" (Jane Kallir, 1986). Furthermore it shows Hoffmann's intense involvement in the fate of the Wiener Werkstätte and the Kunstgewerbeschule, Vienna, his interest in art and architectural education and his involvement in the arts and crafts movement. The collection also includes a minor portion of the architect's correspondence and about 195 photographs of objects designed by Hoffmann and other members of the Wiener Werkstätte after 1919, some printed material and ephemera and a single set of architectural drawings. After Hoffmann's death these papers passed to his friend and biographer, Leopold Wolfgang Rochowanski. The rare book dealer Oscar Schreyer wrote English summaries for many of the letters and manuscripts in this archive; these are filed with the originals.Series I. Letters from Hoffman, 1925-1938, arranged chronologically. A minor portion of the letters written by Hoffmann, mostly undated and of an official nature. The letters reflect Hoffmann's fundamental differences with the Administration of the Wiener Werkstätte after 1928. They also offer information about Hoffmann's role in the Oesterreische Werkbund and his reasons for leaving.Series II. Letters received, 1902-1940, arranged in chronological order. Twenty-four postcards and letters from friends, collegues, students and unknown correspondents, all personal and informal in nature. Notable is a letter from Jozsef Vago, 1929 Nov. 16, discussing the Genfer Voelkerbundpalais project. Among the other correspondents are Dagobert Peche, Ernesto De Fiori, Alfred Roller, Adolph Vetter, and Martin Dülfer.Series III. Manuscripts by Hoffmann, 1895-1938, arranged chronologically by subject. Sixty-six manuscripts, mostly unpublished, some annotated, are drafts of lectures, memoranda and articles. English synopses prepared by Oscar Schreyer accompany most of them. Subjects include furniture and interior design, architecture, including individual projects, art education and the applied arts, the evolution of the Wiener Werkstätte and its roots in the English arts and crafts movement, the Kunstgewerbeschule, the Akademie in Vienna and the Oesterreichische Werkbund.Series IV. Printed matter, 1919-1945, includes newspaper clippings of Hoffmann's articles, 1931- ca. 1945, and eight items about Hoffmann, ca. 1919-1934.Series V. Architectural drawings, photographs and graphic arts comprise four architectural drawings, with the Wiener Werkstätte stamp, for a casino with adjacent house in Kapfenburg, Austria; ca. 195 photographs of functional and decorative objects designed by Werkstätte students, including Gudrun Baudisch, Mathilde Flögl, Dagobert Peche, Michael Powolny, Vally Wieselthier, and others. Also, portraits of Hoffmann and other Wiener Werkstätte artists; three photographs of architectural drawings, and one color lithograph by an unknown artist.Series VI. Ephemera, 1909-1950, consists of 12 items which refer to Hoffmann, objects produced at the Wiener Werkstätte, and the role of the Werkstätte in Viennese cultural life. Also includes invoices and receipts, 1928-1930, which document the business relationship between the Wiener Werkstätte and the firm of Franz Untergerger.\n\nSummary: The Franklin D. Israel papers detail the short but substantial career of the prominent Los Angeles-based architect and his design firm, encompassing design processes while also providing insight into the establishment of firms and modern architectural business practice. The archive is an important resource for researchers looking to study in greater detail the developments in California architecture after modernism had fallen out of fashion.Series I contains project drawings and records, with the bulk of the material comprised of architectural projects from the late-1980s to the mid-1990s. Original drawings, prints, models, photographs, and extensive documentation and correspondence files form the core of this series. Most of Israel's creative output is represented here, from private residences such as the Goldberg/Bean House (Hollywood, 1991) and the Drager House (Berkeley, CA, 1992), both of which received \"Record Houses\" awards, to the business offices of film and record production companies such as Propaganda Films (Hollywood, 1988) and Virgin Records (Beverly Hills, 1991). Other notable projects include the art pavilion for Frederick Weisman (Beverly Hills, 1991), built to house one of the largest private collections of contemporary art in the world. Instances of Israel's non-architectural design work and consulting, including furniture and interior design, are also represented.Series II documents the professional career of Frank Israel. The bulk of this series includes extensive administrative and financial documentation of Israel's design firm,Franklin D. Israel Design Associates (FDIDA), and materials related to exhibitions, articles, photographs, and publication files, including production materials for larger publications such as Rizzoli International's 1992 monograph surveying the work of Frank Israel. Documentation of other professional activities, such as service on competition juries, and lectures are also included along with files relating to Israel's education and teaching career, awards and honors, articles and ephemera written by Frank Israel, and general correspondence.Series III, a small series of personal papers, completes the archive.\n\nSummary: The Ray Kappe papers offer comprehensive coverage of his long and varied career, which began in the 1950s and encompassed roles as architect, planner, and educator. The archive highlights Kappe's role in furthering the strong California tradition of designing buildings in tune with nature, of experimenting with prefabricated building components and modular planning, and of addressing such issues as sustainability. The collection is therefore a valuable resource for studying important developments in post-war California modernism, including the development of what is today known as \"green\" architecture. The collection is also a useful resource for studying the recent history of architectural education, as Kappe directed programs at both California Polytechnic University, Pomona and Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc), one of the country's most influential and experimental schools of architecture.The project records in Series I form the core of the collection. Representing the first 50 years of Kappe's career, the series encompasses the majority of the architect's oeuvre, although it does not contain more recent work initiated or completed after 2003, such as the energy-efficient residences designed for Steve Glenn's Living Homes. Comprising over 300 executed and unexecuted projects ranging from large and small residences to office buildings and parks, the archive holds drawings and models, in addition to sketches, photographs, and project files, and it provides documentation on major projects from the early, middle, and later phases of Kappe's career. Included, for instance, is the groundbreaking house Kappe designed for his own family in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles in 1965, which heralded the architect's expert use of post-and-beam construction and an elevated design system that allowed the building to nestle sensitively on its awkward hillside site. Represented, too, is the 1977 Borghei House (Santa Monica Canyon) in which Kappe responded to new building code restrictions by using concrete-block construction and smaller window apertures, and the 1993 Shapiro House (Santa Monica Canyon) that saw Kappe experimenting with steel frames and poured concrete while still emphasizing his core principles of uniting interior and exterior spaces and foregrounding energy efficiency and modularity. A particularly interesting portion of the archive consists of planning projects, such as those prepared for the cities of Inglewood and Compton, that highlight Kappe's commitment to revitalizing urban neighborhoods and commercial districts.The two subsequent series document other facets of Kappe's professional life. Series II comprises his teaching materials and administrative records during his tenure at Cal Poly Pomona and SCI-Arc. This documentation reveals Kappe's interest in redefining architectural education through experimental curriculum and practice. Series III is composed of all other materials, aside from the individual project files, relating to Kappe's professional affiliations and role as a leading Southern California architect and planner. He maintained ample records of his decades-long involvement with the American Institute of Architects and with the Los Angeles Goals Program, in addition to preserving documentation of others citing his work in a variety of media. The series also highlights his interest in energy conservation, urban design, and affordable housing.\n\nSummary: The collection is principally comprised of letters from surrealists in Paris in the years immediately following the Second World War, and includes extended reportage and commentary relating to Breton's circle and to their publications and exhibitions. Kiesler visited and exhibited in Paris in 1947 and 1948 and collaborated at this time with Breton on his \"Ode a Charler Fourier.\"Series I. In French and German from Paris. The Czech painters discuss the planning and publication of the surrealist magazine NEON (first issued in Jan 1948) and report extensively on the intellectual atmosphere of Paris and the activities of the surrealist group, especially those associated with NEON, who include Toyen (Marie Cerminova), Jacques Herold, Jindrich Styrsky and Andre Breton. Heisler comments, often at length, on avant-garde publications, movements, events and personalities, including: the New York journal Instead; Henri Paris of and his \"Quatre Vents\"; Zervos and the Cahiers d'Art; Jean-Paul Sartre and the vogue for existentialism; and Breton's friends and enemies, including Alberto Giacometti and Charles Duit. There are shorter references to an exhibition of Antoni Tapies, Marcel Duchamp, Jean Arp, Karel Teige, and Roberto Matta.Series II. Letters from Marcel Jean, 1974-1949, 1958 (15 items). Thirteen letters (in French and English) from Paris and Budapest, dated 1947 Nov-1949 June, reporting at length on surrealist activities in Paris; describing the intellectual atmosphere in Czechsolovakia and Hungary during a visit in 1948; and describing arrangements for an exhibition of his work at the Artist's Gallery in New York. Those who figure most prominently are Matta, Breton, Tanguy, and the poet Malcolm de Chazal. And there is some discussion of Heisler and his NEON magazine. Perhaps most significant is an account of the \"Matta affair,\" with reflections on the suicide in 1949 of Arshile Gorky and on Breton's attempts to moralize the event for his circle. With two brief letters of 1958, about visits to New York.Series III. Letters from Jean Arp (signed Hans), and Sophie Taeuber-Arp, 1938-1962 (12 items). Series includes a letter from Sophie Taeuber-Arp, 1938 Jan 23, describing her magazine Plastique, its purpose and its contributors, and with verse of Jean Arp and herself; eight letters from Jean Arp to Kiesler and his wife, from Paris and Basel, 1948 Jan-Oct, with detailed plans and arrangements for publications and exhibitions of Arp's and Kiesler's works and writings in New York, Paris and Switzerland, and with news; and three long personal letters from Marguerite Hagenbach Arp, 1957-1962, from Paris and Basel, primarily about Jean (Hans) Arp. These letters concern his health, his exhibitions, his poetry and the excitement and problems involved with his growing fame.Series IV. Miscellaneous letters received, 1932-1961 (56 items). Primarily single letters or short files of personal, social and incidental business notes from artists, curators and writers in New York and Paris. Arranged alphabetically. Letters of some note include four from Katherine S. Dreier (1937-1949) reporting Duchamp's and Kandinsky's comments on Kiesler's article on \"the Large Glass,\" three from Fredi B.[?] in Paris (1943-1949) with references to \"NEON,\" \"Instead,\" and Kiesler's circle; a 1939 letter from R. Buckminster Fuller, with a long critique of the \"Laboratory School of Design\" and the philosophy of the Bauhaus; a letter of Amedee Ozenfant, 1939, with reflections on his education, the conditions of painting in America and the New Bauhaus of Moholy-Nagy; a friendly postcard (1932 Dec 21), and a letter from Piet Mondrian (1937) on selections of his work for a N.Y. show; and 13 letters from Hans Richter (1941-1949) among which he describes his difficulties establishing himself in New York in 1941.The series also includes seven letters, 1947 Oct.-1948 March from Christian and Yvonne Zervos relating to surrealist exhibitions at Galerie Maeght and to the affairs of Cahiers d'Art. With an apparently unrelated list of works loaned by Julien Levy in 1932 to the Harvard Society of Contemporary Art. Series also includes letters from Alexandre Alexandre, Pierre Boulez, Serge Chermayeff, Jasper Johns, William Maywald, Sibyl Noholy-Magy, Henri Parisot, Philip Pavia, Gabrielle Buffet-Picabia, Xanti Schawinsky, Anthony Smith and Dorthea Tanning (with a note from Max Ernst).\n\nSummary: The Pierre Koenig papers and drawings contain the archive of this Los Angeles architect best-known for his work in steel and participation in the Case Study House Program. Consisting of drawings, photographs and slides, documents, client correspondence, and three models, the archive provides in-depth information about Koenig's 50-year career. The archive is an important resource for the study of Southern California Modernism, as well as for the study of pre-fabrication in housing in the United States.Records and drawings relating to Pierre Koenig's architectural projects form Series I, the core of the archive. With over 2,000 original and reproduction drawings, the archive is very complete. More than eighty executed and unexecuted building projects, including all of Koenig's major houses, such as Case Study Houses #21 and #22, the Johnson House in Carmel Valley, CA (1962), the Iwata House in Monterey Park, CA (1963), the Gantert House in Los Angeles (1983), and the Schwartz House in Santa Monica (1996), are represented in the archive. A particularly interesting project is the Chemehuevi Indian Reservation Planning Program, sponsored by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. Koenig and his USC students designed pre-fabricated steel homes for the reservation located near Havasu Lake in San Bernardino County, California, but the project was never built.The two subsequent series record other aspects of Koenig's professional life. Series II is comprised of Koenig's teaching materials and documentation of his administrative role at the University of Southern California, School of Architecture. Koenig took his teaching very seriously. He was very conscious of the fact that he was training the next generation of architects and proud of the fact that he had supervised over 100 student research projects investigating the interaction of structures and the natural environment. Series III is comprised of all the other materials, aside from the individual project files, relating to Koenig's role as an architect, such as his office files and reference files. Also included here is a dossier of Koenig's work. Koenig was very active in interpreting and publicizing his work and he also maintained documentation of others citing his work in a variety of media from clippings to exhibitions to videos.Series IV is comprised of Pierre Koenig's personal papers. His college class projects trace Koenig's emerging development as an architect, and the extensive documentation of his early military service helps place his personal development. The final series of the archive, compiled after Koenig's death in 2004, documents the continuing legacy of his life and work.\n\nSummary: The William Krisel papers detail the prolific career of one of Southern California's most successful architects. The archive emphasizes Krisel's important role as an architect for the masses, bringing affordable, well-designed modern residences and landscapes to middle class families throughout the region, including Los Angeles, San Diego, and the Coachella Valley. It also documents his influence in a range of building types, including custom homes, tract houses, apartments, condominiums, and commercial, industrial and institutional buildings. The archive is a significant resource for the study of mass-produced housing and mid-century aesthetics in Southern California, particularly in light of the recent resurgence of interest in Krisel's work among homeowners.The project drawings and records in Series I form the core of the archive. Drawings, documentation and photographs, including images by Julius Shulman, representing almost 300 projects form a cross-section of Krisel's work from the 1950s through the 1970s. The series demonstrates Krisel's commitment to collaborating with developers throughout the region in order to produce great quantities of high quality residences. Included are materials from Corbin Palms (Woodland Hills, 1953-1955), Krisel and Palmer's first large project for George Alexander, which featured four basic house plans with different elevations, color schemes, landscaping and siting, as well as materials for the Sandpiper Condominiums, a complex of pinwheel-shaped buildings constructed in Palm Desert and Indian Wells between 1958 and 1966 by two separate developers. The series also includes a large number of commercial and industrial projects, such as industrial parks, shopping centers, medical and office buildings, and hotels. Of particular note is the Ocotillo Lodge in Palm Springs (1955-1957), which he designed for Alexander Construction and Joseph Dunas as a destination resort to attract potential homeowners to the Coachella Valley.Two small series complete the archive. Series II is comprised of documentation relating to the broader aspects of Krisel's career as an architect, including correspondence, awards and diplomas, general press coverage and documentation of the various architectural firms with which he worked. A very small third series includes personal papers such as military honors, family photographs and portraits of Krisel.\n\nSummary: Designed by Le Corbusier and his collaborator Iannis Xenakis, the Philips Pavilion was based on the idea of L.C. Kalff. There remains some question as to whether Xenakis or Le Corbusier should receive credit for the design of the building. The pavilion, which was ultimately declared unstable and destroyed, was designed as a shell structure composed entirely of prestressed concrete in the form of hyperbolic paraboloids individually cast to fit a complex framework of steel cables. The expressed object of the pavilion was to demonstrate the capabilities of modern technology in engineering, electro-acoustics, electronics, and automatic control techniques. The building was designed and equipped for an automatic performance of a spectacle in light and sound entitled \"le poème electronique\" which was conceived and written by Le Corbusier and included the music of Edgard Varèse. The collection includes correspondence, architectural drawings, photographs, color slides, painted glass plates and a script for \"le poème electronique.\"Series I. Correspondence, 1955-1958 (ca. 190 items): Approximately 190 items including copies of outgoing correspondence from Kalff and other Philips's executives, and incoming correspondence primarily from Xenakis and Le Corbusier. The letters include initial conceptions of the project, progress reports and statements of expenses, and contain some discussion of technical matters. Other correspondents include Edgard Varèse, R. van Pevenage, Paul Heyden, R. d'Aboville, J. Pugliesi-Conti, Evert Cornelis, Ch. Spaens, E.B.W. Schuitema and film producer Philippe Agostini. In chronological order.Series II. Architectural drawings and site plans (8 items): A numbered series of pen and ink conceptual sketches probably by Xenakis, illustrating the basic concepts for the pavilion's design, with a plan, elevations, and perspective views, and two blueprints with measured drawings of plans with an elevation (pencil notes and color added).Series III. Script and notes for \"le poème electronique\" (ca. 20 items): A 140 p. mimeographed script for the automatic 8-10 min. performance, with annotations and watercolor added by Jean Petit. With copies of 18 sheets of notes relating to the performance. (microfilm available).Series IV. Photographs, 1956-1958 (163 items): One hundred sixty-three construction and project photographs which document the maquettes, construction and scaffolding, casting of the concrete shells on open sand-bed molds, prestressing wires, laying of the foundation, and the exterior of the completed building. Also includes photographs of Le Corbusier, Xenakis and Kalff.Series V. Painted glass plates and glass slides (33 items): Eight hand-painted fan-shaped glass plates for use in a rotary disk projector and 18 handpainted rectangular glass plates; also seven medium format color and black-and-white slides of the interior of the pavilion and of the performance.\n\nSummary: A portion of the papers documenting the late period of Adolf Loos' work, 1930-1932, as reflected in the papers of his assistant Kurt Unger. The papers include correspondence, drawings, manuscripts, miscellaneous printed material, and portraits of Loos.Correspondence with Unger (in part dictated to his wife Claire Loos) concerns several projects and project specifications. Correspondence between Unger and the glass manufacturer/distributor Lobmeyr, discusses the production of glassware designed by Loos. The collection includes 21 drawings and blueprints of houses, with two letters of specification for the \"Fleischer\" house, Haifa Israel, and drawings and blueprints of the glassware; a typescript translation of Adolf Loos' \"Der Sattlermeister\"; miscellaneous printed material; one pencil sketch of Loos; and one portrait photo.Organization: I.

Correspondence, 1918-1934, arranged in chronological order (folders 1-3). The correspondence is mostly of a professional nature and contains instructions and specifications for various projects in progress, most notably the remodeling and interior decoration of the medical offices of Dr. Teichner, Pilsen 1931, and the project house \"Dr. Fleischner,\" Haifa Israel 1931; with a postcard from Peter Altenberg to Loos, 1918; a letter to Werner Hegemann discussing the edition of a book about Loos' work, 1930 May 29; a letter from Unger to the journal \"Form,\" discussing his views on modern engineering, 1930 April 22, and a letter, 1934 Feb. 2, from Claire Loos requesting material on Loos from Unger on behalf of Dr. Muenz.Series II. Correspondence with J. & L. Lobmeyr, arranged in chronological order, 1931-1956 (folder 4). This series, mostly of letters received prior to 1933, reflects the process of design specification and manufacturing of the Loos glass service. Unger as the representative of Loos, whose health is deteriorating at the time, criticises in a letter of 1932 April 19, the slightly conical shape of the glasses, while Lobmeyr defends it in his reply, 1932 April 23, arguing that an absolutely cylindric form, as envisioned by Loos, would prove to be ugly in glass and hard to sell; with two pricelists, 1932 Nov. 16 and 1956 Dec. 12.Series III. Translation of \"Der Sattlermeister\" (folder 5). An English translation manuscript of the \"Sattlermeister\" story, written by Loos in 1903 and published in his book \"Trotzdem\" (Insbruck, 1931), undated and annotated in an unknown hand.Series IV.

With one copy of each of the original editions, both dedicated to Kurt Unger.\n\nSummary: Letters and love poems, kept private by Beese until her death, chronicling her relationship with Meyer. Includes ca. 74 letters from Meyer and ca. 34 from Beese (some of Beese's letters seem to be originals, suggesting that Meyer returned them to her). The correspondence documents their daily lives, both personal and professional, illuminating their emotions and personalities, their circle of friends (primarily Margret Mengel and Nina Balcerova), and their politics.Some important events are described in detail: Meyer's dismissal from the Bauhaus-Dessau in 1930 for his political views and disputed connections with the German Communist Party; his attempts with Beese to enlist the help of others in his defense, particularly Czech writer Karel Teige (who had taught at Dessau) and Czech architect Bohuslav Fuchs (with whom Beese lived in 1930-1931); and his eventual move to Moscow. This material includes newspaper clippings and typescripts in German and Czech (the Czech sometimes accompanied by Beese's German translations) of articles written by Beese, Teige, Fuchs, and Meyer's students who defended his political views and his right to express them. Meyer's letters at this time also record his opinions and feelings about Bauhaus figures such as Walter Gropius, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Dessau mayor Fritz Hesse. Beese notes her own problems getting a job in Brno, Czechoslovakia, in 1931 and visits by police who questioned her political activities.The birth in 1931 of their son Peter and his welfare is a frequent topic. In letters dated after 1932 when Meyer was in Moscow and traveling in the Soviet Union, he details his work with Soviet architects and planners on building new towns for GIPROGOR and technical schools for GIPROVTUZ. He also discusses his appointment as professor at VASI, the Moscow architecture and building institute. By November 1932, acrimonious letters from Meyer sound the end of the relationship.The majority of the ca. 55 photographs were taken by Beese and are of Meyer or of their son Peter when he was an infant and young child. There are also photos of Beese, Fuchs, and Stam.\n\nSummary: Collection of J.J.P. Oud's architectural designs represented in drawings, photographs, sketchbooks, notebooks, and posters.Series I.

Most of Wright's letters are handwritten, all of Schindler's letters are carbon copies, except for a few handwritten cablegram forms. The collection was part of Schindler's personal papers, and was acquired through his son.The correspondence begins with a letter from Schindler (undated but probably 23 November 1914) asking about the possibility of a position with Wright. It ends in August 1929 with Wright's letters of recommendation for Schindler to present to the architecture licensing board in California. In between, the majority of the letters concern the Imperial Hotel (Teikoku Hoteru) which Wright is working on in Tokyo (1915-1923), and the Barnsdall house group in Los Angeles (1917-1924) which Schindler is supervising for Wright from Chicago and, beginning late in 1920, from Los Angeles.Wright's letters from Tokyo give details about the design and construction of the Imperial Hotel, especially the foundation engineering and the utility systems, and include occasional sketches. He requests boring machines, contracts, the detailed drawings he has asked Schindler to make for the Imperial Hotel and the Barnsdall project, and news. His letters include references to others who are involved in the Imperial Hotel project, especially Aisaku Hayashi (Managing Director of the Imperial Hotel), Baron Okura (Chairman of the Board of the Hotel), the Chicago contractor Paul Mueller, and Wright's draftsmen, Antonin Raymond and Will Smith. Wright also discusses the design of the Barnsdall project and the difficulties raised by the client. Several letters include personal subjects, such as Louis Sullivan, Wright's companion Miriam Noel and their troubled relationship, Wright's mother, his son Lloyd Wright, and his own illness while in Tokyo.Schindler's letters give details of the work he is doing to reconfigure Wright's Oak Park house into separate rental units. He relates news about Lloyd Wright who is in Los Angeles ready to begin construction on the Barnsdall house (called Hollyhock house), and about the difficult Aline Barnsdall. He recommends his friend Richard Neutra to Wright, and alludes to other jobs, including the Shampay house (1919) and his efforts to build a house for himself in Los Angeles (Schindler-Chase house, 1921). A file of eight letters (1922) between Schindler and Wright relate to the design of a house for Mrs. Charles P. Lowes in Eagle Rock, California.The three essays appear to be by Wright. One consists of a four page draft of his autobiography, the others are short, poetic manifestos about art.\n\nSummary: Karl Schneider's papers contain photographs, correspondence, original documents, glass slides and many original drawings. Most of the photographic materials (ca. 850 items) document Schneider's first career in Germany (1921-1938), and the architectural achievements of his contemporaries. There are also a small number of official documents from both Weimar and Nazi Germany. All of the original drawings and sketches (ca. 1000 items) date from after Schneider's immigration to the United States in 1938. About half of these are his designs for consumer products produced by his employer Sears, Roebuck & Co., (1938-1945). The archive, therefore, offers an interesting glimpse into an artist/designer's collaboration with commercial industry, and the mass marketing of modern design through Sears' products.Series I. Personal and professional papers: (1921-1962) contain documents pertaining to Schneider's career, including German exhibitions and publications, and some papers relating to the loss of his professorship during the period of the Third Reich. Documents from his American phase include references, and immigration and licensing papers. There are, however, no personal letters and very few letters in Schneider's hand.Documents from Germany record Schneider's professional affiliations including contracts with the Kunstgewerbeschüle in Hamburg, his suspension from his position in 1933, his students' petitions for his reinstatement, and the termination of his employment by the Nazis. Files contain information about Schneider's publications and an inventory of Schneider's library. Personal documents include his birth certificate, discharge from the army, immigration and divorce papers. Schneider's professional life in the United States is chronicled by a small amount of correspondence, a 1944 contract with Liebl and Schlossman, and recommendations written on his behalf by Walter Gropius, Lewis Mumford, Walter Curt Behrendt and others. To augment the collection ca. 250 photocopied pages of articles and drawings from the Karl-Schneider-Archiv Hamburg, pertain to his early career.Series II. Sketches and drawings: ca. 1,000 sheets of sketches and drawings by Schneider represent his work in America. Included are drawings of Michelangelo's tomb of Julius II in the Medici Chapel done for art historian Edgar Wind, ca. 1942-1944. Other drawings document Schneider's architectural work. Most of the drawings concern Sears, Roebuck & Co. projects such as \"Craftsman\" tools, toys, appliances, furniture, and store designs. The drawings are in pencil, colored pencil, chalk, charcoal and wash.Series III. Photographs and slides: ca. 800 photographic prints and slides document Schneider's architectural designs in Germany and include many of unrealized plans and models. Included are some personal photographs, and a number of photographs of work by Schneider's German, Austrian and American contemporaries, such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Lewis Mumford and Louis Sullivan. There are also images of Schneider's designs for Sears stores (plans, views and site studies) and several photographs showing a Sears store under construction in Mexico City, 1946. There is also an album of photographs of Brunelleschi designs. Many of the photographic images were taken by Ernst Scheel and by Schneider's second wife, Ursula Wolff.Series IV. Glass negatives: ca. 800 glass negatives of the photographs in the collection. Although many of the photographs do not have negatives, most of the negatives in the collection have a corresponding photographic print.\n\nSummary: Detailed letters written to his uncle, Giovanni Maria Selva, and very occasionally to his father, from Rome and Naples (1778 Oct.-1780 May), where he was continuing his architectural training. With additional letters written during journeys to Marseilles (1780 Sept.-Oct.) and northern Europe (1781 May-Dec.) apparently undertaken to look at tools, instruments, manufacturing establishments, and hydraulic engineering projects in connection with the business of the Arsenale in Venice.The travel letters are long and detailed with extensive commentary on sights and sites, especially festivals, harbors, and canals, although comments on strictly architectural matters are rare. References to his friend Antonio Canova and his teacher Temanza appear throughout. It has not been established whether parts of the series have been lost, or whether the breaks in the correspondence represent periods of time spent in Venice. Chronologically arranged.1778 Oct.-Dec.: Three letters from Rome, principally discussing Selva's proposal to the Spanish crown for a funerary monument to Pope Clement XIV; with comments on Roman life and on the printer Volpato.1779 May-Sept.: Four letters from Rome discussing events in Rome, his plans to travel and work in Naples, Sicily and Malta in the company of Cav. Ippolito Pindemonte, and his studies and designs including work on a chantry.1780 Jan.-May: Fifteen letters from Rome and Naples discussing his work, including the opening and decoration of a concert hall in Rome. The six letters from Naples report on festivals, galleries and their collections, ancient buildings, and other sights. With a reference to his friend Giacomo Quarenghi and his work in St. Petersburg.1780 Sept.-Oct.: Five letters, from Terni, Sinigaglia, Bologna, Genoa and Marseilles, with extensive description of the Roman waterworks at Terni; the landscape, paintings and buildings of Bologna, Parma, Aix, and Genoa; and the engineering of the port at Marseilles.1781 May-Dec.: Sixteen long letters from Paris, London, Amsterdam, Brussels, Munich, and Verona. Those from Paris (May and October) describe a military review, the fountains and parks of Versailles and Marly, and manners and events at the court of Louis XVI, and include reference to the work of Abbe Raynauld and to Bartolozzi. The eight letters from London describe various manufactures, machines, instruments and improvements in London, Portsmouth, Manchester, Liverpool and the Potteries with some general comments on British industrialization and comparisons with the situation of Venice. There are discussions of the hospital and observatory at Greenwich; the status and organization of British artists and scientists; techniques of firing ceramics; the development of harbors, canals and bridges; and there is some commentary on Venetian artists, including his purchase of prints after Luca Giordano by Ravenet and the presence of paintings of Canaletto. Letters from Amsterdam, Brussels and Munich (1781 Oct.-Nov.) include description of the Dutch townscapes, a festival in Munich and telescopes and other instruments.\n\nSummary: The collection contains approximately 150 letters and cablegrams between Frank Lloyd Wright and Rudolph Schindler (1914-1929 and undated), with about 12 other items, including a photograph of Wright (ca. 1920), handwritten notes and financial accounts by Schindler, manuscripts of essays, Schindler's telephone book, and specifications for the Imperial Hotel.
