        "text": "Anthropologist Carolyn Smith-Morris will discuss the social, political and legal challenges facing ethnographic and biological researchers working with Native Americans in the second installment of Lawrence University’s three-part 2005-06 Edward F. Mielke Lecture Series in Biomedical Ethics.\n\nSmith-Morris, assistant professor of anthropology at Southern Methodist University, presents “The Ethics of Research in Indian Country: An Anthropological Perspective” Friday, Nov. 11 at 7 p.m. in Lawrence’s Wriston Art Center auditorium. The event is free and open to the public.\n\nA specialist in cross-cultural medical ethics, Smith-Morris will share insights from her nearly 10 years as a researcher among the Pima Indians of Southern Arizona, a tribe better known for high rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes than for its culture and history. Much of her research was conducted during the Pima’s most hostile and unwelcoming years toward outsiders since the Pueblo Revolt of the late 1600s.\n\nThe presentation will focus on methodologies and policies that work best between researchers and tribes amid contemporary tensions — traditional /modern, Indian/Anglo, natural/technological — as well as tribal fears that research data will be misrepresented or used unethically. Smith-Morris also will address the biomedical principle of “individual autonomy” in consent for treatment and for research and how that principle often conflicts with traditional Indian culture mores of strong family, community and other group-based modes of decision-making.\n\nA member of the SMU anthropology department since 2002, Smith-Morris first began working with indigenous peoples with field research among Australian Aborigines of western New South Wales. She earned her bachelor’s degree in anthropology from Emory University and her Ph.D. with an emphasis in medical anthropology from the University of Arizona.\n\nSmith-Morris’ appearance is supported by the Edward F. Mielke Lectureship in Ethics in Medicine, Science and Society. The lectureship was established in 1985 by the Mielke Family Foundation in memory of Dr. Edward F. Mielke, a leading member of the Appleton medical community and the founder of the Appleton Medical Center.\n\nFrancesca Rochberg, a scholar on the history of science, presents “The Astronomies of Ancient Mesopotamia” Monday, Oct. 31 in a Archaeological Institute of America lecture at Lawrence University. The presentation, at 7:30 p.m. in Lawrence’s Wriston Art Center auditorium, is free and open to the public. An informal reception with the speaker will follow the address.\n\nA professor of history at the University of California, Riverside, who focuses on ancient astronomy and astrology, Rochberg will discuss the development of Mesopotamian celestial science in the second millennium B.C. and provide context for its place in relation to Western astronomy traditions.\n\nRochberg was a 1982 recipient of one of the $500,000 MacArthur Foundation “genius grants” and also was awarded a prestigious Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship in 1994. She has written extensively on Babylonian astrology, astronomy, cosmology and is the author of three books, including “Babylonian Horoscopes,” for which she was awarded the John Frederick Lewis Award from the American Philosophical Society in 1999. Her latest book, “The Heavenly Writing: Divination, Horoscopy and Astronomy in Mesopotamian Culture” was published in 2004.\n\nShe earned a bachelor’s degree in Oriental Studies from the University of Pennsylvania and a Ph.D. in Near Eastern Languages from the University of Chicago.\n\nLawrence University has been awarded a $200,000 grant by the National Science Foundation’s Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education program to support an expansion of its growing nanotechnology and nanoscience initiative. Lawrence was one of only 15 institutions nationally to receive the NSF-NUE grant.\n\nThe grant will enable Lawrence to incorporate nanoscience experiments and activities into core geology and environmental science courses during the next two years. This is the second NSF-NUE grant Lawrence has received in the past three years. A $100,000 NSF-NUE grant in 2003 helped launch Lawrence’s nanotechnology and nanoscience program, which began by focusing on interdisciplinary research opportunities in chemistry, physics and biochemistry.\n\nNanotechnology involves the scientific study and use of materials on an unimaginably small scale, including the manipulation of individual atoms. It is widely regarded as having the potential to revolutionize scientific research and science education.\n\n‘Nano’ refers to a nanometer, which is approximately one eighty-thousandth the width of a human hair. Because nanomaterials typically exhibit different characteristics than those in larger forms, they provide unique and innovative applications in areas ranging from medicine and national security to environmental technology and consumer products.\n\n“Lawrence is one of only a few liberal arts colleges in the country that is aggressively incorporating nanoscience into its science curriculum,” said Karen Nordell, associate professor of chemistry and the leader of Lawrence’s nanoscience initiative. “We’re excited about the new opportunities this latest NSF grant will provide, allowing us to expand and strengthen our nanoscience offerings into additional fields.”\n\nBeyond curricular and research activities, the NSF grant will support the purchase of several pieces of sophisticated equipment specifically designed for the study of nanomaterials as well as other laboratory and classroom materials. The grant also will fund the development of several outreach programs, including conferences and workshops for area K-12 teachers and a partnership with the ArtsBridge America program.\n\n“Nanoscience has tremendous potential to attract additional students to science, technology, engineering and mathematics careers,” Nordell said. “Lawrence’s expanded program will enable students and faculty to conduct interdisciplinary research projects not only on our campus but through collaborations with faculty and students at other universities as well. We hope to help raise awareness among undergraduates, middle and high school students and teachers of the many ways that nanoscale science is affecting our daily lives.”\n\nLawrence University musicians will be exceptionally well represented as performers and composers when the 2005 Wisconsin Music Educators Association holds its annual state conference Oct. 26-29 in Madison.\n\nThe award-winning Lawrence University Jazz Ensemble, under the direction of Fred Sturm, will pay tribute to some of Wisconsin’s most notable contributors to jazz with a pair of conference performances entitled “Homage to Wisconsin Jazz Composers” Oct. 26-27 at the Monona Terrace Convention Center. The Lawrence University Wind Ensemble, under the direction of Andrew Mast, will perform Friday, Oct. 28.\n\nThe 19-member Lawrence University Jazz Ensemble will be the conference’s opening day featured performer with a Wednesday evening concert and return to the stage first thing again the next morning for a second show. The two performances will feature 10 pieces each, collectively representing the work of 20 different composers and arrangers from across several important Wisconsin jazz constituencies.\n\nAmong the featured works will be four by retired state jazz education pioneers, including “Lady in Satin” by Oshkosh native and 1957 Lawrence graduate John Harmon, who founded the college’s award-winning jazz studies program in 1971; five by current Wisconsin university jazz educators, including “Nzemo Na Mvula Zamba” by Sturm and “Minor Surgery” arranged by Neenah native Marty Robinson, a 1989 Lawrence graduate now teaching at UW-Oshkosh; three Wisconsin school directors; two state natives who graduated from Wisconsin universities; three writers associated with Wisconsin jazz publishers; and three of Wisconsin’s greatest jazz stars, Woody Herman, the legendary big-band leader from Milwaukee, Lyle Mays of Wausaukee, the renowned keyboardist/composer with the Pat Metheny Group and noted contemporary jazz pianist Geoff Keezer from Eau Claire.\n\n“This is both a great honor and a great opportunity for our students to play at the state conference,” said Sturm, whose collegiate ensembles have been cited by Downbeat magazine as America’s best eight times. “There are some terrific jazz programs in Wisconsin and we all vie for a spot on the annual conference program. We submitted some recordings last May and when I found out they offered us two programs, I could not have been more thrilled. This conference is really a wonderful way to showcase our talented student musicians to jazz educators from around the state.”\n\nCollectively the recipient of two outstanding performance awards by Downbeat magazine as well as numerous other individual awards, the Lawrence University Jazz Ensemble has long been recognized as one of the country’s premier undergraduate jazz bands. It performs and records frequently, presenting cutting edge large ensemble literature, historically significant works, Lawrence student and faculty compositions and arrangements and accompanies visiting jazz solo artists.\n\nMast, in his second year as director of bands at Lawrence, will lead the Lawrence University Wind Ensemble in a four-piece concert at 11 a.m. on Friday Oct 28 at the Monona Terrace. Two of his program’s works will have strong Lawrence ties.\n\nOne piece, “My Robin is to the Greenwood Gone,” was composed by Percy Grainger and arranged by Sturm in honor of long-time Lawrence music professor Fred Schroeder, who was the director of bands at Lawrence from 1951-78.\n\nAnother piece, “Villanelle,” will feature James DeCorsey, Lawrence associate professor of music, on French horn. DeCorsey also wrote the arrangement for the Paul Dukas composition.\n\n“‘Villanelle’ is a terrific piece originally composed as a contest piece for the Paris Conservatory, so it has moments of both beauty and fire,” said Mast, who was director of Bands at St. Ambrose University in Davenport, Iowa, before joining the Lawrence faculty in 2004. “And the 1998 arrangement of ‘My Robin,’ is a gorgeous and loving setting of this piece that happens to have two great Lawrence connections.”\n\nThe 55-member Lawrence University Wind Ensemble is selected from the top wind and percussion students in the Lawrence Conservatory of Music and regularly performs five to seven concerts throughout the academic year, frequently with guest soloists, conductors and composers. Their latest recording, “Air Mosaic” was released in the spring of 2005.\n\nAcclaimed composer and jazz pianist John Harmon is having a milestone birthday on Oct. 25 and Lawrence University is throwing a musical tribute to commemorate the 1957 graduate’s special occasion.\n\nThe 2005 Lawrence Jazz Alumni Showcase Concert will celebrate Harmon’s 70th birthday in style with a program featuring many of his original works performed by a cast of Wisconsin’s most notable jazz performers. The tribute concert, Tuesday, Oct. 25 at 8 p.m. in the Lawrence Memorial Chapel, 510 E. College Ave., Appleton, is free and open to the public.\n\nHarmon, who will perform a “classical” solo during the concert, will be joined on stage by many of his long-time friends and collaborators, among them singer Janet Planet, saxophonist Tom Washatka, trumpeter Bob Levy, guitarist Tom Theabo, trombonist Kurt Dietrich, bassist John Gibson and drummer Mike Hale. Harmon’s wife, Linda, and son, Noah, both pianists, also will perform during the musical celebration.\n\n“John Hamon has literally touched the lives of thousands of artists, students, teachers and loyal fans,” said Fred Sturm, director of jazz studies and improvisational music at Lawrence and a former student of Harmon’s at Lawrence. “How fitting that his Lawrence legacy can be celebrated here where it all began nearly a half century ago.”\n\nHarmon has established himself as one of America’s busiest composers and jazz pianists as well as an exceptional music educator. His extensive body of recordings include a solo piano album of his own compositions (“Rite of Passage”), works for symphony orchestra and wind ensemble, (“Bobby Shew: The Music of John Harmon”) and scorings of his original songs for voice and chamber orchestra (“Strings Attached”). Jazz standards and original compositions are featured on “An Evening of Jazz with the John Harmon Trio” and “More Beautiful than Planned” with Planet.\n\nHis music has been commissioned and performed by the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, “The Orchestra” of Los Angeles, the Fox Valley Symphony, the Santa Fe Chamber Orchestra, The Mirecourt Trio, jazz trumpeter Bobby Shew, Brazilian singer Flora Purim and the Either Orchestra. Harmon also co-founded the critically acclaimed contemporary nonet Matrix in 1974, which has recorded six albums, including 2002’s “Proud Flesh.”\n\nAn Oshkosh native and current Winneconne resident, Harmon has served as composer-in-residence for more than 40 elementary and secondary schools and has held a continuing role as composer-in-residence for the Red Lodge Music Festival in Montana since 1991.\n\nHis musical achievements and educational contributions have been widely recognized and include the Wisconsin Music Educators Association’s Distinguished Service Award in 1999 and the Fox Valley Arts Council’s Renaissance Award in 2000. Harmon also was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts degree last June by Lawrence and he was named a Fellow of the Wisconsin Academy of Science, Arts and Letters in July, 2005.\n\nAfter graduating from Lawrence in 1957 with a bachelor’s degree in music composition, Harmon studied with legendary jazz pianist Oscar Peterson, worked as a pianist and arranger in New York City and fronted a jazz trio that toured Europe in 1963. On his return to the states, he recorded the album “Lost in Sound” with jazz saxophonist Yusef Lateef. He also worked with Belgian composer Henri Pousseur while studying at the State University of New York at Buffalo.\n\nHarmon returned to his alma mater to serve as the first director of Lawrence’s jazz studies program (1971-74).\n\nOne of Wisconsin’s leading advocates for the public disclosure of information on health care quality as a means of improving patient care will examine cost and quality challenges facing doctors and hospitals in the opening address of Lawrence University’s three-part 2005-06 Edward F. Mielke Lecture Series in Biomedical Ethics.\n\nChristopher Queram presents “In Pursuit of Value: The Evolution of Quality-Based Purchasing” Tuesday, Oct. 18 at 7 p.m. in Lawrence’s Wriston Art Center auditorium. The event is free and open to the public.\n\nQueram, who has served as chief executive of the Employer Health Care Alliance Cooperative (The Alliance) in Madison since 1993, recently was named executive director of the Wisconsin Collaborative for Healthcare Quality.\n\nThe collaborative, which includes hospitals, physician groups, employers and labor unions from around the state, focuses on formulating accepted measures of health care quality for doctors and hospitals.\n\nBoth the Menasha-based Affinity regional health care network and the ThedaCare medical delivery network based in Appleton are members of the Wisconsin Collaborative for Healthcare Quality.\n\nQueram will examine current issues confronting the health care industry, including cost, quality, system dysfunction and the lack of informed and “value” conscious purchasers and consumers. He also will discuss the importance of employers creating a clear strategy to deal with spiraling health care costs, review challenges to a value-based purchasing health care model and suggest ways to create incentives for improving health care quality.\n\nActive in numerous health care-related organizations, Queram is a member of the State of Wisconsin’s boards on Health Care Information and Private Employer Health Care and is a former chair of the board of the National Business Coalition on Health as well as a former president of the Wisconsin Business Coalition on Health.\n\nHe served on President Clinton’s Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry, is a current member of the Planning Committee for the National Quality Forum and is a clinical instructor for Programs in Health Management at the University of Wisconsin.\n\nAs CEO of The Alliance, Queram oversees a non-profit cooperative that serves more than 700 corporations in Dane County and southern Wisconsin, representing more than 110,000 individual health-care subscribers.\n\nA hospital executive in Madison and Milwaukee before joining The Alliance, Queram earned a bachelor’s degree in political science and history and a master‘s degree in health management from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nQueram’s appearance is supported by the Edward F. Mielke Lectureship in Ethics in Medicine, Science and Society. The lectureship was established in 1985 by the Mielke Family Foundation in memory of Dr. Edward Mielke, a leading member of the Appleton medical community and the founder of the Appleton Medical Center.\n\nGary Van Berkel, an award-winning researcher at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, discusses the development and applications of mass spectrometry Tuesday, Oct. 18 in a Lawrence University Science Hall Colloquium.\n\nA 1982 Lawrence graduate and Appleton native, Van Berkel presents “What is Mass Spectrometry?” at 11:10 a.m. in Science Hall Room 102. The lecture is free and open to the public.\n\nVan Berkel will provide an overview of the history of mass spectrometry and explain how this important analytical technique is used to identify unknown compounds, quantify known compounds and clarify the structure and chemical properties of molecules. He also will examine some of the practical uses of mass spectrometry, ranging from the detection and identification of steroids in athletes to determining gene damage caused by environmental factors.\n\nA member of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s staff since 1987 and the leader of the lab’s Organic and Biological Mass Spectrometry Group since 2001, Van Berkel was honored in June with the Biemann Medal by the American Society for Mass Spectrometry. The international award recognizes significant achievement in basic or applied mass spectrometry. Van Berkel was cited for his research contributions related to the electrochemical nature of the electrospray ion source.\n\nAfter earning a bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Lawrence, Van Berkel earned a Ph.D. in analytical chemistry from Washington State University.\n\nMedieval art scholar Lawrence Nees will examine the life and cultural contributions of Godescalc, a talented, but largely unknown, 8th-century scribe of King Charlemagne, in a Lawrence University address.\n\nNees, professor of art history at the University of Delaware, presents “The Career of Godescalc, Artist at the Court of Charlemagne,” Thursday, Oct. 20 at 6:30 p.m. in Lawrence’s Wriston Art Center Auditorium. The event is free and open to the public.\n\nNees will trace the works of Godescalc, the “ultimate servant,” during the “cultural flowering” of Charlemagne’s reign. The presentation will focus on Godescalc’s role in the creation of numerous important works of art for Charlemagne and his circle of advisors, especially the “Godescalc Evangeliary,” a set of illuminated gospels commissioned by Charlemagne and his wife, Hildegard.\n\nA specialist in the art of the early Middle Ages, Nees is the author of several books, including “The Gundohinus Gospels; From Justinian to Charlemagne: European Art A.D. 565-787” and “A Tainted Mantle: Hercules and the Classical Tradition at the Carolingian Court and Early Medieval Art 300-1000.” A member of the University of Delaware’s art history department since 1978, Nees earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Chicago and his Ph.D from Harvard University.\n\nNees’ appearance is supported by the William A. Chaney Lectureship, which brings distinguished speakers in the humanities to the Lawrence campus. The lectureship was established in 1999 in honor of Chaney’s retirement as the George McKendree Steele Professor of History. He was the longest serving faculty member at the time of his retirement, having taught at the college for 47 years.\n\nAn address by the president of the American Chemical Society will highlight a seminar celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Northeast Wisconsin section of the ACS Tuesday, Oct. 11 at Lawrence University.\n\nWilliam Carroll presents “The Chemistry Enterprise 2015: Do We Have a Future, or What?” at 6 p.m. in Lawrence’s Science Hall, Room 102.
