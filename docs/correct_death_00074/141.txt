Chet Atkins, a country guitarist who helped steer the careers of some prominent Nashville acts as well as the sound of several rock bands, died Saturday. He was 77.

Atkins began as a fiddler in his home state of Tennessee but quickly switched to guitar before heading out on the road in the 1940s.

By the 1950s, his instrumental songs became a big hit with fans. He eventually recorded about 75 albums, which sold more than 75 million copies.

In 1957, he was put in charge of RCA Nashville, working with stars like Roy Orbison, Charley Pride, Dolly Parton, and Waylon Jennings.

Atkins also played on hundreds of hit records, including Elvis Presley's "Heartbreak Hotel," Hank Williams Sr.'s "Your Cheatin' Heart," and The Everly Brothers' "Wake Up Little Susie."

He also influenced many rock musicians, including George Harrison and Paul McCartney.

Atkins had been ill for several years. He had a brain tumor removed in 1997, and battled colon cancer in the 1970s.

His funeral will be held Tuesday at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, the former home of the Grand Ole Opry.
