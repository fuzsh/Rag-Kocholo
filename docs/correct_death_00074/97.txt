Chet Atkins killed his first squirrel when he was five years old on his great aunt’s back forty. Not long there after he was hunting hogs in the Dugdemona swamps riding horseback with his father, friends and family. He grew up pursuing every game animal or bird that there was a season for in Louisiana. During college at Northwestern in Natchitoches as he earned a degree in Biology and Minor in Wildlife Management, Chet worked in wildlife research and forestry. After college he started a career as a Mud Engineer and has spent the last 13 years working in the oil fields across the country. Now having hunted and fished in five different states his passion for the sport is as strong as ever. While owning land that was homesteaded by his Great-Great Grandfather who grew sugar cane, corn and livestock, Chet now manages it for timber, wildlife and recreation. Chet believes that proper land stewardship, resource management, and long-term goals will sustain a heritage that he can pass down to his five children. In April of 2018 he became a licensed real estate agent by the State of Louisiana. Since then Chet has been learning every aspect of the land business and is currently taking the Certified Land Specialist course through Mossy Oak Properties. Chet specializes in placing families on rural homesteads that they can manage to meet their own goals. His favorite quote from the Oh Brother Where Art Thou is when Delmar was asked what he would do with ‘all that money’, he said “You ain’t no kinda man if ya ain’t got land”. Having a strong faith in Jesus, honest nature, teacher’s heart, and genuine obsession for American dirt, any clients of Chet’s are sure to enjoy dealing with him.
