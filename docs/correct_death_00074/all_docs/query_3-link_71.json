As a guitarist and record producer, Atkins helped change and popularize country music, creating what became known as the Nashville sound.\n\nHe played on hundreds of hit songs, including those of Elvis Presley, and the Everly Brothers. His own albums sold more than 75 million copies.\n\nAs an executive with RCA Records, Atkins helped the careers of such stars as Don Gibson, Dolly Parton, and Waylon Jennings. Here he is in 1988, performing his song, \"Waltz for the Lonely.\" (Playing \"Waltz for the Lonely\" )"
