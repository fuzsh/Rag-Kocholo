        "text": "About 35 years ago I purchased a Gretsch Country Gentleman and worked on a few Chet Atkins Songs. At that time I was in a small time CW band and when it disbanded I married, I sold my equipment (hugh mistake, selling the equipment that is). Now I am near retirement and can't afford a Gretsch, yet. I purchased a Ephipone semi sold that has a good feel. Regardless of the guitar I had, including a Gibson Barney Kessel Special, I was never able to even come close to the sound Chet was able to get out of the 3 base strings. I have seen a few posts in various location with notes about the amplifier he used, non wound large strings for the 3 base strings with light gauge for the other three strings. Also there was some talk about special winding of the pick up coils. However, I have never seen where someone has really nailed the specs that he used to get his characteristic sound for the base strings. Now that I have started playing again, not as easy now that I am 65, does anyone have the complete formula?\n\nMuch thanks!\n\nAbout 35 years ago I purchased a Gretsch Country Gentleman and worked on a few Chet Atkins Songs. At that time I was in a small time CW band and when it disbanded I married, I sold my equipment (hugh mistake, selling the equipment that is).

However, I have never seen where someone has really nailed the specs that he used to get his characteristic sound for the base strings. Now that I have started playing again, not as easy now that I am 65, does anyone have the complete formula?\n\nMuch thanks!\n\nGretsch Filtertrons are important to that sound, or at the very least, a pickup that has greater brilliance than a Gibson style humbucker.\n\nLeaving Chet out of the equation for the moment, I think the amp and recording microphone contributed as much to Chet's recorded sound as the Gent did.\n\nFor several years, I had a 6122-59 guitar and a Peavey Delta Blues with a 15\" JBL speaker. I got pretty close to the general sound of the live performances (until I actually started playing, that is). The muting technique does take some practice (especially on nylon strings).\n\nRegarding bass strings, as far as I know Chet never used anything other than standard wound gauges on his guitars (excluding the Octobass). Paul Yandell has given details of the string gauges used at various times, and they were all standard. I seem to recall he used wound 3rd srings for recording, but plain for live performances. I could be in error on that, it's been a while.\n\nSynchro is right, the Filtertrons are an important part of the sound, they are half the impedance of most other humbuckers and have a much more \"hi-fi\" sound.\n\nGuys thanks for the feedback. I now have some comments and more questions! Regarding sound, I discovered that the thumb pick is much more important than I first realized. Aside from fit, by filling the thickness of the pick area down, I was able to get closer to the sound I was looking for. Making it thinner also slightly reduced the precision needed to get the volume level I was looking for. It looks like I may be able to afford a Gretsch Electromatic. Just looking for some insight regarding how it will compate to the older models that are still very expensive. Also, I see that most of the Gretsch guitars are followed with a part number that usually begins with G followed by a series of numbers and or letters. Within the Electromatic product line are most of there guitars similar in sound but just specifying color, body style, etc?\n\nTHANKS!!!\n\nThe fact that the Epi is semi-solid will definitely make a difference in the sound!\n\nI'm not sure about the thumbpick. Logic suggests it would be vital - but on the album 'Neck and neck', a duet with Mark Knopfler, Knopfler seems to get a similar sound going 'bareback'...\n\nThat said, his tone can be as difficult to reproduce as Chet's!\n\nI've never owned a guitar that made me sound like someone else playing the same guitar. In time i learned to be glad of that.\n\nGood luck!...\n\nEdit - Somebody (j-miked?) above mentioned a nylon string - this would be a good move in terms of practising. A nylon string don't lie... Nothing to hide behind.\n\nNon wound bass strings is very unlikely. They probably meant Flatwounds.\n\nA possibility, at the very least. I use Thomastik flats on most of my guitars and get a good Chet sound. OTOH, my Tennesseean has round wounds and I get a pretty good Chet sound from it, as well. FWIW, I get a pretty good Chet sound from my Guild guitars with mini humbuckers.\n\nThe point here being, you can approach this in several ways. If you are literally tone-chasing Chet, by a G6122-1959 and find a Standel amp. That's as close as you can get to his hardware. Of course he used Music Man amps too, and if I'm not mistaken he'd been known to use a Blackface Fender at times.\n\nTone chasing is frequently a matter of seeking a moving target, because many artists use a variety of gear. I've seen videos of Chet using a Gretsch Country Gent, a Gibson Country Gent, a variety of electric classical guitars and even a Tele. In the early nineties he was known to perform with what was essentially a Gibson copy of a Strat, made especially for him. He had an endorsement deal with Gibson and had to use a Gibson for all public performances, so they made a Gibson-branded Strat copy to facilitate him. I have personally gotten a great Chet sound from a stock Tele.\n\nA lot of the things you want to know about can be found on this link HERE\n\nThat's a link to a page of questions for Paul Yandell, who was Chet's accompanist for 25 years and knew more than anyone except Chet himself about how Chet got his sound. Among the things he goes into are what kind of strings, effects, amps and microphones Chet used. Interestingly, according to Yandell, Chet never used flat wounds - he didn't like the sound of them, said they sounded dead."
