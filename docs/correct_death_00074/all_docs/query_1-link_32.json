        "text": "Upon the announced renovation of the 435,525-square-foot Bank of America building at Fifth and Union Street, the statue of iconic country musician, songwriter and label executive Chet Atkins that sculptor Russell Faxon crafted and that was unveiled under the building in 2000 was not included in the new footprint.\n\nIn a Friday afternoon ceremony at the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum, the venue's most significant, now perpetual role as Music City's real estate footprint wholly evolves − that of a preserver of Nashville and popular music's iconic history -- again was highlighted.\n\nWhile being feted by several Music Row and country music industry icons who loved him -- namely performers Ray Stevens and Steve Wariner among them − Atkins' 800-pound oft-photographed statue of him sitting next to an empty chair where someone else can pose as a collaborating accompanist was revealed in its new home: in the courtyard in front of the hall of fame and museum that occupies space under Municipal Auditorium.\n\n\"My first response was: you don't want Chet? And then absolutely, we can't wait to get him,\" Linda Chambers, who founded the hall of fame and museum with her husband, Joe, said in a May interview with Nashville's NewsChannel 5.\n\nThe statue's preservation and refurbishing process involved the removal of graffiti. This, after a two-decade history as one of Music City's most photographed modern-era landmarks, or a rallying point of sorts for downtown's homeless population via hats and scarves being left on the statue for those without warm clothing to survive winter.\n\n\"Chet is still and always will be 'Mr. Guitar,'\" Dave Pomeroy, bass guitarist and the Nashville Musicians Association president, said at the event.\n\nAfter playing two instrumental selections, Wariner -- whose career as a teenage guitar prodigy began as a backing musician for Dottie West and Bob Luman, leading to Atkins signing him to RCA Records in 1976 -- shared comments from Duane Eddy, another guitarist who fell under Atkins' guidance and mentorship.\n\n\"Chet belongs at [the Musicians Hall of Fame] with musicians who loved and cherished him.\"\n\nA who's who of unmistakable Nashville music makers was mentioned as what Atkins referred to as \"C.G.P. -- Certified Guitar Pickers\" (a title he bestowed upon fingerstyle guitarists he admired) at the event.\n\nContributions by Tommy Emmanuel, Marcel Dadi, Jerry Reed, Wariner and Paul Yandell to country and related genres ultimately created the sonic influence that birthed what Pomeroy referred to as the respect-driven \"Nashville way\" that led to Owen Bradley's work at Decca Records and Atkins at RCA to define what evolved into the lucrative, country-refining and pop music and culture-redefining \"Nashville sound.\"\n\nWhen reflecting on the three-decade excellence of fresh, lush arrangements, slick production techniques and pop music structures, Stevens joked about an interview he once saw Atkins giving to a reporter while seated in RCA's Studio A building on Music Row.\n\n\"What is the Nashville sound, they asked Chet Atkins -- well, he jingled coins in response.\"\n\nFor the past decade, the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum has occupied space on the first floor of 401 Gay S. in downtown Nashville.\n\nAlongside the hall of fame that honors well-known artists and behind-the-scenes session musicians, the 17-year-old organization's museum collection -- largely curated by Joe Chambers -- includes the remaining interior effects of Memphis' American Sound Studio, where Elvis Presley recorded \"Suspicious Minds\" and \"In the Ghetto\"; the stage Jimi Hendrix performed on in Nashville at Printer's Alley club The Jolly Roger; Brian Ahearn's 42-foot-long Enactron Truck semi-trailer mobile recording studio; and other ephemera and instruments chronicling a century of American popular music from all genres."
