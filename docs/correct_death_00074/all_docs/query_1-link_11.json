THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\nLOU WATERS, CNN ANCHOR: Music City is remembering one of its legends, today. Chet Atkins died Saturday, and in Nashville today, hundreds of friends, family and country music fans turned out for his funeral at the Ryman Auditorium.\n\nReporter Melissa Penry from CNN affiliate WKRN is there and joins us now to tell us about it.\n\nMELISSA PENRY, WKRN REPORTER: Well, Lou, when he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, Chet Atkins at the time was the youngest living person to receive such an honor. But what he did for country music far exceeded even that, and today, here the Ryman, everyone from strangers to loved ones gathered to remember the man and the music.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nPENRY (voice-over): Just as Chet Atkins drew people to music, his death drew crowds of the common man here to Nashville.\n\nART HOLMES, FAN: I'm an amateur guitar player, and I don't think anybody that ever picked up a guitar and tried to play wouldn't say that they weren't influenced one way or another by Chet Atkins.\n\nPENRY: Soon, the stars who followed his lead began arriving. For many, as the head of RCA in Nashville, he was the reason they are famous.\n\nCHARLEY PRIDE, SINGER: I'm coming to the funeral of the man who changed my life. I mean, getting me on RCA and the unique situation that he was in when he took my record up to RCA and they signed me.\n\nWAYLON JENNINGS, SINGER: One time, when I first came here, he turned around somebody who was in the studio and was real conservative, you know, and said, I found myself a star. The man did more good for me anything in the world.\n\nRAY STEVENS, COMEDIAN: He helped everybody and not just me. He was such a mentor and a friend to so many people.\n\nPENRY: Inside the mother church of country music, Garrison Keiller eulogized his good friend, and gave insight as to just what the music meant to the man. GARRISON KEILLER, RADIO PERSONALITY: He was just was this puny little shy kid who could make hardly eye contact with people, and the guitar was really the thing that -- really the thing that lifted him up. He -- it really was his lifelong companion.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHET ATKINS, SINGER (singing): No matter how many years go by I still can't say good-bye\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nPENRY: Chet Atkins was 77 years old. He is being buried here this afternoon.\n\nMelissa Penry reporting live in Nashville -- Lou.\n\nWATERS: All right, thanks, Melissa.\n\nTO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS OR USE OUR SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT www.fdch.com"
