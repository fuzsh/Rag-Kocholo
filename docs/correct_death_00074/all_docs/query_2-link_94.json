Jerry D. Tillman\n\nLarry Lenhart\n\nMember\n\nFrom: Ponca City, Oklahoma\n\nposted 30 June 2001 04:34 PM profile I am avid Chet fan and this is certainly sad news. I knew that it was coming soon. July 10th-13th is the Chet Atkins Convention in Nashville-which I have attended for the last 7 years. He is my first guitar hero and my favorite-I have a copy of all of his albums, Cds, books, and even a lifesize cardboard statue of him in my music room. My proudest possession is that I have a Gibson CG that he personally signed for me about 5 years ago when he was still able to attend the convention. As Lenny Breau said so wisely-\"There is only one Chet\". I have said it before on here, he is the most influential electric guitarist of all time. God bless Chet and his family. Harry Hess\n\nMember\n\nFrom: Blue Bell, PA., USA\n\nposted 30 June 2001 04:37 PM profile 3 years ago when Herb Ellis's manager, and my good friend, Terry Holmes, was dieing of cancer, some of us guitar players from around the country were each sending him $100 or so a month to help him out since he was broke.\n\nChet didn't really know Terry but heard of his plight and dashed a check for $500 off to him. Terry and all of his friends were very appreciative and developed a new respect for Chet.\n\nGood bless him and may he rest in peace.\n\nRegards,\n\nHH\n\nC Dixon\n\nMember\n\nFrom: Duluth, GA USA\n\nposted 30 June 2001 04:41 PM profile This is very sad news. Indeed. My sincere condolences to the family. Chet was to the guitar what Vladimir Horiwitz was to the piano. There will NEVER be another. EVER!\n\nMay he rest in peace.

He may have been quiet, but he said a lot. My best friend and production partner (Randy Hauser)was Chet's drummer for almost 14 years and so I had occassion to see Chet often. When Randy passed away (at 43-years old), Chet did so much for the family. He also bent over backwards to enable us to rent a building he owned on the Row.\n\nA great man who gave us so much.\n\nMike\n\nJody Sanders\n\nMember\n\nFrom: Magnolia,Texas\n\nposted 30 June 2001 05:07 PM profile An era has ended. There is no one that can fill his shoes. Such a great player and such a great person. He took time one day to put a little nobody like me on to some great thumb picks at a little store in Nashville. Rest in peace Chet. I'll see you later. Jody. Jack Stoner\n\nSysop\n\nFrom: Inverness, Florida\n\nposted 30 June 2001 05:13 PM profile Chet was my hero. I'm saddened by his passing, although I knew he has been in bad health recently.\n\nWhen I was picking lead guitar, I did a lot of Chet style picking and had a Gretsch Chet Atkins guitar (a 1961 PX6120).\n\nThe upcoming Chet Atkins guitar festival (show or whatever it is called) will not be the same this year with the master gone.\n\nRick Garrett\n\nMember\n\nFrom: Tyler, Texas\n\nposted 30 June 2001 05:25 PM profile Gone but will never be forgotten.

It was a damn shame that it only got a few responses. I would have never been a picker, if it hadn't been for Chet. Was my Hero along with Curly Chalker. This reminds me to make the most of what time have left.\n\nMike\n\nThat is a shock to me about Randy Hauser.

He was surely one of my icons and heros since I was a young teen. I also had a Chet Atkins Country Gentleman which I acquired in 1968, and foolishly let go only a few years later for a much more inferior guitar. o the folly of youth.\n\nThe loss of the magnitude of his very special presence will be felt as a void never to be filled..\n\nSo long, Chet... and thanks for sharing your gifts with us so generously.\n\n------------------\n\nBill Fulbright\n\nICQ# 2251620\n\n1998 Sierra U12 7x5; '74 Schecter Strat; Gibson ES-165; Peavey Classic 50-410, Line 6 POD 2.2\n\nAustin A.

Weldon did an outstanding job on this project as did the other session players. Thanks Chet for featuring the session guys. That album with Weldon truly influenced me.He WILL be missed. Bob Carlson\n\nMember\n\nFrom: Surprise AZ.\n\nposted 30 June 2001 07:40 PM profile If It had not been for Chet I would have been satisfied to just play rhythm, but he inspired me to learn to play lead which In turn made learning to play the steel much easier.\n\nMore people In County Music know the name Chet than any other. You don't have to put the Atkins on there.\n\nBob Carlson\n\nGary Walker\n\nMember\n\nFrom: Morro Bay, CA\n\nposted 30 June 2001 07:54 PM profile John Floyd is in the same camp that I am. Chet was my first hero in the fifties and then along came Curly Chalker and the both of them dominated my music interest for many years. When Curly left us, it was a truly sad day for me and now another sad day for a giant man in my heart. We have their music but there is no more of it coming now that their instruments have gone silent. CA & CC, I miss you both, thanks, Gary Jerry Bruner\n\nMember\n\nFrom: Albany, NY\n\nposted 30 June 2001 08:18 PM profile Technically, Janice (the Busgal) is correct when she thinks this should be moved over to the MUSIC folder........ after all he wasn't a steeler. However, his impact on country music is not to be ignored (even his de-countrification of the music in the late 50's) and I am sure a lot of steelers (simply because they are country musicians and fans) feel this loss deeply. Maybe this topic will eventually be moved after the shock wears off but I think that's really the moderator's call.\n\nChet WILL be missed.\n\nGary Walker\n\nMember\n\nFrom: Morro Bay, CA\n\nposted 30 June 2001 10:49 PM profile Chet indeed tried his hand at the steel but never for the public. I talked to him once and he was cleaning his finger nails with a finger pick and I asked him if he dabbled with the steel and he said he had, case closed, Gary Bobby Lee\n\nSysop\n\nFrom: Cloverdale, North California, USA\n\nposted 30 June 2001 11:33 PM profile I'm very saddened to hear of Chet's passing. He will always be one of my personal heroes.\n\nI saw him a few years ago here in Santa Rosa, playing for a packed house at our local concert hall. I remember thinking that he put more music into two measures than you hear in whole songs on the radio. He was a true artist, in every sense of the word.\n\nIn the future, when people search for a post about Chet Atkins, they probably won't expect to find it in the area about \"Steel Players and their Music\". I'm moving this topic to the Music forum where it rightfully belongs.\n\n------------------\n\nBobby Lee - email: quasar@b0b.com - gigs - CDs\n\nSierra Session 12 (E9), Williams 400X (E9, D6), Sierra Olympic 12 (F Diatonic)\n\nSierra Laptop 8 (D13), Fender Stringmaster (E13, A6)\n\nRick Barber\n\nMember\n\nFrom: Morgan Hill, Calif. USA\n\nposted 30 June 2001 11:48 PM profile I would like to express my sincere condolences to Chet's family. Chet was why I ever picked up a guitar.\n\nI recently posted a picture of me and my pedal steel on his website www.misterguitar.com . I'm very proud to be there.\n\nIn the early 90's I took my entire family to go see Chet Atkins and Leo Kottke at the Circle Star Theatre in San Carlos California. I am so pleased that my wife and boys got to hear Chet play in person.\n\nMy all time favorite was to hear him play Yankee Doodle and Dixie together at the same time.\n\nI was sitting hear in tears too just thinking about how important he was to me , and I will forever be his fan.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRick Barber\n\nMorgan Hill , Calif.\n\nBill Hankey\n\nMember\n\nFrom: Pittsfield, MA, USA\n\nposted 01 July 2001 04:54 AM profile\n\nChet granted me a personal interview at Stanley Park, in Westfield, Ma. in 1985. I was a reporter for THE COUNTRY MUSIC RECORD NEWSPAPER. I have a rare taped copy of Chet giving me information about a steel guitarist who had no arms. He possessed knowledge of the entire music world. I did the interview as a cover story for C.M.R., and I have several copies, which I have kept for posterity. When Chet reached over and adjusted my recorder, and angled the mike, I quickly realized that his great abilities were not limited to the guitar. He was a gentleman in every sense of the word.

I like many others had the opportunity of knowing him as well as recording with him on RCA many years ago. It is a time in my life when things like this strike close to home.\n\nSometimes we take things for granted like everything will remain the same but the older I get,,,the more I realize there comes\n\nsad times such as the loss of Chet,,,its like losing a member of the family,,because to most,,,he was \"family\" my prayers are with\n\nhis family,,may God Bless a great human being\n\nI know he will,,,,he deserved the best,,because ...He was and \"still\" is the best. Our mutual friend Roy Horton is grieving as well,,Roy was a good friend of Chets and a past president of the CMA.\n\nRest in Peace Chet & I pray that I have the honor of sitting next to you again someday.\n\nGod Bless you....\n\n[This message was edited by Jody Carver on 01 July 2001 at 07:35 AM.]\n\nLonnie Portwood\n\nMember\n\nFrom: Jacksonville, fl. USA\n\nposted 02 July 2001 07:57 PM profile I first heard Chet play while sitting on the front porch of a rural farm house in georgia, listening to the Opry. From that day as a nine year old boy, my life has never been the same. His music seared into my brain and my heart and I decided that I HAD TO LEARN TO PLAY LIKE THAT! He was my greatest influence and in my opinion, the greatest over-all musician of the 20th century. God rest his soul and give him peace. Thanks Chet, I hope you can wear your father's hat, now. One of your thousands of devoted admirers. Lonnie Portwood"
