Music, of course, is a holiday in one crucial sense: a holiday from the mind. Bernard Levin, 1981: 4\n\nTourism has boomed in recent decades and a key component has been the rise of cultural tourism. Music tourism is one part of that and one that has hitherto never been documented in comprehensive form. This book seeks to do just that, and provide a global perspective on this rapidly evolving phenomenon across all continents and musical genres. Twenty years ago, such a book might not have been possible; even a decade ago it might only have discussed Graceland, Elvis Presley’s mansion in Memphis. In this century, the proliferation of musical events and tourist sites obliges such a book. The combination of music and tourism is on the whole a pleasant one and tracing that relationship has meant journeys of our own to such places as Graceland, and the tiny Australian country town of Parkes, for the annual Elvis Presley Revival Festival. In between we have visited Liverpool, Vienna, Takarazuka, obscure graveyards and dusty opera houses, the Bob Marley Museum in Jamaica, travelled part of Route 66 and escaped on virtual journeys with Herb Alpert, Ry Cooder and a host of others. We have not always travelled alone, in any sense, and many people have helped us along the way. These include Ali Wright who was there at the beginning and end of the journeys, provided invaluable assistance in the ﬁeld, advice on early drafts and support at home; and so many others who provided tea – or something stronger – and sympathy (or envy), data or advice on obscure references and destinations, notably Arun Saldanha, Karen Buchan, David Keeling, Sara Cohen, Maya Kneafsey, Linda Malam, Kelly Atkinson (in Parkes), Kathryn Maiden (at Abbey Road), Neil Flenley (Liverpool), Sachiko Yokota, Sonjah Niaah-Stanley (in vii\n\nviii\n\nMusic and Tourism\n\nKingston), Wendy Shaw (in New Orleans), Rob Freestone (in Branson), Natascha Klocker (Salzburg), Daniel Robinson, Deb Davidson and Michelle Bonamy. At various points in the text we have referred to websites which were current at the time of writing. Some of these may now no longer exist. We are particularly grateful to those who sifted through the text and reminded us that we were ignorant of certain genres and regions, were cavalierly anglophone, needed to get out more and, simultaneously, read more. We should also be thankful to our universities who never really questioned why we needed to go to festivals or wanted petty cash to purchase CDs, but no doubt the bean-counters, who now constitute university administrations, will welcome one more publication to tick off on some government checklist. We are indebted to Mike Grover for his enthusiasm for this book and for accommodating our ever-changing delivery date. We are particularly grateful, as so often we have been, to Robert Aldrich for his extraordinarily thorough reading of the ﬁrst draft. The remaining ﬂaws must be ours, but it is hard to believe that he could have missed them!

It is a now familiar story that tourism experienced spectacular growth in the second half of the 20th century, initially in more afﬂuent Western nations and more recently in the emerging countries of the developing world, notably in Asia (Hall, 1998; Williams, 1998). As tourist numbers increased, and tourism became a regular phenomenon, the quest for new sites, sights and experiences grew more complex, while travellers sought, at least on occasion, speciﬁc forms of tourism that met their personal needs. In part this was a response to, and rejection of, the mass tourism that had transformed areas like the western Mediterranean coast. Niche tourism became increasingly signiﬁcant. This book seeks to discuss one such niche – music tourism, where people travel, at least in some part, because of music – and the signiﬁcance of this for culture, economics and identity. The rise of niche tourism has coincided with, and is part of, the growing signiﬁcance of culture in the construction of tourism and recreation. The combination of the emerging ‘heritage industry’ alongside nostalgia, one nurturing the other, has resulted in the increased commodiﬁcation of culture and attempts to preserve the historical fabric of city centres, archaeological sites and even old industries. Early forms of niche tourism were those that focused on history, whether of buildings or landscapes, and that enabled the survival of many stately homes in Britain or castles on the continent, alongside the expansion of national parks and wilderness areas on an almost global scale. Ecotourism is one niche that has achieved more than mere minority signiﬁcance. Over time, niches became less general and more focused. Literary tourism took visitors to places like the Lake District, where Beatrix Potter had produced the tales of Peter Rabbit and where Wordsworth had eulogised on daffodils (Squire, 1988, 1993), to the moors of Haworth in west Yorkshire made famous by the Brontë sisters (Drabble, 1979) or Marcel Proust’s Cambray. Somewhat later a number of ﬁlms and television series 1\n\n2\n\nMusic and Tourism\n\nattracted tourists to such regions as north Yorkshire, where one part of the county became James Herriot country and another was Heartbeat country (Tooke & Baker, 1996; Mordue, 1999), and in North America where ﬁlm locations, including The Bridges of Madison County, gained new visitors (Riley et al., 1998), or New Zealand where the ﬁlming of Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings brought tourist development to several places. Other niches have followed, including art, crime, religion, sport (Priestley, 1995; Standeven & de Knop, 1999; Hinch & Higham, 2001), food and wine (Charters & Ali-Knight, 2002; Hall et al., 2000; Hjalager & Richards, 2002; Long, 2004; du Pont de Bie, 2004), battleﬁelds (Lloyd, 1998), book towns (Seaton, 1999) and, at least for a handful of individuals, even more esoteric quests, such as Anthony Bourdain’s A Cook’s Tour: In Search of the Perfect Meal (2001) or especially those that were spelled out graphically in Decca Aikenhead’s book The Promised Land: Travels in Search of the Perfect E (2001) – a global quest for enlightenment through ecstasy. In different ways music has also become a new niche, or a series of niches, within cultural tourism. Music tourists have often been individuals, from Bernard Levin taking himself on a Conducted Tour (1981) through a dozen classical music festivals, to Henry Shukman’s Travels with my Trombone: A Caribbean Journey (1993) and the American guitarist Banning Eyre’s In Griot Time (2000), recording his seven months of ‘total immersion’ in Malian music. Others too have taken their musical instruments on tour. Some have been deliberately journalistic as in Mick Brown’s American Heartbeat (1993), subtitled Travels from Woodstock to San Jose by Song Title, which came with a cassette or a CD. Robert Craft (2000) travelled in search of any manifestation of Stravinsky, while Jason Webster (2002) placed himself within Spanish ﬂamenco. Most have been nostalgic, like Randy McNutt’s ‘journey to the crossroads of rock ’n’ roll’ (2002), those small American recording centres that preceded the metropolitan studios of the conglomerates. The Scottish author Duncan McLean’s book, subtitled On the Trail of Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys, evokes this spirit: I’m three thousand miles from home . . . I’m not from these parts. I’ve come a long way in search of real live western swing. I won’t ﬁnd real live Bob Wills that’s for sure: he’s been dead twenty years. But his spirit lives on; I know it, I feel it. It lives on . . . somewhere. Not in the battered ﬁddle case in the museum upstairs [Memphis] . . . . And now I am after something. I don’t know exactly what it is, and I don’t know exactly where I’m going to ﬁnd it. But somewhere out there, further south and further west – out amongst the country dance halls, the ranch to market roads, the old musicians hunched over tin-tack pianos and tenor banjos – somewhere in the wide, sun-struck wilds of Texas, that’s where I’m going to track down the spirit of Bob Wills. That’s where I’m going. (McLean, 1997: 3) 2\n\n3\n\nTourism and Music\n\n1111 2 3 4 5 611 7 8 9 1011 1 2 3111 4 5 6 7 8 9 20111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 30111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 40111 1 2 3 441111\n\nOnly a handful of such tours, and inevitably the most idiosyncratic, have been transformed into text. More frequently, music tourism has been somewhat prosaic. Tourism is simultaneously a social, economic, cultural, environmental and political phenomenon. It transfers capital between people and places, inﬂuences the social organisation of destinations, enables the revitalisation, preservation and also the destruction of cultural phenomena, and creates new landscapes. It results in the intervention of local and national governments, and private individuals, in each of these contexts, not least in the promotion of particular destinations. Each of these themes, with the partial exception of environmental impact, are as crucial to music tourism as they are to other kinds of tourism, and all will be examined here. Indeed since no other book discusses music tourism, it is intended to be as comprehensive as possible. This chapter provides a historical background to music tourism, with particular reference to the better-documented European context and to classical traditions. The following chapter looks at the manner in which music created virtual tourism, before recreational travel had become a common activity. Chapter 3 provides an overview of the diverse contexts of music tourism in a range of global locations, and sets the scene for the three following chapters which centre on the economics of this particular niche, the signiﬁcance of music tourism for personal and place identities and the very different experiences of travel, from hedonism to pilgrimage. The penultimate chapter examines festivals, whose themes encompass all those discussed previously.\n\nFrom the Grand Tour to Niches Travel has always existed but tourism is relatively new. Annual mass movements of people from their homes is a recent phenomenon that got underway in the 19th century in relatively industrialised countries. It dramatically burgeoned in the second half of the next century with the simultaneous rise of afﬂuence, the greater provision of leisure time (including paid holidays) and technological changes in transport. Until the Renaissance relatively few travelled for pleasure, despite trade fairs and pilgrimages, and not many travelled far, but in the 17th century the Grand Tour brought the start of tourism to Europe. The gradual achievement of law and order in Western Europe, and the emergence of an elite group of statesmen, merchants and scholars ‘began to legitimize the gallants’ jaunts which thus imperceptibly merged into the educative and educational institution known as the Grand Tour’ (Fairburn, 1951: 118). By the middle of the 18th century it had become fashionable for such elites, and especially those from Britain, to travel in continental Europe in the search for education and recreation. A few 3\n\n4\n\nMusic and Tourism\n\ndecades later the Tour increasingly focused on the pursuit of pleasure and many inveighed against its supposedly corrupting inﬂuence. This was the ﬁrst of many phases of tourism, perhaps tourist cycles, where the high ideals of the earliest travellers were seen to have degenerated into mere hedonism. An intriguing element of the Grand Tour was its somewhat conventional and regular form – again a precedent for what was much later to follow – where time periods (preferably three years) and particular itineraries (which usually involved a long stay in Paris, almost a year in the major cities of Italy and a return by way of Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands) were prescribed. It was primarily intended to ensure the greatest exposure to the sites of antiquity and the cultural achievements of western continental Europe, which the rest of the world seemingly lacked. The parallel development of spas, again principally in Western Europe, brought a new phase in tourism, focusing on the physical beneﬁts to be gained from particular forms of escapism. By the end of the 18th century England alone had more than a hundred spas, a measure of the way that ‘taking the waters’ had attracted growing numbers of the middle classes. By the 19th century they were evident even in such remote colonies as the French Paciﬁc territory of New Caledonia, while the emergence of hill stations virtually throughout the tropics further emphasised the apparent curative properties of tourism and recreation in appropriate places. The health beneﬁts of tourism, ﬁrst open to the elites, were eventually extended to the working classes, notably following the construction of railways in the 19th century, bringing the growth of seaside resorts throughout the western world. Seaside resorts and sea bathing gradually replaced the spas. At the core of the Grand Tour had been the notion of high culture: the inculcation of knowledge, partly through self-education, in the centres of civilisation. While the Grand Tour emphasised the literary, archaeological, architectural and artistic culture of Europe, music often played a relatively small part, whether by attending concerts and recitals or the acquiring new musical skills. Instrumental music was not particularly popular, though opera, especially in Italy, was a key part of the Tour (Black, 1992: 252–260). Only in relatively rare cases, such as that of Vincent and Mary Novello, was music the central focus of travel; their journeys, from London to Salzburg in 1829, were very much a precursor of contemporary specialised tours. They left a detailed record in diary form of a series of concerts in theatres, churches and town squares for several parts of Western Europe (Hughes, 1955). Just 12 years after the Novellos’ travels, the ﬁrst Thomas Cook’s tour took place, inaugurating a quite different form of tourist experience. By the time that tourism had incorporated spas, the focus had shifted from education to recreation. Recreation and residence in the spas were 4\n\n5\n\nTourism and Music\n\n1111 2 3 4 5 611 7 8 9 1011 1 2 3111 4 5 6 7 8 9 20111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 30111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 40111 1 2 3 441111\n\noften accompanied by music and the seaside resorts, modelled on the spas, were furnished with promenades and rotundas, and supported musical concerts and even lectures (Figure 1.1). The rise of seaside resorts, in England at least, was a result of the Napoleonic wars that had brought the Grand Tour to an end by discouraging overseas travel. Moreover the resultant presence of many military camps on the south coast directly provided music to the nearby resorts as, apparently, their ‘brass bands captivated the ladies with stirring martial music’ (Robinson, 1976: 11). The larger resorts developed more complex musical cultures. By the late 19th century in Brighton, the beach had become a noisy place: There was the town band playing a little west of the Bedford Hotel; there was a French string band off Regency Square and there were other bands of nigger [sic] minstrels shouting their wish to be in Dixie . . . . There is a squealing, squalling, screaming, shouting, singing, bawling, howling, whistling, tin-trumpeting, and every luxury of noise. Two or three bands work away; niggers clatter their bones; a conjuror throws his heels in the air; several harps strum merrily different strains. (Gilbert, 1954: 184–186) No doubt Brighton also had organ grinders and their monkeys, as on the main streets of the largest cities. The heyday of music in the spas and ‘watering places’ was between 1880 and 1950, an era captured in one elegant attempt to record in literary form ‘some of the echoes of the dead-and-gone music of the spas and seaside places before they ﬁnally fade into a harmonic empyrean beyond living memory’ (Young, 1968: 12). Music accompanied recreation and tourism in a variety of guises, including the rise of brass bands, the diffusion of organs (and monkeys) and black minstrels, which pointed to the mobility of the performers, between countries and continents.\n\nFigure 1.1 Scarborough bandstand, July 1919 5\n\n6\n\nMusic and Tourism\n\nIn continental Europe the situation was similar, as music accompanied tourism. Visitors to the great cities during the 19th century sampled theatres, ballets and concerts of various kinds, and military bands entertained passers-by in the gardens of cities such as Vienna. Many cities had opera houses and other venues. As with troubadours in the Middle Ages, travelling players provided the working class with more ‘fringe’ entertainment. Thus in Italy, bagpipe players from Romagna and the kingdom of Naples entered Rome in companies in the late 19th century, their hymns ﬁlling the city, especially at festival times. In Australia, Aboriginal gum-leaf orchestras (where tree leaves are the main instrument, blown across in the style of a ﬂute reed) were formed on mission settlements, touring rural and coastal towns with their cheap, everpresent instruments (Dunbar-Hall & Gibson, 2004). In the cities of Japan, the travelling No dancers were exotic attractions. Throughout the 19th century such entertainments were primarily for the residents, and the musicians rather than the bulk of urban residents were the most mobile. Only exceptionally was a distinctive form of tourism shaped by music. Thus in Bayreuth, in southern Germany, the birthplace and home of the composer Richard Wagner, performances of the Wagner Ring Cycle of operas, in the theatre built by King Ludwig of Bavaria, brought tourists from great distances. Indeed, since the sacred drama Parsifal could only be performed in Bayreuth, those who wished to hear it were forced to travel. A late 19th-century guide described the situation: When the festival takes place, admirers of Wagner ﬂock from all parts of Europe to hear it. The festival generally lasts for about a month . . . . During the intervals [in Parsifal] the whole audience leaves the theatre . . . those who wish to do so can take tea or dinner in the well-managed restaurants close at hand or walk up and down on the terrace in the woods that surround the theatre, watching the sunset glow on the sweet landscape of the Bavarian hills. Anything more unlike the ordinary surroundings of a theatre can hardly be imagined. The summons to return to the theatre is given by a group of trumpeters. (Loftie, 1890: 117–118) A handful of other places, such as Vienna and Salzburg, similarly beneﬁted from the fame of their composers, symphony orchestras and opera companies, but they were rare exceptions, primarily meeting the needs of a European elite. Seaside resorts dominated the tourist landscapes of the Western world until the middle of the 20th century, when a series of changes transformed the structure and content of tourism. The post-war era, after the hiatus of the war itself and the Great Depression, brought longer holidays (often paid for by employers), increasing afﬂuence, a rise in car ownership and, from the 1960s, the possibility of relatively cheap air transport. ‘I’m 6\n\n7\n\nTourism and Music\n\n1111 2 3 4 5 611 7 8 9 1011 1 2 3111 4 5 6 7 8 9 20111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 30111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 40111 1 2 3 441111\n\nleaving on a jet plane/Don’t know when I’ll be back again’ were not merely the words of a song but the symbol of the emerging tourist industry, and of ‘drifter’ or backpacker tourism. These changes contributed to larger numbers of people becoming tourists, and tourists taking longer and longer holiday breaks, thus enabling travel to more distant places, and eventually the emergence of ‘second holidays’ within one year (that might take a different, more specialised form than the ﬁrst). The rapid expansion of tourism also emphasised the shift from the residual high culture of the Grand Tour, though never entirely to disappear, to the more evident populist recreational forms established in the late 19th century. Meanwhile some popular 19th century destinations, such as the Isle of Man, had long since lost their importance, as tourists sought the greater excitement and warmer climate of more distant places. Before the end of the 20th century, tourism had become the world’s largest international industry. One key effect of the rise of tourist numbers and democratisation of the tourist experience was the emergence of mass-produced holiday accommodation: in England, the Butlin’s camps of the post-war decades, and the more global Club Med. The resultant ‘package’ tourism was characterised by large numbers of people travelling to seemingly massproduced resorts in a small number of destinations (characterised, to many, by the rise of tourism in the Costa del Sol, Spain, or in Florida). For many people this marked the ﬁrst experience of overseas travel, as through the 1960s and 1970s the cost of an overseas vacation remained much the same while wages rose. A second effect was greater institutional participation in tourism, from the rise of travel agencies to attempts by governments to regulate, control and boost tourism, as it became a signiﬁcant economic phenomenon. A third was the massive expansion of tourist literature and especially the explosion of tourism guides that gradually focused on specialist activities, and moved away from an emphasis on the landscape, whether natural or constructed, towards a range of recreational possibilities. These increasingly emphasised means of reducing the costs of travel (‘Europe on $10 a Day’, ‘Asia on a Shoestring’ etc.) and became more comprehensive as competition increased. Greater afﬂuence and time, more frequent holidays (and leisure time generally) and the increased versatility and ﬂexibility provided by cars and planes – alongside a growing reaction against mass tourism – brought the rise of more distinctive forms of tourism, some focused around particular forms of recreation such as mountaineering, golf or even sex and, increasingly, others that focused on various facets of culture, such as architecture, literature, photography or art. Over time such niches also produced institutional interest, with travel agencies organising speciﬁc tours and governments seeking to maximise the attractions of particular places, usually through emphasising heritage features, to capture the expanding market. Music became an element of this. 7\n\n8\n\nMusic and Tourism\n\nThe expansion of leisure interests, and a growing signiﬁcance of heritage and nostalgia, was accompanied by the rapid expansion in numbers of museums and festivals. Moreover, museums no longer looked towards antiquity, ethnography and ‘high’ culture for their justiﬁcation, but happily embraced the very recent past and popular themes. Similarly, festivals, once largely classical, diversiﬁed. In Europe the number of museums grew dramatically in the last quarter of the 20th century, as specialist museums (in Amsterdam, from sex to cannabis) were established. Specialist music museums, for particular composers, genres or even instruments, and heritage centres were part of this trend. Festivals grew from mere local to global events, producing acute competition for custom. As the example of Brighton showed, music was probably ubiquitously a part of the tourist experience but as an adjunct to it rather than a rationale for it. One guide for retired travellers has emphasised this idea: We were steadily discovering that there are many agreeable aspects of Saga holidays that we had not expected. One is that these holidays often include an evening of folk music of the area concerned. In Andalucia it had naturally been ﬂamenco. In Portuguese Lagos the entertainment took the form of song and dance by an enthusiastic and well-drilled troupe of juvenile dancers and musicians. (Smith, 1995: 145) Music was increasingly seen to be a part of travel experiences: A must-do in Lisbon is fado, the uniquely Portuguese tradition of putting poetry to music. We chose Parrereinha de Alfama, a small but good fado restaurant in a back street in the Alfama district. The restaurant was full with diners, many of them locals – always a good sign. The food was excellent and the haunting fado singing, to a 12string pear-shaped guitar, was sometimes soulful, sometimes happy. (Potts, 2003) But over time travel in search of music, in various guises, became a central component rather than merely an adjunct of travel, however enthusiastically received, at least for an emerging niche group. At the same time, even the most seemingly unpropitious places, such as the small northern English industrial town of Rochdale, have advertised the diverse musical pleasures that are available. In a brochure widely distributed in the North of England in 2002, Rochdale was advertising: January provides a further chance to enjoy all the fun of the pantomime season with Cinderella and Middleton’s Amateur Operatic and Dramatic Society’s annual pantomime. Rochdale plays host to the Symphony Orchestra from Chetham’s world famous music school and international artists the Polmar Ambache trio who have performed in over 33 countries. 8\n\n9\n\nTourism and Music\n\n1111 2 3 4 5 611 7 8 9 1011 1 2 3111 4 5 6 7 8 9 20111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 30111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 40111 1 2 3 441111\n\nElsewhere, the brochure directed possible visitors to afternoon tea dances, sequence ballroom and line dancing, tap and salsa dancing, and the visits of the Bill Bailey Big 6 Jazz Band, the Heritage Singers and the Blue Magnolia Jazz Orchestra (Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council, 2001). In this array of contemporary possibilities there was no hint however that Rochdale had once been the home of the famous music hall singer Gracie Fields. Music tourism, whether associated with classical or popular music, or linked to visits to places of performance (such as opera houses), places of musical composition, places enshrined in lyrics (from the Mull of Kintyre to Dixie), places of births and deaths (including such cemeteries as Père Lachaise in Paris) or museums, grew in signiﬁcance in the last decades of the 20th century. It has shaped distinct patterns of recreation and tourism, transformed some places, become a valuable source of income generation, and reshaped memories and identities of music and musicians.\n\nA Musical Niche? As Bayreuth illustrates, the ﬁrst musical tourism was associated with classical music. A few other places associated with classical music were similarly important in the 19th century as part of the legacy of the Grand Tour. New mobility in the 20th century usually increased their prominence, as at Salzburg: It started with ‘Everyman’ and Mozart, and today includes everything from Bach to Richard Strauss. Mozart may have been the original excuse for being festive, but the dynamic forces which Salzburg’s Renaissance and baroque tradition still contains made a much bigger and much greater thing of it . . . . What draws the thousands from all parts of the world, half of whom know nothing about music, nothing about Goethe and nothing at all about the traditions of the place? . . . All Salzburg is a stage. (Czernin, 1937: 86) In nearby Vienna, the same sort of tourism, oriented around occasional festivals and the ﬁnest European performers and orchestras, had a similar impact on the city, although the appreciation of music could be combined with other forms of recreation, as Newth found: The more select of the Danube-strand baths are above the city . . . but one of the most popular is the Gansehaufel, the municipal bathing beach on an island in the old Danube. This is one of the sights of the city even if you are not anxious to bathe . . . . Great stretches of sand are the background for a kaleidoscopic scene of brilliant bathing costumes and pyjamas, worn by hundreds of bathers of all ages and shapes, who lie in the sun . . . sleeping, talking, reading or playing 9\n\n10\n\nMusic and Tourism\n\nthe gramophone. After their day in the sun plenty of people seem to have energy enough for the Wurstelprater, for Sunday evening is the busiest time of all in this big funfair at the foot of the great wheel. And if the crowd and din become too tiring they can walk in the great gardens and avenues. (1931: 166) Despite such possible diversions, Music is still the most important thing in life for the true Viennese, as you may see and hear for yourself at any time and anywhere, from the Opera to the Heurigen. The Opera . . . is open all the year round . . . . Equally renowned is the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, which plays always to crowded audiences in the two big halls, the Musikverein and the Konzerthaus. And on any summer evening you may sit under the trees of the Burggaten and listen to the Symphony Orchestra playing in the most perfect setting . . . Church music you will hear in the Cathedral and the larger churches. The lighter music for which Vienna is hardly less well-known persists in her characteristic light opera, which is sought more than ever today by London, New York and the other capitals of the world. And Viennese dance music, which for years we thought we could do without, has swept back with an even greater charm . . . it is the Viennese waltz that always ﬁlls the ﬂoor, danced with the same sweeping, swirling grace as in its imperial heyday. (Newth, 1931: 166–167) Vienna too was both the birthplace and deathplace of several of the world’s greatest composers, and the homes and graves of many, some close together in the Simmering cemetery, were already places for tourists to visit. Outside such few notable places music tourism scarcely existed. Evident in Newth’s account of the musical attractions of Vienna was an implicit hierarchy of musical attractions: one that placed the high culture of opera and symphony above that of ‘light music’ and dance. Indeed, this corresponded with the structure of tourism, while it remained primarily an elite phenomenon, although Newth was at pains to point out that, at least in Vienna, symphonies in the parks appealed ‘not only to those who have come for the concert but to the policemen and waiters and parkkeepers’ (1931: 167). Other musical attractions that Vienna might have offered, and there was certainly folk music and jazz, seemed not worth mentioning. The exclusion and marginalisation of folk music and jazz were evident elsewhere. Even more obviously, risqué venues such as the Moulin Rouge or the Folies Bergères in Paris, although they drew tourists from Europe and America long before the end of the 19th century, were likely to be given short shrift in most guidebooks. But then, as travellers like the English writer Arnold Bennett discovered, their musical attractions were often their secondary role (Bennett, 1913). At much the same time one 10\n\n11\n\nTourism and Music\n\n1111 2 3 4 5 611 7 8 9 1011 1 2 3111 4 5 6 7 8 9 20111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 30111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 40111 1 2 3 441111\n\nof the attractions of the opera season in Bayreuth was, for some, its elitism and exclusivity: The painted, over-dressed women whose object it apparently is to attract as much attention to themselves as possible, and who frequently talk, even at concerts, all through the performance, are conspicuous by their absence at Bayreuth. Their smartness and their jewels would not be seen in the blessed darkness there . . . the absence of everything that is noisy, irritating, vulgar and disturbing prepares the mind to receive the full impression which the play is capable of producing. (Loftie, 1890: 118) The opera could not thus be seen as mere recreation and entertainment; it contributed to demarcating society. Other examples of opposition to particular forms of entertainment, and their links to social status, were rarely subtle. After the Second World War the author of one guide to the Western Isles of Scotland, exasperated with ‘pretty crude’ Gaelic folk singing and ‘uncritical, undiscerning’ audiences, wrote: Performer and audience are fully satisﬁed with the naive standards of the homely ceilidh . . . . This primitive screeching and caterwauling may be all right round the peatﬁre of a winter’s evening; but one must surely take exception to it being transferred, remuneratively to the cities, there to be accorded professional status. Indeed, he concluded with evident relief that ‘though this institution survives in the remoter parts, it is gradually being superceded in the more accessible, where alternative forms of entertainment are available. The picture house and the dance-hall are now preferred to the ceilidh’ (MacGregor, 1949: 211). Similar attitudes to jazz, especially in the interwar years, and, rather later, to pop music were widespread, although rarely found their way into guidebooks. Potential invasions of the ‘wrong’ sort of music intermittently invoked middle-class moral panics. As guidebooks, until the 1970s at least, largely focused on the buildings and landscapes of destinations, rather than their social possibilities, they also focused on the more impressive opera houses and symphony concert halls and rarely mentioned the smaller places where jazz, folk music and other forms of popular music were performed. Tourists were not expected to be interested. High culture was expected to prevail. Nevertheless, long before different genres of music had stimulated tourism, even if classical music remained dominant, in some part because tourism remained a more middle-class phenomenon. In the mid-19th century brass band competitions in Britain took bands and their supporters, much like contemporary sports teams, to distant places; these supporters were some of the earliest travelling music enthusiasts (see Chapter 6). By the 1920s, Paris hosted numerous clubs and theatres 11\n\n12\n\nMusic and Tourism\n\ndrawing tourists from America and many parts of Europe, and featuring jazz, musicals, dance halls and a variety of cabaret shows; the Charleston dance craze swept through Paris after a post-war explosion of appreciation for African-American music, particularly jazz, to the extent that Parisian nightspots imported African-American musicians, notably Josephine Baker (Levenstein, 1998: 243–244; Simeone, 2000). New York (notably at Harlem’s Cotton Club), New Orleans, Berlin and a handful of other great cities echoed such trends. In hundreds of other tourist destinations, such as the British seaside resorts, dancing was an eagerly anticipated summer pleasure, and piers and promenades reverberated to the sounds of orchestras and bands (Walton, 2000: 105–107). Music was no mere middle-class attraction. Music tourism thus ﬁrst emerged in terms of classical music, most evidently in the guidebooks that trumpeted the charms of architecture and the classics, but as the legacy of the Grand Tour faded and tourism became more widespread, new forms appeared. For many decades, however, it remained virtual rather than real, in the sense that actual tourism abroad for music was a mere fraction of the imaginary tourism undertaken in private homes when ‘exotic’ musical styles were imported into the West (Chapter 2). Yet in the last decades of the 20th century the rise of a new phase of popular music, the revival of folk music and the continued importance of classical music, alongside intensiﬁed afﬂuence and mobility, and new nostalgia among the ‘baby boom’ generation, brought the considerable expansion and diversiﬁcation of music tourism. Most crucially tourism extended from the elite high culture of earlier years to a massive range of opportunities and possibilities. Music tourism no longer ﬁlled only one signiﬁcant niche, but encompassed many genres and forms.\n\nMusic and the Construction of Meaning The rise of music tourism took music from being simply an expected, or occasionally quite unexpected, adjunct of a holiday to a central role. As tourism has become organised around different music genres, the diversity of relationships between place and music became evident. From an initial focus almost entirely on places of performance, as in 19th-century Bayreuth and Vienna, tourism has extended to include cemeteries and birthplaces, places of music creation and production, such as the extraordinary Opera House in Manaus (Brazil) or La Scala (Milan), and places identiﬁed in lyrics, such as the restaurant in Rio de Janeiro from which ‘The Girl from Ipanema’ emerged. Most recently it has involved museums, including that of La Scala (Rossi, 1995: 321–331), the House of Fado in Lisbon, the extraordinary Siegfried’s Mechanisches Musikkabinet in Rudesheim, Germany – a collection of over 300 mechanical musical 12\n\n13\n\nTourism and Music\n\n1111 2 3 4 5 611 7 8 9 1011 1 2 3111 4 5 6 7 8 9 20111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 30111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 40111 1 2 3 441111\n\ninstruments – and the Cité de la Musique in Paris, a myriad of festivals and such constructed places of ‘tribute’ as Dollywood in Tennessee. In some respects this is remarkable since music is, strictly speaking, invisible, and often ephemeral, and the essence of tourism – the ‘tourist gaze’ – has only the most tenuous connection with music. That music remains, and is frequently advertised as, an adjunct of tourism suggests at least that there is also a ‘tourist ear’, and that certain countries, including Ireland, Iceland and Austria (Chapter 3), and places such as Memphis and Tamworth stress the merits of their own regional music as one reason for tourism. Many tourist brochures and websites advertise musical attractions, from buskers to operas, festivals to bars, and local distinctiveness to the heights of international excellence. In East Asia do-it-yourself music, in the form of karaoke, is an anticipated and advertised component of many holidays. Airlines too have seen a possible role for music in tourism: Air Paciﬁc invariably plays the haunting Fijian song, Isa Lei, on departure from Fiji to remind tourists to return, Qantas has made much of Peter Allen’s ‘I Still Call Australia Home’, while in 2002 the Indian domestic airline Air Sahara, decided to liven up evening domestic ﬂights by featuring post-dinner entertainment in the form of strolling musicians playing violins or guitars. Music tourism is much more than mere observation and the ‘tourist ear’, however signiﬁcant this may be, as it takes on a new diversity of possibilities, involves more people and destinations, and results in new forms of expenditure. Growth has gone alongside with promotion, both privately and publicly, and in particular places, such as Graceland (Memphis), has conserved, but also substantially transformed landscapes. Like other forms of cultural tourism, such as art tourism and most kinds of heritage tourism, music tourism can be short-lived. Cultural goods are rapidly consumed and smaller cultural centres rarely attract visitors for long. Even festivals last for no more than a few days. However, the proliferation of festivals in recent years is indicative of the promotion of events that may keep visitors in place for more than a day, or at least overnight (see Chapter 7). Nonetheless, although the cultural resources of cities were in many cases perceived as purely local amenities and not part of a wider tourism resource base, the arts are now considered to have a considerable economic importance and even smaller towns, such as Rochdale, have touted their cultural attractions widely because of their potential economic importance, the positive image that this provides, but sometimes also because they have little else to offer. Cultural tourism has enabled the revitalisation of declining city centres or industrial towns, and in many British and other towns, cultural and arts districts have been deliberately planned to stimulate tourism and create more vibrant city centres. 13\n\n14\n\nMusic and Tourism\n\nIn a number of places the rise of music tourism reveals ways in which localities have attempted to confront structural economic changes, as old industrial hearths decline and service economies take their place, or are engineered to take their place. Music tourism may constitute one component of strategies within local economies to generate new kinds of economic growth. Moreover, music tourism generates questions about how music can actively shape places, both in a discursive sense, through representations and stereotypes of places, and materially, through altering the built infrastructure of cities and towns. The role of music in social constructions of place varies substantially from place to place, from sites that have deep histories of musical expression and production, where tourism strategies build on an existing spatial and cultural discourse (for example, in New Orleans), to others where musical connections are to various extents ‘invented’ – for example at Tamworth, Australia or Branson, Missouri – as part of wider strategies to reinvigorate local economies or foster local cultural distinctiveness. Despite the inherent aesthetic musical and contextual differences between, for example, Graceland (Memphis) or Abbey Road studios (London), travellers searching for Jim Morrison’s grave in Paris or Jacques Brel’s in the Marquesas, and tourists enjoying classical music in Vienna, trying the tango in Buenos Aires or raving in Goa, each of these share certain functions in tourist economies and generate similar (yet still diverse) meanings in cultural spheres. Music tourism has become a distinct component of the new cultural tourism and has been generally seen as an area of substantial future expansion (Quinn, 1996; Sellars & Wilson-Youlden, 1996). The cultural industries – music, literature, ﬁlm, art – relate to tourism in various ways, appropriating myths of place, transforming localities materially and discursively, thus supporting tourist development. Music is both a key cultural industry, and a text through which places are known and represented (Smith, 1994; Kong, 1995; Leyshon et al., 1995, 1998; Halfacree & Kitchen, 1996), providing a new source of images and sounds for tourism promotion. Music remains a powerful presence in global mediascapes, in both the images and associations with place captured in lyrics, in connections between artists, bands or whole ‘scenes’ and certain places (hence the ‘Seattle sound’, the links between both soul and techno music and Detroit, or between the band REM and Athens, Georgia). Such associations, combined with music’s powerful, emotive role in acts of consumption, create patterns of demand that translate into new local cultural economies, as discourses of ‘authenticity’ and ‘distinctiveness’ are mobilised across markets at a variety of scales, and become means of transforming places. As with any other form of economic development, music-related tourism involves complex social integrations (and disintegrations), appropriations of cultural resources, 14\n\n15\n\nTourism and Music\n\n1111 2 3 4 5 611 7 8 9 1011 1 2 3111 4 5 6 7 8 9 20111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 30111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 40111 1 2 3 441111\n\npolitical negotiations, and sometimes conﬂicts with local populations and institutions. As this book indicates, the diversity of music tourism is considerable, from an examination of the aesthetics of opera house design to youthful dusk to dawn beach parties on tropical islands. Music tourists are similarly varied, although nostalgia is a part of many travels. Vast numbers of studies have examined tourist motivations. Reasons that were once simply summarised as ‘wanderlust’ and ‘sunlust’ have become fragmented and diverse to include physical, cultural, social and spiritual motivations, some of which have been combined into social-psychological models of motivation, that link both avoidance (of the humdrum and mundane) and search for the sublime (Hall, 1998: 62–68). Most studies of the rationale for tourism have been at a national or regional level and have less frequently focused on niche tourists. Almost never have such studies been conducted on music tourists. Hall (1998: 269) has argued that ‘special-interest tourists’ may be characterised by the search for novel, authentic and quality experiences, but this says little more than that niche tourists are perhaps less likely to seek the more obviously hedonistic pleasures of mass tourists. Similarly, Derrett argues that ‘special interest tourists demonstrate a desire for authenticity and real experiences that offer them active identiﬁcation with host communities in a non-exploitative manner’ (2001: 3), but that presupposes the existence of a ‘host community’ that may be absent in some forms of music tourism. Music tourism, like other elements of cultural tourism, might be thought simply to link nostalgia with some concern for heritage and authenticity. Cultural tourism, of which music is a part, has been perceived as ‘the pursuit of a social taste-forming minority elite’ undertaken by ‘cosmopolitans’ who adopt ‘an intellectual and aesthetic stance of openness towards divergent experiences from different national cultures’ (Urry, 1994: 92). Yet that description, largely oriented at art tourists, privileges the elite status of certain elements of music tourism and ignores its diversity. As festivals have become increasingly signiﬁcant, music tourists, even in the limited sense of festival goers, are quite varied and have little to do with Urry’s deﬁnition. Moreover, there may be little, if anything, in common between a visitor to Mozart’s grave in Vienna, an audience member in a blues festival in rural Australia and a participant in a month-long drumming course in West Africa, other than a common interest in some kind of music. Music tourism cannot exist apart from other elements of tourism; most tourists seek experiences of landscape, all eat and drink, choose particular modes of transport and accommodation, and shape their experiences and itineraries according to factors – such as ﬁnancial status and time available – that are apart from the music. 15\n\n16\n\nMusic and Tourism\n\nIt is thus difﬁcult to deﬁne music tourism. As will become obvious throughout this book, there is no typical music tourist. Given the range of experiences and participants, and the ability of individuals to move between them, music tourists cannot easily be deﬁned and classiﬁed. Music tourism constitutes a cluster of possible tourists, activities, locations, attractions, workers and events which utilise musical resources for tourist purposes. Music tourism sites exist within a set of networks of transport and tourist infrastructures, social relations, business linkages and cultural practices which support certain activities and economies. It can be seen as a range of practices where sites of music production and expression (whether in past or present ‘scenes’) become the points of attraction for tourists, and may also become central to strategies employed by the local state, tourist promotion boards and companies to market musical heritage and a musical environment. Crucially, music tourism, in addition to its economic role, is also an act of consumption that involves complex rituals, and suggests the powerful emotive role of music in contemporary societies. Music tourism is clearly a discretionary activity, and fashion plays a part in every component of cultural tourism – hence music tourism may be a transitory phenomenon as have been other forms of cultural tourism. Ashworth argues that The cultural tourist, growing annually in experience and adventurousness, can exercise an increasingly fanciful, arbitrary and ﬁckle choice from a fast expanding array of attractions. The established classics of the Western cultural canon whether in music, theatre, ﬁne arts or architecture and urban design have been increasingly supplemented by an ever-widening range of cultural experiences. (1995: 275) Music tourism both ﬁts this description and adds to it. It is highly likely that the tourism cycle, where consumer choices may change quite rapidly, and lead to the decline in the attraction of a particular destination or phenomenon (Butler, 1980), will calibrate the ever-changing nature of musical fashions. Notions of elitism and privilege tend to imbue a large part of the discussion of cultural tourism. Many such discussions (e.g. Richards, 1996) exhibit a conspicuous lack of reference to music, and where music is ﬂeetingly mentioned, it is classical music. Similarly, national attempts to promote cultural tourism, as in the United Kingdom (Foley, 1996), exclude pop and rock concerts (and usually also sporting events). This book naturally neither excludes music, but rather sees it as a central component of music tourism, nor engages in attempts to distinguish a ‘high’ culture of classical music from a ‘low’ culture of popular music. All forms of music play some part in cultural tourism. 16\n\n17\n\nTourism and Music\n\n1111 2 3 4 5 611 7 8 9 1011 1 2 3111 4 5 6 7 8 9 20111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 30111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 40111 1 2 3 441111\n\nSeemingly central to much of music tourism (other than festivals), as to many other components of cultural tourism, is its retrospective nature – the search for experiences that replicate those of the past or at least provide reminders of them – a form of ‘nostalgia consumption’ (Dann, 1994). This in turn has stimulated a heritage industry within music tourism that has fed on nostalgia by reifying cultural experiences of the past, either in festivals, museums or other contemporary creations. Music has gone from an adjunct of tourism, and a pleasant background, albeit often an important one, to a central element of much tourism, at least for a minority. That minority, often seeking both recreation and nostalgia, have produced a largely new series of niches within the tourist industry, that have had substantial cultural and economic signiﬁcance in a range of places, from Kingston, Jamaica to Reykjavik, Iceland or Tanna, Vanuatu. Music tourism is often about fun and escape, but it also goes beyond the trivial, as this book hopes to illustrate, through connections to complex cultural issues – of authenticity, essentialism and heritage – and economic factors, including investment, employment creation and conditions, and the stimulus to regional and national economies. It is reﬂective of other forms of cultural tourism (like literature and ﬁlm tourism), and is unique, not least in its reliance on the aural as well as visual. This book sets out to explore how music tourism is an important, if neglected, component of cultural tourism, and how it is a particular practice in itself, with its own histories, sites, economic trends and social practices. The next chapter discusses the various ways in which musical recordings pre-ﬁgured the emergence of tourism, acting as a symbolic ﬁeld where places and peoples were represented (in sound, and in the iconography of promotional artwork, album covers etc.). Music has enabled ‘virtual tourism’, which partly informs and explains the emergence of actual music tourism.\n\n17\n\nChapter 2\n\nVirtual Tourism\n\nIn every era demand for tourism has exceeded supply. Recreation time has rarely been enough for most people, and capital constraints have always hindered travel and tourism. This was particularly true in the 19th century, when leisure time was scarce, paid holidays were rare and the cost of reaching even nearby places was considerable. Few travelled far. Distant places were destinations for a few well-off tourists though they ﬁgured in the dreams of many. Over time such distant places became accessible in alternative ways, through photographs, paintings and eventually through music. Such representations were as much reﬂections of the gaze of European travellers as in any sense accurate depictions of other places. By the mid-19th century audiences in Western Europe were being entertained through presentations of paintings and sketches, accompanied by appropriate music, from particular places: some of the ﬁrst forms of virtual tourism. This chapter traces some of the ways through which music preceded and eventually accompanied tourism itself. In the 1860s, the wonders of Ireland were shown in various British cities and towns, through displays of, as the associated booklet described, ‘colossal paintings, executed in the highest style of art’ and accompanied with ‘Vocal and Instrumental Music, introducing the Choicest Irish Melodies, executed by Talented Artists’. Such melodies were mainly sentimental songs such as ‘Norah, the Pride of Kildare’, ‘Coleraine Whiskey’ and ‘Kathleen Mavourneen’. The booklet touted press opinions of the travelling diorama, including one typical observation that There are few entertainments in which the visitor can so proﬁtably spend two hours, in which so much interesting information may be learned, so many pleasurable sensations excited, or old associations revived, than in witnessing the beautiful scenery or listening to the melodies of old Ireland than that which has been provided in the Rotundo. (Corry, 1866) Such travelling shows took urban populations away, however brieﬂy, to destinations more exotic and colourful than their own homes. They 18\n\n19\n\nVirtual Tourism\n\n1111 2 3 4 5 611 7 8 9 1011 1 2 3111 4 5 6 7 8 9 20111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 30111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 40111 1 2 3 441111\n\nforeshadowed late 20th century commercial slide shows for potential tourists to even more distant places.\n\nHula Sounds While there was a history of fascination with distant places in the earliest operas, one of the most exotic of virtual destinations was Hawaii, largely a fabled group of islands to other than a very select few, and where links between music and tourism became evident early on. Moreover, while dioramas such as those that evoked the splendours of Ireland largely used music to create a background and amosphere – indeed a sentimental mood that would capture the interest and nostalgia of the many Irish migrants who had ﬂed rural Ireland during the famine years of the 1840s – in Hawaii the seemingly exotic nature of music and dance was at least as signiﬁcant in creating an image of a very different tourist landscape. Whereas Ireland was relatively familiar, Hawaii was very much the ‘other’ to distant Western populations, and dance and music were central to tourism, but especially to virtual tourism. Within the United States, and beyond, the sounds of Hawaiian music, from steel and slack guitars to ukeleles, alongside Polynesian words and phrasing, gave the music a languid distinctiveness that was relatively easy to link to tourism. Distinctiveness and romanticism were further enhanced through such songs as ‘Aloha Oe’ (1878) written by the last Hawaiian queen, Liliuokalani. A largely temperate continental United States seemed so different. Tourism began in Hawaii in the 19th century, largely based around its natural landscapes, and linked to writings by Robert Louis Stevenson, Mark Twain and others. Hawaiian performers had appeared in the United States long before the end of the century, and by the 1910s tourism had become linked to music and dance. Hula girls began to appear in advertising and by the 1920s they were commonplace in tourist promotions as Hawaiian culture became ‘commodiﬁed and enacted through dance shows as a way of authenticating the destination image’ (Desmond, 1999: 6). Hawaii thus became an early site of cultural tourism. Stereoscopic photographs took late 19th century Hawaii to a wider world, a vision further developed by postcards in the next century. One postcard from that era of a bare-breasted young woman in a grass skirt posed in front of Diamond Head was captioned: ‘Dancing is one of the favorite amusements of the people, and the hula hula is the national dance. It is a love dance and with it goes a sad and doleful music on gourds, tom-toms, ﬂutes, guitars or ukeleles’ (quoted in Desmond, 1999: 42). Dances once banned or frowned on by missionaries as lascivious were being revived for tourist consumption, one of the earliest examples of such revivalism. Music and dance took Hawaii to a wider world and restructured its image towards that of exotic tourist destination. 19\n\n20\n\nMusic and Tourism\n\nDistant Places Outside Hawaii few other places were so cherished in song, although places of outmigration stimulated waves of nostalgic songs, and returning colonists composed and sung songs of distant empires. In certain places particular songs became iconic; Sieczynski’s ‘Vienna, City of My Dreams’ (1914) was a big hit and a symbol of the city, especially at it became central to the repertoire of the Austrian born tenor, Richard Tauber. Kreisler’s ‘Viennese Caprice’ also enhanced the inter-war charms of Vienna. Elsewhere in Europe the songs of Maurice Chevalier captivated global audiences and extolled the pleasures of Paris. In the Depression years, urban delights were still triumphed, including a variety of songs describing New York, and countered the harshness of poverty and unemployment; ‘Lullaby of Broadway’ and similar songs offered aural escapes at a time when few could even dream of travel. Just as the Irish dioramas had come at a time when emigration from Ireland was considerable, hence art and music reminded people of the places they had lost, so much of the popular music of the ﬁrst half of the 20th century, whether folk or blues, was inspired by the places that migrants had left (‘way down upon the Swanee river’, ‘carry me back to old Virginny’ or ‘in my old Kentucky home’) and offered nostalgic images of homelands: places to be encountered in dreams and memories, perhaps one day to be revisited but as tourists rather than returning residents. The arrival of the gramophone in the late 19th century, and the radio in the 1920s, allowed many to listen to music of their choice. Music’s role in nostalgia and place construction was already evident.\n\nAmbient Music: Domestic Dreaming The post-war years brought new versions of virtual tourism. As tourism grew rapidly so too did virtual tourism, and music played a critical role. In the 1930s specialist music programmes, soon to be known as ‘muzak’, were created with the intent of transmitting music into factories and homes to combat boredom. Rather than be given speciﬁc titles, or identiﬁed with particular composers, the music was linked to its intended purpose, the spaces where they were intended to be broadcast or with which they were intended to be associated: Natural landscapes, the ﬂight of migratory birds, sunsets, rippling shores, orphans running through war-torn streets, a Tokyo massage parlor, cattle roaming through vast ﬁelds, lovers ogling on a beach, big city lights, Saturday afternoon at the rodeo, international travel – the inﬁnite tableaux of set designs with their attendant tunes boggle the mind. (Lanza, 1994: 62) 20\n\n21\n\nVirtual Tourism\n\n1111 2 3 4 5 611 7 8 9 1011 1 2 3111 4 5 6 7 8 9 20111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 30111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 40111 1 2 3 441111\n\nMuzak increasingly invaded open spaces, shopping malls, lifts and telephones to give places and contexts particular identities and, hopefully, remove mundane cares. Music became an emotional and commercial tool. From the 1950s the recorded music industry, which had a distant relationship to muzak and pre-programmed music in general, began to adopt the rhetoric, if not the format, of these types of music. Whereas a long standing assumption had not surprisingly been that consumers bought recordings to actively listen to them, many records were released that were speciﬁcally designed to create particular home environments: ‘music as wallpaper’ played in the background to add a mood, create a particular atmosphere, or convey the sounds of exotic, otherworldly places that consumers might dream of visiting. The liner notes to various albums indicated the uses to which recorded music could be put (Music for Dining, Music for Dancing . . .). Many albums from the 1960s attempted to ‘capture’ the sounds of far away places, vicariously transporting the armchair listener to idyllic holiday destinations, mysterious Paciﬁc Islands, Alpine heights and cosmopolitan European streetscapes (Figure 2.1). In Love in Paris by the Musette of Renaud and Carlini’s World of Strings (both undated), re-created the archetypal romantic French encounter: ‘Montmartre, the Champs Elysee [sic], The Seine – all speak of the romance of Paris. Here is a musical journey to Paris by night . . . Renaud with the World of Strings is your passport to Paris’. Other records emphasised the almost symbiotic relationship between music and tourism; from the 1960s too, the liner notes to Percy Faith and His Orchestra’s Bon Voyage! Continental Souvenirs made obvious links: Coming home from Europe the American traveler brings a good a many things, as much as the weight allowance or the stateroom will handle. French perfume, Italian leather, British brushes, Swedish glass, Belgian lace, German carvings – all these and many more ﬁnd their way back to the States. And a lot of it winds up in the attic. Not so the lovely lively melodies that have lately poured forth from the Continent however. These linger on, as good songs do, to become unforgettable, and fragrantly evocative souvenirs of the Grand Tour. In this enchanting collection, Percy Faith applies his suave touch to a dozen continental songs, largely from France and Italy, giving them such glowing colors that they take on a nostalgic patina even to those who have never been abroad. (Anon., 1959) Such was the essence of virtual tourism, at a time when travel was prohibitively expensive for most people (hence, no doubt, the reference to stateroom here). Meanwhile, Mantovani’s Continental Encores (Anon., 1959) took the format of the ‘musical journey’ to its extreme. The record’s packaging 21\n\n22\n\nMusic and Tourism\n\nFigure 2.1 European cities were commonly depicted on LPs released in the 1950s and 1960s as they became desired destinations, principally for Americans (but also for Canadians, Australians and New Zealanders) with newfound capacity to travel. Paris, most often depicted on ‘easy listening’ records, was usually associated with themes of romance, sophistication and history. Images of Paris in recorded form (and in cover art) served to act as place marketing for actual tourism, while LPs were themselves souvenirs.\n\nincluded a ten-page photo album of various European locations: a map of Paris, shots of cafés, Spanish churches, Venetian gondolas at sunset, folk dancers and bikini-clad bathers on Mediterranean shores: For a long time now entertainers have known about the power of music to evoke atmosphere. The circus and the fairground have always used their own special brands of cheerful melody, which are 22\n\n23\n\nVirtual Tourism\n\n1111 2 3 4 5 611 7 8 9 1011 1 2 3111 4 5 6 7 8 9 20111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 30111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 40111 1 2 3 441111\n\nas much a part of those entertainments as the exuberant, closely packed type on their posters. With sound track and disc recording far advanced in technique it is possible now to use this power of association over an ever wider range, and moreover to bring it into our own home. To put it another way, it can now be employed to take you out of your home, and lead you gently by the ear to familiar or imagined places. And so with all the tunes in this album Mantovani produces a sort of heightened impression of the places he takes us to in his music . . . a musical ﬂip round the continent takes in Italy, France, Switzerland and Germany, each one a natural home of easy, spontaneous melody . . . . Coupled with the photographs in this great Mantovani album, this is as vivid and comfortable a journey in sound as anyone could possibly devise. (Anon., 1959) The liner notes for Martin Denny’s Afrodesia (1959) observed: Once again Mr Denny stimulates the jaded palate of everyday civilization with music that is pure escape . . . . We become armchair travellers with our magic carpet, our hi-ﬁ (or stereo) equipment and this album. We see and feel the searing veldt . . . the moody reaches of the jungle . . . a tribal initiation fete and sheer encompassing beauty. (Quoted in Leydon, 1999: 53) Stanley Black and His Orchestra’s Place Pigalle emphasised these ideas in a particularly essentialised view of Paris, appealing to an AngloAmerican fascination with European cosmopolitanism, and the fears of the outside world that often accompanied overseas travel: Why go to all the bother of getting a passport, travelling on boats, trains and planes, buying sea-sick tablets, worrying about the customs, bothering your head by complicated sums with francs and pounds involved. Why not just put on this wonderful record and let Stanley Black take you on a conducted musical tour. This most reliable of guides who has already taken us to South America, the tropics, and the South Sea Islands with the utmost safety, will ﬁnd no difﬁculty in such a short ﬂip as Paris. Sure enough, the moment you put this record on the turntable you only need to close your eyes and there you are strolling along the banks of the Seine being shocked by the postcards – the price that is, or nibbling at your croissant accompanied by a French coffee at a table on the sidewalk as the sun rises over Paris, dodging the rush of French taxis . . . wandering in the Place Pigalle in the lamplight . . . . (Anon., 1958) The liner notes to Place Pigalle speculated on the reasons why music evokes place: 23\n\n24\n\nMusic and Tourism\n\nEven if you have never been nearer to Paris in your life than the stony shores of Folkestone, you can quite easily imagine you have been there simply by listening to the music. There seems to be some extra sense, not yet explained by the scientists, that connects every place in the world with its representative themes. (Anon., 1958) Evocative song titles, in the music of Martin Denny alone, ranged from general concepts of exotic places (‘Exotica’, ‘Return to Paradise’), speciﬁc distant places (‘Hong Kong Blues’, ‘On a Little Street in Singapore’, ‘Bangkok Cockﬁght’), fauna and ﬂora (‘Lotus Land’, ‘Bamboo Lullaby’), vague mysticism (‘Jungle Drums’, ‘Vovdoo [sic] Dreams’) and islands and seas (‘Island of Dreams’, ‘Beyond the Reef’, ‘The Enchanted Sea’) that linked nature and mystery with exotic perceptions of otherness (Hosokawa, 1999a: 88). At a time when mass tourism was only getting under way, such recordings, some incorporating local bird sounds, became a feature of Western suburban homes, alongside other creature comforts, which were just beginning to include stereo music systems. Despite the increasing diversity of virtual destinations, Hawaii never lost its prominence. Arthur Lyman was the most prominent of those who brought Hawaiian music into lounge rooms. The cover design and notes to Sam Kailuha and the Islanders’ Destination Honolulu (Figure 2.2) were typical of a series of albums that were created to advertise new Pan Am airline routes (including those to Rome, Paris, London, Vienna, Berlin and Barcelona) and so emphasised the links between tourism, place and music: The eight islands of the archipelago now make up the 50th state in the Union, but Hawaii has lost none of its Polynesian charm. Alebrown hula girls in grass skirts still sway to the strains of ‘Sweet Leilani’ and the air is forever fragrant with hibiscus and frangipani. The sky is as blue as the sea lapping against the sandy shores of Waikiki and the secluded coves of the outer islands . . . . Out here where the thermometer hugs 70-odd degrees summer and winter there is no peak season. Any day of the week is the occasion for a bit of revelry, and no-one should miss the famous ‘luau’, traditional feast of Hawaii . . . . Once deserted except for a few grass shacks, Kalakaua is now the swingingest street in the Paciﬁc. Here are the Gold Coast skyscrapers and hotels of Waikiki, gourmet restaurants and shops selling everything from aloha shirts to Oriental art treasures . . . . Getting around Hawaii is a simple affair, as there is a variety of ﬂights to the outer islands. Honolulu is itself less than ﬁve hours by Pan Am Jet Clipper from the West Coast of the United States. Just short of taking a trip or a lesson in the hula, nothing captures the sultry beauty of the islands as does the music of Hawaii. Using the steel guitar, ukelele and the drum, Sam Kailuha and the 24\n\n25\n\nVirtual Tourism\n\n1111 2 3 4 5 611 7 8 9 1011 1 2 3111 4 5 6 7 8 9 20111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 30111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 40111 1 2 3 441111\n\nFigure 2.2 Sam Kailuha’s LP, released to promote Pan Am’s route to Hawaii, was one of a number in a series dedicated to new destinations opened up by improving air transport. It mobilised images of Hawaii already etched in the global imagination through earlier phases of musical distribution: of beach-side paradises, palm trees and romantic sunsets.\n\nIslanders carry the listener off to Waikiki, where girls in bikinis do the hula and brawny surfers ride the ‘soup’. What distinguished this record was that it had been sponsored by Pan Am, in a deliberate strategy of releasing albums to coincide with the development of new airline routes, and the marketing of the new destinations. BOAC, Continental Airlines and others followed suit, releasing albums to promote transcontinental routes (Figure 2.3). One Continental Airlines release, celebrating the opening of their Hawaiian route in the 1960s, even came with a full 50-page fold-out travel guide to each of the 25\n\n26\n\nMusic and Tourism\n\nFigure 2.3 The British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), later to be amalgamated within British Airways, also produced albums to coincide with the announcement of new airline routes.

The link between musical representations and prevailing tourism images is clear.\n\nislands, with descriptions of Hawaii’s geography, shopping districts and local history and culture, as well as space for travellers to record their own diary of experiences (Figure 2.4). Just a few years afterwards a ten-album Readers’ Digest/RCA compilation of Magical Melodies devoted half of one album to Hawaiian music, introduced with what had become a familiar theme: America’s newest state furnishes us with one of the oldest recipes for contentment in the world: equal parts of warm breeze, starlit sky, languid waves lapping at a perfect beach, and in the distance the mellow sounds of massed guitars. Of course there are songs of the South Seas being played on those guitars to swaying rhythms that have no equal in the realm of music anywhere. Care fades away, anxiety disappears and in their place come relaxation and content. Earlier Hawaiian songs were continually reinvented in different formats and genres, as electriﬁcation transformed sounds (thus ‘Across the Sea’ (1919) was revived in 1941 by Ray Kinney ‘and his suave, guitar-accented band, the Hawaiian Musical Ambassadors’), and new songs such as ‘Hawaiian Sunset’ continued themes ﬁrmly established before the start of the century. The marketing of Hawaiian music, largely to mainland 26\n\n27\n\nVirtual Tourism\n\n1111 2 3 4 5 611 7 8 9 1011 1 2 3111 4 5 6 7 8 9 20111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 30111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 40111 1 2 3 441111\n\nFigure 2.4 Honeymoon in Hawaii (1969) by the Hilo Hawaiians, was an LP produced and given away to customers on the ﬁrst Continental Airlines ﬂights from mid-west and western US hubs to Hawaii in 1969. The LP, sponsored also by American Express and Hawiian Airlines (hence including a map of internal Hawaiin ﬂights), featured lavish photographs, fold-out maps, diary spaces for tourists to record their experiences, detailed descriptions of individual islands, tips on ‘what to bring’ and advertisements for Continental Airlines routes. It is the most exuberant example of music as place promotion and soundtrack to tourism, yet despite its many pages, the actual recording artists are barely mentioned.\n\nAmericans, conveniently smoothed over the discontent and dispossession of American colonialism – indigenous sovereignty obscured by idyllic Paciﬁc sounds that both exoticised and celebrated the opening up of a new tourism destination. Away from the northern hemisphere, in countries more isolated from mass tourism, such as Australia, virtual tourism survived rather longer. As recently as 1974 the sleeve for the International Promenade Orchestra’s The Songs and Moods of a Continental Holiday suggested: Here is a musical passport to romance and reminiscence of a Continental Holiday. Lush strings and intimate accordion – musette, the warmth of mandolins as we take a turntable tour of France and Italy. Then on to the grandeur of the bullﬁght and soft warm nights in Malaguena – the happy ‘brau-haus’ oompah of Munich and the sweet nostalgia of Vienna. All yours in this programme of a Continental Holiday. (Anon., 1974) 27\n\n28\n\nMusic and Tourism\n\nAs real tourism replaced its vicarious form, the speciﬁc role of such records largely disappeared, though ironically to be revived as parody and kitsch in the lounge music of the late 20th century. However, producing music to create a sense of space, or to re-create the impression of particular environments, boomed with the advent of ambient music. Ambient music, designed to encourage relaxation and even sleep, emphasised ‘special’ places both generic and real, remote from urban centres and physically attractive – with mountains, falling or ﬂowing water (in streams rather than rivers), rainforests, coasts and oceans, occasionally deserts, and more generally ‘wilderness’. Such places were imbued with spiritual powers, or associated with particular animals regarded as having special qualities, especially birds, dolphins and whales. The liner notes to Andy Holm’s Blue Mountain Tales (1996), on Primal Harmony Records, stressed the signiﬁcance of the World Heritage site – the Blue Mountains National Park – immediately west of Sydney: During my frequent travels to the Blue Mountains I have always been inspired to pick up my instruments and play out the feelings that arise within me. This album is the product of the precious moments. Whether I played my ﬂute at the bottom of Wentworth Falls or the didjeridu at Echo Point, the vibration of the surroundings always inﬂuenced a strong tribal and spiritual sound, a reﬂection of my inner self opening up at the Blue Mountains beauty. Although this album is a fairy tale story, it is reﬂecting on my true emotions brought forward by the ambience of the Blue Mountains. Close your eyes while you are listening, let the narrator be your guide and join me on a magniﬁcent voyage through time, sound and space, and a dimension you will ﬁnd within yourself listening to this work. Similarly, the Australian musician Ken Davis, seeking to enter the North American market, released four albums in 2001: Tai Chi Music, Pan Flutes by the Ocean, Dolphin Magic and Spirit of Sedona. On the last of these, Sedona was described as ‘a spiritual centre one hundred miles north of Phoenix and is world-renowned for its spiritual energy and geological splendour . . . a focus for people seeking a spiritual environment. It is known for its healing spirits’. Some performers actually recorded within the natural landscape, or occasionally in such sites as the Taj Mahal, but more frequently entitled their albums with names of tourist places (such as Uluru (Ayers Rock) and Kakadu, in Australia) with particular natural and spiritual signiﬁcance. At the same time that indigenous peoples and places were becoming tourist attractions, ambient music stressed the mystical and ‘cosmic’ life forces associated with ‘traditional peoples’, their links to the earth and their musical instruments. In Australia the didjeridu features in much 28\n\n29\n\nVirtual Tourism\n\n1111 2 3 4 5 611 7 8 9 1011 1 2 3111 4 5 6 7 8 9 20111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 30111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 40111 1 2 3 441111\n\nambient music, especially that of the Aboriginal performer David Hudson, but panpipes and ﬂutes have been common (although not necessarily tied to their geographical origins). Beyond generic indigenous peoples, others claiming particular spiritual powers might also feature: shamans on North American music and monks in Ireland. For David and Steve Gordon’s Sacred Spirit Drums (Planet Earth Music, 2001) the company website exulted in a: ‘Melodic, magical, danceable story about a Shaman who journeys into the Spirit world to ﬁnd a way to heal the Earth and its people . . . Finally, the copious nature sounds were recorded at various National Monuments and parks’. Celtic Inspiration: An Irish Soundscape (Headline, 1995), recorded ‘among the cathedrals, churches, monastic cells, forest and lake of Glendalough’ deliberately took listeners on a journey there, as on the sixth track where ‘Slowly we move round the banks of the tranquil lake. Inevitably gentle rain starts to fall and we take shelter under the trees’. Irish ambient music often incorporated uilleann pipes and Scottish music the bagpipes. Natural sounds (an explicit identiﬁcation of indigenous peoples as ‘natural’) contributed to the primitivist fantasies of tranquillity, timelessness and human interaction with nature. Relaxation and spiritual healing were the promised and anticipated consequences. Ambient music stressed virtual tourism, both in its content and marketing, which centred on tourist venues and airports rather than music stores, and was designed to emphasise and enhance travels that might already have been accomplished. The notes to Ken Davis’s Early Morning in the Rainforest (1985), which blended bird song and electronic music, enjoined ‘Experience the feeling of being in the rainforest while still in the comfort of your own home’. Rather differently, the website of Australian performer, Tony O’Connor, included a ‘guestbook’ where listeners could record their thoughts on his music, as Clare Power from the Isle of Man registered in 2001: Australian friends introduced me to your music some years ago . . . . I introduced the wonderful ﬂowing sounds to the T’ai Chi Chuan Group, for Shibashi practice. Also your In Touch, Bushland Dreaming, Kakadu and Uluru keep me in touch with my daughter’s family and my friends ‘down under’ . . . . Thank you again, Namaste. (www. tonyoconnor.com, accessed 2001) Emigrant Australians, such as Robert, an ‘Aussie in Denmark’, may ‘listen to your music when I am homesick’. Ambient music, with links to new age and world music, and its combination of the electronic and the natural, creates a series of generic and particular places, that reﬂect and induce harmony. The genre has become exceptionally popular, yet remains largely distinct from other forms of music through its tourist orientation and the absence of live performance. 29\n\n30\n\nMusic and Tourism\n\nClassical Movements Classical music, even such obviously national music as Finlandia, has only rarely been directly used in ways that were linked to tourism, although just as the music of Percy Faith and others sought to transport listeners beyond humdrum suburban lives, some of the liner notes for classical music, especially the light classics, made similar but more subtle references. Works such as Offenbach’s Gaité Parisienne, Strauss’s ‘The Vienna Woods’ and ‘The Blue Danube’, Respighi’s ‘Fountains of Rome’ and Mendelssohn’s Italian and Scottish Symphonies (the latter with its Fingal’s Cave Overture) often made references to the links between music and place with exactly the same intention. Record covers too used the same images of place. Buildings such as the Eiffel Tower became clichés, and European castles, cathedrals and rustic countrysides were almost synonymous with classical covers. Tourist links were usually implicit rather than explicit. Beethoven’s ‘Pastoral’ Symphony was seen to reﬂect and represent his walks in the woods and ﬁelds around Vienna. In the liner notes to the Hollywood Bowl Symphony Orchestra’s Grand Canyon Suite, from the 1960s, the composer, Ferde Grofe, accredited his inspiration to living in Arizona: Roaming the desert and mountain country as an itinerant pianist. This was ﬁrst hand experience for me and I knew the terrain of the Grand Canyon region, its animal and bird life, and the people and their habits and customs. The richness of the land and the rugged optimism of the people had ﬁred my imagination. I was determined to put it all to music one day. Here, as in so many other cases, including Vila Lobos’s New York music and Smetana’s Down the River Volga, composers sought to conjure up the image of particular places in a way that would evoke those places to distant listeners. Copland’s Appalachian Spring and Gershwin’s An American in Paris were said to convey clear and evocative images, and their covers invariably emphasised their physical charms. Although they rarely invited listeners to engage in virtual tourism, as lighter music had done, An American in Paris did become the theme music for United Airlines. Inevitably, however, some did escape, in England, at least, through the music of Holst, Elgar or Vaughan Williams, and thus to largely pastoral landscapes, but there were sometimes more esoteric departures, as for Richard Morrison: With the help of Delius’s Song of the High Hills we can be transported mentally to the Cumbrian fells. The dissonances of Harrison Birtwhistle’s Grimethorpe Aria can carry us deep into the scarred industrial wastelands of the north. Or, if you prefer your countryside 30\n\n31\n\nVirtual Tourism\n\n1111 2 3 4 5 611 7 8 9 1011 1 2 3111 4 5 6 7 8 9 20111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 30111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 40111 1 2 3 441111\n\ntamer and prettier, the delightful 18th-century airs of Thomas Linley, the ‘English Mozart’, could waft us across some elegantly contrived Repton landscape. (Morrison, 2001: 17) Morrison did indeed walk across the Malvern Fells of Western England, listening on headphones to Elgar’s music that precisely evoked that landscape. Light classical music sometimes involved Spanish guitars and ﬂamenco beats, invariably with essentialist record covers of Spanish scenes, and Rodrigo’s Concierto de Aranjuez and Concierto de Andaluz evoked nostalgia for Spain. Ravel’s ‘Bolero’ had a similar effect. Such music simply emphasised the pleasures of mainly European destinations, in one more variant of vicarious tourism.\n\nLightness at Large Where ambient and classical music offered travel dreams through cover designs and direct invocations in liner notes, lyrics could directly stress the virtues of other places. Most early lyrics, from a time when tourism was an elite experience, were nostalgic – songs of lost places – rather than of contemporary pleasures. Others, like the dozens on the US state of Georgia, were onomatopoeic. Occasionally, such themes might be combined. Singers like Brendan O’Dowda created an imaginary Ireland with such favourites as ‘The Sun on Connemara’, ‘The Quiet Land of Erin’ and ‘Moonlight on the Mournes’, just as Kenneth McKellar championed the virtues of Loch Lomond and the Isle of Skye, when contemporary tourism was slight. In time, various sentimental songs contributed to such places becoming immortalised as tourist destinations. Musicals such as Showboat, Desert Song, Oklahoma, The King and I or West Side Story made generic or more obvious links to place but rarely in a way that linked distant places to travel, although many conveyed the excitement of places such as New York. The great exception was The Sound of Music which, as much as any other single musical work, eventually made the transition from virtual tourism to tourism itself. In time, the sound of music and tourism transformed the hills around Salzburg, a somewhat ironic shift since the ﬁlm was never translated into German (see Chapter 3). Some speciﬁc types of music were indistinguishable from tourism. The cover of German Drinking Songs, from the early 1970s, advised: How to enjoy this album – Pour yourself a stein of beer. Put the record on the turntable and turn it on. Sit down in a comfortable chair, take a sip of beer, close your eyes and visualise this scene. A small German village snuggled in a valley, surrounded by high snow-capped mountains – a 31\n\n32\n\nMusic and Tourism\n\nlarge circus tent pitched in the town square, completely encircled by stalls, selling trinkets, games, and variations of German foods, sausages and beer . . . . For this is the traditional Oktoberfest, the most popular of all German festivals. From the same time period, the Yugoslavian National Orchestra’s Holiday in the Balkans (Figure 2.5), and Music from the Greek Islands by Tacticos and his Bouzoukis, emphasised parallel but more enduring themes. As the cover notes to the latter observed: In recent years more and more travellers have been discovering the beauty of Greece and the delights of the myriad islands which bask around it in the Aegean Sea. Once regarded as the preserve of archaeologists, it is not realised that Greece combines an incomparable history with all the attractions of idyllic scenery and a Mediterranean climate; but among the memories of ivory temples, dolphins cavorting in blue waves, the tinkling of donkey bells and the duskygreen of the olive groves, none will be cherished more by the returning traveller than the memory of the warmth and friendliness of the Greek people, their natural hospitality, their courageous acceptance of life’s pains, and their unabashed embrace of life’s pleasures . . . . The music of Manos Tacticos and his Bouzoukis evokes the true ﬂavour of the Aegean and the islands of Greece, the whitewashed houses shining in the sun, the gentle waves of Homer’s ‘wine-dark’ sea, and the scintillating notes of the bouzoukis crystallize the spirit of Greece and its people, their friendship, their passions, their open-hearted love of life. As that cover also noted, images of Greece had been enhanced by ﬁlms such as Never on Sunday and Zorba the Greek – for which latter ﬁlm the music of Tacticos and Mikis Theodorakis had provided the soundtrack. No longer was it necessary merely to imagine and dream to a musical background as ﬁlm diversiﬁed the virtual experience. A parallel series of books, movies (and musicals often became movies) took up similar themes. Many versions of ‘Three Coins in the Fountain’ from the romantic 1954 ﬁlm emphasised Rome’s charms. Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour took various roads, including those to Singapore, Morocco, Zanzibar and Bali (although the ﬁlms had strange images of these locales), and The King and I encouraged new romantic images of the Orient. Earlier ﬁlms had featured the exotic singer, Carmen Miranda, who brought a Hollywood simplicity and distortion to Latin American locations from Rio to Havana. South Paciﬁc painted an indelible impression of an exotic Oceania where Bali Hai was ‘that one special island’ calling ‘come to me, come to me’ (Toop, 1999; Connell, 2003). Once again, a handful of exotic locations were exercising peculiar charms. 32\n\n33\n\nVirtual Tourism\n\n1111 2 3 4 5 611 7 8 9 1011 1 2 3111 4 5 6 7 8 9 20111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 30111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 40111 1 2 3 441111\n\nFigure 2.5 Air travel opened up European locations to tourism from Britain, particularly in Greece and Spain. On this LP by the Yugoslavian National Orchestra, ‘traditional’ music and costumes of the Balkans are celebrated, emphasising a place and time distant from the (then) contemporary concerns of the Cold War.\n\nTravelling the World No genre of music more obviously sought to transport listeners to other worlds than world music, the end point of a long-established process of incorporating alien sounds into popular music, evident in the 19th century with the fad for ‘Ethiopian’ music in early British music halls, Palm Court orchestras and eventually the success of performers from other regions. Exhibitions and festivals displayed unusual discoveries from other worlds, while artists such as Gauguin and composers 33\n\n34\n\nMusic and Tourism\n\nsuch as Debussy, Bizet and others absorbed inﬂuences from Asia, the Paciﬁc and Latin America into the European canon: The expositions were models of the shopping mall as well as being the precursors of themed entertainments, trade shows, postWoodstock rock festivals . . . choice fruits of empire, living proof of conquest and self-aggrandisement in the face of imminent decline. (Toop, 1995: 20–21) Music played a part in this, as instruments such as banjos were incorporated early into European music, and musical genres similarly spread, often far beyond their apparent origins. By the 1930s, for example, Hawaiian music and the rumba were both well established in Japan, markers of a lifestyle quite different from that of the host nation (Hosokawa, 1994, 1999b). Two decades later, the more successful introductions became occasional exotic entries to the lower reaches of hit parades; the Weavers sang ‘in the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight, Wimoweh’ (1962), which took its place along Israeli songs such as the Spotnicks’ ‘Hava nagila’, and the Cuban ‘Guantanamera’. The cute Japanese song ‘Sukiyaki’ became a global hit, as did the bossa nova song ‘The Girl from Ipanema’ (1963). More exotic sounds and places gradually became familiar to a wider world. Harry Belafonte’s two major calypsos of the 1950s, ‘Kingston Town’ (1956) and ‘Banana Boat Song’ (1957), with obvious African inﬂuences, sung of a place ‘where the nights were gay’ and banana loading was enjoyable (the height of romanticisation of a town viewed quite differently a decade or so later when reggae became Jamaica’s largest export). Caribbean tourism was just beginning to take off, and these and other calypsos were the spirit of the times. The construction of romantic tropical destinations was a small part of the establishment of urban modernity. In South Africa the Manhattan Brothers brought themes that offered ‘a romanticize"
