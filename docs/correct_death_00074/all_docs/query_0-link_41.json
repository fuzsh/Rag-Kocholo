MAIL BID SALE Monday , October 31, 1966 catalogued and sold by R KREISBERG Professional Numismatists 228 NORTH BEVERLY DRIVE BEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA Abner Kreisberg Jerry Cohen F O R E W O R I) We are once again pleased to present to the numismatic frater¬ nity a \"QUALITY SALE” containing an outstanding assortment of seldom offered material in all popular categories. If you are bidding in our sale for the first time we thought it would be of interest to you to know some of the \"hows” and 'whys’ of putting together a sale such as this. Many bidders and clients ask us where does such nice and varied material come from? There is no other source than the collector who has decided to sell because of numerous reasons. This sale contains over twenty different consign¬ ments. We receive many collections from Estates. Included in this sale is the collection from the Estate of William Edward Schreyer. Mr. Schreyer’s collection is far above the average. The Pan Pacific set offered was his pride and joy. Mr. Schreyer’s background is interest¬ ing because it is typical in many respects of the collector of this century. He was an attorney and graduated Cum Laude from the University of Minnesota. He collected coins from his childhood and then seriously added to his collection in the 1940’s. Upon retirement from his law practice in the early 1950’s the coin collection occupied more of his time and interest. The hours of pleasure were endless and we know it brought him many new friends. The heirs are not coin collectors, but will be happy to know the Schreyer collection will give thousands of collectors similar enjoyment and pride. Material from the fabulous Brand collection and from other col¬ lections throughout the country help to round out what we feel is one of the finest sales of the year. Please call or write if you need still further information on any of the material offered. ABNER KREISBERG and JERRY COHEN INDEX MEDALS Indian Peace Medals . 1 - 14 U. S.
