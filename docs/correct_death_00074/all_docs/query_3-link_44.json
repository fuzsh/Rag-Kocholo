        "text": "MAYNARDVILLE — When Chet Atkins touched the guitar strings, the world stopped.\n\n\"Where there was talk of the best guitarists, he was never mentioned,\" country singer and friend Eddy Arnold said. \"That was because you took him and put him on a pedestal. Then you argued about the rest of them.\"\n\nAtkins seldom raised his voice in song — at least not on the stage — but crowds in the thousands routinely fell quiet over the decades to hear him play. Look Tuesday night for some of the earliest known film of Atkins performing, in the third episode of Ken Burns' documentary series \"Country Music\" on PBS.\n\n'I gotta do it'\n\nChester Burton Atkins was born June 20, 1924, in Union County's Luttrell community, the son of a music teacher. His parents divorced when he was still a child, and he split his early years between his mother's home in East Tennessee and his father's farm in Harris County, Ga.\n\nThe family couldn't afford a guitar; he fashioned his first from a ukulele strung with screen-door wire. On his father's farm, where Atkins went to live in 1936, he listened to guitarist Merle Travis on the radio and taught himself to play.\n\nREAD IT ALL! Explore our Country Mile series\n\nBy age 18, Atkins was back in East Tennessee as a musician on WNOX radio's Mid-Day Merry-Go-Round, picking on a borrowed guitar. He made enough money from the job to buy his first guitar and learned on the stage to overcome his notorious shyness once the spotlights clicked on.\n\n\"I think that was one of the best things for a guy getting into the business — being able to play in front of an audience every day,\" he later told News Sentinel writer Wayne Bledsoe. \"I was so damn scared, I remember the pick wouldn't stay on my fingers. But I thought, 'Well, this is what I do. I gotta do it.' \"\n\n'A constant battle'\n\nIn 1949, Atkins joined the Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle and then the Grand Ole Opry in 1950. As a manager and producer for RCA Victor, he helped establish the trademark Nashville Sound of the era. He played session guitar for such stars as Hank Williams and Elvis Presley, published best-selling instructional books for guitar players and performed for sold-out crowds around the world. Fans hailed him as \"Mr. Guitar.\"\n\nThrough it all, he stayed humble and shunned the spotlight offstage.\n\n\"Being on TV and millions of people watching, that's not fear to me,\" Atkins said. \"That doesn't bother me at all. ... People want to be surprised all the time, so it's a constant battle to try to keep from being mediocre and keep out the conformity. Because once you start becoming predictable, people aren't interested anymore.\"\n\nHe spent his last years fighting another battle with cancer.\n\nAtkins performed his last concert in Knoxville in June 1998 at the Tennessee Theatre. He died June 30, 2001, of a brain tumor.\n\nHow to watch 'Country Music' in Knoxville\n\nKen Burns' documentary series \"Country Music\" airs on PBS at 8 p.m. New episodes continue daily through Wednesday. The second half of the series runs nightly at 8 p.m. from Sept. 22-25."
