        "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. - Chet Atkins, whose guitar style influenced a generation of rock musicians even as he helped develop an easygoing country style to compete with it, died Saturday. He was 77.\n\nAtkins died at home, a funeral director said.\n\nAtkins had battled cancer several years. He underwent surgery to remove a brain tumor in June 1997, and had a bout with colon cancer in the 1970s.\n\nAtkins recorded more than 75 albums of guitar instrumentals and sold more than 75 million albums. He played on hundreds of hit records, including those of Elvis Presley (\"Heartbreak Hotel\"), Hank Williams Sr. (\"Your Cheatin' Heart\") and The Everly Brothers (\"Wake Up Little Susie\").\n\nAs an executive with RCA Records for nearly two decades starting in 1957, Atkins aided the careers of Roy Orbison, Jim Reeves, Charley Pride, Dolly Parton, Waylon Jennings, and others.\n\nAtkins helped craft the lush Nashville Sound, using string sections and echo to make records that appealed to older listeners. Among his notable productions are \"The End of the World\" by Skeeter Davis and \"He'll Have to Go\" by Reeves.\n\nChester Burton Atkins was born June 20, 1924, on a farm near Luttrell, Tenn.\n\nAt the time he became ill, Atkins had just released a CD, \"The Day Finger Pickers Took Over the World.\" He also had begun regular Monday night performances at a Nashville club.\n\nSurvivors include his wife of more than 50 years, Leona Johnson Atkins, and a daughter, Merle Atkins.\n\nThe funeral is Tuesday morning at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, the former home of the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nArchive ID: 855779"
