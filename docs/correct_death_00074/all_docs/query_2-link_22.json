        "text": "Location: Corner of Fifth Avenue North and Union Street\n\nBefore legendary guitarist and music producer Chet Atkins passed away in June 2001, every serious guitar picker wanted the chance to play alongside him. Over the years, the list of greats who got that opportunity included Les Paul, Paul McCartney, Mark Knopfler, Merle Travis, Doc Watson, Jerry Reed, Steve Wariner, Suzzy Bogguss and Tommy Emmanuel.\n\nIn January 2000, Bank of America unveiled a life-sized bronze sculpture of Atkins (commissioned to Tennessee-based sculptor Russell Faxon) that sits outside its downtown Nashville headquarters. The work features Chet seated on a stool playing his guitar next to an empty stool on his left just waiting for you to join him. So bring your guitar, sit down, and get a photo of yourself picking with the man who light-heartedly gave himself the honorary degree of CGP (Certified Guitar Player)."
