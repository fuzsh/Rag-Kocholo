        "text": "Author Topic: Chet Atkins bashing. Bill Hatcher\n\nMember\n\nFrom: Atlanta Ga. USA\n\nposted 06 October 2000 06:46 AM profile Missed out on the Chet Atkins-Anita Kerr thread the other day. You know the old rap--Chet Atkins is the reason for country music becoming \"cosomopolitan\" and not having enough \"twang\" to it. First of all I have had the pleasure of actually playing \"underarm\" guitar with Atkins on a show here in Atlanta. Imagine yourself sitting behind your steel on the same stage with Buddy Emmons and you will get a feeling of the excitement/terror I had. The concert went great and Atkins was cool and complimentary. I have seen him in concert several times and have spoken to him.\n\nThe last big stink on this subject came a few years ago in a Dwight Yokum interview. He basically said that Atkins was the reason why country music sounded so bland and had lost it's twang. Hmmmm??? I think that Yokum (and others) might not really remember what was going on in the late 50s and early 60s. Rock and roll started to take over the charts and the status quo was totally upended. Billboard charts and radio playlists up until the early 60s were a thing of wonder by today's standards. ALL the recorded material was lumped together and sloshed out by DJs. Montovanni and Lawrence Welk were right there on the charts with Elvis and Chuck Berry and their records were played together on the same shows. Country music had such a small section of the overall music business in terms of airplay/record sales. Country songs gained exposure from the more popular artist covering them than from the original artist who did them. Singers like Tony Bennet, Frankie Laine,Doris Day, etc. would take the \"twangy\" country songs of Hank Williams and add a violin section,smooth out everything and the record company would sell about a million times the amount of the country artist. You can see that this idea did NOT begin with Chet Atkins.\n\nFlash forward a few more years to 1964. Anybody here remember when the Beatles came to America??? If you don't, then you have no idea whatsoever the intensity of what they did to the record/music scene here in America. Jazz artists, classical artists, easy listening artists, and yes-COUNTRY artists lost whatever positions they had in the recording world. Top 40 radio played virtually NONE of their records anymore.\n\nSo now you have Chet Atkins-VP of RCA Nashville which had become quite a nice part of RCA's revenue picture in a very uneviable position. So he takes his artist like Eddy Arnold, Jim Reeves, Skeeter Davis, etc. and presented them in the same kinds of violin laden settings that had been done by cover versions earlier. Most of these artist were not \"twang\" artist anyway and actually benefited from this. What Atkins did was circle the wagons at RCA and actually continue to sell records by aiming at your parents instead of the kids who did not give a hoot about country music.\n\nI did a search of the country charts from 59' to 65'. You might be surprised to see that there was PLENTY of hard core \"twang\" artist represented along with the new \"Nashville Sound\" artist.\n\nI personally think that what Atkins did kept the country music recording scene alive through the 60s and 70s.\n\nI wonder who Yokum blames for the current condition of country music???\n\nTerry Williams\n\nMember\n\nFrom: vanceboro, n.c. usa\n\nposted 06 October 2000 07:28 AM profile Chet Atkins was my hero,still is my hero,always will be my hero.Chet is the reason i play guitar.now,i'm not a very good picker, but i've had a lot of enjoyment with my guitar because of Chet.i tip my hat to you Mr. Atkins.my prayers go to you also, as i know you're fighting health problems.\n\n------------------\n\nRickRichtmyer\n\nMember\n\nFrom: Beautiful Adamstown, MD\n\nposted 06 October 2000 07:48 AM profile Chet was always one of my heroes as well. I learned to play six-string by spending a lot of hours dropping the needle on my copy of Chet's Fingerstyle Guitar album. If it hadn't been for that, I'd have probably never become a guitar player and I'd have likely not ever taken up steel.\n\nOf course, that might be the one disservice to country music for which Chet was unknowingly responsible.\n\n------------------\n\nRick Richtmyer\n\nGood News\n\n[This message was edited by RickRichtmyer on 06 October 2000 at 07:49 AM.]\n\nHerb Steiner\n\nMember\n\nFrom: Cedar Valley, Travis County TX\n\nposted 06 October 2000 09:54 AM profile Bill\n\nYour post is a very well-reasoned and historically correct statement about the way radio programming and record sales were in that period of time. Folks might also remember that \"all-country\" radio was a phenomenon only in larger markets and that oftentimes a radio station had a two-hour \"country\" show followed by a two-hour \"easy listening\" show, followed by a half-hour \"farm report\" followed by etc. etc.\n\nRock and roll really defined the categorization, and radio stations started using \"format marketing.\" This ushered in the era of shrinking playlists, which continues to this day. Many of you no doubt remember \"Hot 100\" playlists, and DJ's could play almost anything they wanted if they felt a new artist or song was worthy of public attention. Now we basically hear nothing but the same 25 songs over and over again, determined by a group of marketing analysts in an unmarked office building in a city far, far away.\n\nFortunately for us, the current 25 songs have Paul, Dan, Sonny, and Bruce all over them. I hope the trend stays that way for awhile.\n\nAs to who \"destroyed\" country music, here's another take on it. Musicians most often are influenced by the popular music they heard as teenagers. If you grew up in the 50's and 60's, as did I, you heard Ernest Tubb, Ray Price, Bob Wills, and guys like that. But guys 10-15 years younger than me, in the 1970's South, heard bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Allman Brothers, and other Southern Rock bands. So to incorporate that sound into playing \"country\" music of today is not so far a stretch. These would now be musicians in their 40's. Guys in their 30's would be influenced by the popular rock music of the 80's, and that shows their particular flavor of country... or whatever you want to call it.. music they play.\n\nIt's simply a cultural thing. The days of the family sitting around one radio listening to one station and one format went away a long time ago, and this current music reflects the cultural influences we, and our children, have been exposed to. Get over it, and buy the new CD's by Cornell Hurd, Johnny Bush, Dale Watson, and the Derailers.\n\n------------------\n\nHerb's Steel Guitar Homesite\n\n[This message was edited by Herb Steiner on 06 October 2000 at 09:57 AM.]\n\nBill Hatcher\n\nMember\n\nFrom: Atlanta Ga. USA\n\nposted 06 October 2000 10:46 AM profile Herb. Man I completely forgot about radio show time slots!!! We used to record DJ theme songs for the intro to their time slot. If you want to hear a particular style of music you had to know what time that show started. Brings back a lot of fond memories.\n\nAfter making the determination to myself that Chet Atkins did not \"ruin\" country music. I have put in some thinking as to what has happened to the country music scene as we now know it.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that rap music may be one of the reasons for the demise of country music. That is of course if you actually are of the opinion that anything is wrong with country. Some people might just be happy with the country scene the way it is. To each his own. Anyway, I noticed when rap music became popular on top 40 playlists several years ago, a HUGE section of younger listeners bailed out of top 40 radio. The only place they had to go was to country. The Nashville moguls started to chase after the young audience, cut their ties with the established hard country artists and never looked back.\n\nWhat they have in essence done is shifted the same incumberances of top forty rock onto the country market. In the past, a country artist would have a LONG career of recording. The fan base would stay with them for 5,10, 20 years or more. Now the longevity of artist is so much shorter. Younger listeners vasilate from fad to fad just like they did in the rock market. If you think the choreagraphy on the country music award shows was not needed--you just wait. You are going to see country artists with all sorts of gimmicks just like rock artists. Record companies can only churn out new flavors of the week, throw them up against the wall and see what sticks.\n\nThe \"nail in the coffin\" trend that I am looking for next will be the artists and Nashville record companies trying to disassociate themselves with the country \"stigma\" altogether. They live under the umbrella of \"Country\" but try their best to make the music cross over into the top 40 rock market. Sad.\n\nrayman\n\nunregistered posted 07 October 2000 05:22 PM Its a known fact that Atkins has had it in for steel guitar and fiddle for a long time. Probably a jealousy thing. I've always thought he was overrated. On his best day he couldn't kiss George Benson's behind.\n\n[This message was edited by rayman on 07 October 2000 at 05:23 PM.]\n\nBobby Lee\n\nSysop\n\nFrom: Cloverdale, North California, USA\n\nposted 07 October 2000 06:09 PM profile Ouch. There is no better musician in the world than Chet Atkins. None. People have different tastes, and some don't like his music, but he is one of the true masters in this world. This is obvious in concert as well as on record. He is one of the most gifted musicians who have ever lived.\n\n------------------\n\nBobby Lee - email: quasar@b0b.com - gigs - CDs\n\nSierra Session S-12 (E9), Speedy West D-10 (E9, D6),\n\nSierra 8 Laptop (D13), Fender Stringmaster D-8 (D13, A6)\n\nKenny Dail\n\nMember\n\nFrom: Kinston, N.C. 28504\n\nposted 07 October 2000 08:05 PM profile I agree with rayman that George Benson is good, but not better than Chet. As a matter of fact, Chet was George's mentor.\n\n------------------\n\nkd...and the beat goes on...\n\nBill Hatcher\n\nMember\n\nFrom: Atlanta Ga. USA\n\nposted 07 October 2000 09:24 PM profile Rayman!?!?!?!?!? Why you so mean to Chet???? We should take up a collection and send you to Sears and Roebuck Charm School!\n\nChet does not hate fiddles. He played a fiddle tune (ON THE FIDDLE!!!) on the concert I did with him and not too shabbily. As far as the steel is concerned, you need to check out the Emmons web site. Picture of old Chet there with BE. Several Chet records with the steel guitar featured.\n\nNow as far as George Benson compared to Atkins and kissing butt----well if you ONLY compare in a jazz vein then yeah Benson rules. If you stack up recording technique,tone,phrasing,styles etc. Benson does not stand a chance.\n\nBenson ever record with Elvis??? THAT makes him a pawn compared to Atkins. ;-) And what is with all that cosmetic surgery George has had------he be toooooooo pretty!!!! He also has not put out a decent jazz offering since that \"Breezin\" record came out in 1976. I used to go see him in the early 70s at a jazz club here in Atlanta. $2 to get in and the place was less than half full. I was playing at the Merchandise Mart the other night and Benson was up one level playing in a ballroom for a bunch of female conventioneers. NOT ANY jazz coming from George. Bunch of LA/R@B disco junk as far as I was concerned. Benson sold out a long time ago.\n\nHe's toast, with pockets so deep you wouldn't believe it!\n\nForget about piting player against player. That's apples and oranges. I have Benson recordings and Atkins recordings going back to the beginning of their careers. Some spectacular things from both. Some cheesy stuff too.\n\nStravinsky said \"competition is for horses, not musicians\".\n\nYou may not like Atkins but you can't deny his far reaching influences on SIX DECADES of players.\n\njim miller\n\nunregistered posted 07 October 2000 10:39 PM I have always liked Chet's music, and the finger style guitar. They called it 'thump and grab' guitar in the circles I came up in. I always got a chuckle out of that. I felt, however, that while his music was really great to listen to and watch some one play, but I can remember only one song he did that didn't die in a bar or club. That was Yakety Axe. I played with a guy in Parkersburg, WV, who loved Chet,learned his style, and learned every song Chet did and did it just like Chet. We could do one or two of Chet's tunes in a night but if we did any more than that, there was no response at all. I don't think Chet killed 'country music' any more than the outlaw movement ( Willie, Waylon, and the Boys) of the 70s.\n\nShucks, when I was a young'un it wasn't even called country music, it was 'hillbilly' music.Tex didn't dream about country heaven, it was Hillbilly Heaven. I have resigned myself to the fact that the country music that I was turned on to in the first place\n\nis gone forever.

He's a hero of mine.\n\nI have over 100 vinyl LPs of his.\n\nHe was also very open minded about music, and shared his spotlight albums with jazz, rock, and country players.\n\nYou'll never hear a top musician with anything bad to say about him.\n\nAs a businessman, at RCA, he did what was necessary to sell records. His true music showed thru on his own albums, which were not (usually) as popular as the pop-country stuff he produced.\n\nGod bless Chet!!!\n\n------------------\n\nj0e\n\nRoger Rettig\n\nMember\n\nFrom: NAPLES, FL\n\nposted 08 October 2000 02:48 PM profile I was in Mandolin Bros (that great guitar store on Staten Island) just chatting with Stan Jay and all the guys, and someone asked me why I thought that George Harrison played a Gretsch guitar when the Beatles first came to the USA - they felt I was qualified to answer as I'm British(!)...\n\nFirst of all, I was amazed they had to ask, but they were New Yorkers, I suppose... George played a Gretsch simply because, in Great Britain anyway, Chet was the first and origional Guitar Hero! He played on the Everly Bros. records for one thing and, if that wasn't enough, his solo albums were technically stunning. We ALL wanted a guitar like his! I was surprised to discover that he was probably bigger in the UK than he was in the northern US.\n\nGeorge, like all of us who were his 'baby boomer' contemporaries, slavishly copied Chet (as evidenced by several of his finger style solos on early Beatles records).\n\nI was fortunate enough to do a TV show on steel with George in the seventies, and we spent hours in the BBC bar talking over the very subject of Atkins' influence.\n\nBy 1960, I was convinced that Chet could walk on water, so when the Everly's \"Lucille\" was released with that blistering double solo I spent countless fruitless hours trying to replicate it's sustain and note-bending on my Gretsch Jet Firebird....\n\nIt was ten years before I learned that it was played by Jimmy Day....\n\nOh well....\n\nrayman\n\nunregistered posted 08 October 2000 03:28 PM I just think that the level of technical difficulty that Atkins does is no where near as challenging as Franklin, Emmons, or Green.\n\nJust glorified Travis picking. I can play any Atkins tune on guitar that I want. I can't play some of Emmons, Franklin, or Green's work without alot of hard work. Even then some is unattainable. Emmons is steel guitar.

Bobby Lee\n\nSysop\n\nFrom: Cloverdale, North California, USA\n\nposted 08 October 2000 08:33 PM profile Mostly it's apples and oranges comparing guitarists with steel players, but I've heard both Paul Franklin and Chet Atkins play \"Vincent\" live. Paul was excellent, but Chet played it even better.\n\nChet Atkins can put more musical content into two measures than you hear in whole songs on the radio, or whole nights in some bar rooms. That's the way I hear it, anyway. Musicianship isn't just playing the notes - it's knowing what to play and what not to play. You can copy Chet Atkins, but you can't do what he does.\n\n------------------\n\nBobby Lee - email: quasar@b0b.com - gigs - CDs\n\nSierra Session S-12 (E9), Speedy West D-10 (E9, D6),\n\nSierra 8 Laptop (D13), Fender Stringmaster D-8 (D13, A6)\n\nrayman\n\nunregistered posted 08 October 2000 08:51 PM Well said Bobby.

Emmons and Weldon Myrick both recorded with Chet in the past.\n\nSo in closing,rayman,on behalf of all guitar players all over the world that have been directly or indirectly influenced by Chet Atkins for the last 50yrs...KISS MY A$$ !

I'm sure he thought \" . . . if this Nashville cat can play jazz like that, so can I!\". So he did. Played his ass off, as a matter of fact.

Guitar players have been jealous of steel guitarists for years. As a matter of fact I've heard stories of many guitar players (particularly Travis pickers) taking their guitars and throwing them in the nearest lake after seeing Curly Chalker play. There was even a movement started by guitar players in the sixties to emulate Curly by taking chalk and rubbing it on the fret boards of their guitars. To this day pawn shops are littered with old guitars with chalk on their fret boards. Maybe you've seen one. The affliction at the time was known as Chalkeritis. It seems that victims of this malady after seeing Curly play would take to chalking their guitars and muttering to themselves \"too many changes...impossible inversion...can't be done...and things of that nature. They could sometimes be identified by pieces of chalk falling out of their pockets when reaching for spare change. The only cure was long exposure to Merle Travis records. I feel their pain I really do. If you know a guitarist who is recovering(they never really get over it) be kind to them. Dwight Yokam understands.\n\n[This message was edited by rayman on 10 October 2000 at 10:56 AM.]\n\n[This message was edited by rayman on 10 October 2000 at 10:59 AM.]\n\n[This message was edited by rayman on 10 October 2000 at 02:07 PM.]\n\nLarry Lenhart\n\nMember\n\nFrom: Ponca City, Oklahoma\n\nposted 10 October 2000 06:43 PM profile It is unbelievable to me that anyone could be so pompous to think they could play any tune with the same feeling and expression as Chet Atkins. Those who copy rarely have the same feeling as the original. I have said it before and I will say it again, Chet Atkins is the most influential electric guitar player of all time. He could take any tune and make it sound as though it were written for the guitar. His creative genius for the guitar is far beyond what most people can conceive. I cant understand why anyone would be so cruel or thoughtless in saying anything bad about Chet-he is so humble. He is a very ill man in his home in Nashville and it just turns my stomach to think anyone would say anything against this American Legend. I have attended the Chet Atkins Appreciation Society annual convention in Nashvile for the last 6 years. It is usually attended by around 2000 guitarist. And this is just a tribute to Chet, not to the whole world of guitar. I can assure this fellow who made the boast and post about being able to play any Chet tune, that he would not fool any of those 2,000 affeciandos of Chet. He is only fooling himself. Your loss.

I would never have known these great people if it were not for your ignorance rayman.The way to solve this problem is to simply not read any more post by rayman.My Daddy always said, when you hear nothing, say nothing.But you know,i've never heard a big name player put another fellow player down,doesn't that tell you something rayman.As for Chalker, even though he's passed on, i still have a tremendous amount of respect for him, and by the way, he was a good 6 string picker too.It don't take brains to criticize, any old vulture can find a carcass\n\n------------------\n\nEarl Erb\n\nMember\n\nFrom: Old Hickory Tenn\n\nposted 11 October 2000 03:36 PM profile Terry...thank you. rayman\n\nunregistered Sleepy John\n\nunregistered posted 11 October 2000 07:40 PM Earl, I don't think I 've ever been prouder to call you my friend. Chet has been my hero for almost 50 years. I never heard a steel player knock him and I've never heard of him putting down any musician either. Curly Chalker was a good friend of mine and Earl's, Curly recommended Earl for a job with the late Roger Miller. Curly was also One Hell of a Finger Style Guitarist In addition to being one of the greatest musicians to ever Grace Nashville.\n\nTerry Williams, you are also a Friend of mine and I don't want to see Some uninformed Wannabee run you off the Forum.\n\nRayman, What The Hell are you smoking?\n\nAs Earl said, in behalf of all Guitar Players, Musicians and Chet Atkins Fans, Worldwide, you can also Kiss my Redneck Tarheel A$$.\n\n------------------\n\nSj\n\n[This message was edited by Sleepy John on 11 October 2000 at 08:05 PM.]\n\nJerry Hayes\n\nMember\n\nFrom: Virginia Beach, Va.\n\nposted 11 October 2000 08:13 PM profile What Sleepy John said!\n\n------------------\n\nHave a good 'un!
