        "text": "Nashville’s Historic Temple of Sound\n\nHistoric RCA Studio B is among the most significant recording spaces in the world. For twenty years, the RCA Records studio was the incubator for hit after hit in the country and pop markets. Here many famous artists—including Eddy Arnold, the Everly Brothers, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Roy Orbison, Dolly Parton, Charley Pride, Jim Reeves, and Connie Smith—made some of their most important records.\n\nIt was also the home base for Country Music Hall of Fame member Chet Atkins, a virtuoso guitarist and influential record producer for RCA’s artists. Built in 1957, RCA Studio B became known as a birthplace for the “Nashville Sound,” a pop-oriented style of country music characterized by smooth instrumentation, background vocals, and string sections that helped establish Nashville as an international recording center.\n\nSignificantly, RCA Studio B is one of the places where the “Nashville number system”—a shorthand notation for a song’s chord progressions using numbers and symbols instead of notes—was refined by Country Music Hall of Fame members Neil Matthews of the Jordanaires and Charlie McCoy. This number system, used to this day, allows spontaneous “head arrangements” in the studio and makes changing a song’s key quick and easy.\n\nA Storied History\n\nPrior to building Studio B, RCA had a recording space on McGavock Street, a few blocks north of RCA Studio B’s eventual location. But the company did not have a Nashville division. Then, in late 1955, Elvis Presley signed with RCA and exploded on the scene. Six months into his contract, he was the biggest act in RCA’s history. At the end of 1956, RCA tallied sales of ten million singles, three million EPs, and 800,000 copies of Presley’s first two albums.\n\nWith Presley proving to be such a huge commercial success and several country acts on RCA doing well, RCA’s country music chief, Steve Sholes, persuaded the label that it made good sense to open a Nashville office and a new studio. To run the Nashville operation, Sholes selected Chet Atkins, a standout guitar player who had been serving as an assistant producer to Sholes. Chet, then thirty-two, became RCA’s “musical director” in Nashville in the spring of 1957.\n\nAccording to Atkins, RCA’s chief audio engineer, Bill Miltenburg, drew out the plans for the building on a dinner napkin. Dan Maddox, a local businessman, stepped in and offered to construct a building to house the studio as an investment. The building was completed for about $40,000 in November 1957, and Maddox leased it to RCA for the next twenty years.\n\nIn the early days, it was called the RCA Victor Studio. When the studio opened, the staff consisted of just Chet Atkins, his assistant Juanita Jones, an engineer, and a man in custom sales who brought in outside record labels for recording sessions. It served as RCA’s Nashville headquarters until 1964, when the building next door was built to house RCA offices and a new larger studio, called Studio A. As a result, the smaller facility became known as Studio B.\n\nOver the years, a veritable hit parade of classics was recorded there, including Skeeter Davis’s “The End of the World,” Jim Reeves’s “He’ll Have to Go,” the Everly Brothers’ “All I Have to Do Is Dream,” Roy Orbison’s “Only the Lonely,” Charley Pride’s “Kiss an Angel Good Morning,” Connie Smith’s “Once a Day,” Porter Wagoner’s “Green, Green Grass of Home,” and Dolly Parton’s “Joshua.” Elvis Presley recorded more than 240 songs at RCA Studio B, including such big hits as “Are You Lonesome Tonight,” “It’s Now or Never,” “(Now and Then There’s) A Fool Such As I,” and “Marie’s the Name) His Latest Flame.”\n\nOpen to the Public\n\nIn 1977, RCA closed all of its Nashville studios. After thousands of recording sessions over twenty years, RCA ceased operations at Studio B, and the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum began operating the studio as a historic site, allowing public tours for the first time. RCA Studio B was donated to the Museum by the late Dan and Margaret Maddox in 1992.\n\nFollowing the Mike Curb Family Foundation’s philanthropic 2002 purchase and subsequent lease in perpetuity for $1 per year to the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, the storied studio’s exterior has been renovated and the interior has been returned to its historic appearance as an analog “temple of sound.”\n\nToday, museum staff members manage the studio, supervising school programs and public tours during the day. A number of artists have continued to record at RCA Studio B from time to time. Among them have been Gillian Welch and David Rawlings with Time (The Revelator) in 2001, Marty Stuart with Ghost Train: The Studio B Sessions in 2010, Bobby Bare with Darker Than Light in 2013, and John Hiatt with the Jerry Douglas Band with Leftover Feelings in 2021.\n\nPartners\n\nPreservation of Historic RCA Studio B is made possible through a partnership between the Mike Curb Family Foundation and the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. In 2002, the foundation philanthropically purchased historic RCA Studio B, making it possible for the Museum to provide studio tours in support of its educational mission.\n\nHistoric RCA Studio B is supported, in part, by City National Bank, Fender Musical Instruments Corporation, Sally Friedman, Metropolitan Nashville Arts Commission, Rupert Neve Designs, Clarence and Ann Spalding, Chris and Maggie Stewart, Tennessee Arts Commission, and Jonathan and Elizabeth Weiswasser.\n\nSince 1977, RCA Studio B has been operated as a historic site by the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, and is open for tours."
