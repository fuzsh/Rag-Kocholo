        "text": "Over the span of four generations, the Gretsch Company developed what came to be known as “That Great Gretsch Sound.”\n\nWith its emphasis on hand-craftsmanship and commitment to quality over a storied 135 years and counting, Gretsch has pioneered new designs and manufacturing techniques, winning endorsements from some of the music industry’s most respected artists, including Chet Atkins, Eddie Cochran, Billy Duffy, Bono, Duane Eddy, George Harrison, Brian Setzer, Stephen Stills and Malcolm Young.\n\nIt all began in 1883, when 27-year-old Friedrich Gretsch, a German immigrant, founded his shop in Brooklyn, New York, and began to make banjos, drums and tambourines. Only 12 years later Friedrich died, leaving the fledgling company in the hands of his teenage son Fred.\n\nWhile it may be an unlikely start for a century-plus long musical legacy, young Fred wasn't the typical teen. By 1916 he had built the company into one of America's leading importers and manufacturers of musical instruments, and the operations moved into a 10-story building at 60 Broadway in Brooklyn.\n\nFred knew that listening to what the public wanted was the key to growth, and the public wanted guitars. So, Gretsch began making guitars.\n\nInitially, Gretsch offered acoustic archtops aimed at jazz musicians, and a handful of flat-tops for country-western performers.\n\nMeanwhile, 1935 marked an important year for Gretsch — Charles “Duke” Kramer joined the team. Kramer went on to become a mainstay of the Gretsch Company, and remained a valued counsel and ambassador until his passing in 2005.\n\nFred Gretsch, Sr. retired from the company in 1942, leaving the day-to-day operations to his sons Fred Jr. and William.\n\nFred Gretsch, Jr. managed the company briefly, then left the company to serve with distinction as a commander in the Navy, and Bill Gretsch became president, serving the company until his death in 1948.\n\nCommand was again passed to Fred Gretsch, Jr. and the Navy veteran led the company into a new age of prosperity in the 1950s. Gretsch, being the first to use custom color finishes, and offering a wide variety of space age gizmos and gimmickry, was uniquely positioned to succeed in this “Atomic Age” era. During the ‘50s, they even outsold Leo Fender's wonderful new creations, with a boost in sales also credited to high-profile artists and endorsers like Chet Atkins, Eddie Cochran and Duane Eddy.\n\nThe 1960s brought a further boost to Gretsch when Beatles’ great George Harrison played a succession of Gretsch models.\n\nIn the late-'60s, Fred Gretsch retired and sold the company to Baldwin Manufacturing. Baldwin had difficulty understanding Gretsch's position in the market and failed to make a transition through the psychedelic '60s and hard-rock '70s. To make matters worse, Baldwin moved production to Arkansas, and Gretsch suffered through two disastrous fires. The Baldwin marriage was always an unhappy one, and eventually resulted in a shutdown in production in the early-80s."
