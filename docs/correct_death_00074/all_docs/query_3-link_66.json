        "text": "Chet Atkins (Chester Burton Atkins) was a legendary guitarist, considered to be one of the actual creators of country music, as well as a producer, who was absolutely devoted to music since his early age. He grew up on a small farm in Tennessee, and he learned to play guitar in quite short time, free from daily work. He listened to the radio every evening and learned to imitate the sounds of various musical instruments with his guitar playing. He developed his special distinctive picking style and at the beginning of his career worked extensively as a freelance guitarist with a large number of orchestras and bands. In the late 1950s, along with Ferguson and Bradley, Atkins presented what is known as Nashville sound, coming instead of honky tonk style of the 1940s. In those times he has got a nickname Mr. Guitar. For his lasting career, Chet Atkins collaborated with many musicians and guitarists, including Elvis Presley, Ray Charles, Norma Jean, Dolly Parton, George Harrison, Mark Knopfler, and many more. He won 14 Grammy and 9 Country Music Awards."
