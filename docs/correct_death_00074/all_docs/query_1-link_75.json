        "text": "They aren't really that pricey either I wonder why?\n\nI saw one of those earlier guitars long before I had heard of Chet!\n\nA friend traded one for something else and I remember we were all standing around looking at it, and me! Well, I wanted it!\n\nBut being young, rock and blues oriented guitarists, when the guy plugged the Chet in to his 100 watt Marshall, well it sounded, to be kind......sh**********ttttt........\n\nReally, those guitars were the early, early acoustic electric forerunners! Not many acoustics with pickups then.\n\nBluesKing777.\n\n(I should have started learning Chet licks then! I may have had a hope.....)\n\nGonna have to title this one: 'My Chet Disconnect'…\n\nBut first, let me say I love the '98 Chet SST; truly a rare bird; all White, Custom Shop SST, that I'm fortunate to play at all my acoustic gigs. Whether solo or with a full band, I could not be happier with it. However…[yes, there is a current 'however'].\n\nHere's the deal: I had a string break during at my birthday show a few weeks back, yet finished the tune after pulling the string free—\"The show must go on\" and all of that. Well, in the process of changing it out during the break, I lost grip on the bridge side of the barb and it slipped beneath the bridge. No biggie, really, just unscrewed the backing plate and fished it out…and here's the 'however': I accidentally let the rear cover slip out of my hand and it pulled the battery leads from the preamp board. First time for everything. So, I removed it, carefully, and managed (somehow) to reconnect it well enough to finish the show.\n\nThought all was good—as no issues reoccurred—that is, until my next show (a showcase event where I only had to fill about 50 minutes vs 3 hrs) when I plugged in and…nothing. I thought it was a dead battery. Replaced it. More nothing. Was caught without a backup as \"Nothing ever goes wrong with my Chet,\" but was fortunate enough to be able to borrow one from one of the other featured players and filled my 50.\n\nGot home. Took everything apart—caaarefully—and noted the wires had come undone once again as it appeared I hadn't attached them as they were originally. And this is my dilemma: namely, there is nothing I've been able to locate online or elsewhere on how these are connected. They're not soldered on, but go through a tiny plastic clip sort of connector that looks more like an avionics or network connector than anything I've ever encountered on any guitar I've ever played.\n\nSo…HEEELP!!!\n\nAm at a standstill as I don't know anyplace locally I would trust with this and need to get it back into my starting lineup as soon as possible.\n\nAnyone? Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?…[my thanks in advance for any assistance possible].\n\nP.S. Hate to have my first-ever post to this newly granted access be an SST-MAYDAY, but…oh well ;)"
