As the childrens' librarian at the Jesup Library in B ar Harbor, Carol's love for children, reading, relationships and creativi ty welcomed many into the richness and intimacy of the children's roo m. To have a book in hand with a child at ther side always gave her gre at pleasure, as did the flowers she nurtured and loved.

In addition to David, Justin, and Emma, Carol leaves her parents, Morton and Mari an Bailey of Ridgefield, Conn.; her sister, Anne Watters of Glen Hea d, N. Y.
