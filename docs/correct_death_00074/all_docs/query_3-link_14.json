        "text": "Guitarist, songwriter, producer, talent scout, confidante â€“ Chet Atkins, who passed away on June 30, 2001, played so many roles so well for so long that to enumerate his contributions would take more than a few pages and indeed merit a book length treatise.\n\nTo point out that he has sold more than thirty-five million albums as a solo artist, won fifteen Grammy Awards (including Lifetime Achievement) and changed the course of country music as a producer only scratches the surface of his legacy."
