She was born Sept. 18, 1927, in Pineville, Ky., to Selby and Roxie (Wilder) Wilson. On Dec. 23, 1944, she married Leonard Knuckles, and Joyce set her life's work of homemaking. In 1967 she helped move the family from Kentucky to southern Richland County, following a job move for Leonard. A Proverbs 31 woman, Joyce set about her tasks vigorously; her arms were strong for her tasks. She spoke with wisdom and faithful instruction was on her tongue. She watched over the affairs of her household and did not eat the bread of idleness. Her children rose and called her blessed, her husband also, and he praised her. She excelled at the home arts and loved and enjoyed cooking for her family. Her special touch to fried chicken and sweet tea made simple family gatherings special events. Joyce was a faithful member of Perry Church of Christ and formerly taught Sunday school there. In her younger years she loved to play the guitar and held a great fondness for music -- especially gospel music. In good weather she and Leonard could be found tending to their garden and Joyce never neglected to be in the scriptures on a daily basis.
