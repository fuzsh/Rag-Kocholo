        "text": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chet_Atkins\n\nChester Burton Atkins (June 20, 1924 – June 30, 2001), better known as Chet Atkins, was an American guitarist and record producer who, along with Owen Bradley, created the smoother country music style known as the Nashville sound, which expanded country's appeal to adult pop music fans as well.\n\nAtkins's picking style, inspired by Merle Travis, Django Reinhardt, George Barnes and Les Paul, brought him admirers within and outside the country scene, both in the United States and internationally. Atkins produced records for Perry Como, Elvis Presley, the Everly Brothers, Eddy Arnold, Don Gibson, Jim Reeves, Jerry Reed, Skeeter Davis, Connie Smith, Waylon Jennings and others.\n\nAmong many honors, Atkins received 14 Grammy Awards as well as the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, nine Country Music Association Instrumentalist of the Year awards, and was inducted into both the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. .\n\nChildhood and early life\n\nChet Atkins was born on June 20, 1924, in Luttrell, Tennessee, near Clinch Mountain, and grew up with his mother, two brothers and a sister—he was the youngest. His parents divorced when he was six. He started out on the ukulele, later moving on to the fiddle, but traded his brother Lowell an old pistol and some chores for a guitar when he was nine. He stated in his 1974 autobiography, \"We were so poor and everybody around us was so poor that it was the forties before anyone even knew there had been a depression.\" Forced to relocate to Fortson, Georgia, to live with his father because of a near-fatal asthma condition, Atkins was a sensitive youth who made music his obsession. Because of his illness, he was forced to sleep in a straight-back chair in order to breathe comfortably. On those nights, he would play his guitar until he fell asleep holding it, a habit which lasted his whole life. While living in Fortson, he attended historic Mountain Hill School. He would return in the 1990s to play a series of charity concerts to save the school from demolition.\n\nStories have been told about the very young Chet who, when a friend or relative would come to visit, and if that person played a guitar, would crowd in and put his ear so very close to the instrument that it became difficult for that person to play.\n\nAtkins became an accomplished guitarist while he was in high school. He would use the restroom in the school to practice, because it gave better acoustics. His first guitar had a nail for a nut and was so bowed that only the first few frets could be used. He later purchased a semi-acoustic electric guitar and amp, but he had to travel many miles to find an electrical outlet since his home had no electricity.\n\nLater in life he lightheartedly gave himself (along with John Knowles, Tommy Emmanuel, Steve Wariner and Jerry Reed) the honorary degree CGP, standing for \"Certified Guitar Player\". In 2011 Daughter Merle Atkins Russell bestowed the CGP degree upon long time sideman Paul Yandell. She then declared no more CGP's would be allowed by the Atkins Estate.\n\nHis half-brother Jim was a successful guitarist who worked with the Les Paul Trio in New York.\n\nAtkins did not have a strong style of his own until 1939 when (while still living in Georgia) he heard Merle Travis picking over WLW radio. This early influence dramatically shaped his unique playing style. Whereas Travis's right hand used his index finger for the melody and thumb for bass notes, Atkins expanded his right hand style to include picking with his first three fingers, with the thumb on bass.\n\nChet Atkins was a Ham Radio General class licensee. Formerly using the call-sign, WA4CZD, he obtained the vanity call sign W4CGP in 1998 to reflect the C.G.P. name. He was an ARRL member.\n\nEarly musical career\n\nAfter dropping out of high school in 1942, Atkins landed a job at WNOX-AM radio in Knoxville. There he played fiddle and guitar with singer Bill Carlisle and comic Archie Campbell as well as becoming a member of the station's Dixieland Swingsters, a small swing instrumental combo. After three years, he moved to WLW-AM in Cincinnati, Ohio, where Merle Travis had formerly worked.\n\nAfter six months he moved to Raleigh and worked with Johnnie and Jack before heading for Richmond, Virginia, where he performed with Sunshine Sue Workman. Atkins's shy personality worked against him, as did the fact that his sophisticated style led many to doubt he was truly \"country.\" He was fired often but was soon able to land another job at another radio station due to his unique playing ability.\n\nTraveling to Chicago, Atkins auditioned for Red Foley, who was leaving his star position on WLS-AM's National Barn Dance to join the Grand Ole Opry. Atkins made his first appearance at the Opry in 1946 as a member of Foley's band. He also recorded a single for Nashville-based Bullet Records that year. That single, \"Guitar Blues\", was fairly progressive, including as it did, a clarinet solo by Nashville dance band musician Dutch McMillan with Owen Bradley on piano. He had a solo spot on the Opry; but when that was cut, Atkins moved on to KWTO-AM in Springfield, Missouri. Despite the support of executive Si Siman, however, he soon was fired for not sounding \"country enough.\"\n\nSigning with RCA Victor\n\nWhile working with a Western band in Denver, Colorado, Atkins came to the attention of RCA Victor. Siman had been encouraging Steve Sholes to sign Atkins, as his style (with the success of Merle Travis as a hit recording artist) was suddenly in vogue. Sholes, A&R director of country music at RCA, tracked Atkins down to Denver.\n\nHe made his first RCA recordings in Chicago in 1947. They did not sell. He did some studio work for RCA that year but had relocated to Knoxville again where he worked with Homer and Jethro on WNOX's new Saturday night radio show The Tennessee Barn Dance and the popular Midday Merry Go Round.\n\nIn 1949 he left WNOX to join Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters back on KWTO. This incarnation of the old Carter Family featured Maybelle Carter and daughters June, Helen and Anita. Their work soon attracted attention from the Grand Ole Opry. The group relocated to Nashville in mid-1950. Atkins began working on recording sessions, performing on WSM-AM and the Opry.\n\nWhile he hadn't yet had a hit record on RCA his stature was growing. He began assisting Sholes as a Session Leader when the New York–based producer needed help organizing Nashville sessions for RCA artists. Atkins's first hit single was \"Mr. Sandman\", followed by \"Silver Bell\", which he did as a duet with Hank Snow. His albums also became more popular, and he was featured on ABC-TV's The Eddy Arnold Show during the summer of 1956; as well as on Country Music Jubilee in 1957 and 58 (by then renamed Jubilee USA).\n\nAtkins's Gretsch Country Gentleman, model G6122-1962\n\nIn addition to recording, Atkins became a design consultant for Gretsch, who manufactured a popular Chet Atkins line of electric guitars from 1955–1980. Atkins also became manager of RCA's Nashville studio, eventually inspiring and seeing the completion of the legendary RCA Studio B, the first studio built specifically for the purpose of recording on the now-famous Music Row.\n\nPerformer and producer\n\nWhen Sholes took over pop production in 1957—a result of his success with Elvis Presley—he put Atkins in charge of RCA's Nashville division. With country music record sales declining as rock and roll took over, Atkins and Bob Ferguson took their cue from Owen Bradley and eliminated fiddles and steel guitar as a means of making country singers appeal to pop fans. This became known as the Nashville sound which Atkins said was a label created by the media attached to a style of recording done during that period to keep country (and their jobs) viable.\n\nAtkins used the Jordanaires and a rhythm section on hits like Jim Reeves' \"Four Walls\" and \"He'll Have to Go\" and Don Gibson's \"Oh Lonesome Me\" and \"Blue Blue Day\". The once rare phenomenon of having a country hit cross over to pop success became more common. He and Bradley had essentially put the producer in the driver's seat, guiding an artist's choice of material and the musical background.\n\nAtkins made his own records, which usually visited pop standards and jazz, in a sophisticated home studio, often recording the rhythm tracks at RCA but adding his solo parts at home, refining the tracks until the results satisfied him. Guitarists of all styles came to admire various Atkins albums for their unique musical ideas and in some cases experimental electronic ideas. In this period he became known internationally as \"Mister Guitar\", inspiring an album named Mister Guitar, engineered by both Bob Ferris and Bill Porter, his replacement.\n\nAt the end of March 1959, Porter took over as chief engineer at RCA's Nashville studio, in the space now known as \"Studio B\". (At the time there was only one studio at RCA, with no letter designation.) Porter soon helped Atkins get a better reverberation sound from the studio's German effects device, an EMT plate reverb. With his golden ear, Porter found the studio's acoustics to be problematic, and he devised a set of acoustic baffles to hang from the ceiling, then selected positions for microphones based on resonant room modes. The sound of the recordings improved significantly, and the studio achieved a string of successes. The Nashville sound became more dynamic. In later years, when Bradley asked how he achieved his sound, Atkins told him \"it was Porter.\" Porter described Atkins as respectful of musicians when recording—if someone was out of tune he would not single that person out by name. Instead, he would say something like, \"we got a little tuning problem ... Everybody check and see what's going on.\" If that didn't work, Atkins would instruct Porter to turn the offending player down in the mix. When Porter left RCA in late 1964, Atkins said, \"the sound was never the same, never as great.\"\n\nAtkins's trademark \"Atkins Style\" of playing uses the thumb and first two—sometimes three—fingers of the right hand. He developed this style from listening to Merle Travis occasionally on a primitive radio. He was sure no one could play that articulately with just the thumb and index finger (which was exactly how Travis played) and he assumed it required the thumb and two fingers—and that was the style he pioneered and mastered.\n\nHe enjoyed jamming with fellow studio musicians which led to them being asked to perform at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1960. Although that performance was canceled due to rioting, a live recording of the group (After the Riot at Newport) was released. Atkins performed by invitation at the White House for presidents Kennedy through George H. W. Bush. Atkins was a member of the Million Dollar Band during the 1980s. He is also well known for his song \"Yankee Doodle Dixie\", in which he played \"Yankee Doodle\" at the same time as \"Dixie\" simultaneously on the same guitar.\n\nBefore his mentor Sholes died in 1968, Atkins had become vice president of RCA's country division. In 1987 he told Nine-O-One Network Magazine that he was \"ashamed\" of his promotion: \"I wanted to be known as a guitarist and I know, too, that they give you titles like that in lieu of money. So beware when they want to make you vice president.\" He had brought Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Connie Smith, Bobby Bare, Dolly Parton, Jerry Reed and John Hartford to the label in the 1960s and inspired and helped countless others. He took a considerable risk during the mid-1960s, when the Civil Rights Movement sparked violence throughout the South by signing country music's first African-American singer Charley Pride, who sang rawer country than the smoother music Atkins had pioneered.\n\nAtkins's own biggest hit single came in 1965, with \"Yakety Axe\", an adaptation of his friend saxophonist Boots Randolph's \"Yakety Sax\". He rarely performed in those days, and eventually had to hire other RCA producers like Bob Ferguson and Felton Jarvis to alleviate his workload.\n\nAtkins retires from producing\n\nIn the 1970s, Atkins became increasingly stressed by his executive duties. He produced fewer records but could still turn out hits such as Perry Como's pop hit \"And I Love You So\". He recorded extensively with close friend and fellow picker Jerry Reed, who'd become a hit artist in his own right. A 1973 diagnosis of colon cancer, however, led Atkins to redefine his role at RCA, to allow others to handle administration while he went back to his first love, the guitar, often recording with Reed or even Homer & Jethro's Jethro Burns (Atkins's brother-in-law) after Homer died in 1971.\n\nBy the end of the 1970s, Atkins's time had passed as a producer. New executives at RCA had different ideas. He first retired from his position in the company, and then began to feel stifled as an artist because RCA would not let him branch out into jazz. His mid-1970s collaborations with one of his influences, Les Paul, Chester & Lester and Guitar Monsters, had already reflected that interest; Chester & Lester was one of the best-selling recordings of Atkins's career. At the same time he grew dissatisfied with the direction Gretsch (no longer family-owned) was going and withdrew his authorization for them to use his name and began designing guitars with Gibson. He left RCA in 1982 and signed with Columbia Records, for whom he produced a debut album in 1983.\n\nJazz had always been a strong love of his, and often in his career he was criticized by \"pure\" country musicians for his jazz influences. He also said on many occasions that he did not like being called a \"country guitarist\", insisting that he was a guitarist, period. Although he played 'by ear' and was a masterful improviser he was able to read music and even performed some classical guitar pieces. When Roger C. Field, a friend, suggested to him in 1991 that he record and perform with a female singer he did so with Suzy Bogguss.\n\nHe returned to his country roots for albums he recorded with Mark Knopfler and Jerry Reed. Knopfler had long mentioned Atkins as one of his earliest influences. Atkins also collaborated with Australian guitar legend Tommy Emmanuel. On being asked to name the ten most influential guitarists of the 20th century, he named Django Reinhardt to the first position on the list, and placed himself at fifth position.\n\nIn later years he even went back to radio, appearing on Garrison Keillor's Prairie Home Companion radio program, on American Public Media radio, even picking up a fiddle from time to time.\n\nLegacy\n\nAtkins received numerous awards, including 14 Grammy Awards and nine Country Music Association Instrumentalist of the Year awards. In 1993 he was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Billboard magazine awarded him their Century Award, their \"highest honor for distinguished creative achievement\", in December 1997.\n\nAtkins is notable for his broad influence. His love for numerous styles of music can be traced from his early recording of stride-pianist James P. Johnson's \"Johnson Rag,\" all the way to the rock stylings of Eric Johnson, an invited guest on Atkins's recording sessions who, when Chet attempted to copy his influential rocker \"Cliffs of Dover\", led to Atkins's creation of a unique arrangement of \"Londonderry Air (Danny Boy).\"\n\nChet's recordings of \"Malaguena\" inspired a new generation of Flamenco guitarists; the classical guitar selections included on almost all his albums were, for many American artists working in the field today, the first classical guitar they ever heard. He recorded smooth jazz guitar still played on American airwaves today.\n\nWhile he did more performing in the 1990s his health grew frail as he was diagnosed with cancer again in 1996. He died on June 30, 2001 at his home in Nashville.\n\nAtkins was laid to rest at Harpeth Hills Memory Gardens in Nashville.\n\nAtkins was quoted many times throughout his career, and of his own legacy he once said:\n\nYears from now, after I'm gone, someone will listen to what I've done and know I was here.

2002\n\nEarly Years Chester Burton Atkins was born on June 20, 1924, in Luttrell, Tennessee, near Clinch Mountain on his grandfather's farm, and grew up with his mother Ida Ella Sharp, after she and his father, James Atkins, divorced when he was six.[5][4][6][7][8] He had two brothers and a sister—he was the youngest.[2]\n\nChet started out his musical pursuits on the ukulele, later moving on to the fiddle.[2] He traded his brother Lowell an old pistol (or possibly a farm wagon) and some chores for a guitar that had belonged to his step-father, Willie, when he was nine.[4] He started playing local parties and businesses.[4] Chet stated in his 1974 autobiography, \"We were so poor and everybody around us was so poor that it was the forties before anyone even knew there had been a depression.\"[4]\n\nChet relocated to Fortson, Georgia, to live with his father because of a near-fatal asthma condition in the late thirties.[2][9] He often stayed home from school because of his health, and taught himself banjo during those times.[4] Because of his illness, he was forced to sleep in a straight-back chair in order to breathe comfortably.[2] On those nights, he would play his guitar until he fell asleep, and continue holding it, a habit which lasted his whole life.[2]\n\nChet became an accomplished guitarist while he was in high school, but it wasn't surprising considering his family's musical background.[2] Chet's grandfather was a champion fiddler.[4] Chet's father, James, was a music teacher, piano tuner, and singer.[4] His half brother, Jim, was a rhythm guitarist in the Les Paul Trio in the thirties.[4] His older brother, Lowell, also played guitar.[4] He quit high school and jumped in on the spread of country music out of the South, as World War II drafted soldiers across the country.[4] At age 17, he was a professional musician.[4]\n\nNashville Chet made his living first playing fiddle with the Jumpin' Bill Carlisle-Archie Campbell radio show.[4] A producer there heard him playing guitar in down times, and drafted him to play rhythm guitar for the \"Midday Merry-Go-Round\" show.[4] Despite his talent, he'd have trouble keeping jobs because of his shyness, which was often mistaken for hostility or arrogance.[4] His luck turned when he joined up with Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters.[4] Their fame grew into a TV show, and more so once they started appearing on the Grand Ole Opry.[4]\n\nChet profited off the popularity of his TV time by starting to record albums.[4] His first hit LP was \"The Galloping Guitars\" in 1949.[4] He moved to Nashville and started work as a studio musician.[4] By 1957, Chet was the head of recording operations at RCA Victor in Nashville.[4] It was in this role that he convinced RCA to outbid Columbia Records and sign Elvis Presley- a decision that made the company millions.[4]\n\nJazz had always been a strong love of his, and often in his career he was criticized by \"pure\" country musicians for his jazz influences.[2] He also said on many occasions that he did not like being called a \"country guitarist\", insisting that he was a guitarist, period.[2] Although he played 'by ear' and was a masterful improviser he was able to read music and even performed some classical guitar pieces.[2] Chet's picking style was inspired by Merle Travis, Django Reinhardt, George Barnes and Les Paul.[2] He was admired for it across music styles and geographical borders.[2] Part of Chet's talent included being able to play chords and push out a melody line at the same time, using his trademark thumb and three-finger playing style, a technique he developed trying to mimic Merle Travis' thumb and one-finger style.[3][4]\n\nChet produced records for Perry Como, Elvis Presley, the Everly Brothers, Eddy Arnold, Don Gibson, Jim Reeves, Jerry Reed, Skeeter Davis, Connie Smith, Waylon Jennings, and many other well known artists.[2] His work in developing \"Nashville Sound\" is attributed to saving country music from a persistent slump it had been suffering by working to separate it from rockabilly and attract pop music fans.[3][4] The development turned Nashville into Music City, U.S.A.[4] He was known for how down-to-earth he could be, especially with those whose music careers he helped shape.[4]\n\nChet eventually worked himself back out of the production side of music and back into playing, beginning worldwide tours in 1967.[4] He wanted to have fun again.[4]\n\nLegacy Chet Atkins died June 30, 2001, at his home in Nashville, Tennessee.[4][7] Chet had spent many years battling cancers, including colon cancer in the 70's and a brain tumor in 1997.[4] When he passed he was survived by his wife of 55 years, Leona, his daughter Merle (named after one of his heroes, Merle Travis, and Leona's mother, Merle Hancock Johnson), and two granddaughters.[4] Chet was buried in Harpeth Hills Memory Gardens, Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee.[10]\n\nAmong many honors, Chet received 14 Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and 9 Country Music Association Instrumentalist of the Year awards.[2] He was inducted into both the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[2] Chet was offered numerous honorary degrees from universities, but turned them all down for his own designation as a C.G.P., \"Certified Guitar Picker."
