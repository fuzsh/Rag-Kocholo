        "text": "SAGINAW, MI — A shooter with a jammed gun, lying in wait behind the garage, may have saved Chet Atkins' life.\n\nAtkins, 42, a former gang member and ex-con, was going legit. Recently married with a kid, Atkins was contemplating putting his past behind him.\n\nBut it wasn’t until the night he returned home from buying formula for his baby and encountered a man determined to shoot him that Atkins realized his time may have expired — in his own driveway.\n\nIt could be age, or the exhaustion of living a gangster’s lifestyle, or simply a life-changing moment when the options become clear: Live or die?\n\nA close call with a shooter did the job for Atkins.\n\nA brush with death made Otis Ray, 44, of Saginaw, step away from living dangerously, as well. In the late 1980s and early 1990s in the streets of Saginaw, Ray was once one of Atkins' main adversaries. But when Ray lost a close family member to street violence, he knew it was past time that he changed.\n\nToday, you can find the two men at Saginaw's First Ward Community Center, urging young people there to do what they say, don't do what they did.\n\nIn the beginning\n\nAtkins and Ray grew up in Saginaw as normal kids playing in their neighborhoods with friends. At some point, the camaraderie they shared with others from their neighborhoods turned them against each other.\n\nAtkins, who moved to Saginaw with his family before he was a teenager, is the youngest of his siblings. He made new friends and began to see them as a family of sorts.\n\n\"I met one guy who introduced me to another guy, and we shared some things in common,\" Atkins said. \"I felt comfortable being with them. They had my back, I had their back. A lot of times when you see cliques in the street, they are not a gang. They are a family.\"\n\nAtkins and his newfound friends would become one of the most notorious 1990s-era gangs in Saginaw — Burt Street.\n\nKnown for their red clothing and bandanas, similar to those of the Bloods in Los Angeles, Burt Street or Burt Boys originated on Saginaw's East Side in the numbered streets around the Burt, Cherry and Walnut streets.\n\nRay grew up in the Daniels Heights housing projects on Saginaw's northeast side. The highrise has since been demolished.\n\nHis group of friends became known as the Six-Four, a name that reflected its members' appreciation for 1964 Impalas. They sported blue bandanas and clothing similar to the Los Angeles gang the Compton Crips. Ray’s crew was also called the \"Project Boys.\"\n\n“We were almost all related out there in the projects,” Ray said. “We basically just wanted to protect everyone out there from outsiders coming in, causing trouble.”\n\nThe government-subsidized Daniels Heights housed impoverished families from all sides of town in Saginaw.\n\nIt was normal for people from different neighborhoods to hang out there since they more than likely had family members who lived there, Ray explained.\n\nA pledge of allegiance\n\nWith so many people from different backgrounds and neighborhoods congregating in one place, it was not long before trouble began and lines were drawn.\n\nRay and Atkins would find themselves on opposing sides.\n\nOn a basketball scholarship, Ray attended Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, for two years after his graduation from Saginaw High School in 1988. But when he came home for Thanksgiving in 1990 to visit family, he decided he wouldn't go back.\n\nHe said the conviction that he needed to stay home to protect his friends and family from rising gang tensions drove his decision.\n\n\"This was one of the first mistakes I made in my life,\" he said.\n\nRay said he \"went to a family member's house, and (Chet Atkins) was there, but we weren't rivals then.\n\n“Atkins said something about the Burt Street Bankers and what they were planning to do in the city, and I was like, 'Well, I just hope y'all don't bring it out here where we are,'\" Ray said. \"We had kids and families out here, and I didn't want what he was talking about to affect any of them.\n\n\"He said he couldn't promise me that, and at that point I told him that I was not asking him — I was telling him to keep it away.\"\n\nThe next day, Ray said, set in motion a two-year battle between the two crews.\n\nSomeone in a van fired shots near Daniels Heights, and residents suspected Burt Street. Later that day, some Burt Street members were in an altercation with some of the kids from the neighborhood, running the kids off a basketball court with bats.\n\n\"The situation escalated even worse after that as guns began to get pulled,\" Ray said. \"We went nonstop shooting at each other over that period. It wasn't safe to cut your grass.\"\n\nThe ensuing feud lasted for two years, until key arrests by law enforcement broke the gangs up.\n\nThe turning point\n\nFormer Saginaw Police Sgt. Kevin Revard said neighborhood gang violence has a history that reaches back decades.\n\nAlthough he spent most of his career on the city's South Side, dealing with gang activity from the Sunny Side and Folks gangs, he is familiar with Burt Street and the Project Boys. Revard retired in 2012.\n\n\"For the cops, the (Daniels Heights) projects were more dangerous because you had to pull in there kind of one way,\" said Revard, a 22-year Saginaw veteran who served as a road sergeant and later was the sergeant of the FBI Safe Streets Task Force, known as the \"gang task force.\"\n\n\"There was a two-man car assigned to the projects back then,\" Revard said. \"You'd pull in at night, and you never knew what you'd encounter. I mean, if they wanted to get you, they could.\"\n\nRevard said the \"number streets\" where the Burt Boys roamed were just as bad.\n\n\"There were some instances where there were home invasions and people were tied up and tortured, but people would not tell on these guys,\" Revard said.\n\nEventually, both Ray and Atkins went to prison.\n\nRay served a prison sentence from 1992-95 for extortion of a police officer. Although it was not related to the ongoing feud between the gangs, he believes his arrest and conviction were part of a larger effort to calm the violence.\n\nAtkins served a five-year sentence during the early '90s for armed robbery.\n\n\"It was the best thing that happened to me because it gave me an opportunity to reflect on my life and see where it was headed,\" Atkins said. \"I probably could have been killed or serving a life sentence by now.\"\n\nYears later, after much of the bad blood had settled and both men had grown older, Atkins said he hit a turning point.\n\n\"There were a lot of things that led up to me changing,\" he said. \"I lost my best friend, Glen Coleman, and I wanted to do something for my best friend and my kids.\n\n\"My kids gave me hope. I had something to finally live for. They gave me hope. I was struggling with my past, trying to get to my future.\"\n\nBut years of doing \"dirt\" would finally catch up to him, he said.\n\n\"At some point the hunter becomes the hunted,\" Atkins said. \"God forgives the sin, but you still gotta pay the consequences. You do dirt, and people will not forget. You will have to pay.\"\n\nAtkins found this out one evening after running to K-Mart to buy formula for his son Chance. He named him Chance because he wanted him to have a better chance at life than he had, he said.\n\n\"I came home, and a guy was waiting behind my garage to kill me,\" Atkins said. \"The gun got jammed, and I ran. When I got to the end of the sidewalk, the gun got unjammed, and he started shooting. I yelled for help, and all of the lights in my neighborhood came on.\"\n\nAtkins thought about his fiancée, now his wife of 10 years, and his infant son in the house.\n\n\"That was a turning point, but in my heart I wanted revenge,\" he said. \"I didn't go after revenge, but I wanted to.\"\n\nFred Harvey, prevention coordinator at First Ward Community Center, said he has watched Atkins over the years, and prison may have played a factor in Atkins’ eventual change.\n\n\"It took him a while to transform,\" Harvey said. \"He came to a reality that if he didn't want to go back to prison, he needed to transform.\n\n\"I was proud of him. He came into the realization that he could lose his family. Sometimes it takes failure to bring success. That's what I see in Chet.\"\n\nLoved ones lost\n\nRay came home from prison to a new reality and new rivals.\n\nThe beef with Burt Street shifted to a beef with people in his own neighborhood after his cousin Jackie King was killed.\n\nRay said his cousin King had just painted and put nice rims on a car he owned, and an altercation broke out at a club in which King's car was shot by some members of 4th and Kirk, a gang so known for the streets in its territory also known as 4KP. King wanted revenge for what he considered disrespect.\n\n\"My auntie told (King) that he could always get another car, but he can never get another life,\" Ray said.\n\nBut Ray said King was set on revenge.\n\nRay said King and some friends went looking for the people in the rival crew who shot up his car, and a gun battle ensued. After members of the 6-4 came back to \"the hood\" everyone was looking for King, but no one knew where he was. After sending some people to locate him, they came back and reported that King was dead in a field with a bullet in his head.\n\n\"That shifted our focus, we wasn't focused on Burt Street no more, we were now into it with Fourth and Kirk,\" Ray said.\n\nBut once again law enforcement defused the situation. Members of 4KP were indicted and charged with drug crimes. Many of them served lengthy sentences.\n\n\"That was the last major beef I was in,\" Ray said.\n\nIt wasn't until he lost another family member to violence that Ray left his criminal life behind.\n\n\"May 25, 2005, I can call this my Pearl Harbor. This was the day my cousin Ronell Frazier flew on,\" Ray said.\n\nRay said his cousin was called to help a friend who said someone had shot at him.\n\n\"My cousin was the type that if he was your friend, and you needed him, he was coming to help you,\" he said.\n\nFrazier was killed when he and a friend went to get revenge. Frazier was hanging out of the window of his friend's vehicle with a gun when his friend crashed into a pole, killing Frazier, Ray said.\n\n\"That took a lot out of me,\" Ray said. \"I used to wake up some days and wonder how I was going to make it through the day. We were that close.\"\n\nAfterward, Ray began coaching sports to \"stop the gangbanging generational curse.\"\n\nPart of the solution\n\nAtkins and Ray mentor kids in the same North Side neighborhood that once pitted them against each other.\n\nAs ex-cons and fathers, the former rival gang members have turned into unlikely friends. They spend their time trying to keep Saginaw's kids from repeating their mistakes.\n\nAtkins, who has since become a minister, works with youths in First Ward’s summer employment and after-school programs.\n\nHis stocky frame, bald head, barrel chest and demand for respect could be confused with a drill sergeant. But he didn't learn his respect for authority by doling out commands in the Army. He learned it by taking commands from correctional officers in prison.\n\n\"Who was pulling on that door?\" Atkins asks a group of young boys in First Ward’s game room. \"Who was pulling on the door like that?\"\n\nMoments earlier some youths were playing around a glass door in the game room. One of them pulled the door numerous times trying to open it, though Atkins had told them to keep it shut.\n\nAtkins repeats the question until one of the boys fesses up. \"I did,\" the young boy said while looking at the floor.\n\n\"Give me five pushups,\" said Atkins, of Saginaw Township. \"C'mon! Five pushups right now.\"\n\nAtkins said the kids need to learn discipline to make the right choices.\n\n\"Teach them the consequences of the small things that can be reversed,\" Atkins said. \"Then they can make better decisions when faced with problems that can't be reversed. Death can't be reversed.\"\n\nWith little hesitance, the boy pushes out five.\n\nFirst Ward's Harvey said it takes a special kind of person to work with the youths.\n\n\"Once (Atkins) adjusted to them, he fit right in,\" Harvey said. \"He is a positive, motivating force in their life. He does a really good job working with them.\"\n\nSaginawian of the Year\n\nRay, who has become a youth basketball coach and was a 2012 Saginawian of the Year, had his team of 13 boys running laps around First Ward's basketball court in late June.\n\nRay uses the basketball talent that gained him a scholarship in 1988 to teach young boys about leadership, teamwork and staying away from the streets.\n\n\"It's tournament-time this weekend,\" Ray told the gym full of boys. \"Y'all don't have time to be playing around.\"\n\nIn a game of shirts versus skins, the 6- to 12-year-old boys looked as organized as a college team. They used teamwork to execute plays, they passed the ball, looking for open shots, and there was a noticeable absence of ball-hogs.\n\nMichelle M. Campbell's 12-year-old, Anthony Campbell, plays on Ray's team. She said Ray does a great job keeping the boys busy.\n\n\"They are not sitting around all summer with nothing to do. They have something positive and productive,\" Campbell said.\n\nWhen they are not on the court, Ray's players are using their skills to fundraise so they can play in national tournaments like the one they attended in 2012 in Hawaii.\n\n\"This keeps them about 80-percent active, so they don't have time for the streets,\" Ray said. \"They learn networking and social skills from fundraising. They learn to ask people if they can cut their grass or wash their car. It shows them how to use their skills in a positive way to make money.\"\n\nCampbell, 51, said she has known Ray since he was a child. She said she wishes more ex-cons would do more to help out in Saginaw.\n\n\"He was always intelligent,\" Campbell said. \"People think because you go to prison, you are ignorant and dumb. Sometimes young people just make a wrong choice.\"\n\nCampbell said she commends Ray for not letting his past stop him from caring for the kids.\n\n\"I really care for (Ray),\" Campbell said. \"People have tried to talk me out of having my child around him because he went to prison. I already knew that he went to prison, though. I trust him with my child. We need more like him.\"\n\nFor Ray, the decision to work with young people was a personal and a civic one.\n\n“I just felt that it was time for me to become a part of the solution,\" he said, \"and stop being a part of the problem in our city.”\n\nBob Johnson is a general assignment reporter for MLive/The Saginaw News.
