She was devastated and left the room in tears, it didn't phase\n\nhim and he continued as though nothing happened. I never took another\n\nmaster class from him again.\n\nI think that if Segovia thought that Atkins was anything except a purist, he\n\nwould have asked Atkins to leave sooner.\n\n--\n\nrsl...@global.california.com\n\nJohn Sloan wrote in message <2D7102...@telusplanet.net>...\n\n>I once saw a picture in a book by Chet Atkins showing\n\n>him sitting next to Segovia, watching Segovia as the\n\n>latter tuned his guitar.

That's life. That's art.\n\nAs well written as Rog's synopsis is, it opens up for me a wider space of\n\ntolerance for the old Spanish Spud.\n\nThe key question to my mind is Rog's, \"Could a less relentless\n\npersonality...?\" Poignant and difficult to counter the assertion this\n\nquestion posits, I'd say.\n\nAll I remember of him when I was a kid is how scared I was of him. I\n\nthought if I coughed at his Massey Hall concerts in Toronto, he'd have\n\nhad my entrails for next day's lunch. Once a guy's coughing did incite the\n\nmaestro to stop-mid fugue. He raised his hand in a rather limp but direct\n\nway, like an emperor, like Augustus would do, and waited while an usher\n\nescorted the hacker out of the hall. I was only 10 seats away wondering\n\nwhat he did to kids who peed their pants. Probably killed them, I figured.\n\nOr worse, made them do those bird-scales two hours everyday for his\n\ntorture practice just for a laugh.\n\nLuckily, I got out alive, if damp, and slight uric. Even my father was\n\nscared of Segovia, and my dad was pretty tough, a working class guy with\n\nfingernails that looked like 40 miles of bad road, who knew the manifold\n\nutilities of a tire iron. But I think Segovia would've still kicked my\n\ndad's ass, maybe killed him too, with a flying elbow smash from the top\n\nrope. Or a camel-clutch. Even at 95, which I think he was for the last 30\n\nyears of his life, like Clint Eastwood.\n\nSo, all is all, our family, the Ashleys, was pretty scared of Segovia.\n\n...just a sec...\n\n\"MOM, were you scared of Segovia. ?.the newsgroup wants to know!\"\n\nwha?\n\nsay what?! Oh, okay.\n\nShe said, 'Ya,' but not as much as long as she took the big potato masher\n\nto Massey Hall. I didn't know she did that. Had I known, I might have felt\n\na little safer. Mom, I love you.\n\nIs is any wonder, though, I still can't stomach mashed potatoes to this\n\nday?\n\nRegards,\n\nRib\n\nPaul wrote:\n\n>it seems to have been almost historically fated that\n\n>someone like Segovia arrive on the scene.\n\n>\n\nI don't think anything is historically fated.\n\n>By the way, how do ´'serious musicians' regard the guitar today -- or\n\n>guitarists -- today?\n\n>\n\n>\n\nThat's a great question. I have had the unsatisfying experience of taking\n\nother musicians to guitar concerts which left them disappointed and confused.\n\nThey don't \"get it\" because either the perfomance itself or the very sound of\n\nthe instrument is not sufficient to \"hook\" them. The guitar is vastly popular\n\nbut despite all development of playing and repertoire the classical guitar is\n\nlargely relegated to niche or \"cult\" status. I love the poetic, suggestive\n\naspect which so befits our instrument but you know how well poetry sells these\n\ndays.\n\nThis weekend I heard Michael Chapdelaine say that he has seen classical guitar\n\naudiences dwindle steadily the past few years (since the death of Segovia,\n\nIMO). He is now playing the steel string guitar (amplified) in an effort to\n\ncrossover. Parkening, ever paying hommage to Segovia, is able to crossover and\n\nattract people to classical guitar but he is villified by the pillars of the\n\ncult.\n\nI really like something Chapdelaine said in a master class: We are not\n\npriests, we are entertainers. Hardly profound, but just a statement of fact\n\nfrom his point of view. At the worst his views are tinged with defeatism but is\n\nhe a defeatist or a realist? Close call.\n\nI don't buy all of his iconoclastic observations but I like that he is\n\nimplementing them by following his muse and trying to show a way to make\n\ncontact with a larger audience. His demeanor is a bit world-weary but he\n\nspeaks and plays with passion and focus. He is sincere in his concern for the\n\nguitar and I wish him success. He is certainly a fine guitarist and has the\n\ntrue spirit of an artist who feels thwarted by forms which he seeks to\n\novercome.\n\nI hope that what is really going on these days is that we are experiencing a\n\ncyclical phenomenon. Since World War II the intense interest in the guitar has\n\npropelled it to higher levels of development but the natural response to the\n\nsaturation is a shift toward other forms, even though the playing is generally\n\nmuch better than before. We might expect another wave of interest at some\n\npoint in the future, perhaps at the advent of the next guitar messiah.\n\n\n\nOn Wed, 1 Mar 2000, John Rethorst wrote:\n\n> Picasso was also said not to be much fun to be around.

It makes artists' lives that\n\n> much more of a puzzle.\n\nTo me, the puzzle is not. Western tradition has made it its pet project to\n\nfashion a social construction of the artist as a transcendant being,\n\nsomething of a moral arbitrator who sits 'up there'. The term 'masses' was\n\ncoined by an artists, someone like 'Yeats' or 'Pound' both of whom were\n\nlike typical poets--utterly stupid in matters but their own craft, but so\n\nstupid as to think they could still pronounce on them, much as I am doing\n\nright now.\n\nPrior to the Renaissance artists were on par, in terms of social repute,\n\nwith masons, carpenters, bakers, and electricians, though I concede that\n\nthere were many fewer electricians back then, and even fewer jobs for\n\nthem. This is why they hung low for a few centuries, until the economy got\n\nbetter. The guild, however, fell away to patronage of individuals by other\n\nindividuals. Another word for 'schmoozing' you might say.\n\nThe recent thread we had about performer histrionics evolves out the\n\ntradition, a romantic perspective which held that artists looked through a\n\nwindow of imaginative genius, a window unavailable to anyone else. And it\n\nwas dramatic! I think if some Romantics and Moderns had had their way,\n\nthey would have declared themselves a new species, something that had\n\nevolved upward from those low creatures, that is, the rest of us.\n\nThe great benefit, however, is that whenever you witness the overarching,\n\noverwheening, self-aggrandizing antics of someone calling themselve an\n\nartist, you at least know you are in the presence of a weak, parsitic\n\nmind. Weak, for all this person has done is to allow the transcendental\n\nmyth to set up its structures in his mind, unimpeded by critical or\n\ncreative scrutiny. Just like kid who gets sucked into a breakfast cereal\n\n'cause the ad is cool. If you come across a sulking braggart of an artists\n\nwhose attitudes are top-down you can assure yourself that you've\n\nencountered a conformist of the highest caliber. Someone whose sophmoric\n\nideas of logic finds a causal relation between the vestments and the\n\nverisimilutude of his craft. Like an adolescent's judgment of self-worth\n\nby the name on the label of the jeans they wear [and underwear, and\n\njacket, and socks, and cap, and shoes, and...well ad lib]\n\nThis is yet another reason why we should hail of the genius of a Chet\n\nAtkins, who never fell for this artistic moralizing crap. But it is also\n\ngood reason to cast knitted brow towards the likes of stupid artists who\n\nmake of art their own pompous parade. I think art and ethics are different\n\nspheres of enquiry and it's embarrassing to see artists, fools they\n\nsometimes are, passing sentence on everyone else as they were magistrates\n\nand the rest defendants. Something wicked this way came during the\n\nRenaissance, something pathological. Fortunately, the beast is dull and\n\nslow moving.\n\nAnd also I'm glad that now we've got more electricians. It evens things\n\nout, shows that there is still room to hope.\n\nRegards,\n\nRib\n\nOn Wed, 1 Mar 2000, John Wasak wrote:\n\n> John Rethorst <jxret...@post.com> wrote :\n\n> >\n\n> > Picasso was also said not to be much fun to be around.

There is no compelling reason to say\n\nthat fine art demands a lick more than these other things. Genius manifest\n\nis manifold.

This is\n\nthe history of art, neoclassicism is born out of its disdain for the\n\nRococco, and Modernism, like your satire of sentiment and the pastorale\n\nabove, has no use for the Victorian. The point is that there is fundament\n\nof 'deep' or constellation of 'high' that we call in to decide the matter\n\nof what is real art.

Is not an\n\nartist automatically a performer when 'audience' enters the picture? I\n\nguess in our chain of loose definitions we might just as well add\n\n'audience'.\n\nI'd suggest (yet another generalization) that the modern artist, at least,\n\nholds his audience in contempt. The\n\nnovelists/poets/painters/dancers/musicians, many of these were anti-social\n\nsulkers, disaffected, alienated, miserable saps. You had to be lest you be\n\ncharged with flirting with the unwashed. This why people like Pound were\n\nsuckers for fascism, and Yeats had his own ideas about a shiloh. Contempt\n\nfor non-artists was daily bread for these fools. More contemporary, John\n\nLennon, brilliant as he was, was as naive as kitten, politically. I see\n\nhim as being the very last Modernist. An era died when he did.\n\nI think I'd opt to leave out the word 'response' in Rog's statement. Yes,\n\nartists have need for the masses, but often not for responding to, but\n\nrather for exploiting the artistic raw materials. Art is not created ex\n\nnihilio, but in a socio-cultural context, inescapably, and hence, the\n\nartist has nothing if he has not the culture he is born into. Art is not\n\ncreated from within. It is stolen from without chewed surreptiously, then\n\nbarfed back under the false pretense that is 'orginal'.\n\nLet me go out on an even thinner limb: Culture and communities make all\n\nthe stuff of art and it is merely the job of artists to act in the role of\n\npimples charged with bringing the stuff to the surface. Performance is\n\nmerely the final squeeze.\n\nAnd maybe this is why artists are often so sore with people.\n\nRegards,\n\nRib\n\nHi all,\n\nThis thread sent me to my attic. I just got out with my dusty box of vinyl\n\nrecords ... my quarry, an album I bought years ago entitled: The First\n\nNashville Guitar Quartet. Unfortunately, I cannot play the album as I no\n\nlonger own a turntable. But, be that as it may, it was produced in\n\nNashville with a copyright of 1979, RCA. The players in the quartet: Chet\n\nAtkins, Liona Boyd, John Knowles, and John Pell.\n\nI remember listening to the ten pieces many times and Chet definitely played\n\na classical guitar with a noticeably unique sound. I wonder if he used a\n\nthumb pick? Although not in all the pieces, I do remember noticing the\n\ncontrast between the other players with their more traditional classical\n\nsound and Chet with his unique articulation of some lead phrasing. The\n\npieces: Carolina Shout, Londonderry Air, Love Song of Pepe Sanchez, Skirts\n\nof Mexico, You Needed Me, Bound For Boston, Washington Post March, Someday\n\nMy Prince Will Come, Rings of Grass, Rodrigo Concerto, and Brandenburg.\n\nThere is an interesting quote from Chet on the jacket: \"As a musician, to\n\nkeep things interesting I've always tried to grow and expand into new areas.\n\nIn this album, I am proud to be a part of a quartet made up of some super\n\nguitarists...\"\n\nI saw Chet in concert in Charlotte about two years ago. He was quite good,\n\nhumorous and very entertaining. He mostly played a hollow bodied electric\n\nwith blistering speed. However, he played an arrangement of Vincent on an\n\nelectric classical, with alternate tuning, that was truly beautiful. He\n\njoked as he finished the piece that he could never make it all the way\n\nthrough it without a few mistakes.\n\nKeep playing,\n\nRick\n\n\"Richard Roti\" <blue...@worldnet.att.net> schrieb im Newsbeitrag\n\nnews:9XAv4.6880$Ns2.4...@bgtnsc04-news.ops.worldnet.att.net...\n\n\n\nThis is all very interesting. As a European, I have only a vague idea, who\n\nChet Atkins is (I know, big faux-pas). I think I played an arrangement of\n\nhis in Guitar Player. What I can associate to, is this crossover idea, which\n\nis so modern nowadays. As things go in life, I still have this book of Mario\n\nAbril's 101 intermediate solos for the classical guitar, which my parents\n\nbought for me, when I was 12. It has an almost surrealistic repertoire, with\n\narrangements of The Godfather, Fascination, She'll be comin' round the\n\nmountain, Londonderry Air, and also Milan, Haendel, Sor and Tarrega. These\n\nthings are great, because they get people connected. I still have this Liona\n\nBoyd record, Miniatures for the Guitar, no turntable, but I do remember\n\navidly listening to it. Now I hear you speaking of the Boyd/Atkins\n\ncollaboration, and, wham, another synapse in place. How stupid and\n\nsuperfluous the new Metallica record sometimes may seem, it does more\n\ntowards promoting classical music, than a hundred Koyunbabas will. I learn\n\nmore about guitar from Friday Night in San Francisco or Uwe Kropinski or\n\nHendrix at Woodstock, than from another complete recording of the Bach lute\n\nsuites. Expanding into new areas, this is the right thing.\n\nKlaus\n\nP.S. If somebody would honor me with a short resume of Chet's life, I would\n\nbe most appreciate.\n\n\"Mark Westling\" <mwes...@earthlink.net> wrote:\n\n>I also saw Chet perform in San Juan Capistrano, CA a few years a go, and his\n\n>performance, delivery and humility were all touching.\n\n>\n\n>I have a copy of the John Knowles arrangement of \"Vincent\" that Chet Atkins\n\n>plays.

We ordered each a guitar,\n\nand just by chance, Chet had just returned the guitar that he showed\n\non TV because he got another one. So I bought it right then and there.\n\nSilly ol' me, I sold it to a friend in Israel some months later. The\n\none he made for me, I still have. This is the one Roger Thurman\n\nrefinished for me last year, and the one I keep by the computer when I\n\nedit stuff. Hascal passed away quite some time ago and I don't expect\n\nChet would be still playing his guitars, nevertheless, interesting to\n\nfind out.\n\n\n\nOn Tue, 29 Feb 2000 20:44:08 -0500, \"Paul Miller\"\n\n<Paul...@email.msn.com> wrote:\n\n>I can't stop thinking about another post I read here a few months back,\n\n>about Segovia's attitude towards Barrios.
