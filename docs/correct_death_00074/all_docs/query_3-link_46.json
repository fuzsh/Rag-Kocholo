        "text": "(1924–2001). Influential American country-and-western guitarist and record company executive Chet Atkins was often credited with developing the Nashville Sound. That sound, popular in the 1960s, mixed pop elements into country music.\n\nChester Burton Atkins was born on June 20, 1924, in Luttrell, Tennessee, into a musical family. He began playing the guitar as a child and during his teen years performed professionally as a fiddler. By the late 1940s Atkins had become a sought-after session guitarist. His signature finger-picking style used three fingers to pick the melody while the thumb supplied bass rhythm. Atkins’s first solo album was Chet Atkins’ Gallopin’ Guitar (1953), and he produced more than 100 recordings in his own name and hundreds more as a backing musician. During his career, his picking changed little, although his material and collaborators varied widely. His recordings ranged from old-time mountain music to contemporary rock and jazz.\n\nAtkins also pursued a parallel career in the music industry as a nonperformer, acting as a talent scout and record producer and serving as vice president of the RCA Corporation (1968–79). In charge of RCA’s Nashville studios from 1957, Atkins helped introduce electric instruments and polished arrangements, broadening the popular appeal of the country music genre. Atkins won many Grammy Awards, and he was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1973. He died on June 30, 2001, in Nashville, Tennessee."
