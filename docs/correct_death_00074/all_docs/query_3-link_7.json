        "text": "Chet Atkins (born June 20, 1924, Luttrell, Tennessee, U.S.—died June 30, 2001, Nashville, Tennessee) was an influential American country-and-western guitarist and record company executive who is often credited with developing the Nashville Sound.\n\nBorn into a musical family, Atkins began playing the guitar as a child and during his teen years performed professionally as a fiddler. By the late 1940s he had become a sought-after session guitarist. His signature finger-picking style (three fingers picking the melody while the thumb supplied bass rhythm) was largely derived from that of Merle Travis. From his first solo album, Chet Atkins’ Gallopin’ Guitar (1953), through more than 100 recordings in his own name and hundreds more as a backing musician, Atkins’s picking changed little, although his material and collaborators varied widely. His recordings range from old-time mountain music to contemporary rock and jazz."
