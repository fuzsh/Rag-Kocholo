        "text": "I just bought a used Gibson CE on ebay. Decent ones go for $1000-$1400. The more nicks start lowering the price down around $900. Vintage guitar list them for $1100-$1400 in excellent condition. Watchout for the \"2nd\" or \"demo\" or other stamped guitars being sold. Although they are probably just as good, their original price did not start that high and they should not demand a high price most people are trying to get out them. I don't care how nice they are I would not pay over $700 for one. The one I bought is a '91 with two repaired nicks on top, otherwise in great condition for $1000. I've known pro's who have tried the Godin. They all got rid of them. My thinking was with the Gibson that if I didn't overpay for it I could always get my money back. If you look at the Godin there's a ton of them out there and they're not selling. If you can get a nice one for $750 or less you should be able to get your money back if you want to sell it. Otherwise you'll take a big hit if you can sell it.\n\nHi - I have a Chet Atkins CE and a Larrivee acoustic. Will either or both work with my Fender Deluxe Reverb, and if so, which hole should I plug in to - normal or high gain?\n\nThe reason I'm asking this stuff is that my son passed away and I inherited them. I used to just \"noodle\" on my PRS and the Reverb. I am 77 and had lung cancer last year and it was on my \"bucket list\" to start trying the Larrivee and the Atkins but didn't know if they would screw up my amp or what.\n\nI just want to sit around at home - no public stuff. I'm not really worried about precise sound, just good enough to enjoy.\n\nIf I did decide to get a preamp or acoustic amp, can someone suggest some good economy models?"
