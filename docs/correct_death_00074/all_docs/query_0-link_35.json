        "text": "Lawrence William Knechtel (August 4, 1940 – August 20, 2009) was an American keyboard player and bassist who was a member of the Wrecking Crew, a collection of Los Angeles–based session musicians who worked with such renowned artists as Simon & Garfunkel, Duane Eddy, the Beach Boys, the Mamas & the Papas, the Monkees, the Partridge Family, Billy Joel, the Doors, the Byrds, the Grass Roots,[1] Jerry Garcia, and Elvis Presley. He also was a member of the 1970s band Bread.\n\nBiography\n\nBorn in Bell, California, in 1940, Knechtel began his musical education with piano lessons. In 1957, he joined the Los Angeles–based rock and roll band Kip Tyler and the Flips. In August 1959, he joined instrumentalist Duane Eddy as a member of his band the Rebels. After four years on the road with the band, and continuing to work with Eddy in the recording studio, Knechtel became part of the Los Angeles session musician scene, working with Phil Spector as a pianist to help create Spector's famous \"Wall of Sound\". Knechtel became a prominent member of session musicians the Wrecking Crew, performing on many hit songs of the period[2] and earning him entry into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2007. During his time with the Wrecking Crew, he recorded the album The In Harmonica, playing harmonica under the name \"Larry Nelson\", with backing by other Wrecking Crew members.[3]\n\nIn 1970, Knechtel won a Grammy Award for his piano work on \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" by Simon and Garfunkel. He also played the piano on Johnny Rivers' 1972 hit \"Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu\".\n\nKnechtel joined soft rock band Bread in 1971 after the departure of Robb Royer and remained with the band until their split in 1973. He rejoined the band for subsequent comebacks and reunions.\n\nKnechtel was proficient on other musical instruments, notably the harmonica, guitar, and bass, which can be heard on \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" by the Byrds, \"Stoney End\" by Barbra Streisand, \"If I Can Dream\" by Elvis Presley, and the Doors' debut album. In 1971, he joined the band Bread, where his contributions included bass, keyboards, and the guitar solo on the hit single \"The Guitar Man\". He also played on sessions for Nancy Sinatra.\n\nDuring the late 1980s, Knechtel moved to Nashville, where he was signed to a solo recording contract. He released two solo albums in quick succession, Mountain Moods (1989)[4] and Urban Gypsy (1990).[5]\n\nIn later years, Knechtel lived in semi-retirement in Yakima, Washington, until his death. He had, however, worked with record producer Rick Rubin, contributing keyboards to albums by Neil Diamond, Arlen Roth and the Dixie Chicks, touring with Elvis Costello and with the Dixie Chicks in support of their Grammy Award-winning album Taking the Long Way. During this time, Knechtel contributed guest spots on many recordings for dozens of Northwest artists including Wayman Chapman, Ken Stringfellow (Posies, R.E.M., Big Star), Quakers On Probation, Dimestore Mystery, Elba, Animals at Night, Zera Marvel, Colin Spring, Lesley Rostron & Lovejunkie, and his son, Lonnie Knechtel.\n\nKnechtel died on August 20, 2009, in Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital, Washington, at the age of 69 of an apparent heart attack.[6]\n\nAwards and recognition\n\nIn 2007, Knechtel, along with the other members of the Wrecking Crew, was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nDiscography\n\nSolo discography\n\nThe In Harmonica (1965, as Larry Nelson)\n\nMountain Moods (1989)[7]\n\nUrban Gypsy (1990)[8]\n\nSession work\n\nWith The Everly Brothers\n\n• Beat & Soul (Warner Brothers,1965)\n\nWith the Byrds\n\nMr. Tambourine Man (Columbia, 1965)\n\n\"Glory, Glory\" on the album Byrdmaniax (1971)\n\nWith the We Three Trio\n\nThe We Three Trio (Mainstream S/6055,56055, 1965)\n\nWith Barbra Streisand\n\nStoney End (Columbia Records, 1971)\n\nBarbra Joan Streisand (Columbia Records, 1971)\n\nWith the Beach Boys\n\nPet Sounds (Capitol, 1966)[9]\n\nWith The Doors\n\nThe Doors (Elektra, 1967)\n\nWith Elvis Presley\n\nElvis Presley (RCA, 1968)\n\nWith Cher\n\nStars (Warner Bros.
