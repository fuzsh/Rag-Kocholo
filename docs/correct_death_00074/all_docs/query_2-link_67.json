        "text": "THE GUITAR AND ROMANTICISM (I) \"The supposed decline of the guitar in the 19th century was not due, as A. Gilardino explains, to the absence of masters capable of maintaining its prestige and popularity, but to the changing general conditions in the history of music. Gilardino explains, to the absence of masters capable of maintaining its prestige and popularity, but to the changing general conditions of the history of music. The Romantic aesthetic brought with it a preference for bombastic sonorities (which did not go well with the intimate and recollected sound of the guitar) and a broadening of the dimensions of instrumental ensembles\". (From the book \"Ideales y melancol√≠as. Regino Sainz de la Maza y la guitarra en el siglo XX en Espa√±a\" by Leopoldo Neri de Caso). This brief commentary summarises the opinion perpetuated by generations of guitarists about the causes that led the guitar away from the musical paths taken by the romantic movement. It is enough to familiarise oneself with the music of Schubert, Schumann, Mendelshon or Chopin to realise that the great majority of their technical and expressive proposals that appear in it remained alien to the writing for our instrument. The work of 19th century guitar composers such as Coste, Matiegka, Mertz, Bobrowicz, Regondi, Ferranti, Damas, Parga or Arcas did not address most of the morphological, formal and expressive aspects of the language developed by those great composers, which was the reason why the guitar gradually ceased to be a focus of interest for the music-loving public. Given this reality, it is not surprising that the work of T√°rrega and Barrios - who for the first time, at the end of the century, proposed a language of melodic-harmonic components coming from the music of Schumann or Chopin - aroused interest, but, even so, it must be said that their romantic inspiration was short-lived and still did not contribute to the guitar most of the syntactic achievements that define that movement. It is obvious, then, that the above commentary does not adequately address the reasons for this supposed decline and I suggest that we analyse the statements it contains in order to highlight how debatable and nuanced they are and point to what, in my view, was the real cause of the guitar's decline, was the real cause of the guitar's decline and practically null participation in an aesthetic movement which, having been decisive for the development of technique and instrumental expression (and, in general, for the language of music in the West), did not have the desired impact on the development of its repertoire. (Continued)\n\nStop being ‚Äúafraid‚Äù to jam with better musicians GUITAR CHEFS. Look, I get it. You‚Äôre afraid to jam with superior musicians because you feel like you won‚Äôt be able to keep up with them, or you‚Äôll look bad by comparison, they make you nervous, etc. But what I can tell you from my personal experience is usually they will be very welcoming. I mean, there may be a guy there who is just genuinely an asshole, but fuck him. You don‚Äôt wanna jam with him anyway. Generally, higher-level musicians will feel complimented by your insecurity. It‚Äôs a weird thing but, just trust me bro. I would gladly welcome a lower-tier player to jam for a song or 2. I mean if they started asking to form a band or something then we might have some problems, but jamming with superior musicians is how you grow as a musician yourself. It might feel intimidating, but that‚Äôs what growth feels like. If you never feel intimidated, you never grow. And I find not progressing way scarier than the temporary pain of putting myself out there. So accept that yes, it might make you nervous, AND that‚Äôs okay. You‚Äôre welcome for being the nicest person in the world! 52 Week Guitar Player is closed until mid-March. We‚Äôll only be accepting 100 new students when we reopen. Our last cohort sold out in 2 days. Join the waiting list now dammit. https://lnkd.in/gPnBTtgb Okay, bye. - Brandon Show less\n\nHere's a story for you - A guy used to play Synth since childhood. He bought his first local branded acoustic guitar in his high school and tried to switch instrument. With blistered fingers and the cheap guitar quality, and eventually got the first chords right. In final year of college, he got his first branded Gibson LesPaul model and it was butterfingers! 2016 - He played a few gigs in inter-college fests and started recording bits and pieces of music on mobile audio clips. 2017 - He got his hands on a Digital Audio Workstation but was tough because of his limited knowledge of sound and primitive recording equipments. Audio clips had to be discarded due to the slightest background noises (vehicles) and redone. This would go on for a few years. It was tedious work. It was slow. 2021 - He recorded and released a few guitar tracks in poor edition. It was okay, but not good enough. Time went by. 2022 - Coping up with career and profession, he produced new music videos with a better mixing, watching videos and learning. 2023 - He decided to buy his first audio interface for recording Guitar. Learning this was another feat of patience. End of year he bought a 7 string Guitar. Now the sound was finally up to the mark. 2024 - After a year of recording and mixing new soundtracks, he finally had a few songs to publish them as an Artist's Album üî• That guy is ME. I wanted to share my story because I owed it to the time I spent and the countless hours I worked in silence for a decade. Today is a milestone because I am very excited to share my first album release - 'SYLLABLES' across all music platforms!ü•Çü•Ç I know for some of y'all it may be a bore to read all this, but I wanted to take some time to write it down just in case someone is reading and reached the end. Thank you for that, and if you've reached the end, you may want to come a little further and check out the album links in the comments below! ‚ò∫Ô∏è üíØ #success #growth #music #album #achievement #release\n\nI can't help just noticing quality issues. I'm a guitar player, and I'm a Van Halen fan. There's a company called Lick Library. They offer instructions videos for how to play the guitar for various bands. The Eagles, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Bon Jovi... They released a \"classic albums\" DVD. 1984 by Van Halen was included in the set. When I went to the page to read about the DVD, it said, \"...each song from this Acoustic Gem...\" Now, one thing Van Halen were never renowned for were there acoustic compositions. Not to say that they weren't capable of acoustic numbers, but, for the most part, Eddie would always say how the songs should be played loud. They weren't an \"unplugged\" band. Certainly, in the case of 1984, if someone told you it was an Acoustic Gem, you'd be rather shocked by that definition. So I sent off an email, and I highlighted how there was an error in the description. I received an email thanking me and a request for my address tomsend me something. I received a copy of the DVD where I was pleased to read that the text had been changed to: \"each song from this Hard Rock Gem...\" I was expecting a sticker or something. I recall this story, only because I'm revisiting it. I want to learn the solo and some other guitar parts from Jump. There's a house band that play the song at a Jam night, but the guitarist doesn't play certain hooks or the solo to resemble the original. So, again, from a quality perspective, if I can learn it (and there's huge emphasis on the \"if\" here), then I can get up and play along with them, and have the song included more elements of how it was recorded. Even though, in this case, there's only really me who would be receptive of these inclusions to the song. But then, I'd have that quality in my locker, and it might just unlock the door for me to tackle Eruption. But one step at a time, eh?\n\nRichie Sambora's Guitar: A Soundtrack Etched in My Autistic Soul (Since 1988!) Since my early teens, blasting #BonJovi from my bedroom speakers in 1988, the New Jersey album era, music has been the air I breathe. Richie Sambora's guitar wasn't just background noise; it was a conversation my soul craved. His riffs and solos weren't melodies, but constellations charting the course of my burgeoning imagination. They ignited a fire within me, a symphony waiting to be composed. Seeing Richie grace the cover of Guitar Player Magazine is a full-circle moment ‚Äì a dream come true for a lifelong fan. His interview, a whispered truth echoing through the years, resonated deep within me. \"MY HOUSE, MAN, it's a music church,\" he declares, describing his home studio. The image of him creating in a familiar space, his \"Kitchen Studios,\" sparked a revolution in my own artistic spirit. For years, as a home recording artist and autistic adult, I felt trapped by the myth of needing fancy studios to create quality music. Richie's story, along with the boundless potential of modern technology, shatters those limitations. Especially for autistic individuals, a haven like a \"Living Room Studio\" becomes a sanctuary. It's a space where anxieties melt away, and the music flows with the freedom of a rushing river. This connection with Richie Sambora transcends fandom. If you haven't already, pick up the latest Guitar Player Magazine and lose yourself in Richie's journey with Bon Jovi, the art of songwriting, and his unwavering devotion to music. #AutismAcceptance #LivingRoomStudios #MusicHeals #GuitarPlayerMagazine #RichieSambora #SongwritingSoul #NeverStopCreating\n\nLife lessons from my son üòä When Luke was a young lad he said he wanted to learn to play the guitar - so we got him a very cheap Fender Strat copy and a tiny (and very tinny) amp, along with a 'teach yourself guitar' book. We told him, if you can go through that book and get to the point where you can play some recognisable tunes, we will pay for proper guitar lessons. He did, and we did! As he progressed, we went along to Open Mic Nights at a couple of local pubs, and he began to participate - rather self consciously at first... But he stuck at it because he loved it. He formed a teen guitar band and started breaking into the London pub music scene - initially playing to a handful of people (one of them being me!). I asked him at the time what his goal was, and his instant reply was that he wanted to play the Main Stage at Reading Festival and hear the crowd sing his lyrics to him. Luke has now written many songs, and played many gigs - including SXSW in Austin TX and Glastonbury Festival. The pictures capture his progress... Last night he played a sold out show in London to launch his second album, and while he hasn't got to Reading yet (that goal may have changed), the crowd are singing his lyrics these days üòé Here's a short video from the gig: https://lnkd.in/eZh6_hAc Is he a household name? No Is he loving the journey? Without a doubt Here are the lessons that I draw, and that I share with the Engineers and Tech Pros when training and coaching them to communicate and present with confidence and clarity, and to really engage the people they're with... 1. Practice out loud! Whether you are preparing to kick off a meeting or give a full-on demo or presentation - practicing out loud has so many benefits, amongst them you'll find out whether what sounded good in your head is actually less powerful or even clunky when said out loud AND you'll get a good idea of timings. 2. Get out there and do it! Look for opportunities to actually do the thing you're most concerned about... Taking a presentation as an example, if it's worth giving - then it's worth giving badly (as you practice) until you can give it well, but the faster you move to doing it in real life, the quicker your progression. 3. Playing the smaller audiences/lower key venues is part of the journey, and is required to make your way forward. Taking things one step at a time is the only way to true mastery. There are no short cuts to anywhere worth going. 4. Be true to yourself. Luke went through the teen guitar band phase, and came out as a multi-instrumental artist, making the music that he wants to. 5. Make sure you're doing something you genuinely love - the IASM in EnthusIASM stands for 'I Am Sold Myself', and if you're not, people will smell it a mile off. Attitudes are contagious! 6. Having a well defined goal to progress towards is absolutely key to success. If you would like to check out Luke's music on Spotify, here's the link: https://lnkd.in/ezWrQrmZ\n\nIf anyone has listened to Jeff Buckley, then you‚Äôre probably familiar with his piercing, singular vocals and minor key guitar compositions. Or his rendition of Hallelujah. For me, he‚Äôs one of those artists that I seek to learn more about. That I study, really. As he‚Äôs one of the original zucchinis. There‚Äôs a certain aspect to the rhythms and crescendos he builds that I place in the same terrain of mastery I would Bon Iver, Joplin, or Queen. It‚Äôs as if his music reaches into the reservoir and returns with notes dipped in a tone from another world. _ Last night, I was having one of my cabernet avocado evenings, sitting on the couch, listening to his album ‚ÄúYou and I.‚Äù There‚Äôs a track he presses that very much registers like a secret. In it, he‚Äôs building toward a bridge, where a strumming pattern elevates into muddy chords, and he slows it to a crawl, only to whisper‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYou and I, you and I‚Ä¶ all‚Ä¶ for‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶‚Äù Eventually he stops playing entirely, saying: ‚ÄúI heard the people singing that in a dream.‚Äù He explains that he dreamed the song was about a person singing to their lover‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúThe lover has forbidden anyone to have contact with him‚Ä¶ the lover has taken away his freedom, taken away his days and nights‚Ä¶ forbidden him to get close to anyone.‚Äù For those that want to listen, I won‚Äôt spoil the ending. But in that moment, it‚Äôs like Buckley has escaped the shackles of space and time and leapt into the walls. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs offering his dream to the world, just to say, here, settle, you‚Äôre allowed in. ‚Äì When I think about what we‚Äôre doing at Copycat (and the state of marketing as a whole), there‚Äôs a quality captured in Jeff Buckley‚Äôs music that inspires what I want to convey about our narrative work. We‚Äôre in an era where AI is democratizing content creation. And as these tools have become more accessible, content volume has reached screeching heights‚Ä¶ while the quality has all but dulled to a monotonous cauliflower. It‚Äôs as if the creative spirit of marketing is being locked away, forbidden to have any contact with the world, taken away its days and nights, forbidden to get close to strategy. It‚Äôs all just 1s and 0s now. And perhaps in that, there‚Äôs a silver lining. The apricots have arrived. Can‚Äôt you hear them? They‚Äôre lined up on the horizon, singing a chorus that validates the individual on the other side of the screen. They‚Äôre calling for companies to remember why they exist‚Äîto be in service. And to reflect that in their messaging. Say to the world‚Ä¶ here, settle, you‚Äôre allowed in. *You and I‚Ä¶ *You and I‚Ä¶ All for you. _ Today marks the two week countdown for the launch of our Narrative Agency. These lyrics have become my anthem.\n\nWhat is the best guitar riff of all time? Our poll of 2,000 music fans saw Sweet Child O‚Äô Mine by Guns n‚Äô Roses chosen as the best ‚Äì more than 35 years after its release. In second place was Prince‚Äôs Purple Rain with Sultans of Swing by Dire Straits coming third. OnePoll‚Äôs latest research for PREMIER and Sky looked at iconic rock band songs, to see which ones would make the top 20 ‚Äòbest guitar riffs of all time‚Äô. Brits identified classics rock tunes from ACDC to the Arctic Monkeys and explored what they felt made the most memorable tunes. üé∏ 83% said they prefer music with guitars in it. üéµ 81% said a memorable guitar riff was vital to a good rock song. üîä 30% of music fans feel the ‚Äògolden age‚Äô of the riff was the 1970‚Äôs. A spokesperson for Sky Arts said: ‚ÄúAmong music fans, the guitar is absolutely essential to making sure you‚Äôre hitting the right notes. Across all genres, its impact is undoubted and its coolness unquestionable ‚Äì as seen by our survey results.‚Äù We also found that 53% worry the guitar riff is dying out and 74% believe that‚Äôs a bad thing. 65% feel the guitar is one of the coolest instruments you can play and 58% said the electric guitar is the most important instrument when it comes to making a song great.
