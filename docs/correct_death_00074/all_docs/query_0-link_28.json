He was drawing a gray wolf he had just killed in Mr. Vines’s pasture. The honor of getting the wolf should partly belong to the noble hound that accompanied him. The animal had ben following the wolf from Popple River and came as near Greenwood as Mr. Estabrok’s farm, having commenced to cold track at 3 o’clock in the morning. The wolf has a family of young somewhere in the vicinity which will be found if possible. This one brings the number caught by the Aikins brothers up to twenty-one this spring. There live men so mean in this country that they have tried to shoot this splendid hound while running wolves. He has lost all of his “narrative” but about 2 inches from some villains’s shot. The hound never leaves the wolf track for deer or any other animals, so if his voice is heard, do not try to kill him as the sheep raisers of this country are intereted in saving his life. “Eaton Center Annals” collection of newspaper articles\n\nMarch 8, 1906: Verne Aikins took his wife to town Saturday, where she will stay with her mother while taking medical treatment.

GREENWOOD GLEANER\n\n“...Alfred Charles Alton, born in Vermont, September 30, 1833, came to the vicinity of Greenwood in 1877... Drownings on the drive and other accidents have taken the lives of well-known inhabitants. Hugh Tackney of Christie was working on the drive for the Coleman Lumber Company above the dam on Rock Creek. He was riding a log that was caught in the current, carrying him, through the spillway and plunging man and log beneath the boiling flood. Two weeks later the body was found by Miles Murphy a mile or more down the creek completely buried in Edmunds' sandbar, except for two buttons on his clothes which were shining in the sun. In June 1893 Johnny Alton was drowned in Black River while on the drive.

The patient, with her father and mother, were taken to the building formerly used as a cigar factory and the restaurant was fumigated, it being hoped thereby to make it unnecessary to quarantine only the one building. Strong objection was made Friday to this course and as a result the bakery was quarantined and those passing that way since may by times see five wry faces gazing through the windows, longing for deliverance. Lousia Decker, Jessie Swetland, Martha Schwan and Inga Hanson, with Albert Christiansen to add dignity to the experience, are under quarantine here. School was dismissed Friday noon, and children were ordered to remain at home as much as possible. So every precaution has been taken to guard against a possible spread of the contagion. Mrs. Geo. Alton was reported Monday as having the symptoms of diphtheria and the entire building was at once put under quarantine. Rev. R. E. House and family live over the Alton family, so they are shut in and are learning to appreciate the way of quietness and peace as never before. Though the gossiping hearsay mongers have told of one or two other cases, no new developments have occurred. The Borseth girl and Mrs. Alton are both improving, so that it is likely the scare will be over by Monday, and that school and other public places will be opened in due form.\n\nDiptheria - An acute infectious disease caused by toxigenic strains of the bacillus Corynebacterium diphtheriae, acquired by contact with an infected person or a carrier of the disease.

There is also an Emilie b. 1865, d. 1872, but this would make one too many children as they had 15 and three (Charles 1882 and August prior 1891 plus Emelia 1882 or Emilie 1872) were dead by 1891 bio. Also think one or the other Emelia/Emilie would have been on the 1880 census but there is no Emilie or Emelia on that census.

The father had brought his family to the United States in 1843, settling in Norway Township, Racine Co, Wisc, where Adney died in 1845. The family then came to Jackson Co in 1854, settling in Springfield Township, where the mother died in 1878. They had seven children, all now living, namely: Knud, Sr. (#1), Gunder, Ole, Mary, Knud, Jr., Margaret and Sarah. While in Jackson Co, Knud Anderson, Jr. (#2), first worked as a carpenter, and then at farming. In 1869 he removed to La Crosse, where he kept a tavern one-year, and in 1870 came to this county and took up a homestead on section 18, township 27, range 1 east (Unity), where he lived five years. He next lived on Giles Creek four years, after which he worked in Tom Miller's mill. He came to his present place, Hemlock, in 1879, where he has been night watchman on the flood dam, and also ran the plane in the Hemlock Mills. He now has charge of the Hemlock flood dam for the Black River Improvement Co. He was married in June 1859, to Thea Burch, who was born near Christiania, Norway, the daughter of Torger Burch. They have had fifteen children, twelve of whom are still living, namely: Clara T., Adolph, Augusta, Laura, Millie, Nellie, Fernando, Georgiana, Birdie, W. Lee, Sadie and Frankie. Clara married James Rowe, of Calumet, Michigan, and has one child, Winnifred P.; Adolph, a merchant at Greenwood, married Mary Francis, and has one child, George; Augusta married Albert Huggett, of Melrose, Jackson Co, and has one child also, Ralph. \"1891 Biographical History of Clark Jackson Counties, WI”\n\nANDERSON, Knud, Jr. (20 Nov 1828 – 23 Aug 1900)\n\nOn August 23, 1900, death visited the quiet little village of Hemlock and claimed for his own, one of the first who made their homes in the wilds of Clark Co. Mr. K. (Knud) Anderson came to this country from Norway at the age of fourteen years. Since his marriage he has passed most of his life in Clark Co. He was known by all as an honest, upright and conscientious man, who was ever ready and willing to render any little service that was in his power. It seems the more sad to have taken away one, who, although he had been a sufferer for years, never complained, and was ever patient under trials.

Burch and Edna and Mrs. Thea (nee Burch) Anderson left Monday morning to be present at the funeral. Deceased was 95 years old last Sept. 30 and up to about ten years ago was a rugged woman. At that time she sustained a stroke of paralysis on the right side, but from which she partially recovered. During the past year she has failed quite fast so that her mind weakened and dwelt almost wholly on things of the long ago. Her son E. T. Burch was down to see her only a few weeks ago and found her as well as she had been during the past year. For some eighteen years Grandma made her home with her son in Greenwood, but for the past seven years has resided with her daughter, Mrs. Strand at Blair, this daughter dying during the past summer.\n\n>Feb 15, 1906: Mrs. K.

The bride has lived for the past fifteen years in Greenwood and is a graduate of the Greenwood High School. Mr. Anderson is bookkeeper for the Farmers Co-operative Supply Co., which position he has held, with the exception of part of the first year, ever since the store was started in 1899.

Anderson, a general merchant of Greenwood, was born near Taylor's Station, Jackson Co, Wis., Nov 20 1862, the son of Knud Anderson, a native of Norway, but now of Hemlock, Clark Co, Wis. He came with his parents to the United States when fifteen years of age, and settled at Racine, Wis. He was a pioneer of Jackson Co, having settled among Indians and wild animals. He removed to this county in 1870, settling in Beaver Township, Clark Co, in the thick of the woods. Theodore worked in the woods and saw-mills several years, and also in driving logs in Black River. He came to Greenwood in 1881, where he clerked in a store seven years. In 1888 he engaged in business for himself at Hemlock, but in May 1890, removed his stock of goods to Greenwood, where he carries a full line of groceries, dry goods, boots, shoes, hats, caps, etc. He has a capital stock of $2,000, his annual sales amounting to $6,000, which is rapidly increasing. Mr. Anderson was married July 1 1886 to Mary Francis, daughter of John Francis, of this township. They have one child, George M., born March 25, 1887. Mr. Anderson was School Treasurer of Warner Township one year. \"Biographical History of Clark Jackson Counties, WI\" 1891\n\nANDERSON, Martin family, Warner township\n\nANDERSON, Martin (c1870 - ?)\n\n1905 #55 Anderson, Martin Head W M 35 M Wisconsin Norway Farmer 10 O M F Martha Wife W F 28 M Wisconsin Norway House Keeper Bernard Son W M 8 S Wisconsin Wisconsin Mabel Daughter W F 6 S Wisconsin Wisconsin Grace Daughter W F 3 S Wisconsin Wisconsin\n\nNothing further found in Clark Co records on this family.

Anderson (1906 = Henry Niemond prop)\n\nANDERSON, Peter (6 Feb 1826 – 4 Sept 1916)\n\nThe 1905 census has Peter Anderson as residence #77 and Simon Severson (the nephew where he died) as residence #76. Perhaps there was a small house on the Severson property that Anderson lived in so it was counted as an individual residence. The 1905 census also has Peter Anderson as a widower. Peter Anderson could have been widowed in Norway as he would have been about age 50 in 1875. The 1875 census has 3 males and 3 females in addition to Peter Anderson. These could have been Peter’s Severson and perhaps Larson and Johnson relations who might have lived together when Peter first came over from Norway.\n\nThe Greenwood cemetery has two Peter Anderson entries. Peter Anderson b. 2-6-1826, d. 9-4-1916 (age 90 at death) with a notation “stone d. month is May”. Ref is “T” for tombstone and “nc” (no record at court house?)\n\nThe second Greenwood cemetery entry has a Peter Anderson dying in 1919 (no month or day) with no birthdate. The reference to this entry is “c” (courthouse? evidently no tombstone). The notes for this entry: “Old Bear Pete” b. in Norway, brother of Mrs. Martin Johnson. (Martin “Morton” Johnson b. 7-8-1861, d. 6-10-1956, was married to Kari M. Anderson, b. 12-3-1841, d. 10-31-1929)\n\nThe followin “Hub” article has “Old Bear Pete” dying in May 1915 at the home of his nephew Sam (Simon) Severson. More than likely Old Bear Pete’s death was in May 1916 as per the tombstone, and the “brother of Mrs. Kari Anderson” note was attached to the wrong Peter Anderson in the Greenwood cemetery index. (I could find no info on a Peter Anderson who died in 1919.)\n\n“...Pete Anderson, a bachelor, who had been the servant of a Norwegian prince, came to Greenwood in 1875. He had a fight with a bear while in Norway, and had killed the bear with his only weapons, a jack-knife and his fists, but was about as badly used up as the bear and was terribly scarred. From this he was nicknamed \"Old Bear Pete\".\n\nHe obtained a piece of land west of the river and in 1876 proceeded to build a log home. He built his house and had logs rolled up for a barn, when he, went out one morning to work while his coffee boiled. He was sawing the logs out to -make a doorway, when one fell, striking and breaking his leg, and he alone with only a trail past his place with few passersby! Charles Varney (1865 – 1940, family lived in sec 20 in 1873), then a young lad, passed near enough to hear his cries for help, but not understanding the call, was afraid to answer, so \"Old Bear Pete\" lay on the ground all day. That evening when Annie Guldbrand (No info on a “Guldbrand” family. Perhaps this was some “Annie” who came from Guldbrandalen, Norway, where Peter and his sister Kari nee Anderson Johnson were from.), a neighbor, was out looking for her cow she heard someone calling and told her husband to go and see if something wrong with Pete, which he did and found him lying on the ground not far from where he had fallen.\n\nHe recovered from this, too, and was able to finish his barn, clear his land, grub out the stumps, make maple sugar, and perform all the numerous duties of a pioneer, though always very lame. He even entertained company, and one time (Dorrence Bailey 1858 – 1891, killed by lightening) Dorry Bailey (who had a habit of tasting everything he saw) picked up a chunk of maple sugar and ate it, which \"Old Bear Pete\" had been sucking on for a week. As Pete grew old he lived with his nephew Sam Severson (1863 – 1922, lived sec 36) where he would take a chair to the woods in which to sit and chop down trees and saw them into wood. He died at Severson's in May 1915....” The Hub of Clark County (1853 - 1934)\n\nANDERSON, J. family of Warner township\n\n1906 sec 2 residence J. Anderson (1893 = W.H.Mead) (1915 = Otto Meinhardt)\n\nThis was the Gordee farm (also see Alperstette) in 1903 when Moritz and Caroline nee Horn Meinhardt first rented it and then purchased it in 1905. Otto Meinhardt was born on that farm in 1904. All of the “J. Anderson or Andersen” families lived near Withee or Owen, there are no records showing that they or any other Anderson/Andersen family lived on this property. Evidently the plat map was not correct as to ownership as early as 1903.\n\nANDREWS family, Warner township\n\n1880 sec19, 29, 30, 34 no residences G. C. Andrews, sec 35 residence G. C.

Andrews, one of the early settlers of Greenwood and Eaton Township, was born at Smith's Falls, Ont., Dec. 3, 1830, son of Elkanah and Elizabeth (Hutton) Andrews. The parents were natives of New York State, they rmoved at a very early day to Canada, in which country they passed the rest of their lives. George C. Andrews acquired his education at Smith's Falls. When only 15 years of age he started to learn the blacksmith's trade, serving three years as an apprentice at $25 a year.\n\nAt the end of that period he went to Rawdon, Canada, where he established himself in business, and while there, on Oct. 11, 1854, he was united in marriage with Lorinda Chamberlain, a native of New York State. For several years, he and his wife resided in Rawdon, and there seven children were born to them. In 1856, Mr. Andrews made a trip to the United States, remaining six months. Then returning to Canada, he resumed his trade and business, which he followed there until 1871. He then came again to the United States, bringing his family with him, and settling in Greenwood, Eaton Township, Clark Co, Wis. which village at that time contained only two stores and a hotel. Here Mr. Andrews set up a blacksmith shop, becoming the village smith. Six days a week he could always be found at his forge or anvil, and on Sunday he supplied the pulpit, being the first local Methodist preacher in Greenwood. He also purchased forty acres of land in Section 35, Warner Township, besides quite a quantity of other wild land. After a residence of over thirty years in Greenwood, he died, June 28, 1902. Mrs. Andrews, the wife and mother, (Lorrinda, born 1836) died July 6, 1897. They were the parents of ten children, seven of whom were, as previously stated, born in Canada. Of these two died in infancy. A brief record of the children, including the three born in Greenwood, is as follows: Mary Elizabeth, now Mrs. Erastus Bowen, of Greenwood; Harriet Angelia, widow of Dr. H. J. Thomas, of Chicago; James S., of Eaton Township, Clark Co; George B., who died in Iowa, April 8, 1917; Florence, now Mrs. Ralph Hall, of Chicago; the two who died in infancy in Canada, where all the above mentioned were born: Effie B., now Mrs. Arthur Cadmen, of Fairchild, Wis.; Lillie, who is unmarried, and lives in Chicago, and Ella, who died at the age of 2 years. Both Mr. and Mrs. Andrews were loyal and highly esteemed members of the Methodist Episcopal Church. 1918 History of Clark Co.\n\n“...In 1871 S. C. Honeywell had the first blacksmith shop on the corner east of Ludwig's store. G. C. Andrews assisted him and received seventy-five dollars a month for his work. His family lived in the back room of S. C. Honeywell's warehouse, the building now occupied by Ed Schwarze. In the spring \"Uncle George\", as everyone called him, bought the corner lot and built the house now occupied by Millie Smith. It was in this house that he and his family lived as long as they were in Greenwood. His wife, Lorinda, loved flowers and had all kinds in her yard with tall hollyhocks along the picket fence. Her yard, with its beautiful flowers, was the show place of the town. Uncle George built an addition to the blacksmith shop and put in an ox-frame where he shod as many as fifty yoke of oxen in one year. When oxen were to be shod they were led into a stall for this work. There they were raised in a sling until their feet were off the ground. Then their feet were placed on a board rest and fastened with a clevis to hold them, for they kicked like blazes. Henry Schwarze, father of Simon Schwarze, our present Marshal, did the carpenter work on Uncle George's shop. About 1878, Uncle George built a new shop, now Ludwig's store. This was a two-story building with lodge rooms above and shop below. He ran the shop for many years. Later it was conducted by John Lucas and son. Finally in 1902 it was-used as a printing office...\n\n...George C. Andrews was another interesting character, who was a blacksmith and local preacher. He worked many nights until after midnight. In an old record book under the date of December 3, 1880, he recorded that he had earned nine dollars that evening, and in 1889 eight dollars and forty cents one evening, several years he had shod as high as fifty yoke of oxen during the winter season. He would work hard all the week and on Sundays walk to Hemlock, Longwood, Christie or LaTart to preach the gospel which he believed and loved, without remuneration. \"Uncle George\" as a preacher was especially gifted and the people delighted to hear him. Whether he preached or addressed the annual memorial service or other public gatherings, nearly every early settler was indebted to him, for he had been in their homes on festive occasions, when some member of the family was joyously entering into wedded life, or prayed with them when they mourned and were comfortless...\n\n...The story is told of George Andrews having a very promising patch of corn, about where Charles Varney's house now stands, and Mr. Schofield owning a beautiful herd of steers. While seeking new pastures, they found Mr. Andrews' corn. George drove them out and the herd of aforesaid \"beautiful steers\" gathered on the east span (of the bridge), stamping and chasing flies; all went down. One of the steers so badly injured it’s spine that it had to be killed. This part of the river crossing was never rebuilt....” The Hub of Clark County (1853 - 1934)\n\nANDREWS, Mary E. marriage 4 Jan 1881\n\nMarried, Jan. 4th, 1881, at the residence of G. C. Andrews in the village of Greenwood, Clark Co, by Rev. C.C. Swartz, Mr. Erastus Bowen, of Columbus, Wis. to Miss Mary E. Andrews of Greenwood. (Daughter of G. C. Andrews)\n\nJan 29, 1900: Numerous reports were flying about Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning to the effect that Rev. G. C. Andrews and James Whitmore were dying and dead, but they were almost without foundation, except that the latter has been quite ill, and Uncle George has been confined to the house for a few days. Such reports show how easy it is for anything of a sensational nature to be enlarged and exaggerated. Greenwood Gleaner\n\nANDREWS, George B. (9 Aug 1866- 8 April 1917)\n\nThe many Greenwood and Longwood friends of G. B. Andrews were shocked and saddened to learn of his death the 8th of April, 1917 at Knoxville, Iowa. Mr. Andrews had been suffering for some time with Anemia, but his condition had steadily improved until it received a set back by an attack of pneumonia and jaundice. Ben, as he was known everywhere, was born near Sterling, Ontario, Aug. 9, 1866. He was the son of G. C. and Lorinda Andrews. He came to Greenwood, Clark Co at the age of five years and had resided here and at Longwood until the spring of 1912. For twenty-five years he was proprietor of a general store at Longwood. He was married in 1892 to Miss Lizzie Leonard of Knoxville, Iowa. They have one daughter, Clella, now a teacher in the High School at Storm Lake, Iowa. After the destruction of his Longwood store by fire (in 1912), Mr. Andrews moved to Knoxville, Iowa. Here he purchased the Leonard farm, which he managed until the time of his death.\n\nANDREWS, James Sheldon (14 May 1863 – 21 Mar 1941)\n\nJames Sheldon Andrews, son of George C. and Lorinda Chamberlain Andrews, was born in Sterling, Ontario, Canada May 14, 1863 and died in Clark Co Hospital at Owen, Wis. March 21, 1941 at rest after 13 years of unrest. At the age of eight he came to Greenwood with his parents, where he has lived continuously with the exception of ten years spent in Minnesota and Idaho. He was married Sept. 16, 1896 to Essyleth Cook of Greenwood. Mr. Andrews owned and operated a farm in Greenwood for many years. He sold the farm and purchased a residence in the city in 1919. “Shell” as he was known to his many friends was a good citizen in every sense of the word. He leaves to mourn his loss, his widow and three sisters, Mrs. Florence Hall and Miss Lillian Andrews of Chicago and Walworth, Wis. Mrs. Arthur Cadman of Fairchild, Wis and one niece, Mrs. L.D. Teter of Knoxville, Iowa. Memorial services were conducted from the Stabnow Funeral Home, interment was made in the Greenwood Cemetery. Those from away who attended the funeral were Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Cactman of Fairchild Mrs. Florence Hall and Miss Lillian Andrews of Chicago and Warner Cook of Jamestown, N.D.\n\nJ. S. Andrews, proprietor of an eighty-acre farm in Section 35, Warner Township, was born in Ontario, Canada, May 14, 1863. His father, George C. Andrews, was a blacksmith, born and reared in Canada, came to the United States with his parent when only 8 years old, and received his education in the public school of Greenwood. J. S. Andrews began working out on farms and in the woods at the age of 18 years. When he was 24 he went to Ottertail County, Minn., where, to invest his savings, he bought a piece of wild land, and also took up a homestead of 160 acres. Building a shack, he cleared some of his land and did some farming, remaining there three years. He then went to Idaho, where he stayed about a year, living for the most part in the vicinity of Cordlane. Then returning to Wisconsin, Mr. Andrews operated his father's farm of forty acres in Section 35 for a number of years. In 1896, in the month of October, he was married to Essylath Cook, whose father, Dan Cook, was a farmer who had come to Wisconsin from Canada. Her mother's maiden name was Phoebe Anne Hubbel. After their marriage, Mr. and Mrs. Andrews settled on his farm, where they stayed four years. He then bought eighty acres in Section 35, Warner Township. The tract was covered with timber, and there was no road to the land, there being only a turnpike from Neillsville to two miles north of Greenwood, all other so-called roads being merely trails. On this land he built an eight-room house and a frame barn, which latter he has since replaced with a new and modern round barn. He has chopped off sixty acres of his land, and now has thirty-seven under plow. He also raises Holstein cattle and is conducting a successful business as a farmer. HISTORY OF CLARK COUNTY 1918\n\nANDREWS, Steve M. (14 June 1828 – 14 Sept 1901)\n\nSteven M. Andrews died at his home after a gradual failing as a result of asthma with which he had suffered for years. To the end he was cheerful and enjoyed seeing any who called on him, though at times he was so weak that it was impossible to say more than a few words without exhaustion. \"Uncle Steve,\" as deceased was known to nearly every body in this part of the county, was born (of Elkanah and Elizabeth nee Hutton Andrews) near Ottawa, Canada, on June 14, 1828. In 1868 he came with his family to Wisconsin, settling for two years in Juneau county from which he came to Greenwood and located, his house being the first built in the town. Here he has been chiefly engaged in farming. On September 2, 1851, Mr. Andrews was married to Miss Harriet Campbell and to his worthy couple were born ten children, eight of whom live to mourn, with their mother the loss.

ARMSTRONG was born in La Crosse and came to Clark Co with his parents in 1870, settling at Neillsville. Mr. Armstrong relates his early experiences as follows: \"We later moved to the forty-acre farm of Gile Holway, two miles north of Loyal. When 19 years old I ran a camp in the woods and for eighteen years handled logs on the Black and Chippewa rivers. For thirteen years I had charge of the Hemlock Dam as foreman. We used to run on an average of 1,000,000 feet an hour through the dam in the spring and summer. This dam was built in the summer of 1879. I was with the Black River Improvement Co., who discontinued work in 1905. Our logs of hemlock and pine all went down the Black River by way of the Dells Dam to La Crosse.\n\nMy mother and her sister came into this county in the winter of 1855 from Halfway Creek, near La Crosse, and cooked in the logging camp of her brother-in-law, Abner Gile on Gile's Creek, three miles north of Greenwood. I came to Greenwood in 1875 and lived on my father's (William J. Armstrong) farm, which is now in the city limits. At that time there were three stores, four saloons, and one blacksmith's shop. The second schoolhouse then stood on the corner where the Greenwood State Bank now stands. Father used to bring all supplies by wagon from Sparta, while mother was cooking in the camp. During my days we freighted our supplies from Hatfield, Jackson Co, and the stage brought mail and passengers from Black River Falls. This town was a rough place. The loggers would come in, spend their money for whiskey, get drunk and fight, and many times they tore up the sidewalks. In 1885 a creamery was started here, but failed. They later tried it again, but failed for want of cows. I ran a store and post office at Hemlock for two years, and also ran the sawmill, but the flood of 1914 took the dam and gristmill and sawmill out.\" History\n\nARMSTRONG, Allen S. marriage – 1 July 1884\n\nAt Greenwood, on July 1, Allen S.

Campbell of Neillsville was in town last week serving papers on officers of the Greenwood Telephone Company in proceedings brought by A. S.

L. Devos, representing the firm of Rush and Devos. The bank, which has been in charge of the state banking commission since its doors were closed, has paid back approximately 50% of its liabilities.
