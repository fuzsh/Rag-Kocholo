        "text": "Installing P90's does nothing to address the issue raised by the OP, sorry.\n\nQuick search doesn't really bring up anything helpful. Much discussion of the Guitar model itself, various issues regarding the Electronics, etc., but no \"Guide TO Chet's Settings\", or anything so obvious.\n\nCouple of not-altogether-helpful thoughts -\n\nI'd start out by putting on a new set of Strings, then let the strings stretch out and set up overnight. Next, I'd install a fresh battery, check the tuning, and plug into a Mixer or MFX with a good, easily readable Level Meter, and set the balance of the individual Piezos using the meter, and my ears, as a guide.\n\nGiven that the overall tone of any Electric Guitar is going to be influenced by a legion of factors, it may not be possible to emulate the Chet Atkins tone you're after, even having adjusted the Piezo PU's. I would go for the best overall tone and level you can achieve with whatever Amp, PA or FRFR System you're using, while continuing the search for more information.\n\nIn desperation, you might try contacting Gibson directly, but I don't know if they would have that information, if they didn't set the PU balance at the factory, and even if they had the info, somewhere, there's still the issue of whether they can find it, and if they'd be inclined to share it.\n\nGood luck, and good hunting . . .\n\n3 hours ago, IMMusicRulz said:\n\nMaybe you should fit the Chet Atkins guitar with a Gibson P90 pickup. It might seem strange, but a lot of acoustic guitars have been modified to feature pickups and onboard electronics.\n\nIt is a nylon string guitar, P90 is a magnetic pickup. It won't work, plain and simple.\n\nRegarding the OP's question, Chet Atkins passed on some 22 years ago. It's possible that shops like Stewart MacDonald and George Gruhn may have information, it's likely that Chet used a guitar technician to set up his guitars but it is also possible that he did his own work.\n\nIt's going to take considerable research to find out. It may be worth investigating other guitarists who played on recordings with Chet - he made albums with the following - Hank Snow, Jerry Reed, Merle Travis, and Les Paul but he also had a \"right hand man\" on guitar whose name escapes me right now.\n\nIt's possible (and probable) that Chet's thumb tended to be more forceful (and hence, louder) than the rest of his fingers. Or maybe it wasn't. Pretty difficult to know but you could listen to music Chet played on other guitars (although the Gretsch guitars with Chet's name on them all had adjustable poles on the pickups).\n\nIn the end, while you might be able to set up a guitar that is just like the set up Chet had, you will still sound like you in the same way that Chet always sounded like Chet.\n\n@Alaska Picker, Welcome aboard!\n\nIf \"the tone is better than fine right now\", I would leave the settings as is. It indicates that no one has messed with the factory settings, or if they have, they did a very good job. I'm sure Gibson did take into account the Chet Atkins preferred settings on the specially made 6 saddle pickups system before attaching Chet's name to the model. Magnetic pickups will not work on nylon strings. A lot of how you will sound when playing the guitar depends on the amplification equipment that you plug into and the settings that you will use. Go for the best sound you can hear. I would have a tech make any changes...\n\nIt reminds me of a story Chet told about people who would say \"that's a very nice sounding guitar\" as one lady commented. Chet put the guitar down and asked, \"how does it sound now?\" LoL! üòéüëç Good luck with your research and +1 on contacting Gibson as they may have information on the settings..."
