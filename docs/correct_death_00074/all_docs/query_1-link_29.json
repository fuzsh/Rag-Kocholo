        "text": "Honoring a Legacy Through Art\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. – June 20, 2024 – The Country Music Hall of Fame and Nashville Ballet have come together to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of legendary Country Music Hall of Fame member Chet Atkins. They released an original ballet performance set to Atkins’ recording of the “Jitterbug Waltz” on YouTube today. This collaboration between two renowned nonprofit organizations is a fitting tribute to Atkins’ enduring influence on American music and culture.\n\nA Mesmerizing Performance\n\nThe three-minute video showcases a beautifully curated ballet by Nashville Ballet dancers Cassandra Thoms and Shaiya Donohue. The choreography is set to Atkins’ 1959 guitar rendition of the “Jitterbug Waltz” from his album *Chet Atkins in Hollywood*. The performance, choreographed and co-directed by Nashville Ballet Artistic Director and CEO Nick Mullikin, was filmed in the Hall of Fame Rotunda at the Country Music Hall of Fame. This iconic location, home to the bronze plaques of Hall of Fame members and Thomas Hart Benton’s mural “The Sources of Country Music,” provides a stunning backdrop for the dance. The dancers’ costumes pay homage to the figures in Benton’s painting, further connecting the performance to the rich heritage of country music.\n\nA Vision Realized\n\nDavid Conrad, a museum trustee and mentee of Chet Atkins, envisioned the video performance. The video also features Atkins’ 1954 Standel 25L15 amplifier and a Gretsch Streamliner Special 6120 guitar model, which he helped design.\n\n“Chet Atkins and his fellow members of the Country Music Hall of Fame’s indelible impact on American culture continues to inspire new generations of creators,” said Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. “In celebration of the centennial anniversary of Chet’s birth, we are honored to partner with the Nashville Ballet to showcase Chet’s enduring music and deserved recognition among the greatest guitarists of all time while uplifting the creativity and collaboration within Nashville’s nonprofit arts community.”\n\nA Community Effort\n\nThe project is underwritten by David and Karen Conrad, with additional support from Metro Arts and the Tennessee Arts Commission.\n\n“It’s a true honor to create a special piece of work for the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum to celebrate Chet Atkins,” said Nick Mullikin. “The opportunity to bring our two organizations together for this one-of-a-kind performance event not only exemplifies our commitment to excellence in the arts community but also honors the heritage of Music City.”\n\nAbout Chet Atkins\n\nInducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1973, Chet Atkins was a pioneering musician whose innovative style and contributions helped shape the Nashville Sound. Learning guitar and fiddle as a child, he was deeply influenced by Merle Travis’ thumb-and-finger picking technique, which he adapted into his unique style. His career took off when he signed with RCA Victor in 1947 and became a mainstay on the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nAtkins was part of Nashville’s early “A-Team” of session musicians and recorded with numerous legendary artists, including Hank Williams and the Everly Brothers. He became a key figure at RCA’s Nashville studios in 1955, eventually rising to vice president. Atkins produced many successful acts, including Eddy Arnold, Skeeter Davis, and Floyd Cramer, and played a significant role in developing the Nashville Sound, blending country with pop influences.\n\nAtkins received numerous accolades throughout his career, including eleven Country Music Association Instrumentalist of the Year awards, a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and fifteen Grammy Awards. His legacy continues to inspire musicians and artists worldwide.\n\nFor more information on Chet Atkins’ life and career, visit the Country Music Hall of Fame’s website.\n\nThis centennial celebration honors Chet Atkins’s memory and highlights Nashville’s vibrant arts community. Through this unique collaboration, the Country Music Hall of Fame and Nashville Ballet have created a lasting tribute that resonates with the spirit of innovation and creativity that Chet Atkins embodied.\n\nCountry Music Hall of Fame and Museum:\n\nAubrey Miller – 615-416-2098\n\nagmiller@ countrymusichalloffame.org\n\nNashville Ballet:\n\nKim Dettwiller Burton – 615-330-5656\n\nTresa Halbrooks – 615-669-6058\n\nPR@NashvilleBallet.com\n\nMedia Website:\n\nhttp://countrymusichalloffame. org/press\n\nAbout the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum:\n\nThe Country Music Hall of Fame® and Museum collects, preserves and interprets country music and its history for the education and entertainment of diverse audiences.
