        "text": "The Tolivers of Lawrence & Orange Counties, Indiana\n\nThis surname has many different spellings, with some of the more common spellings being Toliver, Tolliver, Tolivar and Tolovar. Many times, an individual’s surname would be spelled differently in various records. This document uses a standard spelling of Toliver. Researchers should decide for themselves which spelling is appropriate for a specific person.\n\nChapter one covers John Toliver, the earliest family member that I feel comfortable listing. Even at that, there are many unanswered questions about him. Chapters two through eight cover his seven children that I am fairly sure of, although there may have been more.\n\nNames in blue denote the direct line of the author, Robert E. Lane.\n\nChapter One: John Toliver\n\nFirst Generation\n\n1. John Toliver1–5 was born about 1725. He was probably born in Virginia.\n\nHis given name is subject to debate, but it is likely that his name was either John or William, since those are the only two Toliver males who appear on tax lists of the correct time period. There is circumstantial evidence supporting both names, although John seems the stronger to the two.\n\nJesse Toliver's pension application file includes a Bible page which suggests that his father's name was John Toliver - the name written at the top of the page. A land entry in Wilkes Co. dated June 3, 1778 (Entry #159) states that Jesse Tolover entered 300 acres on Mulberry waters on both sides of road leading from John Robbins, Sr. over to Roaring River Settlement, \"being improvement John Tolover, Sr. now lives on.\" This implies that there was indeed a senior John Toliver in Wilkes Co. who may have been Jesse's father.\n\nAround 1770, at least three of the brothers - Moses, Jesse and John - and perhaps all five of the brothers, moved from Virginia to North Carolina, east of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Their father was still living at the time, and is believed to have been a part of the move.\n\nFollowing the Battle of King's Mountain in 1780, the Toliver brothers, their mother (who is not named) and other family members moved west of the Blue Ridge mountains to the part of Wilkes that later became Ashe and still later Alleghany County. There was no mention of the father. If William Toliver (1730-1774) was the father, his death in 1774 fits the absence of the father in 1780. Also, there is a William Toliver on tax lists in Surry County (Wilkes was formed from Surry in 1777) in 1771 and 1772. Of course, to \"muddy the waters\" a bit, there is also a Dr. John Taliaferro there during the same years.\n\nThe Family Tree DNA Project lists him as William Toliver, Sr. DNA from the descendants of Jesse, Charles, William, and Moses Toliver shows that these men were either brothers or cousins through the male line. Their genetic \"markers\" indicate that their common male ancestor was European. DNA from descendants of John Toliver did not match the others and may be Mediterranean/Spanish in origin. Because the more traditional genealogical evidence (censuses, land records, etc.) indicates there was a connection between John Toliver and the other brothers, it is possible that he was their cousin on the maternal side or that there could be a \"break\" in the male line somewhere between John Toliver and the descendant whose DNA was tested, such as an adoption, step-child, or out-of-wedlock birth. Revolutionary War pension application affidavits state that John, Moses, and Jesse were brothers.\n\nNell Watson Sherman's book, Taliaferro-Toliver Family Records, lists him as Charles Toliver, the son of Charles Taliaferro and Ann Kemp, with siblings Moses, Jesse, John, and William. However, her account has generally been discredited. Charles Taliaferro's book, The Taliaferro Family - Three Centuries in America lists Mildred and Kemp as the children of Charles and Ann. Velma T. Parmerton reports that Charles Taliaferro's Essex County will is quite explicit - the only children were Mildred, Kemp, and Sarah. Also, this Charles died in 1721, too early to have fathered any of the \"five brothers\".\n\nThe DNA obtained from the Toliver descendants does NOT match the DNA obtained from Robert Taliaferro's known descendants. This shows that the Tolivers of North Carolina are NOT descendants of Robert Taliaferro, at least not in the direct male line. They could be descendants of a Taliaferro female who had a child born out of wedlock or descendants of an unrelated family who adopted the Taliaferro/Toliver name, but this is entirely speculative.\n\nSome researchers have reported that he immigrated to Lawrence County, Indiana, although this has not been proven. If he did, he likely came with his son Charles, who brought his family from Ashe County, North Carolina in 1815.\n\nHe died on June 24, 1821 at the age of 96. Researchers who believe that John migrated to Lawrence County have reported that he is buried in Freedom Cemetery, Lawrence County, Indiana, but no supporting evidence has been found. It is possible that he was buried in Allegheny County, North Carolina.\n\nJohn Toliver and [Unknown] were married Unknown. [Unknown] was born Unknown. Some postings on Ancestry.com list her as Elizabeth Symes. However, no supporting evidence is given. She died Unknown.\n\nJohn Toliver and [Unknown] had the following children:\n\n2 i. Moses Toliver, born about 1754.\n\n3 ii. Jesse Toliver, born 1756.\n\n4 iii. John Toliver, born about 1760.\n\n5 iv. Charles Toliver, born about 1765.\n\n6 v. Sarah Ann Toliver, born about 1766.\n\n7 vi. Lucy Toliver, born 1770.\n\n8 vii. William Toliver, born about 1775.\n\nData Sources\n\n1. Taliaferro-Toliver Family Records by Nell Watson Sherman (Peoria, IL, The Author, 1961).\n\n2. Clinton Leslie Toliver. Personal information and research.\n\n3. John Martin Toliver.

Taliaferro Family - Three Centuries In America by Charles Taliaferro, Sr. (Hanford, CA, The Author, 1998)\n\nChapter Two: Moses Toliver\n\nFirst Generation\n\n1. Moses Toliver1–4 was born about 1754 in Virginia, United States. Some researchers believe he was born in Fauquier County.\n\nHe appeared in the census in 1787 in Wilkes, North Carolina, United States. This state census listed 3 males under 21, 1 male 21-60 and 3 females. He appeared in the census in 1790 in Wilkes, North Carolina, United States. It lists 4 males under 16, 1 male 16-up and 3 females. He appeared in the census in 1800 in Ashe, North Carolina, United States. It lists 2 males under 10, 2 males 10-15, 2 males 16-25, 1 male over 44, 1 female under 10 and 1 female 26-44. Ashe County split from Wilkes County in 1799.\n\nMoses appeared in the following public records:\n\n• 1774-84 tax lists for Surry County, North Carolina.\n\n• June 3, 1778, he entered a land claim for 100 acres on Mulberry Creek in Wilkes County, North Carolina\n\n(land entry book 158).\n\n• June 12, 1779, Moses sold Jesse 100 acres of land.\n\n• October 27, 1782, he and wife Elizabeth conveyed the 100 acres to Abraham Edins (deed book A1, page 234).\n\nThey appear to have moved to the south fork of the New River, near Jefferson, Ashe County, North Carolina.\n\n• 1810 & 1812 tax lists for Warren County, Tennessee (these are the last written records of Moses).\n\nThe early censuses indicate that Moses and Elizabeth had 8 children - 6 boys and 2 girls. None of the 8 children have been proven, but circumstantial evidence suggests that Joel, John and Jesse were three of the children. This is based on shared locations of Moses, Joel, John and Jesse. Also, DNA from descendants of Joel, John and Jesse are a match.\n\nHe died on April 20, 1821 at the age of 67. This date comes from son John's family Bible. Nell Watson Sherman interviewed older family members in Indiana around 1960, while writing her book, Taliaferro-Toliver Family Records. They stated that Moses died on his way to Indiana and that Elizabeth and her son John completed the trip. John moved from North Carolina to Kentucky, then to Tennessee, then to Alabama, then to Indiana, and eventually to Illinois. Moses and Elizabeth must have accompanied him on his journey. Some researchers believe that Moses left for Indiana from North Carolina in 1815, probably traveling with his brother Charles. However, Charles arrived in Indiana in 1816, well before Moses died, so this scenario is very unlikely. There is a Find-A-Grave memorial for Moses at Freedom Cemetery in Lawrence County, Indiana. There is no grave stone picture. It is unknown if he is actually buried there. If the people Nell Watson Sherman interviewed were correct, it seems unlikely.\n\nMoses Toliver and Elizabeth [Unknown] were married about 1776 in North Carolina, United States. Elizabeth [Unknown]4–5 was born about 1755. Some Ancestry.com postings list her surname as Stamper or Connelly, but offer no supporting evidence. The Tolliver Family website states that marriage records make it clear that Connelly was not her surname. She died on August 28, 1827 at the age of 72 in Lawrence, Indiana, United States. This date comes from son John's family Bible. There is a Find-A-Grave memorial for Elizabeth at Freedom Cemetery in Lawrence County, Indiana. There is no grave stone picture. It is unknown if she is actually buried there.\n\nMoses Toliver and Elizabeth [Unknown] had the following children:\n\n2 i. Joel Toliver, born between 1776 and 1780.\n\n3 ii. John Toliver, born April 20, 1780.\n\n4 iii. Jesse Toliver, born between 1790 and 1800.\n\nSecond Generation\n\n2. Joel Toliver2,4,6 was born between 1776 and 1780 in Wilkes, North Carolina, United States.\n\nIt has not been proven that Joel was a son of Moses, but circumstantial evidence suggests that he was. Some of this is based on shared locations of Moses, Joel, John and Jesse that suggest they were closely related. Also, DNA from descendants of Joel, John and Jesse are a match.\n\nHe appeared in the census in 1840 in Morgan, Kentucky, United States. It lists 1 male 50-60 and 1 female 40-50. He appeared in the census in 1860 in Division 1, Breathitt, Kentucky, United States. It lists Joel (80) and Lucy (85).\n\nJoel died Unknown in Breathitt, Kentucky, United States.\n\nJoel Toliver and Hannah Sebastian were married Unknown. Hannah Sebastian4 was born between 1776 and 1780 in Wilkes, North Carolina, United States. She died Unknown in Kentucky, United States.\n\nJoel Toliver and Lucy Lakin were married on July 3, 1837 in Morgan, Kentucky, United States. Lucy Lakin2,4,6 was born between 1790 and 1800 in North Carolina, United States. She appeared in the census in 1860 in Division 1, Breathitt, Kentucky, United States. She died Unknown.\n\n3. John Toliver2–4,7–10 was born on April 20, 1780 in Wilkes, North Carolina, United States. Some sources report his birth place as Ashe County.\n\nIt has not been proven that John was a son of Moses, but circumstantial evidence suggests that he was. Some of this is based on shared locations of Moses, Joel, John and Jesse that suggest they were closely related. Also, DNA from descendants of John, Jesse and Joel are a match.\n\nJohn lived in Ashe County, North Carolina, Warren County, Tennessee, Madison County, Alabama, Lawrence County Indiana, and finally Clay County, Illinois. Some researcher have reported that John donated the land for Freedom Cemetery in Lawrence County, Indiana, before moving to Clay County, Illinois. The accuracy of this information is unknown.\n\nHe appeared in the census in 1820 in Lawrence, Indiana, United States. It lists 2 males 0-10, 1 male 16-26, 1 male 26-45, 3 females 0-10 and 1 female 26-45. He appeared in the census in 1830 in Lawrence, Indiana, United States. It lists 1 male 0-5, 2 males 5-10, 1 male 10-15, 1 male 15-20, 1 male 20-30, 1 male 40-50, 1 female 0-5 and 1 female 40-50. He appeared in the census in 1840 in Clay, Illinois, United States. It lists 1 male 5-10, 2 males 15-20, 1 male 60-70, 1 female 10-15 and 1 female 50-60. He appeared in the census in 1850 in Clay, Illinois, United States. It lists John (69), Saloma (68), James Nelson (15) [relationship unknown], and grandchildren George Davis (14), Ruth Brown (10) and James Brown (9). He appeared in the census in 1860 in Louisville, Clay, Illinois, United States. It lists John (78), Sylvania (70), Nelson (25), Angeline (20) and William (1). The surname is spelled Taliaferro.\n\nJohn died on April 21, 1863 at the age of 83 in Louisville, Clay, Illinois, United States. He was buried at Tolliver Cemetery in Clay, Illinois, United States.\n\nJohn's Bible, last known to be in the possession of great-grandson Walter Toliver, reported \"John and Saloma were married in the month of November, 1801, in Ashe County, North Carolina, on the waters of Little River. Two children were born there. Then moved from there to Kentucky, from there to Tennessee, from there to Alabama, and from there to Indiana, and from there to Illinois, and remained there at this time (dated) Sept. 1852\". He also wrote \"My father died April 20, 1821 and my mother died August 28, 1827.\"\n\nJohn Toliver and Saloma Miller were married on November 1, 1801 in Ashe, North Carolina, United States. Saloma Miller2,7–9,11 was born about 1781 in North Carolina, United States. The date is based on the censuses. The date would be November 14, 1786 based on the age and death date from the cemetery transcription. She appeared in the census in 1820 in Lawrence, Indiana, United States. She appeared in the census in 1830 in Lawrence, Indiana, United States. She appeared in the census in 1850 in Clay, Illinois, United States. She died on August 1, 1858 at the age of 77 in Clay, Illinois, United States. She was buried at Tolliver Cemetery in Clay, Illinois, United States.\n\nJohn Toliver and Saloma Miller had the following children:\n\n5 i. Christine Toliver, born November 2, 1802.\n\n6 ii. Sarah \"Sally\" Toliver, born December 12, 1804.\n\n7 iii. Anna Toliver, born June 10, 1807.\n\n8 iv. Martin Toliver, born March 28, 1809.\n\n9 v. William \"Billy\" Toliver, born March 22, 1811.\n\n10 vi. Elizabeth Toliver, born March 9, 1813.\n\n11 vii. Moses Jackson Toliver, born February 23, 1814.\n\n12 viii. Lewis Allen Toliver, born January 5, 1816.\n\n13 ix. Joseph Miller Toliver, born November 13, 1821.\n\n14 x. George Washington Toliver, born March 22, 182.\n\n15 xi. Catharine Toliver, born August 13, 1827.\n\nJohn Toliver and Sylvania Cude were married on July 24, 1859 in Lawrence, Indiana, United States (book C, page 580). Sylvania Cude2,4,6 was born about 1790 in North Carolina, United States. She appeared in the census in 1850 in Shawswick Township, Lawrence, Indiana, United States. It lists Sylvania Lewis (55), widow, living with son Robert. She appeared in the census in 1860 in Louisville, Clay, Illinois, United States. She died on September 9, 1863 at the age of 73 in Lawrence, Indiana, United States. Her Find A Grave memorial reports that she died in 1853. However, the stone is in rough condition and may have been misread. The marriage index and the 1860 census indicate that she was living well past the 1853 date. She was buried at Sheeks Cemetery in Lawrence, Indiana, United States. She was buried with her first husband, Robert Lewis. Her grave stone was inscribed with the following: \"was born in Guilford Co. North Carolina and emigrated and settled in New Albany, Ind in 1810.\"\n\n4. Jesse Toliver2,4 was born between 1790 and 1800 in North Carolina, United States.\n\nIt has not been proven that Jesse was a son of Moses, but circumstantial evidence suggests that he was. Some of this is based on shared locations of Moses, Joel, John and Jesse that suggest they were closely related. Also, DNA from descendants of Jesse, John and Joel are a match.\n\nHe appeared in the census in 1830 in Morgan, Alabama, United States. It lists 1 male under 5, 1 male 10-15, 1 male 15-20, 1 male 30-40, 1 female under 5, 2 females 5-10, 1 female 10-15, 1 female 15-20 and 1 female 40-50.\n\nHe died before September 21, 1835 at the age of 45 in Morgan, Alabama, United States. Alfred Toliver was appointed administrator of Jesse's estate on this date, so Jesse was clearly deceased by this time.\n\nJesse Toliver and Hannah [Unknown] were married about 1811 in Tennessee, United States. Hannah [Unknown] was born about 1790 in North Carolina, United States. She appeared in the census in 1830 in Morgan, Alabama, United States. She appeared in the census in 1850 in District 7, Lawrence, Alabama, United States. It lists Hannah (60), Elizebeth Toliver Dement (28) and William (20), living next door to son William. She died Unknown.\n\nThird Generation\n\n5. Christine Toliver2,4,6 was born on November 2, 1802 in North Carolina, United States.\n\nShe appeared in the census in 1830 in Lawrence, Indiana, United States. She appeared in the census in 1860 in Township 5 Range 6, Clay, Illinois, United States. It lists Christina [Hall] (62) and children George Davis (25) and Ruth (20) and James (18) Brown.\n\nShe died on February 27, 1870 at the age of 67 in Mitchell, Lawrence, Indiana, United States.\n\nChristine Toliver and Bluford Gatliff Davis were married on June 3, 1819 in Madison, Alabama, United States (vol. 2, page 295). They were divorced by 1835, based on the fact that Bluford remarried that year. Bluford Gatliff Davis2,4,6 was born in 1799 in Kentucky, United States. He appeared in the census in 1830 in Lawrence, Indiana, United States. It lists 2 males under 5, 1 male 20-29, 1 female 5-9, 1 female 10-14 and 1 female 20-29. He died on March 11, 1870 at the age of 71 in Coles, Illinois, United States.\n\nBluford Gatliff Davis and Christine Toliver had the following child:\n\n16 i. George Washington Davis, born November 17, 1835.\n\nChristine Toliver and Joseph Brown were married on January 24, 1836 in Lawrence, Indiana, United States (book A, page 580). Joseph Brown4,6 was born Unknown. He died Unknown.\n\nJoseph Brown and Christine Toliver had the following children:\n\n17 i. Ruth Brown, born about 1840.\n\n18 ii. James Brown, born about 1841.\n\nChristine Toliver and Joseph Hall were married on May 3, 1850 in Clay, Illinois, United States. (vol. A, page 35). Joseph Hall6,12 was born between 1794 and 1804. He died before 1860 at the age of 66.\n\n6. Sarah \"Sally\" Toliver2,4,6,13 was born on December 12, 1804 in Ashe, North Carolina, United States.\n\nShe appeared in the census in 1840 in Clay, Illinois, United States. She appeared in the census in 1850 in Clay & Richland District, Clay, Illinois, United States. Sally appeared in the census in 1860 in Township 5 Range 6, Clay, Illinois, United States. It lists Sarah [Krows] (55), William (24) and James (22).\n\nShe died on March 13, 1886 at the age of 81 in Lawrence, Indiana, United States. This data has not been proven.\n\nSarah \"Sally\" Toliver and Winston Krows were married on March 21, 1823 in Lawrence, Indiana, United States (book A, page 83). Winston Krows2,4,6,11 was born in March, 1801 in North Carolina, United States. Documents spell the surname many ways. His grave stone shows Krow. The Lawrence County marriage index reports it as Crow. Censuses for Winston and other family members show Krows, Crouse or Krouse, with Krows appearing often. His birth date is based on the age reported on his grave stone of 51y/7m [the number of days is illegible]. He appeared in the census in 1840 in Clay, Illinois, United States. It lists 2 males under 5, 2 males 5-9, 1 male 10-14, 1 male 30-39, 1 female 5-9 and 1 female 30-39. He is listed as Vincent. He appeared in the census in 1850 in Clay & Richland District, Clay, Illinois, United States. It lists Vincen (49), Sarah (46), Joseph (18), William (17), Solomon (15) and James (12). His occupation was farmer. He died on October 2, 1852 at the age of 51 in Illinois, United States. He was buried at Tolliver Cemetery in Clay, Illinois, United States.\n\nWinston Krows and Sarah Toliver had the following children:\n\n19 i. Katharine Krows, born November 10, 1828.\n\n20 ii. Joseph Krows, born about 1832.\n\n21 iii. William A. Krows, born January 18, 1834.\n\n22 iv. Solomon Krows, born about 1835.\n\n23 v. James H. Krows, born about 1838.\n\n24 vi. John Krows, born December 23, 1842.\n\nSarah \"Sally\" Toliver and John Kellums were married on April 21, 1859 in Clay, Illinois, United States. THIS MARRIAGE IS QUESTIONABLE. Many researchers list him as Vincen/Vincent Kellams and the marriage date as December 21, 1859 in Clay County, Illinois. I cannot find any records for this person, nor is this marriage listed in the Illinois Marriage Index 1763-1900 on the state's web site. The marriage index does list the marriage of John Kellums to Sarah Krous on April 21, 1859 (vol. B, page 58) in Clay County, Illinois. However, the censuses never show them together. Sarah is listed in the 1860 and 1870 censuses with her children. Her last name was reported as Krows. John was listed in the 1860, 70 and 80 censuses with children. He was in a different township than Sarah, and the 1880 census lists him as a widower. He is buried with his first wife Elizabeth. The only data that supports this marriage are the records for Sarah's 3rd marriage. The Illinois Marriage Index 1763-1900 lists her as Sarah Kellums, and a marriage index on Ancestry.com list her as Sarah Toliver. John Kellums4,11 was born on May 1, 1801 in Virginia, United States. He died on April 14, 1882 at the age of 80. He was buried at Tolliver Cemetery in Clay, Illinois, United States.\n\nSarah \"Sally\" Toliver and Isom Hall were married on April 4, 1882 in Clay, Illinois, United States. The Illinois Marriage Index 1763-1900 lists the marriage of Unknown Hall to Sarah Kellums on April 4, 1882 in Clay County, Illinois (vol. 1, page 62). Ancestry.com's Illinois County Marriage Index 1800-1940 lists the marriage of Sarah Toliver, born about 1804, to Isom Hall in 1882 in Clay County, Illinois. TolliverFamilhy.com reports the marriage date as April 13, 1882. Both of these dates precede John's death date. Sarah was the sister of Isom's first wife, Anna Toliver. Isom Hall2,4,6,14, son of Robert Hall and Nancy Isom, was born on April 1, 1802 in Virginia, United States. He appeared in the census in 1850 in Marion Township, Lawrence, Indiana, United States. It lists Isom (48), Ann (43), Robert (16), William (12), John (10), Martin (8), George (6) and Milly (1). He appeared in the census in 1860 in Marion Township, Lawrence, Indiana, United States. It lists Isom (58), Ann (45), Martin (17), George (14), Milly (10) and Martha (granddaughter?) (15). He appeared in the census in 1870 in Marion Township, Lawrence, Indiana, United States. It lists Isom (68), Anna (64), Milly (19) and grandchildren Thomas (13), Sophronia (11), William (9) and Martha (7) [children of Robert]. He appeared in the census in 1880 in Marion Township, Lawrence, Indiana, United States. It lists Isom (78), Anna (73) and grandchildren Ellen (28), Mattie (17) and William (20) Hall. It reported that he had a broken thigh. He died on February 13, 1886 at the age of 83 in Lawrence, Indiana, United States. He was buried at Freedom Cemetery in Lawrence, Indiana, United States.\n\n7. Anna Toliver2,4,6,14 was born on June 10, 1807 in Tennessee, United States. Some of her children reported her birth place as Alabama.\n\nShe appeared in the census in 1850 in Marion Township, Lawrence, Indiana, United States. She appeared in the census in 1860 in Marion Township, Lawrence, Indiana, United States. She appeared in the census in 1870 in Marion Township, Lawrence, Indiana, United States. She appeared in the census in 1880 in Marion Township, Lawrence, Indiana, United States.\n\nShe died on February 19, 1882 at the age of 74 in Lawrence, Indiana, United States. She was buried at Freedom Cemetery in Lawrence, Indiana, United States.\n\nAnna Toliver and Isom Hall were married on April 29, 1824 in Lawrence, Indiana, United States (book A, page 106). After Anna died, Isom married her sister Sarah. Isom Hall2,4,6,14, son of Robert Hall and Nancy Isom, was born on April 1, 1802 in Virginia, United States. He appeared in the census in 1850 in Marion Township, Lawrence, Indiana, United States. It lists Isom (48), Ann (43), Robert (16), William (12), John (10), Martin (8), George (6) and Milly (1).
