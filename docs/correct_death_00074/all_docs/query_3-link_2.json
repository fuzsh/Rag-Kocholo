        "text": "Chet Atkins, the versatile guitarist and record producer who was a leader in the growth of Nashville as a music center in the 1950's and part of the elite force that transformed country music and affected popular musical taste in America, died on Saturday at his home in Nashville. He was 77.\n\nMr. Atkins had battled cancer for several years, undergoing surgery to remove a brain tumor in June 1997, and had a bout with colon cancer in 1970's, The Associated Press reported.\n\nNicknamed ''The Country Gentleman,'' Chet Atkins accepted his position in the music industry with a remarkable lack of arrogance, spending his last years in his office on Nashville's ''Music Row'' singing and playing the old songs with visiting performers whose recording careers he had a hand in shaping and whose music he influenced.\n\nThough he was directly involved in turning Nashville into a distinct country music hit-making empire, he played down his own ingenuity as a prime mover. ''All I was trying to do was to keep my job,'' he recalled in 1988 of the days when Nashville was becoming the center of country music in the mid-1950's. ''And the way you keep your job is to surprise the friends and neighbors with each new record.''\n\nChester Burton Atkins was born on June 20, 1924, on his grandfather's 50-acre farm in the Clinch Mountains near Luttrell, Tenn. He spent his childhood in poverty, and he said that left him with a sense of insecurity. ''We were so poor and everybody around us was so poor that it was the 40's before any of us knew there had been a Depression,'' he wrote in his 1975 autobiography, ''Country Gentleman.''\n\nMusic was central to his upbringing. His grandfather was a champion fiddler, and his father, James Arley Atkins, was a music teacher, piano tuner and sometime evangelistic singer. His half-brother, Jim, would become the rhythm guitarist in the Les Paul Trio in the 1930's, and his other brother, Lowell, also played guitar.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
