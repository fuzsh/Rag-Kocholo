After Chet Atkinsâ€™ death in 2001, Bank of America commissioned Tennessee sculptor Russell Faxon to create this statue in his honor. The life-sized bronze statue of Atkins is situated outside their Nashville headquarters at the corner of Fifth Avenue (Now Rep. John Lewis Way) and Union Street. Atkins is depicted sitting on a stool and playing a guitar. There is a second stool (not pictured) to the right so you can have a photo opportunity as a duet.
