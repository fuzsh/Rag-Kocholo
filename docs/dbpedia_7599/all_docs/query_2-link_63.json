        "text": "This variety of spaghetti is square rather than round, bringing to mind the the neck of a guitar, or chitarra in Italian. In Abruzzo, this cut is prepared with a meat sauce of beef, pork and lamb. Less traditional sauces might include wild boar, hare or venison. Spaghetti alla Chitarra goes well with rich sauces.\n\nThe selected semolina wheat used in this pasta is strictly of Italian origin and of the best quality, including the Senatore Capelli variety which is renowned for cooking to al-dente. It also gives the pasta a golden color. Bronze cut pasta molds create a rough and porous texture much like homemade pasta. The low temperature drying method known as cirillo preserves the distinct texture and aroma.\n\nCooking Time:\n\n12 minutes\n\nBe a Part of the Rogers Collection\n\nWe work with the best producers in the world, and we partner with fine purveyors to make their premium products available all across the United States.
