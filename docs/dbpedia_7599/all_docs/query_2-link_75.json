        "text": "Linguine al Limone is a creamy pasta that bursts with the bright flavors of summer. Lemon juice, lemon zest, and a touch of basil add freshness, while the Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, butter, and pasta water create a starchy sauce that when tossed with the pasta, creates a luxurious and decadent dish that definitely lands it in the comfort food category. And with 5 main ingredients you probably have on hand, this can be made quickly, and simply, without running to the store.\n\nPasta al limone is the dish I make when I’m in the mood for fettuccine alfredo, but want something that tastes a little bit lighter, and brighter.\n\nAl limone is very similar to Alfredo in that Alfredo includes the same core ingredients: butter, pasta water, and Parmigiano Reggiano. It is definitely a filling dish.\n\nBut the lemon juice and lemon zest somehow make linguine al limone taste a little less heavy.\n\nTechnique\n\nThe technique used to make the sauce for pasta al limone is the same as the technique for making bucatini cacio e pepe, spaghetti alla Nerano, and fettuccine Alfredo.\n\nThe technique involves tossing the pasta in the pan with the cheese, pasta water, and in the case of al limone, butter.\n\nThis process allows the ingredients to emulsify, and create a creamy texture that clings to the linguine.\n\nTo see my technique on how to make this exact recipe, watch my YouTube video below in the recipe card.\n\nEssentially, all pasta should be tossed, or flipped, using this method, but for al limone, cacio e pepe, and the others listed above, it is critical to the success of the dish.\n\nThe technique isn’t hard to learn – it just takes a little patience. But once you’ve learned it you will use it all the time and you can impress your friends or family with your fancy flipping skills. 😉\n\nNote: you may find other recipes that use heavy cream to make al limone. Traditionally, this recipe does not call for heavy cream, although it may help you achieve that creamy texture if you’re not comfortable with tossing/flipping. Think of it as a cheat code. And don’t feel guilty about it – I too sometimes use heavy cream, such as in my creamy garlic mushroom pasta and fettuccine alfredo recipe.\n\nHow to make linguine al limone\n\nEach number corresponds to the numbered written steps below.\n\nZest 2 medium-sized lemons and roughly chop the zest. Once zested, juice the same lemons until you have ~5 tablespoons of lemon juice. The amount of juice you get from lemons will vary. Pro tip: To maximize the amount of juice you get from a lemon, run it under warm water, then roll it on top of a clean surface while applying downward pressure before slicing it in half.\n\nUsing the fine edge of a cheese grater, grate 1 1/4 cups of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. Bring a pot of water to a boil adding 2 tbsp of kosher salt per gallon of water and begin to cook the linguine until al dente.\n\nA few minutes before the pasta is done cooking, heat a pan to low heat and add the butter and olive oil. Then, add half the lemon zest and allow it to cook for 1-2 minutes.\n\nPull your linguine out of the pot using tongs and place the al dente pasta in the pan with the butter, olive oil, and zest. Toss, or stir to incorporate.\n\nAdd the lemon juice and toss again to coat. Turn the heat off the pan and wait 30 seconds. Then, begin adding the cheese a little bit at a time.\n\nToss and stir quickly to emulsify. If the sauce is too thick, add some pasta water, a tablespoon or two at a time, until the consistency is just right. Taste test and add kosher salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately as the pasta can dry out quickly. If needed, add a bit more cooler pasta water and toss again right before serving to loosen the pasta back up. Top each plate with a touch of the remaining zest, and a sprinkle of basil or parsley (completely optional), and more grated Parmigiano Reggiano. Enjoy!\n\nMore lemony goodness\n\nIt is no surprise that I love lemon. My grandmother’s family was from Southern Italy where lemons are a religion, so you could say the love of lemon is in my blood.\n\nAnd if you are looking at linguine al limone, it’s a safe bet that you too love lemons. If that is true, check out these other foods that include lemon in some way, shape, or form.\n\nLemon caper pasta\n\nCreamy lemon chicken pasta\n\nLemon ricotta stuffed zucchini\n\nLemon garlic shrimp pasta\n\nLimoncello spritz – the perfect cocktail for summer gatherings\n\nChicken francese\n\nWhat to serve with linguine al limone\n\nThe cheese and butter make this a heavier dish. For that reason, I like to serve pasta al limone with a lighter side.\n\nSalads, such as chickpea and arugula salad, or Via Carota’s green salad, would be perfect.\n\nSauteed greens would also be a great side, such as broccoli rabe with garlic, or sauteed spinach.\n\nIf you’ve enjoyed this Linguine al Limone recipe, or any recipe on this site, we want to know so tell us in the comments below. We would love to hear how you did and it’s nice to show others as well. Thanks!"
