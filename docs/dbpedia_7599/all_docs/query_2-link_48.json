        "text": "I'm gonna show you how to make Zeppoles from scratch, also known as Italian doughnuts, usually found at street fairs, served in a brown paper bag and served with a mount of powdered sugar. I get zeppoles once a year at the san gennnaro feast in NYC. If you ever wondered how to make donuts without yeast this may be the recipe you're looking for. These are the best doughnuts in my opinion and one of my favorite childhood foods. And this is the easiest donut recipe I have come across. This is my first dessert and of course, it's an Italian dessert. Be careful when you fry donuts at home.\n\nGet in the kitchen with me for this one. It's not as flashy or visually appealing as my other videos but learning how to train your palate and how to make a vinaigrette is super important. We are going to build a vinaigrette step by step, tasting it along the way to help you understand taste, flavors and balance. I will also show you how to properly dress a salad and how to plate it. Hope you like this different kind of format.\n\nIn today's video, I will show you how to make a tasty eggs benedict with blender hollandaise sauce. You now know how to poach an egg (video for that here) now I'm going to show you to put it all together for eggs benedict at home. I make a blender hollandaise sauce, rather than use a double boiler, this is often called a 1 minute hollandaise sauce because of how easy and quick it is to make.\n\nMy sauce actually broke in this video so I'll also show you\n\nhow to fix a broken hollandaise sauce."
