        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nToday, I am setting the record straight. I am sharing with you my family’s traditional French Ratatouille Recipe.\n\nGrowing up in France, Ratatouille was probably my favorite dish I assisted my Mom in preparing. It was a true labor of love, and it brings back fond memories every time I make it. It involved careful slicing and individual browning of each vegetable to enhance their sweetness, then letting them simmer together until all the flavors have blended. Even on a gray and rainy Normandy day, the house filled with delicious aromas of sunny Provence. And in the end, our family would gobble down the pot in a fraction of the time it took to make it…\n\nHowever, upon the release of Pixar’s Ratatouille, a common misperception began to irk me – the dish depicted in the film was not traditional ratatouille. The authentic version is not a neatly arranged plate; it’s a hearty, somewhat disheveled stew. In truth, the dish from the movie is Confit byaldi, a twist on the conventional French dish ratatouille, concocted by French chef Michel Guérard and adapted for the movie by Chef Thomas Keller. While it may share the same ingredients list as ratatouille, its preparation method – layering and baking – results in a visually more appealing dish compared to the rustic charm of the original vegetable stew.\n\nSo, let’s find out what real French Ratatouille is supposed to be.\n\nIngredients to Make Ratatouille\n\nIronically, though it’s a summer vegetable stew, preparing an authentic Ratatouille demands winter-worthy heat. Fortunately, these veggies are year-round staples in most US stores. During summer, I opt for an oven-roasted version, sparing my kitchen from excessive warmth.\n\nHere are the key ingredients for our French Ratatouille Recipe, along with their nutritional benefits:\n\nEggplant: Provides a tender, hearty texture and absorbs flavors beautifully. Rich in fiber and antioxidants.\n\nZucchini: Adds a mild sweetness and is packed with vitamins A and C.\n\nMixed color bell peppers: Offer a sweet flavor and vibrant colors, and are rich in vitamin C.\n\nOnion and Garlic: Create a savory base, enhancing the overall depth of flavor. They contain beneficial antioxidants and are known for their anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nCanned San Marzano tomatoes or ripe Roma tomatoes: Contribute to the sauce base and are high in lycopene, a powerful antioxidant.\n\nBay leaf, thyme, oregano: For an aromatic and earthy flavor.\n\nLemon zest: Adds a hint of citrus brightness, balancing the dish.\n\nStep-by-Step Preparation\n\nFor the full recipe, see below. Here’s a quick outline:\n\nPrepare the eggplant and let it sweat while working on the other vegetables.\n\nSauté the onions and garlic. Transfer to a bowl.\n\nBrown the zucchini, then the bell peppers, transferring to the bowl as you go.\n\nWipe the eggplant dry then brown it.\n\nAdd all vegetables back to the pot.\n\nAdd the herbs and tomatoes, then simmer.\n\nRecipe Tips and Substitutions\n\nIf using fresh Roma tomatoes, remove the seeds and cut them in 1/2″ chunks. If using canned whole tomatoes, crush them gently with your hands in a bowl or cut them in 1/2″ chunks.\n\nThe critical step of cooking the vegetables individually ensures they reach a lovely caramelized state, which lends a delightful sweetness to the dish.\n\nFor a low sodium option, skip the salting of the eggplant.\n\nYou can also add rosemary for an extra flavor of Provence\n\nMix in black Niçoise olives\n\nUse some yellow squash with the zucchini for more variety.\n\nServing Suggestions\n\nThis traditional French Ratatouille is versatile enough to serve as a side dish with chicken or grilled fish.\n\nFor a hearty breakfast or a light meal, top it with a poached egg or mix it into your scrambled eggs.\n\nFor a vegetarian meal, serve it over pasta or brown or black rice. You can also add chickpeas for an extra protein boost.\n\nOr eat it on its own with a slice or crusty whole grain bread!\n\nStorage Instructions\n\nStore leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to five days. You can also freeze the ratatouille for up to three months. Reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave.\n\nConclusion\n\nA traditional French Ratatouille is more than just a vegetable stew recipe; it’s a heartwarming fragrant dish that brings the rustic charm of French cuisine right into your kitchen. I hope this one-pot recipe becomes a favorite in your home as well.\n\nBon appétit!\n\nOther delicious recipes to try:\n\nRoasted Ratatouille Vegetables\n\nEggplant, Zucchini and Tomato Gratin\n\nEggplant in Tomato Sauce\n\nGrilled Vegetable Salad\n\nFrench Ratatouille\n\nFrom my kitchen to yours: discover the real traditional French Ratatouille Recipe, a fragrant one-pot stew of vegetables and herbs simmered on the stove.\n\nPrep Time15 minutes mins\n\nCook Time1 hour hr 25 minutes mins\n\nTotal Time1 hour hr 40 minutes mins\n\nServings: 6\n\nAuthor: Veronique Eichler\n\nCook ModePrevent your screen from going dark\n\nIngredients\n\n1 1/4 pound eggplant (about 1 large) halved or quartered and cut into 1/2-inch slices\n\n6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil\n\n3/4 pound Onion (about 2 medium) thinly sliced\n\n6 large garlic cloves thinly sliced\n\n1 pound mixed bell peppers red, yellow, orange or green, cut into slices about 1/2 inch wide\n\n1 pound zucchini (about 2 large) halved or quartered and sliced about 1/2 inch thick\n\n1 can San Marzano tomatoes (28 oz can) or 1 lb fresh ripe Roma tomatoes, seeded and coarsely chopped\n\n1 bay leaf\n\n1 tbsp fresh thyme (or 1 tsp dried)\n\n1/2 tbsp fresh oregano (or 1/2 tsp dried)\n\n2 strips of lemon peel\n\nSalt and Freshly ground pepper to taste\n\n4 tbsp fresh basil or parsley, for garnish\n\nInstructions\n\nWash and slice the eggplant.

Stir in fresh basil shortly before serving or top with fresh parsley.\n\nNotes\n\nRatatouille keeps well in the refrigerator for about five days and is even better reheated, as the flavors will have blended together nicely.
