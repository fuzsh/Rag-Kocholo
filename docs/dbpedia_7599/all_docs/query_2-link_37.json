There’s nothing needlessly extra about this recipe, and you won’t want it any other way.

A classic Italian pasta for which “authentic” recipes abound, lemon pasta—or, as it’s known in Italian, pasta al limone—is a simple pasta dish consisting of a long noodle-shaped pasta (usually spaghetti), lemon (zest and juice), butter or olive oil, Parmesan, salt, and a generous amount of black pepper.\n\nNo Heavy Cream Needed. Like Ricotta Pasta, one of the neatest things about this spaghetti al limone is the fact that you don’t need heavy ingredients to create a rich, silky sauce. In fact, this is a lemon pasta with NO heavy cream at all! The pasta’s own starches create the magic.\n\nPantry Ingredients. You know all those times you open up the refrigerator, dig through the pantry, and ask yourself: What am I going to make for dinner? The answer is lemon pasta. It’s made with six simple ingredients and you likely have most (or all!) of them on hand.\n\nLight and Flavorful. Lemon pasta has a mouthwatering mix of umami Parmesan cheese, bright lemon, freshly cracked black peppercorns, and butter. It ticks a lot of those comfort food boxes, and yet it still manages to be a light pasta dish that won’t leave you feeling stuffed.\n\n5 Star Review\n\n“So easy and flavorful! Will definitely do this one on repeat.”\n\n— Lisa —\n\nMore About Lemon Pasta\n\nThe origin of pasta al limone is disputed, but it is especially popular in southern Italy and Sicily, regions that are known for their lemon crop.\n\nA tantalizing testament to the sentiment “less is more,” lemon pasta isn’t outstanding despite its simplicity—it is sensational because of it.\n\nEvery bite wows more than the last; lemon pasta is positively delicious, and it’s puzzling how good something this easy, made with so few ingredients, can taste.\n\nEating lemon pasta (several bites of which I devoured directly from the skillet using my fingers if you must know—don’t tell my Nonna) caused me to wonder why on earth I complicate my cooking more than necessary.\n\nThis time, more is not more. These few ingredients are enough.\n\nHow to Make Lemon Pasta\n\nThe Ingredients\n\nUnsalted Butter. I prefer butter to extra virgin olive oil for building creamy-textured pasta sauces like this one.\n\nLemon. Bright flavor from both the zest and juice gives this pasta its name and makes the flavors sing.\n\nMarket Swap\n\nWhen fragrant Meyer lemons are in season, they’re a fantastic addition to this lemon pasta recipe.\n\nParmesan. Make sure to buy the real-deal, and grate it yourself right off of the block. Because this recipe contains so few ingredients, their quality really counts. Just ask Penne Alla Vodka.\n\nPasta. Spaghetti is the classic pasta shape for lemon pasta, but any long noodle such as fettuccine, angel hair pasta, or linguine works too. Shorter noodles do not work as well, since part of how the magical, silky sauce forms is due to the way long noodles can be dragged and tossed through the liquid.\n\nGarlic. Optional but delicious. It’s in some classic recipes but not others; personally, I love the way it tastes with pasta al limone, but don’t stress if you don’t have any on hand.\n\nKosher Salt and Freshly Ground Black Pepper. We’re especially generous with the black pepper around here.\n\nThe Directions\n\nCook the Pasta. Don’t forget to reserve some of the pasta water.\n\nStart the Sauce. Sauté the garlic with the butter.\n\nToss. Add the pasta, some of the pasta water, and toss to coat.\n\nFinish. Add the lemon zest and juice, then the cheese. Toss continuously, adding in salt and pepper. Serve lemon pasta hot with additional cheese and black pepper, and ENJOY!\n\nRecipe Variations\n\nWe love this pasta just as it is: simple and perfect, without any additional fuss. If you’d like to augment it or add protein, here are few tasty suggestions.\n\nShredded or Diced Chicken. Pasta al limone with chicken is a sure bet. Top it with grilled, sautéed, or even simply shredded chicken (use this stovetop method, Instant Pot Chicken, or Crock Pot Shredded Chicken to cook it).\n\nItalian-Style Chicken. For a restaurant-inspired meal, serve with Chicken Francaise or Chicken Piccata. Sauteed Italian chicken sausage would be yummy too.\n\nShrimp. Take a note from Garlic Shrimp Pasta and add sautéed shrimp or Grilled Shrimp.\n\nHerbs. Add a handful of whatever is in your refrigerator. Fresh basil is classic for lemon pasta, and fresh parsley feels appropriate. Stay away from dried herbs, which are lackluster in flavor. Since you really don’t need any herbs at all (we enjoyed this recipe without), if you do decide to add them, make sure they are fresh.\n\nGreens. Stir baby spinach or baby arugula into the lemon pasta just before you begin tossing the pasta in the sauce; it will wilt and up the veggie factor in your dinner.\n\nStorage Tips\n\nTo Store. Place leftovers in an airtight storage container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.\n\nTo Reheat. Gently rewarm lemon pasta in a large skillet on the stove over medium-low heat, adding a splash of water as needed to thin the sauce. Toss the noodles often and brighten them up with a squeeze of lemon.\n\nTo Freeze. Store pasta in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 3 months. Let thaw overnight in the refrigerator before reheating.\n\nWhat to Serve with Lemon Pasta\n\nBread. You can never go wrong. Try No Knead Foccacia or Rosemary Olive Oil Bread is fabulous too.\n\nSalad. Fresh, simple salads like this Caesar Shaved Brussels Sprouts Salad or Arugula Salad are ideal. Assemble them while the pasta cooks.\n\nVegetables. Add veggies to your meal by pairing this lemon pasta with a side of Roasted Zucchini or Roasted Eggplant.\n\nNon-Stick Skillet. A non-stick skillet will keep the pasta from getting stuck on the bottom.\n\nCitrus Juicer. The easiest way to juice a lemon.\n\nColander. For draining the pasta.\n\nRecipe Tips and Tricks\n\nGrate the Parmesan Yourself. Don’t use the shelf-stable shaky cheese for your lemon pasta! I find using a rasp-style grater to grate Parmigiano-Reggiano extra fine allows it to melt into the sauce instantly, resulting in a super smooth, luscious sauce. Another quick option is to cut a block of Parmesan into a few pieces, then grind the pieces in your food processor. Once grated, Parmesan can last in your refrigerator for weeks and freezer for months.\n\nUse High-Quality Ingredients. In all of my Italian recipes, I like to use whole wheat pasta for its additional fiber and nutrients. I also recommend buying a higher quality brand if you can. As with the Parmesan, since there are so few ingredients in this recipe, each one of them counts.\n\nDon’t Forget to Save the Cooking Liquid. The secret to making this creamy lemon pasta recipe without cream is the pasta cooking liquid. By reducing the amount of water in which you cook the pasta, you end up with a starchier pasta water that you can use to create a thicker pasta sauce. I borrowed the idea of thickening the pasta-cooking liquid from my one-pan Chicken Broccoli Ziti, another pasta that becomes creamy as it cooks in a lesser amount of liquid.\n\nLemon Pasta (Pasta al Limone)\n\n4.94 from 80 votes\n\nCook ModePrevent your screen from going dark\n\nLemon pasta is a simple, sublime classic Italian recipe made with lemon, Parmesan, butter, and black pepper.

Cook the noodles until al dente according to package instructions. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water, then drain the pasta.\n\nWhen the pasta is nearly done cooking, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook 30 seconds. If the garlic is done cooking before the pasta is ready, remove the pan from the heat so the garlic doesn’t burn.\n\nIMMEDIATELY (as soon as the pasta is drained) add the hot pasta to the skillet with the garlic. Pour in 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta water. Increase the heat to medium-high, then with a pair of tongs, toss to coat. Continue cooking and tossing constantly, until the sauce turns shiny and coats the noodles—it will take a minute or so. The pasta will be coated in a shiny, silky sauce. If the pasta becomes too tight at any point, splash in a tablespoon or two of the reserved pasta water (add the water slowly so that the pasta doesn’t become watery).\n\nZest the lemon over the top. Cut the lemon into quarters, then squeeze in the lemon juice. Sprinkle on the Parmesan. Toss again to combine. The cheese might be a bit clumpy at first, but just keep tossing, adding the tiniest splashes of pasta water only as needed. Add a good pinch of salt and several generous grinds of black pepper. Toss again. Taste and add more salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to serving plates and top each serving with a sprinkle of extra Parm and a bit more black pepper. Enjoy hot.\n\nVideo\n\nNotes\n\nTO STORE: Place leftovers in an airtight storage container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.\n\nTO REHEAT: Gently rewarm pasta in a large skillet on the stove over medium-low heat, adding a splash of water as needed to thin the sauce.

The exception to this is black pepper, which is often added as a finishing touch.\n\nWhat Wine Should I Serve With Lemon Pasta?\n\nServe a dry, crisp white wine with lemon pasta. Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Grigio are both solid choices.\n\nRelated Recipes\n\nPasta is incredibly versatile and the starting point of many of my quick dinner recipes.
