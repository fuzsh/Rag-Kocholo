No offence to the director, it’ll remain nameless.\n\n\"It just got lost in post-production.\"\n\nJosh and Tamsin were both dating different people at the time. But the celebrity duo fell in love during the shoot and they subsequently embarked \"on a long road trip\" together in the US.\n\nThe actor - who now lives in the UK with his family - shared: \"We were shooting here in London and both had significant others, and both realised that wasn’t going to work because we really liked each other.\n\n\"So I broke up with my girlfriend, she broke up with her boyfriend, and then after we stopped filming, we started to date. But I was living in New York and she was living in London, so we went on a few vacations together.\n\n\"Then she came out to the States and we went on a long road trip where she met my parents and it kept going. And then she kept staying with me and I kept staying with her. We were living a lot of the time between houses together, and then she got pregnant and then we got married.\""
