        "text": "One of the most Classic Italian Pasta dishes, La Carbonara, Pancetta and Egg Pasta. A creamy delicious dinner recipe without the cream. Ready in 15 minutes or less.\n\nIf you are looking for a fast delicious pasta, this is the one. The first time I ever tried La Carbonara was in Italy, meeting my family in law for the first time. You may want to try this Authentic Spaghetti Carbonara.\n\nActually that was the first time I ate most of these amazing Italian dishes. My husband always says that one of the reasons I married him was because I would never have to go without Pasta. And he could be right!\n\nHe even has an uncle that eats a plate of Spaghetti for breakfast, oh how I can relate to that!\n\nHow to make Carbonara\n\nIn a large frying pan add the oil , pancetta and hot pepper flakes (if using) cook on medium heat until the pancetta is cooked (but not too crispy). Stirring often so the pancetta doesn’t burn.\n\nWhile pancetta is cooking , boil a large pot of water, when the water has boiled add some salt and the pasta and cook until al dente.\n\nWhile pasta is cooking, in a small bowl beat the 3 eggs, then add the parmesan and mix very well.\n\nWhen the pasta is cooked turn the heat back on the pancetta (to medium high), add the drained pasta toss together to combine well for about 20-30 seconds.\n\nRemove the pan from the heat add the egg mixture, constantly tossing together, add a tablespoon or two of pasta water to make sure it is very creamy and continue to toss until well blended.\n\nTop with parmesan cheese if desired. Serve immediately.\n\nWhere did it originate?\n\nAs the story goes the first serving of Carbonara was in 1944. Apparently it was a combination of ingredients that were available to American soldiers and the creative hand of a Roman cook.\n\nThe result was the beginning of the classic spaghetti alla carbonara in other words eggs, bacon (later to become guanciale) and cheese. Overtime the recipe has evolved into the one we all know and love today!\n\nTip for making the best Carbonara\n\nI learned a secret to making this pasta extra creamy, it came from a friend while sharing an espresso one Sunday morning. She told me that her secret was adding 3 tablespoons of grated (freshly grated really does make a difference) parmesan cheese into the beaten egg mixture and right she was.\n\nIf you prefer pecorino that would work too. Or you could use half and half.\n\nBe sure your eggs are room temperature. And please no cream in the Classic Carbonara!\n\nDifferent ways to make it\n\nSome Italians swear that you should use only guanciale (my daughter included), some believe you should only use pecorino (yup, her again), some use only egg yolks and not the whole egg.\n\nSome make it with mezza maniche, rigatoni and of course Spaghetti.\n\nThis is the recipe that I was taught and that I think we have perfected over the years, I hope you enjoy it. Buon Appetito!\n\nRe posted from November 2013."
