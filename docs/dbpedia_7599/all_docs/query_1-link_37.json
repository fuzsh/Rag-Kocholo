        "text": "Best Heist Movies of All Time\n\nCrooks. Thieves. Liars. And these are the ones we’re rooting for. In the heist and caper films, we see the hero hatching a plan, putting together a crew, and then pulling off the job, usually in order to turn the screws against an institution or person that’s wronged them — or maybe just for the thrill of sticking up banks. Either way, we put together a list of the 78 best-reviewed heist movies of all time for you to look over, each with at least 20 reviews and sorted by ranking formula, which factors how long ago a movie was released and how many critics reviews it got overall.
