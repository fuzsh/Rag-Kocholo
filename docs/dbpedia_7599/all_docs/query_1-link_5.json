        "text": "Happy National Spaghetti Day! You might not have realized that we’re all supposed to be celebrating the slurpy, tomatoey, warm, cozy noodle dish, but is there any reason to complain? While it’s about as common as peanut butter and jelly, its popularity has managed to get it some pretty sweet moments in the spotlight. So while you wait for your pot of pasta water to start boiling, check out these choice spaghetti scenes in movie making history.\n\n1. Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs\n\nTwisters are supposed to be scary, but the spaghetti twister scene in CWACOM really doesn’t do much but make mouths water. Yum!\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n2. Elf\n\nElf proved that spaghetti could technically pass as a dessert. Even though Will Ferrell became physically ill from the sugar overload filming this scene, it was the perfect concoction of sweet and silly for the silver screen.\n\n3.Se7en\n\nThe glutton scene in Se7en is pretty much all you need to deter you from helping yourself to a second serving of pasta. Using it as a weapon against an individual is not only unexpected but highly disturbing.\n\n4. Goodfellas\n\nWhile we saw a zillion amazing Italian meals throughout Goodfellas, the end of the movie has a signature mention of what take-out spaghetti is like for “normal” people, making you feel kinda bad for the loss of the cushy gangster lifestyle Ray Liotta‘s character once had.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n5. Lady and the Tramp\n\nHands down the cutest spaghetti scene ever. Two animated dogs on a date, eating spaghetti, leading to a kiss…ugh. Why can’t romance be this easy for humans??"
