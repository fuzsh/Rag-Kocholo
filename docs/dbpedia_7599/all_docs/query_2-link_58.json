        "text": "What Is Kimchi? Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish whose components can vary but usually include some combination of vegetables, garlic, ginger, chili peppers, salt, and fish sauce. The mix is pickled and fermented, which was originally a way to preserve the vegetables for the winter months. Cabbage is the most common vegetable used to make kimchi although carrots, radish, cucumber, and scallions are also frequently used, too. There are hundreds of kimchi recipes that vary depending on the region and season in which they are produced, and it's very easy to make it a vegan dish by keeping all the ingredients plant-based. Kimchi is available commercially and isn't expensive, but it can be fun to put together your own based on preferences. It can take a little bit of time to prepare the vegetables, but like other fermented foods (e.g., bread, beer, and kombucha), it's mostly a hands-off experience. It will develop its flavors and its nutritional profile during that process. Kimchi keeps for a while, making it an economical, versatile, and easy-to-prepare food item to have in the fridge. #snsinstitutions #snsdesignthinkers #snsdesignthinking #snsct\n\nHappy Dry Pasta January! Yesterday we announced this first annual celebration and starting today we will give you at least one reason you should eat and celebrate dried pasta. 🤌 First, when we say “eat more dried pasta” we don’t mean that you should nash your teeth on uncooked pasta. We’re talking about cooking high quality dried pasta. We’ve got nothing against fresh pasta, heck we make the best fresh pasta on the Central Coast (in my humble opinion🍝 ) But we all know it’s not always practical to make or get fresh pasta. Dried pasta is just as tasty and actually more versatile than fresh pasta. For one thing it has an incredibly long shelf life and it’s so much easier to make it al dente ( which actually has a real heath benefit. More on that next week) Did you know that a high quality pasta like Etto , made with organic semolina and slowly dried is a high protein, complex carbohydrate and low glycemic food? Yep, it’s gotten a bad rap for far too long. One etto, which is 100grams has 13-14grams of protein. The complex carbohydrate takes longer for the body to break down so there are no sugar spikes. The low glycemic value means low in sugar compared to most other foods including many vegetables. so stay tuned to learn more about dried pasta and how to prepare it. #pasta #etto #italianfoodlover #healthypasta #semolinaflour #ettopasta\n\nHigh-Protein Rice & Beans Bowl 🥣 Elevate your taste buds with this nourishing Vegan Power Bowl, featuring black rice, roasted sweet potatoes, golden tofu, and a rich bean chili!
