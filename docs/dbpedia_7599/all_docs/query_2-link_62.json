        "text": "A rich, creamy pasta dinner can be on the table in just 30 minutes (with only 5 minutes of active prep!) with my Easy Boursin Pasta recipe. Made with fewer than 10 ingredients, this TikTok-inspired cheese and tomato pasta is a godsend for busy weeknights.\n\nCheck out another famous TikTok pasta dish next – Gigi Hadid’s Spicy Vodka Pasta.\n\nWhy You’ll Love This Creamy Boursin Cheese Pasta Recipe\n\nRemember the baked TikTok pasta with feta and tomatoes that went viral a few years back? Well, this Boursin tomato pasta is a riff on that, and friends? It’s AMAZING. In fact, I think it’s better than the original.\n\nWhen I first made the feta tomato pasta, I found the feta created a clumpy, dry sauce. But when you make the Tik Tok pasta recipe with Boursin, the cheese melts into a deliciously creamy texture that’s a million times better than the OG!\n\nAside from being the dreamy, carb-loaded dinner of your dreams, this pasta with Boursin cheese sauce is also:\n\nRidiculously Easy. You only need 6 main ingredients (plus salt, pepper, and some fresh herbs if you have them), and there’s barely any effort or skill required!! Just mince your garlic and throw everything in the oven while your pasta boils. It’s impossible to mess up.\n\nFancy Enough For Company. My creamy Boursin pasta is deliciously flavorful, velvety, garlicky, and herby. So, while it’s perfect for a busy weeknight dinner, it’s equally welcome at a dinner party or date night. Seriously – this dish can do it all!\n\nLightening Fast. With this recipe for pasta with Boursin cheese, you’ll have dinner on the table in no time at all. It’ll be ready by the time your pasta is finished boiling!\n\nMove over feta pasta!!\n\nIngredients & Substitutions\n\nAs promised, you only need a handful of simple ingredients to make my version of Tik Tok Boursin cjeese pasta. Here’s what to grab:\n\nDry Pasta – Feel free to use any pasta shape you like and cook according to package directions.\n\nBoursin Garlic & Fine Herbs Cheese – One of the benefits of making a baked Boursin pasta sauce is that the soft cheese already comes with a smattering of garlicky, herby flavor. While you’re welcome to experiment with other flavors of this gournay cheese, this one fits our Italian tomato basil flavor profile perfectly.\n\nGrape Tomatoes– Since these are grown in greenhouses, they’re readily available all year long without any negative impact on their flavor. Cherry tomatoes also work!\n\nFresh Garlic – This is the only item you’ll need to prep for the baked Boursin cheese pasta sauce. If you don’t want to dirty another dish, use jarred minced garlic or frozen garlic paste instead.\n\nOlive Oil – No need to bust out the fancy extra virgin finishing oil. Just your run-of-the-mill cooking oil is perfect!\n\nItalian Seasoning – Another time saver, this one spice bottle holds at least 5 different herbs depending on the blend! If you don’t have any on hand, you can easily make your own.\n\nPasta Water – This free ingredient is the secret sauce to making the most incredible pasta sauce you’ve ever had (not just in this recipe!). The starchy water is perfect for thinning out pasta sauce while still adding body. Even if you don’t use it all to make the sauce, save the rest — it’s the best way to get reheated Boursin and tomato pasta back to its freshly made glory.\n\nSalt & Black Pepper – For seasoning. Make sure to use freshly cracked black pepper for the most potent flavor. You can also swap in some crushed red pepper flakes if you prefer.\n\nFresh Basil – Optional, but lovely for a pop of freshness.\n\nEquipment\n\nChef’s Knife & Cutting Board ~OR~ Garlic Press\n\n9×13 Casserole Dish or Large Baking Dish\n\nLarge Pot\n\nColander\n\nLarge Cooking Spoon or Spatula\n\nHow To Make TikTok Boursin Pasta\n\nMaking the recipe for tomato feta TikTok pasta with Boursin is a snap. Here’s how it’s done:\n\nStep 1: Make Baked Tomato Pasta Sauce. Set the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Add the Boursin cheese and tomatoes to a large baking dish. Spread the olive oil, fresh garlic, and Italian seasoning evenly over top. Season with salt and black pepper to your liking. Bake for 30-35 minutes.\n\nStep 2: Cook & Drain Pasta. While the sauce bakes, cook the pasta according to the package directions in a large pot of salted water. Drain and set aside. Make sure to reserve 1 cup of the starchy, pasta water. Looking to feed more people? Check out my expert tips section to learn how!\n\nStep 3: Mix Sauce Ingredients. Remove the tomato and boursin cheese mixture from the oven and combine the ingredients until a creamy sauce forms. If the roasted tomatoes haven’t burst on their own, do so by gently pressing down on them with a spoon.\n\nStep 4: Toss. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce. Combine evenly and add the reserved pasta water until the sauce has reached your desired consistency. I find about ½ cup to be perfect.\n\nStep 5: Garnish & Enjoy! Now that the baked cheese pasta is ready, all that’s left to do is garnish and enjoy. I personally like to add a sprinkle of basil chiffonade, but you’re also welcome to add another few cracks of pepper, a light dusting of freshly grated parmesan cheese, or any other bits of pizzazz you prefer – lemon zest, fresh parsley, etc!\n\nOptional Variations & Dietary Adaptations\n\nAs much as I love this Boursin pasta bake just the way it’s written, who says it’s perfect for you? Here are just a few ways you can make the cheesy pasta your own:\n\nGluten-Free – You can make this pasta tomato bake celiac-friendly by swapping in the gluten-free noodles of your choice.\n\nVegan/Dairy-Free – To all my plant-based pals out there, good news: Boursin has created a creamy vegan Boursin cheese substitute. Hooray! It does appear to be a bit looser than the original, so I’d recommend roasting the tomatoes, herbs, and garlic separately, then combining the vegan cheese spread with the veggies when it’s out of the oven. If you need a little extra melting power, place the baking tray on a stove burner over medium heat.\n\nExperiment with Different Flavors. The garlic and herb cheese was my first love, so I’m faithful. That said, there are lots of different Boursin options these days, so have fun mixing and matching to your heart’s content. If you find a stellar combo, be sure to let me know in the comments below!\n\nExpert Tips\n\nSalt your pasta water. You only get one shot to season the pasta itself, so don’t miss it!\n\nDon’t forget to reserve some of the pasta water. It’s the key to making the best, creamiest Boursin sauce for pasta. You’ll add it to taste, but try and make sure you have a bit leftover if you plan on having leftover pasta — it’ll revivify the sauce upon reheating.\n\nLooking to feed more people?? Using the two blocks of cheese is more than enough for 16 oz pasta, but I choose to use only 10 ounces of pasta so I could get more of that delectable sauce on my plate. If you go this route, I recommend adding extra tomatoes and olive oil to the baking pan and reserving and adding a bit more pasta water to stretch the sauce further!\n\nServing Suggestions\n\nThere’s no wrong way to serve this Boursin TikTok pasta, but there are a lot of RIGHT ways. Here are some of my favorites:\n\nKISS: Keep it simple, sunshine! I like to eat my pasta with fresh basil and cracked pepper, but parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes are also lovely.\n\nProtein Power. Carbs are cool by me, but sometimes your girl needs a little extra to power through. Try adding some chicken (like my oven-baked chicken cutlets or chicken romano), pan-seared shrimp or baked shrimp, or even some ground beef or Italian sausage meatballs!\n\nExtra Veggies. Consider adding some sliced bell peppers, red onion, mushrooms, or fresh spinach to the tomatoes as they bake, or serve with a side salad or steamed broccoli.\n\nCarbs on Carbs, i.e. the best combo ever. My garlic bread baguette is the perfect thing to sop up every last bit of that Boursin cheese sauce. Garlic bread made in the air fryer is another great choice!\n\nDinner Party Perfection. When you’re hosting, the whole goal is to knock everyone’s socks off, right? Set the tone by whetting your guests’ appetites with some low-carb cauliflower arancini, offer up a perfectly paired side dish like my burrata caprese, and then bowl them over with my caramel brownie skillet served a la mode. Host with the Most? ✅ 😋\n\nStorage and Reheating Instructions\n\nCan you freeze Boursin pasta? Can you reheat Boursin cheese pasta? The answer to both of these commonly asked questions is “yes!”\n\nTo store leftovers, keep them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. If possible, reserve some of the pasta water in a separate container for reheating.\n\nTo freeze leftovers, I like to portion them into individual containers so I can pop out what I need when I need it. Again, holding onto some of that pasta water helps to make the sauce perfectly glossy again, so if you have the means, keep a small lidded ramekin of pasta water in each portion.\n\nTo reheat, I suggest microwaving in 45-second bursts and stirring between each. After the first round, you may notice the sauce is thicker than before. If you have it, now is the time to add a splash of pasta water. Continue to microwave until you reach the desired temperature.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is Boursin cheese? What is Boursin made of?\n\nBoursin is a rich, soft, spreadable cheese that comes from France (because all the fancy cheese does, right?). As far as what Boursin is made of – it’s primarily a cow’s milk cheese. But the real magic happens with the addition of garlic, herbs, salt, and other mouth-watering ingredients like pepper or shallots, depending on the variety. Plus, it spreads like a dream, making it perfect for pastas, snacks, or just straight-up on a cracker. It’s a game-changer in recipes, which is why it’s always in my fridge, and should be in yours, too!\n\nHow can you make a creamy pasta sauce without using cream cheese or heavy cream?\n\nWhy, by using Boursin, of course! This pasta sauce with Boursin cheese comes together in just 30 minutes (total time!) with only 5 minutes of prep and it is absolutely luscious.\n\nCan I make this Boursin cheese pasta ahead of time?\n\nSure thing! Just make sure to save some of the pasta water for reheating.\n\nWhat flavor of Boursin should I use to make pasta sauce?\n\nI personally prefer the garlic and herb flavor, especially with the other flavors in this dish!\n\nRelated Recipes\n\nMore Pasta Recipes\n\nSpicy Vodka Pasta\n\nGreek Yogurt Alfredo Pasta\n\nHealthy Sun Dried Tomato Pasta\n\nBurrata Pasta with Zucchini, Corn, & Tomatoes\n\nChicken Caprese Pasta\n\nCreamy Lemon Chicken Pasta\n\nHealthy Pasta Primavera\n\nConnect With Me!\n\nIf you make this pasta recipe or any of my other recipes, I would absolutely love to know!
