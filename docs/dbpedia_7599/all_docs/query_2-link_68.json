        "text": "1 – link chorrizo sausage\n\n1/2 c. diced onions\n\n3 cloves garlic, smashed\n\n1 can diced tomatos +1/2 can water\n\n1/2 c. canned low sodium black beans, rinsed\n\n1/2 tsp Italian seasoning\n\na pinch of saffron threads\n\n3/4 c. milk w. 2.5 tbs. flour\n\n1/4 tsp ancho chili powder\n\nsalt and pepper to taste\n\nRemove sausage from casing start to brown in a pan, add in onions and garlic cook about 5 minutes until onions start to turn translucent. Add in can of tomatoes plus a little water (I added a bit of water from the pasta that I was cooking on the next burner which helps to thicken a bit), all seasonings, and black beans. Allow mixture to simmer for 10 minutes. Mix flour in milk and add to sauce. Allow to simmer (not boil) until desired thickness. Serve sauce over warm pasta like whole wheat pene. I used some crazy pasta shape I picked up somewhere.\n\nI added the milk/flour mixture by stirring some of the warm sauce into the milk to warm the milk up a bit first. I don’t know if other people do that or not. I just have a hard time adding milk to my sauces a lot…they always break or curdle on me and I don’t know why! I have made many a mediocre (or bad) dish because I killed the sauce at the end!!"
