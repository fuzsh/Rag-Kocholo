        "text": "These giant meatballs are extra tender, packed with rich flavor, and coated in a vibrant, silky smooth tomato sauce. Swirl al-dente spaghetti in the sauce and top it with a giant meatball: a fabulous dinner is served.\n\nJumbo spaghetti and meatballs is a stunning and delicious meal to make when you crave a dinner that’s equal parts nostalgic and modern.\n\nWe use the classic blend of beef, pork, and veal, along with a hearty shower of parmesan, fresh breadcrumbs, and the best homemade tomato sauce (hello, Marcella Hazan!) to craft a perfect dinner.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with average-sized meatballs, but a giant meatball is a statement piece that will always be remembered.\n\nWhy giant meatballs?\n\nThe more kids we have, the less I like meatballs. That’s not entirely fair-- the more kids we have, the less I like making meatballs. The scooping, the shaping, the frying, the scrubbing. It all takes a lot of time. And it’s hard to hold an angry toddler when my hands are covered in ground pork.\n\nLet’s just say motherhood has given me a whole new attitude about meatloaf.\n\nIn the depths of a meatball struggle, I got thinking about Pinterest fails. How we aspire to make the super tiny, cute, intricate things we see on Pinterest, and wind up with something clobbered together and NOT cute (but usually, hopefully, tasty).\n\nCould I apply that Pinterest-fail dogma here? Intentionally cut out the tedious stuff, but retain the essence we ultimately want: a great taste?\n\nEnter the jumbo meatball.\n\nRolling and frying 6 balls is way more doable than 36, and a total statement piece on a twirly pile of spaghetti. It feels like cheating, but it just happens to work and, as it turns out, looks very à la mode.\n\ngiant meatball ingredients:\n\nlean ground beef\n\nground pork\n\nground veal\n\neggs\n\ngarlic\n\nfresh parsley\n\nparmesan\n\nwhole milk\n\nfresh breadcrumbs\n\nhow to make this giant meatball recipe:\n\nCombine eggs, milk, breadcrumbs, garlic, parsley, salt and pepper.\n\nMix in meat and chill.\n\nShape into 6 giant meatballs.\n\nFry all sides to form a golden-brown crust.\n\nSimmer in tomato sauce until cooked through.\n\nServe with spaghetti and extra parmesan!\n\nhow to get a perfectly round meatball:\n\nMake sure the meat is well chilled.\n\nThe fat in the ground meat warms to room temperature quickly and will soften the shape of the ball. I prefer to chill the meatball mixture for about 30 minutes before shaping and then re-chill the meatballs while I clean and prep for frying.\n\nWet your hands.\n\nIf the meat is sticking to your hands, lightly wet them when you roll to help create a smooth shape.\n\nKeep rolling.\n\nRoll and roll and roll until the shape is round. The warmth of your hands will soften the fat and help create a smooth surface, but too much warmth and the ball will get soft and not hold its shape. If it gets soft, pop it in the fridge for 5- 10 minutes and re-roll until you get a nice sphere.\n\nBabysit the frying.\n\nStand at the stove and turn the meatballs every few minutes, slowly building the round ball shape as you sear the edges. You can’t rush this step. Take the time to rotate the meatballs, build the flavor, and shape the ball. You're done when the meatballs are evenly browned, crisp, and round.\n\nwhy fry jumbo meatballs? Can I bake them?\n\nThe biggest reason to put up with the messiness of frying meatballs is flavor.\n\nSearing the edges builds a flavorful crust (think about a gorgeous seared steak versus a baked steak...would you ever bake a steak?). That flavor is KEY to a really good, classic meatball.\n\nPan frying also adds a crispy texture that is a great contrast to the tender meatball. It sears the juices inside, keeping the meatball juicy rather than dry.\n\nFinally, searing all the sides helps keep the meatball intact so it doesn't fall apart in the sauce.\n\nFor the absolute best meatball, fry it and then simmer in the sauce.\n\nTo bake these giant meatballs:\n\nIf you don't want to deal with the mess of frying or don't want to take the time to fry them, baking is absolutely an option. Here's how to bake the jumbo meatballs:\n\nLine a baking sheet with foil and lightly grease the foil.\n\nArrange the meatballs prepared sheet and baked 425°F for 20- 25 minutes, or until cooked through (160°F on instant-read thermometer).\n\nToss in sauce and serve.\n\nmake ahead options:\n\nFrom-scratch spaghetti and meatballs can be a process, and sometimes it's easier to break up the recipe so it doesn't feel so time consuming.\n\nHere are my favorite stopping places in the recipe:\n\nMake meatball mixture and chill up to 24 hours ahead of cooking.\n\nShape meatballs and chill, covered, up to 24 hours ahead of cooking. Unbaked meatballs can be frozen for up to 1 month.\n\nShape, fry, and cook meatballs in sauce. Store in fridge for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months (defrost in fridge overnight).\n\nmore giant meatball recipe tips:\n\nIf you prefer to avoid veal, you can use any ratio of meat you’d like. Half beef and half pork works great.\n\nI use lean ground beef (90/10) when making meatballs with ground pork and veal, both of which have enough fat for tenderness and flavor. If you’re making all-beef meatballs, look for 70/30 ground beef.\n\nGet your meat at a butcher! Homemade spaghetti and meatballs are a labor of love-- don’t waste your time and energy with subpar meat. Search out high quality meat and you can’t go wrong.\n\nFrying meatballs is messy, and with these large meatballs it's tricky to fit a splatter screen over the top of the pan. I prefer to hold the splatter screen between me and the skillet, to protect me from the splatters and contain the grease to the stove.\n\nThis recipe doubles great! You can also use this recipe for ANY size meatballs you like.\n\nDon’t skip the glass of Sangiovese as a reward for that messy frying!\n\nmore pasta recipes to try:\n\nmorel pasta with cream, parmesan and thyme\n\ncreamy lemon chicken pappardelle\n\nhomemade spaghettiOs\n\nPrint\n\nspaghetti with giant meatballs\n\n5 Stars 4 Stars 3 Stars 2 Stars 1 Star\n\n5 from 1 review\n\nThese giant meatballs are extra tender, packed with rich flavor, and coated in a vibrant, silky smooth tomato sauce.

Bring to a boil and reduce to a gentle simmer. Cook until thickened and flavorful, about 45 minutes. As the sauce cooks, use a wooden spoon to gently smash open the tomatoes and break them down.\n\nRemove from heat. Taste and add more salt or pepper if needed; discard onion. Use an immersion blender to blend the sauce smooth.\n\nGiant meatballs\n\nIn a medium bowl, stir together eggs, milk, breadcrumbs, garlic, parsley, salt and pepper. Let sit 5 minutes to soften.\n\nAdd beef, pork, veal, and parmesan and gently mix until just combined (don’t overmix). Chill at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour.\n\nDivide mixture into 6 large meatballs (about 6 oz each). Roll into smooth balls, wetting your hands if needed.\n\nHeat ¼-inch olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmery, but not smoking. Fry meatballs in batches, cooking and turning every few minutes until all of the sides are golden brown and crisp. Drain on paper towels.\n\nTransfer meatballs to sauce. Bring to a gentle simmer, cover, and cook until meatballs are cooked through, about 20 minutes, turning once or twice. Transfer meatballs to a large plate.\n\nCook spaghetti in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente. Drain and toss with some of the leftover tomato sauce.\n\nDivide pasta among 6 plates and top each with a giant meatball. Spoon extra sauce on top and serve, passing grated Parmesan.\n\nNotes\n\nNutritional information is only an estimate.
