        "text": "This Chicken a la King recipe is made from scratch with a creamy mushroom sauce, peas, pimentos, and juicy chicken. Serve this with rice, egg noodles, biscuits, or pastry!\n\nChicken a la King\n\nWhen you need some cozy comfort food vibes, this Chicken a la King is where it’s at! This recipe features a classic, creamy mushroom sauce with juicy bites of chicken, peas and those signature pimentos! This is a fantastic recipe to serve with rice, egg noodles, biscuits, or over puff pastry!\n\nMy version is made easily from scratch with no canned soup. It has a little bit of a “brothy” vibe to it, while still being thick enough to hold it’s own as a sauce. I absolutely love serving this over my buttermilk biscuits. It’s cozy cooking heaven!\n\nBe sure to check out my pro tips below!\n\nHow to Make It\n\nSee recipe card below this post for ingredient quantities and full instructions.\n\nSeason the chicken with salt and pepper and sear in olive oil for 3 minutes/side. Let rest, then dice and set aside. It will finish cooking in the sauce, which will add even more homecooked flavor to the dish.\n\nDeglaze the pot with wine, then add the mushrooms, onions, and garlic. Soften for 5-6 minutes.\n\nAdd the butter/flour to make a roux and cook for 2 minutes. Add the sauce mixture (half and half, chicken broth, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and seasonings) in small splashes. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Add the chicken back and simmer for 10 minutes.\n\nAdd the peas and pimentos and simmer for 5-10 more minutes, or until desired thickness is obtained. Serve over egg noodles, rice, puff pastry, or biscuits.\n\nPro Tips\n\nWine: I like to use Pinot Grigio, Chardonnay, and Cabernet Blanc in this recipe, but Sherry is a traditional wine choice for this recipe as well. Chicken broth can be used if you don’t cook with wine.\n\nChicken: 4 cups of leftover/rotisserie chicken can be used if needed. It won’t be quite as flavorful as making this with fresh chicken.\n\nPimentos: Pimentos are a classic staple in this dish, but finely diced bell peppers (red or green), can be used instead!\n\nServing Options: This is great over my Buttered Noodles, Buttermilk Biscuits, or Cheddar Bay Biscuits!\n\nStorage\n\nStore in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months.\n\nCream-based sauces don’t reheat as well the second time around, but that doesn’t stop me!\n\nTools For This Recipe\n\n(Amazon affiliate links)- Check out all of my kitchen essentials here.\n\n4.5 Quart Dutch Oven– The perfect size for almost any soup recipe.\n\nBetter Than Bouillon– This is what I always use for broth in my recipes. It takes very little space and makes it easy to measure out customized amounts of broth.\n\nMeasuring Spoons– I have these magnetic ones which stay nice and organized in my utensil drawer.\n\nTry These Next\n\nGet My Free E-Book!\n\nI’ve got a FREE e-Book with 7 super popular dinner recipes!

Serve this with rice, egg noodles, biscuits, or pastry!\n\nIngredients\n\nSauce\n\n▢ 1 tablespoon olive oil\n\n▢ 1 ¼ lbs. boneless skinless chicken breast, see notes\n\n▢ salt/pepper, to taste\n\n▢ ½ cup dry white wine, see notes\n\n▢ 5 tablespoons butter\n\n▢ 8 oz. baby bella mushrooms, can sub white button\n\n▢ 1 small yellow onion, diced\n\n▢ 3 cloves garlic, minced\n\n▢ 1/3 cup flour\n\n▢ 3 cups half and half\n\n▢ 1 cup chicken broth\n\n▢ 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce\n\n▢ 1 teaspoon hot sauce, I use Franks hot sauce\n\n▢ 1 chicken bouillon cube\n\n▢ ¾ cup peas, I use frozen\n\n▢ 4 oz. drained pimentos\n\nSeasonings\n\n▢ ½ teaspoon EACH: dried basil, parsley, thyme, onion powder, mustard powder\n\n▢ ¼ teaspoon ground sage\n\n▢ 1/8 teaspoon pepper, paprika\n\nCook ModePrevent your screen from going dark\n\nInstructions\n\nPrep Work\n\nIn a large measuring cup with a spout, combine the half and half, chicken broth, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and seasonings and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients before beginning.\n\nCook the Chicken\n\nPat the chicken dry and season each side with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a 4 ½-quart soup pot over medium-high heat.\n\nAdd the chicken and cook for 3 minutes per side, until a brown crust has developed. Remove from heat. The middle will still be uncooked.\n\nLet the chicken rest for 10 minutes, then cut into bite-sized pieces. The chicken will finish cooking in the sauce, which will also add even more homecooked flavor to it.\n\nMake the Sauce\n\nAdd the wine and set the heat to medium. Use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the mushrooms, onions, and garlic. Cook for 5-6 minutes, until softened.\n\nAdd the butter and flour and stir to combine. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring continuously.\n\nReduce heat to medium-low. Add the half and half mixture (from step 1) in small splashes, stirring continuously. Scrape up any remnants from the bottom of the pot as you do so. Add the chicken bouillon.\n\nSet heat to medium-high and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Add the chicken back and simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes.\n\nAdd the peas and pimentos. Simmer uncovered for 5-10 more minutes, or until desired consistency is obtained. The longer it simmers, the thicker it will become.\n\nRemove from heat and serve over egg noodles, pasta, rice, biscuits, or pastry.\n\nNotes\n\nPro Tips:\n\nWine: I like to use Pinot Grigio, Chardonnay, and Cabernet Blanc in this recipe, but Sherry is a traditional wine choice for this recipe as well. Chicken broth can be used if you don't cook with wine.\n\nChicken: 4 cups of leftover/rotisserie chicken can be added in step 4 of \"make the chicken\" if needed. It won't be quite as flavorful as making this with fresh chicken.\n\nPimentos: Pimentos are a classic staple in this dish, but finely diced bell peppers (red or green), can be used instead!\n\nServing Options: This is great over my Buttered Noodles, Buttermilk Biscuits, or Cheddar Bay Biscuits!\n\nStorage:\n\nStore in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months.\n\nCream-based sauces don't reheat as well the second time around, but that doesn't stop me!\n\nNutritional information is an estimate and is per serving.
