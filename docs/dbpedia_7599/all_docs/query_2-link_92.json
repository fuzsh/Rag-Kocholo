Read my disclosure policy.\n\nQuick Summary\n\nLemon Spaghetti with Garlic Toasted Breadcrumbs is the perfect pasta dish and only takes 20 minutes to make! The lemon sauce is light, refreshing, and so delicious! Top the spaghetti with garlic toasted breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, and fresh basil for a simple, but gourmet meal!\n\nPin this now to find it later\n\nPin It\n\nYou know a recipe is good when you tell your family how amazing it is after every single bite, ha! That is what happens when I make Lemon Spaghetti with Garlic Toasted Breadcrumbs.\n\nAnd I don’t do this because I am looking for compliments, I just can’t help myself because it is SO good. Luckily, everyone agrees with me and expresses their love for the pasta too. Lemon spaghetti is a family favorite!\n\nThe light lemon sauce is bursting with lemon flavor. It is so refreshing and so good with a healthy amount of salty Parmesan cheese and sweet basil.\n\nTo take the lemon spaghetti to the next level, I make garlic toasted breadcrumbs to sprinkle on top. Don’t skip them because they are INCREDIBLE!! They add a nice garlicky, salty, crunch. Plus, carbs on carbs? Always a good idea.\n\nPromise me you will try my lemon spaghetti recipe. It is restaurant quality but EASY to make at home!\n\nPasta Ingredients\n\nYou are a few ingredients way from the BEST dinner ever!\n\nSpaghetti– we use classic spaghetti but any pasta will work. You can even use gluten-free pasta if you need the dish to be gluten-free.\n\nOlive oil– for the lemon sauce.\n\nLemon– you need lemon zest and fresh lemon juice.\n\nParmesan cheese– buy a wedge of good Parmesan cheese and freshly grate it for this dish. There are only a few ingredients so using quality ingredients is important.\n\nButter– to add a rich flavor to the pasta.\n\nGarnish– crushed red pepper flakes, fresh basil, and extra Parmesan cheese.\n\nI top the lemon spaghetti with toasted garlic breadcrumbs and they take the pasta dish to the next level. Don’t skip the breadcrumbs!\n\nOlive oil– to get the bread nice and crispy!!\n\nCiabatta bread– tear the bread into small pieces, you want a rustic look. You can also use French bread or sourdough bread.\n\nGarlic– use fresh garlic cloves and mince with a sharp knife or use a garlic press.\n\nSalt– always!\n\nTo make the breadcrumbs: in a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the bread pieces and cook, stirring occasionally, until bread is golden brown and toasted. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Season with salt, to taste.\n\nThe toasted breadcrumbs are SO good. I sometimes have to make more because I end up snacking on them while I cook. Oops!!\n\nHow to Make Lemon Spaghetti\n\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti until al dente, according to package instructions. Reserve 1 cup of the starchy pasta water and drain the pasta. Pour the pasta back into the pot.\n\nWhile the pasta is cooking, whisk together the olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, and Parmesan cheese in a small bowl.\n\nPour the lemon sauce over the cooked spaghetti. Add the butter and toss until well combined, the butter will melt over the warm pasta. Add ¼ cup of the reserved pasta water and toss again. If you think the pasta needs a little more liquid, you can add a little more of the water.\n\nSeason with crushed red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper, to taste. Divide the pasta among bowls and garnish with fresh basil, extra Parmesan cheese, and the toasted breadcrumbs. Serve immediately.\n\nServing Suggestions\n\nServe any of the following dishes along side the spaghetti for an amazing meal!\n\nSimple Arugula Salad\n\nSimple Kale Salad\n\nEasy Green Salad\n\nRoasted Green Beans\n\nRoasted Broccoli\n\nRoasted Asparagus\n\nGarlic Bread\n\nStoring Tips\n\nTo be honest, we usually don’t have leftovers when we make this one because everyone loves it! But if you do, store the leftover spaghetti in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.\n\nStore the toasted breadcrumbs in an airtight container on the counter for up to 1 week.\n\nMore Pasta Recipes\n\nCacio e Pepe\n\n5-Ingredient Spinach Parmesan Pasta\n\nPasta Pomodoro\n\nSpaghetti and Meatballs\n\nBaked Ziti\n\nPasta Primavera\n\nBaked Spaghetti\n\nPasta\n\nThis is the perfect pasta dish and only takes 20 minutes to make!
