        "text": "Cinema as an art is constantly innovating and over-toppling its own pinnacle of achieved glory. In a century or so since its inception, the age of First Cinema (character and situation oriented) and Second (comparative perspective from an objective viewpoint) have become passé with the arrival of Third Cinema (a term coined by Michael Wayne in his book Political Cinema: The Dialectics of Third Cinema) a genre which has a strong literary and cultural grounding but takes one step further by bringing to the art of cinema-the range, depth and concerns of contemporary politics; a conscious political interlinkage between creator and spectator; clear portrayal of subaltern concerns and cultural specificities. Side stepping the avowed objectives of recreation and supreme creation, Third Cinema seeks to help the spectator build clear political ideologies and loyalties, an imperative in a multi perspective, deceptive, constantly fluctuating political environment. I shall undertake the study of select Third cinema specimen from Bollywood movies and attempt to align them with the prevalent thought and ideology of the day to eke out generalities, predict movements and showcase successful outcomes.\n\nThe question of politics in Italian cinema continues to exercise critics and scholars to a remarkable degree. This is demonstrated by several contemporary research initiatives, and by the continued deployment of the concept of political or social commitment (impegno) as a live and value term in the writing of Italian cinema history. Contributors to this roundtable were invited to interrogate critical assumptions about political value in Italian cinema, and to consider the various ways in which a film or genre can deal with politics or be deemed ‘political’. The roundtable is grouped roughly into three sections: the first deals with cinema and politics from a variety of historical and theoretical perspectives; the second deals with different genres and modes; the third deals with individual filmmakers and their films. In this introduction I do not try to summarize the articles, which should be read on their own terms, but limit myself to gesturing at certain themes that seemed to me to emerge as important across the sections.\n\nThis article examines the term ‘World Cinema’ by comparing it to ‘world literature’, as understood by two German thinkers of the Romantic period: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Karl Marx, who attributed universal appeal to it. It argues that World cinema, like world literature, testifies to the unequal distribution of economic and cultural power. World Cinema refers to cinemas of peripheries, cinematic production of ‘developing’ or Third World countries or non-Hollywood. Moreover, it does not encompass everything which is produced in the peripheries, but only that part, which lends itself to the gaze of (broadly understood) western scholars. Inevitably, such gaze privileges ‘canonical works’, which have already received national recognition and which due to their subjects, forms or ideologies, align themselves with the production in the centre. However, there are also films created in the peripheries which transcended national boundaries despite being openly local and even hostile t...\n\nFor the past four decades or so, studies of Third Cinema have been restricted to the domain of niche, Third World films and non-mainstream cinematic movements. This work set out to examine the relevance of Third Cinema theory and practice in the contemporary times and secondly, to argue for the urgent need of anti-systemic and anti-capitalist platforms of film analysis and discussion. The thesis proposes an updated approach to the old theory of Third Cinema and it makes use of the case study design where Embrace of the Serpent by Ciro Guerra is analysed in-depth to explore the potential of the New Third Cinema as a resistance tool to the oppressive neoliberal policies. Looking at different themes, techniques and textual as well as visual content in the movie from a Third Cinema perspective, this research brings to light the power of cinema in highlighting and speaking about significant issues pertaining to neo-colonialism, racism, capitalism and even ecology. The utilisation of Third Cinema theory in this work can also contribute to its re-emergence from the academic oblivion and enhance further research and debate in this area of Film Studies."
