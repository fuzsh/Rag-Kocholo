        "text": "Pasta al limone is more than the sum of its parts. The Italian lemon sauce is luscious and amply cheesy but bright thanks to fresh citrus. Like in cacio e pepe and fettuccine Alfredo, the key to this weeknight pasta dinner is not an abundance of ingredients (there are only five) or a long slow simmer (it takes just 15 minutes start to finish). Instead, this classic lemon pasta recipe relies on the power of emulsion—and on your patience.\n\nFirst, you’ll infuse the cream with lemon flavor using the zest, then whisk in cold butter, one tablespoon at a time, until each addition is fully incorporated. You’ll follow suit with the Parmesan cheese: Allow each handful to become one with the creamy lemon pasta sauce before adding the next. Plop in the cheese all at once and you’re likely to end up with a glob that refuses to play nicely with the tangle of spaghetti (or linguine if preferred). A pour of starchy pasta water gives the sauce body, but remember that you’ll add fresh lemon juice (which will loosen the sauce further) to the pot after it comes off the heat. Adding it too soon can cause the sauce to break and curdle, not to mention dull the lemon’s acidity. If you need more guidance, check out this video."
