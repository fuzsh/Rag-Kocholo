        "text": "Set in Miami, 1980, three gangsters are discussing various criminal activities when a goddess, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, enters the conversation. The divine apparition is Elvira Hancock, played by the very young Michelle Pfeiffer. The blond bombshell attracts the attention of all three men, and Tony Montana - like the viewer - only has eyes for her. Draped in a blue silk dress, Michelle Pfeiffer reveals a slender figure underneath an outfit that leaves no one indifferent. Part of the reason the character stood out in Brian de Palma's film was because of her Patricia Norris style. With a plunging neckline, an open back, and a dizzying slit from the top of the thigh to the ankle, Elvira Hancock's dress has become a movie icon on its own.\n\nA multi-faceted ensemble\n\nLooking at Michelle Pfeiffer's blue silk dress in Scarface, the neophyte would only see an outfit intended to amaze men and fill women with envy. But Patricia Norris had more in mind when she constructed this legendary dress, complete with a rhinestone -embroidered neckline. The fabric used by the costume designer says a lot about Elvira Hancock's character. Firstly, Brian de Palma's Scarface was a remake of Howard Hawk's film released in 1932, it was natural to include some nods. Rather than a garment with frills and colorful prints as was often done in the 1980s, Patricia Norris opted for an outfit inspired by the Hollywood glamor of the 1930s. The slit on the thigh, the V-shaped neckline, and the shimmering material of Elvira Hancock's dress are all reminiscent of Jean Harlow's outfits in William A. Wellman's The Public Enemy. The minimalism of the dress in no way detracts from Elvira's fatal charm, which seems to be explicitly floating in her silk drapery. On the contrary, for Patricia Norris, less is more. Michelle Pfeiffer's simple yet sultry dress contrasts with Tony Montana's flashy outfits. The two characters are not from the same class and it shows in their sense of style. Surrounded by money, Elvira Hancock dresses in luxury but could go unnoticed alongside the extravagant trends of the era. What makes her unforgettable is the charm and allure of the actress who embodies her. Patricia Norris will maintain this silhouette throughout the film, giving the actress a wardrobe full of plunging necklines, sultry outfits, made in silky materials. She also added an iconic blonde haircut- complete with almost childish maxi bangs. Ironically, her hairstyle offsets the character's explosive sensuality.\n\nA timeless dress\n\nLike Julia Roberts' looks in Pretty Woman or Keira Knightley's emerald dress in Atonement, Michelle Pfeiffer's blue silk slip dress continues to inspire, even thirty-seven years after the release of Scarface. Patricia Norris truly created a timeless outfit. There is no doubt that the pique dress of the 1930s will still be in vogue in fifty years. In fact, many designers have taken inspiration from it, and celebrities have adopted this silhouette on the red carpet. During London Fashion Week 2012, Rihanna donned a bespoke Armani dress, modeled after Patricia Norris' creation. It is also impossible to forget the divine appearance of Bella Hadid on the steps of the Palais des Festivals in Cannes in 2016. The model wore a flamboyant red Alexandre Vauthier Couture dress with the complete package: plunging neckline, spaghetti straps, open back, and vertiginous slit. Fashion took hold of this legendary dress, but so did pop culture. Much like Mia’s outfit in Pulp Fiction, for Halloween, Elvira’s look is imitated by many it-girls like Kaia Gerber."
