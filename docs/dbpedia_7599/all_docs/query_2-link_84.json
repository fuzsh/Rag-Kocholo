        "text": "By Jenn Segal\n\nThis post may contain affiliate links. Read my full disclosure policy.\n\nShrimp scampi with pasta — fast, flavorful, and irresistibly garlicky. The perfect weeknight dinner for seafood lovers.\n\nSucculent shrimp bathed in a garlicky, white wine and lemon-infused butter sauce—shrimp scampi makes an excellent sauce for pasta. However, in many recipes, the pasta is more of an afterthought, left in need of more flavor and sauce. In this version, both the pasta and the shrimp share the spotlight equally. While you could certainly use any long pasta, my preference is for angel hair or capellini. The thin, delicate strands have a knack for soaking up the garlicky sauce, packing maximum flavor into every bite.\n\nMaking shrimp scampi with pasta is fairly simple, but it’s important to watch the shrimp’s cooking time. If you cook them for too long, they can become rubbery. The trick is to take the shrimp off the heat as soon as they turn opaque and pink. Pair shrimp scampi with an arugula salad and dinner is served!\n\n“Have made this delicious recipe a couple of times and am now training my hubby how to make it! We both love it!”\n\nCat\n\nWhat You’ll Need To Make Shrimp Scampi with Pasta\n\nAngel hair, spaghetti, linguine, or fettuccini: While any long pasta will work, angel hair or capellini is ideal for soaking up the sauce. You’ll need to reserve some pasta water before draining, as the starchy, salty water serves as an excellent thickener for the sauce. To remember to save this water, place a measuring cup in your colander as a visual reminder.\n\nExtra-virgin olive oil: Used to sauté shallots, garlic, and shrimp, adding flavor and preventing sticking.\n\nShallots and garlic: These aromatics form the fundamental flavor base for shrimp scampi. The recipe calls for six cloves of garlic, so if your garlic press has been gathering dust, now’s the time to break it out and put it to work!\n\nRed pepper flakes: Offer a hint of heat. Feel free to adjust to taste.\n\nExtra-large shrimp: The star of the dish. Unless you live near the coast, using thawed frozen shrimp is ideal as they are flash-frozen at peak freshness, and they can be quickly defrosted before cooking.\n\nDry white wine: Adds depth and acidity to the sauce. When cooking with wine, always select an inexpensive bottle that’s still good enough to drink. Avoid “cooking wines” due to their salt and additives.\n\nButter: Brings richness and flavor, creating a silky sauce texture.\n\nLemon juice and zest: Add brightness and tanginess, balancing the buttery sauce.\n\nFresh parsley: Provides a fresh, herby finish and looks pretty, too.\n\nJump to the printable recipe for precise measurements\n\nStep-by-Step Instructions\n\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook to al dente according to the package instructions.\n\nReserve 1 cup of the cooking water, then drain.\n\nMeanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring frequently, for about 1 minute.\n\nStir in the garlic, red pepper flakes, and ¼ teaspoon each salt and pepper.\n\nAdd the shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are pink and just cooked through, about 3 minutes.\n\nTransfer the shrimp to a plate.\n\nAdd the wine to the skillet and simmer until reduced by half, 3 to 4 minutes.\n\nAdd the butter, lemon juice, and lemon zest, ½ cup of the reserved cooking water, and ½ teaspoon salt. Stir until the butter is melted.\n\nAdd the drained pasta and continue to cook, tossing, until the pasta is warmed through, adding more of the reserved cooking water as needed if the pasta seems dry. Return the shrimp and any juices from the plate to the skillet and toss with the pasta.\n\nStir in the parsley, then taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary. Serve with lemon wedges.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan I make shrimp scampi without wine?\n\nYes, you can make shrimp scampi without wine. As an alternative, you can use chicken or vegetable broth with a squeeze of lemon, or just leave it out.\n\nCan I use pre-cooked shrimp for shrimp scampi?\n\nNo, pre-cooked shrimp will not work for making shrimp scampi. They have already been cooked and will become tough and overcooked when heated again, which can ruin the texture and flavor of your dish. Use fresh or thawed frozen raw shrimp for best results.\n\nHow can I prevent shrimp from becoming rubbery?\n\nTo avoid rubbery shrimp, be careful not to overcook them. In this recipe, they take only a few minutes to cook. It important to take them off the heat as soon as they turn pink and opaque to prevent further cooking.\n\nVideo Tutorial\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nShrimp Scampi with Pasta\n\nShrimp scampi with pasta — fast, flavorful, and irresistibly garlicky.
