        "text": "A PHOTOGRAPHER who has dined at 1,000 McDonald's across six continents has revealed the one unusual dish he couldn't finish.\n\nGary He, a food journalist from Brooklyn, New York has documented his journey to McDonald's restaurants in 50 countries.\n\nGary's new book, McAtlas, is his love letter to the popular American fast food chain that has become a mainstay around the world.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to The Sun, Gary said he had often gone to McDonald’s to try the local menu items overseas because he thought it was quirky and fun.\n\nHe said: \"It became interesting and academic while I was on a trip to Morocco a few years ago during Ramadan.\n\n\"I encountered a McDonald’s meal which is what Muslims eat to break the daily fast during the holy month.\n\n\"When I tried to research it, nothing came up, and the gears started turning in my head... that there was an opportunity to tell this story about the largest restaurant chain in the world.\"\n\nWhile the majority of bulk of the photography and field work happened over the past three years, Gary said he's been working on the project as far back as 2018.\n\n\"After years of research and field work, it’s going to be a book, releasing in November,\" he said.\n\nWith hundreds of Maccies under his belt, Gary said there was one item on the menu that he would never eat again.\n\nHe said: \"The Australian McDonald’s - or Maccas, as the locals refer to it - had a version of the potato scallop (deep fried battered potato slices) that is available at fish and chip shops around the country.\n\n\"It got all sorts of bad press, and I happened to be in the country so was able to order one.\n\n\"I couldn’t even finish it.\"\n\nBut after his travels, there were several dishes Gary hoped he get his hands in America.\n\nHe said: \"In South Korea they have the Egg Bulgogi Burger, which is a marinated pork patty slathered in that famous South Korean glaze, topped with an egg and lettuce.\n\n\"It’s definitely on the Mount Rushmore of McDonald’s menu items, alongside the Corn Pie a la mode in Thailand.\n\n\"I wish that I didn’t have to fly thousands of miles to have one. \"\n\nBut the most memorable meal was in the Philippines.\n\nHe said: \"I thought the McSpaghetti was really special, because it’s not what you expect.\n\n\"In the Philippines, they have this sweet marinara pasta that’s the result of local chefs re-creating spaghetti bolognese using what ingredients were available - a tomato shortage meant that the marinara was made with sweet banana ketchup, and chopped up hot dogs for the protein - but over time that became a flavour profile that every local was familiar with.\n\n\"It’s insanely popular at kids birthday parties thanks to the local chain, Jollibee.\n\n\"So McDonald’s just had to sell their own version of it in order to survive in that market.\"\n\nThe Maccies connoisseur said that while the localised menu items provided the most visually stark differences, it was the difference in locations and spaces that stood out.\n\nHe said: \"When McDonald’s first started opening stores in Europe, they tried to use the US strategy of opening in the suburbs.\n\n\"Our city centres had deteriorated to the point that they were the last places where you would set up a family restaurant.\n\n\"But that backfired, because in the Netherlands, for example, the major cities were still the beating heart of retail.\n\n\"Around the world, you can observe locals using the stores differently—in places like Tokyo and Hong Kong, the stores are like after school centers, full of kids doing homework.\n\n\"People go on dates at McDonald’s.\n\n\"Meanwhile, most of the action in the US is in drive-thru and delivery.\"\n\nAnd while Maccies restaurant can be found in almost every corner of the globe, the quirkiest restaurant Gary ate in was in New Zealand.\n\nHe said: \"The quirkiest award has to go to the McDonald’s airplane in Taupo, New Zealand.\n\n\"It was an advertising fixture for the car dealership that used to occupy the location, and after the franchisees took over the lot, they just painted the Golden Arches onto it and made it overflow seating.\"\n\nWhile in Sweden, Gary used a \"ski-thru\" window at a popular Maccies restaurant in Lindvallen.\n\nWith years of travelling and sampling the different McDonald's around the world, Gary said the expansion to overseas countries made the franchise better.\n\nHe said: \"It exposed the brand to a lot of the protests that it faced in the late 90s and early 2000s, especially in France.\n\n\"At the time, it was a company in turmoil, its dominance and survival was not a sure thing.\n\n\"And so how they responded to that, by focusing on localising, and improving the product, and by refocusing itself on the franchisee model, turned the restaurant into what it is today.\n\n\"The restaurant is not a monolith controlled by the headquarters in Chicago - it’s a network of fairly independent operators around the world.\n\n\"And that network learns from one another and improves the entire operation in the process. \""
