If you’ve been to Lil’ Frankie’s in NYC’s East Village Dinner — Lil’ Frankie’s (lilfrankies.com), you’ve probably tried their iconic Spaghetti Limone. This recipe is by Frank Prisinzano and after making it, you will quickly understand how it came to be such a famous dish. This pasta is on repeat at my home—it’s easy, 💨 quick, and uses just a few basic ingredients that you probably already have on hand. This recipe has always reminded me of the OG Italian “Alfredo” or “pasta al burro” which simply consists of butter, Parmigiano, and pasta water. The addition of 🍋 lemons in this dish makes me feel as if I am sitting on the coast of Positano with a glass of wine in hand.\n\nWhy You’ll Love Pasta Limone\n\nThis delicious Pasta Limone recipe uses only a handful of ingredients but the results are so flavorful. The secret to this luscious sauce is actually using a couple of ladles of pasta💧water — the liquid gold that binds everything together and makes the dish so creamy, without any cream. You’ll also love how speedy this dish takes, simply 15 minutes from start to finish! The finished dish is so bright and 🍋 lemony, and the freshly grated parm just takes it over the top.\n\nHow to Prepare Pasta Limone\n\n💧 Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat.\n\n🧂 Then generously salt the water.\n\n⏲️ Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente (about 10 minutes).\n\n🥣 Using tongs, transfer the cooked spaghetti to a clean pot.\n\n🧈 Add the cubed butter and then add a small ladle or two of the pasta-cooking water.\n\n🍋 Add the lemon juice (removing any pits, as necessary).\n\n🌀 Using tongs or a wooden spoon, stir the pasta in a circular motion until the butter has melted and you are left with a beautiful butter-lemon sauce at the bottom of the pot.\n\n🧀Plate the pasta and then garnish with lots of freshly finely grated parmesan cheese and enjoy!\n\nNonna’s Tip 🧂\n\nThe pasta water should be as salty as the sea, as this is your only chance to flavor the pasta.\n\nVariations and Substitutions for Pasta Limone\n\nFeel free to add a protein to this Pasta Limone. Chicken, or shrimp would be perfection!\n\nYou could also add in some fresh 🧄 garlic to this. Simply sauté sliced or minced garlic in the pot, before adding in the cooked pasta.\n\nFor even more bright flavors, garnish with chopped 🌿 parsley as well.\n\nBump up the cheesiness and add in some additional grated parmesan cheese when you add the pasta water.\n\nYou can certainly use your favorite gluten-free pasta to make this recipe. I haven’t tried it personally, so please adjust the cooking time according to the package directions.\n\nTo make this recipe dairy-free, use a non-dairy 🧈 butter substitute and either omit the cheese or use a dairy-free cheese alternative.\n\nSimilar Recipes\n\nBest Served With\n\nServe this Pasta Limone with a big salad, like my Lemon Parmesan Salad or Caesar Salad.\n\nThis pasta dish is great with garlic bread or my Cheesy Garlic Bread Recipe.\n\nMy Pasta Limone would be great as a side dish for simple grilled steak, chicken or shrimp.\n\nCommon Questions\n\nhow much pasta water should I add in?\n\nDon’t use too much of the pasta water or your sauce may be too thin. About 1/3 cup should be enough to bind the sauce together. Always start with less water, and add more as needed.\n\nwhat kind of parmesan cheese do you use in this pasta limone?\n\nPlease buy a fresh block of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and grate it yourself. Avoid anything in a box or anything pre-grated. Authentic Parmigiano Reggiano will be stamped on the rind.\n\ncan I add a protein to this dish?\n\nAbsolutely! Cooked, cubed chicken or steamed shrimp would be delicious in this Pasta Limone recipe.\n\ncan I make this recipe gluten-free?\n\nYes, you can certainly use your favorite gluten-free pasta to make this recipe. I haven’t tried it personally, so please adjust the cooking time according to the package directions.\n\ncan I add other ingredients to this recipe?\n\nYes! You could add in some sauteed diced zucchini, peppers or onions to this as well.\n\ncan I make this recipe dairy-free?\n\nYes, you can use a dairy-free butter substitute and either omit the cheese or use a dairy-free cheese alternative.\n\nPasta Limone\n\nThis recipe uses only lemon juice, salt, butter, and pasta water (the liquid gold that binds everything together). It takes 15 minutes from start to finish, and what's better than a speedy fast meal!\n\n4.82 from 11 votes\n\nCook ModeKeeps your screen on\n\nCourse: Main Course\n\nCuisine: Italian\n\nServings: 3\n\nAuthor: The Modern Nonna\n\nPrep Time: 5 minutes minutes\n\nCook Time: 10 minutes minutes\n\nTotal Time: 15 minutes minutes\n\nIngredients\n\n▢ salt\n\n▢ 350 grams spaghetti , 3/4 pound, or any variety\n\n▢ 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into cubes\n\n▢ 2 lemons, juiced\n\n▢ 3 tablespoons Parmigiano Reggiano , grated (use a high-quality block of Parmigiano), to taste\n\nInstructions\n\nBring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Generously salt the water as this is your only chance to flavor it—the water should be as salty as the sea.\n\nAdd the spaghetti and cook until al dente. This should take about 10 minutes but please cook the pasta to your desired doneness.\n\nUsing tongs, transfer the cooked spaghetti to a clean pot. Add the cubed butter and a small ladle or two of the pasta-cooking water. Add the lemon juice (removing any pits, as necessary).\n\nUsing tongs or a wooden spoon, stir the pasta in a circular motion until the butter has melted and you are left with a beautiful butter-lemon sauce at the bottom of the pot.\n\nTraditionally this pasta is served on oven-safe plates warmed briefly in a low oven. This helps keeps the pasta warm after serving, but this is optional.\n\nOnce the pasta is plated, garnish with lots of freshly finely grated parmesan cheese and enjoy!\n\nVideo\n\nNutrition\n\nCalories: 674kcal, Carbohydrates: 94g, Protein: 18g, Fat: 26g, Saturated Fat: 16g, Polyunsaturated Fat: 2g, Monounsaturated Fat: 6g, Trans Fat: 1g, Cholesterol: 64mg, Sodium: 92mg, Potassium: 371mg, Fiber: 6g, Sugar: 5g, Vitamin A: 755IU, Vitamin C: 38mg, Calcium: 109mg, Iron: 2mg\n\nNutrition information is automatically calculated, so should only be used as an approximation.\n\nLove This Recipe?\n\nShare your pictures or videos of you making my recipes by mentioning #themodernnonna on all socials ❤️\n\nHi! I'm Sneji. Nice to meet you!\n\nI am more commonly known as “The Modern Nonna” on social media where I create easy home cooked meals with a modern twist. I was born and raised in Sofia, Bulgaria and learned how to cook at the best culinary school in the world – my grandma’s kitchen. I lived in Greece on the Island of Crete with my parents for a while and then moved to Toronto, Canada when I was in grade 5. I started to really cook and experiment with food 11 years ago when I was 21 years old. Everything I currently know is a reflection of some part of my life…\n\nKeep up to date with me on social media! Follow @themodernnonna\n\nRelated Posts"
