This is why I‚Äôm going to show you the secret to making this delicious dish.\n\nThis is my go-to spaghetti recipe. When I‚Äôm craving pasta, Spaghetti Aglio E Olio is what I make. Not only is it hearty and comforting, but it is also quick and super easy to make!\n\nSpaghetti Aglio E Olio is a classic Italian pasta dish that is insanely simple to make, but delivers big on flavor. It‚Äôs made with just a few key ingredients: garlic, olive oil, chili flakes, and parsley. And that‚Äôs it!\n\nOh, and it is the perfect pairing with a salad and my Best Garlic Bread Recipe I shared last week.\n\nSpaghetti Aglio E Olio\n\nChef Jean-Pierre\n\nIf you're looking for an easy weeknight dinner that your whole family will love, look no further than this Spaghetti Aglio E Olio recipe. Serve it with a green salad and some garlic bread, and you've got a meal that everyone will enjoy. Trust me, this dish is guaranteed to become a new family favorite!\n\n4.95 from 17 votes\n\nServings 2 Servings\n\nCalories\n\nRecipe Video\n\nRecipe Ingredients\n\n¬Ω pound Spaghettoni, large spaghetti\n\n4 to 5 tablespoons Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\n1 small Red Chili Pepper cut into very small brunoise\n\n2 tablespoons Garlic very finely chopped\n\n2 tablespoons Parsley Leaves chopped, reserve the stems\n\nCook ModePrevent your screen from going dark\n\nRecipe Instructions\n\nIn a shallow dish (like a frying pan) add the pasta and barely cover the pasta. You want the pasta water to have as much starch as possible.\n\nIn a saucepan, heat the olive oil and the parsley stem and add some pasta water. Add the chili pepper, garlic and maybe a little more pasta water. The perfect formula is about 1 time olive oil for two times pasta water. Cook and mix well to create an emulsion.\n\nAdd the cooked pasta and mix vigorously to keep that emulsion with the pasta. You can always add a little more olive oil if you wish. Add the chopped parsley at the last minute.\n\nTraditionally this dish is NOT served with cheese but as long as you do not have Italian at the dinner table, Bon Appetito üòä!!!\n\nPrivate Notes\n\n4.95 from 17 votes ( )"
