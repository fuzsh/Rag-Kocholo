Two types of linguini pasta are tossed with a gorgeous medley of seafood in a heavenly white wine cream sauce! Perfect for date nights, entertaining, or treating yourself on a weeknight in!\n\nAnd friends, here we are today at a crossroads. Our little Noodles & Pasta mini-series is culminating, and it’s time for the final recipe. So obviously, I saved the best for last! 😉\n\nPlease meet my latest obsession, which I SERIOUSLY have not been able to stop making, eating, and singing the praises of this past month – Cream Sauce Seafood Pasta!\n\nYou see, there are things in life that make me happy. Like seeing my family (who I don’t live with anymore), going to the movies with my sister, and chilling out over a pint with a long-time-no-see friend. But then there are things in life that make me extremely happy, lively, and possibly even hyper? Like this Cream Sauce Seafood Pasta. 😁\n\nIt’s luxuriously creamy, rich, super tasty, and elegant. And it’s very much like something you would order at a fancy Italian restaurant. However, contrary to what you might think, it’s actually incredibly easy to make on any given weeknight.\n\nIt shines like a diamond, and it makes my heart do a fluttery dance with its buttery creamy goodness. Friends, this is the cream sauce pasta of dreams, and I want to make ALL your creamy seafood pasta dreams come true with it! 🤗\n\nHERE’S WHAT WE HAVE GOING ON IN THIS CREAM SAUCE SEAFOOD\n\nSlurp-ili-cious linguini. Two kinds actually – regular and squid ink, so you know this is a fancy-schmancy pasta dish. 😉\n\nThe ocean on your plate – we have clams, shrimp, mussels, and squid swimming in the creamy saucy pasta on your plate! 🤤\n\nA luxuriously rich and garlicky white wine cream sauce that tastes heavenly when you toss the seafood and pasta in it! 😋\n\nHerby goodness from fresh Italian parsley in the white wine cream sauce, as well as Herbs De Provence flavoring the seafood. 🌿\n\nTHE STORY….\n\nSo as you know with food, there is usually a story. And with this recipe, it goes back to my Taipei days. As you may recall from my Garlic Cream Sauce Seafood Fettuccine post, I’ve had a long standing love affair with a particular creamy seafood pasta dish that I used to devour at this Italian restaurant called Diamond Tony’s Bistro in Taipei. In fact, I have attempted to recreate their amazing dish on several occasions. But I’ll admit to have never being fully successful before because nobody can do it like Diamond Tony’s.\n\nA few of you from my Taipei days actually messaged to say that you tried the Garlic Cream Sauce Seafood Fettuccine recipe, and that while it’s good and shines in it’s own light, it’s simply just not Tony’s. And you know what? I completely and wholeheartedly agree because, again, nobody can do it exactly like Diamond Tony’s!\n\nAnyways, a few weeks ago, I went on a recipe testing frenzy with the mission of ACTUALLY recreating Tony’s pasta dish.\n\nAnd I am happy and proud to say that after multiple and careful rounds of testing, I managed to create a dish that I love EVEN MORE than Tony’s original beauty! Yes, it’s different and not exactly Tony’s. But it’s currently my ultimate favorite recipe, and one that I will be making for years to come, over and over again!\n\nI am super excited to be sharing this dish with you today, and hope that you’ll love it as much as I do! 🤗\n\nRight, enough talk! Let’s jump in and make some mind-blowingly delicious Cream Sauce Seafood Pasta!\n\nCREAM SAUCE SEAFOOD PASTA INGREDIENTS\n\nAlright! First things first: our shopping list for this Cream Sauce Seafood Pasta! You will need…\n\nSeafood: I went with a combination of mussels, clams, squid, and shrimp. But you can use any type of seafood you like really. Using frozen or fresh seafood is up to you, but frozen works perfectly fine. For this recipe, I use a combination of fresh and frozen seafood: fresh squid from the market, and frozen clams, shrimp, and mussels because I usually have the latter three in my freezer.\n\nLemon Juice: As always, I recommend freshly squeezed.\n\nDry White Wine: Any type of crisp dry white wine such as a sauvignon blanc, pinot grigio, or unoaked chardonnay will work. I highly recommend a sauvignon blanc as it’s brightness and acidity brings out the best flavors in cream sauces and seafood. You’ll need just a splash for the seafood, and a full cup for the cream sauce.\n\nUnsalted Butter: To cook the seafood and also to make the cream sauce.\n\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil: Ok! Important ingredient! Using a high quality extra virgin olive oil is essential to this recipe. So be sure to grab a bottle at the store if you don’t already have it at home. I’m not saying you need to spend a ridiculous amount of $$$$$ on a good bottle of EVOO, but just be sure to pick up a decent bottle at the store. I used an organic extra virgin olive oil from Spain, and used it to cook the seafood and to make the cream sauce.\n\nAromatics: Just some finely minced garlic and onion.\n\nFresh Italian Parsley: Finely minced as well.\n\nAll-purpose flour: This will help to thicken the sauce.\n\nMilk: You’ll need a full three cups! That might seem like a lot, but we’re making an extremely rich and creamy sauce, so the milk is essential (along with the butter and flour) to make a super creamy and dreamy sauce!\n\nSeasonings & Spices: You’ll need Herbs De Provence, kosher salt, and freshly cracked black pepper for the seafood. In addition, you’ll need kosher salt, freshly cracked black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, dried thyme, oregano flakes, ground cayenne, and crushed red chili flakes to flavor the cream sauce. By the way, feel free to omit or adjust the amount of the ground cayenne and crushed red chili flakes to taste.\n\nParmigiano Reggiano Cheese: I highly recommend buying a block of cheese at the store and grating it at home yourself. It will melt better and more evenly in the sauce. Plus it won’t have any of the preservatives the bags of pre-shredded cheese at the store do.\n\nPasta: I went with linguini and used a combination of regular and squid ink linguini. But you can use any type of pasta you like or have on hand.\n\nHOW TO MAKE CREAM SAUCE SEAFOOD PASTA\n\nFirst, let’s get all the prep work out of the way.\n\nMake the Spice Bowl: Combine all the spices and seasonings for the Cream Sauce Seafood Pasta in a small bowl and set aside until needed.\n\nPrepare the seafood: Rinse and chop the squid into ½ inch wide rings/pieces, then remove the skin, rinse again and pat-dry. Soak the clams for 20 minutes in a bowl of water, then rinse them thoroughly if using fresh. Soak and scrub the mussels with a metal brush to rid them of their grit if using fresh. (Note: If your clams and mussels are frozen and the package they came in indicates that they are ready to cook, you can skip soaking, rinsing and scrubbing them.) Peel and devein the shrimp if needed, rinse thoroughly, and pat-dry with a paper towel. Place the squid, mussels, clams, and shrimp into individual bowls and set aside.\n\nPrepare the fresh ingredients: Finely mince the garlic, onion, and parsley and set aside until needed.\n\nCook the linguini: Cook the linguini al–dente according to package directions in a large pot or deep sauté pan of boiling salted water. (I like to run water over the pasta to prevent them from sticking and cooking further.) Rinse out the pan and set it back on the stove.\n\nMeasure out the liquids: Measure out the milk and wine in individual measuring cups, set aside until needed.\n\nNow that we’ve got everything ready to go, it’s time to make this super delicious, decadent, and comforting Cream Sauce Seafood Pasta! Simply…\n\nCook the seafood: Heat extra virgin olive oil and unsalted butter in a medium sized sauté pan over medium-high heat, Once hot, add all of the seafood, lemon juice, kosher salt, freshly cracked black pepper, Herbs De Provence and sauté for a minute. Add garlic and a splash of dry white wine, give everything a good stir, then cover and steam for 4-6 minutes. Uncover the pan and transfer shrimp and squid to a clean bowl once they have just cooked through. Cover again and steam the clams and mussels for a further 3-5 minutes, or until their shells have opened and most of the wine has evaporated. Then, switch off the heat. (Note: Discard any clams or mussels after this point if their shells are still closed tight. They are not suitable to eat.)\n\nSauté the aromatics: In another large deep sauté pan, heat extra virgin olive oil and unsalted butter over medium-high heat until the butter has melted and is nice and bubbly. Once hot, add the onion and garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.\n\nAdd Parsley: Then add the fresh Italian parsley and sauté for another minute to combine.\n\nMake the white wine cream sauce: Whisk in the flour and cook for 2 minutes until thickened. Then pour in the dry white wine and continue whisking. Simmer until the mixture thickens and the wine has reduced, then lower the heat to medium and gradually pour in the milk while continuing to whisk. Stir in the spices & seasonings in the Spice Bowl and the freshly grated cheese. Mix until the cheese has melted.\n\nCombine everything together: Add the linguini and all of the seafood to the cream sauce and toss continuously to combine. Cook for 3-5 minutes or until heated through. The starches in the pasta will break down and the sauce will further thicken. Then, switch off the heat.\n\nTo Serve: Divide the Cream Sauce Seafood Pasta into four plates or transfer to a serving dish. Garnish with extra freshly chopped parsley if desired and serve immediately!\n\nFull instructions in recipe card below.\n\nFROZEN VS. FRESH SEAFOOD\n\nI use both fresh and frozen seafood in this recipe: fresh squid from the market, and frozen clams, shrimp, and mussels. Both work perfectly fine, and you can use fresh or frozen based on your personal preference or what you might already have on hand in your freezer.\n\nREHEATING LEFTOVERS\n\nI question your creamy pasta loving soul for having any leftovers at all. But if you do, microwaving with a few sprinkles of water will work just fine. As will reheating with a few sprinkles of water on the stovetop. But generally, this Cream Sauce Seafood Pasta tastes the best on the day of cooking. At the most, it will keep well in the fridge in a sealed airtight dish/container for 2-3 days.\n\nGuys, this Cream Sauce Seafood Pasta is comfort and homecooked FANCY food at it’s best, and I guarantee that it will disappear off your, your family’s, and friends’ plates FAST!\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Go grab everything you need to make this tantalizing and tasty pasta dish and have yourself a romantic feast for dinner tonight! 🤗\n\nMADE THIS RECIPE?

Place the squid, mussels, clams, and shrimp into individual bowls and set aside.\n\nPrepare the fresh ingredients: Finely mince the garlic, onion, and parsley and set aside until needed.\n\nCook the linguini: Cook the linguini al–dente according to package directions in a large pot or deep sauté pan of boiling salted water. (I like to run water over my pasta to prevent them from sticking and cooking further.) Rinse out the pan and set it back on the stove.\n\nMeasure out the liquids: Measure out the milk and wine in individual measuring cups, set aside until needed.\n\nFor the Seafood:\n\nCook the seafood: Heat extra virgin olive oil and unsalted butter in a medium sized sauté pan over medium-high heat, Once hot, add all of the seafood, lemon juice, kosher salt, freshly cracked black pepper, Herbs De Provence and sauté for a minute. Add garlic and a splash of dry white wine, give everything a good stir, then cover and steam for 4-6 minutes. Uncover the pan and transfer shrimp and squid to a clean bowl once they have just cooked through. Cover again and steam the clams and mussels for a further 3-5 minutes, or until their shells have opened and most of the wine has evaporated. Then, switch off the heat. (Note: Discard any clams or mussels after this point if their shells are still closed tight. They are not suitable to eat.)\n\nFor the Cream Sauce Seafood Pasta:\n\nSauté the onion and garlic: In another large deep sauté pan, heat extra virgin olive oil and unsalted butter over medium-high heat until the butter has melted and is nice and bubbly. Once hot, add the onion and garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.\n\nAdd the parsley: Add the fresh Italian parsley and sauté for another minute to combine.\n\nAdd flour and wine: Whisk in the flour and cook for 2 minutes, then slowly pour in the dry white wine and continue whisking. Simmer until the mixture thickens the wine has reduced – about 2-4 minutes.\n\nStir in milk, seasonings and cheese: Lower the heat to medium and gradually pour in the milk while continuing to whisk. Stir in the spices and seasonings and freshly grated cheese. Mix until the cheese has fully melted and the sauce starts to thicken.\n\nToss through pasta and seafood: Add the linguini and all of the seafood to the sauce and toss continuously to combine. Cook for 3-5 minutes or until heated through. The starches in the pasta will break down and the sauce will further thicken. Then, switch off the heat.\n\nTo Serve: Divide the Cream Sauce Seafood Pasta into four plates or transfer to a serving dish. Garnish with extra freshly chopped parsley if desired and serve immediately!\n\nNutrition\n\nServing Size: 1 plate\n\nCalories: 690\n\nSugar: 12g\n\nSodium: 1450.9mg\n\nFat: 28.6g\n\nSaturated Fat: 12.5g\n\nUnsaturated Fat: 12.4g\n\nTrans Fat: 0.1g\n\nCarbohydrates: 63.6g\n\nFiber: 3.4g\n\nProtein: 43.3g\n\nCholesterol: 223.5mg\n\nThis post may contain affiliate links.
