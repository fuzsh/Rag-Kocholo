Please read our disclosure policy.\n\nPasta al limone, also called lemon pasta, is a delicious Italian dish that combines the tangy flavor of lemon with tender pasta. This simple yet elegant single serving dish ready in 15 minutes!\n\nLooking for more quick and easy single serving pasta recipes? Try our fresh and flavorful Caprese Pasta, savory Mushroom Pasta, or creamy Chicken Paprika.\n\nWhy You’ll Love This Recipe\n\nIncredibly Delicious: This popular Italian dish features a tangy lemon-based sauce made with simple ingredients. It’s perfect as a main course or a side dish.\n\nA Light Pasta Dish: One of my favorite quick pasta meals is traditional Italian pasta al limone. I love this lighter version that skips the heavy cream. Instead, it uses butter, Parmesan cheese, and a bit of starchy pasta water to create a silky sauce. The dish is finished with fresh parsley or chopped basil and extra cheese.\n\nReady in Minutes: This pasta dish comes together in about 15 minutes, making it perfect for a busy weeknight.\n\nRecipe Doubles Well: Our recipe makes one generous serving of the best lemon pasta. If you want to make more, just double the ingredients for a second bowl.\n\nWhat Is Pasta al Limone?\n\nPasta al Limone is a classic Italian dish with a rich, tangy lemon sauce. The sauce combines butter, lemon zest, lemon juice, and Parmesan cheese, melting together to create a silky, indulgent sauce. The bright lemon flavor makes this a great choice for a light, satisfying meal. Our single serving version is perfect when you’re cooking for one and want a quick, delicious pasta dish.\n\nIngredients\n\nIf you have any ingredients leftover from this easy lemon pasta recipe, check out our Leftover Ingredients Recipe Finder.\n\nSpaghetti: You can use any pasta you like—linguine, angel hair, or bucatini all work great. Use 2 ounces of dry spaghetti, which equals about 1 cup of cooked spaghetti. The easiest way to measure 2 ounces of dry pasta is with a kitchen scale. If you don’t have one, it measures roughly 2 1/8 inches in circumference. Got extra spaghetti? Use some in Chicken Tetrazzini or Pesto Pasta.\n\nButter: I use salted butter.\n\nOlive Oil: I always use extra virgin olive oil in this lemon pasta recipe and all other recipes. Extra virgin olive oil is the least processed, retaining a true olive taste and more vitamins and minerals. You can use light olive oil if you prefer.\n\nLemon: Use a small lemon for both its juice and zest. Consider using extra lemon juice in a mini Lemon Cake.\n\nGarlic: Use 1 clove of minced garlic.\n\nRecipe Variations\n\nPasta al Limone is fantastic on its own, but it’s also incredibly versatile. If you’re in the mood to experiment, here are some tasty tweaks to make this dish uniquely yours.\n\nLemon Pasta with Chicken: Incorporate cooked chicken or repurpose leftover rotisserie chicken into the dish.\n\nCreamy Lemon Pasta: Add 1 tablespoon of heavy cream to the sauce, heating it briefly before mixing it with the pasta.\n\nPesto Twist: For an herby kick, stir in a spoonful of pesto into the pasta and sauce.\n\nShrimp Addition: Elevate your meal by tossing in some cooked shrimp for extra protein.\n\nHow To Make Pasta al Limone For One\n\nThese step-by-step photos and instructions are here to help you visualize how to make this recipe. See the recipe box below for ingredient amounts and full recipe instructions.\n\nCook the pasta in a medium-sized pot of salted boiling water according to package instructions to al dente, about 8 minutes. Reserve 1/4 cup of the pasta cooking water before draining.\n\nMelt the butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add lemon zest and garlic and cook, stirring frequently for 1 minute.\n\nStir in lemon juice.\n\nAdd the cooked spaghetti to the pan and toss with the other ingredients.\n\nAdd some of the pasta water and the Parmesan cheese and stir until the sauce thickens.\n\nRemove the skillet from the heat and add a pinch of salt if you feel it’s necessary. Toss again to combine, and if needed, add a little bit more of the pasta cooking water. Transfer to a bowl, top with more Parmesan cheese and a little fresh basil or chopped parsley if you have some on hand, and enjoy hot.\n\nExpert Tips\n\nRead through the entire recipe and the Ingredient Notes section of the post and gather your ingredients. Pasta al limone comes together quickly so it’s a good idea to have everything ready before beginning. Plus, if you have questions about any of the ingredients used or the recipe process, you will likely find the answers within the post.\n\nSalt your pasta cooking water. This ensures that your pasta is perfectly flavored from the start. Use 3/4 to 1 teaspoon of salt for every 4 cups of water. Some of the pasta water is also going to be used to flavor the sauce.\n\nRemember to save some of the pasta cooking water. This starchy liquid is perfect for adding additional flavor and helps the pasta and sauce hold together. It also helps to thicken the sauce.\n\nServing Suggestions\n\nLooking to round out your meal? Here are some stellar sides and accompaniments that complement the tangy flavors of Pasta al Limone beautifully.\n\nChicken Piccata: The lemony profile of chicken piccata pairs exceptionally well with Pasta al Limone.\n\nBaked Pork Chops: A savory option that balances the zesty flavors of your lemon pasta.\n\nServe with Salmon: Present your lemon pasta next to a salmon fillet or mix in some flaked salmon for a seafood twist.\n\nCrusty Bread: Nothing says Italian like a side of warm, crusty bread—perfect for sopping up any leftover sauce.\n\nGreen Salad: A simple, refreshing salad can be a great palate cleanser, especially with a light vinaigrette.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan I double this recipe?\n\nYes. If you’d like to make a delightful “lemon pasta for two”, simply double the ingredient amounts.\n\nDo I have to use spaghetti?\n\nAlthough I prefer using spaghetti or angel hair pasta in this recipe, you can use 2 ounces of your favorite type of pasta.\n\nCan I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh?\n\nAbsolutely! The lemon zest from the fresh lemon gives the sauce a tangy burst of fresh flavor but bottled lemon juice will work if necessary. Feel free to add a bit more lemon juice if you feel the sauce needs more tang.\n\nHow do I store leftover pasta al limone?\n\nLeftover lemon spaghetti will keep for 3 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. To reheat, melt a little butter in a skillet over medium heat, add the spaghetti and heat for a few minutes until warmed through.\n\nWays To Use Leftover Ingredients\n\nIf you have any ingredients leftover from this recipe, check out our Leftover Ingredients Recipe Finder or you might like to consider using them in any of these single serving and small batch recipes:\n\nFor more information on the cooking and baking dishes I use in our “recipes for one”, please visit our FAQ page.\n\nFor examples of the dishes used at One Dish Kitchen, please visit our Store page.\n\nIf you’ve tried this lemon pasta recipe or any recipe on One Dish Kitchen please let me know how you liked it by rating the recipe and telling me about it in the comment section below.\n\nAlso, if you take a picture please tag us on Instagram (@onedishkitchen) we’d love to see it!\n\nYour Cooking For One Source\n\nBecause you’re worth it\n\nPasta al Limone For One (Lemon Pasta)\n\n5 from 8 votes\n\nBy: Joanie Zisk\n\nPrep: 5 minutes mins\n\nCook: 10 minutes mins\n\nTotal: 15 minutes mins\n\nServings: 1 serving\n\nPasta al limone, also called lemon pasta, is a delicious Italian dish that combines the tangy flavor of lemon with savory pasta.
