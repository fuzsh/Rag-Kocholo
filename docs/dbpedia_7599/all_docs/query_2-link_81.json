        "text": "Spaghetti Aglio e Olio\n\nTry this spaghetti aglio e olio recipe once, and you'll make it over and over. It uses simple ingredients, it cooks in 20 minutes, and it's totally delicious.\n\nSpaghetti aglio e olio translates to ‚Äúspaghetti with garlic and oil.‚Äù The traditional dish contains little more than these ingredients. It might be finished with a sprinkle of parsley or a pinch of red pepper flakes, but even these are optional. In its simplest form, this classic Italian pasta features spaghetti, olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper.\n\nBut if you‚Äôve ever tried it, you know that spaghetti aglio e olio is far more than the sum of its parts. The garlic infuses the oil with rich, nutty flavor, and salty, starchy pasta cooking water transforms it into a deeply flavorful sauce. Add perfect al dente pasta to the mix, and it‚Äôs absolute heaven.\n\nSpaghetti aglio e olio has been my go-to order at Italian restaurants for years, but recently, it‚Äôs become one of my favorite dishes to make at home. It comes together in just 20 minutes, it uses a handful of pantry ingredients, and it‚Äôs simply delicious. If you have pasta, garlic, and olive oil in your kitchen, try it tonight! If you‚Äôre anything like me, you‚Äôll make it again the next night, and again the next. üôÇ Yep, it‚Äôs that good.\n\nSpaghetti Aglio e Olio Recipe Ingredients\n\nOf course, my spaghetti aglio e olio recipe includes a few fresh twists. I start with these traditional ingredients:\n\nSpaghetti: If you don‚Äôt have spaghetti on hand, use whatever pasta you do have. I recommend choosing a long pasta like fettuccine, linguine, or bucatini, but if short-cut pasta is what‚Äôs in your kitchen, it‚Äôll still come out delicious.\n\nOlive oil: Use the best one you have.\n\nGarlic: The star ingredient! Don‚Äôt skimp on it ‚Äì it‚Äôs essential for infusing the pasta with rich, nutty flavor.\n\nRed pepper flakes: For heat! If you‚Äôre sensitive to spice, feel free to skip them, or start with just 1/4 teaspoon. If you want your pasta to have more of a kick, add up to 1/2 teaspoon.\n\nParsley: Sprinkle it over the pasta for a lovely fresh finish.\n\nThen, I add these unconventional (but tasty!) ingredients:\n\nLemon: It may not be totally authentic, but if you ask me, a little lemon never hurt anything. I use both lemon juice and zest to fill this pasta with bright flavor.\n\nKale: If you ask me, pasta + greens are a match made in heaven. Feel free to skip the kale if you prefer, or use different greens, such as spinach or Swiss chard, if you don‚Äôt have any kale on hand.\n\nParmesan cheese: Aglio e olio purists will tell you never to serve it with cheese, but I think a shower of freshly grated Parmesan or vegan Parmesan is a welcome touch. Its nutty taste pairs perfectly with the savory garlic.\n\n(See the full measurements at the bottom of this post!)\n\nHow to Make Spaghetti Aglio e Olio\n\nThis simple pasta comes together in just 20 minutes! Follow these steps to make it (+ find the full recipe below!):\n\nFirst, cook the pasta. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente. Reserve some of the starchy pasta water before you drain it!\n\nNext, toast the garlic and red pepper flakes. Heat the oil in a large skillet and add the garlic slices and red pepper flakes. Cook until the garlic is fragrant and lightly browned around the edges.\n\nThen, add the kale. Toss it with the garlic oil and cook until it wilts.\n\nFinally, stir in the pasta, along with the lemon juice and zest and a splash of the reserved pasta water. Toss to combine, adding more pasta water, as needed, to create a light sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. That‚Äôs it!\n\nGarnish the pasta aglio e olio with parsley and Parmesan cheese, if desired. Enjoy it on its own, or serve it with a salad like my Caesar salad, Caprese salad, or citrus salad. It would also be delicious with roasted broccoli or cauliflower and homemade focaccia or no-knead bread for sopping up any leftover oil.
