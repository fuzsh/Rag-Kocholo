        "text": "A Southern Italian Summer Pasta Salad.\n\nIt's summer in Italy and even here in the north where I live, the temperatures can get up to 40 degrees celsius! So, it's pasta salad time! This pasta salad crudaiola Barese, also called pasta alla crudaiola, is an incredibly versatile and healthy dish. You can eat it as a one-plate light meal, as part of a cold buffet or at a picnic.\n\nA patriotic pasta salad!\n\nPasta salad crudaiola Barese is super simple. It’s a white, red and green dish, which for me are the ubiquitous colours of Italian cuisine. Italians call these colours ‘il tricolore’ because they are, in fact, the colours of the Italian flag. There are other dishes that make use of these colours. Think Caprese salad! Patriotic cooking!\n\nThis pasta salad recipe comes from Bari in Puglia. It is made with fresh cherry tomatoes, a clove or 2 of garlic, fresh basil, a sprinkling of hard ricotta called Marzotica (or ricotta salata) and lots of extra virgin olive oil.\n\nThere are many types of pasta that go well in crudaiola Barese. Italians usually make pasta salad with short pasta. I have found recipes for this dish with the most popular and traditional pasta in Puglia such as orecchiette, sedani and cavatelli. I used sedani rigati.\n\nCrudaiola Barese is best kept simple.\n\nOne could almost call this a ‘non-recipe’ because it is so easy to do. Apparently, in Bari, pasta alla crudaiola is a very common and popular dish. However, I have read that some chefs and restaurants now vary the ingredients slightly, perhaps to make it look or sound more elegant or sophisticated. Personally, I love the simple original recipe.\n\nOf course, the local ingredients used in Puglia; such as the type of olive oil, hard ricotta and tomatoes, give this dish a particular flavour which is difficult to produce exactly unless you have those actual ingredients.\n\nHowever, I have made this recipe with the tomatoes, olive oil and hard ricotta which I can buy here in the north and the result is divine! Some years, I'm able to use my homegrown cherry tomatoes and basil which makes this dish really special! If you can't find hard ricotta or ricotta salata, you can also make pasta salad crudaiola Barese with aged feta!\n\nI think the most important thing is that the ingredients are of good quality, fresh and, if possible, organic.\n\nWhichever cheese you chose, I’m sure you’ll love this simple tasty pasta salad crudaiola Barese. If you give it a try, do let me know how it turns out, either by commenting below or on the Pasta Project Facebook page. And if you feel it’s worth sharing with friends please do.\n\nAll your feedback and support is much appreciated!\n\nBuon Appetito\n\nOther pasta salad recipes to enjoy\n\nCasarecce pasta caponata recipe from Sicily\n\nTuna and pesto malloreddus from Sardinia\n\nItalian shrimp and asparagus farfalle\n\nGreen pasta salad with edible flowers\n\nSave this recipe for later?\n\nIf you want to save this recipe for later, you can print it, bookmark this page or save it to Pinterest.\n\nThis recipe was originally published in 2017 but it has been updated."
