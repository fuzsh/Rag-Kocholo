        "text": "Mezzi Paccheri with Mushrooms and Cream; Recipe from Naples\n\nKnown as ‘miezi paccheri alla capa ’e’ mbrello in the local dialect, this Neapolitan recipe for mezzi paccheri with mushrooms and cream is super simple to make and outstandingly delicious!\n\n'Miezi paccheri alla capa’ e 'mbrello’.\n\nIn Neapolitan dialect, ‘si’na capa’ e ‘mbrella’ is an idiom that means doing things in a rough and haphazard way without thinking! I was unable to discover exactly when this pasta recipe got its name. But, I imagine that it was invented by someone putting ingredients together without following a particular recipe and just using what’s available. Something, I guess, we have all done at times, often with great results!\n\nCream is not a common ingredient in the Neapolitan kitchen. However, this mezzi paccheri with mushrooms and cream recipe can apparently be found in a famous Neapolitan cookbook called ‘Frijenno Magnanno’ a thousand and one recipes compiled by Luciano de Crescenzo. This cookbook is a collection of recipes from Campania and the author a well-known writer, actor and director from Naples.\n\nThe Mushrooms.\n\nYou can choose to use dried or fresh mushrooms. If using dried mushroom, you will need to soak them for about 20-30 minutes before cooking. I used fresh cremini and white button mushrooms this time, but I’d like to repeat this recipe with dried mushrooms one day soon!\n\nThe Pasta.\n\nTraditionally this recipe calls for mezzi paccheri. Paccheri are quite large wide pasta tubes which are typically Neapolitan. You can read more about paccheri in my post about this pasta. Mezzi paccheri are ‘half’ paccheri so, shorter pasta tubes. I used a pasta that’s very similar to mezzi paccheri called tuffoli. Tuffoli are a ridged pasta tube made by a company called Pasta Mancini from Le Marche, Central Italy.\n\nIn my opinion, Pasta Mancini is the equivalent of a ‘designer label’ pasta. This company makes its pasta from durum wheat it grows itself using sustainable farming methods and following a set of rules known as Good Agricultural Practices (GAP). In fact, its pasta factory is located in the middle of its own wheat fields!\n\nNeedless to say this company’s pasta is, like other high quality artisan pasta, extruded through bronze dies and slow dried. Definitely worth buying if you come across it.\n\nIf you live in US and want to buy the same pasta I used (Tuffoli from Mancini), I recently discovered an online Italian food store which sells this and some other great pasta called SupermarketItaly. You can order it from them!\n\nHow to make this mezzi paccheri with mushrooms and cream.\n\nMushrooms, cream, butter, eggs and Parmigiano (or vegetarian parmesan) are the main ingredients of this super simple recipe. The mushrooms are cooked in butter, while the eggs, cheese and cream are just mixed together and then added to the mushrooms. Once the pasta is cooked, you just mix it with the sauce and it’s ready.\n\nThis mezzi paccheri with mushrooms and cream is a bit like a carbonara with cream and mushrooms instead of guanciale. The combination of the eggs, cream and grated Parmigiano combined with the mushrooms cooked in butter create a fabulous sauce that really needs no other seasoning or flavours.\n\nLike carbonara, this recipe also has no onions, garlic or herbs. I added a sprinkling of parsley mostly for a bit of colour, but parsley isn’t in the original recipe, so you can omit it.\n\nIf you do try this mezzi paccheri with mushrooms and cream, I’d love to hear what you think. Please write a comment here on the blog or post a comment on the Pasta Project Facebook page.\n\nYour feedback means a lot to me!\n\nBuon Appetito!\n\nPin for later.\n\nOther paccheri recipes on The Pasta Project\n\nPaccheri with calamari and potato\n\nPaccheri with porcini, speck and pistachio\n\nSave this recipe for later?\n\nIf you want to save this recipe for later, you can print it, bookmark this page or save it to Pinterest.\n\nHave a look at my other mushroom pasta recipes for more delicious recipes like this one!\n\nWant to know more about my life in Italy?
