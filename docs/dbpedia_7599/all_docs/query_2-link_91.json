Please read my disclosure policy.\n\nAglio e Olio Pasta, also known as Garlic and Olive Oil, is a traditional pasta dish made with simple and fresh flavors. It truly is more than the sum of its parts.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nToggle\n\nSimplicity at Its Finest\n\nThis olive oil and garlic pasta dish is all about the simplicity of the ingredients. It is also ready in only 15 minutes. That’s better than take-out, plus this is homemade so it’s better in every sense of the word.\n\nOlive oil and garlic really are the start of many wonderful sauces, but in this pasta dish, they actually get a chance to shine. It’s a very popular dish in Italy! Just think of all the amazing food they have to pick from, and this is one dish that truly stands out. You have to try it!\n\nIngredients You’ll Need\n\nPasta – I used linguini. I think this recipe works best with long shapes such as spaghetti or fettuccini, but you can use small shapes such as penne if that’s what you prefer.\n\nOlive oil – Make sure to use regular olive oil for cooking this rather than extra virgin olive oil. EVOO has a very low smoke point, and can burn easily to give off a bitter flavor.\n\nGarlic – The more the merrier in this recipe! Make sure to get fresh garlic so you can slice it.\n\nRed pepper flakes – Use as much or as little as you like.\n\nSalt and pepper – Season to taste.\n\nParsley – This time the parsley isn’t just a garnish! We are using lots of it today to add a beautiful fresh flavor to this pasta.\n\nOptional: Parmesan and lemon juice – A squeeze of fresh lemon is pretty typical to cut through the oil and balance out this dish. Parmesan isn’t usually served with aglio e olio, but it always has a place on my plate! Others also love to add some anchovies to this dish, so if you like anchovies it might be worth a try.\n\nHow To Make Aglio E Olio\n\nThis Aglio e Olio is a piece of cake to whip up. It’s one of those dishes that’s so easy yet so flavorful, you’ll feel like a pro in no time. Let’s get cooking!\n\nBoil The Pasta\n\nFirst things first, grab a large pot, fill it with water, and bring it to a rolling boil. Don’t forget a generous pinch of salt – it does wonders for the pasta! Toss in the fettuccine and let it cook until it’s al dente. That means it should be tender but still have a bit of a bite to it.\n\nSizzle The Garlic\n\nWhile your pasta is doing its thing, let’s start on that garlicky, spicy oil. Grab a large skillet and pour in that lovely olive oil. Heat it up over medium heat – you want it warm but not smoking hot. Now, gently add your sliced garlic and those peppy red pepper flakes. Stir them around and watch as the garlic turns a beautiful golden brown.\n\nToss It Together\n\nOnce your pasta is perfectly cooked, drain it but save about half a cup of that pasta water – it’s liquid gold! Now, turn down the heat on your skillet to medium-low and add the drained pasta right in there. Throw in the chopped parsley too for that fresh, herby kick. Give everything a good toss. If it looks a bit dry, splash in some of that pasta water to bring it all together.\n\nThe Final Touch\n\nAlmost done! It’s time to make this dish sing. Squeeze some fresh lemon juice over the pasta and sprinkle a generous amount of freshly grated Parmesan cheese.\n\nServe With This\n\nWith a handful of ingredients, the main sauce ingredients being olive oil and garlic, you’ll end up with one of the most delicious pastas you’ll ever try. I love to serve this with a side of Kale and Quinoa Salad, and a slice of garlic bread.\n\nYou can also top your pasta with baked chicken breast, sliced, to add protein and create a full meal.

It is a traditional pasta recipe from Naples. This dish is made by sautéing sliced garlic in olive oil, sometimes with the addition of red pepper flakes, or anchovies. Add pasta such as spaghetti, linguini, or fettuccine in and toss it well.\n\nCan I use a different type of pasta for Aglio e Olio?\n\nAbsolutely! While traditional Aglio e Olio is made with linguini or spaghetti, feel free to use whatever pasta you have on hand or prefer. Short pastas like penne or fusilli can work too, just keep an eye on the cooking time as it varies with different pasta shapes.\n\nCan I make Aglio e Olio gluten-free?\n\nYes, you can! Simply substitute the regular pasta with your favorite gluten-free pasta. There are many great options available, like rice pasta or legume-based pastas. Just follow the cooking instructions on the package for the best results.\n\nExpert Tips\n\nQuality of Olive Oil Matters: Since olive oil is one of the main ingredients, use the best quality you can find.\n\nWatch the Garlic Carefully: Garlic burns easily and can turn bitter. Cook it over medium heat until it’s just golden. This brings out its sweetness and prevents it from overpowering the dish.\n\nReserve Pasta Water: Always keep some pasta water aside before draining. The starchy water is perfect for adjusting the consistency of your sauce and helps the garlic and oil emulsion cling to the pasta.\n\nSalt Your Pasta Water Well: This is your chance to flavor the pasta itself. The water should taste like seawater, which ensures your pasta is well-seasoned from the inside out.\n\nFresh Ingredients Make a Difference: Use fresh parsley and freshly squeezed lemon juice for a bright, fresh taste.\n\nStorage\n\nThis dish is best served fresh, as the oil tends to separate from the pasta after being refrigerated. It’s still just as delicious, however you may need to take an extra step in re-heating if the oil bothers you.\n\nYour leftovers will last 3-5 days in the fridge. To reheat, you can simply microwave it. To reduce the amount of separated oil in your bowl, reheat your leftovers in a skillet over medium-heat with a splash of water. Continually toss the pasta well as it heats up to re-create the sauce.\n\nDiscover More Delicious Pasta Recipes\n\nItalian Pasta Salad\n\nPasta Alla Vodka\n\nArugula and Walnut Pesto Pasta\n\nInstant Pot Baked Ziti\n\nPesto Shrimp Asparagus Pasta\n\nPasta Alla Gricia\n\nItalian Shrimp Bake with Pasta\n\nEasy Chicken Alfredo Pasta Bake\n\nLemon Pasta\n\nBefore You Begin!

Add the fettuccine and cook until al dente, or slightly underdone.\n\nWhile pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large deep skillet or saute pan over medium heat.\n\nOnce the oil is simmering add the garlic slices and the red pepper flakes and stir.

If the pasta is too dry add some of the pasta water, about half a cup.\n\nGarnish with lemon juice and freshly grated parmesan cheese.\n\nNotes\n\nPasta Choice: Linguini or spaghetti are traditional, but feel free to use any pasta you like. Cooking times may vary, so check the package instructions.\n\nOlive Oil: Opt for good quality extra virgin olive oil for the best flavor, as it’s the base of your sauce.\n\nGarlic Slicing: Thinly slice the garlic for even cooking. Avoid mincing as it can burn easily and turn bitter.\n\nChili Flakes: Adjust the amount of red pepper flakes according to your heat preference. Start with less, as you can always add more at the end.\n\nPasta Water: Don’t forget to reserve some pasta water before draining. It’s great for adjusting the sauce’s consistency.\n\nSeasoning: Taste as you go and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Remember, the pasta water adds saltiness too.\n\nNutrition Information\n\nServing: 1servingCalories: 563kcal (28%)Carbohydrates: 59g (20%)Protein: 13g (26%)Fat: 30g (46%)Saturated Fat: 5g (31%)Polyunsaturated Fat: 3gMonounsaturated Fat: 21gCholesterol: 6mg (2%)Sodium: 347mg (15%)Potassium: 238mg (7%)Fiber: 3g (13%)Sugar: 2g (2%)Vitamin A: 685IU (14%)Vitamin C: 8mg (10%)Calcium: 133mg (13%)Iron: 2mg (11%)\n\n© Author Joanna Cismaru\n\nNotice: Nutrition is auto-calculated for your convenience.
