        "text": "Spaghetti Margherita is one of the most popular recipes on A Bountiful Kitchen! It’s simple, fresh, delicious, and I know you’re going to love it as much as we do!\n\nFresh tomatoes, olive oil, butter, garlic, fresh basil, grated Parmesan and creamy mozzarella tossed with spaghetti. This classic dish takes minutes to make. Start to table in 30 minutes. It is quite possibly the most perfect dinner!\n\nAn easy to make weeknight dinner, but also special enough to serve to guests. Throw together a crisp Caesar salad and our favorite No-Fail French Bread and you’ve got a complete meal! The photos on this post show the finished dish in a serving bowl, but most of the time, I serve it straight out of the pan on the stovetop!\n\nI originally posted this recipe in 2010, but have updated it a bit. Spaghetti Margherita is a simple and straight-forward dish. While the pasta is cooking, you can throw together the sauce.\n\nSome people think- Margherita Pasta? Is that alcoholic? The answer is no. Legend (some question this) says that Pizza Margherita was created in the late 1800’s, and named for Queen Margherita to reflect the colors of the Italian flag. The pasta variation followed.\n\nI know I say this all of the time, but EVERYONE loves this dish. When I make it for my boys, they love it, even though it is meatless. When one of our sons returned form serving a mission in Guatemala for two years, this was his request for first meal at home. That’s saying something, don’t you think?? I hope you love this Foster family favorite!"
