        "text": "An upcoming documentary on controversial film director Quentin Tarantino, \"QT8: The First Eight,\" lists a proud former El Pasoan and UTEP benefactor in the credits.\n\nUniversity of Texas at El Paso graduate Allen Gilmer, who founded Drillinginfo, one of the largest oil and gas data and analytics software companies, is a producer of the documentary.\n\nThe documentary is the third film that Gilmer has financially supported, following a growing interest in films and screenwriting.\n\n\"The people who like Tarantino really like the way he tells stories. He's done very unusual stories and there are certain directors and writers that have so many layers and nuances in their work, you have to watch them over and over, and each time you get something else out of it,\" he said.\n\nGilmer, who lives in Austin, learned of the documentary from its director, Tara Wood, who is a good friend of his wife. The documentary doesn't feature Tarantino, but he gave his permission for the project.\n\nGilmer said Wood originally had produced the film with The Weinstein Co., then had to sue for control of it following the sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein.\n\nShe demanded control of the documentary when the scandal broke because she thought it was imperative the controversy be in it, Gilmer said.\n\nThe documentary, which will be shown for one night only Oct. 21 in select Cinemark theaters, addresses the Weinstein scandal and others, including Uma Thurman's car crash during the filming of \"Kill Bill\" and accusations of gratuitous violence. It also features interviews with actors and producers, including Samuel L. Jackson, Jamie Foxx, Diane Kruger and Christoph Waltz.\n\n\"They talk about what it was like to work with him (Tarantino) and the thematic aspects\" of his first eight films, Gilmer said.\n\nThe film shows clips from \"Reservoir Dogs,” “Pulp Fiction,” “Jackie Brown,” “Kill Bill Vol. 1,” “Kill Bill Vol. 2,” “Inglourious Basterds,” “Django Unchained” and “The Hateful Eight.\n\nGilmer added that Tarantino expressed interest in seeing the documentary at the Cannes Film Festival, where it was screened in May, while the general public was interested in seeing his ninth film, \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,\" which premiered two days afterward at the festival.\n\nMovie project in El Paso, Las Cruces\n\nWith more leisure time, Gilmer said he already has another movie project in the works, this time in El Paso and the Las Cruces area.\n\n\"We have a script. It's called 'Death in Texas,' and it's a story of an unwed mother and the son she raises. He's making a lot of bad choices and goes to prison. And he has an epiphany that his mother is the only thing he has,\" he said.\n\nGilmer, 57, said the film will feature Bruce Dern, Lara Flynn Boyle and Ronnie Gene Blevins as the lead character.\n\n\"This last summer I introduced the line producer, the director and (Blevins) to El Paso. If we are going to do this, El Paso needs to be a major character in this film,\" he said. \"The whole Mexican border and especially El Paso has got a pretty special tale to tell.\"\n\nHe added, \"I really want to get people excited about El Paso and bring movies to El Paso.\"\n\nBrandon Menchen, also one of the film's producers, said principal photography will begin Monday, Oct. 21, in Las Cruces.\n\nMenchen said Gilmer had some particular areas of El Paso he's interested in highlighting, such as murals at Lincoln Park, the Smeltertown Cemetery and Scenic Drive.\n\nWith each film he's produced, Gilmer said he's learned a big lesson — to read the script. The first film he produced with a group was \"Dirty Weekend\" in 2015. It starred Matthew Broderick and was a flop.\n\nThe second one was \"Nothing Stays The Same: The Story of The Saxon Pub,\" a documentary looking at the past 30 years of live music in Austin's legendary bar. The film premiered at the South by Southwest Festival in March.\n\nThe third one is the Tarantino film.\n\nThe fourth is the one that will be filmed in the Borderland.\n\n\"My wife, Riki Rushing, and I are investing roughly $3 million in the production. It is being filmed in Las Cruces, the Upper Valley, and El Paso. Several critical scenes are being filmed in El Paso, highlighting certain unique locales the city has,\" he said.\n\nAs part of the majority sale of Enverus (formerly Drillinginfo) to San Francisco-based private equity firm GenStar, Gilmer stepped down as executive chairman of the board and now serves as founder/adviser for Enverus, he said. He also serves on its board of directors. As founder/adviser, he speaks at conferences and writes articles on energy for various publications.\n\nLast year, Gilmer and his wife donated $1 million to UTEP for its economic geology program at the Center for Entrepreneurial Geosciences in the Department of Geological Sciences.\n\nBut, in addition to philanthropy, film has drawn his focus.\n\n\"Now that I have the time, storytelling just sounds like a lot of fun. And it beats golf. I don't know how to play,\" he said.\n\nMore film news: 'Spy Kids' filmmaker Robert Rodriguez coming to El Paso Film Festival\n\nMore: El Paso author Ron Stallworth named grand marshal of Sun Bowl Parade\n\nMaría Cortés González covers entertainment and trending news in the El Paso area.
