He is on the list of few directors; the audience especially goes to watch a film by the director's name rather than the actors or actresses. You must have seen or heard about Quentin Tarantino films from your peer groups.\n\nTarantino grew up in Los Angeles. Started as an independent filmmaker with the film Reservoir Dogs (1992). He funded this film from the money he earned by selling script of the film True Romance (1993). Tarantino got married to Daniella Pick, an Israeli singer and model (image in the attachment).\n\nThe most talked-about film of Tarantino. Released in 1992, this is the film that made Tarantino a household name. The opening restaurant scene to that Samuel Jackson's burger scene. Everything about this film is studied by the film students and loved by the cinephiles. A neo-noir dark comedy, this is one of the hightest rated films on IMDB. A life-changing film for Uma Thurman. Watch it if you want to see the dark Underworld of Los Angeles.\n\nEA group of black-suited guys are on a mission. Each of them is a maniac in its own way. The first film of Tarantino is regarded as a classic of Independent films. It was named \"Greatest Independent Film of all Time\" by Empire.\n\nSet during WW2, This movie is exhilarating and forces you to cling to the edge of your seat and hold your breath throughout the course of the film. It is refreshing seeing movies that are of good quality and yet oh so ever lacking the lustre of mainstream media."
