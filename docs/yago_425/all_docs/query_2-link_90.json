It is an unfinished game jam entry? I can retry later if it gets patched or explained or something.\n\nEDIT: Ok, now I've actually been able to play the game proper by holding down the key. It's a decent little arcade game, but unfortunately I found it rather awkward and frustrating. I like the idea behind the game getting more and more harder since burying creates tombstones that make it more difficult to walk around, but the execution didn't work for me: most of the time it just led to coffins appearing in blocked-off areas or on top of others which made it an inevitable failure."
