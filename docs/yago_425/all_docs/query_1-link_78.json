        "text": "Miramax / Weinstein Company\n\nIt's tough to nail down one favorite Quentin Tarantino character, so with the release of his latest film \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" this week, we ranked them all. Spoiler warning: If you're reading this list, you've likely seen the films many times over. But just in case, there are spoilers. You will not agree with the order of this list, and that's OK. Read below, and please share your favorites in the comments.\n\n120. Adolf Hitler (Martin Wuttke) / Joseph Goebbels (Sylvester Groth), From “Inglourious Basterds”\n\nI’m not about to call any of these characters “worse than Hitler,” so let’s be perfectly clear about where the Nazi leaders stand on this list of people, fictional or otherwise. German actors Martin Wuttke and Sylvester Groth do fine work for the purposes of Tarantino’s story, but it should be obvious Hitler is the worst character by default.\n\n119. Trucker (Jonathan Loughran), From “Kill Bill, “Vol. 1”\n\n“Oh yeah, boy.” It’s too bad Tarantino felt the need to write this character, let alone call Adam Sandler’s pal Jonathan Loughran to play the rapist truck driver for an affecting if unnecessary moment in an otherwise spotless epic.\n\n118. Jasper (Jonathan Loughran), From “Death Proof”\n\n“What’s a cheerleader movie?” Loughran returned to play another backwoods pervert, to whom the women trade their friend so they can test-drive a rare car.\n\n117. Dov/Nate/Omar (Eli Roth/Omar Doom/Michael Bacall), From “Death Proof”\n\n“Dude, as long as a guy’s buyin’ the booze, a f----- b----’ll drink anything.” Just as dangerous as looming stalker Stuntman Mike -- and perhaps that was the point Tarantino was clumsily making -- this predatory trio of losers would have been best left on the cutting room floor.\n\n116. Donny “The Bear Jew” Donowitz (Eli Roth), From “Inglourious Basterds”\n\n“Teddy f----- Williams knocks it out of the park! Fenway Park on its feet for Teddy f----- Ballgame! He went yard on that one, out to f----- Lansdowne Street!” A talented filmmaker, Eli Roth needs polish in front of the camera. His performance distracts with every line, movement and facial expression, giving Tarantino’s otherwise perfect World War II flick its biggest imperfection.\n\n115. Reverend & Mrs. Harmony (Bo Svenson and Jeannie Epper), From “Kill Bill, Vol. 2”\n\n“Rufus... he’s the man.” Tarantino gets to pay homage to a pair of big and small screen heroes, just with a pair of non-roles in one of his worst scenes.\n\n114. Lee Montgomery (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), From “Death Proof”\n\n“Gulp.” She landed a part in a Tarantino flick, but we wouldn’t see what Winstead could truly do on screen until a larger role in Edgar Wright’s “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.” To no fault of her own, she merely ends up the object of a backwoods creep’s affection.\n\n113. Francesca Mondino (Julie Dreyfus), From “Inglourious Basterds”\n\nGiven a similarly steely part in “Kill Bill,” Dreyfus returns to do little but translate for Goebbels and shoot a telling look to Shosanna in a gross flashback akin to a “Family Guy” gag.\n\n112. Minnie Mink (Dana Gourrier), From “The Hateful Eight”\n\n“Oui. Look at that, y’all. I can speak French.” Gourrier brings a lot of personality to a character we mostly hear about when she’s off screen, and it probably worked better that way. That said, she didn’t deserve the fate she got.\n\n111. Warren (Quentin Tarantino), From “Death Proof”\n\n“Hey Warren. Who is this guy?” “Stuntman Mike.” “And who the hell is Stuntman Mike?” “He’s a stuntman.” Tarantino’s least problematic character he wrote for himself, for what it’s worth. Inconsequential to the story, the writer/director seemed just want to be along for the ride in Austin, Texas.\n\n110. Amerigo Vessepi (Franco Nero), From “Django Unchained”\n\n“I know.” Cool to see a cameo from the original Django, but hard to root for a slave trader.\n\n109. Ace Speck/Butch Pooch (James Remar), From “Django Unchained”\n\n“Last chance, fancy pants.” Not sure why Remar played two roles in this. Perhaps another actor dropped out and he filled that need. Sadly for the “Sex and the City” star, neither does the trick.\n\n108. Jody Domergue (Channing Tatum), From “The Hateful Eight”\n\n“How ya doin’, dummy?” Few knew Channing Tatum would turn up in Tarantino’s western chamber play. Plenty menacing, but how does an Alabama native deliver such a bad southern accent?\n\n107. LeQuint Dickey Mining Company guys (Michael Parks, John Jarratt, Quentin Tarantino), From “Django Unchained”\n\n“Now why would a slave have a ‘wanted dead or alive’ handbill in his pocket?” In a scene the film could have certainly done without, this dopey trio get conned by a desperate Django in a bid to escape and rescue his wife. Tarantino’s Australian accent -- woof. Michael Parks nearly redeems it.\n\n106. Joe Gage / Grouch Douglass (Michael Madsen), From “The Hateful Eight”\n\n“You’re writing your life story?” “You bet I am.” “Am I in it?” “You just entered.” The least interesting of the titular eight. Mr. Blonde deserved better than this gravelly voiced outlaw.\n\n105. Six-Horse Judy (Zoë Bell), From “The Hateful Eight”\n\n“Cause I’m the only Judy you’ve ever seen who can drive a six-horse team.” ...And his victim certainly deserved better. Tarantino snuck his buddy Zoe Bell in for a smiley but fateful cameo.\n\n104. OSS Commander (Harvey Keitel), From “Inglourious Basterds”\n\n“Is that clear, Lieutenant?” The easiest paycheck Keitel ever earned, his off-screen commander ends the war by cutting a deal with S.S. officer Hans Landa, sort of to the chagrin of a bloodthirsty Aldo Raine.\n\n103. Rufus (Samuel L. Jackson), From “Kill Bill, Vol. 2”\n\n“I was a Drell. I was a Drifter. I was a Coaster. I was part of The Gang. I was a Bar-Kay... If they come through Texas, I done played with them.” Even if it takes a cameo, Tarantino will sneak his longtime and best collaborator into his work, like he does here during the aforementioned unfortunate opening scene of “Vol. 2.”\n\n102. Leonide “Leo” Moguy (Dennis Christopher), From “Django Unchained”\n\n“He doesn’t speak French. Don’t speak French to him, it’ll embarrass him.” Until I made this list, I had no idea the Italy-obsessed cyclist from “Breaking Away” played Calvin Candie’s associate and protector of the slave trader’s fragile ego.\n\n101. Larry Gomez (Larry Bishop), From “Kill Bill, Vol. 2”\n\n“F----- with your cash is the only thing you kids seem to understand!” Strangely, probably the most uncomfortable I’ve ever felt watching a Tarantino movie is when Budd wanders into this strip club owner’s office to get another tongue-lashing. Appropriately scummy, I reckon.\n\n100. Mark Dargas (Michael Bowen), From “Jackie Brown”\n\n“Cut to 13 years later, you’re 44 years of age. You’re flying for the s----iest-little-shuttle-f------ piece of s--- Mexican airline that there is.” Tarantino introduced the virtually unknown Bowen to a new generation of film lovers in his third film as writer/director, casting him as Michael Keaton’s partner.\n\n99. Spencer “Big Daddy” Bennett (Don Johnson), From “Django Unchained”\n\n“Well, c’mon inside and get yourself somethin’ cool to drank!” I’m surprised it took this long for Tarantino to cast Johnson in a movie, but he steals a few scenes as the foul-mouthed plantation owner and charter member of the KKK.\n\n98. B.B. (Perla Haney-Jardine), From “Kill Bill, Vol. 2”\n\n“I am pervious to bullets, Mommy.” Haney-Jardine proved plenty worth the blood-spattered journey to rescue her, we just wish the big finale earned it better.\n\n97. The 5.6.7.8′s, From “Kill Bill, Vol. 1”\n\nThis Japanese rock trio give the House of Blue Leaves sequence the perfect dose of surf rock to heighten the tension and throw it back to Tarantino’s previous musical inclinations.\n\n96. Jimmie, From “Pulp Fiction” “Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.”\n\nI’m not as quick to dismiss Tarantino’s acting chops as most are, but his work as Jimmie from Toluca Lake was plenty problematic at the time. Already known for his penchant for using a particular racial epithet in his dialogue, Tarantino gave himself a few lines that still beg the question: Why?\n\n95. Oswaldo Mobray / English Pete Hicox (Tim Roth), From “The Hateful Eight”\n\n“The man who pulls the lever that breaks your neck will be a dispassionate man. And that dispassion is the very essence of justice. For justice delivered without dispassion is always in danger of not being justice.” I was delighted to see Roth reunite with his “Reservoir Dogs” and “Pulp Fiction” writer/director but just wish he’d been given a bit more to do, outside of his superfluous monologue about frontier justice.\n\n94. Buck (Michael Bowen), From “Kill Bill, Vol. 1”\n\n“Yo, stud! Time’s up!” Bowen, in his second straight collaboration with Tarantino, returns in a more memorable but much smarmier turn as an RN who prostitutes women on a coma ward. Don’t worry, he gets what’s coming to him...\n\n93. Winston Churchill (Rod Taylor), From “Inglourious Basterds”\n\n“Brief him.” Australian-born actor Rod Taylor would likely make an impact no matter whom he played in a Tarantino flick, but as Winston Churchill quietly sitting and puffing on a cigar during a key mission briefing, he kills it.\n\n92. Maynard, Zed and the Gimp (Duane Whitaker, Peter Greene, Stephen Hibbert), From “Pulp Fiction”\n\n“Zed? It’s Maynard. Yeah, spider just caught a couple of flies.” Even by the midpoint of “Pulp Fiction,” you knew things could get weird in a Tarantino movie, but you really didn’t know how weird. Butch and Marsellus’ beef wanders into the wrong pawn shop, owned by hillbilly predators, making their escape and revenge pretty satisfying. Most also probably only knew Peter Greene as the villain from “The Mask,” so this was an unpredictable turn, to say the least.\n\n91. House of Blue Leaves owners (Yuki Kazamatsuri, Sakichi Sato), From “Kill Bill, Vol. 1”\n\n“Did you hear about the Tanaka clan? You’re gonna get your head cut off.” “No, I don’t want that!” Waiting on hand and foot for crime boss O-Ren Ishii and her Crazy 88 gang, the husband-and-wife owners of the House of Blue Leaves just don’t want to end up dead. They’re left with a bit of a mess to clean up, but their heads aren’t rolling.\n\n90. Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker), From “Reservoir Dogs”\n\n“What’s special?” It’s likely Tarantino just wanted an excuse to cast the crime fiction writer and convicted felon in his debut, because Bunker only ends up with a few lines total, but he at least leaves an impression as Mr. Blue.\n\n89. O.B. Jackson (James Parks), From “The Hateful Eight”\n\n“I ain’t ever goin’ out in that s--- ever, ever again!” You mean there’s a likable character in “The Hateful Eight?” The poor stagecoach driver does all the work and gets little thanks for his trouble, nearly dying in a blizzard and then drinking poison to boot.\n\n88. Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly (Laura Cayouette), From “Django Unchained”\n\nGiven just a few lines, Cayouette’s outstanding facial expressions tell us all we want to know about Calvin Candie’s sister.\n\n87. Narrator (Samuel L. Jackson), From “Inglourious Basterds”\n\n“Needless to say, once the Basterds heard of him, he never got there.” Like you need an excuse to cast Samuel L. Jackson. With just a few lines of narration, Tarantino’s favorite actor leaves a mark, giving us background intel on Hugo Stiglitz and a lesson on the flammability of nitrate film.\n\n86. Shanna (Jordan Ladd), From “Death Proof”\n\n“Now there is one thing every girl in the whole world whose name is Shanna has in common with each other - we all hate the name Shawna. And we really hate when people call us Shawna. Remember it’s Shanna banana not Shawna banawna.” A firecracker with a heavy twang accent, Shanna takes her gig as best friend to Jungle Julia and Arlene seriously during their suddenly perilous night. Perhaps unluckiest for her, she’s stuck with Eli Roth.\n\n85. Wilhelm (Alexander Fehling), From “Inglourious Basterds”\n\n“Excuse me, Captain, but your accent is very unusual.” Cursed with Tarantino’s callback to his own “Mexican standoff” routine in multiple movies, this drunken soldier celebrating the birth of his child ratchets up the tension by interrupting the Basterds’ rendezvous with a double agent in a basement tavern soon to be riddled with bullets.\n\n84. General Sanford “Sandy” Smithers (Bruce Dern), From “The Hateful Eight”\n\n“I just met these people, I don’t give a damn about them! Or you, or your sister. Or any other son of a bitch in Wyoming for that matter.” Legendary actor Bruce Dern is one of the titular “Hateful Eight” but is given the least to do until Samuel L. Jackson’s bounty hunter blesses the Confederate officer with a story and then a bullet.\n\n83. Johnny Mo (Gordon Liu), From “Kill Bill, Vol. 1”\n\nGordon Liu certainly looked the part as O-Ren Ishii’s right-hand man and leader of the Crazy 88, but he fell a bit short on the promise of his character intro, despite a fun but brief fight with the Bride.\n\n82. Abernathy Ross (Rosario Dawson), From “Death Proof”\n\n“Did you just hit a boat?” Determined to partake in any shenanigans instead of getting left behind once again, Dawson’s movie makeup and hairstylist tags along for some scary stunt driving before being stalked and attacked by Stuntman Mike. But the tables soon turn, and this “mum” brings it.\n\n81. Brett (Frank Whaley), From “Pulp Fiction”\n\n“What?” Too ambitious for his own good, young Brett decides to steal from Marcellus Wallace and endures the wrath of Jules and Vincent one unfortunate morning. After a stop at Big Kahuna Burger, he tries to talk his way out of it, but can only muster one “what” after another before bye bye, Brett.\n\n80. Billy Crash (Walton Goggins), From “Django Unchained”\n\n“Oh, I’m’ll go walkin’ in the moonlight with you...” As Calvin Candie’s right-hand muscle man, Alabama native Walton Goggins stands out in what little screen time he has, particularly during a near-confrontation with Django. He’d make up for it in Tarantino’s next film.\n\n79. Karen Kim (Helen Kim), From “Kill Bill, Vol. 2”\n\n“Congratulations.” Moments after she finds out she’s pregnant, an assassin blows a hole through her door. The two engage in a standoff where the Bride explains her life changed mere seconds ago, appealing to the woman holding a shotgun to understand. The reluctant Karen can’t help but let it go.\n\n78. Werner Rachtman (Richard Sammel), From “Inglourious Basterds”\n\n“You can’t expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.” In our introduction to the mythical Basterds, Sammel’s calm and collected officer stands toe-to-toe with Brad Pitt’s Nazi-scalping Aldo Raine before spouting anti-Semitic remarks and being beaten to death by the Bear Jew.\n\n77. Jody (Rosanna Arquette), From “Pulp Fiction”\n\n“That was pretty f------ trippy...” Arquette’s pierced and piercing wife to Eric Stoltz’s dealer Lance is all off us when Vincent Vega bursts into her home hoping revive an overdosed Mia Wallace. Eagerly anticipating the big moment, it seems as though she’s forgotten a woman might die in her living room.\n\n76. The Crazy 88, From “Kill Bill, Vol. 1”\n\nO-Ren Ishii’s black suit-clad Yakuza army make up much of Tarantino’s best-ever action sequence, giving Uma Thurman’s Bride all she can handle on her path to Bill. Amazing stunt work and acting by all.\n\n75. Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino), From “Reservoir Dogs”\n\n“What the f--- was I talking about?” It was only fitting that our formal introduction to Quentin Tarantino came from his own mouth, literally. The writer/director cast himself among the band of thieves in the heist gone wrong story, opening the film with a pop culture monologue subverting our feelings about Maddona’s hit “Like a Virgin,” giving us a clear idea of who he was and what was to come.\n\n74. Jungle Julia Lucai (Sydney Tamiia Poitier), From “Death Proof”\n\n“OK, we’re pretty clear on what it is you didn’t do. How ‘bout enlightening us on what it is you did do?”\n\nFull of swagger, this Austin disc jockey look for a little adventure in the form of margaritas, shots of chartreuse and a lake house before literally crashing into Stuntman Mike. The daughter of legendary actor Sidney Poitier, she holds her own with his complex dialogue and does her part in the Tarantino foot fetish department.\n\n73. Esteban Vihaio (Michael Parks), From “Kill Bill, Vol. 2”\n\n“I would’ve been much nicer. I would’ve just cut your face.” After reprising his Sheriff Earl McGraw, veteran actor and Tarantino favorite Michael Parks disappeared into this Mexican pimp an best buddy to Bill, helping the Bride locate her prey, not without a menacing warning. An unpleasant but impressive transformation.\n\n72. Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus), From “Kill Bill, Vol. 1”\n\n“Please... please forgive my betrayal.” O-Ren’s lawyer and also a former protégée of Bill’s, present at the wedding chapel massacre. So cold-blooded, she laughs through a phone call during the would-be murder of the Bride and her unborn child. That ringtone is just the worst.\n\n71. LaPadite daughters (Léa Seydoux, Tina Rodriguez, Lena Friedrich), From “Inglourious Basterds”\n\nPoor Perrier LaPadite has enough trouble protecting his own children, let alone a basement full of Jewish refugees attempting to hide from another Nazi round-up in the French countryside. The young women do their best as Col. Hans Landa barges into their home to interrogate their father, but it’s Seydoux’s appropriately unwelcoming glance that gives the detective his first hint.\n\n70. Winston (Tommy “Tiny” Lister Jr.), From “Jackie Brown”\n\n“That’s what Winston does. He finds people who don’t want to be found.” Just a few years removed from playing Deebo in “Friday,” Lister appears as Max Cherry’s right-hand man at the local bail bonds office, doing his job perhaps better than anyone alive. With Max’s utmost confidence and praise, they make a great team.\n\n69. The Basterds (Gedeon Burkhard, BJ Novak, Paul Rust, Omar Doom, Michael Bacall, Samm Levine), From “Inglourious Basterds”\n\n“The Gerrys have heard of them because these yanks have been them the devil.” When we heard about Tarantino’s long-gestating 2009 project, we assumed we’d see a lot of the titular Basterds, but they only make up a tiny fraction of the screen time in his World War II opus. And while we’d love to see even more of their off-screen exploits, we probably get as much as we should, especially considering he devotes even more of that time to characters with more depth like Shoshanna and Hans Landa. But hearing about rather than seeing their efforts only adds to their mystique\n\n68. Broomhilda “Hildi” von Shaft (Kerry Washington), From “Django Unchained”\n\n“Hey, big troublemaker.” Kerry Washington had little to chew on creatively here, but she makes up for her lack of lines with some impressive physical work, and whom better to root for than her? It’s heartbreaking when we finally catch up with her at Candyland.\n\n67. Arlene/Butterfly (Vanessa Ferlito), From “Death Proof”\n\nStuntman Mike: Do I frighten you? [Arlene silently nods] Stuntman Mike: Is it my scar? Arlene: It’s your car., Visiting her friends in Austin for the weekend, this lady otherwise known as “Butterfly” is equal parts scared and intrigued by Stuntman Mike. The Brooklyn-born actress brings a needed swagger and shot in the arm to a wonky start to Tarantino’s half of “Grindhouse.”\n\n66. Shiro (Kenji Ohba), From “Kill Bill, Vol. 1”\n\n“How come I always have to get the sake? You listen well. For 30 years, you make the fish, I get the sake. If this were the military, I’d be General by now!” Hattori Hanzo and his sushi restaurant employee seem fit for a buddy comedy, but we soon learn that their partnership extends to making the world’s deadliest samurai swords. After a hilarious introduction, they each get serious for a ceremonial moment that brings a reluctant Hanzo out of retirement.\n\n65. Marvin (Phil LaMarr), From “Pulp Fiction”\n\n“Man, I don’t even have an opinion.” Jules and Vincent’s man on the inside, the associate who rats out Brett for stealing from Marsellus Wallace and, after Vincent accidentally shoots him in the face, sets in motion the third and final chapter “The Bonnie Situation.” An original “Mad TV” cast member and voice of Samurai Jack, LaMarr has since carved out an impressive career, and he remains a fun footnote in Tarantino lore.\n\n64. Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton), From “Jackie Brown”\n\n“You don’t know? No clue? You’re clueless.” His first go-around with Elmore Leonard’s ATF agent Ray Nicolette, Keaton would reprise the role in Steven Soderbergh’s “Out of Sight” just a year later. There’s not much to him, other than he and Jackie take an interest in one another, but we could watch Keaton in just about any role.\n\n63. Nikki Bell (Ambrosia Kelley), From “Kill Bill, Vol. 1”\n\n“Mommy, what happened to you and the TV room?” The source of rumors fueled by Tarantino himself that this franchise could continue in the future. After the Bride murders Vernita Green in front of her, only time will tell if she decides to exact similar revenge when she’s old enough to understand.\n\n62. Señor Bob / Marco the Mexican (Demián Bichir), From “The Hateful Eight”\n\n“I’m guilty, I have a laissez-faire attitude about the hats. How about we forget about the hats today, considering there’s a blizzard going on? And make tomorrow no hat day!” Playing all sorts of angles, the Oscar-nominated Bichir is hard at work with the con once he and his gang have taken over Minnie’s Haberdashery by murdering the owners and staging the rescue of Daisy Domergue. He’s best in his scenes with Samuel L. Jackson’s Marquis Warren.\n\n61. Marcel (Jacky Ido), From “Inglourious Basterds”\n\n“Oui, Shosanna.” An oft-forgotten tragic figure from Tarantino’s epic, Ido’s tender-hearted projectionist does his lover Shoshanna’s bidding, recognizing the stakes and meaning of her objective and carrying out her final orders by burning the place down.\n\n60. Lance (Eric Stoltz), From “Pulp Fiction”\n\n“Hey, mi casa su casa.” Eric Stoltz’s lazy, racist drug dealer is nothing if he isn’t at least practical. He’s fine to pal around with his favorite customer Vincent Vega so long as he doesn’t burst into his house with an overdosed Mia Wallace in need of an adrenaline shot to the heart.\n\n59. D’Artagnan (Ato Essandoh), From “Django Unchained”\n\n“D’Artagnan, m----------r!” Seemingly a minor character in the grand scheme of things, but this person who Calvin Candie literally feeds to his dogs takes on great meaning to Django and King Schultz as they free Broomhilda and eventually exact their revenge in his name, with Schultz pointing out to pseudo-cultured monster Candie that the author of D’Artagnan’s namesake is indeed a person of color.\n\n58. Pam (Rose McGowan), From “Death Proof”\n\n“He’s just giving me a ride.” Rose McGowan gives one of her best performances as this lady out for a few drinks who accepts a ride home from the wrong guy. She assumes the best in people until it literally comes back to haunt her when she hopes in the seat that ain’t death proof.\n\n57. Budd (Michael Madsen), From “Kill Bill”\n\n“That woman deserves her revenge and we deserve to die.” Wise words, but as another modern western put it, deserve’s got nothing to do with it. He might know his comeuppance draws near, but Budd is a survivor and won’t go down without an unfair fight. Barely seen in “Vol. 1,” we see where this sad sack ends up once he’s parted ways with his brother Bill, bouncing at a strip joint and living out the rest of his days in a trailer in the desert. His unexpected death at the hands of Elle Driver used to bug me, but it seems fitting in retrospect.\n\n56. Kim Mathis (Tracie Thoms), From “Death Proof”\n\n“Whatever with your however.” An absolute ball of fire, Thoms must have been born ready for this role, powering through every line and action she gets, moving at a rapid pace that risks leaving her cast mates behind at times. Equipped with plenty of standard Tarantino profanity and one-liners, Thoms is game for it all, but my favorite moment comes after their first encounter with Stuntman Mike, as she’s moved to tears when she thinks her good friend and fellow stuntwoman Zoe might not come back, that is, until she does and they run him down.\n\n55. Ed Fenech (Mike Myers), From “Inglourious Basterds”\n\n“Whiskey, straight. No junk in it.” This was certainly unexpected. Tarantino takes plenty of risks with casting, but he’s nonetheless sure of himself, so bringing a broad comedy actor like Myers into the mix should have made as much sense as any other choice. A distraction for some, we love him as the British officer tasking Archie Hicox with Operation Kino. With plenty of comic flair, Myers manages to rein it in just enough to keep with the rest of the film’s tone, only adding to the fun.\n\n54. Pumpkin & Honey Bunny (Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer), From “Pulp Fiction”\n\n“Pretty smart, eh?” “Pretty smart.” Who finishes their breakfast and robs a crowded diner in broad daylight? A couple of nincompoops, that’s who, but it made sense in the moment. They just weren’t counting on running into a hitman in the midst of an existential crisis. Roth and Plummer light the fuse to a movie that would change the industry forever, as Dick Dale’s “Misirlou” punctuates the opening credits.\n\n53. Marvin Nash (Kirk Baltz), From “Reservoir Dogs”\n\n“Freddy... Freddy, how do I look?” The poor cop Joe Cabot’s team takes hostage during the rain of bullets in a heist gone totally wrong, LAPD officer Marvin Nash loses his ear and eventually his life, all while knowing the film’s biggest secret, that Mr. Orange is the inside man. A smaller part in the midst of some towering figures, Baltz humanizes the cop in a horrifically impossible situation.\n\n52. Gogo Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama), From “Kill Bill, Vol. 1”\n\n“You call that begging? You can beg better than that.” You know Tarantino couldn’t wait to cast Chiaki Kuriyama, who co-stars in one of his all-time favorite movies, the disturbing “Battle Royale,” and she delivers in a big and frightening way as O-Ren Ishii’s deadly bodyguard. We know her showdown with the Bride is coming, but even when it hits, it really hurts.\n\n51. Winston Wolfe (Harvey Keitel), From “Pulp Fiction”\n\n“If I’m curt with you it’s because time is a factor. I think fast, I talk fast and I need you guys to act fast if you wanna get out of this. So, pretty please with sugar on top. Clean the f------ car.” More style than substance, Winston Wolfe doesn’t exactly deliver on the hype heard from Jules in his plea to Marsellus, but that doesn’t mean we don’t enjoy watching Keitel work. They call him, he shows up, he tells them to clean a car, they do it, he arranges disposal of the car, and...that’s it. No muss, no fuss I guess? Like I said, at least he does it with style.\n\n50. Holdaway (Randy Brooks), From “Reservoir Dogs”\n\n“What is this?” “That’s an amusing anecdote about a drug deal.” “What?” “Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a f------ job, man.” A severely underrated character too often lost in the fold, Holdaway serves as the Lee Strasberg to Freddy Newandyke’s newcomer method actor, perhaps reflecting what Tarantino learned as a struggling actor. Also lends some needed levity to Mr. Orange’s backstory.\n\n49. Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger), From “Inglourious Basterds”\n\n“Don’t I look calm to you?” The rogue German soldier who murdered 13 Gestapo officers belongs on the list of Tarantino characters who probably deserve their own movie. After joining the Basterds’ wave of Nazi-killing, the combustible Stiglitz could blow at any minute, even as they try to lay low on undercover missions.\n\n48. Earl McGraw (Michael Parks), From “Kill Bill” and “Death Proof”\n\n“Well, a sure and steady hand did this. This ain’t no squirrelly amateur. This is the work of a salty dog. You can tell by the cleanliness of the carnage. Now a kill-crazy rampage though it may be, all the colors are kept within the lines. If you was a moron, you could almost admire it.” Speaking of which, we’re still saddened this Texas Ranger never got his own flick, but we’re pleased with what we did see from the late great Michael Parks. The actor debuted the world-weary lawman in “From Dusk Till Dawn” (written by Tarantino) and even prompts comparisons to Cormac McCarthy’s Ed Tom Ball, minus the profanity-laced pearls of wisdom.\n\n47. Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), From “The Hateful Eight”\n\n“When you get to hell, John, tell them Daisy sent you...” A highlight in Tarantino’s otherwise nasty chamber drama, Jennifer Jason-Leigh goes through a physical ringer, taking one beating after another from Kurt Russell’s bounty hunter and even treating us to a foreboding song.\n\n46. Zoe Bell (Zoe Bell), From “Death Proof”\n\n“I’m OK!” Tarantino must have been fed up with merely watching Bell sub for stunts, believing in a charisma that belonged on screen along with the perilous work. But even beyond the stunts, the character is just a total badass keen on running down Stuntman Mike.\n\n45. Boss Tanaka (Jun Kunimura), From “Kill Bill, Vol. 1”\n\n“And what exactly are we celebrating? The perversion of our illustrious council?” Known for his work in “Hard Boiled” and “Ichi the Killer,” Kunimura delivers an unexpected outburst and loses his head for it at the hands of newly risen leader O-Ren Ishii, who does not tolerate ridicule of her ethnicity and gender from his friends or enemies.\n\n44. Perrier LaPadite (Denis Ménochet), From “Inglourious Basterds”\n\n“I have no interest in such things.” This poor Frenchman does every last thing he can to protect the Jewish family hidden beneath the floorboards of his home on the French countryside. Exhausting his will (and English), the dairy farmer is no match for the wiles and charm of Col. Hans Landa, who traps him at the onset of their amazing opening scene, like the rodents they reference throughout.\n\n43. Esmarelda Villalobos (Angela Jones), From “Pulp Fiction”\n\n“So what does it feel like to kill a man with your bare hands?” At first, this quiet cab ride felt like a bore compared to the more ostentatious parts of the groundbreaking indie. In retrospect, Esmeralda’s prodding serves as key character-building for Butch, who just unknowingly murdered his opponent in a fight he was paid to throw.\n\n42. Melanie Ralston (Bridget Fonda), From “Jackie Brown”\n\n“You know you smoke too much of that s---, that s--- gonna rob you of your own ambition.” “Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.” Fonda finds the perfect blend of stoner/surfer girl laziness and cunning con as Ordell Robbie’s beach house girlfriend with little ambition outside of getting high and mocking her new ex-con friend.\n\n41. K-Billy DJ (Steven Wright), From “Reservoir Dogs”\n\n“That was The Partridge Family’s ‘Doesn’t Somebody Want to be Wanted?’ followed by Edison Lighthouse’s ‘Love Grows where my Rosemary Goes’ as K-Billy’s Super Sounds of the 70′s weekend just keeps on... truckin’.” What a perfect choice to cast stand-up comic Steven Wright, whose deadpan delivery perfectly contrasts the tone of the 1970s pop hits that score the lives of these violent men up to no good.\n\n40. Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger), From “Inglourious Basterds”\n\n“I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language besides English?” A German movie star doubling as a British agent during World War II is the stuff Tarantino’s dreams are made of. Cast a talented multilingual actress like Kruger, and voilà. Demanding as her dialogue clearly is, Kruger’s non-verbal choices hit just as hard, especially when it seems the jig is up for the Basterds.\n\n39. Captain Koons (Christopher Walken), From “Pulp Fiction”\n\n“And now, little man, I give the watch to you.” Imagine anyone other than Christopher Walken delivering this monologue. You’ll fail. As the Vietnam vet who gives a young Butch his father’s coveted gold watch, the Oscar-winner first plays it straight, until his famed mannerisms sneak in the stranger the story becomes.\n\n38. Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), From “The Hateful Eight”\n\n“Starting to see pictures, ain’t ya?” Jackson carries much of the thematic load of Tarantino’s western tale, sifting through the racial dynamics and modern parallels in for an otherwise mostly apolitical filmmaker. He plays wonderfully off of Kurt Russell and Walton Goggins in particular, and just ruins Bruce Dern’s day.\n\n37. “Monsieur” Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), From “Django Unchained”\n\n“Gentlemen, you had my curiosity, now you have my attention.” Go ahead and hire one of the greatest living actors to play one of your most vile characters, especially an actor who has so clearly wanted to work with you for years. DiCaprio giddily glides through the dense dialogue with aplomb, having as much fun as he can with a slave trader as rotten as his teeth.\n\n36. Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), From “Kill Bill, Vol. 1”\n\n“So I suppose it’s a little late for an apology, huh?” Known for slightly less physically demanding roles prior to this, Vivica A. Fox shows action star potential in a brutal hand-to-hand fight scene with broken glass and other sharp objects flying everywhere. While second on the Death List Five, Fox tees up some needed context and sets a killer tone for the Bride’s rampage.\n\n35. Private First Class Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl), From “Inglourious Basterds”\n\n“I’m more than just a uniform.” In what feels like a bit of a rom-com diversion in this WW2 epic, we meet the German war hero set to star in an upcoming propaganda, who becomes infatuated with the theater owner he doesn’t know is a Jewish refugee. Brühl’s boyish charm nearly forces us to forget for whom he fights, but Shosanna never loses sight of what his uniform represents. He also wields his celebrity rather problematically, unable to process the word “no” from the object of his desire. A deeply complex character, played brilliantly by Brühl.\n\n34. Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros), From “Pulp Fiction”\n\n“Blueberry pie.” Perhaps Tarantino’s sweetest character to date, Butch’s warmhearted girlfriend seems oblivious to the grave danger in which his backsliding has led them, until it seems it’s a trait that attracts her to him. His masculine exterior melts in her presence, as she stands by in their motel hideout, without knowing if her lover will even return.\n\n33. John “The Hangman” Ruth (Kurt Russell), From “The Hateful Eight”\n\n“Keeping you at a disadvantage is an advantage I intend to keep.” We could watch Kurt Russell channel John Wayne for hours. As a bounty hunter suspicious of every last soul he encounters, Russell also endures great heartbreak when he reveals a hopeless yearning for American idealism that vanished before he knew it in a kill-or-be-killed wilderness.\n\n32. Aldo “The Apache” Raine (Brad Pitt), From “Inglourious Basterds”\n\n“You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don’t ya? Practice.” A live-action cartoon character, this Tennessee mountain man never attempts to be anyone other than who he is, even when he’s undercover (“Arriverderci!”). Pitt’s accent is ridiculous, but it’s hard to imagine hearing it any other way by now. You want Aldo Raine on your team.\n\n31. Louis Gara (Robert De Niro), From “Jackie Brown”\n\n“Is she dead, yes or no?” “Pretty much.” Calling this Robert De Niro’s last great performance feels wrong considering the film came out 21 years ago, but the 2-time Oscar-winner hasn’t matched it since. Every grunt, shrug and stammer seems finely tuned by a master at work, somehow playing a stoner ex-con beautifully opposite Samuel L. Jackson and Bridget Fonda.\n\n30. Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender), From “Inglourious Basterds”\n\n“Now, about this pickle we find ourselves in. It would appear there’s only one thing left for you to do.” Like Bridget von Hammersmark’s German actress/double agent, this former film critic/British Royal Marine is Tarantino to a T. As Lt. Archie Hicox, most of the world was introduced to the suave styling of Michael Fassbender. His hubris allows him to crack under pressure during the famed tavern scene, now a monumental part of Tarantino lore.\n\n29. Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), From “Kill Bill”\n\n“I might never have liked you. Point of fact, I despise you. But that doesn’t suggest I don’t respect you.” No matter how loyal she remains to her beloved Bill, Elle will always live believing she’s his second choice in lieu of her nemesis, the Bride. Betraying her own partner in crime out of respect for her enemy remains a character highlight of “Vol. 2.” Watching Daryl Hannah and Uma Thurman tear apart Budd’s trailer is particularly delightful, squished eyeball and all.\n\n28. Django Freeman (Jamie Foxx), From “Django Unchained”\n\n“I’m just a little more used to Americans than he is.” Newly freed slave Django is recruited to hunt down outlaws before striking a deal to rescue his wife from an evil slave trader. Jamie Foxx plays this straight-faced for 2.5 hours until the final moments, when Django can finally exhale after a lifetime of carnage and tragedy. Perhaps he struggled to find the “fun” in Tarantino’s adventure.\n\n27. Bill (David Carradine), From “Kill Bill”\n\n“Do you find me sadistic?” An off-screen menace for the first half of what Tarantino dubs “the whole bloody affair,” Bill is just a feeble old man when the Bride finally tracks him down, but he’s the father to her child, suddenly complicated her mission to, well, kill Bill. The late Carradine’s unique voice and magnetism breathed a lot of depth into this bad guy.\n\n26. Beaumont Livingston (Chris Tucker), From “Jackie Brown”\n\n“I ain’t ridin’ in no trunk for no minute, man.” Beaumont got mixed up with the wrong guy, probably inadvertently. He was in Ordell Robbie’s pocket regardless when the gun dealer suspected he might rat him out to the feds. Chris Tucker (the second “Friday” vet in this movie) disappears into Tarantino’s dialogue with little to no effort, and maybe even with some rare improvisation under the director’s watch. A victim of circumstance and sheer paranoia, Tucker’s reluctant courier creates some of Tarantino’s most memorable moments still early in his career.\n\n25. Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney), From “Reservoir Dogs”\n\n“There’s two ways you can go on this job: my way or the highway.” As an ultra-serious mob boss and organizer of the diamond heist gone awry, Tierney got to channel his gangster days dating all the way back to the 1940s. His gravelly voice and old school demeanor certainly portray a man of a different time, despite surrounding himself with a gang of younger scumbags. Tarantino deftly uses Tierney’s tough guy personality for comedic purposes throughout. Mr. Orange said it best: “The Thing; m----------r looks like The Thing.”\n\n24. Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), From “Django Unchained”\n\n“Oh! And on the off chance there are any astronomy aficionados amongst you, the North Star is that one.” Christoph Waltz scored an Oscar win for playing the German dentist-turned-bounty hunter who recruits Django to hunt outlaws in the South, thanks in large part to his unparalleled charm and natural gift for Tarantino’s wordplay. A man of principle, so long as it suits his opportunism, Schultz often finds he hasn’t the stomach for even faking his way through the slave trade, like any decent human being.\n\n23. Vincent Vega (John Travolta), From “Pulp Fiction”\n\n“Oh man, I shot Marvin in the face.” Seemingly dimwitted at times, Vincent Vega is a hitman who overthinks everything. If he didn’t kill people for a living, maybe he’d write a script or a novel. Worldlier than his too-cool-for-school exterior would suggest, Vincent is full of surprises, namely his dance moves on his date at Jack Rabbit Slim’s. A role that restarted Travolta’s career and established Tarantino as a star re-maker, Vincent Vega remains synonymous with the director’s filmography.\n\n22. Pai Mei (Gordon Liu), From “Kill Bill, Vol. 2”\n\n“Do you believe you are my match?” After his brief outing as Johnny Mo in “Vol. 1,” Gordon Liu transforms into the legendary martial arts master. Stroking his long white beard, Pai Mei employs tough love via torment to train the Bride, instilling valuable lessons in combat and intestinal fortitude. Calling back to Tarantino’s favorite kung fu flicks from his cinematic upbringing, he and Liu create a wholly original character that also delivers some of the best laughs of his career.\n\n21. “Nice Guy” Eddie (Chris Penn), From “Reservoir Dogs”\n\n“Alright, first thing’s f----n’ last!” Chris Penn, who passed away in 2006, struck gold as the heir apparent and underboss of his dad’s crime business, tasked with managing the team of goons to pull off a difficult diamond heist that indeed goes quite poorly. Moving at lightning speed, Penn owns Tarantino’s slick dialogue like few others have since this debut. At his best when things fall apart, when the screws really begin to loosen and he goes full unhinged maniac because of his crew’s mishaps.\n\n20. Mr. White/Larry (Harvey Keitel), From “Reservoir Dogs”\n\n“The choice between doing ten years and taking out some stupid m----------r, ain’t no choice at all. But I ain’t no madman.” With respect to “Mean Streets” and “Bad Lieutenant,” this remains a career-defining role for Harvey Keitel, not just because he knocks the acting out of the park as the principled veteran leader of the thieving crew. But Keitel played a critical role in getting the film made, helping to discover Tarantino’s talent and all but change the movie industry forever. But character-wise, Mr. White holds up as a career criminal with little patience for amateurs on the job, especially those who could get him arrested or killed. And even for a longtime crook, he has too much faith in people.\n\n19. Dieter Hellstrom (August Diehl), From “Inglourious Basterds”\n\n“I wasn’t speaking to you, Lieutenant Munich. Or you either, Lieutenant Frankfurt. I was speaking to Captain I-don’t-know-what.” What a discovery Tarantino made in August Diehl, who has somehow only appeared in one other Hollywood production since what should have been a star-making turn as keen-eared Gestapo officer who nearly foils the Basterds’ plans singlehandedly. A gnat you can’t swat away, quite possibly the smartest guy in the room, and it’s bad news for us because he plays for the other team. Easily the MVP of the famed tavern scene.\n\n18. Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), From “Pulp Fiction”\n\n“The night of the fight, you may feel a slight sting. That’s pride f------ with you. F--- pride. Pride only hurts, it never helps.” We mostly hear about Marsellus throughout the film through scary stories told by his employees, and thanks to Ving Rhames, he lives up to the hype whenever he’s on screen. Above all, you understand he’s a dangerous man with a long memory. When hoods like Vincent Vega and Butch Coolidge fear you, you’re a bad man.\n\n17. Mr. Orange/Freddy Newandyke (Tim Roth), From “Reservoir Dogs”\n\n“They believe every f------ word ‘cause you’re super cool.” A thorough look at the perils of being an undercover cop, whether it’s engaging in extreme criminal behavior (killing innocent people), forming bonds with cop-killers or dying in the line of duty. We can’t imagine the stress Freddy Newendyke endures on the job, though he seems to dread memorizing a monologue more than he does robbing a jewelry store. Roth is perfectly cast as the good guy in disguise, a quick-learning hood waiting for his shot at busting the bad guys before it’s too late.\n\n16. Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), From “The Hateful Eight”\n\n“There ain’t no bounty on my head, bushwacker. You let me die, that’s murder!” Traveling to Red Rock as the town’s new sheriff, Mannix hitches a ride in John Ruth’s stagecoach to form half of the titular eight on their way to Minine’s Haberdashery. The son of an infamous Confederate soldier, Mannix grows the most among this film’s unlikable bunch, understanding he can’t trust people in general, let alone any of color he was raised to hate, as he soon partners with Samuel L. Jackson’s Marquis Warren to weed out the worst of them. Alabama native Walton Goggins slices through Tarantino’s words with little effort, proving a worthy member of the director’s acting troupe, were his career not winding down. Read our interview with Goggins during the release of “The Hateful Eight.”\n\n15. Stuntman Mike McKay (Kurt Russell), From “Death Proof”\n\n“Now look, I ain’t stalking you all, but I didn’t say that I wasn’t a wolf.” Kurt Russell might give a career-best performance as a predatory and impotent stunt double preying upon women in Texas and Tennessee. His plan works like a charm in the first half, tracking down a group of girls partying one Friday night before he murders them with his “death proof” movie car. It doesn’t go as well in act two, happening upon women in the same profession who survive his first attack and quickly turn the tables on the coward. Equally menacing and pathetic, Russell charms and frightens into an instant classic performance behind the wheel.\n\n14. Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba), From “Kill Bill, Vol. 1”\n\n“If on your journey, you should encounter God, God will be cut.” A worthy introduction to Sonny Chiba, especially those of us guilty of missing out on his work prior to his here as the retired master swordsmith who agrees to craft a sword just for the Bride. From Hanzo’s realization of the Bride’s purpose up to handing her the sword, this is the warmest “feeling” segment of Tarantino’s career, obviously out of respect for Chiba and the belief in his own storytelling.\n\n13. Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson), From “Jackie Brown”\n\n“My ass may be dumb, but I ain’t no dumbass.” Samuel L. Jackson at the peak of his powers, firing on all cylinders, just an unstoppable force as Ordell Robbie. Already a match made in heaven just one movie into their collaboration, Jackson and Tarantino had to team up again, and soon. Thankfully, Tarantino clearly wrote this with the actor in mind to knock it out of the park, elevating a small-time crook to what felt like a Vito Corleone crime boss as times strictly due to his own self importance. A paranoid control freak, Ordell is most entertaining when he’s on edge, which is true for much of this movie.\n\n12. Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman), From “Pulp Fiction”\n\n“This doesn’t sound like the usual mindless boring getting to know you chit chat. It sounds like you actually have something to say.” Mia Wallace merely wants to be taken out for a good time. It’s on you how that turns out. That was true for hitman Vincent Vega, whose orders to escort his boss’ wife land him in the worst predicament of his life -- and remember, he lives a life of crime where guns are frequently pointed in his direction. Uma Thurman puts Travolta in a stranglehold, dangling a carrot in her husband’s employee’s face just for the hell of it, though she’s intrigued by what he has to say when challenged to come up with decent conversation. If she’s bored, this night should do.\n\n11. Mr. Pink, From “Reservoir Dogs”\n\n“I can say I definitely didn’t do it because I know what I did or didn’t do. But I cannot definitely say that about anybody else, ‘cause I don’t definitely know.” The only one acting like a professional, at least according to him. To his credit, he’s the only guy who rightly suspects a cop has infiltrated their crew, causing the botched heist that sends their day into a bloody tailspin. Often whiny and unhinged, Steve Buscemi’s wise guy thief packs the most logic and isn’t emotionally attached to his fellow criminals and doesn’t get off on murdering innocent people, so I guess he’s the most normal. But he doesn’t tip. And that ain’t right, so forget it.\n\n10. Jackie Brown (Pam Grier), From “Jackie Brown”\n\n“I put a cherry on top. Booh-yah! What the f--- did Ordell ever do for us, huh?” Tarantino admittedly obsessed over Pam Grier’s career, so the first chance he got, he wrote a movie to help revive and share her talent for those less acquainted. As a middle-aged flight attendant for a rinky-dink airline, she makes ends meet smuggling money from Mexico into the U.S. for gun-runner Ordell Robbie. Faced with her own mortality and diminishing options for the future, she decides to take charge of an impossible situation and rip off Ordell to make a better life for herself, putting her life at risk. Decades removed from “Coffy” and “Foxy Brown,” Grier picks up right where she left off, reinforcing her status as a formidable leading lady.\n\n9. O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), From “Kill Bill, Vol. 1”\n\n“That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword.” First on the bride’s death list, this former Deadly Viper assassin with a complicated and tragic past becomes the leader of the Japanese Yakuza after a “Shakespearean in magnitude” power struggle, creating a difficult path for the Bride’s pursuit. Surrounded by an army of bodyguards, she’s also plenty capable of defending herself, as we learn in the electrifying anime sequence covering O-Ren’s backstory. With Bill looming towards the latter half, Lucy Liu proves a perfectly capable main villain in part one.\n\n8. Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent), From “Inglourious Basterds”\n\n“Because, Marcel, my sweet, we’re going to make a film. Just for the Nazis.” Tarantino once again scored with a virtual unknown in Laurent, as a survivor jaded by war and tragedy, hell-bent on vengeance when the opportunity presents itself at her doorstep. Shosanna’s greatest strength is she never questions herself or her plan along the way, with a clear focus on whom she’s avenging.\n\n7. Max Cherry (Robert Forster), From “Jackie Brown”\n\n“I’m 56-years-old. I can’t blame anybody for anything I do.” The pragmatic bail bondsman who falls hard for Jackie Brown (and The Delfonics), and maybe the most likable of all of Tarantino’s characters. Forster scored an Oscar nomination and a second wind as an actor after, like many others before and after, Tarantino longtime admiration influenced his casting. They did something next to impossible in the larger-than-life Tarantino universe in crafting a character who feels like an actual human being you’ve known your whole life.\n\n6. Mr. Blonde / Vic Vega (Michael Madsen), From “Reservoir Dogs”\n\n“Are you gonna bark all day little doggie? Or are you gonna bite? One of Tarantino’s greatest gifts as a storyteller is managing to unsettle the audience with moments we don’t even see, Vic Vega’s vicious exploits chief among them, even when they’re happening in real time in the same room we’re watching. A longtime friend of Joe and Eddie Cabot, having just served a 4-year prison sentence to protect them, the mysterious Mr. Blonde jumps back into his life of crime with a literal bang, murdering multiple people during their robbery before brutally torturing a police officer he took hostage in the melee, much to the surprise and disdain of his “co-workers.” The most unnerving thing about Mr. Blonde is his calm demeanor whether he is or isn’t hurting people. He seems like a mostly normal guy, befuddling Mr. White and Mr. Pink who can’t believe he’s the same guy who shot up the store when they rendezvous at the warehouse. The man even dances and quips as he slices off the cop’s ear and attempts to burn him alive. But Michael Madsen’s mellow facade through it all enhances the enigmatic Mr. Blonde and reinforces why Tarantino wanted to continue working with him for the rest of their careers.\n\n5. Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), From “Django Unchained”\n\n“And THAT will be the story of you, Django!” As Calvin Candie’s longtime loyal “house slave,” Jackson fashioned perhaps his and Tarantino’s most complex character to date. Crotchety and determined to further marginalize Django’s newfound freedom, Stephen challenges the perceived power dynamics of a Southern plantation home in the 19th century, holding significant influence over his would-be master Calvin, someone he raised and like still sees as a little boy he can easily persuade to preserve his own way of life in an era so difficult and deadly for black men and women. Jackson has called Stephen the power behind the throne and even “the Dick Cheney of Candyland.” One might have assumed a 60-something Jackson had long since passed his acting prime, but he brings as much energy, wit and intensity to Stephen has he ever has in his career.\n\n4. Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis), From “Pulp Fiction”\n\n“That’s how you’re gonna beat ‘em, Butch. They keep underestimating you.” In the six years between his breakout role in “Die Hard” and his movie-stealing work in “Pulp Fiction,” Bruce Willis made more than a dozen movies capitalizing on his newfound movie stardom but none rekindled that star-making charisma the way his work as boxer on the run Butch Coolidge did. Along with the money he won betting on himself to spite mob boss Marsellus Wallace, Willis runs off with the movie itself in its most exhilarating chapter “The Gold Watch,” where the stakes can’t get any higher as Butch crashes into every imaginable (and unimaginable) obstacle in an effort to flee L.A. and start a new life with his girlfriend Fabienne. Butch has no time to think or breathe, let alone absorb the fact that he just killed a man in the boxing ring. Willis might phone in much of his work in 2019, but he essentially earned that right as Butch 25 years ago.\n\n3. Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), From “Pulp Fiction”\n\n“I want you to go in that bag, and find my wallet.” “Which one is it?” “It’s the one that says Bad M----------r.” While Vincent Vega overthinks the small stuff, Jules is the tortured philosopher between the unexpectedly substantive hitmen each faced with existential dilemmas, while one acknowledges it and the other pretends not to care. Jules chose a career of killing people, but things change when the gun turns back on you. Jules feels as they he was spared by God, sending him find his moment of clarity that should help him better understand his path as a man rather than a killer. “The truth is you’re the weak. And I’m the tyranny of evil men,” he tells Tim Roth in the film’s final scene, reflecting on his role in the grander scheme moving forward. “But I’m tryin’, Ringo. I’m tryin’ real hard to be the shepherd.”\n\n2. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), From “Inglourious Basterds”\n\n“There’s so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide. However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me. Because I’m aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.” A fitting quote considering the shrewd maneuvering the S.S. colonel employs to escape the gallows for his own atrocities when he senses the end is near for his Nazi party. For all of Hans Landa’s brilliance as a detective during the Holocaust, we see even more cowardice in a man whose talents have been utilized for evil his American opponents won’t soon let him or the outside world forget. Tarantino found a diamond in the rough in Christoph Waltz, directing him to a pair of Oscars, his first earned as the savvy “Jew Hunter,” remaining multiple steps ahead of his enemies as the war draws to a close, if he can help it. Masked by keen intellect and delectable charm is a rotten apple, Landa toys with us as he does his unsuspecting prey in scenes we’ll watch forever, and few could have pulled it off as Waltz does for her new pal Tarantino.\n\n1. The Bride (Uma Thurman), From “Kill Bill”"
