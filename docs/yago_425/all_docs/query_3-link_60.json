        "text": "For a long time, Quentin Tarantino has spoken of his plan to walk away from filmmaking on his own terms—after making ten features, and by the age of sixty—while he still has plenty of vigor to devote to other kinds of work. He just reached sixty, and, having made his first nine films (he lumps the two “Kill Bill” installments together as one), he’s already at work on the tenth and, presumably, last, which is tentatively titled “The Movie Critic.” The movie-centric subject suggests a follow-up to his previous film, “Once Upon a Time . . . in Hollywood”; he says that it will be set in 1977, but denied rumors that it would be about the longtime New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael. (He says that the critic will be male.)\n\nIf Tarantino follows through on his planned exit from directing films, he’ll join élite company; it’s hard to think of notable directors who’ve preceded Tarantino in ending their careers voluntarily. Perhaps the greatest to have done so is Douglas Sirk, the German filmmaker, born in 1897, who immigrated to the United States; signed his first Hollywood contract, in 1942; and made his name there, in the nineteen-fifties, with melodramas such as “All That Heaven Allows,” “Written on the Wind,” and the remake of “Imitation of Life.” At the height of his success, in 1959, he ended his studio contract and returned to Europe, simply because, he said, he “had had enough” of Hollywood. It’s far more common for great directors to have their careers truncated by commercial ostracism, to be put out to pasture far too early because their movies were expensive and their box-office returns deemed inadequate—that cohort includes Buster Keaton, D. W. Griffith, Erich von Stroheim, Orson Welles, and Elaine May. (Josef von Sternberg’s withdrawal from Hollywood, in the early nineteen-fifties, seems to have been a case of mutual exasperation.) Also, some of the great Black directors who’ve made illustrious starts have often run up against an impenetrable wall of white producers blocking their subsequent movies. Such first-rate filmmakers as Christopher St. John, Wendell B. Harris, Jr., and Julie Dash have been unable to make more than one dramatic feature.\n\nThe most noteworthy counterpart to Tarantino’s announcement is the ballyhooed retirement of Steven Soderbergh, who, in 2011, announced that he was leaving Hollywood, and, in 2013, when he actually left, explained that he could no longer endure studio interference in his work. Like Sirk, he was fed up with the industry—but unlike Sirk, whose movie career was almost entirely bound up with big studios in Germany and the U.S., Soderbergh began as an independent filmmaker and thereby knew a degree of artistic freedom that not only loomed as an ideal but remained an easily accessible possibility—all the more so inasmuch as Soderbergh is also an artisanal, hands-on filmmaker who, since 2000, has been the director of photography on all his fiction features and, from the start of his career, in 1989, the editor of most. All Soderbergh needed to do was find an alternative movie economy, in order to move ahead as a director by going back as an independent (of sorts), and he found it—with television and streaming services. Soon after retiring from Hollywood, he started work on a TV series (in the event, “The Knick”); when he made “Unsane” (shot on an iPhone) and “Logan Lucky,” he produced them on his own; and his features “High Flying Bird” (also an iPhone movie) and “Kimi” were backed by Netflix and HBO Max, respectively. Yet his prolific retirement is also, in its essence, a sort of failure: at the same time as he declared his desperation to be free of studio strictures, he also expressed the desire to search for a new aesthetic essence of movies, and spoke, in 2013, of his frustration with “the tyranny of narrative.” He said, “I’m convinced there’s a new grammar out there somewhere,” and added, “If I’m going to solve this issue, it means annihilating everything that came before and starting from scratch. That means I have to go away, and I don’t know how long it’s going to take.” In an odd way, his extensive career since then, which has included some excellent films, hasn’t in any way innovated as profoundly as he intended. He continued his search for the new grammar but, in fact, didn’t jettison everything he knew—he has indeed moved ahead, incrementally, but hasn’t gone back to zero to start over.\n\nTarantino, too, started as an independent (like Soderbergh, a Hollywood independent, with a million-dollar budget and Hollywood actors)—but then he went big and has never come down to earth. He’s not a hands-on filmmaker; he has made films that are increasingly elaborate and grandiose. The scale of his projects inflects his plans for retirement. As early as 2009, when he was forty-six, he announced, “I intend to quit at sixty. . . . I’m going to write novels and write cinema literature, and stuff like that.” He’s already written one novel (“Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” based on his film) and one book of “cinema literature,” the remarkable, riffy “Cinema Speculation.” Meanwhile, he has also left the door open to directing a TV series, but he has expressed the view that streaming is inimical to the kind of movies that he wants to make—and he has even expressed doubts about his final movie if he’d have to make it for a streaming service rather than for theatrical release.\n\nAbove all, Tarantino’s plan is rooted far less deeply in his view of the business than in his view of himself. He has long fretted that “most directors’ last films are fucking lousy,” and has even suggested that he could imagine going out with “Once Upon a Time,” and that, in a way, he’s already done: “If you think about the idea of all the movies telling one story and each film is like a train boxcar connected to each other, this one would sort of be the big showstopping climax of it all. . . . And I could imagine that the 10th one would be a little more epilogue-y.”\n\nThe differing approaches that Soderbergh and Tarantino take to the very notion of cinema retirement set up an artistic dichotomy that both puts their individual careers into an illuminating perspective and reflects two defining ideals of the art of movies. This dichotomy is reminiscent of the one suggested by another pair of great Hollywood artists from another generation, Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks. Hitchcock made cinematic cathedrals—mighty freestanding spectacles of pomp and gaud, in which ordinary people were thrust into extraordinary circumstances. Hawks, with ironic understatement, filmed the plain essentials of people at work and showed extraordinary character emerging in ordinary circumstances."
