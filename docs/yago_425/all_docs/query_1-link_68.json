        "text": "If he actually took a Batman story and adapted it faithfully i think he would do a good job. He is able to portray criminals with realistic reactions, charteristics, while at the same time giving them the staple movie conventions.\n\nIn much the same way he could do costumed crooks and heroes as having the conventions, whilst giving them some realistic actions, I think it would be very interesting to see what he would do with them.\n\nHe's said in an interview that if he were to do a superhero film(as people were always asking him 'why don't you do the Flash or something?') he wouldn't do an established character but invent his own, so's he wouldn't have to deal with fans getting on his case, he could invent his own rules.\n\nIt was an interview on UK tv I saw this, maybe on the culture show.\n\n-What does the Joker look like?\n\n--What?\n\n-What country you from?\n\n--: What?\n\n-What ain't no country I ever heard of! They speak English in What?\n\n--: What?\n\n-ENGLISH, MOTHER****ER! DO-YOU-SPEAK-IT?\n\n--Yes!\n\n-Then you know what I'm saying!\n\n--Yes!\n\n-Describe what the Joker looks like!\n\n--What, I-?\n\n[pointing his gun] Say what again. SAY WHAT AGAIN. I dare you, I double dare you, mother****er. Say what one more goddamn time.\n\n--: He's p-p-ale white...\n\n-Go on.\n\n--He's got a big smile...\n\n-Does he look like a *****?\n\n--What?\n\n[Jules shoots Brett in shoulder]\n\n-DOES HE LOOK LIKE A *****?\n\n--No!\n\n-Then why you try to **** him like a *****, Brett?\n\n-- I didn't.\n\n-Yes you did. Yes you did, Brett. You tried to **** him. And Mr J don't like to be ****ed by anybody, except Harley Quinn.\n\nThat way?"
