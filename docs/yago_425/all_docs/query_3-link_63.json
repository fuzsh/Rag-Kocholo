        "text": "Quentin Tarantino has named seven “unassailable” movies.\n\nThe director appeared on an October episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live to promote his newly released book Cinema Speculation.\n\nIn his book – which is described as part-memoir, part-Hollywood history, and part-film theory – Tarantino writes that there are “very few perfect movies” but that Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of them.\n\nThe slasher film directed by Tobe Hooper has become a cult classic since its release in 1974.\n\nAsked by host Jimmy Kimmel what other films he considers to be “perfect”, Tarantino replied: “Well, there’s not many of them – that just bemoans that the film art form is hard.”\n\n“And look, when you say perfect movies you’re talking about any individual person’s aesthetic but even trying to account for all aesthetics… perfect movies kind of crosses all aesthetics to one degree or another. It might not be your cup of tea but there’s nothing you can say to bring it down.”\n\nThe Oscar winner went on to name five other films he believes to fit into that category:\n\nJaws (1975)\n\nThe Exorcist (1973)\n\nAnnie Hall (1977)\n\n“Some people could say Young Frankenstein, which I can understand” (1974)\n\nBack to the Future (1985)\n\nTarantino also named Sam Peckinpah’s 1969 western The Wild Bunch as a possible contender, before taking back the suggestion.\n\n“I could say The Wild Bunch fits into that – and that’s not even a perfect movie. Its imperfections are part of its glory so let me take The Wild Bunch out,” he said. “That’s kind of the point, though. Something that’s so unassailable.”\n\nElsewhere during the interview, Tarantino denied Kanye West’s recent claims that he stole the idea for Django Unchained from him."
