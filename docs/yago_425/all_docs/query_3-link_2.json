        "text": "Django Unchained\n\nOne of the great strengths of Quentin Tarantino's films is the way his love of cinema permeates every frame. From subtle, throw-away lines and in-jokes to more obvious nods (such as the \"old fashioned\" Columbia logo at the beginning or the '70s-sty...\n\nFour Rooms\n\nFour Rooms, a four-segment anthology directed by independent film darlings Allison Anders, Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino, has to be one of 1995's major disappointments. Perhaps it's the format itself -- twenty minutes...\n\nGrindhouse\n\nThe term \"grindhouse\" refers to a specific type of '60s and '70s exploitation film: the sex-and-gore soaked fare that played in run-down urban cinemas and drive-in theaters. With their consistently poor production values and often horrifically bad ...\n\nHateful Eight, The\n\nThe credits for The Hateful Eight proudly proclaim this to be the “Eighth Film” from writer/director Quentin Tarantino. Since catching the movie world unawares with his powerhouse debut, Reservoir Dogs, some 23 years ago, he has worked on...\n\nInglourious Basterds\n\nWith Inglourious Basterds, Quentin Tarantino has made his best movie since Pulp Fiction. He has also made what could arguably be considered the most audacious World War II movie of all-time. If you think there are rules for this sort of motion pi...\n\nJackie Brown\n\nIt has been three long years since Quentin Tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the Cannes Film Festival's Palme D'Or, a $100 million-plus box office gross, and an Oscar nomination – all for his sophomore outing, Pulp Fiction. Sinc...\n\nKill Bill (Volume 1)\n\nQuentin Tarantino fans have been waiting six long years for the release of the director's follow-up to Jackie Brown. So what do they get for their patience? An incomplete movie, artlessly cleft in the middle. Cinema interruptus. A film whose ed...\n\nKill Bill (Volume 2)\n\nTwo things are readily apparent about Kill Bill Volume 2. First, unlike its predecessor, this is a complete movie. It stands on its own. It is possible to see and enjoy Volume 2 in a way that was not true of Volume 1. Viewed in retrospect, the ...\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood, the “ninth film from Quentin Tarantino,” might be too long and a little self-indulgent. But it’s also chock-full of brilliant moments, great performances, and a sense of ’60s Hollywood infused with a mix ...\n\nPulp Fiction\n\nPulp (pulp) n. 1. A soft, moist, shapeless mass of matter. 2. A book containing lurid subject matter, and being characteristically printed on rough, unfinished paper. \"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of..."
