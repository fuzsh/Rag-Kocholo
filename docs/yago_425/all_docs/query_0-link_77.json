        "text": "Quentin Tarantino\n\nFILM MAKER QUENTIN TARANTINO\n\nHONORED WITH\n\nSTAR ON THE HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME\n\nWatch the complete star ceremony as Quentin Tarantino unveils star on Walk of Fame below.\n\nThe Hollywood Chamber of Commerce honored Quentin Tarantino with the 2,569th star today, Monday, December 21, 2015. The star in the category of Motion Pictures was dedicated in front of the TCL Chinese Theatre at 6927 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nHelping emcee and Hollywood Chamber President/CEO Leron Gubler to unveil the star were Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nQuentin Tarantino was born in Knoxville, Tennessee and began his film career as a video store clerk and eventually broke into the motion picture business when he sold the screenplays for “Natural Born Killers” and “True Romance”.\n\nWith his vibrant imagination and dedication to richly layered storytelling Quentin Tarantino (Writer/Director) has established himself as one of the most celebrated filmmakers of his generation.\n\nThe Weinstein Company will release Tarantino's “The Hateful Eight”, starring Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Demian Bichir, and Bruce Dern in glorious 70mm on Christmas Day with a nationwide theatrical digital release on December 31, 2015. In “The Hateful Eight”, six or eight or ten years after the end of the Civil War, a band of strangers who seek refuge from a blizzard in a mountainside stopover and discover that hidden allegiances and dangerous motives threaten their survival.\n\nTarantino won his second Oscar® for Best Screenplay for “Django Unchained”, starring Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio, Christoph Waltz (in his second Academy Award®-winning role), Samuel L. Jackson, Kerry Washington, and Walton Goggins. Set in the Antebellum South, “Django Unchained” chronicles a freed slave’s search for his long-lost wife “Django Unchained” was nominated for five Golden Globe Awards (with wins for Waltz and Tarantino for Best Screenplay), five BAFTAS (again, with wins for Tarantino and Waltz and editor Fred Raskin), and five Academy Awards®, including Best Picture. The film grossed over $425 million worldwide.\n\n“Inglourious Basterds”, Tarantino’s World War II epic, assembled a renowned international cast, including Brad Pitt, Diane Kruger, Michael Fassbender, Melanie Laurent, Til Schweiger, Mike Myers, and Christoph Waltz, who won an Academy Award® for his portrayal of Colonel Hans Landa. First shown in competition at the Cannes Film Festival, “Inglourious Basterds” was a critical and box office sensation, garnering numerous awards, including six BAFTA nominations, four Golden Globe nominations and eight Academy Award® nominations, including Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Achievement in Directing.\n\nPrior to “Inglourious Basterds”, Tarantino thrilled audiences with “Death Proof”, starring Kurt Russell and Zoë Bell. Paired domestically with Robert Rodriguez’s “Planet Terror” on a double bill called “Grindhouse”, “Death Proof” was shown in competition at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nIn Tarantino’s “Kill Bill Vol. 1” and “Kill Bill Vol. 2”, Uma Thurman, as The Bride, enacted a “roaring rampage of revenge” on her former lover and boss, played by David Carradine. Shot in China, Japan, the United States, and Mexico, the film co-starred Lucy Liu, Daryl Hannah, Vivica A. Fox and Michael Madsen as Carradine’s team of assassins. Tarantino wrote and directed “Jackie Brown”, a crime caper loosely based on Elmore Leonard’s novel Rum Punch, starring Pam Grier, Robert Forster, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert De Niro, Bridget Fonda and Michael Keaton. Grier garnered both Golden Globe and SAG Award nominations for her performance in the title role. Forster was nominated for an Academy Award® for Best Supporting Actor, and Jackson won the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the Berlin International Film Festival for his performance as Ordell Robbie.\n\nTarantino co-wrote, directed and starred in “Pulp Fiction”, which won numerous critics’ awards, a Golden Globe and Academy Award® for Best Screenplay, and the Palme D’Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival. (Tarantino made a return visit to Cannes ten years later to take on the prestigious role of jury president.) The time-bending crime drama stars John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer and Christopher Walken.\n\nTarantino wrote, directed and starred in “Reservoir Dogs”, which made an auspicious debut at the Sundance Film Festival and marked the beginning of Tarantino’s career as a filmmaker. “Reservoir Dogs” co-stars Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Steve Buscemi and Harvey Keitel.\n\nFollowing the success of “Reservoir Dogs”, the screenplays that Tarantino wrote during his tenure as a video store clerk became hot properties: Tony Scott directed Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette in “True Romance”, and Robert Rodriguez directed George Clooney and Salma Hayek in “From Dusk Till Dawn”. In addition to their collaborations “From Dusk Till Dawn” and “Grindhouse”, Tarantino also joined Rodriguez as a special guest director on his hit Sin City.\n\nTarantino joined Rodriguez, Allison Anders and Alexandre Rockwell by directing, writing and executive producing a segment of the omnibus feature “Four Rooms”. For television, Tarantino directed the season five finale of “CSI.” The episode, titled “Grave Danger” garnered Tarantino an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series. Tarantino made his television directorial debut in 1995 with an episode of the long-running drama “ER.”\n\nTarantino’s commitment to film preservation is best exemplified by this purchase and refurbishment of the New Beverly Cinema located in Los Angeles. Regarded as an institution among cinephiles the New Beverly showcases 35mm prints of classic films on nightly double features curated by Tarantino. He is also an ardent supporter of The Sundance Institute, most recently serving as a creative advisor for the 2014 January Screenwriters Lab and recently began working with The Make-A-Wish Foundation.\n\n★★★\n\nALL PRESS MUST RSVP TO ANA MARTINEZ AT (323) 468-1376 OR [email protected]\n\nABOUT THE HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME www.WalkOfFame.com\n\nThe Hollywood Walk of Fame is an internationally-recognized Hollywood icon.
