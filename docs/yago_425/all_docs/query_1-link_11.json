The guy demonstrates again and again that he lives and breathes movies.  One of my own fondest moviegoing experiences was in 1992 or 1993 when (drop, names, drop!) QT took Julia Sweeney, Kathy Griffin and a few others (David Cross? Janeane Garofalo? Phil LaMarr? Margaret Cho? I can't remember who all was there that day...) and me to see Jackie Chan in \"Supercop\" (aka \"Police Story 3\") at the Laemmle in Santa Monica. It was my first Jackie Chan movie and I was blown away (as any Buster Keaton devotee would be). I'm forever grateful -- and happy to see that movie on his list, along with some of my personal faves, including \"Boogie Nights,\" \"Dazed and Confused,\" \"Fight Club,\" \"The Insider,\" \"Shaun of the Dead,\" \"Memories of Murder,\" \"The Host,\" \"Unbreakable\" and... you just have to see him deliver it himself.\r\n\r\nFull list after the jump...",
