        "text": "I think the opening of INGLORIOUS BASTERDS (sp. inc) was the best thing put to film in the last fifty years… (dating back to GF I&II). I can watch this little “short film” over and over. Suspense in action, it’s like an elastic band being pulled from either end…. Just ready to snap, until—\n\nScene over.\n\nA masterpiece!\n\nIB is my favourite movie EVER and the first scene is my favourite scene. Pure perfection.\n\n@goldenswissroyale and @peter\n\nThat first scene is outstanding in every . possible . regard! Acting, directing, editing, writing, ... I can play it over and over again and never be bored. I recall thinking when I first saw the movie, almost instantly, that this scene drew a line between 'young' QT and mature QT. I recall thinking that master-photographer Stanley Kubrick would have admired this scene (and probably the full film too.)\n\nAnother part of IB that I find outstanding is the tavern scene. This was the first time that I took notice of one Michael Fassbender, who would soon impress me as Magneto in First Class. Like Waltz in the opening scene of the film, August Diehl plays such a charming yet threatening presence that I'm never sure whether I should like or hate the man. QT is definitely in control of his words, his pacing, and his every impulse as a filmmaker.\n\nDespite all the above, I still think that PF is my favorite QT film. Call it a generational thing. That film left such an impression on my teenage self when it was released that I'll probably forever worship it as a cult experience.\n\nBut the best QT film, IMO, is JB. It didn't start out that way; I was 16 when it came out and at 16, one doesn't contemplate life the way JB does. But with the passing of time, I must admit, I find myself much more emotionally involved in the characters of Pam Grier and Robert Forster. Every time I revisit JB, I am more invested in the film than the time before. I admire the choice of music, the acting, the celebration of the \"forgotten\" blaxploitation genre, ...\n\nTH8 is another favorite of mine. I simply love the mystery and how it plays out as one big theatre play. I'm also very fond of Django Unchained. All in all, I have a great fondness for everything QT has done so far as a director. I guess my least favorite film of his -- though I still wouldn't call the film \"bad\" -- is DP, simply because it has so little going on.\n\nAnd the film's apparently been fully cast but can't be announced due to the strikes. That's exciting. I do hope he has a mini Pulp Fiction reunion in some respects, and I hope Samuel L. Jackson gets a proper role for Tarantino's final film.\n\nI could see SLJ getting a big role in the movie. Apparently, he gets referenced as a young actor that Rick Dalton worked with in his upcoming book: The Films of Rick Dalton.\n\nhttps://theplaylist.net/quentin-tarantino-once-upon-a-time-rick-dalton-spinoff-book-true-romance-20220104/\n\nI almost forgot about that book. Can't wait to check it out. Finally read OUATIH and Tarantino's Cinema Speculation recently and loved them both.\n\nI can't wait either. I'm a bit surprised that we haven't heard more about it. In the meantime, we have this to look forward to next year.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Quentin-Tarantino-Amazing-Améziane/dp/1787740641/ref=sr_1_4?crid=349Q8S7EUM3AT&amp;keywords=quentin+tarantino&amp;qid=1696130199&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=quentin+t,stripbooks,3087&amp;sr=1-4\n\nAt the risk of sounding controversial, if QT wanted to call OUATIH as his last movie, I'd be OK with it. He goes out on a high note like he wants, and there are enough movies that are great with his name attached. I'd love to see him keep writing books, as writing is his greatest strength. I'm still hoping for the prequel Double V Vega get adapted into a book or graphic novel. There's already a built in audience. Here's to hoping, as he did a sequel, Django/Zorro. A lot of his characters could have continuation stories.\n\nI'll be there day one for any more books he decides to do. I do hope we get some more original stories in book format from him after he's done directing too.\n\nMe too. It would be interesting to have QT to write a short story novel. His other possible projects I'd like to see are him trying a futuristic science fiction story, as it's out of his usual zone. I'd also like to see him write novelizations of Reservoir Dogs and True Romance, as I wish he would go back to crime dramas/dark comedy. Westerns are getting a bit repetitive with him. While QT will retire as a film director, he can have success with stage adaptations of his movies. Having him direct RD, TH8 and OUATIH can make him successful across all forms of media. Other characters (other than the Vega Bros) I would like to see are Kill Bill Volume 3 and Django in White Hell. These would be great graphic novels, considering QT's love of comics. On a sad note, we have to remember that QT loves to talk A LOT about possible projects.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino's_unrealized_projects"
