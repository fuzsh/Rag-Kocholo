        "text": "Spoiler alert: these reviews reveal plot twists.\n\nLos Angeles, 1969… An actor with fading confidence attempts to rebuild his career… His stuntman friend struggles to find work… Actress Sharon Tate is enjoying her rise to stardom… And the followers of cult leader Charles Manson are planning murder…\n\nWhat does QT do? Writing and directing. While declining to take an on-screen acting role – something he hasn’t done since his awful cameo in Django Unchained – Quentin Tarantino’s voice is heard twice: as a commercials director and the narrator of a fictional TV show called Bounty Law.\n\nNotable characters:\n\n* Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a 40-something actor living off his previous earnings in a house in the Hollywood hills. Years earlier he starred in a TV Western called Bounty Law, but never made the jump to being a movie star. He’s especially prickly about the role of Hilts in The Great Escape going to Steve McQueen (we see an imagined clip from that 1963 classic, with Rick/Leo replacing Hilts/McQueen via CGI). Rick now buddies around town with Cliff, his long-time stuntman-cum-PA, but is disheartened by the lack of starring roles on offer and is resorting to playing guest heavies in TV shows. After fluffing his lines and suffering a panic attack while playing the bad guy in the pilot episode of Western series Lancer, Rick has something of an epiphany: he pulls himself together and gives a performance that impresses his co-stars and the director (the latter calls him an ‘evil, sexy Hamlet’). His equilibrium back, Rick then accepts that his career options are limited and agrees to go to Italy to make a Spaghetti Western called Nebraska Jim. The trip goes well – Rick stars in two other films as well – but he then has to tell Cliff that, now he’s married an Italian actress, he can no longer afford to employ him. Back in the States, the two men commemorate the end of their arrangement with a few drinks – and then, late at night, Rick’s home is invaded by a group of kids intent on murder… DiCaprio is truly fantastic as Rick. Smartly trading on his own real-life image as a pretty-boy actor now in middle age (though he’s never suffered the kind of career slump that’s dogging Rick), the star is always on the edge of paranoia, self-loathing and nerves. He generates real empathy as we follow his character through what is essentially a midlife crisis – Rick flip-flops between comedy and tragedy, and DiCaprio is always in control.\n\n* Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) is ostensibly Rick’s stunt double, but their relationship has evolved into a codependency. Cliff finds it hard to get industry jobs due to rumours that he murdered his wife, so he now also works as Rick’s personal assistant, driver and general gofer. The two men are good pals and rely on each other – it’s almost a platonic version of a married couple. But while Rick has a nice, big house with a swimming pool and great views across LA, Cliff lives in a battered old caravan with his obedient pitbull Brandy. One day, while carrying out errands for Rick, Cliff picks up a young hitchhiker called Pussycat and learns that she and her cultish friends live at an old ranch out of town. The ringleader is not keen on Cliff being there, but he insists on speaking to the ranch’s owner, George, who he knows from when the property was used for making movies. Months later, Cliff encounters some of the cult again when three members break into Rick’s house – they plan to murder the TV star, who they see as a symbol of violence in modern culture. Cliff, who is stoned on an acid-cigarette by now, easily beats them all up with the help of a savage Brandy… The character of Cliff is based on several movie figures of the era, including actor Robert Blake – a one-time friend of Tarantino’s – who was suspected of killing his wife, and a stuntman who was hired specifically to intimidate Bruce Lee on a film set. Another inspiration was Kurt Russell. While making his 2007 film Death Proof, Quentin has got to know Russell’s long-time stuntman, John Casino, which kicked off the idea of a friendship between a star and his double. Brad Pitt won an Oscar for his performance as Cliff and it’s no surprise – his easy-going yet steely-eyed charisma is peppered with laconic comic timing and a middle-aged confidence. He’s incredibly watchable. He also looks pretty good with his shirt off. (Tom Cruise was an early possibility for the role, though surely would have lacked Pitt’s self-awareness.)\n\n* Marvin Schwarz (Al Pacino) is an ingratiating film producer who wants Rick to make Italian Westerns in Europe. Trying to butter him up, Marvin sycophantically raves about Rick’s old hits, which he screened in his private cinema the night before – ‘Thirty-five-millimetre prints of Tanner and The 14 Fists of McClusky’ – but Rick is skeptical about the idea of going abroad (‘Sergio who?’). The role of Marvin was written specifically for Pacino.\n\n* Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) is a young actress on the rise in Hollywood, who moves into the property next door to Rick’s with her husband, the hip movie director Roman Polanski. Sharon is a sunshine personality, liked by everyone she meets, and someone who enjoys life. She parties, listens to music, hangs around with friends. As 1969 progresses, she also becomes pregnant… Of course, in reality, Tate, her friends Jay Sebring, Wojciech Frykowski and Abigail Folger and an 18-year-old visitor called Steven Parent were murdered on 8 August 1969 by followers of Charles Manson who wished for notoriety. When Tarantino began work on Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, rumours circulated that he was telling Sharon’s story – or maybe the Manson Family’s – but he quickly said that those events would instead be a backdrop to a fictional tale. The finished movie is told from a relentlessly *male* point of view, and Sharon Tate acts as more of an ‘ideal’ than a character; a symbol of the purity and joy that is at risk as the hedonistic 1960s give away to a more cynical era of violence. Many critics have lamented how little agency and dialogue Sharon has (a representation issue not helped by another high-profile film of 2019, Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman, which gave experienced actress Anna Paquin a total of *seven words* to say). But in the context of this film, less is more – and Margot Robbie is stunningly luminescent in the role, giving a memorable, charming performance even with limited screentime.\n\n* Pussycat (Margaret Qualley) is the hippie hitchhiker who Cliff picks up. She’s sexually forward (‘Want me to suck your cock while driving?’) but Cliff resists, recognising just how young she is – though he does accept the offer of an acid-dipped cigarette and pockets it for later. Pussycat is a member of the religious cult who have taken over the Spahn Ranch outside Los Angeles. As well as living in a strict commune, they provide horseback rides for tourists… Interestingly, Tarantino has mooted the possibility that he was present at Spahn Ranch in the year this film is set. ‘I actually went horseback riding at six years old [he was born in 1963] with my mom and dad. I don’t know if we went to Spahn Ranch. I like to think that we did. We probably went to Griffith Park, but I like to think that we went to Spahn Ranch.’\n\n* Squeaky (Dakota Fanning) is the grumpy, bossy leader at the ranch. She and her fellow acolytes spend their days lazing around in front of the TV, but her guard is up when Pussycat brings a skeptical and suspicious Cliff back. Jennifer Lawrence was considered for the role but the dates didn’t work out. The character is a fictionalised take on Lynette ‘Squeaky’ Fromme, who as well as being a member of the Manson Family, tried to murder President Gerald Ford in 1975. She was imprisoned for the attempt until 2009.\n\n* The Spahn Ranch is owned by George Spahn (Bruce Dern), who is now 80 and bedridden and blind. The Manson Family are taking advantage of him, in order to live on the ranch, and he is supplicated via sexual favours from Squeaky. (In reality, Spahn (1889-1974) gave Squeaky her nickname based on a sound she made when touched.) Burt Reynolds was originally cast in the role, but died very soon before filming. His presence can still be detected in the finished movie, though, in two ways: it was Reynolds’s suggestion that someone tell Cliff, ‘You’re pretty for a stunt guy’, while the role Rick Dalton plays in an episode of the 1960s TV drama The F.B.I. was – in reality – played by Burt.\n\n* Bruce Lee (Mike Moh) features in a set-piece flashback scene that takes place in the car park of the studio where he is filming his TV show The Green Hornet. Stuntman Cliff scoffs at Lee’s hubris and arrogance, leading to a best-of-three fight between the men. The scene is cutely shot and staged, especially a lengthy ‘oner’ leading up to the first fall, and enjoyably builds Cliff’s character as a man who’s cool under pressure… The scene in Once Upon a Time has been heavily criticised by some as being disrespectful to an Asian icon of cinema. In the 1960s, actor and martial-arts star Lee (1940-1973) was carving out a career on American television – Cliff sarcastically calls him Kato, his character in The Green Hornet – and he is undoubtedly the butt of the joke here. But Tarantino has defended the sequence on three levels. Firstly, the point is that Cliff *tricks* Lee by initially taking a dive. He doesn’t put up any resistance in the first challenge of the two-out-of-three bout, therefore forcing Lee to reveal his best move. Secondly, the real Bruce Lee did have a reputation for hating and antagonising American stuntmen. And thirdly, in Tarantino’s imagining – which is further embellished in his novelisation of the movie – Cliff is actually a *killer*. Bruce Lee, for all his ability, was an actor. He just pretended to be tough.\n\n* Sheriff Hackett (Michael Madsen) is a character seen in a clip from an episode of Bounty Law. Both this character and Madsen’s role in The Hateful Eight were inspired by Maverick star Peter Breck; hence the same neckerchief look.\n\n* Among the other real-world people being dramatised are Sharon Tate’s friends Joanna Pettet (Rumer Willis), Jay Sebring (Emile Hirsch) and Abigail Folger (Samantha Robinson); Hollywood heavyweight Steve McQueen (Damian Lewis); actress and singer Connie Stevens (Dreama Walker); Mama and the Papas members Michelle Phillips (Rebecca Rittenhouse) and Mama Cass (Rachel Redleaf); the real stars of Lancer, James Stacy (Timothy Olyphant) and Wayne Maunder (Luke Perry); and director Sam Wanamaker (Nicholas Hammond). Stacey lost his left leg and arm in a 1973 motorbike accident that killed his girlfriend – so in a morbid reference, we last see him in this film riding off on a motorcycle. The party with McQueen, Phillips, Cass and co was shot where it’s set – the Playboy Mansion. Perry died soon after filming his role.\n\n* Charles Manson himself (played by Damon Herriman) barely appears; just one short cameo, based on a real-life moment when he turned up at Tate’s house months before the murders looking for his friend the music producer Terry Melcher. But a whole host of his followers get more screentime. All are based on real figures, sometimes with their names tweaked: Tex (Austin Butler, later the star of 2022’s Elvis biopic), Gypsy (the writer and director Lena Dunham), Katie (Madisen Beaty), Sadie (Mikey Madison), Clem (James Landry Hébert), Flowerchild (Stranger Things’ Maya Hawke), Lulu (Victoria Pedretti), Snake (Sydney Sweeney), Blue (Kansas Bowling), Angel (Danielle Harris), Froggie (Harley Quinn Smith, the daughter of Tarantino’s fellow director Kevin Smith).\n\n* Trudi Fraser (Julia Butters) is a child actor, aged eight, who is playing a role in Rick Dalton’s episode of Lancer. They chat between takes, striking up a friendship, and Rick is oddly charmed by her precociousness. ‘I believe it’s the job of an actor – and I say actor, not actress because the word actress is nonsensical,’ she proclaims, ‘it’s the actor’s job to avoid impediments to their performance. It’s the actor’s job to strive for one-hundred-per-cent effectiveness.’ Later, on set, Trudi is bowled over with Rick’s performance on camera (‘That was the best acting I’ve ever seen in my whole life,’ she says, making him cry). Wildly wise beyond her years, Trudi is based in part on a real star with a similar name, Jodie Foster, who began her career with attention-grabbing juvenile roles (Taxi Driver, Bugsy Malone, Freaky Friday).\n\n* Billie Booth (Rebecca Gayheart) was Cliff’s wife, who we see in a brief flashback to the day she died. While they pair argue on a boat, Cliff is holding a speargun… which goes off and kills her. Was it murder or an accident? The movie leaves the question pleasingly open-ended – because the myth is more interesting than the facts. Quentin’s subsequent novelisation of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, published in 2021, reveals that Cliff did it on purpose. ‘All my characters are problematic,’ Tarantino has said. ‘And that’s a good thing.’ The incident, of course, is an echo of the death of actor Natalie Wood, who died in unresolved circumstances on a boat in 1981.\n\n* Randy Lloyd (Kurt Russell) is a stunt coordinator who has his doubts about hiring suspected killer Cliff… and regrets it when Cliff beats on star Bruce Lee. For one thing, it pisses off Randy’s wife and colleague, Janet (Zoe Bell). Like her character, QT regular Bell is a stunt coordinator as well as an actor – she performed that role on Once Upon a Time, in fact. Russell also provides some explanatory voiceover later in the film.\n\n* Francesca Capucci (Lorenza Izzo) is an Italian actress who marries Rick during his stint in Rome, then returns with him to Hollywood. She’s present when the Manson followers show up one night. ‘How dare you come into my house, motherfucker!’ she cries.\n\nReturning actors: Leonardo DiCaprio was in Django Unchained while Brad Pitt had a small role in True Romance then a larger part in Inglourious Basterds. This film is Bruce Dern’s third Tarantino movie, Zoe Bell’s fourth (seven if you count her stunt-performing gigs), Kurt Russell’s third, and Michael Madsen’s fifth. James Remar (who appears in the Bounty Law clips) played two roles in Django Unchained. Omar Doom (who plays a biker at the ranch) was in Death Proof and Inglourious Basterds. Perla Haney-Jardine, who’d played Uma Thurman’s character’s daughter in Kill Bill Vol. 2, appears a hippie selling LSD… while Thurman’s real daughter, Maya Hawke, plays one of Manson’s acolytes. Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Four Rooms, The Hateful Eight) and Walton Goggins (Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight) appear in scenes that didn’t make the final cut. Rebecca Gayheart was in the Quentin-produced From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman’s Daughter.\n\nMusic: The jukebox soundtrack is a succession of period pop hits, oftentimes mixed with authentic snatches of 1969 radio jingles. This helps create a mood of buoyancy and sun, as well as a decadent nostalgia for a world that never really existed. However, none of the songs matches the cinematic power of, say, Stuck in the Middle With You (Reservoir Dogs), Across 110th Street (Jackie Brown) or David Bowie’s Cat People (Inglourious Basterds). At one point, in a sequence that was always destined to become a Twitter meme, Rick Dalton appears on the mid-60s variety TV show Hullabaloo and sings/dorky-dances to The Green Door.\n\nTime shifts and chapters: The story mostly plays in chronological order, aside from when we see clips from old TV shows, jump back to Cliff’s fight with Bruce Lee, and get a very brief flashback to the day Cliff’s wife died. The plot skips forward a few months at one point.\n\nConnections:\n\n* In one of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood’s most famous sequences, Sharon Tate goes to a movie theatre to watch one of her own films. The incident is fictional, but is based on an experience Tarantino had of seeing True Romance and having to convince the cinema staff that he’d written the film. Sharon sits in on a screening of The Wrecking Crew (1968), the fourth and final entry in the Matt Helm series of spy capers. She absolutely adores the experience and it’s extremely touching to see her so proud and positive – wide grin, eyes full of glee, bare feet up on the seat in front of her. In reality, however, The Wrecking Crew is a truly feeble movie featuring a lazy Dean Martin leering over women half his age. (When we see clips, it’s the real Sharon Tate on screen.)\n\n* At one point, Marvin Schwarz says that Sergio Corbucci is the ‘second-best director of Spaghetti Westerns in the whole wide world’ and Rick later goes to Italy to work with him. (As Quentin pointed out on the 2022 documentary film Django & Django, the consensus is that Sergio Leone was the best; Corbucci unquestionably the next best.) One of Corbucci’s real-life films was Django (1966), which Quentin riffed on with his 2012 movie Django Unchained.\n\n* The kettle that was used to poison various people in The Hateful Eight can be seen in Cliff’s kitchen.\n\n* When they return from Italy, Rick and Cliff walk past a famous, multi-coloured mural at LAX that was also used in Jackie Brown.\n\n* The character played by James Stacy in Lancer – both here and in reality – is called Johnny Madrid, which is the name of a character in the Tarantino-produced From Dusk Till Dawn 3.\n\n* Ranting at some hippies (actually Manson acolytes), Rick calls one of them ‘Dennis Hopper’. Hopper, the star and director of counterculture text Easy Rider, appeared in the Tarantino-penned True Romance.\n\n* Two cars seen in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood have links to previous QT films – Cliff drives a 1964 Volkswagen convertible, as did the Bride in Kill Bill Vol. 2, while Rick’s 1966 Cadillac de Ville also appeared in Reservoir Dogs (where it was driven by its owner, Michael Madsen).\n\n* In 2021, Tarantino published a novelisation of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which embellished the main characters, drastically rejigged the storyline and put the finale in the first half. It also added an Easter-egg factory’s worth of new associations, links, references and allusions to the Once Upon a Time mythos – for example, we learn that Rick later starred in Coming Home in a Body Bag, a Vietnam film that was discussed by characters in True Romance. (An audiobook version of the novel was read by The Hateful Eight‘s Jennifer Jason Leigh.) QT has reportedly written a follow-up that will detail Rick Dalton’s entire career, and has mooted a stage version (which would feature a lengthy sequence about Rick and Cliff’s time in Italy) *and* producing full-length episodes of Bounty Law.\n\n* In a reference that’s super-sly even by Tarantino’s standards, Margot Robbie actually plays two roles in this film. As well as starring as Sharon Tate, we briefly hear her voice when a Pan Am flight attendant gives Rick a cocktail as he flies home from Rome. Robbie had played attendant Laura Cameron in the TV drama Pan Am, which was also set in the 1960s, and this is intended as the same woman.\n\n* Red Apple cigarettes and Big Kahuna Burgers – two fictional brands that have appeared in many Tarantino movies – crop up again.\n\nReview: For years, when asked if had a favourite of the films he’d directed, Quentin Tarantino would give a politic answer like, ‘Oh, they’re all my children.’ But then at some point things changed and he decided to be honest. ‘I really do think Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is my best movie,’ he said in late 2022. Referred to in countless interviews and reviews as a ‘love letter to Hollywood’, Once Upon a Time was clearly a passion project for Quentin, who imbues every single frame with overt, unmistakable and gleaming Tarantinoisms. He creates compelling characters and addictive situations better than anyone who’s ever directed, and this film – which may end up being his final effort (retirement has been mooted) – is soulful, skilfully made and surprisingly sensitive.\n\nThe noir novelist James Ellroy has called Once Upon a Time in Hollywood the best movie set in Hollywood he’s ever seen, in part because of how it evokes time and place. Ellroy was 21 during the Manson killings and lived in the LA area: ‘I could smell it,’ he said of Tarantino’s film. A large reason for this fidelity is thrilling filmmaking craft – whole city blocks were redressed as 1969 with no recourse to CGI, the sound mix is peppered with genuine radio ads and jingles – while the script is absolutely drenched in pop-culture references of the era. In contrast to the movie-obsessed characters Tarantino is famed for, however, Once Upon a Time actually contains many more mentions of television shows – both real (Lancer, I Love Lucy, Peyton Place, Batman, The Girl From UNCLE, Land of the Giants, literally dozens more) and invented.\n\nThis is because, to his chagrin, TV is the world Rick Dalton finds himself in as the story begins. While Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is structurally similar to the fuzzy, irregular, multi-thread format of Pulp Fiction, with several voices demanding our attention, Rick is the lead character. He’s the emotional heart and the epicentre, around whom all the madness swirls. He’s a dying breed, a relic – much like the Hollywood culture being washed away by hippies, drugs, cynicism, television, a more sophisticated audience and big-business taking over the studios – and he knows it *vividly*. The script follows Rick as, in turn, he tries to cling on, tries to adapt, rallies against the coming forces, accepts his lot, fights back, finds a new way to live… This is a midlife-crisis film, an existential crisis in fact – a companion to Tarantino’s Jackie Brown in how it deals with a character growing older and fearing that their time is passing. And just like Pam Greer in that 1997 masterpiece, DiCaprio sells every beat.\n\nObviously, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood’s title is a deliberate reference to the great Italian director Sergio Leone – a master of cinematic violence. Leone made movies called Once Upon a Time in the West (a sublime Western from 1968) and Once Upon a Time in America (a classy 1984 gangster epic), and Quentin’s stylistic debt to him has been obvious for a long time to anyone who knows the two men’s work. However, as is often the case with Tarantino, this isn’t just empty referencing. It’s a master director who, like Leone, knows that violence on film only works if the build-up has created meaning for the characters and the audience.\n\nIn Sergio Leone’s greatest films – the six he made between 1964’s A Fistful of Dollars and 1984’s Once Upon a Time in America – characters are forever heading towards violence, but Leone was never interested in the face-offs and the brawls and the mass shootouts. Leone’s gunfights are usually over in an instant. Instead his focus was the seconds, the minutes, the hours, the *years* that lead up to these moments; the ritual and the preparation and the creation of suspense.\n\nTarantino knows that virtually every viewer will know (or think they know) what’s coming, what’s going to happen when Sharon Tate and the Manson murderers collide. A growing sense of dread builds as we get to know Sharon (albeit at a remove), as we follow Rick and Cliff’s intertwined storylines, as we soak up the glamorous, celebrity-dotted world of 1969 LA, because we’re sure that the movie is heading for a tragic end. When writing 2009’s Inglourious Basterds, it became clear to Tarantino that a key scene would turn out much longer than he’d planned – 24 pages, almost unheard of in a Hollywood film. But he was enjoying the writing, and believed it held its length, so stuck to his guns. ‘Not only do I think it holds,’ he said in a 2019 interview with BBC Radio 1, ‘but I think the longer I can stretch this out the better it will be.’ He talked about the ‘give in the rubber band’ – in other words, more and more tension before the snap. Once Upon a Time uses this trick with more subtly and nuance than any other film in Tarantino’s filmography – not in a single scene as Standartenführer Landa questions a nervous farmer or jewel thieves debate who the mole is, but across an entire 160-minute film.\n\nBut there’s another, very important element at play here. As well as nodding towards his hero Leone, Tarantino used the title Once Upon a Time in Hollywood so he could tip us off that this is a fairy tale. And fairy tales have happy endings…\n\nAs the trio of Manson followers arrive in Rick and Sharon’s high-end cul-de-sac, we’ve been conditioned by a century of biopics and real-life dramas into assuming that events will play out in a certain way. The film then pulls off an audacious switch: Cliff intervenes and the Manson-twats never even get to Sharon’s house. It’s the film’s biggest laugh – an arch, Grand Guignol reversal of expectations, which features violence so overblown and extreme and cartoon that the gag is obvious. Well, obvious to most. Some viewers have occasionally taken issue with this historically inaccurate ending, presumably failing to grasp the fairy-tale context (as did people who have criticised the noir stylings and punchy plotting in a film called… Pulp Fiction). Like a similar beat in Inglourious Basterds – which saw Adolf Hitler massacred in a cinema – this is Quentin exacting fantasy justice. Literalness and reality are not as fun, exciting or illustrative as daydream imaginings can be, so the script takes true history and twists it into something more dramatically interesting, something more rawly thrilling, something more unashamedly playful, and something more like a fairy tale. Out of tragedy comes joy.\n\nQuentin Tarantino has said he ‘equates transgression with art’ – and by being so unexpected, so unconventional, so flat-out funny while showing graphic violence, art is what the heady, fantasia climax of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood reaches.\n\nNine streets are silent… except when Rick Dalton’s got a fucking shotgun, I’ll tell you that, out of 10\n\nSpoiler alert: these reviews reveal plot twists. Seriously, this is a very recent film with some big revelations so please only read on if you’ve seen it.\n\nEight (or so) people are trapped in a roadside cabin called Minnie’s Haberdashery during a blizzard – but not all are who they say they are…\n\nWhat does QT do? Quentin Tarantino writes, directs and provides some narration. The film very nearly didn’t happen. Tarantino got the hump after his draft script was leaked online, but was eventually persuaded to carry on.\n\nNotable characters:\n\n* Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L Jackson) is a former army officer who fought with the North in the American Civil War, but he’s now a bounty hunter. Stranded in the snow, he talks his way onto a stagecoach – in part because he has a handwritten letter from the late Abraham Lincoln – and ends up in a cabin with some strangers. We later learn there’s a bounty on Warren’s head, thanks to him killing some prisoners during the war, and that he faked the letter as a way of ingratiating himself with people. It’s a grandstanding performance – big, theatrical and reliably entertaining in the Jacksonian tradition.\n\n* OB (James Parks) is a stagecoach driver who’s been hired by…\n\n* John ‘The Hangman’ Ruth (Kurt Russell) is a bounty hunter who’s transporting his quarry, a woman called Daisy, across country. He routinely beats on her but wants her alive so he can see her hang. They also end up in the blizzard-bound cabin. Russell’s having fun with the larger-than-life Ruth.\n\n* Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) has a $10,000 reward on her head, hence Ruth’s eagerness to get her to the authorities. She’s a feral, foul-mouthed loose cannon of a character. Despite having an awful lot of standing-around-while-the-men-talk to do, Leigh’s punk-attitude performance is so strong it bagged her an Oscar nomination.\n\n* Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) is on his way to the nearest town, Red Rock, to be sworn in as the new sheriff but also gets trapped at the cabin. The son of a Southern war hero, he’s a real shit-stirrer of a character.\n\n* Bob aka Marco the Mexican (Demián Bichir) says he’s running Minnie’s Haberdashery in its owners’ absence… but in reality is one of Daisy’s gang, who have laid a trap for John Ruth.\n\n* Oswaldo Mobray aka English Pete Hicox (Tim Roth) has a clipped accent and says he’s the new hangman in Red Rock – but is actually another of Daisy’s gang. It’s such an affected English accent, in fact, that it’s something of a relief when he reverts to his real voice, which is closer to the actor’s own.\n\n* General Sandford Smithers (Bruce Dern) is a guest at the cabin when the others arrive. A batty old racist, he has a grudge against Warren even before he learns that Warren killed his son (or at least claims to have done as a taunt).\n\n* Joe Gage aka Grouch Douglass (Michael Madsen) initially sits in the corner of the cabin not bothering anyone. He says he’s a cowpuncher on his way to visit his mother, but is another of Daisy’s compadres.\n\n* A narrator (Quentin Tarantino) provides some exposition about 20 minutes of action we’ve skipped over, then returns in a flashback to explain the preparation Daisy’s friends did before the stagecoach arrived. Quentin reads the lines really well – crisply and with a sense of drama.\n\n* Jody Domergue (Channing Tatum) has been hiding under the floorboards ever since Ruth, Warren, Mannix and Daisy arrived – he’s Daisy’s brother and along with Bob, Oswaldo and Joe is there to rescue her. It’s an audacious plot twist… which doesn’t really stack up. If Jody’s intention is to free Daisy and he doesn’t object to killing innocent people to do it, why wait so long to do it? Incidentally, the notion of previously unseen characters who have been eavesdropping on the action was also used in Pulp Fiction and Inglourious Basterds.\n\n* ‘Six-horse’ Judy (Zoe Bell) is a stagecoach driver who brings Jody and the boys to the cabin. She’s a perky, likeable woman from Auckland.\n\n* Minnie Mink (Dana Gourrier), Gemma (Belinda Owino) and Sweet Dave (Gene Jones) run the cabin. Minnie and Dave are a couple.\n\nReturning actors: Samuel L Jackson has his seventh role in a Tarantino-written film. Tim Roth plays his first Tarantino character in 20 years and fourth overall. Michael Madsen is also staring in a fourth QT film. Kurt Russell had been in Death Proof. Walton Goggins (Django Unchained), Bruce Dern (Django Unchained), James Parks (Kill Bill Vol. 1, Django Unchained) and Zoe Bell (Death Proof, Django Unchained) also crop up. As mentioned, Tarantino himself has a voice part.\n\nMusic: We get the first full-length, purpose-written score on a Tarantino-directed film – it’s by Ennio Morricone and is very effective. As Morricone ran out of time, though, some cues he wrote for The Thing (1982) and Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977) have been reused. There are also a few songs by people such as The White Stripes and Roy Orbison. In the film, Bob plays Silent Night on the piano and Daisy plays 19th-century ballad Jim Jones at Botony Bay on the guitar. Daisy’s song led to a notorious incident on set. John Ruth was scripted to take the guitar off her and smash it to pieces. However, Kurt Russell accidentally did it when – instead of a prop replacement – a priceless 1870s Martin guitar was being used for the shot. You can see the take in the finished film. The look of shock and disbelief on Jennifer Jason Leigh’s face is genuine.\n\nTime shifts and chapters: This is another Tarantino film divided into chapters with on-screen titles. This time there are six: ‘Last Stage to Red Rock’ (which lasts about 17 minutes), ‘Son of a Gun’ (12 minutes), ‘Minnie’s Haberdashery’ (58 minutes), Domergue’s Got a Secret’ (23 minutes), ‘The Four Passengers’ (20 minutes) and ‘Black Man, White Hell’ (22 minutes). The third features a brief flashback; the fourth rewinds in time to show us an earlier incident from a different point of view; while the penultimate section is set ‘Earlier that morning’. As is often the case with flashbacks that explain what’s *really* going on, The Four Passengers is a hoot.\n\nConnections: The idea for The Hateful Eight began as what would have been Quentin Tarantino’s first novel – a continuation of Django Unchained called Django in White Hell. However, he felt the story didn’t really suit the central character, so he eventually retooled the idea as a movie script and Django was replaced by Major Marquis Warren. (This explains why Warren is a bounty hunter.) Additionally, Tim Roth’s Pete Hicox is intended to be the grandfather of Inglourious Basterds’s Archie Hicox. And now’s a good a time as any to mention Red Apple. It’s a fictional brand of cigarettes that’s mentioned in The Hateful Eight a couple of times and previously featured in Pulp Fiction, From Dusk Till Dawn, Four Rooms and Kill Bill.\n\nReview: The Hateful Eight has the strangest opening of any Tarantino film. We start with big, empty, wintery landscape shots, which tell us we’re in a world of cold, harsh and wide-open spaces. (They also show off the gorgeous Ultra Panavision 70mm photography, which is by Robert Richardson and aches to be seen on a mammoth cinema screen.) One of the shots is a lingering look at a macabre carving of a man on a cross and lasts for 154 seconds. Add in Ennio Morricone’s stirring music and it’s all very BIG and EPIC. But this is a bum steer. Rather than a sweeping, Old-West blockbuster, this film is a character-driven chamber piece reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs. (The presence of Michael Madsen and Tim Roth only reinforces that feeling, of course.) Admittedly, it takes a while to get there. There’s fun dialogue and plot information in the film’s first half hour, but this extended prologue has come in for criticism. In a 160-minute movie, you can’t help feeling there could be a better way to start the story. (Maybe begin with Ruth and co arriving at the cabin, then present the earlier events in flashback?) However, once we hit Minnie’s Haberdashery – where more than two-thirds of the movie takes place – the stage is set, the crazy, well-cast characters shine, and the story clips along very enjoyably. A number of minor mysteries are also being set up. Where’s Minnie? Why does the door not close properly? Why doesn’t Bob know what he’s doing? Why is there a jellybean on the floor? But the movie smartly doesn’t emphasise them. These questions simmer away in the background while the focus is on the characters. It’s a wide-ranging group – three nationalities, three races, both genders, a big spread of ages – which is rare in Westerns. It’s refreshing and makes for some interesting dynamics. However, having said that, the film’s treatment of women is difficult to excuse. The main female character, Daisy, is subjected to more violence than everyone else put together, while three other women are killed simply because they’re in the way. Daisy is actually the most powerful character in the story (she has a strong, well-tooled gang to back her up) and its most cunning (she *really* plays the long game), yet the film doesn’t allow her any victory. Instead, she’s lynched by a racist. There’s also a hard-to-justify number of coincidences in the plot. Characters are forever bumping into people they’ve heard of in the middle of nowhere. Is this meant to be a conceptual joke? A play on how sparsely populated the Wild West actually was? Perhaps. An even bigger question you keep asking yourself is: who are the Hateful Eight? Posters, DVD covers and Wikipedia define the group as Warren, Ruth, Domergue, Mannix, Bob, Mobray, Gage and Smithers, but that ignores OB (and Jody). Of course, maybe the title is just a pun on the 1960 film The Magnificent Seven – or an acknowledgement of the fact Tarantino considers this to be his eighth movie (he ignores Four Rooms and counts Kill Bill as one film). On the whole, The Hateful Eight is worth seeing and has many things to commend it. But it lacks the focus of Reservoir Dogs, the ingenuity of Pulp Fiction, the soul of Jackie Brown, the tension of Inglourious Basterds and the dry humour of Django Unchained – all things that would help. Very good rather than great.\n\nEight bowls of stew out of 10\n\nSpoiler alert: these reviews reveal plot twists.\n\nIn the 1850s, a bounty hunter helps a freed slave who wants to rescue his wife…\n\nWhat does QT do? Quentin Tarantino wrote the script, directed the film, and cast himself in the minor role of a man transporting slaves to a mining company. It’s a dreadful acting performance – easily Quentin’s worst in one of his own films. It features an Australian accent that veers from South African to cockney via no-sorry-that’s-actually-indecipherable.\n\nNotable characters:\n\n* Django (Jamie Foxx) – the D is silent – is in chains when we first see him. After he’s bought by a man called Schultz, Django agrees to help him in exchange for his freedom. They spend a winter together hunting down bounties, then head to Mississippi to find Django’s enslaved wife… Foxx plays the role part naïve, part numb, which means Django is an oddly blank character. The true heart of the film arguably lies with…\n\n* Dr King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) travels across America seemingly as a dentist; his wagon even has a giant tooth on a spring rocking back and forth. However, he’s actually a successful bounty hunter. When we meet him he’s searching for the fugitive Brittle brothers and needs Django’s help. Schultz is German, and English is his second language, yet he’s as verbose and articulate as any Tarantino creation. He does a chunk of the talking in most scenes, and it’s a beguiling performance of charisma and moral ambiguity. (It won Waltz his second Oscar for playing a Tarantino character.) The film becomes noticeably less interesting after Schultz is killed.\n\n* Sheriff Bill Sharp (Don Stroud) challenges Schultz and Django when they saunter into a town and flaunt its racist policies. Schultz shoots him dead with a concealed weapon (very steampunky, this, like something from Wild Wild West) then tells the local marshall, Gill Tatum (Tom Wopat), that Sharp was a wanted man. As an incident to show off Schultz’s job and commanding wits, it’s superb.\n\n* Old Man Carrucan (Bruce Dern) is Django’s former owner, who we see in a flashback. He branded Django and his wife for trying to escape, then sold them separately.\n\n* Broomhilda ‘Hildi’ von Shaft (Kerry Washington) is Django’s wife. She was once owned by a German family, hence her surname, but is now a slave on a plantation called Candyland. When Django and Schultz arrive to look for her, she’s been put in a hotbox – a half-buried metal crate left out in the searing sun – as a punishment.\n\n* Spencer ‘Big Daddy’ Bennett (Don Johnson) is a slave-owning, plantation-owning, big-hat-owning Southern gentleman who is definitely Southern but certainly no gentleman. Schultz talks his way onto the plantation so he and Django can search for the Brittle brothers (MC Gainey, Cooper Huckabee and Doc Duhame).\n\n* A member of the local Ku Klux Klan (Jonah Hill, credited as Bag Head #2) features in a silly scene where KKK twats argue over their homemade outfits.\n\n* Leo Moguy (Dennis Christopher) is a lawyer who puts Schultz and Django in touch with an important character called…\n\n* Calvin J Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a flamboyant, arrogant Francophile who runs a plantation, has lots of slaves and is fond of forcing the men to fight each other to the death. He’s also Hildi’s owner, so Schultz and Django attempt to con him into selling her to them… As talented as DiCaprio clearly is, he’s miscast here. The character is too young and not enough of a threat.\n\n* Butch Pooch (James Remar, looking like Paul Newman as Butch Cassidy) is Candie’s bodyguard. As Django notes, he’s being rude by wearing his hat indoors. Remar also plays another small role in the film: Ace Speck, who owns Django as the story begins.\n\n* Amerigo Vessepi (Franco Nero) is a slave-owner whose best man loses a staged fight with one of Candie’s slaves. When Vessepi talks to Django, there’s a hint he may have another name (see Connections).\n\n* Billy Crash (Walton Goggins) is one of Candie’s sadistic henchmen.\n\n* Stephen (Samuel L Jackson) is the head ‘house slave’ at Candyland, which gives him licence to boss other slaves about and have a crotchety grandfather vibe with Calvin. He’s an elderly man with white hair and a stick, and he instantly takes against Django. He soon rumbles his and Schultz’s plan.\n\n* Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly (Laura Cayouette) is Candie’s widowed sister. She’s only really in the story to justify why Hildi is working in the house rather than on the land, but is involved in two of the movie’s best moments: when she innocently points out that Hildi has been eyeing up Django; and her slapstick death during the action climax.\n\n* Three employees of the LeQunt Dickey Mining Company (Michael Parks, Quentin Tarantino and John Jarratt) transport Django across country. He cons them into letting him free and then kills them. They’re Australian, for some reason.\n\nReturning actors: Christoph Waltz had been in Inglourious Basterds. Samuel L Jackson gets Tarantino role number six. Zoe Bell (Death Proof), Michael Bowen (Jackie Brown, Kill Bill Vol. 1), James Parks (Kill Bill Vol. 1) and Tom Savini (From Dusk Till Dawn) have mute cameos as Candyland employees. Michael Parks (From Dusk Till Dawn, both Kill Bills, Death Proof) appears again. Tarantino’s role is the sixth time he’s played one of his own characters.\n\nMusic: The rousing theme song is taken from the 1966 Italian film Django (see Connections). Incidental cues from movies such as Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970), The Last American Hero (1973) and Under Fire (1983) have been recycled. Various other pre-existing tunes are used too – Beethoven, Wagner, a lyrically apt track from the Italian film Lo chiamavano King (1971) – as well as songs written specifically for the film by artists such as John Legend, Anthony Hamilton and Rick Ross.\n\nTime shifts and chapters: It’s the most orthodox structure of any Tarantino script. We follow one linear storyline in chronological order, and Django and/or Schultz are in almost every scene. There are brief flashbacks here and there, but they’re motivated cutaways rather than the movie telling its story out of sequence.\n\nConnections: The lead character’s name is a reference to the Italian film Django (1966), a nihilistic Spaghetti Western that has spawned more than 30 sequels, rip-offs and homages. (One of them, Sukiyaki Western Django (2007), actually featured Quentin Tarantino in an acting role.) Although he uses the alias Amerigo Vessepi, the eponymous character from the 1966 film cameos in Django Unchained played by original actor Franco Nero. Meanwhile, Hildi’s surname tells us that she and Django are ancestors of 1970s private detective John Shaft. In Kill Bill Vol. 2, the Bride climbed out of a grave belonging to ‘Paula Schultz’. Tarantino has said that Paula is the wife of Christoph Waltz’s Django Unchained character. According to her headstone, she lived until 1893 so presumably they’re separated by the time of this film. He never mentions her. And finally, in 2014 Jamie Foxx reprised his Django for a cameo in Seth McFarlane’s film A Million Ways To Die in the West.\n\nReview: There’s a great line in Bill Bryson’s 2008 book on William Shakespeare where he’s talking about the Bard’s habit of shamelessly lifting plots and dialogue from other writers. “What Shakespeare did, of course, was take pedestrian pieces of work and endow them with distinction and, very often, greatness.” It rings true for Quentin Tarantino too, who has often used other films as a starting point for a project. But when you watch these movies – 1973’s Coffy, 1971’s Vanishing Point, 1978’s The Inglorious Bastards, 1966’s Django and many others – what’s often noticeable is how superior his resulting films are. They’re classier, more polished, more dynamic and more interesting. (As David Bowie put it once: it doesn’t matter who does something first. It’s who does it second that counts.) Part of this is down to budget, of course. Django Unchained cost $100 million to make. The 1966 Django looks like it cost about two-and-six. But while Tarantino often stands on the shoulders of averagely tall people, he always brings something new, something fresh. For Django Unchained, one such fresh element is that it’s a Western that technically isn’t a Western. It uses the tropes and clichés of the genre (horses! Guns! Standoffs! Crash-zooms! Glorious widescreen!), but the story is actually set in the Deep South before the American Civil War. And crucially it’s about a subject ignored by most Westerns: black Americans and slavery. Many people have lambasted this film for its paper-thin analysis. Slavery was a bad thing, it says, and slave owners were bastards. Well, yeah… But that’s like dismissing The Great Escape because it’s prioritises fun over philosophy. Speaking of which, this film is often a lot of fun. With a sense of humour so dry it’s parched, Django Unchained is basically a comedy. It does have some very serious elements – severe racism, the N-word used liberally, a slave-fighting subplot that comes out of left-field, torture, sadistic violence – but there’s also plenty of whimsy, gallows humour and actual jokes. The story is engaging and the characters, especially Shultz, are very watchable. But on the downside it’s too long with a number of superfluous scenes. The KKK members and the tracker characters, for example, feel like they’re going to be important but don’t go anywhere. The finale also lacks tension, descending into blood splashes, squib hits, slo-mo deaths and a huge body count. So Django Unchained might not have greatness, but it does have bags of distinction.\n\nEight bills of sale out of 10\n\nSpoiler alert: these reviews reveal plot twists.\n\nIn France during the Second World War, two plans to assassinate the Nazi high command are put into place…\n\nWhat does QT do? Writer/director Quentin Tarantino had been mooting this project for over a decade, and it seems he had a few failed attempts at finishing the script. It started off as a loose remake of the 1978 Italian movie Quel maledetto treno blindato, which was released in America under the name The Inglorious Bastards. (An exploitation rip-off of The Dirty Dozen, it’s a gung-ho men-on-a-mission film. Bits of it are fun.) But the more Tarantino wrote, the more his script moved away from the original. The Brad Pitt subplot has an echo of the 70s film, but this is certainly not a remake. Tarantino claims his misspelt title is just an affectation. He also has a cameo as a dead German soldier who’s being scalped.\n\nNotable characters:\n\n* Perrier LaPadite (Denis Ménochet) is a French farmer who’s visited one day by an SS officer hunting for Jews. LaPadite’s conversation with the officer, Landa, is the film’s opening salvo and is a scene loaded with menace. One of LaPadite’s briefly seen daughters is played by Léa Seydoux, who later stared with Landa actor Christoph Waltz in Spectre (2015).\n\n* SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) has gained the nickname The Jew Hunter because he combs war-torn France looking for them. It’s an astonishing performance, for which Waltz won an Oscar, a Bafta and a Golden Globe. Landa is unspeakably evil – if all the cunts in the world got together to vote for the biggest cunt, he’d stand a chance of winning – but you can’t take your eyes off him. He’s polite, seemingly easy-going and has a childlike and formal manner, yet has ultimate power in almost every scene. Because of the story’s chapter-like structure, the character actually goes away for long stretches. But he still dominates the film.\n\n* Shosanna Dreyfus aka Emmanuelle Mimieux (Mélanie Laurent) flees LaPadite’s farmhouse when Landa kills her family. Four years later, she’s living under an assumed name in Paris and managing a cinema. When the Nazis plan to use her establishment for a film premiere, she sees an opportunity to kill the top brass. Laurent gives a brilliant performance of strength and quiet turmoil.\n\n* First Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) is a showboating army officer who leads a small platoon of Jewish-American soldiers. They call themselves the Basterds and their mission is to hunt down and kill Nazis. (Raine insists on scalping the victims.) Pitt is as broad as his Tennessee accent, but it’s quite entertaining.\n\n* Staff Sergeant Donny Donowitz (Eli Roth) is Raine’s second in command. He’s acquired the nickname The Bear Jew and enjoys killing Nazis with a baseball bat. Eli Roth is billed fourth in the opening credits. FOURTH. It pays to be Quentin Tarantino’s mate, it seems.\n\n* Adolf Hitler (Martin Wuttke)… oh, you know.\n\n* Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger) is an Austrian member of the Basterds. They recruited him after he killed 13 members of the Gestapo.\n\n* A narrator (Samuel L Jackson) twice provides some exposition. He tells us Stiglitz’s backstory then later explains why cans of nitrate film are so dangerous.\n\n* Private First Class Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl) is a young German who has risen to fame because he killed 250 Allies in three days from a sniper’s position. A movie called Nation’s Pride has been made about his exploits, with Zoller playing himself. He meets Shosanna/Emmanuelle and flirts with her. But she isn’t interested because he’s, you know, a fascist fuck-stain. Brühl is really good at playing a cocky little twerp who can, and does, turn nasty at a moment’s notice.\n\n* Marcel (Jacky Ido) is Shosanna’s lover, a black man who works at the cinema. He’s an oddly minor character who we sadly never focus on.\n\n* Major Dieter Hellstrom (August Diehl) appears twice, firstly when he delivers Shosanna to a meeting with Goebbels, then later in an underground tavern when he suspects some German officers of being spies.\n\n* Joseph Goebbels (Sylvester Groth) and aide (ie, mistress) Francesca Mondino (Julie Dreyfus) are in Paris to oversee the premiere of Nation’s Pride.\n\n* Lieutenant Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender) is a British Army officer who used to be a film critic and is an expert on German cinema. He’s handpicked for a mission to go behind enemy lines, hook up with the Basterds, and assassinate some Nazis. However, once he and the Basterds have met a double agent in a local tavern, Hicox gives the game away by using a non-German hand gesture (very Red-Grant-ordering-the-wrong-wine-in-From-Russia-With-Love, this). Fassbender is terrific, clipped accent and all. (Simon Pegg was considered for the role but was busy on The Adventures of Tintin.)\n\n* General Ed Fenech (Mike Myers) gives Hicox his assignment. Winston Churchill (Rod Taylor) watches from afar.\n\n* Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) is a famed German movie star and also a double agent for the Allies. She arranged to meet Hicox once he’s in France, but chooses a location that brings a whole heap of problems… Kruger’s is another excellent performance.\n\n* An OSS Commander (Harvey Keitel) is heard over a radio when Landa wants to make a deal for his surrender.\n\nReturning actors: Brad Pitt had an enjoyable cameo in True Romance. Eli Roth and Omar Doom (one of the Basterds) had been in Death Proof. Julie Dreyfus was in Kill Bill Vol. 1. Michael Bacall was in Tarantino’s CSI episode and Death Proof. Bo Svenson, who’s glimpsed in the Nation’s Pride film, had a small role in Kill Bill Vol. 2 and was also the lead actor in 1978’s The Inglorious Bastards. Although only providing voice parts, Samuel L Jackson is in his fifth Tarantino film, Harvey Keitel his fourth.\n\nMusic: Tarantino wanted the great Ennio Morricone to score the film – and it would have been the first purpose-written score for one of his movies – but the composer was busy. So some archive cues by Morricone and others have been employed. David Bowie’s 1982 song Cat People (Putting Out Fire) is used to great effect when Shosanna is preparing for the premiere. She’s also surrounded by the colour red, symbolising her murderous intent.\n\nTime shifts and chapters: The film is divided into five chapters with on-screen titles: ‘Once upon a time… in Nazi-occupied France’ (which lasts around 20 minutes), ‘Inglourious Basterds’ (16 minutes), ‘German night in Paris’ (25 minutes), ‘Operation Kino’ (40 minutes) and ‘Revenge of the Giant Face’ (42 minutes). They play in chronological order, but the second has fun with flashbacks within flashbacks, while the finale also features brief flashbacks.\n\nConnections: Tarantino has said that Eli Roth’s character, Donny Donowitz, is the father of Lee Donowitz, the coke-head movie producer in True Romance.\n\nReview: Inglourious Basterds is a film made up of great scenes rather than a wholly great film. There is a through-line and the subplots build to a shared climax, but the episodic structure means that characters often go absent and the tone varies quite a bit. (We switch from scenes of unbearable tension to sections played for laughs.) So as a piece of storytelling it’s a bit fragmented. Despite all this, though, it’s still very impressive and is headlined by a tremendous cast with some electrifying dialogue. Some of the individual chapters are also mini-masterpieces in their own right, such as the opening scene at the farm. Here, Tarantino shows a *masterful* control of time and space. The build-up of anxiety is palpable, as is the creeping horror, and there’s a constant threat of violence and catastrophe underneath the surface. The camerawork is also thrilling in its clarity and precision: it’s always telling story, always adding meaning and subtext. You find yourself holding your breath while Landa gently (ie, menacingly) questions LaPadite. The scene is reminiscent of the Westerns of director Sergio Leone, which favoured long, slow, deliberate preludes to violence and revelations. In fact, the chapter title is a pun on Leone’s best film: Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). This buttock-clenching fear is generated elsewhere in the film too. Landa’s meeting with Shosanna in Paris (the strudel scene) is equally nerve-shredding – despite a few hints, you’re never quite sure if he knows who she is – and the sequence in the tavern, while a superficially light-hearted conversation, has real edginess and danger once a Gestapo officer sits at the table. On the other hand, despite giving the movie its title, the Basterds’ scenes tend to be a bit cartoony. Cartoons with horrific bursts of violence, that is. Other notable aspects of this marvellous movie include the fact it’s Tarantino’s first period film (he revels in the culturally arrested Paris of 1944), the extensive use of subtitles (there are entire conversations in French and German), a gleeful disregard for historical accuracy (THEY KILL OFF HITLER!), and a motif built around the power of cinema (which is evident in Shosanna’s job, Zoller’s fame, the nitrate film, Hicox’s career, the premiere…). It might be damning with faint praise to say that Inglourious Basterds is Tarantino’s fourth best movie. But given the strength of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, that’s still an accolade worth having.\n\nNine pages of history out of 10\n\nSpoiler alert: these reviews reveal plot twists.\n\nGroups of women are hunted by a serial-killing stuntman with a souped-up car…\n\nWhat does QT do? He wrote the script, directed the film, played a secondary character, and for the first time acted as his own cinematographer. This film has a complex provenance – see Connections.\n\nNotable characters:\n\n* Jungle Julia Lucai (Sydney Poitier) is a local DJ in Austin, Texas, whose show is advertised on numerous billboards around town. She’s laid-back, cool and the leader of her gang of friends, which includes…\n\n* Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito) is from New York and has a New York attitude. Her pals have played a trick on her, though. Julia announced on the radio that any man who calls Arlene ‘Butterfly’ and recites a certain poem can have a lap dance.\n\n* Shanna (Jordan Ladd) is the third member of the group. She’s a Southerner who hates people who pronounce her name with a long A.\n\n* Stuntman Mike McKay (Kurt Russell) is a veteran stuntman who’s worked mainly in TV. He wears a decaled jacket and hangs around in bars, observing and sometimes intimidating women. After coercing Arlene into giving him a lap dance, he offers to give a woman called Pam a lift home. Sadly for Pam, Mike is a serial killer who uses his stripped-down car to murder her. He then chases after and kills Julia, Arlene and Shanna, then 14 months later targets another group of female friends. Russell gives a creepy performance, which lapses into an unnerving John Wayne impression at one point.\n\n* Dov (Eli Roth), Nate (Omar Doom) and Omar (Michael Bacall) are the male friends of Julia’s gang, who all hope for a bit of action.\n\n* Warren (Quentin Tarantino) is a fun-loving barman who uses the phrase ‘tasty beverage’ (a reference to Pulp Fiction).\n\n* Pam (Rose McGowan) is an old schoolmate of Julia’s, though they don’t get on. When Mike gives her a lift home, he deliberately races around and brakes hard so she’s mangled to death in the seatbelt-free, encaged passenger seat.\n\n* Dr Dakota Block (Marley Shelton), Texas Ranger Earl McGraw (Michael Parks) and Ranger Edgar McGraw (James Parks) feature in one scene at a hospital after Mike’s killed Julia, Arlene and Shanna. Earl is mad because he can’t prove the incident was murder.\n\n* Lee Montgomery (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is a nice but slightly dopey actress working on a cheerleader movie in Tennessee. (This is 14 months after the first group of women were killed.) She spends her day off with friends Kim and Abernathy, and wears her cheerleader’s costume… for some reason. Not that I’m complaining. In order to borrow a car from a decidedly dodgy redneck, Lee’s friends leave her with him as collateral… and that’s the last we see of her in the film!\n\n* Kim Mathis (Tracie Thoms) is a brash and confident stuntwoman working on Lee’s film. When Mike attacks the friends, Kim shoots at him and the girls then chase after him, hunt him down and kill him.\n\n* Abernathy Ross (Rosario Dawson) is a make-up artist, who has the day off because Lindsay Lohan does too.\n\n* Zoe Bell (Zoe Bell) is a Kiwi stuntwoman who flies into Tennessee to hang out with pals Kim and Abernathy. As she’s in America, she wants to do ‘ship’s mast’ – a dangerous game that involves being strapped to the bonnet of the car from the movie Vanishing Point while it bombs down country lanes… Tarantino met Bell when she was Uma Thurman’s stuntwoman on Kill Bill, and he was so charmed that he wrote a part for her in this film. Not being an actress, Bell assumed it would be cameo, then read the script and realised that a) she was playing herself, and b) she had *reams* of dialogue. She’s actually pretty good – clearly not an experienced actress, she more than gets by thanks to natural charisma. And of course casting Bell means that the character can do some outrageous stunts and it’s demonstrably her doing them.\n\n* Jasper (Jonathan Loughran) is a creepy local man who owns a muscle car. The girls want to borrow it for a test drive but have no intention of actually buying it.\n\nReturning actors: Michael Parks (From Dusk Till Dawn, both Kill Bills), James Parks (Kill Bill Vol. 1) and Jonathan Loughran (Kill Bill Vol. 1) appear again – see Connections. Michael Bacall was in Tarantino’s CSI episode. Quentin plays a significant role in one of his own films for the first time since Pulp Fiction, 13 years earlier.\n\nMusic: The title music is stirring instrumental The Last Race by Jack Nitzsche. A cover of Baby It’s You by Smith (sic: sadly not The Smiths!) features in both halves of the story and subliminally connects the two groups of women – it’s played on a jukebox in the Austin bar, and Lee later sings along to it on her iPod. T. Rex’s Jeepster is also heard on the jukebox, as is Down in Mexico by the Coasters when Arlene does her lap dance. Later on, Julia phones her radio station and asks for Hold Tight by Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich to be played on the air. It’s unclear if this is a deliberate mistake or not, but self-proclaimed music expert Julia thinks the band was called Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, *Mitch* & Tich.\n\nTime shifts and chapters: The car crash that kills Julia, Arlene, Shanna and their friend Lanna is shown four times in quick succession so we can focus on each of their horrifically violent deaths.\n\nConnections: Here’s where it gets complicated… Death Proof began as part of a three-hour movie called Grindhouse, which was released in April 2007. Grindhouse consisted of two ‘features’ – Planet Terror, written and directed by Robert Rodriguez, and Death Proof, written and directed by Quentin Tarantino – as well as some trailers for fake films directed by the likes of Eli Roth and Edgar Wright. The idea was to recreate the mood and feel of a 1970s grindhouse cinema, which showed low-budget horror films on a loop. The movie, however, was a big old flop. So outside of North America, the two features were released separately in the autumn with some extras scenes added to punch up their running times (in Grindhouse, they’d both had scenes deliberately missing as an in-joke about bad prints). The standalone Planet Terror is a horror-comedy that, while shallow fun, weaves drunkenly from being too earnest to being too puerile. Co-producer Tarantino has an embarrassing cameo as a rapist. Additionally, some of Grindhouse’s fake trailers have since been expanded into full-length movies: Machete (2010), Hobo With a Shotgun (2011) and Machete Kills (2013). Death Proof, meanwhile, uses a few characters from existing fictions. Jasper is said by some to be the same rapist hillbilly the actor played in Kill Bill Vol. 1. Earl and Edgar McGraw crop up again, having appeared in both the From Dusk Till Dawn and Kill Bill series. They’re also in Planet Terror, as is Dr Dakota Block.\n\nReview: Talking about his career in 2012, Tarantino said he knows he’ll be judged on a body of work. “I want to go out with a terrific filmography,” he claimed. “Death Proof has got to be the worst movie I ever make. And for a left-handed movie, that wasn’t so bad, all right?” This left-handed movie is a homage to a couple of exploitation genres Tarantino loved from an early age – slasher films such as Halloween (1978) and car movies like Vanishing Point (1971). And while set in the present day, Death Proof uses various techniques to make it seem like you’re watching a bad print that’s travelled round from cinema to cinema. The film stock looks cheap, there are scratches, jumps and audio mismatches, while one reel is even in black and white. All this tomfoolery does calm down after a while, thankfully, and the story takes focus. What’s most striking is the fact the movie is ruled by women. (Men in this story are losers, perverts, absent… or a serial killer.) We get to know the girls while they drive around in a car (a la Jules and Vincent in Pulp Fiction), and each scene gives us substantial chunks of witty dialogue and friends swapping in-jokes and teasing each other. It’s all very entertaining. In the second group’s case there’s also a *seven-minute* long take while the girls have a coffee. One of the bravura highlights of Tarantino’s career, it features four characters, fast-paced dialogue, a drifting camera tracking round the table, and glimpses of Stuntman Mike secretly watching them from afar. Check it out here:\n\nThe first half of the film – Julia, Arlene and Shanna’s story – acts as a primer for second. It gives us a blueprint for Mike’s plan, which of course goes wrong next time round. Kim, Abernathy and Zoe are tougher women and fight back. As they do so, the action scenes in the final quarter really are something – we get well-filmed muscle cars driving at high speeds, the rumble of engines and squeaks tof tyres, and of course Zoe Bell clinging to the hood for dear life. Yes, the film’s a bit on the flimsy side. It doesn’t especially *mean* anything. And Tarantino’s not the only person to consider Death Proof his worst film. At 67 per cent, it has the lowest score on Rotten Tomatoes for any QT-directed movie. But this is harsh. Death Proof is certainly Quentin’s least successful movie and probably his least loved – but that gives it an underdog quality. It’s ready to fight back.\n\nEight 1970 Dodge Challengers out of 10"
