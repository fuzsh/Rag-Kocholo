        "text": "With all due respect to Five, its impossible for UK audiences to gain the necessary perspective on this two-part climax of Americas most popular drama. From our side of the water, it looks like guest director Quentin Tarantino is slumming it, an über-fan messing around behind the camera. In the US, however, where this very special episode drew an audience of 30 million, this was QTs highest profile gig since Pulp Fiction. There is as much calculation as enthusiasm at play here  the last time he guest-directed a TV show, it was ER in 1995, when the medical drama was at the height of its fame. But Grave Danger is more authentically Tarantino, not least because he supplied the gruesome story.\n\nHes at his impish best when fucking with formula, which makes the procedural police drama a perfect playground. So while the pop culture references are QT-by-the-numbers, theres also a more fundamental subversion of the standard crime-suspect set-up. Tarantino makes particularly good use of the part one climax, creating a surprising structure that actually investigates the nature of investigation. However, this unusually emotional episode can really only be appreciated as part of the CSI franchise, which makes Grave Dangers DVD debut  out of sequence, and with only the five-year-old pilot providing context  a bit baffling. Wait for the Season 5 box set."
