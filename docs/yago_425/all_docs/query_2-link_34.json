        "text": "I love the 1970s. That era has been a cinematic sweet spot for me for as long as I can remember. I particularly dig the aesthetic associated with that time period. Most ‘70s pictures are bathed in earth tones as a result of the natural lighting trend, a shift that resulted from Technicolor fatigue. Almost all of the output from that era is easily identifiable based on the lighting techniques alone. I also appreciate that the ‘70s were a time of less studio interference where filmmakers were given a great deal more freedom. Moreover, Wall Street was decades away from entering the industry and gunning for safe IP-based ideas over unbridled creativity.\n\nIn my quest to consume as much of the cinematic output of that decade as possible, I stumbled upon an overlooked gem that I can’t wait to tell you all about. More specifically, I’m speaking of Daryl Duke and Curtis Hanson’s crime thriller The Silent Partner. This 1978 release is a fast-paced affair that features a charismatic lead, a twisty narrative, and a measure of dry wit.\n\nThe Silent Partner follows Miles Cullen (Elliott Gould), an unassuming teller who discovers evidence of a botched robbery attempt at the bank where he works. Miles isn’t sure what to make of the discovery at first. But as he begins to put the pieces together, he finds a way to get in on the next attempt and take a cut of the ill-begotten gains. The grift initially goes off without a hitch. But Miles finds himself in grave danger when the thief realizes he was cheated out of a substantial chunk of change.\n\nAlso Read: 10 Thrilling Netflix Films That’ll Have You On The Edge Of Your Seat\n\nMiles stands as a fascinating character with a compelling arc. At the beginning of this crime thriller, he’s unassuming and not terribly remarkable. The most exciting thing about him is that he collects exotic fish. Miles is so non-threatening, in fact, that his philandering boss asks him to keep his side piece company while he puts in an appearance on the home front. While he initially lacks the charisma one expects from a leading man, Miles makes tremendous personal growth through the course of the picture.\n\nElliott Gould proves a wise choice to play such a dynamic character as Miles. Gould was a good-looking man in his youth and possessed (still does) a certain versatility. He’s a sound choice to play the kind of character that’s often underestimated. Gould handles the transition from mild-mannered merchant teller to clandestine criminal flawlessly, giving us reason to believe the person he becomes has always been there within but was lying dormant until awakened by pulling off what might just be the perfect crime.\n\nIt’s enjoyable to watch Miles break out of his shell and come into his own. While the filmmakers certainly aren’t trying to tell us that we should do crime for kicks, there is an interesting case made for why playing it safe isn’t always the best option. Sometimes, we miss out on life when we do. As such, it’s important to take risks under the right circumstances.\n\nAlso Read: Don’t Believe The Hate: ‘Mine Games’ Is Thrilling and Scrappy [The Overlooked Motel]\n\nIn addition to a compelling leading man with a fascinating character arc, The Silent Partner is also noteworthy for taking the narrative in a series of unexpected directions. Screenwriters Curtis Hanson (who co-directs) and Anders Bodelsen deliver a series of smart subversions of expectations that keep the proceedings from becoming stale or predictable. There are double-crosses and shifts of loyalty likely to keep you on your toes and engaged for the duration. There’s a consistent ‘who’s pulling one over on whom’ dynamic at play.\n\nSubversions of expectations aside, this overlooked thriller also possesses a sly sense of humor. The comedy isn’t of the ‘laugh out loud’ variety but it’s still plenty comical. The newest employee at the bank where Miles works shows up in a variety of T-shirts that take banking terminology out of context to give the jargon a sexually suggestive connotation. One of her more memorable tops says ‘Penalty for Early Withdrawal’. That wry wit can also be seen in the dialogue and exchanges between characters. Miles has some great one-liners throughout that induce a chuckle but the subtle nature of the humor ensures the baseline of tension isn’t interrupted by the occasional comical aside.\n\nThe Silent Partner is a memorable showcase for Elliott Gould that takes viewers on a fast-paced journey with multiple twists and turns. If you’ve yet to experience this one for yourself, I enthusiastically implore you to give this 1978 thriller a watch. If you’re keen to check the picture out, you can scope it free on Kanopy as of the publication of this post. The service is open to almost anyone with a library card or college ID."
