        "text": "This week brings an eclectic mix of new horror movies, including NEON’s latest in theaters, the return of Terrifier 2‘s Lauren LaVera, and even an unofficial Mickey Mouse slasher movie.\n\nHere’s all the new horror releasing August 5 – August 11, 2024!\n\nFor daily reminders about new horror releases, be sure to follow @HorrorCalendar.\n\nWith the short film Steamboat Willie (1928) in the public domain, horror filmmakers are now free to play around with that early incarnation of Mickey Mouse, and that’s exactly what director Jamie Bailey is doing in the new indie slasher movie The Mouse Trap.\n\nGravitas Ventures released The Mouse Trap on VOD this past Tuesday.\n\nIn the horror movie, “It’s Alex’s 21st birthday, but she’s stuck at the amusement arcade on a late shift so her friends decide to surprise her, but a masked killer dressed as Mickey Mouse decides to play a game of his own with them which she must survive.”\n\nJamie Bailey tells Bloody Disgusting, “The Mouse Trap film is famously the first horror film to use the Mickey Mouse character from Steamboat Willie. We just wanted to have fun with it all. I mean it’s Steamboat Willie‘s Mickey Mouse murdering people. It’s ridiculous. We ran with it and had fun doing it and I think it shows.”\n\nSophie McIntosh, Callum Sywyk, Allegra Nocita, Ben Harris, Damir Kovic, Mackenzie Mills, Nick Biskupek and Simon Phillips star in The Mouse Trap. The film comes courtesy of Into Frame Productions from partners Jamie Bailey and Simon Phillips (“FUBAR”).\n\nAnother new indie horror movie released this past Tuesday, Ganymede is described as a campy Southern Gothic thriller from life and creative partners Colby Holt and Sam Probst.\n\nGanymede made its world premiere at the 41st Reeling International Film Festival, where the film took home the Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature Film. At the Chattanooga Film Festival, the film won the Pride Award. It’s now available on VOD outlets.\n\nIn Ganymede, “When a small town wrestling star develops a crush on an openly gay classmate, he begins to be stalked by a grotesque creature that invades his thoughts, all the while struggling to live up to the standard set by his legacy-obsessed dad.”\n\nThe LGBTQ+ thriller stars Jordan Doww (Reach), Pablo Castelblanco (“Alaska Daily”, “Happy’s Place”), David Koechner (Anchorman, Cheap Thrills), Robyn Lively (Teen Witch), Joe Chrest (“Stranger Things”) and Marissa Reyes (“Raven’s Home”).\n\nUp next from writer/director Tilman Singer (Luz) is NEON’s Cuckoo starring Hunter Schafer (“Euphoria”), which will be released exclusively in theaters on Friday, August 9.\n\nIn Cuckoo: “Reluctantly, 17-year-old Gretchen leaves her American home to live with her father, who has just moved into a resort in the German Alps with his new family. Arriving at their future residence, they are greeted by Mr. König, her father’s boss, who takes an inexplicable interest in Gretchen’s mute half-sister Alma. Something doesn’t seem right in this tranquil vacation paradise. Gretchen is plagued by strange noises and bloody visions until she discovers a shocking secret that also concerns her own family.”\n\nDan Stevens (The Guest), Jessica Henwick (Underwater), Marton Csókás (Freelance), Greta Fernández (Santo) and Jan Bluthardt (Luz) also star in Cuckoo.\n\nMeagan wrote in her review out of SXSW, “There’s inventive worldbuilding on display that sets this high-concept horror movie apart and a few intense horror cat-and-mouse scenes that deliver palpable tension. But Singer approaches it with a playful sense of humor that only further nudges Cuckoo into the realm of weird cinema. It’s so refreshingly unconventional and unpredictable in every way, right down to its raucous, entertainingly silly finale, that it’s hard to care about all of the plot that gets discarded along the way.”\n\nNeil Marshall (Dog Soldiers, The Descent, Hellboy) returns this week with Duchess, a rated “R” action thriller from Saban Films that will be hitting VOD outlets on Friday, August 9.\n\nIn the film, “Duchess (Charlotte Kirk), a small-time crook, tries to enter the treacherous underworld of diamond trafficking and ends up left for dead when a deal goes wrong. Determined to seek retribution she launches into an unwavering pursuit for vengeance.”\n\nNeill Marshall directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Charlotte Kirk.\n\nPhilip Winchester, Colm Meaney, Hoji Fortuna, Colin Egglesfield, Stephanie Beachum, Sean Pertwee, David Chevers, Boris Martinez, Alex Morgan, and Yan Tual also star.\n\nEvil has new depths in Federico Zampaglione‘s upcoming horror movie The Well, which puts Terrifier 2 and Terrifier 3 star Lauren LaVera into another bloody battle for survival.\n\nThe Well is first arriving in select theaters this Friday, August 9 before arriving On Digital and On Demand September 3, 2024 via Uncork’d Entertainment.\n\nThe Well stars Lauren LaVera (Terrifier 2), as Lisa Gray, a budding art restorer, who travels to a small Italian village to bring a medieval painting back to its former glory, unaware of the danger from an evil curse and a monster born of myth and brutal pain.\n\n“On behalf of her father, a young American art restorer travels to a remote Italian village to bring a medieval painting back to its former glory. There she meets a beautiful but aging duchess and her troubled young daughter who warns her that the painting is cursed and that she must leave before she falls prey to an evil witch who drinks the blood of tourists to achieve eternal life.”\n\nThe Well was directed by Italian pop star Federico Zampaglione (Shadow, Tulpa: Demon of Desire, Morrison), who co-wrote the script with Stefano Masi."
