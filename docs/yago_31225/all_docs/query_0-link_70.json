        "text": "Part 3 of an occasional series; Failed States.\n\nOttokar II\n\nOttokar II, known as the Iron and Golden King, was a member of the Přemyslid dynasty who reigned as King of Bohemia from 1253 until his death in 1278. He also held the titles of Margrave of Moravia from 1247, Duke of Austria from 1251, Duke of Styria from 1260, as well as Duke of Carinthia and Margrave of Carniola from 1269.\n\nWith Ottokar's rule, the Přemyslids reached the peak of their power in the Holy Roman Empire. His expectations of the imperial crown, however, were never fulfilled.\n\nEarly Days\n\nOttokar was the second son of King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia. He was related to the Holy Roman Emperors of the Hohenstaufen dynasty through his mother, Kunigunde, daughter of Philip of Swabia. This gave him Imperial claims when they became extinct in the male line upon the execution of King Conradin of Sicily in 1268.\n\nOttokar was never meant to be ruler, he was educated for the role of an ecclesiastical administrator, while his elder brother Vladislaus was designated heir of the Bohemian Kingdom.\n\nWhen Vladislaus died in 1247, Ottokar became the heir to the Bohemian throne. He was shocked by his brother's death and did not involve himself in politics, becoming focused on hunting and drinking.\n\nWenceslaus appointed Ottokar as Margrave of Moravia where he took up residence in Brno and occupied himself with the reconstruction of the Moravian lands devastated by the Mongol raids of 1242.\n\nIn 1248 some discontented nobles enticed him into leading a rebellion against his father. He temporarily expelled his father from Prague Castle and held the title of King of Bohemia until November 1249.\n\nHowever, Pope Innocent IV excommunicated Ottokar, now lacking support, Wenceslaus finally managed to defeat the rebels and imprisoned his son at Přimda Castle.\n\nThe last Babenberg Duke of Austria, Frederick II died in the Battle of the Leitha River in 1246.\n\nWenceslaus had attempted to acquire Austria by marrying Vladislaus to the Duke's niece Gertrude of Babenberg. That marriage ended after half a year with Vladislaus's death, in January 1247. Gertrude married the Zähringen Margrave Herman VI of Baden but Herman was rejected by the Austrian nobility and could not establish his rule.\n\nEventually reconciled, Wenceslaus and Ottokar cooperated towards acquiring the Duchy of Austria. Wenceslaus released Ottokar and, in 1251, again made him Margrave of Moravia and installed him, with the approval of the Austrian nobles, as governor of Austria. To legitimize his position, Ottokar married the late Duke Frederick II's sister Margaret of Babenberg, widow of the Hohenstaufen King Henry VII of Germany and 26 years his senior, at Hainburg in 1252. Ottokar also became Duke of Styria, which since 1192 had been ruled in personal union with Austria under the terms of the Georgenberg Pact of 1186.\n\nIn 1253 King Wenceslaus died and Ottokar succeeded his father as King of Bohemia.\n\nAs King Ottokar II\n\nAfter the death of the German King Konrad IV in 1254 while his son, Conradin, was still a minor, Ottokar also hoped to obtain the Imperial dignity, as King of the Romans, for himself. However, his election bid was unsuccessful and Count William II of Holland, the German anti-king since 1247, was generally recognised.\n\nThreatened by Ottokar's growing power his cousin King Béla IV of Hungary formed a loose alliance with the Wittelsbach Duke Otto II of Bavaria and tried to install his son Stephen as Duke of Styria. Papal mediation settled the short conflict : in 1254 both agreed that Ottokar would yield large parts of Styria to Béla in exchange for recognition of his right to the remainder of Austria. In return for Papal mediation, King Ottokar II led two crusades against the pagan Old Prussians [1254-1255 and again in 1268]. Königsberg [now Kaliningrad], founded in 1255 by the Teutonic Order, was named in his honour and later became the capital of the Duchy of Prussia.\n\nAfter a few years the conflict with Hungary resumed. Ottokar defeated the Hungarians in July 1260 at the Battle of Kressenbrunn, ending years of disputes over Styria with Béla IV.\n\nBéla now ceded Styria back to Ottokar, and his claim to those territories was formally recognized by Richard of Cornwall, then King of Germany and nominal ruler of all the German lands. This peace agreement was also sealed by a royal marriage. Ottokar ended his marriage to Margaret of Babenberg and married Béla's young granddaughter Kunigunda of Halych.\n\nTheir son later became Wenceslaus II.\n\nExpansion\n\nDuring the Imperial Imperial interregnum of 1250 to 1273, Ottokar increased his personal influence while Richard of Cornwall and Alfonso of Castile jostled to attain the Imperial dignity.\n\nOttokar exacted influence over a number of relatives, allies and vassals in Germany, such as the Margraviate of Brandenburg and spiritual principalities, including the Archbishopric of Salzburg and the Patriarchate of Aquileia.\n\nAfter the death of Konradin in 1268 he was an heir of the House of Hohenstaufen's claim to the imperial crown. However was content with informal influence in Germany. He was appointed protector of the Royal Domains of the Holy Roman Empire east of the Rhine by the German King, Richard of Cornwall. He held this office till 1273.\n\nIn 1266 he occupied the Egerland in north-west Bohemia, and in 1268 he signed an inheritance treaty with the Sponheim Duke Ulrich III of Carinthia, succeeding him in Carinthia, Carniola and the Windic March the next year. In 1272 he also acquired Friuli.\n\nHis rule was again contested by the Hungarians on the field of battle. After another victory, Ottokar became the most powerful king within the Empire.\n\nAfter Richard of Cornwall died in April 1272 Pope Gregory X rejected the claims raised by Alfonso of Castile.\n\nA new election for the Imperial German throne took place in 1273. However, Ottokar again failed to gain the Imperial crown. The electors voted for Ottokar's rival, Rudolf of Habsburg.\n\nOttokar refused to acknowledge Rudolf's election, and urged the Pope to adopt a similar policy. At the Imperial Diet of Nuremberg in 1274, Rudolf decreed that all Imperial lands that had changed hands since the death of the Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick II must be returned to the crown. This would have deprived Ottokar not only of the Egerland, but also of the Austrian, Styrian, and Carinthian Duchies. In 1275 Rudolf placed Ottokar under the Imperial ban and him in Vienna, while a rebellion disrupted the Bohemian lands.\n\nThis compelled Ottokar to sign a new treaty by which he gave up all claims to Austria and the neighboring Duchies in 1276, retaining for himself only Bohemia and Moravia. Ottokar's son Wenceslaus became betrothed to Rudolf's daughter Judith. There followed an uneasy peace.\n\nTwo years later, Ottokar made a last attempt to recover his lost lands. Ottokar allied himself with Bavaria, Brandenburg and Poland. He collected a large army to meet the forces of Rudolf and his ally King Ladislaus IV of Hungary.\n\nIn the Battle on the Marchfeld on 26 August 1278 he was defeated and killed. His 6-year-old son Wenceslaus II, succeededing him as King of Bohemia, was unable to carry on the fight.\n\nLegacy\n\nOttokar II is considered one of the greatest Kings of Bohemia. He founded about 30 new towns , not only in Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, but also in Austria and Styria. He incorporated many existing settlements through civic charters, giving them new privileges. He was a strong proponent of trade, law and order. Furthermore, he instituted open immigration policies through which skilled German-speaking immigrants settled in major cities throughout his domains.\n\nBy supporting the city of Jihlava with its mines, he laid foundation of the silver wealth of later Bohemian Kings. Privileges of civic charters usually excluded the towns from obedience to the traditional courts held by members of nobility. This can be seen as a step towards equality and a precursor of modern civil law.\n\nIn the country, Ottokar's introduction of the Law of Emphyteusis freed subjects from feudal obligations, except for rent and tax, if such was levied.\n\nOttokar followed a systematic policy of strengthening his domains by building fortifications. Besides supporting towns, he built many fortresses himself and also induced his vassals to build castles. A sign of rising strength of Bohemia, it was also a reaction to the Mongol raids of the 13th century. Conflict for the title of ownership to these fortified places built by members of nobility was probably the source of the uprising in 1276, which cost Ottokar the Austrian lands.\n\nSome of the fortresses built by Ottokar were for centuries the strongest in Bohemia.\n\nWhat if?\n\nIf Ottokar had become Emperor or the result of the Battle on the Marchfeld had been different, what would have been the fate of the Habsburg dynasty.\n\nCould the Habsburgs have survived and thrived without their Austrian power-base?\n\nHow would a strong Slavic-German Kingdom have dealt with first Anjevin and then Ottoman threats?\n\nWould the Holy Roman Empire have become virtually hereditary under the Přemyslids?\n\nLines in the Sand\n\n​\n\nThis is a world where, for whatever reason, the lines established by the Treaties of Tordesillas and Zaragoza have been roughly followed for centuries. Both the Portuguese and Spanish Empires have kept steady and are, in fact, the two premier powers of the world. Despite these centuries of colonization, however, both sides have avoided major wars between each other and have respected the meridians established in 1494 and 1529 respectively.\n\nThis has allowed both Portugal (under the House of Aviz) and Spain, more accurately described as the Habsburg Empire to maintain their positions as the preeminent powers in the world. This makes João III in Lisbon and Charles XIV in Madrid the two most powerful men in the world with considerable sway in both their own domains and the wider world. A number of Spain’s far-flung colonial provinces have been divided up into numerous Viceroyalties, where lieutenants appointed by the crown govern in the name of the Habsburg monarchy. Other regions report directly to Madrid while there are still other lands where Habsburgs sit on the throne and are loyal to the senior member of their family, Charles of Spain, but are not his vassals. The Habsburgs are perhaps the most devout Catholics in all the world and are very friendly with the Pope and very supportive of attempts to root out heretics and non-Christians. The family is, however, incredibly inbred and has had a run of poor monarchs recently. Charles XIV appears to be an exception and is a powerful, cunning man with a strong faith.\n\nPortugal, on the other hand, is a much more united empire. The old comarca system established in the 15th century has roughly been maintained, though many of the old provinces have been combined. In theory, comarcas (provinces) from Lavrador to the Philippines are equal, though the European and Brasilian provinces are better off and hold more sway in the Cortes. While not by any means the paragon of tolerance, Portugal (and Spain, actually) have retained the racial-based caste system and while it is true that whites dominate the government and military, there are numerous powerful mixed-race merchants, sailors, landowners, and military officers. Portugal itself has a moderately-sized population of Africans and Asians, something that can be seen in all of the major mercantile cities of Europe and its colonies.\n\nCatholicism still dominates the Christian world. Protestantism came into existence and even was adopted in some kingdoms, but in the end the growing power of Spain and Portugal was enough to drown out Protestantism and restore Catholicism (at the cost of many thousands of lives in massacres and wars) By 1905, the heads of state every monarchist Western European nation (as well as numerous kings in other regions) pays respect to Pius XII. Numerous heresies exist, most of them decrying the Papacy as wrong in and of itself or in its current form. Throughout much of Europe, these heretics are punished severely, and though burnings have more or less been phased out, imprisonment is frequently used. Jews have not fared especially well.\n\nAbsolutism has remained more or less in the vogue. Both Portugal and Spain are still absolute monarchies, and the same is also true of most of the European states. England is something of a bastion of constitutionalism, as the power of Parliament has grown as the nobles are more or less united in their quest to curb the power of the king. The Nordic states of Denmark-Prussia and Sweden have also followed in England’s footsteps, but have more robust monarchies. Of course, not everyone is enthusiastic about absolutism. A subculture of republican, anti-episcopal, nationalistic secret societies has grown in Europe through the past century and though these forces have risen up periodically, they only ever managed any significant success in Poland in the 1880s.\n\nThe technological advances in Europe have largely seeped into the parts of Africa under their rule. A railroad stretches from the Atlantic across the Guinea Highlands to Mali, planned by Portuguese engineers but built by slaves. The Kongo Kingdom has enthusiastically adopted many European inventions and has introduced steam boats along the Congo River. Even the Portuguese are becoming nervous that their stranglehold on Africa might be broken by a strong, technological power native to the continent.\n\nThough much of it has, there are still several states in Europe that have managed to stay out of the orbit of the two global powers. Though strong powers in their own right, they are no match for Portugal and the Habsburgs and would surely lose a head-on confrontation – only discretion has kept them independent this long. Though some minor defensive pacts exist, attempts at creating a bloc opposed to both Iberian powers have always fallen through.\n\nThere though, the success of the republicans success was astonishing. The monarchy of the 1870s, under Kazimir IV, was widely disliked and rather despotic. Discontent in the streets and villages led to revolt, which led to the King exiled and a series of wars to put Kazimir back on the throne - the Polish Revolutionary Wars. Though the armies of the revolution were comprised of peasants, many illiterate, they were led by the intelligentsia of the merchant class that transformed the concept of Turanism into a formidable item of propaganda used to unite the Slavs, Balts, and Turks of Eastern Europe into a single, republican state. Despite the best attempts of the Danes, Spanish, Hungarians, and Russians to bring the peasant armies to their knees, the Turanian Union secured its independence in 1891. It remains on vigilant, fearful that the outside world might one day attempt to end republicanism once and for all. And surely they will one day attack, for the Tsar sits fuming in Moscow, hopeful that one day the lands taken during the Revolutionary Wars will be brought back into the fold.\n\nBut republicanism has not been contained as much as the kings in Lisbon, Madrid, Buda, and Cairo had hoped. Its tendrils, manifesting itself in the form of student advocate groups can be found as far afield as the Americas and Portuguese India, but while there have been outbreaks of violence and rebellion by these groups, they are few and far between. A much more potent force have been revolts by the Maroons of Africa. The descendants of Portuguese slavemasters, Native Americans brought across the Atlantic, and Africans moved far from their homelands in chains, the Maroons appeared as a distinct ethnic group across the world never quite fitting in wherever they were. Slave rebellions are recorded as far back as there have been slaves, but the Maroons began rebelling in larger numbers around 1810 and though they had little success in revolts, runaways experienced more favorable outcomes and established communities that developed into the Maroon Republics outside the borders of European and African control. In recent decades, many of these states (which in some cases are more accurately described as monarchies) have bought into the ideals of republicanism and are loosely aligned with Turania. Though some of the republics permit their inhabitants to have slaves, they are by and large opposed to slavery within the Portuguese Empire but on a daily basis, they are much more preoccupied on defending against attempts by Portuguese colonial police to destroy them and are in no position to launch offensives of their own.\n\nMost of Africa outside of Portuguese and Habsburg direct rule or their spheres of influence is pre-industrial and though European technology has made its way even deep into the jungles and savannas, African states have not adopted industrial technology. Ethiopia is the exception and has fared better than most of the continent owing to their Christianity. Nestled between Portuguese Punt and Habsburg Egypt, Ethiopia is unwilling to get into bed with either of them and walks a thin rope as it tries to avoid antagonizing either of them.\n\nThe Islamic world has seen happier days. The old Ottoman dominion has collapsed over the last several centuries, with Christian, European colonies riddling the Eastern Mediterranean. The Sixth Turco-Spanish War, which ended in 1798, was the nail in the coffin for the Empire and in its aftermath the House of Osman was relegated to a small section of the Anatolian interior, while the Muslim Bulgars jumped ship. Notably, Palestine and Syria were handed to the Venetians, who have since used the region to turn quite a profit. To the east, Persia is still chugging along and slowly modernizing with the help of its loose alliance with Portugal. In recent decades, Persian kings have made threatening gestures toward the west and some believe that in time, it might end its age-old rival, the House Osman, once and for all. Conquests in Africa have not managed to root out Islam despite the attempts of millions of monks. Along the coast though, Christianity has come to dominate, and even in the interior provinces the number of Muslims declines by the day. Islam is doing well for itself in Asia and even the Mongol Khan in Kharkorin is a Sunni.\n\nMuch of Asia has seen better days. The old Chinese Empire has fallen to the Manchu Qing Dynasty which has been in decline for the better part of the last century. The southern provinces have broken away outright while Portuguese and Habsburg influence is only growing and creating ever-larger cultural divides that put the peasant class on edge. In Southeast Asia, the Thai-speaking Kingdom of Phitsanulok has drifted into the Portuguese sphere while Vietnam and the Kmers have adopted modern technology in a bid to remain independent. The Habsburg-chartered Nippon Company, originally founded to trade with Japan, has evolved into a power of its own that in addition to dominating trade between Siberia and Europe sees the Emperor in Osaka pay homage to the company offices in San Pedro (OTL Katangili, Sakhalin) Only in India has Asia managed to fight back against European imperialism. The Patna Kingdom grew from a minor statelet in a region full of turmoil to the preeminent Hindu power in the subcontinent in 75 years. Though small, it has a vast population and alliances with its neighbors that make it formidable and a thorn in the side of the Portuguese (who, ironically, are somewhat responsible for its rise)"
