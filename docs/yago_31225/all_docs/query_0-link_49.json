If you feel like supporting the show and bathe in my eternal gratitude, you can do so on patreon.com/historyofthegermans or in the support section of my website.\n\nSo, the empire, or as it is called in 1250, the Holy Roman Empire. What is it, and more precisely, where is it? That sounds like a simple question.\n\nThe Territory of the Empire\n\nLet’s just look at a map like the one entitled “The empire of the Hohenstaufen 1138-1268” which you can find in the map section of my website Historyofthegermans.com. That is quite neat with external borders and internal subdivisions into the different princely territories.\n\nThe problem is that such a map is completely anachronistic. The earliest maps that showed territorial borders date from the 14th century. If you look at a map like the Mappa Mundi in Hereford cathedral made around the year 1300 you will find that in the medieval mind the center of the world was Jerusalem. There are cities and important cathedrals and castles shown, but the map does not tell you who these belong to politically. Medieval people did not think in terms of territory. They were much more focused on the relationships and networks, castles, towns, cities, their connections by roads and rivers. The way to think about political structures is to look at them as personal relationships.\n\nIn the early times of the Carolingian and Ottonian empire, the emperor claimed a universal responsibility for the whole of Christendom. As a successor of the Caesars of antiquity he had a claim to the whole world and effective imperium over those parts that acknowledged Christianity as their religion. Every free Christian was bound to the emperor and every pagan was to be converted and thereby made his subject. That is why Charlemagne felt it was his job to conquer and convert the pagan Saxons in the late 8th century and then incorporate Saxony into the empire. It may also explain why Frederick II believed he could grant the Teutonic Knights the lands of the pagan Prussians, thousands of miles away and separated from the empire by Poland.\n\nThis universal idea of the empire never really went away, and emperors kept insisting on their role as the defender of Christendom and hence superior rank over regular kings. But actual power and influence was concentrated in those territories that accepted the emperor as their direct overlord. The empire was wherever the dukes, counts, bishops etc., accepted that they held their lands as fiefs from the emperor. This could theoretically be in far away lands, like when the king of Armenia wanted to be crowned by emperor Barbarossa. It also meant in the reverse that if a prince refused to accept the obligations of vassalage and the emperor failed to bring him to heel, the territory would leave the empire.\n\nTraditionally the empire is seen as comprising 3 kingdoms.\n\nThese kingdoms were the regnum Teutonicum, the German Kingdom which had emerged from the old East Francian sub-kingdom of the empire of Charlemagne comprising the duchies of Franconia, Swabia, Bavaria and Saxony. Henry the Fowler added Lothringia, which included modern day Netherlands, parts of Belgium, Luxemburg and a chunk of eastern France on the line Liege, Verdun to Toul. On the eastern side this kingdom originally ended on the Elbe river, but the eastern expansion that started in the 10th century and really got momentum in the 12th century pushed the borders of the empire eastwards. The three kingdoms on the eastern flank, Poland, Bohemia and Hungary were initially in some sort of vassalage to the emperor, however, Hungary and Poland were able to wiggle out of this subordination during the 11th century. Poland by refusing vassalage and winning a war against Henry II, Hungary by submitting under the direct overlordship of the pope. Only Bohemia, roughly modern day Czechia, remained part of the empire and its ruler even became one of the seven Electors.\n\nThen there was the kingdom of Italy, originally the kingdom of the Lombards who had conquered Northern Italy from the Alpine passes to Rome. Charlemagne had ousted the last of the Lombard kings and the kingdom of Italy was held by his descendants until the late 9th century when there was a brief period of separate Italian kings. Otto the Great removed the last of that line and from then on, with a brief interlude during the reign of Henry II, the emperor was automatically king of Italy, by which is meant Northern Italy.\n\nThe third kingdom was the Kingdom of Burgundy. That was another Kingdom, or more precisely set of kingdoms and counties that comprised the Franche Comte, Western Switzerland and The Rhone Valley and Provence. Burgundy was the last kingdom to join the empire in the 1030s under Konrad II and it was also the most decentralized.\n\nThough these were three separate kingdoms, an emperor did not need to be separately elected and crowned in each of them. Some did like Barbarossa who got crowned in Aachen, Monza and Arles as well as in Rome. But it wasn’t necessary.\n\nIn fact though the German kingdom was a kingdom, there was no election or coronation to be king of the Germans either. The election performed with very few exceptions by the princes in the regnum Teutonicum and the coronation in Aachen was to be King of the Romans. The King of the Romans was automatically king of all three kingdoms and – most importantly – the future emperor. To become emperor however, the king of the Romans had to go to Rome and be crowned by the Pope. To add to the confusion no king of the Romans or emperor had real power in Rome ever since Otto III had been thrown out of the Holy City in 1002. But the title stuck until about 1508. Napoleon resurrected the concept when he made his son the King of Rome, a sort of stage in the process of becoming emperor.\n\nThe Economy of the Empire\n\nThe territory sort of clarified, let’s take a look at the economy.\n\nThe general perception that the Middle Ages was a period of stagnation could not be further from the truth. The time from 900 to 1300 was a boom time for Europe. The so-called medieval warming period allowed for an abundance of crops, including vineyards in the London suburb I live in. Agricultural efficiency grew exponentially thanks to the transition from ancient slave economy to free or at least semi-free labour, the developments of new forms of ploughs and the horse collar as well as the increase in demand for cash crops like wool used by the dyers and weavers in the growing cities. As population grew, more and more land was brought into cultivation. The forest that covered the entirety of the lands east of the Rhine during Antiquity literally vanished and had to be replanted in the 18th and 19th century. And crucially the movement of settlers into the lands East of the Elbe and then further into Silesia, Poland, Prussia and Livonia swelled food production further.\n\nMining started in the 10th century near Goslar and its silver allowed for the minting of coins and hence monetarization of the economy. A 100 years later even larger reserves of silver and copper were found in the aptly named Ore Mountains between Bohemia and Saxony. Famously the mine at Joachimsthal in Bohemia gave us the word Thaler, which then via its Spanish derivation became the Dollar. German miners were much in demand across Europe, developing pits as far away as the great Swedish deposits in Falun.\n\nAll that growth did not happen only in the countryside. There had been some ancient Roman cities in the regnum Teutonicum, Cologne, Mainz, Trier, Strasburg, Augsburg, Regensburg, Salzburg and Vienna, but all cities east of there and many in the west too were established during the Middle Ages. They were founded by ambitious kings and princes keen on the riches these places could generate. If you go down the list of the 10 largest cities in Germany today: Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Stuttgart, Dusseldorf, Dortmund, Essen and Leipzig have been founded in the Middle Ages, only 2 of them, Cologne and to a degree Frankfurt are former Roman settlements.\n\nTrade flourished as the Northern Italian cities rebuild connections across the mediterranean and brough luxury goods north either across the Alps or via the Rhone River. From there the South-North Trade followed either the Burgundian valley or the Rhine River to the great fairs of Champagne and later the main cities of Flanders, Bruges and Ghent. These trade routes were age old, but during the Middle Ages Old Roman roads were rebuild and some, like the Gotthard pass were made viable for the first time.\n\nWhat gave the empire an additional boost were new trade connections that had been of negligible importance in the past, the East West and North-South trade. One part of this story is the story of the Hanseatic league which brought scale to the trade in furs and beeswax from Nowgorod before developing a much larger trade in salted and dried fish to feed Catholic Europe with its hundreds of fast days. As shipping capacity increased trade in grain, wood and ash became viable, allowing the great trading centers in Flanders to sustain themselves. Other trade routes were the Via Regia that connected Smolensk, Kyiv and Moscow with Leipzig and Nurnberg via Krakow and Breslau/Wroclaw as well as the roads along the Danube and south through the Balkans.\n\nBottom line, the High Middle Ages were Boom times. How anyone can look at the skylines of Paris, Munich, Cologne, Milan or Barcelona and think otherwise is a mystery to me. The tallest pre 1850 buildings in many European cities are the spires of their Gothic cathedrals, true miracles in stonemasonry and even more astounding, architecture and statics.\n\nWhat is hard to reconcile are these manifest witnesses to growth and prosperity with the narrative of never-ending wars and conflicts. How could a city thrive and its merchants transport goods all across Europe when one local lord or other besieged them every two years and robbers attacked the goods trains? The answer must be that these attacks were less frequent and less ferocious than we imagine them. Sieges usually lasted only a few days because if the place could not be taken by surprise, medieval armies rarely had the equipment or the patience for a drawn-out siege. Merchants travelled together in groups, were pretty deft with the swords themselves and hired local thugs to help defending them.\n\nProviding safety was the key job of a medieval ruler, which gets us to the imperial administration.\n\nThe Pope and the Emperor\n\nWhen the Ottonian kings and emperors took over in the 10th century practically nobody could read or write, except for clerics. And administration of an empire that stretched from Rome to Hamburg and from Magdeburg to Lyon required letters. How else could imperial orders be conveyed to the dukes and counts hundreds or thousands of miles away, how else could rights and privileges be confirmed.\n\nThe Ottonians and later the early Salians were very happy to use clerics in their chancellery and saw little need to build up their own secular bureaucrats. And that is because the church was very much beholden to the emperor. As in Byzantium the head of the church was a subordinate of the emperor. From Otto I until Henry III the emperors could appoint the pope often without asking the congregation in Rome and even where the pope had been elected by the Romans, the emperor could overrule and even depose him. The college of Cardinals as a body to elect the pope simply did not yet exist. Churches and monasteries were seen as private property, essentially prayer factories meant to ease the way of the local lord through purgatory.\n\nAnother advantage was that these prelates had no legitimate offspring and could hence not pass their job on to their sons. Every time a bishop passed, the emperor had a material influence in the decision who would be appointed next. Therefore the emperors shifted more and more of their administrative tasks on to the bishops. Bishops were given entire counties to administer, to mint coins, to collect taxes and tolls, to muster armies and send them to the emperor and so on and so on.\n\nBy the mid 11th century, this system came under immense pressure from two sides.\n\nThe first one was the rise of lay piety.\n\nOne of the side effects of rising prosperity is that people increasingly find the time to ask themselves nagging questions, such as, why are things happening to me or to my community, why am I here, what happens to me when I die, what is the right way to live. And in the Middle Ages the answer to all these questions was religion, if something bad happens to you, it is because you have sinned, worshipping god is what humans are here on earth for, and if you are pious and live a life that pleases god, you go to heaven.\n\nAll this required an intermediary between the people and God, and that intermediary was the church. Which on the one hand gives the church enormous power, but also enormous responsibility. If the church fails to function as an effective intermediary because of corruption, lack of knowledge of the scriptures or other moral failings, whole communities are consigned to eternal damnation. And so the people, from the lowest peasant to the emperor demanded that the church cleans up its act. Greedy prelates who paraded their concubines through the streets were attacked by the townsfolk. Dissolute monasteries were subjected to strict discipline and lazy monks expelled. Monastic orders like the Cluniacs, the Cistercians and the Franciscans came into being attempting to live an austere, apostolic lifestyle. Their example put further pressure on the church hierarchy to shift from worldly desires to spiritual objectives.\n\nThis bottom-up push for a better church was complemented by a top down movement known as the reform papacy. Usually focused on Gregory VII but starting much earlier and persisting well beyond his time in office, the reform papacy fundamentally altered the role of the vicar of Christ. The popes had lost much of their spiritual authority when it had become the plaything of the Roman Aristocracy during the 9th and 10th century who happily put debauched 18-year olds on the throne of Saint Peter. One pope even sold the papal throne for cold hard cash. Emperor Henry III had to depose 3 popes in 1046, since all of them were profoundly unsuited for the role.\n\nHe replaced them with a sequence of German prelates, one of whom, Leo IX initiated a first set of reforms that were then pushed further by his successors. The popes changed their lifestyle to one more suitable to a religious leader, members of the curia were chosen on knowledge of canon law and scripture, a college of cardinals was established to elect the pope and theologians tried to consolidate the teachings of Christ.\n\nThough the emperors had proactively supported the reforms of the papacy – pious laymen they were – the changed standing of the pope and with it the changed status of church now caused a huge headache. A reformed church should be able to organize its own affairs, in particular choose and invest its bishops and abbots based on religious criteria. That would be o.k. if bishops and abbots were just spiritual leaders of their flock. But as we said before, by 1077 they had become the effective administration of the empire alongside their duties as churchmen. Pope and Emperor clashed over the question who had the right to appoint, i.e., invest the bishops and abbots.\n\nThis conflict has become known as the Investiture Controversy, though the decision about who appoints and invests bishops and abbots was only one part of the conflict. It was also a conflict about superiority. Gregory VII and his successors took the view that the pope is the head of all Christendom and all monarchs have to bow to him. He even declared that he could depose any monarch, even an emperor. The emperors responded with the “two swords” theory whereby emperor and pope stood side by side, the pope yielding the sword of spiritual power and the emperor that of secular power.\n\nThe Concordat of Worms from 1122 is supposed to have put this conflict to bed. The compromise laid out within it suggested the bishops and abbots get invested with their spiritual authority by the pope and with their secular authority by the emperor. This kind of compromise was pretty similar to what had been agreed in France and England around the same time. But whilst in France and England the church and monarch reconciled and the ecclesiastical hierarchy was gradually brought back under the control of the ruler, this was not the case in the medieval empire. The conflict between pope and emperor continued well beyond the Concordat of Worms.\n\nThe Empire and the Princes\n\nThe reason the conflict between the pope and the monarch was so much fiercer in the empire compared to other medieval monarchies was only in part down to the competition over who was the universal defenders of Christianity. It had also a lot to do with the role of the princes.\n\nWhat is a prince? In the empire a prince is not defined as the eldest son and successor to the monarch, but is a specific rank in the imperial hierarchy. An imperial prince, a Reichsfurst is someone who has received a fief from the emperor directly, as opposed to having received it from another noble. A prince could be a duke or count, but a bishop or abbot could also be a prince. Being a prince came with a set or rights and privileges, many of which had been regalia, i.e., had been the rights associated with kingship, such as the right to call in taxes and tolls, build castles and bridges, mint coins etc.\n\nThe first structural conflict between the emperor and his high aristocrats dates back to the mid 11th century, to the time of the emperors Henry III and then Henry IV. When Henry III comes to the throne in 1039 the empire had gone through a long period of consolidation of power in the hands of just one man. Henry the Fowler had started out in 919 very much as a Primus inter Pares, a First Amongst Equals, but already his son Otto the Great had assumed a more elevated position when he sat himself down on the throne of Charlemagne in Aachen. As time went by, control tightened, the imperial families gained more and more titles and more and more land and rights shifted into the administration of the imperial bishops and abbots.\n\nBy the 1050s the emperors introduced a new tool to further strengthen their administrative grip. They increasingly employed so-called Ministeriales. These were unfree men trained as either fighters or administrators. These men were bound to the emperor due to their status as unfree serfs. They did not have the rights and freedoms a true knights had, who had voluntarily entered into the mutual obligations of vassalage. Ministeriales were sent out to build and garrison castles that were dominating the surrounding countryside and keep the local aristocrats in check.\n\nThis use of Ministeriales and in particular their use in securing an imperial territory around the unimaginably valuable silver mines of Goslar infuriated the neighboring Saxon aristocrats. They felt, as their leader Otto von Northeim said, that the ruler had moved from being a king to being a tyrant. That rendered their feudal obligations null and void and since no free man should endure such humiliation, rebellion was the only honorable course of action.\n\nCanossa and beyond\n\nThis local conflict between the emperor and his Saxon subjects turned into a civil war engulfing the whole empire when emperor Henry IV simultaneously picked a fight with the pope. The trigger was a conflict over who would appoint the bishop of Milan, the pope or the emperor. The two sides exchanged increasingly angry letters. Henry IV finally called his adversary „Hildebrand, not pope but false monk“ and demanded that he vacated the papal throne. Pope Gregory VII responded by excommunicating and deposing Henry IV. Initially the imperial bishops and many princes supported Henry, but their resolve crumbled as evil portends appeared. The nobles not just in Saxony but also in Swabia and Bavaria saw the opportunity to curb imperial power.\n\nAn imperial diet of all major princes told Henry IV that he would lose his throne unless he was released from the ban within a year and a day. That led to Henry IV’s famous journey to the castle of Canossa where he intercepted Gregory VII, did penance for three days in the snow, thereby forcing the pope to forgive him. That was a cunning move that saved his throne, but not the imperial power.\n\nEven though the emperor was released from the ban, the princes still deposed him and elected a new king. In this election they also declared that any new ruler of the empire was to be chosen solely on the basis of merit, not on hereditary rights.\n\nThe civil war that followed lasted, depending on what individual conflicts one includes or does not include for either 30 or 80 years.\n\nHenry IV did win the first round against the opposition and even ousted his enemy Gregor VII from Rome but was later bottled up in Italy for almost a decade and finally deposed by his son Henry V. Henry V stabilized the situation to a degree but when he died without male heir, his successor, Lothar III had to fight with Frederick and Konrad of Hohenstaufen, who felt cheated of the throne. Konrad of Hohenstaufen became the next king of the Romans but was now in turn in a constant war with Lothar’s heirs, the house of Welf. That means that except for some brief interludes, imperial power was contested in one or other part of the empire throughout the period from 1077 to 1152.\n\nAt the end of the process, imperial power and possessions in the northern half of the German kingdom were almost completely lost. The area north of the Main River began to forge its own destiny away from the imperial gaze, giving rise to some of the most powerful principalities of the Late Middle Ages and Early modern period, Saxony, Brandenburg and Brunswick/Hannover as well as the Hanseatic League and the land of the Teutonic Knights.\n\nAs for imperial history, it became a story of the south and west, of Swabia, Bavaria, Franconia, Burgundy and above all, Italy.\n\nRebuilding the empire under Barbarossa\n\nFrederick I, Barbarossa assumed the throne in 1152 and settled the civil war. He was a descendant from both sides of the last conflict, a son of Frederick von Hohenstaufen and of Judith, from the house of Welf. The new king not only reconciled the two rival clans that had fought over the throne, but also roped in the other princes into his political projects.\n\nHe gave up the ambition to consolidate imperial power and instead went back to the earlier model of the king as a “first amongst equals”. As an honest broker, he settled longstanding conflicts between various princes by granting new ducal prerogatives to Austria, Meranien and Zaehringen and awarded titles and lands to others whilst keeping barely anything for himself.\n\nSince he left no political testament, we do not know what Barbarossa’s long term plan was. But judging by his actions it seemed that he had decided to leave the German kingdom to the imperial princes and instead create his own power base in Northern Italy.\n\nNorthern Italy by that time had become a land of powerful cities rather than one of princely territories. That does not mean there were no aristocrats. In fact the cities were dominated by oligarchies of noble families. These cities were constantly at war with their neighbors creating a sort of chessboard of alliances. Based on the logic of „the enemy of my enemy is my friend“, cities formed alliances with the neighbors of their neighbors to fight their neighbors, or all the black squares against all the white squares on the chessboard.\n\nFrom the perspective of a German high aristocrat, Northern Italy that had no grand territorial princes was a no-man’s land ready for the taking. Enough loot for himself and to reward his loyal followers. Initially everything went really well for him. He could gather huge support from the imperial princes to pursue several major campaigns in Italy that were extremely successful. He took and destroyed the largest of the Lombard cities, if not the largest and richest city in Europe, Milan in 1162. After that he resurrected the Roman law of antiquity that saw imperial power as absolute and demanded the return of all previously lost royal rights and prerogatives.\n\nBut the Italian cities did not like an overbearing emperor any better than the German princes did a century earlier. They buried their differences, rebuild the city of Milan and formed the Lombard League with the explicit aim to oust the invader.\n\nThe Lombard cities found strong support from their neighbor further south, the pope. The pope too did not like the presence of imperial troops close to Rome. Moreover pope and emperor had a longstanding dispute over the inheritance of the great countess Matilda, which comprised Tuscany and chunks of the Emilia Romagna.\n\nBarbarossa responded by mounting the largest of all his campaigns into Italy, and, instead of attacking each of the cities along the way, decided to head straight for Rome and force pope Alexander III into submission. On July 24th, 1167 his army captured Rome after a brutal fight during which St. Peter was set alight. The pope had fled to Benevento but Barbarossa had his antipope stage a sumptuous coronation of his wife. That was the high point of his career. The next day, dysentery spread through the imperial army like wildfire. Rome’s climate was notoriously unhealthy, in particular in the height of summer. Without wanting to exaggerate, the death toll was completely devastating. Most of the great families of the realm lost at least one member and the great chancellor of Barbarossa and archbishop of Cologne, Rainald von Dassel, perished.\n\nAfter this disaster, Frederick Barbarossa’s political system collapsed. His princes no longer saw him as the great victor offering the riches of Italy, but as a man condemned for his sins, in particular the sin of creating anti-popes and burning St. Peter. Though he made several more attempts to regain his position in Italy, few princes were willing to support him and in 1177 after the final defeat in Legnano he had to make peace with the pope and the Lombard cities.\n\nHaving lost the battle for Italy, Barbarossa began gathering his own territory in the German kingdom. He leveraged his position as emperor to call in lands that have become vacant due to the lack of male heirs. In a way the catastrophic losses at the siege of Rome helped, as it left many a county without successor. Within a relatively short period of time he acquired an L-shaped dominion stretching from Alsace through the Middle Rhine to the level of Frankfurt and from there Eastwards to Bohemia, including large parts of Franconia including the increasingly important city of Nurnberg.\n\nBarbarossa was no longer the respected arbiter of princely disputes but had become a player in his own right trying to create his own family powerbase, his “Hausmacht”, from which to steer the empire. This model of emperors whose main source of power are the family possessions rather than the resources of the office will be the dominant political structure of the empire going forward.\n\nThe limits of this model became apparent when the largest landowner in the empire, Henry the Lion from the House of Welf, duke of Saxony and duke of Bavaria came into conflict with his vassals. Henry the Lion had tried to consolidate his power in an attempt to achieve quasi-regal status. When Henry’s rivals hit back, Barbarossa could not or did not want to come to the Lion’s aid. Henry the Lion lost the contest and his vast possessions were divided up. Bavaria went to the Wittelsbach, Westphalia to the archbishop of Cologne and the eastern part of his lands to the Ascanians. Only the lands around Brunswick were left to the Lion, who was also exiled. Only one participant got nothing, and that was the emperor Barbarossa himself. Nobody wanted to allow him to expand his already large dominion any further.\n\nThe Hohenstaufen in Sicily\n\nThe Hohenstaufen then got one last lucky break. Barbarossa’s son, Henry VI had married the aunt of the king of Sicily who somewhat unexpectedly died without legitimate heirs. Henry VI used the ransom king Richard Lionheart had to pay him for his release to fund a campaign to gain his wife’s inheritance. And by another stroke of luck the superannuated empress gave birth to a son, Frederick, in 1194.\n\nThe kingdom of Sicily turned out to be a poison chalice. Sicily, which comprised most of Southern Italy and was one of the richest kingdoms in the medieval world reached almost up to the gates of Rome. That meant the papacy was now surrounded by lands that were at a minimum nominally and often also practically controlled by the emperor. That would be an uncomfortable situation for anyone but if you add to that disagreements over the implementation of the Concordat of Worms and the spat over inheritance of Tuscany, it is easy to understand why the relationship between pope and emperor went from animosity to outright hostility.\n\nCivil war between Philipp of Swabia and Otto IV\n\nBreaking the link between Sicily and the empire became a focus of papal policy from the day Henry VI marched into Palermo in 1193. And the pope did not have to wait long to make a move. In 1197 Henry VI died just 32 years old. His heir, young Frederick is barely 3 years old and his mother whisked him away to Palermo.\n\nThe empire is now rudderless. Henry VI’ brother, Philipp, duke of Swabia reluctantly picks up the title of king of the Romans, but has to contend with the son of Henry the Lion, Otto IV who enjoys papal backing. Another civil war follows during which both pretenders hand over royal privileges left right and center to gain support amongst the princes. When Philipp of Swabia is assassinated in 1208, precious little is left of the imperial regalia.\n\nOtto IV once champion of the pope was now undisputed king and was even crowned emperor in Rome. But he faced the same dilemma as Barbarossa. With little imperial rights and possessions still available in Germany, an emperor needed to leverage his position into obtaining some of the riches of Italy. And Otto IV decided to go after Sicily, given it was ruled by a child and by then riven by constant infighting. That was again a bad move since it blew up the relationship with the pope. Otto IV is excommunicated and runs back to Germany to shore up his realm.\n\nEmperor Frederick II and the Mainzer Landfrieden\n\nPope Innocent III sends young Frederick, the son of Henry VI, now 16 years old and at that point the last male Hohenstaufen to follow Otto IV north and depose him. Frederick does what he is told and thanks to the battle of Bouvines he did not even participate in, Otto IV is ousted and Frederick becomes Frederick II, emperor. The other thing he was told to do and did not do was to relinquish the crown of Sicily. At which point we are back to the imperial-papal stand-off.\n\nFrederick managed to keep the conflict from blowing out into the open for an astoundingly long time by regularly promising to go on crusade. The Holy Land was in dire straits after the disastrous failures of the Third and Fourth Crusade. When Frederick finally sets off, the pope had already lost patience and excommunicated him. Papal armies invaded Sicily whilst he was en route to Jerusalem. Frederick II managed to gain Jerusalem by negotiation, rather than by force, but got precious little thanks for that. Upon his return he achieves a reconciliation with the Vicar of Christ only after defeating the papal invasion and threatening Rome itself.\n\nThings hold together more or less until 1245.\n\nSicily is firmly in Frederick’s hand, he is nominally accepted as overlord of Northern Italy and de facto controls several cities and important castles there. Which gets us to the question: What happened to the Regnum Teutonicum, the kingdom north of the Alps?\n\nFrederick II had stayed there from 1212 to 1220 when he fought against Otto IV, but did not set foot there again except for a brief interlude in 1235. For him the empire North of the Alps was of secondary importance. What he cared about was that there would not be a rival king who could lead armies south and mess up his political plans in Italy. He was therefore happy to leave the princes with all the privileges and rights they had amassed during the civil war between Philipp of Swabia and Otto IV.\n\nTo make sure that no local rival could emerge he had his son Henry elected king of the Romans and crowned in Aachen. Henry was just 9 years old when he was made king and was educated by senior German princes, first archbishop Engelbert of Cologne, then duke Louis of Bavaria. Once Henry had reached adulthood he took his job seriously and began rolling back the concessions made by his father and his other predecessors which inevitably brought him into conflict with the princes.\n\nThat was exactly the opposite of what Frederick II wanted. He wanted peace and quiet up north, even if that meant the emperor had little power there. He sided with the princes against his own son. Henry feeling utterly humiliated, rebelled. Frederick II came up to Germany and defeated his son by sheer weight of the imperial prestige and the display of exotic animals and entourage.\n\nGiven that the whole issue had become so public, Frederick had to formalise the rights of the princes and the constitution of the empire, which he did in a document called the Mainzer Landfrieden of 1235, issued in both Latin and German.\n\nThis document consists broadly of two sections. The first one defines the status of the various princes, bishops and nobles and the second establishes the framework to maintain peace and justice in the empire.\n\nUnder the Mainzer Landfrieden the hierarchy of the empire differentiates between imperial princes and other lords. An imperial prince is someone who holds at least one of his fiefs directly from the emperor. Other lords are mediated, i.e., they are vassals of an imperial prince not of the emperor. And below them are free men, who in turn may be vassals of a mediated lord, unless they are toiling on the land of an imperial prince or even the emperor’s land himself. That is a major difference between kingdoms like England and France and the empire. The kings of France and England were the direct lords of all free men in the kingdom and could call upon them to go to war on the king’s behalf, even if their immediate lord wasn’t going. In the empire, the emperor had no such rights over the subjects of his imperial princes. If he called for war, he needed the imperial princes to come along for the journey and bring their forces. If they refused, that was that.\n\nFurthermore imperial princes automatically received the right to exercise the imperial regalia in their fiefs. These included the right to administer justice, mint coins, raise taxes and tolls, build castles, found cities, establish mills and so forth. Over the centuries princes had obtained these rights one by one from the emperors sometimes in exchange for services rendered and sometimes by hook and by crook. The Mainzer Landfriede cleaned this mess up by simply declaring that all imperial princes could exercise all these rights within their fiefs, even if they never previously had that right or had lost the relevant charters.\n\nThe final big concession was that the emperor allowed the princes to pass their fief on to their daughters or even other relatives, should they die without male offspring. That was huge, because it meant the emperor could no longer revert a fief that had expired. This process called Heimfall of Escheat in English had been one of the main tools medieval monarchs had used to replenish the royal demesne. Meanwhile the imperial princes often retained the right of escheat and kept confiscating the land of widows and orphans who happened to lack the protection of a powerful warrior.\n\nThen there is a second part of the Mainzer Landfrieden, the rules about conflict resolution. The main role of a medieval monarch was to provide peace and justice. And that was a difficult thing to achieve.\n\nThe preferred conflict resolution model of 13th century Germany was the feud. In the absence of a functioning system of courts and a central authority to prevent violence, feuds are an entirely rational way to enforce a claim, though probably not one that ends up favouring widows and orphans. Abolishing feuds everywhere in the empire as Frederick had attempted in Sicily was completely out of the question given the weakness of the imperial poition. So the next best option was to regulate the way feuds can be declared and are to be conducted.\n\nUnder the Mainzer Landfrieden, any feud had to be formally declared and the parties had to observe a three-day cooling-off period before hostilities could begin. And certain acts of violence were prohibited upon sanction of instant imperial ban, in particular one was not allowed to set things alight, in particular not houses, barns and castles.\n\nAnd finally, before a feud could be formally declared, the parties had to go before a judge, someone appointed by the emperor or even the emperor himself. Historians as I increasingly learn are not lawyers, and hence are keeping stum on what exactly this judge could decide and how a judgement could be enforced. I tried to read the original text but was none the wiser. What is clear is that the parties have to get a judge’s decision, but either party is still able to initiate a feud if they do not like the outcome. So it seems the judges acted more as arbitrators, attempting to diffuse the tension and arrive at a mutually acceptable solution. That is not a judgement as we would regard it today, but it was a way to reduce the overall level violence.\n\nOnce this constitution was laid out, Frederick II returned back to Sicily and had his second son, Konrad IV elected King of the Romans and gave him strict instructions to be a good arbiter between the princely interests and for heaven’s sake, do not rock the boat. His older brother and predecessor was led away to prison in Puglia where a few years later he ended his life by driving his horse down a cliff. Given the example, young Konrad IV did do exactly what his father had asked him to do, which was nothing much.\n\nThe end of the Hohenstaufen\n\nThe conflict between pope and emperor escalated dramatically in the 1240s as Frederick gained more and more power in Northern Italy and the pope got more and more concerned about imperial encirclement. Pope Innocent IV finally left Italy for the safety of Lyon, technically in the empire but practically outside imperial reach.\n\nIn 1245 the pope called a church council to excommunicate and depose Frederick II. At the pope’s behest some of the Imperial princes elected an anti-king, Heinrich Raspe, the Landgrave of Thuringia, exactly the situation Frederick II had tried to avoid by making all these concessions in 1235.\n\nAnd this was not the only part of the political edifice of the Hohenstaufen empire that began to crumble. The Lombard cities reunited into a second Lombard League and in 1248 inflicted a massive defeat on him before the walls of Parma. Konrad IV too lost a battle against Heinrich Raspe, though that was less decisive. When Frederick II died in 1250 his empire was in dire straits. He had himself become increasingly paranoid and had accused his closest advisor Petrus de Vinea of treason, had him tortured and killed.\n\nWhilst he had a whole brace of legitimate sons and an even larger set of illegitimate ones, they would all perish as the pope was hell bent to have the Hohenstaufens destroyed, root and stem. This story is very moving and sad, but to long to recount here. What matters is that Konrad IV left for Sicily only a year after his father’s death, leaving behind his little boy, Konradin as the last representative of the Hohenstaufen North of the Alps. Konradin never took a major role in imperial politics and perished in his attempt to regain Sicily for his family.\n\nThe empire was left to a series of ineffectual kings. Heinrich Raspe had been replaced by King William of Holland who spent his days trying to grow his own territory. Upon his death in a frozen Frisian lake, two new kings were elected, a Spaniard, Alfonso of Castile who never set foot in the empire and Richard of Cornwall, brother of King Henry III of England. Richard was a bit more interested in the job, but got entangled in English politics which turned him into an absentee landlord.\n\nThe vast lands of the House of Hohenstaufen as well as all that was left of the imperial possessions were suddenly without legitimate owner. They became the last great territorial feeding frenzy before the gates for new entrants into the circle of imperial princes close down.\n\nHere we are. The Holy Roman Empire is still enormous, stretching from the gates of Rome to Hamburg and from Rostock to Arles. Its cities are still thriving and its peasants are bringing in rich harvests. But by the time King Richard of Cornwall dies in 1272, the empire as a political construct had suffered from 50 years of neglect, of rulers disinterested or disengaged. The resources of the office, the imperial regalia and castles and estates are lost. When henry the Fowler took on the kingdom of East Francia, it was a hospital pass, but it still looks like a lottery ticket compared to becoming King of the Romans in 1273.\n\nStill, this next crop of rulers, often derided as “minor kings” were in fact much more successful than their more glamorous predecessors. The first will lay the foundation for a family fortune that at its hights grows into an empire where the sun never sets. Another will finally break the hold of the papacy over the emperor and again another will create one of the most beautiful, if not the most beautiful medieval capital the world has and will ever see.\n\nThat is what this coming season is all about, the 100 years from the Interregnum to the Golden Bull of 1356 or how the medieval empire becomes the Holy Roman empire with its prince-electors, its imperial diets, courts and ceremonies. An empire often derided as ineffective and antiquated, but that survived for centuries, and bestowed a legacy of regional cultural centres that are some of the greatest attractions of modern Germany.\n\nI hope you come along on the journey as we find out how all this arise from the debris of the medieval universal empire.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this painfully condensed summary of the history of the empire during the High Middle Ages.

S., Oliver K., cole P., Flouritz and Dominique who have already signed up!.\n\nLast week we left the scene in 1466 when grand master Ludwig von Erlichshausen signed the second peace of Thorn bringing an end to devastating 13 years war. At the end of the conflict Prussia was divided into two parts. Royal Prussia that comprised the old Polish duchy of Pomerelia and Western Prussia and then the order’s state of east Prussia with its capital at Koenigsberg, modern day Kaliningrad. Royal Prussia, as the name indicates was ruled by the king of Poland whilst East Prussia was all that was left of the order’s territory in Prussia.\n\nEastern Prussia was by far the poorer part. The great centers of Gdansk, Elblag and Torun were lost to the order and with it the trade along the Vistula River that connected the rich agricultural lands and mineral wealth of central Europe to the Baltic.\n\nThe agricultural surplus such as it was was exported either via Koenigsberg, or the busy harbors of Gdansk and Elblag. Apart from grain and wood, the other main export was the oldest product of the region, amber on which the order still retained a de-facto monopoly.\n\nThe Second peace of Thorn did not only result in a material change in territory, but also in a change in status. Up to 1466 the order in Prussia managed to stay fairly independent. Based on the Golden Bull of Rimini and the papal letter from 1234 the grand master was both an imperial prince and an immediate vassal of the pope. They had also some sort of link to the Polish crown as Konrad of Masovia had given them the Kulmer land on terms that the order argued was full independence and Polish chroniclers claim included some for of vassalage. It is likely that the order liked to keep things vague, because having multiple masters meant they had none.\n\nIn 1466 Ludwig von Erlichshausen was forced to swear an oath of allegiance to the king of Poland and he had to further promise that from now on at least half of the new recruits into the order were Poles. This latter provision ended up being unenforceable due to the resistance within the order and the reluctance of the Polish nobility to join. And on the former, the vassalage to the polish crown, each grand master following Ludwig von Erlichshausen tried to wriggle out of.\n\nThe war had also brought significant social change to east Prussia. As we said before, the state of the order had tried to hold on to most of the land and castles for itself and restricted the creation of a local aristocracy. And that was particularly the case in east Prussia where the nobles such as they existed were either descendants of the leadership of the Old Prussian tribes or former settlers who made good. During the 13 years war a new nobility appeared in Prussia. These were the mercenary commanders the grand master had been unable to pay. So instead of gold coin, they were given land, either land of the order or land taken from the local nobility that had sided with the Prussian League. Some of the more famous names amongst the East Prussian nobility like the von Dohna, von Eulenburg, von Schlieben, von Lehndorff came into Prussia during this period. These new landowners weren’t tied to the order and its ancient ways of working. In particular they had no qualms pushing the formerly fee peasants into a dependency to the local lord that was on the verge of turning into actual serfdom. Given how weak the grand master had become, there was little he could do to stop them.\n\nAnd the order itself began to fracture. The Komturs, the senior officers and the heads of the castle convents began to treat their estates as if they were their own. They refused to pass on their profits to the headquarters in Koenigsberg. One of them zeven became a pirate who menaced Hanse shipping and could only be stopped when the Garnd master raised an army and stormed his castle at Memel. Those who did not act so blatantly still demanded to be treated like magnates within the state and get a seat in the Landrat, the representation of the estates of Prussia alongside the bishops, cities and nobles.\n\nThe grand master’s income was limited to the manors linked directly to Koenigsberg. Which meant any major investment, war or action of any kind required the consent of the various estates represented in the Landrat.\n\nAnd then there was the bishopric of Ermland. The bishops of Ermland always had a more independent position than the other three bishoprics and as we heard last week had become neutral in the latter stages of the 13 years war which was another nail in the coffin of the order’s struggle. In the peace of Thorn, the bishop too had accepted vassalage to the King of Poland. But his diocese was made part of Royal Prussia rather than east Prussia. The problem with that was that Ermland sits right in the middle of East Prussia.\n\nSo unsurprisingly the conflict between the order and Poland resumes with Ermland. When the bishopric becomes vacant in 1467 the chapter elects Nikolaus von Thungen as bishop. King Kasimir of Poland does not like von Thungen, rejects his appointment and puts someone else in place. At which point the pope gets involved and insists on von Thungen. Von Thungen cannot get to Ermland and has to take refuge in Riga, from where he tries to build an alliance in support for his claim. He finds a sponsor in the form of the king of Hungary who pays for an army that captures some of Ermland on the bishop’s behalf. In 1477 the grand master feels that things have moved on sufficiently that he joins the fight. And since he was now at war with Poland anyway, he rescinds his vassalage to the King of Poland. At which point the Poles come down with a sizeable army. The usual burning and pillaging ensue though the Poles fail to take any of the major cities. However, the grand master’s resources are quickly exhausted, and the king of Hungary withdraws his support. So, another war ends with a defeat for the order. Ermland returns under Polish control and the grand master is made to bend the knee again.\n\nThe whole ramshackle structure limps on for another 20 years until the Grand Master Johann von Tiefen suggests a way out. So far, the members of the order and its grand masters had been recruited mainly from the lower nobility of the empire. There were the occasional grand masters from the princely houses but all of them had joined the order as simple knights and had worked their way through the ranks. The downside of this process was that none of the magnates of the empire had a personal relationship with the order. And given the lack of resources the order now needed powerful sponsors. The proposed way to acquire one of these sponsors was to offer the role of grand master to a second son of a great magnate who would then provide money and men to help the order.\n\nThe person they settled on was Friedrich von Sachsen, youngest son of the duke of Saxony. Friedrich had been destined for a career in the church and had studied in Siena, Bologna and Leipzig. He ticked all the boxes. In 1497 he was admitted to the order and immediately elevated to grand master.\n\nFriedrich von Sachsen set down to restructure the state. Part of the agreement he had made the leaders of the order to sign before joining was that they would materially increase the financial support to the center. Once elevated he pushed through further reforms, very much on the model of the territorial principality he had grown up in. He reintroduced regular visitations to the various castles and towns where he inspected the discipline of the brothers and held court, solving disputes between the people and the order. He restructured the army and established a professional bureaucracy. Basically, he operated like a 15th century territorial prince. He even held festivities in Koenigsberg palace for the local nobility with music and – shock horror – in the presence of ladies.\n\nAs for the main political objective he made some progress. As the senior officers of the order had hoped, Friedrich gathered support in the empire for a secession from the Polish crown. The emperor Maximilian encouraged him to refuse the oath of vassalage to the king of Poland. On e he had declared his intention, Prussia had to expect retaliation from Poland any minute. Though that did not happen, or at least not on the scale feared, Friedrich felt unsafe in Koenigsberg and relocated back home to Rochlitz in Saxony, leaving a governor in his place.\n\nDespite this rather disappointing result, the order continued in his policy and sought another high aristocrat as grand Master when Friedrich died in 1510. This one was a certain Albrecht, who happens to be the very first member of the House of Hohenzollern making an appearance as a story protagonist on this podcast. And little shows how far the order has fallen that they could not even affords a second son, but only one of the 10 sons of margrave Friedrich von Brandenburg Ansbach, an over indebted incompetent ruler of the small county of Ansbach, who himself was only the second son of the elector of Brandenburg, the one with the actual power.\n\nThat being said, Albrecht von Brandenburg will leave an indelible mark on the history of the Teutonic order.\n\nHe picks up where his predecessor had left off. Like him, he had settled with the leadership of the order on some ground rules. Even more support for the central authority, willingness to accept reforms and granting him the lifestyle of a lord rather than a master of a chivalric order. One request close to his heart was that he should be relieved from the oath of chastity, celibacy he was ok with, just not chastity. As they say, getting a good CEO one has to make some sacrifices. Though it seems his new brothers too had developed a laxer attitude towards the rules of St. Benedict.\n\nThe transition to a territorial state continued. Albrecht relied mainly on close associates like the bishop of Pomesania and civil bureaucrats to run the administration and refused to appoint replacements for the senior officers of the order who had retired or died.\n\nThe other main political project he continued was the attempt to get out from under the Polish vassalage. So he went on a public relations campaign in the empire arguing that east Prussia, or all of Prussia in his mind, was part of the Teutsche Lande, the German Lands. And he had some success. The Reichstag in Augsburg in 1512 declared the second peace of Thorn invalid. The Polish king then went to the pope, who ordered Albrecht to do as he was ordered and swear allegiance to his uncle, king Sigismund of Poland. In 1515 emperor Charles V changed his mind and withdrew his support. Albrecht found a new supporter though, grand duke Vasili III of Moscow who had been at war with Poland Lithuania for a while. What that was worth is unclear because when Albrecht kicked off hostilities in 1519, not a lot of Muscovy soldiers were seen in his army. This war lasted just 18 months and though Albrecht was in fact ill equipped for such an endeavour, the |Polish army that inevitably showed up failed to take any of the major strongholds, and in particular failed in its siege of Koenigsberg. Abrecht rustled up some Danish mercenaries from Livonia when the Livonian master refused to aid him who were expensive but effective, pushing the Poles back to the Vistula…and then the money ran out, the Danes went home and thanks to mediation by the emperor and the pope the two sides agreed a 4 year truce.\n\nIt is now 1522 and Albrecht von Brandenburg travels to the empire to find out why nobody came up to help him and whether they would be coming when the truce runs out in 1525. But everywhere he went, he hit a brick wall. Even his brother in Christ the German Master of the Teutonic Order outright refused to spend any more money on futile, expensive wars in Prussia. Most of the German princes took their lead from that and withheld support safe for their best wishes.\n\nBut he did meet someone who was offering a solution. Whilst Albrecht was busy fighting the Poles, a professor at the university of Wittenberg had printed a list of 95 theses and distributed them widely, including having them posted on the door of All Saints church. That professor you obviously know was Martin Luther.\n\nLuther’s demands for reform had spread rapidly. In 1521 he had defended them before the Reichstag in Worms which had made them a topic of discussion all over Europe. Already in that same year one of Albrecht’s associates had proposed to consult with Luther about possible ways to reform the order. But that attempt failed as the elector of Saxony, who protected Luther on the Wartburg was unwilling to act as middleman.\n\nIn June 1523 Luther is back in Wittenberg receiving visitors, and Albrecht sends his associate in a secret mission to discuss possible changes in the structure of the order. In November Albrecht himself goes to Wittenberg and meets with Luther and Melanchthon. The reformers are blunt. Quote “Monks are nothing but wizards and associates of the devil who have fooled the world with their bogus tricks and artifice” end quote. He has some more choice words about monasticism that I will refrain from mentioning here, but let’s just say, only a ex-monk can be so harsh on his former vocation. And if monks should leave the monasteries to become useful members of society, that is what chivalric brothers should do too. Their proposal: Make yourself the duke of a secular state and cast the order into the dustbin of history.\n\nAnd, as is Luther’s habit, he follows the meeting up by writing a public proclamation suggesting that the quote “lords of the Teutonic Order, give up false chastity and seek the true chastity of the marriage bed”. End quote\n\nAlbrecht meanwhile returns to Prussia where he finds many of his close associates thrilled by Luther’s proposals. So are the estates of Prussia, the cities and nobles who would much rather have a secular duke as overlord than a corporation of monkish warriors. Some of the bishops had picked up the protestant faith as well, whilst preachers have come to Prussia proclaiming the time for fundamental change had come.\n\nWhilst all this is going on, the timeline of the truce has been running down. Albrecht explores one more time whether there is anyone willing to give him the funds to continue the fight, but has to conclude that this is no longer a viable option.\n\nHe meets up with king Sigismund who suggests that Albrecht dissolves the order and becomes a duke and vassal to the Polish king.\n\nWith options running out, Grand Master Albrecht von Brandenburg signs on the dotted line, puts his hand in the hands of the Polish Monarch and rises again as duke Albrecht of Prussia. That was on April 10, 1525.\n\nIt is only 2 months later that Albrecht then formally declares for the Lutheran faith.\n\nAre these things connected? The historian Jurgen Sarnowski argues that these two events, the creation of ducal Prussia and the conversion to Protestantism had been independent events. The emperor Charles V, Pope Clement VII and King Sigismund supported the creation of the duchy and dissolution of the order in the belief that a duke Albrecht would remain a faithful son of the church. If so, it was quite naïve. Luther’s pamphlet and Albrecht’s visit to Wittenberg cannot have gone unnoticed and many observers in Germany had already voiced concerns that the grand master was at least tilting towards the Reformation.\n\nThis first conversion of a spiritual principality not only changed the status of the Grand Master. It also had a huge impact on the remaining Knight Brothers. Some were unwilling to accept the Reformation and left for the order’s convents in Germany that had stayed faithful to the Pope. But the majority were happy to leave their convents, marry and make babies. And they did not leave empty handed. Many of the possessions of the order were handed over to the knights brothers as private property. The former knight brothers were now nobles or as the east Prussians were often called, Junker. They followed in the footsteps of the mercenary Junkers who had come into land 50 years earlier and established large estates with dependent peasants tilling the land.\n\nA lasting peace, the secularisation of the bishoprics and other monastic lands and the establishment of a tax gathering bureaucracy provided Albrecht finally with the funds to rebuild his battered state. And he did that fairly successfully. He invested in particular in education, founded schools in the major cities and the university of Koenigsberg, the future alma mater of Immanuel Kant. He reigned a solid 43 years as duke and passed away in 1568 from the plague. He was succeeded by his son, Albrecht Friedrich who was deposed due to severe mental illness. Then the duchy went through a number of regents from the Hohenzollern family until they almost all died out and Prussia became part of the states of the elector of Brandenburg one of whose descendants crowned himself and his wife as king in Prussia in Koenigsberg in 1701. King in Prussia because Prussia was still under Polish overlordship.\n\nWe will no doubt spend a lot of time talking about Prussia on this podcast, so we can leave this story here.\n\nBut as for the Teutonic order, this was not the end.\n\nWhen Albrecht unveiled his shock announcement that he was to convert to the Lutheran faith, the other two masters, the Livonian master and the German master were aghast. Both were men in their seventies and deeply loyal to the papacy. Now they saw the man they had regarded as the leader of their order become a secular prince and immediately excommunicated.\n\nThe Livland Master, Wolter von Plettenberg saw himself as a bulwark against the expanding orthodox grand duchy of Moscow. But Livonia wasn’t Prussia. In Livonia there had aways been other powers present, the cities of Riga, Dorpat and Narva the bishops and the local aristocracy. The cities as members of the Hanse saw their brethren in Luebeck, Hamburg and Danzig pick up Lutheranism and followed suit. Plettenberg had to allow Protestant preachers into the land and even inside the order the new religion gained support. Under his successors the order kept shifting more and more away from Catholicism. When Muscovy under Ivan the terrible invaded the order sought help from abroad, mostly from protestant Denmark and Sweden. This help did not come for free and the state of the order crumbled quickly. The last Livonian Master, Gotthard Kettler swore allegiance to King Sigismund II of Poland in 1561, dissolved the order in Livonia and became duke of Courland. As in Prussia the lands of the order were distributed amongst the brothers who became part of the already sizeable German-speaking aristocracy that dominated these lands until the Bolshevik revolution.\n\nThe German branch of the order did hold out longer. They too had to balance the religious differences. In the interest of keeping the organisation going brothers were allowed to convert to Lutheranism if they so chose. In the 17th century they also admitted Calvinists which turned the order into a multi-confessional community. There was however a major problem. The Lutheran and Calvinist brothers wanted the property they had been administering, or more precisely, enjoying, to pass to their descendants. And in that they often found support from protestant territorial princes, who they served as officers or administrators. As the children of former warrior monks inherited these estates, the property of the order quickly eroded.\n\nOnly in Southern Germany was the order able to retain or even expand its territory. The German Master moved his seat to Mergentheim in 1527 where he established one of these statelets the Holy Roman empire had hundreds of. In 1590 the order elected Maximilian of Habsburg as its German and now also grand master. From 1641 onwards all grand masters were members of the Habsburg family as a sinecure for younger sons. And when I say younger, I mean younger. The youngest was just 13 years old when he entered the order and became instantly elected as a successor to Hermann von Salza.\n\nAs for the members of the order, an element of the martial tradition remained. Members were required to serve at least three years in the wars against the Ottoman empire as officers.\n\nWhen Napoleon did away with all these little statelets to create more efficient entities to furnish him with soldiers, the last remaining properties of the Teutonic Knights, including Mergentheim were secularised.\n\nBut still the order continued to exist. The Habsburgs kept supporting it, making it a honorary chivalric order. Its activities, sponsored by the honourees reverted back to its roots, hospitals and schools. When the Habsburg monarchy fell in 1918, the order had its final crisis. They had lost their sponsor and as far as the public were concerned they were just a part of the now defunct monarchy. The last Habsburg Grand master resigned and in 1929 the pope gave the order a new rule. Under this new rule only priest and nuns were full members of the order and they should solely focus on religious tasks, in particular caring for the sick and the elderly and in education. The order has its headquarter in Vienna and has about 200 priests and 100 nuns today.\n\nAnd that brings the story of the Teutonic Knights to its end.\n\nI recognise that this part of history plays a huge role in the national narratives of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and even Russia and Romania. A role much more significant than it played in the German National story, even in the 19th century. That did not mean we did not develop the usual mix of fact and fiction that described the order as a bit tough round the edges but ultimately a bringer of civilisation to a savage land. And the Nazis picked up some of the iconography building Ordensburgen as school buildings for the Nazi elite, whilst suppressing the actual order. And for those Germans who trace their roots to Danzig or East Prussia these stories have certainly great importance.\n\nGiven these sensitivities I was even more focused on painting an accurate and balanced picture of events in these episodes than usual. I tried to stick close to primary sources and recent scholarship. Should I have made mistakes, and I almost certainly have made many, I apologise. It was not out of malice but lack of attention. And as we are on the topic a quick shout out to all of you who posted interesting and informative comments on the Facebook posts I put out on these topics. And in particular a big thanks to listener Mariusc G. for his kind message the other day.\n\nSo, what will be next? The next series will pick up where we left off nearly a year ago, the death of emperor Frederick II. We will go through the chaos of the so-called interregnum before we alight in the reign of the Luxemburg emperors starting with Henry VII. Forgive me if it will take a me a few weeks to get started. As usual I need to get my bearings before we dive in… I hope you will come along for that adventure.\n\nBibliography\n\nWilliam Urban: The Teutonic Knights – A Military History\n\nEric Christiansen: The Nordic Crusades, Penguin Books, 1997\n\nKlaus Militzer: Die Geschichte des deutsche Ordens, 2.Aufl, 2012\n\nJurgen Sarnowsky: der Deutsche Orden, 2.Aufl, 2012\n\nAdam Zamosyski: Poland – A History\n\nA History of the Teutonic Knights in Prussia 1190-1331: The Kronike Von Pruzinlant by Nicolaus Von Jeroschin\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe LEague of Prussian cities and Nobles Rejects the rule of the Teutonic Knights\n\nThe theocratic state of the Teutonic Knights had survived the devastating defeat at Tannenberg with most of its territory intact.

As you know the History of the Germans and all its offshoots have remained resolutely advertising free despite some rather flattering offers. I do not know how much time you spent following news about the podcasting industry, but if you do, you would notice that something rather unpleasant is afoot. It is not only that some major listening platforms like Stitcher and Google podcasts have or will soon be shut down, but several production firms and with it some well known shows have closed shop. In part these firms were overly optimistic about the economics of the medium, but a big part is this overstuffing of the advertising channel. Shows sold more and more advertising space that compelled listeners to skip the clips so that advertisers reduced pay per views, which in turn forced podcasters to put even more slots into their shows. That puts off listeners and the economics deteriorate even more until the show has to shut down. That is a fate I would very much like to avoid. As someone posted on twitter, there are still 7,000 episodes to go before we reach 1991. And if we want to get there, the show needs patrons who make a contribution either on patreon.com/historyofthegermans or on historyofthegermans.com/support. And thanks a lot to Johann O., Lorie, Alessandro, Gary A. and Verity C. who have already signed up.\n\nLast week we ended on the death of Paul von Rusdorf who had been grand master from 1422 to 1441. During his rule the situation had gone from bad to worse. The order had suffered two major defeats in 1422 and 1435 and was forced to recognize Lithuanian sovereignty over Samogitia and hand over a number of border fortresses. The wars had devastated the land and thereby further reduced the income of the order. In general the economic situation was difficult and became worse as time went by.\n\nOne great income stream had completely disappeared by 1413, and that were the Reisen, the adventure trips where members of Europe’s aristocracy could come up to Prussia and play at crusading.\n\nAnd finally Poland Lithuania had expanded into what is today Ukraine. Then as now these lands were extraordinarily fertile, producing in particular grain that could now be exported more easily down the Vistula to Danzig and from there to the densely populated cities in England and Flanders. This competition pushed down prices for the grain produced on the estates of the order.\n\nWhen Konrad von Erlichshausen took over as grand master in 1441, he was focused on stabilizing the situation. The first and paramount order of the day was to keep the peace and rebuild financial firepower. In the age of mercenary armies, money was what counted.\n\nKonrad avoided war with Poland throughout his tenure. That was made easier by the fact that royal power in Poland was severely constrained by the Sejm, the council of nobleman and bishops. This forerunner of the Polish parliament had been created as far back as 1180 and had gained strength throughout the time of Polish fragmentation. Under the new king, Casimir IV it had control over taxation and hence was able to curtail the ability of the king to wage war. As it happened the Sejm was not too excited about the idea of war against the Teutonic order, mainly because a victory in Prussia would only strengthen the authority of the king at the expense of the nobles. Hence even though Casimir saw the weakness of the order and his realm had the resources to take Prussia any time, the political situation prevented him from doing anything about that, at least for now.\n\nThe other problem Konrad dealt with more successfully were the internal tensions inside the order that had been created by his predecessor’s nepotism. Paul von Rusfeld had placed relatives and friends from back home into key positions in the order. Many of the Knights brothers had become disaffected and were at the edge of revolt. Konrad von Erlichhausen fired many of the old officers and considered the precarious balance between the various factions in his own appointments. He also tightened discipline in the various convents of the order which had become lax, as it did in all religious orders. The rule of St. Benedict, even in its altered version as it applied to the members of the Teutonic order was very hard to comply with. Waking up every 3 hours for prayer or exercise is not a sustainable way to live, and that is before the vows of obedience, poverty and chastity.\n\nWith the issues of Polish hostility and internal division if not resolved but largely mitigated, the other and most complex issue became the focus of the grand master’s politics, the Prussian League.\n\nThe Prussian league was founded in 1440. It brought the great trading cities such as Danzig, Elbing and Thorn together with the secular nobility in Prussia. Its purpose was to reign in the power of the order. To understand the reason why they formed the league, we have to take a closer look at its members.\n\nOne part of the Prussian League were the local aristocracy. There were broadly three groups. One were Polish knights who had lived in the Culmer Land or in Pomerelia since before the conquest by the Teutonic Knight and had become its vassals. Then there are the former leaders of the Prussian tribes who had been made noblemen as part of the various peace settlements during the conquest. And finally there are German-speaking immigrants who have been successful, either as merchants or as farmers and had amassed enough land and property to fund the knightly lifestyle.\n\nBut the financially most significant members were the cities, many of which were members of the Hanse. Like most Hanse cities they were ruled by a patrician class of successful merchants. These men usually spoke low German and had commercial and family ties across the Hanse network. I did a whole series about the Hanseatic League, so I will not repeat all of it here. But the way the Hanse operated was as a network of merchants who facilitated trade based on effectively just trust, trust that their commercial partners would honor their obligations and that they would provide them with reliable information about what was going on in the various markets they operated in. The political system was simply an extension of this commercial network. The most successful merchants were members of the city council and steered city policy in the commercial interest of its merchants. And at the level of the Hanse, the various cities again operated on a basis of mutual trust and a common interest in expanding their trading operations.\n\nBoth cities and aristocrats felt that the rule of the Teutonic Knights had become cruel and overbearing. In 1453, the Prussian League wrote up a list of 66 specific complaints against the order and sent it to the emperor Frederick III.\n\nMany of these relate to arbitrary decision making by the order and his officers. They quote cases where members of the orders simply took away property, assumed ownership of land, charged new taxes, devalued coins, took away goods stranded following a disaster at sea, closed the city mills and so forth.\n\nJustice they claim was no longer possible to obtain since the grand master refused to hold an annual public court day where important legal cases could be discussed and adjudicated. Instead decisions were taken behind closed doors and were arbitrary.\n\nBeyond the breaking of the law, they also accused individual members of the order of brutality and even murder. One we already know about, the murder of the Danzig Burgermeisters in 1411, but they also mention violence against common people. A man called Rabensteiner had tortured and robbed a man who had dared criticizing his conduct. There is the Komtur of Thorn, Wilhelm vom Steine who is accused to have drowned some honorable citizens so that he could have his way with their wives\n\nThe order’s discipline had broken down, in particular the warrior monks had taken leave of the vow of chastity, it was was split and had lost its way as a spiritual organization.\n\nThese are quite common complaints you can find about most late medieval rulers. What gave it its specific flavor were the complaints of the cities against the order’s interference in their affairs. The cases they quote here and many times before and after are the replacement of the city councilors in Thorn and the execution of the Burgomeisters of Danzig, both events having happened way back in 1411. Though they happened long ago, they remained a source of concern. Interference by the city overlord, in particular the replacement of city councilors was a major problem for two reasons.\n\nOne was that the position as councilor had direct financial benefits for the incumbent. His standing made him a more sought after partner for other merchants within the Hanse network, effectively bringing business his way. As councillor he also had better information about what was going on in the various markets he was operating in, such as where a king was imposing new taxes, where the pirates are operating etc.\n\nThe second point is that the Hanse cities had to balance their responsibility towards the other Hanse cities with their obligations to the city overlord. That was a difficult tightrope to walk even in the good times before 1410. After 1410 the pressure from the order forced the cities, in particular the city of Danzig to decide between the two. And given the Hanse provided opportunities to get rich whilst the Teutonic Order offered only blood sweat and tears, it wasn’t difficult to figure out where they were leaning to.\n\nWhat became the bone of contention was the Pfundzoll, an excise duty on the weight carried by every ship entering or leaving the harbor. This specific duty was originally created by the Hanse as a way to fund military actions agreed by the Hansetag diet. When the Grand Master demanded the Pfundzoll for himself, the cities were pushed into a corner. They had to decide where the proceeds were to go, funding the Hanse wars and embargoes or to the wars of the Teutonic Order. What made it even more difficult was that the Pfundzoll was levied not just on Danzig merchants but on anyone going in or out of Danzig harbor, including fellow Hanse merchants from other cities.\n\nAll these are good reasons to be upset and whilst Konrad von Erlichshausen had tried to rein in on some of these excesses he could not remedy all complaints. Parts of this conflict was structural.\n\nBefore 1410 the Knights could allow the cities and the local nobility to live pretty much as they pleased. The order had enough income streams to cover its operations and thanks to the crusaders, had a huge supply of free military support. Now the revenues are down and, as knights on horseback were replaced by cannon and mercenaries, the cost of warfare had gone up dramatically.\n\nLike most political entities in europe in the 15th century, the Knights were looking for a new way to run things that made their rule sustainable. We have come to the end of the middle ages and the beginning of the early modern period. The political structures are shifting from the old self-funded model of rule built on personal relationships, vows of allegiance and inheritable positions to tax-funded territorial states run by a paid bureaucracy that decides on the basis of written laws rather than personal affiliation.\n\nThe Knights Brothers were members of a chivalric order steeped in the logic and traditions of the crusades. It is hard to be more medieval than these guys. So I doubt they had sat down at any point and decided they wanted to transition to an absolutist state. But what they realized was that they were in precipitous decline and something fundamental needed to happen. They needed to be able to raise money from all their subjects, including merchants and noblemen. And for that to happen, all these special privileges the Prussian League insisted upon needed to go.\n\nKonrad von Erlichshausen was not the man to push this to its ultimate conclusion. When he died in 1449 his conciliatory approach left behind a better managed and more financially sound Prussia, but it was still a long way from being sustainable. His successor was his brother Ludwig von Erlichshausen\n\nLudwig was ready to take the next step and face down the Prussian League. He was not alone in this ambition. Many of the senior officers of the order wanted a resolution. The Prussian League’s demands to remove taxes had become more and more persistent. At some point they even demanded that the lawyers the order retained as advisors would leave the room during negotiations, something even modern negotiators would regard as an outrage.\n\nAs the order insisted on taxes and tariffs to be paid and the League claimed freedoms and privileges, the situation gradually developed into a crisis. This crisis even concerned the pope in Rome who was trying to put together a grand coalition of central European powers to fight back the Ottoman Turks. Remember, we are just three years from the fall of Constantinople. He sent a papal legate to mediate but without success.\n\nErlichshausen tried to solve the issue by legal means. He put a petition to the emperor and the pope demanding they order the dissolution of the Prussian League. He argued that Prussia had been given to the order by the pope and the emperor and his lawyers produce copies of the golden bull of Rimini and the letter from pope Gregory IX in 1234. Therefore the mere existence of the Prussian League was an affront against the divine order.\n\nThe league responded by issuing the list of complaints I have mentioned before. It was a question between formal legality and actual justice. And unsurprisingly, emperor Frederick III came down on the side of formal legality. In 1454 he declared the Prussian League illegal.\n\nFor some reason Grand Master Erlichshausen believed that the cities and nobles of Prussia would simply accept an imperial or papal ruling. That was obviously totally naïve. Neither the cities nor the nobles could tolerate unconstrained rule by the Teutonic Order, divinely ordained or not.\n\nThe league had been under no illusion what the outcome of such arbitration would be and had prepared for war as soon as the summons had arrived. Once the imperial order to dissolve was issued, they reacted without hesitation, making a move, unprecedented in pre-modern times. They sent a letter of secession to the grand master, declaring they were no longer his subjects. Instead they informed him that they had taken an oath as vassals of the king of Poland, whose ancient rights to Pomerelia they acknowledged.\n\nI am in no position to check this claim, but I understand that this is the first time in European history that a particular region or group decides they want to leave a political entity and move to another one.\n\nThe letter of secession took Erlichshausen by surprise. He was expecting some resistance, but not instantly and not on this scale or in this form. His preparations for war, if there had been any, weren’t far advanced. So he could only look on as the burghers of the cities stormed the castles of the Teutonic Knights in Danzig, Thorn and Elbing and took the buildings down brick by brick, until nothing was left, well except for the Dantzker of Thorn, the toilet tower of this once mighty fortress.\n\nThe letter of secession had been sent on March 6, 1454. Throughout the summer the rebels took most of Pomerelia except for the largest fortresses of the order, in particular Marienburg. Shaken out of his shock, the grand master recruited troops all across Bohemia and Germany as fast as he could using whatever money he could get his hands on, including pawning land.\n\nThe rebels focused their efforts in two places. One was Marienburg they besieged from late march onwards, the other was Konitz. Konitz lies south of Marienburg and was the point where the mercenaries were most likely to enter Prussia.\n\nKing Kasimir of Poland was clearly pleased about this sudden influx of loyal subjects and joined the effort with his own levies in September. He took his troops to that strategically important city of Konitz. The city was defended by another of the von Plauen family that had played such an important role in the immediate aftermath of Tannenberg. He commanded a smallish garrison of about 200 Knight brothers, waiting for the mercenary reinforcements.\n\nKasimir had brought 12,000 cavalry and 6,000 infantry which should be enough to take the town. The king knew that an army of mercenaries, slightly smaller than the Polish contingent was on its way to Konitz. But he was convinced his army could push them back should they show up.\n\nWell, the Bohemian mercenaries did show up the next day. Casimir ordered his army to immediately attack the enemy who should be exhausted from marching for days. It nevertheless took a long time for the Poles to get into position, enough time for the Bohemian mercenaries to turn their carts into a wagenburg, a technique that they had perfected in the long Hussite wars in Bohemia. King Casimir’s attack finally got under way late in the afternoon and scored some initial successes, capturing the enemy commanders. But they could not break the circle of wagons. And then the garrison in Konitz, just 200 knights with their retinue made an unexpected sortie attacking the back of the Polish army. This and the fading light caused utter confusion in the Polish ranks, the mercenaries counterattacked and the Poles fled in panic. King Kasimir escaped only by a whisker.\n\nThe war that then follows is often described in nationalistic terms, a fight between the Poles to regain their ancient territory from the cruel and murderous Germans. That is however not quite what happened. Few of the members of the Prussian league were Poles, namely just the aristocrats from Culm and Pomerellia. As for the kingdom of Poland, after the disaster of Konitz their support for the effort became haphazard. The Sejm remained unwilling to fund large mercenary operations and the levies were often unwilling to heed the king’s call, arrived late, under strength and/or were ineffective. T"
