        "text": "After the murder of her father, Przemysl II of Poland, nine year old Elizabeth (then known as Richeza) was the only surviving heir.\n\nFive years later, Elizabeth gave birth to her only child Agnes. Within just a few days, her husband was dead from tuberculosis. Elizabeth took over as regent until her stepson could take the throne, but he was murdered shortly after becoming King. Elizabeth then married the next successor, Rudolf of Habsburg, who died from dysentery the following year. Elizabeth was left with her dowry towns and a huge amount of money by Rudolf’s father, who was murdered shortly after.\n\nAs her relations grappled for the Bohemian throne, Elizabeth settled outside of Prague with her lover Jindřich of Lipá. They spent many happy years together until his death in 1329."
