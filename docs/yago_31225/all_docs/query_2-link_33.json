It is known that in 1085 Prince Vratislav II of Bohemia as the first Czech sovereign was crowned in Mainz with a gold ornament by Emperor Henry IV. The emperor ordered then Archbishop Egilbert of Trier to anoint and crown Vratislav II in Prague’s Cathedral which duly happened in the following year. The second Czech ruler who was crowned, was Prince Ladislaus II (Ladislaus I as king) in 1158. His secular coronation took place in Regensburg under the auspices of Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa. A contemporary chronicler mentioned only that the king was crowned with a gold crown decorated with pearls and precious gemstones. The third Czech ruler who had been rised to the royal rank was PÅemysl Otakar I. He was crowned in 1198 in Mainz and received a hereditary royal title. From then on all Czech rulers were entitled to the royal title and the right to coronation. It seems that the ornament used for early Czech coronations was the one which Charles I used in 1347 to make a new crown for himself, the Crown of St Wenceslaus.\n\nCharles I, King of Bohemia and Roman Emperor (as Charles IV) commissioned a new crown to be made for his coronation in 1347. The new crown of the Czech kings was to be universally known as the Crown of St Wenceslaus. With time it became the most venerated item of the Czech regalia and the symbol of the Czech nationhood. Actually the new crown was just an earlier crown of the Czech kings which Charles I had refashioned for his coronation. The king decreed that the crown should rest on the reliquary of St Wenceslaus in Prague Cathedral and only be removed in exceptional circumstances such as coronations. The Crown of St Wenceslaus is made of four gold plates each in the form of massive fleur-de-lis. The plates hinged together form a circlet. Initially the crown had been a corona aperta but later when two gold hoops surmounted by a gold cross were added inside the gold circlet it was transformed into a corona clausa. The crown weighs 2358 grammes. Its height is 19 cm. The cross on the top of the crown contains a relic of the Crown of Thorns with an appropriate legend in Latin: Hic est spina de Corona Domini. The crown is lavishly decorated with twenty pearls and ninety-six gemstones including sapphires, rubies, balas rubies, emeralds and lynx sapphires. Several sapphires in the crown are among world’s largest (320 and 270 carats). They probably originate from Siam. The biggest ruby in the crown is also the biggest ruby in the world (250 carats). It comes from Burma.\n\nIn the 16th century a sceptre and an orb were added to the set of the Czech regalia. These masterpieces of the goldsmith’s art were commissioned by the Czech King and Roman Emperor Rudolph II. The orb is made of gold and is covered with scenes from the Old Testament in relief. It is topped with a gold cross and inlaid with 31 pearls, 8 sapphires and 6 balas rubies. The orb weighs 780 grammes. Its height is 22 cm. The richly ornamented sceptre is made of gold, and inlaid with 4 sapphires, 4 rubies and numerous pearls. The sceptre is 63 cm long and it weights 1013 grammes.\n\nFollowing Charles I’s coronation, the Crown of St Wenceslaus was kept in St Vitus’ Cathedral in Prague and used only during subsequent coronations and royal burials. In 1378 the crown was set on public display for eleven days in the Royal Castle in Prague where the dead king, Charles I, was lying in state. In 1420, amid turmoil caused by the Hussite wars, King Sigismund of Luxembourg took the Crown of St Wenceslaus with him to his foreign exile. Sixteen years later the crown was returned to the Kingdom of Bohemia. It was deposited at the Castle of KarlÅ¡tejn near Prague, where it was to be safeguarded. The crown was to be removed from KarlÅ¡tejn to Prague exclusively for royal coronations and burials. The inventory of the regalia drawn up in 1541 mentioned that the Crown of St Wenceslaus was inlaid with 19 rubies, 28 balas rubies, 25 emeralds, 19 sapphires and 20 big pearls. During the 1598 inventory the Czech regalia were displayed on the altar of the chapel in KarlÅ¡tejn Castle for all to see. In 1619 the regalia were transferred from KarlÅ¡tejn to Prague for the coronation of Frederick of the Palatinate. The transfer became permanent as KarlÅ¡tejn was no longer considered a safe place for the regalia. The ancient ornaments of the Czech kings were deposited in St Vitus’ Cathedral in Prague.\n\nIn 1631 during the war with Saxony the Czech regalia were transferred to a church in BudÄjovice in Southern Bohemia, where they were hidden. Six years later, during the Swedish invasion, the regalia were transferred to the Imperial Treasury in Vienna where they were to remain until 1791. They were, however, transferred to Prague for the coronations of the emperors as Czech kings. In 1782, during his visit to Vienna, Pope Pius VI had a chance to see for himself the Czech regalia kept in the Imperial Treasury. Emperor Leopold II allowed the transfer of the Czech regalia from Vienna to Prague in 1790. In the following year the regalia were deposited in the Regalia Chamber beside St Wenceslaus’ Chapel in St Vitus’ Cathedral in Prague. The chamber was locked with seven keys which were to be in the possession of seven guardians, including the king and the archbishop of Prague. The tradition has been continued ever since. During the Austro-Prussian war of 1866 the Czech regalia were again sent to Vienna for safeguarding. This time they were transported by train. The Crown of St Wenceslaus was returned to Prague in the following year. The train carrying the regalia was greeted with music and joyful celebrations by the crowds which gathered along its entire route on Czech territory. Following their arrival in Prague the Czech national regalia were displayed on the high altar of St Vitus’ Cathedral for all to see. In 1871 the heir apparent to the Austrian throne, Archduke Rudolph, visited Prague and inspected the Crown of St Wenceslaus. Four years later the regalia were displayed in the Royal Castle in Prague next to the coffin of King Ferdinand V. In 1929 the Czech regalia were put on public display in St Vitus' Cathedral in Prague to mark the millennium of the death of St Wenceslaus. In September 1938 fearing the approaching war the Czechoslovak government decided to send the regalia to a safer place far away from the troubled Sudetenland and the German border which were all too close to Prague."
