        "text": "Prince Charles was born in Flanders to Habsburg Archduke Philipp the Handsome of Austria, King of Castile and Duke of Burgundy, the son of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and Mary Burgundy. During his childhood and teen years, Charles lived in Mechelen together with his sisters Archduchess’ Mary, Eleanor, and Isabella at the court of his aunt Archduchess Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy.\n\nPrince Charles’ grandmother, Mary of Burgundy was the only child of Charles I the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, and his wife Isabella of Bourbon. Mary inherited the Burgundian lands at the age of 19 upon the death of her father in the Battle of Nancy on January 5, 1477. Mary was the wife of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I.\n\nThe Habsburg Netherlands was the Renaissance period fiefs in the Low Countries held by the Holy Roman Empire’s House of Habsburg. Their rule began in 1482, when the last Valois-Burgundy ruler of the Netherlands, Mary, Duchess of Burgundy died on March 27th of that year.\n\nThe Low Countries ruled by Duchess Mary of Burgundy consisted of a collection of states that included the duchies of Limburg, Brabant, Luxembourg, the counties of Namur, Holland, Hainaut.\n\nBurgundy and the associated Low Countries was inherited by Mary of Burgundy’s son Archduke Philipp the Handsome of Austria who succeeded as Duke Philipp IV of Burgundy. As previously mentioned, Philipp became King Felipe I of Castile through his marriage (Jure uxoris) to Queen Joanna of Castile, younger child of Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Fernando II of Aragon, the Catholic Monarchs of Spain. Through his father Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor from 1493, Philipp was a Habsburg scion, and so the period of the Habsburg Netherlands began\n\nAs the heir of his four grandparents, Prince Charles inherited all his family dominions at a young age. After the death of his father Archduke Philipp in 1506, he inherited the Habsburg Netherlands, originally held by his paternal grandmother Mary.\n\nOn July 18, 1507, In Brussels, Prince Charles is crowned as Duke Charles II of Burgundy and Count of Flanders, as well as Lord of the Netherlands, a year after inheriting the title. Charles extended the Burgundian territory with the annexation of Tournai, Artois, Utrecht, Groningen, and Guelders. The Seventeen Provinces had been unified by Charles’s Burgundian ancestors, but nominally were fiefs of either France or the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nAfter the death of Philipp (Felipe I) of Castile, in September 1506, Castile was in crisis as his former father-in-law, King Fernando II of Aragon, had no legal position in Castile, with the cortes of Toro recognizing Joanna and her children as heirs and therefore Fernando II left Castile in July 1506.\n\nQueen Joanna was allegedly mentally unstable, and Joanna’s and Philipp’s son, Charles,was only six years old. Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros, the Chancellor of the Kingdom, was made regent, but the upper nobility reasserted itself. King Fernando led an army against Pedro Fernández de Córdoba y Pacheco, the marquis of Priego of Córdoba, who had seized control there by force.\n\nAs the husband of Queen Isabella I of Castile, he was also King of Castile from 1475 to 1504 (as Fernando V). He reigned jointly with Isabella over a dynastically unified Spain; together they are known as the Catholic Monarchs. Fernando is considered the de facto first king of Spain, and was described as such during his reign, even though, legally, Castile and Aragon remained two separate kingdoms until they were formally united by the Nueva Planta decrees issued between 1707 and 1716.\n\nWith the death of his grandfather, King Fernando II-V of Aragon and Castile in 1516, Charles inheriting the dynastic union formed by his maternal grandparents Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Fernando II of Aragon and he became King Carlos I of Spain as co-monarch of the Crowns of Castile and Aragon with his mother, who was deemed incapable of ruling due to mental illness.\n\nThe Spanish inheritance, included Spain as well as the Castilian possessions in the Americas (the Spanish West Indies and the Province of Tierra Firme) and the Aragonese kingdoms of Naples, Sicily, and Sardinia in Italy.\n\nAt the death of his paternal grandfather Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian in 1519, he inherited Austria and was elected to succeed him as Holy Roman Emperor. He adopted the Imperial name of Emperor Charles V as his main title, and styled himself as a new Charlemagne.\n\nIsabella Romola de’ Medici (August 31, 1542 – July 16, 1576) was the daughter of Cosimo I de’ Medici, first Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Eleonora di Toledo. Beautiful, intelligent, witty and refined, she is often referred to as the Star of the House of Medici (La Stella di Casa Medici), in recognition of “her playfulness, vibrancy, often sarcastic sense of humour, sharpness and interest in a huge variety of topics – not to mention the great parties she held”.\n\nShe received a humanist education alongside her brother, Francesco de’ Medici, who succeeded their father as the Grand Duke of Tuscany. To secure a relationship with the powerful Roman Orsinis, Isabella’s father arranged her marriage to Paolo Giordano I Orsini when she was 16.\n\nShe remained in her father’s household after her marriage, giving her an unusual degree of independence for a woman of her period. Following the death of her father, Isabella was probably murdered by her husband, with the complicity of her brother, and in retribution for her relationship with Paolo Giordano’s cousin Troilo Orsini.\n\nBiography\n\nIsabella was born in Florence where, with her brothers and sisters, she lived first in the Palazzo Vecchio and later in the Palazzo Pitti, spending much of her time as a child at father’s ancestral country home, Villa di Castello. The Medici children were educated at home by tutors in a range of subjects such as classics, languages, and arts.\n\nFrom an early age Isabella showed a great love for music, which in her adulthood she used as means for self-expression, according to biographer Caroline Murphy. A great beauty, she had a lively, high-spirited and impulsive character that was commented on by courtiers.\n\nIn 1553, at age 11 Isabella was betrothed to 12-year-old Paolo Giordano Orsini, in line for the Duchy of Bracciano in southern Tuscany, a liaison Isabella’s father felt necessary to secure his southern border and his relationship with the ancient Roman Orsini family.\n\nThe two married in 1558, in a semi-private ceremony, at Villa di Castello. Paolo left the following day. Concerned by the spending habits of his new son-in-law, Cosimo decided to keep his daughter and her 50,000 scudi dowry in Florence, giving her greater freedom and control over her own affairs than was customary for Florentine women of the time.\n\nFollowing her mother’s death, she acted as first lady of Florence for a time, displaying the de’ Medici aptitude for politics. She suffered several miscarriages and remained childless until her late twenties. Her daughter Francesca Eleonora (known as Nora), was born in 1571 and eventually married her cousin Alessandro Sforza. Her son Virginio was born in 1572 and eventually inherited his father’s dukedom.\n\nIsabella’s free-spirited personality created rumours with regard to the nature of her relationship with Troilo Orsini, Paolo Giordano’s cousin, who was charged with looking after her while her husband tended to military duties.\n\nOn July 16, 1576 Isabella died unexpectedly at the Medici villa in Cerreto Guidi during a hunting holiday. According to her brother, the grandduke, this occurred “while she was washing her hair in the morning … She was found by Signor Paolo Giordano on her knees, having immediately fallen dead.”\n\nHowever, the official version of events was not generally believed, and the Ferrarese ambassador, Ercole Cortile, obtained information that Isabella was “strangled at midday” by her husband in the presence of several named servants.\n\nIsabella was the second sudden death in an isolated country villa in the Medici family, her cousin Leonora, having died of a similar “accident” only a few days before. Most historians assume that Paolo Giordano killed Isabella, in reprisal for carrying on a love affair with Troilo Orsini, or that he acted on instructions of the Grandduke Francesco, Isabella’s brother.\n\nOne scholar, Elisabetta Mori, has argued that Isabella de’ Medici died of natural causes and that the rumour that Paolo Giordano murdered her was spread by enemies of the Medici.\n\nWillem I, Prince of Orange (April 24, 1533 – July 10, 1584) was the main leader of the Dutch revolt against the Spanish Habsburgs that set off the Eighty Years’ War (1568–1648) and resulted in the formal independence of the United Provinces in 1648.\n\nHe is the founder of the Orange-Nassau branch and the ancestor of the monarchy of the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, he is also known as Father of the Fatherland.\n\nWillem was born on April 24, 1533 at Dillenburg Castle in the County of Nassau-Dillenburg, in the Holy Roman Empire (now in Hesse, German Federal Republic). He was the eldest son of Count Willem I of Nassau-Siegen and Juliana of Stolberg.\n\nWillem’s father had one surviving daughter by his previous marriage, and his mother had four surviving children by her previous marriage. His parents had twelve children together, of whom Willem was the eldest; he had four younger brothers and seven younger sisters. The family was religiously devout and Willem was raised a Lutheran.\n\nIn 1544, Willem’s agnatic first cousin, René of Châlon, Prince of Orange, died childless in the siege of St Dizier. In his testament, René of Chalon named Willem the heir to all his estates and titles, including that of Prince of Orange, on the condition that he receive a Roman Catholic education. Willem’s father acquiesced to this condition on behalf of his 11-year-old son, and this was the founding of the House of Orange-Nassau.\n\nBesides the Principality of Orange (located today in France) and significant lands in Germany, Willem also inherited vast estates in the Low Countries (present-day Netherlands and Belgium) from his cousin. Because of Willem’s young age, Emperor Charles V, who was the overlord of most of these estates, served as regent until Willem was old enough to rule them himself.\n\nA wealthy nobleman, Willem originally served the Habsburgs as a member of the court of Margaret of Parma, governor of the Spanish Netherlands. Unhappy with the centralisation of political power away from the local estates and with the Spanish persecution of Dutch Protestants, Willem joined the Dutch uprising and turned against his former masters.\n\nThe most influential and politically capable of the rebels, he led the Dutch to several successes in the fight against the Spanish. Willem I, Prince of Orange was declared an outlaw by King Felipe II of Spain in 1580.\n\nAssassination\n\nThe Burgundian Catholic Balthasar Gérard (born 1557) was a subject and supporter of King Felipe II of Spain, and regarded Williem of Orange as a traitor to the king and to the Catholic religion. In 1581, when Gérard learned that Felipe II had declared Willem an outlaw and promised a reward of 25,000 crowns for his assassination, he decided to travel to the Netherlands to kill Willem. He served in the army of the governor of Luxembourg, Peter Ernst I von Mansfeld-Vorderort, for two years, hoping to get close to Willem when the armies met.\n\nThis never happened, and Gérard left the army in 1584. He went to the Duke of Parma to present his plans, but the Duke was unimpressed. In May 1584, he presented himself to Willem as a French nobleman, and gave him the seal of the Count of Mansfelt. This seal would allow forgeries of the messages of Mansfelt to be made. Willem sent Gérard back to France to pass the seal on to his French allies.\n\nGérard returned in July, having bought two wheel-lock pistols on his return journey. On July 10, he made an appointment with Willem of Orange in his home in Delft, the Prinsenhof. That day, Willem was having dinner with his guest Rombertus van Uylenburgh. After Willem left the dining room and walked downstairs, van Uylenburgh heard Gérard shoot Willem in the chest at close range. Gérard fled immediately.\n\nGérard was caught before he could escape Delft, and was imprisoned. He was tortured before his trial on July 13, where he was sentenced to an execution brutal even by the standards of that time. The magistrates decreed that the right hand of Gérard should be burned off with a red-hot iron, that his flesh should be torn from his bones with pincers in six different places, that he should be quartered and disembowelled alive, that his heart should be torn from his chest and flung in his face, and that, finally, his head should be cut off.\n\nWillem I of Orange was the first head of state to be assassinated by handgun. (The Scottish Regent Moray had been shot 13 years earlier in the first firearm assassination.)\n\nMaria Isabella of Spain (July 6, 1789 – September 13, 1848) was an infanta of Spain and queen consort of the Two Sicilies by marriage to King Francesco I of the Two Sicilies.\n\nInfanta of Spain\n\nShe was the youngest daughter of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife Maria Luisa of Parma, the youngest daughter of Philip, Duke of Parma, the fourth son of King Felipe V of Spain, and Louise Élisabeth of France, the eldest daughter of King Louis XV of France and his polish born wife, the popular Queen Marie Leczinska.\n\nMaría Isabel’s birth coincided with the rise to power in Spain of her mother’s favorite, Manuel Godoy. Court rumour attributed María Isabel’s paternity not to the king, but to the young Godoy, who became Spain’s prime minister in 1792.\n\nThe Infanta’s childhood coincided with the events of the French revolution and political turbulence in Spain. The youngest surviving daughter in a large family, María Isabel was spoilt by both of her parents and her education was rudimentary. She and her family members were painted by Francisco Goya in his 1800–1801 portrait Carlos IV of Spain and His Family.\n\nIn December 1800, Lucien Bonaparte arrived in Spain as the new French ambassador. Through him, Queen Maria Luisa offered María Isabel in marriage to Napoleon Bonaparte in April 1801.\n\nThen First Consul, Napoleon had been married to Joséphine de Beauharnais for two years, but it had been suggested that he should divorce her to marry a princess of royal blood. Napoleon had a low opinion of the House of Bourbon and commented privately, “If I would have to remarry, I wouldn’t look in a house in ruins for my descendants”\n\nMarriage\n\nAnxious to find a crown for Maria Isabel, in the spring 1801, her mother looked to marry her with her paternal first cousin the Duke of Calabria, Prince Francesco of Naples and Sicily, whose wife, Archduchess Maria Clementina of Austria, was then still alive, but died of consumption in November of that year.\n\nThe idea came from the French diplomat Alquier, who had been ambassador in Madrid and Naples. His plan was to bring the Kingdom of Naples, an ally of the United Kingdom and hostile to France, into the recently formed Spanish-French alliance, proposing a closer relationship between the two families through double marriages.\n\nInfanta Maria Isabel and her eldest brother, Fernando, Prince of Asturias, would marry their first cousins: Maria Antonia of Naples and Francesco, Duke of Calabria. The Queen, Maria Carolina of Austria, who hated France and mistrusted Spain for its good will toward Napoleon, opposed the match. Infanta Maria Isabel was only twelve years old; even at a time when princesses married very young, her tender age was unusual for a bride.\n\nBut her early marriage was justified by the need to secure the hasty resumption of close relations between Spain and Naples at a particularly critical time for the European courts, struggling with the expansionist policy of Napoleon.\n\nThe contracts of the two marriages were signed in Aranjuez in April 1802. On July 6, 1802, her thirteenth birthday, María Isabel married in Madrid her 25-year-old cousin, Francesco by proxy, as his second wife. Her brother Fernando stood in the ceremony in place of the groom.\n\nThe Spanish royal family traveled to Barcelona on August 13. The two couples were married in person on October 4 at the arrival of Francesco and his sister. The festivities lasted until October 12 when María Isabel, in Italian Maria Isabella, left Barcelona towards Naples.\n\nLouis XII (June 27, 1462 – January 1, 1515) was King of France from 1498 to 1515 and King of Naples from 1501 to 1504.\n\nLouis d’Orléans was born on 27 June 1462 in the Château de Blois, Touraine (in the modern French department of Loir-et-Cher). The son of Charles, Duke of Orléans, and Marie of Cleves, the last child of Adolph I, Duke of Cleves and his second wife, Mary of Burgundy, the second child of Jean the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy and Margaret of Bavaria, and an elder sister of Philippe III the Good, Duke of Burgundy.\n\nLouis d’Orléans’ father was almost seventy years old when Louis was born. Louis was only three years old when he succeeded as Duke of Orléans upon the death of his father in 1465.\n\nBefore his accession to the throne of France, Louis of Orléans was compelled to be married to his disabled and supposedly sterile cousin Joan of Orléans by his second cousin, King Louis XI of France. Joan of Orléans was the second daughter of King Louis XI of France and of his second wife Charlotte of Savoy. Joan was born sickly and deformed.\n\nIn Women Saints – Lives of Faith and Courage, Kathleen Jones says that Joan had a hump on her back and walked with a limp, suggesting that she had an abnormal curvature of the spine. Joan’s surviving siblings were King Charles VIII of France and Anne of France. It was shortly after her birth, the king signed an agreement to marry her to his second cousin Louis, the Duke of Orléans\n\nBy arranging this marriage King Louis XI hoped to extinguish the Orléans cadet branch of the House of Valois.\n\nLouis of Orléans was one of the great feudal lords who opposed the French monarchy in the conflict known as the Mad War. At the royal victory in the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier in 1488, Louis was captured, but King Charles VIII pardoned him and released him. He subsequently took part in the Italian War of 1494–1498 as one of the French commanders.\n\nKing Louis XI of France died on August 30, 1483. He was succeeded to the throne of France by his thirteen-year-old son, Charles VIII. Since Charles VIII was only thirteen years of age when he became king, his older sister Anne was to serve as regent until Charles VIII became 20 years old. From 1485 through 1488, there was another war against the royal authority of France conducted by a collections of nobles.\n\nThis war was the in the Cathedral of Reims on January 25, 1515, with Claude as his Queen Consort. (1485–1488), Louis’s war against Anne. Allied with François II, Duke of Brittany, Louis confronted the royal army at the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier on 28 July 1488 but was defeated and captured. Pardoned three years later, Louis joined his cousin King Charles VIII in campaigns in Italy, leading the vanguards of the army.\n\nAll four children of Charles VIII by Anne of Brittany died in infancy. The French interpretation of the Salic Law permitted claims to the French throne only by male agnatic descendants of French kings. This made Louis, Duke of Orléans, the great-grandson of King Charles V, the most senior claimant as heir of Charles VIII. Thus, Louis, Duke of Orleans, succeeded to the French throne on April 7, 1498 as King Louis XII of France upon the death of King Charles VIII.\n\nWhen Louis XII became king in 1498, he had his marriage with Joan annulled by Pope Alexander VI and instead married Anne of Brittany, the widow of his cousin Charles VIII. This marriage allowed Louis to reinforce the personal Union of Brittany and France. As mentioned in my recent post on the life of Duke François II of Brittany, Anne of Brittany was his daughter by his second wife Margaret of Foix, Infanta of Navarre.\n\nKing Louis XII persevered in the Italian Wars, initiating a second Italian campaign for the control of the Kingdom of Naples. Louis conquered the Duchy of Milan in 1500 and pushed forward to the Kingdom of Naples, which fell to him in 1501. Proclaimed King of Naples, Louis faced a new coalition gathered by King Fernando II-V of Aragon and Castile and was forced to cede Naples to Spain in 1504.\n\nIn 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered for his daughter Claude and her cousin François, Duke of Angoulême, to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged. Claude was heir presumptive to the Duchy of Brittany through her mother, Anne of Brittany. Following Anne’s death, the marriage took place on May 18, 1514.\n\nLouis XII did not encroach on the power of local governments or the privileges of the nobility, in opposition with the long tradition of the French kings to attempt to impose absolute monarchy in France. A popular king, Louis was proclaimed “Father of the People” in 1506 by the Estates-General of Tours for his reduction of the tax known as taille, legal reforms, and civil peace within France.\n\nLouis XII remained Duke of Milan after the second Italian War, and was interested in further expansion in the Italian Peninsula and launched a third Italian War (1508–1516), which was marked by the military prowess of the Chevalier de Bayard.\n\nLouis XII died on January 1, 1515 without a male heir. He was succeeded by his cousin and son-in-law François, Duke of Angoulême from the Angoulême cadet branch of the House of Valois. He was crowned as King François I of France in the Cathedral of Reims on January 25, 1515, with Claude as his Queen Consort.\n\nPhilippa was born on June 24 c.1310/15, in Valenciennes, Low Countries. She was one of eight children and the second of five daughters born from Willem I, Count of Hainault, and Princess Joanna of Valois, granddaughter of King Philippe III of France, second eldest daughter of the Prince Charles, Count of Valois, and Princess Margaret, Countess of Anjou and Maine. Princess Joanna of Valois was the sister of King Philippe VI of France and the mother-in-law of King Edward III of England,\n\nThe Royal House of Valois was a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty, also known as the House of France.\n\nKing Edward II decided that an alliance with Flanders would benefit England and sent Bishop Stapledon of Exeter on the Continent as an ambassador. On his journey, he crossed into the county of Hainault to inspect the daughters of Count Willem of Hainault, to determine which daughter would be the most suitable as an eventual bride for young Prince Edward.\n\nThe bishop’s report to the King describes one of the Count’s daughters in detail. A later annotation says it describes Philippa as a child, but historian Ian Mortimer argues that it is actually an account of her older sister Margaret.\n\nGrowing up in the Low Countries in the period when this region was growing into a major trading centre, Philippa was well versed in finances and diplomacy. Her older sister Margaret succeeded their brother Willem II, Count of Hainault, upon his death in battle. The counties of Holland, Zeeland and the seigniory of Frisia were devolved to Margaret after agreement between the sisters.\n\nFour years later, in the summer of 1326, Isabella of France, the Queen of England, arrived at the court of Hainault to seek aid from Count Willem in order to depose her husband, Edward II, from the throne. Prince Edward had accompanied his mother to Hainaut, where she arranged the betrothal to 13-year-old Philippa in exchange for assistance.\n\nAs the couple were second cousins (as great-grandchildren of Philippe III of France), a papal dispensation was required; and sent from Pope John XXII at Avignon in September 1327. Philippa’s retinue arrived in England in December, escorted by her uncle John of Hainaut. On 23 December, she reached London where a “rousing reception was accorded her”.\n\nIn October 1327, Philippa married Edward by proxy through the Bishop of Coventry in Valenciennes. The official marriage was at York Minster on January 24, 1328, eleven months after Edward’s accession to the English throne; although the de facto rulers were Queen Mother Isabella and her avaricious lover, Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, who jointly acted as his regents. Soon after their marriage, the couple retired to live at Woodstock Palace in Oxfordshire.\n\nUnlike many of her predecessors, Philippa did not alienate the English people by retaining her foreign retinue or bringing large numbers of foreigners to the English court.\n\nAs Isabella did not wish to relinquish her own status, Philippa’s coronation was postponed for two years. She was crowned queen on February 18, 1330 at Westminster Abbey, when she was almost five months pregnant. She gave birth to her first son, Edward of Woodstock, the following June.\n\nIn October 1330, King Edward III commenced his personal rule by staging a coup and ordering the arrest of the regents. Shortly afterward, Mortimer was executed for treason and then the Queen Mother Isabella was sent to Castle Rising in Norfolk, where she spent a number of years under house arrest but with her privileges and freedom of movement eventually restored.\n\nVictoria (May 24, 1819 – January 22, 1901) was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from June 29, 1837 until her death in 1901. Her reign of 63 years and 216 days is known as the Victorian era and was longer than any of her predecessors. It was a period of industrial, political, scientific, and military change within the United Kingdom, and was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire. In 1876, the British Parliament voted to grant her the additional title of Empress of India.\n\nPrincess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent was the daughter of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn (the fourth son of King George III and Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz), and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, the fourth daughter and seventh child of Franz Friedrich, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and Countess Augusta of Reuss-Ebersdorf. One of her brothers was Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and another brother, Leopold, future king of the Belgians, married, in 1816, Princess Charlotte of Wales, the only legitimate daughter of the future King George IV, and heiress presumptive to the British throne.\n\nAfter the deaths of her father, Prince Edward on January 23, 1820 and grandfather, King George III on January 29, 1820, she was raised under close supervision by her mother and her comptroller, John Conroy.\n\nShe inherited the throne aged 18 on June 20, 1837 with the passing of her uncle King William IV of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, King of Hanover. On that day she was officially proclaimed Queen Alexandrina Victoria but then expressed her wishes to be known as Queen Victoria. Victoria, a constitutional monarch, attempted privately to influence government policy and ministerial appointments; publicly, she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality.\n\nVictoria married her first cousin Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha on February 10, 1840. Prince Albert was born on 26 August 26, 1819, at Schloss Rosenau, near Coburg, Germany, the second son of Ernst III, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and his first wife, Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. His first cousin and future wife, Victoria, was born earlier in the same year with the assistance of the same accoucheuse, Charlotte von Siebold.\n\nHe was baptised into the Lutheran Evangelical Church on September 19, 1819 in the Marble Hall at Schloss Rosenau, with water taken from the local river, the Itz. In 1825, Albert’s great-uncle, Friedrich IV, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, died without issue which led to a realignment of the Saxon duchies the following year; and Albert’s father became the first reigning duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nVictoria and Albert’s nine children married into royal and noble families across the continent, earning Victoria the sobriquet “the grandmother of Europe” and spreading haemophilia in European royalty. After Albert’s death in 1861, Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances. As a result of her seclusion, British republicanism temporarily gained strength, but in the latter half of her reign, her popularity recovered. Her Golden and Diamond jubilees were times of public celebration. Victoria died in 1901 at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, at the age of 81. The last British monarch of the House of Hanover, she was succeeded by her son King Edward VII of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nErnst August; (June 5, 1771 – November 18, 1851) was King of Hanover from June 20, 1837 until his death in 1851. As the fifth son of King George III of the United Kingdom and Hanover and Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nHe initially seemed unlikely to become a monarch, but none of his elder brothers had a legitimate son. When his older brother William IV, who ruled both kingdoms, died in 1837, his niece Victoria inherited the British throne under British succession law, while Ernst August succeeded in Hanover under Salic law, which barred women from the succession, thus ending the personal union between Britain and Hanover that had begun in 1714 when Georg Ludwig, Elector of Hanover became King of Great Britain. After the Napoleonic Wars, in October 1814 Hanover was constituted as the independent Kingdom of Hanover at the Congress of Vienna.\n\nPrince Ernst August was born in London but was sent to Hanover in his adolescence for his education and military training. While serving with Hanoverian forces near Tournai against Revolutionary France, he received a disfiguring facial wound. He was created Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale in 1799. Although his mother Queen Charlotte disapproved of his marriage in 1815 to her twice-widowed niece, Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, it proved happy.\n\nPrincess Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was the fifth daughter of Charles II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and Princess Friederike of Hesse-Darmstadt. Her father assumed the title of Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz on June 18, 1815.\n\nPrincess Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was a German princess who married successively Prince Ludwig Charles of Prussia, Prince Frederick William of Solms-Braunfels, and her first cousin Ernest Augustus. Through her 1815 marriage to her first cousin Ernst August,then Duke of Cumberland, Frederica became a British princess and Duchess of Cumberland.\n\nThe eldest son of George III, the Prince of Wales (later King George IV), had one child, Charlotte, who was expected to become the British queen, but she died in 1817, giving Ernst some prospect of succeeding to the British and Hanoverian thrones. However, his older brother Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, fathered the eventual British heir, Victoria, in 1819 shortly before the birth of Ernst’s only child, Georg.\n\nErnst was an active member of the House of Lords, where he maintained an extremely conservative record. There were persistent allegations (reportedly spread by his political foes) that he had murdered his valet, had fathered a son by his sister PrincessSophia, and intended to take the British throne by murdering Victoria.\n\nFollowing the death of King William IV of the United Kingdom and King of Hanover, Ernst became Hanover’s first resident ruler since George I. He had a generally successful fourteen-year reign but excited controversy near its start when he voided the liberal constitution granted before his reign and dismissed the Göttingen Seven, including the Brothers Grimm, from their professorial positions for protesting against this decision. In 1848, the King put down an attempted revolution. Hanover joined the German customs union in 1850 despite Ernst’s reluctance. King Ernest August died the next year and was succeeded by his son, King Georg V of Hanover.\n\nLeopold I (June 9, 1640 – May 5, 1705) was Holy Roman Emperor, King of Hungary, Croatia, and Bohemia. The second son of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor, by his first wife, Infanta Maria Anna of Spain, daughter of King Felipe III of Spain and of Archduchess Margaret of Austria, the daughter of Archduke Charles II of Inner Austria and Maria Anna of Bavaria and thus the paternal granddaughter of the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I. Her elder brother was the Archduke Ferdinand, who succeeded as Emperor in 1619. Two of her sisters, Anna and Constance, through their subsequent marriages to King Sigismund III Vasa, became Queens of Poland.\n\nInfanta Maria Anna of Spain was the Spanish Princess that King Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland first desired to marry.\n\nBorn on June 9, 1640 in Vienna, Leopold received the traditional program of education in the liberal arts, history, literature, natural science and astronomy. He was particularly interested in music, as his father emperor Ferdinand III had been. From an early age Leopold showed an inclination toward learning. He became fluent in Latin, Italian, German, French, and Spanish. In addition to German, Italian would be the most favored language at his court.\n\nLikewise he had received comprehensive ecclesiastical training as he had originally been selected for a career in the higher clergy. This plan, though, was dropped when Leopold became heir apparent upon the 1654 death of his older brother, Ferdinand IV, King of the Romans and the reigning King of Bohemia (1646), King of Hungary and Croatia (1647).\n\nNonetheless, Leopold’s spiritual education had had a manifest impact on him. Leopold remained under the spell of his clerical education and Jesuit influence throughout his life. For a monarch he was uncommonly knowledgeable about theology, metaphysics, jurisprudence and the sciences.\n\nLeopold was said to have typical Habsburg physical attributes, such as the prominent Habsburg lower jaw. Short, thin, and of sick constitution, Leopold was cold and reserved in public and socially inept. However, he is also said to have been open with close associates\n\nHis father, Emperor Ferdinand III, died on April 2, 1657 and rests in the Capuchin Crypt in Vienna. His interior organs were separately buried in the Ducal Crypt.\n\nOn July 18, 1658, more than a year after his father’s death, Leopold was elected Holy Roman Emperor at Frankfurt in opposition to the French Cardinal Mazarin, who sought to place the Imperial Crown on the head of Ferdinand Maria, Elector of Bavaria or some other non-Habsburg prince. To conciliate France, which had considerable influence in German affairs thanks to the League of the Rhine, the newly elected Emperor promised not to assist Spain, then at war with France.\n\nThis marked the beginning of a nearly 47-year reign characterized by a lasting rivalry with France and its king, Louis XIV. The latter’s dominant personality and power completely overshadowed Leopold, even to this day, but Leopold was no less a warrior-king given the greater part of his public life was directed towards the arrangement and furtherance of wars.\n\nEmperor Leopold I ruled the Holy Roman Empire until his death in 1705, becoming the second longest-ruling Habsburg emperor (46 years and 9 months). He was both a composer and considerable patron of music.\n\nLeopold’s reign is known for conflicts with the Ottoman Empire in the Great Turkish War (1683–1699) and rivalry with Louis XIV, a contemporary and first cousin (on the maternal side; fourth cousin on the paternal side), in the west. After more than a decade of warfare, Leopold emerged victorious in the east thanks to the military talents of Prince Eugene of Savoy. By the Treaty of Karlowitz, Leopold recovered almost all of the Kingdom of Hungary, which had fallen under Turkish power in the years after the 1526 Battle of Mohács.\n\nLeopold fought three wars against France: the Franco-Dutch War, the Nine Years’ War, and the War of the Spanish Succession. In this last, Leopold sought to give his younger son Charles the entire Spanish inheritance, disregarding the will of the late Carlos II of Spain. Leopold started a war that soon engulfed much of Europe. The early years of the war went fairly well for Austria, with victories at Schellenberg and Blenheim, but the war would drag on until 1714, nine years after Leopold’s death, which barely had an effect on the warring nations. When peace returned with the Treaty of Rastatt, Austria could not be said to have emerged as triumphant as it had from the war against the Turks.\n\nIn 1666, he married Infanta Margaret Theresa of Spain (1651–1673) the first child of King Felipe IV of Spain born from his second marriage with his niece Infanta Mariana of Austria. Because of this avunculate marriage, Margaret’s mother was nearly thirty years younger than her father.\n\nMargaret’s paternal grandparents were King Felipe III of Spain and his wife Archduchess Margaret of Austria. Her maternal grandparents were Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor and his wife Infanta Maria Anna of Spain, the daughter of her paternal grandparents.\n\nDespite the close consanguinity of her parents, Margaret did not develop the serious health issues and disabilities that her younger brother had shown since his birth.\n\nHis second wife was Claudia Felicitas of Austria, the first child and eldest daughter of Ferdinand Charles, Archduke of Further Austria and Count of Tyrol, by his wife and first-cousin Anna de’ Medici. On her father’s side, her grandparents were Leopold V, Archduke of Further Austria and his wife Claudia de’ Medici (after which she received her first name); on her mother’s side, her grandparents were Cosimo II de’ Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his wife Archduchess Maria Magdalena of Austria, the youngest daughter of Charles II, Archduke of Inner Austria, and his wife Maria Anna of Bavaria.\n\nHis third wife was Eleonor Magdalene of Neuburg. She was the oldest of 17 children born from Philip William, Count Palatine of Neuburg and Duke of Jülich-Berg and his second wife, Landgravine Elisabeth Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt. On her father’s side her grandparents were Wolfgang Wilhelm, Count Palatine of Neuburg and his first wife, Magdalene of Bavaria. On her mother’s side, her grandparents were George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt and Sophia Eleonore of Saxony.\n\nArchduke Joseph of Austria was the eldest son of Emperor Leopold I from his third wife, Eleonor Magdalene of Neuburg. Joseph was crowned King of Hungary at the age of nine in 1687 and was elected King of the Romans at the age of eleven in 1690. He succeeded to the thrones of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia and the Holy Roman Empire when his father Emperor Leopold I died on May 5, 1705.\n\nEmperor Joseph continued the War of the Spanish Succession, begun by his father against Louis XIV of France, in an attempt to make his younger brother Archduke Charles (later Emperor Charles VI) King of Spain.\n\nEdward the Confessor (c. 1003 – 5 January 1066) was an Anglo-Saxon English king and saint. Usually considered the last king of the House of Wessex, he ruled from 1042 until his death in 1066.\n\nEdward was the seventh son of Æthelred the Unready, and the first by his second wife, Emma of Normandy daughter of Richard I the Fearless Duke of Normandy and Gunnor. The names of Gunnor’s parents are unknown, but Robert of Torigni wrote that her father was a forester from the Pays de Caux and according to Dudo of Saint-Quentin she was of noble Danish ancestry. Gunnor was probably born c. 950. Her family held sway in western Normandy and Gunnor herself was said to be very wealthy.\n\nEdward was born between 1003 and 1005 in Islip, Oxfordshire, and is first recorded as a ‘witness’ to two charters in 1005. He had one full brother, Alfred, and a sister, Godgifu. In charters he was always listed behind his older half-brothers, showing that he ranked beneath them.\n\nDuring his childhood, England was the target of Viking raids and invasions under Sweyn I Forkbeard and his son, Canute II, both Kings of Denmark. Following Sweyn’s seizure of the English throne in 1013, Emma fled to Normandy, followed by Edward and Alfred, and then by Æthelred. Sweyn died in February 1014, and leading Englishmen invited Æthelred back on condition that he promised to rule ‘more justly’ than before.\n\nÆthelred agreed, sending Edward back with his ambassadors. Æthelred died in April 1016, and he was succeeded by Edward’s older half-brother Edmund Ironside, who carried on the fight against Sweyn’s son, Canute.\n\nIn October 1016 Canute and Edmund agreed to divide England between them, but Edmund died a month later, leaving Canute as undisputed King of the English.\n\nWith the death of Edmund Iron Side thus left Eadwig Ætheling the heir to the English throne. Eadwig Ætheling (sometimes also known as Eadwy or Edwy) (died 1017) was the fifth of the six sons of King Æthelred the Unready and his first wife, Ælfgifu of York. It is most probable that Ælfgifu was a daughter of Thored, Earl of southern Northumbria. But her parentage remains unknown.\n\nEadwig Ætheking was banished in 1016 and then outlawed in 1017 by Canute however he was reconciled with Canute the same year and allowed to live in England, but was executed at the instigation of Canute, possibly after attempting to rally resistance in the south west. The Anglo-Saxon claim to the throne then passed to the elder son of Æthelred’s second marriage, the future Edward the Confessor. Eadwig was buried at Tavistock Abbey a place built by his uncle Ordwulf.\n\nKing Canute II the Great died on November 12, 1035 in Shaftesbury, Dorset. In Denmark he was succeeded by Hardicanute, sometimes referred to as Canute III. Magnus I took control of Norway. In England Canute II was succeeded by Harold Harefoot.\n\nHarold Harefoot was the son of Canute II the Great and Ælfgifu of Northampton, a daughter of Ælfhelm, ealdorman of southern Northumbria, and his wife Wulfrun. Ælfhelm was killed in 1006, probably at the command of King Æthelred the Unready, and Ælfgifu’s brothers, Ufegeat and Wulfheah, were blinded.\n\nHarold was elected regent of England following the death of his father in 1035. He initially ruled England in place of his brother Hardicanute, who was stuck in Denmark due to a rebellion in Norway which had ousted their brother Sweyn. Although Harold had wished to be crowned king since 1035, Æthelnoth, Archbishop of Canterbury, refused to do so.\n\nIt was not until 1037 that Harold, supported by earl Leofric and many others, was officially proclaimed king of the English. The same year, Harold’s two step-brothers Edward the Confessor and Alfred returned to England with a considerable military force. Alfred was captured by Earl Godwin, who had him seized and delivered to an escort of men loyal to Harefoot. While en route to Ely, he was blinded and soon after died of his wounds.\n\nHarold I Harefoot died at Oxford on March 17, 1040, just as his half-brother Hardicanute was preparing an invasion force of Danes, and was buried at Westminster Abbey. Hardicanute had been horrified by Harold’s murder of Alfred, and his mother, Emma of Normandy, demanded vengeance.\n\nHarold’s body was subsequently exhumed, beheaded, and thrown into a fen bordering the Thames when Hardicanute assumed the throne in June 1040. The body was subsequently recovered by fishermen, and resident Danes reportedly had it reburied at their local cemetery in London. The body was eventually buried in a church in the City of Westminster, which was fittingly named St. Clement Danes.\n\nHardicanute succeeded as King of the English in 1040 died suddenly on June 8, 1042 after a reign of two years. Hardicanute was succeeded in Denmark by Magnus I the Good, King of Norway, an illegitimate son of King Olaf II Haraldsson (later St. Olaf), by his English concubine Alfhild. Hardicanute was the last Dane to rule England.\n\nEdward the Confessor succeeded to the English throne on the death of his half-brother – Hardicanute. Edward the Confessor restored the rule of the House of Wessex after the period of Danish rule.\n\nOn January23, 1045 Edward married Edith the daughter of Earl Godwin, the most powerful earl in England. Her mother Gytha was sister of Ulf, a Danish earl who was Cnut the Great’s brother-in-law. She was probably born in or before 1027. Edith was originally named Gytha, but renamed Ealdgyth (or Edith) when she married King Edward the Confessor. Soon afterwards, her brother Harold and her Danish cousin Beorn Estrithson were also given earldoms in southern England.\n\nWhen Edward died in 1066, he was succeeded by his wife’s brother Harold Godwinson, who was defeated and killed in the same year by the Normans under William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings. Edward’s young great-nephew Edgar the Ætheling of the House of Wessex was proclaimed king after the Battle of Hastings in 1066 but was never crowned and was peacefully deposed after about eight weeks.\n\nHistorians disagree about Edward’s fairly long 24-year reign. His nickname reflects the traditional image of him as unworldly and pious. Confessor reflects his reputation as a saint who did not suffer martyrdom as opposed to his uncle, King Edward the Martyr.\n\nSome portray Edward the Confessor’s reign as leading to the disintegration of royal power in England and the advance in power of the House of Godwin, because of the infighting that began after his death with no heirs to the throne.\n\nBiographers Frank Barlow and Peter Rex, on the other hand, portray Edward as a successful king, one who was energetic, resourceful and sometimes ruthless; they argue that the Norman conquest shortly after his death tarnished his image. However, Richard Mortimer argues that the return of the Godwins from exile in 1052 “meant the effective end of his exercise of power”, citing Edward’s reduced activity as implying “a withdrawal from affairs”.\n\nAbout a century later, in 1161, Pope Alexander III canonised the king. Edward was one of England’s national saints until King Edward III adopted Saint George (George of Lydda) as the national patron saint in about 1350. Saint Edward’s feast day is 13 October, celebrated by both the Church of England and the Catholic Church."
