        "text": "Archdukes\n\nThrough the forged document called privilegium maius (1358/59), issued by Duke Rudolph IV of Austria (1339–1365) it introduced the title of Archduke in order to place the Habsburgs on an equal status with the Prince-Electors of the Empire, since Emperor Charles IV had omitted to give them the Electoral dignity two years prior in his Golden Bull of 1356.\n\nEmperor Charles IV, however, refused to recognize the title, as did his immediate successor and son, Count Sigismund of Luxembourg, future Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nIn 1357 Duke Rudolph IV of Austria was married to Catherine of Bohemia, also known as Catherine of Luxembourg, the second daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV and Blanche de Valois of France the youngest daughter of Charles de Valois of France and his third wife Mahaut of Châtillon.\n\nEager to compete with his mighty father-in-law, who had made the Kingdom of Bohemia and its capital Prague a radiant center of Imperial culture, Duke Rudolph IV desired to raise the importance of his residence Vienna to a comparable or greater physical height.\n\nThe forged privilegium maius, trying to raise the importance of his residence in Vienna, along with his attempts to make Vienna the seat of its own diocese, a status that they considered appropriate for the capital of a duchy, are viewed as further attempts to raise the status of House of Habsburg and the Duchy of Austria.\n\nDuke Rudolph IV, his brothers Albrecht III and Leopold III divided the Austrian domains between themselves, in accordance with the Treaty of Neuberg, signed in 1379.\n\nAlbrecht III retained Austria proper, while Leopold III took the remaining territories.\n\nDuke Ernst II the Iron of Austria was the third son of Duke Leopold III of Austria (1351–1386) and his consort Viridis Visconti (d. 1414), a daughter of Bernabò Visconti, Lord of Milan.\n\nShortly after his birth, his father and his uncle Duke Albrecht III divided the Habsburg lands by the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg: while Duke Albrecht III and his Albertinian descendants would rule over the Duchy of Austria proper, the Leopoldian line received the Inner Austrian states of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola with the remaining March of Istria, as well as Tyrol and the Further Austrian possessions.\n\nAfter Duke Leopold III’s death in the 1386 Battle of Sempach, young Ernst and his brothers Wilhelm, Leopold IV and Friedrich IV remained under the guardianship of their uncle Albrecht III.\n\nIn 1402, there was another split in the Leopoldian line, when Duke Ernst II the Iron took Inner Austria (i.e. the duchies of Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola) and Duke Friedrich IV became the ruler of Tyrol and Further Austria. The partitions decisively weakened the Habsburg position, in favour of their rivals from the Luxembourg and Wittelsbach dynasties.\n\nIn 1407, however, conflicts between Leopold III and Ernst II resulted in a civil war that lasted until May 1409. When Leopold III died without male heirs in 1411, Ernst II finally became the uncontested head of the Leopoldian branch.\n\nIn 1414, Ernst became the last Duke to be enthroned according to Carantanian traditional rite at the Prince’s Stone in Carinthia, and from that time on called himself ‘archduke’. He was the first Habsburg to actually use this title, since it had been invented by his uncle Duke Rudolph IV.\n\nThat title Archduke was only officially recognized in 1453 by Emperor Friedrich III, himself a Habsburg. Friedrich III himself used just “Duke of Austria”, never Archduke, until his death in 1493.\n\nThe title was first granted to Emperor Friedrich III’s younger brother, Duke Albrecht VI of Austria (died 1463), who used it at least from 1458. In 1477, Friedrich III granted the title Archduke to his first cousin Sigismund of Austria, ruler of Further Austria.\n\nEmperor Friedrich III’s son and heir, the future Emperor Maximilian I, apparently only started to use the title after the death of his wife Mary of Burgundy in 1482, as Archduke never appears in documents issued jointly by Maximilian and Mary as rulers in the Low Countries (where Maximilian is still titled “Duke of Austria”). The title appears first in documents issued under the joint rule of Maximilian and Philipp (his under-age son) in the Low Countries.\n\nArchduke was initially borne by those dynasts who ruled an Habsburg territory, i.e., only by males and their consorts, appanages being commonly distributed to Cadets . These “junior” Archdukes did not thereby become independent hereditary rulers, since all territories remained vested in the Austrian crown.\n\nOccasionally a territory might be combined with a separate gubernatorial mandate ruled by an archducal cadet.\n\nFrom the 16th century onward, archduke and its female form, archduchess, came to be used by all the members of the House of Habsburg (e.g., Queen Marie Antoinette of France was born Archduchess Maria Antonia of Austria).\n\nCharles of Austria’s father Archduke Philipp of Austria was never a reigning Archduke of Austria since he predeceased his father, Emperor Maximilian I.\n\nTherefore when Emperor Maximilian died on January 12, 1519, Charles inherited the Austrian Hereditary Lands as Archduke Charles I of Austria.\n\nCharles of Austria of the House of Habsburg was born on February 24, 1500 in the Prinsenhof of Ghent, a Flemish city of the Habsburg Netherlands, to Archduke Philipp of Austria and his wife Infanta Joanna of Castile of the House of Trastámara.\n\nHis father Archduke Philipp, was nicknamed Philipp the Handsome, was the firstborn son of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, Archduke of Austria, and Duchess Mary of Burgundy, heiress to the Burgundian Netherlands.\n\nHis mother, Infanta Joanna of Castile, was the younger child of Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Fernando II of Aragon, the Catholic Monarchs of Spain and both were members of the House of Trastámara.\n\nGiven the dynastic situation at the time of his birth, the newborn Prince was originally heir apparent only of the Burgundian Low Countries as the honorific Duke of Luxembourg and second in line to the Austrian duchies, becoming known in his early years simply as “Prince Charles of Ghent”.\n\nAlthough Prince Charles was an Archduke of Austria at his birth, this title was an honorific and does not signify he was the reigning Archduke at the time. That distinction went to his grandfather, Archduke Maximilian I of Austria, who was the reigning Archduke of Austria from August 19, 1493 to January 12, 1519.\n\nI would like to give a little back story to the Duchy of Austria and how it came into the possession of the House of Habsburg.\n\nThe Duchy of Austria was a medieval Principality of the Holy Roman Empire, established in 1156 by the Privilegium Minus, when the Margraviate of Austria was detached from Bavaria and elevated to a duchy in its own right.\n\nAfter the ruling Dukes of the House of Babenberg became extinct in male line, there was as much as three decades of rivalry on inheritance and rulership, until King Ottokar II of Bohemia defeated the Hungarian troops at the Battle of Kressenbrunn. He now was sole ruler of the Bohemian, Moravian, Austrian and Styrian lands—an anticipation of the early modern Habsburg monarchy after 1526.\n\nWhen he failed to be elected King of the Romans in 1273, he contested the election of the successful candidate, the Swabian count, Rudolph of Habsburg. Nevertheless, Rudolph was able to secure his rule as the first actual King of the Romans and Germany after the Great Interregnum. By his Imperial authority he seized Ottokar’s “alienated” territories and added them to his already extensive homelands in Swabia.These territories included Austrian and Styrian lands.\n\nKing Ottokar II was finally defeated and killed by the united Austrian and Hungarian forces in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld.\n\nKing Rudolph married his daughter Judith off to King Ottokar II’s son, King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, who retained the Bohemian throne.\n\nHaving reached an agreement with the Prince-Electors, King Rudolph granted the Austrian domains to his sons Albrecht I and Rudolph II at the 1282 Diet of Augsburg, elevating them to Princes of the Holy Roman Empire, thereby securing it for the House of Habsburg. King Rudolf I’s descendants ruled Austria and Styria until 1918.\n\nThe Divided Duchy of Austria\n\nThe Erblande (“Hereditary Lands”) of the House of Habsburg formed the Alpine heartland of the Habsburg monarchy. They were the hereditary possessions of the Habsburgs within the Holy Roman Empire from before 1526. The Erblande were not all unified under the head of the dynasty prior to the 17th century. They were divided into several groupings: the Archduchy of Austria, Inner Austria, the County of Tyrol, and Further Austria.\n\nThe Duchy of Austria remained divided between the Albertine and Leopoldian lines of the Habsburg Dynasty until the reign of Emperor Friedrich III.\n\nFriedrich III (September 21, 1415 – August 19, 1493) was the eldest son of Duke Ernst the Iron of Inner Austria, and a member of the Leopoldian line of the Habsburg dynasty, and his second wife Cymburgis of Masovia.\n\nFriedrich acted as regent for his nephew, King Ladislaus the Posthumous, Duke of Austria and King of Bohemia, Hungary, and Croatia and son of the late Habsburg Monarch, King Albrecht II of the Romans and Germany and his consort Elizabeth of Luxembourg, in the duchy of Further Austria.\n\n(Ladislaus would die before coming of age). Friedrich, as Duke Friedrich VI of Inner Austria, was now the undisputed head of the Habsburg dynasty, though his regency in the lands of the Albertinian Line (Further Austria) was still viewed with suspicion.\n\nAs a cousin of late King Albrecht II of the Romans and Germany, Duke Friedrich VI became a candidate for the 1440 imperial election. On 2 February 2, 1440, the Prince-Electors convened at Frankfurt and unanimously elected him King of the Romans as Friedrich IV; his rule was still based on his hereditary lands of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola, or Inner Austria.\n\nIn 1452, at the age of 37, King Friedrich IV of the Romans and Germany travelled to Italy to receive his bride, the 17-year-old infanta Eleanor of Portugal and to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich III, by Pope Nicholas V. Emperor Friedrich III was the last Holy Roman Emperor to be crowned in Rome. His great-grandson Emperor Charles V was the last emperor to be crowned, but this was done in Bologna.\n\nEmperor Friedrich III was the first member of the House of Habsburg to have the Imperial title. The previous two members of the House of Habsburg, Rudolph and Albrecht II, were elected Kings of the Romans and Germany but never held the Imperial title.\n\nDuring his reign as both King and Emperor, Friedrich III concentrated on re-uniting the Habsburg “hereditary lands” of Austria and took a lesser interest in Imperial affairs. Nevertheless, by his dynastic entitlement to Hungary as well as by the Burgundian inheritance, he laid the foundations for the later Habsburg Empire.\n\nEmperor Friedrich III died on August 19, 1493 in Linz at the age of 77. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Archduke Maximilian I of Austria, later Emperor, and grandfather of Emperor Charles V.\n\nIn the next entry I will discuss the title Archduke of Austria.\n\nFrom The Emperor’s Desk: We have come full circle. I began this series wanting to do a biography of Elizabeth of Luxembourg. However, her life needed to be seen in the context of her father’s reign and that of his first wife, Queen Mary I of Hungary.\n\nElizabeth of Luxembourg was born into the powerful House of Luxembourg. Her parents were the 41-year-old King Sigismund of Hungary and Croatia and his second wife, the 17-year-old Barbara of Celje.\n\nThe year after her birth, Elizabeth’s father King Sigismund was elected King of the Romans and Germany. As the king’s only child, Elizabeth was seen as de facto heir presumptive to the throne, but since these crowns barred women due to the Salic Law, Elizabeth was seen as the Princess whose eventual marriage would provide a King of the Romans and King of Germany.\n\nHowever, despite Elizabeth’s ineligibility for the German crowns, in 1411, Sigismund managed to have the Hungarian estates promise that they would recognize Elizabeth’s right to the Holy Crown of Hungary and Croatia and that they and elect her future husband as King –an agreement that would have great consequences after Sigismund’s death.\n\nAlthough Elizabeth’s hereditary right was in fact rather slim in Hungary, and Croatia, as her father had not inherited these thrones but acquired them by marrying his first wife, Queen Mary I of Hungary, from whom Elizabeth was not descended.\n\nOn September 28, 1421, the enduring friendship between King Sigismund of Hungary and Croatia and the House of Habsburg culminated in a marriage treaty signed in Vienna. The treaty confirmed Elizabeth of Luxembourg’s status as heiress presumptive of Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia, but only for as long as she remained Sigismund’s only child.\n\nThe Treaty stipulated that the birth of another daughter to Sigismund would leave Elizabeth with the right to choose one of her father’s kingdoms, while the younger sister would inherit the other. Should she gain a brother, however, she would be deprived of all crowns in his favour.\n\nElizabeth’s betrothed was Prince Albrecht the Magnanimous a member of the House of Habsburg and the son of Albrecht IV, Duke of Austria, and Joanna Sophia of Bavaria, who was the youngest daughter of Albrect I, Duke of Bavaria and his first wife Margaret of Brieg. She was a member of the House of Wittelsbach.\n\nAlbrecht of Austria succeeded to the Duchy of Austria at the age of seven on his father’s death in 1404 and by inheritance he became Albrecht V, Duke of Austria.\n\nThe Margraviate of Moravia was ceded to Albrecht as part of Elizabeth’s dowry. The treaty was controversial in both Hungary and Bohemia, as the nobility of both countries claimed the right to elect their monarch, even though their choice was normally the heir-in-blood.\n\nElizabeth of Luxembourg formally married Duke Albrecht V of Austria in a splendid ceremony held on April 19, 1422 in Vienna. Elizabeth, now Duchess of Austria, moved to the Viennese court of her husband. The papal dispensation for the marriage, necessary due to the couple’s common descent from Wenceslaus II of Bohemia and Judith of Habsburg, was not sought until 1431, but was easily granted by Pope Eugene IV.\n\nAfter the death of Emperor Sigismund, Elizabeth’s father, Elizabeth and her husband Albrecht were elected by the Hungarian estates as de facto equal rulers as King and Queen of Hungary and Croatia and we’re crowned jointly on January 1, 1438. Albrecht also inherited a claim to the Duchy of Luxembourg through his wife, through his wife (jure uxoris).\n\nWhen Emperor Sigismund died in 1437, Albrecht was crowned King of Hungary and Croatia on January 1, 1438, and just as his predecessor did, he moved his court to the Hungarian Kingdom from where he later oversaw his other domains. Although crowned King of Bohemia six months after ascending to the Hungarian throne, he was unable to obtain possession of the country.\n\nAlbrecht was engaged in warfare with the Bohemians and their Polish allies, when on March 18, 1438, he was chosen “King of the Romans” at Frankfurt, an honour which he does not appear to have sought. He was never crowned as Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nQueen Elizabeth could not completely assert her position as Queen of Hungary and Croatia though, because the Veszprém bishop refused to give up on his right to crown the Queen (the monarch was traditionally crowned by the Esztergom bishop). She was however recognized as co-ruler and played an active part in the government.\n\nKing Albrecht II’s reign was brief and he died on October 27, 1439 (aged 42) leaving Elizabeth a pregnant Dowager with two daughters, Anne and Elizabeth. Bohemian nobility proclaimed an interregnum, while King Vladislaus III of Poland was crowned as the new King of Hungary and Croatia in May 1440, three months after Queen Elizabeth delivered a son, Ladislaus the Posthumous.\n\nDowager Queen Elizabeth was determined to contend for her patrimony on her son’s behalf, which led to a civil war between hers and Vladislaus III’s supporters. The conflict ended with the Queen’s death on December 19, 1442 at the age of 33.\n\nFrom The Emperor’s Desk: On the anniversary of the accession of King George III upon the British throne, instead of doing a full biography of the king, I have decided to just concentrate on the titles that George inherited throughout his lifetime.\n\nGeorge III (George William Frederick; June 4, 1738 – January 29, 1820)\n\nGeorge was born during the reign of his paternal grandfather, King George II of Great Britain and Ireland, Prince-Elector of Hanover, as the first son of Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales, and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, the daughter of Friedrich II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (1676–1732) and Magdalena Augusta of Anhalt-Zerbst (1679–1740). Her paternal grandfather was Friedrich I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, eldest surviving son of Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.\n\nAt birth he was known as HRH Prince George of Wales. Following his father’s death on March 31, 1751, Prince George became heir apparent and inherited his father’s hereditary title and became HRH The Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nOn April 20, 1751 George’s grandfather, King George II of Great Britain, created him Prince of Wales, Earl of Chester, Duke of Rothesay, High Steward of Scotland and Lord of the Isles.\n\nDid you notice what title was missing? George was not created Duke of Cornwall.\n\nDuke of Cornwall is a title in the Peerage of England, traditionally held by the eldest son of the reigning British monarch, previously the English monarch. The Duchy of Cornwall was the first duchy created in England and was established by a royal charter in 1337 during the reign of King\n\nIt is therefore possible for an individual to be Prince of Wales and heir apparent without being Duke of Cornwall. The title ‘Prince of Wales’ is the traditional title of the heir apparent to the throne, granted at the discretion of the sovereign (not automatically) and is not restricted to the eldest son of the sovereign.\n\nThe future King George III is a good example. After the death of Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales, the young Prince George was created Prince of Wales but did not become Duke of Cornwall because he was the king’s grandson, rather than his son.\n\nWhen the sovereign has no legitimate son, or when the heir apparent is not the sovereign’s son, the estates of the duchy of Cornwall revert to the Crown until a legitimate son is born or until the accession of a new monarch who has a son.\n\nAnother title Prince George was bestowed with was Earl of Chester. Since 1301, the title ‘Earl of Chester’ has generally been granted to each heir apparent to the English throne, and from the late 14th century it has been given only in conjunction with that of ‘Prince of Wales’. Both titles are bestowed to each individual by the sovereign and are not automatically acquired.\n\nPrince George succeeded to the throne on George II’s death on October 25, 1760.\n\nUpon his grandfather’s death George became King of Great Britain and Ireland. The Acts of Union 1800 unified the Parliament of Great Britain and the Parliament of Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. George was concurrently Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Prince-Elector of Hanover.\n\nThe Electorate of Hanover was an electorate of the Holy Roman Empire, located in northwestern Germany and taking its name from the capital city of Hanover. It was formally known as the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg. For most of its existence, the electorate was ruled in personal union with Great Britain and Ireland following the Hanoverian Succession.\n\nKing George III had refused to recognize the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 and maintained a separate diplomatic staff as Prince-Elector of Hanover to conduct the affairs of the family estate, the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg, until the results of the Congress of Vienna (1814 – 1815) were concluded and had elevated the former electorate of Hanover and established the Kingdom of Hanover.\n\nIn 1800 King George III became King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with the passing of The Acts of Union of 1800.\n\nThe Acts of Union 1800 were parallel acts of the Parliament of Great Britain and the Parliament of Ireland which united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland (previously in personal union) to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The acts came into force on January 1, 1801, and the merged Parliament of the United Kingdom had its first meeting on 22 January 1801.\n\nThe Kings of England held the Lordship of Ireland. The Lordship of Ireland, sometimes referred to retroactively as Anglo-Norman Ireland, was the part of Ireland ruled by the King of England (styled as “Lord of Ireland”) and controlled by loyal Anglo-Norman lords between 1177 and 1542.\n\nThe lordship was created following the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169–1171. It was a papal fief, granted to the Plantagenet Kings of England by the Holy See, via The papal bull Laudabiliter of Pope Adrian IV was issued in 1155.\n\nIt granted the Angevin King Henry II of England the title Dominus Hibernae (Latin for “Lord of Ireland”). Laudabiliter authorised the king to invade Ireland, to bring the country into the European sphere. In return, Henry was required to remit a penny per hearth of the tax roll to the Pope. This was reconfirmed by Adrian’s successor Pope Alexander III in 1172.\n\nAs the Lord of Ireland was also the King of England, he was represented locally by a governor, variously known as the Justiciar, Lieutenant, Lord Lieutenant or Lord Deputy.\n\nWhen Pope Clement VII excommunicated the King Henry VIII of England in 1533, the constitutional position of the Lordship in Ireland became uncertain. King Henry VIII had broken away from the Holy See and declared himself the head of the Church in England.\n\nIn 1541, the Kingdom of Ireland was established by the Parliament of Ireland through the Crown of Ireland Act. This act declared King Henry VIII of England as the King of Ireland, thus creating a separate political entity known as the Kingdom of Ireland. This was a personal union that would last until 1800 when the Parliament of Ireland was merged into the Parliament of Great Britain.\n\nKing George III was a monarch of the House of Hanover who, unlike his two predecessors, was born in Great Britain, spoke English as his first language, and never visited Hanover.\n\nThe following year after his accession to the throne he married Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Princess (Sophia) Charlotte was born on 19 May 1744. She was the youngest daughter of Duke Charles Louis Frederick of Mecklenburg, Prince of Mirow (1708–1752), and his wife Princess Elisabeth Albertine of Saxe-Hildburghausen (1713–1761). Mecklenburg-Strelitz was a small north-German duchy in the Holy Roman Empire. They had 15 children.\n\nIn the later part of his life, George had recurrent—and eventually permanent—mental illness. Although it has since been suggested that he had bipolar disorder or the blood disease porphyria, the cause of his illness remains unknown. George suffered a final relapse in 1810, and his eldest son, the Prince of Wales, was named Prince Regent the following year.\n\nWhen the King died aged 81 in 1820, the Regent succeeded him as George IV. George III thus reigned during much of the Georgian and Regency eras. At the time of his death, he was the longest-lived and longest-reigning British monarch, having reigned for 59 years and 96 days; he remains the longest-lived and longest-reigning male monarch.\n\nFrom The Emperor’s Desk: I could not cover the entirety of King Stephen’s reign therefore this post will cover his succession to the English throne.\n\nStephen of Blois (1092 or 1096 – October 25, 1154) was King of England from December 22, 1135 to his death in 1154. He was Count of Boulogne jure uxoris from 1125 until 1147 and Duke of Normandy from 1135 until 1144.\n\nStephen’s father was Stephen II Henry, Count of Blois and Chartres, an important French nobleman and an active crusader who died when Stephen was at most ten years old.\n\nStephen’s mother, Adela, was the daughter of William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders. She was famous among her contemporaries for her piety and strong personality. Indeed, Adela was a major reason for Stephen II Henry’s return to the Levant. She had a strong formative influence on Stephen during his growing years; she would live to see her son take her father’s throne of England, but would die within a year after that.\n\nHis father died while Stephen was still young, and he was brought up by his mother. Placed into the court of his uncle King Henry I of England, Stephen rose in prominence and was granted extensive lands.\n\nKing Henry had only one other legitimate child, the future Empress Matilda, but as a woman she was at a substantial political disadvantage. Shortly after the death of his son, the King took a second wife, Adeliza of Louvain, but it became increasingly clear that he would not have another legitimate son, and he instead looked to Matilda as his intended heir.\n\nMatilda claimed the title of Holy Roman Empress through her marriage to Emperor Heinrich V, but her husband died in 1125, and she was remarried in 1128 to Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, whose lands bordered the Duchy of Normandy.\n\nGeoffrey was unpopular with the Anglo-Norman elite: as an Angevin ruler, he was a traditional enemy of the Normans. At the same time, tensions continued to grow as a result of Henry’s domestic policies, in particular the high level of revenue he was raising to pay for his various wars. Conflict was curtailed, however, by the power of the King’s personality and reputation.\n\nMeanwhile, the King arranged for Stephen to marry Matilda of Boulogne, inheriting additional estates in Kent and Boulogne that made the couple one of the wealthiest in England. Stephen became Count of Boulogne by jure uxoris, by right of his wife.\n\nMatilda of Boulogne was the daughter of Count Eustace III of Boulogne. Her mother, Mary of Scotland, was the daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland and Margaret of Wessex, (also known as Saint Margaret of Scotland) the daughter of the English Prince Edward the Exile of Wessex and his wife Agatha. Matilda of Boulogne was also the granddaughter of Edmund Ironside, King of England.\n\nAgatha, wife of Edward the Exile, is from unknown parentage. Her antecedents are unclear and the subject of much speculation and one of the unresolved questions of medieval genealogy.\n\nStephen narrowly escaped drowning with Henry I’s son, William Adelin (Ætheling), in the sinking of the White Ship in 1120; William’s death left the succession of the English throne open to challenge.\n\nWhen news began to spread of Henry I’s death on December 1, 1135 many of the potential claimants to the throne were not well placed to respond. Geoffrey and Matilda were in Anjou, rather awkwardly supporting the rebels in their campaign against the royal army, which included a number of Matilda’s supporters such as Robert of Gloucester.\n\nMany of these barons had taken an oath to stay in Normandy until the late King was properly buried, which prevented them from returning to England. Stephen’s brother Theobald was further south still, in Blois.\n\nStephen, however, was in Boulogne, and when news reached him of Henry’s death he left for England, accompanied by his military household. Robert of Gloucester had garrisoned the ports of Dover and Canterbury and some accounts suggest that they refused Stephen access when he first arrived. Nonetheless, Stephen probably reached his own estate on the edge of London by December 8th and over the next week he began to seize power in England.\n\nThe crowds in London traditionally claimed a right to elect the King, and they proclaimed Stephen the new monarch, believing that he would grant the city new rights and privileges in return.\n\nHenry of Blois delivered the support of the church to Stephen: Stephen was able to advance to Winchester, where Roger, Bishop of Salisbury and Lord Chancellor, instructed the royal treasury to be handed over to Stephen.\n\nOn December 15, Henry of Blois delivered an agreement under which Stephen would grant extensive freedoms and liberties to the church, in exchange for the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Papal Legate supporting his succession to the throne. There was the slight problem of the religious oath that Stephen had taken to support the Empress Matilda, but Henry convincingly argued that the late king had been wrong to insist that his court take the oath.\n\nFurthermore, the late king had only insisted on that oath to protect the stability of the kingdom, and in light of the chaos that might now ensue, Stephen would be justified in ignoring it. Henry was also able to persuade Hugh Bigod, the late king’s royal steward, to swear that the King had changed his mind about the succession on his deathbed, nominating Stephen instead. Stephen’s coronation was held a week later at Westminster Abbey on 22 December 1135.\n\nMeanwhile, the Norman nobility gathered at Le Neubourg to discuss declaring Theobald II, Count of Blois and Count of Champagne as King of England, probably following the news that Stephen was gathering support in England.\n\nTheobald II was the son of Count Stephen II Henry of Blois and his wife Adela of Normandy (daughter of William the Conqueror), and the elder brother of King Stephen of England. Although he was the second son, Theobald was appointed above his older brother William the Simple, Count of Sully.\n\nWilliam, Count of Sully was the eldest legitimate grandson of William the Conqueror. He would thus have been the principal rival to King Henry I’s daughter Matilda to inherit the throne after Henry’s death. However, William was not considered as a candidate for the English crown. Several historians have taken the view that he was passed over because of mental deficiency; hence his soubriquet “William the Simple”. Though widely argued, this has never been clearly substantiated.\n\nThe Normans argued that Count Theobald II, as the more senior grandson of William the Conqueror, had the most valid claim over the kingdom and the Duchy of Normandy, and was certainly preferable to Matilda.\n\nTheobald met with the Norman barons and Robert of Gloucester at Lisieux on 21 December 21st. Their discussions were interrupted by the sudden news from England that Stephen’s coronation was to occur the next day.\n\nCount Theobald II then agreed to the Normans’ proposal that he be made King of England, only to find that his former support immediately ebbed away: the barons were not prepared to support the division of England and Normandy by opposing Stephen, who subsequently financially compensated Theobald, who in return remained in Blois and supported his brother’s succession.\n\nIn about 1406, King Sigismund married Queen Mary’s cousin Barbara of Celje, daughter of Count Hermann II of Celje. Hermann’s mother, Catherine (of the House of Kotromanic) and Queen Mary’s mother Queen Elisabeth of Bosnia were sisters, or at least cousins who were adoptive sisters.\n\nKing Sigismund and Barbara’s only child, born in the purple on October 7, 1409, probably in the castle of Visegrád, was Elisabeth of Luxembourg, the future Queen consort of Hungary, Bohemia, Croatia and the Romans and Germany.\n\nQueen Barbara was unable to give birth to any further issue. Elisabeth of Luxembourg was thus the only surviving legitimate offspring of King Sigismund.\n\nElection of Sigismund\n\nAfter the death of King Ruprecht of the Romans and Germany in 1410, Sigismund—ignoring the claims of his half-brother King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia and the former King of the Romans and Germany—was elected King of the Romans and Germany as successor by three of the Prince-Electors on September 20, 1410, but he was opposed by his cousin Jobst of Moravia, who had been elected by four electors in a different election on October 1, 1410.\n\nJobst’s death January 18, 1411 removed this conflict and Sigismund was once again elected King of the Romans and Germany on July 21, 1411. His coronation was deferred until November 8, 1414, when it took place at Aachen.\n\nIn 1419, the death of his half-brother, King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia, left Sigismund titular King of Bohemia, but he had to wait for seventeen years before the Czech Estates would acknowledge him. Although the two dignities of King of the Romans and Germany and King of Bohemia added considerably to his importance, and indeed made him the nominal temporal head of Christendom, they conferred no increase of power and financially embarrassed him.\n\nIt was only as King of Hungary that he had succeeded in establishing his authority and in doing anything for the order and good government of the land. Entrusting the government of Bohemia to Sofia of Bavaria, the widow of King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia\n\nIn 1428, Sigismund led another campaign against the Turks, but again with few results. In 1431, he went to Milan where on November 25th he received the Iron Crown as King of Italy; after which he remained for some time at Siena, negotiating for his coronation as Holy Roman Emperor and for the recognition of the Council of Basel by Pope Eugenius IV.\n\nKing Sigismund was crowned Emperor in Rome on May 31, 1433, and after obtaining his demands from the Pope returned to Bohemia, where he was recognized as King in 1436, though his power was little more than nominal.\n\nEmperor Sigismund died on December 19, 1437 at Znojmo, Moravia (now Czech Republic), and as ordered in life, he was buried at Nagyvárad, Hungary (today Oradea, Romania), next to the tomb of the King Saint Ladislaus I of Hungary, who was the ideal of the perfect monarch, warrior and Christian for that time and was deeply venerated by Sigismund.\n\nBy his second wife, Barbara of Celje, Emperor Sigismund left his only daughter, Elisabeth of Luxembourg. As he left no sons, his line of the House of Luxembourg became extinct on his death.\n\nDeath\n\nThough most historians now believe Isabel’s death was a result of either consumption or childbed fever, Clarence was convinced she had been poisoned by one of her ladies-in-waiting, Ankarette Twynyho, whom, as a consequence, he had judicially murdered in April 1477, by summarily arresting her and bullying a jury at Warwick into convicting her of murder by poisoning.\n\nShe was hanged immediately after trial with John Thursby, a fellow defendant. She was posthumously pardoned in 1478 by King Edward IV. Clarence’s mental state, never stable, deteriorated from that point and led to his involvement in yet another rebellion against his brother King Edward IV.\n\nIn 1477 Clarence was again a suitor for the hand of Mary, who had just become Duchess of Burgundy. King Edward IV objected to the match, and Clarence left the court.\n\nThe arrest and committal to the Tower of London of one of Clarence’s retainers, an Oxford astronomer named John Stacey, led to his confession under torture that he had “imagined and compassed” the death of the king, and used the black arts to accomplish this. He implicated one Thomas Burdett, and one Thomas Blake, a chaplain at Stacey’s college (Merton College, Oxford).\n\nAll three were tried for treason, convicted, and condemned to be drawn to Tyburn and hanged. Blake was saved at the eleventh hour by a plea for his life from James Goldwell, Bishop of Norwich, but the other two were put to death as ordered.\n\nThis was a clear warning to Clarence, which he chose to ignore. He appointed John Goddard to burst into Parliament and regale the House with Burdett and Stacey’s declarations of innocence that they had made before their deaths.\n\nGoddard was a very unwise choice, as he was an ex-Lancastrian who had expounded Henry VI’s claim to the throne. Edward summoned Clarence to Windsor, severely upbraided him, accused him of treason, and ordered his immediate arrest and confinement.\n\nClarence was imprisoned in the Tower of London and put on trial for treason against his brother Edward IV. Clarence was not present – Edward himself prosecuted his brother, and demanded that Parliament pass a bill of attainder against his brother, declaring that he was guilty of “unnatural, loathly treasons” which were aggravated by the fact that Clarence was his brother, who, if anyone did, owed him loyalty and love.\n\nFollowing his conviction and attainder, he was “privately executed” at the Tower on 18 February 1478, by tradition in the Bowyer Tower, and soon after the event, a rumour spread that he had been drowned in a butt of Malmsey wine.\n\nA reason for Edward to have his brother executed may have been that George had “threatened to question the legality of the royal marriage” and he may have discovered from Bishop Robert Stillington of Bath and Wells that George “had probably let slip the secret of the precontract” for Edward’s marriage with Lady Eleanor Talbot, although others dispute this.\n\nThe Peace of Westphalia is the collective name for two peace treaties signed on October 24, 1648 in the Westphalian cities of Osnabrück and Münster. They ended the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648) and brought peace to the Holy Roman Empire, closing a calamitous period of European history. Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III, the kingdoms of France and Sweden, and their respective allies among the Princes of the Holy Roman Empire, participated in the treaties.\n\nEurope had been battered by both the Thirty Years’ War and the Eighty Years’ War, exacting a heavy toll in money and lives. The Eighty Years’ War was a prolonged struggle for the independence of the Protestant-majority Dutch Republic (the modern Netherlands), supported by Protestant-majority England, against Catholic-dominated Spain and Portugal. The Thirty Years’ War was the most deadly of the European wars of religion, centred on the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nHistorical Background\n\nThe decentralization of the Holy Roman Empire was one of the main reasons for the outbreak of the war. The Holy Roman Empire had been in existence since the year 962 when King Otto I the Great of East Francia was crowned Emperor. By the 17th century the Holy Roman Empire covered most of Central Europe. It had a multi-ethnic and decentralized structure. The Emperor was nominally the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire, but the Imperial estates were becoming increasingly more autonomous.\n\nBefore the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, Western Europe had been Roman Catholic for about 1,000 years. During the Reformation, a number of Princes converted to Protestantism. Although there had been religious conflicts in the 16th century, the Thirty Years’ War was an extended, brutal conflict, one of the most gruesome wars in European history.\n\nThe war began in 1618 when the Catholic Emperor, Ferdinand II, a member of the House of Habsburg, tried to enforce religious uniformity on the Empire. Swedish and French intervention soon turned it into a European conflict concerning the constitutional structure of the Holy Roman Empire, religion, and the power to rule in Europe.\n\nThe Peace of Prague (1635) ended most religious aspects of the war, and the French–Habsburg rivalry took over prominence. With between 4.5 million and 8 million dead in the Thirty Years’ War alone, and decades of constant warfare, the need for peace became increasingly clear.\n\nThe negotiation process was lengthy and complex. Talks took place in two cities, because each side wanted to meet on territory under its own control. A total of 109 delegations arrived to represent the belligerent states, but not all delegations were present at the same time.\n\nTwo treaties were signed to end the war in the Empire: the Treaty of Münster and the Treaty of Osnabrück. These treaties ended the Thirty Years’ War in the Holy Roman Empire, with the Habsburgs (rulers of Austria and Spain) and their Catholic allies on one side, battling the Protestant powers (Sweden and certain Holy Roman principalities) allied with France (though Catholic, France was strongly anti-Habsburg under King Louis XIV of France and Navarre).\n\nThe Peace of Westphalia granted freedom and land to several other territories within the Holy Roman Empire. As each colony and territory were granted their freedom, the power of the Church and the Holy Roman Empire fled with them.\n\nThe treaties also recognized the de facto independence of the Imperial States. The Imperial States were allowed to choose the religion for their territory as mentioned above, and were allowed to enter into alliances with each other and with foreigners for their security or preservation as long as the alliances were not directed against the Emperor, the Empire, the public peace, or the terms of the Westphalian Peace Treaties.\n\nThe power asserted by Emperor Ferdinand III was stripped from him and returned to the rulers of the Imperial States. Catholics and Lutherans were redefined as equal before the law, and Calvinism was given legal recognition as an official religion. The independence of the Dutch Republic, which practiced religious toleration, also provided a safe haven for European Jews.\n\nThe Holy See was very displeased at the settlement, with Pope Innocent X calling it “null, void, invalid, iniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect for all time” in the bull Zelo Domus Dei.\n\nWith the Peace of Westphalia it truly rendered the Holy Roman Empire an Empire in name only. With a considerable amount of autonomy returned to the Imperial States the emperor had little power or authority over the states. Despite being an elective monarchy, the House of Habsburg had firm control over the succession to the Imperial Throne.\n\nThe Habsburg Monarchy, also known as the Habsburg Hereditary Lands, were States that existed both inside and outside the Empire. The State’s inside the Empire ruled by the Habsburg Monarchy were the kingdom of Bohemia and the Archduchy of Austria.\n\nOutside the Empire the House of Habsburg where Kings of Hungary and Croatia. Therefore despite the fact that the Emperor had little authority over the Imperial States, the further fact that they ruled in areas both inside and outside the Empire still made the Habsburg Dynasty a power to be reckoned with.\n\nWith the Peace of Westphalia the slow decline of the empire was accelerated. Within 40 years the Empire would see the rise of the House of Hohenzollern as Kings in Prussia (later Kings of Prussia under Friedrich II the Great) and Prince-Electors of Brandenburg. The expanded State of Prussia which came to dominate Norther Germany became rivals against the Habsburg Monarchy for supremacy within German lands.\n\nIt is interesting to note that by the 18th century we will read more about Prussia and Austria as individual states and we will hear less about the Holy Roman Empire as a whole.\n\nThe death of Queen Mary I of Hungary and her child in the riding accident caused a deep succession crisis because her husband King Sigismund ruled over Hungary by right of his wife, and although he managed to keep his power, the crisis lasted until his second marriage to Barbara of Celje.\n\nOne of the main rivals to the Crown of Hungary after the death of Queen Mary I was King Ladislaus of Naples.\n\nKing Ladislaus of was born in Naples on February 15, 1377 during the reign of his great aunt Queen Joanna I of Naples. He was the son of King Charles III of Naples (King Charles II of Hungary) and Margaret of Durazzo, both members of the Capetian House of Anjou. His parents, having lived for years at the court of their kinsman King Louis I the Great of Hungary, Croatia and Poland, named him after King Saint Ladislaus I of Hungary.\n\nIn 1401 Ladislaus of Naples married Mary of Lusignan, daughter of King James I of Cyprus and Helvis of Brunswick-Grubenhagen.\n\nMary of Lusignan arrived in Naples in 1402. In the same period, Ladislaus tried to restore Angevin rule in Hungary and Croatia, where some of the nobles opposed King Sigismund.\n\nBetween 1403 and 1414, Ladislaus ordered the painting of a cycle of the Legend of Saint Ladislaus in the church of Santa Maria dell’Incoronata in Naples. In these paintings, the Hungarian king is depicted receiving the royal crown, fighting against the pagans, and receiving the Crown of Croatia. (The cult of Saint Ladislaus and other Hungarian kings was already present in Naples and other Italian regions since the second half of the 13th century, thanks to Mary of Hungary, Queen of Naples, who brought them when she married King Charles II of Naples.)\n\nThis Mary of Hungary, Queen of Naples, (not to be confused with Queen Mary I of Hungary) was a daughter of King Stephen V of Hungary and his wife Elizabeth the Cuman. Mary served as regent in Provence in 1290–1294 and in Naples in 1295–96, 1296–98, and 1302, during the absences of her husband.\n\nConsidering himself the heir of the Kings of Hungary, King Ladislaus of Naples tried many times to obtain the Crown of Hungary and Croatia. He also proclaimed himself Duke of Slavonia, a title with no basis.\n\nHe first negotiated a treaty with the Republic of Venice, ceding the island of Corfu. He thus obtained free passage in the Adriatic Sea and, with the partial support of the Pope, landed at Zadar on July 19, 1403. On August 5, 1403, while in the town of Zara, Ladislaus was crowned King of Hungary and Croatia by János Kanizsai, archbishop of Esztergom, in the presence of the papal legate, Cardinal Angelo Acciajuoli.\n\nEven after his coronation, the rule of Ladislaus in Croatia and Hungary never extended beyond Dalmatia. His father, King Charles III of Naples grew up in Hungary governing Croatia as viceroy, and eventually briefly became King Charles II of Hungary and Croatia.\n\nHowever, Ladislaus remained inactive, and returned to Apulia; his authority in Dalmatia remained restricted to little more than the city of Zara. The following year, after the death of Boniface IX, he intervened in Rome in support of the Colonna family, two days after the election of the new pope, Innocent VII.\n\nDespite having secured the support of the nobility, Sigismund was engaged for the next nine years in a ceaseless struggle for the possession of this unstable throne.\n\nTo ease the pressure from Hungarian nobles, Sigismund tried to employ foreign advisors, which was not popular, and he had to promise not to give land and nominations to anyone other than Hungarian nobles. However, this was not applied to Stibor of Stiboricz, who was Sigismund’s closest friend and advisor. On a number of occasions, Sigismund was imprisoned by nobles, but with the help of the armies of Garai and Stibor of Stiboricz, he was able to regain power.\n\nIn 1396, Sigismund led the combined armies of Christendom against the Turks, who had taken advantage of the temporary helplessness of Hungary to extend their dominion to the banks of the Danube. This crusade, preached by Pope Boniface IX, was very popular in Hungary.\n\nThe nobles flocked in their thousands to the royal standard, and were reinforced by volunteers from nearly every part of Europe. The most important contingent being that of the French led by Duke Jean the Fearless of Burgundy, son of Philippe II, Duke of Burgundy.\n\nSigismund set out with 90,000 men and a flotilla of 70 galleys. After capturing Vidin, he camped with his Hungarian armies before the fortress of Nicopolis. Sultan Bayezid I raised the siege of Constantinople and, at the head of 140,000 men, completely defeated the Christian forces in the Battle of Nicopolis fought between the 25 and 28 September 1396.\n\nKing Sigismund returned by sea and through the realm of Zeta, where he ordained the local Montenegrin lord Đurađ II with the islands of Hvar and Korčula for resistance against the Turks; the islands were returned to Sigismund after Đurađ’s death in April 1403.\n\nThe disaster at Nicopolis angered several Hungarian lords, leading to instability in the kingdom. Deprived of his authority in Hungary, Sigismund then turned his attention to securing his succession to the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia, and was recognized by his childless half-brother King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia, the Romans and Germany, as Vicar-General of the whole Empire. However, he was unable to support Wenceslaus IV when he was deposed in 1400, and Prince Ruprecht, Elector Palatine, was elected King of the Romans and German in his stead.\n\nPrince Ruprecht of the Palatinate (1352 – 1410) a member of the House of Wittelsbach, was Elector Palatine from 1398 (as Ruprecht III) and King the of Romans and Germany from 1400 until his death. He was the son of Prince-Elector Ruprecht II and Infanta Beatrice of Sicily, daughter of daughter of King Peter II of Sicily and his wife Elisabeth of Carinthia.\n\nRuprecht’s great-granduncle was the Wittelsbach Holy Roman Emperor Ludwig IV."
