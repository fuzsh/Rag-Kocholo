Charles IV was the first King of Bohemia to become Holy Roman Emperor. He was born in 1316 to John of Bohemia and Elizabeth of Bohemia. As the eldest son, he inherited the County of Luxembourg from his father and was elected King of Bohemia in 1347. In 1346, he was chosen as King of the Romans in opposition to Louis IV and was later crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1355. Through conquests and inheritance, Charles expanded the lands of the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemian Crown to their greatest extent. He established Prague as his imperial capital and founded Charles University there in 1348.",
