In outside circle the legend; SCS WEИCEZLΛVS\n\nBretislav (Bretislaus) I was born circa 1002/1005 as a the son of Duke Oldřich and his low-born concubine Božena. In historiography he would become known as the ″Bohemian Achilles″, of the Přemyslid dynasty. During his father′s reign, in 1019 or 1029, Bretislav took back Moravia from Poland. About 1031, he invaded Hungary in order to prevent its expansion under king Stephen. Oldřich died abruptly on 9 November 1034 and later examination of his skeleton reveal his skull to have suffered a fatal blow. He was succeeded as duke of Bohemia by his son Bretislaus. In 1035, Bretislav helped Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II in his war against the Lusatians. In 1039, he invaded Lesser and Greater Poland, captured Poznań, sacked Gniezno, and brought the relics of St. Adalbert, Radim Gaudentius and the Five Brothers back with him. On the way back, he regained part of Silesia, including Wrocław. His main goal was to set up an archbishopric in Prague and create a large state subject only to the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nIn 1040, the German King Henry III invaded Bohemia, but was forced to retreat after he lost the Battle at Brůdek (a pass in the Bohemian Forest). The following year, Henry III invaded again, skirted the border defences and laid siege to Bretislav in Prague. Forced by a mutiny among his nobles and betrayed by Bishop Šebíř of Prague, Bretislav had to renounce all of his conquests save for Moravia and recognize Henry III as his sovereign. In 1042, Emperor Henry III granted Bretislav Silesia as a lien. In 1047, Emperor Henry III negotiated a peace treaty between Bretislav and the Poles. This pact worked in Bretislav′s favour, as the Polish ruler swore never again to attack Bohemia in return for an annual subsidy to Gniezno.\n\nBretislav was the author of decrees concerning the rules of Christianization, which included a ban on polygamy and trade on holidays. It was in 1030 that Bretislav married Judith of Schweinfurt. In 1054, he established rules for the ducal succession and introduced agnatic seniority as the law of succession. Younger members of the dynasty were supposed to govern fiefs (technically, parts of Moravia), but only at the duke′s discretion. The result of this succession policy was the relative indivisibility of the Czech lands, but also bitter conflicts over succession and territorial primacy between members of the dynasty. It was effectively ended by the elevation of Bohemia to the status of a kingdom under Ottokar I of Bohemia, which led to the establishment of primogeniture as the ruling principle for succession rights.\n\nBretislav′s eldest son Spytihněv was to succeed him as Duke of Bohemia with control over it domains. Moravia was incorporated into the Bohemian duchy, but divided among three of his younger sons. The Olomouc Appanage went to Vratislaus; the Znojmo Appanage went to Conrad I; and the Brno Appanage went to Otto I. The youngest son, Jaromír, entered the church and became Bishop of Prague.Bretislav died at Chrudim in 1055 during preparations for another invasion of Hungary and was succeeded by his son Spytihněv II as Duke of Bohemia. His sons Otto and Vratislav were shut out of the government by Spytihněv, but after his death gained control of Moravia and Bohemia, respectively.\n\nSaint Wenceslaus;\n\nWenceslaus I was born circa 907 as the son of Vratislaus I, Duke of Bohemia from the Přemyslid dynasty. Wenceslas I or Václav the Good was the Duke (kníže) of Bohemia from 921 until his death, probably in 935. According to the legend, he was assassinated by his younger brother, Boleslaus the Cruel. Wenceslaus was considered a martyr and saint immediately after his death, when a cult of Wenceslaus grew up in Bohemia and in England. Within a few decades, four biographies of him were in circulation. These hagiographies had a powerful influence on the High Middle Ages concept of the rex justus (righteous king), a monarch whose power stems mainly from his great piety as well as his princely vigor. Although Wenceslaus was only a duke during his lifetime, Holy Roman Emperor Otto I (962-973) posthumously ″conferred on Wenceslaus the regal dignity and title″, which is why he is referred to as ″king″ in legend and song. The hymn ″Svatý Václave″ (Saint Wenceslaus) or ″Saint Wenceslas Chorale″ is one of the oldest known Czech songs. Traceable to the 12th century AD, it is still among the most popular religious songs in the Bohemian lands. Wenceslaus′s feast day is celebrated on 28 September. On this day, celebrations and a pilgrimage are held in the city of Stará Boleslav, whereas the translation of his relics, which took place in 938, is commemorated on 4 March. Since 2000, the 28 September feast day has been a public holiday in the Czech Republic, celebrated as Czech Statehood Day.\n\nCach 322 ; Donebauer 283var. ; Marquis von Hohenkubin collection,\n\nLanz - Graz, Auction 13 (1979), 116-122\n\nwonderful coin with attractive toning\n\nxf\n\nweight 0,65gr. ; silver Ø 16mm.\n\nobv.

On his father′s death in 1055, Vratislaus became duke of Olomouc, whereas his older brother became Duke of Bohemia as Spytihněv II. He fell out with his brother and was exiled to Hungary. Vratislaus regained the ducal throne of Olomouc with Hungarian assistance and eventually reconciled with his brother, then succeeded him as duke of Bohemia when he died in 1061. Both Pope Alexander II and Pope Gregory VII confirmed Vratislaus in the privilege of wearing the mitre and tunic which his predecessors had. Despite this, Vratislaus supported Henry in both the Investiture Controversy against the Popes and the rebellions in Saxony that dominated his long reign.\n\nVratislaus was often at odds with his brother Jaromír, Bishop of Prague. Jaromír, for his part, ignored the creation of a new Moravian diocese in Olomouc by Vratislaus in 1063. Jaromir even went so far as to retake, by arms, the relics removed from Prague and taken to Moravia.

It has been estimated that the mines produced 20 tons of silver per year during the first 40 years of operation. In 1300, King Wenceslaus II took control of the mines and enacted a mining code that governed all mining operations. He decided to put all that silver to good use, and in July 1300 he began minting his own large silver coin, the grossi pragenses or Praguer groschen. Wenceslaus shut down the 20 existing mints in Bohemia and opened a new mint in Kutná Hora for the purpose of striking the new coins. So the name Praguer groschen is a bit misleading, as these were minted not in Prague, but in Kuttenberg; in Prague, only gold coins were minted at this time. The model for the Praguer groschen was the French ′gros tournois′, which was introduced by Louis IX in 1266. The huge amount of silver that came available per year, resulted in a production of about 1.650.000 to 1.770.000 Praguer groschen per year - enough to supply not only Bohemia, but also Poland and large parts of the German Empire. The Praguer groschen was extremely successful. It became so dominant in Central Europe that for the next 150 years most of the German states based their economies on the Praguer groschen rather than launch their own groschen. Since the Praguer groschen were minted later in lower quality, sometimes found with counter punches of German cities, the good pieces which were distinguished from the bad ones. In the early 16th century large silver quantities were discovered at Joachimstal in Bohemia. From 1520 on large silver coins were minted by the counts of Schlick and the Praguer groschen lost their importance. The last Praguer groschen were minted in 1547.\n\nSaurma 407 ; Donebauer 945 ; Castelin 93 a-d.\n\nweak strike\n\nvg/f\n\nweight 0,58gr. ; silver Ø 17mm.\n\nobv.

When his father died on 25 April 1077, in accordance with the Hungarian tradition which gave precedence to the eldest member of the royal family over the king′s son, King Géza′s brother, Ladislaus was proclaimed king.

In 1136, Béla managed to recover part of Dalmatia from the control of the Republic of Venice, and sent an expedition into Bosnia. In 1137, he gave the title of Duke of Bosnia, with acceptance from the entire country, to his son Ladislaus. Béla′s entire reign was overshadowed by a conflict with Boris, a son of Coloman of doubtful legitimacy, in which Boris was supported by Poland and Kievan Rus′. In 1132 Boleslaus III of Poland led a campaign with Kievan Rus′ and Polish troops on Boris′ behalf.

In 1164, the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Comnenus concluded a treaty with Béla′s brother, Stephen III, by which Béla was given the Croatian and Dalmatian territories and sent to Constantinople to be educated at the Imperial court. Manuel, who had no legitimate sons, intended that Béla should marry his daughter, Maria Comnena, and eventually succeed him as Emperor. Béla received a Greek name, Alexius, and the title of despot. When Alexius II Comnenus was born as a son of Manuel and his second wife Maria of Antioch, Béla′s engagement to Maria was cancelled. But Manuel helped negotiate another mar- riage for him, this time to Agnes of Antioch, daughter of Raynald of Chatillon. Agnes was the half-sister of Maria of Antioch.\n\nBéla succeeded his brother King Stephen III and was crowned under the influence of Emperor Manuel. As the new king, Béla adopted Catholicism and selected his son Emeric as his successor. He was a powerful ruler, and his court was counted among the most brilliant in Europe. Béla was a warrior by nature and training, and the death of Emperor Manuel in 1180 left him free to expand Hungarian power in the Balkans. Hungarian troops invaded Byzantine territory at some time before 1183. Béla′s attempt to recover Dalmatia led the Kingdom of Hungary into two wars against the Republic of Venice, but these finally achieved little. He also aided the Serbs against the Byzantine Empire.

He was succeeded by both of his sons in turn, Emeric and Andrew.\n\nHis remains were confidently identified by archeologists during late 19th century excavations at the ruined cathedral of Székesfehérvár where the Árpád monarchs had been crowned and buried. Béla′s exceptional height, as documented by contemporary sources, rendered the identification certain. Based on the examination of his skeleton he must have been over two metres tall, a really outstanding height at that time. His remains were afterwards reinterred at the Mathias Church in Budapest, with those of his second wife Agnes. Through his mother, Bela descended from Harold II of England (whose descendants had been dispossessed as a result of the Norman Conquest). Through his son, Andrew II, Béla was an ancestor of Edward III of England.
