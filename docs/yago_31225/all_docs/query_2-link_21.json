        "text": "From The Emperor’s Desk: We have come full circle. I began this series wanting to do a biography of Elizabeth of Luxembourg. However, her life needed to be seen in the context of her father’s reign and that of his first wife, Queen Mary I of Hungary.\n\nElizabeth of Luxembourg was born into the powerful House of Luxembourg. Her parents were the 41-year-old King Sigismund of Hungary and Croatia and his second wife, the 17-year-old Barbara of Celje.\n\nThe year after her birth, Elizabeth’s father King Sigismund was elected King of the Romans and Germany. As the king’s only child, Elizabeth was seen as de facto heir presumptive to the throne, but since these crowns barred women due to the Salic Law, Elizabeth was seen as the Princess whose eventual marriage would provide a King of the Romans and King of Germany.\n\nHowever, despite Elizabeth’s ineligibility for the German crowns, in 1411, Sigismund managed to have the Hungarian estates promise that they would recognize Elizabeth’s right to the Holy Crown of Hungary and Croatia and that they and elect her future husband as King –an agreement that would have great consequences after Sigismund’s death.\n\nAlthough Elizabeth’s hereditary right was in fact rather slim in Hungary, and Croatia, as her father had not inherited these thrones but acquired them by marrying his first wife, Queen Mary I of Hungary, from whom Elizabeth was not descended.\n\nOn September 28, 1421, the enduring friendship between King Sigismund of Hungary and Croatia and the House of Habsburg culminated in a marriage treaty signed in Vienna. The treaty confirmed Elizabeth of Luxembourg’s status as heiress presumptive of Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia, but only for as long as she remained Sigismund’s only child.\n\nThe Treaty stipulated that the birth of another daughter to Sigismund would leave Elizabeth with the right to choose one of her father’s kingdoms, while the younger sister would inherit the other. Should she gain a brother, however, she would be deprived of all crowns in his favour.\n\nElizabeth’s betrothed was Prince Albrecht the Magnanimous a member of the House of Habsburg and the son of Albrecht IV, Duke of Austria, and Joanna Sophia of Bavaria, who was the youngest daughter of Albrect I, Duke of Bavaria and his first wife Margaret of Brieg. She was a member of the House of Wittelsbach.\n\nAlbrecht of Austria succeeded to the Duchy of Austria at the age of seven on his father’s death in 1404 and by inheritance he became Albrecht V, Duke of Austria.\n\nThe Margraviate of Moravia was ceded to Albrecht as part of Elizabeth’s dowry. The treaty was controversial in both Hungary and Bohemia, as the nobility of both countries claimed the right to elect their monarch, even though their choice was normally the heir-in-blood.\n\nElizabeth of Luxembourg formally married Duke Albrecht V of Austria in a splendid ceremony held on April 19, 1422 in Vienna. Elizabeth, now Duchess of Austria, moved to the Viennese court of her husband. The papal dispensation for the marriage, necessary due to the couple’s common descent from Wenceslaus II of Bohemia and Judith of Habsburg, was not sought until 1431, but was easily granted by Pope Eugene IV.\n\nAfter the death of Emperor Sigismund, Elizabeth’s father, Elizabeth and her husband Albrecht were elected by the Hungarian estates as de facto equal rulers as King and Queen of Hungary and Croatia and we’re crowned jointly on January 1, 1438. Albrecht also inherited a claim to the Duchy of Luxembourg through his wife, through his wife (jure uxoris).\n\nWhen Emperor Sigismund died in 1437, Albrecht was crowned King of Hungary and Croatia on January 1, 1438, and just as his predecessor did, he moved his court to the Hungarian Kingdom from where he later oversaw his other domains. Although crowned King of Bohemia six months after ascending to the Hungarian throne, he was unable to obtain possession of the country.\n\nAlbrecht was engaged in warfare with the Bohemians and their Polish allies, when on March 18, 1438, he was chosen “King of the Romans” at Frankfurt, an honour which he does not appear to have sought. He was never crowned as Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nQueen Elizabeth could not completely assert her position as Queen of Hungary and Croatia though, because the Veszprém bishop refused to give up on his right to crown the Queen (the monarch was traditionally crowned by the Esztergom bishop). She was however recognized as co-ruler and played an active part in the government.\n\nKing Albrecht II’s reign was brief and he died on October 27, 1439 (aged 42) leaving Elizabeth a pregnant Dowager with two daughters, Anne and Elizabeth. Bohemian nobility proclaimed an interregnum, while King Vladislaus III of Poland was crowned as the new King of Hungary and Croatia in May 1440, three months after Queen Elizabeth delivered a son, Ladislaus the Posthumous.\n\nDowager Queen Elizabeth was determined to contend for her patrimony on her son’s behalf, which led to a civil war between hers and Vladislaus III’s supporters. The conflict ended with the Queen’s death on December 19, 1442 at the age of 33.\n\nIn about 1406, King Sigismund married Queen Mary’s cousin Barbara of Celje, daughter of Count Hermann II of Celje. Hermann’s mother, Catherine (of the House of Kotromanic) and Queen Mary’s mother Queen Elisabeth of Bosnia were sisters, or at least cousins who were adoptive sisters.\n\nKing Sigismund and Barbara’s only child, born in the purple on October 7, 1409, probably in the castle of Visegrád, was Elisabeth of Luxembourg, the future Queen consort of Hungary, Bohemia, Croatia and the Romans and Germany.\n\nQueen Barbara was unable to give birth to any further issue. Elisabeth of Luxembourg was thus the only surviving legitimate offspring of King Sigismund.\n\nElection of Sigismund\n\nAfter the death of King Ruprecht of the Romans and Germany in 1410, Sigismund—ignoring the claims of his half-brother King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia and the former King of the Romans and Germany—was elected King of the Romans and Germany as successor by three of the Prince-Electors on September 20, 1410, but he was opposed by his cousin Jobst of Moravia, who had been elected by four electors in a different election on October 1, 1410.\n\nJobst’s death January 18, 1411 removed this conflict and Sigismund was once again elected King of the Romans and Germany on July 21, 1411. His coronation was deferred until November 8, 1414, when it took place at Aachen.\n\nIn 1419, the death of his half-brother, King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia, left Sigismund titular King of Bohemia, but he had to wait for seventeen years before the Czech Estates would acknowledge him. Although the two dignities of King of the Romans and Germany and King of Bohemia added considerably to his importance, and indeed made him the nominal temporal head of Christendom, they conferred no increase of power and financially embarrassed him.\n\nIt was only as King of Hungary that he had succeeded in establishing his authority and in doing anything for the order and good government of the land. Entrusting the government of Bohemia to Sofia of Bavaria, the widow of King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia\n\nIn 1428, Sigismund led another campaign against the Turks, but again with few results. In 1431, he went to Milan where on November 25th he received the Iron Crown as King of Italy; after which he remained for some time at Siena, negotiating for his coronation as Holy Roman Emperor and for the recognition of the Council of Basel by Pope Eugenius IV.\n\nKing Sigismund was crowned Emperor in Rome on May 31, 1433, and after obtaining his demands from the Pope returned to Bohemia, where he was recognized as King in 1436, though his power was little more than nominal.\n\nEmperor Sigismund died on December 19, 1437 at Znojmo, Moravia (now Czech Republic), and as ordered in life, he was buried at Nagyvárad, Hungary (today Oradea, Romania), next to the tomb of the King Saint Ladislaus I of Hungary, who was the ideal of the perfect monarch, warrior and Christian for that time and was deeply venerated by Sigismund.\n\nBy his second wife, Barbara of Celje, Emperor Sigismund left his only daughter, Elisabeth of Luxembourg. As he left no sons, his line of the House of Luxembourg became extinct on his death.\n\nThe death of Queen Mary I of Hungary and her child in the riding accident caused a deep succession crisis because her husband King Sigismund ruled over Hungary by right of his wife, and although he managed to keep his power, the crisis lasted until his second marriage to Barbara of Celje.\n\nOne of the main rivals to the Crown of Hungary after the death of Queen Mary I was King Ladislaus of Naples.\n\nKing Ladislaus of was born in Naples on February 15, 1377 during the reign of his great aunt Queen Joanna I of Naples. He was the son of King Charles III of Naples (King Charles II of Hungary) and Margaret of Durazzo, both members of the Capetian House of Anjou. His parents, having lived for years at the court of their kinsman King Louis I the Great of Hungary, Croatia and Poland, named him after King Saint Ladislaus I of Hungary.\n\nIn 1401 Ladislaus of Naples married Mary of Lusignan, daughter of King James I of Cyprus and Helvis of Brunswick-Grubenhagen.\n\nMary of Lusignan arrived in Naples in 1402. In the same period, Ladislaus tried to restore Angevin rule in Hungary and Croatia, where some of the nobles opposed King Sigismund.\n\nBetween 1403 and 1414, Ladislaus ordered the painting of a cycle of the Legend of Saint Ladislaus in the church of Santa Maria dell’Incoronata in Naples. In these paintings, the Hungarian king is depicted receiving the royal crown, fighting against the pagans, and receiving the Crown of Croatia. (The cult of Saint Ladislaus and other Hungarian kings was already present in Naples and other Italian regions since the second half of the 13th century, thanks to Mary of Hungary, Queen of Naples, who brought them when she married King Charles II of Naples.)\n\nThis Mary of Hungary, Queen of Naples, (not to be confused with Queen Mary I of Hungary) was a daughter of King Stephen V of Hungary and his wife Elizabeth the Cuman. Mary served as regent in Provence in 1290–1294 and in Naples in 1295–96, 1296–98, and 1302, during the absences of her husband.\n\nConsidering himself the heir of the Kings of Hungary, King Ladislaus of Naples tried many times to obtain the Crown of Hungary and Croatia. He also proclaimed himself Duke of Slavonia, a title with no basis.\n\nHe first negotiated a treaty with the Republic of Venice, ceding the island of Corfu. He thus obtained free passage in the Adriatic Sea and, with the partial support of the Pope, landed at Zadar on July 19, 1403. On August 5, 1403, while in the town of Zara, Ladislaus was crowned King of Hungary and Croatia by János Kanizsai, archbishop of Esztergom, in the presence of the papal legate, Cardinal Angelo Acciajuoli.\n\nEven after his coronation, the rule of Ladislaus in Croatia and Hungary never extended beyond Dalmatia. His father, King Charles III of Naples grew up in Hungary governing Croatia as viceroy, and eventually briefly became King Charles II of Hungary and Croatia.\n\nHowever, Ladislaus remained inactive, and returned to Apulia; his authority in Dalmatia remained restricted to little more than the city of Zara. The following year, after the death of Boniface IX, he intervened in Rome in support of the Colonna family, two days after the election of the new pope, Innocent VII.\n\nDespite having secured the support of the nobility, Sigismund was engaged for the next nine years in a ceaseless struggle for the possession of this unstable throne.\n\nTo ease the pressure from Hungarian nobles, Sigismund tried to employ foreign advisors, which was not popular, and he had to promise not to give land and nominations to anyone other than Hungarian nobles. However, this was not applied to Stibor of Stiboricz, who was Sigismund’s closest friend and advisor. On a number of occasions, Sigismund was imprisoned by nobles, but with the help of the armies of Garai and Stibor of Stiboricz, he was able to regain power.\n\nIn 1396, Sigismund led the combined armies of Christendom against the Turks, who had taken advantage of the temporary helplessness of Hungary to extend their dominion to the banks of the Danube. This crusade, preached by Pope Boniface IX, was very popular in Hungary.\n\nThe nobles flocked in their thousands to the royal standard, and were reinforced by volunteers from nearly every part of Europe. The most important contingent being that of the French led by Duke Jean the Fearless of Burgundy, son of Philippe II, Duke of Burgundy.\n\nSigismund set out with 90,000 men and a flotilla of 70 galleys. After capturing Vidin, he camped with his Hungarian armies before the fortress of Nicopolis. Sultan Bayezid I raised the siege of Constantinople and, at the head of 140,000 men, completely defeated the Christian forces in the Battle of Nicopolis fought between the 25 and 28 September 1396.\n\nKing Sigismund returned by sea and through the realm of Zeta, where he ordained the local Montenegrin lord Đurađ II with the islands of Hvar and Korčula for resistance against the Turks; the islands were returned to Sigismund after Đurađ’s death in April 1403.\n\nThe disaster at Nicopolis angered several Hungarian lords, leading to instability in the kingdom. Deprived of his authority in Hungary, Sigismund then turned his attention to securing his succession to the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia, and was recognized by his childless half-brother King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia, the Romans and Germany, as Vicar-General of the whole Empire. However, he was unable to support Wenceslaus IV when he was deposed in 1400, and Prince Ruprecht, Elector Palatine, was elected King of the Romans and German in his stead.\n\nPrince Ruprecht of the Palatinate (1352 – 1410) a member of the House of Wittelsbach, was Elector Palatine from 1398 (as Ruprecht III) and King the of Romans and Germany from 1400 until his death. He was the son of Prince-Elector Ruprecht II and Infanta Beatrice of Sicily, daughter of daughter of King Peter II of Sicily and his wife Elisabeth of Carinthia.\n\nRuprecht’s great-granduncle was the Wittelsbach Holy Roman Emperor Ludwig IV.\n\nLouis I of Anjou, who claimed the throne of Naples as the adopted son of Queen Joanna I of Naples, never actually ruled the Kingdom of Naples despite his coronation at Avignon as King of Naples by Antipope Clement VII. Louis was forced to remain in France and Joanna’s troops were defeated by Charles of Durazzo, (King Charles III of Naples) her second cousin and previous heir.\n\nLouis I of Anjou died on September 10, 1384, enabling his rival, King Charles III of Naples, to stabilize his rule in Southern Italy during the next months. The consolidation of King Charles III’s position in Naples also contributed to the formation of a party of noblemen who supported his claim to Hungary.\n\nJohn Horvat, Ban of Macsó (now Mačva in Serbia), and his brother, Paul Horvat, Bishop of Zagreb, were the leading Hungarian nobles of their movement.\n\nKing Charles III of Naples landed at Senj in Dalmatia in September 1385 and marched to Zagreb. Sigismund left Buda and mortgaged the territories west of the River Vág to his Moravian cousins. Charles III of Naples had meanwhile left Zagreb, stating that he wanted to restore peace and public order in Hungary.\n\nMany Hungarian noblemen joined Charles III of Naples who marched towards Buda. Queen Mary and her mother, Dowager Queen Elizabeth, received him ceremoniously before he reached Buda, and he entered the capital in the two queens’ company in early December 1385.\n\nQueen Mary renounced the Crown of Hungary without resistance in the middle of December out of fear that Charles would kill her. Charles first adopted the title governor, but the Diet elected him King. Charles was crowned King of Hungary in Székesfehérvár on December 31st, 1385. As King he was King Charles II of Hungary.\n\nAccording to the contemporaneous Lorenzo de Monacis, Mary and her mother, who attended Charles’s coronation, visited Louis the Great’s tomb during the ceremony where they burst into tears because of their ill fate.\n\nKing Charles II of Hungary did not detain Mary and her mother who continued to live in the royal palace in Buda. Queen Elizabeth and Nicholas Garai decided to get rid of King Charles II. They persuaded Blaise Forgách, the master of the cupbearers, to join them, promising him the domain of Gimes (now Jelenec in Slovakia) if he murdered the king.\n\nUpon Dowager Queen Elizabeth’s request, King Charles II visited her and her daughter on February 7, 1386. During the meeting, Blaise Forgách attacked the king, seriously injuring him on the head. The wounded King Charles II and he was carried to Visegrád where he died on February 24th, 1386.\n\nMary was restored to the throne, with her mother ruling in her name. The Queen Mother informed the citizens of Kőszeg already on February 14th that “Queen Mary had regained the Holy Crown”.\n\nHowever, the Horvat brothers rose up in open rebellion on behalf of the murdered king’s son, now King Ladislaus of Naples, who also had his sights on obtaining the thrones of Hungary and Croatia.\n\nMary’s husband, Sigismund, and his brother, King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia and Germany invaded Upper Hungary in April. After weeks of negotiations, Queen Mary and Dowager Queen Elizabeth acknowledged Sigismund’s position as King Consort in a treaty which was signed in Győr in early May.\n\nAfter a series of rebellions where both Queen Dowager Elizabeth and Queen Mary were imprisoned, (more on that in another blog entry), Mary met her husband in Zagreb, Croatia on July 4th. She officially remained Sigismund’s co-ruler until the end of her life, but her influence on government was minimal. Though a King Consort at this time Sigismund was the sovereign via Jure Uxoris (a Latin phrase meaning “by right of (his) wife”).\n\nKing Sigismund’s land grants were always confirmed with Queen Mary’s own Great Seal during the first year of their common rule, but thereafter the grantees rarely sought her confirmation. Royal charters counted her regnal years not from her ascension, but from her husband’s coronation.\n\nQueen Mary persuaded her husband to dismember John Horvat who was captured in July 1394 although King Sigismund would have been willing to spare his life.\n\nQueen Mary was pregnant when she decided to venture out alone on a hunt in a Buda forest on May 17, 1395. Her horse tripped, threw her and fell on top of her. The trauma induced labor and she gave birth prematurely to a son.\n\nThe Queen succumbed to the fatal injuries; being far from any kind of assistance, her son died as well. She was buried in the cathedral of Várad (now Oradea in Romania). Mary’s sister, Queen Jadwiga of Poland, claimed the Crowns of Hungary and Croatia, but Sigismund retained both crowns and became King of Hungry and Croatia in his own right.\n\nSeven days after the death of King Louis the Great of Poland, Hungary and Croatia and leaving no make heirs, his eldest daughter Mary of Anjou was crowned “King” of Hungary on September 17, 1382. Mary’s titles of “King of Hungary” and Queen of Croatia, along with her rapid coronation in the absence of her fiancé, Sigismund, Count of Luxembourg, show that her mother and her mother’s supporters wanted to emphasize Mary’s role as monarch and to postpone or even hinder Sigismund’s coronation.\n\nAll royal charters issued during the first six months of Mary’s reign emphasized that she had lawfully inherited her father’s crown. However, most Hungarian noblemen were strongly opposed to the very idea of a female monarch. Despite officially having the title of King historians have called her the Queen of Hungary.\n\nWhile Mary of Anjou was begrudgingly accepted as monarch of Hungary, Sigismund vied for the Crown of Poland as well. However, the Poles were unwilling to submit to a German sovereign, nor did they want to be tied to Hungary.\n\nThere were Hungarian nobles who did not support Mary as the monarch of Hungary and instead regarded King Charles III of Naples as Louis the Great’s legitimate heir because Charles III of Naples was the last male offspring of the Capetian House of Anjou.\n\nQueen Mary’s fiancé, Sigismund, who had stayed in Poland, returned to Hungary. Bodzanta, Archbishop of Gniezno, the Nałęcz family, and their allies in Greater Poland favored a native prince, Siemowit IV of Masovia to be King of Poland. To avoid a civil war, Dowager Queen Elizabeth (Elizabeth of Bosnia) Queen Mary’s mother, who had assumed the regency, sent envoys to the Polish noblemen’s next assembly which met in Sieradz in late February 1383.\n\nDowager Queen Elizabeth absolved the Polish noblemen from their oath of loyalty to Mary in favor of Mary’s younger sister, Jadwiga, in early 1383, who became a Queen Regnant of Poland.\n\nSigismund of Luxembourg came to Buda and persuaded Dowager Queen Elizabeth to give her consent to his marriage to Mary.\n\nThe marriage took place in Buda in October, but Sigismund was not crowned King of Hungary at this point and received no governmental function. The Dowager Queen Elizabeth convoked a new Diet and Queen Mary again confirmed the noblemen’s liberties, but the Queens’ rule remained unpopular.\n\nSince King Louis I the Great of Hungary, Poland and Croatia had not fathered any sons, there was an expectation that he would bequeath the crowns of Hungary, Poland, and Croatia, along with his claims to the Kingdom of Naples and Provence, to his daughters, Catherine of Hungary 1370 –1378), heiress to the throne; Mary, also known as Maria of Anjou (1371 – 1395), and Jadwiga, also known as Hedwig, (1373 or 1374 – 1399). This made them desirable spouses for members of the European Royal families.\n\nCatherine of Hungary\n\nThe eldest daughter, Catherine of Hungary, was betrothed to Prince Louis de Valois of France, Duke of Orléans, the second son of King Charles V of France and Joanna of Bourbon and was the younger brother of Charles VI of France. The arranged marriage of Louis de Valois and Catherine of Hungary occurred when she was only four years old, and he was only two years of age. Their marriage was supposed to establish a connection between the two branches of the French royal House.\n\nThus, Catherine was expected to reign over Hungary, Croatia and Poland. Her father also planned to leave her his claim to the Crown of Naples and the County of Provence, which were then held by his ailing and childless cousin Queen Joanna I of Naples, Countess of Provence, (1325 – 27 July 1382) the eldest daughter of Charles, Duke of Calabria and Marie of Valois to survive infancy.\n\nCatherine of Hungary was supposed to be married to Louis upon reaching marriageable age, and he would retain the rights to the Kingdom of Naples even if the marriage were childless and Catherine were to predecease him, while Provence would become a hereditary fiefdom of the House of Valois.\n\nKing Charles V of France asked Catherine’s father King Louis the Great to have Catherine recognised as heir presumptive to the Holy Crown of Hungary; although Provence was important to Charles in establishing a cadet branch of the House of Valois on the throne of Provence, the Hungarian throne was also significant, as Catherine’s prospect of becoming Queen of Naples was not very realistic.\n\nDeath and aftermath\n\nHowever, Catherine died at the age of seven, predeceasing both her father and her cousin Queen Joanna of Naples. The agreement between her father and the noblemen became null and void.\n\nPrince Louis de Valois, Duke of Orléans eventually married Valentina Visconti of Milan. Louis was unpopular with the citizens of Paris due to his reputation for womanizing and his role in the Bal des Ardents tragedy, which resulted in the deaths of four French nobles and the near death of the king himself.\n\nHe was assassinated in 1407 on orders of Jean the Fearless Duke of Burgundy John not only admitted to his role in the murder, but bragged openly about it. What began as a feud between factions of the royal family erupted into open warfare as a result of Louis’s death. Louis’s grandson would later become King Louis XII of France.\n\nMary of Anjou (Hungary)\n\nKing Louis I the Great always had a good and close relationship with Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, and his sons, Prince Wenceslaus, Duke of Luxembourg and Prince Sigismund, Count of Luxembourg.\n\nEmperor Charles IV, and Sigismund was betrothed to Louis’ eldest daughter, Mary of Anjou, in 1374, when he was six years old and Mary but an infant. The marital project aimed to augment the lands held by the House of Luxembourg.\n\nUpon his father, Emperor Charles IV’s death in 1378, young Sigismund became Margrave of Brandenburg and was sent to the Hungarian court, where he soon learned the Hungarian language and way of life, and became entirely devoted to his adopted country. King Louis the Great named him as his heir and appointed him his successor as King of Hungary.\n\nUpon the death of Emperor Charles IV, his eldest son became King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia and later King of the Romans/Germany. His ordinal number “IV” is in reference to the Kingdom of Bohemia and not as King of the Romans/Germany.\n\nIn 1381, the then 13-year-old Prince Sigismund was sent to Kraków by his eldest half-brother and guardian Wenceslaus IV, King of the Romans/Germany and Bohemia, to learn Polish and to become acquainted with the land and its people. King Wenceslaus IV also gave him Neumark to facilitate communication between Brandenburg and Poland.\n\nKing Louis the Great confirmed his promise of the betrothal of Mary of Anjou and Sigismund of Luxembourg in a deed in June 1373. Mary and Sigismund were closely related, because her paternal grandmother, Elizabeth of Poland, was the sister of his great-grandfather, King Casimir III of Poland. Pope Gregory XI issued the dispensation necessary for their marriage on 6 December 1374. The leading Hungarian and Polish lords confirmed Louis’s promise of Mary’s and Sigismund’s marriage on April 14, 1375.\n\nKing Louis the Great summoned the Polish prelates and Lords to Kassa (now Košice in Slovakia) in September 1379, persuading them to acknowledge Mary’s right to succeed him in Poland. The contemporaneous Jan of Czarnków, who was biased against Louis, recorded that the Poles yielded to the monarch’s demand only after he had prevented them from leaving the town by shutting its gates.\n\nAt a meeting with Leopold III, Duke of Austria in early 1380, Louis strongly hinted that he would bequeath Hungary to his younger daughter, Jadwiga, who had been engaged to Leopold III’s son, Wilhelm. Upon Louis’s demand, a delegation of the Polish noblemen again paid homage to Sigismund and Mary on July 25, 1382.\n\nKing Louis the Great wished to divide his kingdoms between his two surviving daughters, but historians Pál Engel and Claude Michaud write that the ailing king wanted to bequeath both Hungary, Croatia and Poland on Mary and Sigismund.\n\nAlbrecht IV of Austria (September 19, 1377 – September 14, 1404) was a Duke of Austria.\n\nAlbrecht IV of Austria was born in Vienna, the son of Duke Albrecht III of Austria and Beatrix of Nuremberg, a member of the House of Hohenzollern and a daughter of Friedrich V, Burgrave of Nuremberg and his wife Elisabeth of Meissen (a Saxony Princess of the House of Wettin).\n\nHe was the Duke of Austria from 1395 until 1404, which then included roughly today’s Lower Austria and most of Upper Austria, as the other Habsburg dominions were at that time ruled by his relatives of the Leopoldinian Line of the family. Albrecht’s rule was characterized by quarrels with that part of his family and with members of the Luxemburg dynasty, Wenceslaus of Luxembourg and Sigismund of Luxembourg.\n\nWenceslaus was King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia from 1378 until his death and King of Germany/King of the Romans from 1376 until he was deposed in 1400. As he belonged to the House of Luxembourg, he was also Duke of Luxembourg from 1383 to 1388. Wenceslaus never held the title of Emperor.\n\nSigismund of Luxembourg was a monarch as King of Hungary and Croatia (jure uxoris) from 1387, King of Germany/Romans from 1410, King of Bohemia from 1419, and Holy Roman Emperor from 1433 until his death in 1437, as well as Prince-Elector of Brandenburg (1378–1388 and 1411–1415). He was the last male member of the House of Luxembourg.\n\nDuke Albrecht IV of Austria died at Klosterneuburg, Lower Austria, in 1404. He is buried in the Ducal Crypt in the Stephansdom in Vienna. He was succeeded by his son as Duke Albrecht V of Austria.\n\nThrough his maternal grandmother, Elisabeth of Meissen, Albrecht IV descended from Babenberg Dukes of Austria.\n\nElisabeth of Meissen was the daughter of Friedrich II, Margrave of Meissen and Mathilde of Bavaria.\n\nThe House of Babenberg was a noble dynasty of Austrian Dukes and Margraves. Originally from Bamberg in the Duchy of Franconia (present-day Bavaria), the Babenbergs ruled the imperial Margraviate of Austria from its creation in 976 AD until its elevation to a duchy in 1156, and from then until the extinction of the line in 1246, whereafter they were succeeded by the House of Habsburg, to which they were related.\n\nThe male line of the Babenbergs became extinct in 1246, when Due Friedrich II of Austria was killed in battle (the Henneberg branch of the Franconian Babenbergs lived on until 1583 when its lands were divided among the two branches of the Wettin family).\n\nFriedrich’s heir general was Gertrude of Austria, the only child of his late elder brother, Heinrich of Austria by that man’s wife, Agnes of Thuringia. However, neither her husbands nor her son succeeded in settling the Babenberg inheritance under their power. Gertrude’s only surviving child, Agnes of Baden, tried to reclaim at least part of her inheritance through her third husband Ulrich II of Heunburg, but was unsuccessful.\n\nAfter some years of struggle known as the Austrian Interregnum, or War of the Babenberg Succession (1246–1256/78/82), the Duchies of Austria and Styria fell to King Ottokar II of Bohemia and then to Count Rudolph I of Habsburg and later German King.\n\nCount Rudolph I (May 1, 1218 – July 15, 1291) was the first King of Germany/King of the Romans from the House of Habsburg. The first of the count-kings of Germany, he reigned from 1273 until his death.\n\nRudolph’s election as King marked the end of the Great Interregnum which had begun after the death of the Hohenstaufen Emperor Friedrich II in 1250. Originally a Swabian count, he was the first Habsburg to acquire the duchies of Austria and Styria in opposition to his mighty rival, the Přemyslid king Ottokar II of Bohemia, whom he defeated in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld.\n\nThe Austrian territories remained under Habsburg rule for more than 600 years, forming the core of the Habsburg monarchy and the present-day country of Austria. Rudolph played a vital role in raising the comital House of Habsburg to the rank of Imperial princes.\n\nDuke Leopold V of Austria, a member of the House of Babenberg and he was known for his involvement in the Third Crusade where he fought in the Siege of Acre in 1191 and of his imprisonment of King Richard of England I in 1193 at Dürnstein Castle.\n\nFamily and children\n\nDuke Albrecht IV of Austria was married in Vienna April 24, 1390 to Joanna Sophia of Bavaria, daughter of Albrecht I, Duke of Bavaria-Straubing and Margarete of Brieg. Their children were:\n\n1. Margarete (1395 – 1447), married in Landshut 25 November 1412 to Duke Heinrich XVI of Bavaria.\n\n2. Duke Albrecht V (1397–1439)."
