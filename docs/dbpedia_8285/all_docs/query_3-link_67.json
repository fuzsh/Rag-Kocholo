        "text": "Both MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) are widely used enterprise database systems. MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS), while MSSQL is a Microsoft-developed RDBMS. Enterprises can choose between multiple MSSQL editions to suit their individual needs and budgets. Savvy programmers and database administrators (DBAs) should think carefully about the difference between MSSQL and MySQL before making their decision to ensure they choose the right RDBMS for their requirements.\n\nThis guide will consider the difference between MySQL and MSSQL, in addition to making a detailed MySQL vs. MSSQL performance comparison. If you’re looking for reliable database performance monitoring and analysis tools, you should consider SolarWinds® Database Performance Analyzer and SQL Sentry as industry-leading solutions.\n\nMySQL vs. SQL Server\n\n– Similarities\n\n– Differences\n\nDatabase Monitoring and Analysis Tools\n\nGetting Started With Database Monitoring\n\nMySQL vs. SQL Server\n\nSQL is the ideal language of choice for relational databases, whether you want to retrieve, edit, or store your data—which is how dynamic applications and websites perform practically every user request. Before engaging in a more nuanced MySQL vs. MSSQL performance comparison, let’s first look at some of the basic similarities and differences between MSSQL and MySQL.\n\nSimilarities Between MySQL and SQL Server\n\nAs both MSSQL and MySQL are relational databases, there are several similarities. Most developers, however, specialize in either one or the other. Although MSSQL and MySQL seem similar, their underlying architecture differs. Here are the key similarities you should know.\n\nPrimary and Foreign Keys\n\nBoth platforms use primary and foreign keys to establish the relationships between tables.\n\nDatabase Performance Speed\n\nYour database is the backbone of your applications and is responsible for storing and returning data as quickly as possible. Both MySQL and MSSQL offer high-performance speed.\n\nRelational Database Table Model\n\nBoth platforms use the standard relational database table model for storing data in columns and rows.\n\nUsage Popularity\n\nAside from Oracle, MySQL and MSSQL are the most common databases for use with web applications. When you sign up for hosting, you’re usually given the choice between MSSQL and MySQL.\n\nScalability With Different Projects\n\nBoth platforms can scale with your company as it grows. They’re suitable for small and large projects and can support millions of transactions every day.\n\nSyntax for Platforms\n\nWhen working with databases like MySQL and MSSQL, developers interact with data using SQL (Structured Query Language) queries. While SQL is a standardized language, you should expect some small differences across varying CRUD (create, read, update, delete) statements.\n\nDifferences in Syntax\n\nMySQL Syntax\n\nFollows the ANSI SQL standard with variations and additional features specific to MySQL.\n\nCase-insensitive by default for table/column names and string comparisons.\n\nSupports both single (”) and double (“”) quotes for string literals.\n\nProvides a rich set of date and time functions.\n\nUses the LIMIT clause for restricting the number of rows returned by a query.\n\nOffers native support for full-text search.\n\nMSSQL Syntax\n\nAdheres to the ANSI SQL standard with its syntax and features.\n\nCase-insensitive by default for table/column names and string comparisons.\n\nPrimarily uses single quotes (”) for string literals.\n\nProvides comprehensive date and time functions.\n\nUtilizes the TOP clause to limit the number of rows a query returns.\n\nOffers full-text search capabilities through specific predicates.\n\nConnection Drivers\n\nFortunately, you can find connection drivers for almost any popular language just by searching the web. This allows you to easily connect to both MySQL and MSSQL without the need for complicated coding.\n\nMSSQL was introduced in 1989, while MySQL was introduced in 1995 as an open-source project. This makes MSSQL several years older than MySQL. As both solutions have been in production for over two decades, they both have a strong foothold in the market. MySQL can run on either Linux or Windows, as part of a LAMP environment. MSSQL runs on Windows and is usually part of a Windows environment.\n\nBoth MySQL and MSSQL can handle small and large software projects, so users should anticipate similar performance levels. No matter which of these servers you choose, performance will primarily rely on your DBA’s ability to optimize queries and code.\n\nDifferences Between MSSQL and MySQL Server\n\nAlthough these platforms are similar, especially in the interface and basic relational database standards, they operate very differently. Most of these differences are accounted for by the underlying architecture and happen in the background, which means they often go unnoticed by the average user. It’s important, however, for DBAs to understand these differences because they play a significant role in your decision-making process.\n\nMultiple Programming Languages Support\n\nBoth MySQL and MSSQL support multiple programming languages, including Java, C++, PHP, Ruby, Python, Delphi, Visual Basic, Go, and R. MySQL supports additional languages like Tcl, Scheme, Perl, Eiffel, and Haskel. Because MySQL is so versatile in its support for programming languages, it’s popular among many developer communities. While you can use both database types for Windows and Linux projects, MySQL works natively with PHP, and MSSQL is mainly used with .NET. Integration is simpler using MySQL for PHP and MSSQL for Windows projects.\n\nOption to Stop Query Execution\n\nIn MySQL, users can stop a specific query thread using the `KILL` command. However, there isn’t a built-in mechanism to halt a query without terminating the entire connection.\n\nIn MSSQL, users can truncate a database query while it’s running without stopping the complete process. This provides more precise control over query execution, ensuring data integrity.\n\nLINQ Queries\n\nMSSQL allows you to set up your entity framework classes in .NET, meaning you can get started with LINQ queries. With MySQL, you’d need to download third-party tools if you wanted to use .NET.\n\nHow to Back Up data\n\nIf you’re using MySQL, you’ll need to back up data by extracting it as SQL statements. The RDBMS provides a tool to block the database while data is backed up. This feature minimizes the chance of data corruption occurring while switching between MySQL versions or editions. The downside is this makes data restoration a time-consuming process because it requires executing multiple SQL statements. MSSQL doesn’t block the database while backing up data, enabling users to back up and restore mass amounts of data with minimal effort.\n\nMyISAM and InnoDB Engines\n\nMyISAM and InnoDB Engines are configurations for MySQL, allowing the developer to perform various design and programming activities. MSSQL doesn’t allow you to specify different engines when you create a database.\n\nIntegrated Development Environment (IDE) Tools Used\n\nBoth MySQL and MSSQL have IDE tools, but you’ll need to match the right tool with the appropriate server. MySQL has MySQL Workbench and MSSQL uses Management Studio. These tools allow you to connect with the server and manage configurations for architecture, security, and table design.\n\nBinary Collections for Developers\n\nMSSQL and MySQL are designed as binary collections. MySQL allows developers to use binaries to manipulate database files even while running. Database files can also be accessed and manipulated by alternative processes at runtime. Conversely, MSSQL doesn’t allow any process to manipulate or access binaries or database files. If you wanted to achieve this, you would need to run an instance. This eliminates the opportunity for hackers to access or directly manipulate data. As such, MSSQL is more secure than MySQL.\n\nCost\n\nMySQL offers both open-source and commercial editions, providing users with flexibility in choosing the version that best suits their needs. The open-source edition of MySQL is freely available, making it a cost-effective option for many users. However, for organizations requiring additional features, support, and enterprise-level capabilities, commercial editions of MySQL are available, albeit at a cost.\n\nOn the other hand, MSSQL is primarily offered through commercial licensing, which entails purchasing licenses for server usage. While MSSQL provides robust features and support options, the associated licensing costs can be higher compared to the open-source version of MySQL.\n\nWhen comparing the cost of MySQL’s commercial editions with MSSQL licensing fees, organizations should consider factors such as their specific requirements, budget constraints, and long-term scalability needs. Additionally, evaluating the total cost of ownership, including maintenance, support, and training expenses, can help businesses make an informed decision regarding the most cost-effective database solution for their needs.\n\nOperating Systems Compatibility\n\nSQL Server was originally developed exclusively for the Windows operating system by Microsoft. However, in recent years, Microsoft has expanded compatibility to include Linux platforms, providing enterprises with the option to deploy SQL Server on both Windows and Linux environments. Despite this expansion, SQL Server does not have native support for installation on macOS.\n\nWhile macOS users do not have direct support for SQL Server installations, alternative methods such as virtualization or containerization solutions may allow for running SQL Server instances on macOS environments.\n\nJSON Support\n\nMySQL provides robust JSON support through dedicated data types and functions, facilitating efficient storage and retrieval of JSON data in applications. Similarly, MSSQL offers JSON support with its data type and functions, ensuring compatibility with JSON-centric applications.\n\nScalability\n\nMySQL is well known for its scalability, supporting various replication methods like coordinator-agents and clustering to achieve horizontal scalability. In contrast, MSSQL is designed for both vertical and horizontal scalability, featuring options such as Always On Availability Groups and support for distributed queries and partitioning.\n\nStorage Engines\n\nMySQL distinguishes itself with support for multiple storage engines, with InnoDB being the default and widely used option. InnoDB comes with features such as ACID compliance, transactions, and foreign key constraints. Conversely, MSSQL primarily relies on a single storage engine but compensates with a comprehensive feature set, including table and index partitioning, full-text search, and column store indexes.\n\nSolarWinds Database Performance Analyzer (DPA)\n\n© 2024 SolarWinds Worldwide, LLC.
