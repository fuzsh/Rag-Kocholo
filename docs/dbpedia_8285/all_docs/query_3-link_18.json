Furthermore at some point it crashes and I does not send data anymore (I don't know why)\n\nThe second one is new for me I see that you create an add.php file or something like that but I am not sure how to use this. I searched some info on the internet but I didn't find anything. Nevertheless I saw on this forum that someone made something similar. So I would appreciate it a lot a lot if someone can give me an example including the steps and the code for using the second option\n\nBest regards,\n\nCesar.\n\nblimpyway:\n\nSince it's clear you have little understanding about HOW to achieve what you want to achieve, you will be better of describing WHAT you want to achieve instead of telling us about your misunderstandings upon HOWs\n\nSo people here having better knowledge upon functional HOWs will describe them to you instead.\n\nBetter speak about platforms and processes like\n\nwhich operating system mysql is running on laptop/PC/other\n\nwhich arduino board you intend to use, if you decided already\n\nand if not, you'll have to describe in detail what are the inputs/processing that have to be done on the arduino itself.\n\nwhat kind of communication you desire/are required between the two above (e.g. wired, wireless, across continents, etc..)\n\nhow much data that needs to be stored in database arduino generates\n\nhow fast the above data is generated\n\nStuff like that.\n\n-Which operating system: MySQL Workbench\n\n-Which arduino board: ATMEGA2560\n\nI use to digital pins from the arduino that gives me HIGH other LOW signal depending on the measurement of the dust sensor (which by the way it is a DSM501a)\n\nCommunication: I have to use (I prefer to use) a Wireless shield\n\nHow much data: 4 tables with 20 values\n\nhow fast the data is generated: every second if possible\n\nHopefully you can help me. What I need to know is an example of a php file that I have to include for making the connection between the arduino and the mysql workbench, and where do I put this file\n\nI saw a tutorial:\n\nbut it uses phpadmin and XXamp\n\nThanks in advance if you can help\n\nRegards,\n\nCesar\n\nOperating systems are named \"Windows\", \"Mac OS\", \"Linux\" or \"OS/2\"\n\nPrograming languages are \"C\", \"C++\", \"C#\", \"VB\", \"Perl\", \"Ruby\", \"Python\", \"Java\", \"Objective-C\", \"Javascript\" and yeah \"PHP\" is also just another language.\n\n\"Mysql Connector\" is a generic term for any library that can be used by any code written in a specific programming language on a specific operating system to interact with a mysql database backend..\n\nThat means you must use a specific \"connector\" library for the specific language/os combination of your choice.\n\n\"Mysql Workbench\" is not an operating system, it seems it's a visual interface program/tool for human interface/interaction to the database backend. Most likely, NOT meant to be used for general program to database interface, otherwise they wouldn't need to have all those \"connectors\" in the first place.\n\nCan not tell much about PHP, I never used it, you have any good reason to use it or you just weren-t aware there are so many other options?\n\nI'm asking it because PHP is specifically tailored to write server-side web applications and that might not be the simplest route to get the data from arduino to the database.\n\nYou might be more successful by asking these questions on this board: Interfacing w/ Software on the Computer - Arduino Forum\n\nHi Paul thanks a lot for your contribution it really helped me. I have one question I am following this tutorial:\n\nand I need to know where to save the php file when using MySQL workbench. It says for example in this tutorial:\n\n\"\"2. Put the “write_data.php” file in the right folder\n\nIf you are using XAMPP you will need to place the file in the “C:\\xampp\\htdocs” directory (or if your XAMPP install directory is different use that directory\\htdocs).\n\nOR\n\nIf you are using an online web page, you will need to place the file in the “public_html/www” directory.\"\"\n\nIn the case of Workbench where is this folder.\n\nBest regards, and thanks a lot for your help\n\nSebastian\n\nHi Sebastian or Cesar (or whatever you want to be called, please decide)\n\nThe location where php scripts are kept has nothing to do with Mysql Workbench. The Workbench is a tool for creating databases.\n\nWhat determines where php scripts are kept is the webserver, which is a separate concept and component of a system compared to a database, although they are usually used together.\n\nThere is a good chance that the webserver you are using is one called Apache. You may have heard of \"LAMP\", which refers to a bundle of applications that often go together. The \" L\" stands for Linux, \"A\" stands for Apache, the \"M\" stands for MySql and \"P\" stands for PHP.\n\nIn Apache, the php scripts are kept in the public_html folder. You normally have to copy them to that location using an FTP application on your PC.\n\nI did not install Apache myself. I pay an annual subscription for a small virtual server on the internet. It came with Apache pre-installed and working. It sounds like your Apache is not installed or configured correctly, but I do not know enough about it to help you with that.\n\nAs blimpyway said, there are other forums and website where you can get help with LAMP/WAMP. Those forums won't be able to help you with the Arduino side of your project.\n\nThere are example sketches from the MySQL Connector Arduino Library that I think you should check out, if you haven't yet. They will help you understand using the library a bit more, and you can actually try sending/receiving some data from your mySQL database. Depending on whether or not you're accessing the DB server remotely, you'll have to set up the server to ensure remote access is enabled (creating users with all privileges granted, opening up ports from the firewall setting, bind-address option removed, etc.).\n\nHere's a link of one of the example sketches:"
