        "text": "In this article I am going to teach you how to connect MySQL Database with .NET Core 6 using Entity Framework.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nMySQL Server — Here we use XAMPP.\n\nVisual Studio 2022\n\n.NET Core 6\n\nStep 1 - Create a new project using Visual Studio 2022\n\nOpen Visual Studio -> Create New Project -> Select C# as the language -> Type “mvc” -> Select ASP .NET Core Web App\n\nEnter a name for the project and then select .NET 6.0 as the target framework, select None as the authentication because we are not going to deal with authentication and then enable Configure for HTTPS. Finally create the new project.\n\nStep 2 — Install Required Packages\n\nAfter creating the new project now we are going to install all the required packages to our project. To install packages to project you have to follow below steps.\n\nOpen your project in Visual Studio -> Tools -> NuGet Package Manager-> Manage NuGet Packages for Solution…\n\nThen go to browse and install below packages.\n\n1. Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore (In this project we are using version 6.0.3)\n\n2. Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools (In this project we are using version 6.0.3)\n\n3. Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql (In this project we are using version 6.0.1)\n\nStep 3 — Create a Global Imports file\n\nIn this step we create a new file in the root directory of our project folder called “GlobalUsings.cs”. Inside this file we put all the packages as global imports. Because of that we don’t need to import required packages in other files.\n\n**Notice — “BulkyBookWeb” has to be changed according to your project name.\n\nStep 4 — Create a Model Class\n\nHere we create a category model and that model consists all the properties about that model. For that create a new class file called “Category.cs” inside the Models folder in your project.\n\n**Notice — namespaces can be changed according to your project name and folder names.\n\nStep 5 — Create DBContext and Add Connection String\n\nCreate a new folder called “Data” in root directory and create a new class file called “ApplicationDbContext.cs”.\n\nThen we have to create the connection string in our project. Connection string is used to represent all the credentials to connect with database. We can directly put that string when we need it. But since it is a sensitive data we are put it in our “appsettings.json” file.\n\n*Notice — Database name, Username and the password can be changed according to your Database server.\n\nStep 7 — Add Migrations and Update the Database\n\nFirst open XAMPP and start MySQL. Then go to -> Tools -> NuGet Package Manager-> Package Manager Console. Then type the following command to create migration.\n\nNow You can see there is a new folder called “Migrations” and inside that folder we can see some files. Those files represent all the details about relevant Database Migration.\n\nAs the final step now you have to update the database according to the migration. To update the database run following command.\n\nNow go to Database. You can see there is a new Database and inside that database we have the new table.\n\nTo See the full article.
