        "text": "Exactly my case.\n\nThis is only supposed to run on localhost, I’m not planning to host it.\n\nI’ll go take a brief look at the link.\n\nThanks for the rapid reply!\n\np.s: At first I didn’t understand why people would rather avoid MySQL either, but I guess by doing that they have less components to worry about and the project is simpler as a whole. (Speaking of local games, which are not supposed to be hosted of course.)\n\np.p.s: I took a look and I’m even more grateful, it contains everything I’d need, I’ll just have to go and understand it all. Takes some time I guess!\n\nHuge thanks to you!!\n\nFor a local database (I.E: hosted on the client’s machine), yes, though it’s not really “hacking”.\n\nIf you need data to be secure, never save it client-side.\n\nSecure data should be stored on a server-side database, and the client shouldn’t directly connect to that database, rather it should connect to another server-side web API that acts as the middle-man between the client and the database.\n\nBut, this really all depends on what data you want to secure, and if it’s even worth the trouble setting up a server hosting environment.\n\nIf you need to save personal user information such as emails, passwords, addresses, identity, etc. then yes, server-side data storage is an absolute must.\n\nIf you’re just saving general game data such as player information, levels, unlocks, items, etc. then server-side data is not really needed. Sure, the user could modify the data in the client database to cheat, but if it’s just a single-player game, then it’s really not an issue. They aren’t doing any real harm by cheating in a single-player game.\n\nThanks for reply, i am referring to that @RNOVAKOSKY_1 refers to the fact that the MYSQL driver must be used directly in the project, the thing is … Then a server and a client must be made separately, right? Because if the connection data is visible on the client it is possible that they will be able to reverse engineer and extract the data from the database.\n\nRegarding the type of data … Let’s say it would be for an MMORPG"
