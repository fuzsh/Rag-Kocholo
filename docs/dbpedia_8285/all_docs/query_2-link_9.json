        "text": "It is a well-known fact that software testing company actively uses databases in its activity. Performing banking application testing or e-commerce testing, the specialists use peculiar tools for working with the data warehouses.\n\nSQL is a language of the structured queries. This language allows managing and manipulating the relational types of databases.\n\nWhy Does MySQL Act as the SQL Dev-Tool?\n\nVisual editor SQL is implemented in MySQL Workbench.\n\nDue to the SQL editor, developers can create, edit and send queries through the MySQL server databases.\n\nThe numerous sent queries and their results are demonstrated in different tables. Everything is carried out automatically.\n\nAll queries are stored in the history panel for further their searching and launching.\n\nBesides this, the row highlighter by various colors is available for the MySQL Workbench syntaxes. This significantly simplifies the SQL writing and debugging process for developers.\n\nExecuting security testing the specialists pay special attention to the server administration. Many aspects should be considered for the corporate data safety. It includes user management, server configuration, its logs, and etc. Software testing will be less difficult if one uses MySQL server for data management.\n\nWhat Features Simplify the MySQL Server Administration?"
