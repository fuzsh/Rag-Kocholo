        "text": "What is MySQL?\n\nMySQL is an open source relational database.\n\nMySQL is cross platform which means it runs on a number of different platforms such as Windows, Linux, and Mac OS etc.\n\nIn this MySQL Workbench tutorial, you will learn-\n\nWhy use MySQL?\n\nThere are a number of relational database management systems on the market.\n\nExamples of relational databases include Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, Oracle, DB2 etc.\n\nOne may ask why we would choose MySQL over the other database management systems.\n\nThe answer to this question depends on a number of factors.\n\nLet’s look at the strengths of MySQL compared to over relational databases such as SQL Server–\n\nMySQL supports multiple storage engines each with its own specifications while other systems like SQL server only support a single storage engine. In order to appreciate this statement, let’s look at two of the storage engines supported by MySQL.\n\nInnoDB: – its default storage engine provided with MySQL as of version 5.5. InnoDB supports foreign keys for referential integrity and also supports ACID-standard transactions.\n\nMyISAM: – it was the default storage engine for MySQL prior to version 5.5. MyISAM lacks support for transactions. Its advantages over InnoDB include simplicity and high performance.\n\nMySQL has high performance compared to other relation database systems. This is due to its simplicity in design and support for multiple-storage engines.\n\nCost effective, it’s relatively cheaper in terms of cost when compared to other relational databases. In fact, the community edition is free. The commercial edition has a licensing fee which is also cost effective compared to licensing fees for products such as Microsoft SQL Server.\n\nCross platform – MySQL works on many platforms which means it can be deployed on most machines. Other systems such as MS SQL Server only run on the windows platform.\n\nIn order to interact with MySQL, you will need a server access tool that can communicate with MySQL server. MySQL supports multiple user connections.\n\nWhat is MySQL Workbench?\n\nMySQL Workbench is a Visual database designing and modeling access tool for MySQL server relational database. It facilitates creation of new physical data models and modification of existing MySQL databases with reverse/forward engineering and change management functions. The purpose of MySQL workbench is to provide the interface to work with databases more easily and in a more structured way.\n\nMySQL workbench – Modeling and Design Tool\n\nModels are at the core of most valid and high performance databases. MySQLworkbench has tools that allow developers and database administrators visually create physical database design models that can be easily translated into MySQL databases using forward engineering.\n\nMySQL workbench supports creation of multiple models in the same environment.\n\nIt supports all objects such as tables, views, stored procedures, triggers, etc. that make up a database.\n\nMySQL workbench has a built in model validating utility that reports any issues that might be found to the data modeler.\n\nIt also allows for different modeling notations and can be extended by using LUA a scripting language.\n\nThe figure shown below shows the modeling window for MySQLWorkbench.\n\nMySQL workbench – SQL development tool\n\nStructured Query Language (SQL) allows us to manipulate our relational databases. SQL is at the heart of all relational databases.\n\nMySQLworkbench, has built in SQL visual editor.\n\nThe Visual SQL editor allows developers to build, edit and run queries against MySQL server databases. It has utilities for viewing data and exporting it.\n\nIts syntax color highlighters help developers easily write and debug SQL statements.\n\nMultiple queries can be run and results automatically displayed in different tabs.\n\nThe queries are also saved in the history panel for later retrieval and running.\n\nThe figure shown below shows the SQL development window for MySQL Workbench.\n\nHow To Use MySQL Workbench – Administration tool\n\nServer administration plays a critical role in securing the data of the company. The major issues concerning server administration are users’ management, server configuration, server logs and many more. Workbench MySQL has the following features that simplify the process of MySQL server administration;\n\nUser administration – visual utility for managing users that lets database administrators easily add new and remove existing users if need arises, grant and drop privileges and view user profiles.\n\nServer configuration – allows for advanced configuration of the server and fine tuning for optimal performance.\n\nDatabase backup and restorations – visual tool for exporting/importing MySQL dump files. MySQL dump files contain SQL scripts for creating databases, tables, views, stored procedures and insertion of data.\n\nServer logs – visual tool for viewing MySQL server logs. The logs include error logs, binary logs and InnodDB logs. These logs come in handy when performing diagnosis on the server. The figure shown below shows the modeling window for MySQL Workbench.\n\nThe figure shown below shows the Admin panel for Workbench MySQL.\n\nHow to Install MySQL workbench (for Windows)\n\nIn this MySQL Workbench tutorial for beginners, we will learn how to install and use MySQL Workbench.\n\nInstall MySQL workbench is a 2 step process.\n\n1) Install MySQL Community Server\n\n2) Install MySQL workbench – You can install the workbench using a zip file or an msi installer (recommended)\n\nNote: You will require Administrator or Power User Privileges to perform installation.\n\nGetting Started\n\nOnce you have finished installing above you need to set up MySQL Workbench as shown below-\n\nFollowing is a step by step process on How to Install MySQL workbench.\n\nStep 1) Open Home Window\n\nFirst step is launching the Workbench MySQL. What you see is called Home Window\n\nStep 3) Click Configure Server Management button\n\nAs a beginner you can create a connection for a locally installed server. Click Configure Server Management button in Setup New Connection window to check the cofiguration of the MySQL server.\n\nStep 4) Click Next button to continue\n\nA new window opens named Configure Local Management. Click Next button to continue.\n\nStep 5) Enter your password and press OK\n\nNext the Wizard will test connections to database. If test fails, go back and correct database connection parameters.5. Next it will open a pop up window asking your root password to test your connection with the local mysql server instance. The password is the one you set during installation of MySQL Workbench. Enter your password and press OK\n\nStep 6) Click Next to continue\n\nNext the Wizard will test connections to database. If test fails, go back and correct database connection parameters. Else if all tests are sucessful click Next to continue.\n\nStep 7) Click Next\n\nAfter that a new wizard will open about Local Service Management – It lets you switch between multiple mysql severs installed on one machines. As a beginner you can bypass this and click Next to continue.\n\nStep 8) Select MySQL Server Configuration File\n\nThe Wizard will then check ability to access MySQL Server Configuration File, and test start/stop commands.\n\nStep 9) Click Finish to finsh server cofiguration\n\nNext you can review current configurations. After reviewing the configurations, Click Finish to finsh server cofiguration\n\nStep 10) Click on Test Connection\n\nNext Step is to setup a connection, which can be used to connect to server. If you have not created a connection already, you can use the default values given. Click on Test Connection [ 2 ] after entering the Connection Name [ 1 ].\n\nStep 11) Click OK\n\nA new dialog box will open asking you password to root/selected user. If your MySQL root user has a password, you can enter that using Store in Vault feature. Click OK.\n\nIf the entered password for the user is correct then the following screen will show. Click on both OK buttons and you will be good to go.\n\nA new instance is shown in the homepage.\n\nDouble click and start querying.\n\nSummary"
