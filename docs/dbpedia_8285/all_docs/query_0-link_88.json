Here we explain three of the many hats it wears.\n\nStudio 3T as a MongoDB client\n\nA client is a software program or application that allows you to connect to a server. Go wild with Studio 3T’s Connection Manager and connect to as many MongoDB servers as you need.\n\nStudio 3T as a MongoDB GUI\n\nA Graphical User Interface (GUI) does exactly as it says. It provides a user interface with graphical menus, icons, dialogs, wizards, and other visual elements. The alternative to using a MongoDB GUI would be to use the mongo shell, though Studio 3T still has IntelliShell – an easy-to-navigate, built-in version – for when you need one.\n\nStudio 3T as a MongoDB IDE\n\nAn Integrated Development Environment (IDE) consolidates the many aspects of application and database development into one fully-featured “studio” environment. Studio 3T does exactly that by providing a GUI that has editors with auto-completion and syntax highlighting, built-in JSON validation, automatic query code generation in seven languages, and many other features that help you work faster and save time.\n\nIt’s a fact: 3T will save you time\n\nThe amount of time saved within the entire org using the Visual Query Builder is well worth the price of licenses!\n\nEric Hirshfield-Yamanishi, SDET, FloQast\n\nAs a startup, you need to be agile, you develop in sprints, with a NoSQL database for extra flexibility, etc. Studio 3T is the perfect companion when you start to take your software into production, it's the fastest and most ergonomic way to keep a grip on your data.\n\nJurgen Goens, CEO, lilo.global\n\nAfter evaluating all other options within the team, Studio 3T easily won the competition. It's hard to imagine working with MongoDB without Studio 3T anymore.\n\nSlava Levs, Lead Developer, Viriciti\n\nHighly efficient interface to MongoDB which provides valuable productivity savings.\n\nGeoff Parkin, Head of Data, Motorsport Statistics\n\nStudio 3T is the tops for me. In only 30 minutes, I can gain one whole day of work when building aggregation queries.\n\nPierre Yves Folens, DevOps Engineer, Orange\n\nFor startup founders like me, tools have to be easy to use. Studio 3T is just that. Thanks for building it.\n\nTom Brückner, CEO, Marble AR\n\nThank you for providing me with a free student licence.
