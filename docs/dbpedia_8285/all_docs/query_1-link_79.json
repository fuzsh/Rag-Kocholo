        "text": "So I'm trying to use databases for my website. I installed MySQL, and for the life of me I can't figure it out. I did a little bit of Access DB building back in college but this is a whole different world.\n\n1. No nice GUI like Access. Can't visually see and make relationships to tables. I'm using phpmyadmin.\n\n2. I want to start by creating two tables: one for properties (EstateID primary key, street, city, zip, #baths, RealtorID, etc) and one for the realtor (RealtorID primary key, fname, lname, phone #, etc). I want to link the Estate table to the Realtor table using the RealtorID as a foreign key. Apparently foreign keys are not supported in the default MySQL table? Uhhhh... aren't foreign keys one of the foundations in ALL relational databases? It's relational. Different tables in a single database are linked through foreign keys and related to each other... I HAVE to be missing something...\n\nWithout foreign keys don't you just have a bunch of tables that can't be linked to each other?\n\nOriginally posted by: blahblah99\n\nYou'd have to link it via an sql statement using LEFT, RIGHT, or MIDDLE JOIN.\n\nIt's not like MSSQL where you can create views and stored procedures.\n\nMYSQL takes a little more programming to make full use of it, and as a result it OWNS mssql anytime of the week.\n\nSmall websites are more suited to mysql, but soon as you move to multi-core and enterprise environments it gets spanked by oracle, postgresql and mssql and certainly lacks the features that one would expect in those environments.\n\nOriginally posted by: fuzzybabybunny\n\nSo for small websites should I just stick with Access because it's easier and faster to learn?\n\nVery small you can get away with it, but I think it would be worth your while learning some mysql to progress your skills set for future websites.\n\n1. No nice GUI like Access. Can't visually see and make relationships to tables. I'm using phpmyadmin.\n\nThere are a few GUI admin tools for MySQL, although I haven't used them. You might even be able to use Access if you have the proper connectivity to the MySQL server and the MySQL ODBC driver installed and configured.\n\nApparently foreign keys are not supported in the default MySQL table? Uhhhh... aren't foreign keys one of the foundations in ALL relational databases? It's relational. Different tables in a single database are linked through foreign keys and related to each other... I HAVE to be missing something...\n\nI'm not sure if MyISAM does FKs by default stuff like that was one of the reasons that InnoDB became the default table format in recent versions.\n\nWithout foreign keys don't you just have a bunch of tables that can't be linked to each other?\n\nPretty much. Without FKs you'll have to do all of the link verification on your own.\n\nMYSQL takes a little more programming to make full use of it, and as a result it OWNS mssql anytime of the week.\n\nActually MSSQL is a damn good product and kills MySQL is a lot of areas. The only real area that MySQL has an advantage is in momentum because of the licensing. Well that and it runs on more platforms than MSSQL so it's an option whether the server runs Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, etc where as with MSSQL the host has to run Windows.\n\nSo for small websites should I just stick with Access because it's easier and faster to learn?\n\nNo, at best Access should be used for prototyping things. I can't imagine it being a good idea for anything in production.\n\nMySQL has a suite of GUI tools. I have used them, but I don't usually do visual table design so I don't recall how strong they are in that area.\n\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/downloads/gui-tools/5.0.html\n\nI wouldn't use Access for any site that needs to be reliable and perform well. The key difference between Access and a real database engine is that Access doesn't have a database engine. It's just a file sitting in a location, potentially shared, and all the data manipulation is done on the client, which would be your webserver in this case.\n\nOriginally posted by: blahblah99\n\nYou'd have to link it via an sql statement using LEFT, RIGHT, or MIDDLE JOIN.\n\nIt's not like MSSQL where you can create views and stored procedures.\n\nMYSQL takes a little more programming to make full use of it, and as a result it OWNS mssql anytime of the week.\n\nMySQL doesn't support views? Or stored procedures? Maybe you thought OP was still talking about Access?\n\nFuzzy, I haven't worked on MySQL in almost a year, so I can't toss syntax at you, but generally the \"foreign key-ness\" of a column is not a property of the column, but rather of a constraint placed on the table. A foreign key constraint says that for table A with column B, B must reference a valid row in table C with column D, where A.B == C.D.\n\nA GUI front-end might let you set the foreign key properties of a column, but what it is really doing is adding a CONSTRAINT clause to the table definition.\n\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refma...n-key-constraints.html\n\nOriginally posted by: RedSquirrel\n\nThe only real use for access is for a single user db that you know wont get very big. If it's something that grows, then code a proper web based app and use mysql, or other db system.\n\nI beg to differ. Access can be used to do a LOT of things it wasn't 'designed' for. Since you have access to VBA you can hook into ActiveX controls which allows Access to do all sorts of crazy stuff. We had a real time trading system based off of 3 Access databases as a prototype before it was written developed in C# and it worked just fine. Obviously there were lots of limitations, but for a proof of concepts it works great for rapid development.\n\nThe de-facto gui tool for mysql has to be navicat. It doesn't do visual table design and mysql doesn't have diagrams as a first class concept like mssql so I can't help you there. Probably could use access, visio or something like erwin if the connectors are there. mysql is very command line oriented. Sun has guis for mysql but they are primitive IMO.\n\nProbably one of the most confusing things to mysql newbs are the database storage engines. It seems crazy that there are options like myisam that don't support referential integrity but believe it or not it may sometime come in handy. In certain edge cases myisam tables can scream if you're willing to take the bad with the good. Personally I'd rather have the database manage the referential integrity for me."
