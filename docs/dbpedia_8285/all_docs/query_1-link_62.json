        "text": "In the Database tool window ( View | Tool Windows | Database) , click New and select Connect to Database.\n\nIf you have a connection string for the database defined in your solution or elsewhere, leave the Use connection string option selected and choose MySQL in the Database type selector.\n\nUse the String selector to choose the desired connection string from your solution or type it in manually, then click Connect.\n\nYou can also choose Add data source manually, click Next and select MySQL in the Database source selector. Follow the wizard steps to form the connection string by configuring individual options.\n\nTo access all available options for the new database connection, click in the Database window, then click New and select MySQL.\n\nCheck if there is a Download missing driver files link at the bottom of the connection settings area. Click this link to download drivers that are required to interact with a database. For a direct download link, refer to the JetBrains JDBC drivers page.\n\nLocation for the downloaded JDBC drivers is the JetBrains Rider configuration directory.\n\nYou can also use your drivers for the database instead of the provided ones. For more information about connecting to a database with your driver, refer to Add a user driver to an existing connection.\n\nIf there is no Download missing driver files link, then you already have the required drivers.\n\nSpecify the database connection details. Alternatively, paste the JDBC URL in the URL field.\n\nIn the Host field, type your server address.\n\nIn the Port field, type the port of MySQL. The default port is 3306.\n\nFrom the Authentication list, select the authentication method that you want to use to authenticate the connection. The following options are available:\n\nUser & Password: by using your login and password.\n\nNo auth: authentication is not required.\n\nIn the User and Password fields, type your user credentials.\n\nTo use no password, leave the Password field empty.\n\nTo delete a once entered password, right-click the Password field and select Set Empty.\n\nIn the Database field, type the database name to which you want to connect.\n\nIn the URL field, JetBrains Rider generates the JDBC URL automatically using the values of other connection settings.\n\nIf you need to use a JDBC URL with certain additional settings, paste it in the URL field. The general URL to use is as follows:\n\nFormat: jdbc:mysql://address=(protocol=tcp)(host=<host_address>)(port=<port_number>)/<database_name>\n\nExample: jdbc:mysql://address=(protocol=tcp)(host=127.0.0.1)(port=3306)/myDatabase\n\nFor more information about the URL format, refer to the MySQL official documentation.\n\nFrom the Authentication list, select the authentication method that you want to use to authenticate the connection. The following options are available:\n\nUser & Password: by using your login and password.\n\nNo auth: authentication is not required.\n\nIn the User and Password fields, type your user credentials.\n\nTo use no password, leave the Password field empty.\n\nTo delete a once entered password, right-click the Password field and select Set Empty.\n\nIn the Database field, type the database name to which you want to connect.\n\nEnter the path to the Unix socket file in Socket. Alternatively, click the Open icon ( ) and navigate to it.\n\nURL only: connect by using only the URL.\n\nIn the URL field, JetBrains Rider generates the JDBC URL automatically using the values of other connection settings.\n\nIf you need to use a JDBC URL with certain additional settings, paste it in the URL field. The general URL to use is as follows:\n\nFormat: jdbc:mysql:///<database_name>?(port=3306)&junixsocket.file=<path_to_the_unix_socket_f&le>&socketFactory=org.newsclub.net.mysql.AFUNIXDatabaseSocketFactoryCJ\n\nExample: jdbc:mysql:///myDatabase?(port=3&06)&junixsocket.file=/var/run/s&ck/mdb.sock&socketFactory=org.newsclub.net.mysql.AFUNIXDatabaseSocketFactoryCJ\n\nFor more information about the URL format, refer to the MySQL official documentation.\n\nFrom the Authentication list, select the authentication method that you want to use to authenticate the connection. The following options are available:\n\nUser & Password: by using your login and password.\n\nNo auth: authentication is not required.\n\nIn the User and Password fields, type your user credentials.\n\nTo use no password, leave the Password field empty.\n\nTo delete a once entered password, right-click the Password field and select Set Empty.\n\nIn the URL field, JetBrains Rider generates the JDBC URL automatically using the values of other connection settings.\n\nIf you need to use a JDBC URL with certain additional settings, paste it in the URL field.\n\nFor more information about the URL format, refer to the MySQL official documentation.\n\nFor the reference information about connection settings and properties on the General and other tabs of Data Sources and Drivers dialog (Shift+Enter) , see Connection settings and DBMS-specific properties.\n\nEnsure that the connection to the database can be established using the provided details. To do that, click the Test Connection link at the bottom of the connection details area.\n\nIn case of any connection issues, refer to the Cannot connect to a database page.\n\n(Optional) By default, only the default schema is introspected and available to work with. If you also want to work with other schemas, in the Schemas tab, select them for the introspection.\n\nClick OK to create the data source."
