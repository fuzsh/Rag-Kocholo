        "text": "The data type of a column defines what value the column can hold: integer, character, money, date and time, binary, and so on.\n\nMySQL Data Types (Version 8.0)\n\nEach column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type.\n\nAn SQL developer must decide what type of data that will be stored inside each column when creating a table. The data type is a guideline for SQL to understand what type of data is expected inside of each column, and it also identifies how SQL will interact with the stored data.\n\nIn MySQL there are three main data types: string, numeric, and date and time.\n\nString Data Types\n\nNumeric Data Types\n\nNote: All the numeric data types may have an extra option: UNSIGNED or ZEROFILL. If you add the UNSIGNED option, MySQL disallows negative values for the column. If you add the ZEROFILL option, MySQL automatically also adds the UNSIGNED attribute to the column.\n\nDate and Time Data Types"
