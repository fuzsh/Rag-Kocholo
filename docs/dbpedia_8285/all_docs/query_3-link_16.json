        "text": "TL;DR Summary\n\nUnderstand what it means that MySQL is a server application\n\nI would like to practice SQL and install MySQL, one of the most popular open source DMBS. MySQL workbench can also to be installed and used as a visual GUI to interact with MySQL which in turns interacts with the database.\n\nMy question: is MySQL a server application? If so, what does it mean? I am familiar with the client server model used on the internet where some computers have server operating systems and run server programs while other machines have installed client operating systems (like Windows 10 or 11) and have client applications (Word, Chrome, etc.)\n\nMySQL is called a server application. Does it mean that is can only be run on a machine that has a server operating system (ex: Apache)? I don't think so. Does it simply mean that someone on a different computer could interact with the database hosted on my computer (which has MySQL server installed) as long as they have a MySQL client program?\n\nIf I am the only user of the database, I guess I will not need a MySQL client and will be able to interact with MySQL server directly via MySQL workbench...\n\nThanks!\n\nfog37 said:\n\nis MySQL a server application?\n\nYes. More precisely, the MySQL server is a server application.\n\nfog37 said:\n\nIf so, what does it mean?\n\nIt means that the MySQL server is not an application that you, as a user, run and interact with directly. It is an application that runs in the background and responds to requests from a client, i.e., some other application. The \"client\" application does not have to be an application that you or any other user runs directly either; it could, for example, be a web server application that makes use of data stored in a MySQL database, and interacts with the database by making requests to a MySQL server. (This is how many, if not most, database-backed web applications are run, for various reasons that are probably beyond the scope of this discussion.)\n\nfog37 said:\n\nI am familiar with the client server model used on the internet where some computers have server operating systems and run server programs while other machines have installed client operating systems (like Windows 10 or 11) and have client applications (Word, Chrome, etc.)\n\nThe difference between client and server operating systems is pretty small these days; a server running Linux is running the same Linux that many users' desktops or laptops run, just with some configuration differences and a different set of installed programs. Windows servers might be somewhat more differentiated from Windows desktops or laptops, but even there the difference in the OS itself is not very large.\n\nThe main way in which a server differs from a client computer is that a server does not have any users interacting with it directly, unless an administrator has to log into do maintenance or fix some problem.\n\nfog37 said:\n\nMySQL is called a server application. Does it mean that is can only be run on a machine that has a server operating system (ex: Apache)?\n\nApache isn't an operating system, it's a web server program. Some servers that run database backed web applications will have a MySQL server running on the same machine as a web server like Apache; but the underlying operating system is most likely going to be Linux.\n\nHowever, you can run a MySQL server (or, for that matter, an Apache web server) on any machine, including your own desktop. Developers often do this to test applications before deploying them to production servers visible to the Internet.\n\nfog37 said:\n\nDoes it simply mean that someone on a different computer could interact with the database hosted on my computer (which has MySQL server installed) as long as they have a MySQL client program?\n\nThat in itself wouldn't be enough; both computers would also have to be on the same network, such as your home LAN or your office LAN, behind some kind of firewall. You probably don't want your computer visible to the entire Internet (unless you like having various bots and crawlers constantly trying to break into your machine).\n\nfog37 said:\n\nIf I am the only user of the database, I guess I will not need a MySQL client and will be able to interact with MySQL server directly via MySQL workbench...\n\nYes, you could do that. I believe that would mean you would be running a MySQL server on your desktop (or laptop) machine. For just doing your own development and testing that's fine.\n\nA server is so called because it provides a service to other programs (possibly running on other machines). Essentially servers sit on a machine somewhere and listen for requests from other programs and, when they get such a request, reply with the requested data. So, for example, there's a server somewhere that listens to incoming network traffic, waiting for requests in the form https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/something/. When it receives such a request it goes away and looks in its database for posts in the requested thread (possibly by passing some SQL to a separate SQL server in the process) and sends that back to the requesting computer.\n\nThat's different to the situation where you write a program that loads data from disk, where your compiled code directly includes binary instructions to seek information on disk. All that functionality is in one program.\n\nThe analogy you are meant to make is with serving staff, for example in a restaurant. They provide a way for you to make requests in a standard form (they give you a menu and you make a request), you may be able to customise your request within limits (you could ask for mash instead of chips, but you can't get Chinese from an Indian), and then they go away and fulfill your request. That may mean actually cooking your food themselves, or it may mean them relaying your instructions in some form (numbers on their order pad, for example) to other servers (the kitchen staff) and returning the result. This is distinct from your kitchen, where you can do everything without any communication with other people.\n\nPeterDonis said:\n\nYes. More precisely, the MySQL server is a server application. It means that the MySQL server is not an application that you, as a user, run and interact with directly. It is an application that runs in the background and responds to requests from a client, i.e., some other application. The \"client\" application does not have to be an application that you or any other user runs directly either; it could, for example, be a web server application that makes use of data stored in a MySQL database, and interacts with the database by making requests to a MySQL server.

I believe that would mean you would be running a MySQL server on your desktop (or laptop) machine. For just doing your own development and testing that's fine.\n\nThank you! I appreciate the clarifications.\n\nI get that a \"server\" is an application (generally hosted on a powerful machine but not necessarily) that can handle requests and provide resources to applications installed on other machines or even to applications installed on the same machine as the server. We can have web servers, mail servers, ftp servers, etc.\n\n\"Server applications\" can run on a machine that is not running a server operating system... I think Jupyter Notebook, which we discussed in the past, is an example of a server application, i.e. a client-server application: both a server app and a client app are installed on the same machine and we use the client (the browser) to access the server app (I think the server app then accesses the Python interpreter...)\n\nIs a server application sometimes called a \"local server\" or \"localhost\"?\n\nIn regards to databases, I am planning to create a database using MySQL server (and MySQL workbench for ease) on my Windows 10. I will then set up a small LAN (3 Windows machines including mine).\n\nThe other two computers would connect to the database on my machine only if they have a MySQL client software installed on them. Can MySQL Workbench work as a MySQL client or would those two machines need to install an actual MySQL client application?\n\nAt the base, MySQL is just a program that manages databases. It can be used like any program from the command line. Following is an example on my computer (Linux) where:\n\nI open MariaDB at the \"jack\" prompt (A program that branched out of MySQL; very similar);\n\nThe program gives a little introduction and presents a \"MariaDB [(none)]\" prompt;\n\nI type the MariaDB command \"SELECT 2 + 2;\"';\n\nThe program responds with a table where the value \"2 + 2\" is given as \"4\";\n\nThe MariaDB prompt comes up again, where I choose to exit the program.\n\nBut the program is also designed to be used as a server, where it also listens to a TCP port as @DennisN mentioned in post #4. No need for the command line, a client can connect and send directly its requests, and wait for the responses. Whether the client is on your computer or somewhere else on the Internet is just a matter of who you give access to the TCP port in question.\n\nA tool like MySQL Workbench (which is probably a MySQL client, using the TCP port?) will connect directly to MySQL and make the interaction with MySQL a lot easier than with the command line.\n\nfog37 said:\n\nThank you! I appreciate the clarifications.\n\nGood, @PeterDonis's posts here are excellent.\n\nfog37 said:\n\nI get that a \"server\" is an application... Jupyter Notebook, which we discussed in the past, is an example of a server application...we use the client (the browser) to access the server app...\n\nYes all of this is pretty much correct.\n\nfog37 said:\n\nIs a server application sometimes called a \"local server\" or \"localhost\"?\n\nIf a server application is running on the same machine as its client then it can be called a local server, yes (this is the terminal window titled 'Jupyter Notebook' that comes up when you run Jupyter in Windows).\n\nBut \"localhost\" refers to the machine the client is running on, not to any server software that is running on that machine (so pointing your browser at https://localhost/ connects to a secure web server running on the local computer, connecting a MySQL client to localhost:3306 connects to a MySQL server running on the local computer etc.)\n\nfog37 said:\n\nIn regards to databases, I am planning to create a database using MySQL server (and MySQL workbench for ease) on my Windows 10.\n\nOK.\n\nfog37 said:\n\nI will then set up a small LAN (3 Windows machines including mine).\n\nI don't recommend you do that, keep everything on the same machine unless you want to become an expert in network configuration and security. What would be the point of doing this anyway?\n\nfog37 said:\n\nCan MySQL Workbench work as a MySQL client\n\nMySQL Workbench is a MySQL client, you wouldn't describe it as anything else.\n\njack action said:\n\nAt the base, MySQL is just a program that manages databases.

That's how MySQL works on my Linux system. Here's an example similar to yours, where I use the mysql client as user jtbell to connect to the database music:\n\nCode:\n\njtbell@ubuntu:~$ mysql -u jtbell -p music Enter password: Reading table information for completion of table and column names You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A Welcome to the MySQL monitor.
