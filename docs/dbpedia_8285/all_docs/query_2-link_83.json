        "text": "A database is an organized list of facts and information that can easily be accessed, managed, and updated. Database management system is a software application that interacts with the user and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A general-purpose DBMS is designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases. There are many well-known DBMSs which include MySQL, MS Access Database, MS SQL Server, Oracle etc. A database is not generally portable across different DBMSs, but different DBMSs can interoperate by using standards such as SQL and ODBC or JDBC to allow a single application to work with more than one DBMS. This paper presents the salient features of developed DataBase Connector tool. The developed tool allows the user to perform DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) command on different DBMSs including MS Access Database, SQL Server Database, SQL Express Database, XML Database and Oracle Server Database. The user has no need to have different software application to perform data definition and data manipulation operation on these different DBMSs."
