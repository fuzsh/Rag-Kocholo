StrongTypingException: The value for column 'IsPrimaryKey' in table TableDetails is DBNull.\". The only table in the database has a primary key by the way:\n\nCREATE TABLE `test` (\n\n`ID` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\n\n`Value` int(11) NOT NULL,\n\nPRIMARY KEY (`ID`)\n\n) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=1 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;\n\nI installed MySQL 5.7 with the Developer Default option, meaning that My SQL for Visual Studio 1.2.5 and MySQL Connector 6.9.8 are installed.\n\nIn my attempts to get to the source of this issue I tried some combinations:\n\n* MySQL 5.6 with the EF 5 works. I can add, update and use an EDMX model.\n\n* MySQL 5.6 with the EF 6 works partly. When adding an EDMX model the wizard crashes. I can add a model for the EF 5, update EF to 6, install the Nuget package 'MySql.Data.Entity' and update the EDMX model to EF 6. The model works when running the application. But trying to update the model from the database results in an exception.\n\n* After creating an EF 6 model like above and using it on a machine with MySQL 5.7 the model works, but updating (again) results in the StrongTypingException.\n\nI hope that this issue can somehow be solved via some MySQL configuration. I already tried show_compatibility_56=ON on the machine with MySQL 5.7. Did not help.\n\nWould be nice if someone could point me in the right direction. Does anyone have the Entity Framework (6) running with MySQL 5.7?\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nDispose() throws an exception (no replies)\n\nI'm running the MySQL connector in an ASP.NET application.

I'm running the lastest MySql.Data version (6.9.8)\n\nI can image that the connector tries to gracefully close a connection to the server. But if that fails I think the Dispose should not throw an exception. The object is gone afterwards anyway. Maybe on the server there is a leftover, but the connector has no control over the server anyway.\n\nIs this a known issue? Or is it a 'works-as-designed'? If so, why was it designed that way?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n↧\n\nProgram hangs on MySqlConnection.Open() (1 reply)\n\nHi.\n\nMy program hangs when I try to open a connection to a non-existing server ( when my server is not running ).\n\nOf course it's not acceptable that my program won't continue, when a connection can't be made.\n\nWhen I put the Open() method in a try block and catch MySql.Data.MySqlClient.MySqlException then it won't hang and I get the Message ( .Message of the exception ): Unable to connect to any of the specified MySQL hosts after about a second ( my timeout is set to 5, though changing it doesn't affect the time that it takes to get the error ).\n\nWhen I am using the \"using\"-statement like this:\n\nusing(var connection = new MySqlConnection(myConnectionString))\n\n{\n\nconnection.Open();\n\n}\n\nThen it won't work ( program hangs ).\n\nAnother problem is with the MySqlDataReader.\n\nIt will also hang if there is no connection.\n\nIf I catch Exception ( not MySqlException ) I got it working at some point, but again this also won't work with the \"using\" statement.\n\nThe MySQL is usually running but as I said before, I can't accept my program to not work properly when no connection could be made.\n\nWhy can't I use the using-statement and what's the best way to handle it, when a connection can't be made?\n\n↧\n\nHow Enable Arabic Unicode for a Database between MySQL and Visual Studio 2010?

We are heavy users of stored procedures and stored functions. The client part of the app is written in .NET and accessed through the .NET connector.\n\nMySQL is installed on an AWS EC2 VM running ubuntu 14.04 LTS\n\nEver since we upgraded to MySQL 5.6 (we are running 5.6.28) from 5.5 we started randomly getting errors about MySQL unable to find a function. These are transient errors, they come in bunches and then go away. The functions are compiled in the database and run just fine right before and right after we get the transient error both through the app and from workbench.\n\nThe errors are like this:\n\nFUNCTION l2.fn_getCustomerSetting does not exist\n\nA separate environment running the same app, different AWS availability zone that has not been upgraded to 5.6 does not have the issue. We never had the issue prior to the upgrade. There is no DDL work being done when this happens. i.e. we are not creating nor dropping functions.
