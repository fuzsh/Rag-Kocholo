        "text": "Today, we're looking at MySQL vs MS SQL Server. Relational database management systems (RDBMS) form the backbone of enterprise IT. The main difference between MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server is that MySQL is an open-source RDBMS known for its cross-platform compatibility and cost-effectiveness, while Microsoft SQL Server is a commercial RDBMS primarily designed for the Windows platform, offering advanced features and tight integration with Microsoft technologies.\n\nThe crucial question is then: which RDBMS is right for your business needs and objectives? When comparing relational database solutions, two names seem to come up more than any others: MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server.\n\nThe main difference between MySQL and MS SQL are:\n\nLicensing and Pricing: MySQL is an open-source database, generally free to use, while MS SQL Server is a commercial product with a variety of licensing options.\n\nPlatform Support: MySQL is platform-independent and can run on various operating systems, whereas MS SQL Server is primarily designed for the Windows environment.\n\nSecurity Features: MS SQL Server provides more advanced security features, such as row-level security and data encryption, while MySQL offers basic security features with additional third-party extensions.\n\nLanguage and Syntax: MySQL uses a more standard SQL language, while MS SQL Server uses Transact-SQL (T-SQL), which is an extended version of SQL with additional capabilities.\n\nFull-Text Search: MS SQL Server has built-in full-text search support, whereas MySQL provides full-text search only for the MyISAM storage engine, with limited support in the InnoDB storage engine.\n\nIntro to Relational Database Management Systems\n\nRelational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) are a powerful class of database systems that efficiently store, manage, and manipulate structured data. The foundation of RDBMS lies in the relational model, which was proposed by E.F. Codd in 1970. This model organizes data into tables, or relations, consisting of rows and columns. Each row represents a record or an instance of an entity, while each column represents an attribute or property of that entity.\n\nOne of the key strengths of RDBMS is its ability to establish relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys. This feature enables complex data manipulation and retrieval using the Structured Query Language (SQL), a standardized language designed specifically for managing relational databases.\n\nRDBMS offers several benefits, including data integrity, consistency, and efficiency in managing vast amounts of structured data. They are widely used in various industries, from banking and healthcare to e-commerce and content management systems.\n\nMySQL vs. Microsoft SQL Server: What Are They?\n\nMySQL is an open-source RDBMS solution that was purchased by Oracle in 2008. As a component of the popular LAMP web application development stack, MySQL powers some of the world’s most highly visited websites, including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.\n\nMicrosoft SQL Server (MSSQL) is an RDBMS solution developed and maintained by Microsoft. First released in 1989, SQL Server is now available in many different versions with different feature sets, including Enterprise, Standard, and Express versions.\n\nThe question of MySQL vs. MS SQL Server is a tough one, and there’s no right answer for every organization. Below, we’ll go over the most important factors to consider when choosing between SQL Server and MySQL.\n\nMySQL vs. Microsoft SQL Server: Operating System\n\nWhen selecting an enterprise-grade database, most companies have already invested a great deal of time, money, and expertise in their IT infrastructure—including their choice of operating system. This means that whether you go with MySQL or SQL Server, your choice of database solution needs to mesh well with your existing workflow.\n\nFortunately, both MySQL and SQL Server run on virtually all major operating systems. MySQL is traditionally associated with Linux as part of the famed LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). However, it also offers full-fledged support for Windows and Mac OS X, as well as other Unix-based operating systems.\n\nSQL Server, meanwhile, is developed by Microsoft and was originally written for Windows. In recent years, however, Microsoft has made strides in embracing the open-source community, which includes providing support for both Linux and Mac OS X. The most recent versions of SQL Server run on Linux natively, and will run on Mac OS X within a Docker container.\n\nThe bottom line: The right call here depends on what operating system your company is already using. Both platforms support Windows and Linux, although there are certain “home court advantages” to each one.\n\nUsing SQL Server makes a little more sense if you’re already a Windows and .NET shop. On the other hand, if you use Linux and Python/Java/PHP, MySQL is probably the better choice here.\n\nMySQL vs. Microsoft SQL Server: Cost\n\nCost is always a factor when making software purchasing decisions. An enterprise-grade database might be (and often should be) one of your biggest IT expenses. The good news is that both MySQL and SQL Server offer a free tier for users with less demanding IT requirements.\n\nMySQL Community Edition is the free, open-source version of MySQL, which means that it’s a great start to get your feet wet and start learning the platform. It’s more than capable of running smaller production loads, but you’ll have to pay more for additional support.\n\nSQL Server’s free offering comes in two different flavors:\n\nSQL Server Developer includes all of the features of SQL Server, but cannot be used in production. According to Microsoft, SQL Server Developer is a “full-featured version of SQL Server software that allows developers to cost-effectively build, test, and demonstrate applications.”\n\nSQL Server Express is a freely available version of SQL Server, including for production use. However, Express comes with some technical restrictions in place that are unsuitable for large-scale deployments. Microsoft describes it as a “free entry-level database that’s ideal for learning, as well as building desktop and small server data-driven applications of up to 10 gigabytes.”\n\nIt’s always tempting to save money by trying to make your IT needs fit the limitations of the free tier. Yet if your database is mission-critical, this may actually be costing you money in the long run. For large-scale deployments, paying for advanced features such as monitoring, backup, and fast support is almost certainly worth the cost.\n\nAlready bypassed the limitations of the free tier? The cost of MySQL and SQL Server depends on how powerful of a database you need, and what sort of support you’re looking for.\n\nMySQL Cost\n\nFor a more complete MySQL feature set (as well as support from Oracle), you’ll need to shell out some bucks. The various MySQL editions will run you anywhere from $2,000 to $10,000 per server annually.\n\nMySQL comes in three different tiers: Standard Edition, Enterprise Edition, and Cluster CGE. Choosing between them largely depends on the complexity and scale of your data needs.\n\nAll three MySQL tiers include 24x7 Oracle Premier Support, as well as essential features such as MySQL Database Server, MySQL Connectors, and MySQL Replication. However, only Enterprise Edition and Cluster CGE include advanced features such as monitoring, backup, security, and high availability.\n\nMicrosoft SQL Server Cost\n\nAccording to Microsoft’s pricing page for SQL Server 2019, you can pay anywhere from $899 (standard edition, server licensing) to $13,748 (enterprise edition, two cores). There’s a wide discrepancy in pricing here, and your business needs will dictate how much power you need.\n\nThe bottom line: Once again, the winner here depends on your business requirements. Both solutions offer a free tier, and both have pricing schemes with multiple tiers. Without more specific information, the best thing to do is to speak with the sales department of each solution to get a final quote based on your specific needs.\n\nCloud computing has revolutionized the face of enterprise IT. According to RightScale’s 2019 “State of the Cloud” report, 94 percent of companies now use the cloud in some form or fashion.\n\nAs it stands today, the “big 3” cloud providers are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Each provider offers a robust suite of services, including storage and computing—and, of course, SQL databases.\n\nThe cloud revolution is so impactful that it’s also affected the first two factors in this article: operating system and cost. Many cloud providers have fully managed database services, in which the provider handles the operating system and server complications for you. Customers can subscribe to a “pay as you go” model, giving them more flexibility and control over plan costs. This shift to cloud computing has somewhat diminished the importance of factors such as operating system and cost, while emphasizing other considerations such as performance and toolset.\n\nHere’s how both offerings stack up in terms of the cloud.\n\nMySQL Cloud Support\n\nAll three of the biggest cloud providers support MySQL:\n\nAmazon Web Services: Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) for MySQL\n\nMicrosoft Azure: Azure Database for MySQL\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform: Cloud SQL for MySQL\n\nWhat’s more, all three services claim a rich feature set, including high availability, easy scalability, robust security, and pay-as-you-go pricing.\n\nLike the cost of the database itself, the price of MySQL cloud solutions also depends on your circumstances—there’s no “one size fits all” answer here. The best approach might be to test out a MySQL environment in each of the three clouds and run some tests that are typical of your business operations. This should give you a rough estimate of how the different costs will shake out.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that Oracle (the owner of MySQL) also features a cloud offering for MySQL, Oracle MySQL Cloud Service. This might be worth exploring due to Oracle’s “native” support of MySQL.\n\nHowever, a SQL database is only one piece of your IT architecture landscape—you still need storage, computing, and security services. Oracle’s not currently a market leader in these domains, which means that the Oracle cloud may be a riskier choice for hosting MySQL.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the “big 3” cloud providers all offer virtual machine services for running your own MySQL instances. This option gives you more control over your database, but requires more expertise (and is also more expensive).\n\nSQL Server Cloud Support\n\nLike MySQL, each of the “big 3” cloud providers has a Microsoft SQL Server offering:\n\nAmazon Web Services: Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) for SQL Server\n\nMicrosoft Azure: Azure SQL Database\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform: Cloud SQL for SQL Server\n\nThere’s an interesting twist here: Microsoft, one of the major cloud providers, is also the creator of SQL Server. While AWS and Google both offer strong alternatives, there’s a sense that Microsoft has a “home-court advantage” in this respect.\n\nAs with MySQL, you can also pay to host Windows virtual machines in the cloud and self-host SQL Server this way. Of course, this also comes with the same expertise requirements and cost concerns.\n\nThe bottom line: Although either solution works as a cloud offering, SQL Server is the winner here: the one-two punch of SQL Server and Microsoft Azure is hard to beat. If you’ve already invested in MySQL, or you’re already using another cloud provider, then it’s probably best to stick with what you know. In a greenfield project, however, the SQL Server/Microsoft Azure choice should be highly compelling.\n\nMySQL vs. Microsoft SQL Server: Database Performance\n\nDatabase performance is crucial for any software application. If your database doesn’t respond quickly and efficiently, the entire system is slowed down, causing unacceptable delays to the end user. Poor database performance directly harms key business metrics such as user experience and revenue.\n\nHowever, database performance is also heavily dependent on an immense number of variables. Slight differences in workloads can dramatically skew results, while minor tweaks can see major improvements. In other words, a well-designed database is worth its weight in gold.\n\nMySQL and SQL Server both tout extensive performance and scaling capabilities. When it comes down to cold, hard facts, however, SQL Server seems to have the advantage. According to one study, SQL Server consistently beat MySQL in comparison testing involving high volumes of SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries.\n\nAlso note that MySQL is considered to be Oracle’s “entry-level” database. For top-shelf performance needs, Oracle will likely steer you toward their flagship database offering, Oracle Database. On the other hand, SQL Server is Microsoft’s flagship database offering.\n\nThe bottom line: It’s not a slam dunk, but SQL Server’s better numbers and flagship status give it the edge here.\n\nNo database is an island—whether you choose MySQL or SQL Server, you’ll need a good toolset to work with it. Both solutions offer front-end clients specifically for this purpose.\n\nMySQL’s client application is MySQL Workbench, which runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. MySQL Workbench offers several important database management tools, including:\n\nDatabase connection and management\n\nSQL editing and execution\n\nDatabase and schema modeling\n\nPerformance monitoring and query statistics\n\nSQL Server’s client application is SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). Note that SSMS is only available on Windows, unlike SQL Server itself. However, Microsoft provides an extension for the Visual Studio Code editor to execute SQL from a Linux machine.\n\nSSMS has a more robust feature set than MySQL Workbench, including:\n\nExtensive database management tools\n\nA robust set of security, reporting, and analysis services\n\nA powerful execution plan visualizer for identifying performance bottlenecks\n\nIntegrated source control\n\nReal-time activity monitoring, including filtering and automatic refresh\n\nThe bottom line: Both toolsets offer the basics: the ability to execute SQL, as well as view and manage databases. However, SSMS for SQL Server comes out on top here, with features that please novice users and seasoned DBAs alike. The execution plan visualizer, in particular, can pay for itself many times over.\n\nMySQL vs. Microsoft SQL Server: Language Support\n\nAs relational databases, both MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server use SQL to interact with their schema and data. The SQL dialect is slightly different between these two solutions, but not enough to influence your decision one way or another. In particular, SQL Server uses the proprietary T-SQL extension to SQL, which enables concepts such as procedural programming, local variables, and string and data processing functions.\n\nHowever, MySQL and SQL Server differ when it comes to the runtime languages that interface with the database. Both solutions support connections with the major programming languages: C#, Java, PHP, C++, Python, Ruby, Visual Basic, Delphi, Go, R, and more. As long as your language can make a connection using ODBC (Open Database Connectivity), you should be good to go.\n\nIf you’re using a .NET language like C#, F#, or Visual Basic, then SQL Server will have a home-court advantage. Microsoft wrote the ADO.NET library, which facilitates access to databases and data services, specifically for SQL Server.\n\nOne final note: SQL Server offers the additional (and controversial) mechanism of invoking .NET code from a stored procedure. This can add all sorts of functionality within your database—but it also makes it easy for you to shoot yourself in the foot. Proceed with caution.\n\nThe bottom line: Both MySQL and SQL Server support the most common programming languages, although SQL Server has the advantage for .NET languages.\n\nMySQL vs. Microsoft SQL Server: Differences\n\nBoth MySQL and SQL Server are relational database management systems (RDBMS), but they have a variety of differences. Here are the key distinctions:\n\nVendor:\n\nMySQL: Originally developed by a Swedish company, MySQL AB. It's now owned and supported by Oracle Corporation.\n\nSQL Server: Developed and marketed by Microsoft.\n\nPlatform Support:\n\nMySQL: Available on various platforms, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and others.\n\nSQL Server: Traditionally, SQL Server was Windows-only, but since SQL Server 2017, it has been available on Linux as well (known as SQL Server on Linux). Microsoft also introduced SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters, which supports deployment on Kubernetes.\n\nLicensing and Costs:\n\nMySQL: Open-source and has a GPL license, but also offers commercial licenses for enterprise users.\n\nSQL Server: Commercial product with several editions ranging from free (Express) to enterprise, with costs escalating for advanced features and scalability.\n\nPerformance Tools:\n\nMySQL: Offers tools like MySQL Workbench for database design, modeling, and administration.\n\nSQL Server: Comes with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and has integration with Azure for cloud services and tools.\n\nProgramming Language Support:\n\nMySQL: Supports procedural language in the form of stored routines using SQL procedural language.\n\nSQL Server: Supports T-SQL (Transact-SQL) for procedural programming and also integrates with .NET languages allowing for CLR (Common Language Runtime) stored procedures and functions.\n\nBackup:\n\nMySQL: Provides hot backup capability through third-party tools or MySQL Enterprise Backup for paying users.\n\nSQL Server: Offers a wide range of backup and recovery tools out of the box.\n\nHigh Availability & Scalability:\n\nMySQL: Supports replication, including master-slave and master-master replication, and also offers the MySQL Cluster solution for high availability.\n\nSQL Server: Provides AlwaysOn Availability Groups, database mirroring, log shipping, and failover clustering.\n\nStorage Engines:\n\nMySQL: Allows for multiple storage engines, such as InnoDB, MyISAM, and MEMORY, each suited for particular use cases.\n\nSQL Server: Uses a single storage engine, but offers table partitioning, data compression, and in-memory optimized tables and procedures.\n\nJSON Support:\n\nMySQL: Added JSON support in version 5.7, allowing JSON document storage and related functions.\n\nSQL Server: Introduced JSON support in SQL Server 2016, offering JSON functions and storage.\n\nWhile both RDBMSs are powerful and feature-rich, the choice between them often comes down to specific project requirements, licensing considerations, existing infrastructure, and personal or organizational preferences.\n\nMySQL vs Microsoft SQL Server: Which is Right for You?\n\nDeciding between MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL) depends on a lot of your business requirements, existing infrastructure, and specific use cases. Here are some key considerations to help determine which database is right for you:\n\nCost and Licensing:\n\nIf your budget is tight or you prefer open-source solutions, MySQL is generally the better choice. Its free community edition can handle smaller production loads without additional costs.\n\nFor businesses needing advanced features and willing to invest in robust support and performance, MS SQL’s varied commercial licensing options might be more appropriate. Despite higher costs, it offers comprehensive support and advanced capabilities.\n\nOperating System Compatibility:\n\nMySQL is platform-independent, running seamlessly on Windows, Linux, and macOS, making it ideal for organizations with diverse operating systems.\n\nMS SQL, traditionally Windows-focused, now also supports Linux and can run on macOS through Docker containers. If your infrastructure is heavily invested in Windows and .NET, MS SQL could be the more seamless integration.\n\nSecurity Features:\n\nMS SQL provides advanced security features like row-level security and built-in data encryption, which are crucial for organizations with stringent security requirements.\n\nMySQL offers basic security features but can be extended with third-party tools. If advanced security is a top priority, MS SQL may be the better option.\n\nPerformance and Scalability:\n\nFor high-performance workloads, MS SQL has demonstrated superior performance in various independent tests, making it a strong candidate for large-scale, resource-intensive applications.\n\nMySQL, while highly capable, is often considered Oracle’s entry-level database, with Oracle Database being the go-to for top-tier performance needs. For smaller to medium-sized applications, MySQL remains a solid choice.\n\nDevelopment Environment:\n\nMySQL’s use of standard SQL and compatibility with various programming languages makes it flexible for diverse development environments, especially those involving Linux, Python, Java, or PHP.\n\nMS SQL’s integration with the Microsoft ecosystem, including strong support for .NET languages like C# and Visual Basic, makes it a natural fit for organizations using Microsoft development tools.\n\nCloud Integration:\n\nBoth databases are well-supported by major cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. However, MS SQL’s deep integration with Microsoft Azure can offer a more cohesive experience for businesses already using other Microsoft services.\n\nMySQL’s versatility and presence in various cloud environments make it a strong candidate for organizations seeking flexibility and a wide range of deployment options.\n\nToolset and Usability:\n\nMS SQL Server Management Studio(SSMS) offers a richer feature set compared to MySQL Workbench, particularly in terms of security, reporting, analysis, and performance optimization tools.\n\nMySQL Workbench provides essential database management functionalities and is sufficient for many standard use cases, especially in smaller or less complex environments.\n\nMySQL vs. Microsoft SQL Server: Which Database is Right for You?\n\nAfter this long, drawn-out MySQL vs. SQL Server comparison, which database is the best for you? There’s a lot of information to unpack here, and the right answer is still “it depends.” Here’s the best summary we can give:\n\nIf you’re a Linux shop already using parts of the LAMP stack, then MySQL will fit in nicely.\n\nIf you’re a Windows shop already using .NET and the Microsoft ecosystem, then SQL Server is the obvious choice.\n\nIf you’re looking to make a clean start, the evidence leans slightly toward SQL Server. Microsoft is building momentum in the cloud with Azure, while also embracing open-source and ecosystems like Linux. What’s more, SQL Server has a better toolset and arguably better performance.\n\nWhether you go with SQL Server or MySQL, your database needs to connect smoothly with the rest of your IT infrastructure. In particular, you’ll need an intermediate API (application programming interface) layer that connects your database to the front-end user interface.\n\nThe good news is that DreamFactory has built a system that automatically generates code to connect your back-end database with your front-end GUI. With a bit of configuration and a few clicks of a mouse, DreamFactory turns your database into a production-ready REST API—and even generates the documentation alongside it.\n\nDreamFactory supports all kinds of SQL databases: MySQL, SQL Server, and a long list of others.
