        "text": "MySQL is a relational database management system based on SQL-Structured Query Language used for accessing and managing records in a database. It can be easily connected with programming languages such as Python, Java, and PHP to serve various purposes that require CRUD ( Create,Read,Update,Delete) operations. MySQL is based on a client – server architecture which follows a request – response cycle. Clients make requests through the GUI screen or command prompt by using specific SQL expressions on MySQL. The server application responds with the requested expressions and produces the desired result on the client-side.\n\nSteps to Connect to MySQL Server using VSCode:\n\nStep 1: Open Visual Studio Code.\n\nStep 2: Go to -> Extensions, to search for MySQL extension, type : MySQL\n\nStep 3: Open the extension called MySQL Management Tool and install it.\n\nStep 4: Now click on the Explorer option or press ( Ctrl + Shift + E ), MySQL is added to this section.\n\nStep 5: Click on Add Connection to create a new connection.\n\nStep 6:Here we have to provide the server address. The MySQL server is installed on your computer so the host name is, ‘localhost’.\n\nStep 7: Then provide a user name and the default username is ‘root’.\n\nStep 8: Provide the password that you created for this user at the time of MySQL installation and then provide the port number i.e; 3306.\n\nStep 9: Now you’ll see a connection is added to MySQL section from which databases can be accessed. You may see an authentication error. This error means that you are using the version 8 of MySQL server. This version defines and uses a new authentication method instead of old MySQL native password. If the MySQL Client does not use this new authentication method this error would be displayed.\n\nStep 10: The solution is to create a new SQL user that uses old authentication method. Go to the folder where MySQL is installed.\n\nStep 11: Open the bin folder. Select the file path and type ‘cmd‘.\n\nStep 12: Now to connect to the server, type the following command:\n\nmysql -u root -p\n\nHere -u means that you’ve to provide the username that is ‘root’ and -p means you have give the password.\n\nErrors:\n\nIf you face any errors regarding connection like, ( ERROR 2003 (HY000): Can’t connect to MySQL server on ‘localhost:3306’ (10061) )\n\nGo to Services, then search for MySQL or MYSQL80 and right-click, click on the start button to start the service.\n\nStep 13: Create a new user:\n\nCREATE USER 'sqluser'@'%' IDENTIFIED\n\nWITH mysql_native_password BY 'password' ;\n\nA new user is created by the name ‘sqluser’ with password ‘password’. Provide this user with all the privileges :\n\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'sqluser'@'%' ;\n\nWe need to validate these privileges :\n\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\nStep 14: Delete the previous connection.\n\nStep 15: Add a new connection by providing the following details:\n\nHost: localhost\n\nUser: sqluser\n\nPassword: password\n\nPort number : 3306\n\nStep 16: The connection is established and you can see the existing databases.To create a new database, right click on localhost and create a new query.\n\nStep 17: Type the following commands to create a new database and table inside it.\n\nCREATE DATABASE myrestaurant ;\n\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS myrestaurant.users(\n\nid INT(10) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n\nname VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,\n\nphone VARCHAR(200),\n\naddress VARCHAR(200),\n\npassword VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL\n\n);\n\nINSERT INTO myrestaurant.users(name,phone,address,password)\n\nVALUES\n\n('Gaurav','123456789','Mumbai,India','pass134'),\n\n('Sakshi','987654321','Chennai,India','pass456');\n\nStep 18: Run this MySQL query.\n\nStep 19: Refresh the connection to see the new table named ‘users’ added to this database.Right click on ‘users’ and ‘select top 1000’.\n\nStep 20: Run this MySQL query and see the results.\n\nIn this way databases can be accessed and queries can be executed through VSCode. Since VSCode supports other programming languages also, it is easier to do database management through it."
