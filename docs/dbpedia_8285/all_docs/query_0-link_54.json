        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI am using a building modelling software and need to connect PythonAnywhere MYSQL database to it. I am using a visual programming language/interface called Dynamo for that software, that requires to either use built in nodes, or write commands in python. Unfortunately it is running on IronPython, that's why I can't use CPython connectors. I have to append .dll libraries and translate commands from C# to Python (you can see the names of the libraries on the image). I attempted to connect through SSH but I am not getting any response. \"[Errno: 22] A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.\" I am using The idea was to connect to SSH and then try to do some kind of forwarding to then connect to the database. I don't think I can move any further and troubleshoot until I get some kind of response from your server. Do you know what could be the problem and am I on the right track here? Any help will be appreciated!\n\nPS I've managed to connect with MYSQL Workbench to PythonAnywhere MySQL. Through Dynamo I am able to connect to a local MYSQL or cloud hosted on Azure (using just the code that you see in the bottom of the image). I've deleted the passwords after running it. ![enter image description here][1]\n\nhttps://ibb.co/g3v1sMM"
