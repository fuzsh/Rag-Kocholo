What is one reason to introduce data redundancy into a normalized database design?\n\nto reduce corruption in data\n\nto reduce storage space\n\nto make the system faster\n\nto prevent data anomalies\n\nNote: \"to make the system faster\" can also be correct. For example we can calculate some heavy query in advance and store its result in some column (use it as a cache). So if \"system\" means \"application which uses mysql\" then it's correct too.\n\nQ57. The code snippet below is used to read data from an XML file into a table. Which XML structure is _not_ supported by the statement?\n\nLOAD XML LOCAL INFILE 'cars.xml' INTO TABLE cars ROWS IDENTIFIED BY `<car>`;\n\nA\n\n<car> <field name=\"make\"> Lexus </field> <field name=\"model\"> IS300 </field> <field name=\"make\"> 2016 </field> </car>\n\nB\n\n<car name=\"make\"> Dodge </car> <car name=\"model\"> Ram </car> <car name=\"year\"> 2000 </car>\n\nC\n\n<car make=\"Ford\" model=\"Mustang\" year=\"2002\"/>\n\nD\n\n<car year=\"2010\"> <make>Mercedes</make> <model> C-Class</model> </car>\n\nQ58.

Which statement about the TRUNCATE TABLE statement is true?\n\nIt will stop and issue an error when it encounters a row that is referenced by a row in a child table.\n\nIt always first drops, then re-creates a new table.\n\nIt deletes rows one by one on tables with foreign key constraints.\n\nIt does not invoke the DELETE triggers associated with the table.\n\nNote: both answers are correct - see TRUNCATE TABLE Statement in MySQL manual\n\nQ60. You are working with the tables as shown in this diagram. You need to get the number of cars sold per the home state of each customer's residence. How can you accomplish this?\n\nSELECT state, COUNT(*) FROM customers WHERE ID IN (SELECT customerID FROM purchases) GROUP BY state;\n\nSELECT state, COUNT(*) FROM customers c LEFT JOIN purchases p ON c.ID = p.customerID GROUP BY state;\n\nSELECT state, COUNT(*) FROM customers c, purchases p WHERE c.ID = p.customerID GROUP BY state;\n\nSELECT state, COUNT(*) FROM customers GROUP BY state;\n\nExplanation: THe difference between 2 and 3 is that LEFT JOIN will return 1 row per customer before grouping. If replaced with RIGHT JOIN it would return the correct info.\n\nQ61. In data migration, there is often a need to delete duplicate rows as part of data cleanup.

If you want to use MyISAM instead of InnoDB, which option do you need to specify in the CREATE TABLE statement?\n\nENGINE\n\nPARTITION\n\nSTORAGE\n\nTABLESPACE\n\nQ67. You are working with the table in this diagram. You want to use full-text search to find the customers who live on a street or a drive. What is the command to do that?\n\nTable name: customers\n\nID lastname firstname phone address city state zip A001 Smith Bob 212-555-1212 1001 1st Street New York NY 10001 A002 Chang John 213-555-5678 888 Rodeo Drive Los Angeles CA 90210 A003 Smith Mary 999-999-9999 123 Main Street Anytown VA 12345 A004 Johnson Jack 312-312-3120 1111 Chicago Avenue Chicago IL 60606 A005 Lopez Linda 737-777-3333 123 Main Street Austin TX 73344\n\nA\n\nSELECT * FROM customers WHERE address MATCH 'Street' OR 'Drive';\n\nB\n\nSELECT * FROM customers WHERE MATCH(address) IN ('street, drive');\n\nC\n\nSELECT * FROM customers WHERE address MATCH 'Street' OR address MATCH 'Drive';\n\nD\n\nSELECT * FROM customers WHERE MATCH(address) AGAINST ('street, drive');\n\nQ68.
