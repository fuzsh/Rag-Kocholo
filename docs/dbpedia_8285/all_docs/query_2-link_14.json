        "text": "The previous blog on MySQL Tutorial mainly focused on the various commands and concepts related to SQL. In this blog on MySQL Workbench Tutorial, you will learn the tool for MySQL to perform various operations.\n\nThe following topics will be covered along this blog:\n\nWhat is MySQL?\n\nMySQL Workbench & its Functionalities\n\nInstall MySQL Workbench\n\nMySQL Workbench Editions\n\nCreating a connection\n\nSQL Development Editor\n\nAdministrative Tasks\n\nPerformance Dashboard\n\nDatabase Designing & Modelling\n\nData Migration Wizard\n\nAdvanced MySQL Capabilities\n\nMySQL Workbench Tutorial: What is MySQL?\n\nMySQL is an open-source relational database management system, which works on many platforms. It provides multi-user access to support many storage engines.\n\nMySQL has various features that enable us to do many tasks such as comprehensive application development, providing availability and scalability.\n\nNow, obviously, when you work at an industry level, you can’t do everything on the terminal right? You need some kind of dashboard which makes it easy for you to work with large databases and create models.\n\nWell, the dashboard that can perform these actions is the MySQL Workbench.\n\nMySQL Workbench Tutorial: MySQL Workbench & its Functionalities\n\nMySQL Workbench is a designing or a graphical tool, which is used for working with MySQL servers and databases. This tool is compatible with the older server 5.x versions and does not support the 4.x server versions.\n\nThe functionalities of MySQL Workbench are as follows:\n\nSQL Development: This functionality provides the capability to execute SQL queries, create and manage connections to database servers using the built-in SQL Editor.\n\nData Modeling (Design): This functionality enables you to create models of your database schema graphically, perform reverse and forward engineer between a schema and a live database, and edit all aspects of your database using the comprehensive Table Editor.\n\nServer Administration: This functionality enables you to administer MySQL server instances by administering users, performing backup and recovery, inspecting audit data, viewing database health, and monitoring the MySQL server performance.\n\nData Migration: This functionality allows you to migrate from Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, and other RDBMS tables, objects, and data to MySQL.\n\nMySQL Enterprise Support: This functionality provides support for Enterprise products such as MySQL Enterprise Backup, MySQL Firewall, and MySQL Audit.\n\nNow that you know about MySQL Workbench, let me next tell you the basic requirements and the steps to install MySQL Workbench.\n\nMySQL Workbench Tutorial: Install MySQL Workbench\n\nThe basic system requirement to install MySQL Workbench is you should have MySQL installed on your system.\n\nNow, MySQL Workbench is available for many operating systems. Each of these systems have their own basic requirements that you can refer to from here.\n\nApart from this, to download the MySQL Workbench, you have to click on the Downloads tab and then choose the edition that you want to download.\n\nSo, for example, if you want to download the Community edition of Workbench on Windows, you can refer to the link here.\n\nNow that you know how to install it, let me tell you the editions of MySQL Workbench Editions.\n\nMySQL Workbench Tutorial: MySQL Workbench Editions\n\nMySQL Workbench is mainly available in three editions:\n\nCommunity Edition (Open Source, GPL)\n\nStandard Edition (Commercial)\n\nEnterprise Edition (Commercial)\n\nFeaturesCommunity EditionStandard EditionEnterprise EditionVisual SQL DevelopmentYesYesYesVisual Database AdministrationYesYesYesPerformance TuningYesYesYesUser and Session ManagementYesYesYesConnection ManagementYesYesYesObject ManagementYesYesYesData ManagementYesYesYesVisual Data ModelingYesYesYesReverse EngineeringYesYesYesForward EngineeringYesYesYesSchema SynchronizationYesYesYesSchema & Model Validation 1NoYesYesDBDoc 1NoYesYesGUI for MySQL Enterprise Backup 1NoNoYesGUI for MySQL Enterprise Audit 1NoNoYesGUI for MySQL Enterprise Firewall 1NoYesYesScripting & PluginsYesYesYesDatabase MigrationYesYesYes\n\nNow, once you download and install MySQL Workbench, you will see the following screen i.e. the home tab.\n\nOn the left side of the Home tab, you see 3 different icons right?\n\nWell, these are the mainly the 3 modules:\n\nSQL Development – This section consists of the SQL editor through which you can create and manage databases.\n\nData Modelling – This section enables you to model your data according to your need.\n\nServer Administration – This section is used to Migrate your databases between connections.\n\nNow, before you get into these modules, to use their functionalities. You have to first start by creating a connection.\n\nMySQL Workbench Tutorial: Creating a connection\n\nNow, to create a connection you have to click on the plus sign that you see on the home tab that you see.\n\nOnce you click on that, you will see this dialog box, wherein you have to mention the connection name, connection method and other details that you can see in the dialog box. After you mention the details, just click on OK.\n\nOnce you click on OK, you will see that your connection has been created.\n\nNow, let’s continue our discussion by getting into the SQL Editor.\n\nFind out our MS SQL Course in Top Cities\n\nIndiaIndiaSQL Training in BangaloreSQL Course in PuneSQL Training in ChennaiSQL Course in MumbaiSQL Training in HyderabadSQL Course in Kolkata\n\nMySQL Workbench Tutorial: SQL Editor\n\nThe SQL Editor is used consist of a set of specialized set of editors such as query, schema, and table. Apart from this, the editor also consists of four panes that you can see on the screen.\n\nUsers & Privileges\n\nThis tab provides a list of all users and privileges who relate to an active MySQL server instance. So, with this tab, you can add and manage user accounts, adjust privileges, and expire passwords. Refer to the snapshot below.\n\nData Export & Import\n\nThere are majorly three ways to export and import data in MySQL Workbench which you can go through the below table.\n\nGUI LocationData SetExport TypesImport TypesResult Grid menu under the SQL editorThe result set (after performing an SQL query)CSV, HTML, JSON, SQL, XML, Excel XML, TXTCSVObject Browser context menuTablesJSON, CSVJSON, CSVManagement NavigatorDatabases and/or TablesSQLSQLManagement NavigatorDatabases and/or TablesSQLSQL\n\nNow, to export/ import data, you have to choose the option of Data Export / Data Import from the Navigator Pane.\n\nAfter you choose the option, you have to mention the path name of the folder from/to which you want to import/export. Refer to the snapshot below.\n\nMySQL Enterprise Backup Interface\n\nThe commercial releases of MySQL Workbench enable us to use a MySQL Enterprise Backup (MEB) functionality so that we can safeguard the data from any loss.\n\nThere are mainly two MySQL Enterprise Backup operations available from MySQL Workbench:\n\nFrom the left side, the plus sign lets you add a new EER Diagram. The folder sign allows you to add saved EER models, on your PC to base the Workbench. The arrow sign that you see, lets you either create an EER Model from Database or EER Model from a Script.\n\nThe below snapshot is the basic view MySQL Workbench.\n\nIn the database modeling, you can create an EER diagram using the model editor. So, you can add a table, add a view, add a routine, edit the data in the table, highlight a specific part of the model.\n\nWell, guys, this is not an end to the functionalities, I leave the rest of them so that you explore.\n\nMySQL Workbench Tutorial: Data Migration Wizard\n\nThe MySQL Workbench provides the ability to migrate ODBC-compliant databases to MySQL. It allows you to migrate to different database types, including MySQL, across servers. It also enables to convert tables and copy data, but will not convert stored procedures, views, or triggers.\n\nApart from working on many platforms, the migration allows customization and editing during the migration process.\n\nThe following are the steps performed by Migration Wizard while migrating a database to MySQL:"
