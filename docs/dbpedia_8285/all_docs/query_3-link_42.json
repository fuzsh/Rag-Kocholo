It is written in Java and should run on any operating system that provides a Java Runtime Environment.\n\nIts main focus is on running SQL scripts (either interactively or as a batch) and export/import features. Graphical query building or more advanced DBA tasks are not the focus and are not planned. It's not intended as a full blown \"development IDE\", but more as a powerful command line.\n\nCurrent stable version: Build 131 (2024-05-05)\n\nCurrent development build: 131.1 ( 2024-07-21)\n\nFeatures:\n\nEdit, insert and delete data directly in the query result (Screenshot)\n\nPowerful export command to write text files (aka \"CSV\"), XML, HTML or SQL (including BLOB data).\n\nAll user tables can be exported into a directory with a single command. Export files can be compressed \"on-the-fly\".\n\nPowerful text, XML and spreadsheet import. A set of files (including compressed files) can be imported from a directory with a single command. Foreign key constraints are detected to insert the data in the correct order\n\nCompare two database schemas for differences. The XML output can be transformed into the approriate SQL ALTER statements using XSLT\n\nCompare the data of two database and generate the necessary SQL statements to migrate one to the other.\n\nSupports running SQL scripts in batch mode\n\nSupports running in console mode (Screenshot)\n\nSearch text in procedure, view and other sources using a SQL command or a GUI ( Screenshot 1 Screenshot 2)\n\nSearch for data across all columns in all tables using a SQL command or a GUI (Screenshot 1 Screenshot 2)\n\nReformatting (Pretty-Print) of SQL Statements (Screenshot)\n\nSelect rows from related tables according to their foreign key definitions (Screenshot 1 Screenshot 2).\n\nTooltips for INSERT statements to show the corresponding value or column (Screenshot)\n\nCopy data directly between to database servers using a SQL command or a GUI (Screenshot)\n\nMacros (aka aliases) for frequently used SQL statements\n\nVariable substitution in SQL statements including smart prompting for values (can be combined with macros)\n\nAuto completion for tables and columns in SQL statements (Screenshot)\n\nDisplay database objects and their definitions (Screenshot)\n\nDisplay table source (Screenshot)\n\nDisplay view, procedure and trigger source code (Screenshot)\n\nDisplay foreign key constraints between tables (Screenshot)\n\nFull support for BLOB data in query results, SQL statements, export and import.
