        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn this article, we’ll learn to connect the MySQL Database with the C# .NET Framework application in Visual Studio. This is a foundational hands-on article that will help beginners to connect a widely used freely available database like MySQL in C# through other freely available tools. This article doesn’t require any paid applications or software.\n\nStep 1\n\nFirst of all, let us start with the installation of XAMPP. XAMPP makes it possible to create a local server with Apache and MySQL databases with other features.\n\nOnce the installation is done, the control panel should look something like this.\n\nStep 2\n\nClick on Start on Apache, MySQL, and FileZilla. The buttons turn the labels into Stop.\n\nStep 3\n\nOpen your browser and type, localhost/phpmyadmin/\n\nThe page will look something like as follows. This is where the database can be accessed, and viewed and instructions can be performed right away. This is the location to access, the MySQL database.\n\nStep 4\n\nClick on Databases.\n\nNow, Under Create Database, Type the name of the new database we are going to create.\n\nType, TestDB, leave the Collation as it is, and then click on Create.\n\nStep 5\n\nThe Database TestDB has now been created. Let us create a Table now.\n\nStep 6\n\nRun the SQL Query\n\nCREATE TABLE PhoneBook { Id int, Name varchar(255), MobileNo int };\n\nStep 7\n\nThe Table has been created with an empty set and zero rows.\n\nStep 8\n\nYou can view the table on the database from the Structure Option in the bar.\n\nClick to browse and see the contents of the table.\n\nStep 9\n\nNow, let us install Visual Studio. The Community Edition is free and can be accessed from the Microsoft Official Website.\n\nOnce installed, the Visual Studio Installer can be opened. Now, click on Launch.\n\nStep 10\n\nClick on Create a New Project.\n\nCreate the project for Windows Forms App in C#, .NET Framework with the Solution name of your choice.\n\nStep 11\n\nYou can see the solution Explorers as shown below with the references and resources all set up for the Framework.\n\nStep 12\n\nNow, let us go to Tools on the Menu Bar and select Connect to Database. There are numerous but no MySQL Database Options. This can be resolved by installing the MySQL Connector and MySQL for Visual Studio.\n\nStep 13\n\nNext, we need to install MySQL Connectors and MySQL for Visual Studio. Visit the following sites to obtain the download file for the respective installations, ADO.NET Driver for MySQL (Connector/NET) and MySQL Installer for Visual Studio.\n\nDownload the ADO.NET Driver for MySQL (Connector/NET) and MySQL Installer for Visual Studio 1.2.10 – Microsoft Windows – x86 MSI Installer.\n\nStep 14\n\nOnce the MySQL Installations are done, restart Visual Studio.\n\nStep 15\n\nNow, go to Solution Explorer. Right-click on the project, click on Add, and select the Reference.\n\nStep 16\n\nClick on MySql.Data and MySql.DataEntityFramework for EF6 primarily. And then Click on Ok.\n\nStep 17\n\nNow, let us go back to Server Explorer. Double-Click on Data Connections and Choose Add Connections. You’ll be taken to Choose Data Source Option.\n\nUnder Data Source, Now, we can see the MySQL Database option. This wasn’t there primarily when we hadn’t installed MySQL Connector and MySQL for Visual Studio.\n\nStep 18\n\nNow, Click on Continue. The Server Name, User Name, Password, and Database Name are to be filled in.\n\nRemember, this is the same as that of your database on the localhost/phpmyadmin\n\nI’ve put in my Server name which is “localhost”, a User name that is “root” and my password. Remember, above we made the Database TestDB for this very experiment. Here, we can use the lowercase name “testdb”.\n\nClick on Test Connection and as the success is prompted, choose OK.\n\nNote\n\nIn case any issues occur that prompt an error for database connection, choose the Advanced option and under the SSL Mode, Choose None. This would solve the error.\n\nStep 19\n\nNow, we can see the localhost(testdb) database on our DataConnections with its tables. Remember, the PhoneBook table that we created earlier in phpmyadmin? See, it’s here now.\n\nStep 20\n\nRight Click on the table, and we can see the options for Trigger, Table Script Generation, Query, Designing, and Retrieving Data.\n\nWhen we choose the generate Table Script, the following script will pop up.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose to retrieve data, the data can be seen. Here, since, we haven’t entered any data, NULL is seen.\n\nStep 21\n\nTo test, if the connection has been made, let's go back to localhost/phpmyadmin and insert some data on the table PhoneBook.\n\nWhen we reload, we can see the NULL has now changed to numerous data on Id, Name, and MobileNo in the phonebook.\n\nStep 22\n\nMoreover, to connect using MySQL Connector/NET for Windows Applications, we can do it through the following code.\n\nMySql.Data.MySqlClient.MySqlConnection conn; string myConnectionString; myConnectionString = \"server=localhost;uid=root;\" + \"pwd=null;database=testdb\"; try { conn = new MySql.Data.MySqlClient.MySqlConnection(); conn.ConnectionString = myConnectionString; conn.Open(); } catch (MySql.Data.MySqlClient.MySqlException ex) { MessageBox.Show(ex.Message); }\n\nThe above code can be used to integrate MySQL in C# in the native Windows authentication and CRUD operations can then be performed on top of it. We’ll learn more about it in our next article.\n\nConclusion\n\nThus, in this article, we learned in step by step process the method to connect the MySQL Database in Visual Studio for C# .NET Framework. We set up XAMPP, Visual Studio, MySQL Connector, and MySQL for Visual Studio and then created a Windows Form App in C# .NET Framework. Lastly, we connected the MySQL database to our Windows Form Application."
